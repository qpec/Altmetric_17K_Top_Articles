Association of Reports of Childhood Abuse
and All-Cause Mortality Rates in Women
Edith Chen, PhD; Nicholas A. Turiano, PhD; Daniel K. Mroczek, PhD; Gregory E. Miller, PhD
A
large literature has documented long-term adverse ef-
fects of childhood abuse on an array of adult psychi-
atric problems including depression, substance abuse,
and posttraumatic stress disorder.1,2 However, the physical
health consequences of child abuse have been less well un-
derstood, particularly the consequences for later-life mortal-
ity risk.
Studies have demonstrated that broadly conceived
adverse childhood experiences (including abuse, but also in-
cluding other exposures such as parental divorce or parental
substance abuse) are associated with a host of morbidity and
mortality outcomes in adulthood, ranging from heart disease
to cancer to pulmonary diseases.3-5 Research focused on child
abuse specifically has shown it to be associated with poorer
self-reports of health, functional limitations, and chronic dis-
eases, such as respiratory conditions and diabetes, in
adulthood.6-10 Childhood abuse also has been associated with
biomarkers related to disease risk in adults (eg, elevated cho-
lesterolandbloodpressure).11-14Ameta-analysisconfirmedthat
there is approximately a 0.5-SD increase in morbidity risk
across multiple health conditions in adults abused as chil-
dren compared with control groups of adults who were not
abused.15
However, fewer studies have investigated the implica-
tions of child abuse for mortality risk. Previous studies tended
to focus on childhood deaths,16,17 which are more likely to be
IMPORTANCE Research has linked childhood abuse to a variety of adult psychiatric problems,
but little is known about associations of child abuse with adult mortality.
OBJECTIVE To test associations of retrospective reports of physical and emotional abuse in
childhood with all-cause mortality rates in adulthood.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS National sample of 6285 adults (aged 25-74 years at
baseline) from the survey of Midlife Development in the United States. Baseline psychosocial
data were collected in 1995 and 1996, with follow-up mortality data collected through
October 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants completed questionnaires at baseline about
self-report of childhood emotional abuse, moderate physical abuse, and severe physical
abuse. Mortality data during the next 20 years was tracked using the National Death Index.
RESULTS Of the 6285 participants included in the study sample, 2987 were men (48%) and
5581were white (91%), with a mean (SD) age of 46.9 (12.95) years. Women who reported
childhood emotional abuse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.49; P = .04), moderate
physical abuse (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.60; P = .02), or severe physical abuse (HR, 1.58; 95%
CI, 1.20-2.08; P = .001) were at increased risk for all-cause mortality during the follow-up
period. Reports of more types of childhood abuse were also associated with a greater risk of
all-cause mortality in women (all vs none HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.24-2.30; P = .001; some vs none
HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.52; P = .04). These effects could not be accounted for by childhood
socioeconomic status, personality traits, or adult depression. No associations were observed
in men.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that in addition to the established
psychiatric consequences of abuse, women who report childhood abuse also remain
vulnerable to premature mortality into adulthood. Thus, reported childhood abuse may have
long-term ramifications for health and longevity in women.

a direct consequence of the abuse. Previous research on ad-
verse childhood experiences (including abuse) documented
that a greater number of childhood adversities are associated
with higher risk of all-cause mortality.18,19 The only previous
study that we are aware of that focused on childhood abuse
found no greater risk of mortality in adults abused as chil-
dren; however, the sample was in their 20s and 30s at
follow-up.13Toourknowledge,thisstudyrepresentsoneofthe
first efforts to investigate the effects of reported childhood
abuseonlong-termriskofmortality(20years)inalargesample
of midlife adults (mean age of 47 years, with the oldest being
74 years at baseline).
This study also tested whether different types of re-
ported childhood abuse would be associated with adult mor-
tality. Previous research has been mixed, sometimes finding
associations between physical abuse and health,11 other times
finding relationships for emotional abuse,15 or sometimes
both.7,12 In this study, we tested associations with 3 different
types of self-reports of abuse (emotional, moderate physical,
and severe physical abuse) as well as whether the accumula-
tion of types of reported abuse were associated with adult
all-cause mortality.
Last, we investigated sex differences based on previous lit-
erature that observed abuse effects specifically in female
samples.10,11,15,20 Sex differences in response to early-life stress
are also evident in animal models.21 In addition, we tested
whetherourself-reportmeasureofchildhoodabusemightsim-
ply be acting as a proxy for other factors also associated with
early mortality, including low childhood socioeconomic sta-
tus, personality variables (neuroticism or conscientious-
ness), or depression, by testing whether associations be-
tween reported childhood abuse and adult mortality risk
remained after statistical adjustment for these variables.
Methods
Participants
Data for this study come from the national survey of Midlife
Development in the United States,22 a national sample of 7108
noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults (ages 25-74
years). Six thousand three hundred twenty-five participants
completed the mail-in questionnaires in 1995 and 1996. Mor-
tality data were then collected through October 2015. Institu-
tionalreviewboardapprovalwasobtainedfromHarvardMedi-
cal School and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, with
participantconsentobtainedbytelephone.Thisstudyusesdata
from 6285 participants who both completed the abuse ques-
tionnaire and had survival time data available. See eMethods
in the Supplement for more details about the sample and
measures discussed in the next section.
Measures
Self-report of Childhood Abuse
Child abuse questions came from a revised version of the Con-
flict Tactics Scale.23,24 Questions probed 3 categories of child-
hood abuse: emotional, moderate physical, and severe physi-
cal abuse.6,20 Consistent with previous studies, we focused on
reportsofabusefromtheparticipants’motherorfather.6-9,25,26
We coded abuse as present if it was reported as happening fre-
quently (when participants endorsed one of the items hap-
pening either sometimes or often during childhood), consis-
tent with previous studies.6,7,26
Accumulation of types of abuse was coded by summing
the number of abuses that were reported during childhood,
consistentwithapproachesinpreviousresearch.12,26Thisvari-
able was coded as none (no abuse reported), some (1-2 types
of abuse reported), or all 3 types of abuse reported.
All-Cause Mortality
By the censor date of October 31, 2015, there were a total of
1091 confirmed deaths in the study sample (17.4%). Mortality
data on participants were obtained from National Death In-
dex reports. Survival time for decedents was the interval (in
years) from the date when Midlife Development in the United
States questionnaires were returned (1995-1996) to the date
of their death. Participants who were still alive had survival
times that equaled the length of the follow-up (censored at
October 31, 2015).
Alternative Explanations
Childhood Socioeconomic Status | Participants were asked about
their parents’highest educational degree. This variable was
coded as either both parents having less than a high school
diploma (0) or one or more parent having a high school di-
ploma or higher (1).
Personality | Personality traits were assessed using Big 5
markers.27,28 We focused on neuroticism and conscientious-
ness as potential alternative explanations for study findings.
Depression | The presence of major depression in the previous
12monthswascodedbasedonthedefinitionandcriteriaspeci-
fied in the American Psychiatric Association DSM.29-31 Depres-
sion was coded as present or absent (1 or 0).
Covariates | Covariates included participants’ age, race/
ethnicity, current socioeconomic status (educational attain-
ment), history of major chronic diseases (cancer or heart dis-
ease), and health behaviors (smoking or alcohol use).
Key Points
Question What is the association of self-reports of childhood
abuse with adult all-cause mortality?
Finding In this cohort study, the experience of retrospectively
reported severe physical abuse, moderate physical abuse, or
emotional abuse in childhood were all associated with a higher risk
of all-cause mortality during a 20-year follow-up period in women
but not in men.
Meaning In addition to its established psychiatric consequences,
reports of childhood abuse may also have long-term ramifications
for health and longevity among women.

Statistical Analyses
Cox proportional hazards regression models were estimated
in SPSS, version 23 (IBM Corporation). Survival time in years
was regressed onto childhood abuse variables. To test whether
patterns differed by sex, we first regressed survival time onto
the covariates described in the previous section (step 1), the
main effects of sex and abuse (step 2), and then the sex × abuse
interaction (step 3). We then conducted regression analyses
separately for men and women with different sets of co-
variates. In model 1, demographic variables of age, race/
ethnicity, and current socioeconomic status were included.
Model 2 added medical variables (history of cancer or heart
disease). Model 3 added health behaviors (smoking or alco-
hol use). Model 4 added childhood socioeconomic status.
Model 5 added personality variables (neuroticism and consci-
entiousness). Model 6 added depression.
Results
See eTable 1 in the Supplement for descriptive information
about the sample. Men were more likely to report severe physi-
cal abuse (χ2 = 4.87; P = .03) and marginally more likely to re-
port moderate physical abuse (χ2 = 3.76; P = .05), but were no
different on emotional abuse from women (χ2 = 0.16; P = .69).
Men also were more likely to die (χ2 = 14.70; P < .001) and had
fewer years of survival than women (t test = 3.12; P = .002).
Sex × Abuse Interactions
After controlling for demographic factors, medical condi-
tions, and health behaviors, there was no significant main ef-
fect of severe reported physical abuse on all-cause mortality
(HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96-1.39; Wald statistic = 2.391; P = .12).
There was a main effect of sex on mortality (HR, 1.16; 95%
CI,1.18-1.52;Waldstatistic = 19.31;P < .001),butthiswasquali-
fied by a sex × abuse interaction (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-
0.94; Wald statistic = 5.26; P = .02).
With respect to moderate physical abuse, there was no sig-
nificant main effect of reported moderate physical abuse on
all-cause mortality (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90-1.19; Wald statis-
tic = 0.199; P = .66). There was a main effect of sex (HR, 1.34;
95% CI, 1.18-1.53; Wald statistic = 19.52; P < .001), but this was
qualified by a sex × abuse interaction (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-
0.98; Wald statistic = 4.57; P = .03).
With respect to emotional abuse, there was no significant
maineffectofreportedemotionalabuseonmortality(HR,1.00;
95% CI, 0.87-1.14; Wald statistic = 0.00; P = .97). There was a
main effect of sex (HR 1.34; 95% CI, 1.18-1.53; Wald statis-
tic = 19.85; P < .001), but this was qualified by a sex × abuse
interaction (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.99; Wald statis-
tic = 4.16; P = .04).
With respect to types of abuse, there was no effect of types
of abuse on mortality (Wald statistic = 3.16; P = .21). There was
a main effect of sex (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.18-1.53; Wald statis-
tic = 19.98; P < .001), but this was qualified by a sex × abuse
interaction (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92; Wald statis-
tic = 8.35; P = .004). Given these interactions, we conducted
follow-up analyses separately by sex.
Women
Table 1 presents analyses with different sets of covariates
(models 1-3). Across demographic, medical, and health
behavior covariates, reports of severe childhood physical
abuse were associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortal-
ity in women (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.20-2.08; Wald statis-
tic = 10.483; P = .001). We then tested alternative explana-
tions for this finding. To examine whether childhood
socioeconomic status might better account for the results, we
included parent education (model 4) but found that reported
severe childhood physical abuse was still associated with
mortality risk (Wald statistic = 10.638; P = .001). Because of
concerns about the veridicality of abuse reports, we then
tested whether personality traits (neuroticism and conscien-
tiousness) might better account for the findings. Even with
these variables included (model 5), reported severe child-
hood physical abuse continued to be associated with mortal-
ity (Wald statistic = 11.074; P = .001). Lastly, we tested
whether depression might play a role, but after including
depression (model 6), reported severe childhood physical
abuse continued to be associated with women’
s mortality
(Wald statistic = 10.380; P = .001) (Figure).
Reported moderate physical abuse in childhood was as-
sociatedwithanincreasedriskofall-causemortalityinwomen
(Table 2). After controlling for demographic, medical, and
health behavior covariates, reported moderate physical
abuse was associated with greater mortality (HR, 1.30; 95%
CI, 1.05-1.60; Wald statistic = 5.776; P = .02) (model 3). When
we tested alternative explanations, we found that with par-
ent education (model 4) and personality traits (model 5)
included, reported moderate physical abuse was still associ-
ated with mortality risk (Wald statistics, 5.949 and 5.983;
P = .02 and P = .01, respectively). Lastly, with depression
included (model 6), reported moderate physical abuse con-
tinued to be associated with mortality risk in women (Wald
statistic = 5.366; P = .02).
Women who reported emotional abuse in childhood were
at greater risk of all-cause mortality (Table 3). After control-
ling for demographic, medical, and health behavior covari-
ates, reported childhood emotional abuse was associated with
greater risk of mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.49; Wald sta-
tistic = 4.038; P = .04) (model 3). With parent education and
personality traits included as covariates (models 4 and 5), re-
ported emotional abuse was still associated with mortality risk
(Wald statistics, 4.553 and 4.132; P = .03 and P = .04, respec-
tively). With depression included (model 6), reported emo-
tional abuse became marginally significant (Wald statis-
tic = 3.657; P = .06).
The accumulation of types of abuse was also associated
with mortality in women (Table 4). After controlling for demo-
graphic, medical, and health behavior covariates, those who
reported a higher number of abuse types were at greater risk
of mortality (Wald statistic = 12.514; P = .002) (model 3). With
parent education, personality traits, and depression in-
cluded (models 4-6), types of abuse were still associated with
mortality risk (Wald statistic = 13.123; P = .001; Wald statis-
tic = 12.974; P = .002; and Wald statistic = 12.014; P = .002, re-
spectively) (Figure).

to their small number). Across demographic, medical, and
health behavior covariates, all patterns remained the

(HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.23-2.22; Wald statistic = 11.28; P = .001);

types of abuse (Wald statistic = 15.78; P < .001) all remained

reported severe physical abuse (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.70-
1.20; Wald statistic = 0.40; P = .53); moderate physical
abuse (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70-1.20; Wald statistic = 1.39;
P = .24); emotional abuse (HR, 0.85; 0.70-1.03; Wald statis-
tic = 2.76; P = .10); and types of abuse (Wald statis-
tic = 4.997; P = .08) were not significantly associated with
all-cause mortality.
Discussion
This is the first study that we are aware of to link self-reports
of childhood abuse to mortality in adult women. Women who
reported experiencing severe physical abuse, moderate
physical abuse, or emotional abuse from a parent were at
increased risk for all-cause mortality during the 20-year
follow-up period, compared with women who did not report
such experiences. These associations did not appear to be
specific to any type of reported abuse, although an accumu-
lation of more types of abuse was associated with a greater
risk of all-cause mortality in women. Furthermore, these
findings could not be explained by childhood socioeco-
nomic status, adult depression, or personality traits. There
were no associations between reports of abuse and mortal-
ity in men.
This study’
s findings are consistent with previous litera-
ture that has demonstrated links between childhood physi-
cal and emotional abuse and morbidity outcomes,7,9,11-13,15,20
but extends this pattern to all-cause mortality. Because of the
older age of our sample, if these reports are accurate, they
suggest that mortality effects may be less likely to be a
direct result of the abuse itself or suicide (more common in
adolescents and young adults) and instead more likely
owing to chronic diseases (the leading causes of death in
midlife and older adults, http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars
/leadingcauses.html).
Why would abuse during childhood continue to have
long-term effects into adulthood that culminate in greater
mortality risk? One explanation is that abuse heightens vul-
nerability to psychiatric conditions (eg, depression) that in
turn contribute to disease morbidity and mortality.32,33

Although we did not find support for this hypothesis, a
study with more regular and thorough assessments of psy-
chopathology is needed to definitively address this issue.
Another explanation is that children who experience abuse
may develop negative health behaviors (eg, drug use) as a
way of coping with stress, and these detrimental behaviors
may then contribute to preventable disease morbidity and
mortality.5,33,34 Obesity and its sequelae (eg, diabetes) could
be another possible pathway between childhood abuse and
mortality. Another possibility is that childhood adversities
become biologically embedded, calibrating how biological
systems operate across the lifespan. For example, adverse
childhood experiences may program the response tenden-
cies of immune cells in ways that perpetuate chronic inflam-
matory states that in turn heighten risk for cardiovascular
and other chronic diseases of aging.35
Our findings further indicate that both reports of physi-
cal and emotional childhood abuse are associated with all-
cause mortality later in life. These findings are consistent with
previous studies7,12 that suggest that both the physical harm
that comes from abuse as well as the emotional harm that
comes from abuse that is psychological in nature can have im-
plications for health outcomes.
In addition, the more types of abuse reported in child-
hood, the greater a woman’
s risk of all-cause mortality is as
an adult. This finding is consistent with previous literature
on adverse childhood experiences, where a greater number
of childhood adversities (eg, parent divorce and/or parent
mental illness) is associated with both morbidity (eg, heart
disease and/or respiratory diseases) and mortality outcomes
in adulthood.3-5,18,19
Findings in this study were evident for women but not
men. This pattern is consistent with other research that has
observed associations in all-women samples.6,11,15,20 It is
unclear why women might be more vulnerable to the effects
of abuse than men. One biological explanation could be that
characteristics that are differentially prevalent in women vs
men (eg, excessive release of steroid hormones in response
to stress21) and that are also linked to health outcomes may
help explain sex differences in abuse-mortality relation-
ships. Psychologically, it may also be that men and women
have different coping strategies for dealing with adversities
such as abuse and that men’
s, on average, may be more pro-
tective for their long-term health.
A major limitation of this study is the retrospective
assessment of childhood abuse. While we have interpreted
these findings as indicative of an effect of childhood abuse
exposure on later-life mortality, we must caution that the
retrospective and self-reported nature of the abuse measure
means that other explanations are always possible and that
these reports may not necessarily be an accurate representa-
tion of what happened in these participants’childhoods.
For example, there have been questions raised about the
validity of retrospective reports36,37 based on observations

that (1) the concordance between objectively verified abuse
and self-reports of abuse are not that high; (2) there is insta-
bility in self-reports of abuse over time; and (3) people may
be hesitant to endorse sensitive experiences such as abuse
in self-report questionnaires, leading to underreporting.
These are important limitations to acknowledge and cer-
tainly apply to this study. That said, there are a number of
reasons why we believe that this study still makes an impor-
tant contribution to the literature. First, in studies inter-
ested in mortality during midlife to later life, it would be
very difficult to have an assessment of abuse during child-
hood because this would require a longitudinal sample fol-
lowed up for more than half a century. While there are some
impressive cohorts that have been following up children
who experienced abuse for decades,13,38 until these samples
reach older adulthood, we may need to rely on retrospective
reports of childhood abuse in mortality studies. Second,
issues of bias are large in studies where participants are also
self-reporting on outcomes (eg, psychiatric conditions)
because the potential for these outcomes to influence
reports of abuse cannot be overlooked. However, this
study’
s focus was mortality that was verified by the
National Death Index, an outcome not subject to reporting
biases. Third, people’
s memories of whether an event has
occurred is typically better than their recall of the timing of
that event,37 and our study focused on occurrence rather
than timing of childhood abuse. Fourth, a review of the lit-
erature on recall of childhood adversities found that posi-
tive reports of abuse having happened are likely to be cor-
rect (the major validity concern is about not reporting), that
reports are more likely to be accurate if they do not rely on
judgment or interpretation, and that a rejection of all stud-
ies that involve retrospective recall of childhood abuse is
unwarranted.37 Other limitations of this study include the
fact that the Midlife Development in the United States sur-
vey did not contain information about sexual abuse or about
the age at which child abuse happened, both of which
would be important in future studies. Also, we note that the
occurrence of different types of abuse may overlap substan-
tially with one another, creating difficulties statistically
with detecting the unique effects of any particular type of
abuse. Finally, another limitation is that the Midlife Devel-
opment in the United States study does not contain infor-
mation about cause-specific mortality.

Conclusions
This study documented that self-reports of childhood
physical and emotional abuse were associated with
increased risk for all-cause mortality in women. These find-
ings suggest that women who report child abuse continue to
be vulnerable to premature mortality and perhaps should
receive greater attention in interventions aimed at promot-
ing health.
