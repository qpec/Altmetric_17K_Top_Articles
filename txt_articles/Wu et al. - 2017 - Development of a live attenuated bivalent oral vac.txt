ABSTRACT 
Shigella sonnei (Ss) and Salmonella Typhi cause significant morbidity and mortality. We 
exploited the safety record of the oral, attenuated S. Typhi vaccine (Ty21a) by utilizing it as a 
vector to develop a bivalent oral vaccine to protect against Ss shigellosis and typhoid fever. We 
recombineered the Ss form I O-antigen gene cluster into the Ty21a chromosome to create 
Ty21a-Ss, which stably expresses Ss form I O-antigen. To enhance survivability in the acid 
environment of the stomach, we created an acid resistant strain, Ty21a-AR-Ss, by inserting 
Shigella glutaminase-glutamate decarboxylase systems co-expressed with Ss form I O-antigen 
gene. Mice immunized intranasally (IN) with Ty21a-AR-Ss produced antibodies against Ss and S. 
Typhi, and survived lethal IN Ss challenge. This paves the way for proposed GMP manufacture 
and clinical trials intended to test the clinical effectiveness of Ty21a-AR-Ss in protecting against 
Ss shigellosis and typhoid fever as compared to the current Ty21a vaccine.

INTRODUCTION 
Shigellosis (bacterial dysentery) is caused by Shigella spp. bacteria. There were 188 million 
human Shigella infections in 2010 [1], affecting mainly children and causing 65,000 deaths. 
There are more than 40 serotypes of Shigella, but only a few responsible for the majority of 
shigellosis. In developing countries, S. flexineri accounts for most cases in children under age 5, 
while S. sonnei (Ss) is the second leading cause, at ~24% [2]. In developed countries Ss is the 
leading cause of shigellosis, with 75% of the estimated ~500,000 annual U.S. cases caused by Ss 
[3, 4]. Moreover, drug-resistant Ss infections associated with international travel have been 
increasingly reported [5, 6]. There is no safe and efficacious licensed vaccine against shigellosis 
[7].    
 
Protection against shigellosis is believed to be mediated primarily by antibodies to O 
polysaccharide (O-antigen) [8]. Genes encoding Ss O-antigen are uniquely located on the 
virulence plasmid so that only cells that express O-antigen (form I) are virulent [9]. Our strategy 
is to generate a bivalent vaccine against typhoid fever and Ss shigellosis by administering the 
Salmonella Typhi Ty21a vaccine expressing the Ss form I O-antigen (Ss-f1-Oag). 
 
The typhoid vaccine Ty21a (Vivotif®) [10] administered orally during one week, affords 
sustained protection for 7 years, with efficacies ranging from 42-96% in Indonesian, Chilean, 
and Egyptian field trials [11-13], and has had an excellent safety record in more than 200 million

recipients [10, 14-17]. Ty21a is nonpathogenic even when given at 100 times the standard dose 
[12].  
 
Ty21a expressing Ss-f1-Oag from a plasmid was shown to be protective in clinical trials [18]. 
However, the plasmid was unstable [19] and associated with lot-to-lot variation [18, 20]. 
Because of this instability, development of this Ty21a-based shigellosis vaccine was halted. 
 
The genetic instability associated with plasmid-borne immunogens has been overcome. A 
recombinant Ty21a strain with a genome-integrated Ss-f1-Oag gene cluster induced serum 
antibodies against Ss-f1-Oag and Salmonella O-9, 12 antigens, and protected mice against lethal 
challenge [21]. However, the immunization and infection routes were through intraperitoneal 
(IP) injection, which is not the natural oral, mucosal route for Ty21a immunization and S. Typhi 
and Ss infection. It is unknown if the vaccine strain will be effective when immunization and 
challenge is through a mucosal route. 
  
To induce protective immune responses, Ty21a must pass from the mouth to the ileum, where 
Ty21a invades M cells. The major barrier for a live, oral S. Typhi vaccine is the low pH in the 
stomach. Salmonella does not survive well at pH <3. Most E. coli strains and Shigella spp. 
remain viable at low pH for several hours [22, 23]. This difference likely explains why only 10-
100 Shigella cells are sufficient to cause infection, while ~105 CFU of Salmonella are needed. To

facilitate the journey from mouth to ileum without being eliminated in the stomach, Ty21a is 
placed in enteric-coated capsules meant to withstand gastric low pH.  
 
The ability of E. coli and Shigella to withstand pH < 2.5 primarily relies on an acid resistant (AR) 
system known as the glutamate-dependent acid resistance pathway [22, 24] consisting of the 
enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and a membrane bound antiporter. GAD consumes an 
intracellular proton to decarboxylate glutamate to produce -amino butyric acid (GABA) [25-29]. 
There are two isoforms of GAD, encoded by gadA and gadB, which are 98.7% identical in amino 
acid sequence and functionally redundant. The antiporter, encoded by gadC, pumps glutamate 
and GABA in and out of the cell [27].  
 
Recently, a newly discovered glutamine-dependent AR system was reported [30]. A previously 
uncharacterized bacterial glutaminase, encoded by ybaS, converts glutamine to glutamate in 
acidic conditions, releasing an ammonium that neutralizes an intracellular proton [30]. The 
antiporter for transporting substrate and product across cell membrane is also GadC [30]. 
Because the product of glutaminase is the substrate for GAD, we hypothesized that the 
glutaminase-GadC and GAD-GadC systems work in concert to convert a glutamine molecule 
into GABA, neutralizing two protons in the cell (Figure s1 and [30]). This concerted AR systems 
should function more efficiently than the GAD-GadC system alone [31] to enhance Ty21a 
viability in an acid environment.

We report the construction and characterization of Ty21a strains expressing Ss-f1-Oag alone or 
with the concerted glutaminase-GAD AR systems. Expression of the AR genes rendered our 
vaccine construct acid resistant in vitro. The strains induced antibodies to Shigella and 
Salmonella O-antigens when administered intranasally to mice, and the immunized mice 
survived intranasal lethal challenge with Ss. These results provide the foundation for 
development of a cost-effective and easy-to-administer vaccine against shigellosis and typhoid 
fever. 
 
METHODS  
Bacterial strains and media. Bacterial strains used or generated are listed in Table S1. Ty21a 
(Vivotif, Crucell Vaccines Inc, Miami Lakes, FL) was purchased. Seed banks were made in CY 
medium (1.2% yeast extract, 2% Hy-Case, 1.2% pepticase, 0.125% NaH2PO4, 0.33% NaCl, pH 7.2, 
with 0.2% glucose and 0.005% galactose), which is used for Vivotif production [10]. Ss 53G was 
a gift from Dr. Dennis Kopecko [9]. Form I Ss 53G were distinguished from form II based on 
colony morphology. Unless indicated, Ty21a and derivatives were grown on TSA or in TSB 
supplemented with 0.02% galactose. Ss strains were grown in TSA or TSB.  
 
Recombinant Ty21a strains were generated using the  Red recombineering technology [21, 32]. 
PCR fragments were amplified from a donor plasmid (Table S1) by Phusion high-fidelity 
polymerase NEB (Ipswich, MA) using upstream primers TviD-2004F (5'-TGATTGCTAA 
CGTCATGAGC-3') or GadC-1F (5’-ATGGCTACAT CAGTACAGAC-3’) and downstream primer VexA-

1066R (5'-AGAAAGAATT AGTGCCGCGG-3') and integrated in Ty21a harboring pKD46 [21, 32]. 
The KanR selectable marker was deleted from the chromosomal integrants by transformation 
with pCP20 and selecting for Kans transformants as described [21, 33]. Chromosomal 
integration and selection marker eviction were confirmed by genomic PCR analysis and 
antibiotics sensitivity tests. 
 
Plasmids. Plasmids are listed in Table S1 and details of plasmid construction using standard 
techniques and enzymes (NEB) are described in Supplementary data. Integrity of all plasmids 
generated in this study was confirmed by DNA sequencing.  
 
Assays. Methods for assays used in this study are described in detail in Supplementary data. 
 
Animal immunization. 4-8-week old female BALB/c (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) 
were maintained at Bioqual (Rockville, MD). They were immunized and assessed according to a 
protocol [34] approved by the Bioqual Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. On day of 
immunization, overnight cultures of bacterial strains grown in CY or CY supplemented with 1% 
trehalose and 0.75% arabinose (AR activated) were harvested and resuspended in PBS to a 
target concentration of 1  1011 CFU/mL. Mice anesthetized by isoflurane were intranasally 
inoculated with 5 μL of bacterial suspension at the anterior of each naris. Sera were collected a 
day before 1st immunization, and 2 weeks after each immunization.

Ss challenge. 3-6 single colonies of form I Ss 53G were pooled to inoculate into TSB and allowed 
to grow until mid-log phase (OD600 ~1.0). Cells were resuspended in PBS to a targeted 
concentration of 1  1011 CFU/mL and 10 L used to inoculate each mouse intranasally. Mice 
were monitored daily for 14 days post-infection. 
 
Statistical analyses. All tests were two-sided and performed using R (version 3.2.3) with stat 
and survival (2.38-3) packages.  
 
RESULTS  
Stable integration and expression from Ty21a chromosome  
We constructed a recombinant Ty21a with stable chromosomally integrated Ss-f1-Oag gene 
cluster between the tviD and vexA ORFs (Figure 1A) [21, 32, 33]. This construct though similar 
to previously described [21] is different in that the gene cluster was amplified from genomic 
DNA of Ss 53G form I and initiated from the conserved 5’ border of O-antigen clusters [35] 
(Figure 1B). We included the wzz ORF that was not previously expressed [21], because wzz 
expression facilitated uniform distribution of Ss-f1-Oag on Ty21a similar to that of native Ss 
(Figure S2). Our final vaccine strain, designated Ty21a-Ss, did not have the antibiotic resistance 
marker. Chromosomal integration and integrity of the Ss-f1-Oag gene cluster was confirmed by 
DNA sequencing and only 3 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified

in comparison to the published sequence pSs046 [35]. Sequencing of independently amplified 
PCR fragments from Ss 53G genomic DNA demonstrated these polymorphisms were present in 
Ss 53G; we believe they arose from natural variation between laboratory isolates. 
 
We hypothesized that expression of the AR genes in Ty21a would make a better vaccine. 
Because regulation of AR gene expression is not fully understood, we put these genes under the 
regulation of the arabinose-controlled promoter, Para, which responds quickly to the arabinose-
bound transcription factor, AraC, which activates robust gene transcription. We PCR-amplified 
Shigella ybaS and the gadBC coding sequences, fused and placed them under Para to create a 
polycistronic AraC-Para-YbaS-GadBC expression cassette. This cassette was integrated into the 
Ty21a chromosome to replace the tviE ORF. The resulting strain was then used for stable 
integration of the Ss-f1-Oag expression cassette using gadC and vexA as homologous sequences 
for recombination (Figure 1C) and the KanR marker evicted. The resulting final, marker-less, 
strain was designated Ty21a-AR-Ss. 
 
Cell surface expression  
We examined Ss-f1-Oag expression by Western blots (Figures 2A, 2B) and immunofluorescence 
assays (Figure 2C). Because the arabinose-controlled AR genes in Ty21a-AR-Ss are located 5’ to 
the Ss-f1-Oag gene cluster, we also examined form I O-antigen expression in the presence of 
0.75% arabinose in the culture medium, mimicking AR activating conditions. Ss-f1-Oag in Ss 53G 
is expressed as a ladder of two-sugar repeats that is LPS core-linked and a smear at higher

molecular weight, which is linked to group 4 capsule (Figure 2A). Ty21a did not and Ty21a-Ss 
did express Ss-f1-Oag (Figures 2A, 2C). As described [21, 36], most Ss-f1-Oag was expressed in 
the form that is capsule-linked in Ty21a-Ss. Ty21a-Ss expressed the Ss-f1-Oag uniformly on the 
cell surface, similar to the native form expressed on Ss 53G form I (Figure S2C(2)). Ty21a-AR-Ss 
expressed Ss-f1-Oag of similar levels and morphology to that from Ty21a-Ss regardless of 
presence of arabinose (Figure 2A, lanes 3, 4, and C (3, 4)). The expression levels of Salmonella 
groups O9, 12-antigen from Ty21a-Ss and Ty21a-AR-Ss strains were comparable to those of 
Ty21a (Figure 2B), the Ss and S. Typhi O-antigens co-existed on the cell surface (Figures 2C).  
 
Acid resistance 
To confirm the integrated AR genes expressed upon induction and were enzymatically active, 
we subjected Ty21a-AR-Ss to glutaminase and GAD assays [37] with slight modifications. Triton 
X-100 was omitted from the original GAD and glutaminase reagents. Therefore, only when a 
functional GadC transporter was present, could there be transportation of glutamine or 
glutamate into the cell for enzyme utilization. Bromocresol green was pH indicator. Ty21a and 
Ty21a-Ss were unable to utilize glutamine or glutamate to increase pH in the test reagent; the 
reactions remained yellow after incubation at 37oC for 30 min (Figure 3A, lanes 1, 2). Reactions 
containing Ty21a-AR-Ss grown in absence of arabinose turned slightly bluish-green, indicating a 
low level leaky expression of the AR enzymes (Figure 3A, lane 3). When grown in the presence 
of arabinose, Ty21a-AR-Ss turned the assay reagents strongly bluish-green, indicating robust

expression of enzymatically active AR genes (Figure 3A, lane 4); Ty21a-AR-Ss expressed 
functional AR genes in a transcriptionally controlled manner. 
 
We next tested the ability of Ty21a-AR-Ss to survive at pH 2.5. Because Salmonella needs acidic 
culture conditions to induce acid tolerance response, a prerequisite for AR [38], 1% trehalose 
was included for acid fermentation in addition to 0.75% arabinose. Bacterial strains were grown 
to stationary phase and cultures diluted 1:20 in acid medium at pH 2.5 in the presence of 1.5 
mM glutamine. Reactions were incubated at 37oC with agitation and viability examined at 
indicated time points (Figure 3B). Ss 53G form II maintained ~100% viability after 1 hr 
incubation at pH 2.5 (gray squares). In contrast, Ty21a survived poorly at this condition: viability 
was reduced by >102-fold at 15 min and >107-fold by 30 min (black circles). Cell viability was 
further reduced in Ty21a-Ss (blue triangles), with no viable colony recovered at 15 min, 
equivalent to a >108-fold reduction. Ty21a-AR, the parental strain for Ty21a-AR-Ss, maintained 
>50% viability at 30 min and ~10% at 45 min (red inverted triangles). Ty21a-AR-Ss maintained 
~50% viability at 30 min. However, viability quickly deteriorated, with ~1% at 45 min (closed 
green diamonds). Increasing glutamine concentration to 6 mM improved survival for Ty21a-AR-
Ss; cell survival at 45 min improved to ~50% (open green diamonds). Ty21a recovered from the 
acid exposure was slow-growing and lost expression of the Salmonella O-antigen, while Ty21a-
AR and Ty21a-AR-Ss maintained levels of O-antigen expression comparable to before acid 
exposure (Figure 3C). Expression of the concerted glutaminase-GAD AR systems improved acid 
resistance and cell viability of recombinant Ty21a strains.

Stability 
We generated genetic seedbanks for Ty21a-Ss and Ty21a-AR-Ss.  All microbiological, 
biochemical, immunological, genetic, and molecular properties were as expected (Figure 4A). 
Cells were grown under non-selective conditions for 200 generations. 100 colonies from each 
culture were subjected to colony immunoblot analysis for Ss-f1-Oag expression. All of 100 
colonies of Ty21a-Ss (Figure 4B) and Ty21a-AR-Ss (Figure 4C) tested retained Ss-f1-Oag 
expression, demonstrating 100% stability of the chromosomally integrated genes after 200 
generations of growth.  
 
Immunogenicity  
To assess if Ty21a-Ss and Ty21a-AR-Ss were immunogenic when administered via the mucosal 
route, we immunized four groups of 10 mice intranasally with 4 doses of 1  109 CFU Ty21a, 
Ty21a-Ss, Ty21a-AR-Ss (AR gene not expressed), and Ty21a-AR-Ss grown in the presence of 
trehalose and arabinose (AR genes activated; referred to as Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA) at 2-week 
intervals. Serum IgG antibody responses against Ss-f1-Oag at 2 weeks after doses 2, 3, and 4 
were assessed by ELISA. Results are reported as the geometric mean (GM) OD 1.0 (serum 
dilution at which the optical density was 1.0, Figure 5A). Mice immunized with Ty21a-Ss (blue 
symbols), Ty21a-AR-Ss (red symbols), and Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA (green symbols) produced higher 
serum IgG antibodies against Ss-f1-Oag than the Ty21a control (black symbols) or naïve mice 
(gray symbols), and antibodies increased with increased numbers of immunizations (p < 0.05 by

Wilcoxon Rank test). At 2 weeks after dose 4, the GM OD 1.0 to Ss-f1-Oag of mice immunized 
with Ty21a-Ss, Ty21a-AR-Ss, and Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA were 7,909.5 (range 2,560 – 21,700), 
7,202.4 (range 3,363 – 15,910), and 23,020.8 (range 8,521 – 71,575), respectively.  
 
We also assessed antibodies to Salmonella groups O 9, 12-antigens, the native O-antigens 
expressed on Ty21a surface that induce protective immunity against typhoid fever (Figure 5B). 
For mice immunized with Ty21a, the GM OD 1.0 of serum IgG antibodies to Salmonella O 9,12-
antigens were 53.9 (range 1 - 864), 54.5 (range 1 - 545), and 328.3 (range 72 - 2,295) at 2 weeks 
after doses 2, 3, 4, respectively. Ty21a-Ss, Ty21a-AR-Ss, and Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA induced anti-
Salmonella O 9, 12 -antigen serum IgG at comparable levels. At 2 weeks after dose 4, the GM 
OD 1.0 was 421.6 (range 98 – 1,241), 182.3 (range (74 – 1,030), and 426.8 (range 78 – 2,539) for 
Ty21a-Ss, Ty21a-AR-Ss, and Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA. Naïve mice had a GM OD 1.0 of 13.6 (range 1 - 
38).  
 
Protective efficacy  
We challenged the immunized mice six weeks after dose 4 with Ss 53G form I by intranasal 
instillation. Three of 9 control mice immunized with Ty21a survived the challenge, while 7/10, 
9/10, and 9/10 mice immunized with Ty21a-Ss, Ty21a-AR-Ss, and Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA respectively 
survived and remained healthy throughout the 14-day monitoring period (Figure 6). The 
protective efficacies were 55.2%, 85.1%, and 85.1% for Ty21a-Ss, Ty21a-AR-Ss, and Ty21a-AR-
Ss+ARA, respectively. For the two groups that received the Ty21a-AR-Ss constructs, the

difference between Ty21a control and immunized mice was significant (p = 0.02, Fishers Exact 
Test, 2-tailed).  
 
DISCUSSION 
Oral immunization with Ty21a expressing Ss-f1-Oag from a plasmid protected humans against 
Ss diarrhea and dysentery [18]. However, the plasmid-based construct was unstable with DNA 
rearrangements and deletions of plasmid material probably causing lot-to-lot variation [19]. 
Chromosomal integration using bacterial recombineering techniques addressed this issue [21]. 
Indeed, our recombinant vaccine strains maintained stable and robust expression of Ss-f1-Oag 
for a minimum of 200 generations (Figure 4B, 4C).  
 
Protection against typhoid fever by immunization with Ty21a was excellent when the vaccine 
was administered as a buffered liquid [13] and higher as compared to enteric coated capsules 
[16, 39]. This increased efficacy was probably due to more viable Ty21a making it through the 
acid environment of the stomach into the small intestine when administered in a buffered 
liquid. Conferring acid resistance to Ty21a should allow for even more viable bacteria reaching 
the small intestine leading to improved immunogenicity and protective efficacy at the same 
dose of Ty21a. Ty21a-AR-Ss maintained ~50% viability at pH 2.5 for 30-45 min in vitro. In 
comparison, viability of Ty21a was reduced by >102-fold at 15 min and >107-fold by 30 min. The 
half-life for gastric emptying time in humans is about 26-45 min [40, 41]. Importantly, co-
expression of the AR genes did not affect expression of Ss-f1-Oag and native Ty21a O-antigen in

vitro (Figure 2), or immunogenicity of the bacterial strain in vivo (Figures 5 and 6).  Ty21a 
quickly lost viability and O-antigen expression upon exposure to acid, while Ty21a-AR-Ss 
maintained the same levels of O-antigen expression (Figure 3C). Moreover, we observed slightly 
better antibody responses and higher protective efficacy in mice immunized with Ty21a-AR-Ss 
compared to Ty21a-Ss, especially when the AR genes were activated (Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA). This 
was probably because culture conditions for AR gene induction favored cell viability. Even 
though we immunized mice with similar amounts of bacterial cells (determined by OD600 nm), 
the viable counts for the Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA were always higher, but no more than 2-fold higher 
than that of the other three groups. By rendering Ty21a acid-resistant, we expect increased 
bioavailability, which should increase immunogenicity and protective efficacy.  
 
Humans become infected with S. Typhi by ingestion of the bacteria.  Ty21a is an orally 
administered vaccine. However, S. Typhi does not infect mice, making it difficult to assess 
immunization by oral administration.  Thus, testing immunogenicity and protective efficacy in 
mice after IP administration was undertaken [21]. This could be misleading. LPS is highly 
immunogenic when administered IP, but not when administered by mucosal routes [42]. 
Furthermore, deaths from IP inoculation of gram-negative bacteria are related to the toxic 
effects of endotoxin [43], which may be distinct from that of invasive Shigella infection in 
human intestinal epithelium. The route for immunization and challenge of a Ty21a-based 
vaccine is ideally oral. However, because Ty21a, S. Typhi, [44], and Shigella spp do not infect 
normal mice when administered orally, an intranasal route has been established in mice for the 
evaluation of mucosal immune responses to live attenuated bacterial vaccines [34, 45]. The

serum antibody responses in mice were about 10-fold lower using the intranasal as compared 
to the IP route (unpublished). Nevertheless, using this approach, we demonstrated that Ty21a-
Ss and Ty21a-AR-Ss stimulated antibodies against both Ss and Salmonella LPS. 
 
Most importantly, 9/10 mice immunized intranasally with Ty21a-AR-Ss or Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA 
vaccine as compared to 3/9 immunized with Ty21a alone survived a lethal intranasal infection 
with Ss 53G (protective efficacy for each was 85.1%).  
 
Ty21a protects for up to 7 years [12]. We expect similar protection with the typhoid-shigellosis 
combination vaccine. Ty21a can be foam-dried, providing for temperature stabilization and a 
potential shelf life of 5-10 years [46], which will facilitate storage and distribution. Most 
importantly, Ty21a is extremely safe. There is no report of bacteremia or Ty21a-assoicated 
post-vaccination reactive arthritis, a potential problem with other live attenuated vectors 
including non-typhoid Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia. We do not foresee safety concerns in 
regard to inclusion of the AR genes. The AR genes are present and functional in avirulent strains 
of E. coli and Shigella spp., such as Ss 53G form II (Figure 3B). Therefore, they are insufficient to 
cause disease on their own. The AR genes are stably integrated into the Ty21a genome and 
placed under an artificially inducible promoter. These properties make horizontal transfer to 
and gene activation in another bacterium extremely unlikely. Finally, except for the expression 
of the AR and Ss-f1-Oag transgenes, Ty21a-AR-Ss displays the microbiological, biochemical, 
immunological, and genetic properties of Ty21a (Figure 4), demonstrating that expression of

the AR genes has no effect on Ty21a attenuation. This finding is similar to a recently reported 
study with the GAD-GadC AR system, but not the glutaminase-GadC system we also included 
[31]. We cannot directly compare our results because the viability of the Ty21a control after 
acid challenge was lower in our experiments.  
 
The recent Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) field study of 1130 Shigella spp. concluded, 
“A quadrivalent vaccine with O-antigens from S. sonnei, S. flexneri 2a, S. flexneri 3a, and S. 
flexneri 6 can provide broad direct coverage against these most common serotypes and indirect 
coverage …through shared S. flexneri group antigens…” (up to 88% coverage) [2]. Our goal is to 
develop such a quadrivalent vaccine.   
 
However, Ss is responsible for 75% of all cases of shigellosis in the U.S. [4], and most cases in 
Israel [47], Thailand [48], and Southern Vietnam [49]. While developing the three other 
constructs for the quadrivalent vaccine, we plan to move forward in parallel to GMP 
manufacture of our acid-resistant Ty21-AR-Ss vaccine (TyOraSs). The next step will be to prove 
it is safe and immunogenic and protective against shigellosis and typhoid in humans.

antibody responses to extracted (A) S. sonnei LPS or (B) Ty21a LPS (Salmonella groups 9, 12 O-
antigens) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) OD 1.0. Data were 
collected using Softmax 5.0 and were fit to a 4-parameter logistic curve. Sera from 5 un-
immunized, naïve mice (gray) of the same age were also collected and measured as negative 
controls. Each point represents an individual mouse and the intensity of the point indicates 
whether the mouse was protected (dark) or unprotected (light) from a lethal S. sonnei 53G 
form I infection. The geometric mean for each group is indicated by a horizontal bar. 
Figure 6. Mice immunized with Ty21a-Ss vaccine strains were protected from lethal S. sonnei 
53G form I infection. All mice were challenged 6 weeks after vaccine dose 4 with a lethal 
infection of S. sonnei 53G form I by nasal instillation and monitored daily for 14 days. Each 
mouse was calculated to have received 1.2  109 CFU, corresponding to 24 50% lethal doses 
determined by pilot infection experiments with naïve mice. Only 3 out of 9 mice immunized 
with Ty21a survived, while 7 out of 10, 9 out of 10, and 9 out of 10 mice immunized with Ty21a 
expressing Ss-f1-Oag (Ty21a-Ss), Ty21a expressing Ss-f1-Oag but not the AR genes (Ty21a-AR-
Ss), and Ty21a expressing Ss-f1-Oag and AR genes (Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA). The difference in survival 
rates among all four groups was analyzed by Fishers Exact Test, 2-tailed (p = 0.021). The 
difference in survival rates for all immunized vs. controls was 25/30 vs. 3/9 (p = 0.0078), for 
Ty21a-AR-Ss or Ty21a-AR-Ss+ARA vs. Ty21a control was 9/10 vs. 3/9 (p=0.0198), and for Ty21a-
Ss vs. naïve control was 7/10 vs. 3/9 (p=0.1789).
