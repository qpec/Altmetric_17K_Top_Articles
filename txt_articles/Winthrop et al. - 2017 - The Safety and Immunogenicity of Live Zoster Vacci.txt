Objective. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
are at increased risk of herpes zoster, and vaccination is
recommended for patients ages 50 years and older, prior
to starting treatment with biologic agents or tofacitinib.
Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of
RA. We evaluated its effect on the immune response and
safety of live zoster vaccine (LZV).
Methods. In
this
phase
II,
14-week,
placebo-
controlled trial, patients ages 50 years and older who had
active RA and were receiving background methotrexate
were given LZV and randomized to receive tofacitinib 5 mg
twice daily or placebo 2–3 weeks postvaccination. We mea-
sured humoral responses (varicella zoster virus [VZV]–
specific IgG level as determined by glycoprotein enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay) and cell-mediated responses
(VZV-specific T cell enumeration, as determined by
enzyme-linked immunospot assay) at baseline and 2 weeks,
6 weeks, and 14 weeks postvaccination. End points in-
cluded the geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in VZV-
specific IgG levels (primary end point) and T cells (number
of spot-forming cells/106 peripheral blood mononuclear
cells) at 6 weeks postvaccination.
Results. One hundred twelve patients were ran-
domized to receive tofacitinib (n 5 55) or placebo (n 5
57). Six weeks postvaccination, the GMFR in VZV-
specific IgG levels was 2.11 in the tofacitinib group and
1.74 in the placebo group, and the VZV-specific T cell
GMFR was similar in the tofacitinib group and the pla-
cebo group (1.50 and 1.29, respectively). Serious adverse
events occurred in 3 patients in the tofacitinib group
(5.5%) and 0 patients (0.0%) in the placebo group. One
patient, who lacked preexisting VZV immunity, developed
cutaneous vaccine dissemination 2 days after starting
tofacitinib (16 days postvaccination). This resolved after
tofacitinib was discontinued and the patient received anti-
viral treatment.
Conclusion. Patients who began treatment with
tofacitinib 2–3 weeks after receiving LZV had VZV-
specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to
LZV similar to those in placebo-treated patients. Vaccina-
tion appeared to be safe in all of the patients except 1
patient who lacked preexisting VZV immunity.
Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is a common and
sometimes debilitating disease that disproportionately
affects elderly individuals and those who are immunocom-
promised (1). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
have a 1.5–2-fold higher risk of developing HZ compared
with healthy adults (2), and treatment with some disease-

 modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has been
shown to further increase this risk (3,4). Tofacitinib is an
oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of RA. The efficacy
and safety of tofacitinib at dosages of 5 mg twice daily and
10 mg twice daily, administered as monotherapy or in com-
bination with DMARDs, in patients with active RA have
been demonstrated in phase II, phase III, and long-term
extension (LTE) studies (5–13). Tofacitinib has been
shown to increase the risk of developing HZ, particularly
when it is given in combination with methotrexate (MTX)
or prednisone (14–16).
Given the preventable nature of HZ, the American
College of Rheumatology (ACR), the European League
Against Rheumatism (EULAR), and other committees,
such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP),
recommend
vaccinating
patients
with
RA
(1,17–19). Due to the live nature of the zoster vaccine, there
is a theoretical risk of dissemination in immunosuppressed
patients, and it is recommended that treatment with a bio-
logic agent or tofacitinib should not be started until 2–4
weeks after the vaccination (1,20). However, guidelines for
the timing of the vaccination relative to the start of immuno-
suppressive therapy are conflicting. According to the ACR
guidelines, RA patients ages $50 years should be vacci-
nated with the live zoster vaccine (LZV) at least 2 weeks
prior to starting therapy with a biologic agent or tofacitinib
(18,21). The 2011 EULAR guidelines suggest general
avoidance of this vaccine in immunosuppressed patients
but emphasize the potential importance of the vaccine and
the need to give it to those with positive findings on sero-
logic tests for varicella zoster virus in combination with tem-
porary cessation of immunosuppressive drug therapy (19).
The ACIP recommends administration of the vaccine to
persons ages $60 years, including those with chronic medi-
cal conditions such as RA (1).
Previous studies have shown that in immunocom-
petent individuals, the efficacy of LZV for protection
against HZ was 51% in those ages $60 years over a
follow-up period of 4.9 years and 70% in those ages 50–59
years over a follow-up period of 1.3 years (17). Despite the
higher risk of HZ in patients with RA, there has been no
large interventional clinical study of LZV in the setting of
RA. The immunogenicity and safety of LZV in patients
receiving DMARDs (including tofacitinib) are unknown.
Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the safety and immuno-
genicity of LZV in a group of patients with RA, prior to
starting tofacitinib therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We enrolled patients with active RA who were receiving
stable background doses of MTX into a phase II, 14-week,
randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled trial
(study A3921237; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02147587).
Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive tofacitinib at a dosage
of 5 mg twice daily or placebo 2–3 weeks after vaccination with
LZV, to specifically assess the effect of tofacitinib 5 mg twice
daily on the safety and immunogenicity of LZV. The study was
conducted at 27 centers across the US, between June 2014 and
July 2015 (see Supplementary Information, available on the
Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.
com/doi/10.1002/art.40187/abstract). RA patients ages 50 years
and older were eligible if they had at least 4 tender/painful joints
and $4 swollen joints (28 assessed) at the time of screening or at
baseline (before vaccination), and a C-reactive protein level of
.3 mg/liter or a Clinical Disease Activity Index (22) score of .10
at the time of screening or at baseline. Patients were enrolled if
they met the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for an RA score of $6
(23). Prior to screening, patients must have received continuous
treatment with MTX at a dosage of 15–25 mg/week for at least 4
months. Exclusion criteria were any of the following: recent his-
tory of serious infection (within 6 months), recent infection
requiring treatment (within 2 weeks), active hepatitis B or hepati-
tis C virus infection, untreated latent tuberculosis, any history of
malignancy (except nonmelanoma or squamous cell skin cancer
or cervical carcinoma in situ), a history of recurrent (.1 episode)
or disseminated HZ, prior exposure to LZV, or a history of any
other vaccination in the past 6 weeks (see inclusion/exclusion
criteria, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40187/abstract).
Study conduct.
Eligible patients were vaccinated and
then randomized (1:1) to receive either tofacitinib 5 mg twice
daily or placebo, initiated 2–3 weeks postvaccination (see Supple-
mentary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web
site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40187/abstract).
Patients continued to receive their current dose of MTX. Concomi-
tant treatment with prednisone or equivalent at a dosage of
#10 mg/day was allowed. A history of varicella was not investigated,
and patients were not screened for VZV antibodies. RA disease
activity was measured only at baseline, prior to vaccination. Other
demographic, comorbidity, and other clinical data for the partici-
pants were collected at baseline. The study concluded after 12
weeks of treatment with tofacitinib or placebo (14 weeks postvacci-
nation), and the patients were given the option of joining a separate
LTE study at that time (see Supplementary Figure 2, available on
the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.
com/doi/10.1002/art.40187/abstract). These studies were approved
by the institutional review board and/or independent ethics
committee at each center and were carried out in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all Inter-
national Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice
guidelines.
Immunogenicity analyses. We evaluated both humoral
and cell-mediated responses at baseline (just prior to vaccination)
and at 2, 6, and 14 weeks after vaccination (day 1, week 4, and
week 12 of treatment with tofacitinib or placebo). Measures
included VZV-specific IgG levels, as determined by purified gly-
coprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA), and
VZV-specific T cell responses, as determined by enumeration of
interferon-g (IFNg) spot-forming cells (SFCs) using an enzyme-
linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay.
The primary end point of the trial was the geometric
mean fold rise (GMFR) in VZV-specific IgG levels at 6 weeks
postvaccination. Secondary and additional end points included
1970
WINTHROP ET AL
 the proportion of patients achieving a $1.5-fold increase in
VZV-specific IgG levels, the absolute VZV-specific IgG levels,
the absolute numbers of VZV-specific reactive T cells, and the
GMFR in VZV-specific reactive T cells between baseline and 2,
6, and 14 weeks postvaccination.
For gpELISA measures, we used a validated assay (PPD
Vaccines and Biologics) used for licensure of Zostavax and widely
used in research settings. For gpELISA output, the geometric
mean titer was defined as the geometric mean of 3 independent
assay measurements of each blood sample.
ELISpot results were obtained using an assay qualified to
quantify the number of IFNg-secreting cells (performed at the
Pfizer Inc Vaccine Research Unit, Pearl River, NY). Four hun-
dred thousand peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) iso-
lated from whole blood samples obtained from the patients were
plated on 96-well plates in triplicate. After a mean6 SD of
186 2 hours of incubation (378C in 5% CO2) with processed
VZV from Oka vaccine strain, reactive T lymphocytes were enu-
merated. The number of SFCs/106 PBMCs was recorded (24).
Safety assessments. The safety end points were evalu-
ated for 12 weeks after randomization and included adverse
events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), clinically significant labora-
tory abnormalities, vaccine-related AEs (including injection-site
reactions and HZ-like lesions), and clinical HZ events. Patients
who developed rashes during this time period were instructed to
be seen by their study physician, and a biopsy specimen of the
involved skin was to be obtained if the rash was clinically sugges-
tive of VZV infection. For any patients needing a biopsy, speci-
mens were to be transferred in viral transport media and then
sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
for VZV testing. Real-time F€
orster Resonance Energy Transfer–
based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using a
LightCycler platform was performed to target different vaccine-
associated single-nucleotide markers in the VZV genome. If
VZV infection was identified, samples were tested for markers in
open-reading frame 38 (ORF 38) and ORF 54 (to discriminate
the Oka vaccine strain from other wild-type strains) and for 2
vaccine strain–specific markers in ORF 62, to confirm VZV
infection and to robustly discriminate the vaccine strain from
wild-type strains.
Sample size determination.
The number of patients
(up to ;70 in each treatment group) was selected based on a lit-
erature review and clinical considerations (25). Specifically, for
the primary end point of fold increase from baseline in VZV-
specific IgG antibodies at 6 weeks postvaccination (week 4 of
treatment with the study drug), assuming a common SD of 1.33
on the logarithmic scale (;3.8-fold on the original scale), a sam-
ple size of up to 70 patients in each group would yield a halfwidth
of ;0.288 on the logarithmic scale for a 2-sided 80% confidence
interval (80% CI) of the ratio of the GMFRs between the
tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily group and the placebo group
(tofacitinib/placebo), ensuring that the GMFR is estimated with
reasonable precision.
Statistical analysis.
The final analysis included only
patients who were deemed “evaluable” and had a complete set of
assay results for gpELISA at both baseline and 6 weeks postvacci-
nation, had started the study drug according to the protocol 2–3
weeks postvaccination, and had been $80% compliant with the
Table 1.

 study drug until 6 weeks postvaccination. The study was not de-
signed to test any statistical hypotheses; therefore, all compari-
sons described herein are based on the observed magnitudes of
the estimates only. For the primary outcome in this group, we
compared measures at baseline with those obtained at week 6
postvaccination. We calculated an adjusted estimation of the
GMFR ratios (tofacitinib/placebo) using a linear mixed model
(analysis of covariance) with repeated measures that included
age, sex, randomization stratum (biologic agent–naive versus
prior biologic nonresponder) and baseline value as covariates,
and study treatment, visit after vaccination, and treatment-by-visit
interaction as fixed effects. The GMFR ratios (tofacitinib/
placebo) from baseline were computed. The 2-sided 80% CI of
this ratio was obtained from this model (back-transformation).
Additionally, the primary end point was analyzed using
descriptive methods (GMFR, geometric SD, minimum, and max-
imum, according to treatment group and visit following vaccina-
tion). Two-sided 80% CIs for the geometric mean constructed by
back-transformation of the CI for the mean of the logarithmically
transformed end point (computed using Student’s t-distribution)
were calculated.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the patients.
One
hundred twelve patients were randomized to receive pla-
cebo (n 5 57) or tofacitinib (n 5 55). Overall, patients in
both treatment groups were similar with regard to sex, age,
baseline disease activity, and baseline VZV immune
measures (Table 1). Among the 112 patients vaccinated
and subsequently randomized, 16 discontinued because of
AEs not related to the study drug (2 patients in the
tofacitinib group and 7 patients in the placebo group),
AEs related to the study drug (2 patients in the tofacitinib
group and 2 patients in the placebo group), or an insuffi-
cient clinical response (1 patient in the tofacitinib group
and 2 patients in the placebo group) (see Supplementary

site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40187/
abstract).
Immunogenicity. Most patients (53 [93%] of those
in the placebo group and 54 [98%] of those in the tofaciti-
nib group) were evaluable for the immune response end
points. Among these individuals, the GMFR for VZV-
specific IgG levels at 6 weeks postvaccination was simi-
lar between the tofacitinib-treated and placebo-treated
patients.
The mean VZV-specific IgG levels at 6 weeks post-
vaccination (4 weeks after treatment initiation) were
403.42 units/ml and 322.49 units/ml in tofacitinib-treated
and placebo-treated patients, respectively (Figure 1A),
and the GMFRs from baseline at this time point were 2.11
(80% CI 1.87–2.37) and 1.74 (80% CI 1.55–1.95), respec-
tively. VZV-specific IgG levels were also evaluated on day
1 (2 weeks postvaccination) and after 3 months (14 weeks

 postvaccination) of tofacitinib or placebo treatment. At all
postvaccination time points, there was a trend toward
numerically higher GMFRs in tofacitinib-treated patients
(Table 2), but the differences were small and not statisti-
cally significant. Furthermore, the proportion of patients
developing a $1.5-fold postvaccination increase in IgG
levels at 6 weeks postvaccination trended higher for those
receiving tofacitinib (57.4%) compared with those receiv-
ing placebo (43.4%) (Figure 1B). Similar results were
observed in a subpopulation of patients who were not
treated with corticosteroids and with data stratified
according to age (see Supplementary Table 1, available on
the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40187/abstract).
An ELISpot assay to enumerate VZV-specific
IFNg-secreting T cells was performed. For this cell-
mediated immune response, the absolute VZV-specific
reactive cell counts were 69.97 and 56.39 SFCs/106
PBMCs 6 weeks postvaccination in the tofacitinib group
and the placebo group, respectively (Figure 2). The
GMFR in VZV-specific T cell responses at 6 weeks was
similar in tofacitinib-treated patients (1.50; 80% CI

1.14–1.46) (Table 3). This increase was also similar at
weeks 2 and 14 postvaccination. The proportion of
patients developing a $1.5-fold postvaccination increase
in the T cell response was similar between groups at 6
weeks postvaccination (33.3% in the tofacitinib group
and 32.7% in the placebo group), as well as other post-
vaccination time points (Figure 2B). Similar results
were observed when we analyzed a subgroup of patients
who did not receive concomitant glucocorticoids (see
Supplementary Table 2, available on the Arthritis &
Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/art.40187/abstract).
Safety. One patient in the placebo group discon-
tinued treatment following abnormal results for the abso-
lute neutrophil count; other nonserious vaccine-related
AEs were identified in 7 patients in the tofacitinib group
and 5 patients in the placebo group (see Supplementary
Table 3, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40187/abstract).
These AEs included mild injection-site swelling, redness, or
itching.
SAEs occurred in 3 patients in the tofacitinib group
(5.5%) and 0 patients in the placebo group (0%). The 3
SAEs included 1 case each of cholangitis and bronchitis,
and 1 case of disseminated primary varicella. Onset of the
disseminated rash occurred 16 days postvaccination (2
days after starting tofacitinib), on the patient’s trunk (back
and abdomen) and right ipsilateral arm. The patient dis-
continued tofacitinib and was treated with antiviral
(valcyclovir) therapy for 7 days, and the rash resolved. She
was not hospitalized and continued to receive background
oral MTX (15 mg/week) and oral prednisone (4 mg/day)
for RA, as per prior and upon vaccination. Biopsy speci-
mens from both her abdomen and forearm showed mixed
deep granulomatous perivascular inflammation with fibri-
noid degeneration of vessel walls, which was morphologi-
cally compatible with VZV infection. Molecular testing in
the abdominal specimen showed PCR positivity for VZV
DNA, with subsequent genomic work-up at the CDC con-
firming that VZV was the Oka vaccine strain.
Subsequent evaluation of this patient’s baseline
blood specimens showed that she lacked preexisting immu-
nity to VZV. Unlike any other patient in the study, she
had no measurable VZV-specific T cell response and a
negative gpELISA titer at baseline (Table 4). Interestingly,
at 2 weeks after vaccination (and just prior to starting
tofacitinib treatment), this patient had no measurable

 response to vaccination, since the results of both the
gpELISA and ELISpot assay remained negative. After
developing
disseminated
vaccine-strain
varicella,
the
patient developed robust immunity, as evidenced by 6-
week postvaccination assessments in which the gpELISA
titer was 96.6 units/ml and the ELISpot count was 566
SFCs/106 PBMCs. Additional VZV-specific IgM and IgG
avidity testing also showed negative responses at baseline
and 2 weeks after zoster vaccination, followed by robust
responses at week 6. These findings are consistent with a
primary VZV infection.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly
assess the safety and immunogenicity of the LZV in
patients with RA. We observed that patients with active
RA developed robust immune responses to this vaccine,
and that starting tofacitinib treatment 2–3 weeks after vac-
cination had no negative impact on the established
immune response. Patients treated with tofacitinib had
similar or even numerically higher VZV-specific humoral
and cell-mediated immune responses to the vaccine com-
pared with placebo-treated patients. Importantly, although
our results suggest that the vaccine is safe for RA patients
with prior VZV exposure, they also indicate the potential
need to either screen for prior exposure before giving this
vaccine or waiting longer than 2–3 weeks before starting
immunosuppression with tofacitinib.
Patients with RA are known to respond less
robustly to certain vaccines (26,27). This is likely attribut-
able to disease activity as well as, potentially, DMARD
and corticosteroid use. LZV is currently contraindicated in
patients receiving high-dose steroids (.20 mg/day predni-
sone or equivalent) or MTX at a dosage of .25 mg/week.
Below these dosing thresholds, the vaccine is thought to be
safe and effective, although this recommendation has been
based on expert opinion in the absence of data (1). Impor-
tantly, the current study provides data for this recommen-
dation, because the vaccine appeared to be adequately
immunogenic as well as safe in patients receiving standard
doses of MTX and/or lower doses of steroids. Although we
did not enroll patients without RA in our study, for context
it is useful to compare the magnitude of response observed
in our study with that observed in studies in healthy indi-
viduals—the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) (28) and the
Zostavax Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) (29). The SPS
study enrolled more than 38,000 individuals ages $60
years, none of whom had RA. In the SPS Immunology
Substudy, 1,395 individuals were evaluated using the same
outcomes measures used in our study. They observed an
average increase in VZV-specific IgG levels (gpELISA
titer) between baseline and 6 weeks postvaccination of 1.7-
fold, and an ;2.0-fold increase was observed for the VZV-
specific ELISpot measures (1,24,28,29). In the ZEST
study, 2,269 healthy volunteers ages 50–59 years had a
VZV-specific IgG increase of 2.3 at 6 weeks postvaccina-
tion (25). This magnitude of IgG responses in immuno-
competent individuals was similar to what we observed.
Although the magnitude of cell-mediated responses was
slightly less than that observed in healthy individuals within
the ZEST study, it is possible that this could be attributable
to the older age of our study population, the impact of
RA, or the therapies being used for these patients.
Our study provides the first data regarding use of
LZV in patients with RA and suggests that these patients,
even those being treated with nonbiologic DMARDs at
the time of vaccination, are capable of mounting adequate
immune responses to this vaccine. Furthermore, our data
suggest that the use of tofacitinib following VZV vaccina-
tion in patients with RA did not negatively impact the vac-
cine immunogenicity or the time course of the immune
response to the vaccine. Interestingly, immune responses
in RA patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or
placebo were comparable with those expected in healthy
individuals (24,25). From a safety standpoint, our study
highlights the potential for vaccine dissemination in an
immunocompromised host. In the SPS trial, in which
.19,000 patients received the vaccine, no cases of local or
disseminated HZ with this vaccine strain occurred in the
first 42 days after vaccination (28). Although we observed
only 1 such case in a study of 112 patients, it is notable
given the lack of such cases in a study as large as SPS. The
SPS study did not check for preexisting VZV immunity
before administering the vaccine (similar to our study
design); however, it is highly likely that at least a handful
of such individuals were entered into the study but did not
develop vaccine dissemination. Interestingly, 100% of the
1,395 individuals analyzed in an immunology substudy had
serologic evidence of prior VZV exposure, suggesting that
the number of individuals lacking prior exposure within the
SPS study was likely small (25). Based on the SPS expe-
rience, the vaccine is licensed and approved for patients
ages 50 or older regardless of a history of VZV (30). In our
1 case of disseminated primary varicella, the patient devel-
oped an injection-site reaction the day she started receiving
tofacitinib and a disseminated rash on day 16 after vaccina-
tion, just 2 days after starting tofacitinib. It is known that
patients can have circulating virus for several weeks after
vaccination, and a small number of individuals may shed
virus in saliva for up to 4 weeks postvaccination (31). Given
this temporal sequence, it is possible that tofacitinib may
have played a role in vaccine dissemination. Because of this
potential for prolonged viremia, some time lag between

1975
 vaccination and the start of immunosupression makes the-
oretical sense, in order to further decrease the possibility of
dissemination. Current recommendations suggest that this
time lag should be 2–4 weeks (1,20), but our data would
suggest that 4 weeks might be preferable. Alternatively,
testing patients who do not recollect a history of chicken-
pox, to ensure prior exposure to VZV before vaccinating
them, would also potentially mitigate this risk. In this case,
our patient who lacked preexisting immunity would not
have been a candidate for LZV.
A limitation of the current study is that the long-
term effectiveness of the vaccine in RA patients was not
investigated. However, this point is being investigated in
the patients who joined an open-label LTE study of
tofacitinib. In addition, because this study was conducted
specifically to assess vaccine responses and not the efficacy
of tofacitinib, further RA disease activity measures were
not obtained. Last, our study was small in nature such that
our conclusions regarding the safety of this vaccine and in
RA patients in general are limited. Although only 1 case of
vaccine dissemination occurred, in a patient lacking preex-
isting immunity, it is possible that other such cases could
occur in the RA setting. Larger studies should be con-
ducted to better understand the risk of this complication in
RA patients in general.
In summary, we have conducted the first clinical
study evaluating the use of LZV in patients with RA who
are receiving nonbiologic DMARDs. In accordance with
guidelines, our patients were vaccinated 2–3 weeks prior to
starting tofacitinib therapy. Importantly, our data suggest
that starting tofacitinib according to these guidelines does
not hinder the immunogenicity of this vaccine, and that
these patients were able to mount humoral and cell-
mediated responses similar to those seen in other studies
in healthy volunteers who do not have RA.
From a safety standpoint, the single event of dis-
seminated shingles vaccine (Oka) virus in a patient without
prior immunity suggests that patients should be screened
for prior immunity (i.e., by eliciting a history of chickenpox
or testing with commercially available VZV serologic tests)
before receiving this vaccine, or that the time periods
between vaccination and initiation of tofacitinib treatment
should be longer (e.g., 4 weeks). Further research is neces-
sary to understand the risk of this complication as well as
the long-term effectiveness of this LZV to prevent HZ in
this high-risk population.
