SUMMARY
The recent association of Zika virus with cases of
microcephaly has sparked a global health crisis and
highlighted the need for mechanisms to combat the
Zika vector, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia
pipientis, a bacterial endosymbiont of insect, has
recently garnered attention as a mechanism for arbo-
virus control. Here we report that Aedes aegypti
harboring Wolbachia are highly resistant to infection
with two currently circulating Zika virus isolates from
the recent Brazilian epidemic. Wolbachia-harboring
mosquitoes displayed lower viral prevalence and in-
tensity and decreased disseminated infection and,
critically, did not carry infectious virus in the saliva,
suggesting that viral transmission was blocked. Our
data indicate that the use of Wolbachia-harboring
mosquitoes could represent an effective mechanism
to reduce Zika virus transmission and should be
included as part of Zika control strategies.
The mosquito Aedes aegypti, typically linked with dengue (Flavi-
viridae) (Kyle and Harris, 2008) and chikungunya (Togaviridae)
(Morrison, 2014) transmission, is also associated with the alarm-
ing spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) (Flaviviridae), a previously obscure
arbovirus that has recently gone global (Enserink, 2015). Since
2007, ZIKV infection has been reported in 39 countries world-
wide (Martı
´nez de Salazar et al., 2016), including Brazil, where
infection was first linked to cases of microcephaly during a large
outbreak in 2015 (Mlakar et al., 2016; Oliveira Melo et al., 2016).
Combined with the implication of the virus in cases of the auto-
immune disorder Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (Araujo et al., 2016),
ZIKV has ballooned into a public health crisis.
In the absence of a vaccine, current effective control options are
limited to reducing the abundance of mosquito vector populations
(Heintze et al., 2007). However, there is a clear need for novel effi-
cacious approaches, given that existing strategies such as insec-
ticides (Maciel-de-Freitas et al., 2014) and larval biological control
(Vu et al., 2005) have proven unsustainable and ineffective at
halting disease spread (Kyle and Harris, 2008).
After decades of being proposed as a potential means of
vector control, the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, pre-
sent in an estimated 40% of all known terrestrial insect species
(Zug and Hammerstein, 2012), is currently being utilized around
the world as part of an innovative approach to control the
transmission of dengue (http://www.eliminatedengue.com) and
other pathogens (Bourtzis et al., 2014). This is possible because
the reproductive parasitism associated with Wolbachia infection,
typified by cytoplasmic incompatibility (Werren et al., 2008),
gives the bacterium the ability to quickly and stably invade
host populations (Hoffmann et al., 2011). Critically, the bacterium
also blocks the transmission of many important human patho-
gens in mosquitoes, including Plasmodium and chikungunya
(Bian et al., 2013; Caragata et al., 2016; Moreira et al., 2009), giv-
ing it great utility as a control agent.
As many different strains of the bacterium cause this inhibition,
we hypothesized that the wMel Wolbachia strain (wMel_Br),
currently being utilized as part of dengue control efforts in Brazil,
might be able to restrict ZIKV infection and transmission in
Ae. aegypti. To that end, we performed experimental infections
with two currently circulating ZIKV isolates and used a qRT-
PCR-based assay to a quantify ZIKV levels in mosquito tissues
and saliva, in order to assess whether Wolbachia could poten-
tially be used to combat the emerging Zika pandemic.
Through experimental infection and transmission assays using
two currently circulating Brazilian ZIKV isolates (BRPE243/2015
[BRPE] and SPH/2015 [SPH]) (Faria et al., 2016), we compared
ZIKV infection in wMel-infected mosquitoes (wMel_Br) with
Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes collected in Urca, Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil in early 2016 (Br). Due to the regular introduction
of F1 Br males (the eggs of field-collected Br mosquitoes) in
wMel_Br colony cages over 2 years, both lines had a similar ge-
netic background (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
The ZIKVs were isolated in the field in late 2015 and maintained
in cell culture, and viral titers were quantified via plaque-forming
assay prior to experimental infection (Table 1). In two separate
experiments, fresh ZIKV-infected supernatant was harvested
from culture, mixed with human blood, and used to orally infect
wMel_Br and Br mosquitoes. ZIKV levels were quantified in mos-
quito heads/thoraces and in abdomens at 7 and 14 days post-
infection (dpi) using a TaqMan-based qRT-PCR assay (Figure 1).
The prevalence of ZIKV infection was significantly reduced
among Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes (Table 1, analysis via
Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001 unless stated). For the BRPE
isolate (Figure 1A), Wolbachia decreased ZIKV prevalence by
35% in abdomens, although there was no significant difference

 for this tissue (p > 0.05), by 100% in head/thoraces at 7 dpi, and
by 65% and 90% at 14 dpi, respectively. For the SPH isolate
(Figure 1B), Wolbachia reduced prevalence by 95% and 67%
in head/thoraces and abdomens (p = 0.0002), respectively, at
7 dpi, and by 74% and 68% in head/thoraces and abdomens,
respectively, at 14 dpi.
Likewise, the intensity of ZIKV infection was greatly reduced
in wMel_Br mosquitoes for both tissues and time points
(Mann-Whitney U tests, p < 0.0001). Additionally, we observed
that median ZIKV titers in the head/thoraces of Br mosquitoes
increased over time for both isolates (Mann-Whitney U test;
BRPE, p < 0.0001; SPH, p = 0.0094), while there was no such
effect in wMel_Br mosquitoes.
Saliva was collected from Br and wMel_Br mosquitoes at
14 dpi, after the 5- to 10-day ZIKV extrinsic incubation period
was likely completed (Li et al., 2012), in order to determine if
Wolbachia infection also inhibited ZIKV transmission (Figure 1C).
We used mosquitoes infected with the BRPE isolate as it had
a higher titer in culture (Table 1). ZIKV levels were quantified
directly for individual saliva samples using the same qRT-PCR
assay. We observed that Wolbachia infection reduced ZIKV
prevalence in individual saliva samples by 55% (Fisher’s exact
test, p < 0.0001) and median ZIKV copies by approximately 5
logs (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.0001).
To determine if the virus in these samples was infectious, a
further ten wMel_Br and ten Br saliva samples, from the samples
described above, were intrathoracically injected into 8–14 naive
Br mosquitoes each (Figure 1D), using a previously described
method (Ferguson et al., 2015). The overall mortality rate among
injected mosquitoes was 11.93%. The presence or absence of
ZIKV infection was determined at 5 dpi in eight mosquitoes
injected with each saliva, amounting to a mean proportion
sampled of 0.68. Of the 80 mosquitoes injected with Br saliva,
68 (85%) became infected with ZIKV, with all Br saliva samples
producing at least one infected mosquito. In contrast, none of
the 80 mosquitoes injected with wMel_Br saliva became infected
(Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001; odds ratio 882.3, 95% CI, 51.3–
15187), indicating that while some of the wMel_Br saliva samples
did contain detectable ZIKV, we saw no evidence that the saliva
contained infectious virus.
There is a clear correlation between the inhibition of pathogens
by Wolbachia and bacterial density in insect tissues (Joubert
et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2014). In order to determine if there
was a link between Wolbachia density and ZIKV prevalence
and intensity, we measured total Wolbachia RNA levels in the
wMel_Br mosquitoes used in the ZIKV infection assays, using
qRT-PCR as described above. We saw that ZIKV infection ex-
plained less than 5% of the variance in Wolbachia density that
was observed between ZIKV-infected and -uninfected wMel_Br
mosquitoes at either 7 dpi or 14 dpi and was not a significant
predictor (PERMANOVA; p > 0.05). Furthermore, we observed
no relationship between Wolbachia density and ZIKV load
among wMel_Br mosquitoes that became infected with the virus
(Spearman correlation; heads/thoraces, r = 0.5952, p = 0.1323;
abdomens, r = �0.01891, p = 0.9210). This suggests that there
may not be a direct link between Wolbachia density in individual
mosquitoes and ZIKV infection, indicating that the inhibition of
ZIKV may arise through other means, indirectly due to the pres-
ence of the bacterium (Caragata et al., 2013; Moreira et al., 2009;
Pan et al., 2012; Rance
` s et al., 2012).
Our results indicate that the ability of Wolbachia infection to
greatly reduce the capacity of mosquitoes to harbor and transmit
a range of medically important pathogens, including the dengue
and chikungunya viruses (Caragata et al., 2016; Moreira et al.,
2009; Walker et al., 2011) also extends to ZIKV. While wMel did
not completely inhibit ZIKV infection, we observed a similar
decrease in prevalence and intensity of infection to that of wMel-
infected Ae. aegypti challenged with viremic blood from dengue
patients, which was considered sufficient to drastically decrease
viral transmission (Ferguson et al., 2015). Additionally, the fact
that we did not observe an increasein disseminated ZIKV infection
over time, and that ZIKV prevalence and infectivity in wMel_Br
mosquito saliva was significantly decreased, may indicate that,
as for dengue, wMel extends the ZIKV extrinsic incubation period
(Ye et al., 2015). This in turn would likely further decrease overall
ZIKVtransmissionrates,giventhesmalldecreaseinlifespanasso-
ciated with wMel infection (Walker et al., 2011).
We observed that the wMel Wolbachia infection in Ae. aegypti
greatly inhibited ZIKV infection in mosquito abdomens, and it
reduced disseminated infection in heads and thoraces and
ZIKV prevalence in mosquito saliva. Most critically, our results
suggest that saliva from wMel-infected mosquitoes did not
contain infectious virus. That this inhibition occurred for two
ZIKV isolates that circulated in Brazil during the 2015 epidemic,
and for mosquitoes with a wild-type genetic background, sug-
gests that wMel could greatly reduce ZIKV transmission in field
populations of Ae. aegypti, which in turn would likely reduce
the frequency of Zika-associated pathology in humans.
Wolbachia can invade and persist in wild mosquito popu-
lations (Hoffmann et al., 2014) and represents a relatively

have been reported and has recently been recommended
by
the

required
before

er, the results presented here indicate that wMel-infected Ae.
aegypti represent a realistic and effective option to combat
the ZIKV burden in Brazil and potentially in other countries
and should be considered as an integral part of future con-
trol efforts.

(A–C) Wolbachia-infected (green circles) and -uninfected (black circles) mosquitoes were orally challenged with either (A) the BRPE or (B) the SPH ZIKV isolates.
Wolbachia infection reduced both prevalence and intensity of ZIKV infection in mosquito heads/thoraces and abdomens at 7 and 14 dpi. Saliva was then
collected for mosquitoes infected with the BRPE ZIKV isolate at 14 dpi infection (C), and we observed that saliva from Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes had a
significantly lower rate of saliva infection and median viral load.
(D) When these saliva samples were injected into ZIKV-uninfected Br mosquitoes, all of the Br saliva samples contained infectious virus, while no wMel_Br saliva
produced a subsequent infection (columns: black, percentage infected; white, percentage uninfected; +, saliva contained infectious virus, �, saliva did not
contain infectious virus). Absolute ZIKV copy numbers were quantified via qRT-PCR.
