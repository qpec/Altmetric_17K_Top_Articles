Abstract
Background: The high economic burden of cancer is projected to continue growing. Cost-of-care estimates are key inputs for comparative 
effectiveness and economic analyses that aim to inform policies associated with cancer care. Existing estimates are based largely on SEER-
Medicare data in the elderly, leaving a knowledge gap regarding costs for patients aged <65 years. Methods: We estimated total and net 
medical care costs using data on individuals diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer (n=45,522) and noncancer controls 
(n=314,887) enrolled in 1 of 4 participating health plans. Net costs were defined as the difference in mean total costs between patients with 
cancer and controls. The phase-of-care approach and Kaplan-Meier Sample Average method were used to estimate mean total and net 1- 
and 5-year costs (in 2015 US dollars) by cancer site, stage at diagnosis, and age group (<65 and ≥65 years). Results: Total and net costs were 
consistently highest for lung cancer and lowest for prostate cancer. Net costs were higher across all cancer sites for patients aged <65 years 
than those aged ≥65 years. Medical care costs for all cancers increased with advanced stage at diagnosis. Conclusions: This study improves 
understanding of medical care costs for the 4 most common invasive cancers in the United States. Higher costs among patients aged <65 
years highlight limitations of relying on SEER-Medicare data alone to understand the national burden of cancer, whereas higher costs for 
patients with advanced-stage cancer underscore the importance of early detection to curtail high long-term costs. These cost estimates can 
be used in the development and evaluation of interventions and policies across the cancer care continuum.

Background
Cancer is the second most costly disease in the United 
States1 and accounts for 5% to 11% of the annual total 
healthcare budget.2,3 Due to the rising prices and in-
creased use of treatments, the costs of cancer care are in-
creasing faster than the those for other diseases,4,5 with a 
projected growth of 27% between 2010 and 2020 based 
on increased prevalence alone.6 When increasing costs 
of treatment are considered, projected growth may be

specific cancer interventions at the patient level to 
support informed decision-making. 
Previous studies have used the nationally repre-
sentative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 
to estimate annual healthcare spending among can-
cer survivors in the United States.8–12 However, such 
studies based on household surveys include mainly 
longer-term cancer survivors and have a limited 
sample of individuals with poor-prognosis cancers,13 
likely understating spending for this group. In addi-
tion, information on disease stage at diagnosis and 
date of death (where applicable)—factors known to 
be associated with medical care costs—are not avail-
able in the MEPS. All of these factors are important 
components for estimates used in modeling the cost-
effectiveness of cancer control programs and inter-
ventions, including those for prevention, early de-
tection, treatment, and end-of-life (EOL) care.
Cancer registry–based estimates of cancer costs 
have relied primarily on the linked SEER-Medicare 
claims data and are usually limited to the costs of 
beneficiaries aged ≥65 years.6,14–22 Cancer treatment 
has been reported to be more aggressive in young-
er patients aged <65 years,23–25 who represent near-
ly half of all new diagnoses.26 Earlier registry-based 
studies of the cost of cancer care in integrated health 
systems found that, when compared with similar in-
dividuals without a cancer history, net costs in the 
population diagnosed at age <65 years were higher 
compared with costs among the elderly.27 Howev-
er these studies were based on data from the early 
1990s, and treatment patterns have since changed 
substantially. 
In this study, we used recent data to estimate 
the medical care costs of the 4 most commonly di-
agnosed invasive cancers in the United States—
breast, colorectal (CRC), lung, and prostate can-
cers—among individuals aged <65 and ≥65 years 
enrolled in 4 health plans affiliated with large, inte-
grated health systems. The purpose of this study was 
to address a significant knowledge gap7 by expanding 
the empirical base of medical care cost estimates for 
patients diagnosed with cancer at age ≥18 years in 
the United States, using a validated costing frame-
work.14–16 Such cost estimates are important inputs 
for economic analyses, comparative effectiveness 
studies, and tools such as the NCI’s Cancer Inter-
vention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CIS-
NET) that aim to guide public health research and 
priorities, and which can aid in the development of 
optimal cancer control strategies.
Methods
Research Setting
This study was conducted within 4 health plans 
that are members of the Cancer Research Network 
(CRN)28,29: Group Health Cooperative (Seattle, 
WA), Henry Ford Health System (Detroit, MI), Kai-
ser Permanente Colorado (Denver, CO), and Kai-
ser Permanente Northwest (Portland, OR). Each 
organization has a tumor registry and an integrated 
electronic health record (EHR) database. These 
plans provide both private and public health insur-
ance coverage, including Medicare Advantage and 
Medicaid risk contracts. The Institutional Review 
Boards of the participating organizations approved 
all aspects of the project. The research setting, study 
design, and study population are described in more 
detail elsewhere.30,31
Study Population
The study population consisted of adults aged ≥18 
years diagnosed with de novo (tumor sequence 
00 or 01) breast, CRC, lung, or prostate cancer 
(n=45,522), and frequency-matched controls with-
out a cancer history (5:1 ratio to patients with cancer 
by 5-year age group, sex, and health plan eligibility; 
n=314,887) who were enrolled in one of the par-
ticipating health plans. Eligible patients were those 
diagnosed between January 1, 1988, and December 
31, 2007, and who had at least 30 days of continuous 
health plan eligibility during the study period (Janu-
ary 1, 2000, through December 31, 2008). Controls 
were assigned a pseudo-diagnosis date based on their 
matched patient with cancer and had at least 30 days 
of continuous health plan eligibility during the study 
period. All participants were followed until date of 
death, disenrollment from health plan, or end of the 
observation (December 31, 2008).
Data
Data on patients with cancer were extracted from 
the accredited tumor registries of each participat-
ing health plan, including age at diagnosis, AJCC 
stage at diagnosis, calendar year of diagnosis, and tu-
mor site. Race/ethnicity, sex, and vital status were 
extracted from health plan enrollment files, as were

cause of death and month and year of death for pa-
tients with cancer and controls who died within the 
study period. The Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index 
and health plan eligibility data were extracted from 
diagnosis and enrollment files, respectively.
Utilization data were extracted for all patients 
with cancer and controls between January 1, 2000, 
and December 31, 2008, from electronic data ware-
houses maintained by the health plans. The data 
warehouses compile information from EHRs; hospi-
tal discharge abstracts; claims; hospital, emergency 
room, same-day surgical, and medical office ambu-
latory care encounters; and outpatient dispensings. 
All participants, including Medicare Advantage 
enrollees, had coverage for ambulatory prescription 
medications. Data were standardized across the par-
ticipating health plans according to specifications 
established by the CRN’s Virtual Data Warehouse 
(VDW).32
Phase-of-Care Approach
The phase-of-care approach6,14–17 was used to assign 
medical care costs to distinct, clinically relevant 
phases on the basis of date of service in relation to 
cancer diagnosis and death: initial phase (first 12 
months following diagnosis); EOL phase (final 12 
months of life); and continuing phase (all months 
between the initial and EOL phases).16 Phases of care 
were defined based on previous studies of direct med-
ical care costs.14,15,27,33 To further distinguish costs as-
sociated with cancer care during EOL, patients with 
cancer were stratified by cause of death (ie, cancer 
vs all other). Cost estimates were based on all medi-
cal care received by patients during the periods for 
which they were enrolled in the health plan over 
the study observation period; accordingly, not all 
patients contributed to all phases of care.34 Among 
patients who survived <30 months, application of 
the phase-of-care approach allocates the utilization 
and costs of care to the EOL phase first (12 months), 
followed by the initial phase (12 months), then the 
continuing phase (≤5 months).16,17 For example, a 
patient with breast cancer who died 17 months af-
ter diagnosis would contribute the final 12 months 
to the EOL phase and the first 5 months to the ini-
tial phase, with no contribution to the continuing 
phase. In this study, patients diagnosed before Janu-
ary 1, 1999 (1 year prior the start of the study pe-
riod), and who died in 2006 contributed months and 
costs of care to the continuing phase and the EOL 
phases only, because the utilization and costs of care 
for their initial phase were outside of the study obser-
vation period (see supplemental eFigure 1, available 
with this article at JNCCN.org).
Because control patients did not have a date of 
cancer diagnosis, they were assigned a pseudo-diag-
nosis date that corresponded to the date of diagno-
sis for their matched patient with cancer. Months of 
observation and costs of care were assigned to phases 
of care in the same manner used with patients with 
cancer.
The use of a control patient creates a counter-
factual cohort of individuals without the disease of 
interest (ie, cancer) so as to estimate the incremen-
tal cancer-specific costs of medical care. This case-
control approach for estimating cancer-specific costs 
is commonly accepted as a method for estimating the 
difference in costs of providing medical care for a pa-
tient with cancer versus providing medical care for a 
similar patient who does not have cancer.34
Cost Estimates
Medical care costs were estimated using the standard-
ized relative resource cost algorithm (SRRCA).31 
The SRRCA transforms encounter-level utilization 
data into nominal cost estimates that are consistent 
with, and generalizable to, 15 payment systems used 
by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
(CMS) to reimburse providers for covered services. 
The SRRCA adapts these payment systems into 12 
different costing modules from the VDW utilization 
data associated with each of the following medical 
care categories: inpatient stays/days, same-day surgi-
cal procedures, outpatient visits, hospital ambula-
tory, pharmacy, hospice, home healthcare, skilled 
nursing facility, durable medical equipment, dialysis, 
telephone and email encounters, and other insti-
tutional services. Total monthly medical care costs 
were defined as the sum of standardized costs for all 
medical care categories. Mean total monthly esti-
mates of cost of care were calculated for each cancer 
site (and controls) and each phase of care. 
The mean net monthly cost (medical care costs 
associated with the cancer diagnosis), by phase of 
care, was defined as the difference in mean total 
monthly costs of care for patients with cancer versus 
control patients. Costs were reported in 2015 dol-
lars, adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price

Index for Medical Care (base year of 2008), and dis-
counted at 3% annually.
Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier Sample Average (KMSA) meth-
od19 was used to generate cost estimates by combin-
ing cancer site–specific and phase-specific mean 
monthly costs with monthly survival probability 
estimates from SEER cancer cases diagnosed from 
1988 through 2008 (SEER 9)35 (see supplemental 
eFigure 2). Mean total and net long-term costs were 
calculated as described by Yabroff et al,36 with net 
costs defined as the difference in mean total costs 
between patients and controls. Mean total and net 
1- and 5-year costs were estimated, stratified by can-
cer site, stage, and age group (<65 and ≥65 years). 
We chose the durations of 1 and 5 years for cost 
estimates to reflect recent survival patterns and to 
make estimates comparable across the 18 tumor sites 
evaluated separately in this analysis. We used the age 
threshold of 65 years to create analytic subgroups be-
cause of the significance for Medicare age-eligibility, 
as well as to enable comparisons of our cost estimates 
with analyses that use the SEER-Medicare database. 
We did not break the <65 age group into substrata 
due to sample size and power limitations. A plausible 
range for cost estimates was calculated based on the 
upper and lower 95% CI for phase-specific costs (see 
supplemental eTable 1), as previously described.36
Results
Sample Characteristics
Patients with breast cancer represented the largest 
group (n=17,230), followed by prostate (n=13,584), 
CRC (n=7,895), and lung cancers (n=6,813). As 
shown in Table 1, most patients with CRC (59.0%), 
lung (64.0%), and prostate (57.7%) cancer were aged 
≥65 years at diagnosis, compared with only 35.9% of 
patients with breast cancer. Across all cancers, non-
Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group. 
Patients diagnosed with stage I or II cancers consti-
tuted most breast (91%), CRC (62%), and prostate 
(83%) groups, whereas 68% of patients with lung 
cancer were diagnosed with stage III or IV disease. 
Median survival time was largest for patients with 
prostate cancer (199.9 months), followed by those 
with breast (177.9 months), CRC (79.8 months), 
and lung cancer (18.5 months).
Costs by Cancer Site and Stage at Diagnosis
Mean total and net monthly costs are presented by 
cancer site, stage, age group, and phase of care in 
Table 2. Across the 4 cancer sites, total and net costs 
were highest in the initial and EOL phases. Medical 
care costs were generally highest for lung cancer and 
lowest for prostate cancer.
Mean total 1-year costs for lung cancer ranged 
from $50,700 (stage I) to $97,400 (stage IV) among 
patients aged <65 years and from $44,000 (stage 
I) to $71,200 (stage IV) among patients aged ≥65 
years (Table 3). Mean total and net 1-year costs for 
CRC were highest, across cancers, among patients 
aged ≥65 years with stage IV disease ($74,500 and 
$65,500, respectively). Mean total 1-year costs 
for breast cancer were higher than those for CRC 
and prostate cancer among patients aged <65 years 
with stages II–IV disease (ranging from $53,100 to 
$92,500). Prostate cancer had the lowest costs in 
all stages among both age groups. Mean total 5-year 
costs followed the same pattern, with highest costs 
for lung cancer in stages I–III and for CRC in stage 
IV, and lowest costs for prostate cancer.
Costs by Age Group
Within each cancer site and stage, medical care costs 
were generally higher among patients aged <65 than 
those aged ≥65 (Table 3). For breast and lung can-
cers, patients aged <65 years had higher mean total 
and net costs than those aged ≥65 years, across all 
stages; these differences in costs were greatest in stage 
IV. In breast cancer, for example, mean total 5-year 
costs for patients aged <65 years were $198,400 ver-
sus $116,800 for those aged ≥65 years, and mean 
net 5-year costs for patients aged <65 years were 
$172,900 versus $77,100 for those aged ≥65 years. 
For CRC and prostate cancer, differences in mean 
total costs between age groups varied by stage at di-
agnosis; however, across all stages, mean net costs for 
patients aged <65 years were at least $1,400 higher 
than costs for patients aged ≥65 years.
Total and Net Costs
Comparing the mean total and net cost estimates, 
within cancer sites and stages, we observed the great-
est differences among patients aged ≥65 years, reflect-
ing higher medical care costs in individuals without 
a cancer history in the older age group (Table 3). 
For example, the absolute differences between mean

total and net 1-year cost estimates among patients 
with stage I disease aged ≥65 years were approxi-
mately $8,100 (breast cancer), $8,900 (CRC), 
$8,600 (lung cancer), and $8,500 (prostate cancer), 
whereas among those aged <65 years, these differ-
ences were approximately $4,700, $4,900, $5,200, 
and $5,100, respectively.
Discussion 
This study provides valuable information on the 
total and net direct costs of medical care for the 4 
most commonly diagnosed cancers in the United 
States among patients diagnosed at ages <65 and 
≥65 years. Our study extends prior studies based on 
SEER-Medicare fee-for-service claims data14–19,37,38 
by providing costs-of-care estimates for patients with 
cancer aged ≥65 years who receive their Medicare 
benefits through private health plans (ie, Medicare 
Advantage),27,39 which accounted for 31% of Medi-
care enrollees in 2016. Consistent with earlier stud-
ies, our findings show high costs of medical care for 
patients with CRC and lung cancer, and higher costs 
among patients diagnosed with advanced versus ear-
lier-stage disease in the fee-for-service setting.15,33
Findings from this study address a significant 
knowledge gap by updating registry-based estimates 
of medical care costs among US patients with can-

aEstimates of total direct costs of medical care were calculated as total cost for cases, stratified by cancer site, stage, and age group. Estimates of net direct costs of medical care 
were calculated as total cost for cases minus total cost for controls, by each cancer site, stage, and age group. All estimates are presented in thousands (eg, $61.6 = $61,600), 
rounded to nearest hundred, adjusted to 2015 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index for Medical Care (http://www.bls.gov/cpi/), base year 2008, and discounted at 3% annually. 
One-year cost estimates are based on healthcare costs in the first year following cancer diagnosis, and 5-year costs are based on healthcare costs in the 5 years immediately 
following cancer diagnosis. Total patient-months for breast controls (age <65 years = 3,775,790 and ≥65 years = 2,481,580), colorectal controls (age <65 years = 1,030,877 and ≥65 
years = 2,481,580), prostate controls (age <65 years = 1,714,696 and ≥65 years = 2,652,419), and lung controls (age <65 years = 756,834 and ≥65 years = 1,577,939).

key to curtailing high long-term costs associated with 
late-stage disease. This also emphasizes the need for 
continued effective cancer screening, as outlined 
by the US Preventive Services Task Force,40–42 and 
for heeding the significance of the Healthy People 
2020 objectives43 to reduce the number of invasive 
CRC and late-stage female breast cancer diagnoses. 
Given the significant proportion of patients in the 
United States aged <65 years diagnosed with breast 
(58%), colorectal (42%), lung (31%), or prostate 
cancer (43%),44 these trends further illustrate the 
limitations of relying on SEER-Medicare data alone 
to understand the costs of cancer care in the United 
States.
Importantly, the monthly phase-of-care, 1-year, 
and 5-year cost estimates provided in our study, strat-
ified by age at diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, and total 
versus net cost, serve as a unique resource that can 
be used in comparative effectiveness and economic 
analyses to inform the development and evaluation 
of interventions and policies associated with medi-
cal care across the cancer continuum.45 Escalating 
cancer prevalence points to an increasing demand 
for cancer care services and underscores the utility of 
studies that examine the cost of cancer care in formu-
lating future directions and research priorities.46 Ap-
proximately half of all new cancer diagnoses (46%) 
in the United States comprise breast, CRC, lung, 
or prostate cancer, and survival among individuals 
diagnosed with these cancers has increased signifi-
cantly over the past decade47,48; accordingly, it is im-
perative that we understand the potential long-term 
cost implications for patients diagnosed with these 
common cancers. Additionally, several new value-
based payment models, such as the CMS Oncology 
Care Model and ASCO’s Patient-Centered Oncol-
ogy Payment model, all indicate a shift away from 
fee-for-service payments to bundled and episode-of-
care payments, which are hallmarks of integrated 
healthcare systems. 
Although our study has many strengths, findings 
should be considered in light of certain limitations. 
First, study estimates reflect mean total and net costs 
of medical care for individuals enrolled in 4 partic-
ipating integrated health plans and, thus, are most 
generalizable to patients diagnosed with cancer who 
receive care in similar delivery settings. Moreover, 
our study population was composed of predominate-
ly non-Hispanic white, insured patients; accord-
ingly, the cost estimates presented in our study may 
underestimate cancer care costs in other US patient 
populations. Second, reported cost estimates reflect 
utilization patterns of populations enrolled in par-
ticipating health plans from 2000 through 2008. As

such, our estimates may be conservative, because 
they do not account for novel, high-cost cancer 
therapies and other medical care technologies in-
troduced after 2008. As comprehensive data on the 
utilization of newer cancer therapies and technolo-
gies across different health settings become avail-
able, future studies that estimate the associated costs 
of medical care will be imperative. Nonetheless, to 
our knowledge, these results afford the most con-
temporary estimates of cancer-related costs among 
US patients aged <65 years receiving care in inte-
grated delivery systems. Reported cost estimates also 
are limited to the study sample size for each cancer 
site, stage at diagnosis, and patient age at diagnosis. 
However, use of the phase-of-care approach and the 
KMSA method leverages existing data efficiently 
and yields cost estimates that are useful for stake-
holders to understand the costs of investing in can-
cer care.34 The costs reported in our study do not in-
clude out-of-pocket expenses associated with cancer 
care; future studies that estimate these expenses for 
patients are warranted. 
Lastly, this study is based on medical care that oc-
curred before implementation of the Affordable Care 
Act (ACA), which was designed, in part, to reduce 
overall healthcare costs. Therefore, there are a num-
ber of ways that the ACA could also affect cancer 
costs, such as (1) reforming provider and Medicare 
Advantage plan payments, (2) providing alternative 
delivery and payment models (eg, Accountable Care 
Organizations) that move away from fee-for-service 
toward value-based reimbursement, and (3) increas-
ing individuals’ access to cancer prevention services 
through Medicaid expansion and essential health 
benefit coverage.49 As more data become available, 
the impact of the ACA on cancer care costs will be 
an important area for future research. 
Conclusions
The costs of cancer care reported in this study in-
crease understanding of the magnitude of medical 
care resources, including those specific to cancer 
(net costs), needed to provide services to individuals 
diagnosed with the 4 most commonly diagnosed can-
cers in the United States. The high costs of medical 
care for patients aged <65 years and those diagnosed 
with lung cancer suggest that it may be important 
to focus on these population groups to control in-
creasing costs of cancer care, particularly because 
US trends indicate that nearly half of all new can-
cer diagnoses occur among those aged <65 years and 
that lung cancer is the second-most commonly diag-
nosed cancer among US adults.26 Further, the high 
costs of advanced-stage cancers highlight the sub-
stantial economic burden to the healthcare system 
and patients, and the importance of early detection 
strategies. Overall, medical care cost estimates using 
different data sources and patient populations are 
necessary to enhance our knowledge of the role of 
various healthcare delivery settings in determining 
the costs of cancer care.
