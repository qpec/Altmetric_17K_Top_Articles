IMPORTANCE African Americans have the highest breast cancer mortality rate. Although racial
difference in the distribution of intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer is known, it is unclear if
there are other inherent genomic differences that contribute to the survival disparities.
OBJECTIVES To investigate racial differences in breast cancer molecular features and survival
and to estimate the heritability of breast cancer subtypes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Among a convenience cohort of patients with invasive
breast cancer, breast tumor and matched normal tissue sample data (as of September 18,
2015) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Breast cancer–free interval, tumor molecular features, and
genetic variants.
RESULTS Participants were 930 patients with breast cancer, including 154 black patients of
African ancestry (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 55.66 [13.01] years; 98.1% [n = 151] female) and
776 white patients of European ancestry (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 59.51 [13.11] years;
99.0% [n = 768] female). Compared with white patients, black patients had a worse breast
cancer-free interval (hazard ratio, HR=1.67, 95 CI: 1.02-2.74; P = .043). They had a higher
likelihood of basal-like (odds ratio, 3.80; 95% CI, 2.46-5.87; P < .001) and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2 [formerly HER2])–enriched (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI,
1.10-4.47; P = .027) breast cancer subtypes, with the Luminal A subtype as the reference.
Blacks had more TP53 mutations and fewer PIK3CA mutations than whites. While most
molecular differences were eliminated after adjusting for intrinsic subtype, the study found
16 DNA methylation probes, 4 DNA copy number segments, 1 protein, and 142 genes that
were differentially expressed, with the gene-based signature having an excellent capacity for
distinguishing breast tumors from black vs white patients (cross-validation C index, 0.878).
Using germline genotypes, the heritability of breast cancer subtypes (basal vs nonbasal) was
estimated to be 0.436 (P = 1.5 × 10−14). The estrogen receptor–positive polygenic risk score
built from 89 known susceptibility variants was higher in blacks than in whites (difference,
0.24; P = 2.3 × 10−5), while the estrogen receptor–negative polygenic risk score was much
higher in blacks than in whites (difference, 0.48; P = 2.8 × 10−11).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE On the molecular level, after adjusting for intrinsic subtype
frequency differences, this study found a modest number of genomic differences but a
significant clinical survival outcome difference between blacks and whites in The Cancer
Genome Atlas data set. Moreover, more than 40% of breast cancer subtype frequency
differences could be explained by genetic variants. These data could form the basis for the
development of molecular targeted therapies to improve clinical outcomes for the specific
subtypes of breast cancers that disproportionately affect black women. Findings also indicate
that personalized risk assessment and optimal treatment could reduce deaths from
aggressive breast cancers for black women.

B
reast cancer is the most common tumor in women.1,2
While the incidence among black and white women
in the United States has converged at 135 cases per
100 000 women per year in recent years, the mortality gap has
continued to increase, with a 42% higher death rate in black
patients.3 The reasons for this survival gap are multifactorial
and may include access to care and inherent biological tumor
differences.4 One known biological cause of this racial dispar-
ityisthehigherfrequencyofbasal-likeortriple-negativebreast
cancers (TNBCs) (ie, negative for estrogen receptor [ER], pro-
gesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor 2 [ERBB2, formerly HER2]) among black women.5-10
However, there is a paucity of data on additional biological or
genomic differences that explain the higher mortality rate in
blacks. Increased genetic predisposition due to higher risk al-
lele frequencies at the TERT (OMIM 187270) locus and a higher
prevalence of specific lifestyle factors, such as lack of breast-
feeding, may contribute to intrinsic subtype frequency differ-
ences seen across ethnicities.11,12
To address this knowledge gap, we systematically inves-
tigated molecular features, including gene expression, pro-
tein expression, somatic mutations, somatic DNA copy num-
ber alteration (CNA), and DNA methylation patterns, between
breast cancers of black and white patients and examined dif-
ferences in breast cancer recurrence and overall survival in re-
lation to these molecular features. In addition, we assessed
germline genetic variants for breast cancer intrinsic subtypes
and estimated the heritability of these subtypes.
Methods
Study Cohort
This study used breast cancer data (as of September 18, 2015)
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which are publicly
available from TCGA Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov
/docs/publications/tcga/). Data fields were processed using
established methods unless otherwise specified13 (eTable 1 in
Supplement 1). We estimated genomic race using principal
component analysis of germline genotype data from 1062
patients (eMethods in Supplement 2). Patients were grouped
into genomic black (≥50% African ancestry) or genomic white
(≥90% European ancestry). Herein, we present analytical
methods unique to this study, while genomic data generation
and processing have been previously described.14 The samples
were collected under institutional review board–approved
protocols at each participating institution and analysis was
performed by the African American TCGA Breast Cancer
Working Group. This study used only deidentified data from
TCGA Project.
Gene Expression by RNA Sequencing
After excluding genes not expressed or not variable (zero reads
orSD<1),upperquartilenormalizedRNAsequencingdatawere
log2transformed.Predictionanalysisofmicroarray50(PAM50)
intrinsicsubtypeswerecalledaspreviouslydescribed.14,15Mul-
tinomial logistic regression was used to examine the associa-
tion between breast cancer subtype and genomic race.
Differentially expressed genes between black patients and
white patients were identified by linear regression, fitting a
model adjusting for age at diagnosis and batch (36 batches) and
further adjusting for intrinsic subtype. False discovery rates
(FDRs) by Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni-adjusted P val-
ues were calculated to control for multiple testing. Hierarchi-
cal clustering analysis with a Spearman rank correlation simi-
larity measure was used for visualization. We used elastic net
penalized logistic regression to create a race-differentiated
gene signature, with cross-validation to tune the penalty
parameters.16 Using 10-fold cross-validation data sets, area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve, ie, C index
(AUROC), was calculated to assess the discriminating capac-
ity of the signature.
Protein Expression
Reverse phase protein array data contain expression levels for
215 proteins and phosphorylated proteins for 745 patients (114
black and 631 white). Linear regression models were used to
identify differentially expressed proteins, adjusting for age at
diagnosis and batches. Proteins that passed the multiple test-
ingcorrectionwithFDRslessthan0.05wereincludedinamul-
tivariable logistic regression. AUROC was calculated using 10-
fold cross-validation data sets.
Somatic Mutation and DNA CNAs
We examined genes with mutations in coding regions,14 inte-
grating information from DNA and RNA sequencing.17 The
numbersofmutatedgenesandCNAsegmentsperpatientwere
comparedbetweenblacksandwhitesusingWilcoxonranksum
tests. Recurrently mutated genes and recurrent CNAs were
identified by MutSigCV2 and GISTIC,18,19 respectively. Differ-
ences in mutation frequency or CNAs were determined with
Fisher exact test and logistic regression to adjust for subtype.
DNA Methylation
DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450; Illu-
mina) data were available for 124 black cases and 517 white
Key Points
Question What are the tumor biological differences in invasive
breast cancers from patients of African and European ancestry?
Findings In the cohort study from The Cancer Genome Atlas, a
racial disparity in breast cancer–free interval and distribution of
aggressive subtypes of breast cancers was detected. After taking
into account differences in prevalence of intrinsic subtypes,
modest molecular differences in gene expression, protein
expression, somatic mutations, and DNA methylation patterns
were observed, and most significantly, higher genetic contribution
to estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer was seen in black
patients than in white patients.
Meaning Biological differences between breast cancers in blacks
and whites may be linked to differences in the distribution of
germline genetic variants, and interventions to improve cancer risk
assessment and optimal use of more effective targeted therapies
have the potential to close the widening mortality gap between
black and white patients with breast cancer.

cases. Of 480 721 probes, we identified 13 811 cancer-
associated hypermethylation probes located within 1500 base
pairs of a transcription start site and 9436 cancer-associated
hypomethylation probes that overlapped with putative en-
hancer regions (eMethods in Supplement 2). We used linear
regression models to identify race-specific DNA methylation,
with adjustment for age, tumor purity, and subtype.
Survival Analysis
We used a disease-free survival definition that included all
breast cancer–related events to define the breast cancer–free
interval (BCFI).20 Events for BCFI were defined as locore-
gional recurrences, distant metastases, new primary tumors
in the breast, or deaths from breast cancer. The BCFI was de-
fined as the time from the date of the initial pathological di-
agnosis to the date of the events defined above, the date of last
contact,orthedateofdeath.ForBCFIanalysis,17patientswith
stage IV cancer at diagnosis were excluded. Another 17 pa-
tients who died with tumor but without an indication of a de-
fined new tumor event were excluded for lack of informa-
tion, resulting in 896 patients for BCFI analysis. Overall
survival was defined as the date of diagnosis to the date of last
contact or death (in 930 patients). Because of a limited dura-
tion of follow-up, survival analysis may be underpowered to
detect racial disparity, especially for ER-positive breast can-
cer. To compensate for this limitation, we also calculated the
PAM50-based risk of recurrence score,15 which estimates the
biological potential of recurrence.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival
curves. We fit a series of Cox proportional hazards regression
models, starting from a model with race only, then a multi-
variable model adjusting for age and American Joint Commit-
tee on Cancer stage, then subtypes, and then further adjust-
ingformolecularfeatures(geneexpression,proteinexpression,
or mutation) that were differentially present between blacks
and whites. Only molecular features associated with BCFI in
Cox proportional hazards regression models were considered
potential mediators.
Germline Variants
DNA from germline samples was hybridized to arrays (SNP Ar-
ray 6.0; Affymetrix) to genotype single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs). Of 93 breast cancer susceptibility loci identi-
fied in previous genome-wide association studies,21-25 a total
of 24 were genotyped. For the remaining SNPs, we con-
ducted imputation analysis using IMPUTE2 software,26 and 65
SNPs could be imputed reliably (imputation score >0.7; mean,
0.97). Therefore, a total of 89 SNPs were analyzed in this study.
First, we compared SNP allele frequencies of these 89 SNPs be-
tween racial groups using Fisher exact test, and we deter-
mined if they varied by subtype after adjusting for race using
logistic regression. Second, because the power for assessing
individual SNPs was limited in the TCGA data set, we derived
polygenetic risk scores (PRSs) for ER-positive and ER-
negative breast cancers to investigate the combined effects of
89 SNPs using the following equation:
PRS=β1χ1+β2χ2+…+βκχκ+βnχn,
where βκ is the per-allele log odds ratio for breast cancer as-
sociated with risk alleles published previously23-25 and where
χκ is the number of risk alleles (0, 1, or 2) for the kth SNP. Third,
because many breast cancer susceptibility loci are yet to be
identified, we tried to extract breast cancer subtype–related
information using all genetic variants on Affymetrix arrays.
With a mixed-effects model implemented in GCTA,27 we es-
timated subtype heritability. The phenotype in the mixed-
effects model is a simplified subtype (basal vs nonbasal). To
increase statistical power, we also estimated the heritability
of ESR1 and ERBB2 gene expression, 2 genes that are impor-
tant components of the PAM50 subtypes.
Results
Molecular Portraits of Breast Tumors by Race
In the TCGA cohort, there were 154 black patients of African
ancestry and 776 white patients of European ancestry. While
not population based, many of our findings were in line with
previous population-based research. For example, black pa-
tients were diagnosed at a younger age and were more likely
to have ER-negative or nonluminal subtypes of breast can-
cers(Table1).Afteradjustingforage,blackpatientshadahigher
oddsofbasal-like(oddsratio,3.80;95%CI,2.46-5.87;P < .001)
and HER2-enriched (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.10-4.47;
P = .027) breast cancer subtypes than white patients, with the
luminal A subtype as the reference.
We identified 9232 genes (49.1%) differentially expressed
between black and white patients after adjusting for age and
batcheffects(nominalP < .05).Afteradjustingforsubtype,142
geneshadBonferroni-adjustedP < .05(eTable2inSupplement
1). The top 2 differentially expressed genes were LOC90784 (no
OMIM accession number to date) and CRYBB2 (OMIM 123620)
(Figure 1). Unsupervised clustering analysis of the 142 genes
identified a branch enriched for black patients in each sub-
type (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2, right). Using penalized logis-
tic regression, we developed a gene expression signature from
the 142 genes distinguishing breast tumor samples from blacks
and whites, with a cross-validation AUROC of 0.878.
We found 25 proteins differentially expressed between tu-
mors from blacks and whites after adjusting for age, batch, and
subtype (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Expression of these pro-
teinscanmoderatelydistinguishblackandwhitepatients(eFig-
ure 2 in Supplement 2). Two proteins (caspase-8 and Src) had
FDRs less than 0.05, but only caspase-8 had P < .05 after Bon-
ferroni adjustment. A logistic regression model that included
the 2 proteins yielded an AUROC of 0.629 in the cross-
validation analysis.
We did not find any difference in the total number of mu-
tations per patient between blacks and whites. However, the
total number of CNA segments was higher in black patients
compared with white patients within the luminal A subtype
(eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). Comparing mutation frequen-
cies of the 68 recurrently mutated genes, 44 regions of gain
and 28 regions of loss, we found that 13 of them were signifi-
cantly different between the 2 races (Table 2 and eTable 4 and
eTable5inSupplement1).Comparedwithwhitepatients,black

patients had a higher proportion of TP53 (OMIM 191170) mu-
tations (51.7% vs 31.3%) and 8q24.21/MYC (OMIM 190080) am-
plification (30.9% vs 20.4%) and a lower proportion of PIK3CA
(OMIM 171834) mutations (23.7% vs 35.6%). However, after ad-
justing for subtype, no mutations and only 4 CNAs (11q23.1 de-
letion, 21q21.1 deletion, 8p12 amplification, and 12q15 ampli-
fication) remained statistically significant, with slightly higher
frequencies in blacks.
We identified 9 hypermethylated DNA methylation probes
significantly associated with race after adjusting for age, tu-
mor purity, and subtype (multiple testing adjusted P < .001).
The DNA methylation levels of all 9 probes were higher in
blacks (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2). Of the hypomethylated en-
hancer probes, 7 were significantly associated with race after
adjusting for age, tumor purity, and subtype (multiple testing
adjusted P < .001). The DNA methylation levels were lower in
black patients than in white patients, suggesting that enhanc-
ers at these loci may be more active in black patients (eFigure
5 in Supplement 2).
Breast Cancer Recurrence and Survival by Race
During a median follow-up of 29 months, 81 BCFI recurrence
events occurred. There was a significant difference in BCFI
between blacks and whites (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67; 95 CI, 1.02-
2.74; P = .043), with the difference most pronounced in basal-
like cancers or TNBCs (Figure 2, A-C). By contrast, blacks had
a higher PAM50 risk of recurrence score than whites, with the
difference most pronounced in non–basal-like cancers or non-
TNBCs (Figure 2, D-F). In the multivariable Cox proportional
hazards regression model adjusting for age and American Joint
Committee on Cancer stage, blacks exhibited a significantly
worse outcome (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.16; P = .014). Fur-
ther adjusting for subtype, the HR for race was reduced slightly
(HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.02-2.95; P = .043). We found more racial
differences in BCFI outcomes in basal-like breast cancer (HR,
2.36) than in nonbasal subtypes (HR, 1.28), although none
reached statistical significance due to limited events within
each subgroup (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).
The TP53 mutation was a positive predictor for recur-
rence (age- and stage–adjusted HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.29-3.22;
P = .002),andTP53mutationfrequencyvariedbetweenblacks
and whites. The racial difference in BCFI remained statisti-
cally significant after adjusting for TP53 mutation status (HR,
2.10; 95% CI, 1.22-3.61; P = .007). The racial-enriched gene ex-
pression signature was prognostic across all patients (age and
stage–adjusted HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.95-4.46; P = .066); after

CI, 0.60-4.02; P = .36). The 2 most significantly differentially
expressed proteins (caspase-8 and Src), the PIK3CA muta-
tion, MYC amplification, and the 4 CNAs with different fre-
quencies between racial groups were not prognostic factors for
BCFI. Race was not associated with overall survival (eFigure
6 in Supplement 2). However, blacks with basal-like subtype
orTNBCstrendedtowardworseoverallsurvivalcomparedwith
whites in subgroup analyses.
Germline Variants and the Heritability
of Breast Cancer Subtypes
We found significant allele frequency differences between
blacks and whites for 76 of 89 breast cancer susceptibility SNPs
in case-only analyses (eTable 7 in Supplement 1). After adjust-
ing for race, 4 SNPs were significantly associated with intrin-
sic subtype (eTable 8 in Supplement 1). The risk allele (T) of
SNP rs10069690 in TERT was higher in blacks than whites and
was associated with a higher odds of basal-like relative to lu-
minal A subtype breast cancer, which is consistent with
studies11,24 showing that rs10069690 was associated with ER-
negative breast cancer. Two SNPs (rs10069690 and rs7726159)
in TERT were associated with a lower odds of HER2-enriched
relative to luminal A subtype breast cancer. The risk allele (C)
of rs11814448 was a common allele in blacks but was rare in
whites, and it was associated with a lower odds of luminal B
subtype tumors. In contrast, the risk allele (A) of SNP
rs34084277 in BABAM1 (OMIM 612766) was lower in blacks
than whites, and it was associated with a higher odds of basal-
like compared with luminal A subtype breast cancer, a find-
ing consistent with previous genome-wide association stud-
ies showing that variants in the BABAM1 gene were associated
with ER-negative breast cancer.28 To summarize the com-
bined effect of 89 SNPs and understand how allele frequency
differences between blacks and whites in these common vari-
ants contribute to racial differences in subtype distribution,
we calculated breast cancer PRSs. We found that blacks had
higher ER-positive and ER-negative PRSs than whites, and the
racialdifferenceinER-negativePRSswasevenlarger(Figure3),
suggesting that breast cancer (especially ER-negative breast
cancer) in blacks has a greater genetic contribution than in
whites.
In a heritability analysis of breast cancer subtype, we
found that 43.6% (SE, 24.5%; P = 1.5 × 10−14) of subtype varia-
tion can be explained by genome-wide germline variants. We
estimated the heritability of ESR1 (OMIM 133430) and ERBB2/
HER2 (OMIM 164870) gene expression as continuous vari-
ables and found the heritability of ESR1 to be 39.8% (SE,
16.0%; P = 1.3 × 10−14) and the heritability of ERBB2/HER2 to
be 17.3% (SE, 16.1%; P = .098). The ER-positive PRS built from
89 known susceptibility variants was higher in blacks than in
whites (difference, 0.24; P = 2.3 × 10−5), while the ER-
negative PRS was much higher in blacks than in whites (dif-
ference, 0.48; P = 2.8 × 10−11).
Discussion
In the first ancestry-based comprehensive analysis of mul-
tiple platforms of genomic and proteomic data of its kind to
date, we found significant molecular differences between in-
vasivebreastcancersfromgenomicallydefinedblackandwhite

a modest number of genomic features, including gene expres-
sion (n = 142), protein (n = 1), DNA copy number (n = 4), and
DNA methylation (n = 16), that were different between these
ancestry groups after adjusting for subtype.

non–basal-like breast cancer has a longer time to recurrence.
Thehigherriskofrecurrenceforblackpatientsrelativetowhite
patients was attenuated after taking into account subtype and
was further reduced after adjusting for the race-specific gene
expressionsignature;itshouldbenotedthatthissignaturecor-
relates highly with ancestry, so collinearity existed. Several in-
vestigations have examined gene expression by race in breast
cancer: all studies29-34 except one35 found race-specific gene
expression patterns. Results from these studies are not en-
tirely consistent because of variable sample sizes and differ-
ing analytical methods. However, one gene that has been con-
sistently found to be higher in tumors from blacks than from
whites is the CRYBB2 gene.30-32,34 We showed that CRYBB2 ex-
pression was higher in black patients than in white patients
within each breast cancer subtype. Expression of CRYBB2 was
alsofoundtobehigherinnormalbreasttissuefromblacksthan
those from whites.31,34 Furthermore, CRYBB2 had higher ex-
pression in prostate cancer and colorectal cancer from black
Americans compared with white Americans.36,37 Taken to-
gether,thesefindingsindicatethatCRYBB2islikelyatruerace-
specificgene,anditsdifferentialexpressionbyraceislikelydue

lation. We conducted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Ge-
nomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the 142 genes differentially
expressed between blacks and whites and found an enrich-
mentinetherlipid(P = .023)andalpha-linolenicacid(P = .049)

tus or obesity rates between blacks and whites.38,39
We estimated that more than 40% of the variation in in-
trinsic breast cancer subtype can be explained by inherited
germlinevariants(knownandunknown),suggestingthatasig-
nificant proportion of racial differences in subtype frequen-
cies are due to genetic factors. This finding is supported by pre-
vious studies11,28,40 in which predisposing germline variants
varied in frequency by race. The heritability of ESR1 was higher
than that of ERBB2/HER2, which extends previous observa-
tionsthattheER-positiveproportionvarieswidelyacrosspopu-
lations, while the ERBB2-positive proportion does not.10,41 For

PRSs to summarize the combined effect of 89 known germ-
line variants and found that differences in allele frequencies
between blacks and whites can explain racial differences in the
distributionofsubtypes,withblackshavingamuchhigherPRS
for ER-negative breast cancer. Taken together, these findings
underscore the need for larger genetic epidemiological stud-
ies to identify additional biological factors that contribute to
racial frequency differences in breast cancer subtypes.
This comprehensive assessment of multiple omics data
types, including somatic mutations, CNAs, gene expression,
protein expression, DNA methylation, and germline variants,
identified important differences between breast cancers from
black and white patients. Compared with previous analyses of
TCGA breast cancer data, we included 154 black women, up-
dating the data sets presented previously in studies by Keenan

Limitations
Thepresentstudyhassomelimitations.First,TCGAcohortcon-
sists of convenience samples, so it may not represent a gen-
eralbreastcancerpatientpopulation.Nonetheless,mostofour
findings are similar to previous publications with respect to
the frequency differences and outcomes of blacks with basal-
likecancersorTNBCs.5-10,43Second,ashortfollow-uptimeand
unclear definition of cause of death may have affected the in-
vestigation of racial disparity in cancer recurrence. Third, so-
cioeconomic and environmental factors were not available in
TCGA, so their contribution to racial disparity could not be
evaluated. Fourth, TCGA may not have sufficient power to test
racial differences in each breast cancer subtype because strin-
gent multiple testing procedures need to be taken.
Conclusions
In summary, this study demonstrated that there are biologi-
cal differences between breast cancers in black patients and
white patients that are linked to genetic ancestry broadly
and to specific inherited gene variants. Future studies are
warranted to investigate genetic and nongenetic factors that
contribute to heterogeneity in the development of distinct
breast cancer subtypes, as well as how these factors influ-
ence response to therapy and survival outcomes in diverse
populations.
