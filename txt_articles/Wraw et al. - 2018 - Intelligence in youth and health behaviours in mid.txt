Objective: We investigated the association between intelligence in youth and a range of health-related beha-
viours in middle age.
Method: Participants were the 5347 men and women who responded to the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth 1979 (NLSY-79) 2012 survey. IQ was recorded with the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) when
participants were aged 15 to 23 years of age. Self-reports on exercise (moderate activity, vigorous activity, and
strength training), dietary, smoking, drinking, and oral health behaviours were recorded when participants were
in middle age (mean age = 51.7 years). A series of regression analyses tested for an association between IQ in
youth and the different health related behaviours in middle age, while adjusting for childhood socio-economic
status (SES) and adult SES.
Results: Higher IQ in youth was significantly associated with the following behaviours that are beneficial to
health: being more likely to be able to do moderate cardiovascular activity (Odds Ratio, 95% CI) (1.72, 1.35 to
2.20, p < .001) and strength training (1.61, 1.37 to 1.90, p < .001); being less likely to have had a sugary drink
in the previous week (0.75, 0.71 to 0.80, p < .001); a lower likelihood of drinking alcohol heavily (0.67, 0.61 to
0.74, p < .001); being less likely to smoke (0.60, 0.56 to 0.65, p < .001); being more likely to floss (1.47, 1.35
to 1.59, p < .001); and being more likely to say they “often” read the nutritional information (1.20, 1.09 to
1.31, p < .001) and ingredients (1.24, 1.12 to 1.36, p < .001) on food packaging compared to always reading
them. Higher IQ was also linked with dietary behaviours that may or may not be linked with poorer health
outcomes (i.e. being more likely to have skipped a meal (1.10, 1.03 to 1.17, p = .005) and snacked between
meals (1.37, 1.26 to 1.50, p < .001) in the previous week). An inverted u-shaped association was also found
between IQ and the number of meals skipped per week. Higher IQ was also linked with behaviours that are
known to be linked with poorer health (i.e. a higher likelihood of drinking alcohol compared to being abstinent
from drinking alcohol (1.58, 1.47 to 1.69, p < .001)). A u-shaped association was found between IQ and the
amount of alcohol consumed per week and an inverted u-shaped association was found between IQ and the
number of cigarettes smoked a day. Across all outcomes, adjusting for childhood SES tended to attenuate the
estimated effect size only slightly. Adjusting for adult SES led to more marked attenuation but statistical sig-
nificance was maintained in most cases.
Conclusion: In the present study, a higher IQ in adolescence was associated with a number of healthier beha-
viours in middle age. In contrast to these results, a few associations were also identified between higher in-
telligence and behaviours that may or may not be linked with poor health (i.e. skipping meals and snacking
between meals) and with behaviours that are known to be linked with poor health (i.e. drinking alcohol and the
number of cigarettes smoked). To explore mechanisms of association, future studies could test for a range of
health behaviours as potential mediators between IQ and morbidity or mortality in later life.
Intelligence measured in youth is associated with lower rates of
premature all-cause and cause-specific mortality (Batty, Deary, &
Gottfredson, 2007; Calvin et al., 2011; Calvin et al., 2017; Deary,
Whiteman, Starr, Whalley, & Fox, 2004; Whalley & Deary, 2001) and a
number of leading chronic health conditions including, but not limited
to, cardio-vascular disease (CVD), diabetes, chronic lung disease, and
high blood pressure (Der, Batty, & Deary, 2009; Wraw, Deary, Gale, &
Der, 2015). It is possible that health behaviours lie on the pathways that
link early life intelligence with morbidity and mortality in middle and
later life (Gottfredson & Deary, 2004). The aim of the present study is to

 investigate the association between intelligence in youth and a range of
health-related behaviours in middle age. The behaviours of interest in
the present study are exercise habits, diet, smoking, drinking, and oral
hygiene behaviours. We will cover the literature on the link between IQ
and each of these behaviours separately.
Many of the studies that have examined the associations between
physical activity in adulthood and early-life cognitive ability have
found higher intelligence to be associated with being more physically
active (Batty, Deary, & Macintyre, 2006; Clouston, Richards, Cadar, &
Hofer, 2015; O'Callaghan, Bor, & Najman, 2012; Osler, Godtfredsen, &
Prescott, 2008). One study that was based on the Mater-University of
Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223) found a mixture of results
upon investigating the associations between intelligence and different
measures of physical activity (O'Callaghan et al., 2012). They found
that lower IQ scores at age 21 years were associated with doing less
moderate activity over the past 2 weeks and 6 months at the age of
21 years. This study also found an inverted u-shaped association be-
tween IQ and both vigorous exercise and vigorous activity (apart from
exercise) over the past two weeks. For example, with the number of
vigorous activity sessions over the past two weeks broken into four
categories (i.e. Nil, 1 to 3, 4 to 9, and 10 +) those who did either no
sessions (IQ 102.9) or > 10 sessions (IQ 102.8) had lower scores on the
Peabody verbal IQ test than those who reported doing either 1 to 3 (IQ
104.9) or 4 to 9 (IQ 104.4) sessions (F = 5.45, p = .001). As this was a
cross sectional study, the direction of the association could not be de-
termined. Studies have also identified null associations between early-
life IQ and whether or not people exercised regularly (Modig &
Bergman, 2012) and with the frequency of physical activity (Batty,
Deary, & Macintyre, 2006; O'Callaghan et al., 2012). The longitudinal
studies cited are limited because they only included measures of whe-
ther or not people exercise and the frequency of exercise (Batty, Deary,
& Macintyre, 2006; Clouston et al., 2015; Osler et al., 2008). No data
were collected on the minutes of exercise taken each week in any of the
cited studies which is needed in order to establish whether people are as
active as the US guidelines recommend in the 2008 Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans (U.S Department of Health and Human
Services, 2008. The present study aims to shed light on this area of
research by exploring the association between early-life intelligence
and both the ability to engage in cardiovascular activity and the
amount of cardiovascular activity per week at middle age. Cardiovas-
cular activities are activities that increase the heart rate and breathing
rate to increase the delivery of oxygen to working muscles. This will be
the first study that we are aware of that examines the association be-
tween early life intelligence and strength training.
The few studies that have investigated the association between
early-life cognitive ability and diet-related behaviours in adulthood
found higher IQ to be associated with healthier dietary choices (Batty,
Deary, & Macintyre, 2006; Crichton et al., 2015; Kanazawa, 2013; Osler
et al., 2008). One study found null associations between intelligence
and three dietary habits (Lyerly & Reeve, 2014). Lyerly and Reeve
(2014) studied the relationship between intelligence and dietary be-
haviours in a sample of 4078 men and women using data from the 2010
NLSY-79 survey. They found no association between intelligence in
youth and three measures of dietary habits (frequency with which
participants consumed fast food and sugary drinks and how often they
skipped meals in the past 7 days). However, their results are question-
able due to the methodological limitations of their study design. Their
measures of dietary behaviours were positively skewed and they used
ordinary least squares regression to analyse their data, which is not the
best model to use on skewed measures. The present study investigates
the same associations using a generalized linear regression model,
which is more appropriate for skewed measures, on data from the
NLSY79 2012 survey. The association between intelligence and an ad-
ditional dietary behaviour (snacking between meals) and two measures
of reading food labels will also be included in the present study.
Studies
that
examined
the
association
between
early-life
intelligence and alcohol consumption in middle age have found mixed
results. Some studies have found that more intelligent people are less
likely to abstain from drinking and are more likely to have drinking
problems, drink more frequently, and to have a higher intake of alcohol
in adulthood (Osler et al., 2008; Batty et al., 2008; Clouston et al., 2015;
Cheng & Furnham, 2013. Clouston et al. (2015) found higher in-
telligence in adolescence was associated with heavy drinking (i.e. men
having > 3 drinks on one occasion and women > 2 drinks on one oc-
casion) at around 50 years of age in the Medical Research Council's
National Survey of Health and Development, the combined OR for men
and women was 1.34 (95% C.I 1.10 to 1.62); null associations were
found in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and the National Child
Development Study. Other studies have found that higher early-life
intelligence is protective against some of the more risky drinking be-
haviours, such as the likelihood of having hangovers (Batty, Deary, &
Macintyre, 2006), binge drinking (Cheng & Furnham, 2013), being a
heavy drinker, and being admitted to hospital for or dying from
drinking-related causes (Sjölund, Allebeck, & Hemmingsson, 2011;
Sjölund, Hemmingsson, & Allebeck, 2015; Sjölund, Hemmingsson,
Gustafsson, & Allebeck, 2015). For example, Batty, Deary, & Macintyre
(2006) analysed data from the Aberdeen children of the 1950s study
(n = 5340) and found a SD increment in IQ at age 11 was associated
with lower odds of having a hangover in middle age (OR 0.80, 95% CI
0.72 to 0.89). Cheng and Furnham (2013) analysed data from the Na-
tional Childhood Development Study 1958 (n = 6478) and found a SD
increment in IQ at age 11 was linked with reduced odds of binge
drinking at age 50 years (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.83). The previous
mixed results might suggest a non-linear relationship that might be
better captured by a continuous measure, which was not included in the
cited studies. One of the aims of the present study is to clarify the nature
of the association between early-life intelligence and drinking beha-
viours by exploring the link between IQ and abstaining from alcohol,
amount of alcohol consumed as a continuous measure, and binge
drinking behaviours in middle age.
A number of studies have found higher early-life intelligence to be
related to smoking in middle age (Batty, Deary, & Macintyre, 2007;
Daly & Egan, 2017; Hart et al., 2003; Modig & Bergman, 2012; Osler
et al., 2008; Clouston et al., 2015; Hemmingsson, Kriebel, Melin,
Allebeck, & Lundberg, 2008). For example, Osler et al. (2008) analysed
data from the Metropolit 1953 Danish male birth cohort study
(n = 6292) and found a SD increment in IQ at age 18 was linked with
reduced odds of being a smoker (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.70) and
increased odds of being an ex-smoker (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.48) at
51 years of age. Studies in this area tend to look at the association be-
tween IQ and smoking status (current smoker, ex- smoker, never
smoker) rather than the quantity of cigarettes smoked. Two studies
have analysed the latter (Taylor et al., 2005; Wennerstad et al., 2010).
Using structural equation modelling, Taylor et al. (2005) found a link
between lower IQ and a higher consumption of cigarettes, which was
fully mediated by adult social deprivation. The study by Wennerstad
et al. (2010) was based on the 29,524 Swedish male twin conscripts.
Data about smoking were collected through two separate surveys: the
Screening Across the Lifespan Twin Study (SALT) and the Study of Twin
Adults: Genes and Environment (STAGE). SALT and STAGE are both
surveys of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins that were born
in Sweden, which were used to screen for common diseases. The twins
in SALT were born before 1958 and the twins in STAGE were born
between 1959 and 1985. Wennerstad et al. (2010) found that, with
higher IQ scores, the number of cigarettes smoked per day was lower in
the STAGE survey (r = −0.20 p < .001), but they did not find an as-
sociation in the SALT survey. The present study expands on this area of
research by investigating the association between early life intelligence
and both current smoking status and, for those who smoke, number of
cigarettes smoked per day at age 50.
The present authors are aware of two studies that analysed the as-
sociation between intelligence and oral health (Der et al., 2009; Sabbah
C. Wraw et al.
Intelligence 69 (2018) 71–86
72
 & Sheiham, 2010). Higher intelligence was linked with better oral
health outcomes in both studies (Der et al., 2009; Sabbah & Sheiham,
2010). Der et al. (2009) analysed data from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth 1979 (n = 7476) and found a SD increment in IQ in
youth was linked with reduced odds of having tooth and gum problems
at 40 years of age (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.81). Sabbah and Sheiham
(2010) analysed cross sectional data on 20 to 59 year olds (n = 4390)
from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and
found that lower score on the two tests of intelligence (the Symbol Digit
Substitution Test and the Serial Digit Learning Test) were linked with
poorer oral health. For example, lower scores on the Symbol Digit
Substitution Test was linked with being more likely to have missing
tooth surface (rate ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.31–1.77) and decayed tooth
surface (rate ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.53–2.38). However, the study by
Sabbah and Sheiham (2010) was cross-sectional and analysed measures
of intelligence and oral health status that were taken around the same
time so the direction of the association cannot be determined. No
previous study has looked at the oral health behaviours of brushing and
flossing teeth. The present study is the first to test the longitudinal re-
lationship between intelligence in youth and these two oral hygiene
habits in middle age.
Many of the previous studies that have investigated the longitudinal
association between early-life intelligence and health-related beha-
viours are limited because their investigations only included a single
(Daly & Egan, 2017; Sjölund et al., 2011; Sjölund, Hemmingsson,
Gustafsson, & Allebeck, 2015; Taylor et al., 2003; Wennerstad et al.,
2010) or a few health behaviours (Batty, Deary, & Macintyre, 2006;
Batty, Deary, Schoon, & Gale, 2006; Clouston et al., 2015; Modig &
Bergman, 2012). Also, as discussed above, the results are often mixed.
The present study will help to contribute to this relatively new area of
research within the field of cognitive epidemiology, and will examine
the links between intelligence in youth and thirteen different health
behaviours that are linked with chronic disease, using the NLSY-79
cohort. Lifestyles and health habits tend to be well established and
predictive of health outcomes by midlife (Myint, Smith, Luben, &
Surtees, 2011) so the present study will analyse the association between
IQ in youth and health habits in middle-aged adults.
1. Methods
1.1. Sample
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY-79) is an
on-going longitudinal study. The initial sample was representative of
non-institutionalized young people who lived in the United States and
involved 12,686 participants aged 14–21 years on 31st of December
1978. Socially and economically disadvantaged non-Black and non-
Hispanic people as well as Black and Hispanic ethnic groups were
oversampled. The NLSY-79 study has been described in detail elsewhere
(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). The present analyses were based on
the 5347 men and women who responded to the 2012 survey and had
complete information on AFQT, sex, age at interview, ethnicity, child-
hood SES, and adult SES.
1.2. Measures
1.2.1. Intelligence
Intelligence was measured with the Armed Forces Qualification Test
(AFQT), 1989 re-normed version. Respondents were aged 15–23 years
when they sat this test in 1980. The AFQT is a sub-component of the
Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and is made-up of the four
following subtests: Arithmetic reasoning (30 items), mathematics
knowledge (25 items), word knowledge (35 items), and paragraph
comprehension (15 items). The time limit for the test was 84 min
(Maier, 1993). AFQT is predictive of academic and job performance
(Welsh, Kucinkas, & Curran, 1990). The AFQT variable used in the
present study was downloaded from The Bell Curve Page (Herrnstein &
Murray, 1994). This measure was scored as a percentile, and was then
z-scored.
1.3. Health behaviours
1.3.1. Physical activity habits
Participants were asked if they were able to engage in moderate
cardiovascular
activity,
vigorous
cardiovascular
activity,
and/or
strength training. For participants who said they could engage in each
respective activity, information was collected on the typical number of
minutes spent doing each cardiovascular activity and the typical
number of strength training sessions they did each week. All three of
these measures were categorised because their distributions were
heavily skewed. We chose cut-points for the categorisations based on
the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, for cardiovascular
activity and cut-points based on research recommendations, for
strength training (Candow & Burke, 2007; O'Keefe et al., 2012; U.S
Department of Health and Human Services, 2008; Wen et al., 2011;
Wernbom, Augustsson, & Thome, 2007).
The measure of minutes of moderate activity per week was broken
into the following categories: inactive (< 75 min), a little (75 to
149 min), a medium amount (150 to 509 min), a lot (510 min or more).
As guidelines recommend doing 150 min of moderate cardiovascular
activity each week, a little was selected as the reference category be-
cause this group took some exercise but slightly less than the re-
commended amount (U.S Department of Health and Human Services,
2008; Wen et al., 2011). The measures of moderate and vigorous ac-
tivity were kept as separate measures and were not combined for the
analyses; however, 19% (n = 1215) of the respondents to the question
on vigorous activity provided the same answer to both vigorous and
moderate activity.
The measure of minutes of vigorous activity per week was broken
into the following categories: inactive (< 38 min), a little (38 to
74 min), a medium amount (75 to 254 min), and a lot (255 min of
more). As the guidelines recommend doing 75 min of vigorous cardio-
vascular activity each week, a little was selected as the reference cate-
gory because this group took some exercise but slightly less than the
recommended amount (U.S Department of Health and Human Services,
2008; Wen et al., 2011).
The measure of strength training in sessions per week was broken
into the following categories: inactive (zero sessions), a medium
amount (1 to 3 sessions), a lot (4 or more sessions). As guidelines re-
commend doing two or more resistance training sessions per week and
research recommends doing 1 to 3 sessions per week, a medium amount
was used as the reference category. Research considers doing 4 or more
sessions per week to be a high-frequency of resistance training (Candow
& Burke, 2007; Wernbom et al., 2007).
1.3.2. Diet and nutritional habits
Participants were asked to indicate how frequently (always, often,
sometimes, rarely or never) they read nutritional information and in-
gredients when they buy a food item for the first time. Information was
also collected on how frequently participants ate fast food, snacked
between meals, skipped a meal, and had a sugary drink in the past
7 days.
1.3.3. Smoking habits
Participants were asked if they currently smoke cigarettes. The
participants who reported that they did smoke were asked how many
cigarettes they smoked a day.
1.3.4. Drinking habits
Participants were asked if they had drunk alcohol in the past
30 days. For those who said they had drunk alcohol, information was
collected on the number of days they had drunk in the last 30 days and
C. Wraw et al.
Intelligence 69 (2018) 71–86
73
 the number of drinks they tended to have when they drank. These data
were used to construct a continuous variable that measured the number
of drinks participants had per week. Participants were also asked if they
had binge drunk (defined here as consumed 6 or more alcoholic drinks
on one occasion) in the last 30 days.
1.3.5. Oral care habits
Participants reported if and how often they brush and floss their
teeth in a typical week. Both measures of the frequency of oral care
behaviours were categorised, because they had multimodal distribu-
tions and recommended cut-off points were available (American Dental
Association, 2016). The measure of the frequency of teeth brushing was
broken into the following categories: not every day, at least once a day
but less than twice a day, and at least twice a day. The measure of the
frequency of flossing was broken into the following categories: never
flosses, floss on occasion (1 to 4 times a week), floss on most days (5 to
7 times a week), and floss more than once a day (> 7 times a week).
The American Dental Association recommends people brush their teeth
twice a day and floss once a day to prevent plaque build-up, tooth decay
and gum disease (American Dental Association, 2016). The categories
flossing 5 to 7 times a week and brushing at least twice a day most closely
matched the recommended guidelines and were selected as the re-
ference category.
1.4. Covariates
1.4.1. Childhood socioeconomic status
Childhood SES was a z-transformed composite variable of parental
income, education, and occupation status, which was derived by
Herrnstein and Murray. Higher scores on the childhood SES variable
indicate a more advantaged socio-economic position (Herrnstein &
Murray, 1994).
1.4.2. Adult socioeconomic status
Adult SES was a z-transformed composite measure of total net fa-
mily income and occupation status, as recorded in 2012. To be con-
sistent with Herrnstein and Murray (1994), income was logged and z-
transformed. It was also truncated to a minimum value of −4 for in-
come below $3162.45, which is the 2012 income equivalent to $1000
in 1979. Data on occupation were recorded in the US 3-digit, 2000
census codes (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015). These codes were then
used to derive the occupational status hierarchy by using a scale that
was developed by Hauser and Warren (1996). Hauser and Warren
(1996) is an updated version of the 1960 Duncan SEI scale that was
used by Herrnstein and Murray (1994) (Frederick, 2010). Occupation
status received a log transformation and was then z-scored.
1.5. Analyses
To test for linearity, generalized linear regression models were used
for the continuous outcome measures due to the skewed distribution of
their scores. These models were based on either the gamma or Poisson
distribution, depending on whichever distribution resulted in a better
fitting model. Binary and multinomial logistic regression models were
used for the categorised scores.
The associations between IQ and whether or not participants were
able to engage in each type of exercise and, for those who could do the
activity, the frequency with which each exercise was engaged in were
analysed. Another set of analyses analysed the associations between IQ
and whether or not each diet-related behaviour was engaged in and, for
those who reported they did engage in the behaviour, the frequency
with which each dietary behaviour was engaged in. Two additional
analyses tested for an association between IQ in youth and how often
participants read nutrition information and/or ingredients on food
packing. Further analyses tested for a link between IQ and whether or
not participants smoke and/or drink and, for those who engage in the
respective habit, if they binge drink and the frequency with which they
smoke and/or drink. The final set of analyses tested the relationship
between IQ and whether or not participants flossed their teeth and, if
they did floss, how frequently they flossed. The relationship between IQ
and how often participants brush their teeth was also tested.
For each of these analyses, there was a baseline model, which ad-
justed for age, sex, and ethnicity, a second model that also adjusted for
child SES, and a fully adjusted model, which also adjusted for adult-
hood SES. Childhood and adult SES were adjusted for because studies
have found childhood SES to confound some of the IQ-health behaviour
associations (Batty, Deary, Schoon, & Gale, 2006; O'Callaghan et al.,
2012; Osler et al., 2008; Wennerstad et al., 2010) but other studies did
not
(Batty,
Deary,
&
Macintyre,
2006;
Sjölund,
Hemmingsson,
Gustafsson, & Allebeck, 2015). Some studies have found adult SES to
partially mediate some IQ versus health behaviour associations (Batty
et al., 2008; Batty, Deary, Schoon, & Gale, 2006; Clouston et al., 2015;
Daly & Egan, 2017; Modig & Bergman, 2012; Sabbah & Sheiham, 2010).
The median of the pooled linear correlations and the estimated ef-
fect sizes, calculated from the odds ratios (Chinn, 2000), were used to
estimate the pooled summary effect size of the overall association be-
tween IQ and health behaviours.
2. Results
2.1. Characteristics of the sample
The original NLSY-79 sample consisted of 12,686 respondents. The
present study is based on the 5347 members who participated in the
2012 survey, 52% were female. The average age of the participants at
the time of interview was 51.7 years. Details of the respondents to the
2012 survey, including the percentage with missing data on all our
variables of interest, are shown in Table 1. The analyses that follow are
based on those with complete data for AFQT, age at interview, sex,
ethnicity, childhood SES, adult SES and the relevant health behaviour.
2.2. Intelligence in relation to health behaviours
Table 2 shows the distribution of the survey respondents across each
health behaviour outcome category and by AFQT tertile. In each case,
there is a significant difference in the distribution across IQ tertile by
outcome category. In many cases, those who reported engaging in less
healthy behaviours tended to be in a lower IQ tertile and vice-versa.
Supplementary table S1 shows how intelligence and childhood/adult
SES characteristics vary across the outcome categories for each of the
health behaviours. In most cases, higher intelligence and higher
childhood/adult SES were associated with healthier behaviours.
Table 3 shows the ORs for the relationship between intelligence in
youth and physical activity in middle age, both with and without ad-
justment for childhood SES and adult SES. The results of the likelihood
ratio tests confirm the overall statistical significance of the association
between IQ and the three measures of the frequency of activity. The
results of the logistic regressions found that higher intelligence is as-
sociated with increased odds of being able to engage in all three kinds
of physical activity. After adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity in the
baseline model, the odds ratio for being able to engage in the activity
ranged from 1.61 (95% CI 1.37 to 1.90) for strength training to 1.72
(95% CI 1.35 to 2.20) for moderate cardiovascular activity (Fig. 1).
Adjusting for childhood SES resulted in little change in the estimated
effect sizes. Adjusting for adult SES reduced the size of the ORs to 1.40
and 1.46, respectively, but all three associations remained significant.
The results in Table 3 also show that, across all three types of exercise, a
SD increment in IQ was associated with being less likely to be inactive
and with being less likely to do a lot of activity (Fig. 2). Relative to
doing a medium amount of strength training each week, a SD increment
in IQ was associated with being less likely to not do any (OR 0.69, 95%
CI 0.64 to 0.75) and with being less likely to do four or more sessions

 (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82) per week, in the baseline model. Ad-
justing for childhood SES led to slight attenuation of the effect sizes.
Upon adjusting for adult SES, the size of the ORs were reduced but the
majority of associations remained significant. The extent of the at-
tenuation was heterogeneous across outcome category for amount of
strength training and vigorous activity. For example, compared to doing
a medium amount of strength training there was more attenuation of
the estimated effect size for doing no sessions per week (71%) than
there was for doing four or more sessions per week (12%).

 between intelligence and dietary habits are displayed in Table 4. In the
baseline model, higher IQ scores were associated with being more likely
to skip a meal (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17) and snack between meals
(OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.50), and less likely to have had a sugary
drink (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.80) in the past week (Fig. 1). IQ was
not associated with the frequency of eating fast food or snacking
between meals over the past week. In the basic model, a SD increment
in IQ was associated with drinking fewer sugary drinks in the past week
(B = −0.15, 95% CI -0.20 to −0.10) (adjusting for age, sex, and eth-
nicity) (Fig. 3). A non-linear association was found between IQ in youth
and the number of meals that were skipped in the past week in the
baseline model. Higher IQ was associated with skipping more meals for

meals for the upper half of IQ scores (Fig. 3). Adjusting for childhood
SES resulted in little change in any of the effect sizes. Adjusting for
adult SES attenuated the effect for having had a sugary drink and the
amount of sugary drinks consumed to the null. The non-linear asso-
ciation was attenuated upon adjusting for adult SES but statistical sig-
nificance was maintained.

 between intelligence and reading food labels. In the basic model (ad-
justing for age, sex, and ethnicity), higher IQ scores were associated
with being more likely to read both nutritional information (OR 1.20,
95% CI 1.09 to 1.31) and ingredients (OR 1.24, 1.12 to 1.36) often,
compared to always, and with being less likely to never read both nu-
tritional information (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.58) and ingredients
(OR 0.60, 95% 0.55 to 0.67) (Fig. 2). Adjusting for childhood SES re-
sulted in little change in effect sizes. Adjusting for adult SES led to
slightly more attenuation, with the majority of associations remaining
significant. The results of the likelihood ratio tests confirm the overall
statistical significance of the association between IQ and the frequency
of reading food labels.
The ORs and Bs from the analyses between intelligence and drinking
and smoking behaviours are presented in Table 6. In the baseline model
(adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity), a SD increment in intelligence in
youth was associated with increased odds of having had a drink (OR
1.58, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.69) in the past month and with reduced odds of
having had > 6 drinks on one occasion (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.74)
in the past 30 days (Fig. 1). Adjusting for adult SES resulted in marked
attenuation of both estimated effect sizes, though statistical significance
at conventional levels was maintained in both cases. A non-linear as-
sociation was found between a SD increment in IQ and number of
drinks consumed per week, excluding those who don't drink, in the
baseline model (adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity) (Fig. 3). Higher IQ
was associated with having fewer drinks per week for the lower half of
IQ scores. For the upper half of IQ scores, higher IQ was associated with
having more alcoholic drinks per week. Including childhood SES in the
model resulted in no attenuation, and including adult SES only slightly
reduced the effect sizes.
In the baseline model, a SD increment in intelligence in youth was
associated with reduced odds of being a smoker (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.56
to 0.65) (Table 6 & Fig. 1). A non-linear association was found between
a SD increment in IQ and number of cigarettes smoked a day, excluding
those who do not smoke (Table 6 & Fig. 3). A higher IQ is associated
with smoking more cigarettes a day for the lower half of IQ scores and it
is associated with smoking fewer cigarettes a day for the upper half of
IQ scores. Adjusting for childhood SES had almost no impact on the
estimated effect sizes. Adjusting for adult SES resulted in slight at-
tenuation but statistical significance was maintained.
Table 7 shows the results of the analyses between intelligence and
oral health care behaviours. Adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, a SD
increment in IQ was associated with being more likely to floss (OR 1.47,
95% CI 1.35 to 1.59). In the baseline model, compared to flossing 5 to 7
times a week, a SD increment in IQ was associated with being less likely
to never floss (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.70) and to floss more than
once a day (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.87) (Fig. 2). In the baseline
model (adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity), higher IQ was associated
with reduced odds of brushing less than twice a day (OR 0.90, 95% CI
0.83 to 0.96) and less than once a day (OR 0.55, 95% 0.44 to 0.68),
compared to brushing teeth at least twice a day (Fig. 2). Including
childhood SES led to some attenuation, most notably for the frequency
of brushing teeth. Including adult SES in the model led to attenuation,
and the associations between IQ and frequency of teeth brushing were
no longer significant.
The median of the pooled linear correlations and the estimated ef-
fect sizes, calculated from the odds ratios (Chinn, 2000) was used as a
measure of the pooled summary estimate of the overall association
between IQ and health behaviours. This pooled estimate was 0.12 with
a standard error of 0.03.
3. Discussion
In the present study, higher intelligence in youth was associated
with a number of different healthy behaviours in middle age. Looking
first at physical activity, higher intelligence was associated with both
being more likely to be able to engage in all three kinds of physical

 activity and with being less likely to take either none or a lot of each
type of activity, relative to taking some activity. Looking at the results
for oral health habits, higher IQ was linked with being more likely to
brush at least twice a day and to floss on most days. Higher IQ was also
linked with reading the ingredients and nutritional information when
shopping for new food items often compared to always. Higher in-
telligence was also linked with being less likely to smoke, less likely to
consume 6 or more alcoholic drinks on one occasion, and with con-
suming fewer sugary drinks.
A number of novel associations were also found between higher
intelligence and behaviours that may or may not be linked with poorer
health outcomes (i.e. skipping meals and snacking between meals).
Higher intelligence was linked with being more likely to have skipped a
meal and snacked between meals. An inverted-u shaped association was
also found between higher intelligence and the number of meals
skipped. Higher IQ was linked with skipping more meals for the lower
half of the IQ scores but it was associated with skipping fewer meals for
the upper half of the IQ range. The health consequences of skipping
meals and snacking between meals are not well understood. Mesas,
Muñoz-Pareja, López-García, and Rodríguez-Artalejo (2012) conducted
a systematic review of studies that investigated the association between
selected eating behaviours (including skipping meals and snacking
between meals) and BMI. They concluded that there is inconsistent
evidence of the relationship between these eating behaviours and BMI.
For instance, out of the 15 studies that tested the association between
skipping meals, mainly breakfast, and BMI in adulthood, 10 studies
found it was linked with a higher BMI but five studies found no asso-
ciation. The only eating behaviour that had a consistent relationship
with BMI was snacking. The nine studies that investigated this asso-
ciation found snacking was linked with a higher BMI. Mesas et al.
(2012) did not run a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of the
measures and models that were included in the reviewed studies, in-
cluding those studies that looked at skipping meals and snacking be-
tween meals. The inverted U-shaped association between IQ and
number of meals skipped is difficult to interpret because only those who
reported they had skipped a meal were asked about number of meals
skipped so some respondents may have been differentially excluded
from the analytical sample.
Associations were also found between IQ and behaviours that are
known to be linked with poor health outcomes (i.e. drinking alcohol
and the number of cigarettes smoked).
First, higher intelligence was linked with being more likely to have
consumed alcohol in the past 30 days. A u-shaped association was found
between intelligence and the number of alcoholic drinks consumed a
week. The results suggest a different pattern of drinking for those with a
higher versus lower intelligence. The former may engage in more
moderate drinking behaviours and drink frequently throughout the
week but only have few units on each occasion. The latter may engage
in more risky drinking behaviours and drink infrequently throughout
the week but consume a high amount of alcohol on each occasion.
The J-shaped relationship that is observed between alcohol con-
sumption and premature mortality was thought to suggest that low to
moderate levels of alcohol consumption had health protective benefits
(O'Keefe et al., 2012), however this is no longer thought to be the case.
More recently, the results from a mendelian randomisation meta-ana-
lysis of 56 epidemiological studies (n = 261,991) suggests that ab-
staining from drinking alcohol and, amongst drinkers, lower levels of
alcohol consumption is linked with a reduced risk of cardiovascular
disease. There was no evidence to support the J-shaped link between
alcohol consumption and mortality (Holmes et al., 2014). Alcohol
consumption is also linked with cancer. Pelucchi, Tramacere, Boffetta,
Negri, and Vecchia (2011) reviewed the literature on the links between
alcohol consumption and different cancers. They found that both high
and low weekly alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancer,
compared to abstainers or occasional drinkers. For example, high
amounts of alcohol consumption (> 4 drinks a day) is linked with an
increased risk of oral and pharynx cancer (relative risk (rr, 95% CI)
5.24, 95% CI 4.36 to 6.30), based on 31 studies, and cancer of the
oesophagus (4.89, 3.84 to 6.23), based on 39 studies. Low amounts of
alcohol also increased the risk of these cancers with a relative risk of
1.21 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.33), based on 20 studies, and 1.31 (95% CI 1.10
to 1.57), based on 26 studies, respectively. The evidence suggests that
both high and low amounts of alcohol consumption can increase the
risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Second, the inverted-u shaped association between intelligence and
the number of cigarettes smoked suggests that, for those in the lower
50% of IQ scores, a SD increment in IQ is linked with smoking more
cigarettes a day and for those in the higher 50% of IQ scores, a SD
increment in IQ is linked with smoking fewer cigarettes a day. Cigarette
smoking is linked with multiple adverse health risk (Saha, Bhalla,
Whayne, & Gairola, 2007). Those in the upper 50% of IQ scores may
believe that smoking fewer cigarettes is less detrimental to health. A
recent systematic review with a meta analysis of 141 studies found that
smoking just one cigarette a day, relative to smoking 20 a day, carries
with it a notable increased risk of both coronary heart disease and
stroke. For example, men and women who smoked just one cigarette a
day had 46% and 31% of the excess risk, respectively, of developing
coronary heart disease of those who smoke 20 cigarettes a day. The
article concludes that there are no safe levels of smoking for cardio-
vascular outcomes (Hackshaw, Morris, Boniface, Tang, & Milkenkovic,
2018). The inverted U-shaped association between IQ and number of
cigarettes smoked is difficult to interpret because this association is
based only on those who reported they do smoke so some respondents
may have been differentially excluded from the analytical sample.
3.1. Confounding and mediating
Regarding possible confounding effects of early life circumstances,
the associations in the present study appeared to be largely independent
of early life socio-economic position. In most cases, adult SES appeared
to account for some of the association between IQ and the different
health behaviours. There were three notable findings regarding med-
iation by adult SES. First, after adjusting for adult SES the associations
with brushing teeth and sugary drinks were substantially attenuated
and were no longer significant. This might suggest that IQ in youth
influences these outcomes via adult SES. Second, adjusting for adult SES
had no attenuating effect on whether or not people skipped meals or
snacked between meals; instead, the effect size slightly increased upon
adjustment. This suggests that early life IQ influences these outcomes
independently of adult SES. Third, after including adult SES in the
models that analysed the amount of strength training and vigorous
activity, the extent of the attenuation was different across outcome
category. The attenuation was greater for being inactive than it was for
doing a lot of activity. For example, the respective attenuations for
strength training were 71% compared to 12%.
3.2. Comparison with other studies
Many of the present findings are consistent with previous studies
that also found higher IQ to be linked with more health enhancing
physical activity habits (Batty, Deary, Schoon, & Gale, 2006; Clouston
et al., 2015; Osler et al., 2008). The present study is the first that we are
aware of to find that higher intelligence in youth was associated with
lower chances of being either inactive or doing a lot of activity, com-
pared to taking some activity in middle age. The study by O'Callaghan
et al. (2012) found an inverted u-shaped relationship between IQ and
amount of vigorous activity, with higher IQ associated with moderate
amounts of activity. However, the direction of the relationship could
not be determined from their study because both IQ and physical ac-
tivity was measured at the same time (O'Callaghan et al., 2012). The
findings of an association between higher intelligence in youth and
moderate amounts of strength training in middle age were novel to the

 present study.
Of the few previous studies that investigated the association be-
tween early life IQ and dietary choices, most found higher IQ to be
linked with healthier dietary choices, which is consistent with the
present finding that higher IQ was linked with consuming fewer sugary
drinks (Batty, Deary, Schoon, & Gale, 2006; Crichton et al., 2015;
Kanazawa, 2013; Osler et al., 2008). A study by Lyerly and Reeve
(2014) was the most comparable to the present study because it was
also based on data from the NLSY-79. The measure of general in-
telligence used in their study was derived from the first un-rotated
principal component of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Bat-
tery. They included three of the same measures of dietary habits that
were in the present study (frequency with which participants consumed
fast food and sugary drinks and how often they skipped meals in the
past 7 days). Although Lyerly and Reeve reported that intelligence was
not associated with any of the dietary habits, the validity of their
conclusions are questionable due to the methodological limitations of
their study design, which were previously outlined. Consistent with the
Lyerly and Reeves study, the present study did not find a link between
IQ and eating fast food. Unlike the Lyerly and Reeves study, the present
study found a negative association with the frequency of consuming
sugary drinks and an inverted-u shaped association with the number of
meals skipped. The current findings that those who had higher mental
ability in adolescence were more likely to often and less likely to never
read food labels when purchasing an item for the first time, compared
to always reading this information, were novel to the present study.
The observed associations between higher IQ and being less likely to
abstain from drinking (Osler et al., 2008 and less likely to engage in
binge drinking (Sjölund, Hemmingsson, Gustafsson, & Allebeck, 2015;
Cheng et al., 2010) are consistent with the results observed in previous
studies. To the best of our knowledge, the observed U-shaped associa-
tion between IQ and the amount of alcoholic drinks consumed per week
is novel. This non-linear association could help to explain the mixed
results observed between IQ and drinking behaviour in previous studies
(Sjölund, Hemmingsson, & Allebeck, 2015; Osler et al., 2008; Batty,
Deary, & Macintyre, 2006; Clouston et al., 2015; Cheng & Furnham,
2013. The positive association between IQ and alcohol consumption in
the upper 50% of IQ scores is consistent with findings of a positive
association between IQ and drinking more frequently and having a
higher intake of alcohol (Batty, Deary, & Macintyre, 2006; Cheng &
Furnham, 2013; Clouston et al., 2015; Osler et al., 2008). The negative
association between IQ and alcohol in the lower 50% of scores is con-
sistent with findings lower IQ to be linked with heavy versus light
drinking (Sjölund, Hemmingsson, & Allebeck, 2015). A limitation of
these previous studies is that they did not look at the number of drinks
consumed as a continuous measure, as was done in the present study.
Future studies could look for a non-linear IQ-drinking association in
cohorts from different countries. There are two primary reasons to in-
vestigate this. First, country to country variation in the IQ-drinking
behaviour association has been found (Batty, Deary, & Macintyre, 2006;
Cheng & Furnham, 2013; Clouston et al., 2015; Osler et al., 2008;
Sjölund, Hemmingsson, & Allebeck, 2015). Second, drinking beha-
viours are known to be influenced by societal norms and attitudes to-
wards drinking (Peele, 1997).
Finding higher IQ to be linked with a lower chance of being a
current smoker is consistent with findings in previous studies (Osler
et al., 2008; Wennerstad et al., 2010; Batty, Deary, Schoon, & Gale,
2006).The inverted u-shaped association between higher IQ and
quantity of cigarettes smoked was novel to this study.
Two previous studies analysed the association between intelligence
and oral health (Der et al., 2009; Sabbah & Sheiham, 2010). However,
the study by Sabbah and Sheiham (2010) was cross sectional and nei-
ther study looked at the association with oral care habits. The findings
of a positive association between IQ in youth and frequency of teeth
brushing and flossing regularly in middle age, and the inverted u-
shaped association with frequency of flossing are all novel to the
present study.
The results observed in the present study that are inconsistent with
the general findings in cognitive epidemiology (i.e. higher intelligence
is linked with healthier behaviours and better health outcomes), which
where the associations between higher intelligence and both skipping
meals and snacking between meals as well as the u-shaped association
between IQ and alcohol consumption and the inverted u-shaped asso-
ciations between IQ and both number of meals skipped and cigarettes
smoked, require further investigation. Future research could test for
possible mediating factors that can help to explain these novel findings.
One possible explanation for the present findings suggests that adult
SES mediates some of the association between intelligence in adoles-
cence and health behaviours in middle age. One possible explanation
for this is that individuals with a higher IQ tend to have access to higher
status jobs and higher income (Cheng & Furnham, 2013; Herrnstein &
Murray, 1994; Johnson, Gow, Corley, Starr, & Deary, 2010; Strenze,
2007), which results in more resources that could be invested into a
healthier lifestyle. It is important to explain why education was not
adjusted for as an indicator of adult SES in the present study. Education
tends to correlate strongly with intelligence. For example Strenze
(2007) conducted a meta analysis and found early life intelligence and
educational
attainment
in
adulthood
correlated
with
r = 0.56
(n = 26,504), which suggests that much of the variability in educa-
tional attainment may be explained by variability in early life in-
telligence. It has also been suggested that education acts as a surrogate
for aspects of early life intelligence because the two factors are so
strongly correlated and share common genetic influences (Davies et al.,
2016; Deary & Johnson, 2010; Hagenaars et al., 2016; Johnson, Deary,
Silventoinen, Tynelius, & Rasmussen, 2010).
Another possible explanation for the present IQ-health behaviour
associations is that more intelligent people are better equipped to pay
attention to, internalise and respond to health promotion messages,
which inform the public about healthy behaviours that help to prevent
chronic health problems (Gottfredson & Deary, 2004; Taylor et al.,
2003). Consistent with this is the definition of intelligence as the ability
to
learn,
reason,
solve
novel
problems,
and
think
abstractly
(Gottfredson, 1997; Gottfredson & Deary, 2004). Managing one's own
health and preventing disease is a complex task that depends upon
these cognitive abilities (Gottfredson & Deary, 2004). The non-linear
associations between IQ and both exercise and flossing frequency may
highlight that more intelligent people are most likely to do moderate
amounts of these behaviours, which are linked with well-known health
benefits (American Dental Association, 2016; Candow & Burke, 2007;
O'Keefe et al., 2012; U.S Department of Health and Human Services,
2008; Wen et al., 2011; Wernbom et al., 2007). Engaging in high
amounts of physical activity is thought to be linked with no clear ad-
ditional health benefits and/or health damaging consequences (Lee,
Morrison, Isserow, Heilbron, & Krahn, 2016; Seidl & Asplund, 2014;
Candow & Burke, 2007; Wernbom et al., 2007). Engaging in exessive
amounts of oral hygiene behaviours can lead to tooth damage and can
be a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder (Arora, Shahi, Sharma,
Philip, & Pal Singh, 2013).
The few cases where higher IQ was linked with either unhealthy
behaviours or behaviours that aren't clearly linked with better health
were inconsistent with the explanation previously discussed. These
outcomes were the U-shaped association between IQ and quantity of
alcohol consumed, the inverted U-shaped association between IQ and
number of cigarettes smoked, and the inverted U-shaped association
between IQ and number of meals skipped, which were not explained by
adult SES. More research is needed to help identify possible factors that
help to mediate these relationships.
In addition to looking more closely at behaviours that are linked
with non-communicable diseases, future research in cognitive epide-
miology could also focus on the associations between IQ and behaviours
associated with infectious disease such as HIV. Poor health literacy,
regarding HIV, has been cited as one of the possible factors that

Intelligence 69 (2018) 71–86
83
 contributes to the spread of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa
(Oesterdiekhoff & Rindermann, 2007). Higher levels of education have
been liked with better adherence to HIV treatment (Goldman & Smith,
2002). There is evidence that health literacy is a sub-component of
general intelligence and education is known to correlate strongly with
and may be a partial proxy for intelligence (Hagenaars et al., 2016;
Herrnstein & Murray, 1994; Reeve & Basalik, 2014; Murray, 1998;
Strenze, 2007). Intelligence may therefore be a factor that influences
the spread and management of HIV in the population.
3.3. Strength & weaknesses
This study has a number of strengths. First, there is almost a 30-year
gap between the measure of intelligence in youth and the measured
health behaviours in middle age, so it is unlikely that the measure of
intelligence was influenced by poor health or poor health habits in
middle age. Second, the study was based on a large and representative
sample of middle age American men and women (Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2012. Third, a greater breadth and more detailed measures of
health behaviours were included in the present study than have been
included in previous studies (Batty, Deary, & Macintyre, 2007; Batty,
Deary, Schoon, & Gale, 2006; Clouston et al., 2015; Daly & Egan, 2017;
Modig & Bergman, 2012; Sjölund et al., 2011; Sjölund, Hemmingsson,
Gustafsson, & Allebeck, 2015; Taylor et al., 2003; Wennerstad et al.,
2010). A fourth strength was the inclusion of self-reported measures of
physical activity, dietary habits, drinking and smoking behaviours that
have good criterion validity (Craig et al., 2003; Sabia et al., 2013; Sallis
& Saelens, 2000; Cade, Burley, Warm, Thompson, & Margetts, 2004; Del
Boca & Darkes, 2003; Patrick et al., 1994). A fifth strength was that the
questions that measured oral health care were consistent with the
WHO's recommendations for self-reported questions in surveys on oral
health risk factors (World Health Organization, 2013).
This study had some limitations. First, there are a high number of
missing data for total net family income. Because of this, the number of
observations that made up the analytical samples was reduced; how-
ever the numbers were still large. Second, due to the socially sensitive
nature of the questions on health behaviours, these questions are vul-
nerable to socially desirable responses where people will overestimate
social desirable behaviours and underestimate socially undesirable be-
haviours (van de Mortel et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2010; Klesges et al.,
2004; Motl, McAuley, & DiStefano, 2005; Dumitrescu, Kawamura,
Toma, & Lascu, 2007; Tooze et al., 2004). This tends to decrease the
validity of the scale and increase error in measurement. It was not
possible to adjust for social desirability bias in the present study be-
cause the NLSY-79 2012 survey did not include a social desirability
scale. Third, the responses to the two questions about reading nutri-
tional labels were based on a likert scale. People who score lower on
mental tests are more likely to have an extreme response style, which is
the tendency to select response at one of the end-points of the scale (i.e.
always or never) rather than selecting moderate responses (i.e. often,
sometimes, or rarely) (Batchelor & Miao, 2016). This could have biased
the present results.
4. Conclusion
The present study found evidence of links between higher IQ and a
number of more favourable health related habits (i.e. engaging in
physical activity, nutritional literacy, and oral hygiene habits, as well as
not smoking, binge dinking, or consuming sugary drinks), which were
largely independent of childhood SES, and often survived adjustment
for adult socio-economic position. These findings, support the notion
that certain health behaviours may lie on a pathway that links in-
telligence in early life with various health outcomes in adulthood. The
few studies that have adjusted for health behaviours as a potential
mediator found little to no attenuation of the estimated effect size of IQ
on mortality (Batty, Deary, & Macintyre, 2006; Kuh, Richards, et al.,
2004; Jokela, Batty, Deary, Gale, & Kivimäki, 2009. This might be be-
cause the majority of these studies are based on relatively young co-
horts who have only been followed up into middle age. It is possible
that health behaviours could mediate associations between IQ in youth
and morbidity and mortality in old age. As the cohorts age, future
studies could adjust for a range of health behaviours as a potential
mediator of the IQ-morbidity/mortality association. In contrast to
finding higher IQ to be linked with healthier behaviours, a few asso-
ciations were identified between intelligence and behaviours that may
or may not be linked with poor health (i.e. skipping meals & snacking
between meals) and with behaviours that are known to be linked with
poor health (i.e. drinking alcohol and the number of cigarettes smoked
per day). More research into these findings, which are novel to this
study, is required.
