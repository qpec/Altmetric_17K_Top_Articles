Abstract: Smoking is a complex environmental exposure influenced by genetic, environmen-
tal, and social factors. Nicotine is the principal alkaloid in tobacco that mediates the addicting 
effects of tobacco products. Tobacco is a mixture of more than 7,000 chemicals, and smok-
ing is recognized as a risk factor for many diseases in humans, including cardiovascular and 
pulmonary disease and several cancers, and is the single most preventable cause of mortality 
worldwide. A number of inflammatory immune-related conditions have been associated with 
smoking, including psoriasis. Smoking affects the onset of psoriasis. In a pooled analysis of 
25 case–control studies, the odds ratio of psoriasis among smokers was 1.78 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.53–2.06). A dose–effect relationship is also documented. In a pooled analysis 
of three cohort studies, the risk of incident psoriasis was 1.81 (95% CI: 1.38–2.36) in those 
who smoked 1–14 cigarettes per day, and 2.29 (95% CI: 1.74–3.01) in those who smoked ≥25 
cigarettes per day. Smoking also impacts on the clinical severity of psoriasis, its response to 
treatment, and explains some of the associated comorbidities, eg, cardiovascular disease, inflam-
matory bowel disease, and several cancers (especially those of the respiratory tract). Data on 
the role of smoking in psoriatic arthritis are less consistent compared with those concerning 
psoriasis. Several pathophysiological mechanisms may explain the association of psoriasis with 
smoking, including oxidative stress, interaction with signaling pathways active in psoriasis, and 
vascular influences. In conclusion, psoriasis is just one of the many diseases associated with 
smoking, but it is visible and disabling. Dermatologists could play a major role in reducing the 
health burden of smoking by influencing the patients to change their behavior.

Smoking: a complex environmental exposure and a 
threat to health
Smoking is the most common way of consuming tobacco, and tobacco is the substance 
most commonly smoked. Tobacco contains the alkaloid nicotine, which is a stimulant 
that can lead to dependence. It has been estimated that about one out of three people 
who have ever attempted to smoke become usual smokers.1
Smoking is a complex environmental exposure influenced by behavioral models and 
values. Smoking tobacco among natives in Americas had been a social and ceremonial 
activity. Tobacco was imported to Europe in the late 16th century, and tobacco smoking 
became increasing popular after the development of the automated cigarette-rolling 
apparatus at the end of the 19th century. In the early 1960, it reached its peak, and the 
rates of tobacco consumption started declining thereafter in the developed countries

as a consequence of educational campaigns and restriction 
on smoking in public places. However, the rates continue to 
rise in developing countries.2
Cigarette smoking is recognized as a risk factor for 
several diseases in humans, and it remains the single most 
important source of preventable global mortality. The 
association of smoking with major cardiovascular disease, 
chronic obstructive lung disease, peptic ulcer, and several 
cancers (particularly those of the respiratory tract) is well 
established.3–5 In addition, smoking has been linked with a 
number of chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, 
including psoriasis.6
Tobacco smokers are exposed to a mixture of over 7,000 
chemicals, distributed in a particulate and a vapor phase 
(Table 1).7 The composition may vary with the cigarette 
model and brand.
Nicotine is the main alkaloid in tobacco, and it is respon-
sible for the addicting effects of tobacco smoking. Nicotine 
is quickly absorbed not only through the alveolar spaces in 
the lung but also through the skin and the intestinal mucosa. 
It is metabolized mainly by the liver to several metabolites, 
some of which maintain pharmacological activity.8,9 Nicotine 
acts on various subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. 
They are found not only in the nervous system and adrenal 
medulla, but have also been identified in other tissues, such as 
skin keratinocytes and inflammatory cells, eg, monocytes and 
dendritic cells. The interaction between nicotine and nico-
tinic acetylcholine receptors results in an initial temporary 
activation of ganglionic transmission, followed by a lasting 
depression (biphasic effect), and also results in the release 
of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and postgangli-
onic sympathetic neurons. The role of nicotine in the skin 
and inflammatory cells is less clearly delineated. It might 
facilitate keratinocyte adhesion and upward migration in 
the epidermis, and may have an immunomodulatory effect.10
Among other substances, 1,3-butadiene carries the high-
est risk of cancer; acrolein and acetaldehyde are main respira-
tory irritants; and arsenic, cyanide, and cresols are leading 
sources of cardiovascular risk. Inflammatory processes can 
also be affected by smoking. Chronic exposure to benzo(a)
pyrene induces dose-related decreases in the mass of lym-
phoid tissue, and the unsaturated aldehyde acrolein appears to 
affect the neutrophil function.11 The effects of smoking can be 
modulated by sex. A meta-analysis documented that females 
have a higher risk compared to males of overall morbidity and 
mortality associated with smoking at any level of exposure.12
After the recognition of the adverse effects of smoking 
in the early 1960s, the tobacco producers started develop-
ing cigarettes with low tar and nicotine machine-measured 
yields.13 These changes over the last six decades did not 
have an impact on the overall morbidity and mortality from 
smoking and may have even interfered with attempts to quit 
smoking by the public and with preventive campaigns.14
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-powered 
vaporizers that simulate the feeling of smoking, but without 
burning tobacco. Their use is commonly called “vaping”. 
E-cigarette liquids are typically solutions of glycerol and/or 
propylene glycol, nicotine, and flavors. The benefits and the 
health risks of e-cigarettes are uncertain.15,16 They can help 
people quit smoking, but they have not been proven better 
than regulated medication. It has been shown that hemiacetals 
containing formaldehyde can be formed during the “vaping” 
process, which may carry risk of cancer. These results are 
still debated.17
Tobacco dependence is influenced by a variety of envi-
ronmental and genetic factors. The same factors may, in turn, 
play some causal role in smoking-related diseases.18 The risk 
of becoming a smoker has been associated with a lower socio-
economic status, with peer smoking, and even with maternal 
smoking during pregnancy.19 A substantial hereditary compo-
nent has been associated with selected features of smoking 
habits, such as age at initiation and intensity of smoking, with

heritability estimates in twin studies, ranging from <0.3 to 
>0.8.20,21 A meta-analysis has suggested that heritability of 
smoking habits may vary with sex, with a higher heritability 
component for smoking initiation in females and a higher 
heritability component for persistence in males.22 Smoking 
persistence and the ability to stop smoking may have an even 
stronger genetic component. Molecular studies have been 
conducted to assess genetic traits associated with smoking 
habits. Candidate gene studies have particularly focused 
on genetic variations in neurotransmitter pathways and 
nicotine-metabolizing enzymes. The candidate genes with the 
 
strongest evidence of an association with smoking behavior 
are CYP2A6, 5HTT and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 
the CHRNA5/A3/B4 gene cluster.23
Cigarette smoking as a risk factor 
for the onset of psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects 
~3% of the general population. It is clinically heterogeneous, 
with distinct, partly overlapping phenotypes, including 
chronic plaque, guttate, erythrodermic, and pustular variet-
ies. Incident psoriasis has been linked with smoking habits 
in both case–control and cohort studies (Figure 1). Ideally, 
assessment of risks should be done separately for each clinical 
variant. This has been rarely done.
In a meta-analysis,24 a total of 25 case–control studies and 
four cohort studies were analyzed. In case–control studies, 
pooled odds ratio (OR) of psoriasis among smokers was 1.78 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53–2.06). Metaregression 
did not reveal any significant sources of heterogeneity. The 
analysis of the association between psoriasis and a history of 
former smoking, including seven studies, found a pooled OR 
of 1.62 (95% CI: 1.33–1.98) for psoriasis in former smok-
ers.24 Few studies provided data on duration and intensity of 
smoking in relation to psoriasis.
As for cohort studies, a pooled analysis of data from 
three studies, namely, the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), the 
Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II), and the Health Profes-
sionals’ Follow-Up Study, gave a pooled OR for psoriasis of 
1.94 (95% CI: 1.64–2.28). Data from the General Practice 
Research Database study provided similar results with OR 
for psoriasis in current smokers of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.31–1.59). 
Pooled analysis of the three aforementioned cohort studies 
also gave evidence of an association of the risk of psoriasis 
with smoking intensity and duration. The risk of incident 
psoriasis was 1.81 (95% CI: 1.38–2.36) in those who smoked 
1–14 cigarettes per day and 2.29 (95% CI: 1.74–3.01) in those 
who smoked ≥25 cigarettes per day. While the risk of psoriasis 
in subjects with smoking duration <10 years was almost the 
same as nonsmokers, those with a smoking duration ≥30 
years had nearly twice the risk of nonsmokers (adjusted OR: 
1.99, 95% CI: 1.75–2.25). The population-attributable risk 
of smoking for incident psoriasis was 15% in the NHS II 
cohort and 20% in the NHS cohort.24 A case–control study 
provided data on the risk of incident psoriasis according to 
sex. It showed variations between the sexes, with an OR for

smoking 15 cigarettes or more of 3.2 in women and 1.6 in 
men. In the study, the OR for pustular lesions in smokers was 
9.9.25 Tobacco smoking has been strongly associated with 
palmoplantar pustulosis, a condition that is now considered 
separate from psoriasis.26
Recent data, mainly from Chinese investigators, point to a 
possible interaction between smoking and genes involved in 
psoriasis susceptibility or smoking habits.27–30 A case–control 
study showed that the risk of psoriasis for the combination 
of being a smoker and carrying the aplotype HLA-Cw6 was 
approximately 11-fold higher compared with nonsmokers 
without HLA-Cw6.27 Another study showed interaction 
between single-nucleotide polymorphisms at locus CSMD1, 
a tumor-suppressor gene expressed in areas of regenerative 
growth, and cigarette smoking.28 Another study found an 
interaction between smoking and the gene for CYP1A1, 
a member of the cytochrome P450 family involved in the 
metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced 
during tobacco combustion.30
Several pathophysiological mechanisms may explain the 
association of smoking with psoriasis.31 Smoking causes 
oxidative stress and production of dangerous free radicals, 
interfering with signal pathways relevant in psoriasis such 
as mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor kappa B 
(NF-κB), and JAK-STAT pathways. Nicotine also induces an 
increased secretion of several cytokines such as  interleukin 
(IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-2, and granulocyte-
monocyte colony-stimulating factor, which play a crucial role 
in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.32 In vitro studies in human 
HaCaT keratinocytes have shown that the increased expres-
sion and secretion of TNF due to cigarette smoke extract 
is mediated by the increased expression, promoter activity 
and nuclear translocation of the  Egr-1 transcription factor, 
a protein, and a transcription factor encoded by the EGR1 
gene.33 It has also been documented that the expression of 
vascular endothelial growth factor, an important element in 
angiogenesis, can be modified by smoking.34
The role of smoking in comorbidities 
and prognosis of psoriasis
Not only has smoking been associated with the onset of 
psoriasis but it has also been linked with the severity of the 
disease and response to treatment. An Italian cross-sectional 
study documented that patients smoking >20 cigarettes 
daily had a twofold increased risk of presenting with severe 
psoriasis than smokers of less than ten cigarettes daily.35 In 
a study of male psoriatic patients, smoking more than ten 
cigarettes per day was significantly associated with increased 
severity especially on the extremities.36 Similarly, another 
study found a more severe skin involvement in smokers than 
in nonsmokers and also a reduced likelihood of experiencing 
periods of disease remission.37 Negative results also exist. A 
retrospective study of 66 psoriatic patients did not show any 
significant difference between smokers and nonsmokers in 
Physician Global Assessment after 3–16 months of systemic 
treatment, nor in the average number of systemic treatments 
tried per patient.38 It should be noted that the study was under-
powered to see even a large-to-moderate effect of smoking.
A recent systematic review of adherence to treatment 
in patients with psoriasis identified three studies assessing 
the role of smoking for adherence.39 Two studies reported 
adherence to be greater for nonsmokers compared with 
smokers, while another study reported no association. Larger 
prospective studies are warranted in this area. Interestingly, 
in a series of 110 psoriatic patients treated with anti-TNF, 
smoking together with increased body mass index and a high 
baseline psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score was a 
risk factor for a lack of response to the treatment.40
A few data on genetic–environmental interaction exist for 
the relationship between severity of psoriasis and smoking. 
A hospital-based case–control study of 672 subjects showed 
a combined effect of rs6474412 genotype (TT) and smoking 
behavior on disease severity (OR for severe disease: 5.95; 
95% CI: 1.39–25.31).41
Many of the comorbidities associated with psoriasis can 
be related, at least partly, with smoking. They include car-
diovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and 
several cancers (especially those of the respiratory tract).42,43
Data on the role of smoking in psoriatic arthritis are less 
consistent compared with those concerning psoriasis. Sparse 
evidence regarding the association between smoking and 
psoriatic arthritis has been published. One study showed that 
smoking may accelerate the onset of arthritis in patients with 
psoriasis, while it may delay the onset of arthritis in healthy 
participants.44 Another case–control study did not find an 
increased risk of psoriatic arthritis among smokers with psoria-
sis.45 A larger cohort study based on the NHS II (1991–2005) 
documented that smoking was associated with an elevated risk 
of incident psoriatic arthritis, with a relative risk of 1.54 (95% 
CI: 1.06–2.24) for past smokers and 3.13 (95% CI: 2.08–4.71) 
for current smokers. With increasing smoking duration or 
number of cigarettes smoked, the risk of psoriatic arthritis 
increased monotonically. The increase in risk was particularly 
significant for patients with more severe phenotypes.46

tis. An analysis of data from the Bath longitudinal cohort

Psoriasis and smoking
 
involving 267 patients with psoriatic arthritis and disease 
duration ≥10 years showed that smoking, delay of diagnosis, 
older age at diagnosis, and female sex were all associated with 
worse physical function.47 Data from the Danish DANBIO 
registry, including 1,148 patients with psoriatic arthritis and 
known smoking status, documented that smokers had worse 
baseline patient-reported outcomes, shorter treatment adher-
ence, and poorer response to TNF compared to nonsmokers, 
with a more pronounced effect in men and in patients treated 
with infliximab or etanercept.48
Recent epidemiological studies showed that periodon-
titis could represent an independent risk factor for incident 
psoriasis.49 The pathogenesis of psoriasis and periodontal 
disease is linked with common immune-related pathways. 
In a hospital-based case–control study enrolling 82 psoriatic 
patients and 89 controls, periodontal disease was linked with 
psoriasis (OR: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.11–17.16]), and the risk of 
severe periodontal disease among psoriatic patients was six 
times higher in smokers than that in nonsmokers.50
Smoking has been linked with the risk of severe infec-
tions in patients treated with systemic agents for psoriasis. 
In a cohort study of systemically treated patients, the hazard 
ratio (HR) of severe infections in smokers was 1.43 (95% 
CI: 1.08–1.88) compared with nonsmokers.51
Psoriasis is an emerging paradoxical side effect of anti-
TNF treatment in patients with IBD. Several studies have 
pointed to smoking as a risk factor for such a paradoxical 
reaction. A recent retrospective cohort study of 402 patients 
with IBD who started anti-TNF-α at a single center showed 
that smoking was an independent risk factor for new onset 
psoriasis, with an HR of 2.37 (95% CI: 1.36–4.48); on the 
contrary, concomitant immunosuppressive therapy was a 
protective factor, with an HR of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.12–0.92).52
Reducing the health burden of 
smoking: the role of dermatologists
About one-half of people with a long-term history of smok-
ing, especially those who started smoking in adolescence, will 
ultimately die from the health consequences of tobacco use. 
One-half of these deaths will occur in middle-aged people, 
with a reduction of 20–25 years of normal life expectancy.53 
Nicotine dependence is the main reason why individuals 
persist smoking.
Psoriasis is just one of the many diseases associated 
with smoking. Nonetheless, it is a visible and debilitating 
condition, and patients may be more motivated to consider 
quitting smoking because of it than in consideration of other 
nonvisible health problems. Dermatologists could play a 
major role in inducing their patients to stop smoking. All 
psoriatic patients should be asked if they use tobacco and 
should have their smoking status documented. An initial 
prompt from a health professional is important to stimulate 
awareness of risks.54 Referral to intensive support programs 
should be offered, such as the NHS Stop Smoking Service in 
the United Kingdom.55 Even though most people understand 
the advantages of a healthier behavior, many are unable to 
make a change in their lifestyle. Moving from contempla-
tion to action is influenced by complex personal, cultural, 
and socioeconomic factors. In addition, changes may not be 
stable, and individuals may fall back to smoking.56 Nicotine 
replacement therapy represents the mainstay of strategies 
to quit smoking.57 Intensive individual behavior therapy 
interventions are considered as an alternative when nicotine 
replacement therapy fails or in situations where people are 
reluctant to use it.
As already mentioned, dermatologists could play a major 
role in influencing people to change their behavior. This 
may require training and motivations. A few surveys have 
suggested that dermatologists may lack sufficient knowl-
edge and educational skills or may be reluctant to promote 
lifestyle interventions in their practice.58 In consideration 
of the importance of healthier behaviors for many skin dis-
eases, including psoriasis, a curriculum should be developed 
to teach dermatologists on patient-centered communication 
and on strategies aimed at changing behavior.59
