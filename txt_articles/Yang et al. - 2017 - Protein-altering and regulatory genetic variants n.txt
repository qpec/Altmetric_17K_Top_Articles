Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a heritable congenital heart defect and an important risk factor
for valvulopathy and aortopathy. Here we report a genome-wide association scan of 466 BAV
cases and 4,660 age, sex and ethnicity-matched controls with replication in up to 1,326 cases
and 8,103 controls. We identify association with a noncoding variant 151 kb from the gene
encoding the cardiac-specific transcription factor, GATA4, and near-significance for
p.Ser377Gly in GATA4. GATA4 was interrupted by CRISPR-Cas9 in induced pluripotent stem
cells from healthy donors. The disruption of GATA4 significantly impaired the transition from
endothelial cells into mesenchymal cells, a critical step in heart valve development.

 B
icuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital aortic valve defect
characterized by fusion of two of the normal three leaflets.
With a prevalence of B1% in the population and a feature
of some rare connective-tissue syndromes, BAV is the most
common cardiovascular malformation in humans1,2. BAV is
associated with serious consequences: 30–70% of those with BAV
will develop dilated thoracic aorta3; 15–71% of BAV patients
develop aortic valve stenosis depending on age group and
individuals with BAV have a 50-fold higher risk of severe aortic
valve stenosis4; and up to 47% of BAV patients develop aortic
valve incompetence5. The presence of a BAV confers an eightfold
increased risk of aortic dissection, which carries very high
mortality6. Overall, 27% of BAV patients will require surgical
intervention to either replace their aortic valve or aorta for aortic
aneurysm and dissection7. BAV accounts for B40% of the
450,000 aortic valve replacements performed in the United
States each year8.
BAV is moderately heritable, with estimates ranging from 20 to
89% (refs 9–11). Despite the prevalence, importance and
heritability of BAV, its genetic origins remain elusive. Previous
genetic studies of BAV have focused primarily on linkage analysis
in families9,12 or sequencing candidate genes in cases13 under a
hypothesis of Mendelian inheritance. Only one previous genome-
wide association study (GWAS) for BAV has been published in a
limited number of cases (n ¼ 68; ref. 14), which did not identify
any genome-wide significant results. The only gene in which
variants have been identified to cause BAV in multiple families is
NOTCH1, but o6% of BAV cases are accounted for by NOTCH1
variation13. It is clear that BAV is not a simple Mendelian
trait9,15, but is indeed heritable, and, therefore, we applied genetic
association methods typically used for complex traits.
With a goal of identifying genetic variants associated with BAV,
leading to biological insight of the underlying causes, here we
perform an unbiased genome scan in a large study of BAV
cases (n ¼ 466) and controls (n ¼ 4,660), with replication in
additional samples of up to 1,326 cases and 8,103 controls. We
identify
two
genetic
variants
that
reached
or
were
near
genome-wide significance levels (Po5 � 10� 8). One is a low-
frequency intergenic variant rs6601627 (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 2.38,
Pafter-replication ¼ 3 � 10� 15) with a substantially higher frequency
in BAV cases (8.3%) than in controls (4.2%), and the other one is
an independent association signal at a common protein-altering
variant p.Ser377Gly (rs3729856) in GATA4, which encodes a
cardiac-specific transcription factor that is 151 kilobases(kb) away
from the first variant (Pafter-replication ¼ 8.8 � 10� 8). Induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(iPSCs)
with
GATA4
disrupted
by
CRISPR-Cas9 demonstrate impaired transition of endothelial into
mesenchymal cells (EndoMT), a critical step in valve formation16.
Results
GWAS of BAV. To discover the underlying genetic basis of BAV,
we successfully genotyped 498,075 genetic variants with enrich-
ment of protein-altering variants (43.8% of variants examined)
for 466 BAV cases and 4,660 controls. Imputation from the
Haplotype
Reference
Consortium
(HRC)
panel17
enabled
examination
of
a
total
of
12,320,487
variants.
Clinical
characteristics for BAV cases are summarized in Supplementary
Table
1.
Following
a
genome-wide
association
scan
(Supplementary Figs 1 and 2), we examined three variants in
replication cohorts with a combined total of up to 1,326
additional cases and 8,103 controls.
Variants near GATA4. The strongest result from the genome-
wide discovery for BAV was observed for a genotyped low-fre-
quency
variant,
rs6601627,
in
an
intergenic
region
of
chromosome 8 (rs6601627, minor allele frequency (MAF) ¼ 4.1%,
OR ¼ 1.9,
Pcombined ¼ 3.0 � 10 � 15;
Table
1,
Fig.
1
and
Supplementary Fig. 2). Ninety-seven imputed variants in this
region also reached genome-wide significance (Po5 � 10 � 8).
The two nearest genes are not obvious functional candidates
(CTSB and DEFB135); however, this variant is 151 kb from the 30
end of the GATA4 gene (Fig. 1).
We also observed a common missense variant p.Ser377Gly in
GATA4
(rs3729856)
that
was
also
associated
with
BAV
(Pdiscovery ¼ 3.2 � 10 � 4, MAF ¼ 14.5%; Table 1 and Fig. 1). We
selected GATA4 p.Ser377Gly for in silico replication because it is a
protein-altering variant and because it was located in the local
genomic region of the most significant variant (Supplementary
Fig. 3). The p.Ser377Gly variant reached near genome-wide
significance after including in silico replication data (OR ¼ 1.31,
P ¼ 8.8 � 10 � 8; Supplementary Fig. 4), and exceeded the typical
significance level used for exome-wide studies of coding variation
(typically Po2 � 10 � 7; ref. 18). This suggests that GATA4 may
be the functional gene at this GWAS locus; however, further
experiments will be needed to demonstrate which gene(s) causes
BAV. The two variants at 8p23.1 (rs6601627 and rs3729856)
appear to be independent of each other, since they were not in
linkage disequilibrium (LD r2 ¼ 0.013) and reciprocal conditional
association analysis maintained nominal significance for both
(Pcond rs6601627 ¼ 8.92 � 10 � 9, Pcond rs3729856 ¼ 0.012). After
including in silico replication data, the reciprocal conditional
association analysis still maintained nominal significance (Pmeta
rs6601627 ¼ 1.52 � 10 � 9,
Pmeta
rs3729856 ¼ 8.17 � 10 � 3;
Supplementary Fig. 5). The non-additive association tests showed
that both variants appear to have dominant effects on risk of BAV
(Supplementary Table 2).
The ExAC database characterizes protein-altering variants in
60,706 multiethnic individuals with whole-exome sequences19.
ExAC lists 96 missense variants in GATA4 (95 of them have
MAFo1%), a deficit compared to the 140 variants predicted
based on gene size. In addition, 9.4 loss-of-function (LoF)
variants are predicted and only 1 was observed (p.Lys365Ter) out
of 60,706 individuals with deep exome sequences. The probability
that the gene is intolerant to LoF, a measure of the relative
importance of gene function, is high (loss intolerance probability
(pLI) score ¼ 0.8 where 40.9 is considered extremely intolerant).
Moreover, the missense GATA4 variant rs3729856 is predicted as
benign or tolerated by PolyPhen-2 (ref. 20) and SIFT21, and it has
a combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) score 9.418
(in top 11% of deleterious variants in the human genome)22.
These results suggest the importance of the GATA4 gene’s
function, although the missense variant rs3729856 itself may not
be significantly deleterious.
We hypothesized that the functional BAV gene at this CTSB/
GATA4 locus would demonstrate high expression in heart or
vascular tissue. Using the GTEx portal23, we examined mRNA
expression levels of all genes within the 200 kb surrounding the
noncoding associated variant rs6601627 and found that GATA4
showed strong expression in the heart (atrial appendage and left
ventricle) and coronary artery, and also in the ovary, testis,
pancreas and liver (Supplementary Fig. 6)23. The other genes in
the region (NEIL2, FDFT1 and CTSB) showed ubiquitous
expression levels across all tissues (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Examination of all GTEx association results did not identify
any significant expression quantitative trait locus with the
noncoding rs6,601,627 (Po10 � 5; ref. 23). We propose that this
noncoding variant, or a variant tagged by it, influences GATA4
expression in a manner not detectable by GTE—either exerting
an influence on gene expression levels only in the developing fetal
heart or with a relatively modest effect that was not detectable in
the current GTEx sample size.

 After detecting the association with both coding and noncod-
ing variants at the GATA4 locus, we sought to examine the role of
GATA4 in the development of the aortic valve. In the primitive
heart tube, heart valves develop from endocardial cushions, which
are formed by mesenchymal cells derived from endothelial cells
(ECs) through a process called EndoMT16. Despite the critical
role in heart valve development, the mechanism of EndoMT is
not well understood24–26. GATA4 was previously shown to be
essential for heart formation and for endocardial cushion
development in mice27–29. Here we evaluated the impact of
disruption of GATA4 on human iPSC differentiation into
mesenchymal cells through EndoMT to examine the role of
GATA4 in the development of aortic valves in humans.
The GATA4 knockout mouse is embryonically lethal between
embryonic day (E) 7.0 and E9.5, and lacks a primitive heart
tube28. Deletions of GATA4 in humans have been associated with
congenital heart defects (CHDs)30,31, and a missense variant
p.Gly296Ser was identified in a family with atrial and ventricular
septal defects32. A mouse model of the p.Gly296Ser missense
change is also embryonically lethal by E11.5, but a subset of these
mice demonstrate semilunar valve stenosis and small defects of
the atrial septum, thought to be resultant from defects in
cardiomyocyte proliferation during embryogenesis33. Previous
studies observed missense variants in GATA4 in patients with
septal defects34, CHDs35 and Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)35, but have
not been tested in case–control models. The frequency of GATA4
variants in healthy controls is not clear from these studies and
their pathogenicity is unknown. The co-appearance of congenital
heart disease and testicular anomalies was found in a family with
a GATA4 p.Gly221Arg mutation, thought to disrupt interaction
with FOG2 and/or NR5A1, important factors for gonadal
development36.

Chromatin conformation at the GATA4 locus. We attempted to
evaluate the hypothesis that noncoding variants in LD with
rs6601627 have an impact on expression of GATA4 during a
critical stage of development. This is supported by prior evidence
that GATA4 dosage has an impact on cardiac formation40. We
first identified potentially functional variants using RegulomeDB
and HaploReg in the region near rs6601627 or variants in high
LD
(r240.6;
ranging
from
rs112197605
to
rs117851931;
hg19:chr8:11774952–11838697)41,42.
After
examining
local
chromatin
states,
DNase-hypersensitive
regions
and
transcription factor-binding sites, we identified rs118065347 as
a variant likely to be functional because it co-localizes with
binding regions for multiple transcription factors (including
KAP1, CCNT2, CJUN, C-MYC, GATA2, HDAC2, HMGN3,
JUND, MAX, SP1, TAL1, YY1 and ZBTB7A) and is in a known
enhancer active in fetal heart, left and right ventricle, right atrium,
as well as other tissues42,43. This variant disrupts the binding
motif for a variety of transcription factors including PAX6
(ref. 44). There are other candidate functional variants in high LD
with the index variant, and molecular experiments will be
required to definitively identify the functional variant(s) and the
mechanism of action on aortic valve development.
We next asked which genes in the locus may interact with this
candidate enhancer region. We identified chromatin interaction
loops in K562 and GM12878 cells using chromatin interaction
analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) and high-
throughput sequencing (Hi-C) data (Fig. 2)45,46. rs118065347
falls near the edge of a topologically associated domain spanning
from hg19:chr8:11250000 to 11825000 defined by Hi-C in both
cell lines. The variant falls inside a ChIA-PET loop connecting to
a region also annotated as an enhancer 30 of GATA4 and C8orf49
and 50 of NEIL2. These data indicate that this distal region is
brought in close proximity to GATA4 and disruption of this
region may have direct impact on GATA4 expression. Further
molecular experiments will be needed to clarify the gene(s) that
has an impact on BAV.
Phenotypic characteristics of BAV cases in discovery sample.
Among our 466 non-syndromic BAV cases, 93 (20%) reported
one or more family members also having BAV (Supplementary
Table 1). This suggests a high recurrence risk and supports the
hypothesis of large-effect variants, but not necessarily Mendelian
inheritance47. Majority of BAV cases were recruited from a
cardiac surgery clinic at the University of Michigan Frankel
Cardiovascular Center (FCVC), where patients are referred to
cardiac surgery for aneurysm repair or valve replacement; thus,
we found a high proportion of patients with thoracic aortic
aneurysm (TAA; 83%). However, at these two loci, we saw no
evidence for heterogeneity between BAV cases with or without
TAA (Supplementary Table 3) and between BAV cases with or
without
a
positive
family
history
of
BAV
and/or
TAA
(Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that BAV probably has an
impact on the risk of TAA because of altered haemodynamic
blood flow and aortopathy from different mechanisms instead of
sharing molecular mechanisms with TAA that has an impact on
both aorta and valve tissue47. In addition, we did not find
evidence for heterogeneity in the association results at GATA4
and BAV subtypes (Supplementary Table 5) and among male and
female subjects (Supplementary Table 6).
Implication of rs6601627 and rs3729856 in other CHDs. To
investigate whether the two variants at GATA4 that we report are
involved in development of other and more severe CHDs, we tested
for association with 806 cases of ToF along with 5,029 matched
controls and performed association tests for the two variants as
described previously48. In an additive genetic model, we did not find

 evidence for association between the noncoding rs6601627 and ToF
(MAF¼ 0.03, OR¼ 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67–1.20,
P¼ 0.46); however, for GATA4 p.Ser377Gly, the association was
nominally significant (MAF¼ 0.11, OR¼ 1.24, 95% CI 1.06–1.45.
P¼ 0.007). This suggests that the regulatory variant associated
with BAV may act in a highly tissue or developmentally controlled
manner to cause only BAV and not other CHDs, whereas
GATA4 missense changes may have a more broad impact on
other CHDs.
Missense variant in DHX38. The GWAS highlighted a rare
missense variant (0.14% frequency in controls) in DHX38
(p.Thr1221Met) with a strong association with BAV (OR ¼ 13.14,
95% CI 5.39–32.04, P ¼ 1.5 � 10 � 8) in the discovery sample
(Supplementary Fig. 2). After genotyping of this variant in 720
cases and 5,831 controls, only 22 copies of the rare allele were
identified (5 in cases and 17 in controls), providing a replication
P value of 0.05. Additional large studies will be needed to confirm
this rare variant association with BAV.
GATA4 deficiency impairs EndoMT in iPSC-derived cells. We
investigated the biological impact of GATA4 in the EndoMT
process required for human valve formation. Human iPSCs were
generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a donor
with normal trileaflet aortic valve, using non-integrated DNA
vectors containing OCT4, SOX2, C-MYC and KLF4 (ref. 49). The
pluripotency of iPSCs was confirmed by expression of OCT4,
SOX2,
NANOG
and
SSEA4,
TRA-1-60
and
TRA-1-81
(Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). In addition, iPSCs generated ter-
atoma-containing tissues from three germ layers, demonstrating
their pluripotency in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 7c). In a previous
study, wild-type GATA4 localized completely in the nucleus,
whereas GATA4 mutant p.Ser377Gly (a C-terminal mutant) was
shown to be partially distributed to the cytoplasm, indicating a
LoF mutation50. To evaluate whether disruption of GATA4 may
result in a LoF phenotype, iPSCs were electrotransfected with
plasmid containing Cas9, GATA4 single guide RNA (sgRNA) and
green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an indicator for transfection51.
As control, iPSCs were transfected with plasmid containing Cas9
and GFP. Transfected cells were enriched by flow cytometry

(Supplementary Fig. 8d).
The GATA4 level was significantly lower in ECs from the
GATA4 sgRNA-transfected group than control (Fig. 3a), indicat-
ing successful targeting to GATA4. When EndoMT was induced
by TGFb2 and BMP2 in ECs, smooth muscle actin (SMA), a
mesenchymal marker gene was upregulated in control cells
(Fig.
3b).
Noticeably,
the
GATA4
sgRNA
group
showed
significantly lower SMA levels (Fig. 3b). ECs were also explanted
to collagen gel to induce EndoMT27. The GATA4 sgRNA group
showed significantly fewer mesenchymal cells migrating out after
3 days than control cells (Fig. 3c). Cells undergoing EndoMT
express SMA and CD31 simultaneously at a certain point27.
Immunofluoresence staining of SMA and CD31, markers of
EndoMT27, also showed significantly less SMA and CD31 double-
positive cells in the GATA4 sgRNA group (Fig. 3d). These results
indicate that EndoMT was impaired by disruption of GATA4
with GATA4 sgRNA.

 frequency noncoding variant 151 kb from GATA4, as well as a
common missense variant in GATA4. Although we cannot yet
confirm the mechanism of action of the noncoding variant(s) on
chromosome 8 on aortic valve development, chromatin conforma-
tion experiments suggest that the region near the associated variants
appears to loop and physically interact with regions intronic to
GATA4. This hypothesis could be tested in future functional
experiments to investigate whether the noncoding BAV-associated
variants identified here affect expression of GATA4 at a critical time
in heart development. This could possibly disrupt EndoMT, a
process important for normal trileaflet aortic valve formation.
GATA4, a zinc-finger transcription factor, is one of three major
transcription factors, together with Nkx2.5 and TBX5, that are
critical
for
heart
differentiation52.
Although
not
previously
associated with BAV, the GATA4 gene is a plausible biological
candidate. The missense GATA4 mutation G296S disrupts the
transcriptional cooperativity between GATA4 and TBX5, resulting
in abnormal cellular functions related to morphogenetic defects53.
Many mutations in GATA4 have been previously reported to be
found in different kinds of CHDs atrial septal defect32–34,54–58,
ventricular septal defect32,34,57,59,60 and ToF34,57,61, although
mostly
tested
in
family
studies.
Furthermore,
the
GATA4
mutations have been identified in CHD patients with various
ancestries: European32–34,58, Asian32,54,55,57,59–61 and Native and
Hispanic American34. In addition, GATA4 knockout mice are
embryonically lethal with heart defects. Mice that are missing
GATA5 also develop BAV39, and rare GATA5 mutations have been
identified in humans with BAV37.
We have provided evidence for the complexity of the BAV
phenotype, with multiple genetic variants of incomplete pene-
trance contributing to susceptibility. To assess whether the two
variants that we report are specific for BAV or whether they are
also implicated in other CHDs, we studied cases of ToF,
characterized by several cardiac malformations including an
over-riding aorta, pulmonic stenosis, ventricular septal defect and
right ventricular hypertrophy. We found that the common coding
variant in GATA4 (p.Ser377Gly) was associated with an increased
risk of ToF, whereas the low-frequency noncoding variant
(rs6601627) was not associated. We speculate that the low-
frequency noncoding variant disrupts a regulatory element that
plays a critical role in regulating GATA4 expression in a precise
time of cardiac embryogenesis that may have an impact on the
valve more specifically, whereas the common GATA4 missense
variant might disrupt GATA4 function more generally and
increase the risk of several cardiac malformations, including ToF.
The frequencies of the associated variants at the GATA4 locus
(variants with r240.6 in EUR samples of 1000 G) vary among
different populations62. For example, among the noncoding
variant rs6601627 and its 115 correlated variants, 108 variants
have MAFo0.01 and 73 are monomorphic in East Asians62.

 Association studies in other populations will be critical for
determining whether the association exists in other populations
and may be helpful at narrowing the associated interval.
To investigate the possible role of GATA4 in aortic valve
development, we used sgRNA-guided Cas9 to disrupt GATA4 in
iPSCs from a healthy human donor with normal tricuspid aortic
valves (TAVs). The iPSCs were differentiated into ECs and then
induced to mesenchymal cells through EndoMT. We demon-
strated that deficiency of GATA4 impaired the EndoMTs, a
critical step in valve formation16 (Fig. 3). This indicates that
GATA4 is required for aortic valve formation and that disruption
of the GATA4 gene, either by noncoding or protein-altering
variants, may affect aortic valve formation.
Methods
GWAS genotyping and genotype imputation. We performed genotyping of a
combined set of 498,075 GWAS variants, including 217,957 protein-altering var-
iants, using a GWAS þ exome chip array (Illumina Human CoreExome). To avoid
any potential batch effects, cases and controls were genotyped using the same array
in the same genotyping centre (Sequencing and Genotyping Core at the University
of Michigan). Genotype calling was performed using GenTrain version 2.0 in
GenomeStudio V2011.1 (Illumina) using identical cluster files for cases and con-
trols. Samples with o98% genotype calls, evidence of gender discrepancy, dupli-
cates as well as individuals with non-European ancestry identified by plotting the
first 10 genotype-driven principal components were excluded from further analysis.
We performed variant-level quality control (QC) by excluding 22,983 variants that
met any of the following criteria: variants with a cluster separation scoreo0.3,
o98% genotype call rate or deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium
(Po1 � 10 � 5). We phased the autosomal genotype data using SHAPEIT2 (ref. 63)
and imputed variants from the HRC v1 reference panel17 using minimac3 (ref. 64).
We excluded poorly imputed variants with imputation r2o0.3, and then merged
the genotyped variants and the successfully imputed variants to a combined data
set, which contains 12,320,487 variants in total.
Description of cases in discovery cohort. We collected DNA from consented
individuals with BAV from the FCVC at the University of Michigan as part of the
University of Michigan BAV registry or the Cardiovascular Health Improvement
Project (CHIP). All repository projects utilized for this study are approved by the
University of Michigan, Medical School, Institutional Review Board (IRBMED),
and informed consent was obtained from study participants. Patients were typically
seen in clinic for aortic valve replacement or aortic aneurysm. Diagnoses of BAV
were made by cardiac surgeons upon visual inspection of the aortic valve during
open surgery for aneurysm repair or valve replacement. BAV cases with major
syndromic connective-tissue disorders (for example, Marfan syndrome) were
excluded. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Description and selection of controls in discovery cohort. We identified
potential controls from a surgical-based biobank, the Michigan Genomics Initiative
(MGI), that were genotyped with the same GWAS array (Illumina Human Cor-
eExome). After excluding those with possible aortic disease (n ¼ 1,586,
Supplementary Table 7), we were left with 15,642 potential controls with GWAS data.
We performed age-matching by requiring controls to have a birth year within � 5
and þ 10 years of the case. From the available controls in the appropriate age and sex
category, we selected the best ethnic match for each case and repeated the greedy
algorithm until a control was selected for each case. We repeated the entire process so
that 10 controls were selected for each case. We opted for this approach to provide
the best ancestry-matching between cases and controls, to reduce the potential for
false-positives due to ethnicity mismatch and to also provide the most power for rare
variants that increase the risk of BAV by including the highest number of matching
controls. All MGI research subjects provided informed consent.
Statistical analyses. In the discovery cohort, we performed association testing
for the BAV status using logistic regression with single genetic variants (295,759
with MAF41%), with age, sex and the first four principal components as
covariates using PLINK for hard call genotypes65 and the EPACTS software
(http://csg.sph.umich.edu//kang/epacts/) for imputed dosages. We identified two
genetic variants that were directly genotyped and reached genome-wide
significance levels (Po5 � 10 � 8). We observed no evidence for inflation because
of population stratification (l ¼ 1.033, Supplementary Fig. 1). We observed a
genotyped missense variant within 200 kb (rs3729856) of one of the significant
noncoding variants (rs6601627) and selected this third variant for follow-up in
additional samples.
Association with ToF. A total of 835 unrelated ToF cases and 5,159 controls were
genotyped and imputed from 1,000 Genomes Phase 3 for the region 11–12 MB on
chromosome 8 using IMPUTE2 (refs 48,66). The association tests were performed
using logistic regression of the ‘best-guess’ genotypes for all imputed single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with IMPUTE2 info score Z0.5 and with MAF
Z0.01 in controls using SNPTEST67. This study has been approved by Newcastle
and North Tyneside NHS Research Ethics Committee.
Incorporating gene expression and epigenetics data. We assessed expression
levels of relevant genes using the GTEx server (http://www.gtexportal.org/home/
)23. We obtained the Hi-C interaction calls from Rao et al.45,46 and ChIA-PET
interactions from Phanstiel et al.45,46 available through the ENCODE DCC
accessions ENCSR000FDB and ENCSR752QCX (https://www.encodeproject.org/).
ChromHMM data are displayed from the K562 Genome Segmentation by
ChromHMM from ENCODE/Analysis available at https://genome.ucsc.edu/ and is
created through chromatin segmentation using eight histone modifications, CTCF,
Pol2 and open chromatin annotations68.
IPSC generation and culture. The procedure of iPSC derivation was performed
according to methods we described49: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were separated from human peripheral blood with lymphocyte seperation medium
(LSM) (MP Biomedicals LLC.), cultured in medium containing Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) (Life Technologies Corp.), 10% fetal bovine serum
(Life technologies Corp.), thrombopoietin (TPO), stem-cell factor (SCF) and
FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT-3) at a final concentration of 100 ng ml � 1,
granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 at a final
concentration of 10ng ml � 1 (Peprotech Inc.) and penicillin–streptomycin
(Life Technologies Corp.), and electrotransfected with episomal DNA plasmids
containing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC using Nucleofector 2 Device
(Lonza Corp.). At around day 30 post infection, the colonies became compact. The
colonies were mechanically picked up from the culture dishes and first cultured
with mouse embryonic fibroblasts for three passages69 and transited to TesRE8
medium (Stemcells Inc.) on matrigel-coated (BD Corp.) dishes. iPSCs were
passaged every 4–6 days with Versene (Life Technologies Corp.). In addition, iPSCs
from passages 25–35 were used in experiments.
Teratoma formation in immune-deficient mice. Conduction of Animal experi-
ments was in compliance with the regulations of the Unit for Laboratory Animal
Medicine at the University of Michigan. Two million iPSCs were injected sub-
cutaneously into each flank of the recipient male, 6–8-week-old nonobese diabetic-
severe combined immunodeficient mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine).
Three to five weeks after injection, teratomas were collected from the mouse flanks
and fixed with formalin (Thermo Corp.) for 2 days. The tumours were then
embedded in paraffin, and sections were prepared with a microtome (Leica Corp.)
and stained with haematoxylin and eosin staining solutions from Thermo Corp.
The slides were examined and micrographs were taken under brightfield with
microscope (Nikon Corp.).
GATA4 sgRNA design and electrotransfection of iPSCs. sgRNAs were designed
to target GATA4 exon2 (the first coding exon) with sgRNA design tool (http://
www.genome-engineering.org) developed by Zhang and co-workers51. Sequence of
GATA4 sgRNA was 50-CGCGCCGTGCATGAAGGCGCCGG-30. Target site was
chr8:-11565888. Quality score was 93. Minimal number of mismatch nucleotides in
offsite targets was 3. SgRNAs were cloned into PX458, which contains SpCas9-2A-
EGFP, using AgeI and EcoRI at 50 and 30 cloning sites51. One million iPSCs were
electrotransfected with constructed 5 mg PX458 containing GATA4 sgRNA, using
the Lonza Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 2 with programme U-023 on
Nuclefector 2 device (Lonza Ltd.). Another one million iPSCs were
electrotransfected with the PX458 vector as control under the same conditions.
EC differentiation from iPSCs. To differentiation iPSCs into ECs, iPSCs were
dissociated with Versene (Life Technologies Corp.) into single cells and seeded at
2 � 104 cells per cm2 with the TesRE8 (Stemcell Technology Inc.) medium supple-
mented with Rocki (Y27632, Stemgent Inc.). When the cells reached a confluence of
20–30%, the medium was changed into a differentiation medium, which contained
DMEM-F12 (Life Technologies Corp.), B27 supplement without vitamin A (Life
Technologies Corp.), L-glutamine (Life Technologies Corp.), penicillin–streptomycin
(Life Technologies Corp.), 400mM 1-thioglycerol (Sigma Corp.), 50mgml� 1 ascorbic
acid (Sigma Corp.), 25 ngml� 1 BMP4 (R&D Systems Corp.) and 6 mM GSK3 inhi-
bitor CHIR99021 (Sigma Corp.). Differentiation medium was refreshed daily for 3
days. Then, cells were dissociated with Accutase (Life Technologies Corp.) and seeded
at 1� 104 cells per cm2 on matrigel (BD Corp.)-coated dishes with an EC medium
containing Stempro34(Life Technologies Corp.), Stempro34 supplement (Life Tech-
nologies Corp.), L-glutamine (Life Technologies Corp.), penicillin–streptomycin (Life
Technologies Corp.) and 50 ngml� 1 vascular endothelial growth factor (Peprotech
Inc.). Medium was refreshed every 2 days for 13 days.
Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence stain-
ing and flow cytometry were performed as follows: first, cells were fixed in 4%

Inc.) and anti-SMA (mouse IgG, dilute 1,000 times upon usage, A5228, Sigma
Corp.). Cells were washed three times with DPBS (Thermo Corp.), and then
incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The following
fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488 goat
anti-rabbit IgG (goat, dilute 1,000 times upon usage, A11034, Thermo Corp.),
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (goat, dilute 1,000 times upon usage, A32723,
Thermo Corp.) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (goat, dilute 1,000 times
upon usage, A11032, Thermo Corp.). Slides were mounted with anti-fade
mounting media containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Prolong gold, Life
Technologies Corp.), and were observed on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope
(Nikon Corp.). In a flow cytometry study, electrotransfected iPSCs were dissociated
into single cells with Accutase (Stemcell Technology Inc.), and applied to the
MoFlo Astrios (Beckman Coulter Inc.) flow cytometry machine.
Western blot analysis. Whole-cell extracts were prepared using RIPA buffer (1%
NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phos-
phate, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 0.2 mM Na3VO4.2H2O, 100 U ml � 1
protease inhibitor), resolved on SDS–PAGE gels and transferred to acetate cellulose
membranes. Primary antibodies used were anti-GATA4 (rabbit IgG, diluted
500 times upon usage, 36,968, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-SMA
(mouse IgG, diluted 300 times upon usage, A5228 Sigma) and anti-GAPDH
(rabbit IgG, diluted 2,000 times upon usage, sc25778, Santa Cruz Inc.). Secondary
antibodies used were IRDye800CW Donkey anti-Mouse (92532212), IRDye680LT
Donkey anti-Rabbit (92568023), IRDye800CW Donkey anti-Rabbit (92532213;
all secondary antibodies were diluted 500 times upon usage and purchased from
Licor Inc.). The Licor western blot detection system was used for the dual-colour
imaging. Uncropped versions of western blots are presented in Supplementary
Figs 9 and 10. ImageJ was used for quantification of bands. Each band was
normalized by GAPDH. Experiments were repeated three times. Average value and
s.d. were plotted.
Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and collagen gel assay. EndoMT was
induced by changing medium to an EndoMT-inducing medium that contained
stempro34 medium with stempro34 supplement (Life Science Technology Corp.),
L-glutamine (Life Technologies Corp.), penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies
Corp.), 200 ng ml � 1 BMP2 (Peprotech Inc.) and 50 ng ml � 1 TGFb2 (Peprotech
Inc.). Non-EndoMT control groups were kept in EC medium containing Stem-
pro34 (Life Technologies Corp.), Stempro34 supplement (Life Technologies Corp.),
L-glutamine (Life Technologies Corp.), penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies
Corp.) and 50 ng ml � 1 vascular endothelial growth factor (Peprotech Inc.). Cells
were collected 3 days after induction.
Type I collagen (Sigma Corp.) at 1 mg ml � 1 (final concentration) was mixed
with stempro34 medium, stempro34 supplement (Life Science Technology Corp.)
and 50 mM NaOH (Sigma Corp.). The mixture was poured into 24-well tissue
culture plates (0.5 ml per well) and allowed to gel in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 �C for
30 min. And then 0.5 ml EndoMT-inducing medium was added. After 3 days,
pictures of cells were taken with 100 times magnificance under the Eclipse Ti-U
inverted research microscope (Nikon Corp.). Mesenchymal cells that migrated out
in three pictures from different fields were counted. Experiments were repeated
three times. Average value and standard derivation were plotted.
Genetic association replication cohorts. CHIP. In the CHIP replication cohort,
an additional 140 BAV cases from the University of Michigan FCVC biobank were
collected. These samples were genotyped using the same GWAS array as the dis-
covery cohort, but were only examined for the three variants described here. The
association was tested using PLINK65 with 1,400 age-, sex- and ancestry-matched
controls from the MGI study, which were independent samples from previously
used controls. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and approval
was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan
Medical School.
Montreal Heart Institute. In the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) biobank, 305
BAV cases and 2,746 controls were collected and genotyped on the Illumina Core
Exome array at the MHI Pharmacogenomic Centre. Controls were selected by
excluding those with myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI), Angina, congestive heart failure (CHF), valve defects, heart
surgeries, heart arrest, atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Genotyping was
performed with the Illumina HumanExome array. Association analysis was
performed in PLINK65 using a logistic regression model correcting for sex, age and
principal components of ancestry 1–10. The project has been approved by the
Ethics Committee of the MHI and informed consent was obtained from study
participants.
Partners HealthCare. In the Partners HealthCare cohort, 452 Caucasian BAV
cases were identified from the electronic medical records (EMRs) of Partners
HealthCare (Boston, MA). Individual echocardiographic images were reviewed to
confirm BAV diagnosis. Whole-blood DNA was genotyped using the Illumina
Omni2.5 Beadchip. The Framingham Heart Study dbGaP cohort, genotyped using
the Illumina Omni5.0 Beadchip, was used as controls. QC and population
stratification of the genotype data were performed in PLINK65. SNPs with MAF
less than 1%, without physical map reference, not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium
(Po10 � 4), differential missingness (Po10 � 5), were removed. Related individuals
(PI_HAT40.25) were excluded. Genome-wide IBD and IBS were used to detect
outliers and clusters. After merging case and control genotypes, additional
genotypes have been imputed against the 1,000 Genome reference (phase3) and
HRC (Michigan University) panels using SHAPEIT2 (ref. 63) and IMPUTE2
(ref. 66). After QC, 452 cases and 1,634 controls (1,094 males þ 992 females) with
7.5 million markers were analysed using an additive logistic regression model
accounting for gender, age and principal components. This study has been
approved by Partner’s HealthCare Human Research Committee, and informed
consent was obtained from study participants.
University of Texas Health Science Centre. In the University of Texas Health
Science Centre cohort, 765 patients with sporadic TAAs or aortic dissections were
collected and genotyped. In all, 874 genotypes from dbGAP (NINDS
Neurologically Normal control collection) were used as controls. QC and
population stratification of the genotype data were performed in PLINK65. SNPs
with MAF less than 1% or missing more than 1% of genotypes were excluded.
Multidimensional scaling was used to detect and exclude population outliers.
We imputed additional genotypes against 1,000 Genomes Phase3 using
SHAPEIT2 (ref. 63) and IMPUTE2 (ref. 66). After QC, a total of 152 BAV cases
and 633 TAV cases or 874 controls were analysed using an additive logistic
regression model accounting for gender and principal components. This study has
been approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at
UT Health Science Center at Houston, and informed consent was obtained from
study participants.
ASAP–ARTIST–POLCA–Olivia cohort. Three cohorts ASAP, ARTIST and POLCA
were included in this replication group with a total of 275 BAV cases and 1,686 controls
used for analysis. The POLCA/Olivia cohort is a merged cohort with a total of 1,295
individuals. The ASAP cohort consists of 429 patients genotyped on Illumina
610wQuad beadchips. Approximately 588,400 SNPs were provided after QC. The
Artist cohort consists of 406 samples genotyped with Omni2.5 Quad beadchips on
2,443,180 SNPs. In POLCA, 625 control samples were genotyped on Illumina
610kwQuad, and in Olivia 670 control samples were genotyped on Illumina 1M-
genotyping arrays. The vast majority of included samples are of Scandinavian ancestry.
For the ASAP database, where ancestry is specifically registered, this corresponds to
495% of the individuals, supported by PCA plots of genotype clustering. Imputation
was performed using Impute2 from 1,000G phase1 v3 (ref. 66). Analysis was performed
using SNPTEST67, with age, sex and first 10 principal components as covariates. This
study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee of Stockholm, and informed
consent was obtained from study participants.
BioMe. The Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank (BioMe) is an ongoing, prospective,
hospital- and outpatient-based population research programme operated by The
Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine at Mount Sinai and has
enroled over 33,000 participants since September 2007. BioMe is an EMR-linked
biobank that integrates research data and clinical care information for consented
patients at The Mount Sinai Medical Center, which serves diverse local communities
of upper Manhattan with broad health disparities. BioMe populations include 25% of
African ancestry (AA), 36% of Hispanic Latino ancestry (HL), 30% of white European
ancestry (EA) and 9% of other ancestry. The BioMe disease burden is reflective of
health disparities in the local communities. BioMe operations are fully integrated in
clinical care processes, including direct recruitment from clinical sites waiting areas
and phlebotomy stations by dedicated recruiters independent of clinical care
providers, prior to or following a clinician standard of care visit. Recruitment
currently occurs at a broad spectrum of over 30 clinical care sites. Information on
BAV status, age and sex was derived from participants’ EMRs. BAV cases were
defined as BioMe participants with the ICD-9 code 746.4 (Congenital insufficiency of
aortic valve). In total, there were 41 BAV cases with available genotyping data (8 AA
and 13 HL BAV cases genotyped on the Infinium Multi-Ethnic Global BeadChip
from Illumina as well as 13 additional HL and 7 EA BAV cases genotyped on the
Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 v1.0 BeadChip. For each case, three controls
were selected by genetically matching using the first two genetic principal
components and stratification by age and sex. Logistic regression was performed in
PLINK for the three SNPs in the four groups65. We performed analyses both
including and excluding the BioME non-European samples, and results were highly
similar. We present results in this study excluding the non-European samples since
there were few cases. This study has been approved by Icahn School of Medicine IRB
and informed consent was obtained from study participants.
