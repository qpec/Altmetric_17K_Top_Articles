Background. In-bed, supine cycle ergometry as a part of early rehabilitation in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) appears to be safe, feasible, and beneficial, but no standardized 
protocol exists. A standardized protocol may help guide use of cycle ergometry in the ICU.
Objective. This study investigated whether a standardized protocol for in-bed cycling is 
safe and feasible, results in cycling for a longer duration, and achieves a higher resistance.
Design. A quality improvement (QI) project was conducted.
Methods. A 35-minute in-bed cycling protocol was implemented in a single medical 
intensive care unit (MICU) over a 7-month quality improvement (QI) period compared to 
pre-existing, prospectively collected data from an 18-month pre-QI period.
Results. One hundred and six MICU patients received 260 cycling sessions in the QI 
period vs. 178 MICU patients receiving 498 sessions in the pre-QI period. The protocol 
was used in 249 (96%) of cycling sessions. The QI group cycled for longer median (IQR) 
duration (35 [25–35] vs. 25 [18–30] minutes, P < .001) and more frequently achieved 
a  
resistance level greater than gear 0 (47% vs. 17% of sessions, P < .001). There were 
4 (1.5%) transient physiologic abnormalities during the QI period, and 1 (0.2%) during the 
pre-QI period (P = .031).
Limitations. Patient outcomes were not evaluated to understand if the protocol has 
clinical benefits.
Conclusions. Use of a protocolized approach for in-bed cycling appears safe and feasi-
ble, results in cycling for longer duration, and achieved higher resistance.

 Protocolized In-Bed Cycling in the ICU

ith a growing number of survi-
vors of critical illness,1–3 there 
is a need to address the sub-
stantial physical impairments they com-
monly experience.4–7 Muscle weakness 
resulting from critical illness is associat-
ed with longer durations of mechanical 
ventilation and hospital stay, and worse 
long-term physical function, quality of 
life, health care utilization, and mortal-
ity. 4,5,8–11 Bed rest, which is a common 
practice for sedated and mechanically 
ventilated patients in an intensive care 
unit (ICU),12 is an important risk fac-
tor for developing ICU-acquired muscle 
weakness.8,13 Physical rehabilitation, 
started shortly after ICU admission, may 
help address the impairments associat-
ed with bed rest or critical illness.14–20
One promising intervention for physical 
rehabilitation for critically ill patients is 
the use of in-bed, supine cycle ergom-
etry.21–24 This intervention is of particu-
lar interest in the ICU setting, as it can 
be used in mechanically ventilated pa-
tients, as well as those with a decreased 
level of consciousness.16,22,24–29 In the 
ICU, cycling has been demonstrated 
to be safe and feasible.16,24,25,27,30 One 
ICU-based randomized controlled trial 
of 20 minutes per day, 5 days per week, 
of cycling in patients with prolonged 
critical illness demonstrated improved 
muscle strength, physical functioning, 
and quality of life.16 Another RCT in 
sedated ICU patients demonstrated that 
30 to 60 minutes of passive-cycling re-
sults was associated with decreased 
muscle protein loss25. Furthermore, a 
controlled clinical trial pilot study of 
twice-daily 20-minute cycling sessions 
in hospitalized patients who underwent 
coronary artery bypass grafting resulted 
in non-significantly longer walking dis-
tance at hospital discharge.31 Within the 
existing literature, there is variability in 
the timing of initiation of cycling ther-
apy, cycling duration, and use of resist-
ance.16,23,25,27–29 As more trials utilizing 
supine cycle ergometry emerge, along 
with implementation into clinical prac-
tice, standardization of cycling protocols 
may allow for greater comparability of 
results. Hence, our objective was to un-
dertake a quality improvement (QI) pro-
ject to design a protocolized approach 
to in-bed cycle  
ergometry with specific 
goals of increasing the resistance and 
duration of cycling sessions. Further, 
we aimed to evaluate safety and feasi-
bility of the protocol as a part of routine 
care in an adult medical ICU (MICU). If 
demonstrated as safe and feasible, we 
would plan to conduct future research 
to evaluate clinical benefits of the use 
of a protocolized approach to cycling 
in the ICU.
Methods
This quality improvement project was 
conducted in the Johns Hopkins Hospi-
tal MICU using a pre-post comparative 
design, and is reported according to the 
SQUIRE checklist.32 Our ICU purchased 
a supine cycle ergometer after the prom-
ising results of the randomized trial of 
this intervention in the ICU setting.16 In 
the MICU, cycling is performed as part 
of usual care by physical therapists. Dur-
ing the pre-QI period, the 16-bed MICU 
had an average of 0.16 full-time-equiv-
alent (FTE) physical therapists per bed 
and provided rehabilitation 6 days per 
week. Before the QI period, the MICU 
expanded to 24 beds, and with physical 
therapist staffing remaining similar, with 
an average of 0.15 FTE per bed, but pro-
viding rehabilitation 7 days per week. 
During the pre-QI and QI  
periods, 9 and 
12 different physical therapists provided 
cycling sessions,  
respectively.
Following a MICU physician referral 
for physical therapy, physical therapists 
conducted an evaluation and developed 
a needs- and ability-based plan of care, 
with the decision to  
include cycling 
based on physical therapists’  
clinical 
judgment, 
as 
described 
previous-
ly.14,15,33–35 Cycling was performed using 
an FDA-approved  
device (MOTOmed 
letto 2 [Betzenweiler,  
Germany]). In this 
device, if a patient contributes to the 
pedaling motion, the ergometer is in 
“active” mode and allows for the utiliza-
tion of resistance via escalating “gears” 
that range from 0 to 20. MOTOmed has 
no quantification of resistance in kilo-
grams of force each gear provides. If a 
patient does not contribute to pedaling, 
the motor in the ergometer engages for 
passive cycling without resistance (ie, 
gear 0). Within a cycling session, the 
ergometer senses the patient’s active 
contribution and automatically adjusts

back and forth between active and pas-
sive cycling modes.
Protocol Development and Use
Based on a literature review16,23–25,27,28 
and input from a multidisciplinary team 
(BL, IK, AN, AT, JZ, DMN), a 35-minute 
in-bed cycling protocol was designed 
(Figure 1) with the goal of standardiz-
ing the use of cycle ergometry across 
physical therapists working in the 
MICU. Through the protocol, our objec-
tive was to promote patient cycling for 
longer durations and to achieve high-
er-resistance gears during active cycling. 
The protocol was designed utilizing 
general principles of exercise prescrip-
tion, and featured a stepwise approach 
that included a 5-minute warm-up in-
terval followed by 3 10-minute exer-
cise intervals  
(Figure 1).36  
During each 
 
exercise interval, the therapist provided 
verbal encouragement to the patient to 
actively cycle. The  
therapist  
observed 
the  
patient’s cycling and the device’s 
data output screen to determine the 
duration of  
active cycling within each 
10-minute  
interval. If a patient cycled 
actively for ≥7 minutes (70% of the 
interval duration) in an interval, they 
were transitioned to the next interval 
with an increase in resistance by 1 gear. 
For each subsequent active interval 
(defined as continued active cycling ≥7 
minutes in each 10-minute interval), the 
gear was incrementally increased by 1 
to allow patients to cycle at a higher 
resistance. If patients were unable to 
actively cycle for ≥70% of the interval 
duration, the immediately succeeding 
interval was defined as an “assisted in-
terval” and used a set speed (measured 
in revolutions per minute [RPM]) for 
motor-assisted cycling while the patient 
was unable to actively cycle. Speeds for 
the protocol were set at 10 and 25 RPM, 
based on previous physical therapist 
observations that alert patients could 
cycle at or above these speeds. In con-
secutive assisted intervals, the speed 
alternated between 25 and 10 RPM in 
an effort to promote active cycling, with 
the faster RPM used to stimulate or 
“wake up” patients and the lower RPM 
subsequently used to help detect pa-
tient effort to actively cycle along with 
verbal encouragement by the therapist. 
For cycling sessions occurring on a sub-
sequent day, patients started cycling at 
1 gear below the highest gear achieved 
for 7 or more minutes during the pri-
or cycling session. Protocolized cycling 
sessions were provided as a part of usu-
al care, and could thus be stopped be-
fore completion of the 35-minute pro-
tocol at the discretion of the physical 
therapist for safety or other reasons (as 
described below).
Protocol training was completed for all 
MICU physical therapists who regular-
ly used the cycle ergometer as a part 
of routine care. For the QI project, the 
project leader (BL) provided a 45-min-
ute training session on utilization and 
 
documentation of the protocol to all of 
the MICU therapists. For consistency, 
documentation related to use of the pro-
tocol was built into the electronic medi-
cal record (EMR). The protocol and relat-
ed EMR documentation were piloted for 
2 months (December 2014 and January 
2015), and refinements to improve clar-
ity of progression and feasibility, includ-
ing edits to the flow sheet (Figure 1), 
were made based on feedback from 
the multidisciplinary team and physical 
therapists working in the MICU. There-
after the protocol was  
finalized and used 
as part of routine care for all cycling ses-
sions during the QI period from Febru-
ary to September 2015.
Patient-Related Data Collection
Using data from a prospective clini-
cal database, we identified all patients 
admitted to the MICU who received 
 
cycling from July 2010 to December 
2011 (18-month pre-QI period) for com-
parison to those who received  
cycling 
during the 7-month QI period (February 
to September 2015). The prospective 
data collection for the QI period end-
ed when the project leader (BL) com-
pleted her critical care physical thera-
pist  
fellowship. Cycling  
sessions from 
the pre-QI period were excluded from 
this data set if there was an absence of 
essential data in the physical therapy 
note, such as duration of  
cycling.
Data on patient demographics and 
daily clinical data in both pre-QI and 
QI  
periods were obtained from a pro-
spectively collected clinical database. 
Data included the presence of femoral 
catheters during the cycling session 
and presence of mechanical ventilation, 
continuous renal replacement thera-
py, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and 
propofol infusions on the day of the 
cycling session. Sedation and delirium 
status were documented using the val-
idated Richmond Agitation-Sedation 
Scale (RASS)37 and the validated Con-
fusion Assessment Method for the ICU 
(CAM-ICU),38,39  
respectively. From the 
daily data, MICU and hospital length of 
stay, number of physical therapist treat-
ment and cycling sessions, and time 
from MICU admission to first physical 
therapist treatment session and cycling 
session were calculated. Standardized 
organ failure severity scoring (using the 
Subsequent Organ Failure Assessment 
[SOFA] score)40 was retrospectively col-
lected on the day of ICU admission for 
both the pre-QI and QI periods.
Outcome Variable Data Collection
For all patients receiving a physical 
therapist treatment session in the MICU 
during the QI period that included cy-
cle ergometry, duration of cycling and 
highest gear achieved were collected 
from the EMR. Three categories of var-
iations from the cycling protocol were 
prospectively recorded: (1) stopped cy-
cling before reaching 35 minutes, (2) 
not adjusting the gear or speed/RPM as 
per the protocol, and (3) other variation 
(with description).
We prospectively recorded the follow-
ing 12 physiologic abnormalities or po-
tential safety events occurring during 
cycling sessions during both the pre-QI 
and QI periods: cardiovascular event 
(arrhythmia, hypertension [mean arte-
rial pressure (MAP) >140], hypotension 
[MAP <55], or cardiac arrest), respiratory 
event (oxygen saturation <85%), cathe-
ter (ie, arterial, central venous, or dial-
ysis/pheresis) removal or dislodgment, 
tube (ie, artificial airway [endotrache-
al or tracheostomy], chest, or feeding) 
removal, or patient fall.16 All potential 
safety events were reviewed to deter-
mine any clinical consequences includ-
ing need for therapy, additional cost, or 
length of stay associated with the event.

teristics in the QI vs. pre-QI periods

variables, and chi-squared tests (or Fish-
er’s exact tests, when applicable) for 
categorical variables. We summarized 
outcomes measured repeatedly within 
a patient admission (eg, daily sedation 
status) by calculating the median [inter-
quartile range, IQR] (continuous data) 
and percentage (categorical data) across 
all cycling sessions for each patient ad-
mission. We compared the repeatedly 
measured outcomes across the QI and 
pre-QI periods using linear regression 
for continuous outcomes and multino-
mial logistic model for categorical out-
comes. P values for comparing QI vs. 
pre-QI periods were adjusted for the 
clustering of repeated outcomes with-
in a patient admission using a Huber–
White sandwich estimator. Since poten-
tial safety events did not recur within 
the same patient, they were compared 
during the QI vs. pre-QI periods using 
a 2-sample test of proportions without 
any adjustment for clustering.
Analyses were conducted using the 
available data without imputation. P 
values were 2-sided, with statistical 
 
significance defined as P < .05. Data 
management and statistical analyses 
were performed using Excel (Microsoft, 
Redmond, WA) and Stata 13.1 (Stata Cor-
poration, College Station, TX) software. 
The institutional review board at Johns 
Hopkins University approved this evalu-
ation of the safety and feasibility of this 
cycling protocol that was introduced as 
part of routine clinical  
practice.
Results
During the 7-month QI period, 106 
consecutive MICU admissions received 
at least 1 cycling session for a total of 
260 sessions (mean of 37 sessions per 
month and 2.5 sessions per admission), 
compared to the 18-month pre-QI pe-
riod, in which 178 consecutive MICU 
admissions received ≥1 cycling session 
for a total of 498 sessions (mean of 28 
sessions per month and 2.8 sessions per 
admission).
A comparison of patient admissions 
in the QI and pre-QI groups were 
generally similar (Tab. 1), with the 
QI group receiving their first physical 
therapy session slightly earlier after 
MICU admission (mean 1.8 vs. 3.1 days, 
P < .001), and receiving more physical 
therapy sessions in the MICU (mean 
11.5 vs. 6.9 sessions, P < .001) with a 
similar mean MICU length of stay for 
both groups (15 vs. 13 days, P = .190).
The first cycling session in the QI vs. 
pre-QI groups occurred at a median 
(interquartile range [IQR]) of 3 (1–5) 
vs. 4 (2–7) days (P = .494), after MICU 
admission. Both groups received a me-
dian (IQR) of 2 (1–3) cycling sessions 
per MICU admission (Tab. 2).  
Patients 
were mechanically ventilated for 77% 
and 79% (P = .650) of days with cycling 
sessions in the QI and pre-QI groups, 
respectively (Tab. 3). Of note, despite 
mechanical ventilation, patients in the 
QI and pre-QI groups were generally 
awake (RASS ≥ –1: 60% and 70%, Tab. 3), 
with 59% vs. 53% (P = .073) being de-
lirious (CAM-ICU positive) on cycling 
days. Both groups had a similar num-
ber of cycling days with femoral arterial 
catheters (3% vs. 1%, P = .240), with the 
QI group cycling more  
frequently with 
continuous renal replacement therapy 
(16% vs. 8%, P < .055) (Tab. 3).
Using the protocol, the QI group cycled 
for longer median (IQR) durations (35 
[25–35] vs. 25 [18–30] minutes, P < .001). 
During the pre-QI period, data on the 
highest gear achieved was not available 
for 122 (25%) cycling sessions. Among 
the existing data on  
cycling resistance, 
patients in the QI vs. pre-QI group 
more frequently cycled with a highest 
gear >0 in 47% vs. 17% (P < .001) of 
cycling sessions (Tab. 3).
Of physiological abnormalities and po-
tential safety events, 4 (1.5%) events oc-
curred in the QI period vs. 1 (0.2%) in 
the pre-QI period (P = .031) (Tab. 2). 
The 4 events during the QI period were 
as follows: 1 transient desaturation to 
<85% that resolved with rest, 2 transient 
episodes of hypertension (mean arterial 
pressure>140 mmHg) for which cycling 
was ceased in 1 session with no inter-
vention required for either session, and 
one 10-beat episode of ventricular tach-
ycardia in a patient who was having re-
peated episodes of ventricular tachycar-
dia at rest, for which the cycling ceased 
and no intervention was required. The 
pre-QI event was dislodgment of a 
 
radial arterial line, which was sched-
uled for removal due to malpositioning 
prior to cycling.41 Transient physiolog-
ical abnormalities and potential safety 
events did not lead to any increased 
need for therapy, cost, or length of stay.
Of the 260 cycling sessions in the QI 
period, the protocol was used in 249 
(96%) sessions, and variations from the 
protocol occurred in 118 (48%) cycling 
sessions. Protocol-specified adjustment 
in gears was always implemented. The 
majority (84%) of variations from pro-
tocol consisted of early stopping of cy-
cling before the full 35 minutes due to 
clinically relevant reasons  
(Tab. 4), with 
the median (IQR) duration of these 
abbreviated sessions being 25 (15–30) 
minutes.
Discussion
In this QI project, we created a 35- 
minute 
in-bed cycling ergometry protocol used 
by 12 different physical therapists in 
106 patient admissions in an MICU. We 
evaluated the protocol’s safety and fea-
sibility as part of routine clinical prac-
tice, and its effect on the duration and 
intensity of cycling sessions. The proto-
col was used in 91% of cycling sessions, 
and we did not observe variations from 
the protocol in 52% of cycling sessions. 
With use of the protocol, potential safe-
ty events were rare and involved tran-
sient physiological changes without a 
need for any added therapy, cost, or 
length of stay. With use of this protocol, 
patients achieved higher resistance and 
cycled for longer durations.
The QI group began physical therapist 
sessions slightly earlier in their ICU stay, 
and received more physical  
therapist 
treatment sessions in the ICU. Given 
identical overall staffing levels (ie, num-
ber of FTE physical therapists per MICU 
bed) during the QI and pre-QI periods, 
these findings likely reflect, in part, a 
change in physical therapist coverage 
from 6 to 7 days a week. However, both 
groups received the same number of cy-
cling sessions in the ICU.
While cycle ergometry has previously 
been demonstrated to improve  
muscle 
strength and physical function for ICU 
patients,16 a standard way to implement

its use as part of routine care had not 
been published at the time we devel-
oped this protocol.16,25,27,28 Given the 
increasing use of supine cycle ergome-
ters in the ICU, there may be a benefit to 
standardizing use as a first step toward 
being able to analyze and compare pa-
tient outcomes. Cycling protocols have 
only been prospectively evaluated in 4 
published ICU-based studies (3 adult, 
1 pediatric).16,25,27,28 The largest of 
these is a 90-patient RCT, in a mixed 
adult medical-surgical ICU, that evalu-
ated 20-minute once-daily cycling ses-
sions (delivered 5 days per week) in 45 
 
patients who were randomized at an av-
erage of 14 days after ICU admission.16 
The other RCT evaluated the use of pas-
sive cycling in 27 comatose or sedated 
ICU patients, for either 30 or 60 min-
utes, with patients randomized a me-
dian of 12 days after ICU admission.25 
The last study in adult ICU patients was 
a 19-patient case series, evaluating a 
20-minute passive cycling protocol, in-
itiated within 72 hours of ICU admis-
sion.27 Similar to the latter study, in 
our QI project, cycling sessions were 
initiated soon after ICU admission. In 
contrast to these studies, however, our 
project evaluated the use of the cycling 
protocol and evaluated a larger group 
of patients (N = 106). Furthermore, our

protocol was 35 minutes long and spe-
cifically designed to encourage active 
cycling and progressively increase the 
level of resistance within each cycling 
session and across subsequent cycling 
sessions. The protocol also allowed for 
adjustment between active and assist-
ed cycling intervals every 10 minutes 
based on the patient’s ability to actively 
cycle. Across 12 different therapists, the 
protocol was feasible to conduct and 
document in the EMR as part of routine 
clinical care.
Our project has limitations. First, al-
though patients cycled for longer dura-
tions and achieved higher resistance, we 
did not attempt to evaluate any effect on 
patients’ muscle strength and function-
al outcomes. The available data within 
our QI project demonstrate that length 
of stay and discharge location were not 
significantly different between QI and 
pre-QI groups, but there were no stand-
ardized, consistent, and comparable 
measures of physical function that could 
be compared given the retrospective na-
ture of the control group in this project. 
Notably, a comparison of patient out-
comes was not the objective of this pro-
ject, but rather to first design the proto-
col and assess its safety and feasibility. 
Future studies should evaluate any po-
tential beneficial effects that may arise 
from use of a standardized approach 
to cycling and from different “doses” of 
cycling (ie, number or frequency of cy-
cling sessions, and changes in duration 
and/or resistance of each session), ide-
ally within the context of a randomized 
trial. Second, the approximately 3-year 
time lapse between the pre-QI and QI 
period could be a potential limitation if 
there were temporal changes in practice 
during this time period. However, with-
in our established rehabilitation pro-
gram, the mobility culture and physical 
therapy presence in our ICU during this 
time period did not change, which may 
help minimize this potential limitation. 
Third, this project was implemented in 
a single MICU and its results may not 
be generalizable to other ICU settings. 
However, since the protocol was deliv-
ered as part of routine care by 12 dif-
ferent physical therapists, there is some 
support for its ability to be implement-
ed with front-line therapists.
Fourth, the frequency of variation from 
the cycling protocol may be a potential 
limitation. While 48% of sessions varied 
from the protocol (Tab. 4), this result 
was similar to 1 other study evaluating 
cycling in the ICU, which found a var-
iation rate of 33%.29 Reasons for early 
cessation of cycling or variation from 
the protocol were generally clinical-
ly sensible and patient centered, with 
the most common reason being patient 
request to stop cycling, which may re-
flect the heterogeneity in patient toler-
ance for activity during the course of 
critical illness. Fifth, the highest gear 
achieved during pre-QI sessions was 
not documented in 25% of cycling ses-
sions, as therapists commonly did not 
document during passive cycling, giv-
en that it automatically implied use of 
gear 0 (Tab. 2). Further, durations of 
active vs. passive cycling within each 
session were not available, and hence 
we could not determine whether the 
use of this protocol, which attempted to 
elicit active cycling in patients, resulted 
in greater active cycling. Finally, evalua-
tion of patient and therapist satisfaction 
regarding use of the protocol was not 
performed to further evaluate feasibility 
as part of routine care.
In conclusion, we designed a pro-
tocol for use of in-bed, supine cycle 
 
ergometry in critically ill patients, and 
evaluated its safety and feasibility in a 
medical ICU. The protocol was used 
by 12 front-line physical therapists in 
almost all cycling sessions, with 52% 
of sessions not having any variations 
from the protocol. Moreover, all pro-
spectively recorded safety events were 
transient and required no further in-
tervention. Cycling using the protocol 
resulted in longer durations of cycling, 
and patients achieved higher resistance. 
Hence, this protocolized approach to 
in-bed cycling appears safe and feasible 
as part of usual care. Potential benefits 
of protocolized approaches to cycling 
should be evaluated in future research.
