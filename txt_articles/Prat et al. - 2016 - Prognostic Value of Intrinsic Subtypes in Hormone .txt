IMPORTANCE The value of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B,
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [currently known as ERBB2, but referred to as
HER2 in this study]-enriched, and basal-like) in the metastatic setting is currently unknown.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer with
outcome and/or benefit in hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Unplanned retrospective analysis of 821 tumor samples
(85.7% primary and 14.3% metastatic) from the EGF30008 phase 3 clinical trial (NCT00073528),
in which postmenopausal women with HR-positive invasive breast cancer and no prior
therapy for advanced or metastatic disease were randomized to letrozole with or without
lapatinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tumor
samples were classified into each subtype using the research-based PAM50 classifier. Prior
neoadjuvant/adjuvant antiestrogen therapy was allowed. Patients with extensive
symptomatic visceral disease were excluded. Treatment effects were evaluated using
interaction tests.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary and secondary end points were progression-free
survival and overall survival.
RESULTS The median (range) age was 62 (31-94) years. Intrinsic subtype was the strongest
prognostic factor independently associated with progression-free survival and overall survival
in all patients, and in patients with HER2-negative (n = 644) or HER2-positive (n = 157)
diseases. Median progression-free survival differed across the intrinsic subtypes of clinically
HER2-negative disease: luminal A (16.9 [95% CI, 14.1-19.9] months), luminal B (11.0 [95% CI,
9.6-13.6] months), HER2-enriched (4.7 [95% CI, 2.7-10.8] months), and basal-like (4.1 [95% CI,
2.5-13.8] months). Median OS also differed across the intrinsic subtypes: luminal A (45 [95%
CI, 41-not applicable {NA}] months), luminal B (37 [95% CI, 31-42] months), HER2-enriched
(16 [95% CI, 10-NA] months), and basal-like (23 [95% CI, 12-NA] months). Patients with
HER2-negative/HER2-enriched disease benefited from lapatinib therapy (median PFS, 6.49
vs 2.60 months; progression-free survival hazard ratio, 0.238 [95% CI, 0.066-0.863];
interaction P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This is the first study to reveal an association between
intrinsic subtype and outcome in first-line HR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients with
HR-positive/HER2-negative disease with a HER2-enriched profile may benefit from lapatinib
in combination with endocrine therapy. The clinical value of intrinsic subtyping in hormone
receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer warrants further investigation, but patients with
luminal A/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer might be good candidates for letrozole
monotherapy in the first-line setting regardless of visceral disease and number of metastases.

H
ormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast can-
cer consists of a clinically heterogeneous group of
tumors with different prognoses and responses to en-
docrine and chemotherapy.1,2 Except for human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (currently known as ERBB2, but re-
ferred to as HER2 in this study) status, little is known about
itsbiologicalheterogeneityandeffectonpatientoutcome.This
is important because biomarkers that can guide treatment de-
cisions in this setting are urgently needed.3 The best treat-
ment approach (ie, endocrine therapy vs chemotherapy) in the
first-line setting of HR-positive/HER2-negative disease is un-
known and the decision today is based on patient character-
istics (eg, age), tumor load (eg, number of metastases), type
of metastasis (visceral vs bone only), and prior therapy.3
Incontrasttometastaticdisease,muchefforthasbeenmade
toelucidatethebiologicalheterogeneityofearlybreastcancer.4,5
During the past 15 years, studies evaluating global gene expres-
sion patterns have identified 4 main intrinsic molecular sub-
types of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched
[HER2E], and basal-like).6-8 These entities are associated with
distant recurrence and response to endocrine and chemo-
therapy, even within HR-positive disease.6,7,9 In fact, patients
who have clinically HR-positive/HER2-negative disease with a
HER2E gene expression profile (which represents roughly 5%
of cases) do not seem to respond substantially, as estimated by
Ki67 changes, to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.10,11 Al-
though intrinsic profiles are mostly maintained during meta-
staticprogression,12theirprognosticandpredictivevalueinpa-
tients with newly diagnosed HR-positive metastatic disease
remains largely unknown.
Despite recent advances in the treatment of HR-positive
metastaticbreastcancer,resistancetoendocrinetherapieslim-
its their success.13 Cross-talk between pathways involving the
epidermalgrowthfactorfamilyofreceptors,epidermalgrowth
factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2, and HRs has been impli-
cated in resistance to endocrine therapy.2,14 Lapatinib, a dual
tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2, has improved re-
sponserateandmedianprogression-freesurvival(PFS)infirst-
line HR-positive breast cancer in combination with letrozole
in patients with HER2-positive disease (8.2 vs 3.0 months) but
not in those with HER2-negative disease.15 However, whether
patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative disease but with a
HER2E gene expression profile benefit from adding lapatinib
ditosylate to endocrine therapy is currently unknown.
Here we evaluated, for the first time to our knowledge, the
prognostic and predictive value of intrinsic subtypes in tu-
mor samples from EGF30008, a phase 3 randomized clinical
trial of endocrine therapy with or without lapatinib in the first-
line metastatic setting.15
Methods
Patient Data
The eligibility criteria and study design for EGF30008
(NCT00073528) were reported previously.15,16 Briefly, 1286
patients with advanced postmenopausal HR-positive breast
cancer (stage III or IV) previously untreated in the metastatic
setting were randomized in a blinded fashion to receive
letrozole 2.5 mg daily with either lapatinib ditosylate 1500 mg
daily or placebo. Patients were stratified by sites of disease
(soft tissue/visceral or bone-only disease) and prior adju-
vant antiestrogen therapy (<6 months since discontinua-
tion, ≥6 months since discontinuation, or no prior endo-
crine therapy). Hormone receptor positivity was determined
per the enrolling site, and HER2 status was determined in a
commercial laboratory in primary or metastatic sites
defined as either fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
positive, 3+ staining by immunohistochemical analysis
(IHC), or 2+ by IHC and confirmed HER2 FISH positive.17
Ethical review of the study was performed by the Hospital
Vall d’
Hebron institutional review board. No additional
informed consent was required beyond the original
informed consent of the clinical trial.
Gene Expression Analysis
A section of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
breast tissue was first examined with hematoxylin-eosin stain-
ing to confirm the presence of invasive tumor cells and deter-
mine the tumor area. For RNA purification (Roche High Pure
FFPET RNA isolation kit), at least 1 to 3 10-μm FFPE slides were
used for each tumor specimen, and macrodissection was per-
formed, when needed, to avoid normal breast tissue
contamination.18 A minimum of approximately 150 ng of total
RNA was used to measure the expression of 105 breast cancer–
related genes and 5 housekeeping genes using the nCounter
platform (Nanostring Technologies).19 Data were log base 2
transformed and normalized using 5 housekeeping genes
(ACTB, MRPL19, PSMC4, RPLP0, and SF3A1). Samples with 10
orfewercountsinatleast50%ofthegeneswereremoved.Raw
gene expression data will be deposited in Gene Expression
Omnibus.
Sample Data and PAM50 Intrinsic Subtyping
Of the 1286 tumor samples, 916 were profiled and 821 met
the minimum criteria for further analysis (eFigures 1 and 2 in
the Supplement). Intrinsic subtyping (luminal A, luminal B,
HER2E, basal-like, and normal-like) was performed using the
Key Points
Question Are the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer associated
with prognosis and lapatinib treatment benefit in patients
receiving first-line letrozole for hormone receptor–positive
metastatic breast cancer?
Findings In this analysis of 821 tumor samples from the
EGF30008 clinical trial, intrinsic subtype was the most important
prognostic factor for progression-free survival and overall survival
beyond classical clinical-pathological factors, including human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (currently known as ERBB2,
but referred to as HER2 in this study) status. Patients with
HER2-enriched tumors within HER2-negative disease benefited
from adding lapatinib to letrozole therapy.
Meaning The prognostic information provided by the intrinsic
subtypes that further define tumor characteristics might help
guide treatment decisions in metastatic breast cancer.

Statistical Analysis
Estimates of PFS and overall survival (OS) were from Kaplan-
Meier curves, and tests of differences used the log-rank test.
Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were
used to test the independent prognostic significance of each
variable. To test the prognostic contribution of the PAM50 sub-
types, changes in likelihood ratio (LR) values (χ2) were used
tomeasureandcomparetherelativeamountofadditionalprog-
nostic information of one variable/score compared with an-
other. To test the predictive value of the PAM50 subtypes, in-
teractiontestsbetweenPAM50subtypesandtreatmentforPFS
were evaluated in univariable and multivariable models. The
proportional-hazards assumption was tested on the basis of
Schoenfeld residuals. A 2-sided P < .05 was used as the thresh-
old for statistical significance.
Results
Clinical-Pathological Characteristics
and Subtype Distribution
Theclinical-pathologicalcharacteristicsofthe821patientswith
subtype data were well balanced compared with the patients
includedintheoriginalstudy(eTable1intheSupplement).The
median (range) age was 62 (31-94) years, 700 (86%) of the pa-
tients had visceral disease, 644 (80%) had HER2-negative tu-
mors,157(20%)hadHER2-positivedisease,and602(73%)had
experienced relapse at least 6 months since discontinuation
ofantiestrogentherapyornotreceivedpriorendocrinetherapy.
Similar to the original results, lapatinib therapy showed a sig-
nificant PFS benefit in patients with HER2-positive disease but
not in those with HER2-negative disease (eFigure 4 in the
Supplement).
InbothHER2-negativeandHER2-positivedisease,allbreast
cancer intrinsic subtypes were identified albeit with different
proportions (Table 1). Compared with HER2-negative disease,
HER2-positive disease had a lower proportion of luminal A tu-
mors(42[27%]vs335[52%])andahigherproportionofHER2E
tumors (45 [29%] vs 16 [3%]). The proportion of luminal B and
basal-like tumors remained similar in both HER2 groups (46
[29%] vs 196 [30%] and 6 [4%] vs 21 [3%], respectively). No sig-
nificant differences in the distribution of the intrinsic sub-
types were identified based on number of metastases, type of
metastases, and treatment arm. Interestingly, a significant in-
creaseintheproportionofnonluminalsubtypes(35of219[17%]
vs52of602[9%];P < .001),mostlyHER2E(26of37[70%]),was
observed in patients who experienced relapse during adjuvant
endocrine therapy or within 6 months of discontinuation com-
pared with those who never received or experienced relapse at
least 6 months after completing adjuvant endocrine therapy
(data not shown).
Prognosis Within HER2-Negative Disease
Survival data were available for 644 patients with HER2-
negativedisease(eFigure5intheSupplement).Comparedwith
the luminal A subtype, the other subtypes showed a signifi-
cantly worse PFS (Figure 1A) independently of other clinical-
pathological variables (Table 2). When other clinical-
pathological variables were held constant, patients with
luminal B, HER2E, and basal-like subtypes had a 1.457, 2.873,
and 2.258 times higher risk of tumor progression, respec-
tively. Median PFS differed across the intrinsic subtypes: lu-
minal A (16.9 [95% CI, 14.1-19.9] months), luminal B (11.0 [95%
CI, 9.6-13.6] months), HER2E (4.7 [95% CI, 2.7-10.8] months),
and basal-like (4.1 [95% CI, 2.5-13.8] months). Intrinsic sub-
type added more prognostic information regarding PFS than
any of the other clinical-pathological variables evaluated in
the model (LR χ2 = 31.589; P < .001) (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). The second and third most important prognostic
variables were prior endocrine therapy (LR χ2 = 27.842;
P < .001) and number of metastases (LR χ2 = 15.377; P < .001).
Interestingly, visceral vs nonvisceral disease did not provide
independent prognostic information (LR χ2 = 0.539; P = .46).
Similar results were observed in OS despite only 242 (38%)
patients with an event (Figure 1B and eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). Compared with patients with a luminal A subtype, pa-
tients with luminal B, HER2E, and basal-like subtype had a
1.518, 2.528, and 2.338 times higher risk of death, respec-
tively,whenotherclinical-pathologicalvariableswereheldcon-
stant. Median OS differed across the intrinsic subtypes: lumi-
nal A (45 [95% CI, 41-not applicable {NA}] months), luminal B
(37 [95% CI, 31-42] months), HER2E (16 [95% CI, 10-NA]
months) and basal-like (23 [95% CI, 12-NA] months). Intrinsic

and basal-like (19 [95% CI, 9-NA] months). Intrinsic subtype
added more prognostic information regarding OS when added

HER2/CEP17 ratio of 1.6 or less (eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Among the other 8 HER2E/HER2-negative cases with an IHC
2+ score, 6 were tested for ERBB2 gene amplification; all
showed a HER2/CEP17 ratio of 1.6 or less (eTable 8 in the

show evidence of ERBB2 gene amplification.

nostic and predictive value of breast cancer intrinsic molecu-
lar subtypes in postmenopausal patients with HR-positive
metastaticdiseasetreatedwithendocrinetherapywithorwith-
out lapatinib in the first-line setting. Specifically, our results
reveal that (1) all intrinsic molecular subtypes are identified

The optimal systemic treatment strategy for patients with
newly diagnosed HR-positive advanced/metastatic breast can-
ceriscurrentlyunknown.NationalComprehensiveCancerNet-
work or European School of Oncology–European Society of
Medical Oncology second international consensus guide-
lines for advanced breast cancer20,21 recommend starting with
endocrine therapy but base the decision on clinical para-
meters such as tumor burden, age, ECOG performance sta-
tus, disease-free interval, or previous therapies in the adju-
vant setting. However, HR-positive disease is clinically and
biologically heterogeneous and thus there is an urgent need
to identify robust prognostic and/or predictive tumor-based
biomarkers to be included with other clinical variables con-
sidered in patient management and therapy selection deci-
sions. For example, no predictive biomarker exists to date for
noveldrugssuchasCDK4/6andphosphatidylinositol3-kinase/
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors that are currently
being incorporated earlier in the treatment of HR-positive/
HER2-negative metastatic disease in combination with endo-
crine therapy.
A limited number of studies have evaluated the prognos-
tic value of single pathology-based biomarkers for predicting
outcome in the first-line HR-positive metastatic breast can-
cer setting following endocrine therapy.22-25 For example,
Delpech and colleagues22 showed that high baseline Ki67 ex-
pression in 241 estrogen receptor (ER) positive primary breast
cancers correlated with lower clinical benefit and time to pro-
gression on first-line endocrine therapy. Similar results with
Ki67 were obtained by Yamashita and colleagues23 in a series
of73cases.Moreover,astudyoftheSouthwestOncologyGroup
evaluated the prognostic value of progesterone receptor ex-
pressionin398patientswithER-positivemetastaticbreastcan-
cer treated with tamoxifen24 and showed that elevated pro-
gesterone receptor levels in the primary tumor significantly
and independently correlated with increased probability of re-
sponse to tamoxifen, longer time to treatment failure, and OS.
Finally, Rocca and colleagues25 showed that high Ki67 or low
progesterone receptor expression measured in metastatic tis-

lower time to tumor progression following first-line endo-
crine therapy. Overall, these data are concordant with our re-
sults because proliferation and estrogen regulation are 2 key
biological features that distinguish luminal A from nonlumi-
nal A molecular subypes.26
Nonluminalintrinsicsubtypes(ie,HER2Eandbasal-like)rep-
resent3%to10%ofallHR-positivebreastcancers.6-8Inpatients
withHR-positivediseasetreatedwith5yearsofadjuvanttamox-
ifen only, those with HER2E and basal-like subtypes had poor
disease-free survival.9 Concordant with this finding, both sub-
typeshadthelowestrelativedecreaseinKi-67eitherat2weeks
orat4to6monthsfollowingneoadjuvantendocrinetherapy.10,11
Intermsofchemosensitivity,Jimenezandcolleagues27recently
evaluatedthepathologicalcompleteresponse(pCR)ratesofthe
intrinsic subtypes within 180 patients with HR-positive/HER2-
negative disease following anthracycline/taxane-based neoad-
juvant chemotherapy. Interestingly, patients with HR-positive/
basal-like disease, which represented 7.7% of the population,
achieved a pCR rate of 50%, followed by patients with luminal
B, HER2E, and luminal A tumors, who achieved a pCR rate of
20%,14%,and9%,respectively.Overall,thesedata,togetherwith
ourresultsshowingamedianPFSof approximately 4.5months
innonluminalsubtypeswithinHR-positive/HER2-negativedis-
ease, suggest that molecular subtype may better represent tu-
morbehaviorinthesettingofcytotoxicorendocrinetherapythan
clinical HR assay results.
The observation that patients with HER2E/HER2-
negative tumors benefit from lapatinib therapy is intriguing.
Our prior work has revealed that HER2E/HER2-negative tu-
mors have genomic and genetic alterations similar to those of
HER2E/HER2-positive tumors except for the HER2 amplicon,
which is only overexpressed/amplified in those HER2E tu-
mors that are HER2 positive.28 Similar results were obtained
in the EGF30008 study when the ERBB2 gene expression was
evaluated across the intrinsic subtypes based on clinical HER2
status(eFigure7intheSupplement).Thus,theefficacyoflapa-
tinib in the group of patients with HER2-negative/HER2E dis-
ease might be due to EGFR inhibition rather than HER2 inhi-
bition, although this will require further investigation.
The present study has several limitations. First, this is an
unplanned retrospective analysis of a prospective clinical trial.
To minimize bias, we were able to profile almost 2 out of 3
tumor samples from the original population, and this subset
had a similar distribution of clinical-pathological variables and
a similar outcome behavior to the original study population.
In addition, the laboratory that performed and reported the
gene expression results for each sample was blinded to clini-
cal data. Second, almost all profiled samples from this data set
come from primary tumors rather than metastatic tumor. Al-
though we cannot predict what the findings would have been
if the analysis had been done on metastatic samples only, the
realityisthatmetastatictissuesarenotalwaysavailableinclini-
cal practice and thus a biomarker derived from primary tu-
mors is of value, especially if this biomarker remains stable
duringtumorprogressionsuchastheintrinsicsubtypes.12How-
ever, further studies are needed to determine the concor-
dance of intrinsic subtyping in primary vs metastatic tissues
and the stability of subtype during or after therapy. Finally, in
the EGF30008 clinical study, HER2 testing was performed by
a high-volume, commercial laboratory to determine HER2 sta-
tus using standardized testing methods in a single laboratory.
Additionally, HER2 status was evaluated by an academic
reference laboratory in a limited number of cases from the
EGF30008 study population, revealing 93% concordance
(eTable 10 in the Supplement).16,17
Conclusions
Hormone receptor–positive disease is biologically heteroge-
neous and intrinsic subtypes are associated with outcome in
a first-line metastatic setting. Patients with HR-positive/HER2-
negative disease with a HER2E profile may benefit from lapa-
tinib therapy. The clinical value of intrinsic subtyping in
HR-positive metastatic breast cancer warrants further inves-
tigation, but patients with luminal A/HER2-negative meta-
static disease might be good candidates for letrozole mono-
therapy in the first-line setting regardless of visceral disease
and number of metastases, whereas patients with HER2E/
HER2-negative or basal-like/HER2-negative subtypes need
other treatment strategies such as chemotherapy or novel
targeted drugs.
