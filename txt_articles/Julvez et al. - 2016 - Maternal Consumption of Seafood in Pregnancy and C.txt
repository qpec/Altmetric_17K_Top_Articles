Seafood consumption during pregnancy is thought to be beneficial for child neuropsychological development, but
to our knowledge no large cohort studies with high fatty fish consumption have analyzed the association by seafood
subtype. We evaluated 1,892 and 1,589 mother-child pairs at the ages of 14 months and 5 years, respectively, in a
population-based Spanish birth cohort established during 2004–2008. Bayley and McCarthy scales and the Child-
hood Asperger Syndrome Test were used to assess neuropsychological development. Results from multivariate
linear regression models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and further adjusted for umbilical
cord blood mercury or long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations. Overall, consumption of seafood
above the recommended limit of 340 g/week was associated with 10-g/week increments in neuropsychological
scores. By subtype, in addition to lean fish, consumption of large fatty fish showed a positive association; offspring
of persons within the highest quantile (>238 g/week) had an adjusted increase of 2.29 points in McCarthy general
cognitive score (95% confidence interval: 0.42, 4.16). Similar findings were observed for the Childhood Asperger
Syndrome Test. Beta coefficients diminished 15%–30% after adjustment for mercury or long-chain polyunsaturated
fatty acid concentrations. Consumption of large fatty fish during pregnancy presents moderate child neuropsycho-
logical benefits, including improvements in cognitive functioning and some protection from autism-spectrum traits.

Maternal consumption of seafood during pregnancy has
been associated with improvements in neuropsychological
development among children in several studies (1, 2). These
beneficial associations are thought to be at least partly attrib-
utable to higher intakes of key nutrients, including long-chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) such as ω-3 docosa-
hexanoic acid (DHA), which is essential for optimal prenatal
neurodevelopment (3), particularly during early stages of
brain formation (3, 4). DHA is not widely distributed in the
Western diet, and seafood, particularly fatty species of fish, is
the major source (1, 3).
Nonetheless, elevated intakes of seafood during pregnancy
are of concern, because seafood is an important source of
neurotoxic contaminants such as methylmercury and organo-
chlorine compounds, which have been associated with dec-
rements in child neuropsychological scores (1, 2). To help
balance these risks and benefits, guidelines issued by the
United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union

 advise pregnant women with regard to their seafood intakes
(1, 5, 6). The US Food and Drug Administration’s 2014 draft
recommendations (6) emphasize selecting subtypes of sea-
food that are lower in these contaminants, with consistent
advice to avoid the consumption of large predatory fish such
as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish and to limit
consumption of albacore tuna, despite the fact that large
fatty fish such as tuna contain some of the highest levels of
DHA (7).
These guidelines have been debated, since some studies
have found no evidence of adverse associations with maternal
seafood consumption exceeding 340 g/week, the current rec-
ommended limit in the United States. However, the recently
issued scientific opinion report of the European Food Safety
Authority containeda lessrestrictive recommendation,in which
beneficial health associations are limited to 1–4 servings of fish
per week (150–600 g), despite the uncertainties regarding
serving sizes in European epidemiologic studies (5, 8, 9).
However, the studies supporting the guideline statements
did not examine associations with different subtypes of sea-
food (2). Thus, at present there is insufficient knowledge on
the association between seafood consumption in pregnancy
and child neuropsychological outcomes.
In the present study, we examined maternal seafood con-
sumption during pregnancy and child neuropsychological
development in a Spanish multicenter birth cohort, where
average consumption exceeds current US recommended levels
and allows the study of numerous seafood subtypes. We aimed
to assess associations of consumption of large and small fatty
fish, lean fish, and shellfish, as well as total seafood, with a

 range of neuropsychological outcomes, including cognitive
and motor functioning and autism-spectrum traits, at 2 ages
(14 months and 5 years). We also investigated the roles of
mercury and LC-PUFAs in umbilical cord blood, maternal
biomarkers of other environmental pollutants and nutrition,
and child seafood consumption in these associations.
METHODS
Subjects
The Spanish Childhood and Environment (Infancia y Medio
Ambiente) Project, a multicenter birth cohort study, was es-
tablished between 2004 and 2008 in 4 regions of Spain: As-
turias, Gipuzkoa (the Basque Country), Sabadell (Catalonia),
and Valencia (10). Participant recruitment and follow-up pro-
cedures have been reported in detail elsewhere (10). A total of
2,644 eligible women were recruited during prenatal visits in
the first trimester of pregnancy. Women agreed to participate
and met the inclusion (≥16 years of age, singleton pregnancy,
intention to deliver at the reference hospital) and exclusion
(communication handicap, fetuses with malformations, assis-
ted conception) criteria. Women were followed up during preg-
nancy, and their children were enrolled at birth and followed
until age 5 years. After exclusion of women who withdrew,
were lost to follow-up, or had an elective or spontaneous abor-
tion, a total of 2,506 pregnant women were monitored through
delivery. Final analyses included 1,892 children at 14 months
of age and 1,589 children at 5 years of age. The analysis ex-
cluded 93 preterm infants (<37 weeks gestation), because pre-
term births are known to differ from term births with respect to
neuropsychological development (11), and 18 children with
pathologies, including plagiocephaly. A total of 522 children
were lost to follow-up at age 14 months, and 341 were lost to
follow-up at age 5 years. The remaining exclusions were attrib-
utable to missing data on some covariates. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent, and the study protocol was
approved by hospital and institutional ethics committees in
each region. Further information is given in the Web Appendix
(available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).
Exposure and covariate information
Questionnaires, completed twice during pregnancy and
at child ages of 14 months and 5 years, were administered
by trained interviewers to obtain extensive information on
maternal and child characteristics (Web Appendix, Web Ta-
bles 1 and 2).

 We used a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) of 101 food items to assess the usual daily intake of
foods and nutrients at 10–13 weeks of pregnancy and again
at 28–32 weeks. The FFQ was a modified version of a previous
FFQ based on the Harvard questionnaire (12), adapted and
validated among the pregnant women of the Valencia cohort
(13). Further information is provided in the Web Appendix.
Women reported their usual intake of foods from the last
menstrual period to the first prenatal visit, using reference por-
tions and 9 frequency categories ranging from never/less than
once a month to more than 6 times per day. The questionnaire
included 10 seafood items. The response to each seafood item
was converted to average weekly intake in grams; then all sea-
food items were summed to compute total consumption and
consumption of seafood subtypes (in g/week). Seafood was
classified a priori as follows: 1) large fatty fish, based on 1
item from the questionnaire (“baked or steamed larger fatty
fish such as tuna, swordfish, albacore”); 2) smaller fatty fish,
based on 2 items from the questionnaire (“baked or steamed
smallerfattyfishsuchasmackerel,sardines,anchovies,salmon”
and “tinned sardines/mackerel”); 3) lean fish, based on 3 items
from the questionnaire (“fried fish”; “baked or steamed lean
fish such as hake, sole, or bream”; and “tinned tuna,” which
has similar levels of DHA and mercury as lean fish); 4) shell-
fish, based on 3 items from the questionnaire (“shrimp, prawns,
lobster, or crab”; “clams, mussels, oysters”; and “squid, octo-
pus, cuttlefish”); 5) smoked/salted fish, based on 1 item from
the questionnaire (“salted or smoked fish: anchovies, cod,
salmon”); and 6) overall seafood intake, calculated as the sum
of consumption of all items. The fifth subtype group (smoked/
salted fish) was excluded from individual analyses because of
its low frequency of intake in this cohort.
Seafood consumption was adjusted for energy intake using
the residual method (14) and analyzed primarily in quantile cat-
egories of weekly grams. The quantile categories were created
prior to analysis. For some of the seafood subtypes, the number
of quantiles created was constrained by low intake frequency.

 educational level, we checked to see whether the sum of mean
intakes by seafood subtype was similar to the mean total intake
in each educational level category; we found no mean differences
(data not shown). Similar methods were applied to estimate
seafood consumption of mothers at 28–32 weeks of pregnancy
and seafood consumption of children at age 5 years.
Dietary intakes of ω-3 fatty acids (DHA and eicosapenta-
enoic acid) were estimated from the FFQ, and use of supple-
ments containing ω-3 fatty acids, iodine, and folic acid was
recorded (13). Cord-blood mercury and concentrations of
total fatty acids (including DHA), serum maternal organochlo-
rine, and plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and urinary iodine
during pregnancy were measured as previously described (ex-
tended information is provided in the Web Appendix and Web

 Development (15) and the McCarthy Scales of Children’s
Abilities (MSCA) (16), respectively. Autism-spectrum traits
were assessed at age 5 years using the Childhood Asperger
Syndrome Test (17), which was administered after the MSCA
test session. Further information is given in the Web Appen-
dix and in Web Table 3.
Statistical analysis
Associations between total seafood consumption and in-
take of different subtypes of seafood and neuropsychological
scores were evaluated using separate multivariate linear regres-
sion analyses. Seafood consumption was evaluated as both
an ordinal (quantiles) and a continuous (10 g/week) variable
(after testing of linearity by means of generalized additive
models). Tests for linear trend were performed by including
the median value of consumption within each quantile cate-
gory in the regression models. Minimally adjusted regression
models included adjustment for the age and sex of the child,
cohort, total energy intake (kcal/day), and quality of the test
(good, regular, or low) as recorded by the psychologist after
examination. Other important variables, evaluated as poten-
tial confounders and mediators, are described in Web Tables 1
and 2. Confounders were retained only if they modified the
coefficient of the seafood consumption parameter in the
basic model by more than 5% (18). The final models further
adjusted for child’s gestational age and weight at birth, dura-
tion of breastfeeding, maternal age, educational level, social
class, parity, prepregnancy body mass index (weight (kg)/
height (m)2), and country of origin/birth.
Sensitivity analyses adjusted for concentrations of cord-
blood mercury and LC-PUFAs and other biomarkers and
food supplements(listedinWeb Tables1and2),throughinclu-
sion in regression models as continuous variables. Generalized
additive models were used to assess the linearity assumption.
As a result, the mercury variable was log10-transformed to
achieve linearity. In secondary analyses, final-model calcula-
tions were repeated with maternal seafood consumption dur-
ing the third trimester of pregnancy (Spearman’s r = 0.50,
first-trimester consumption) and child seafood consumption

 (r = 0.22, first-trimester-consumption) included as indepen-
dent variables; exclusion of tinned tuna from the lean fish
subtype group; the reference group for total seafood con-
sumption changed to ≤340 g/week; and stratification of the
analyses by geographical location (Cantabric Sea (Asturias +
Gipuzkoa) vs. Mediterranean Sea (Sabadell + Valencia)). All
analyses were conducted with the STATA 12 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, Texas) statistical software package.
RESULTS
Average reported total seafood consumption was 498 g/week
(median, 454 g/week), which is considered by the European
Food Safety Authority to be about 3 servings per week. Very
few participants (n = 15; 0.8%) were nonconsumers. As shown
in Table 1, overall seafood consumption during early pregnancy
was generally related to maternal and child characteristics.
Intakes were higher among mothers who were older, had
been born in Spain, had higher socioeconomic and educa-
tional status, did not smoke during pregnancy, consumed
alcohol during pregnancy, breastfed for longer periods, and
had higher cord-blood mercury and LC-PUFA levels. For
specific subtypes of seafood, consumers showed similar
characteristics. The Spearman coefficients for correlations
between intakes of different seafood subtypes were positive,
albeit weak to moderate. Among them, the strongest correla-
tion was between large fatty fish and lean fish (r = 0.29). Con-
sumption of large fatty fish showed the strongest Spearman
coefficients for correlation with cord-blood mercury levels
(r = 0.34) and DHA levels (r = 0.20).
Associations of total seafood consumption with the main
neuropsychological outcomes are shown in Figure 1. The
strongest associations were observed in the outcome scores
(MSCA and Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test) measured

 at age 5 years. In Figure 2, McCarthy subarea scales are pre-
sented; positive associations were observed among all scales,
with the largest coefficients generally being found in seafood
quantile 4 (median, 600 g/week or about 4 servings/week).
Minimally and fully adjusted associations between mater-
nal seafood subtype consumption and Bayley mental scale at
14 months of age are shown in Table 2. Positive associations
were observed for lean fish and small fatty fish, the latter with
a trend (P for trend = 0.03). Associations with the Bayley
psychomotor scale were somewhat weaker (Web Table 4).
A positive trend in MSCA general cognitive score was found
with large fatty fish intake (P for trend = 0.020), and a weak
trend was found with lean fish (P for trend = 0.110) (Table 3).
Generally, when using categorical variables for seafood con-
sumption in the regression models, quantiles 3 and 4 tended
to have the largest coefficients and to show a slight decrease
in the last quantile (Tables 2 and 3).
As shown in Table 4, maternal seafood consumption, in
total and by subtype, was generally associated with a reduction
in the number of traits on the Childhood Asperger Syndrome
Test. Lean fish intake showed an association with the outcome
from quantile 2. A trend was observed for large fatty fish intake
(P for trend = 0.013). In all models presented in Tables 2–4,
shellfish intake had the weakest associations.
Similar results were observed after excluding tinned tuna
from the lean fish subtype and when treating tinned tuna
as an independent variable (data not shown) and when the
reference group for total seafood consumption included all
mothers with intakes less than or equal to 340 g/week (Web
Table 5). The association of large fatty fish consumption with
MSCA general score was similar after adjustment for lean
fish intake (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: β = 2.00, 95% confidence
interval: 0.07, 5.60; P for trend = 0.047). Associations were
somewhat weaker when seafood consumption was assessed in
the third trimester of pregnancy (Web Table 6). Association pat-
terns were similar when the data were stratified by geograph-
ical location (Cantabric Sea vs. Mediterranean Sea) (Web
Table 7). Inclusion of the 93 preterm children or exclusion

 of consumers of large fatty fish (n = 886) did not change the
results (data not shown).
The associations with the MSCA scales (Table 3) were atten-
uated by 15%–30% after further adjustment for cord-blood
mercuryandLC-PUFA levelsinseparate models(WebTable 8).
Separate models adjusting for organochlorines (polychlorinated
biphenyls and 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene
(DDE)), iodine, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels, estimated
LC-PUFA intakes, and use of supplements containing LC-
PUFAs, folic acid, or iodine during pregnancy did not affect
the results (data not shown).
CurrentchildseafoodconsumptionandMSCAgeneralcogni-
tive score showed similar but weaker patterns of association with
maternal seafood consumption than those shown in Table 3.
After adjustment for maternal seafood consumption, the coeffi-
cients from the models were reduced by 21% (Web Table 9).
The associations with maternal seafood consumption were
similar to those from previous models (Table 3) after adjust-
ment for the child’s seafood consumption (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This study, conducted in a population characterized by
high seafood consumption, found moderate positive associa-
tions between seafood consumption during pregnancy and
child neuropsychological development, particularly at 5 years
of age. Intake of small fatty fish explained part of the positive
associations at 14 months of age, and lean and large fatty fish
appeared to be predictors of child neuropsychological func-
tion at age 5 years. As a new finding, a consistent reduction in
autism-spectrum traits was also observed with total, lean, and
large fatty fish consumption. These associations generally re-
mained positive above the level recommended by the current
US guidelines (total fish consumption of 340 g/week during
pregnancy) (5). Only part of these associations was reduced
by adjustments for cord-blood mercury and LC-PUFA levels.
Child seafood consumption showed similar results, with
somewhat reduced associations after controlling for maternal
consumption.

 Average seafood consumption in this population (498 g/week;
about 3 servings per week or 71 g/day) was similar to levels
reported in other Spanish studies (e.g., 72 g/day in the Basque
Country) (19). These high consumption levels facilitated the
analyses of associations for intakes substantially exceeding
US recommended levels, as well as analyses of specific seafood
subtypes, with the outcomes of interest. Thus, unlike previous
studies, we were able to examine how maternal consumption of
seafood subtypes specified in the US recommendations—
most notably larger fatty fish species versus smaller fatty
fish species—related to child neuropsychological develop-
ment. The positive association observed for MSCA cognitive
scores among women consuming moderate amounts of large
fatty fish would suggest that some of the current guidelines
may be slightly stringent (6). In fact, the present findings
tend to support recent recommendations issued by the Euro-
pean Food Safety Authority, which are less restrictive in lim-
iting seafood consumption and which conclude that there are
no adverse health associations apparent when exceeding the
amount recommended, which is 1–4 servings of fish per week
(150–600 g) (9). Furthermore, given that the associations
observed using seafood consumption in pregnancy were
stronger than those using seafood intake in childhood as
the exposure, uterine life seems to be an important window
for neurodevelopment—particularly during the early preg-
nancy period, when there is intense activity in neuron for-
mation, differentiation, and migration (4).
We identified some studies evaluating the association be-
tween prenatal seafood intake and neuropsychological devel-
opment (2). Most studies found positive associations with a
wide range of outcomes, such as neurological development,
motor development, verbal intelligence quotient, perception,
social behavior, and (less) inattention and hyperactivity (2, 8,
20, 21). In just a few of them, there was attenuation of a pos-
itive association in the highest seafood intake category (2, 21).
Our findings support the idea of a generally beneficial associ-
ation with brain development and potentially a light attenua-
tion at the highest levels of consumption. The surprisingly
protective association with autism-spectrum traits has not
been previously reported, although prosocial behavioral

 improvements were observed in a previous study (8) and chil-
dren with autistic spectrum traits tend to show lower prosocial
behaviors (22). One potential pathway could be through
LC-PUFAs, particularly DHA intake from seafood (23). Sev-
eral controlled trials and observational studies of LC-PUFAs
have reported improvements in cognition, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, and antisocial symptoms (24). Our
findings showing moderate attenuation after adjustment for
LC-PUFA (including DHA) levels in umbilical cord blood
are supportive of that hypothesis, given that other potential
intermediate factors, such as vitamin D and iodine levels in
pregnancy, did not explain any of the observed associations.
While a few previous studies on seafood consumption dur-
ing pregnancy and child neuropsychological development
have examined seafood subtypes (2, 5), none (to our knowl-
edge) have separately examined associations with large versus
small species of fatty fish. Somewhat inconsistently with our
findings, Gale et al. (21) reported that while consumption of
fatty fish of any kind less than once per week was associated
with small increases in intelligence quotient at age 9 years, no
associations were observed at higher levels of intake.
Current guidelines for seafood consumption during preg-
nancy have been developed largely on the basis of evidence
linking mercury and other contaminants frequently found in
marine foods with poorer neuropsychological development
(1). Large fatty fish are of particular concern, as these long-
lived, predatory species may accumulate high levels of both
mercury and lipophilic contaminants such as organochlorines
(25, 26). In the few previous studies where such measurements
were available, positive associations between seafood con-
sumption and child neuropsychological development were
strengthened or not influenced by adjustments for cord-blood
mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, and/or DDE (2, 25). In
this study, there was attenuation of the association estimate
after adjustment for cord-blood mercury levels. In this regard,
the precision of measurement of the independent variables
(both the toxicant exposure and the beneficial dietary factors
and other confounders) in our study was important. If a toxicant

 is measured with greater precision than the dietary factor
through an FFQ, the association for the latter will generally
be biased toward the null (27). In the present study, cord-blood
mercury was probably an indicator of seafood consumption.
The complexity of separating the positive and adverse as-
sociations of seafood consumption and methylmercury (or
mercury), respectively, with child neuropsychological devel-
opment has been discussed elsewhere (28). Several factors
may be masking any adverse association with methylmercury
intake. For example, pregnant women with higher socioeco-
nomic status tend to consume more seafood and be exposed
to higher levels of methylmercury, but their children tend to
perform better on cognitive tests (27). Additionally, variabil-
ity in levels of both methylmercury and DHA are dependent
on seafood subtype, with larger predators containing higher
levels of methylmercury, but some, such as tuna, also con-
taining higher concentrations of DHA (7). These factors
and potential genetic vulnerabilities to methylmercury toxic-
ity (27) make objective evaluation of the toxic risk of this ex-
posure difficult, particularly since such exposure is closely
linked to total seafood intake, which confers benefits for neu-
ropsychological development.
A 2-point increase in a child’s cognitive score is not re-
markable for an individual but is important for the popula-
tion. If a specific population, particularly a community with
poor seafood consumption, benefited from greater consump-
tion of seafood, the Gaussian distribution of scores would
likely shift to the right. As an end result, the chance of finding
“borderline” children would be diminished. If these benefi-
cial associations are permanent, they could be related to pos-
itive social and economic changes (18, 29). Although we
experienced a moderate loss to follow-up of 40%, this allows
some generalizability of our findings.
Although this study contained more information on sea-
food subtypes than earlier studies, we observed moderate cor-
relations between them, limiting the interpretation of fully
independent associations by subtype. Moreover, while FFQs
are valid tools for assessing dietary intakes, the use of self-
reported data is a major limitation in this field of research,
due to an increased level of statistical “noise” related to the
subjectivity in recall of food habits and the potential influ-
ence of sociocultural background. Additionally, healthy nu-
tritional habits that include more seafood consumption are
also related to higher maternal intelligence quotient and edu-
cational level and to less smoking during pregnancy (2);
hence, we cannot rule out the possibility of some residual
confounding. However, we carefully considered a wide range
of potential confounders, including the ones mentioned above
(Web Tables 1 and 2), and conducted sensitivity analyses to
address this potential limitation. Negative confounding by
mercury exposure was not found here, probably due to the
lack of an observed negative association for mercury, as
reported previously in this cohort (30). The difficulty of dis-
entangling both associations demonstrates the statistical lim-
itations of epidemiologic studies. Finally, we found moderate
association trends in some of the seafood subtypes, but there
was also a weak tendency toward saturation in the highest
quantiles of exposure. Probably the pattern of association is
not completely linear, with stronger positive associations in
the moderately high seafood consumption categories.
Overall, the present results suggest no adverse associations
of high seafood consumption in pregnancy with offspring neu-
rodevelopment. Moderate consumption of small and large
fatty fish and lean fish during pregnancy is associated with
moderate improvements in child neuropsychological develop-
ment,includingcognitivefunctionsandautism-spectrumtraits.
A slight dilution of the association at the highest intake levels
may be indicative of a weak counterbalancing association due
to the potential harm of related contaminants. The moderate
mediation role of LC-PUFAs observed here suggests that
they may have a mechanistic function. The role of mercury
was difficult to discern, since it appeared to be a stronger bio-
marker of seafood consumption rather than having any ex-
pected neurotoxic association. Finally, the present findings
should be taken with caution, and future research should
focus on older children in order to further explore whether
the association patterns observed here continue into later life,
with particular attention being given to large fatty fish species.
