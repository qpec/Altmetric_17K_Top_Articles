ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To investigate to what extent alcohol consumption 
affects female fecundability.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
setting
Denmark, 1 June 2007 to 5 January 2016.
PartiCiPants
6120 female Danish residents, aged 21-45 years, in a 
stable relationship with a male partner, who were 
trying to conceive and not receiving fertility treatment.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Alcohol consumption was self reported as beer (330 
mL bottles), red or white wine (120 mL glasses), 
dessert wine (50 mL glasses), and spirits (20 mL) and 
categorized in standard servings per week (none, 1-3, 
4-7, 8-13, and ≥14). Participants contributed menstrual 
cycles at risk until the report of pregnancy, start of 
fertility treatment, loss to follow-up, or end of 
observation (maximum 12 menstrual cycles). A 
proportional probability regression model was used to 
estimate fecundability ratios (cycle specific probability 
of conception among exposed women divided by that 
among unexposed women).
results
4210 (69%) participants achieved a pregnancy during 
follow-up. Median alcohol intake was 2.0 (interquartile 
range 0-3.5) servings per week. Compared with no 
alcohol consumption, the adjusted fecundability ratios 
for alcohol consumption of 1-3, 4-7, 8-13, and 14 or 
more servings per week were 0.97 (95% confidence 
interval 0.91 to 1.03), 1.01 (0.93 to 1.10), 1.01 (0.87 to 
1.16) and 0.82 (0.60 to 1.12), respectively. Compared 
with no alcohol intake, the adjusted fecundability 
ratios for women who consumed only wine (≥3 servings), 
beer (≥3 servings), or spirits (≥2 servings) were 1.05 
(0.91 to1.21), 0.92 (0.65 to 1.29), and 0.85 (0.61 to 
1.17), respectively. The data did not distinguish 
between regular and binge drinking, which may be 
important if large amounts of alcohol are consumed 
during the fertile window.
COnClusiOn
Consumption of less than 14 servings of alcohol per 
week seemed to have no discernible effect on fertility. 
No appreciable difference in fecundability was 
observed by level of consumption of beer and wine.
Introduction
For many women of reproductive age, alcohol con-
sumption is an integral part of their lifestyle. In Den-
mark, more than 30% of women aged 16-34 years have a 
weekly intake of seven drinks or more, and 18.2% of 
American women aged 18-44 years engage in binge 
drinking (at least four drinks per episode) on average 
3.2 times within 30 days.1-3  Alcohol consumption of 
more than one drink a day during pregnancy has been 
associated with low birth weight, preterm birth, and 
fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.4 5  Official guidelines 
in several countries recommend maximum alcohol 
intake of seven drinks a week for non-pregnant women 
in general and no alcohol intake for pregnant women 
and women trying to conceive.6-8  Nonetheless, the 
extent to which alcohol consumption affects female fer-
tility is unclear. Some studies have reported that low to 
moderate levels of alcohol consumption are associated 
with decreased fertility.9-11  Others found either no asso-
ciation12-18  or a positive association between moderate 
alcohol intake and fertility for men and women.19 20 
 
Wine may contain some healthful compounds, possibly 
accounting for the association between moderate con-
sumption and beneficial effects on cardiovascular dis-
ease, diabetes, and osteoporosis.21  Few studies have 
evaluated the relation between specific types of alcohol 
and fertility. One study of 29 844 pregnant women iden-
tified from the Danish National Birth Cohort found that 
wine drinkers had a shorter time to pregnancy than 
women who did not drink wine.16  Most studies have 
examined pregnant women or women seeking fertility 
treatment and have collected retrospective data on 
alcohol consumption during the preconception 
period.9 
13-20  These studies are susceptible to a variety of 
biases, including differential exposure misclassifica-
tion (recall bias), left truncation bias, and selection 
bias.22  
23
In developed countries, up to 24% of couples experi-
ence infertility defined as time to pregnancy of 12 
months or more,24-26  and alcohol consumption is con-
siderable.3 Thus, the effect of alcohol consumption,

especially at moderate levels (from one to seven serv-
ings a week), on fecundability is an important public 
health concern. Accordingly, in a prospective cohort of 
Danish women trying to conceive, we examined the 
association between preconception alcohol consump-
tion and time to pregnancy, examining overall alcohol 
consumption as well as consumption of specific types 
of alcoholic beverage (beer, wine, and spirits).
Methods
Data used in this study were collected as part of the 
 
prospective cohort study “SnartGravid” (Soon Preg-
nant) and its successor study “SnartForaeldre” (Soon 
 
Parents).27 
28  Enrollment and data collection procedures 
have been described in detail elsewhere.28 The study 
was publicized by online and offline media. Briefly, 
enrollment and data collection were managed via email 
and the study websites (www.Snart-gravid.dk (closed) 
and www.SnartForaeldre.dk). Potential participants 
volunteered for the study by accessing the study web-
site, where they were required to read a consent form 
and complete a screener questionnaire to confirm eligi-
bility. Eligible women were invited to complete a base-
line questionnaire and bimonthly questionnaires for 12 
months or until conception occurred, whichever 
occurred earlier. Baseline questions recorded data on 
sociodemographic background, medical and reproduc-
tive history, and behavioral and lifestyle factors. Fol-
low-up questionnaires ascertained information on 
pregnancy status, date of last menstrual period, and 
lifestyle exposures likely to change over time such as 
alcohol use, frequency of intercourse, and smoking.
study population
We enrolled women who met the following criteria: aged 
18-40 years, Danish resident, in a stable relationship with 
a male partner, attempting to conceive, and not receiving 
fertility treatment. In total, 9497 eligible women enrolled 
in the study from 1 June 2007 to 5 January 2016. This anal-
ysis excluded 1495 women who had tried to conceive for 
more than six months at study entry, 1139 women who 
did not complete at least one follow-up questionnaire, 
426 women who reported incomplete or implausible 
information about their last menstrual period or date of 
first pregnancy attempt, 311 women who enrolled more 
than once, and six women who withdrew their consent. 
Thus, the final study population comprised 6120 
women with at least eight weeks of follow-up.
assessment of alcohol exposure
We assessed alcohol consumption at baseline and at 
the time of each follow-up questionnaire by asking 
respondents to consider their alcohol intake during the 
previous month and to report their average weekly con-
sumption of bottles of beer (330 mL) and glasses of red 
wine (120 mL), white wine (120 mL), dessert wine 
(50 mL), and spirits (20 mL). Help buttons in the web 
based questionnaire provided information on serving 
sizes in milliliters and instructed respondents who typ-
ically drank less than one serving a week to report “no 
intake.” We calculated total alcohol intake by summing 
the number of standard servings consumed across bev-
erage types. We also categorized weekly alcohol intake 
in servings as none, one to three, four to seven, eight to 
13, and 14 or more. For analyses based on type of alco-
holic beverage, we classified weekly consumption as 
none, one, two, and three or more for wine and beer and 
as none, one, and two or more for spirits. We updated 
alcohol consumption for each menstrual cycle by using 
data from the most recent follow-up questionnaire 
before a study event was reported.
assessment of pregnancy and cycles at risk
The study endpoint was the occurrence of a pregnancy, 
regardless of its outcome. Pregnancy was confirmed 
with a home pregnancy test by 92% (3878/4210) of the 
participants who became pregnant. We measured time 
to pregnancy in cycles and estimated it as the number 
of days a woman had tried to conceive divided by the 
estimated cycle length. This interval includes both time 
before study entry, limited to a maximum of six months, 
and the time that each participant was followed during 
the study. Total cycles at risk were calculated as: (days 
of trying to achieve pregnancy at study entry/cycle 
length)+(((last menstrual period date from most recent 
follow-up questionnaire−date of baseline questionnaire 
completion)/cycle length)+1).29
assessment of covariates
The questionnaires provided data on age, partner’s age, 
parity, gravidity, vocational training, cycle regularity, 
height, weight, physical activity, last method of contra-
ception, frequency of intercourse, timing of intercourse, 
sexually transmitted infections, smoking, and caffeine 
consumption. We used baseline data on weight, height, 
physical activity, and smoking history to calculate body 
mass index, total metabolic equivalents, and pack years 
of smoking. We calculated body mass index as weight 
(kg)/height (m) squared. In a validation study compar-
ing self reported height and weight with birth registry 
based data on height and weight, the correlation coeffi-
cients for both variables were 0.96.30  We estimated total 
metabolic equivalents by summing the metabolic 
equivalents reported for moderate and vigorous physi-
cal activity—that is, hours per week multiplied by 3.5 
and hours per week multiplied by 7
.0, respectively.31
Data analysis
At baseline, the proportion of missing data ranged from 
0.2% (9/6120) for weight to 6.8% (414/6120) for dessert 
wine. We used multiple imputation to impute missing 
values for all baseline covariates. To impute missing 
values for the time dependent variables (intercourse 
frequency, alcohol and caffeine consumption), we used 
multiple imputation and last observation carried for-
ward; the two methods yielded similar results. Multiple 
imputation involved using covariate and outcome 
 
variables combined with random error to generate five 
imputed datasets and then combining the results across 
the imputed datasets.32 In a sensitivity analysis, we gen-
erated 100 imputed datasets and included imputation 
of missing follow-up data.

We used proportional probabilities regression mod-
els to compute fecundability ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals.33  The fecundability ratio represents the cycle 
specific probability of conception among exposed 
women divided by that among unexposed women. A 
fecundability ratio below one indicates reduced fertility 
for exposed women compared with unexposed 
women.33  At enrollment, participants had been trying 
to conceive for a varying number of cycles, ranging from 
zero to six. We took into account left truncation of the 
data, basing compared risk sets on observed menstrual 
cycles at risk and preserving their ordinality relative to 
the start of pregnancy attempt time.30 Right censoring 
began when a participant started fertility treatment, 
stopped trying to conceive, stopped responding to the 
questionnaires, or reached the end of the observation 
period (12 cycles of pregnancy attempt).
In the multivariate regression analysis, we assessed 
the association between time to pregnancy and total 
alcohol consumption (standard servings) and for type 
of alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, and spirits). In the 
primary analyses, we modeled time varying alcohol as 
the main exposure; in secondary analyses, we modeled 
baseline exposure only. We used two regression models 
to control for possible confounding. In model 1, we 
adjusted for a large number of potential risk factors for 
subfertility (age, partner’s age, parity, vocational train-
ing, cycle regularity, body mass index, physical activity, 
last method of contraception, smoking, intercourse fre-
quency, timing of intercourse, sexually transmitted 
infections, and caffeine intake). We chose these vari-
ables on the basis of the literature, clinical relevance, 
and their association with the exposure at baseline. 
Model 2 included woman’s age and variables (parity 
and timing of intercourse) that noticeably changed the 
fecundability ratio (≥3%). In addition, we repeated 
model 2 and adjusted for gravidity (0, 1, and ≥2) instead 
of parity (parous and nulliparous). Furthermore, we 
stratified the results according to parity (parous versus 
nulliparous), intercourse frequency (<4 versus ≥4 
times/week), and timing of intercourse (yes versus no). 
Because women who have attempted pregnancy for sev-
eral months may change behaviors, we repeated the 
analyses including only those women who had started 
their pregnancy attempts within two cycles before study 
entry. Finally, we used restricted cubic splines to allow 
a less restricted fit of the relation between total alcohol 
consumption and fecundability.34 We used SAS version 
9.2 for all analyses.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or planning the study. Participants had the option 
to invite other women trying to conceive to visit the 
study website and join the study. All results are posted 
on the study website.
Results
In total, 4210 (69%) of the 6120 participants achieved a 
pregnancy during follow-up. The median age of partic-
ipants was 28 years at entry into the study, compared 
with 30 years for their male partners. More than two 
thirds of participants had attempted to become preg-
nant for two cycles or fewer at study entry. Overall, 
cohort retention was 88% (5379/6120). Relative to par-
ticipants who completed the study, the 741 (12%) partic-
ipants who were not under observation for the entire 
follow-up period were more likely to be nulliparous. 
However, the two groups were similar according to all 
other baseline characteristics, including alcohol con-
sumption (data not shown). Overall, few data were 
missing and imputation using either five or 100 imputed 
datasets produced similar results.
At baseline, median alcohol intake was 2.0 (inter-
quartile range 0-3.5) servings per week. More partici-
pants consumed wine (59%; 3591) than beer (38%; 
2346) or spirits (24%; 1464). Of the 6210 participants, 
2541 (41%) consumed a combination of at least two 
types of alcoholic beverage, and 1198 (20%), 311 (5%), 
and 222 (4%) participants consumed only wine, beer, or 
spirits, respectively. Older age of both partners, irregu-
lar menstrual cycles, physical activity, smoking, caf-
feine intake, history of sexually transmitted infections, 
lack of timing of intercourse, and short attempt time at 
study entry were associated with increased alcohol con-
sumption at baseline (table 1). By contrast, being 
parous and having low education were inversely associ-
ated with alcohol consumption.
Compared with no alcohol consumption, the 
adjusted fecundability ratios for consumption of one to 
three, four to seven, eight to 13, and 14 or more servings 
of alcohol a week were 0.97 (95% confidence interval 
0.91 to1.03), 1.01 (0.93 to 1.10), 1.01 (0.87 to 1.16), and 
0.82 (0.60 to 1.12), respectively (table 2, model 2). 
 
Adjustment for gravidity as opposed to parity had little 
effect on the fecundability ratios (data not shown). In 
addition, the fecundability ratios were broadly similar 
when we used baseline exposure data instead of time 
varying exposure data (data not shown) and when we 
restricted the analysis to women who had attempted 
pregnancy for two or fewer cycles at study entry 
(fecundability ratio 1.17 (0.23 to 1.99) for 8-13 servings/
week and 0.68 (0.23 to 1.99) for ≥14 servings/week).
The association between high alcohol consumption 
and lower fecundability varied by parity status and tim-
ing of intercourse (table 3 ). Among nulliparous women, 
the adjusted fecundability ratio was 0.76 (0.51 to 1.11) for 
consumption of 14 or more servings a week relative to 
none; among parous women, the fecundability ratio 
was 0.96 (0.58 to 1.59). Alcohol consumption of 14 or 
more servings a week was more strongly inversely asso-
ciated with lower fecundability for women who did not 
time their intercourse. Similarly to the categorical anal-
yses, the restricted cubic spline curve indicated little 
association between low amounts of alcohol intake and 
fecundability (fig 1 ). In contrast to the categorical anal-
ysis, the spline curve shows that the inverse association 
between alcohol consumption and fecundability may 
start at around 10 servings a week, but the width of the 
confidence interval lines widens above 10 servings a 
week. Compared with no alcohol intake, the adjusted 
fecundability ratios for women who consumed only

wine (≥3 servings), beer (≥3 servings), or spirits (≥2 
servings) were 1.05 (0.91 to1.21), 0.92 (0.65 to 1.29), and 
0.85 (0.61 to 1.17), respectively (table 2, model 2).
discussion
In this prospective study of women trying to conceive, 
consumption of the highest amount of alcohol (≥14 
servings a week) was associated with an 18% decrease 
in fecundability compared with no alcohol consump-
tion, although the confidence interval of the estimate 
was wide. However, the results did not support an effect 
of alcohol consumption at more moderate levels (one to 
seven servings a week). We observed no appreciable 
 
differences in the associations of consumption of beer 
and wine with fecundability, whereas the association 
between consumption of spirits and fecundability was 
slightly stronger.
strengths and limitations of study
Drawn from the general population, our study popula-
tion represents the full spectrum of fertility, including a 
mixture of highly fertile and less fertile women. The 
prospective design limits selection bias, as participants 
enrolled before pregnancy occurred. Study retention 
was high, and women with complete follow-up and 
 
partial follow-up had similar distributions of alcohol

consumption and most other baseline characteristics. 
Of course, some differences likely exist between our 
study population and all Danish women, as well as 
women in other countries. These differences should not 
affect the validity of comparisons between categories of 
women within our study. In addition, a recent valida-
tion study comparing well established perinatal associ-
ations among members of our internet based cohort 
and all other Danish women giving birth indicated that 
selection bias was not a major concern for the associa-
tions selected for study.35
We adjusted for a large number of potential con-
founders, including timing and frequency of inter-
course and last method of contraception. However, 
our data did not distinguish between regular drinking 
and binge drinking. This distinction may be important 
if large amounts of alcohol are consumed during the

fertile window during which menstrual cycle distur-
bances related to alcohol are most prominent.36  If 
binge drinking during the fertile window was preva-
lent among the participants, we may have overesti-
mated any association between regular alcohol 
consumption and fecundability. In addition, we 
lacked information on consumption of alcoholic bev-
erages by male partners, which may be related both to 
the female partner’s alcohol consumption and to 
decreased sperm  
quality.37 38  To reduce potential expo-
sure misclassification, we provided information on 
serving sizes via “pop-up boxes” in the online ques-
tionnaire, and alcohol consumption was updated 
during the follow-up period. However, self reported 
alcohol intake was not validated. If alcohol intake is 
inaccurately reported, it seems more likely to be 
under-reported.39 If under-reporting is consistent 
across levels of intake, the ranking of effects by alco-
hol consumption is likely to be as reported, but the 
amounts of alcohol that correspond to the reported 
effects would be greater than reported.
Comparison with other studies
Compared with other prospective studies,10 11 19  our 
study sample is relatively large; however, the number of 
women consuming 14 or more servings of alcohol a 
week and the number of women exclusively consuming 
one type of alcoholic beverage in amounts of more than 
two servings a week are small, so the estimates for these 
exposures are imprecise. Studies based on self reported 
retrospective time to pregnancy data and alcohol con-
sumption found results similar to ours—namely, that 
high alcohol intake (>14 drinks/week) but not low or 
moderate intake was associated with decreased fecund-
ability.15 
18  One prospective study of 259 couples, which 
compared weekly intake of less than five drinks with 
five to 10 and 10 or more drinks, found little association 
between alcohol intake and fecundability.19  In addi-
tion, in a recent nested case-control study of 686 
case-control pairs in which alcohol consumption was 
assessed at baseline and the outcome “women report-
ing difficulty to get pregnant” was assessed biennially, 
no association was observed for any level of alcohol 
consumption.12  In contrast, two prospective studies by 
Jensen et al and Hakim et al both reported an associa-
tion between low to moderate amounts of alcohol 
intake and fecundability.10 11  Among 430 couples with 
no previous pregnancy, Jensen et al reported adjusted 
fecundability odds ratios for one to five, six to 10, 11 to 
15, and more than 15 drinks a week of 0.61 (95% confi-
dence interval 0.40 to 0.93), 0.55 (0.36 to 0.85), 0.34 (0.22 
to 0.52), and 0.34 (0.11 to 1.07), compared with no alco-
hol intake.11  In a study of 124 women trying to conceive, 
Hakim et al and found that, compared with no intake of 
alcohol, drinking even less than one drink a week was 
associated with reduced fecundability. Their data, how-
ever, did not exhibit a consistent dose-response relation 
across levels of intake (0.43 (0.25 to 0.76), 0.40 (0.21 to 
0.77), and 0.65 (0.20 to 2.15) for less than one drink, one 
to seven drinks, and more than seven drinks a week, 
respectively).10 The difference between the results of 
these two studies and our study may be explained in 
part by differences in the study populations. Hakim 
et al excluded women with anovulatory cycles, and Jen-
sen et al included only nulliparous women. By contrast, 
we included all women trying to conceive. However, we 
stratified the analysis on parity and found that the 
inverse association did not vary consistently by parity, 
and as the numbers of participants in these subgroups 
were small, the observed variation may reasonably be 
explained by chance.
The other Danish study, based on retrospective ascer-
tainment of alcohol and time to pregnancy among 
29 844 pregnant women, found that wine drinkers at 
any level of consumption conceived more quickly than 
non-wine drinkers.16  Our study and that of Jensen et al 
did not corroborate this finding.11
The biological mechanisms by which alcohol could 
impair fertility are complex and poorly understood. 
Excessive alcohol consumption may adversely affect 
fecundability through alterations in endogenous hor-
mones.40 41  In a crossover study of 34 premenopausal 
women, Reichman et al found that an intake of 14 
drinks a week was associated with increased concentra-
tions of total estrogen and amount of bioavailable estro-
gen, compared with no intake.42  Similarly, in another 
study of 790 premenopausal women, consumption of 
more than 25 g of alcohol per day (approximately 14 
drinks a week) was associated with higher levels of sex 
hormones, compared with no intake.43 In a cross sec-
tional study of 498 non-pregnant women, Lucero et al 
found that the mean concentration of estradiol (E2) was 
3.42 pg/mL for women consuming less than one drink a 
day compared with 3.60 pg/mL for women consuming 
one or more drinks a day.44 Thus, consumption of high 
amounts of alcohol may affect endogenous hormone 
concentrations in a manner that reduces fecundability.
Conclusion
In summary, our study showed that consumption of 14 
or more servings of alcohol a week was slightly associ-
ated with reduced fecundability, but consumption of 
lower amounts seemed to have no discernible effect on 
fertility. Nonetheless, because the fetus may be particu-
larly vulnerable to alcohol during the first few weeks 
after conception, it would seem prudent for women 
who are actively trying to become pregnant to abstain 
from alcohol during their fertile window until a preg-
nancy has been ruled out.
