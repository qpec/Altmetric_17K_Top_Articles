IMPORTANCE The role of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for primary prevention of coronary
heart disease (CHD) remains controversial. Most prior longitudinal studies evaluated
self-reported consumption rather than biomarkers.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate biomarkers of seafood-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5ω-3),
docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5ω-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6ω-3) and
plant-derived α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3ω-3) for incident CHD.
DATA SOURCES A global consortium of 19 studies identified by November 2014.
STUDY SELECTION Available prospective (cohort, nested case-control) or retrospective
studies with circulating or tissue ω-3 biomarkers and ascertained CHD.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Each study conducted standardized, individual-level
analysis using harmonized models, exposures, outcomes, and covariates. Findings were
centrally pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was examined by age,
sex, race, diabetes, statins, aspirin, ω-6 levels, and FADS desaturase genes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident total CHD, fatal CHD, and nonfatal myocardial
infarction (MI).
RESULTS The 19 studies comprised 16 countries, 45 637 unique individuals, and 7973 total CHD,
2781 fatal CHD, and 7157 nonfatal MI events, with ω-3 measures in total plasma, phospholipids,
cholesterol esters, and adipose tissue. Median age at baseline was 59 years (range, 18-97 years),
and 28 660 (62.8%) were male. In continuous (per 1-SD increase) multivariable-adjusted
analyses, the ω-3 biomarkers ALA, DPA, and DHA were associated with a lower risk of fatal CHD,
with relative risks (RRs) of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84-0.98) for ALA, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.96) for DPA,
and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.96) for DHA. Although DPA was associated with a lower risk of total
CHD (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99), ALA (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95-1.05), EPA (RR, 0.94; 95% CI,
0.87-1.02), and DHA (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00) were not. Significant associations with
nonfatal MI were not evident. Associations appeared generally stronger in phospholipids and
total plasma. Restricted cubic splines did not identify evidence of nonlinearity in dose responses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE On the basis of available studies of free-living populations
globally, biomarker concentrations of seafood and plant-derived ω-3 fatty acids are
associated with a modestly lower incidence of fatal CHD.

A
review1 of experimental studies and randomized clini-
cal trials revealed a protective effect of ω-3 polyunsat-
urated fatty acids (PUFAs) on coronary heart disease
(CHD)riskpathwaysandclinicalriskfactors.However,keycon-
troversies remain. First, randomized clinical trials using fish
oil supplements have found mixed effects on CHD events.2-8
However, most trials provided supplements for a few years or
less and were conducted in patients with preexisting CHD or
at high risk for CHD and taking multiple cardiovascular drugs.
Furthermore, the background dietary intake in these trials was
not usually measured, and many participants may have had
adequate intake from diet alone. Thus, their generalizability
and relevance for long-term effects of dietary ω-3 PUFAs for
primary CHD prevention are uncertain. Second, although a
review9 of several prior observational studies found inverse
associations between seafood-derived ω-3 PUFAs and CHD
death, potential effects on nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI)
or total CHD are less clear. This review9 additionally found that
most studies also relied on self-reported dietary question-
naires, which may produce errors or bias in recall. A previous
review1 also found that a handful of studies have measured ob-
jective circulating or tissue ω-3 PUFA levels, but such find-
ings could be limited by publication bias. In addition, prior in-
dividual biomarker studies were generally underpowered to
explore potentially relevant differences in effects depending
on underlying participant characteristics, medication use, or
genetic variation. Thus, uncertainties remain about the ef-
fects of ω-3 PUFAs on CHD.
Most studies10,11 have evaluated combined intakes or bio-
marker levels of long-chain ω-3 PUFAs. However, individual
ω-3 PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5ω-3),
docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5ω-3), and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA; 22:6ω-3), may have shared and complementary
effects.10 Similarly, most prior research11 has focused on sea-
food-derived long-chain ω-3 PUFAs, and potential CHD ef-
fectsofplant-derivedα-linolenicacid(ALA;18:3ω-3)arefarless
understood.
To address each of these important questions, we devel-
oped a global consortium of available studies with circulating
or tissue ω-3 biomarkers and ascertained incident CHD. Our
aims were to evaluate the associations of individual seafood-
and plant-derived ω-3 PUFAs with incident total CHD, fatal
CHD, and nonfatal MI. We also explored dose response and po-
tentialheterogeneityineffectsaccordingtokeyunderlyingpar-
ticipant characteristics, including medication use. Our pri-
mary hypothesis was that biomarkers of long-chain ω-3 PUFAs
would be associated with a lower risk of incident fatal CHD but
not nonfatal MI.
Methods
Consortium Formation
The Fatty Acids and Outcomes Research Consortium (FORCe)
is an extension of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research
in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Fatty Acids Working
Group,12,13 originally developed to investigate effects of ge-
netic variation on biomarker fatty acid levels. Using direct ex-
pertcontactsandbyreviewingtheliterature,weidentifiedlarge
studies that had measured circulating or tissue biomarkers of
ω-3 PUFAs in general populations and had ascertained inci-
dent CHD. We focused on prospective (cohort, nested case-
control) studies; retrospective studies were included if fatty
acids were measured in adipose tissue at the time of the first
event, given the stability of adipose measures. Studies were
asked to join the consortium and participate in standardized
pooled analyses of biomarker fatty acids and clinical events.
Of 20 identified studies by November 2014, only 1 study14 de-
clined to join the consortium. All cohort participants gave writ-
ten informed consent according to their local guidelines. All
studies received approval from ethical oversight commit-
tees. Data were deidentified.
Analysis Plan
A standardized analysis protocol was developed and pro-
vided to each participating study, including harmonized defi-
nitions of populations, exposures, outcomes, covariates, ef-
fect modifiers, and methods for pooling across studies. These
specific methods are detailed below. An experienced analyst
from each study performed the analysis for that study using
individual-level data and provided all results to the lead in-
vestigator (L.C.D.G.) in standardized electronic forms.
Population
To understand the potential effects on primary prevention and
minimizereversecausation,participantsfromeachstudywere
excluded if they had a prior history of MI, angina, coronary re-
vascularization,orstroke.Allremainingparticipantswithmea-
suredω-3PUFAbiomarkerlevelswereincludedintheanalyses.

Assessment of CHD
We evaluated total incident CHD, defined as fatal or nonfatal
MI, CHD death, or sudden cardiac death; nonfatal MI, gener-
ally defined as chest pain with abnormal cardiac enzyme con-

Key Points
Question Are seafood and plant-derived ω-3 fats related to first
coronary heart disease (CHD) events?
Findings In a consortium of 19 studies, biomarkers of seafood and
plant-derived ω-3 fats were associated with a significantly lower
risk of fatal CHD. In contrast, associations with nonfatal myocardial
infarction were generally less robust.
Meaning Blood biomarkers of seafood and plant-derived omega-3
fats are linked to a modestly lower risk of dying from heart attacks.
Consumption of ω-3–rich foods should be encouraged.

tails of the methods for assessing and defining these out-
comes in each study are provided in eTable 1 in the Supple-

acid(AA;20:4ω-6),andtotaltransfattyacids(eachcontinuous).
For categorical variables, missing covariate data were included
as an indicator category.
Statistical Analysis and Pooling
Standardized study-specific analyses were performed for each
study using individual-level data. Because of variability in the
total number of fatty acids assessed across the different as-
says (12-58 fatty acids) and to permit comparison and pooling
of findings across the different biomarker compartments, each
fatty acid was analyzed continuously per 1-SD increase.
For prospective cohorts, Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models estimated the hazard ratio for incident total CHD,
nonfatalMI,andfatalCHD,withfollow-upfromthedateofbio-
marker measurement to date of event, end of follow-up, loss to
follow-up, or death, whichever occurred first. For prospective
andretrospectivematchedcase-controlstudies,conditionallo-
gisticregressionwasusedtoestimatethehazardratio(ifmatched
on time to event) or odds ratio. All analyses used robust SEs.
For pooled meta-analyses, hazard ratios and odds ratios
were considered to approximate relative risks (RRs). Meta-
analysis was performed using random effects models using the
method of DerSimonian and Laird.15 Results were first pooled
separately for each biomarker compartment and then pooled
together. If more than 1 biomarker had been measured in a
given study, main results included the biomarker that might
best represent diet: for long-chain ω-3 fatty acids, total plasma
orserum measureswereused,andforALA,adiposetissuemea-
sures were used in the main results.16
To assess potential noncontinuous associations, we also
evaluated study-specific quintiles for each biomarker com-
partment, performing meta-analysis within each quintile and
comparingeachquintile-specificpooledresulttothefirstquin-
tile. To statistically test potential nonlinear dose responses, we
performed multivariate meta-regression, modeling re-
stricted cubic splines.17 These analyses evaluated total plasma
and phospholipids; cholesterol esters and adipose tissue fatty
acids were not evaluated using splines because of fewer num-
bers of studies in these compartments.
OverallheterogeneitywasassessedusingtheI2statistic,with

tration (less than or greater than or equal to the median value
ineachstudy).Effectestimatesineachstudy-specificstratawere
pooled, and the statistical significance of differences between
subgroups of potential sources of heterogeneity was assessed
using meta-regression. In a meta-analysis13 of 7 studies with
available genetic data, we also examined potential interaction
byvariantsinFADS(OMIM208150)desaturasegenes(rs174546,
rs968567),poolingstudy-specificestimatesusinganadditivege-
netic model (eMethods in the Supplement). Within each study,
interactiontermsforeachsingle-nucleotidepolymorphism(SNP)
were constructed as a cross-product term of the ω-3 PUFA bio-
marker (continuous) by the SNP (ordinal: 0, 1, or 2 T alleles), in-
cluding the main effects in the model; these interaction terms
were pooled using meta-analysis.
Meta-analyseswereperformedusingSTATAstatisticalsoft-
ware, version 12 (StataCorp). We considered 2-tailed P < .05 to
be statistically significant.
Sensitivity Analyses
Several sensitivity analyses were performed. We also per-
formedcontinuousmeta-analysisusingabsolute(percentageof
fatty acids), rather than study-specific, units. To minimize po-
tential reverse causation attributable to preexisting subclinical
disease,weexcludedcasesidentifiedinthefirst2yearsafterbio-
marker sampling. To minimize exposure misclassification at-
tributable to within-person changes in biomarker levels over
time, we censored participants after the first 6 years of follow-
up. We performed additional analyses limited to prospective
studies only and those without self-reported CHD events.

(Nurses’Health Study [NHS]30 I and Health Professionals Fol-

distributions varied across biomarker types and study assays
(eTable 2 and eTable 3 in the Supplement), with coefficients
of variation less than 10% for most fatty acids and biomarkers
(eMethods in the Supplement). For example, median ALA con-
centrations were generally higher in adipose (0.72% of total
fatty acids) than in circulating biomarkers (0.20% of total fatty
acids), whereas EPA, DPA, and DHA concentrations were gen-
erally higher in phospholipids than in other compartments,
consistent with prior reports.16,36

years), 7973 incident CHD events, 7157 nonfatal MIs, and 2781
fatal CHD events occurred. Because not all studies ascertained
every exposure and outcome (Table 1), cases of nonfatal MI and
fatal CHD do not sum to the number of total CHD cases. Medi-
cationusevariedacrossstudies;bydesign,allparticipantsinthe
analysis were free of prevalent CHD or stroke (eTable 5 in the
Supplement). Most participants were white, but the Cardiovas-
cular Health Study (CHS)20 and Multi-Ethnic Study of Athero-
sclerosis(MESA)27includedrelativelyhigherproportionsofAfri-
canAmericanindividuals(12.3%and24.7%,respectively);MESA
and the Costa-Rican Case-Control Study of Myocardial Infarc-
tion (Costa Rican adults study)19 included Hispanic individuals
(24.9% and 100%, respectively), and MESA27 and the Singa-
pore Chinese Health Study (SCHS)33 included Chinese partici-
pants(25.0%and100%,respectively).Acrossallstudies,theme-
dian BMI was 26, and generally up to 30% of participants were
current smokers, except for higher rates in the Scottish Heart
Health Extended Cohort32 (44.6%) and Uppsala Longitudinal
Study of Adult Men35 50 (51.0%). Alcohol intake was modest,
with most participants consuming up to 1 drink per day. Fish oil
supplementationwasinfrequentlyassessedacrossstudies;use
waslow(0%-4%ofparticipants)in5of6studieswiththesedata
(eTable6intheSupplement);onlytheEuropeanProspectiveIn-
vestigation of Cancer (Norfolk) (EPIC-Norfolk)21 had a higher
prevalence (33%).
EPA, DPA, and DHA for Incident CHD
Incontinuous(per1-SDincrease)multivariable-adjustedanaly-
ses, each ω-3 PUFA was associated with an approximately 9%
lower risk of fatal CHD, with RRs of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00)
for EPA, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.96) for DPA, and 0.90 (95% CI,
0.84-0.96) for DHA (Figure 1 and Figure 2). There was mod-
erate heterogeneity in this association for EPA and DHA
(I2 = 37% for both) and low heterogeneity for DPA and DHA
(I2 = 0%and31%,respectively)(Figure1andFigure2).Thesum
of EPA, DPA, and DHA was associated with an 11% lower risk
of fatal CHD (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). By contrast, none
of the long-chain ω-3 PUFAs were significantly associated with
nonfatal MI (Table 2). We found that DPA, but not EPA or DHA,
wasassociatedwithasignificantlylowerriskoftotalCHD,with
RRs of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.99), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.87-1.02), and
0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-1.00), respectively (Table 2).
Some differences were observed when EPA, DPA, and DHA
wereevaluatedacrossquintiles(eTable7intheSupplement).Up-
per quintiles of EPA and DHA were associated with a lower risk
ofnonfatalMI(quintile5vsquintile1comparison:RR,0.71[95%
CI,0.56-0.90]vs0.87[95%CI,0.78-0.97]).TopquintilesofDPA
and DHA were associated with a lower risk of fatal CHD (quin-
tile 5 vs quintile 1 comparison: RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.65-0.90] vs
0.77 [95% CI, 0.64-0.89]) (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Across
biomarker types, inverse associations were generally stronger
in the phospholipid and total plasma compartments (Table 2);
heterogeneitydecreasedwhenadiposetissueandcholesteroles-
ter estimates were excluded from meta-analyses.
ALA and Incident CHD
In continuous analysis, ALA was associated with a 9% lower
risk of fatal CHD (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.98]) (Figure 1) but
not total CHD or nonfatal MI. For ALA, no single biomarker
compartmentconsistentlyhadstrongerassociationsacrossout-
comes.
Restricted Cubic Spline Analysis
Restricted cubic splines did not identify evidence of nonlin-
ear associations of any of the ω-3 PUFA biomarkers and out-
comes in total plasma or phospholipids (P for nonlinearity >
.05 for each) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Effect Modification
No significant differences in associations of ω-3 PUFA biomark-
ers with incident CHD events were observed by age, sex, ω-6
PUFA (LA or AA) concentrations, type 2 diabetes status, statin
use,regularaspirinuse,yearofbiomarkersampling,or(forALA)
EPA,DPA,andDHAconcentrations(Pforheterogeneity>.05for
each) (eTable 8 in the Supplement). In a post hoc meta-
regression, we observed no significant differences in associa-
tions by median length of follow-up (<10 or ≥10 years) (P for
heterogeneity > .05 for each). Effect modification was sug-
gestedbyethnicity.Comparedwithwhiteindividuals,ALAwas
associated with a significantly lower risk of nonfatal MI among
African American individuals (P for heterogeneity = .001). For
EPA, ALA was associated with a significantly lower risk of total
CHD and nonfatal MI among Chinese participants (P for hetero-
geneity = .02 and .01, respectively). Among 7 studies10,17,19,33-35
with SNP data (eTable 9 in the Supplement), no significant in-
teractionwasidentifiedbyFADSdesaturasegenevariants(eTable
10 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses
Compared with the main findings, no appreciable differ-
enceswereobservedafterexcludingcasesidentifiedinthefirst
2 years after biomarker sampling, censoring participants at the
first 6 years of follow-up, excluding retrospective studies, or
excluding studies with self-reported events (eTable 11 in the
Supplement). For 2 studies23,30 that analyzed phospholipids
in addition to total plasma (NHS I and HPFS), results were simi-
lar when phospholipid results from these studies were used
in place of total plasma in the meta-analysis.
Discussion
In this consortium which pooled individual-level harmonized
analyses from 19 studies, including 45 637 unique participants
and nearly 8000 first CHD events in 16 countries, the ω-3 bio-
markers ALA, DPA, and DHA were associated with a modestly
lower risk of fatal CHD. The magnitude of observed effect sizes
for fatal CHD (approximately 9% per 1-SD increase) are consis-
tent with findings for cardiac death from a meta-analysis8 of
trials. In contrast, associations with nonfatal MI were generally
less robust. Across these diverse studies, findings were consis-
tent by age, sex, ω-6 PUFA LA and AA levels, year of biomarker
sampling, presence or absence of diabetes, statin use, and aspi-
rin use. By contrast, effect modification by ethnicity was ob-
served for select exposure-outcome pairings. Separate analy-
ses by biomarker compartment provided further insights, with

and 0.13 for EPA and DHA, EPA and DPA, and DPA and DHA,
respectively).41 Thus, observed associations for any 1 of these
fattyacidsareunlikelytobefullyexplainedbytheothers.Com-
pared with EPA and DHA, comparatively less is known about
the molecular and physiologic effects of DPA; a previous
study10 suggests that DPA may inhibit ex vivo collagen-
stimulatedplateletaggregation,thromboxaneproduction,and
cyclooxygenase 1 activity. In addition, whereas circulating and
tissue levels of EPA and DHA are strongly influenced by di-
etary seafood consumption, DPA concentrations appear to be
mainly derived from endogenous elongation of EPA; intercon-
version between DPA and DHA is very limited.10
Given diverse global dietary sources, the effects of ALA on
CHD are of particular interest. However, a meta-analysis11 of
prior reports of dietary and biomarker ALA and CHD risk re-
vealedinconsistency,perhapsowingtomethodologicandana-
lytic differences in these investigations. A key strength of our
analysis was the prespecified, harmonized analytic plan using
individual-level data within each study, which allowed con-
sistent assessment of how ALA relates to CHD. In addition, the
inclusionof19studiesminimizedtheeffectofpublicationbias,
wherein studies with positive findings are more likely re-
ported. Compared with prior work,42 we also took advantage
ofafarlargernumberofevents(eg,>4-foldlargerforfatalCHD)

and observed a similarly lower risk of fatal CHD for ALA as for
long-chain ω-3 PUFAs. Mechanistically, these findings are sup-
ported by effects of ALA on thrombosis, inflammation, ar-
rhythmia, and endothelial function.43-47 Our findings, com-
bined with relative affordability, global accessibility, and
sustainability of ALA,48 support the potential importance of
ALA for improving global cardiovascular health.
The large number of cases in our analysis and inclusion of
multiple ethnic subgroups allowed us to explore potential ef-
fect modification in ω-3 PUFAs and CHD outcome associa-
tions by race/ethnicity. The stronger effects among African
AmericanandChineseindividualsforselectω-3–outcomepair-
ings could be attributable to differences in consumption pat-
terns, true biologic diversity in pathophysiologic pathways, or
chance. For instance, preparation methods among Chinese
populations could differ from that among white populations,

ways for cardiometabolic risk have also been documented
among Asian vs white populations; for example, Asian indi-

individuals,49,50 and at least 3 meta-analyses51-53 have re-

evidenceofeffectmodificationbycirculatingω-6PUFAs(LAor
AA), which have been hypothesized but never found in hu-
mans to reduce cardiovascular benefits of ω-3 PUFAs.55 Alto-
gether, our findings suggest that seafood and plant-derived ω-3
PUFAs are beneficial for fatal CHD prevention across diverse
population subgroups.
Our stratification by biomarker type provides new in-
sights on which lipid compartments may most influence CHD.
Adipose tissue has been suggested for measurement of fatty
acids because it reflects long-term dietary intake (approxi-
mately 1 year).56 However, EPA and DHA are more highly con-
centrated in phospholipids than other compartments, and
phospholipids also respond rapidly to dietary changes57,58 and
maybestreflecteffectsonmembranereceptors.1Thebestcom-
partment for assessing ALA has also been unclear, with pos-
sible advantages to adipose tissue16 but relatively little prior
evaluation of other compartments. Our findings suggest gen-
erallystrongerinverseassociationswithCHDforEPA,DPA,and
DHA in phospholipids and total plasma, although fewer esti-
mates and cases were available for adipose and cholesterol es-
ters compartments, decreasing precision. Our results sup-
port use of phospholipids or total plasma for long-chain ω-3
PUFA exposure and a need for further investigation of opti-
mal biomarkers for assessing ALA.
Our analysis has several important strengths. Use of bio-
markers provided measures of exposure free of recall error and
allowed separate evaluation of different ω-3 PUFAs and differ-
ent circulating and tissue lipid compartments. We used stan-
dardized definitions and modeling for the populations, expo-
sures, outcomes, covariates, effect modifiers, and analysis,
reducing heterogeneity and potential investigator bias. Most
studies18-25,27-35usedcentralizedadjudicationprocessesorreg-
istrylinkageratherthanself-reportaloneinascertainingevents,

sitivity analyses, suggesting the robustness of results to vary-
ing assumptions. Our inclusion of all available studies substan-
tially reduces the potential for publication bias. The studies
included both sexes, multiple races, and a range of socioeco-
nomic statuses across 16 countries, increasing generalizability.
Potential limitations should be considered. Relatively few
studies19,22,32,35wereavailableforsomelipidcompartments(eg,
adipose, cholesterol esters), limiting inference for these spe-
cificcompartments.Allcohortsassessedω-3PUFAexposureonce
atbaseline,andchangesovertimewouldattenuatefindingsto-
ward the null, causing underestimation of associations. Re-
duced statistical power in quintile analyses and spline analyses
made it difficult to ascertain the specific shape of dose re-
sponses. Because we analyzed observational studies, biomark-
ers and risk factors were not evenly distributed by randomiza-
tion of study participants; hence, unmeasured or residual
confounding cannot be excluded, and ω-3 biomarker measures
may in part be markers of a long-term healthy lifestyle. How-
ever, our findings were independent of a range of major cardio-
vascularriskfactors,andtherelativespecificityforfatalCHDand
known biologic effects of ω-3 PUFAs also argue against residual
confounding as the sole explanation for our findings. Because
our findings reflect habitual ω-3 exposure for primary CHD pre-
vention, our results do not imply that fish oil supplementation
will necessarily reduce CHD events, particularly in the context
ofshort-termtreatmentorinthosewithpreexistingCHD.Aware-
nessofω-3PUFAs,laboratoryascertainmentmethods,andmedi-

Conclusions
Our pooled collaboration of global studies using biomarkers
ofω-3PUFAsinparticipantswithoutprevalentCHDrevealsthat
habitual consumption of seafood and plant-based ω-3 PUFAs
is associated with a modestly lower risk of fatal CHD.
