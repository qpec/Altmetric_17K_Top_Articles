Abstract
Background: Sports injuries impose physical and economic burdens on high school athletes, yet only 37% of high
schools have access to a fulltime certified athletic trainer (AT). Although intuitively there are multiple benefits of AT
coverage, research demonstrating the measurable effect of AT coverage on rates and patterns of injury is limited.
Our objective was to investigate the epidemiology of girls’ basketball and soccer injuries in high schools with and
without an AT.
Methods: We compared data captured by two similar sports injury surveillance systems during the 2006/07–2008/
09 academic years. High School Reporting Information Online (RIO) included a national sample of schools with ATs,
and the Sports Injury Surveillance System (SISS) included a sample of Chicago public high schools without ATs.
Results: Overall injury rates were higher in schools without ATs than schools with ATs in girls’ soccer (RR: 1.73, 95% CI:
1.51–2.00) and basketball (RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.45). Recurrent injury rates were even higher in schools without ATs
compared to schools with ATs in soccer (RR: 6.00 95% CI: 4.54-7.91) and basketball (RR: 2.99, 95% CI: 2.12–4.14).
Conversely, concussion rates were higher in schools with ATs than schools without ATs in soccer (RR: 8.05, 95% CI: 2.
00–32.51) and basketball (RR: 4.50, 95% CI: 1.43–14.16). Other injury patterns were similar between the two samples.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of AT coverage of high school girls’ soccer and basketball,
both in reducing overall and recurrent injury rates and in identifying athletes with concussions. Future studies should
evaluate the effect of ATs on other high school sports and on youth sports to determine if these findings are
generalizable across sports and age groups.
Background
Sports participation provides numerous benefits for
young people, including improved cardiovascular fitness,
lower obesity rates, better academic performance, and
lower rates of depression (Miller et al. 1999; US Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 1996). However,
sports participation will always include some inherent
risk of injury. In the 2008/09 academic year, an esti-
mated 7.5 million United States (US) high school stu-
dents participated in sports (National Federation of State
High School Associations 2014), with participants in just
9 of the most popular sports incurring an estimated 1.2
million injuries (Comstock et al. 2009). Sports injuries
impose physical, emotional and economic burdens on
high school athletes and their families, and are one of
the leading reasons why young people stop participating
in sports and physical activity (Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention 2018). The public health challenge
facing policy makers, clinicians, coaches, parents and
athletes is how to mitigate the injury burden associated
with sports to the lowest possible level so that young
people may stay involved as a way of incorporating phys-
ical activity as part of a healthy lifestyle.
Having certified athletic trainer (ATs) services available
to athletes in the high school setting has the potential to
reduce the number and severity of sports injuries. The
National Athletic Trainer’s Association and the Ameri-
can Medical Association endorse the presence of ATs in
secondary schools (National Athletic Trainer’s Associ-
ation 2018; American Medical Association 2018). ATs

 are licensed health care professionals who collaborate with
physicians on injury prevention, clinical evaluation and
diagnosis, immediate and emergency care, treatment and
rehabilitation, and professional health and well-being.
Examples of ATs’ skills applied at the high school level
include but are not limited to (1) developing and imple-
menting emergency action plans and pre-season condi-
tioning programs, (2) advising on safety of equipment,
weather, and field conditions, (3) providing first response
to and triage of acute injuries, (4) implementing treatment
and rehabilitation for injured athletes, and (5) determining
readiness for return-to-play after injury (National Athletic
Trainer’s Association 2018; Almquist et al. 2004). While
application of these skills is intended to reduce injury inci-
dence and severity, the effect of the presence of ATs on
sports injury rates and patterns in the high school setting
has not previously been directly measured.
The objective of our study was to investigate the epi-
demiology of girls’ basketball and soccer injuries in high
schools with and without an AT over the 2006/07–2008/
09 academic years using data from two injury surveil-
lance systems that collected injury information on both
sports during the same period of time. To our know-
ledge, no prior studies have been able to compare injury
rates and patterns in schools that have an AT with
schools that do not. The specific aims were to 1) calcu-
late injury rates in both samples; 2) describe patterns of
injury including injury type, body site injured, mechan-
ism of injury, whether the injury was new or recurrent,
and timing of injury during the season in both samples;
and 3) compare injury rates and patterns across samples.
Methods
High School RIO™
Data from the National High School Sports-Related In-
jury Surveillance Study, which gathers data via the
internet-based surveillance system Reporting Informa-
tion Online (RIO), were used. During the 2006/07–
2008/09 academic years, schools with a National Athletic
Trainers’ Association (NATA) affiliated AT with a valid
email address were invited to participate. Willing partici-
pants were assigned to one of 8 sampling strata based
on school size (< 1000 and ≥ 1000) and geographical re-
gion (South, Midwest, West, Northeast) (US Census
Bureau 2014) with 100 schools randomly selected (12 or
13 from each strata) to obtain a nationally representative
sample. If a school withdrew from the study, a replace-
ment school was chosen from the same strata.
Previous studies have described the methodology of
this large national high school sports-related injury sur-
veillance system in detail (Rechel et al. 2008; Castile et
al. 2012). In brief, ATs logged onto High School RIO
weekly to submit injury reports and athlete exposure
(AE) information for five boys’ sports (football, soccer,
basketball, baseball and wrestling) and four girls’ sports
(volleyball, soccer, basketball and softball). Injury reports
collected data on the athlete (age, height, weight, etc.),
injury (type, body site, mechanism, new versus recurrent,
etc.) and event (practice vs. game, etc.). ATs could view,
edit and update injury reports throughout the academic
year. An AE was defined as one athlete participating in
one practice or competition. During the 2006/07 aca-
demic year, a reportable injury was defined as one which
(1) occurred as a result of participation in an organized
practice or competition, (2) required medical attention
by an AT or a physician and (3) resulted in restriction of
the athlete’s participation for 1 or more days. For the
2007/08–2008/09 academic years, the definition of in-
jury was expanded to capture all concussions, regardless
of time loss. For this study, we included only girls’ soccer
and basketball injuries captured by High School RIO for
comparison with the Sports Injury Surveillance System
described below.
Sports Injury Surveillance System
Sports Injury Surveillance System (SISS) is a secure,
internet-based injury surveillance system that was de-
veloped for a previous study (LaBella et al. 2011) for
which injury and exposure data were collected from
111 girls’ soccer and basketball teams from 36 of the 80
Chicago public high schools offering those two sports.
Although the underlying purpose of SISS was a study
of knee injuries, data related to all injuries were col-
lected in this study. None of the schools employed ATs.
Coaches of enrolled teams were given forms to record
which athletes participated in each practice and game
and all injuries occurring during a practice or game.
Teams at SISS participating schools practiced only
three times per week. An injury was defined as one
resulting in time loss from a practice/game. An AE was
defined as one athlete participating in all or part of a
practice or game. Three research assistants (RAs) who
were students in medicine, physical therapy, and ad-
vanced practice nursing collected the coaches’ forms
weekly. RAs interviewed injured athletes and/or their
parents following signed parent consent to obtain in-
jury mechanism, injured body part, injury type (e.g.
sprain, fracture, contusion, etc.), whether the injury was
new or recurrent, type of medical evaluation and treat-
ment, and number of games/practices missed due to in-
jury. Interviewing occurred as soon as possible after
injury to minimize recall bias. All interviews were com-
pleted by the end of the respective sports season. When
available, physician’s notes, imaging study reports, and
operative notes were obtained to confirm diagnoses.
RAs entered all data into SISS, and could view, edit and
update injury reports throughout the study.

 Data analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Chi-
cago, IL) and Open Epi v.2.3.1 (CDC). Un-weighted case
counts were used throughout for ease of comparison be-
tween studies. Rate ratios (RR) and injury proportion ra-
tios (IPR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated, with the lower rate or proportion used as the
referent group. CIs not containing 1.00 were considered
statistically significant. Sample calculations follow:

Results
Overall injury rates
High school RIO (schools with ATs) captured 1,082,985
AEs and 2186 injury reports in girls’ soccer and girls’
basketball over the 2006/07–2008/09 school years. Dur-
ing this same time period, SISS (schools without ATs)
captured 126,266 AEs and 376 injury reports in the same
sports (Table 1). The overall injury rates in both sports
were significantly higher in schools without ATs than in
schools with ATs (girls’ soccer RR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.51–
2.00; girls’ basketball RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.45). In
both school settings, each sport had significantly higher
injury rates in competition than in practice (schools with
ATs: soccer, RR = 4.34, 95% CI: 3.86–4.89 and basketball
RR = 3.15, 95% CI: 2.77–3.57 and schools without ATs:
soccer, RR = 3.17, 95% CI: 2.43–4.13 and basketball RR
= 2.93, 95% CI: 2.11–4.05).
New versus recurrent injuries
Recurrent injury rates in both sports were significantly
higher in schools without ATs than schools with ATs,
6.00 times higher for girls’ soccer and 2.99 times higher for
girls’ basketball (Table 1). Recurrent injuries also repre-
sented a higher proportion of all injuries in schools without
ATs than schools with ATs in soccer (IPR: 3.46, 95% CI:
2.54–4.73) and basketball (IPR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.69–3.51).
Types of injuries
Strains/sprains were the most common types of injuries in
both sports in both school settings (Table 2). Distribution
of injury types was similar between the two samples, with
the exception of concussions. Concussion rates were sig-
nificantly higher in schools with ATs than in schools with-
out ATs in soccer (RR: 8.05, 95% CI: 2.00–32.51) and
basketball (RR: 4.50, 95% CI: 1.43–14.16) (Table 2). Con-
cussions also represented a higher proportion of all injur-
ies in schools with ATs than schools without ATs in both

Body site injured
The ankle was the most commonly injured body site in
both sports in both school settings (Table 3). Rates of ankle
injuries were higher in schools without ATs in both soccer
(RR: 2.65; 95% CI: 2.04–3.43) and basketball (RR: 1.54; 95%
CI = 1.05-2.05). Conversely, head/face injuries were sus-
tained at a higher rate in schools with ATs compared to
schools without ATs in both soccer (RR: 3.37, 95%CI: 1.48–
7.61) and basketball (RR: 3.90; 95%CI: 1.60–9.49).

 the exception of “player-apparatus/equipment” contact.
In basketball, rates of injury were significantly higher in
schools without ATs only in the “player-surface” and “no
contact/overuse” categories (Table 4). In schools with
ATs, the most common mechanism of injury in both
sports was “player-player contact” (42.5% for soccer and
36.8% for basketball) while in schools without ATs the
most common mechanism of injury in both sports was
“no contact/overuse” (44.7% for soccer and 36.2% for
basketball).
Timing of injury
Preseason injuries represented a higher proportion of all
injuries in schools with ATs compared to schools with-
out ATs in soccer (IPR: 5.05, 95% CI: 2.46–10.37) and
basketball (IPR: 4.50, 95% CI: 2.08–9.73). In girls’ soccer,
schools with ATs had the highest proportion of injuries
during the regular season (77.1%) followed by the
pre-season (18.0%) and post-season (4.9%), while schools
without ATs had the highest proportion during regular
season (91.6%), followed by the post-season (4.9%) and
pre-season (3.6%). Similarly, in girls’ basketball, schools
with ATs had the highest proportion of injuries during
regular season (76.0%), followed by preseason (21.3%),
and post-season (2.7%), while schools without ATs had
the highest proportion during regular season (88.5%),
followed by postseason (6.8%) and preseason (4.7%).
Discussion
This study, the first to directly compare rates and pat-
terns of sports-related injuries between high schools
with ATs and those without ATs, provides support for
position statements calling for greater AT coverage for
high schools. While findings from this small study of
high school girls’ soccer and basketball should be con-
firmed in future studies of larger and broader popula-
tions (i.e. larger samples, more sports), the reduced
number of all injuries and, more specifically, of recurrent
injuries in high schools with ATs indicates that ATs are
effective at primary, secondary, and tertiary injury pre-
vention in the high school setting. Explanations of ATs
effectiveness include: (1) ATs are able to work with ath-
letic directors, coaches, parents, and athletes to imple-
ment evidence-based injury prevention efforts, (2) ATs
are able to recognize, triage, and treat/manage injuries,
which may reduce severity and/or complications, (3)
ATs are able to facilitate rehabilitation programs, and (4)
ATs are able to monitor recovery to ensure that injuries
are fully rehabilitated before return to play is allowed.
Further studies are necessary to determine to what de-
gree each explanation may affect injury rates, but this
study is an important first step.
A growing body of research is providing empirical evi-
dence for the impact of the AT on the health and safety
of high school athletes. Dompier et al. and Kerr et al.
both reported that most high school athletic training
room visits were for injuries that did not result in time
loss (Kerr et al. 2015; Dompier et al. 2015). In a study of
high school football, schools that employed ATs fulltime
had
higher
overall
injury
rates
than
schools
with
part-time ATs, although this association disappeared
when restricted to time-loss injuries only (Kerr et al.
2016). These findings indicate that through recognizing
and treating a substantial number of non-time-loss in-
juries, ATs likely prevent at least some from becoming
time-loss
injuries
and
furthermore
may
reduce

 significant costs to injured athletes’ families who might
otherwise seek care in a medical clinic, urgent care cen-
ter, or emergency room. Results of these studies support
our findings that schools without ATs had higher rates
of time-loss injuries than schools with ATs, most likely
because non-time-loss injuries at schools without ATs
may progress to more serious time-loss injuries if un-
identified/untreated. Further, we found no contact/over-
use injuries occurred at a higher rate in schools without
ATs, suggesting that AT coverage provides a protective
factor perhaps though injury prevention or early inter-
vention for more minor injury. We were unable to fully
evaluate these theories because both the HS RIO and
SISS surveillance systems captured only time-loss injur-
ies. Another study comparing emergency preparedness
among schools with and without ATs in Oregon showed
that schools with ATs were more likely to implement
best-practices
components
of
emergency
planning
(Johnson et al. 2017). This also suggests that ATs play a
key role in injury prevention and mitigation.
Injury rates in girls’ soccer and basketball in this study
were similar to those of prior studies reporting signifi-
cantly higher injury rates in competition compared to
practice (Rechel et al. 2008; Khodaee et al. 2016). This
was true in both school settings. Interestingly despite
the consistency regarding competition and practice in-
jury rates, the preseason accounted for a higher propor-
tion of all injuries in schools with ATs compared to
schools without ATs for both sports. These findings in
schools with ATs are consistent with those in the college
setting where ATs are universally present, and preseason
accounts for a higher injury rate in practice than
post-season (Hootman et al. 2007). One possible explan-
ation is that high school athletes in schools without an
AT may end participation after a pre-season injury with-
out the coach realizing an injury was why the athlete left
the team. Another possible explanation is that ATs iden-
tify and treat more minor, non-time-loss injuries during
preseason enabling the athlete to return to play safely
and without subsequent injury. Athletes in schools with-
out ATs might play through unreported pre-season in-
juries or might not report them to the coach until later
in the season when the injuries have progressed to
time-loss injuries. Additional research is needed to test
these hypotheses.
Although rates of concussions were lower in schools
without ATs, this is unlikely because fewer concussions
are occurring in these schools. Identifying a concussion
is a complex process, and evidence suggests that more
than 50% of sports-related concussions go unreported
(Register-Mihalik et al. 2013; McCrea et al. 2004; Meier
et al. 2015). More likely, ATs are better skilled than coa-
ches and athletes in identifying signs and symptoms of
concussions and more adamant that athletes suspected
of concussion be removed from play until cleared for re-
turn by an appropriate health care provider. Having an
AT on site at practices and competitions may also allow
greater opportunity for athletes to report concussions.
Recent research has shown that although high school
athletes are generally aware of some signs and symptoms
of concussions, they are unable to recognize more subtle
or lesser known signs (e.g., irritability, emotional lability)
(McCrea et al. 2004). Wallace et al. reported that high
school athletes with access to an AT had more concus-
sion knowledge than those without such access and that
one of the most common reasons athletes give for not
reporting a concussion was not considering the injury
serious enough to require medical attention (Wallace et
al. 2017). If athletes in schools with ATs under-report
due to this belief, most likely athletes in schools without
ATs also discount the seriousness of concussions. Since
May 2009, all 50 states and the District of Columbia
have
passed
legislation
requiring
that
athletes
in
school-based sports displaying signs or symptoms of
concussion be removed from play and not allowed to re-
turn until they have been evaluated by and received writ-
ten clearance from a qualified health care professional
(Safe Kids USA 2018). Many of these laws also require
schools to provide coaches, parents and athletes with
education about concussion symptoms and the import-
ance of proper management before the start of the
sports season (Dompier et al. 2015). Further research
should assess legislation effectiveness and the roles that
ATs play in facilitating implementation and enforcement
of concussion legislation in the high school setting.
Our study has some limitations. There were small dif-
ferences in data collection methodologies between RIO
and SISS. The lower injury rates observed in schools
with ATs may be partly because RIO only included injur-
ies that required medical attention from an AT or phys-
ician. SISS included all injuries resulting in time loss
regardless of whether or not they required medical at-
tention. However, this limitation is probably minor, since
the percentage of injuries requiring physician attention
were similar for both RIO and SISS, and it is unlikely
that injuries captured by RIO causing an athlete to miss
a practice or game were not brought to the attention of
the school’s AT. A second limitation is that RIO injuries
were reported by an AT, while SISS injuries were cap-
tured via a multi-factor approach including report by
coaches, athletes’ parents and, when available, physi-
cians’ notes. A previous study (Yard et al. 2009) compar-
ing the recording of injury reports between ATs and
coaches found only 63.2% agreement on diagnosis.
While this is a concern, we believe this limitation’s effect
on our results was minimal given overall patterns of in-
jury were similar between the two samples. A third limi-
tation is that while the SISS captured all injuries, not
Pierpoint et al. Injury Epidemiology  (2018) 5:29 
Page 6 of 8
 just knee injuries, it was implemented as part of a study
on knee injuries. Thus, coaches may have been more fo-
cused on reporting knee injuries, and as a result, may
have been less aware of other injuries. This would actu-
ally be expected to under-estimate the overall injury rate
in schools without ATs, which would suggest the true
differences in overall injury may be even greater than
those reported in this paper, underestimating the effect
of ATs in reducing/preventing injuries. A fourth limita-
tion is that RIO included all concussions regardless of
time loss for the 2007/08–2008/09 academic years. How-
ever, there were only three concussions in RIO among
girls’ soccer and basketball players during this time
period that were associated with time loss of less than 1
day so this had no measurable effect on our findings. Fi-
nally, our study populations were not identical, and
likely differed in important ways. For instance, athletes
in schools with ATs may be more likely to live in socio-
economically advantaged areas with better access to
medical care and other resources, which may improve
overall health and fitness, and as a result, decrease risk
for injury. This may partly explain the lower injury rates
observed in the national sample of schools with ATs
compared to the small population of Chicago schools
without ATs. However, there are no national surveillance
systems currently in place equivalent to High School
RIO that capture injury and athlete exposure informa-
tion from schools without ATs. Because SISS and High
School RIO employed similar injury surveillance meth-
odologies during the 2006/07–2008/09 academic years,
this study represents the first opportunity to evaluate in-
jury rates and patterns over the same period of time in
schools with and without ATs.
Despite these limitations, this study provides import-
ant new information regarding the positive impact ATs
can have on improving health and safety of high school
athletes. The results of this study are significant because
currently only 37% of high schools have access to a
full-time AT (Pryor et al. 2015). Sports and recreation
governing bodies have long worried about litigation over
injuries sustained during sport (Fields and Young 2010;
Young et al. 2007). In a litigious society, the best way to
avoid a lawsuit is to mitigate risk by trying to prevent
the injury and by having a rapid, full, and appropriate re-
sponse to injuries that do occur (Register-Mihalik et al.
2013). The presence of an on-site AT in the high school
setting accomplishes both of these goals.
Various medical professional organizations have long
supported schools employing certified ATs to improve
the health and safety of high school athletes. In 1998,
the American Medical Association released a statement
supporting the need to create an Athletic Medical Unit
“in every school that mounts a sports program” and that
a recommended member of the unit be “preferably a
NATA BOC certified athletic trainer” (American Medical
Association 2018; Lyznicki et al. 1999). The American
Academy of Family Physicians also supports this position,
encouraging high schools to include an athletic trainer as
an integral part of the high school athletic program
(American Academy of Family Physicians 2018); the
American Academy of Neurology, too, recommends that
“a certified athletic trainer should be present at all sport-
ing events, including practices, where athletes are at risk
for concussion.” (American Academy of Neurology 2018)
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends efforts
should be made by football teams to have athletic trainers
at the sidelines during organized football games and prac-
tices (Tackling in Youth Football 2015)
Conclusions
Our study provides data which supports the positive im-
pact of high school ATs in reducing overall and recur-
rent injury rates and better identifying athletes with
concussions. Thus, our findings provide evidence-based
support for these position statements calling for greater
AT coverage for high school athletes. Future studies
should evaluate the effect of ATs on other high school
sports and on youth sports to determine if these findings
are generalizable across sports and age groups.
