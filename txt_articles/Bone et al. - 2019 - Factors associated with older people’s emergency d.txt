Background: Emergency department (ED) attendance for older people towards the end of life is common and
increasing, despite most preferring home-based care. We aimed to review the factors associated with older
people’s ED attendance towards the end of life. Methods: Systematic review using Medline, Embase, PsychINFO,
CINAHL and Web of Science from inception to March 2017. Included studies quantitatively examined factors
associated with ED attendance for people aged �65years within the last year of life. We assessed study quality
using the QualSyst tool and determined evidence strength based on quality, quantity and consistency. We narratively
synthesized the quantitative findings. Results: Of 3824 publications identified, 21 were included, combining data
from 1 565 187 participants. 17/21 studies were from the USA and 19/21 used routinely collected data. We identified
47 factors and 21 were included in the final model. We found high strength evidence for associations between ED
attendance and palliative/hospice care (adjusted effect estimate range: 0.1–0.94); non-white ethnicity (1.03–2.16);
male gender (1.04–1.83, except 0.70 in one sub-sample) and rural areas (0.98–1.79). The final model included socio-
demographic, illness and service factors, with largest effect sizes for service factors. Conclusions: In this synthesis,
receiving palliative care was associated with lower ED attendance in the last year of life for older adults. This has
implications for service models for older people nearing the end of life. However, there is limited evidence from
European countries and none from low or middle-income countries, which warrants further research.

Introduction
M
ost older people who are approaching the end of life prefer to be
cared for and die in their usual place of care,1 remaining in
familiar surroundings with family nearby and autonomy preserved.2
However, half of people aged 65years and over in the USA attend the
emergency department (ED) in the month before death.3 Trends in
the UK show that ED attendances in the last year of life are
increasing.4 Unplanned transitions to hospital may enable timely
access to health care services, but are often distressing and

 associated with poor outcomes. Approximately 70% of ED visits in
the last months of life end in hospital admission.3 Hospitalization
exposes patients to iatrogenic complications, such as hospital-
acquired delirium (prevalence 6–56%)5 and medication errors
(median prevalence 18%)6 and increases the chance of in-hospital
death.
Older people, while representing a heterogeneous population
group, are characterized by clinical and social factors that increase
their risk of poor care at the end of life.7 Living to advanced age is
associated with presence of multiple chronic conditions, frailty and
unpredictable illness trajectories.8 This presents challenges for the
care of older people, such as polypharmacy, symptom management
9
and uncertainty around initiating advance care planning.10 Social
isolation and neglect are also more common for people at older
ages, which influence health service use.11
From a public health perspective, a focus on older people’s ED
utilization towards the end of life is important and timely, given that
hospital utilization rises exponentially towards death,12 and the
population of older people reaching the end of life is increasing.
The global population aged over 65 years is projected to more
than double to 1.6 billion in the next 30 years,13 presenting one of
the major public health challenges of the century.14 ED attendance
and subsequent inpatient hospital care accounts for the highest ex-
penditure in end of life healthcare,15 while many people prefer
home-based care.1 It is therefore timely to understand older
adults’ ED use towards the end of life to optimize care provision
for current and future populations.
The factors associated with ED attendance in the months
preceding death for older people with non-cancer conditions have
never been synthesized. A review focussed on cancer patients found
that
male
gender,
black
ethnicity,
lung
cancer
and
low
socioeconomic status were associated with ED attendances at the
end of life.16 However, as people live into advanced age there is
increased prevalence of chronic non-malignant disease and multi-
morbidity17 with different end of life trajectories and health care
use.8 This limits generalization of findings from patients with
cancer to those with non-cancer conditions. We aimed to review
factors associated with ED attendance for people aged 65 years and
over within the last year of life to identify opportunities to improve
end of life care.
Methods
Design
Systematic review following the PRISMA statement and based on a
pre-agreed protocol. The review was guided by well-established
theory on determinants of health service use
18 and of place of care
at the end of life.19 Andersen’s behavioural theory posits that an
individual’s use of services is a function of ‘pre-disposing’,
‘enabling’ and ‘need’ factors, at individual and contextual levels.18
Gomes and Higginson’s model applied these theoretical principles to
determinants of place of care at the end of life, categorizing factors as
demographic, illness, and environment.19
Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria
Population aged 65 years and over (at least 90% of the sample aged
>65 years, or mean age of 70+ years where age range not provided);
examination of one or more factors associated with outcome of ED
attendance within the last year of life (including any time-period
before death).
Exclusion criteria
Case series, case reports and qualitative study designs. Studies
examining cancer patients only were excluded, because of limited
generalizability from cancer populations to non-cancer populations
and to allow for comparison of findings with a review on cancer
patients’ ED attendance towards the end of life.16
Data sources
We searched electronic databases (Medline, Embase, PsychINFO,
CINAHL and Web of Science) from inception to March 2017,
with no restrictions on time or language. We searched reference
lists from included and relevant studies, and articles citing these
studies. We also sought to identify grey literature by searching
websites of key not for profit organizations (Nuffield Trust, The
King’s Fund) and charitable organizations relating to end of life
care (Marie Curie, Macmillan).
Search strategy and study selection
Prior scoping in Medline and Embase ensured optimal sensitivity
and specificity of the search terms (Supplementary tables S1–S5).
Search results were screened initially by title and abstract, and
then full text. We screened against the stated eligibility criteria at
both stages. Articles for which there was uncertainty were double
reviewed (A.E.B. and S.N.E.), with disagreements discussed and
resolved within the research team.
Data extraction
One reviewer (A.E.B.) extracted data according to a pre-agreed pro-
forma and a 20% random sample was independently assessed for
accuracy (S.N.E.). We extracted information on study design,
setting, participant eligibility, population characteristics, sample
size, outcome definition, statistical analysis, explanatory variables
and
effect
sizes
with
confidence
intervals
(CIs).
Unadjusted
estimates were recorded only when no adjusted estimates were
available.
Quality assessment
We assessed study quality using the validated tool QualSyst, which is
flexible to study design.20 The assessment includes 14 criteria, each
scored from 0 to 2. Percentage of the total possible score indicates
quality grade: <50% low; �50 and <70% medium; and �70% high
(Supplementary table S6). A second author (S.N.E.) assessed a
random
10%
sample.
Scores
that
diverged
by
>10%
were
discussed within the research team.
Strength of evidence
We assessed the strength of evidence for each factor using an
adapted existing algorithm 19 based on the quality, quantity and
consistency of evidence (Supplementary figure S1). We independ-
ently double-assessed (A.E.B. and S.N.E.) the strength of evidence
for each factor, rating each as high, moderate, low or very low.
Data synthesis
Based on the underpinning models, we grouped factors as (i) socio-
demographic and pre-disposing factors (e.g. gender); (ii) illness-
related and need factors (.e.g. diagnoses) and (iii) service-related
and enabling factors (e.g. healthcare received).18,19 We converted
estimates of effect to odds ratios where possible and graphically
presented adjusted estimates only, including odds ratios, risk
ratios and rate ratios. We carried out a narrative synthesis of the
quantitative data, reporting the range of point estimates for adjusted
estimates
only.
Pooling
estimates
using
meta-analysis
was
considered. We developed a theoretical model of ED attendance of
older people in the last year of life underpinned by the principles of
existing theoretical models,18,19 excluding factors with very low
strength evidence.

 Results
Characteristics of included studies
We identified 3824 articles (figure 1) Following full-text screening
(n = 201) and double-review where there was uncertainty (n = 33),
21 articles were included with a combined sample of 1 565 187 par-
ticipants (table 1). Of the 21 included studies, 17 were from the USA,
three from Europe and one from Australia. Just under half of the
studies were rated as high quality (n = 10) while the remaining were
medium (n = 8) or low (n = 3) (Supplementary table S6). Most used
routinely
collected
population-based
data,
with
retrospective
analysis (table 1, Supplementary table S7). Four studies examined
interventions relating to palliative care;21–24 however, none used ex-
perimental designs. Four studies examined nursing home residents
only,23,25–27 and one study stratified findings by nursing home and
community.28
Four
studies
focussed
on
single
non-cancer
conditions (dementia29–31 and heart failure32).
Most studies defined the outcome as the proportion of people
attending the ED, including those with and without a subsequent
admission, while some focussed on only attendances with
33 or
without admission.23,27 Variation in definitions of the end of life
time-period, and explanatory factors complicated the comparison
across studies. Additionally, heterogeneity in populations and a
mix of estimate measures (odds ratios and rate ratios) precluded
pooling of estimates (Supplementary tables S7 and S8). Figure 2
presents the range of adjusted effect estimates for factors with high
or moderate evidence. For further details, Supplementary figure S2
presents a forest plot of effect estimates with 95% CIs for selected
variables, without quantitative synthesis.
Socio-demographic factors
We found high strength evidence that men were more likely to
attend ED than women in the last year of life.3,28,31,34,35 In five of
the six samples (all high-quality studies), men were more likely to
attend ED, four significantly so with adjusted odds ratios (AORs)
ranging from 1.04 to 1.83. Conversely, for one sample, community-
dwelling men with dementia were less likely to attend than women
(AOR 0.70). There was high strength evidence that Black, Asian and
Minority Ethnic people were more likely to attend ED (versus white
ethnicity), with a stronger effect observed for black ethnicity. Four
high-quality studies3,28,31,34 and one medium quality32 examined
this relationship; AORs ranged from 1.03 to 2.16. In four of the
five high-quality studies reporting the effect of age, older age was
associated with reduced likelihood of attending ED (moderate
evidence),
however
these
findings
were
mostly
non-signifi-
cant.3,28,31,34,35 We found high strength evidence that rurality
increased the likelihood of ED attendance from four high-quality
studies3,28,34,35; AORs ranged from 1.57 to 1.79.
Education (one study, overall very low strength evidence)28 and
income (two studies, overall low strength evidence)3,28 were rarely

 assessed, but no associations with ED attendance were reported. Two
high-quality studies investigated marital status28,35 finding that
people living in the community with a partner were more likely to
attend ED (low strength evidence).
Service-related factors
Six studies investigated associations between receipt of community
palliative care21–23,35 or hospice care3,33 or its timing, and ED
attendance in the last year of life, including three high-quality
studies. All studies found lower ED attendance in the palliative/
hospice care group, with AORs ranging from 0.1 to 0.94 (high
strength evidence). Three studies specifically investigated timing of
palliative or hospice care, finding that early referral reduced ED
attendance. Wang et al.33 found that late hospice enrolment
(�7 days
before
death)
was
associated
with
higher
ED
use
compared to no hospice (AOR 1.23, 95% CI, 1.12–1.26), while
medium (8–179 days) and long length (>180 days) enrolment was
associated with reduced ED use (AOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.95; AOR
0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.96, respectively).
Three high-quality studies presented the effect of being in a care
home on ED attendance (AORs 0.89–0.99).3,30,31 Overall, we found
moderate strength of evidence for no effect. The relationship
between advance care planning and ED attendance was examined
in two high-quality studies,3,36 both finding non-significant lower
odds of attending the ED for patients with advance care planning
(low strength evidence). Out of hours access to hospice physician34
or advice line24 were each examined by a high-quality study. These
studies found no relationship and a significant reduction in ED
attendance respectively (very low strength evidence).
Illness-related factors
Four studies examined primary diagnosis of cardiovascular dis-
ease,3,28,37,38 three of which found cardiovascular disease increased
ED attendance3,37,38 (moderate strength evidence). Two studies
report the effect of cancer versus non-cancer on ED attendance,3,34
and two report cancer versus heart failure.37,38 All found that people
with non-cancer diagnoses were more likely to attend ED than those
with cancer (AORs 1.05–1.37; moderate strength evidence). Two
studies each examined the effect of dementia27,28, stroke3,28and
lung disease3,28 (versus no dementia/stroke/lung disease), and one
study examined arthritis or rheumatism.28 None found evidence of
an association with ED attendance (low/very low strength evidence).
Three high-quality studies reported the relationship between mental
health and ED attendance, finding no evidence of effect (moderate
strength evidence).28,31,34 One study examined depression among
dementia patients and found a significant association with higher
likelihood of ED attendance.31
We found little evidence that number of comorbidities was
associated
with
ED28,34
(low
strength
evidence).
One
study
examined the effect of having different comorbidities alongside
dementia, and found positive associations with ED attendance, with
the strongest effect for hypertension (very low strength evidence).35
There was low strength evidence that cognitive impairment was
associated with lower ED attendance3,31 and very low strength
evidence relating to physical symptoms (pain).3
Theoretical model of older adults’ ED attendance in
the last year of life
We present the synthesized findings in figure 3. Service-related factors
include factors potentially amenable to modification by policy, com-
missioners, or practitioners. The socio-demographic factors represent
area- or individual-level targets for services, while the illness-related
factors are potential targets for intervention at a clinical level. The
solid lines represent associations from our findings, while dotted
lines represent associations between the factor groups based on
existing evidence or theory. There is evidence that socio-demographic
and illness factors are related to access to services. For example, older
patients, ethnic minority patients and non-cancer primary diagnoses
are each associated with lower access to specialist palliative care
services.39–41
Similarly,
there
are
well-established
relationships
between socio-demographic factors, particularly age and gender, and
illness factors such as diagnoses and comorbidities.42

 Discussion
In this systematic review, we extend knowledge by synthesizing
evidence from 21 studies including more than 1.5 million older
people, to identify service-related, socio-demographic, and illness-
related factors that are associated with ED attendance towards the
end of life. Identifying service factors is of particular importance
given that such factors are amenable to change. We present the
strongest evidence to date that provision of palliative or hospice
care to older people is associated with lower ED attendance within
the last year of life with mostly large effect sizes, and that earlier
provision strengthens this relationship. This corroborates findings
from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of home palliative care for
older people expected to be towards the end of life, which showed
significant reductions in ED attendance.43 This finding has potential
implications for service development for older people with non-
cancer conditions, who have historically not been the primary
recipients of specialist palliative care.
We found low strength evidence that advance care planning or
discussing preferences for place of care is associated with lower ED
attendance for older people towards the end of life, indicating that
high-quality future research is required to understand this relation-
ship. For family members who expected their relative to die, the
odds of attending ED were lower than those who did not expect
it. These findings suggest that recognition of end of life is important,
and family is key to involve in end of life discussions.
Provision
of
community
care
by
generalist
nurses
and
physicians is likely to be an important factor relating to ED
attendance, but was not considered among included studies. A
previous systematic review on determinants of ED visits among
older people (not necessarily towards the end of life) found that
perceived low availability of physicians was related to greater ED
use.44 There is also an important gap in evidence on the impact of
‘general palliative care’ provision by primary care practitioners,
who are typically older adults’ main care providers. In addition,
whether variation in social care explains ED attendance towards
the end of life was not reported, despite over a quarter of people
receiving social care in the last year of life, and the proportion
increasing with age.15
Examination
of
socio-demographic
and
illness
factors
are
important for understanding inequalities in care and to identify
potential targets for services. We found high strength evidence
that male gender, and black or minority ethnicity increased
likelihood of attending ED towards the end of life. A surprising
finding was the high strength of evidence for people in rural areas
being more likely to attend ED than in urban areas, despite lower
proximity to hospitals. These results do however corroborate
findings for cancer patients only, increasing confidence in these
findings.16 We found little evidence on patient-reported factors
such as breathlessness and anxiety, which are potentially key to
our understanding of why older people present to the ED towards
the end of life. Breathlessness is a prominent symptom in advanced
disease, which can be distressing for patients and their families.
Qualitative research has found disease-related anxiety to be an
important factor contributing to cancer patients’ ED attendance
towards the end of life.45
Three-quarters of included papers were published in the last five
years, demonstrating an increasingly strong evidence base, but gaps
in our understanding remain. The evidence is predominantly from
the USA, based on large routinely collected datasets. It is important
to interpret the findings with this context in mind, given the differ-
ences between the health system in USA and elsewhere. Despite
knowledge that hospitalizations in the last year of life are common
across European countries,46 few studies examining ED attendance
were conducted in European countries and there is a notable lack of
evidence from low- or middle-income countries. Most factors with
high strength evidence were those that are easily measurable in
routine
data,
not
necessarily
those
that
are
most
clinically
important, or amenable to change.
There has been a recent move to include ED attendance as a quality
indicator for end of life care. In North America, ED attendance is
already included as a key measure of intensity of end of life care for
cancer patients.16 However, whether or not high ED attendance is a
cause or consequence of poor quality care is untested. Qualitative
research has found that cancer patients and carers perceive hospital
as a place of safety and security during times of crisis and when care at
home breaks down.45 There is limited investigation of the views of
older people with non-cancer conditions on ED attendance towards
the end of life, which is a key area for future research.
A strength of this review is its robust and systematic methods,
which enabled comprehensive review of the evidence, with no re-
strictions on time or language. Building on existing theoretical
models, this study has developed our understanding of ED
attendance of older people, including non-cancer conditions, a
group which has previously been excluded. Including older people
with varying diagnoses and not focussing on a single disease type is a
strength, as it is more reflective of the population of older people
who increasingly have multiple problems and conditions. We
extracted data on both significant and non-significant associations
to minimize bias against negative findings.
This systematic review also has limitations. It was not possible to
make judgement about the appropriateness of ED admissions with
the data available. The strict focus on the last year of life for com-
parability meant that the inclusion of studies was weighted towards
observational studies, as RCTs at the end of life are less commonly
conducted and less likely to follow patients until death. Synthesis
across studies was limited by the variation in outcome definitions,
time-period before death, and population heterogeneity, precluding
meta-analysis. Additionally, causation between identified factors and
ED attendance cannot be inferred due to the nature of the evidence.
The dominance of evidence from the USA limits the generalizability
of our findings to other countries.
Conclusions
Receiving palliative or hospice care is associated with lower ED
attendance in the last year of life for older adults. These services
may enable older people to remain in their usual place of care and
reduce unplanned hospital ED attendance, in line with their prefer-
ences, by receiving timely care and treatment responsive to changing
needs. Focussing on improving access to palliative or hospice care
for non-cancer populations, and non-white ethnicities may also
reduce the inequalities we observed in end of life care. Our under-
standing of what drives the association between palliative or hospice
care services and ED in the last year of life remains limited,
suggesting a need for better evidence on the effectiveness of
models of community care for older adults towards the end of
life. There is also a need for better high-quality international
evidence on factors associated with older people’s ED attendance
from other European countries and beyond, particularly in low-
and middle-income countries, to optimize end of life care in
different healthcare systems.

Key points
� We have synthesized evidence from 21 studies including
over 1.5 million people on factors associated with ED
attendance for older people towards the end of life.
� Palliative/hospice
care is associated with reduced ED
attendance, supported by high strength evidence and
mostly large effect sizes, suggesting that investment in
these services for older people may prevent ED attendance
towards the end of life.
� Non-white ethnicity, male gender, living in a rural area and
non-cancer conditions are associated with higher ED
attendance, highlighting inequalities in end of life care that
require further attention.

Background: Opioids, antipsychotics and hypnotics are recommended for comfort care in dying. We studied their
prescription during the last 3 days in residents deceased in the long-term care facility (LTCF). Methods: In a
retrospective, cross-sectional survey in Belgium, England, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland, LTCFs,
selected by proportional stratified random sampling, reported all deaths over the previous 3 months. The nurse
most involved in the residents’ care reviewed the chart for opioid, antipsychotic and hypnotic prescription, cause
of death and comorbidities. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for resident characteristics.
Results: Response rate was 81.6%. We included 1079 deceased residents in 322 LCTFs. Opioid prescription ranged
from 18.5% (95% CI: 13.0–25.8) of residents in Poland to 77.9% (95% CI: 69.5–84.5) in the Netherlands, antipsych-
otic prescription from 4.8% (95% CI: 2.4–9.1) in Finland to 22.4% (95% CI: 14.7–32.4) in Italy, hypnotic prescription
from 7.8% (95% CI: 4.6–12.8) in Finland to 47.9% (95% CI: 38.5–57.3) in the Netherlands. Differences in opioid,
antipsychotic and hypnotic prescription between countries remained significant (P < 0.001) when controlling for
age, gender, length of stay, cognitive status, cause of death in multilevel, multivariable analyses. Dying from
cancer showed higher odds for receiving opioids (OR 3.51; P < 0.001) and hypnotics (OR 2.10; P = 0.010).
Conclusions: Opioid, antipsychotic and hypnotic prescription in the dying phase differed significantly between
six European countries. Further research should determine the appropriateness of their prescription and refine
guidelines especially for LTCF residents dying of non-cancer diseases.

Introduction
L
ong-term care facility (LTCF) residents in Europe evolve to a
highly dependent population with complex, often incurable
multi-morbidity.1
Consequently,
palliative
and
terminal
care
should be key components in LTCF care, with adequate pain- and
symptom-management as a priority.
Previous research documented a high prevalence of pain in LTCF
residents. In a cross-sectional study in three European countries, the
presence of pain varied between 32% and 57%. In nearly half of the
cases, pain was present every day and in over 50%, pain was rated
moderate-to-severe.2 A longitudinal study in the Netherlands
revealed pain prevalence up to 68%, with 41% of residents in
persistent pain.3 With regard to other symptoms, this study
