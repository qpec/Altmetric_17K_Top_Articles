Abstract
Rationale: Single-center randomized controlled trials of the Zephyr
endobronchial valve (EBV) treatment have demonstrated benefit
in severe heterogeneous emphysema. This is the first multicenter
study evaluating this treatment approach.
Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zephyr EBVs in
patients with heterogeneous emphysema and absence of collateral
ventilation.
Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter 2:1 randomized
controlled trial of EBVs plus standard of care or standard of care alone
(SoC). Primary outcome at 3 months post-procedure was the
percentage of subjects with FEV1 improvement from baseline of 12%
or greater. Changes in FEV1, residual volume, 6-minute-walk distance,
St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire score, and modified Medical
Research Council score were assessed at 3 and 6 months, and
target lobe volume reduction on chest computed tomography at
3 months.
Measurements and Main Results: Ninety seven subjects were
randomizedtoEBV(n = 65)orSoC(n = 32).At3months,55.4%ofEBV
and 6.5% of SoC subjects had an FEV1 improvement of 12% or more
(P , 0.001). Improvements were maintained at 6 months: EBV 56.3%
versus SoC 3.2% (P , 0.001), with a mean 6 SD change in FEV1 at 6
months of 20.7 6 29.6% and 28.6 6 13.0%, respectively. A total of
89.8% of EBV subjects had target lobe volume reduction greater than or
equal to 350 ml, mean 1.09 6 0.62 L (P , 0.001). Between-group
differences for changes at 6 months were statistically and clinically
significant: DEBV–SoC for residual volume, 2700 ml; 6-minute-walk
distance, 178.7 m; St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire score, 26.5
points; modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score, 20.6 points;
and BODE (body mass index, airflowobstruction, dyspnea, and exercise
capacity) index, 21.8 points (all P , 0.05). Pneumothorax was the
most common adverse event, occurring in 19 of 65 (29.2%) of EBV
subjects.
Conclusions: EBV treatment in hyperinflated patients with
heterogeneous emphysema without collateral ventilation resulted in
clinically meaningful benefits in lung function, dyspnea, exercise
tolerance, and quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile.

 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a
progressive, life-threatening, lung disease
characterized by airflow obstruction that
results in breathlessness and predisposes
afflicted individuals to exacerbations and
serious illness (1). Patients with advanced
emphysema remain one of the most at-risk
subpopulations. It is estimated that more
than 300 million people globally have
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
with considerable dyspnea caused by lung
hyperinflation, poor quality of life, few
treatment options, and a reduced life
expectancy (2–4).
Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS)
results in improvements in lung function,
dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and long-term
survival in appropriately selected patients
with emphysema (5–8). Although LVRS has
proven effective in selected populations, the
technique is relatively underused because
of concerns about the invasiveness of the
procedure, morbidity, and the narrow
patient eligibility criteria (9, 10). Zephyr
endobronchial valves (EBV; Pulmonx
Corporation, Redwood City, CA) are
one-way valves inserted via the
bronchoscope into the airways of
emphysematous lung, and are designed to
cause lung deflation (and hence a reduction
in hyperinflation) by allowing air and
secretions out but preventing air entry.
Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction
with Zephyr EBVs aims to provide the
benefits seen with LVRS but with a
reduction in morbidity. The VENT (Valves
for Emphysema Palliation Trial) study
achieved statistical but not clinically
meaningful improvements in FEV1 and
6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) between
EBV-treated and control groups (11), with
post hoc analysis showing that improvements
in these outcomes were clinically meaningful
only in patients with no collateral ventilation
(CV) between the target and ipsilateral lobes
(11, 12). Zephyr EBVs have been shown to
cause target lobe volume reduction (TLVR) in
patients without CV and where lobar
occlusion is achieved (13, 14). Clinically and
statistically meaningful benefits in multiple
outcome measures have been demonstrated
in patients with heterogeneous (15, 16) and
homogeneous emphysema (16, 17). Two
single-center randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) (15, 16) have reported significant
benefits of Zephyr EBVs over best medical
care, and we now report the first
multicenter study in patients with
heterogeneous emphysema and without
CV. Some of the results of this study have
been previously reported in the form of an
abstract (18).
Methods
Study Conduct
This RCT enrolled patients between June
2014 and June 2016 at 17 sites across
Europe. The study was approved by the
respective ethics committees at each site,
and conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki (19). All
participating subjects provided written
informed consent.
Study Subjects
Eligible subjects were ex-smokers greater
than or equal to 40 years of age with severe
emphysema. Key inclusion criteria were
post-bronchodilator FEV1 of between 15%
and 45% predicted despite optimal medical
management, total lung capacity greater
than 100% predicted, residual volume (RV)
greater than or equal to 180% predicted,
and a 6MWD of between 150 and 450 m
(complete criteria provided in Section E1 in
the online supplement). High-resolution
computed tomography scans were analyzed
at an independent imaging core laboratory
using quantitative software (VIDA
Diagnostics, Coralville, IA) to measure
lobar volumes and emphysema destruction
by lobe. Heterogeneous emphysema was
defined as a greater than 10% difference in
destruction scores between target and
ipsilateral lobes.
Eligible patients underwent Chartis
(Pulmonx Corporation, Redwood City, CA)
assessment to determine the presence of CV
between target and adjacent lobes before
randomization. The Chartis Pulmonary
Assessment System is a validated system
designed to assess for the presence of CV
Sponsored and funded by Pulmonx Corporation, Redwood City, California.

At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Zephyr endobronchial
valves properly placed in segmental
and subsegmental airways in patients
with severe heterogeneous or
homogeneous emphysema with no
collateral ventilation between target
and ipsilateral lobe have been shown to
decrease hyperinflation by reducing
target lobe volume, thereby providing
clinical improvements in lung
function, exercise tolerance, and
quality of life.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: This first, multicenter,
prospective, randomized controlled
clinical trial of the Zephyr
endobronchial valves confirms findings
from two previous single-center
randomized controlled trials that in
patients with heterogeneous
emphysema distribution and absence
of collateral ventilation, these one-way
valves improve lung function, dyspnea,
exercise tolerance, and quality of life
over current standard of care medical
therapy.

 within isolated lung units. It consists of a
Chartis console connected to a balloon
catheter with a central channel that is used
to occlude the target lobe, and to
subsequently measure pressure and flow to
calculate resistance to airflow in that lobe,
and hence to quantify CV (13). Figure E1
shows examples of CV-negative and
CV-positive read-outs. Subjects who had a
CV-negative target were randomized in a
2:1 fashion (blocked design and concealed
envelopes) immediately after the Chartis
measurement into either the EBV group or
the standard of care alone (SoC) group. The
bronchoscopy procedure for subjects
randomized to SoC was terminated and
subjects recovered appropriately as per
institutional standards. Subjects
randomized to the EBV group underwent
immediate placement of Zephyr EBVs with
the intention of complete lobar occlusion
(12, 20). Subjects assessed to be CV-positive
were excluded (see Sections E2 and E3 for
complete details).
Where there was more than one
potential target lobe, the lobe with the
highest destruction score and lowest
perfusion as determined by scintigraphy was
assessed for CV first. If the primary target
lobe was CV-positive, or if the CV status was
not assessable, then the secondary target
lobe was evaluated (for further information,
see Figure E2).
Follow-up
Subjects randomized to SoC were
discharged after standard post-
bronchoscopy recovery, unless the treating
physician deemed an admission necessary.
Subjects randomized to EBVs were
hospitalized for at least 1 day and discharged
following a chest radiograph if there were no
complications/serious adverse events
(SAEs). Subjects were instructed to seek
immediate medical attention in the event of
symptoms of a potential pneumothorax.
EBV subjects were evaluated at 45 days with
a high-resolution computed tomography
scan to assess TLVR, and to verify whether
complete lobar occlusion had been achieved.
If necessary (TLVR ,50%, or incomplete
lobar occlusion), a repeat bronchoscopy
and valve revision/replacement was
performed.
Outcome Measures
All subjects were assessed at 3 months post-
bronchoscopy (SoC and EBV). For EBV
subjects who underwent valve replacement
or revision based on their 45-day
high-resolution computed tomography
scan, follow-up occurred 3 months after
the revision bronchoscopy. Subjects in the
SoC group were given the option of exiting
the study following the 6-month evaluation
if they wished to pursue EBV treatment,
or to continue in follow-up until 12 months.
Follow-up of the EBV group will
continue to 24 months (see study scheme,
Figure E3).
The primary endpoint was the
percentage of subjects in the EBV group at 3
months post-procedure who had an
improvement in the post-bronchodilator
FEV1 of greater than or equal to 12%
(protocol-defined minimal clinically
important difference [MCID]) compared
with the percentage of subjects in the SoC
group.
Secondary endpoints included
comparison between EBV and SoC groups
for the absolute and percent changes and
responder rates (percentage of subjects
achieving the MCID) at 3 and 6 months
for FEV1 (>12%), RV (<2430 ml), St.
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire
(SGRQ) score (<24 points), 6MWD
(>26 m), modified Medical Research
Council dyspnea score (<21 point), and
for the EBV group only, the absolute and
percentage change in TLVR at 45 days
post-procedure and the percentage of
subjects meeting the TLVR MCID of
greater than or equal to 350 ml (12) relative
to baseline. Safety was assessed through
review of all adverse events solicited at all
scheduled or unscheduled visits.
Statistical Analyses
The sample size calculation of 78 subjects
was based on proportions for the primary
endpoint of 12% or greater improvement in
FEV1 at 47% (EBV) and 13% (SoC)
estimated from the VENT study (11), a 2:1
randomization, 80% power, a = 0.05, a two-
sided chi-square test, and 15% drop-out
rate. For the intention-to-treat (ITT)
analysis, missing data were imputed using
the last observation carried forward
method. All statistical analyses were
performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Absolute and percent
changes from baseline were analyzed using
a fixed-effect one-way analysis of variance
(or analysis of covariance with baseline as a
covariate) model for normally distributed
data; otherwise the Wilcoxon rank sum test
was used. Categorical variables were
analyzed using a chi-square test. Section E4
provides details of the analysis populations.
Results
Two hundred and seventy-three subjects
were screened, with 125 subjects meeting the
inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 97
subjects deemed to be CV-negative were
randomized, 65 subjects to EBVs and 32 to
SoC (see CONSORT diagram, Figure E4).
The median (range) number of randomized
subjects per center was 5 (1–14). Baseline
characteristics were similar in both groups,
although the EBV group reported a worse
respiratory-related quality of life (P = 0.042)
and absolute but not percent predicted
FEV1 (P = 0.008) (Table 1; see Table E1).
Treatment Details
A median of four valves (range, 2–8) per
subject were implanted in the 65 EBV
subjects. Treatment distributions were 52%
left upper lobe, 22% left lower lobe, 15%
right upper lobe, 8% right upper and right
middle lobe combined, and 3% right lower
lobe. The median hospital stay for the
treatment visit was 4 days (range, 1–49) for
the EBV group and 1 day (range, 1–3) for
the SoC group. At 45 days post-procedure,
89.8% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater
than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean 6 SD of
1.09 6 0.62 L (P , 0.001). Individual subject
TLVR changes are provided in Figure E5.
Eighteen subjects underwent a repeat
bronchoscopy, 17 of whom had a revision
procedure, and 12 of those subsequently
developed significant TLVR.
Primary Outcome
At 3 months post-procedure, responder rates
(>12% improvement from baseline in FEV1)
in the ITT population were 55.4% in the
EBV group and 6.5% in the SoC group
(P , 0.001), and for the per protocol (PP)
population were 66.7% and 6.7%, respectively
(P , 0.001). These differences were maintained
at 6 months: ITT (EBV vs. SoC) 56.3% versus
3.2% (P , 0.001), and PP 66.3% versus 3.3%
(P , 0.001), respectively (Figure 1).
Secondary Outcomes
Statistically and clinically significant
improvements from baseline were seen at
both 3 and 6 months in the EBV group
compared with the SoC group for FEV1
(Figure 2A), 6MWD (Figure 2B), and
SGRQ score (Figure 2C). There was a

 decrease in RV (P , 0.001) (Figure 2D)
and BODE (body mass index, airflow
obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity)
index (points; P , 0.001) (Figure 2E) in the
EBV versus SoC group at both 3 and 6
months. The absolute and percent changes
from baseline at 6 months are summarized
in Table 2. Changes from baseline for EBV
and SoC groups and differences between
groups for the changes for the PP
population are provided in Tables E2–E9.
For each outcome measure, a
significantly greater number of subjects in
the EBV group met or exceeded the MCID
(Table 3; see Table E10, Figures E6–E8). In
post hoc analysis, 76.9% of the ITT
population and 90.2% of the PP population
achieved the MCID for at least one of
FEV1, 6MWD, and SGRQ at 6 months.
Following the 6-month evaluation, 30 of the
32 SoC subjects exited the study and opted
for EBV treatment.
Safety Outcomes
At 6 months, there were 44 respiratory-
related SAEs in 31 (47.7%) subjects in the
EBV group compared with four events
in three (9.4%) subjects in the SoC group
(P , 0.001; Fisher test), with most events
occurring within 30 days of the procedure
(Table 4). In the EBV group, the most
common SAE was pneumothorax, which
was managed according to a protocolized
pneumothorax management flow chart (21)
(see Figure E9). Other respiratory-related
SAEs during the first 30 days in the EBV
group included dyspnea (7.7%), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation
(4.6%), and pneumonia (4.6%). A summary
of all respiratory and nonrespiratory
adverse events is provided in Tables E11
and E12.

 Pneumothorax
Over the 6-month follow-up period, there
were 20 pneumathoraces in 19 of 65 (29.2%)
EBV subjects, with a median time to onset
of 1 day. Table E13 shows pneumothorax
rate by lobe treated. In 14 subjects, the
pneumothorax required an intervention
and/or hospitalization and was therefore
considered a SAE. Pneumothorax was
managed by observation only in eight cases,
and placement of chest drains in 11 cases.
In one case, the air leak was addressed
surgically. Seven subjects underwent a
second bronchoscopy for an adverse event,
five for valve removal for pneumothorax
management, one for valve replacement a
day after the initial procedure because of
expectoration of a valve, and one for loss
of effect. One EBV subject died of
in-hospital cardiac arrest as a complication
of pneumothorax. There were no differences
in any outcome measure at 3 or 6 months
in the EBV cohort between subjects who
experienced a pneumothorax (n = 19) and
those that did not (n = 46) (see Tables E14
and E15).
Discussion
This is the first multicenter, prospective
RCT of Zephyr EBV treatment in patients
with severe heterogeneous emphysema and
absence of CV. We found statistically and
clinically significant improvements in lung
function, exercise capacity, and quality of
life associated with Zephyr EBV treatment
compared with standard of care. Ninety
percent of subjects experienced TLVR,
indicating appropriate selection of
CV-negative patients and effective occlusion
of the target lobe following EBV placement.
Of significance, the EBV group had
improvements that exceeded the MCIDs for

Post hoc analysis of the VENT study
(11, 12) demonstrated the critical
importance of the absence of CV and
achieving complete lobar occlusion as
necessary elements for successful lung
volume reduction with EBVs. Although
visual evaluation of fissure completeness
has been useful in patient selection for
bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with
Zephyr EBVs (15), the physiologic
assessment of air flow using the Chartis
system has been more reliable (13, 16).
Using this approach, Klooster and
coworkers (16) successfully demonstrated
significant improvements in lung function
and exercise capacity in patients with severe
emphysema characterized by an absence of
CV. Similarly, Valipour and coworkers (17)
reported benefits in patients with
homogeneous emphysema. The findings of
the present multicenter RCT provide
further confirmation that patients carefully
selected for absence of CV experience
significant, meaningful reduction in treated
lobar volumes (mean, 1.09 6 0.62 L; P ,
0.001) with benefits in lung function,
dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of
life following Zephyr EBV placement.
The magnitude of benefits seen in this
study is comparable with those observed
after LVRS (8), but with reduced morbidity.
The mean change presented here in the
6MWD, a patient-centered outcome, is
three times the MCID, and similar to values
reported from a single center RCT (16).
Zephyr EBV treatment has the added
benefits of being suitable for both upper
and lower lobe disease and homogeneous
disease (17), and is a reversible procedure.
Valves were permanently removed in seven
subjects in our study with no associated
complications.
There were a greater number of SAEs in
the early post-procedure period (within the
first 30 d) in the EBV group than in the SoC
group (Table 4). Pneumothorax was the
most common adverse event, and was
managed according to published guidelines
(21). The occurrence of pneumothoraces

 and air leaks is a common side effect of
thoracic procedures, ranging from 4% to
42% after computed tomography–guided
biopsy (22, 23), 11.6% for endobronchial
coil treatment (24), and up to 90% of
patients within 30 days of LVRS (25). The
frequency of pneumothorax in the present
study (21.5%) was similar to other
published Zephyr EBV treatment studies
(16, 17), and the occurrence of
pneumothorax does not seem to negatively
impact clinical outcomes (26). Of note, 94%
(30 of 32) of the control subjects opted to
exit the study and receive Zephyr EBV
treatment after the 6-month evaluation.
Previous retrospective analyses have
demonstrated a survival advantage where
TLVR is achieved after Zephyr EBV
placement (27–29). A reduction of more
than 1 point in the BODE index has been
associated with a significant decrease in
mortality (30, 31) and the difference
between groups in the change in BODE
index in this prospective trial was 21.8
points. This is compatible with the recent
report by Klooster and coworkers (32),
and raises the hope of improved survival
in our subjects. This needs to be confirmed
in future studies and with longer follow
up data.
One limitation of this study is the
follow-up out to only 6 months, although
earlier single-center RCTs have reported
1-year follow-up data, demonstrating the
durability of this treatment (33, 34).
Subjects in the EBV group will be followed
out to 2 years, important for capturing
events that may be infrequent in a 6-month
window, such as exacerbations or mortality.
Another limitation is the absence of a sham
bronchoscopy in the SoC group, because
the treatment involves an intervention with
associated adverse events and the potential
for a placebo effect. However, unlike other
interventional devices for bronchoscopic
lung volume reduction, the benefit of EBV
treatment using a sham control has
previously been demonstrated (15), and
patients in the SoC arm in our study did
undergo bronchoscopy for the purposes of
Chartis examination (although this does
not mitigate against any placebo effect
associated with actual valve implantation).
Another potential limitation is the lack
of mandatory pulmonary rehabilitation in
the period before trial entry. Given the
randomized nature of the trial, any changes
or lack thereof associated with the
potentially variable provision of
preprocedure pulmonary rehabilitation
should be balanced across the two groups,
and therefore would not be expected to be a
significant factor in any between-group
differences.
Although there was an apparent
imbalance in the absolute FEV1, and to a
lesser extent SGRQ, at baseline between the
two groups (although not in the percent
predicted FEV1), which could have affected
outcome, analysis of covariance models
with baseline values as the covariate
resulted in the same P values as when using
the Student’s t test for all secondary
endpoints, indicating that the group
differences (EBV vs. SoC) are there despite
the groups having different baseline values.
The benefits of EBV treatment for
patients with severe heterogeneous
emphysema reported here, and for
homogeneous patients previously reported
by Valipour and coworkers (17),
demonstrate that EBV placement is an
effective treatment option in patients
without CV regardless of emphysema
distribution. The success of the treatment
requires accurate patient selection
including correct determination of the
absence of CV between target and adjacent
lobes, and expertise in the management of
procedural complications.

 Conclusions
EBV treatment in hyperinflated subjects
with heterogeneous emphysema without
CV in the target lobe results in clinically
meaningful and statistically significant
benefits in lung function, dyspnea, exercise
tolerance, and quality of life over current
standard of care medical therapy. Benefits
are in line with those seen with LVRS,
and the consistent trial results, potential
reduction in post-procedure morbidity,
and reversibility of the procedure position
Zephyr EBV treatment as a viable
treatment option in those who remain
symptomatic on maximal medical
therapy. n
