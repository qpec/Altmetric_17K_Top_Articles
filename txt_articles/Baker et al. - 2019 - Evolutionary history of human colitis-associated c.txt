Objective iBD confers an increased lifetime risk of 
developing colorectal cancer (crc), and colitis-associated 
crc (ca-crc) is molecularly distinct from sporadic crc 
(S-crc). Here we have dissected the evolutionary history 
of ca-crc using multiregion sequencing.
Design exome sequencing was performed on 
fresh-frozen multiple regions of carcinoma, adjacent 
non-cancerous mucosa and blood from 12 patients 
with ca-crc (n=55 exomes), and key variants were 
validated with orthogonal methods. genome-wide 
copy number profiling was performed using single 
nucleotide polymorphism arrays and low-pass whole 
genome sequencing on archival non-dysplastic mucosa 
(n=9), low-grade dysplasia (lgD; n=30), high-grade 
dysplasia (HgD; n=13), mixed lgD/HgD (n=7) and 
ca-crc (n=19). Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed, 
and evolutionary analysis used to reveal the temporal 
sequence of events leading to ca-crc.
results 10/12 tumours were microsatellite stable with 
a median mutation burden of 3.0 single nucleotide 
alterations (Sna) per Mb, ~20% higher than S-crc 
(2.5 Snas/Mb), and consistent with elevated ageing-
associated mutational processes. non-dysplastic mucosa 
had considerable mutation burden (median 47 Snas), 
including mutations shared with the neighbouring ca-
crc, indicating a precancer mutational field. ca-crcs 
were often near triploid (40%) or near tetraploid (20%) 
and phylogenetic analysis revealed that copy number 
alterations (cnas) began to accrue in non-dysplastic 
bowel, but the lgD/HgD transition often involved a 
punctuated ’catastrophic’ cna increase.
Conclusions evolutionary genomic analysis revealed 
precancer clones bearing extensive Snas and cnas, 
with progression to cancer involving a dramatic accrual 
of cnas at HgD. Detection of the cancerised field is an 
encouraging prospect for surveillance, but punctuated 
evolution may limit the window for early detection.
InTrODuCTIOn
Patients with IBD have an increased risk of devel-
oping colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the 
colitis-free population,1 2 and this risk is closely 
associated with the extent,2 3 duration1 and severity4 
of inflammation. There are a number of key pheno-
typic features that differentiate colitis-associated 
CRC (CA-CRC) from the more common sporadic 
CRC (S-CRC): CA-CRCs occur more frequently 
in patients of younger age,2 5 6 they are more often 
synchronous6 and they have higher frequency of 
mucinous or signet ring cell histology.7 Further-
more, rather than developing from a polypoid 
adenoma, CA-CRC is thought to often arise from 
flat dysplasia with indistinct margins, in a field of 
concomitant inflammation, scarring and pseudo-
polyposis, making endoscopic detection and resec-
tion challenging.8 
significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
 
► IBD confers an increased lifetime risk of 
developing colorectal cancer (CRC).
 
► Colitis-associated CRC (CA-CRC) is molecularly 
distinct from sporadic CRC, for example, there is 
a higher frequency of TP53 mutation while APC 
and KRAS mutations occur at lower frequency.
 
► Endoscopic surveillance for early detection of 
CA-CRC is fraught with challenges, and the rate 
of interval cancers remains very high.
What are the new findings?
 
► We provide the first quantification of the 
intratumour genetic heterogeneity in CA-CRC, 
and trace the spatiotemporal evolution of 
cancer from preneoplastic lesions and non-
dysplastic mucosa, using multiregion exome 
sequencing of fresh-frozen samples.
 
► Evolutionary divergence of sporadic and colitis-
associated cancers begins in the non-dysplastic 
colitic mucosa, well before the emergence of an 
identifiable lesion.
 
► Rapid ‘punctuated’ evolution of copy number 
alterations commonly demarcates the transition 
between low-grade and high-grade dysplasia.

GI cancer
The efficacy of colonoscopic surveillance programmes in 
patients with IBD is poor compared with that of the conven-
tional bowel screening programme. The rate of interval cancers 
in IBD is reported to be up to 30%, despite patients adhering 
to intensive surveillance protocols.9 Furthermore, the chance 
of identifying endoscopically undetected CA-CRC in patients 
undergoing immediate panproctocolectomy for dysplasia is 
approximately 25% for low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and 50% for 
high-grade dysplasia (HGD).6 These observations highlight an 
unmet clinical need for insight into the molecular events under-
pinning the development of CA-CRC, and the temporal patterns 
by which they accrue.
At the molecular level, the sequence of events leading to CA-CRC 
is distinct from S-CRC: most notably TP53 mutation is typically an 
early event in the former, detected in precancerous neoplasms10 or 
even in non-neoplastic mucosa,11 12 whereas TP53 mutations are 
rare in the adenomatous precursors of S-CRC.13 14 Aneuploidy can 
be present in non-dysplastic colitic epithelium,15 16 suggesting a 
role for chromosomal instability early in the genesis of CA-CRC. 
Furthermore, APC17 and KRAS18 mutations are reported to be less 
prevalent in CA-CRC than in S-CRC. Moreover, recent exome19 
and targeted sequencing20 of CA-CRCs has revealed a distinct set of 
genes bearing single nucleotide alterations (SNA) in CA-CRCs. The 
temporal history of this unique mutational complement is unde-
termined, but it is likely to be a consequence of the different selec-
tive pressures in CA-CRC versus S-CRC that result from chronic 
exposure to the inflammatory environment of the colitic bowel.19 20 
Further characterisation of the differences in evolutionary trajec-
tory between CA-CRC and S-CRC will guide improvements in 
clinical detection, molecular biomarker risk stratification and 
cancer chemoprevention, and offer new opportunities for targeted 
therapies.21
Here we have used multiregion exome sequencing and 
genome-wide copy number (CN) analysis to generate phyloge-
netic trees and determine the evolutionary history of CA-CRC.

Patient samples
Samples were obtained from University College and St Mark’s 
Hospitals, London, under multicentre ethical approval (London 
Stanmore committee, 11/LO/1613) and the UCLH Biobank, 
with patients giving informed consent for prospectively collected 
tissue. Additional samples were from the Manchester Cancer 
Research Centre Biobank (Project 13_NIWR_01), the Oxford 
University Hospitals (MREC 10/H0604/72) and the Royal 
London Hospital (REC 13/LO/1271). Clinical characteristics 
can be found in online supplementary tables 1–3. Neoplastic 
grading was performed by analysis of H&E stained sections by 
at least three expert histopathologists (MM, MRJ, MJ, LMW).
Fresh-frozen samples: Samples were collected from patients 
with long-standing (>9 years) ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s 
disease (CD) undergoing surgery to remove CA-CRC (ie, 
panproctocolectomy). For 10 patients we collected between two 
and five spatially distinct carcinoma samples, at least one sample 
of non-dysplastic mucosa and any synchronous lesions that were 
spatially separate from the primary carcinoma. For an additional 
three patients a single carcinoma sample was obtained. These 
samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and 
stored at −80C.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples: FFPE 
samples were obtained with ethical approval as stated above. T
welve 
CA-CRCs were obtained from the archive of St Mark’s Hospital, 
London, for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. 
A further 81 regions from 39 lesions of mixed histology, repre-
senting 19 patients with UC (LGD: 38, mixed HGD/LGD: 12, 
HGD: 23, CA-CRC: 7, pseudopolyp: 1) were obtained for analysis 
by low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS). An additional 25 
sporadic tubulovillous adenomas were obtained from Oxford for 
SNP array analysis. Thirteen S-CRCs were obtained from Univer-
sity College London Hospital for immunohistochemical analysis of 
β-catenin expression.
sequencing
Exome sequencing was performed on multiregion samples of the 
n=13 
fresh-frozen cases described above (for details see online 
supplementary materials and methods). Select variants were vali-
dated with Sanger sequencing (online supplementary table 4).
basescope in situ hybridisation
In situ hybridisation for the KRAS G12A mutation was performed 
as previously described22 using the BaseScope assay according 
to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, 
Newark, CA). Stained slides were digitised and mutant regions 
(displaying punctate red signal) were manually annotated using 
Adobe Photoshop CS6.
Data availability
Raw sequence data and SNP array calls, together with processed 
data, are available at the European Genome-Phenome Archive 
(EGA) with accession number EGAS00001003028.
statistical analysis
For testing two independent groups the Mann-Whitney U test was 
used. For testing more than two groups the Kruskal-Wallis test 
was used. Comparison of mutation frequency and arm-level copy 
number alteration (CNA) frequency between S-CRC and CA-CRC 
was performed using Fisher’s exact test. Results were considered 
significant when q<0.05, after using the Benjamini-Hochberg 
method to control the false discovery rate. For further details please 
see online supplementary materials and methods.

Mutational burden in CA-CrCs and surrounding mucosa
We performed whole exome sequencing (WXS) on fresh-frozen 
specimens representing CRC arising on a background of long-
standing (>9 years) colitis (n=10 
UC, n=3 Crohn’s colitis). Three 
patients had concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). 
For 10 of these patients we generated multiregion exome data 
by sequencing regions of carcinoma and non-dysplastic mucosa, 
significance of this study
how might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable 
future?
 
► Knowledge of the early genetic events that distinguish 
sporadic and colitis-associated disease can be exploited for 
subsequent biomarker development to provide precision 
molecular diagnosis of true colitis-associated lesions versus 
incidental sporadic disease.
 
► We show that the burden of aneuploidy increases with lesion 
grade, suggesting that aneuploidy may be a useful biomarker 
to risk-stratify low grade lesions.
 
► We identify recurrent early genetic mutations in the 
development of CA-CRC; these are potentially useful as 
targets for cancer chemoprevention.

in addition to other neoplastic lesions where possible (see online 
supplementary table 1) and called SNAs and small insertions and 
deletions (indels) against matched normal DNA (11 cases were 
called against whole blood, one against microdissected muscle 
and one against microdissected lymphocytes; online supplemen-
tary tables 5 and 6). Data from one patient (UC10) did not pass 
our quality control criteria for SNA/indel identification, and 
was therefore excluded from further mutational assessment and 
used only for CNA analysis. SNAs in TP53 (in four carcinomas) 
and KRAS (in two carcinomas) were validated using Sanger 
sequencing of microdissected carcinoma and non-dysplastic 
tissue (online supplementary figure 1A,B). Microsatellite insta-
bility (MSI) was identified in two cases (UC02 and UC09) from 
their high mutation burden (median 982 non-synonymous muta-
tions, 33 SNAs/Mb, online supplementary table 5), and verified 
using MSI sensor software. UC09 harboured a BRAF V600E 
mutation, UC02 was confirmed as MSI using fragment analysis 
(online supplementary figure 2A) and had loss of PMS2 protein 
expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC, online supplemen-
tary figure 2B). Single nucleotide variant and indel calls are 
provided in online supplementary table 6.
There was a non-significant increase in SNA burden in 
CA-CRCs compared with S-CRC (The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) data set23); microsatellite stable (MSS) CA-CRCs had 
a median of 104 (range 57–172) non-synonymous mutations 
per carcinoma (3.0 SNAs/Mb, range 1.2–5.8), 20% higher than 
TCGA S-CRCs23 (median 2.5 SNAs/Mb, figure 1A; p=0.1). MSI 
CA-CRCs showed the same suggestion of an ~20% 
increase in 
SNA burden compared with their S-CRC MSI counterparts (33 
vs 27 SNAs/Mb, figure 1) although again this was not statistically 
significant (p=0.4).
We analysed mutational burden in non-dysplastic tissue by 
extracting DNA from a region of approximately 0.5 
cm by 
0.5 
cm by laser capture microdissection (eight cases) or by needle 
macrodissection (two cases). Non-dysplastic tissue surrounding 
CA-CRCs showed considerable mutational burden (median 1.6 
SNAs/Mb). On average, this was significantly lower than that of 
CA-CRCs themselves (p=0.02, figure 1A), but was comparable 
in three cases (cases CD01, CD03, UC05; figure 1B). These data 
suggest that the underlying inflammatory process exerts a muta-
tional toll on the background mucosa, and implies that the SNA 
burden alone cannot necessarily differentiate untransformed and 
malignant cells.
recurrently mutated genes in CA-CrC
We searched for a novel mutational complement in our CA-CRCs 
by comparing the recurrently mutated genes with those in 
S-CRCs (TCGA data set23), and removing spurious mutation 
calls identified in previous studies.24 25 In figure 1C we report 
mutational frequency of 48 genes, 20 of which are recurrently 
mutated in ≥30% of CA-CRCs, and 33 of which are mutated 
in ≥5% of S-CRCs (five genes are mutated in both ≥30% of 
CA-CRCs and ≥5% of S-CRCs).
TP53 was mutated in every MSS CA-CRC examined, with 8/10 
carrying at least one non-synonymous exonic TP53 mutation, and 
the remaining two cancers carrying splice site mutations (online 
supplementary table 7). A total of 12 exonic TP53 mutations were 
identified (eight missense, two non-sense, two frameshift) and eight 
of these mutations (75%) were within the DNA-binding domain 
(amino acids 102–292).26 One carcinoma (UC01) even exhibited 
three different DNA-binding domain missense mutations, two 
of which have been reported to confer oncogenic gain of func-
tion to the p53 protein.27 Interrogation of the UC01 raw variant 
allele frequencies and estimated cancer cell fractions revealed that 
all three mutations are present at near-clonal frequency, thus it is 
probable that they arose at a similar time within the progenitor 
cell of the lesion. Furthermore, we were able to deduce that the 
p.Y234H and p.G245S mutations are present on the same allele (as 
they were present on the same raw reads). This case is an example 
of convergent evolution, indicating a strong selective pressure for 
loss of normal p53 function.
There was a prevalence of TP53 mutations in exon 7 (5/12, 
42%), with two of these occurring at codon 245, a known hotspot 
in S-CRC.28 It is noteworthy that in case UC07, the LGD biopsy 
displayed a TP53 p.R306X mutation, yet this variant was absent 
in the carcinoma itself, where instead a TP53 splice site muta-
tion was detected. TP53 mutation frequency in our cohort was 
not significantly higher than that of S-CRCs (CA-CRC=80% 
vs 
S-CRC=58%, q=0.4). Other common S-CRC driver genes that 
were mutated at similar frequency in our CA-CRC cohort included 
KRAS (CA-CRC=40% 
vs S-CRC=43%, q=1.0), PIK3CA (20% vs 
13%, q=0.9) and FBXW7 (30% vs 11%, q=0.2).
Confirming previous single-gene17 and next-generation 
sequencing (NGS)19 20 studies, we observed that mutation of 
the most common S-CRC driver gene APC was less prevalent 
in CA-CRC (CA-CRC=40%, S-CRC=75%, q=0.07). As previ-
ously noted,19 APC mutations were more prevalent in CD (2/3 
cases, 67%) than UC (2/7 cases, 29%; p=0.5). One CA-CRC 
carried a mutation in β-catenin (exon 3, p.D32G). We compared 
the levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic β-catenin (measured by 
IHC) in CA-CRC (n=8) and S-CRC (n=13; online supple-
mentary figure 3A,B), and found that cytoplasmic β-catenin is 
not significantly different (p=0.25 by Fisher’s test), however 
a greater proportion of CA-CRC samples have low levels of 
nuclear β-catenin (p=0.024 by Fisher’s test). CA-CRC samples 
with APC mutations did not have significantly higher levels of 
β-catenin (online supplementary figure 3A).
Sixteen genes were observed to be significantly more 
frequently mutated in CA-CRCs than in S-CRCs (figure 1C), 
therefore may be involved specifically in CA-CRC pathogen-
esis. Thirty-five per cent of the putative CA-CRC driver muta-
tions were ‘stopgains’, ‘indels’ or SNAs that were annotated as 
‘cancer’ by the FATHMM software,29 and the remaining 65% 
were of ‘unknown’ or ‘passenger’ status (see online supple-
mentary table 6). Notably, the list of putative CA-CRC drivers 
includes the well-characterised S-CRC driver gene ARID1A 
(CA-CRC=30%, S-CRC=5%, q=0.048). Also of interest is 
the gene CDH2 (N-cadherin), as the expression of mutant 
N-cadherin in mouse small intestine has been shown to induce 
a Crohn’s-like phenotype.30 Other notable genes that were 
mutated in at least 30% of CA-CRC, but mutated at very low 
frequency in S-CRC included POLG (DNA polymerase gamma, 
involved in mitochondrial DNA replication) and PAXIP1 
(involved in maintaining genome stability). Online supplemen-
tary table 8 provides a description of all 16 putative CA-CRC 
drivers and their functions.
We combined our CA-CRC mutational frequencies with 
previously published WXS19 (30 MSS CA-CRCs) and targeted 
sequencing20 (47 CA-CRCs) data sets (figure 1D and online 
supplementary table 9). With this larger sample size (n=87) 
we found significantly increased TP53 mutation frequency in 
CA-CRC (79% vs 58%, q=0.005) and very significantly reduced 
APC mutation frequency (20% vs 75%, q<0.001). A total of 22 
genes showed significantly different mutation frequency between 
CA-CRC and S-CRC, though there was little overlap between 
the set of mutant genes in the different studies (figure 1D and 
online supplementary table 9). Together, these data indicate a

potentially novel set of SNA driver mutations in CA-CRC, over-
and-above existing S-CRC driver genes.
evolutionary history of snAs
To probe the temporal sequence of cancer evolution, we 
constructed phylogenetic trees that showed the order of SNA 
acquisition for each of the nine multiregion sequenced CA-CRCs 
(figure 2; eight MSS, one MSI; samplewise mutation presence/
absence data in online supplementary table 10). The trees showed 
the mutational field shared between the cancer and surrounding 
mucosa (median 21 clonal SNAs per case, range 3–33, online 
supplementary figure 4A). An average of 16% of the mutations 
present in all regions of the CA-CRC (truncal mutations) were 
also found in the surrounding mucosa (range 0.3%–36.3%, 
online supplementary figure 4B).
Generally, the phylogenies had both long trunks (large number 
of clonal SNAs) and long branches (large number of subclonal 
SNAs), indicating the major carcinoma lineages were relatively 
genetically distinct from one another. In all but one case, the 
phylogenetic branches of the carcinomas were also roughly 
of equal length, indicating that there was no disparity of muta-
tional burden (a potential indicator of subclonal selection, as a 
faster dividing clone would accumulate mutations at a faster rate) 
in subregions of the carcinoma. We noted that the conventional

driver mutations (TP53, KRAS, APC) were clonal within carci-
nomas (with the exception of UC06). Together, these data indi-
cate evolutionary dynamics consistent with the ‘Big Bang’ model 
postulated for S-CRCs,31 where a cancer is formed with all the 
major driver mutations, rather than acquiring them sequentially 
after the initiation of cancer growth.
UC06 showed an interesting polyclonal architecture (figure 2). 
In this case, every carcinoma sample, and a surrounding region 
of HGD contained a clonal TP53 mutation, but the carcinoma 
was composed of spatially interwoven but genetically distinct 
clones bearing KRAS and APC mutations, respectively. The APC 
mutant clone had also developed an ARID1A mutant subclone 
(figure 2; ARID1A detected in a single region of carcinoma). To 
confirm the presence of a KRAS mutant subclone we performed 
in situ mutation detection using BaseScope. We found the KRAS 
mutant subclone was histologically indistinguishable from the 
KRAS wild-type (APC mutant) subclone, with the subclones 
demonstrating spatial restriction, yet with considerable inter-
mixing at the clone boundary (figure 2). These data confirm that 
APC mutation did not play a gatekeeping role in the develop-
ment of this carcinoma.
We examined the phylogenetic location of SNAs within our 
16 putative CA-CRC driver genes and found that they are often 
truncal (‘field mutations’, 9/30 mutations, 30%) or clonal within 
the cancer (9/30, 30%) indicating that mutations in putative 
CA-CRC genes are generally early events in tumorigenesis. 
However, they can also be found mutated only in non-dysplastic 
mucosa (9/30, 30%) or more rarely within a subregion of the 
CA-CRC (3/30, 10%).
Mutational signatures in CA-CrCs
Different mutational processes can give rise to distinct patterns 
of mutations across the genome termed ‘signatures’32 (where the 
patterns are defined by the relative frequencies of substitution 
type within the sequence context immediately 3′ and 5′ to the 
mutated base). To investigate the mechanistic processes that 
drive mutation acquisition in the inflamed colon we used WXS 
data to construct mutational signatures (n=12 CA-CRCs; see 
online supplementary figure 5 for individual carcinoma signa-
tures and online supplementary figure 6A for the composite 
96-channel signature of all carcinomas). MSS signatures were 
mostly composed of signature 1 (median 66.9%, online supple-
mentary figure 6B), which represents spontaneous deamination 
of 5-methylcytosine (an ageing-associated signature). There was 
no significant difference in the median contribution of signa-
ture 1 in CD cases (70.7%) and UC cases (63.9%, p=0.83). In 
MSS CA-CRC we also detected a considerable contribution of 
signature 5 (median 10.9%), a common cancer-associated signa-
ture of unknown aetiology that is also associated with ageing. 
As expected, the signatures of MSI cases UC02 and UC09 are 
largely dominated by signature 6 (defective DNA mismatch 
repair; online supplementary figure 6B).

The mutational signature regressions using the chosen set 
of signatures gave an average fit (mean R2) of 78% across 
CA-CRC samples (range 50%–90%). The fits were not signifi-
cantly different from those for S-CRC (p=0.14; mean R2 83%, 
range 14%–99%). These results suggest that there are unlikely 
to be additional mutational processes that are highly active in 
the CA-CRC data that are not also active in the S-CRC data. 
However, the possibility that other mutational processes are 
active cannot be ruled out.
We performed analysis of precancer, truncal (clonal) and 
branch (subclonal) SNAs separately, and found no signifi-
cant difference in the relative or absolute contribution of any 
signature (online supplementary figures 6C and D), providing 
no evidence of large alterations in mutational process activity 
between the precancerous colitic bowel, and early and late in 
cancer progression. Comparison of the mutational signatures 
of CA-CRCs to their S-CRC counterparts (TCGA data set23) 
showed that CA-CRCs tended to have slight (but not statisti-
cally significantly different) increases in the absolute and relative 
contribution of most signatures (online supplementary figures 
6E and F).
extensive CnAs in CA-CrCs
We analysed the genome-wide allelic CN profiles of the 13 carci-
nomas with WXS data and of a further 12 FFPE carcinomas 
assayed by SNP-array alone (n=25 carcinomas total; figure 3A). 
To validate selected individual chromosomal CN change, fluo-
rescence in situ hybridisation was performed in a subset of carci-
nomas (n=8; online supplementary figure 7 and supplementary 
table 11).
MSS CA-CRCs (n=20) had extensive CNAs, with a median of 
64.9% (range 8.3%–90.9%) of the genome showing either copy 
loss, copy gain or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH). 
There was no significant difference between CNA events in 
Crohn’s and patients with UC, with CD and UC cases showing 
similar proportions of the genome altered (61.0% vs 68.8%, 
p>0.99 by the Mann-Whitney test). We noted that large-scale 
genomic alterations are common in CA-CRC; four MSS carci-
nomas (20%) appeared tetraploid or near tetraploid, and a 
further eight MSS carcinomas (40%) appeared triploid or near 
triploid, features which did not appear to correlate with muta-
tion of TP53 or APC (figure 3A). Five cases were identified as 
MSI, and these displayed low levels of CNAs (median 3.0% 
genome altered, range 0.7%–5.4%). Online supplementary table 
12 provides the CN status of common CRC driver genes for 
each sample. It is notable that 5q22.2 (APC) allelic loss is more 
common in CA-CRC (9/20 cases, 45%) than in MSS S-CRCs 
(42/189, 22%, TCGA data,23 p=0.051 by Fisher’s test), perhaps 
indicating that Wnt signalling in CA-CRCs is disrupted by copy 
loss of APC rather than mutation.
To analyse which CNAs were altered specifically in CA-CRCs, 
we supplemented our WXS and SNP array data with LP-WGS 
data (n=7 CA-CRCs). This methodology detects copy-loss 
and copy-gain events but cannot resolve copy-neutral LOH 
(cnLOH) events. MSS CA-CRCs had a distinct profile of losses 
and gains as compared with MSS S-CRC (figure 3B; comparison 
with TCGA data23). At arm level, six chromosomal arms were 
significantly more likely to be gained in CA-CRC compared with 
S-CRC and 10 arms were significantly more likely to be lost, 
most notably 5q (57% vs 17%; OR=5.87; q<0.001) and 17q 
(37% vs 15%; OR=3.34; q=0.01, online supplementary table 
13). Furthermore, there were five chromosomal arms that were 
less likely to be lost in CA-CRC (online supplementary table 13). 
These genomic differences were despite S-CRC and CA-CRC 
having a similar proportion of the genome with losses or gains 
(excluding cnLOH events: 37.9% vs 41.2%, p=0.6, figure 3C). 
LGD colitis-associated lesions had similar proportions of the 
genome lost or gained to sporadic adenomas (7.5% vs 10.7%, 
p=0.4; n=25 
sporadic adenomas, assayed by SNP array), but 
colitis-associated lesions of higher grade tended to have a signifi-
cantly higher proportion of the genome with losses or gains 
(mixed LGD/HGD: 21.2% vs 10.7%, p<0.003; HGD: 44.0% 
vs 10.7%, p<0.001, figure 3C).
evolutionary history of CnAs
The data above indicated a potentially critical role for CNAs 
in the progression from benign to malignant disease in colitis. 
To map precisely when CNAs occurred during progression, 
we performed a cross-sectional analysis of CNAs in additional 
non-dysplastic mucosa (n=9), LGD (n=28), mixed LGD/HGD 
(n=7), HGD (n=13) and compared these data to our MSS 
CA-CRCs (figure 3B,C and online supplementary table 14). 
Non-dysplastic mucosa rarely contained CNAs, and if present 
they affected only a small percentage of the genome (median 
1.9%, range 0%–4.7%). LGD had significantly increased levels 
of CNAs (median 8.9%, range 0%–53.8%, p=0.006, figure 3C), 
with the most common alterations being gain of Chr7 (45%) and 
gain of Chr20q (45%; figure 3B). HGD had a much elevated 
CNA burden relative to LGD (median 44.0%, range 12.0%–
60.8%, p=0.0002; figure 3C) and many of the alterations 
evident in LGD were also evident in HGD, including the Chr7 
and Chr20q gains. HGD and CA-CRC (median 41.2%, range 
1.3%–86.9%) had similar total CNA burdens. These data show 
a progressive increase in CNA burden during progression, with a 
large increase in burden acquired at the LGD to HGD transition, 
where there is limited further evolution of CN. Together, these 
data point to a common and critical central role for CNAs in the 
development of CA-CRC.
To gain insight into the temporal accrual of CNAs, we built 
phylogenetic trees using CNA data alone (figure 4). Key arm-level 
CNAs of interest (derived from figure 3B) were manually anno-
tated onto the phylogenetic trees using the CNA events visible 
on individual genome-wide CN plots. We observed considerable 
heterogeneity in the phylogenies of the CNA trees. Case UC06 
(figure 4A) showed a long ‘trunk’ separating LGD from HGD/
CA-CRC, with short branches representing each HGD/CA-CRC 
biopsy. This indicates a large evolutionary distance between 
LGD and HGD/CA-CRC, and little continued CNA evolution 
of HGD/CA-CRC: a pattern indicative of punctuated genetic 
evolution where CNAs accrue and stabilise in the population in 
‘bursts’ rather than continuously over time. A similar relation-
ship was observed between the LGD and HGD biopsies of case 
UC23 (figure 4B), again indicating a punctuated evolution of 
CN state, with a large accrual of CNAs occurring at the transi-
tion from LGD to HGD. In other cases, there was evidence of 
ongoing genomic instability in HGD: UC10 showed consider-
able evolution of CN state after the HGD transition (figure 4C), 
indicated by the relatively short trunk, and long branches of 
the HGD biopsies. Case UC28 (figure 4D) also showed a large 
amount of CN evolution occurring within HGD, with some 
regions of HGD even containing a higher proportion of genomic 
alterations than the CA-CRC. Thus, although the proportion of 
CNAs distinguishes LGD and HGD, the resulting CN state is not 
always stable, and HGD/CA-CRC can display striking chromo-
somal instability.

DIsCussIOn
CA-CRCs are molecularly distinct from their sporadic counter-
parts: CA-CRCs have an increased burden of SNAs compared 
with S-CRCs, and these include recurrent mutations in genes infre-
quently mutated in S-CRCs and differential mutation frequency 
of genes commonly mutated in both tumour types. Moreover, 
CA-CRCs tend to have a high burden of CNAs with recurrent 
losses and gains distinct from S-CRCs. Here we have used multi-
region genomic analysis to reveal the evolutionary history of these 
differences. From a clinical perspective, understanding the origins 
of these genetic differences offers a route to precision molecular 
diagnosis, prevention and treatment of colitis-associated lesions.

Previous NGS studies of CA-CRC used WXS of FFPE 
CA-CRCs (n=33),19 and targeted sequencing of ~300 genes 
in FFPE CA-CRCs (n=47).20 Our WXS of fresh-frozen 
material revealed a mutation burden of 3.0/Mb, significantly 
higher than that reported for FFPE material19 (1.33/Mb, 
p<0.0001), presumably because of the necessity of strin-
gent variant filtering in the previous study.33 Nevertheless, 
we note that both WXS studies report elevated ‘accelerated 
ageing’ mutational processes, as evidenced by an excess of 
C>T transitions in CA-CRC. The three NGS studies report 
different mutation frequencies for key genes, most likely 
because of the relatively small sample sizes of each cohort. We 
suggest that our meta-analysis of these three studies (n=87; 
figure 1D) should provide the most accurate measurement of 
gene somatic mutation frequency in CA-CRC.
Our data reveal that the high SNA burden of CA-CRCs 
began accruing prior to cancer formation, in the non-dys-
plastic epithelium. Remarkably, the mutation burden of 
non-dysplastic tissue was as high as that of the established 
CA-CRC in a third of cases. Mutational processes were

dominated by ageing-associated signatures. This implies 
that the inflammation and injury-induced cell turnover 
that is required for intestinal repair and restitution comes 
with a potentially attritional biological ‘cost’ of mutation 
acquisition. Nevertheless, the mutations generated by this 
‘accelerated ageing’ process are inevitably subject to natural 
selection imposed by the microenvironment of the colitic 
bowel, leading to the emergence of a unique mutational 
composition of neoplastic lesions that arise from the field.21 
TP53 mutations were always present at clonal frequency in 
CA-CRCs (consistent with previous reports10–12), confirming 
that it is universally an early event in colitis-associated 
tumorigenesis (figure 5). Mutations in other conventional 
drivers (APC, KRAS, PIK3CA, ARID1A) were usually clonal 
within a carcinoma. On examining the clonality of 16 genes 
that were significantly more frequently mutated in CA-CRC 
we found that 60% were shared with the surrounding normal 
mucosa, or mutated at clonal frequency in the carcinoma, 
indicating they are common early events. Together, these 
data add to our previous candidate gene demonstration of 
field cancerisation11 34 by showing the extent of mutational 
burden present in surrounding non-dysplastic mucosa. This 
highlights the role of field cancerisation in the aetiology of 
CA-CRC and suggests that particular cellular phenotypes 
induced by somatic mutation undergo positive selection in 
the inflamed colon.35 These data are suggestive that assaying 
the mutations present in the inflamed bowel could provide 
an objective measure of the risk of colitis-associated cancer 
development.
CNAs also begin to accrue prior to cancer formation, with 
non-cancerous HGD lesions notably having a similar overall 
burden and frequency of particular chromosomal losses and 
gains as CA-CRCs. Aneuploidy is well known to precede 
or co-occur with dysplasia in CA-CRC,15 16 36 and fields of 
small region (<1 Mb) CN changes have been detected in 
the majority of patients with UC, particularly in those who 
progress to CA-CRC.37 Presumably, aneuploidy allows for 
rapid acquisition of adaptive phenotypes to enhance fitness 
and promote cell survival in the inflamed colon. Further 
work is needed to identify which loci are under selection 
on recurrently lost and gained chromosomes. Aneuploidy 
may also be a ‘side effect’ of p53 mutation, with the latter 
potentially associated with a survival advantage in colitis. 
Importantly, our data show a typical ‘sudden’ increase in 
CNA burden at the transition from LGD to HGD (figure 5). 
From a clinical perspective, this stark molecular distinction 
between LGD and HGD suggests a route to objective molec-
ular-based pathological diagnosis of tissue grade, though the 
apparent sudden ‘punctuated’ accrual of CNAs may imply a 
limited window for early detection of high-risk LGD lesions.
Our data are suggestive that CA-CRCs evolve according to the 
‘Big Bang’ model proposed for S-CRC evolution.31 We observed 
that (known and candidate) driver mutations were almost exclu-
sively present in the founder lineage of the tumour, the majority 
of CNAs occur prior to the onset of cancer growth, and phylo-
genetic tree shape analysis provided no evidence of differential 
selection between lineages, though the power of this latter anal-
ysis is limited. Together, these data are consistent with the notion 
that the final tumour expansion is initiated by a particularly 
evolutionarily fit clone, the expansion of which dominates the 
final tumour and attenuates the expansion of other (potentially 
marginally fitter) clones. Consequently, within tumour dynamics 
appear effectively neutral.38 39
In summary, our data show that the evolutionary trajectory 
of CA-CRC begins long prior to the development of CRC, 
in a hotbed of mutated, field cancerised, inflamed mucosa. 
While there are clear genetic differences between S-CRCs and 
CA-CRCs, there are also broad similarities with both cancer types 
having recurrent mutations in key CRC driver genes including 
TP53, KRAS and ARID1A, and showing evidence of similar 
mutational processes. Chronic inflammation does not appear to 
be mutagenic per se, but instead it accelerates mutation accrual 
and provides a distinctive selective pressure. Finally, the early 
specification of the mutational make-up of colitis-associated
