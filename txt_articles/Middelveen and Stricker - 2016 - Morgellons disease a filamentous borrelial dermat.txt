Morgellons disease: a filamentous borrelial 
dermatitis

Abstract: Morgellons disease (MD) is a dermopathy characterized by multicolored filaments 
that lie under, are embedded in, or project from skin. Although MD was initially considered to 
be a delusional disorder, recent studies have demonstrated that the dermopathy is associated with 
tickborne infection, that the filaments are composed of keratin and collagen, and that they result 
from proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in epithelial tissue. Culture, histopathologi-
cal and molecular evidence of spirochetal infection associated with MD has been presented in 
several published studies using a variety of techniques. Spirochetes genetically identified as 
Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto predominate as the infective agent in most of the Morgellons 
skin specimens studied so far. Other species of Borrelia including Borrelia garinii, Borrelia 
miyamotoi, and Borrelia hermsii have also been detected in skin specimens taken from MD 
patients. The optimal treatment for MD remains to be determined.
Keywords: Morgellons disease, dermatitis, Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, spirochetes
Introduction
Morgellons disease (MD) is an emerging dermopathy with worldwide distribution. 
The name “Morgellons” is derived from a disease recognized in the seventeenth cen-
tury in French children by Sir Thomas Browne. These children were noted to have 
“coarse hairs” protruding from their backs.1 The distinguishing feature of MD is the 
appearance of skin lesions with filaments that lie under, are embedded in, or project 
from skin (Figures 1 and 2). Filaments can be white, black, or brightly colored.2–6 Fur-
thermore, MD patients exhibit a variety of manifestations that resemble symptoms of 
Lyme disease (LD), such as fatigue, joint pain, and neuropathy.2–6 A study found that 
98% of MD subjects had positive LD serology and/or a tickborne disease diagnosis,5 
confirming the clinical association between MD and spirochetal infection. Conversely, 
6% of LD patients in an Australian study were found to have MD.7
The similarity between MD and an animal disease, bovine digital dermatitis 
(BDD), an acknowledged spirochetal infection that is associated with ulcerative lesions 
exhibiting keratin projections, was previously explored.6 Treponemal spirochetes are 
the primary etiologic agents of BDD.8,9 A causal relationship between spirochetal 
infection and filament formation was confirmed by duplication of the clinical disease 
via experimental infection with pure cultured treponemes.8,9 This prompted further 
investigation into the possibility of a spirochetal etiology for MD to discover if a 
similar disease process occurred at the cellular level.10–13

Histopathology of MD
Histological studies on MD tissue show that MD filaments 
are not textile fibers. They are biofilaments of human cellular 
origin produced by epithelial cells and stem from deeper 
layers of the epidermis, the upper layers of the dermis, and 
the root sheath of hair follicles.6,10,11 Histological studies 
established that these filaments are predominantly composed 
of collagen and keratin,10,11 and are nucleated at the base of 
attachment to epithelial cells,11 thus demonstrating human 
cellular origin. Staining of embedded filaments with Congo 
red resulted in apple-green birefringence suggestive of an 
amyloid component, although this remains to be confirmed 
by more specific studies (unpublished data). Staining of 
embedded filaments with calcofluor-white produced nega-
tive results, demonstrating that filaments are not cellulose 
as found in cotton, linen, or other plant-based textile fibers, 
or chitin as found in fungal cells and insect exoskeletons 
(unpublished data).
A preliminary study using scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) showed hairlike scales on a blue filament, suggesting 
that at least some MD fibers are hairs.10 The blue coloration 
of some fibers was first determined to be the result of melanin 
pigmentation as shown by positive Fontana Masson staining.11 
An independent study concurred that embedded blue fibers 
in an MD specimen (supplied by the authors of this paper) 
were not textile fibers. SEM revealed that the blue fibers were 
microscopic hairs with cuticular scaling, and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) revealed darkly stained mela-
nosomes that were not organized, a finding consistent with 
human hairs (Shawkey MD, unpublished data, 2013).
Microspectrophotometry reflectance data on fibers were 
consistent with patterns of pigmented tissues. Raman spec-
troscopy14 on two separate blue fibers showed relevant peaks 
that were indicative of carbamate compounds and melanin 
aromatic rings (Shawkey MD, unpublished observation, 
2016). Hence, independent studies using different method-
ologies provided evidence that Morgellons fibers are hairlike 
extrusions and that the blue coloration is the result of melanin 
pigmentation. Although the mechanism for coloration of red 
fibers is not yet understood, there are no known textile fibers 
colored by blue melanin pigmentation.11
Association of MD with Borrelia infection
Borrelia spirochetes have repeatedly been detected in MD 
skin and tissue samples (Figures 3 and 4). Initial studies 
confirmed the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto 
(Bb ss) spirochetes within dermatological tissue removed 
from MD lesions of four North American patients.11,12 
A  
subsequent study reported the detection and identification 
of Borrelia garinii in Morgellons skin samples obtained from 
an Australian patient.15 A larger study subsequently reported 
the detection of Borrelia spirochetes in 25 MD subjects.13 
Detection of Borrelia DNA by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing in two independent 
laboratories determined that the Borrelia spirochetes detected 
in these studies were predominantly Bb ss, but B. garinii and 
Borrelia miyamotoi were also reported. More recently, studies 
of MD specimens in two additional laboratories have detected 
Borrelia DNA of three Borrelia spp., Bb ss, B. garinii, and 
Borrelia hermsii.16,17 The fact that four different laboratories

Morgellons Disease
have been able to detect Borrelia DNA in  
Morgellons speci-
mens shows that these findings are reproducible.
Motile spirochetes identified as Borrelia spp. have been 
cultured in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK)-H medium 
inoculated with MD dermatological tissue. This demon-
strated that the spirochetes present in MD tissue are alive 
and viable.12,13 The culture of Borrelia spirochetes can be 
challenging because of fastidious growth requirements and 
pleomorphism.18,19 Therefore, PCR amplification of cultured 
spirochetes has been used to confirm the presence and pro-
vide molecular identification of live Borrelia spirochetes in 
MD dermatological tissue.13 The combination of Borrelia 
culture and PCR lends strong support to the clinical associa-
tion of spirochetal infection with MD.
Although the common denominator in the evolution of 
MD lesions seems to be infection with Borrelia spp., the 
etiology of MD is presumed to be multifactorial. Second-
ary etiologic factors such as genetic background, hormonal 
influences, immune status, and the presence of other coin-
volved infections appear to play a role in the development 
of this phenomenon.2–6 Other pathogens have been detected 
in Morgellons tissue samples. Strains of Helicobacter pylori 
and closely related bacteria were detected along with Bor-
relia spp. in tissue samples from MD lesions.20 One study 
detected Treponema denticola along with Borrelia spp. in 
some Morgellons specimens,12 while another study found H. 
pylori, T. denticola, and Bartonella henselae in Morgellons 
specimens.17 A putative role of Agrobacterium in MD has 
not been confirmed.
The precise mechanism of Morgellons filament forma-
tion has not been elucidated. In MD lesions, collagen and 
keratin filaments arise from proliferative keratinocytes and 
fibroblasts in human epithelial tissue.10,11 Borrelia has the 
capability to invade fibroblasts and keratinocytes and to rep-
licate inside these cells.21–23 We speculate that infection and 
replication of Borrelia within keratinocytes and fibroblasts 
alter keratin and collagen gene regulation. Furthermore, intra-
cellular sequestration of Borrelia may be a factor contributing 
to the development of refractory infection and MD. Borrelia 
spirochetes have been isolated in vitro from monolayers of 
keratinocytes and fibroblasts that were treated with antibi-
otics.21,22 Spirochetes were detected in MD dermatological 
tissue taken from patients who had been given aggressive 
antibiotic therapy.13 Persistent infection and resistance to 
antibiotic treatment may therefore result from sequestration 
of Borrelia spirochetes within keratinocytes and fibroblasts 
in MD patients.
The diagnosis of LD is controversial, and research show-
ing a connection between MD and LD has been challenged. 
A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) concluded that MD was not caused by a pathogen.24 
However, in that study the search for spirochetal pathogens 
was limited to nonspecific silver nitrate staining on a small 
number of tissue samples and commercial two-tiered sero-
logical LD testing as recommended by the CDC.24,25 Although 
Borrelia spirochetes can be readily detected in MD tissue, the 
use of sensitive and specific molecular methods is required.13 
Two-tiered serological testing for LD lacks sensitivity for 
a number of reasons, and seronegativity in positive cases

occurs.26,27 Detection of LD is complicated by the genetic 
diversity of Borrelia spp.28,29,30 Other methods such as PCR 
detection of Borrelia DNA and antigen detection are not 
standardized and vary in sensitivity and specificity.31,32 
Although these tests can be effective means of detecting 
Borrelia spirochetes in human fluids and tissues, they are not 
accepted as diagnostic by the CDC.13,25,32 Thus, the relation-
ship between MD and LD shown in clinical, histopathological 
and molecular studies remains controversial.
Historical view of MD
While the first reports of LD in the USA date back to the 
1970s,33 filamentous dermatological manifestations were not 
reported to be associated with Borrelia infection until 2005.2 
Although this temporal disparity may seem anomalous to some, 
there are explanations. Sir Thomas Browne’
s description of der-
mal hairlike extrusions coupled with movement sensations dates 
back to 1674.1 In 1938, Ekbom published a seminal account 
of delusional parasitosis with sensations of insects crawling 
on or under skin, and it is notable that many of Ekbom’
s study 
subjects had syphilis, a known spirochetal infection.34 LD is not 
a new disease: a 5,300-year-old mummy is the oldest known 
case.35 Thus, Morgellons cases may have occurred sporadically 
in parallel with LD, and the association between LD and MD 
may have gone unrecognized and unreported.
Misdiagnosis of MD is likely to be common as the 
filaments are microscopic and invisible without sufficient 
magnification or, if observed under magnification, may be 
miscategorized as textile fibers. One could also argue that 
because serological testing for LD lacks sensitivity,26,27 
patients frequently go undiagnosed. The few patients who do 
get a positive two-tiered test for LD are likely to be treated 
early for Bb infection and therefore may fail to develop MD. 
We see many MD patients who are diagnosed with other 
dermatological conditions (prurigo nodularis, eczema, etc) or 
mental illnesses, and thus were not tested for LD. Although 
MD is usually associated with chronic symptoms of LD, 
some patients develop MD lesions in conjunction with a 
documented tick bite and/or erythema migrans rash.
MD and psychiatric diagnoses
There are over 250 peer-reviewed articles linking LD 
and associated tickborne diseases to mental illness.36–38 A 
spectrum of psychiatric illnesses occurs in patients with 
neuroborreliosis, including paranoia, schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder, delusions, sensory hallucinations, major depression, 
and mania.39 Neurological symptoms associated with LD 
range in severity from marginal to critical, and can include 
 
cognitive impairment, dementia, insomnia, irritability, anxi-
ety, depression, personality disorders, psychosis, and suicidal 
or homicidal tendencies.37 The effects of microbial infection 
can impact neuronal functioning, and as a result of infection 
a prolonged inflammatory process can drive the chronic 
progression of neurodegenerative diseases.37,40
Levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines have been 
reported to increase in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients 
with neurological manifestations of LD.41 Similarly, elevated 
inflammatory markers that correlate with excess of immune 
cytokines have been described in MD patients.42 The outer 
membrane lipoproteins of Borrelia are proinflammatory and 
can mimic host antigens, theoretically resulting in autoimmune 
reactivity.37 The fact that elevated anti-nerve antibody reactivity 
can be found in pretreatment LD patients and in posttreatment 
patients with persistent symptoms supports this theory.37
Although MD may result from an infectious process, 
there may be a psychiatric component as well, and some (but 
not all) MD patients exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms. In 
a study of 25 Morgellons patients, 23 had prior psychiatric 
diagnoses including bipolar disorder, attention deficit disor-
der, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophre-
nia.42 The fact that MD patients may show neuropsychiatric 
symptoms complicates the diagnosis and explains why 
some health care providers consider MD to be a delusional 
disorder. To further complicate matters, some patients with 
MD who do not exhibit psychiatric abnormalities have been 
misdiagnosed with other conditions such as lichen sclerosus 
or prurigo nodularis.
Furthermore, lack of scientific knowledge has led patients 
to interpret the physical presence of dermal filaments and 
symptoms of formication as parasitic infection. In these 
cases, the false belief of parasitic infestation is not genu-
inely delusional because patients are in fact misinterpreting 
symptoms caused by aberrant production of human biofibers. 
Furthermore, we find that electrostatic energy and mechani-
cal energy can cause movement of filaments, interpreted by 
some patients as the movement of a living organism, and 
small insects such as fruit flies can adhere to open lesions, 
leading some patients to believe they are infested. If such 
patients do have a psychiatric condition such as OCD, then 
the false belief can be intensified or reinforced.
Hypothetically, some patients with delusional disorders 
could mistakenly believe they have MD. In addition, in our 
experience some LD patients exhibit crawling or stinging 
sensations, or can have ulcerative lesions – without devel-
oping associated dermal filaments. The overlap of mental 
illness, LD, and MD highlights the explicit need for a

Morgellons Disease
universally accepted clinical definition of MD. The follow-
ing case definition for MD has been proposed: a somatic 
Lyme-like illness associated with spontaneously appearing, 
slowly healing, filamentous and ulcerative skin lesions. The 
key diagnostic criterion is colored, white, or black filaments 
protruding from or embedded in skin. However, because 
there is an overlap of LD, MD, and mental illness with a 
spectrum of different symptoms, we recommend that LD 
be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with 
Lyme-like symptoms in conjunction with formication with 
or without ulcerations.
Clinical classification of MD
In a recent publication,13 we proposed a clinical classification 
scheme that reflects the duration and location of MD lesions:
1. Early localized: lesions/fibers present for less than three 
months and localized to one area of the body (head, trunk, 
extremities).
2. Early disseminated: lesions/fibers present for less than 
three months and involving more than one area of the 
body (head, trunk, extremities).
3. Late localized: lesions/fibers present for more than six 
months and localized to one area of the body (head, trunk, 
extremities).
4. Late disseminated: lesions/fibers present for more than 
six months and involving more than one area of the body 
(head, trunk, extremities).
As noted in that article, the classification scheme provides 
a medical framework that should help to validate and stan-
dardize the diagnosis of MD. Further studies are needed to 
determine whether this classification will have therapeutic 
and prognostic significance for MD patients.13
Treatment of MD
Since a clinical classification of MD has not been universally 
accepted, optimal treatment for the disease remains unsettled. 
Nevertheless, several therapeutic principles have emerged: 
1) the earlier the treatment is initiated in the course of MD, 
the better the outcome appears to be; 2) treatment should 
be aimed at the underlying tickborne disease; 3) prolonged 
combination antibiotic therapy may be necessary to eradicate 
dermopathy; and 4) antiparasitic therapy may be useful in 
some patients with MD. At this point, the most logical treat-
ment is supported by the guidelines of the International Lyme 
and Associated Diseases Society.43 Although treatment with 
antipsychotic agents has been proposed for patients with 
neuropsychiatric symptoms of MD, this treatment generally 
fails without concomitant therapy of the underlying tickborne 
disease.15 Additional approaches with agents such as dapsone 
merit further study.44
Conclusion
In summary, MD is an emerging dermopathy that is associ-
ated with Borrelia infection, and the growing number of 
MD cases reflects the increase in tickborne diseases around 
the world. Although some medical practitioners erroneously 
consider MD to be caused by a delusional disorder, studies 
have shown that MD is a somatic illness that appears to be 
triggered by Borrelia infection. The optimal treatment for 
MD remains to be determined.
