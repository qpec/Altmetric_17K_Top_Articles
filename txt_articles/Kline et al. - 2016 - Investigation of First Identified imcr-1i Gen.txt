On September 9, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
In 2015, scientists reported the emergence of the plasmid-
encoded mcr-1 gene conferring bacterial resistance to the 
antibiotic colistin (1), signaling potential emergence of a 
pandrug-resistant bacterium. In May 2016, mcr-1-positive 
Escherichia coli was first isolated from a specimen from a U.S. 
patient (2) when a Pennsylvania woman was evaluated for a 
urinary tract infection. The urine culture and subsequent test-
ing identified the gene in an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase 
(ESBL)–producing E. coli with reduced susceptibility to colis-
tin. The patient had no international travel for approximately 
1 year, no livestock exposure, and a limited role in meal prepa-
ration with store-bought groceries; however, she had multiple 
and repeated admissions to four medical facilities during 2016.
In collaboration with CDC, the Pennsylvania Department 
of Health conducted an investigation to guide contact tracing 
and perirectal swab screening for bacteria with the mcr-1 gene 
in the patient’s household and in two facilities where she had 
frequent, extensive, and prolonged (≥7 days) interactions with 
health care personnel. Within these three high-risk locations, 
transmission risk was stratified into higher-risk and lower-
risk categories based on the nature and duration of contact. 
Twenty persons at higher risk included the patient’s medical 
facility roommate, household contacts, home health person-
nel, friends who assisted with activities of daily living such 
as cleaning, bathing, rotating, ambulating and toileting, and 
a patient who developed an E. coli infection after receiving 
direct care from a caregiver who also assisted the index patient. 
Persons at lower risk included 98 health care personnel from 
the two high-risk facilities who directly assisted with activities 
of daily living while generally adhering to contact precautions. 
All 20 higher-risk contacts completed screening; among the 
98 lower-risk contacts, 78 agreed to testing.
To determine whether transmission was occurring between 
patients, the state health department offered to conduct point 
prevalence studies at the two high-risk facilities. One facility 
declined; the other offered testing to 18 patients residing in 
the same unit where the index patient had received care. Seven 
patients completed screening.
No bacteria with the mcr-1 gene were detected among 
the 105 persons screened. In addition, no colistin-resistant 
organisms were detected among 51 ESBL-producing isolates 
prospectively collected over a 30-day period from the four 
facilities to which the index patient was admitted in 2016. 
These findings suggest that the risk for transmission from 
a colonized patient to otherwise healthy persons, including 
persons with substantial exposure to the patient, might be 
relatively low.
The index patient was screened monthly to monitor 
colonization status. Perirectal swabs collected on May 31 and 
June 26 were positive for bacteria with the mcr-1 gene, but a 
swab collected on August 1 was negative. The patient received 
no antibiotics during this period, and there are no current 
recommendations to decolonize patients with Gram-negative 
bacteria in their gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known how the patient became colonized, especially 
in the absence of an epidemiologic link to known persons or 
places with identified mcr-1. Nonetheless, as more surveillance 
systems with broader testing are established, it is anticipated 
that mcr-1 will be identified with increasing frequency. In July, 
mcr-1 in E. coli was identified from a patient specimen collected 
in New York in 2015 (3), and mcr-2, another colistin-resistance 
gene, was discovered in porcine and bovine E. coli isolates 
(4). The emergence of these novel resistance mechanisms 
highlights the urgency of a more global and comprehensive 
approach to antimicrobial stewardship and preventing trans-
mission of antibiotic-resistant pathogens between persons and 
institutions. Health care personnel should immediately report 
colistin-resistant bacteria to their local health department. 
Health departments are encouraged to rapidly investigate 
reports of colistin-resistant bacteria to prevent transmission 
to other patients and thereby decrease the risk for transmit-
ting plasmid-encoded genes to bacteria that might already 
contain other resistance genes. The Pennsylvania Department 
of Health’s investigation suggests that focused screening of 
contacts at highest transmission risk can be recommended.
