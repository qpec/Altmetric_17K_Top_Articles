cigarettes

The widespread use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or e-cig) is a growing public health concern. 
Diacetyl and its chemical cousin 2,3-pentanedione are commonly used to add flavors to e-cig; however, 
little is known about how the flavoring chemicals may impair lung function. Here we report that the 
flavoring chemicals induce transcriptomic changes and perturb cilia function in the airway epithelium. 
Using RNA-Seq, we identified a total of 163 and 568 differentially expressed genes in primary normal 
human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells that were exposed to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, 
respectively. DAVID pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of cellular pathways involved in 
cytoskeletal and cilia processes among the set of common genes (142 genes) perturbed by both diacetyl 
and 2,3-pentanedione. Consistent with this, qRT-PCR confirmed that the expression of multiple genes 
involved in cilia biogenesis was significantly downregulated by diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in 
NHBE cells. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining showed that the number of ciliated cells was 
significantly decreased by the flavoring chemicals. Our study indicates that the two widely used e-cig 
flavoring chemicals impair the cilia function in airway epithelium and likely contribute to the adverse 
effects of e-cig in the lung.
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or e-cig) have gained popularity as a substitute for cigarettes or cigars, and they 
have been a gateway to cigarettes for those who never smoked1. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 
that the global market for Electronic Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Delivery Systems in 2015 was estimated to be 
$10 billion and about 56% was accounted by the United States of America2. As the popularity and use of e-cig 
continue to increase, there is an urgent need to assess comprehensively the chemical compositions and potential 
health effects of e-cig. Although concerns regarding e-cig primarily focus on exposure to nicotine3–6, e-cig con-
tains myriad chemicals, including carbonyl compounds, aldehydes, fine particulate matter, metals, propylene 
glycol, glycerol, formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)7–16. More recently, Allen et al.17 showed 
that flavoring chemicals are in over 90% of commercially marketed flavored e-cig.
The most common flavoring compound added to e-cig is diacetyl15,16, which is a small, volatile compound 
with butter-like aroma18. In the early 2000s, a series of studies reported a strong association between the produc-
tion of butter-flavored microwave popcorn and bronchiolitis obliterans (“popcorn lung”), an irreversible lung dis-
ease17,19. Diacetyl was the most prominent chemical in the butter flavorings and its effect was dose-dependent20–23. 
Likely because of the known link between diacetyl and “popcorn lung”, 2,3-pentanedione, which has similar 
flavor properties to diacetyl, was used as a substitute in some e-cig24. Indeed, Allen et al. found 2,3-pentanedione 
in nearly 50% of e-cig tested in 201617. Despite the widespread use of these flavoring chemicals in e-cig, there is a 
paucity of studies on potential adverse effects of these chemicals to e-cig users.
Some earlier rodent studies have shown that exposures to diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione damage airway epi-
thelium in mice and rats25–29. However, the mechanism underlying the adverse effects is not known; it is also not

known whether the flavoring chemicals similarly damage human airway epithelium. In this study, we utilized 
primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells that are cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) to 
mimic the in vivo airway characteristics30. Using RNA-Seq, we performed global transcriptomic profiling in pri-
mary NHBE cells exposed to diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione. Our data showed that diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione 
induced significant transcriptomic changes, including those related to ciliogenesis, in the primary NHBE cells. 
Consistent with the transcriptomic data, diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione-treatment decreased the number of ciliated 
cells in differentiated NHBE cell population, indicating an impairment of ciliogenesis in airway epithelium by the 
flavoring chemicals in e-cig.
Results
Transcriptomic profiling of human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to flavoring chemicals. 
 
To examine the effect of flavoring compounds on human airway epithelium, we utilized air–liquid interface (ALI) 
cultures of primary NHBE cells. NHBE cells cultured under ALI after 14 days differentiate into a mixture of 
ciliated cells, goblet cells as well as some remaining basal cells (Fig. 1A), thus closely mimicking human airway 
epithelium in vivo30. We first exposed differentiated mature primary NHBE cells (ALI culture day 14) to diacetyl, 
2,3-pentanedione, or vehicle control (H2O) for 24 h. The rationale for choosing 25 ppm diacetyl is that the pre-
vious study indicates that no observable adverse effect level for sub-chronic inhalation may be less than 25 ppm 
diacetyl28. In addition, extrapolation of the mouse dose-response relationship to humans suggested no sensory 
irritation to warn employees during acute diacetyl exposures at concentrations less than 20 ppm31. The concen-
tration of 2,3-pentanedione was selected because the lowest concentration with observable phenotypes such as 
bronchial fibrosis, cell morphology, or lung resistance ranges from 100 ppm to 150 ppm in vitro and in vivo29,32,33. 
LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) assay confirmed that diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione used at these concentrations 
did not induce significant cytotoxicity at 6 or 24 h (Supplementary Fig. S1). After 24-hour exposure to control, 
diacetyl, or 2,3-pentanedione, total RNAs from the cells were extracted and used for RNA-seq-based transcrip-
tional profiling (Fig. 1A). We constructed RNA-seq libraries, each with a unique barcode that allows multiplexing. 
To minimize the variation of sequencing runs, we pooled barcoded RNA-seq libraries for next generation deep

sequencing. We obtained an average of ~18 million reads per sample and tested for differential expression of 
GRCh37 Ensembl-annotated genes. Following stringent multiple testing corrections, we identified a total of 163 
and 568 differentially regulated genes after exposure to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, respectively, as shown in 
the volcano plots in Fig. 1B and C.
qPCR validation of differentially regulated genes by flavoring chemicals. 
We ranked the differ-
entially regulated genes for each treatment group by fold change. We then selected a total of 10 genes (five most 
upregulated and five most downregulated genes) with each treatment for qRT-PCR validation (Supplementary 
Tables S1 and S2). We treated ALI cultures of primary NHBE cells derived from three different donors with vehi-
cle control, 25 ppm diacetyl, or 100 ppm 2,3-pentanedione. For diacetyl treatment, out of the top 10 differentially 
expressed genes, qRT-PCR verified 6 genes that were significantly changed compared to control (Fig. 1D). Diacetyl 
treatment suppressed the expression of PAPSS2, CDC20B, MIR205HG, MACROD2, and SORCS2 and increased 
the expression of DHRS9 (Fig. 1D. p < 0.05). Expression of SNHG14, KRT13, and KRT4 was also increased with 
diacetyl treatment, but the changes were not statistically significant (Fig. 1D). For 2,3-pentanedione treatment, 
qRT-PCR confirmed changes in mRNA expression of PAPSS2, CPXM2, KRT16, and GPX2 (Fig. 1E, p < 0.05).
Functional Annotation Enrichment using DAVID. 
We then used the DAVID pathway analysis tool 
to identify ontological categories that were enriched among the differentially expressed genes induced by expo-
sures to flavoring chemicals. For the diacetyl treatment gene dataset, pathways related to “Cell projection”, 
“Cilium”, “Intermediate filament protein, conserved site”, and “Cilium biogenesis/degradation” were signifi-
cantly enriched (Table 1). For the 2,3-pentanedione treatment dataset, pathways related to “cell-cell adherens 
junction”
, “Ciliopathy”
, “cilium morphogenesis”
, “Cilium biogenesis/degradation”
, “Dynein”
, and “Cytoskeleton” 
were highly enriched (Table 2). The full list of enriched terms is available in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. 
Interestingly, pathways related to cilium and cilium biogenesis/degradation, were highly enriched in both diacetyl 
and 2,3-pentanedione datasets.
The identification of common pathways by the individual DAVID pathway analyses of the transcriptomic 
datasets is consistent with the chemical similarity between diacetyl (chemical synonym: 2,3-butanedione) and 
2,3-pentanedione. We further compared the lists of differentially regulated genes with the two flavoring chemi-
cals. Among 163 differentially regulated genes with diacetyl, 142 genes (~87%) were also differentially expressed 
with 2,3-pentanedione treatment (Fig. 2A). We ranked these 142 genes according to the p-values and then used 
qRT-PCR to validate the top 10 genes (PAPSS2, KRT4, CDC20B, DHRS9, MIR205HG, KRT13, PTGS2, PTHLH, 
SORCS2, and ALDH1A3) in ALI-cultured NHBE cells from three different donors (Table 3). As shown in Fig. 2B, 
the expression profiles of these top 10 genes in response to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione treatments were very 
similar in terms of the direction and magnitude of fold changes. Among the ten genes, PAPSS2, MIR205HG, 
and SORCS2 were significantly down-regulated by diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione treatment (Fig. 2B, p < 0.05).

CDC20B, PTGS2, and PTHLH were downregulated with diacetyl treatment (Fig. 2B, p < 0.05). DAVID analysis 
of the overlapping 142 genes in the two gene lists identified several significantly enriched pathways related to 
“Intermediate filament protein, conserved site”
, “Extracellular space”
, “Cilium”
, “Cell projection”
, and “Dynein” 
(Table 4), again reinforcing the notion that the two related flavoring chemicals may act on bronchial epithelium 
via common mechanisms. The full list of enriched terms is available in Supplementary Table S5.
Expression of genes involved in cilia processes. 
Although our DAVID analysis identified “Intermediate 
filament” as one of the most significantly enriched terms by exposure to both flavoring chemicals in NHBE cells 
(Table 4), expression of genes included in the term (KRT4, and KRT13, and KRT14) was not validated with our 
initial qPCR validation of top hits (Fig. 1D,E). Because the “Cilium” pathway has the lowest p-value in the com-
bined analysis (Table 4) and has been identified as a shared pathway in the individual analysis of the two datasets

(Tables 1 and 2), we focused our follow up characterization on the genes involved cilium biogenesis. Our RNA-seq 
data showed that expression of at least 11 genes related to cilium (TEKT1, CFAP70, PROM1, DNAH12, DNAI1, 
DNAH3, DNAAF1, CC2D2A, CFAP221, SPAG17, and DNAH6) was significantly down-regulated in NHBE cells 
treated with 25 ppm diacetyl or 100 ppm 2,3-pentanedione (Supplementary Table S6). Using qRT-PCR, we val-
idated the down-regulation of these genes in NHBE cells from three different donors upon either diacetyl or 
2,3-pentanedione treatment (Fig. 2C). Consistent with RNA seq data, mRNA expression of TEKT1, CFAP70, 
PROM1, DNAH12, DNAI1, DNAH3, DNAAF1, CC2D2A, and SPAG17 was significantly down-regulated with 
diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione (Fig. 2C, p < 0.05) (CFAP221 and DMAH6 were excluded because specific primers 
were not available), suggesting that the flavoring chemicals may impair cilia biogenesis and functions. We meas-
ured expression of DNAH3 and PROM1, two most down-regulated genes with flavoring chemicals (Fig. 1C), in

NHBE cells exposed to flavoring chemicals at lower levels. Their expression was down-regulated by treatment 
with diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione at levels as low as 2 and 10 ppm, respectively (Fig. 2D).
Effect of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione on cilia biogenesis. 
To further investigate the effect of fla-
voring chemicals on cilia biogenesis, we exposed ALI-cultured NHBE cells to diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione for 
48 h and performed β
-tubulin IV immunofluorescence staining for ciliated cells. The number of ciliated cells was 
normalized to the number of total cells in the field of view. Fig. 3A shows DAPI nuclei staining, β
-tubulin IV 
staining, and the merged images, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, the number of ciliated cells was signifi-
cantly decreased by diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione treatment, suggesting that both flavoring chemicals may target 
ciliated cells disrupting cilia biogenesis. To test whether flavoring chemicals affect other cell types in the epithe-
lium, we stained for MUC5AC, which is a marker for goblet cells, another major cell type in lung epithelium. 
Either diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione did not affect the number of goblet cells after 48-h exposure (Fig. 3C and D), 
suggesting that ciliated cells may be more susceptible to the effect of flavoring chemicals than goblet cells.
Discussion
The use of e-cig has outpaced the scientific studies examining the potential effects of e-cig and its chemical com-
ponents. Although chemicals such as diacetyl and its substitute 2,3-pentanedione are frequently used and found 
in commercial e-cig products to add flavor, little is known about how these flavoring chemicals may impair lung 
function, in particular that of the airway epithelium, which is the first line of defense in the lung and is the direct 
target of the chemicals. Here we show that both diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione induce significant transcriptomic 
changes, including those related to ciliogenesis, and decrease the number of ciliated cells, potentially impairing 
the cilia function of primary human airway epithelial cells. These data suggest that 2,3-pentanedione may not 
be a safe replacement of diacetyl, but may have similar characteristics to that of diacetyl, a flavoring compound 
associated with the development of “popcorn lung”23. Therefore, this study calls for strict assessment of potential 
toxicity of 2,3-pentanedione as well as diacetyl.
We identified that both diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione led to significant transcriptomic changes related to 
ciliogenesis in primary human airway epithelial cells, which may impair the cilia function. Ciliated cells are 
predominant within human airways constituting 50%–80% of airway epithelial lining and play an important

role in the mucociliary transport34–36. Cilia function can be modulated by ciliary beating, the length of the cilia, 
the ratio of ciliated to non-ciliated areas, the structure and orientation of cilia, mucus lining of the epithelium, 
and exposure to endogenous and exogenous factors37–48. Impaired cilia function has been associated with lung 
diseases such as COPD and asthma34,37,49–52. Our study has shown that exposure to flavoring chemicals leads to 
decreased number of ciliated cells with concomitant down-regulation of cilia-related genes in ALI culture system 
of NHBE cells in vitro, mimicking the in vivo airway characteristics with tight junctions and a differentiation 
state with ciliated, basal, and secretory cells30,53. This is consistent with rodent studies showing that diacetyl or 
2,3-pentanedione treatment resulted in airway epithelial injury characterized by flattening of cells, loss of micro-
villi and cilia, and fissure formation25,27,54. In addition, the proteomics study by Foster et al. (2017) reported down 
regulation of cilia-related proteins including DNAI1, that was also significantly down-regulated in our study, and 
a loss of ciliated cells in diacetyl-exposed human airway epithelial cells. Further research is needed to determine 
the structural-functional regulation of cilium by exposure to flavoring chemicals and how this might relate to the 
initiation or progression of lung diseases.
In addition to transcriptomic changes related to ciliogenesis, our ontological enrichment analysis reveals that 
diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione activate gene sets involved in cytoskeletal structure and function including kerat-
ins. Keratins are the typical intermediate filament proteins of epithelia and are important for the mechanical 
stability and integrity of epithelial cells and tissues. Moreover, some keratins also have regulatory functions and 
are involved in intracellular signaling pathways including apico-basal polarization, motility, cell size, protein 
synthesis and membrane traffic and signaling55,56. According to our RNA-Seq results, expression of KRT4, KRT13, 
KRT14, and KRT16 were upregulated with diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione treatment (Tables 1 and 2). Although the 
role of these keratins in lung diseases is not clear, further studies are necessary to evaluate their involvement on 
toxicity of flavoring chemicals in lung epithelium. Additionally, the interplay between cytoskeleton and ciliary 
function should be taken into consideration in future investigations because microtubule cytoskeletons of the 
cilium play critical roles in the regulation of cilium structure and function44,57–62.
Among the top 10 overlapping genes in the two flavoring chemicals, qPCR validated down-regulation of 
PAPSS2 (3′
phosphoadenosinse 5-phosphosulfate synthase 2), MIR205HG (MIR205 Host Gene), and SORCS2 
(Sortilin Related VPS10 Domain Containing Receptor 2), which do not belong to cilia or cytoskeleton pathways. 
As the first line of defense in the lung, bronchial epithelium metabolizes foreign compounds to facilitate the 
elimination of the foreign substance by a set of broad specificity enzymes capable of introducing new functional 
groups (Phase I reactions), or conjugating with charged molecules, to increase its water solubility (Phase II reac-
tions)63. PAPSS mediates the synthesis of PAPS that is the universal sulfate donor for Phase II sulfation reaction64. 
Downregulation of PAPSS may lead to deficit in available sulfate donors and interfere with sulfation reactions. 
Therefore, exposure to the flavoring compounds may impair detoxifications of xenobiotics in the lung epithelium 
increasing susceptibility to toxicant exposure in the lung. In addition, previous studies reported the potential 
involvement of PAPSS2 in lung carcinoma, showing that PAPSS2 was down-regulated in in squamous cell lung 
carcinoma compared to normal lung tissues65. Similarly, miR-205 expression was down-regulated in lung cancer 
cell lines whereas its overexpression promoted an epithelial phenotype and inhibited tumor cell migration and 
metastasis formation in lung cancer models66–68. Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms of SORCS2 have been 
associated with decreased survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients69. Although the present study implicates 
that exposure to flavoring chemical may impact airway epithelium through multiple mechanisms including the 
impaired cilia and cytoskeleton function and compromised detoxifications, further study is warranted on how 
these mechanisms alone or in combination may contribute to lung diseases such as bronchiolitis obliterans, lung 
cancer, COPD, and asthma.
Although this is the first whole transcriptomic profiling in NHBE cells exposed to flavoring chemicals, 
there are a few limitations. First, mechanisms through which flavoring chemicals impact ciliogenesis in lung 
airway epithelium are still unknown. It has been reported that α
-dicarbonyl compounds including diacetyl 
and 2,3-pentanedione are highly reactive to cause protein cross-links70. We suggest that protein cross-linking 
or modifications by these flavoring chemicals may lead to inactivation of protein activities and disruption of 
protein-protein interactions, ultimately resulting in the dysregulation of signal-transduction pathways such 
as ciliogenesis. Studies on the transcription factors including Forkhead box J1 (FOXJ1), which regulate cilia 
pathways71, will further elucidate the mechanisms of adverse impacts by flavoring chemicals in lung epithe-
lium. Second, the concentrations of flavoring chemicals in this study are much higher than the occupational 
limits for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione that are ranging from 5–10 ppb17. However, our study may be more 
relevant to acute exposure than chronic exposure because the popcorn workers had been exposed to diacetyl 
2–40 ppm (up to 100 ppm)72 and it is suggested that the peak diacetyl exposure is a greater hazard than the 
time-weighted-average diacetyl exposure27. Third, NHBE cells were exposed to aqueous solution of flavoring 
chemicals that may not reflect real human exposure to e-cig. Further study using vapor exposure system will 
be warranted to confirm the results from this study32,73. Additionally, measuring concentrations of these chem-
icals in the medium overtime would be helpful to assess the actual concentration of these volatile chemicals in 
the medium. Last, we focused our investigation on diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione because of our prior research 
from 2016 showing that these flavor chemicals are commonly found in e-cig17. However, it is possible that e-cig 
manufacturers have changed formulations since that time. This information can be difficult to confirm without 
constant lab testing because information on the exact flavoring formulation is not readily available in many cases. 
For example, one large e-cig producer lists on their website all of the ingredients in the products, but only uses 
the generic term ‘Flavors’ to describe the flavoring chemicals. Another lists ‘natural and artificial flavors’ on its 
package without listing specific ingredients. At least one large e-cig producer states on their website that they 
do not use diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione, but they do not disclose what chemicals they are using to flavor their 
products. This is a critical information gap considering that, in addition to diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, there

are additional 25 “High Priority” flavoring chemicals, according to a report on respiratory health concerns of 
flavoring chemicals produced by a flavoring chemical trade group74.
Conclusions
Our findings reveal that two flavoring chemicals commonly found in e-cig, diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione, induce 
similar transcriptional changes and affect biological pathways related to cellular morphology/integrity and cilium 
in NHBE cells. We further showed that exposure to diacetyl or 2,3-pentanedione down-regulated expression of 
cilia-related genes and decreased the number of ciliated cells. Because of the associations of diacetyl inhalation 
exposure and severe respiratory diseases and increasing popularity of e-cig use among people, further mecha-
nistic studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of diacetyl and related flavoring compounds in e-cig on airway 
epithelium.
Methods
Cell culture and exposure. 
Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial (NHBE) cells were gifted from Marsico 
Lung Institute/Cystic Fibrosis Center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (Chapel Hill, NC) and were 
cultured as previously described75. Cells at passage 2 were transferred to microporous polyester inserts (0.4 mm 
pore size, Transwell-Clear; Corning Costar, Corning, NY) and fed with a 1:1 mixture of BEBM and Dulbecco’s 
Modification of Eagle’s Media (DMEM; Mediatech,Herndon, VA) supplemented with the same components 
detailed above and as previously described. Media was applied apically and basally until the cells were confluent 
and then basally after an air–liquid interface (ALI) was established. Cells were cultured at ALI for 14 days to 
promote relatively stable expression of goblet and ciliated cells before exposure to e-cig chemicals or mixture. 
Diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione were diluted into culture medium, then mature, well-differentiated monolayers of 
cells were then exposed to control (medium), diacetyl (Sigma), or 2,3-pentanedione (Sigma) on the apical side for 
24 h (n = 3 subjects, each treatment was performed in duplicate). Total RNA samples for RNA-Seq were isolated 
using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen).
RNA-Seq Library Preparation and Sequencing. 
Polyadenylated mRNAs were selected from total 
RNA samples using oligo-dT-conjugated magnetic beads on an Apollo324 automated workstation (PrepX 
PolyA mRNA isolation kit, Takara Bio USA). Entire poly-adenylated RNA samples were immediately converted 
into stranded Illumina sequencing libraries using 200 bp fragmentation and sequential adapter addition on an 
Apollo324 automated workstation following manufacturer’s specifications (PrepX RNA-Seq for Illumina Library 
kit, Takara Bio USA). Libraries were enriched and indexed using 12 cycles of amplification (LongAmp Taq 2x 
MasterMix, New England BioLabs Inc.) with PCR primers which include a 6 bp index sequence to allow for 
multiplexing (custom oligo order from Integrated DNA Technologies). Excess PCR reagents were removed using 
magnetic bead-based cleanup on an Apollo324 automated workstation (PCR Clean DX beads, Aline Biosciences). 
Resulting libraries were assessed using a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies) and quantified by QPCR (Kapa 
Biosystems). Libraries were pooled and sequenced on one lane of a HiSeq2500 high output v3 flow cell using 
single end, 50 bp reads (Illumina).
RNA-Seq Data Analysis. 
Taffeta scripts (https://github.com/blancahimes/taffeta) were used to analyze the 
RNA-Seq data, which included trimming of adapters using trimmomatic (v.0.32)76 and using FastQC (v.0.11.2) 
to obtain overall QC metrics. Trimmed reads for each sample were aligned with STAR (v. 2.5.2b) to the refer-
ence homo sapiens build 38 UCSC file (hg38) genome obtained from the Illumina, Inc. iGenomes resource77. 
Additional QC parameters were obtained to assess whether reads were appropriately mapped. Bamtools 
(v.2.3.0)78 was used to count/summarize the number of mapped reads, including junction spanning reads. The 
Picard Tools (v.1.96; http://picard.sourceforge.net) RnaSeqMetrics function was used to compute the number of 
bases assigned to various classes of RNA, according to the hg38 refFlat file available as a UCSC Genome Table. For 
each sample, HTSeq (v.0.6.1) was used to quantify genes based on reads that mapped to the provided hg38 refer-
ence files79. The DESeq2R package (v. 1.12.4) was used to measure significance of differentially expressed genes 
between the exposed (N = 4) and control (N = 4) samples and create plots of the results80. The reported adjusted 
p-values are false-discovery rate corrected to 5% according to the procedure in DESeq2 that accounts for the 
large number of comparisons made. An adjusted p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. The NIH Database 
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to perform gene functional anno-
tation clustering using Homo Sapiens as background, and default options and annotation categories (Disease: 
OMIM_DISEASE; Functional Categories: COG_ONTOLOGY, SP_PIR_KEYWORDS, UP_SEQ_FEATURE; 
Gene_Ontology: GOTERM_BP_FAT, GOTERM_CC_FAT, GOTERM_MF_FAT; Pathway: BBID, BIOCARTA, 
KEGG_PATHWAY; Protein_Domains: INTERPRO, PIR_SUPERFAMILY, SMART)81.
qPT-PCR validation. 
RNA was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Biorad). The resulting 
cDNA was amplified using 2x SYBR mix (Qiagen) and 1 μ
M of each primer in a StepOne Plus Thermocycler 
(Applied Biosystems) in Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Melt curves 
were checked for single-length amplification products. Fold changes were calculated using the 2-Δ
Δ
Ct method82. 
GAPDH was the housekeeping gene used for normalization in all qPCR assays. All primers used in this study and 
their respective sources or design are listed in Supplementary Table S7.
Immunofluorescence staining. 
Immunofluorescence staining on ALI-cultured NHBE cells was per-
formed as described previously with some modifications83. First, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. 
Then, cells were blocked with PBS supplemented with 5% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room temper-
ature. Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4C in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.2% 
Triton X-100 using anti-β
-tubulin IV (Sigma) or anti-MUC5AC (Thermo) at 1:100 dilution. Secondary antibodies

conjugated with Alexa-fluor 488 (Life Technologies) were used at 1: 100 dilution. 4′
-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole, 
dihydrochloride was used to label the nuclear DNA and samples were mounted with Vectashield antifade mount-
ing medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif). Confocal images were taken using Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 or Leica 
STP8000 and processed using ImageJ.
statistical analysis. 
Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaStat 4.0 (San Jose, CA 95131, USA). Data 
were analyzed by either t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). If significant effects were detected, the 
ANOVA was followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc comparison of means. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically 
different. Data were expressed as means ± SEM.
