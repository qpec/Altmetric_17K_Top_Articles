Summary 
This review is intended to help clinicians, patients and the public make informed 
decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It 
explains how the evidence that is available from randomized controlled trials yields 
reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it 
discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to 
recognise the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment.  
Large-scale randomized trial evidence shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of 
heart attacks, ischaemic strokes and coronary revascularization procedures (“major 
vascular events”) by about one quarter for each mmol/L reduction in low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol during each year (after the first) that it continues to be 
taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual’s absolute risk 
of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is 
achieved. For example, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L (77 mg/dL) with an 
effective low-cost statin regimen (e.g. atorvastatin 40 mg daily, costing about £2 per 
month) for 5 years in 10,000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events 
from occurring in about 1000 patients (i.e. 10% absolute benefit) with pre-existing 
occlusive vascular disease (“secondary prevention”) and in 500 patients (i.e. 5% 
absolute benefit) who are at increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event 
(“primary prevention”). Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease 
risk during each year it continues to be taken, so larger absolute benefits would 
accrue with more prolonged therapy, and these benefits persist long-term.  
The only serious adverse events that have been shown by large-scale randomized 
trials to be caused by long-term statin therapy – that is, are adverse effects of the 
  
4 
 
statin – are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large 
increases in blood levels of creatine kinase), new onset diabetes mellitus and, 
probably, haemorrhagic stroke. Typically, treatment of 10,000 patients for 5 years 
with an effective regimen (e.g. atorvastatin 40 mg daily) would cause about 5 cases 
of myopathy (1 of which might progress, if the statin therapy is not stopped, to the 
more severe condition of rhabdomyolysis), 50-100 new cases of diabetes, and 5 
haemorrhagic strokes. However, any adverse impact of these side-effects on major 
vascular events has already been taken into account in the estimates of the absolute 
benefits. Statin therapy may cause symptomatic adverse events (e.g. muscle pain or 
weakness) in up to about 50-100 (i.e. 0.5-1.0%) patients per 10,000 treated for 5 
years. However, placebo-controlled randomized trials have shown definitively that 
almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in 
routine practice are not actually caused by it (that is, they represent mis-attribution). 
The available large-scale randomized trial evidence also indicates that it is unlikely 
that large absolute excesses in other serious adverse events still await discovery. 
Consequently, any further findings that emerge about the effects of statin therapy 
would not be expected to alter materially the balance of benefits and harms. It is, 
therefore, of concern that exaggerated claims about side-effect rates with statin 
therapy may be responsible for its under-use among individuals at increased risk of 
cardiovascular events. For, whereas the rare cases of myopathy and any muscle-
related symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy generally resolve rapidly when 
it is stopped, the heart attacks or strokes that may occur if statin therapy is stopped 
unnecessarily can be devastating.

Introduction 
Used appropriately, modern medical therapies have the potential to prevent a large 
proportion of the burden of cardiovascular disease. However, their appropriate use 
relies on the availability of robust data on safety and efficacy, as well as on a sound 
understanding of the interpretation and application of such evidence. 
Randomized controlled trials of adequate size are needed to be confident that any 
moderate benefits and any moderate harms of a treatment have been assessed 
sufficiently reliably.1,2 In certain circumstances, available evidence from randomized 
trials about the effects of a treatment may be limited (perhaps because it is deemed 
not possible or too difficult to do them).2 However, the particular context that this 
paper addresses is the appropriate interpretation of evidence about the safety and 
efficacy of a treatment when large randomized trials of it have been conducted in 
many different types of patient (as is the case for statin therapy), as well as the 
additional value of information from observational studies based on cohorts, health 
care databases or other sources.3-5 Not only have the limitations of observational 
studies4,6-9 often been under-estimated when attributing adverse effects to treatment 
(such as misleading claims that statins cause side-effects in one-fifth of patients10-12), 
but so too have the strengths of randomized trials with blinded treatment allocation 
and systematic ascertainment of many different types of adverse event been under-
estimated for the reliable assessment of the safety and efficacy of treatment.3,9,13-15  
This paper first considers the generic strengths and limitations of randomized trials 
and observational studies for assessing the effects of treatment, and then considers 
the specific evidence that is available on the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. It 
concludes by considering the public health implications of the failure to recognise the 
  
6 
 
full benefits of using statin therapy and of the exaggerated claims that have been 
made about the rates of side-effects.  
Randomized controlled trials: strengths and weaknesses for assessing the 
benefits and harms of treatment 
Insert Panel 1 
Like-with-like comparisons within randomized trials 
The key strength of randomized controlled trials is that the process of randomization 
results in groups of patients who differ from each other only by the play of chance 
with respect to their risks of suffering all types of health outcome (i.e. the randomized 
treatment groups are balanced with respect to both known and unknown risk factors, 
irrespective of whether or not these have been assessed).3,7,9,14-16 In addition, 
blinding assignment of study treatment with a placebo minimises the differential 
assessment of adverse events between the study treatment groups following 
randomization.17,18 Continued follow-up of all randomized patients (even if some stop 
taking their assigned treatment) maintains the “like-with-like” comparison produced 
by the randomization process (since, for example, the patients who stop may differ 
between the randomized groups).3,7,9,14-16 Consequently, subject to statistical tests of 
the likely impact of chance, the observed differences in the rates of health outcomes 
between the randomly assigned patient groups within a trial (i.e. “intention-to-treat” 
comparisons) can be attributed causally to differences in the study treatment.  
Information about a health outcome does not need to be obtained in the same way in 
the different randomized trials of an intervention (e.g. different statin trials recorded 
muscle-related outcomes differently: see webtable) for the comparisons of the rates 
of the outcome between the randomly allocated groups within each separate trial to 
  
7 
 
provide unbiased assessments of any real effects of the treatment. However, biases 
can be introduced by making non-randomized comparisons between rates of events 
across different trials, not only because the outcome definitions may differ but also 
because the types of patient studied and the duration of follow-up may differ. Such 
between-trial comparisons may be seriously misleading,19 which is the reason why 
meta-analysis of randomized trials involve statistical methods that are based on the 
within-trial differences in a particular outcome.20,21  
Robustness for detecting real treatment effects 
It has been suggested that ascertainment of adverse events in randomized trials 
may not be sufficiently specific or sensitive to detect adverse effects of treatment 
reliably.11,12,22-24 However, comparisons within randomized trials with unbiased 
ascertainment of outcomes between the treatment groups are robust against both 
over- and under-ascertainment.25 For example, if the study treatment produced a 
20% proportional decrease (or increase) in the rate of an outcome that occurred in 
10% of control patients, then (as shown in Table 1) the ability to detect such an 
effect in a randomized trial of 20,000 patients would not be much altered by the 
random addition of reported events that were not actually the outcome of interest 
(i.e. “false positives”) in 10-20% of patients. Likewise, similar amounts of under-
ascertainment (i.e. “false negatives”), would not materially affect the ability to detect 
such effects in a trial. Moreover, these false positives would have little or no impact 
on estimates of the absolute effects, and the false negatives would have limited 
impact. The robustness of these within-trial randomized comparisons applies not 
only to the detection of beneficial effects, but also to the detection of harms that a 
treatment might cause (such as any muscle-related symptoms with statin therapy).  
  
8 
 
It has been suggested that, when data for some types of health outcome are not 
available from all of the relevant randomized trials of a treatment, this will bias the 
assessment of its effects.11,26,27 However, while some of these trials may have 
recorded all types of health outcome reported by the participating patients, others 
may have only recorded those outcomes that were considered “serious” (typically 
defined as resulting in hospitalisation or death), perhaps because previous trials had 
ruled out material differences in less serious outcomes. If information on a particular 
outcome is not available from a randomized trial because it was not recorded that 
would not bias assessment of the effects of the treatment based on trials that did 
record the outcome. Also, if randomized trials have already reported results based 
on large numbers of occurrences of a particular outcome then the inclusion of any 
unpublished data from other trials that did record such outcomes is not likely to 
materially alter the assessment of the effect of the treatment on that outcome. 
“Intention-to-treat” analyses based on comparisons between all randomized patients, 
irrespective of whether they are adherent to their assigned study treatment (i.e. stop 
taking the active drug or, if assigned to the control group, start taking it), will tend to 
underestimate the effects produced by actually taking the treatment. However, rather 
than using potentially biased “on treatment” comparisons among only those patients 
who took their assigned study treatment, more appropriate allowance can be made 
by applying an approximate estimate of the level of adherence to the estimate of the 
treatment effect provided by the intention-to-treat comparison.28 For example, if the 
average adherence to treatment assignment is two-thirds and the observed relative 
risk reduction (or increase) is 20%, then the adjusted estimate of the effect of actual 
use of the treatment would be a 30% proportional reduction (or increase). 
  
9 
 
Specificity versus sensitivity of composite outcomes 
When there is clear evidence that a treatment produces effects on the incidence of 
different types of outcome that are in the same direction and of similar magnitude 
(for example, the reductions in coronary events, ischaemic strokes and coronary 
revascularisations produced by statin therapy29-33), combination of these outcomes in 
a composite outcome (such as “major vascular events” in the statin trials) may well 
provide more robust assessments of the effects of the treatment because they 
involve larger numbers of events than for any of the constituent outcomes. That does 
not necessarily mean that – when deciding whether the absolute benefits of the 
treatment outweigh the harms for any particular type of patient (e.g. offering statin 
therapy to individuals at lower versus higher risk of cardiovascular events) – equal 
weight should be given to the different components of such composite outcomes. 
Instead, such analyses of composite outcomes may allow more reliable evidence to 
emerge about the effects of the treatment in different circumstances (for example, 
the similar proportional reductions in major vascular events that have been found 
with statin therapy among many different types of patient: Figure 129-33). 
However, when a treatment has effects on different outcomes that differ in direction, 
then their combination in a composite outcome will reduce the ability to detect these 
outcome-specific effects and limit generalizability of the analyses.34-37  For example, 
if a treatment reduces the incidence of ischaemic strokes but increases the incidence 
of haemorrhagic strokes (as appears to be the case for statin therapy31,38) then the 
adverse effect on haemorrhagic strokes may be missed by an assessment based on 
the composite of all stroke types since ischaemic strokes occur more commonly in 
most circumstances. By contrast, the assessment of the effects of the treatment on 
ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes considered separately would not only be more 
  
10 
 
sensitive to any benefits and harms, but it would also yield findings that are more 
readily generalized to different settings.39  
Equally, if treatment produced similar proportional reductions in vascular mortality 
and increases in non-vascular mortality, then the effect on the composite outcome of 
all-cause mortality would depend on the ratio of vascular to non-vascular deaths in a 
particular setting: the treatment would appear to be beneficial when vascular deaths 
predominated, but harmful when non-vascular deaths predominated. Instead, the 
application of the proportional reductions and increases in the separate causes of 
death (or other relevant outcomes) to the expected rates of these outcomes in the 
population of interest would yield estimates of the absolute effects of treatment on 
each type of death and, hence, of the net effect on survival for particular types of 
individual (as is discussed later in the context of statin therapy).4,40 
The lack of sensitivity and generalizability of composite outcomes can be even more 
problematic when they involve very disparate outcomes. It has been suggested that 
the assessment of statin therapy should be based on the composite outcome of all 
serious adverse events of any kind (e.g. mixing vascular outcomes that are known to 
be prevented by statin therapy with outcomes in gastro-intestinal, genito-urinary, 
neuropsychiatric, and other systems that may not be affected).11 A key problem with 
such an approach is that it can prevent the identification of both specific benefits and 
specific hazards of treatment. For example, analyses of specific outcomes among 
the 25,673 randomized patients in the THRIVE trial were able to detect unexpected 
hazards of niacin therapy (i.e. increases in serious infections and bleeding)41 that 
would have been missed by analyses based on the composite of all serious adverse 
events (as in the original report of the AIM-HIGH trial of niacin42). Consideration of 
  
11 
 
the effects of treatment on specific outcomes allows any differences in its effects to 
be determined, and its use can then be appropriately targeted at those who are likely 
to get more benefit than harm.  
Value of meta-analyses of randomized trials 
Meta-analyses of randomized trials may be required when the effects of a treatment 
on some particular outcome are likely to be moderate and too few cases of it have 
occurred in any individual trial to assess the effects sufficiently reliably.3,20,43-46 For 
example, Table 2 shows that a meta-analysis of 100,000 randomized patients (as is 
available for statin therapy33) would have 90% statistical power at p=0.01 to detect a 
an absolute excess of 0.5% in the incidence of events that have a control rate of 5% 
(i.e. a 10% proportional increase) and an absolute excess of 1% for events that have 
a 20% control rate (i.e. a 5% proportional increase). Meta-analysis can also reduce 
the impact of selective emphasis on effects observed in particular trials that may 
over-estimate the real effects 20,45 (e.g. the excess of diabetes cases with statin 
therapy first noticed in the JUPITER trial47 was found to be smaller in the other statin 
trials48) or may not even be real (e.g. the small excesses of incident cancer cases in 
the CARE and PROSPER trials49,50 were not confirmed by the much larger numbers 
of cases in the other statin trials51,52).  
However, meta-analyses of randomized trials are not typically required to detect 
large effects of a treatment on common outcomes. Instead, individual trials will 
suffice if they have recorded large enough numbers of cases of the outcome of 
interest: for example, a trial of 2,500 patients allocated to active treatment versus 
2,500 allocated matched placebo would have at least a 90% chance at p=0.01 of 
detecting a 20% versus 15% event rate difference if it existed; and a trial of 20,000 
  
12 
 
patients would have similar statistical power to detect (or refute) reliably an absolute 
difference as small as about 2% (i.e. 20% vs 18%: Table 2). In such circumstances, 
it may be more informative to consider the separate within-trial comparisons in each 
of the relevant randomized trials in order to determine whether (when considered in 
the context of the other trials) any of them do provide compelling evidence that there 
are any relevant effects on any specific outcomes (for example, see the webtable of 
muscle-related outcomes reported in the large randomized placebo-controlled trials 
of prolonged exposure to statin therapy). 
In addition, an individual trial that has been specifically designed to assess the 
effects of a treatment on some particular outcome especially carefully (for example, 
serial assessments of cognitive function53-55 and of lens opacities56-58 in statin trials) 
may be more sensitive to any real effects of treatment than would be a meta-analysis 
based on the less specific assessment of the outcome in all of the other randomized 
trials – or, to an even greater extent, on non-randomized comparisons involving data 
recorded for entirely different purposes in observational studies (see below).  
Generalizability of evidence on efficacy from randomized trials 
It has been suggested that, because of the exclusion criteria in randomized trials, 
results from observational studies based on use of a treatment in routine practice 
(sometimes referred to, misleadingly, as “real world” evidence10,22,24,59) are more 
widely generalizable about its effects.11,22,24,60,61 However, meta-analyses of 
randomized trials with different eligibility criteria that have included large numbers of 
different types of patient (e.g. although some statin trials excluded people who were 
older or who had particular conditions, other statin trials did not) may be able to 
address this putative limitation by yielding unbiased information based on sufficient 
  
13 
 
numbers of individuals with different characteristics that can then be widely 
generalized (for example, with the statin trials,31-33,62 older and younger people, 
women and men, individuals with and without pre-existing vascular disease or other 
conditions).36,63 Such analyses would not, of course, provide direct evidence among 
those types of patient who were excluded largely or wholly from randomized trials 
because the treatment was considered to be contraindicated. However, if the 
treatment is not used routinely in such patients, neither would observational studies 
provide such evidence – and, in most cases, the effects in such circumstances would 
be of limited clinical relevance.  
The risk ratio for a particular outcome in a randomized controlled trial is the ratio of 
the proportion of the treated and control patients who develop the specific outcome. 
As a result, only those individuals who have the outcome contribute information on 
the risk ratio. Moreover, inclusion of individuals who will not have the outcome (such 
as most of those in a primary prevention population) would not change the effect of 
treatment in individuals who will have it.36,64 In general, therefore, any proportional 
reductions or increases in the rate of a specific outcome should be expected to be 
similar in different circumstances. Consequently, when a treatment has been shown 
unequivocally to affect the rate of a particular outcome, definite evidence of an effect  
in each separate type of person is not generally required. Instead, it may be more 
appropriate to conclude that the treatment produces similar proportional effects on 
that outcome among different patient types (as has been found generally with statin 
therapy31-33,62), unless compelling evidence emerges that the effect in a particular 
group of patients differs from the overall risk ratio.3,65-69  
  
14 
 
This feature of similar proportional effects of treatment on specific outcomes is useful 
for generalizing results from randomized trials. It is, of course, the absolute – not the 
proportional – effects on outcome that matter for an individual when considering the 
use of a treatment. However, application of the proportional effects of a treatment on 
specific outcomes from randomized trials to the absolute rates of these outcomes 
derived from observational studies in some particular population of interest (e.g. for 
secondary prevention in patients at high-risk of recurrent vascular events versus 
primary prevention in lower-risk individuals in the general population) can yield 
generalizable estimates of both the absolute benefits and the absolute harms of a 
treatment.4,40 Combination of these separate estimates then allows the net effect of 
using the treatment to be estimated for particular types of individual.  
Generalizability of evidence on side-effects from randomized trials 
It has been suggested that randomized trials yield under-estimates of side-effect 
rates because they exclude patients in whom the treatment being studied is known 
to cause adverse effects (e.g. so-called “statin-intolerant” patients).11,12,22-24,61,70-73 
However, for treatments that are not yet on the market or that have not yet been 
widely adopted into routine practice (as was the case during the recruitment phase of 
many of the large clinical outcome trials of statins62,74), few patients will have 
previously been exposed to the treatment and excluded because of having had 
problems with it.  
Some trials use a pre-randomization “run-in” phase to improve the subsequent 
adherence to the randomly assigned treatment (whether active drug or placebo). 
Run-in phases involving the use of a placebo (as in about half of the large trials of 
statin versus control: see webtable) would not lead to under-estimates of the rates of 
  
15 
 
side-effects. Indeed, by improving post-randomization adherence, the sensitivity of 
randomized comparisons to detect any effects of treatment would be expected to be 
improved.75 Less commonly, trials have used run-in phases with the active drug (as 
in a few of the large statin trials: see webtable), which may exclude some patients in 
whom the treatment would cause adverse effects soon after starting it (although, in 
one of the large statin trials, no differences in reasons for stopping treatment were 
observed between placebo and active phases of run-in76). However, it is less likely 
that use of an active run-in would prevent the emergence of genuine side-effects 
during the later years of such trials. For example, it was the SEARCH randomized 
trial with an active run-in phase that identified a substantial increase in the risk of 
myopathy with simvastatin 80mg daily (a regimen recommended for routine care77) 
compared to simvastatin 20 mg daily (see webtable).78 
For all of these reasons, evidence about side-effects from randomized trials is likely 
to be far more widely generalizable to routine practice than is often asserted.79-81  
Observational studies: limited additional value for assessing the effects of 
treatment when large-scale randomized controlled evidence exists 
Observational epidemiologic studies have been extremely valuable for identifying 
associations of risk factors with disease (for example, smoking with lung cancer; 
blood pressure and cholesterol with cardiovascular disease), but their value for the 
assessment of the effects of treatment is more limited.  
Insert Panel 2 
Potential to detect large effects on rare outcomes 
  
16 
 
Case reports to regulatory authorities or studies based on health care databases 
often involve the exposure of large numbers of individuals to a treatment that is 
being used in routine practice. Consequently, they do have the potential to detect 
large adverse effects on health outcomes that would not normally be expected to 
occur (e.g. Reye’s syndrome with aspirin use in children; tendon disorders with 
fluoroquinolones; myopathy with statin therapy).1,2,4,82 Such studies are also able to 
detect large beneficial effects of a treatment when a good outcome would otherwise 
not be expected (e.g. insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis; penicillin for lobar pneumonia; 
ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus retinitis).2,82 However, due to the potential biases that 
are inherent in observational studies, they cannot be relied on for demonstrating the 
causal nature of treatment-related associations when the relative risks are both not 
large (e.g. less than 3- to 4-fold7,82,83) and do not relate to health outcomes that are 
rare in the types of patient studied.4,6,7,9,83-85  
This limitation is not confined to the assessment of beneficial treatment effects, but 
applies equally to the detection of harmful effects. For, although unintended adverse 
effects may be more plausible than are any unintended beneficial effects,86 the 
potential impact of the biases in observational studies is similar irrespective of the 
direction of the associations. Consequently, when large-scale randomized controlled 
evidence does exist (as it does for statin therapy), the additional value of information 
from non-randomized observational studies about treatment effects is very limited. 
Potential to assess prolonged exposure to treatment 
An oft-cited advantage of observational studies is that they may involve prolonged 
exposure to the treatment of interest. However, adequate data about the use of a 
treatment in health care databases may not involve a duration of exposure that is 
  
17 
 
longer than in randomized trials. For example, in several prominently reported health 
care database studies of statin therapy, the average treatment exposure ranged 
between 2 and 5 years87-90 (compared with about 4 to 5 years in the randomized 
trials designed to assess clinical efficacy and safety33). Moreover, information about 
the duration and dose of the treatment may be importantly incomplete in databases 
(e.g. based on limited prescription data without information about actual use) that 
have not been compiled specifically for the purpose of assessing the effects of that 
specific treatment (e.g. primary care or hospital data that are being used for patient 
care or administrative purposes).91-95  
In addition, whereas randomized trials assess the effects of a specific exposure (i.e. 
a particular dose of a particular drug with information about adherence) on outcomes 
that are sought systematically, observational studies often only assess more general 
associations (e.g. prescription of many different doses of a drug, or a class of drug, 
on ill-defined outcomes) which may prevent the detection of effects that are specific 
(e.g. the higher rate of myopathy with simvastatin 80 mg daily than with 20-40 mg 
daily78). Combination of precise information about the treatment that is received 
during a specific period in a randomized trial and prolonged follow-up of outcomes 
after the trial has ended (perhaps through linkage to electronic health records96) may 
also allow the reliable assessment of the later effects of the treatment (as has been 
done for statin therapy97-104) while still avoiding the potential biases that are inherent 
in observational studies. 
Biases due to differences in underlying risks of health outcomes 
The magnitude of the potential biases inherent in observational studies of treatment 
is often under-estimated in the interpretation of associations that are found with 
  
18 
 
health outcomes.4,6,7,9,16,84 Confounding by indication, or contraindication, occurs 
when the treatment being considered tends to be provided more, or less, frequently 
to individuals with medical conditions or other characteristics that are associated with 
increased, or decreased, risks of various health outcomes (which is, of course, what 
would be expected to occur in clinical practice105). Bias may also be introduced by 
other differences in the underlying risks of developing health outcomes among the 
individuals who have received a particular treatment and the individuals with whom 
they are compared who have not received that treatment. Even when associations 
between the treatment and health outcomes remain after statistical adjustment for 
observed differences between these different groups of individuals, the adjusted 
associations may still reflect residual confounding due to differences in factors that 
were assessed incompletely or not at all (and so would not necessarily have been 
taken fully into account in adjusted analyses) or due to other inadequacies in the 
approach to adjustment (e.g. using the wrong statistical model).6,7,93,106-108 
Consequently, relying on evidence from observational studies about the effects of 
treatment on common outcomes – rather than considering it to be “hypothesis-
generating” – may well have adverse consequences for patients and public health. 
For example, in observational studies, the use of hormone replacement therapy by 
post-menopausal women was associated with about 50% less coronary disease than 
among those who did not use it.109-111 This apparent protective effect was considered 
by many to be biologically plausible because of the marked differences in coronary 
heart disease rates between men and women before the menopause, as well as the 
known effects of oestrogens on lipid profiles.111-113 As a result, hormone replacement 
therapy was widely prescribed to prevent coronary disease (even though it was not 
  
19 
 
licensed for that purpose),114 becoming one of the most commonly used medications 
in industrialized countries. 
However, despite the widespread belief that this association was causal, large 
randomized trials of hormone replacement therapy were conducted which showed 
that it did not protect against coronary heart disease.115-118 A range of retrospective 
“explanations” were proposed for this apparent discrepancy with the results in the 
observational studies (e.g. that the wrong type of adjustment had been used or the 
timing of initiating treatment mattered),119,120 but these were eventually refuted.121,122 
Likewise, randomized trials have not confirmed the 30% increased risk of breast 
cancer found in observational studies of estrogen-alone preparations, although the 
results for combined estrogen-progestin preparations appear similar.123-125 Despite 
these discrepancies, the similarity of the direction – but not the size126,127 – of the 
differences in the rates of stroke and pulmonary embolism in observational studies 
and in randomized trials of hormone replacement therapy has been used to justify 
continued reliance on observational evidence,2 rather than as an illustration of the 
difficulty of determining which – if any – associations with treatment in observational 
studies provide a reliable basis for safe and effective care of patients and the public.  
A number of reviews have been conducted to compare the estimates of treatment 
effects from observational studies and randomized trials, but their methods have 
been criticized (chiefly because of concerns about the methods used to select the 
studies and compare the results) and their findings have been inconsistent.106 It has 
been concluded that these reviews identified many examples where the results of 
the same intervention were on average the same, but also many examples where 
the results differed. For example, there have been many claims about the benefits of 
  
20 
 
various vitamin supplements based on observational studies128,129 that have been 
reliably refuted by large-scale randomized trials.130-132 Similarly, when compared with 
the results from randomized trials of the effects of treatments for several different 
cancers, observational studies have generated improbable results despite controlling 
for comorbidity, extent of disease and many other characteristics that were recorded 
in detailed databases133-135 (as is also the case for reported associations of statins 
with lower rates of cancer90,136-138). These findings are consistent with empirical 
studies in which biases in observational studies were shown to be large enough to 
conclude falsely that treatment produced benefit or harm, with none of a range of 
statistical strategies (such as regression analysis or propensity matching) capable of 
adjusting adequately or predictably for bias.93,106-108  
Biases due to differences in the ascertainment of health outcomes 
Observational studies of treatment effects are often based on health outcome data 
that have been recorded without consistent coding or validation.92-95 Moreover, by 
contrast with the situation in randomized controlled trials with blinded treatment 
assignment (i.e. when patients and their doctors do not know whether they are taking 
the active treatment or a matching placebo), patients being treated in routine practice 
know that they are taking a particular drug, as do their doctors. Indeed, the patients 
may have been specifically told that the treatment has potential side-effects139,140 
(e.g. patients given statin therapy are typically advised that serious muscle problems 
can occur, albeit rarely, and to advise their doctors if they develop muscle pain or 
weakness141-144), and they may be more closely monitored by their doctors. Such 
biases may be exacerbated by concomitant changes in lifestyle recommended by 
the patients’ doctors (for example, the “prescription” of physical activity as well as 
statin therapy may lead to exercise-induced muscle pain being attributed to the 
  
21 
 
drug). Consequently, assessment of the effects of a treatment in observational 
studies may be biased by differences in the reporting and detection of health 
outcomes between the patients who are taking it and those who are not.139,145,146 
However, despite it having been shown that randomized controlled trials without 
blinded treatment assignment can produce misleading estimates of treatment effects 
(particularly for subjective outcomes),17,18,146 the inability to make allowances for 
such ascertainment biases is rarely acknowledged adequately in the interpretation of 
observational studies147,148 (including for statin therapy87,89,149,150). The magnitude of 
these biases can be large:140,151 for example, in a blinded randomized trial among 
patients considered to be “statin-intolerant” due to a history of muscle pain on statin 
therapy, myalgia was reported by about 25% of patients irrespective of whether they 
were taking atorvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo for 24 weeks, but the rates fell below 
5% immediately after stopping either the active or placebo tablets.152,153 These 
results indicate the extent to which mis-attribution of adverse events can bias 
assessments of treatment in observational studies which, necessarily, do not involve 
blinded ascertainment of outcomes.  
Potential benefits and harms of lowering LDL cholesterol concentrations 
Associations between LDL cholesterol and vascular disease 
By contrast with observational studies of treatment, observational epidemiologic 
studies are valuable for the assessment of causal risk factors. In particular, such 
studies have shown that there is a continuous positive association between blood 
concentrations of LDL cholesterol and the rates of coronary heart disease events in 
different populations, without any suggestion within the range that has been studied 
of a “threshold” below which a lower concentration is not associated with a lower 
  
22 
 
risk.154,155 The absolute difference in coronary disease risk associated with a given 
absolute difference in LDL cholesterol is greater at higher concentrations (Figure 2a), 
which helps to explain the emphasis in previous treatment guidelines on individuals 
with “hypercholesterolaemia”. However, if risk is plotted on a logarithmic scale then 
the proportional difference in risk associated with a given absolute difference in LDL 
cholesterol concentration is similar throughout the range (Figure 2b). 
Consequently, with a treatment that acts through LDL-lowering, the proportional 
reduction in cardiovascular disease risk per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol 
should be expected to be similar irrespective of the starting cholesterol levels (rather 
than, as has been suggested for statin therapy,10 being evidence that the effects are 
not related to cholesterol lowering). Moreover, the absolute reduction in vascular risk 
per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol would also be expected to be similar for 
individuals who are at comparable levels of risk but present with different cholesterol 
concentrations. The results of randomized controlled trials of statin therapy support 
these epidemiological expectations (see below),31-33,156,157 and treatment guidelines 
now tend to focus on an individual’s risk of having atherosclerosis-related events as 
well as on their LDL cholesterol level.158,159 
Lower concentrations of cholesterol have been associated in observational studies 
with higher rates of all-cause mortality, particularly in older people.160-162 However, 
such associations can be shown not to be causal. For example, using the Mendelian 
randomization approach, lower genetically-determined LDL cholesterol levels are 
associated with lower all-cause mortality even among individuals aged over 90.163 It 
appears that pre-existing disease causes lower cholesterol concentrations (so-called 
  
23 
 
“reverse causality”); spurious associations can be largely avoided in analyses of 
observational epidemiologic studies by censoring the first few years of follow-up.164   
Causal relationship between LDL cholesterol and vascular disease 
Observational studies can provide evidence about associations of risk factors with 
health outcomes, but they do not necessarily suffice to confirm the causal nature of 
such associations. In the case of LDL cholesterol, a number of additional sources of 
evidence have helped to show that the continuous association with atherosclerotic 
disease is causal. These include experimental studies of atherosclerosis in animals, 
monogenetic and polygenic associations in humans, and randomized trials of LDL-
lowering therapy (which also assess the extent of risk reversibility and its timescale).  
Experimental studies in animals have shown that diets that raise LDL cholesterol 
concentrations increase the extent of atherosclerosis in the arterial wall, and that 
lowering LDL cholesterol concentrations with either diet or drugs (including statins) 
can reduce atherosclerosis.165,166 Genetic disorders in humans that cause large 
elevations of LDL cholesterol concentrations (in particular, LDL receptor mutations) 
are associated with substantially elevated rates of atherosclerotic disease.167,168 
Moreover, these disorders (i.e. familial hypercholesterolaemia) provide compelling 
evidence of “dose” effects, whereby individuals in Western populations who inherit 
the abnormal genetic variant from both parents typically have LDL cholesterol levels 
above 12 mmol/L and coronary events before the age of 20 years,167 while those 
who inherit the abnormal variant from one parent typically have levels above 8 
mmol/L and events in early middle-age.168 In addition, a number of common genetic 
variants have been identified that cause much smaller increases in LDL cholesterol 
  
24 
 
levels and these are associated with correspondingly smaller increases in the risk of 
coronary events, providing further evidence in support of a causal association.169  
Proven beneficial effects of lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy 
In the pre-statin era, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of cholesterol-
lowering diets, drugs and ileal bypass surgery did show that, within a few years of 
reducing blood cholesterol concentrations, rates of non-fatal myocardial infarction 
and coronary death are reduced.170 In addition, the randomized trials that involved 
larger and more prolonged cholesterol reductions yielded larger reductions in the 
rates of coronary events. However, it was suggested that these beneficial effects 
might be offset by excesses in non-coronary deaths and cancers, which generated 
uncertainty about the overall benefits of lowering cholesterol.171-173 The development 
of the statins, which can lower LDL cholesterol to a greater extent than any of the 
previously available treatments, provided an opportunity to obtain clear evidence 
about the beneficial effects of LDL-lowering on atherosclerotic events and deaths, as 
well as to determine whether it produces adverse effects on other causes of major 
morbidity and mortality.174 For, although it may not always be possible to distinguish 
between adverse effects caused by lowering LDL cholesterol and those due to off-
target effects of statins (such as myopathy), reliable evidence of a lack of adverse 
effects should be generalizable about the safety of lowering LDL cholesterol. 
Effects of statin therapy on LDL cholesterol concentrations 
During the past 20 years, the increasingly widespread use of statin therapy among 
individuals who are known to have occlusive vascular disease or are considered to 
be at increased risk of cardiovascular events for other reasons (e.g. having high 
cholesterol concentrations or other risk factors, such as older age, hypertension or 
  
25 
 
diabetes) has been associated with downward shifts in the distributions of LDL and 
total cholesterol concentrations in many populations.175,176 In addition, due to the 
tendency for statin therapy to be prescribed more commonly to individuals with 
elevated LDL cholesterol concentrations, the proportions with high levels have been 
preferentially reduced.175,176 Representative data from population-based studies 
conducted before evidence of beneficial effects of statin therapy on fatal and non-
fatal vascular events emerged from large randomized trials indicate that average 
LDL cholesterol concentrations in Western populations among people in middle and 
old age are about 4 mmol/L (or more) in the absence of statin therapy.177,178  
The proportional reductions in LDL cholesterol achieved with statin therapy are not 
materially affected by the starting LDL cholesterol concentration or by other patient 
characteristics (such as age, sex, vascular risk, genetic markers).30-33,179 Different 
statins have different potency on a “mmol/L-per-mg” basis, with the newer agents 
(e.g. atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) able to produce larger LDL-reductions than the 
older agents (e.g. simvastatin and pravastatin: Table 3).159 Irrespective of the statin 
used, each doubling of the dose produces an extra reduction of about 6 percentage 
points in LDL cholesterol (e.g. 43% versus 49% reductions with atorvastatin 20 mg 
versus 40 mg daily). The ACC/AHA 2013 Blood Cholesterol Guideline classified 
statin regimens as being “low-intensity” (e.g. <30% LDL-reduction with simvastatin 
10 mg daily), “moderate-intensity” (e.g. 30% to <50% reduction with simvastatin 20-
40 mg, atorvastatin 10-20 mg, or rosuvastatin 5-10 mg daily) and “high-intensity” 
(e.g. ≥50% reduction with atorvastatin 40-80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg daily).158 
Use of high-intensity statin therapy would be expected to reduce LDL cholesterol by 
at least 2 mmol/L in individuals who present with concentrations of 4 mmol/L or more 
(i.e. about half of the population in the absence of statin therapy177,178), but by only 
  
26 
 
about 1 mmol/L in those with concentrations of 2 mmol/L. Consequently, since the 
proportional reductions in vascular event rates with statin therapy are related to the 
absolute reductions in LDL cholesterol that are achieved (see below), intensive statin 
therapy should be focused on patients at higher risk of vascular events rather than 
just those with high cholesterol concentrations.158,159,180  
The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ (CTT) collaboration was established to conduct 
meta-analyses of individual patient data from all of the randomized controlled trials of 
statin therapy that were scheduled to involve at least 2 years of treatment in at least 
1,000 patients.181 Pre-specification of the inclusion of a defined set of large trials and 
of the approach to their analysis before the results of any of the trials were available 
was intended to avoid selection bias. During the scheduled study treatment periods 
(which were typically about 5 years), the average reduction in LDL cholesterol was 
about 1.0 mmol/L in the trials that compared the effects of allocating routine statin 
therapy versus no routine statin therapy, and it was further reduced by about 0.5 
mmol/L in the trials that compared allocation to more versus less intensive statin 
regimens.31 That is, based on combination of the “intention-to-treat” analyses of 
these two sets of trials, allocation to an intensive statin regimen versus no routine 
statin therapy reduced LDL cholesterol concentrations by 1.5 mmol/L. However, 
such comparisons under-estimate the LDL-reductions that can be achieved by 
actually taking a particular regimen, since some of the patients did not take their 
assigned statin therapy or more intensive statin therapy throughout the scheduled 
study treatment period, whereas some of the patients in the control groups started to 
take a statin or a more intensive regimen.29 Instead, based on the LDL-reductions 
that can be achieved (Table 3), the use of more intensive statin therapy would have 
been expected to reduce LDL cholesterol by about 2 mmol/L in such patients.

Reductions in rates of major vascular events 
The pre-specified purpose of the CTT meta-analyses was to assess the effects of 
lowering LDL cholesterol on atherosclerotic events in different types of patient more 
reliably than would be possible in any of the separate randomized trials and (given 
previous concerns about cholesterol-lowering therapy) to determine whether there 
were adverse effects on non-vascular causes of death and site-specific cancers.181 
Consequently, data were sought for each of the eligible trials about the baseline 
characteristics of each patient and about myocardial infarctions, strokes, coronary 
revascularizations, cancers and causes of death that occurred during the scheduled 
treatment period (but not any other adverse events, which is the subject of an on-
going project182). Follow-up of outcomes in the trials was reported to be about 99% 
complete. It was pre-specified that results of the meta-analyses would be presented 
as risk reductions per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol.29,181 
In total in the CTT meta-analyses, there were about 25,000 “major vascular events” 
(defined as the composite of coronary deaths or non-fatal myocardial infarctions, 
strokes of any type, and coronary revascularisation procedures) during an average 
of about 5 years of scheduled study treatment. The proportional reductions in these 
major vascular event rates were related to the absolute reductions in LDL cholesterol 
that were achieved (Figure 3). Overall, in the trials of routine statin therapy versus no 
routine use, there was a 20% proportional reduction in the major vascular event rate 
per mmol/L LDL-reduction (Figure 4).32 The proportional risk reduction was smaller 
during the first year after starting treatment, whereas it was 24% (i.e. a risk ratio of 
0.76) during each subsequent year that allocation to statin therapy was continued 
  
28 
 
(p<0.0001 for difference between effects in first versus later years).31 In the trials of 
more versus less intensive statin regimens, the average 0.5 mmol/L further reduction 
in LDL cholesterol yielded a 15% further proportional reduction in the rate of major 
vascular events (Figure 3), corresponding to a 28% reduction (i.e. a risk ratio of 0.72) 
per mmol/l further LDL-reduction during each year of treatment (with no apparent 
delay after increasing the intensity of statin therapy).32 
Consequently, the proportional reduction in the risk of major vascular events per 
mmol/l was about one-quarter in the trials of statin versus no statin (after an initial 
delay) and of more versus less intensive therapy. Based on the combined findings 
from these two sets of trials, it can be estimated that reducing LDL cholesterol levels 
by 2 mmol/L would reduce the risk of major vascular events by about 45% (derived 
as [1.0 – (0.75 x 0.75)] x 100) during each year treatment is continued. In principle, 
even larger reductions in LDL cholesterol would be expected to produce even larger 
risk reductions (e.g. 60-70% with 3-4 mmol/L LDL-reductions); however, this is likely 
only to be clinically relevant in limited circumstances (e.g. for individuals with familial 
hypercholesterolaemia who have very high LDL cholesterol levels). 
In these meta-analyses, statin therapy produced similar proportional reductions per 
mmol/L LDL-reduction in the risks of each of the main components of the composite 
outcome of major vascular events (i.e. myocardial infarctions and coronary deaths; 
strokes of any type; or coronary revascularisations).32 The proportional reductions in 
major vascular events were also similar among different types of patient.31-33,183 For 
example, as would be expected from the log-linear associations in observational 
epidemiological studies between coronary disease risk and cholesterol concentration 
(Figure 2b), the proportional reductions in risk per mmol/L reduction were about the 
  
29 
 
same irrespective of the presenting levels of cholesterol (Figure 1). The proportional 
risk reductions appeared to be smaller among individuals aged over 75 who were 
included in these trials, but they had a higher prevalence of severe heart failure and 
end-stage renal disease (conditions associated with non-atherosclerotic vascular 
outcomes not much influenced by lowering LDL cholesterol).184 Moreover, since the 
absolute risks of major vascular events were higher among older individuals, the 
absolute benefits were of similar size to those among the younger individuals. The 
proportional risk reductions also appeared to be slightly smaller among the women 
included in these trials. However, this apparent difference could be accounted for 
largely by differences in non-sex-related characteristics, and the relative effects were 
similar for men and women at equivalent risk of cardiovascular events.33 The risks of 
major vascular events were reduced in secondary prevention as well as in primary 
prevention (including among individuals with diabetes or hypertension),29,31 but the 
proportional reductions were somewhat larger among lower-risk individuals. This 
finding is consistent with results from “Mendelian randomization” studies,185 which 
indicate that genetically-determined exposure to lower LDL cholesterol levels before 
atherosclerosis has developed may produce larger risk reductions.169 
In general, the absolute benefits of using statin therapy depend on an individual’s 
absolute risk of atherosclerotic events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol 
that can be achieved. For example, 5 years of treatment with a statin regimen that 
lowers LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L would be expected to prevent major vascular 
events in about 1000 (10%) higher-risk patients per 10,000 treated and in about 500 
(5%) lower-risk patients per 10,000 treated (Figure 5; which also provides estimates 
of the absolute benefits with 1.5 and 1.0 mmol/L LDL-reductions ).32 The continued 
follow-up of patients beyond the end of the trials has found that the benefits of statin 
  
30 
 
therapy persist97-102 (and may even become larger96,103,104) for many years after the 
differences in statin use between the randomized groups have ceased. However, of 
more relevance for a treatment that is intended to be continued life-long once it has 
been started, the meta-analyses show that statin therapy reduces the risk of major 
vascular events during each year that it is continued (Figure 4). Consequently, even 
larger absolute benefits would be expected with statin therapy that is continued for 
longer than the average of about 5 years in these randomized trials.  
Reductions in coronary mortality 
Overall in the CTT meta-analyses, there was a statistically robust 12% proportional 
reduction in vascular mortality per mmol/L LDL-reduction (Figure 6), attributable 
chiefly to a 20% proportional reduction in coronary deaths (with, as was seen for 
major vascular events, a greater proportional effect after the first year of treatment), 
along with a 8% reduction in other cardiac deaths (some of which, such as those due 
to arrhythmias or heart failure, may not be due to atherosclerotic causes and so not 
amenable to LDL-lowering therapy).32 Both for the aggregate of all vascular deaths 
and for coronary and non-coronary causes considered separately, the proportional 
reductions in risk per mmol/L LDL-reduction appear to be similar in patients with and 
without pre-existing vascular disease, and in those who present at different levels of 
baseline vascular risk, as well as in other subgroups that have been considered.31-33  
As discussed above, when there is compelling evidence of an effect of a treatment 
on a particular outcome (i.e. vascular mortality) and this is supported by the effects 
on related outcomes (i.e. the even more statistically robust reductions in non-fatal 
major vascular events with statin therapy), then the appropriate question to ask is 
whether there is good evidence that the treatment does not reduce that outcome in 
  
31 
 
different circumstances3,68,69 (rather than whether there is direct evidence of benefit 
in every circumstance). Even in the aggregate of all of the trials in the CTT meta-
analyses, too few vascular deaths occurred among lower-risk participants for direct 
assessment of the effects of statin therapy in such individuals considered in isolation 
(as has been proposed by some commentators11,12,186). However, the proportional 
risk reduction was statistically compatible with the reduction observed in higher-risk 
patients (trend p=0·7) and it was supported by the clear reduction in major vascular 
events among lower-risk patients.32 Similarly, although there were too few women in 
these trials to assess the effects on vascular mortality directly (which has been the 
basis of assertions that statin therapy is not beneficial for women187-191), the 
proportional reductions were similar among women and men (interaction p=0·8) and 
were reinforced by definite reductions in major vascular events among women.33 
Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that statin therapy produces proportional 
reductions of at least 20% in coronary mortality per mmol/L LDL-reduction among 
people at different levels of occlusive vascular risk irrespective of their gender and, 
assuming that the proportions of vascular deaths due to coronary and non-coronary 
causes are similar, of 12% in deaths from all vascular causes. The availability of 
additional evidence from large-scale trials (such as the recently reported HOPE-3 
trial in primary prevention192 and on-going STAREE trial in people aged over 70193) 
will provide more direct evidence about the effects in particular circumstances. 
Lack of effects on non-vascular mortality and cancer  
The CTT meta-analyses involved over 6,000 non-vascular deaths, and there was no 
suggestion that lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy had an effect on any 
non-vascular cause of death, including cancer (Figure 6).31,51 In a large database 
  
32 
 
analysis, a few years of statin therapy was associated with a 15% proportionally 
lower rate of cancer-related mortality after adjustment for the potential confounding 
factors that had been recorded90 and, in some other observational studies,136 with as 
much as a halving in colon cancer incidence and in prostate cancer mortality.137,138 
By contrast, there were small excesses of incident breast cancer in the CARE trial49 
and of incident cancer at all sites in the PROSPER trial among patients who were 
randomized to receive statin therapy.50 However, based on more than 10,000 cases 
of incident cancer in the CTT meta-analyses (including CARE and PROSPER), there 
were no apparent effects – either overall or at any particular site – during an average 
of 5 years of statin therapy (Figure 7). Nor were there any effects on incident cancer 
among any particular type of patient,51 including older individuals (by contrast with 
claims of hazards194). Some of these trials have extended follow-up for up to 15 
years beyond the scheduled study treatment period (after which the use of statin 
treatment in the randomized groups was similar), with no evidence that any effects 
on non-vascular mortality or on incident cancer were emerging subsequently.96-103 
All-cause mortality was reduced by statin therapy in both secondary and primary 
prevention settings32 in the CTT meta-analyses of the randomized trials. However, 
separate assessments of the effects of statin therapy on vascular mortality and on 
non-vascular mortality (supplemented by analyses of more specific causes of death 
and of the even more definite effects on related non-fatal outcomes3) are likely to be 
more sensitive to the beneficial effects, and the absence of adverse effects, of statin 
therapy on mortality than are analyses of the composite outcome of death from all 
causes combined (i.e. all-cause mortality). In addition, such cause-specific analyses 
are more readily generalized to different circumstances: given the lack of any effect 
on non-vascular mortality, the overall effects on all-cause mortality of LDL-lowering 
  
33 
 
with statin therapy reflect the observed reductions in vascular mortality or, perhaps 
even more specifically, in coronary mortality (Figure 6). 
Other beneficial effects that have been attributed to statin therapy 
In addition to the proven benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy on 
non-fatal atherosclerotic events and vascular mortality, it has been suggested that 
statins might produce beneficial effects on other health outcomes (perhaps by effects 
that are not related to lowering cholesterol).195,196 For example, statin therapy was 
found to be associated with about a halving in cases of deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism in some large randomized trials,192,197,198 but this result has not 
been confirmed in other trials.199 Similarly, the rate of post-operative atrial fibrillation 
was halved by perioperative statin therapy in some small randomized trials, but not 
in larger trials that assessed this outcome systematically.200 Use of statin therapy 
has also been associated in observational studies with lower rates of several other 
conditions (e.g. infections,201-203  chronic obstructive lung disease,204-206 and acute 
respiratory distress syndrome207), but those claims have been reliably refuted by 
randomized trials of adequate size.208-212 These findings reinforce concerns about 
basing inference about treatment effects on relatively small numbers of events in 
randomized trials or on observational studies irrespective of their size.3,4,213,214  
In summary, lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy has been shown to prevent 
both non-fatal and fatal major vascular events in a wide range of circumstances, and 
the absolute benefits depend chiefly on an individual’s absolute risk of such events 
and on the magnitude of the LDL-reduction that is achieved (as well as the duration 
of treatment). Although statin therapy does not increase the risk of death from non-
  
34 
 
vascular causes or the incidence of cancer, other potential adverse effects of statin 
therapy do still need to be considered when deciding whether to use statin therapy. 
Proven adverse effects of statin therapy 
The only excesses of adverse events that have been reliably demonstrated to be 
caused by statin therapy are myopathy and diabetes mellitus, along with a probable 
excess of haemorrhagic stroke. These excesses are larger in certain circumstances, 
but the absolute risks remain small by comparison with the absolute benefits. 
Insert Panel 4  
Increases in rates of myopathy  
Myopathy (sometimes referred to as myositis) is typically defined as muscle pain, 
tenderness, or weakness that is accompanied by substantial increases in blood 
creatine kinase (CK) levels (e.g. greater than 10 times the laboratory upper limit of 
normal).141,215 Rhabdomyolysis is a severe form of myopathy involving muscle 
breakdown (usually identified by even larger increases in CK concentrations), with 
myoglobin released into the circulation and, in some cases, leading to acute renal 
failure or worsened renal function.141 Myopathy is rare in normal circumstances. 
Approved statin regimens have been associated both in observational studies and in 
randomized trials with large relative risks for myopathy,141,150,216 but typically with 
small absolute excesses (about 1 case per 10,000 people treated per year) and even 
smaller excesses in the incidence of rhabdomyolysis (about 2-3 cases per 100,000 
treated per year).31,217 It usually resolves rapidly when statin therapy is stopped.141 
The underlying mechanisms for statin-related myopathy are not well understood. The 
risk of myopathy is dose-related and it appears to depend on the levels of the statin 
  
35 
 
in the circulation (as indicated by its association with a SLCO1B1 gene variant that 
reduces the transport of all statins from the blood into the liver).78,216,219 Cerivastatin 
was withdrawn from use because the myopathy rate observed in post-marketing 
surveillance with approved doses was much higher than with other statins.220 In the 
SEARCH randomized trial, simvastatin 80 mg daily produced a more than 10-fold 
higher rate (at least 1 myopathy case per 1,000 patients treated annually) than 20-40 
mg daily (about 1 case per 10,000 annually),78,221 so the high-dose regimen is no 
longer recommended routinely.222 The rates of reports of myopathy in regulatory 
databases are also higher with higher doses of atorvastatin, although such 
spontaneous reports may be biased and the absolute risks are still small even with 
the highest approved dose.216 The rate of myopathy can be increased substantially 
when statins are used in combination with other drugs that affect their metabolism (in 
particular, inhibitors of cytochrome P450 or the P-glycoprotein, such as cyclosporine 
and azole antifungals) 141,174,217 and in certain types of patient (e.g. people of Asian 
origin and those who have functional variation in the SLCO1B1 gene).223 More 
moderate increases (e.g. risk ratios of about 1.5 to 2) in the rate of myopathy are 
also seen in other circumstances (e.g. in combination with certain antihypertensive 
drugs and in women, people aged over 80, and those with diabetes).78  
Despite this causal association with myopathy, the randomized controlled evidence 
indicates that statin therapy has little effect on less severe muscle pain (i.e. myalgia) 
or weakness, although such symptoms are commonly attributed to statins in routine 
practice (see below). Indeed, an excess of muscle-related symptoms has generally 
only been seen in trials when it occurs in combination with increased CK levels, with 
bigger relative risks observed with larger CK increases.37 For example, in the Heart 
Protection Study of simvastatin 40 mg daily versus placebo, the relative risk for any 
  
36 
 
myalgia irrespective of increased CK levels was 0.99 (95% CI 0.95-1.03), whereas it 
was 1.7 (0.9-3.1) for myalgia with CK>4 times the upper limit of normal and 2.5 (0.8-
8.0) with CK>10 times the upper limit of normal.37,221 This result provides another 
illustration of the value of using specific outcomes to detect treatment effects, rather 
than composites of outcomes that are affected by treatment and those that are not.  
Increases in rates of diabetes mellitus 
In the JUPITER randomized trial among 17,802 patients without a history of vascular 
disease, glycated haemoglobin levels were slightly higher after about 2 years among 
the patients allocated rosuvastatin 20 mg daily than among those allocated placebo 
(5.9% vs 5.8%; p=0.001).47,224 There was also a small excess of newly diagnosed 
diabetes (3.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.01), which corresponds to a 25% (95% CI 5%-49%) 
proportional increase. In subsequent meta-analyses of the available results from the 
randomized trials, standard statin dose regimens were associated with a proportional 
increase of about 10% in reported diabetes, and more intensive statin regimens (as 
used in JUPITER) with about a 10% further increase.48,225 This excess of diabetes 
diagnoses appeared soon after the statin therapy started, chiefly among patients 
who had risk factors for diabetes (e.g. elevated BMI or HbA1c, or impaired fasting 
glucose), and did not appear to get larger as treatment continued.47,224,226,227 Prior to 
these reports from randomized trials, adverse associations had not been reported 
between statin therapy and diabetes incidence in observational studies, although 
several reports of such associations have been published subsequently.228,229 
Recently, it has been found that genetic variants that reduce the activity of HMGCoA 
reductase (which is analogous to inhibiting this enzyme with a statin) are associated 
with increased incidence of diabetes.230 On the other hand, individuals with familial 
  
37 
 
hypercholesterolaemia – in whom the numbers and function of LDL-receptors on cell 
surfaces are reduced (by contrast with the increase in receptors produced by statins) 
– had been diagnosed with diabetes less frequently than their unaffected relatives.231 
These genetic “experiments of nature” provide support for the association of statin 
therapy with an excess of diabetes being causal. The mechanism is not known: it 
could be that it is directly related to LDL-lowering, but it has also been hypothesised 
that increasing the numbers of LDL-receptors (e.g. with treatments like statins and 
PCSK9 inhibitors) may cause diabetes by allowing more cholesterol to enter and 
damage pancreatic cells.231 
However, the clinical relevance of this excess of diabetes is less clear; in particular, 
the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy are substantial despite any increase in 
diabetes-related morbidity. The underlying incidence of new onset diabetes in the 
primary prevention trials was about 1% per year, so the absolute excess with statin 
therapy was about 10-20 per 10,000 per year (with this range reflecting the intensity 
of the statin regimen). If it is assumed that this statin-related diabetes is associated 
with as much as a doubling of cardiovascular risk (as is the case for spontaneously-
occurring diabetes232) then it might result in major vascular events among about 5-10 
of 10,000 primary prevention individuals with an underlying 5-year risk of 5-10% who 
are treated for 5 years. However, despite this potential adverse impact, lowering LDL 
cholesterol by 1-2 mmol/L with statin therapy prevents major vascular events among 
about 150-300 per 10,000 such primary prevention individuals who are treated for 5 
years (Figure 5). The absolute benefits are even larger among higher-risk patients 
(including those who already have diabetes: Figures 1 and 5)32 and, again despite 
any adverse impact of the diabetes excess, increase while statin therapy continues 
  
38 
 
to be taken (Figure 4). As is discussed later, there is also no good evidence of an 
excess of microvascular complications related to diabetes with statin therapy. 
Probable increases in rates of haemorrhagic stroke 
In observational studies, blood cholesterol levels have been found to be negatively 
associated with haemorrhagic stroke rates, particularly at low levels of cholesterol in 
people with high blood pressure.154,233,234 In the randomized SPARCL trial among 
4700 patients with prior cerebrovascular disease, allocation to atorvastatin 80 mg 
daily produced a definite reduction in ischaemic stroke (218 [9.2%] vs 274 [11.6%]; 
p=0·008), but there was also a possible increase in haemorrhagic stroke (55 [2.3%] 
vs 33 [1.4%]; p=0·02).38 When these results were combined with those from the 
other trials included in the CTT meta-analysis, there was a 21% (95% CI 5%-41%; 
p=0·01) proportional increase in the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke per mmol/L 
reduction in LDL cholesterol.31,32  
In Western populations, this would typically translate into an absolute excess of 
about 5-10 haemorrhagic strokes per 10,000 patients in whom LDL cholesterol is 
reduced by 1-2 mmol/L for 5 years with statin therapy. The absolute excess would be 
expected to be bigger in individuals with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease38 and 
in populations (such as Asia) where the underlying rates of haemorrhagic stroke are 
higher.235 However, statin therapy has been found to reduce the overall risk of stroke 
in many different settings (including in people who have already had a stroke38 or 
have hypertension103) irrespective of the underlying risk of vascular disease.32 For 
example, the increase in haemorrhagic stroke is outweighed by the reduction in the 
risk of ischaemic stroke, as well as in other occlusive vascular events and deaths, 
even among individuals with a 5-year risk of major vascular events below 10%. 
  
39 
 
Other adverse events that have been attributed to statin therapy 
It has been suggested that statin therapy causes increased rates of other types of 
adverse health outcome, as well as of symptomatic side-effects (chiefly muscle pain 
and weakness) that prevent a large proportion of patients from continuing to take 
statin therapy long-term, often now referred to as “statin intolerance”.10-12,22,61,71-73 
These claims have been based chiefly on reports to regulatory authorities of adverse 
events that have been attributed to a statin and on non-randomized observational 
studies based on health care databases. However, they are not supported by the 
randomized controlled trial evidence: in particular, statin therapy has been found to 
be no less well tolerated than placebo (see below and webtable).52,62,236-239  
As is discussed above, the potential biases inherent in studies without both randomly 
assigned control groups and blinded ascertainment of outcomes limit their ability to 
demonstrate causal associations (except for large effects on rare outcomes). This is 
particularly the case for symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin use, 
especially if such reports have been prompted by guidance from clinicians to their 
patients or from patient information leaflets and other sources.142-144,240,241 By 
contrast, the inclusion of large numbers of different patient types in randomized 
controlled trials of prolonged statin therapy with different eligibility criteria provides 
unbiased evidence about adverse effects of treatment that are relevant to routine 
clinical practice. 
Muscle-related outcomes (other than myopathy) 
The adverse events most commonly attributed to statin therapy relate to muscle pain 
(i.e. myalgia) or other muscle-related symptoms. For example, based on the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), it was reported that 23% of 671 
  
40 
 
statin users who did not have arthritis recalled having episodes of musculoskeletal 
pain (not muscle pain specifically) during the previous month compared with 18% of 
4499 individuals who were not taking a statin.242 After statistical adjustment for the 
recorded differences (which were substantial) between the characteristics of the 
patients using and not using a statin, a prevalence ratio of 1.33 (95% CI 1.06-1.67; 
p=0.02) was reported with statin use. In another observational study of statin use 
based on health care data, musculoskeletal pain was reported by 73.4% of 6967 
statin users compared with 71.6% of 6967 non-users during a median of 4.7 years, 
yielding an odds ratio of 1.09 (95% CI 1.02-1.18; p=0.02) after attempting to match 
patients with propensity scores based on recorded characteristics (which, again, 
differed substantially).89  
Both of these reports discussed the inability of such non-randomized studies to 
assess causality due to the potential for residual differences between patients who 
had used statins and those who had not (despite statistical adjustment for recorded 
characteristics). They also mentioned the potential for ascertainment bias due to 
patients who were taking statins being examined more frequently. However, neither 
report commented on the inherent lack of “blinding” of treatment in such studies and 
the consequent potential for bias due to patients prescribed statins being advised by 
their doctors that they may cause muscle pain (whereas such advice is, of course, 
not given to patients not prescribed a statin)243. In addition, the analysis of NHANES 
excluded the 3,058 individuals with arthritis in whom statin use was not associated 
with any excess of musculoskeletal pain (0.96; 95% CI 0.81-1.15).242 Such data-
dependent selection of which patients to exclude introduces yet another potential 
source of bias into this assessment of the effects of statin therapy.3  
  
41 
 
In general, the data available for observational studies based on health care records 
do not derive from a systematic approach to seeking and recording information about 
symptoms or about the use of statin therapy. The Prédiction du Risque Musculaire 
en Observationnel (PRIMO) survey tried to overcome this limitation by systematically 
seeking information about the muscle symptoms that were reported.244 Among 7924 
hyperlipidaemic patients receiving high-dose statin therapy, 10.5% reported muscle 
symptoms at a median of about 1 month after starting it. However, those patients 
were required to give informed consent, which presumably involved advising them 
that statins can cause muscle problems and that the aim was to assess this outcome 
specifically, increasing the likelihood of prompting reports of muscle symptoms. In 
any case, since there was no control group in that study, it is not able to provide any 
useful information as to whether statins cause an increase in such symptoms. 
It has been asserted that the rates of muscle-related symptoms caused by statins 
may be under-estimated in randomized trials due to exclusion of patients at risk of 
these problems (such as those with a history of muscle problems or CK elevations 
with statin therapy) and a perceived lack of systematic questioning and standardised 
definitions.11,12,22-24,72,245 However, as is discussed above, few patients would have 
been exposed to statin therapy prior to recruitment into many of the large clinical 
outcome trials and use of a pre-randomization placebo “run-in” phase in about half of 
the trials (see webtable) would tend to increase the sensitivity of the subsequent 
randomized comparisons to detect any effects.75 The inclusion of large numbers of 
different types of patient in different randomized trials with different eligibility criteria 
also makes the evidence about any side-effects of statin therapy far more widely 
generalizable63 to routine practice than is often asserted.2,11,12,22-24 
  
42 
 
In addition, as is also discussed above, use of blinded control groups ensures that 
health outcomes are ascertained in the same way in the different treatment groups 
within any particular trial.17,18,243  Consequently, even though different randomized 
trials of statin therapy did not always use the same methods to identify or classify 
muscle symptoms (and may even have failed to detect some relevant events: see 
Table 1), each within-trial blinded comparison should still provide a reliable 
assessment of the effects of statin therapy on muscle-related problems (and, indeed, 
on other adverse events).19 Moreover, even though some of the trials did not seek 
information about muscle-related problems, this would not introduce bias into the 
assessment of the effects of statin therapy based on the trials that did record them. 
In principle, the failure of some trials that did record such outcomes to publish their 
results does have the potential to introduce bias. However, muscle-related problems 
are common, and the large numbers of such outcomes that have been reported from 
many different trials makes it unlikely that material bias in the published literature 
exists. 
Consequently, the general lack of differences between the randomized treatment 
groups in the rates of the different muscle-related outcomes recorded in the large 
blinded trials that are eligible for the CTT meta-analysis (some of which assessed 
such symptoms particularly carefully: see webtable) provides strong evidence 
against statin therapy causing much effect on muscle-related symptoms. In the 
JUPITER and HOPE-3 trials of rosuvastatin 20 mg and 10 mg daily, respectively, 
there were small excesses in some muscle-related outcomes47,192,246. However, no 
excesses of muscle-related outcomes were observed among the large numbers of 
patients in the other large randomized blinded trials of long-term statin therapy. Nor 
  
43 
 
were there excesses in those trials that sought information about the severity of any 
muscle symptoms or about stopping study treatment due to muscle symptoms.243 
The STOMP trial was specifically designed to assess the effects of statin therapy on 
a number of pre-specified muscle-related measures.245 Compared with 236 patients 
allocated placebo, there were no apparent effects on muscle strength or endurance, 
aerobic performance or physical activity among 232 statin-naïve patients randomly 
allocated atorvastatin 80 mg daily for 6 months. Cases of unexplained muscle pain 
(23 [9.9%] vs 14 [5.9%]; p=0.1) and the subset of those cases defined as myalgia 
(19 [8.2%] vs 10 [4.2%]; p=0.08) were reported more commonly among patients 
allocated atorvastatin, but these differences in the pre-specified intention-to-treat 
comparisons were compatible with chance. In a meta-analysis of 26 blinded trials 
(including STOMP) that involved at least 6 months of statin therapy,247 there was 
little difference in the reported rates of muscle problems during an average treatment 
duration of 3 years: 12.7% among 59,237 participants allocated statin versus 12.4% 
among 54,458 allocated placebo; an absolute excess of 0.3% (95% CI 0% to 0.7%; 
p=0.06) or, alternatively, a range of 0 to 20 cases per 10,000 years of treatment. 
Similarly, combination of the results for myalgia in the large placebo-controlled trials 
that were eligible for the CTT meta-analyses (see webtable) yields similar results: 
5162 (11.7%) cases allocated statin therapy versus 5015 (11.4%) allocated placebo 
control during an average of 5 years of treatment (p=0.10). Moreover, the difference 
is even smaller in the numbers of cases of muscle problems that resulted in study 
treatment being stopped: 210 (0.65%) versus 182 (0.59%); p=0.83.  
Cross-over trials in which active and placebo treatment are allocated in a random 
sequence to each patient may be particularly sensitive for detecting adverse effects 
  
44 
 
that emerge rapidly after treatment starts and resolve soon after stopping treatment. 
No differences in myalgia or other pain measures were observed in a randomized re-
challenge trial with 3 statin/placebo paired cross-over comparisons among 8 patients 
with prior statin-related myalgia (with or without CK elevations), and 5 of the patients 
resumed statin therapy.248In another trial, 86 patients were assigned simvastatin 40 
mg daily (combined with amlodipine, losartan and hydrochlorthiazide) or a matching 
placebo in a random sequence; muscle pain was reported more commonly on the 
active polypill (9 vs 1 cases), but it was not considered sufficiently troublesome to 
stop treatment.249 Among 491 patients with a history of not tolerating two or more 
statin regimens who were randomized to receive atorvastatin 20 mg daily then 
placebo or placebo then atorvastatin,250 muscle-related symptoms were reported by 
43% of the patients when on atorvastatin but not on placebo versus 27% of them 
when on placebo but not on atorvastatin; yielding a risk ratio of 1.5 (although it has 
been suggested that this trial may not have been properly blinded243). In a similar 
cross-over trial among 120 patients with a history of muscle complaints who were 
randomized to simvastatin 20 mg daily then placebo or placebo then simvastatin, 
muscle pain was reported by 36% of the patients when on simvastatin but not on 
placebo versus 29% of them when on placebo but not on simvastatin.251,252 These 
results indicate that, even among highly selected patients who have repeatedly 
attributed intolerable symptoms to statin therapy, some of the reported muscle-
related intolerance may be due to the statin but most of it is not.  
In summary, given the 0.3% absolute excess of muscle problems based on more 
than 10,000 reported cases in meta-analyses of randomized trials during 3-5 years 
of treatment (webtable),247 the excess rate of symptomatic muscle pain and other 
muscle-related problems due to statin therapy would appear to be no more than 
  
45 
 
about 10-20 cases annually per 10,000 treated individuals, with only about 1 of those 
cases associated with substantial elevations in CK concentrations (i.e. myopathy) 
and requiring statin therapy to be stopped.  
Memory and other aspects of cognition 
Another adverse event that is commonly attributed to statin therapy is memory loss. 
Following a review of potential side-effects, the UK Medicines & Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) decided in 2009 that memory loss should be listed as a 
side-effect in the product information for all statins.253 The stated rationale was that 
the evidence from re-challenge studies for cases of memory loss reported with statin 
therapy was not sufficient to rule out causality. Similarly, in 2012, the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) required a statement to be added to the drug label for all 
statins that there was a potential for cognitive side-effects (such as memory loss and 
confusion).254 The basis for this decision was post-marketing event reports from 
individuals of ill-defined memory loss or impairment that appeared to be reversible 
after discontinuing statin therapy, and not because there was high quality evidence 
for a causal link. Indeed, a subsequent assessment of FDA surveillance databases 
found the rates of cognition-associated adverse event reporting rates for statins to be 
similar to those of other drugs used in patients with atherosclerotic disease.255 
Moreover, large-scale randomized trials with blinded control groups have provided 
evidence that allocation to statin therapy is not associated with an excess of memory 
loss or adverse effects on other aspects of cognitive function. In particular, cognitive 
measures were carefully assessed among the 5804 patients aged 70-82 years who 
were randomly allocated pravastatin 40 mg daily or placebo for an average of 3.2 
years in the PROSPER trial.53,54 At baseline and then annually, the mini mental state 
  
46 
 
examination and a battery of psychometric tests (i.e. picture-word learning test, 
Stroop colour word test, and letter digit coding test) were administered. This elderly 
population might be expected to be especially sensitive to effects of treatment on 
cognition. However, these specific measures of cognitive function declined at the 
same rate in the statin and placebo groups, with no apparent differences between 
the randomized treatment groups. 
Effects on memory were also systematically assessed among the 20,536 patients 
randomly allocated simvastatin 40 mg daily or placebo for an average of 5 years in 
the Heart Protection Study.221 At the end of the scheduled treatment period, the well-
validated modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) questionnaire 
was administered to participants. A TICS-m score below 22 was pre-specified as 
indicative of cognitive impairment and, as would be expected, was more common 
among older individuals. However, despite this discriminatory ability, there were no 
apparent differences between the statin and placebo groups in the percentages of 
participants classified as cognitively impaired, either overall (23·7% simvastatin vs 
24·2% placebo) or among the 5806 patients aged 75-85 years when assessed 
(34·6% vs 36·2%). Nor were there differences between the treatment groups in the 
numbers of participants reported to have developed dementia during follow-up (31 
[0·3%] vs 31 [0·3%]), albeit that the numbers of events were small.  
In addition, a randomized placebo-controlled trial among 1016 individuals without 
cardiovascular disease or diabetes has been conducted specifically to assess the 
effects of statin therapy on cognition (as well as on several outcomes related to 
mood and behaviour).256 In that trial, the patients were allocated simvastatin 20 mg 
daily, pravastatin 40 mg daily or placebo for 6 months, with the administration of a 
  
47 
 
battery of tests of cognition (i.e. recurrent words, Elithorm maze, digital vigilance and 
grooved pegboard) at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 8 months. Although the trial was 
completed in 2004, results for the primary outcome of cognition have not yet been 
published in full (although selected results for some of the other outcomes were 
published recently257); however, the results reported in a meeting abstract indicate 
that the statin regimens tested were not associated with adverse effects on cognitive 
function, albeit the duration of exposure was comparatively short.258 Qualitative and 
quantitative systematic reviews of available evidence from randomized trials have 
also not found evidence of any adverse effects of exposure to statin therapy on a 
wide range of different cognitive measures.255,259 
In a particularly rigorous assessment of effects on cognitive function, 640 patients 
aged 50-90 with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease were randomized to receive 
atorvastatin 80 mg daily or placebo for 72 weeks.55 The co-primary outcomes were 
Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale and Alzheimer’s Disease 
Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change, which were assessed at 3 
monthly intervals for 18 months, along with several other measures of cognition at 6 
monthly intervals. The results for both of these scores were slightly in favour of statin 
therapy, with no apparent differences between the treatment groups in any of the 
other cognitive outcomes assessed, which provides further reassurance. 
Consequently, given the weight of evidence against adverse effects of statin therapy 
on memory or other aspects of cognition, it would now be appropriate for regulatory 
authorities to consider their removal from lists of potential adverse effects in the drug 
labels so that patients are not inappropriately deterred from using statin therapy. 
Quality of life related measures 
  
48 
 
Few of the large long-term randomized placebo-controlled trials of statin therapy 
specifically assessed quality of life, but there was no evidence of any adverse effect 
in those that did. For example, in the AFCAPS trial in primary prevention, an adapted 
version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey was 
administered in 1126 patients between lovastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo. Mean 
scores at baseline for emotional well-being and health perception measures were 84 
and 83 respectively (range = 0 to 100; higher score representing better quality of life) 
and differences of ±1.2 points and ±1.5 points at 1 year were excluded.260 In the 
LIPID trial among patients with coronary disease, an enhanced version of the utility-
based quality-of-life questionnaire was administered at baseline and 1, 3 and 5 years 
later in a sub-cohort of 1112 randomized patients.261 The summary utility score was 
0.98 (where 0 = dead and 1 = normal good health) at baseline, with a slight decline 
over time but no apparent difference in scores among survivors at 5 years between 
the pravastatin and placebo groups (0.978 vs 0.976). 
The CRISP trial was conducted specifically to assess the effects of statin therapy on 
health-related quality of life in 431 men and women aged over 65 years of age.262 At 
6 and 12 months, there were no apparent differences between patients allocated 
lovastatin 40 or 20 mg daily versus placebo in terms of a battery of tests related to 
physical functioning, sleep, social support, depression, cognitive function and health 
perception. Nor were there any apparent differences in reported symptoms, including 
worsening muscle pain (15.0% vs 14.5% vs 15.0%) at 6 months. Measures related 
to quality of life have also been assessed in randomized controlled trials of statin 
therapy in specific types of patient (e.g. those with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic 
lupus erythematosus, peripheral arterial disease, and erectile dysfunction),263-266 with 
no good evidence of any adverse effects on any of these measures. Nor was there 
  
49 
 
evidence for an adverse effect of statin therapy in a meta-analysis of randomized 
trials that assessed psychological outcomes.267 
Cataract and other vision-related outcomes 
It has been claimed, based on an observational study of the records of more than 2 
million people in general practice databases, that statin therapy produces absolute 
increases in the risk of developing cataract that are of about the same magnitude as 
the absolute reductions in major coronary events and cerebrovascular events when 
used in primary prevention for people with a 10 year risk of cardiovascular events of 
at least 20%.87 The report of that study does mention that observational studies have 
potential biases and that it was not designed to show causality. However, it goes on 
to describe the observed associations with cataract as “effects” of statin therapy (as 
does a related website268) and refers to “numbers-needed-to-harm”, which implies 
that there is a causal association. 
In the report of that observational study, it was stated that it had advantages over the 
available randomized controlled trials of statin therapy because they lack sufficient 
detail about health outcomes, duration of follow-up and statistical power.87 However, 
with respect to data quality, information obtained from retrospective interrogation of 
databases created for other purposes (primary care records in this case) are not 
likely to be more reliable than information about adverse events sought prospectively 
and systematically in randomized trials. In addition, the ability to blind the treatment 
assignment in randomized trials helps to ensure that outcomes are ascertained and 
reported in the same way (within any particular randomized trial) both among the 
patients who are allocated to statin therapy and among those who are not, which 
helps to avoid biased ascertainment (by contrast with observational studies). With 
  
50 
 
regard to the duration of exposure to statin therapy, this was not reported explicitly 
for that observational study, but the person-years of follow-up87 indicate that it was 
not longer than several randomized trials of the effects of statin therapy on clinical 
outcomes.33 Consequently, any real effects would be expected to have emerged in 
those trials, particularly since the risk of cataract was reported in this observational 
study to have been increased within a year of starting a statin.  
With respect to statistical power, it is the case that this very large observational study 
does involve more cases of different health outcomes than even the meta-analyses 
of the randomized trials of statin therapy. However, some of the larger trials involved 
sufficient numbers of cases of various outcomes to be able to confirm or refute quite 
moderate effects reliably. The relative risk of cataract in the observational study that 
was used to estimate the stated “number-needed-to harm” with statin therapy was 
about 1.30 (with a narrow 95% CI of 1.26-1.35).87 Two large randomized trials have 
reported information on cataract: in the Heart Protection Study of simvastatin 40 mg 
daily and HOPE-3 trial of rosuvastatin 10 mg daily, cataracts were recorded among a 
total of 634 (3.8%) patients assigned 5-6 years of statin therapy versus 598 (3.6%) 
who had been assigned placebo,192,269 corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.06 (95% 
CI 0.95-1.19) which excludes the effect size that had been claimed.  
Moreover, as was the case for cognition, some of the randomized controlled trials of 
statin therapy were designed specifically to detect effects on lens opacities and on 
other outcomes related to vision. For example, the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of 
Lovastatin (EXCEL) trial involved pupil dilation and slit lamp examination at baseline 
and after 48 weeks of lovastatin (20 mg or 40 mg daily) or matching placebo in 8032 
patients.56 Despite using such sensitive measures in large numbers of patients, there 
  
51 
 
were no apparent differences between the statin and placebo groups in the rates of 
ocular opacities after 48 weeks of exposure. Nor did detailed ophthalmic examination 
at 6 and 18 months in the Oxford Cholesterol Study find any differences in lens 
opacities between the 539 patients randomly assigned simvastatin (20 or 40 mg 
daily) or placebo.58 In the 4S placebo-controlled trial of simvastatin (20-40 mg daily) 
among 4443 patients, slit lamp examination conducted at baseline, 1 year and 5-6 
years also did not identify any excesses in lens opacities with prolonged exposure to 
statin therapy, and nor was there an excess of cataract: 53 (2.4%) cases among 
patients allocated simvastatin vs 66 cases (3.0%) among those allocated placebo 
(odds ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.55-1.17).57  
In addition, there is no good evidence of eye-related microvascular complications 
due to statin therapy. For example, despite careful assessment of more than 12,000 
patients in EXCEL and 4S, no adverse effects on visual acuity were detected 56,57. 
Annual fundoscopy in the on-going EMPATHY randomized trial comparing 4.5 years 
of more versus less intensive statin therapy among about 6,000 patients who have 
diabetic retinopathy will provide more information about the retinopathy outcome.270 
Statin therapy has been associated with lower rates of progression of age-related 
macular degeneration in observational studies, but there is limited evidence from 
randomized trials to support this apparent protective effect.271  
The refutation of the claims of large effects of statin therapy on cataract, reinforced 
by the clear lack of effects on more sensitive measures of lens opacities, provides 
another illustration of how the combination of large size and the inherent biases of 
non-randomized studies can lead to associations of a treatment with an outcome that 
may be precise (i.e. involve small random errors) but not causal.

Kidney-related outcomes 
In light of the increased incidence of diabetes with statin therapy, it is appropriate to 
consider whether there are any excesses of microvascular complications related to 
the kidney. In a meta-analysis of 57 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 
about 140,000 patients treated for at least 6 months, statin therapy slowed the rate 
of decline of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by 0.41 (95% CI 0.11 to 
0.70) mL/min/1.73 m2 per year.272 In addition, compared with control, statin therapy 
produced a standardized mean smaller increase in albuminuria or proteinuria of 0.65 
(95% CI 0.94 to 0.37) among about 5,000 patients in 29 trials that had reported such 
data. Despite these beneficial trends, statin therapy did not appear to have an effect 
on progression to end-stage renal disease in randomized trials: 1261 (13.5%) cases 
on statin versus 1282 (13.6%) cases on control (odds ratio 0.98; 95% CI 0.90-1.07). 
It has been variously reported from observational studies that use of a statin is 
associated with increases, decreases and no change in rates of kidney injury or 
failure.87 Short-term peri-operative statin therapy increased blood levels of creatinine 
consistent with acute kidney injury in some randomized trials in cardiac 
surgery.273,274 However, in large randomized controlled trials of long-term statin-
based therapy, excesses of renal failure were not observed: for example, acute-on-
chronic renal failure in the SHARP trial among people who already had chronic 
kidney disease when randomized: 209 (6.7%) cases on simvastatin 20 mg plus 
ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus 231 (7.4%) cases on placebo (risk ratio 0.91; 95% CI 
0.75-1.09);275 renal failure or impairment in the Heart Protection Study among people 
with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes: 65 (0.6%) cases on simvastatin 
40mg daily versus 60 (0.6%) cases on placebo (risk ratio 1.07; 95% CI 0.76-1.52); 
276 and renal failure in the JUPITER trial in the primary prevention setting: 71 (0.9%) 
  
53 
 
cases on rosuvastatin 20mg daily versus 70 (0.9%) cases on placebo (risk ratio 1.01; 
95% CI 0.73-1.41).246  
Consequently, as with differences in the rates of other outcomes that have been 
associated with statin use in observational studies, the randomized controlled trial 
evidence does not provide support for an adverse effect of statin therapy on the 
kidney (except perhaps in the peri-operative setting) and, instead, indicates that it 
may slow the progression of renal impairment (although the clinical significance of 
the small effect that has been observed is uncertain). If, however, statin therapy is 
not stopped when statin-related myopathy occurs this may lead to renal failure, so 
doctors and patients do need to be alert to the possibility of this rare complication 
(while, at the same time, not attributing muscle symptoms to statin therapy without 
confirmatory evidence and stopping it unnecessarily). 
Evidence against adverse effects on other outcomes 
In addition to the proven and refuted adverse effects described above, it has also 
been suggested that statin therapy might produce adverse effects on several other 
health outcomes (for example, liver disease, sleep disturbance, aggression, suicidal 
behaviour, erectile dysfunction, neuropathy).253 These claims have typically derived 
from case reports or observational studies of statin use and, in most cases, reliable 
evidence exists that refutes them.52 For example, although statin therapy can lead to 
increases in liver enzyme levels, it is associated with very low rates of serious liver 
injury (about 1 case per 100,000 users)277 in post-marketing surveillance data and it 
is uncertain that this association is causal.254 On the other hand, the National Lipid 
Association’s Liver Expert Panel concluded that routine liver function monitoring 
might motivate doctors to discontinue statin therapy inappropriately when liver 
  
54 
 
enzyme elevations are detected and, by so doing, put patients at increased risk of 
cardiovascular events.278 Statin therapy has also been associated with increased 
rates of pancreatitis in observational studies, whereas a meta-analysis of the 
available evidence from randomized trials indicates that it may reduce the risk 
(although more evidence is required to confirm that finding). 
Even when not all the adverse events that were recorded in randomized trials have 
been reported publicly, they are likely to have been reviewed in detail by regulatory 
authorities.62 Moreover, the data that are publicly available from large randomized 
trials are often sufficient to rule out excesses of the magnitude claimed from non-
randomized and uncontrolled studies (as with the examples of myalgia and cataract 
discussed above and, similarly, with the refutation246,280 of case reports281 suggesting 
a 3-fold risk of peripheral neuropathy with statin therapy). In many cases, the lack of 
availability of recorded data reflects restrictions that used to exist on the amount of 
information that could be included in a journal paper, with the emphasis being on 
reporting observed differences in outcome between the treatment groups (which 
tended to result in bias against reporting null findings). That limitation can now be 
avoided by linking web-tabulations of all recorded adverse events to the journal 
article, as was done recently for the THRIVE trial of niacin41 and HOPE-3 trial of 
rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.192 Such tabulations have also been provided for the Heart 
Protection Study of simvastatin 40 mg daily versus placebo 276 and for the SEARCH 
trial of simvastatin 20 mg versus 80 mg daily,282 and it is anticipated that they will 
become available for other statin trials. 
Although meta-analyses based on all of the adverse events recorded in all of the 
major trials of statin therapy – as are now being conducted by the CTT Collaborative 
  
55 
 
Group182 – may identify some small additional adverse or beneficial effects, it is not 
likely that large absolute effects on any outcome will emerge. Consequently, their 
findings are not likely to alter the balance of benefit and harm materially for any 
particular type of patient (even those at low risk of cardiovascular events). 
CONCLUSIONS 
There is an important need for greater recognition of the limitations of observational 
studies and case reports as a source of reliable information about the effects of a 
treatment on health outcomes (except in the special circumstances where both the 
effects are large and the outcome would not normally be expected to occur). By 
contrast, a better understanding is needed of the strengths of randomized controlled 
trials of adequate size with systematic assessment of adverse health outcomes and, 
particularly for symptomatic side-effects, blinded assignment of treatment for the 
identification of any moderate beneficial and adverse effects on common outcomes 
that may exist.  
Proven benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol with effective statin regimens 
Large-scale evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates clearly that, 
after a somewhat smaller risk reduction in the first year of treatment, statin therapy 
reduces the risk of major vascular events during each subsequent year by about one 
quarter for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol.32 The failure to recognise that 
the reported risk reductions with statin therapy related specifically to 1 mmol/L LDL-
reductions led some commentators to under-estimate substantially the benefits of 
actually taking statin therapy.10-12,22,70,186 For, whereas lowering LDL cholesterol by 1 
mmol/L would reduce risk by about one quarter during each year after the first, the 
  
56 
 
effective statin regimens now available that can reduce LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L 
in many patients would approximately halve their risk of heart attacks and strokes.  
Statins have been shown to produce similar proportional reductions per mmol/L LDL-
reduction in the risks of major vascular events in many different types of patient (e.g. 
lower and higher risk, women and men, older and younger), irrespective of their 
presenting cholesterol levels.32,33 Consequently, the absolute benefits of lowering 
LDL cholesterol by a given amount depend on the absolute risk of the individuals 
being treated rather than their presenting cholesterol levels (or other characteristics). 
For that reason, treatment guidelines now focus on an individual’s risk of vascular 
events rather than on their LDL cholesterol concentrations alone.158,159 Lowering LDL 
cholesterol by 2 mmol/L with an effective low-cost statin regimen (e.g. atorvastatin 
40 mg daily, which costs less than £2 per month283) for 5 years in 10,000 patients 
would typically prevent major vascular events from occurring in about 1000 high-risk 
patients (i.e. 10% absolute benefit) with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease 
(“secondary prevention”) and in 500 patients (i.e. 5% absolute benefit) who are at 
increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event (“primary prevention”).32 
Moreover, since statin therapy reduces vascular event risk further during each year it 
is taken, more prolonged therapy would produce even larger absolute benefits.169,284 
The proportional reduction in LDL cholesterol produced by a given statin regimen is 
similar irrespective of the starting cholesterol level. As a consequence, and perhaps 
somewhat counter-intuitively, more potent statin regimens are required to produce 
the same absolute LDL-reduction and, hence, the same proportional risk reduction 
among individuals presenting with lower rather than higher LDL cholesterol levels.180 
This finding is reflected in the recent ACC/AHA guidelines,158 with the “high-intensity” 
  
57 
 
statin regimens considered to be warranted for patients at elevated risk of vascular 
events even if they present with average or below average LDL cholesterol levels 
(i.e. a change in emphasis towards treating high risk levels and away from treating 
high cholesterol levels). Adoption of this strategy should help avoid under-treatment 
of higher-risk patients who have LDL cholesterol levels close to the values that were 
recommended in previous guidelines as “targets” for dose titration of statin therapy.  
Proven harms of statin therapy, but minimal symptomatic side-effects 
The only adverse events shown definitely to be caused by statin therapy – that is, 
are adverse “effects” of it – are myopathy (specifically defined as muscle pain or 
weakness combined with large increases in blood levels of creatine kinase) and 
diabetes, although it is likely that the risk of haemorrhagic stroke is also increased. 
Typically, treatment of 10,000 patients for 5 years with an effective statin regimen 
(e.g. atorvastatin 40 mg daily) would be expected to cause about 5 extra cases of 
myopathy (1 of which might progress to rhabdomyolysis), 50-100 cases of diabetes, 
and 5 haemorrhagic strokes. Statin therapy may also cause symptomatic adverse 
events (e.g. muscle pain or weakness) in up to about 50-100 patients per 10,000 
treated for 5 years. The absolute excesses of adverse events with statin therapy are 
increased in certain circumstances (e.g. with higher statin doses and in combination 
with certain drugs, or in particular types of patient or population), but they are still 
small by comparison with the beneficial effects. Moreover, any adverse impact on 
major vascular events that is caused by the excesses of diabetes and haemorrhagic 
stroke has already been taken into account in the estimates of the overall benefits.  
Even so, because statins are taken by so many people, substantial numbers will still 
suffer adverse effects of statin therapy. For example, it is to be expected that about 
  
58 
 
100 myopathy cases would be caused each year among each million people who 
are prescribed statin therapy. However, whereas these adverse events are readily 
attributed to the statin (along with many other events that are not causally related285), 
it is not possible to identify those individuals in whom statin therapy has prevented a 
heart attack or stroke, even though these absolute benefits are much larger. For 
example, among each million secondary prevention patients, it can be estimated that 
about 20,000 people would avoid major vascular events each year that statin therapy 
continues.32 In addition, whereas many of the adverse effects (such as myopathy) 
can be reversed with no residual effects by stopping the statin therapy, the effects of 
a heart attack or stroke are often irreversible. 
As discussed above, it has been claimed – based chiefly on case series (e.g. reports 
to regulatory authorities of adverse events attributed to a statin) and non-randomized 
observational studies (e.g. analyses of health care databases)10-12 – that statin 
therapy causes increased rates of many other types of adverse event, including 
symptomatic side-effects (in particular, muscle pain and weakness) that prevent a 
large proportion of patients from continuing statin therapy long-term. This idea that 
so-called “statin intolerance” is a common problem is being widely promulgated, not 
just in the medical literature10-12,22,61,71-73,286 but also in the public media.186,240,287,288 
In addition, the focus of new LDL-lowering agents in development (such as PCSK9 
inhibitors) is shifting towards their use in patients classified as statin intolerant152,250 
in whom the reductions in LDL cholesterol would, in the absence of any background 
statin therapy, be larger (and, hence, their value might be perceived to be greater).  
It is worth noting that, whereas statins are now generic and low-cost, the newer 
agents are costly and there may be commercial pressures to create a market (with, 
  
59 
 
for example, the drafting of some reports about statin intolerance being funded by 
manufacturers of the new agents61,73,289). Of most relevance, however, claims that 
statin intolerance occurs in up to one-fifth of treated patients10-12 are not supported 
by the large-scale randomized evidence that exists: in particular, statin therapy has 
generally been found to be no less well tolerated than placebo. For example, there 
was no excess of discontinuations related to adverse events with statin therapy, and 
any excesses of muscle-related symptoms due to statin therapy occur in only about 
0.1-0.2% of patients during each year of treatment.52,150,236,237,243 
Public health consequences of misleading claims about the safety of statins 
There is a serious cost to public health of making misleading claims about the safety 
and efficacy of statin therapy.10,11,70,186,241,287,290,291 Following publication of reports of 
exaggerated side-effect rates,10-12,70 and related media coverage, the Picker Institute 
conducted in-depth interviews and focus groups with patients, general practitioners, 
and cardiologists, along with online surveys, in 2015.292 They found that the adverse 
media coverage was linked to increased reticence among the doctors to discuss and 
prescribe statins, and reduced compliance by the patients (including those with pre-
existing cardiovascular disease) due to raised awareness of perceived side-effects. 
There is already evidence that lipid-lowering therapy is substantially under-used by 
people at high risk of heart attacks and strokes. For example, in the Prospective 
Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study across 22 countries in 2016, 66% of 
individuals aged 35-70 years with cardiovascular disease were using statin therapy 
in high income countries (e.g. Sweden or Canada), but only 27% in upper middle-
income countries (e.g. Poland, Turkey or Brazil) and about 5% in lower income 
countries (e.g. China or India).293 Across mainland Europe, in the Study of Health 
  
60 
 
and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), 42% of individuals aged at least 50 years with 
prior cardiovascular disease were taking any form of lipid-lowering therapy in 2013, 
with large variations between different countries (e.g. 55-56% in Belgium, Denmark 
or Netherlands versus 27-29% in Estonia or Slovenia).294 There was also evidence 
of substantial levels of drug discontinuation, particularly among people who had not 
had recent cardiovascular events. In a cross-sectional study based on the Australian 
National Health Measures Survey in 2011-12, lipid-lowering therapy was being taken 
by 56% of people aged 45-74 years who had pre-existing cardiovascular disease 
and by 33% of those considered to have a “high” 5-year risk (>15%) of a primary 
cardiovascular event.295  Similarly, in the US Medical Expenditure Survey, statin 
therapy was being used in 2010 by 58% of people aged 30-79 years with coronary 
artery disease and by 52% of those aged over 40 years with diabetes.296 In the UK, 
analyses of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in 2014-15 indicated that statin 
therapy had been started by only about 60% of patients who had recently had a first 
cardiovascular event and by about 25% of patients in whom a 10 year cardiovascular 
risk ≥20% had been recorded by the General Practitioner within the past month.297 
A study in Denmark found that negative statin-related news stories were repeatedly 
followed by average proportional increases of about 10% in the likelihood of stopping 
statin therapy.298 An Australian television programme that was withdrawn after being 
broadcast because it misrepresented the evidence about statins 287,299 was followed 
during the subsequent year by a reduction in the numbers of prescriptions of statin 
therapy for patients at elevated risk of heart attacks and strokes.300 The researchers 
estimated that about 60,000 fewer Australians had statins dispensed than predicted 
from previous rates and that, if those patients continue to avoid statin therapy during 
the next 5 years, between 1,500 and 3,000 potentially fatal heart attacks and strokes 
  
61 
 
will occur that would otherwise have been avoided. Similarly following publication of 
claims that statins cause side-effects in about one-fifth of patients,10-12 analyses of 
prescription data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink indicate that there 
was a 12% proportional increase in patients stopping statin therapy for secondary 
and primary prevention (as well as reductions in the numbers of patients who had 
their cardiovascular risk assessed to determine their eligibility for statin therapy).301 
The researchers estimated that more than 200,000 UK patients had stopped taking 
their statin therapy and that (depending on what proportion resume treatment) this 
will result in between 2,000 and 6,000 cardiovascular events during the subsequent 
decade that would have been avoided.  
In such circumstances, much greater caution is warranted than has sometimes been 
the case when making claims about possible side-effects, since otherwise patients at 
high-risk of heart attacks, strokes and related deaths, and their doctors, may well be 
inappropriately dissuaded from using statin therapy despite the proven benefits .

Summary Panels  
Panel 1: Contribution of randomized trials for assessing treatment effects 
 Like-with-like patient comparisons: randomization results in groups of patients 
that differ from each other only by the play of chance with respect to their risks of 
suffering all types of health outcome, so observed differences in rates of health 
outcomes can generally be attributed causally to differences in study treatment 
 Like-with-like outcome comparisons: non-differential outcome ascertainment 
between the randomized treatment groups within a trial helps to minimise bias in 
the assessment of treatment effects. It can be enhanced by blinding, which is 
likely to be of most value for symptomatic adverse events that are subjective 
 Robustness for detecting effects: comparisons within randomized trials with 
unbiased ascertainment of outcomes between treatment groups are robust for 
the detection of both beneficial and harmful effects of treatment 
 Generalizability of evidence: randomized trials with different eligibility criteria 
that involve large numbers of many different types of patient (ideally combined in 
meta-analyses of individual patient data) can provide reliable information about 
treatment effects that can be widely generalized to different circumstances 
 
Panel 2: Contribution of observational studies for assessing treatment effects 
 Detect large effects on rare outcomes: exposure to treatment in large numbers 
of individuals in observational studies based on health care databases or on post-
marketing case reports allows large effects (adverse or beneficial) to be detected 
on outcomes that would otherwise not be expected to occur (i.e. are usually rare) 
 Assess effects of prolonged exposure: observational studies may involve data 
on prolonged exposure to a treatment that can allow long-term effects to emerge, 
although the available information about duration and dose may be importantly 
incomplete in available databases, limiting the inferences that can be drawn 
 Biases due to differences in risks: even when associations between treatment 
and health outcomes remain after statistical adjustment for observed differences 
between different groups of individuals, the associations may still reflect residual 
confounding due to differences that were assessed incompletely or not at all 
 Biases due to differences in ascertainment: patients treated in routine practice 
know they are taking a particular drug and, indeed, may be told it has side-effects 
and be monitored more closely. Consequently, any associations with a treatment 
in observational studies may be biased by differences in reporting and detection 
of health outcomes between patients who are taking it and those who are not. 
  
65 
 
 Generalizability of evidence: application of the proportional effects of treatment 
on specific outcomes derived from randomized trials to the absolute rates of the 
outcomes derived from observational studies in the population of interest can be 
used to yield generalizable estimates of its absolute benefits and harms  
 
Panel 3: Proven beneficial effects of statin therapy 
 Effective low-cost statin regimens (e.g. generic atorvastatin 40 mg daily costs 
about £2 per month) reduce LDL cholesterol by more than 50% (i.e. at least 2 
mmol/L in individuals with LDL cholesterol concentrations of 4 mmol/L or more) 
 Large-scale randomized evidence shows that each 1 mmol/L LDL-reduction with 
statin therapy produces a proportional reduction of about 25% in the rate of major 
vascular events (coronary deaths, myocardial infarctions, strokes and coronary 
revascularisations) during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. 
Consequently, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L reduces risk by about 45%  
 Lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L with an effective statin regimen for about 5 
years in 10,000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events in about 
1000 (10%) patients at high risk of heart attacks and strokes (e.g. “secondary 
prevention”) and 500 (5%) patients at lower-risk (e.g. “primary prevention”) 
 Despite reports based largely on non-randomized observational studies, there is 
not good evidence that statin therapy produces beneficial effects on other health 
outcomes (e.g. cancer, infections, respiratory disease, arrhythmias)  
 
Panel 4: Known adverse effects of statin therapy 
 The only adverse events that have been reliably shown to be caused by statin 
therapy are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large 
increases in creatine kinase blood levels) and new onset diabetes mellitus, along 
with a probable increase in strokes due to bleeding (i.e. haemorrhagic strokes) 
 Typically, treatment of 10,000 patients for 5 years with a standard statin regimen 
(such as atorvastatin 40mg daily) would be expected to cause about 5 cases of 
myopathy,  50-100 new cases of diabetes, and 5 haemorrhagic strokes 
 Despite reports based largely on non-randomized observational studies, there is 
not good evidence that statin therapy causes adverse effects on any other health 
outcomes – chiefly muscle pain and weakness – that prevent a large proportion 
of patients from continuing it long-term (so-called “statin intolerance”) 
 Large-scale randomized evidence rules out excesses of muscle pain and 
weakness with statin therapy of more than about 10-20 cases annually per 
  
66 
 
10,000 treated patients, with only about 1 of those cases being associated with 
large CK elevations (i.e. myopathy) and requiring statin discontinuation 
 Absolute excesses of adverse events that are caused by statin therapy are not 
more than about 100-200 (i.e. 1-2%) per 10,000 patients treated for 5 years, and 
it is unlikely that large adverse effects on serious adverse events await discovery. 
 The harmful effects of statin therapy can usually be reversed without any residual 
effects by stopping it, whereas the harmful effects of heart attacks or strokes that 
occur because statin therapy has not been used can be devastating

studies in other populations indicate this association continues at lower levels302,303).  
Figure 3: Proportional major vascular event reductions versus absolute LDL 
cholesterol reductions in randomized trials of routine statin therapy versus no 
routine statin use and of more intensive versus less intensive regimens 
Based on CTT meta-analyses.33 Proportional risk reductions are plotted against the 
average LDL-reduction at 1 year in meta-analyses of trials of routine statin therapy 
versus no routine statin therapy with average LDL reduction above and below 1.1 
mmol/L and of trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy with a further 0.5 
mmol/L LDL-reduction. These risk reductions relate to the average effects observed 
in these trials including the first year of study treatment (when the risk reduction is 
  
68 
 
smaller) and to the LDL-reductions achieved at 1 year (rather than the average LDL-
difference for the scheduled study treatment period), which may under-estimate the 
effects of actually taking statin therapy long-term (see Figure 4 and its legend). 
Figure 4: Proportional reductions in risks of major vascular events per mmol/L 
reduction in LDL cholesterol during each year of scheduled statin treatment  
Adapted from CTT collaborative meta-analyses.33 Symbols and conventions as in 
Figure 1. For each time period, RRs weighted by trial-specific LDL-reductions at 1 
year relate to participants at risk of a first post-randomization major vascular event 
during the time period in the meta-analysis of trials of routine statin therapy versus 
no routine statin therapy. Consequently, the overall RR of 0.76 for the period after 
the first year indicates that risk is reduced by about one quarter in each year that 
treatment continues (i.e. the absolute benefits increase with increasing duration of 
treatment). As non-compliance to the randomly assigned treatment increased with 
longer duration in the trials (in part due to study statin therapy being stopped, but 
more commonly due to statin therapy being started in the control group), the per 
mmol/L reductions based on LDL-reductions at 1 year are likely to under-estimate 
the reductions in MVE risk per mmol/L LDL-reduction later in these trials. 
Figure 5: Predicted absolute reductions in risks of major vascular events by 
lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy for 5 years (after the first year) in 
people at different levels of absolute risk 
Based on CTT collaborative meta-analyses.32 Lifetable estimates derived from major 
vascular event risks in respective categories and risk reductions (after the first year) 
per mmol/L LDL-reduction. The risk groups are equivalent to annual rates of major 
coronary events of 0.8%, 1.6%, 3.2% and 5.6% and vascular death of 0.3%, 1.0%, 
2.3% and 5.8%. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 
recommends that statin therapy is considered for those individuals without known 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) who have estimated 10-year risk of developing CVD 
(defined as myocardial infarction, CHD death, angina, stroke or transient ischemia) 
of at least 10%.159 This CVD event was not available in the CTT meta-analyses, so it 
  
69 
 
was estimated by multiplying observed vascular death rates within risk categories by 
3-4, yielding 10-year CVD risk of 9-12% and 30-40% for the lowest two groups.32

comparisons of the effects of treatment in randomized controlled trials 
* The numbers of participants in whom true events would not have occurred would 
be slightly different between the treatment groups, but this produces little imbalance 
in the numbers of false events that can be recorded among such patients in the two 
treatment groups when true events are relatively uncommon (as in this example). 
Consequently, false events have been approximately evenly distributed because 
they would not be affected by treatment assignment. By contrast, there would be 
fewer real outcomes to be missed in the active treatment group (since the treatment 
reduces the rate of the outcome), so the numbers of missed real outcome events are 
unevenly distributed between the treatment groups.

Shaded boxes indicate regimens that can produce about a halving or more in LDL 
cholesterol levels (largely irrespective of patient characteristics, including presenting 
levels of cholesterol). The 2016 cost for generic atorvastatin 40 mg daily in the UK is 
about £2 per 28 days of treatment;283 rosuvastatin 20 mg daily currently costs about 
£25 per month,304 but it became available as a generic in the USA during 2016.
