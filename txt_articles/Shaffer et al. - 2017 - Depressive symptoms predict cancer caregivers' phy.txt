BACKGROUND: Cancer caregiving has been associated with worsening health among caregivers themselves, yet demographic and
psychosocial predictors of their long-term health decline are less known. This study examines changes in caregivers’ physical health 2
to 8 years after their family members’ cancer diagnosis and prospective predictors of that change. METHODS: Caregivers (n 5 664;
mean age, 53.2 years) participated in a nationwide study at 2 (T1), 5 (T2), and 8 (T3) years after their family members’ cancer diagno-
sis. Physical health (12-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Scale) was assessed T1 through
T3 as outcome. Predictors were self-reported at T1, including caregiver demographics (age, sex, education, income, relationship to
patient, and employment status), patient cancer severity (from medical records), and caregiver psychosocial factors (caregiving
stress, caregiving esteem, social support, and depressive symptoms). Latent growth modeling tested predictors of caregivers’ initial
physical health and their physical health change across time. RESULTS: At T1, caregivers reported slightly better physical health than
the US population (M 5 51.22, P 5 .002), which declined over the following 6 years (Mslope 5 20.27, P < .001). All demographic fac-
tors, patient cancer severity, and T1 caregiving stress were related to caregivers’ initial physical health (P � .03). Higher depressive
symptoms were unrelated to caregivers’ initial physical health, but were the only significant predictor of caregivers’ more rapid physi-
cal health decline (B 5 20.02, P 5 .004). CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the unique contribution of caregivers’ depressive symp-
toms to their physical health decline. Assessing and addressing depressive symptoms among caregivers early in the cancer
survivorship trajectory may help to prevent premature health decline among this important yet vulnerable population. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Family caregivers fill a critical role in cancer patients’ treatment success, yet caregiving experience increases caregivers’ own
risk for long-term health decline.1-3 Psychosocial factors are known to play a significant role in caregivers’ physical health
decline,4,5 but prospective studies of these effects have had limited time frames. With caregivers at risk for premature dis-
ease development relative to non-caregivers,1,3,6 interventions targeting vulnerable caregivers and addressing factors aggra-
vating their physical health decline will be critical to reducing this health disparity. To inform this need, the current study
examines a set of risk factors, both relatively stable demographic and more readily modifiable psychosocial factors, as pre-
dictors of cancer caregivers’ physical health decline 2 to 8 years after their family members’ cancer diagnosis.
Physical health decline is aggravated by prolonged stress, as when caregiving demands exceed perceived resources.7,8
Several caregiver demographic factors have been linked to greater caregiving stress and risk for premature morbidity, such
as older age,2,6 female sex,2,6 less education,4,9 lower household income,6 and employment during caregiving.10 The care-
giver being the patient’s spouse6,9 and the patient having high disease severity10,11 are also associated with higher physical
health risk. Although the relations of these demographic and patient disease variables with caregivers’ health are well-
documented through the acute phase after the cancer diagnosis and during treatment, most studies have only examined
the first year after cancer diagnosis and treatment. Less is known about how these factors may identify caregivers at greatest
risk for longer-term physical health decline.
Caregivers’ subjective experiences through the cancer trajectory also affect their physical health. Caregivers who
report greater social support satisfaction12 and deriving self-esteem from caregiving4 exhibit more favorable physical health
outcomes. Caregivers’ psychological distress is also a powerful predictor of their physical health decline. Caregivers’ per-
ceived stress from the cancer experience has been found to relate to their physical health outcomes more strongly than
objective measures of caregiving burden.6,13 Depressive symptoms have also been shown to be strongly related to physical
morbidity among both healthy adults14,15 and caregivers specifically.9,12 Although limited in terms of the number of

 studies and maintenance of benefits, psychosocial inter-
ventions have helped improve these domains, suggesting
that these factors are modifiable.16,17
With cancer caregivers at risk for premature morbid-
ity, three recent Institute of Medicine/National Academy
of Medicine reports18-20 and a consensus statement from
the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of
Nursing Research21 have called for interventions to foster
caregivers’ health. A better understanding of the risk fac-
tors for caregivers’ long-term health decline is needed to
develop targeted assessment and intervention strategies
that use clinical resources effectively. To that end, this
prospective, observational study examined associations of
a set of risk factors with physical health in a national sam-
ple of cancer caregivers 2 to 8 years after their family
members’ cancer diagnosis. First, we examined the extent
to which caregivers’ physical health changed across this
period. Next, we tested the extent to which caregivers’
demographics, patient cancer severity, and psychosocial
factors related to initial levels of physical health at 2 years
post-diagnosis as well as their change in physical health
over time.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
Participants
The National Quality of Life Survey for Caregivers22 was
designed to longitudinally assess the impact of cancer on
the quality of life of family members and close friends
who provide care for cancer survivors. Survivors were
identified using multiple state cancer registries as having
been diagnosed with one of the 10 most common
cancers23 and were asked to nominate adult family or
family-like individuals who provided consistent assistance
during their cancer experience. Eligible caregivers were: 1)
18 years of age or older, 2) fluent in either English or
Spanish, and 3) a resident of the United States.
Caregivers (N 5 896) returned the baseline survey
at 2 years postdiagnosis (T1; data collected 2003-2004).
Follow-up data collection occurred at 5 years (T2; 2006-
2007)24 and 8 years (T3; 2009-2010) postdiagnosis.25
Caregivers were included in analyses (n 5 664) if they
provided complete data on all predictor variables at T1;
each of the 664 included caregivers provided complete
data for the physical health measure for at least 1 time
point (Fig. 1). Included caregivers differed from those
excluded (due to missing data on any predictor variable;
n 5 232) on the following predictor variables reported at
T1: excluded caregivers were older [M 5 58.69 excluded
vs 53.14 included; t(861) 5 25.47, P < .001; d 5 0.37]
and a greater proportion of the excluded sample reported
educational attainment at a high school diploma or less
[32.2% vs 23.0%; v2(1,875) 5 7.16, P 5 .01; / 5 0.09]
and being unemployed [35.9% vs 23.0%; v2(1884) 5
14.13, P < .001; / 5 0.13]. Compared with included
caregivers, those excluded also reported poorer physical
health at T1 [M 5 48.42 vs 51.24; t(830) 5 3.22, P 5
.001; d 5 0.22] and T2 [M 5 48.27 vs 50.51; t(458) 5
2.16, P 5 .03; d 5 0.20].
Procedure
This prospective, observational study complied with regu-
lations of the Emory University Institutional Review
Board. Nominated caregivers received a packet including

 an introduction letter, the survey, a self-addressed
stamped envelope, and compensation (prepaid calling
card at T1; $10 gift cards at T2, T3). Caregivers self-
reported all measures on paper. Informed consent was evi-
denced by returning the completed survey. For each time
point, 2 cycles of mailing and follow-up telephone calls
were made across the 8-week data collection period.
Measures
Caregiver physical health
At each time point, caregivers self-reported their levels of
physical health using the 12-item Medical Outcomes
Study Short Form Health Survey (MOS-SF-12).26 The
physical health component score represents a weighted
composite of physical functioning, physical limitations to
role requirements, bodily pain, and general health sub-
scales. Scores were normalized (US population normal-
ized M 5 50). Higher scores reflect better physical
health.26 This measure has been widely used to measure
physical health in studies of cancer caregivers.27-30
Demographic and patient cancer severity
predictors of caregiver physical health
Caregivers self-reported their age, sex, education, employ-
ment status, and household income at T1. Patients’ cancer
diagnosis date, stage, and type were obtained from the
state cancer registry at T1. The patient’s cancer severity
was based on mortality rates calculated from cancer type,
stage, and time since diagnosis.6,11 Higher scores reflect
greater severity of illness.
Psychosocial predictors of caregiver physical health
Caregivers self-reported the following measures at T1.
Caregiving stress. The extent to which caregivers felt
overwhelmed by providing care to their family member
was measured using the 4-item Stress Overload subscale
of the Pearlin Stress Scale.7 Response options ranged from
“Not at All” (1) to “Completely” (4). Higher mean scores
indicate greater subjective caregiving stress. This scale has
shown good internal consistency in previous cancer care-
giver samples (Cronbach’s a 5 0.79-0.80)31,32 and in the
current sample (Cronbach’s a 5 0.81).
Caregiver
esteem.
Caregivers’ self-esteem related to
providing care to their family member was assessed using
the 7-item Caregiver Esteem subscale of the Caregiving
Reaction Assessment.33 Response options ranged from
“Strongly Disagree” (1) to “Strongly Agree” (5). Higher
mean scores indicate greater caregiver esteem. This scale
has shown good internal consistency in previous cancer
caregiver samples (Cronbach’s a 5 0.82)4 and in the cur-
rent sample (Cronbach’s a 5 0.73).
Social support.
The extent to which caregivers per-
ceived that emotional, informational, and instrumental
support were available to them was measured using the 6-
item version of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation
List.34 Response options ranged from “Definitely False”
(1) to “Definitely True” (4). Higher mean scores indicate
greater perceived social support availability. This measure
has shown good internal consistency in dementia care-
giver samples (Cronbach’s a 5 0.79)35 and in the current
sample (Cronbach’s a 5 0.77).
Depressive
symptoms.
The extent to which family
caregivers experienced neurovegetative, affective, and
interpersonal symptoms associated with depression was
assessed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression (CES-D) scale.36 Response options
ranged from “Rarely or None of the Time” (0) to “Most
or All of the Time” (3). Higher total scores indicate
greater overall depressive symptomatology. This measure
has shown good internal consistency in cancer caregiver
samples (Cronbach’s a 5 0.87)4 and in the current sam-
ple (Cronbach’s a 5 0.93).
Analysis Plan
Descriptive information for study variables is presented in
Table 1. For all analyses, P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. The central aims of the study were ana-
lyzed using latent growth modeling (LGM) using a
structural equation modeling framework (Mplus 7).37
Missing physical health data were accounted for by full
information maximum likelihood estimation. Although
most unplanned “missingness” in psychosocial research is
at some level missing not at random, we sought to reduce
bias produced by this mechanism by including variables
associated with missingness in our models.38,39
First, a measurement model of the LGM estimating
caregivers’ physical health trajectory was tested. The
LGM estimated 2 latent parameters: initial level of health
(intercept) and change in health (slope) across the 3 assess-
ments.40-42 Linear change by year was estimated by fixing
loadings for the 3 physical health indicators to the inter-
cept latent variable to 1 and to the slope latent variable to
0, 3, and 6 for T1 through T3, respectively. To facilitate
interpretation, physical health scores were centered at 50
(ie, normalized mean for the US population), and contin-
uous predictor variables were centered to the sample
mean.

 Next, structural equation modeling was used to test
the relations of risk factors measured at T1 with care-
givers’ initial levels and change in physical health. For
both models, fitness was evaluated based on 4 model fit
indices: v2 P > .05, root mean square error of approxima-
tion (RMSEA) < 0.06, comparative fit index (CFI) >
0.95, and the standardized root mean square residual
(SRMR) < 0.08 indicating adequate model fit to the
data.43,44
RESULTS
Caregivers included in the current data analysis returned
surveys from 34 states. Specifically, 40% of caregivers
responded from the Northeast region, 39% from the
Midwest, 18% from the South, and 3% from the West.
Participating caregivers overall were middle-aged, primar-
ily women, and relatively well-educated and affluent
(Table 1). Most caregivers were the patient’s spouse and
were employed. Overall, caregivers reported that caregiv-
ing was “somewhat” stressful, yet boosted their self-
esteem, and that social support was “somewhat” available.
Caregivers’ average reported depressive symptoms fell
below the clinical cutoff of 1636 and were comparable to
those seen among other studies of cancer caregivers.4,45
As shown in Figure 1, missingness on the outcome
variable of physical health ranged from 2% at T1 to 52%
at T3, with 68% of the sample missing complete data for
the outcome variable for at least 1 time point. Correlates
of missingness were examined: there was no correlate of
missingness at T1 with any study variable (P > .06); com-
pared with those with missing data, caregivers with data
available at T2 and T3 were older by approximately 3
years and were 1.2 times more likely to be the patients’
spouse (P < .003), but there was no other correlate of
missingness (P > .05). Full information maximum likeli-
hood, standard to MPlus 7,37 incorporates data from cor-
relates of missingness included in the model to reduce bias
in estimates.
Caregivers’ Physical Health 2 to 8 Years
Postdiagnosis
First, the measurement model of the change in caregivers’
physical health over time (LGM) was tested for a model
fit. The measurement model fit the data: v2(1) 5 0.13, P
5 .71; RMSEA 5 0; CFI 5 1; SRMR 5 0.004. Care-
givers’ average initial level of physical health at 2 years
postdiagnosis was higher than the normalized mean for
the US population of 50 (M 5 1.22; 95% confidence
interval [CI] 5 0.46 to 1.98; P 5 .002), and this varied
between caregivers (s2 5 69.25; 95% CI 5 52.55 to
85.95; P 5 .002). On average, caregivers reported a
decline in their physical health by approximately one-
quarter point per year (M 5 20.27; 95% CI 5 20.41 to
20.12; P < .001). The resulting decrease of approxi-
mately 1.5 points over the 6 years of the study represents a
small effect (d 5 0.16).46 Caregivers did not vary signifi-
cantly in their rate of physical health decline (s2 5 0.36;
95% CI 5 20.53 to 1.26; P 5 .43). Caregivers’ initial
level of physical health was unrelated to their rate of

 change in physical health (unstandardized estimate 5
21.63; 95% CI 5 24.93 to 1.68; P 5 .34).
Predicting Caregivers’ Physical Health
Next, the fit of the structural equation model predicting
caregivers’ initial level and change in physical health by
risk factors was tested (Fig. 2). The specified model fit the
data according to 3 model fit indices: RMSEA 5 0.04;
CFI 5 0.99; SRMR 5 0.08; yet the v2 index indicated
suboptimal fit [v2(12) 5 24.25, P 5 .02]. Because this
index is sensitive to large sample size and the current
model drew from 664 participants, the model was
accepted based on adequate fit to the alternative fit indi-
ces. Path estimates are shown in Table 2; model identifica-
tion and significant paths are shown in Figure 2.
Predicting Initial Level of Physical Health
Several factors related to caregivers’ initial level of physical
health 2 years postdiagnosis. Among the demographic
factors and patient cancer severity, caregivers who were
older, were men, were not the caregivers’ spouse, were
unemployed, had a high school education or less, had a
household income under $40,000 per year, and provided
care to a patient with a better cancer prognosis reported
poorer initial physical health. Regarding psychosocial fac-
tors, only higher subjective caregiving stress was concur-
rently related to lower caregiver initial health.
Predicting Change in Physical Health
Regarding change in caregivers’ physical health 2 to 8 years
after the diagnosis, only caregivers’ depressive symp-
toms was a significant predictor. Caregivers who reported
higher depressive symptoms 2 years postdiagnosis showed
more rapid physical health decline over the subsequent 6
years. No other factors predicted caregivers’ change in
physical health. With all other factors held constant at the
sample mean, a caregiver who reported high depressive
symptoms (ie, CES-D score 0.5 SD above average) would
be expected to show physical health decline at twice the
rate of a caregiver with an average level of depressive
symptoms (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
This study documents the longest prospective examina-
tion of the effects of demographic, patient cancer severity,
and psychosocial factors on cancer caregivers’ physical
health to date. Caregivers’ physical health at 2 years post-
diagnosis was slightly higher than the national mean;
however, that advantage dissipated over the 6 years that
followed, as caregivers experienced a small yet reliable
decline in self-reported health. Among a comprehensive
set of potential risk factors, only caregivers’ depressive
symptoms prospectively predicted their physical health
decline from 2 to 8 years postdiagnosis.
Caregivers’ physical health started somewhat higher
and declined less rapidly than documented in previous
studies using the SF-12 with cancer caregivers during the

 patients’ active treatment phase.47,48 This may reflect
both improved sense of physical health after the acute
diagnosis and treatment phase, as well as the fact that
larger population-based studies of caregivers tend to show
better physical health outcomes relative to samples from
smaller and interventional studies.49 At 2 years after the
patients’ cancer diagnosis, caregivers’ initial health was
associated primarily with the relatively fixed demographic
factors and patients’ cancer severity. Our findings that
caregivers who were older and of lower socioeconomic sta-
tus reported poorer physical health at T1 are consistent
with the literature.2,4,6,9
Several other findings of ours are inconsistent with
the literature. For example, caregivers who were men,
were not the patients’ spouse, and had better patient prog-
nosis also reported poorer physical health at T1.6,10,11
These descrepant effects were small, which fits with find-
ings from a meta-analytic study showing that, when care-
giver characteristics are associated with their own self-
reported physical health, effect sizes were typically mini-
mal.9 In contrast with the demographic risk factors, all of
which were related to initial physical health, caregivers’
perceived stressfulness of the cancer experience was the
only psychosocial risk factor concurrently related to care-
givers’ physical health. Caregiving responsibilities can be
complicated by the caregiver being in poor physical condi-
tion, suggesting that caregivers’ own physical health may
represent an important contextual characteristic relevant
to the perceived stress of caregiving.50
Perhaps most striking, T1 depressive symptoms—
although not concurrently related with physical health—
were the only predictor of caregivers’ physical health
decline, affirming that caregivers’ early depressive symp-
toms have downstream effects on their physical health as
long as 6 years later. Our findings are consistent with with
the literature demonstrating that caregiver demographic
characteristics have been more consistently associated
with caregivers’ concurrent physical health reports,
whereas psychosocial variables have predicted caregivers’
longer-term physical health changes.6,9 The 1.28-point
predicted difference between the caregiver with high ver-
sus low depressive symptoms 8 years postdiagnosis (Fig.
3), at the population level, translates roughly to 6% higher
total health care expenditures, 9% higher rate of inpatient
hospitalizations, and 5% higher rate of outpatient hospital
visits for the caregiver with a greater number of symp-
toms.51 Adverse effects of depression on physical health
have been well-documented in the general popula-
tion.9,14,15 These findings extend evidence to the cancer
caregiving context, known to have many psychosocial

 stressors and challenges, and highlight the importance of
depression specifically to caregivers’ premature physical
health decline.
Depressive symptoms are common among cancer
caregivers.52,53 Implementing caregiver depression screen-
ing and increasing caregivers’ access to effective depression
treatments may mitigate the premature physical health
decline endemic to cancer caregiving. To date, caregiver
distress screening implementation has been limited, yet
could be more widely adopted by capitalizing on current
efforts to implement routine patient distress screening.54-
56 Successful examples of caregiver mental health assess-
ment and referral systems built from patient distress
screening models exist, with technology-based assessment
using brief and straightforward questions to assess
whether a caregiver has been experiencing depression or
low mood.57,58
To improve health outcomes, screening must
link caregivers who report high depressive symptoms
with timely, effective interventions. Existing psychosocial
interventions with caregivers have shown limited effect on
caregiver depressive symptoms.59 Developing and refin-
ing interventions to successfully address caregivers’
depressive symptoms during the acute cancer phase must
be a research priority, not only to improve caregivers’
quality of life, but also to address the notable health dis-
parities between adults with versus without caregiving
experience. To address this double aim, interventions
with caregivers may seek to emphasize strategies shown to
improve both mental and physical health, such as relaxa-
tion, meditation, and exercise.60
The limitations of this study restrict the generaliz-
ability of the findings. The study sample was primarily
non-Hispanic white and well-educated. Moreover, care-
givers included in the analyses were younger, healthier,
and of higher socioeconomic status than those excluded,
and younger and nonspousal caregivers were more likely
to have missing data at follow-up, although all of the dif-
ferences were small. An analysis of the long-term physical
health sequelae of caregiving should be conducted among
caregivers of other ethnic groups and those with fewer
socioeconomic
resources,
because
health
disparities
known to exist among these groups are likely amplified by
the additive stress from caregiving. Finally, variables were
self-reported and possibly biased by social desirability,
and the SF-12 represents a very general measure of physi-
cal health quality of life. Future study of caregivers’ health
may seek to replicate findings with more specific, objec-
tive markers of health. Assessing biomarkers, such as
genome expression,61 proinflammatory cytokines,3,12 and
telomerase activity,62 will improve our understanding of
biological mechanisms by which caregivers’ health is
affected by the caregiving experience.
This study provides novel information regarding
cancer caregivers’ long-term physical health decline, with
the longest follow-up to date of caregivers’ physical health
following providing care to a loved one with cancer. Nota-
bly, only caregivers’ higher depressive symptoms pre-
dicted their accelerated physical health decline from 2 to
8 years following the patients’ diagnosis. Providing effec-
tive, targeted, and timely psychosocial care for cancer care-
givers around the time of their relative’s diagnosis and
treatment may help to prevent premature health decline
among this important yet vulnerable population.
