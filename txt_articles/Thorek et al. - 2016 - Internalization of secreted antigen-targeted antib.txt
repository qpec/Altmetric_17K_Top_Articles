Abstract
Targeting the androgen receptor (AR) pathway prolongs survival in patients with prostate cancer, 
but resistance rapidly develops. Understanding this resistance is confounded by a lack of 
noninvasive means to assess AR activity in vivo. We report intracellular accumulation of a secreted 
antigen-targeted antibody (SATA) that can be used to characterize disease, guide therapy, and 
monitor response. AR-regulated human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (free hK2) is a prostate 
tissue-specific antigen produced in prostate cancer and androgen-stimulated breast cancer cells. 
Fluorescent and radio conjugates of 11B6, an antibody targeting free hK2, are internalized and 
noninvasively report AR pathway activity in metastatic and genetically engineered models of 
cancer development and treatment. Uptake is mediated by a mechanism involving the neonatal Fc 
receptor. Humanized 11B6, which has undergone toxicological tests in nonhuman primates, has 
the potential to improve patient management in these cancers. Furthermore, cell-specific SATA 
uptake may have a broader use for molecularly guided diagnosis and therapy in other cancers.
INTRODUCTION
Activation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis contributes to prostate cancer (PCa) 
progression throughout the entire course of the disease, including the terminal castration-
resistant state (1). After initial response to inhibition with androgen deprivation treatment, 
which is a mainstay of PCa treatment, AR pathway reactivation inevitably occurs. This has 
been attributed to gene amplification (2), intratumoral androgen synthesis (3), constitutively 
active variants, and other mechanisms (2, 4). AR is also differentially expressed in several 
breast cancer (BCa) subtypes, although without a clearly defined role (5, 6). One subtype is 
aggressive triple-negative BCa (TNBC) in which emerging studies suggest that AR 
expression may be correlated with decreased survival (7). Recent trials have focused on AR 
inhibition as an approach to stabilize TNBC (8, 9) for which there are no targeted treatment 
options. Thus, quantifying lesion-specific AR pathway activity represents a critical unmet 
need: that it would assist in treatment selection and serve as a pharmacodynamic marker of 
pathway inhibition and as a non-invasive marker of therapeutic efficacy. Although the 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is a commonly used biomarker of PCa, is AR-
dependent, PSA concentrations in the blood are also affected by the degree of tumor

 differentiation, physiological factors, and total tumor burden, making PSA unsuitable as a 
measure of pathway activation.
The approach of treating disease with drugs that bind to secreted antigens (for example, 
antibodies directed to growth factors) is a firmly established strategy in clinical practice. 
Targets of such biologics include vascular endothelial growth factor (10,11), receptor 
activator of nuclear factor κB (12), and tissue necrosis factor (13). However, imaging agents 
or drug conjugates directed to secreted antigens have been far less successful because 
antibody-bound complexes wash out of the disease site (14,15). This has limited targets for 
PCa to cell-surface receptors, which usually have poor tissue- or disease-restricted 
expression (fig. S1, A to C), as indicated from the integrated in silico transcriptomics 
database (MediSapiens).
Here, we report an approach using an antibody (11B6) directed to an epitope accessible only 
on the free, catalytically active form of human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2). When 
11B6 is bound to active hK2, this complex is permanently internalized and transported to 
lysosomal compartments. hK2 is a trypsin-like enzyme with AR-driven expression specific 
to prostate, PCa, and AR-positive BCa tissues. hK2 is activated by TMPRSS2 and secreted 
into the ducts of the prostate where it initiates a cascade to cleave semenogelin, which is the 
extracellular matrix in the ejaculate, to enhance sperm motility (16). hK2 in man is 
exclusively expressed in prostatic tissues (fig. S1D). As with PSA, retrograde release of 
catalytically inactive hK2 into the blood occurs when the highly structured organization of 
the prostate is compromised upon hypertrophy or malignant transformation. Despite the 
homology similarity between the kallikreins, 11B6 is specific for hK2 and does not bind 
PSA (17).
The observed 11B6 uptake in free hK2-producing cancer cells is a process facilitated by the 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). This feature is recapitulated in AR-positive BCa models treated 
by hormones that stimulate hK2 production, demonstrating that 11B6 has the ability to 
profile and monitor AR activity in two commonly diagnosed cancers, PCa and some types of 
BCa. In these analyses, we have applied 11B6 for both positron emission tomography (PET) 
and fluorescence imaging in xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) 
for disease detection to (i) quantitatively assess AR pathway activity, (ii) determine 
pharmacodynamic parameters, (iii) evaluate treatment efficacy in immunocompetent models, 
and (iv) guide treatment in clinically relevant scenarios.
Already adapted for near-term clinical translation, 11B6 immunoimaging resolves issues at 
key clinical decision points for both PCa and BCa patients to improve management. We also 
show that the FcRn-mediated uptake mechanism can be used to facilitate uptake by other 
secreted antigen-targeted antibodies (SATA).

Correlation of anti-hK2 imaging with hK2 expression

 PET (immunoPET) to visualize expression noninvasively. Conjugation to desferrioxamine B 
(DFO) and subsequent zirconium-89 labeling yielded 89Zr-11B6, a PET radiotracer. A 
competition binding assay was conducted, revealing that bioconjugation of 11B6 resulted in 
no significant loss of affinity for hK2 (fig. S2 and tables S1 to S3). In vitro studies 
of 89Zr-11B6 uptake showed expression-specific uptake, and specificity was verified by 
blocking with excess 11B6. Activity after washing revealed that this SATA was internalized 
by hK2-expressing cells.
To test whether the uptake occurred in vivo, we first optimized the dose of 89Zr-11B6 with 
an escalation study and PET quantification in mice bearing human PCa xenografts (Fig. 1, A 
to C). The time to tumor saturation inversely correlated with tracer mass and improved 
tumor/blood contrast: 2.4, 4.2, 7.7, and 13.7 hours for 300, 150, 50, and 15 μg of 89Zr-11B6, 
respectively. Subsequent experiments used 50 μg of89Zr-11B6, which achieved a plateau in 
tumor uptake (saturation) with low background activity after 120 hours (Fig. 1C). Uptake 
was correlated to hK2 protein expression (fig. S3A), and in vivo specificity was verified by 
blocking with 1 mg of unlabeled 11B6 and using hK2-negative DU145 xenografts (table 
S4). To assess the potential for imaging of patients who have failed hormone therapy, we 
also measured the uptake in castration-resistant 22Rv1 tumor xenografts. Here, we also 
observed robust localization to the tumor through continued AR-driven hK2 expression (fig. 
S3B).
KLK2 expression was evaluated in seven xenograft lines (fig. S4A). VCaP exhibited the 
highest KLK2 expression and showed markedly higher 89Zr-11B6 internalization [80.7 
percent injected activity per gram (%IA/g)] compared to LNCaP (24.7 %IA/g) (Fig. 1D), 
demonstrating the ability to determine hK2 expression status in vivo. The expression of 
KLK2 did not correlate with two other AR-governed imaging targets, KLK3 (PSA) or 
FOLH1 (prostate-specific membrane antigen), confirming that hK2 is a distinct biomarker 
(fig. S4).
Although the PSA concentration in blood is AR-dependent, the value is a function of degree 
of tumor differentiation, location, and total tumor burden, making it unsuitable as a measure 
of pathway activation. Direct imaging of AR abundance and measurement of receptor 
occupancy have previously been achieved using 18F-FDHT (16β-[18F] fluoro-5α-
dihydrotestosterone) [a radiolabeled analog of the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (18, 
19)]. However, the uptake of this agent does not correlate with PSA decline or response, 
both of which are fundamentally tied to AR pathway activity and not simply to the amount 
of receptor. In the VCaP PCa model, the rapid metabolism (20) and abdominal clearance of 
the agent (fig. S5) result in limited contrast of the tumor to the background structures.
Delineating bone metastases
Both PCa and BCa commonly metastasize to the skeleton, often manifesting a mixed bone-
forming/resorbing phenotype that complicates detection because current clinical imaging 
methods rely on the uptake at sites with increased osteoblastic activity (21, 22). We 
evaluated the ability of 89Zr-11B6 to detect both phenotypes using intraosseous LNCaP-AR 
(osteolytic) and VCaP (osteoblastic) bone metastases models with control PC3 (AR/hK2-
negative osteolytic) bone lesions (Fig. 2). 89Zr-11B6 PET demonstrated robust delineation in

 both osteometastatic phenotypes of AR-positive disease, with the uptake delayed relative to 
subcutaneously inoculated tumors (fig. S6).
Faithful recapitulation of PCa for study in mice is particularly difficult given the absence of 
murine orthologs of several human prostate-specific genes, including prostate kallikreins 
(16). To test tracer kinetics in an immunocompetent milieu and measure the uptake in 
autochthonous mouse tumors, we cloned a prostate full-length KLK2 construct encoding 
pre-pro-hK2 under the control of the probasin promoter (Pb_KLK2), enabling prostate-
specific and androgen-driven expression of hK2. Using B6 mice as negative 
controls, 89Zr-11B6 uptake was specific to hK2-positive prostatic tissue in vivo (fig. S7).
Internalization of 11B6 by FcRn
To investigate SATA internalization, we first evaluated conjugated 11B6 in whole-mount 
sections of prostate tissue from Pb_KLK2 mice. A high concordance between intravenously 
administered fluorescent and radioactive tracer was observed, as was an association between 
antibody uptake and staining for AR (Fig. 3, A to E). 11B6 in the lumen of prostatic ducts 
suggested uptake by epithelial cells, as confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3B and 
video S1). To verify, we analyzed single cells extracted from this tissue for fluorescent 
antibody uptake. In addition, we performed analysis of PCa cell lines in vitro (fig. S8).
FcRn generally facilitates antigen recognition in luminal structures throughout the body (23) 
and is expressed in a large set of PCa lines (fig. S9). Intracellular transport of the conjugate 
was determined by costaining PCa cells for FcRn and anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG). After 
pulsed exposure, 11B6 was associated with FcRn during the early phase of uptake. At later 
time points, 11B6 appeared intracellularly, and FcRn had returned to the cell membrane. The 
11B6-hK2 complex was shuttled from physiological pH early endosomes to acidic late 
endosomes, as shown using a pH-responsive dye conjugated to 11B6 and imaged in live 
cells (Fig. 3, F and G).
To confirm the specific role of FcRn in the internalization of the SATA-antigen complex, we 
generated recombinant mutant 11B6 IgG1 (modified at His435 to Ala; H435A-11B6) to 
abrogate FcRn binding (24) and compared the cellular uptake in physiological and acidified 
medium (25). This mutation abrogates FcRn binding but does not affect variable region 
recognition or affinity. As expected, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) affinity of FcRn for 
11B6 was pH-dependent and absent in the H435A-11B6 mutant (fig. S10A). In culture, 
incubation at acidic pH conditions, as found in tumors and the prostate (26), augmented 
internalization (fig. S10B). The presence of both FcRn and hK2 was required for 
internalization, and isotype-matched control antibody did not bind cells or transport 
intracellularly through endosomes (fig. S11).
89Zr-labeled 11B6 and mutant Fc antibody were applied to establish FcRn dependence in 
vivo. Uptake of the mutant Fc antibody matched that of control nonspecific IgG (shown for 
LNCaP; fig. S12, A and B), despite retained immunoreactivity of the FcRn binding-deficient 
antibody (fig. S12C). Relative to the wild-type 11B6 antibody, H435A-11B6 uptake in 
immunodeficient xenograft models was significantly lower [21.2 % IA/g for VCaP (P = 5.97 
× 10−5) and 5.23 %IA/g for LNCaP (P = 8.24×10−7); fig. S12D]. Antibody function and

 pharmacokinetics are dependent on host interactions. Therefore, we also assessed the uptake 
in immunocompetent GEMM of adenocarcinoma [obtained by crossing Pb_KLK2 with 
ARR2/probasin-Myc (Hi-Myc)(27)]. As expected, we observed an accumulation of 11B6 in 
the transformed lobe of the prostate. In contrast, the uptake of FcRn binding-deficient 
H435A-11B6 was abolished (fig. S12, E and F).
FcRn is widely expressed in tissues throughout the body and particularly concentrated in the 
liver (28). Antibody imaging in this organ is difficult because nonspecific uptake and 
clearance increase the background. To rigorously evaluate the 89Zr-11B6 agent, we sought to 
test whether metastasis of PCa to the liver could be identified because this is an end-stage 
site of disseminated PCa. 89Zr-11B6 PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed 
specific focal accumulation in hK2-expressing LREX′ metastases in the liver that were 
resistant to enzalutamide, a second-generation AR antagonist (fig. S13). Autoradiography 
and histopathological findings correlated with the noninvasive assessment.
We also tested whether the uptake of antibody-secreted antigen complexes could be applied 
to other targets. Previously, we have shown that targeting free PSA with an antibody (5A10) 
can delineate subcutaneous xenografts. The uptake was transient because the SATA-antigen 
complex was not internalized and washed out of the tumor microenvironment (15). 
Previously identified residues at the constant heavy chain 2 and 3 (CH2/CH3) junction 
contribute to the pH-dependent affinity of the IgG interaction with FcRn, suggesting 
multiple possible explanations for the inability of 5A10 to bind FcRn. We grafted the 
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of 5A10 onto the 11B6 Fc scaffold (bearing 
the His435;5A10H435-wt) (29). In vivo, we observed steadily increasing tumor uptake 
using 89Zr-5A10H435-wt in LNCaP xenografts in contrast to the original PSA-targeting 5A10 
(fig. S14).
Anti-hK2 uptake in BCa
KLK2 expression is restricted to the prostate and PCa tissues in man; however, hK2 and 
PSA are also detectable in (female) BCa cell lines (30) and primary patient samples, 
including serum and nipple aspirate fluid, after appropriate activation of the AR pathway by 
steroid hormones (31, 32). We investigated whether FcRn-mediated internalization of the 
antibody-bound hK2 is prostate-specific. In the presence of DHT, a subset of AR-positive 
BCa lines secretes hK2, including the TNBC line MFM-223 (fig. S15, A and B, and table 
S5). Androgen stimulation increased the AR-responsive KLK2 (fig. S15, C and D).
To assess whether 11B6 could be internalized in a non-prostate-derived cancer model, we 
used 89Zr-11B6 to image AR-positive BCa with BT474 (ER+/PR+/HER2+/AR+) 
xenografts. 89Zr-11B6 uptake was significantly greater in DHT-treated female mice 
compared to estrogen alone (P = 0.001; fig. S15E). As above, confocal microscopy revealed 
that BT474 cells with and without DHT treatment internalize 11B6 in a time-dependent 
manner (fig. S16).
Staging adenocarcinoma and monitoring treatment
We next applied 89Zr-11B6 PET to detect and monitor tumor progression in the prostate of 
transgenic models of adenocarcinoma (Fig. 4). Greater SATA uptake at sites of disease was

 noted, demonstrating heterogeneous progression even at the small scale of the mouse 
prostate. Quantitation of tracer accumulation in the prostate corresponded with 
transformation from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to adenocarcinoma. Ex vivo 
autoradiography of tracer microdistribution and histological adenocarcinoma is shown for a 
50-week-old mouse (fig. S17).
Use of the anti-hK2 tracer to assess AR activity in response to intervention was studied in 
three clinical scenarios that currently lack (but would greatly benefit from) a molecularly 
specific assessment. In the first substudy, 89Zr-11B6 was measured before and after surgical 
castration in a bone metastasis model using LNCaP-AR/luc (expressing luciferase under the 
control of ARR2-Pb). Standard-of-care blood measurements of PSA and 18F-sodium 
fluoride (18F-NaF) PET bone scans were compared to hK2-targeted PET 
imaging. 89Zr-11B6 uptake decreased after castration (P = 0.005; Fig. 5, A and B, and table 
S6), as did AR-driven luciferase (P = 0.0012; Fig. 5C). Conventional metrics of PCa bone 
lesion response, including PSA (Fig. 5D) and 18F-NaF (Fig. 5, E and F, and table S6), 
remained unchanged.
The second scenario simulated intermittent androgen deprivation therapy. There is 
considerable debate concerning the optimal treatment regimen (intermittent or continuous 
inhibition) for hormonal therapy (33). Pb_KLK2 × Hi-Myc mice received depot injections 
of degarelix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, ablating androgen 
production for 2 months. 89Zr-11B6 imaging was performed longitudinally to assess the 
response to androgen deprivation and reactivation after discontinuation. 89Zr-11B6 
decreased after castration but reemerged at the end of the treatment period, enabling readout 
of pharmacodynamic inhibition of the AR pathway (fig. S18).
Our final clinical simulation involved noninvasive imaging of the impact of different degrees 
of inhibition on AR activity in the tumor (intratumoral) and prostate itself (intraprostatic). 
We initially monitored progression of disease in 14 Pb_KLK2 ×Hi-Myc mice 
using 89Zr-11B6 PET. Thereafter, mice were randomized into three treatment groups: 
vehicle (n = 4), castration (n = 6), or castration plus enzalutamide (n =4). We noted 
substantial heterogeneity in the individual animals’ prostatic uptake of the tracer during 
progression and in response to therapy (Fig.6, A to C).
SATA uptake was repressed during the last months of treatment in mice receiving adjuvant 
AR blockade, indicating a benefit for adjuvant AR blockade using antiandrogens in the 
postcastration setting (Fig. 6, D and E). As suspected, reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of prostatic tissue harvested from treated mice displayed 
significantly lower KLK2 expression (P = 0.0016 for castrate alone and P = 0.0089 for 
castration and enzalutamide; fig. S19A). Expression differences with and without adjuvant 
therapy were small, as were the differences between the lobes of the prostate containing 
focal sites of uptake and those that were negative (fig. S19B). This is likely because RT-PCR 
reflects an average of the expression based on the whole lobe. However, immunopathology 
for regions with and without the 89Zr-11B6 signal reveals subregions that continue to 
proliferate after treatment (fig. S20). Furthermore, the hK2 concentration in prostatic tissue

 lysate indicated a strong positive correlation between 89Zr-11B6 uptake and AR-dependent 
hK2 production (fig. S21).
Directing treatment in real-time
Radiolabeled and fluorescently labeled tracers indicated highly specific uptake in the cells of 
the prostate for noninvasive assessment (Fig. 3). To demonstrate the value of 11B6 imaging 
prostatic expression in the translational setting, we simulated the full treatment course 
encompassing pre-, intra-, and postoperative clinical decision points using dual-labeled 89Zr-
DFO and Cy5.5 for PET and fluorescence imaging. We explored this concept using the 
Pb_KLK2 ×Hi-Myc model.
PET was performed to assess disease burden (Fig. 7A), which was then resected using a 
fluorescent surgical stereoscope for real-time guidance (Fig. 7, B to G). Remnant prostatic 
tissue was harvested to confirm margins, and excised tissues were scanned for fluorescent 
and radio signals and hK2 protein (Fig. 7, H to J). After removing fluorescent tissues, the 
peritoneum and skin were sutured, and postoperative PET was acquired (Fig. 7K). A region 
of tracer accumulation could be identified by postoperative PET/CT imaging and was 
subsequently removed at autopsy. This was confirmed to be prostate tissue with fluorescence 
microscopy, autoradiography, and histochemistry (Fig. 7, L to N).
Humanized 11B6 and nonhuman primate toxicity
For intended use in humans, rodent CDRs were grafted into a human immunoglobulin 
framework to yield humanized 11B6 (hu11B6), without adverse effects on binding affinity 
or specificity. SPR-determined dissociation and association rate constants for all versions of 
11B6 were calculated to be 10−5 (koff) and 105 M−1 s−1 (kon), respectively. No statistical 
difference in the apparent affinity was observed between hu11B6 and its DFO conjugate 
(fig. S2 and tables S1 to S3).
The kinetics and accumulation of the humanized conjugate 89Zr-hu11B6 were not 
significantly different from the mouse IgG1 version of 11B6 (fig. S22). Because 
humanization did not degrade affinity for the target or negate internalization of the immune 
complex, we proceeded to perform nonhuman primate testing. Male cynomolgus monkeys 
express hK2 detectable by 11B6, and therefore, we evaluated two of the monkeys in a dose-
escalation study (weekly doses of 11B6, from 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, or 12.0 mg/kg). Body weight, 
hematology (blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit), and serum chemistry 
(bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, glucose phosphorus, and 11B6 concentration) were 
evaluated before the study and biweekly throughout. No mortality, behavioral changes, or 
toxicologically meaningful changes were observed (fig. S23). Finally, to assess the capacity 
to bind hK2 in human tissues, we applied 11B6 to human tissue specimens. The hK2 
distribution in normal prostate, prostate adenocarcinoma, and a bone lesion can be identified 
by 11B6 immunodetection (fig. S24).

 and proteins are important mediators of these diseases, and they have been widely targeted 
with antibodies to combat disease or ameliorate its symptoms. However, biologics directed 
to these extracellular components have not enabled cellular targeting for imaging or 
treatment, limiting the ability to affect diseased cells themselves. Here, we demonstrate that 
an anti-hK2 antibody, 11B6, enables cell-specific accumulation in two common cancers for 
characterization, monitoring, and guidance.
Uptake of 11B6 in hK2-expressing tissues was FcRn-mediated, which is a demonstration of 
antibody-antigen internalization by cells in which they express the target. FcRn enables 
passive transfer of IgG from mother to offspring in the early stages of life and in a variety of 
physiologic functions in adult immunity. FcRn facilitates transport of IgG1 and recycling of 
IgG immune complexes across otherwise impermeable polarized epithelia (23).11B6 
exploits this mechanism, resulting in cellular accumulation of an immune complex, which 
avoids the precipitous washout observed using a previous kallikrein-targeted construct (15, 
34). We demonstrate the wider applicability of this approach to enable cell-specific 
accumulation of a second SATA to PSA (5A10H435-wt). FcRn binding is pH-dependent; the 
lower pH at sites of disease may provide an even more favorable microenvironment to 
generate imaging contrast compared to nonmalignant tissue. These results could be of 
importance for both PCa- and BCa-directed imaging and therapy and perhaps more widely 
as a strategy to improve both the magnitude and localization of internalizing SATA.
hK2 has traditionally been evaluated as a prostate biomarker; however, we have shown the 
uptake of 89Zr-11B6 in AR-positive BCa xenografts under hormone stimulation. Questions 
surround the repercussions of AR status in BCa. Although several studies indicate a role for 
AR in pathways that negatively affect survival (35, 36), a correlation between AR and 
positive prognostic markers has also been identified (37, 38). The application of androgen 
antagonists in AR-positive BCa indicates that AR inhibition may be best directed toward 
basal (triple-negative) rather than luminal B-type/HER2 refractory subtypes (8, 35). Early 
trials suggest that this may represent a new approach to treat TNBC (8, 9). The 11B6 
platform enables further study of the nuanced role of AR in the biology of BCa by offering 
the ability to guide and monitor treatment.
Here, we used several treatment methods in a range of models, aiming to eliminate long-
standing impediments to noninvasive monitoring of disease biology and to assist 
development of AR-targeted therapies as a pharmacodynamic tool. In PCa and BCa disease 
assessment, biopsy is used to provide a direct readout of tissue organization but is restricted 
in time, access, and accuracy. The use of conventional imaging (ultrasound, CT, and MRI) to 
guide biopsy suffers from modest sensitivities for detection and staging (39, 40), with 
complication risks (41). If lesions are detectable, a direct biopsy can provide information on 
cellular processes but is invasive, costly, and difficult to repeat.
In contrast, 89Zr-11B6 PET provides whole-body imaging of disease foci and a readout of 
AR activity for both primary and metastatic lesions. In a transgenic c-Myc-driven model of 
adenocarcinoma, we longitudinally evaluated AR activity during disease progression from 
the premalignant prostate through high disease burden. One limitation of the study of 11B6 
in immunocompetent mice was the use of a single hK2-expressing disease-prone model.

 Other PCa and BCa GEMM should be studied to assess the broad impact of the SATA 
approach. When this imaging platform was extended to evaluate treatment regimens, it 
revealed low levels of AR pathway reactivation at suborgan resolution and enabled a 
comparison between models of surgical castration and castration plus adjuvant therapy. The 
agent may also be used to guide treatment in real time or assist in treatment delivery (42, 
43). 89Zr-11B6 targets tumorous lesions themselves, rather than sites of remodeling, and is 
able to identify both osteoblastic and osteoclastic metastases. Conventional 18F-NaF bone 
scans have high sensitivity but lack specificity for disease, confounding readout of burden 
especially after therapy. The enhanced precision of treatment monitoring by SATA will help 
to accelerate preclinical and translational research toward answering persistent questions for 
optimal patient care.
The technology presented here has direct application in both PCa and BCa patients. The 
humanized 11B6, which retains binding characteristics of the original agent and did not 
show adverse toxicological effects in nonhuman primates, is ready for clinical translation. 
Successful translation will have a broad and significant impact on individualized patient 
stratification and management at the molecular level. The approach to designing SATA that 
facilitates cellular uptake may be broadly relevant to detect, monitor, and treat a wide variety 
of diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The purpose of this study was to investigate the capacity of an antibody targeting the 
catalytically active site of a prostate-specific protease (in man) to delineate and guide 
treatment of primary and metastatic PCa and BCa. Binding properties and cellular 
interaction were evaluated in vitro and in vivo using fluorescent and radio conjugates. The 
internalization of this antibody, through the FcRn, after interaction with its secreted targeted 
antigen, was studied in detail. The same evaluation was also performed with a second 
antibody targeting another secreted antigen. Appending the positron-emitting zirconium-89 
to the antibody for immunoPET was studied in subcutaneous, osseous, and hepatic 
metastatic models and in genetically engineered autochthonous PCa models. Tumor uptake 
and uptake kinetics were measured using manually defined regions of interest at multiple 
time points from 4 to 320 hours. Imaging studies in bone and GEMM systems were 
designed to measure treatment effect on AR activity with surgical and/or chemical 
castration. BCa cell lines were evaluated for KLK2 expression and hK2 production with and 
without hormone stimulation. To study BCa hK2 production in vivo, we imaged BT474 
xenografts with and without androgen stimulation by 89Zr-11B6. Quantitative in vivo PET 
imaging data were assessed in addition to ex vivo autoradiography and gamma counting. 
PET study duration was sufficiently long to achieve 20 × 106 coincident events for low-noise 
reconstruction. Cohorts in treatment groups were randomized, and no outliers were 
excluded.

 Reagents
All chemicals and biological assay agents were of the highest available purity and were 
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, unless otherwise noted. Murine 11B6 was 
provided by K. Pettersson at the University of Turku, Finland, and hu11B6 was developed 
by Diaprost Inc. and produced by Innovagen Inc. Enzalutamide (MDV3100), which was 
manufactured by Medivation, was provided by C. Sawyers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center (MSKCC).
Preparation of zirconium-89
Zirconium-89 was produced through the 89Y(p,n)89Zr transmutation reaction on an EBCO 
TR19/9 variable beam energy cyclotron (Ebco Industries Inc.) in accordance with previously 
reported methods (44). 89Zr-oxalate was isolated in high radionuclidic and radiochemical 
purity of >99.9% with an effective specific activity of 195 to 497 mega-becquerel (MBq)/μg 
(5.27 to 13.31 mCi/μg). Immediately before radiolabeling, 89Zr[Zr]oxalate was neutralized 
with aliquots of 1 M NaCO3 to pH 7.
Preparation of radiolabeled construct
Before conjugation, all antibodies were exchanged into 0.1 M Hepes (pH 8) by repeated 
ultracentrifugation (Amicon Centriplus YM-50, Millipore) and gel purification (PD10, GE 
Healthcare). The zirconium chelator, deferoxamine-p-SCN (AREVA Med), was conjugated 
to the antibody using a molar excess of 7:1. After addition of the bifunctional chelate, the 
reaction was adjusted to pH 8.5 with Na2CO3, shakenat 37°C for 1 hour, and then purified 
by repeated centrifugation, as above, into PBS. By isotopic dilution measurement, the 
average chelate/antibody ratio was determined to be 0.9 (45).
For radiolabeling, DFO-conjugated 11B6 (400 μl) was mixed with neutralized 89Zr[Zr] and 
mixed gently. The pH after mixture was cross-checked and adjusted to pH 7, if needed. The 
labeling reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 hour. The conjugate was then purified by 
repeated purification by ultrafiltration into sterile saline. Radiochemical yield was assessed 
after purification; average yield was between 40 and 50%. Radiopurity was assessed by 
radio-instant thin layer chromatography. Briefly, 89Zr-DFO-11B6 (89Zr-11B6) was blotted 
(1 μl) on a silica-impregnated paper and eluted with a solution of 50 mM 
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. All labeling reactions achieved >99% radiochemical 
purity. Average specific activity of the final radiolabeled conjugate was 1.4 mCi/mg.
Preparation of fluorescently labeled constructs
Before conjugation, all antibodies were purified as above. The near-infrared fluorophore 
Cy5.5-NHS (GE Healthcare) was resuspended in methanol, aliquoted, and dried by 
SpeedVac. Using a molar excess of 3:1, the antibody was labeled, and the pH was adjusted 
to 8.5 with Na2CO3. The reaction was shaken at 22°C for 4 hours, followed by gel 
purification (PD10) and ultrafiltration (Amicon). The number of dye molecules per antibody 
was evaluated using a spectrophotometer and calculated to be 1.3 (SpectraMax M5, 
Molecular Devices). The dyelabeled antibody conjugate was freshly prepared for each 
experiment.

 Cell lines
LNCaP, DU-145, CWR22Rv1, MDAPCa2b, and VCaP were purchased from American 
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cell lines were cultured according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. LAPC4, LREX′, and LNCaP-AR/luc were previously 
developed and reported by the Sawyers laboratory (46–48).
Animal studies
All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the institutional guidelines at the 
MSKCC. For xenograft studies, male athymic BALB/c (nu/nu) mice (6 to 8 weeks old, 20 to 
25g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. LNCaP, DU-145, CWR22Rv1, 
MDAPCa2b, LAPC4, and VCaP tumors were inoculated in the right flank by subcutaneous 
injection of 1 × 106 to 5 × 106 cells in a 200-μl cell suspension of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 
medium with Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products Inc.). Tumors developed after 3 
to 7 weeks. Enzalutamide (MDV3100) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) so that 
the final DMSO concentration when administered to animals would be ≤5%. The 
formulation of the vehicle is 1:0.1:5 (carboxymethyl cellulose/polysorbate 80/DMSO). 
Enzalutamide or vehicle was administered daily by gavage. Liver xenografts of the LREX′ 
line were implanted as described in the Supplementary Materials.
Flank xenografts of the BT474 cell line were established using previously described 
procedures (49). Briefly, 17β-estradiol pellets (0.72 mg per pellet) (Innovative Research of 
America) were inserted subcutaneously before inoculation of 1 × 106 cells in a 200-μl 
suspension of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of medium with Matrigel (n =6).For this study, female 
Balb/c (nu/nu) animals were used. Animals in the DHT-positive group were supplemented 
with an additional subcutaneous 12.5 mg of DHT pellet (Innovative Research of America).
Preparation of osseous tumor grafts
Male CB-17 severe combined immunodeficient mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were anesthetized 
with a mixture of ketamine-xylazine, and a parapatellar incision was made in the left 
hindlimb. The tibia was punctured using a needle, and 1 × 105 cells (VCaP-luc or LNCaP-
AR) were injected into the cavity. The puncture was closed with bone wax, the incision was 
sutured, and animals received a palliative dose of carprofen (5 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days 
after inoculation. Tumor development was followed with bioluminescence imaging and 
confirmed with CT.
Biodistribution studies
Biodistribution studies were conducted to evaluate the uptake of 89Zr-11B6 in human PCa 
xenograft models. Mice received 89Zr-11B6 [3.7 to 5.55 MBq (100 to 150 μCi); 300, 100, 
50, or 15 μg of protein in 150 μl of sterile saline for injection] through intravenous tail vein 
injection (t = 0 hour). Animals (n = 4 to 5 per group) were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation 
at 24, 72, 96, 120, 240, and 344 hours after injection, and blood was immediately harvested 
by cardiac puncture. Eleven tissues (including the tumor) were removed, rinsed in water, 
dried on paper, weighed, and counted on a gamma counter for accumulation of 89Zr 
radioactivity. Count data were corrected for background activity and decay, and the tissue

 uptake (measured in units of %IA/g) for each sample was calculated by normalization to the 
total amount of activity injected.
Small animal PET imaging
PET imaging experiments were conducted on a microPET Focus 120 scanner (Concorde 
Microsystems). In initial studies, mice (n ≥ 4) were administered with formulations 
of 89Zr-11B6 [3.7 to 5.55 MBq (100 to 150 μCi); 300, 100, 50, or 25 μg of protein in 150 μl 
of sterile saline for injection] through tail vein injection. About 5 min before recording PET 
images, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 1 to 2% isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare)/
oxygen gas mixture and placed on the scanner bed. PET images were recorded at various 
time points between 1 and 344 hours after injection. List-mode data were acquired using a 
γ-ray energy window of 350 to 750 keV and a coincidence timing window of 6 ns. PET 
image data were corrected for detector non-uniformity, dead time, random coincidences, and 
physical decay. For all static images, scan time was adjusted to ensure that between 15 
million and 25 million, coincident events were recorded.
Data were sorted into 3D histograms by Fourier rebinning, and transverse images were 
reconstructed using a maximum a priori algorithm to a 256 × 256 × 95 (0.72 mm × 0.72 mm 
× 1.3 mm) matrix. The reconstructed spatial resolution for zirconium-89 was 1.9 mm full-
width half-maximum at the center of the field of view. The image data were normalized to 
correct for nonuniformity of response of the PET, dead-time count losses, positron branching 
ratio, and physical decay to the time of injection, but no attenuation, scatter, or partial 
volume averaging correction was applied. An empirically determined system calibration 
factor [in units of (mCi/ml)/(counts per second per voxel)] for mice was used to convert 
voxel count rates to activity concentrations. The resulting image data were then normalized 
to the administered activity to parameterize images in terms of %IA/g. Manually defined 3D 
regions of interest (also referred to as volumes of interest) were used to determine the 
maximum and mean %IA/g (decay corrected to the time of injection) in various tissues. 
Images were analyzed using the ASIPro VM software (Concorde Microsystems).
Small-animal CT imaging and coregistration
Animals that were scanned on both PET and x-ray CT systems were placed on a custom-
built platform in a rigid body fixed position (using 0.1-mm polyethylene wrapping) (20). 
The bed was placed into an integrated heated air, anesthesia bed (MultiCell, Mediso). The 
bed was fixed in place on the microPET gantry and imaged as above. The bed was then 
moved for CT imaging using the NanoSPECT/CT (Bioscan). General acquisition parameters 
were 55 kVp with a pitch of 1 and 240 projections in a spiral scan mode. The entire animal 
was scanned using a multiple-field-of-view procedure (with an approximate field of view of 
4 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm per bed position), commonly requiring three bed positions per scan. 
Total scan time was about 10 min. A Shepp-Logan filter was used during the reconstruction 
process to produce image matrices with isotropic volumes of 221 μm.
PET data were reconstructed using a 3D-filtered back projection maximum a priori 
algorithm using a ramp filter with a cutoff frequency equal to the Nyquist frequency into a 
128 × 128 × 95 matrix (50). Data were exported in raw format, and the rigid body (three

 degrees of freedom) coregistration between PET and CT data (and MRI, if applicable) was 
performed in Amira 5.3.3 (FEI). Amira and FIJI were used to produce most of the figures in 
the manuscript.
Fluorescence microscopy/surgical imaging/confocal microscopy
Micrographs were acquired using an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with 
a motorized stage (Prior Scientific Instruments Ltd.), X-Cite light source (EXFO), and filter 
sets (Chroma). Images were acquired and processed using NIS-Elements (Nikon), FIJI 
(National Institutes of Health), and MosaicJ (Phillipe Thévenaz, Biomedical Imaging Group, 
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). All fluorescent images were captured with 
a fixed exposure time (fluorophore-dependent).
Confocal laser scanning microscopy used the TCS SP8 (Leica) in the Molecular Cytology 
Core Facility at the MSKCC. Cells were plated on glass bottom dishes (Nunc) for 48 hours, 
washed, and then incubated for the noted time with Cy5.5-IgG (control), Cy5.5-11B6, 
and/or excess blocking 11B6 in the supplemented medium. Samples were scanned for 
Cy5.5.
Cellular internalization assay
VCaP, LNCaP, and BT474 (with and without DHT stimulation) cells, cultured according to 
ATCC guidelines, were incubated with 89Zr-11B6-containing medium. Uptake mechanism 
studies used purified human nonspecific IgG (400 μg per 1 ml per well, Invitrogen), human 
TruStain FcX Fc receptor blocking (40 μl per 1 ml per well, BioLegend), or h11B6 (Fab′)2 
(0.2 mg per 1 ml per well, Diaprost Inc.) added together with the radioactive antibody. 
Control wells contained 20-fold excess of unlabeled antibody (to test specificity). Triplicate 
samples were periodically removed, and cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS (without Ca2+ 
and Mg2+ + 0.2% bovine serum albumin). Lysate generated (1 ml of 1 M NaOH for 5 min) 
was gamma-counted. Cell uptake was determined by calculating percent activity found in 
cell lysate [100 × (cell lysate activity/total activity)].
Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on cells beginning 12 hours after 
incubation with 1:200 of either Cy5.5-11B6, phAb-11B6 (Promega cat. no. G9841), or 
control Cy5.5-IgG. For FcRn colocalization, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained 
using anti-FcRn Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific cat. no. NBP189128-FCGRT). 
FcRn is encoded by the FCGRT gene.
Affinity tests of 89Zr-DFO-11B6, DFO-11B6 and, H435A-11B6
Biotinylated 11B6 (100 μl; 2 mg/liter) was added to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates, 
followed by 1 hour of incubation with shaking. The plate was washed and after which, 20, 
100, 200, 400, or 1000 μg of compound (antibody) in 100 μl of DELFIA Assay Buffer was 
added to the wells, in duplicates, to compete with the capture antibody. Samples containing 
0.34 or 3.4 ng/ml in 100 μl of DELFIA Assay Buffer were added hereafter to the wells. 
After 2-hour incubation with shaking, the plate was washed, and the europium (III) (Eu3+)–
labeled tracer antibody 6H10 was added (200 μl; 0.5 mg/liter). The plate was incubated for 1

 hour with shaking and then washed. DELFIA Enhancement Solution (200 μl) was added, 
and 5 min later, the time-resolved fluorescence was measured.
Time-resolved immunofluorometric assay of free and total hK2
Total hK2 was measured using an in-house research assay that has previously been described 
by Vaisänen et al.(17). Briefly, streptavidin-coated microtiter plates were incubated with the 
biotinylated catcher antibody 6H10, followed by washing and incubation with samples and 
standards. After another round of washing, the Eu3+-labeled tracer antibody 7G1 was added. 
After incubation and washing steps, enhancement solution was added before reading the 
plates. Free hK2 was measured in a similar fashion, with biotin-labeled 11B6 as a capture 
antibody and Eu3+-labeled 6H10 as a tracer antibody. Both assays have a functional 
detection limit of 0.04 ng/ml.
Tissue lysate preparation and total protein measurement
Prostate tissues harvested from transgenic mice were homogenized in lysis buffer [50 mM 
sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche), 
and 10 mM benzamidine], sonicated for 10 s (550 Sonic Dismembrator, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was saved for 
measurement of free and total hK2. Total protein concentrations were determined in 
homogenates using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay. Details of the generation of GEMM can 
be found in the Supplementary Materials.
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR
About 200 mm3 of tumor sample was placed in a FastPrep Lysing Matrix tube (MP 
Biomedicals). Tumors were then homogenized in 500 μl of TRIzol (Ambion) using a 
FastPrep-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals). For xenograft tumors, the samples were 
transferred to a new Eppendorf tube, where 100 μg of glycogen (Ambion) was added. The 
samples were mixed by inversion and allowed to sit at room temperature for 5 min. 
Chloroform (100 μl; OmniSolv) was added, and the samples were shaken vigorously and 
incubated for 3 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 11,500 rpm at 4°C for 15 min, 
and the aqueous (top) phase was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. Isopropanol (250 μl) 
was added to the sample by pipetting until a precipitate formed. The sample was then 
centrifuged at 11,500 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 75 to 80% EtOH 
in diethyl pyrocarbonate water (Ambion). RNA was then purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit 
(Qiagen) or the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion). RNA quality and quantity were 
determined using a spectrophotometer at 260 and 280 nm (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated using the High-Capacity cDNA 
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Quantitative PCR was 
done using QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit and RT2 qPCR primers (Qiagen) on a 
RealPlex4 MasterCycler system (Eppendorf). KLK2 expression was quantified relative to β-
actin using the comparative CT method.

 Single-cell extractions of prostatic tissue
A suspension of single cells was derived from the excised mouse prostatic tissue (of animals 
dosed with 100 μg of Cy5.5-11B6) by mincing the tissue at 4°C, digesting it for 3 hours in 
collagenase/hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies) in culture medium (Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium with 5% fetal bovine serum) at 37°C, and incubating it in trypsin 
for 1 hour at 4°C, followed by low-speed centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 
dispase (5 mg/ml) and deoxyribonuclease I (1 mg/ml) (STEMCELL Technologies) and 
pipetted gently before being passed through a 70-μm strainer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Aliquots of the suspension were placed between two glass coverslips and scanned on the 
Eclipse Ti, as previously described.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SEM, unless otherwise noted. Statistical significance was 
analyzed by nonparametric Student’s t test. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used for 
assessing the strength of association between pairs of predefined variables. In all cases, 
differences in results were considered to be statistically significant when the computed P 
value was less than 0.05. All tests were two-tailed. Analyses were performed using Prism 
6.0 (GraphPad).

curves (C) in %IA/g of tumor (squares) and blood (circles) for 50-, 150-, and 300-μg doses 
(top to bottom). (D) Greater uptake in the higher hk2-producing VCaP in comparison to the 
LNCaP and nonproducing DU145 xenografts indicates specificity, which can also be 
blocked with cold antibody (1 mg). ROI, region of interest.

 Fig. 2. Precision imaging of metastatic lesions
89Zr-DFO-11B6 delineates osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastases. (A and B) The 
radiotracer is able to distinguish both LNCaP-AR osteolytic (A) and VCaP osteoblastic (B) 
tumors. (C) PC3 AR- and hK2-negative osteolytic lesions in the mouse tibia. X-ray 
computed tomography (CT) (leftmost column) of the electron-dense bone shows the loss of 
bone in the LNCaP and PC3 models. The intensity of signal recapitulates the relative hK2 
expression in the two AR-positive cell lines (PET column, second from left). Three-
dimensional (3D) PET/CT fusion images with opaque bone (second column from right) and 
transparent bone (rightmost column) show that these metastases are restricted from the 
surrounding soft tissue. Low amounts of nonspecific 89Zr uptake at the epiphyseal growth 
plate are seen in all models.
