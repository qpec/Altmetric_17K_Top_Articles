Abstract
Background
Vaccine development for influenza A/H5N1 is an important public health priority, but H5N1
vaccines are less immunogenic than seasonal influenza vaccines. Adjuvant System 03
(AS03) markedly enhances immune responses to H5N1 vaccine antigens, but the underly-
ing molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood.
Objective and Methods
We compared the safety (primary endpoint), immunogenicity (secondary), gene expression
(tertiary) and cytokine responses (exploratory) between AS03-adjuvanted and unadju-
vanted inactivated split-virus H5N1 influenza vaccines. In a double-blinded clinical trial, we
randomized twenty adults aged 18–49 to receive two doses of either AS03-adjuvanted (n =
10) or unadjuvanted (n = 10) H5N1 vaccine 28 days apart. We used a systems biology
approach to characterize and correlate changes in serum cytokines, antibody titers, and
gene expression levels in six immune cell types at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after the first
vaccination.
Results
Both vaccines were well-tolerated. Nine of 10 subjects in the adjuvanted group and 0/10 in
the unadjuvanted group exhibited seroprotection (hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer

of IL-6 and IP-10 were noted. Interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation-
related gene responses were induced in dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Upre-
gulation of MHC class II antigen presentation-related genes was seen in neutrophils. Three
days after AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and divi-
sion was detected in NK cells and correlated with serum levels of IP-10. Early upregulation
of interferon signaling-related genes was also found to predict seroprotection 56 days after
first vaccination.
Conclusions
Using this cell-based systems approach, novel mechanisms of action for AS03-adjuvanted
pandemic influenza vaccination were observed.

Introduction
Since avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses have been associated with a high morbidity and mortal-
ity in humans, vaccine development has been a public health priority [1, 2]. Relative to sea-
sonal influenza vaccines, however, A/H5N1 influenza vaccines have been less immunogenic,
inducing weaker vaccine strain hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing antibody
responses after a single vaccination [3]. Adjuvants, such as aluminum salts, monophosphoryl
lipid A (MPL) with aluminum salt (AS04) [4, 5], and oil-in-water emulsion-based formula-
tions (MF59, AF03, AS03) [6–8], have been shown to increase the immunogenicity of both sea-
sonal and avian influenza vaccines and decrease the amount of antigen required (antigen-
sparing) [9–11]. One such emulsion-based, TLR-independent adjuvant, Adjuvant System 03
(AS03) [6], has been shown to markedly increase the immune response to avian influenza vac-
cines and to stimulate significantly higher antibody responses compared to MF59 when
administered with H7N9 vaccine [12–18].
Initial studies of the mechanisms of action of AS03 in animal models suggest that the adju-
vant enhances antigen delivery, immune cell recruitment, stimulation of local immune cells,
and induction of complement and other stress signals [19]. AS03 has also been shown to
increase innate immune responses and promote recruitment of antigen-presenting cells
(APC) to draining lymph nodes [19]. Transcriptomic analysis of mouse muscle cells at vaccine
injection sites has demonstrated that other oil-in-water adjuvants also stimulate local expres-
sion of genes involved in innate immune responses including cytokine activity, leukocyte
migration, and antigen presentation [20, 21]. Finally, a recent AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 human
vaccine study identified early cytokine responses and gene responses related to interferon sig-
naling and antigen presentation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at day 1, as
well as increased incidence of plasma cells and plasma cell-associated genes at day 7 [22].
However, our understanding of the molecular interactions by which AS03 enhances human
immune responses to H5N1 vaccine is still incomplete.
Systems vaccinology offers a comprehensive approach to dissect the human immune
response to vaccination by correlating traditional antibody and cell-mediated immune

Emmes Corporation is an independent contract
research organization NIH-NIAID-DMID contracted
with for collecting and analyzing data for clinical
trials and studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy
 responses with changes in global molecular signatures of gene, protein, metabolite, and lipid
expression [23–28]. We recently reported the use of a systems biology approach to study the
immune responses in six individual immune cell types following vaccination with seasonal tri-
valent influenza vaccine [29]. That study revealed that monocytes, neutrophils, myeloid den-
dritic cells (mDC), natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells showed unique transcriptomic
profiles and changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination. Such cell type-
specific systems information provides a unique approach to monitor transcriptional responses
after vaccination.
Using this approach, we conducted a small, single center study with the objectives to assess
the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and molecular immune responses to intramuscular
(IM) administration of an inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 (Hemagglutinin [HA] of
A/Indonesia/05/2005) split-virus vaccine given with or without the AS03 adjuvant. Our com-
prehensive cell-based systems analysis of human transcriptomic responses to H5N1 vaccine
indicates that AS03 modulates early innate immune gene expression and increased serum
cytokine responses, with the strongest effect for genes expressed in neutrophils, monocytes,
and dendritic cells. Potentially novel mechanisms of action for the AS03 adjuvant when
administered with avian influenza vaccine were identified, including up-regulation of antigen
processing and presentation genes in neutrophils and induction of cellular proliferation
responses that correlated with serum IP-10 levels in NK cells.
Materials and Methods
Study Products
Inactivated monovalent influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 split-virus vaccine at a dosage
of 3.75 mcg and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) diluent were both manufactured by Sanofi
Pasteur. The AS03 adjuvant was manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and contains 4.86
mg polysorbate 80, 11.86 mg α-tocopherol, and 10.69 mg squalene per 0.5 mL vaccine dose in
an oil-in-water emulsion. The vaccine and adjuvant were provided by the US Department of
Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority
from the National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile.
Study Design
A single-center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, Phase I study in healthy male and
non-pregnant female subjects 18 to 49 years old was designed to assess the safety, reactogeni-
city, immunogenicity, and molecular immune responses of an intramuscular (IM) inactivated
monovalent influenza A/H5N1 (hemagglutinin [HA] of A/Indonesia/05/2005) split-virus (SV)
vaccine administered at 3.75 mcg given with the AS03 adjuvant (SV-AS03) or PBS diluent
(SV-PBS) (S1 Text). After informed consent, eligible subjects were screened for inclusion and
exclusion criteria (enrollment criteria described in Section 2.1 in S2 Text). Twenty subjects
were randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to receive either 3.75 mcg of H5 hemagglutinin
+ AS03 (n = 10) or 3.75 mcg of H5 hemagglutinin + PBS (n = 10). Permuted block randomiza-
tion with random block sizes of 2 and 4 were applied to improve balance between vaccine
groups. The treatment allocation sequence was generated by the study statistician using a ran-
dom number generator. A secure web portal was used to assign treatment codes to subjects
after verification of eligibility. An unblinded pharmacist prepared the treatment per the
assigned code, which was then administered by an unblinded vaccine administrator who had
no further contact with the subject. All subjects received two 0.5 mL intramuscular injections
28 days apart containing equal volumes of the inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1
split-virus vaccine admixed by the study pharmacist prior to administration with either AS03

ing injection. The subjects and the study team, with the exception of the unblinded vaccinator,
as well as the study investigators, research coordinators, and laboratory personnel were
blinded to vaccine assignment (Fig 1). No subject was lost to follow-up (Fig 1, Tables A1 and
A4 in S2 Text).
The sample size in this Phase I study was not based on a formal hypothesis but practical
considerations to gather initial information on the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and
molecular immune responses. Study recruitment commenced May 22, 2012, and the final
study follow-up visit occurred January 2, 2014.

 Safety and Reactogenicity Assessments
The occurrence of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events were captured for 8 days
following each vaccine dose. Unsolicited adverse events and new-onset medical conditions
were also recorded until one year after the second vaccination, and events were graded for
severity and for relationship to study product. All reactogenicity assessments were collected
according to standardized methodology (Section 2.3 in S2 Text).
Laboratory Procedures
For cytokine/chemokine levels, cell sorting, cell activation, and RNA-Seq assessments, blood
samples were collected on study visit days -28, -14, 0 (pre-vaccination), and 1, 3, 7, 28 (post-
first vaccination). Sera for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing antibody (Nt)
assays were collected at study visit days 0, 1, 3, 7, 28, and 56.
Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing antibody (Nt) assays.
Sera for
hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing antibody (Nt) responses against the homolo-
gous A/Indonesia/05/2005 virus were measured as previously described (Southern Research;
Birmingham, AL) [30]. For analysis, values below the limit of detection (1:10 for each assay)
were imputed as half the limit of detection.
Cytokine and chemokine assays. Cytometric bead arrays (CBAs) for IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IP-10, TNF, LT-α, RANTES, eotaxin-1, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and IFN-γ
were performed in duplicate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences).
Data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). CBA results below the
lower limit of detection (LOD) were imputed using ½ of the LOD estimate provided by BD
Biosciences (see S2 Text).
Cell sorting.
Fractionation of collected blood samples for neutrophils, monocytes, DC,
NK cells, T cells and B cells was performed as previously described [29]. Briefly, whole blood
samples (90 mL) underwent Ficoll separation to yield PBMC and polymorphonuclear cell
(PMN) populations. Single cell suspensions of PBMC or PMN were subjected to magnetic
bead separation. T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils were enriched by positive selection using
directly conjugated anti-CD3, anti-CD14, and anti-CD15 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec),
respectively. B cells were enriched by positive selection using anti-PE beads after staining with
anti-CD19-PE antibody (Miltenyi Biotech). NK/mDC were enriched by negative selection
using Streptavadin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) after staining with biotinylated anti-CD19,
anti-CD15, anti-CD14, and anti-CD3 antibodies (eBioscience). MACS enriched cells were
stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), CD11c-FITC, CD15-APC and CD56-PE-Cy7
(BD Biosciences), as well as CD19-PE, CD3-VioBlue, and CD14-VioGreen (Miltenyi Biotec),
and were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on a BD FACSAriaIII flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell purity of �98% was confirmed after the sorting procedures.
Purified immune cells (�0.5x106) were frozen in homogenization buffer (Maxwell 16 LEV
simply RNA kit, Promega) and stored at -80˚C.
Cell phenotype and activation assessments.
Multi-parameter flow cytometric analysis
(FCM) was performed on a daily basis using the same antibody panel from the cell sort, with-
out 7AAD and including CD69-APC-Cy7, CD86-PerCP-Cy5.5 and CD134-PE-Cy5 (BD Bio-
sciences), to assess the phenotype and cellular activation status of each cell type in whole
blood, the PBMC and PMN fractions, and post-sorted cell samples as previously described (see
S2 Text for additional details) [29].
RNA-Sequencing and data processing.
RNA-Seq experiments were performed as previ-
ously described [29]. Briefly, RNA was extracted from sorted cells using the automated Max-
well 16 magnetic particle processor and a Maxwell 16 LEV simply RNA kit (Promega).

 Polyadenylated RNAs were isolated using NEBNext magnetic oligo d(T)25 beads (New
England BioLabs), individually bar-coded, and next generation sequencing expression libraries
were prepared using the NEBNext mRNA Library Prep Reagent Set for Illumina (New
England BioLabs). Each library was diluted to a final concentration of 12.5nM and pooled
equimolar prior to clustering. Paired-End (PE) sequencing (25 million, 50-bp, paired-end
reads) was performed using a 200 cycle TruSeq SBS HS v3 kit (Illumina) on an Illumina
HiSeq2000 sequencer. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the standard Illu-
mina Pipeline consisting of Real time Analysis (RTA) v1.13. Raw reads were de-multiplexed
using a bcl2fastq conversion software v1.8.3 (Illumina) with default settings. Paired-end reads
were mapped against the human reference genome (GRCh37) using TopHat v2.0.0. Human
gene models and annotations were obtained from ENSEMBL v63 (June 2011). Gene expres-
sion quantification was conducted on the gene level using Subread v1.4.6 counting mapped
paired-reads to obtain fragment counts per gene (see S2 Text for additional details).
Statistical Analysis
Serum antibody, cytokine/chemokine, and cell activation analyses.
Serum HAI and Nt
GMTs were compared at each post-vaccination time point using a t-test under the assumption
that titers are log normally distributed adjusting for unequal variances between vaccine groups,
if necessary (Satterthwaite approximation if the equality of variances based on a Folded form
F-test was rejected). The proportion of subjects with a pre-vaccination titer <1:10 and a mini-
mum four-fold rise to a post-baseline titer � 1:40 (seroconversion) and those achieving post-
vaccination antibody titers �1:40 (seroprotection) [31, 32] were summarized per post-vaccina-
tion time point using exact 95% CIs and compared using a Fisher’s exact test. The 95% CIs for
median serum cytokine/chemokine baseline fold changes for each post-vaccination time point
were calculated using the bootstrap method [33] with 1,000 replications. Fold changes between
vaccine groups were compared using a non-parametric exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The
same non-parametric methods were used to visualize and compare percent cell activation. All
hypothesis tests described in this section were carried out in a two-sided manner using an indi-
vidual alpha level of 0.05. Bootstrap-based median CIs were calculated using the R statistical
software (Version 3.01). All other analyses described in this section were executed using the
SAS statistical software (Version 9.3).
RNA-Seq analyses.
edgeR [34] (Version 3.2.4) was used to correct systematic sample dif-
ferences in fragment counts using TMM normalization [35] to calculate moderated log2 frag-
ment counts per million (LCPM), and to model fragment counts using a discrete probability
distribution. LCPMs were used as input for multivariate analyses to detect outliers and to filter
out lowly expressed genes (see S2 Text). Log2 fold changes from baseline (LFCPM) were calcu-
lated for each subject and immune cell type by subtracting the mean of the log2 baseline values
(days -28, -14, 0) from each of the subject’s post-baseline days. Differentially expressed (DE)
genes (SV-AS03 vs. SV-PBS) were identified for each post-vaccination day and immune cell
type by fitting negative binomial generalized linear models as implemented in edgeR under the
assumption that discrete fragment counts are negative binomial distributed. Models included
fixed effects for subject, study visit day (baseline or post-vaccination day), and a study visit day
x vaccine group interaction term (see S2 Text). The subject effect for estimating subject-spe-
cific mean baseline levels was added to account for correlations between samples from the
same subject. The interaction term represents the log2 fold change difference (LFCD) between
SV-AS03 and SV-PBS vaccine group responses. The statistical significance of the interaction
term was evaluated for each gene using a likelihood ratio test. To control for testing multiple
genes, the false-discovery rate (FDR) based on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [36] as

 implemented in the p.adjust R function was applied. Based on results from our previous study
[29], genes with an FDR-adjusted p-value � 0.05 and a fold change of � 1.5-fold (up or down
regulation based on LFCD) between the two vaccine groups were deemed to be significantly
differentially expressed. A global GC-content bias was observed when visualizing vaccine
group effect by gene GC-content (Fig A41-A46 in S2 Text) [37]. This confounding effect was
successfully corrected for by adding mean sample GC-content as a covariate to the negative
binomial models when determining DE genes (see S2 Text). To identify robust clusters of co-
expressed genes based on LFCPM, multiscale bootstrapping was carried out using the pvclust
R package [38]. Gene set enrichment analysis to identify significantly enriched KEGG [39]
(v70.0), and MSigDB [40] (v4.0) functional modules was carried out using the goseq R package
[41] (v1.12.0) correcting for gene length bias and multiple testing (FDR-adjusted p-value �
0.01). The mixOmics (v5.0–3), and glmnet (v2.0–2) R packages were used for regularized
canonical and logistic regression analysis to identify gene responses (based on LFCPM) that
correlated with cytokine/antibody responses as well as genes that predicted seroprotection sta-
tus (HAI titer �1:40). In both cases, leave-one-out cross-validation was used to select optimal
models (see S2 Text). Human-human and human-influenza protein-protein interaction net-
works were downloaded from the IntAct database (01/14/2015). RNA-Seq analysis was carried
out using the R statistical software (Version 3.01).

Safety and Tolerability Assessments
All 20 subjects received both doses of vaccine and are included in the primary analysis. The
demographic characteristics of study participants are summarized in Table A1 in S2 Text.
Both vaccines were well-tolerated, with no severe reactions or adverse events following either
AS03-adjuvanted or unadjuvanted H5N1 vaccination. Most reactions were rated as mild and
were self-limited. The occurrence of local and systemic reactions and adverse events are sum-
marized in Tables A2-A3 and Fig A2 in S2 Text.

 Immunogenicity Assessments
HAI and Nt titers did not increase from baseline during the first 7 days after vaccination in
either SV-AS03 or SV-PBS vaccinated subjects (Fig 2A; Table A4 in S2 Text). Similarly, at day
28, there were no significant differences in HAI GMT between the SV-AS03 and SV-PBS
groups, (Fig 2A) with no subjects exhibiting an HAI response in the PBS group, while one sub-
ject in the SV-AS03 group exhibited an HAI titer �1:40 and > 4-fold rise in HAI titer (Fig
2B). By day 56 (28 days after second vaccination), HAI GMT increased to 130.0 for the SV-
AS03 subjects and 7.6 for the SV-PBS control group. Nine subjects in the SV-AS03 group
exhibited seroconversion and seroprotection at day 56, while there were none who serocon-
verted (or reached seroprotection titers) in the SV-PBS group (p<0.001) (Table A4 in S2
Text). At day 28, Nt GMT was significantly higher in the SV-AS03 group than the SV-PBS
group and by day 56, Nt GMT increased to 452.5 in the SV-AS03 group and 20.7 in the SV-
PBS group (p<0.001) (Fig 2A). All 10 subjects in the SV-AS03 group exhibited seroconversion
and seroprotection at day 56, while only 3 subjects in the SV-PBS group had positive Nt

unadjuvanted vaccine recipients, respectively.
At baseline, serum concentrations of IL-1α, IL-1β, LT-α, MIP-1α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 in blood
samples were below or close to the limit of detection (LOD). However, subjects in the SV-
AS03 group demonstrated a significant IL-6 response on the day after vaccination, with a
median fold change of 2.06 in the SV-AS03 group compared to no change in the SV-PBS
group (p = 0.02; Fig 2C and 2D). A differential response was also observed for IP-10, with
median fold changes of 2.06 and 1.56 at days 1 and 3 in the SV-AS03 group, and median fold
changes of 1.12 and 0.95 at days 1 and 3 in the SV-PBS group (day 1 p = 0.019; day 3 p = 0.015;
Fig 2C and 2D). The IL-10 fold change was also moderately increased at day 1 in the SV-AS03
group (median fold change of 1.66) compared to the SV-PBS group (median fold change of
0.79), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig 2D, Fig A9 in S2
Text). For all other cytokines/chemokines, no discernable differences in the two vaccine
groups were observed (Fig 2D; Fig A3-A16 in S2 Text).
In subjects from the SV-AS03 group, transient increases were observed in circulating neu-
trophils at day 1 (median fold change of 1.41 in number and 1.22 in proportion), monocytes at
day 1 (median fold change of 1.26 in number; no change in proportion) and day 3 (median
fold change of 1.11 in number and 1.321 in proportion), and dendritic cells at day 3 (median
fold change of 1.26 in number and 1.43 in proportion) (Fig A212-213 and Tables A161-A162
in S2 Text), consistent with other recent reports [22, 42]. These increases returned to baseline
by day 7.
Cellular activation analysis at each step of the purification process (whole blood, PBMC/
PMN fractions, and post-sorted cells) revealed that sorted cells were not activated by the sort-
ing process [29]. No statistically significant changes in activation marker expression in whole
blood were noted in SV-AS03-adjuvanted relative to SV-PBS immune cell samples at early
time points (day 1 and day 3) after vaccination. At day 7, monocytes showed an increase in the
percentage of cells expressing CD134 (median fold change of 1.2 vs. 0.99; p = 0.035), NK cells
showed an increase in the percentage of cells expressing CD134 (median fold change of 1.11
vs. 0.99; p = 0.028), and B cells showed an increase in the percentage of cells expressing CD134
(median fold change of 1.15 vs. 0.68; p = 0.043). At day 28, neutrophils showed an increase in
the percentage of cells expressing CD69 (median fold change of 1.55 vs. 0.89; p = 0.028). For
the remaining cell types and time points, no significant difference in percent of cells expressing
activation markers between the two vaccine groups was observed (Fig A194-A211 in S2 Text).
Summary of RNA-Seq Analysis of Immune Cells
For the six immune cell types and seven time points analyzed by RNA-Seq (839 RNA-Seq sam-
ples), an average of 56.2 million reads were mapped, of which 83.4% uniquely mapped to a
location on the human reference genome (Table A11 in S2 Text). The vast majority (81.6%)
of the sequence tags mapped to known exon regions followed by intronic regions (16.6%), and
intergenic regions (1.8%) (Table A12 in S2 Text). On average, 16.7 million fragments (recon-
stituted paired-end reads that mapped to the same gene) were counted for each sample in the
expression quantification step to determine TMM-normalized fragment counts for differential
gene analysis as well as LCPM and LFCPM for multivariate analyses (Table A11 in S2 Text).
Table A10 in S2 Text summarizes the number of genes that passed the low expression cut off
at each post-vaccination time point. Principal component analysis (PCA) of all samples, based
on LCPM, revealed that most of the total variation in gene expression was attributable to
immune cell type with three distinct cell clusters: (1) neutrophils, (2) lymphocytes (T cells, B

 cells, NK cells), and (3) dendritic cells/monocytes (Fig A28 in S2 Text). Non-metric multidi-
mensional scaling biplots and hierarchical clustering analysis confirmed cell-specific global
gene expression patterns (Fig A29-A30 in S2 Text).
Multiple Time Points to Measure Baseline Gene Expression
To evaluate sources of baseline variability and impact on fold change estimates, we investigated
expression levels at days -28, -14, and 0 prior to vaccination. Similar to global analysis of gene
expression, PCA of the three baseline time points (days -28, -14, 0; 360 RNA-Seq samples)
revealed that most of the total variation was attributable to the immune cell type (Fig A39 in
S2 Text). In addition, PCA results summarizing baseline variability showed that between-sub-
ject variability was significantly larger than within-subject variability for all six immune cell
types (ANOVA subject factor p < 0.001, Tables A35-46 and Fig A40 in S2 Text). Comparison
of genes with an absolute mean fold change (� 1.5) using the mean gene expression of the
three baseline measures (days -28, -14, 0) compared to either two (days -14 and 0) or one (day
0) showed that inclusion of additional baseline measures resulted in increasingly conservative
and consistent fold change estimates reducing the impact of transient baseline signals (see S2
Text and Table A53 in S2 Text). In the following, we present DE gene results adjusted for
per-subject mean baseline expression levels estimated using all three baseline measures as part
of the negative binomial model (results were also adjusted for sample GC content; see Methods
and S2 Text).
Transcriptomic Analysis Shows that AS03-Adjuvanted Vaccination
Primarily Modulates Early Innate Immune Cell Activity
To determine how AS03 boosts the immune response to vaccination, we first investigated
genes induced in response to AS03-adjuvanted (SV-AS03) relative to unadjuvanted (SV-PBS)
vaccine in each cell type. Neutrophils had the highest total number of DE genes (610 genes)
between adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines at all post-vaccination days (1, 3, 7, 28) fol-
lowed by monocytes (406 genes), and dendritic cells (229 genes). Lymphocytes had fewer DE
genes, with NK cells obtaining the highest number of differential genes (157 genes), followed
by T cells (49 genes) and B cells (14 genes) (S4 Table, Fig A54 in S2 Text). The majority of DE
genes (~87%; ranging from 84–100% depending on cell type and time point) were classified as
protein-coding genes, followed by processed transcripts (~6%; 0–7%), pseudogenes (~4%;
0–8%) and lncRNAs (~2.5%; 0–4%). Several other transcript classes were represented by 1–2
genes on a per-cell type and/or time point basis (Table A54 in S2 Text). Except for NK cells,
the majority of these DE genes were reported for day 1. The strongest responses at day 1 in
terms of number of genes occurred in neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells, with 572,
406, and 225 DE genes reported, respectively. Among these three immune cell types, genes
expressed in neutrophils showed a noticeably persistent differential response at day 3 (140
genes, 103 of which were also identified at day 1) (Fig A54 in S2 Text). Genes expressed in T
cells, NK cells, and B cells showed much less pronounced responses at day 1, with 14–49 DE
genes. NK cells showed distinct responses at day 3 and day 28, with 70 and 63 DE genes,
respectively.
Response Time Trends of AS03-Modulated Genes and Gene Clusters
To determine the response dynamics of individual and co-expressed DE genes over time, we
performed heatmap and gene clustering analyses. With the exception of NK cells, heatmaps
summarizing responses (LFCPM) for all subjects by cell type and time point showed that most
DE genes were increased from baseline for the SV-AS03 group at day 1 with a decreasing AS03

 effect (subject clustering by vaccine group) over time (Fig 3A–3F). At day 3, neutrophils and
NK cells showed a sustained AS03 effect that was driven by increased responses over baseline
for a subset of AS03-modulated genes (Fig 3B and 3D). In contrast to other immune cells and
earlier time points, the differential effect observed for NK cells at day 28 was driven by a set of
genes with increased responses for the unadjuvanted group and reduced responses in the
SV-AS03 group relative to baseline (Fig 3D).
Gene cluster analysis based on correlations between LFCPM following vaccination at days
1, 3, 7, and/or 28 provided a dynamic view of co-regulated gene responses for each group over
time. For the six immune cell types, we identified 100 cell-type specific gene clusters for which
we visualized time trends by vaccine group (AS03-adjuvanted or unadjuvated vaccine; Fig
A101-A105 and Tables A58-A72 in S2 Text). A selection of clusters that showed marked dif-
ferences in time trends for the two groups is shown in Fig 4. At day 1, several gene clusters
containing the transcriptional regulator STAT1 and interferon inducible genes encoding for
guanine binding family proteins (GBP1-GBP4) were jointly upregulated in multiple cell types
for the SV-AS03 group, but not for the SV-PBS group (Fig 4A). For most of these genes,
expression returned to baseline levels by day 3. For monocytes and neutrophils, two gene clus-
ters were identified that shared 4 interferon-inducible anti-viral genes (IF44, IFI44L, OAS2,
OAS3) whose expression is regulated by STAT1 (Fig 4B). Time trends for these clusters in
both cell types indicated a similar enhanced response for the SV-AS03 group at day 1. While
expression of all cluster members decreased to near-baseline levels after day 1 in monocytes,
responses for this cluster peaked at day 3 in neutrophils. A second neutrophil cluster contain-
ing antiviral and interferon-inducible genes also peaked at day 3 (Fig 4C). AS03-adjuvanted
vaccination-induced responses in both cell types were markedly reduced by day 7 and
returned to baseline at day 28.
For NK cells, robust gene clusters were identified at day 3 (Fig 4D). These clusters showed
similar time trends with near baseline levels at day 1 for both SV-AS03 and SV-PBS groups but
significantly increased levels for the SV-AS03 group at day 3. The largest of these clusters con-
tained 10 genes, all of which share functions related to cell division/mitosis/DNA replication
(ASPM, BIRC5, BUB1, CDC20, CENPF, GTSE1, MKI67, SKA3, TOP2A, TPX2). The other clus-
ter contained 5 genes (KIFC1, NUSAP1, NCAPH, STMN1, TYMS) also known to play a role in
cell division, indicating that AS03 increased NK cell division activity at day 3. Expression of
genes in these AS03-modulated clusters declined by day 7 and returned to baseline levels at
day 28.
At day 28, NK cell gene responses for 8 genes were significantly correlated (GABBR1,
NOD2, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DMB, GAPT, FGD2). Time trends showed
similar near-baseline average responses for both groups at day 1, 3, and 7 (Fig 4E). However,
by day 28, the SV-PBS group exhibited higher responses compared to the SV-AS03 group,
which exhibited a slight decrease. Four genes in this cluster encode for major histocompatibil-
ity complex (MHC) class II proteins indicating that, at day 28, NK cells suggest increased anti-
gen presenting activity in the unadjuvanted vaccine group. Similar trends with increased day
28 responses for the unadjuvanted group were observed for several other gene clusters in NK
cells (Fig A105 in S2 Text).
AS03-Adjuvanted Vaccination Triggers Interferon Signaling, Cell
Proliferation and Antigen Processing and Presentation
To determine the functional and/or biological categorization of genes modulated by AS03, we
performed gene set enrichment analysis based on the Reactome database [43] (S5 Table). This
analysis showed that DE genes with pathway annotations were primarily involved in known

 immune system processes (41–100% of annotated differential genes). At day 1, Immune system
genes were significantly enriched in AS03-modulated genes expressed in all immune cells
except for NK cells (Fig 5, source: Reactome). Immune system genes were also enriched in
AS03-modulated genes after adjuvanted vaccine in neutrophils at day 3 and genes primarily
upregulated in NK cells in the SV-PBS group at day 28. Cytokine signaling, in particular Inter-
feron signaling, was significantly enhanced by SV-AS03 in all immune cells at day 1, as well as
in neutrophils at day 3. Despite the presence of α-tocopherol in the AS03 preparation, we did
not detect any significant associations between AS03-modulated genes and Vitamin E uptake/
metabolism-related pathways.
Several human infectious disease pathways were overrepresented in AS03-modulated genes
(Fig A112 in S2 Text, source: KEGG pathways). Among these, the highest gene overlap was
observed for the Influenza A pathway. This pathway was significantly enriched in AS03-modu-
lated genes expressed in monocytes (day 1: 14 genes), neutrophils (day 1: 23 genes and day 3: 8
genes), and T-cells (day 1: 5 genes), as well as in unadjuvanted vaccine-modulated genes in NK
cells (day 28: 7 genes). Influenza A pathway maps colored by treatment effect (LFCD) show a
relative upregulation of the CXCL10 gene encoding for the IP-10 cytokine in the adjuvanted
group relative to the unadjuvanted group in monocytes (LFCD = 1.7, 3.3 fold) and in dendritic
cells (LFCD = 1.9, 3.7 fold) (S4 Table, Fig A118-A119 in S2 Text). Relative upregulation was
also observed for Jak-STAT sub-pathway genes in neutrophils from the SV-AS03 group at day
1 and day 3 (Fig A120-A121 in S2 Text), and to a lesser extent in monocytes (Fig A119 in S2
Text) and dendritic cells (Fig A118 in S2 Text). For neutrophils, related innate immune sig-
naling pathways including RIG-I-like receptor signaling and NOD-like receptor signaling were
significantly enriched (Fig A136-A137 in S2 Text). The complement and coagulation cascade
pathway was significantly enriched in dendritic cells from the adjuvanted group (Fig A135 in
S2 Text). Genes expressed in NK-cells in the SV-PBS group showed a delayed upregulated
response for several genes in the Influenza A pathway at day 28 (Fig A122 in S2 Text).
Cell proliferation was significantly enriched for AS03-modulated genes expressed in mono-
cytes and neutrophils at day 1 and in NK cells at day 3 (Fig A113 in S2 Text, source: GO
Biological Processes). The majority [28/33 (85%)] of NK cell genes that were differentially
expressed at day 3 with any Reactome pathway annotations were involved in Cell cycle, in par-
ticular, Cell cycle mitotic [27/33 (82%)] (S5 Table). Inspection of the Cell cycle KEGG pathway
map showed a consistent differential vaccine group effect (LFCD) pattern for most of these
genes with higher fold changes for the SV-AS03 group (Fig 6).
At day 1, MHC class I mediated antigen processing presentation was enriched in AS03-mo-
dulated genes expressed in dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils (Fig 5, source: Reac-
tome). Expression of NLRC5 (NOD-, LRR-and CARD-containing 5), a transactivator of MHC
class-I genes, and genes associated with ER translocation machinery (TAP1 and TAP2), were
found to be upregulated in neutrophils, monocytes, and DC at day 1 (S4 Table) [44]. Addi-
tionally, ERAP2 and TPP2, which are involved in peptide cleavage, were identified as AS03-
responsive in neutrophils at day 1 (S4 Table). At day 1, genes involved in the Proteasome path-
way (PSMB8/9/10, and PSME1/2), in particular, genes related to immunoproteasome subunit

phils from the SV-AS03 group at day 1 and NK cells from the SV-PBS group at day 28. In both
cases, this included CIITA, the MHC class II transactivator gene and genes encoding for MHC

 class II HLA molecules (Fig 7, S4 Table). Additionally, Regulatory Factor X subunit, RFX5,
which acts in conjunction with CIITA to induce transcription of MHC class II HLA genes, and
CD74, which encodes the MHC class-II-associated Ii (invariant chain) essential for targeting
MHC II molecules to the endosomal-lysosomal antigen-processing compartment [45, 46]
were found to be differentially expressed in response to SV-AS03 in neutrophils at day 1 (Fig
7A, S4 Table). For monocytes, although genes encoding for MHC II proteins were signifi-
cantly differentially expressed at day 1, the AS03 effect for the MHC II sub-pathway was much
less pronounced (Fig A125 in S2 Text). All of these findings were confirmed when inspecting
subject-level response heatmaps (based on LFCPM) for this pathway (Fig 7A and 7B and Fig

 A106-109 in S2 Text). In contrast, NK cells from the SV-AS03 group generally demonstrated
a trend for downregulation of MHC-class II genes at all time points at the subject-level. Upre-
gulation of MHC-related genes was not consistently observed in unadjuvanted vaccine recipi-
ents in any of these cell types at early time points. However, induction of MHC class II genes
was observed in NK cells at day 28 in the unadjuvanted group (Fig 7B). Overall, the observed

 MHC II effects for neutrophils and NK cells were stronger than the MHC I effects in terms of
LFCD and LCPM (Fig 7A and 7B).
AS03-Responsive Genes are Shared among Immune Cells
To determine the amount of overlap in gene expression between cell types, we compared DE
lists from each cell type and time point. The highest overlap of AS03-responsive genes among
immune cell types was observed for day 1 (S6 Table, Fig 8). Expression of 5 genes (GBP1,
IRF1, STAT1, EPSTI1, PARP9 [47]) was significantly enhanced by adjuvanted vaccine in all six
immune cell types (S6 Table). Of these, GBP1, IRF1, and STAT1 are known to play a role in
innate antiviral immune responses and interferon (IFN) signaling. IRF1 and STAT1 are tran-
scriptional regulators that cooperate in the regulation of antiviral genes that constitute antiviral
cell states [48, 49] including GBP1, which is known to inhibit viral replication [50, 51]. The
highest overlap between AS03-modulated genes was observed for monocytes, dendritic cells,
and neutrophils. Monocytes and dendritic cells shared 130 genes (32% and 58% of their
respective gene sets) while neutrophils and monocytes had 138 genes in common (24% and
34% of their respective gene sets). Neutrophils and dendritic cells shared 90 genes covering
22% and 40% of their significant genes, respectively. Twenty five out of 49 differential T cell
genes (51%) and 14 out of 24 differential NK cell genes (58%) overlapped with genes reported
for monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Genes that were differentially expressed in NK
cells at day 3 (70 genes) and day 28 (63 genes) shared only a maximum of 3–7 genes with sets
from any of the other cell types, indicating that most of these later responses were unique to
NK cells.
Eighty DE genes that we have defined “core AS03-responsive genes” were shared between
neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells at day 1 (S7 Table, Fig 8). Of these genes, at least
30 are known interferon-response genes. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that Interferon
signaling, RIG I MDA5 signaling, Antigen processing and cross presentation, as well as Antiviral
mechanisms by IFN stimulated genes represented the top enriched gene sets for the 80 gene
cohort (S5 Table). To further characterize these “core AS03-responsive genes”, we analyzed
them in the context of their known interacting partners. Network analysis revealed a number
of interesting sub-networks (Fig 9). One predominant cluster of nodes is centralized around
PLSCR1, an IFN-inducible gene that potentially could have a role in antiviral responses
through its interaction with TLR, specifically TLR9, in dendritic cells [52]. Another large clus-
ter of nodes centers around IFIT1, IFIT2, and IFIT3, IFN-induced genes that have recently
emerged as having a wide range of antiviral functions, including binding and sequestering
cytoplasmic viral RNA, inhibiting viral protein translation, and possibly playing a role in
downstream immune signaling [53]. Another node centers around TAP1 and TAP2, ATP-
binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes that are necessary for peptide translocation across
the endoplasmic reticulum for association with MHC class I molecules [54, 55], and PSMB9
[56], a proteasome complex involved in the processing of class I MHC peptides. Smaller net-
works of interest are present surrounding OAS3, an IFN-induced gene product that inhibits
cellular protein synthesis and is involved in antiviral functions [57], and IRF7, a key transcrip-
tional regulator of type I IFN responses [58]. Networks for AS03-responsive genes identified
for each individual immune cell type (monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) are shown
in Figs A139-A141 in S2 Text.
Comparisons to Published Immune Response Transcriptome Studies

 manually curated sets of human and mouse gene immune responses (MSigDB Immunologic
Signatures, 1,910 gene sets). These gene sets were primarily microarray-based immunological
response studies. Gene sets with the most similarity to our data included the yellow fever
viral vaccine (genes upregulated in human PBMCs at Day 7 following vaccination vs. control
(GSE13485)) [59], live Newcastle virus infection (genes upregulated at 8h following infection of
human dendritic cells (GSE18791)) [60], and in vitro stimulation with either IFN-γ (genes upre-
gulated at 24h following stimulation of human fetal microglia macrophages (GSE1432)) [61] or
LPS (genes upregulated at 4h following stimulation of human dendritic cells (GSE14000)) [62]
(S8 Table). For these four immune response gene sets, the highest overlap determined by Jac-
card similarity index was reported with genes that were AS03-modulated at day 1 in neutro-
phils, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Approximately half of the core AS03-responsive genes
overlapped with each of these four gene sets (S8 Table). Fifteen of the 80 transcripts were not
present in any of the significantly enriched Immunologic Signatures gene sets (S8 Table). These
potentially novel immune system-related genes are comprised of both protein coding and non-
coding genes, including pseudogene, lncRNA, and antisense RNA transcripts.
Non-human transcriptomic studies have utilized animal models to investigate the response
to adjuvants by sampling injection site muscle tissue and draining lymph nodes for gene mod-
ulation following adjuvant treatment [19–21]. The highest overlap with cytokine genes identi-
fied by Morel et al. 24h after injection of AS03 was observed at day 1 in monocytes, dendritic
cells and neutrophils from our study, and included upregulation of CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2,
CXCL9, CXCL10 (IP-10), IL-1β, PTGS2, and TNF-α (Fig A214 in S2 Text). Of the 168 genes
reported by Mosca et al. as differentially expressed in response to MF59 adjuvant treatment,
105 genes mapped to MGI mouse annotations with human orthologs, and 87 genes were
uniquely mapped in Ensembl. Approximately 50% of these 87 genes were upregulated and
10% were downregulated in response to AS03-adjuvanted compared to unadjuvanted H5N1
vaccine in our data set (Fig A215 in S2 Text). The highest overlap of these 87 genes with our
DE set was detected at day 1 in monocytes (20 genes), neutrophils (18 genes) and dendritic
cells (15 genes). Nine primarily interferon-responsive genes (FCGR1A, GBP4, IFI44L, IFIT2,
IFIT3, IRF7, ISG15, PARP14, RNF213) overlapped with the 80 core AS03-responsive genes in
our study.
AS03-Adjuvanted Vaccine Gene Responses Correlated with Cytokine
and Antibody Responses
To determine if and when cell type-specific gene responses correlated with serological
responses, we performed canonical correlation analysis separately for each post-vaccination
day. Our results identified strong, positive correlations between upregulated gene responses
and changes in IP-10 cytokine concentration in the SV-AS03 group at day 1 in neutrophils,
monocytes, and DC (Fig 10, and Figs A152, A155, and A158 in S2 Text). To a lesser extent,
these positive correlation patterns were observed also for changes in MIP-1-α concentration.
However, unlike IP-10, the serum response for MIP-1-α was not strong enough to induce a
noticeable shift in median fold change (Fig 2D). Most strikingly, at day 3, changes in IP-10
concentration were strongly correlated with changes in NK cell gene responses in the
SV-AS03 but not the SV-PBS group (Fig 11). Identified genes were upregulated from baseline,
formed three robust gene clusters, and were primarily involved in cell proliferation (Fig 4C,
Table A68 and Fig A105 in S2 Text). High positive correlation with increased IP-10 levels
were observed for positive changes in CDC6 and CDC45 (DNA replication initiators) as well as
E2F transcription factor expression in NK cells. To assess correlations with antibody response,
these models included both changes in Nt (for all post-vaccination days) and HAI (for day 28

inhibition, Nt: microneutralization inhibition). The strength of the correlation is encoded by the distance from the center of the circle as well as
by the angle between variables when viewed as vectors originating from the center. An acute angle (<90˚) between variables represents a
positive correlation, an obtuse angle (>90˚) indicates a negative correlation, while a right angle is observed for zero correlation. Thus,
maximum correlation is achieved when variables are closely placed together in the outer circle (or directly opposed on the outer circle.

 as no variation was observed for earlier time points). The analysis did not identify noticeable
antibody correlations for the early post-vaccination time points. However, at day 28, several
genes were identified that were moderately positively correlated with HAI and Nt responses in
the SV-AS03 group including GPR133 (significantly downregulated for SV-AS03 relative to
SV-PBS) and TMEM176A (upregulated) in NK cells (Fig A164 in S2 Text) as well as miRNA
AC027319.1, lncRNA RP11-66D17.3, and processed pseudogene RP11-229P13.2, which were
all downregulated in B cells (Fig A151 in S2 Text).
Early Gene Responses Differentiate between Seroprotection Status
To determine which early (day 1) cell type-specific gene responses best predict seroprotection
status at day 56 (HAI titer � 1:40), we performed logistic regression analysis. Results are sum-
marized in S9 Table. Many of the selected predictive genes are known to play a role in the
immune system, in particular, cytokine signaling (source: Reactome) [43]. STAT1 was identi-
fied to predict seroprotection for all six immune cell types. In all cases, increased expression
resulted in increased odds for achieving seroprotection. The same was true for IRF1 in all cell
types except monocytes. Increased expression of PARP9, which induces the expression of IFN-
γ-responsive genes, predicted seroprotection in all cell types except monocytes and B cells.
IRF9, another transcription factor that mediates signaling by type I IFNs, was a predictor of
seroprotection in neutrophil, NK and T cell models and had the highest impact on the odds
for achieving seroprotection in the latter two cell types. FCGR1A and FCGR1B, molecules that
are known to bind the Fc region of IgG, were identified as positive predictors of seroprotection

 in neutrophil and monocyte models. For B cells, increase in expression of a non-functional IG
D gene (IGHD4-23) had the highest positive impact on the odds for seroconversion, while
expression of CAMSAP1L1, a gene associated with epilepsy [63, 64], had the highest negative
impact. In summary, while predictive models differed between immune cell types, early up-
regulation of genes involved in interferon signaling positively impacted the likelihood of
achieving later seroprotection. However, given the small sample size, the predictive ability of
these immune cell-specific models needs to be validated in the context of future studies.
Discussion
Adjuvants enhance the immunogenicity of avian influenza vaccines, but the mechanisms by
which they drive this function are poorly understood in humans. We conducted a randomized,
controlled, Phase I clinical trial to comprehensively analyze transcriptomic responses to an H5N1
vaccine administered either with or without the AS03 adjuvant in six immune cell types isolated
from human peripheral blood to begin to dissect cell-specific mechanisms of adjuvant action.
Nearly all subjects who received the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine achieved seroconversion and sero-
protection at day 56. No subject in the unadjuvanted group achieved seroconversion or seropro-
tection. In the following, based on our peripheral blood immune cell-specific gene expression and
cytokine results, we summarize key molecular immune events that differentiated AS03-adjuvanted
H5N1 vaccination from unadjuvanted vaccination (a visual summary is provided in Fig 12).
At early time points after the first vaccination, SV-AS03 induced upregulation of early-
response genes involved in interferon signaling, some of which were predictive of seroprotec-
tion. These differential innate transcriptomic responses were similar to early responses
observed after influenza infection [65]. Three of the five genes detected in all six immune cell
types at day 1 in the adjuvanted vaccine group were also identified in the study by Loo et al.
[65], which assessed the role of RIG-I signaling during influenza A viral infection of mouse
fibroblasts [65]. The RIG-I signaling pathway is known to alert cells to the presence of viral
products, especially viral RNA, and to trigger expression of alpha/beta interferons, which in
turn activate interferon inducible genes [65]. In our studies, both RIG-I related pathways and
alpha/beta interferon signaling were significantly enriched in core AS03-responsive genes at
day 1 (neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells). Additionally, substantial overlap of our
data with previously published immunological response gene sets, including vaccination with
live attenuated virus vaccines, infection (viral or bacterial), cytokine signaling, and LPS stimu-
lation, suggests that the majority of genes differentially expressed in response to AS03-adju-
vanted vaccine are also induced by other immunological events.
One explanation for the early transcriptional signatures that we observed could be that
addition of AS03 to vaccine preparations results in a “pseudo-infection” in which induction of
cytokine production at the injection site recruits and activates local immune cells. In support
of this idea, comparative analysis of the gene sets published by Ramilo et al. [66]. and Ioannidis
et al. [67]. in their studies of infections with influenza and other infectious agents, as well as
other studies of live-virus vaccines [59] or stimulation of immune cells with live virus [60],
revealed a strong overlap with genes identified in our study at day 1 in neutrophils, monocytes,
dendritic cells, and our 80 core AS03-responsive genes, and to a lesser extent with NK cells
and T cells (S8 Table). Additionally, compared to the gene sets published by Nakaya et al. in
their systems study of the response to seasonal influenza vaccines [68], our data set shows a
stronger overlap with LAIV-induced genes compared to TIV-induced genes, most notably in
neutrophils and monocytes at day 1 (S8 Table). While we observed that AS03 modulated mul-
tiple interferon-inducible genes in all cell types, we did not observe a strong differential signal
for the genes encoding α/β interferons themselves in any cell type, as has also been reported

 recently in a study with AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine [22]. Nevertheless, genes encoding for
the interferon receptor for interferon alpha/beta (IFNAR) were slightly upregulated in mono-
cytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils from the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group at day 1 (Figs
A118-A120 in S2 Text). Additionally, differential results showed that many genes in the JAK/
STAT pathway were upregulated in the adjuvanted group, resulting in an upregulation of clus-
ters of interferon inducible genes, particularly in monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils
(Fig 4, S4 and S5 Tables, and Figs A118-A120 in S2 Text). Neutrophils showed a prolonged
response up to day 3, with a cluster of interferon induced genes reaching their peak at this
time (Fig 4). For monocytes and dendritic cells, but not neutrophils, SOCS3 [69, 70], a nega-
tive regulator that inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by STAT genes, was signifi-
cantly upregulated at day 1, potentially explaining the short-lived response in these cell types
(S4 Table and Figs A118 and A119 in S2 Text). Although our data do not indicate whether
this activation is direct, indirect, or a combination of both, taken together, the data suggest
that AS03 in combination with the split-virus avian vaccine acts to promote an early, innate
response that may mimic infection, thus impacting activation and gene expression within neu-
trophils, monocytes and dendritic cells.

 Our data indicate that AS03 induces class I antigen processing and presentation in multiple
cell types after vaccination, as expected given that all cell types can potentially present antigen
in the context of MHC class I. Additionally, we found that genes involved in controlling MHC
class II-restricted antigen processing and presentation pathways were differentially expressed
in monocytes and neutrophils following AS03-adjuvanted vaccination relative to unadju-
vanted vaccination. Monocytes are known to function as APC under inflammatory conditions.
However, our results show that neutrophils also increased expression of MHC class II (HLAs)
genes and other molecules associated with antigen processing and presentation following vac-
cination with AS03-adjuvanted vaccine (Fig 7). Evidence is emerging that suggests neutrophils
may participate in MHC class-II-restricted antigen processing and presentation; however,
their ability to serve as APCs is currently debated [71–76]. Several previous studies administer-
ing adjuvanted vaccines in animal models have shown that although neutrophils are recruited
to the site of vaccination, take up antigen, and subsequently traffic to the draining lymph
nodes, they may be dispensable for generation of protective antibody responses [77, 78]. In
fact, the study by Yang et al. suggests that neutrophils may act as a “rheostat” for antigen pre-
sentation and signaling after the delivery of adjuvanted vaccines by sequestering antigen away
from professional APCs and thus dampening the level of antigen presentation. It is important
to note that neither of these earlier studies utilized AS03 as an adjuvant, although Calabro et al.
utilized MF59 [77], another oil-in-water adjuvant. Thus, increased MHC activity in neutro-
phils in response to AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccination could function to either increase or
decrease antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells, depending on whether neutrophils
play an active or regulatory role in MHC class II antigen processing and presentation. Addi-
tional studies are needed to determine the potential role that neutrophils may play in antigen
presentation following AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccination[71].
NK cells demonstrated increased expression of cell activation genes in the SV-AS03 vaccine
group at day 3, which likely implies a more rapid expansion of these lymphocytes in response
to the adjuvanted vaccine (Fig 6). These gene expression changes in NK cells were highly cor-
related with changes in serum IP-10 concentration, with the strongest correlations observed
for CDC6 and CDC45. CDC6 expression is limited to proliferating cells and is regulated by E2F
transcription factors, which were also upregulated and correlated with IP-10 [79]. These results
imply a causal relationship in which AS03 in combination with the split-virus triggers IP-
10-mediated NK cell proliferation via upregulation of co-expressed gene modules. IP-10 is a
known chemoattractant and activator of NK cells [80–84]. Accordingly, expression of the
receptor for IP-10 (CXCR3) was increased in NK cells from the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine
group (Fig A216 in S2 Text). Additionally, while initially identified as MHC class-II related
genes, the kinesins (Reactome pathway; KIF2C, KIF15, KIF18A, KIF20A, KIF23) modulated by
AS03 at day 3 in NK more likely play a role in cell division, as multiple modules of prolifera-
tion- and cell division-related genes were identified in this cell type at this time point. These
data suggest that NK cells were activated in response to SV-AS03 vaccination. However, NK
cells typically function in the context of infection, where they are recruited to the site of infec-
tion and actively kill infected cells. The role that these cells might play in response to adju-
vanted avian influenza vaccine remains to be determined.
NK cells from the SV-PBS group exhibited a significant increase in expression of MHC
class-II related genes at day 28, the only significant increase in MHC class-II related genes in
any cell type in the unadjuvanted vaccine group at any time point (Fig 7). While not consid-
ered classical APC, NK cells have been previously reported to upregulate MHC class-II and
present antigen to T cells [85–87]. Subjects receiving unadjuvanted vaccine did not achieve
seroprotection; however, H5-specific antibody titers were increased relative to baseline, sug-
gesting that low-level immune induction occurred. In support of this theory, Gillard et al. have

 previously shown that a 2-dose prime regimen with 3.75mcg of split-virus H5N1 vaccine (A/
Vietnam/1194/2004) without adjuvants led to cross-reactive seroprotection following a second
2-dose boost regimen with a heterologous 3.75mcg split-virus unadjuvanted H5N1 vaccine
(A/Indonesia/5/2005) administered 6 months later [88]. Accordingly, the monocyte and neu-
trophil time trend responses that we observed to accompany early upregulation of MHC class-
II responses in those cell types in the SV-AS03 group were also increased slightly at day 28 in
the unadjuvanted vaccine group (Fig 4). These data suggest that following unadjuvanted low-
dose H5N1 vaccine, the cell types and mechanisms utilized for class-II antigen presentation
may be different, and the magnitude and kinetics of the immune response delayed, compared
to that obtained following AS03-adjuvanted vaccine. These observations will need to be
confirmed.
The cytokine findings, similar to transcriptomic data, indicate that AS03 modulated early
innate responses (day 1 and day 3). IP-10 and IL-6 showed a significant differential response
between vaccine groups, with both cytokines displaying higher responses for the SV-AS03
group at day 1, consistent with previous studies [19, 22]. IP-10 also sustained an increased,
albeit a weaker, response at day 3 post-vaccination. Consistent with serum cytokine levels,
monocytes and dendritic cells in the SV-AS03 group showed significant upregulation of
CXCL10, the gene encoding IP-10, at day 1 (S4 Table). The lack of a differential gene response
in any cell type and the low concentration of IFN-γ in serum cytokine measurements at days 1,
3, and 7 after vaccination implies that either this cytokine did not play a role in modulating
early innate responses, that the IFN response was driven by type I IFNs, or, more likely, that
the IFN response occurred transiently and/or locally and was not captured by our study time
points/blood immune cell selection [19]. Our immune cell-specific predictive models of sero-
protection did show that an early upregulation of genes related to IFN signaling increased the
likelihood of later seroprotection. In this regard, an increase in STAT1 expression was predic-
tive of seroprotection for all six immune cell types.
Additional studies will be required to confirm the observed immune cell responses, impli-
cated pathways, and predictive ability of the presented models. Additionally, as both vaccine
groups received the H5N1 split-virus, a distinction between immune responses against AS03
and split-virus antigens was not possible. The small sample size of 10 subjects in each group also
limits the generalizability of our results. However, our study highlights the strengths of assessing
transcriptomic responses of multiple individual immune cell types in parallel. By including
additional baseline measurements, we increased the robustness of fold change estimates. The
use of RNA-Seq enabled more sensitive determination of responses at the transcriptional level
than is possible using microarrays. Furthermore, the granular information that we obtained
might have been lost by an assessment of mixed populations of immune cells such as whole
blood or PBMC. For example, our cell-based analysis clearly shows that SV-AS03 vaccination
induced stronger MHC-II representation-related gene responses in neutrophils compared to
DC and monocytes (Figs A106-108 in S2 Text), and NK cell-specific proliferation (Fig 6).
Other than the absence of plasma cell-related gene signatures in our data, likely reflecting the
lack of pre-exposure levels in our subjects to H5N1 influenza, which has not been detected in
humans in the US [2], our findings generally overlap with the recently published study by Sobo-
lev et al., which also noted an increase in blood monocytes, as well as interferon- and antigen
presentation-related gene expression signals 24h after immunization with the AS03-adjuvanted
H1N1 pandemic vaccine [22]. However, by assaying individual cell types, our study identified
more precisely the cellular sources of these and other gene signatures. In summary, our findings
demonstrate that application of a cell-based systems approach reveals potentially novel mecha-
nisms of action for the AS03 adjuvant, including up-regulation of antigen processing and pre-
sentation genes in neutrophils and induction of cellular proliferation processes that correlated
