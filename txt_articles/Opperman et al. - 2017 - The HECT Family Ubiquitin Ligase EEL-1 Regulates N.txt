In Brief
Genetic changes in the HECT ubiquitin
ligase EEL-1/HUWE1 are associated with
intellectual disability. Using C. elegans,
Opperman et al. show that EEL-1/HUWE1
is required for GABAergic presynaptic
transmission and excitatory/inhibitory
(E/I) transmission balance. These findings
have potentially important implications
for the link between HUWE1 and
intellectual disability.

SUMMARY
Genetic changes in the HECT
ubiquitin ligase
HUWE1 are associated with intellectual disability,
but it remains unknown whether HUWE1 functions
in post-mitotic neurons to affect circuit function.
Using genetics, pharmacology, and electrophysi-
ology, we show that EEL-1, the HUWE1 ortholog in
C. elegans, preferentially regulates GABAergic pre-
synaptic transmission. Decreasing or increasing
EEL-1 function alters GABAergic transmission and
the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in the worm
motor circuit, which leads to impaired locomotion
and increased sensitivity to electroshock. Further-
more, multiple mutations associated with intellectual
disability impair EEL-1 function. Although synaptic
transmission defects did not result from abnormal
synapse formation, sensitizing genetic backgrounds
revealed that EEL-1 functions in the same pathway
as the RING family ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 to regulate
synapse formation and axon termination. These find-
ings from a simple model circuit provide insight into
the molecular mechanisms required to obtain E/I
balance and could have implications for the link be-
tween HUWE1 and intellectual disability.
INTRODUCTION
GABA (g-aminobutyric acid) is the principal inhibitory neuro-
transmitter in the mammalian brain and in the simple motor
circuit of the nematode C. elegans. In both cases, inhibition by
GABA is necessary to achieve a balance of excitatory and inhib-
itory transmission that is required for proper circuit function and
behavior (Gatto and Broadie, 2010; Zhen and Samuel, 2015). Im-
balances in the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio is a central feature
of many neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, epi-
lepsy, and intellectual disability (Gatto and Broadie, 2010; Ru-
benstein and Merzenich, 2003).
The motor circuit of C. elegans relies on a precise balance of
cholinergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition of body wall
muscles to generate locomotion (Zhen and Samuel, 2015). This
model circuit has been tremendously useful for understanding
the molecular mechanisms of presynaptic transmission (Barclay
et al., 2012). Recent studies have begun to explore the molecular
mechanisms that regulate E/I balance in the worm motor circuit,
which remain poorly understood (Cherra and Jin, 2016; Jospin
et al., 2009; Kowalski et al., 2014; Stawicki et al., 2011; Vash-
lishan et al., 2008). Over the past decade, this simple circuit
has also emerged as a valuable tool for understanding the mo-
lecular and cellular mechanisms that affect neurodevelopmental
disorders such as epilepsy and autism (Bessa et al., 2013).
The HECT, UBA and WWE domain-containing protein 1
(HUWE1) is a homologous to E6AP c-terminus domain (HECT)
family ubiquitin ligase with growing genetic links to intellectual
disability. Increased copies of HUWE1 are associated with
non-syndromic intellectual disability (Friez et al., 2016; Froyen
et al., 2008, 2012; Madrigal et al., 2007). Missense mutations in
HUWE1 occur in multiple families with intellectual disability,
including families with Juberg-Marsidi-Brooks syndrome (Friez
et al., 2016; Froyen et al., 2008; Isrie et al., 2013). This suggests
that both increased and decreased HUWE1 function could be
associated with intellectual disability, but evidence from an
in vivo model system supporting or refuting this possibility re-
mains absent.
Huwe1 functions in early development of the nervous system
by regulating neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation
(Forget et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2008). This function of Huwe1
is critical for laminar patterning of the cortex (Zhao et al.,
2009). In the hippocampus, Huwe1 regulates neural stem cell
quiescence (Urba
´ n et al., 2016). Huwe1 also ubiquitinates and
degrades Mitofusin, an important regulator of mitochondrial
fusion (Leboucher et al., 2012). In C. elegans, there is a single
ortholog of HUWE1 called enhancer of EFL mutant phenotype
1 (EEL-1), which has primarily been studied in embryonic
development (Page et al., 2007). EEL-1 was recently shown to
affect neuroblast migration, indicating that EEL-1 and Huwe1
are conserved regulators of neural progenitors (de Groot et al.,
2014).

 Whether Huwe1 or EEL-1 have roles in post-mitotic neurons,
affect synaptic transmission, or impact circuit function remains
largely unexplored. Given mounting genetic evidence linking
HUWE1 and intellectual disability, addressing these issues using
model circuits has become increasingly necessary. Experiments
in worms and flies hinted at expanded functions for EEL-1 and
HUWE1 in the nervous system beyond early development. A
C. elegans RNAi screen with the drug aldicarb, a pharmacolog-
ical inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, implicated
EEL-1 in
neuronal function at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Sieburth
et al., 2005). In flies, ectopic expression of human HUWE1 results
in aberrant axon branch formation in the dorsal cluster neurons
(Vandewalle et al., 2013).
We have explored the function of EEL-1 using the motor circuit
of C. elegans. Our results indicate that EEL-1 is expressed
broadly in the nervous system, including both the excitatory
cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons, but prefer-
entially affects presynaptic GABAergic transmission. Reduced
GABAergic transmission in eel-1 mutants impairs locomotion
and increases sensitivity to electroshock-induced paralysis,
which can be reversed by the anticonvulsant drug retigabine.
Furthermore, decreasing or increasing EEL-1 function causes
opposing effects on GABAergic transmission. These observa-
tions suggest that EEL-1 is required to obtain E/I balance in
a simple, well defined model circuit. Although defects in
GABAergic transmission are not due to failed synapse formation,
analysis of different types of neurons with sensitizing genetic
backgrounds uncovered a less prominent EEL-1 function in syn-
apse formation and axon termination. Our results indicate that
eel-1 functions in the same genetic pathway as the regulator of
presynaptic morphology 1 (rpm-1), an intracellular signaling
hub and RING family ubiquitin ligase that regulates synapse
and axon development (Grill et al., 2016). These findings expand
our understanding of how EEL-1 functions in the nervous system
and indicate that EEL-1 regulates GABAergic presynaptic trans-
mission and is required for E/I balance in a simple model circuit.
RESULTS
Both Decreased and Increased EEL-1 Activity Alter
Motor Neuron Function
The C. elegans motor circuit uses acetylcholine (ACh) as an
excitatory neurotransmitter. The cholinergic motor neurons
innervate the body wall muscles and stimulate muscle contrac-
tion. GABA is the inhibitory transmitter in the worm motor circuit,
and GABAergic motor neurons stimulate muscle relaxation.
Locomotion is thought to arise from cholinergically mediated
contraction and GABA-induced relaxation on opposing sides
of the animal (Zhen and Samuel, 2015)
The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb is a classic phar-
macological assay of motor neuron function (Barclay et al.,
2012). Application of aldicarb to an animal reduces ACh hydroly-
sis in the synaptic cleft of the NMJ. This leads to ACh accumula-
tion, overstimulation of ACh receptors on muscles, and eventual
paralysis. Previous studies identified RNAi targets and mutants
that are resistant to inhibitors of cholinesterase (Ric) (Miller
et al., 1996; Sieburth et al., 2005) and mutants that are hypersen-
sitive to inhibitors of cholinesterase (Hic) (Loria et al., 2004; Vash-
lishan et al., 2008). The Ric phenotype is often caused by a
reduction in ACh exocytosis leading to delayed paralysis. In
contrast, two types of impairments can result in Hic phenotypes:
enhanced ACh release from cholinergic motor neurons, resulting
in more rapid paralysis, and reduced inhibitory GABAergic trans-
mission to muscles, which causes E/I imbalance and more rapid
paralysis.
The Kaplan lab previously showed that feeding animals bacte-
ria expressing eel-1 RNAi results in a moderate Ric phenotype
(Sieburth et al., 2005). Using the same RNAi-sensitizing genetic
background, eri-1; lin-15B, we observed similar results (Figures
1B and 1C). In contrast, eel-1 RNAi resulted in the opposing
phenotype, hypersensitivity to aldicarb, when a higher-sensi-
tivity RNAi strain, uIs57; lin-15B, was used (Figures 1D and 1E;
Calixto et al., 2010).
To address these contradictory findings with RNAi, we tested
two eel-1 null mutants, ok1575 and zu462 (Figure 1A). Both eel-1
mutants were hypersensitive to aldicarb (Figures 1F and 1G).
This phenotype was rescued by transgenic expression of
EEL-1 using a native eel-1 promoter or pan-neuronal promoter
but not with expression of the negative control GFP (Figures
2A and 2B). Thus, expression of EEL-1 in neurons is sufficient
to rescue hypersensitivity to aldicarb caused by eel-1 (lf).
Because increased cholinergic or reduced GABAergic func-
tion results in a Hic phenotype, we tested cell-specific promoters
for rescue. Expression of EEL-1 with a GABAergic motor neuron
promoter rescued aldicarb hypersensitivity in eel-1 mutants (Fig-
ures 2C and 2D). Rescue did not occur with promoters for the
cholinergic motor neurons or muscles (Figures 2C and 2D).
We noted in rescue experiments that a subset of transgenic
arrays, which can have variable levels of expression, showed
resistance to aldicarb (Figure S1). Therefore, we tested how aldi-
carb responses are affected by transgenic overexpression of
EEL-1 in wild-type animals. As shown in Figures 2E and 2F, over-
expression of EEL-1 using a pan-neuronal driver caused mild
resistance to aldicarb (Figures 2E and 2F). Overexpression with
a GABAergic promoter also resulted in aldicarb resistance. In
contrast, overexpression of negative control proteins (GFP or
mCherry) had no effect.
These results show that loss and gain of EEL-1 function in
GABAergic motor neurons produces opposing aldicarb effects.
Thus, EEL-1 is both necessary and sufficient for the aldicarb
response. These results are consistent with EEL-1 being
required to achieve E/I balance in the motor circuit.
EEL-1 Regulates Presynaptic Transmission in
GABAergic Motor Neurons
To explore the physiological mechanism underpinning EEL-1 ef-
fects on the aldicarb response, we turned to electrophysiology.
To isolate GABAergic function, we recorded neuromuscular
transmission by patch-clamping muscle cells in the presence
of tubocurarine, an Ach receptor blocker (Richmond and Jorgen-
sen, 1999). eel-1 mutants had reduced frequency of GABAergic
miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (Figures 3A
and 3B). mIPSC amplitude was mildly reduced in eel-1 mutants
(Figures 3A and 3B). mIPSC frequency defects were rescued by
an integrated transgene, bggIs16, that uses the native promoter
to express EEL-1 (Figures 3C and 3D). Defects in mIPSC

 amplitude trended toward rescue but were not significant (Fig-
ures 3C and 3D). These results indicate that EEL-1 is required
for presynaptic GABAergic transmission but do not rule out the
possibility of a modest effect on postsynaptic function.
To assess cholinergic transmission, analysis was done in the
absence of the GABA receptor (UNC-49) to ensure that only
excitatory cholinergic transmission was recorded. unc-49;
eel-1 mutants had no difference in cholinergic miniature excit-
atory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency or amplitude
compared with unc-49 single mutants (Figures 3E and 3F).
Therefore, EEL-1 regulates presynaptic transmission at the
GABAergic, but not the cholinergic, NMJ.
EEL-1 Is Expressed in the GABAergic Motor Neurons
and Localizes to the Presynaptic Terminal
Our results with aldicarb pharmacology and electrophysiology
indicate
that
EEL-1
regulates
synaptic
transmission
in
GABAergic motor neurons but not cholinergic motor neurons.
To test whether this simply reflects eel-1 expression patterns,
we generated transgenic animals that express GFP using the
eel-1 promoter. Peel-1::GFP was observed in non-neuronal tis-
sue (pharynx, intestine, and vulva; Figures S2A–S2C) and was
strongly expressed in neurons, including numerous neurons in
the head (Figure 4A), motor neurons (Figures 4B and 4C), mecha-
nosensory neurons (Figures 4D and 4E), HSN neurons (Fig-
ure S2D), and tail neurons (Figure S2E). GFP was detected in
cholinergic (Figure 4B) and GABAergic motor neurons (Fig-
ure 4C). No expression was observed in muscle (data not
shown). These results support our finding that EEL-1 regulates
GABAergic
transmission.
Further,
expression
of
eel-1
in
GABAergic and cholinergic motor neurons is consistent with
EEL-1 being required to maintain E/I balance in the motor circuit.
Broad eel-1 expression in the nervous system leaves open the
possibility that EEL-1 could regulate synaptic transmission in
other types of neurons.
Next we analyzed the localization of EEL-1 in GABAergic motor
neurons. We generated transgenic animals that simultaneously
carry an integrated transgene that expresses Synaptobrevin-
1::GFP
and
an
extrachromosomal
array
that
expresses
mCherry::EEL-1. SNB-1::GFP and mCherry::EEL-1 were ex-
pressed with a GABAergic promoter. EEL-1 colocalizes with
SNB-1 at the GABAergic presynaptic terminal (Figure 4F; Fig-
ure S3).EEL-1 was alsoobservedincellsomatabut not axoncom-

 eel-1 Mutants Have Impaired Locomotion and
Heightened Sensitivity to Electroshock
Our pharmacological and electrophysiological results showed
that eel-1 mutants have impaired GABAergic motor neuron
function. To test how this affects animal behavior, we analyzed
locomotion.
Consistent
with
partially
impaired
GABAergic
transmission, eel-1 (lf) animals displayed a mild uncoordinated
phenotype. We assessed locomotion quantitatively by testing
reverse locomotion following harsh head touch and analyzing
forward locomotion during spontaneous exploration using
Multi-Worm Tracker (MWT).
Following harsh touch, eel-1 mutants reversed as frequently
as wild-type animals (Figure S4), but the distance they reversed
was significantly reduced (Figure 5A). Reverse locomotion

 defects were rescued by transgenic EEL-1 expressed with a
native eel-1 or pan-neuronal promoter (Figure 5A). eel-1 mutants
did not show the ‘‘shrinker’’ phenotype that occurs when
GABAergic transmission is fully impaired, as in unc-25 mutants
(data not shown).
The forward speed of eel-1 mutants was also significantly
slower than in wild-type animals (Figure 5B). This defect was
rescued by the bggIs16 transgene that expresses EEL-1 using
the native promoter (Figure 5C). These results show that EEL-1
is required for both forward and reverse locomotion. This is
consistent with prior studies showing that GABAergic transmis-
sion regulates forward and reverse locomotion and that partially
impaired GABAergic transmission results in moderate locomo-
tion defects (Petrash et al., 2013).
Another behavior that is sensitive to E/I balance in the worm
motor circuit is electroshock-induced paralysis (Risley et al.,
2016). Electroshock involves the application of voltage to ani-
mals suspended in saline buffer and results in body convulsions
and paralysis. Consistent with prior work, unc-25/GAD mutants
(which
lack
inhibitory
GABAergic
transmission)
displayed
increased electroshock sensitivity with longer time to recovery
(Figure 5D; Risley et al., 2016). Recovery time was also increased
in eel-1 mutants and rescued by bggIs16 (Figure 5D). Pretreat-
ment of eel-1 animals with retigabine (RTG), a potassium channel
agonist and anticonvulsant, rescued electroshock susceptibility
(Figure 5E). RTG most likely activates a potassium channel(s)
that alleviates hyperexcitation of muscles, which results from
reduced GABAergic transmission in eel-1 mutants. These
behavioral results provide further evidence that EEL-1 regulates
GABAergic transmission and is needed for E/I balance.
EEL-1 and Synapse Formation
One possible explanation for reduced GABAergic presynaptic
transmission could be impaired synapse formation in eel-1 (lf)
mutants. To address this, we examined the formation of presyn-
aptic terminals at NMJs made by cholinergic and GABAergic
motor neurons.
The motor neuron cell bodies are on the ventral side of
C. elegans and extend axons that innervate dorsal muscles (Fig-
ures 6A and 6C). Each cholinergic motor neuron extends a single
axon, and individual GABAergic axons bifurcate. Both types of
motor axons form evenly distributed presynaptic connections
along dorsal muscles (White et al., 1976).
NMJ formation was evaluated using transgenes that express
SNB-1::GFP in cholinergic or GABAergic motor neurons. In
wild-type animals, SNB-1 forms puncta at cholinergic and
GABAergic presynaptic terminals that are evenly distributed
along the dorsal cord (Figures 6A and 6C). Cholinergic NMJs
of eel-1 mutants had mild SNB-1 defects with small gaps and
aggregated puncta (Figure 6A). Quantitation showed reduced

 numbers of puncta in eel-1 mutants (Figure 6B). In contrast,
GABAergic motor neurons of eel-1 animals had normal organiza-
tion of SNB-1 puncta (Figures 6C and 6D). Because cholinergic
transmission is normal in eel-1 mutants (Figures 3E and 3F),
these mild defects in cholinergic NMJ organization do not impair
synaptic
transmission.
Normal
organization
of
GABAergic
SNB-1 puncta suggests that defects in GABAergic transmission
in eel-1 mutants are not caused by defective synapse formation
or impaired axon guidance. Normal GABAergic axon guidance
was confirmed for eel-1 mutants using the juIs76 transgene,
which expresses soluble GFP in GABAergic neurons (data not
shown). Previous studies showed that defects in active zone for-
mation also impair SNB-1 organization in motor neurons, further
suggesting that GABAergic synapse formation is largely normal
in eel-1 mutants (Zhen and Jin, 1999).
Disorganized cholinergic presynaptic terminals in eel-1 mu-
tants are reminiscent of defects that occur with loss of function
in rpm-1, an intracellular signaling protein that regulates synapse
formation (Grill et al., 2016; Zhen et al., 2000). Therefore, we
tested the genetic relationship between eel-1 and rpm-1.
Consistent with prior studies, cholinergic motor neurons in
rpm-1 mutants had aggregated SNB-1 puncta and gaps lacking
puncta (Figure 6A; Nakata et al., 2005). Quantitation showed that
rpm-1 mutants have a more severe phenotype than eel-1 mu-
tants, which is not increased in rpm-1; eel-1 double mutants (Fig-
ures 6A and 6B). These results suggest that eel-1 and rpm-1
function in the same genetic pathway to regulate presynaptic or-
ganization of cholinergic NMJs.
Because EEL-1 affects cholinergic synapse formation and
functions in the same pathway as RPM-1, we examined
GABAergic synapse formation more thoroughly using a sensi-
tizing genetic background. Previous studies showed that
FSN-1 mediates a portion of RPM-1 function, and fsn-1 (lf)
mutants have milder synapse formation defects than rpm-1 (lf)
mutants (Figures 6C and 6D; Grill et al., 2007; Liao et al.,
2004). As a result, fsn-1 (lf) can act as a sensitizing background
to reveal enhancer effects on GABAergic synapse formation.
We observed that fsn-1; eel-1 double mutants had more severe
defects in SNB-1 organization than fsn-1 single mutants
(Figure 6D). These results show that fsn-1 and eel-1 function
in parallel genetic pathways to regulate GABAergic synapse
formation.
Next, we tested rpm-1; eel-1 double mutants for defects in
GABAergic presynaptic organization. Double mutants did not
have increased severity of defects compared with rpm-1 single
mutants (Figures 6C and 6D). Thus, eel-1 and rpm-1 function in
the same genetic pathway to regulate GABAergic presynaptic
organization. These results suggest that EEL-1 regulates cholin-
ergic and GABAergic synapse formation by functioning in the
RPM-1 pathway and in parallel to FSN-1.
EEL-1 Regulates Axon Termination and Axon Branch
Formation
Aside from its role in synapse formation, RPM-1 is also an impor-
tant regulator of axon termination (Schaefer et al., 2000). Given
that eel-1 and rpm-1 function in the same pathway to regulate

 synapse formation, we tested whether EEL-1 regulates axon
termination.
Axon termination can be rapidly evaluated in the cholinergic
SAB neurons that innervate head muscles using jsIs42, a trans-
gene with cell-specific expression of SNB-1::GFP (Figure S5A).
In wild-type animals, SNB-1 forms puncta at presynaptic termi-
nals along SAB axons and at axon termination sites (Figure S5A).
Axon termination defects occurred at moderate frequency in
eel-1 mutants (Figures S5A and S5B). Small ectopic axon
branches, often referred to as sprouts, were also observed in
eel-1 mutants (Figures S5A and S5B). In some instances, axon
termination and ectopic branch defects occurred in the same
SAB axon (Figure S5A).
Consistent with prior work (Schaefer et al., 2000), rpm-1 (lf)
mutants displayed axon termination and ectopic axon branch
defects that were similar to, but more frequent than, eel-1 mu-
tants (Figures S5A and S5B). The frequency of termination and
branch defects did not increase in rpm-1; eel-1 double mutants
(Figure S5B). Similar results were observed for the anterior lateral

 mechanosensory neurons (Figure S6), which is consistent with
eel-1 expression in these cells (Figures 4D and 4E). These results
using two different types of neurons indicate that eel-1 and
rpm-1 function in the same genetic pathway to promote axon
termination and inhibit ectopic axon branching.
Next we wanted to test whether eel-1 functions cell-autono-
mously in SAB neurons to regulate axon development. As shown
in Figure S5C, transgenic expression of EEL-1 using an SAB pro-
moter significantly rescued ectopic axon branch defects and
axon termination defects. In contrast, rescue did not occur
with the negative control mCherry (Figure S5C). Thus, eel-1 func-
tions cell-autonomously in SAB neurons to regulate axon termi-
nation and branch formation.
In mammals, Huwe1 ubiquitinates and inhibits N-Myc to regu-
late neuronal progenitor proliferation (Zhao et al., 2008, 2009). To
test whether EEL-1 regulates axon termination through a similar
mechanism, we generated double mutants of eel-1 with the sin-
gle worm homolog for the Myc and Mondo transcription factors
called Myc/Mondo-like 1 (MML-1). Because MML-1 functions in
a complex with MXL-2, the ortholog of mammalian Mxl, we also
tested eel-1; mxl-2 double mutants. Our analysis relied on previ-
ously described null alleles of mml-1 and mxl-2. Axon termina-
tion defects and ectopic branch defects in eel-1 mutants were
not suppressed in eel-1; mml-1 or eel-1; mxl-2 double mutants
(Figure S5D). Because suppression would be expected if
MML-1/Myc were ubiquitinated and inhibited by EEL-1, these re-
sults suggest that EEL-1 is unlikely to regulate axon develop-
ment via this mechanism.
Mutations Associated with Intellectual Disability Result
in Loss of eel-1 Function
At present, seven different missense mutations in HUWE1 are
associated with intellectual disability, and several mutations
affect residues conserved in C. elegans EEL-1 (Friez et al.,
2016; Froyen et al., 2008). Two of these mutations are shown
in Figure 1A. The functional consequences of these mutations
remain unknown. We tested whether EEL-1 containing disor-
der-associated mutations can rescue defects caused by eel-1
(lf). Unlike wild-type EEL-1, transgenic EEL-1 R2991H (which
corresponds to HUWE1 R2981H) failed to rescue axon termina-
tion and axon branch defects in eel-1 mutants (Figure S5C). This
suggests that EEL-1 R2991H is a loss-of-function mutation.
It is possible that disorder-associated mutations might impair
EEL-1 in some contexts but not others. Therefore, we tested
whether transgenic EEL-1 containing disorder-associated muta-
tions can rescue the aldicarb hypersensitivity of eel-1 mutants.
Although transgenic expression of wild-type EEL-1 robustly
rescued aldicarb hypersensitivity, rescue was not observed
with EEL-1-containing, disorder-associated mutations R2991H
(which corresponds to HUWE1 R2981H) or R3990C (which corre-
sponds to HUWE1 R4187C) (Figure 7). Thus, the results from two
different in vivo assays indicate that mutations in HUWE1 associ-
ated with intellectual disability result in loss of eel-1 function.
DISCUSSION
EEL-1 is a HECT family ubiquitin ligase orthologous to mamma-
lian HUWE1. Copy number increases and missense mutations in
HUWE1 are associated with intellectual disability. Previous work
showed that Huwe1 regulates neurogenesis and migration of
neural progenitors.
Our findings with genetic, pharmacological, and electrophys-
iological approaches now indicate that EEL-1 regulates presyn-
aptic transmission in GABAergic motor neurons. Furthermore,
our results show that EEL-1 is required to obtain E/I balance
in the worm motor circuit. eel-1 mutants have defective locomo-
tion and increased sensitivity to electroshock, consistent with
impaired GABAergic transmission and E/I imbalance. We also
observed that mutations in HUWE1 associated with intellectual
disability result in loss of EEL-1 function in the context of
GABAergic transmission. These findings expand our under-
standing of the molecular mechanisms required to establish E/I
balance in a simple model circuit and could have important impli-
cations for the link between HUWE1 and intellectual disability.

 EEL-1 Regulates Inhibitory, GABAergic Presynaptic
Transmission
We used the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb to pharma-
cologically assess motor circuit function in eel-1 mutants. eel-1
(lf) mutants are hypersensitive to aldicarb, and transgenic
animals overexpressing EEL-1 display the opposing pheno-
type—aldicarb resistance (Figures 1 and 2). Thus, decreasing
or increasing EEL-1 activity alters motor circuit function. Trans-
genic rescue and overexpression experiments show that
EEL-1 functions cell-autonomously in GABAergic motor neurons
to affect aldicarb sensitivity. Although our results suggest
that the aldicarb hypersensitivity of eel-1 (lf) mutants is un-
likely to stem from defects in synapse or axon development
of GABAergic motor neurons, a more thorough analysis of
GABAergic NMJs will be needed to entirely rule this out. None-
theless, our results indicate that reduced GABAergic transmis-
sion in eel-1 mutants leads to E/I imbalance in the motor circuit
and aldicarb hypersensitivity.
We confirmed this interpretation of aldicarb results using elec-
trophysiology. eel-1 (lf) mutants have a reduced frequency of
GABAergic mIPSCs (Figure 3A). The amplitude of GABAergic
mIPSCs was also mildly but significantly reduced in eel-1 mu-
tants. These results indicate that EEL-1 predominantly affects
presynaptic GABAergic transmission. In contrast, both the fre-
quency and amplitude of cholinergic mEPSCs are unchanged
in eel-1 mutants, indicating that cholinergic transmission is unaf-
fected by eel-1 (lf). These pharmacological and electrophysio-
logical data allow us to conclude that reduced inhibitory
GABAergic input to muscles in eel-1 mutants leads to a net in-
crease in E/I ratio from the motor circuit. Impaired GABAergic
transmission in eel-1 (lf) mutants is likely to explain why these an-
imals have behavioral abnormalities, including reduced locomo-
tion and increased electroshock sensitivity.
Although EEL-1 functions in GABAergic motor neurons to
regulate aldicarb hypersensitivity and presynaptic transmission,
EEL-1 does not function exclusively in these neurons. EEL-1 is
expressed in both GABAergic and cholinergic motor neurons
(Figure 4). This suggests that EEL-1 is required to obtain motor
circuit E/I balance rather than being required exclusively for
GABAergic transmission. Broad nervous system expression
also suggests that EEL-1 might regulate neurotransmission in
other neurons.
EEL-1 colocalizes with SNB-1, suggesting that EEL-1 could
regulate GABAergic transmission locally (Figure 4F). Consistent
with this, Huwe1 associates with the synaptic proteasome in
cultured neurons (Tai et al., 2010). Further evidence that EEL-1
ubiquitin ligase activity might regulate synaptic transmission
stems from two observations: both eel-1 deletion alleles result
in loss of the HECT ubiquitin ligase domain (Figure 1A), and a dis-
order-associated point mutation in the HECT domain, R3990C,
impairs EEL-1 function (Figure 7). However, ubiquitin ligase-in-
dependent mechanisms cannot be ruled out because a mutation
outside of the HECT domain (R2991H) also impairs EEL-1
function.
At present, little is known about ubiquitin ligases that regulate
presynaptic transmission in vivo. In mice, Scrapper degrades
RAB3 interacting molecule (RIM) to inhibit presynaptic transmis-
sion (Yao et al., 2007). Parkin and the anaphase promoting com-
plex (APC) regulate presynaptic transmission at the fly and worm
NMJ (Kowalski et al., 2014; van Roessel et al., 2004; Vincent
et al., 2012). Notably, Scrapper, Parkin, and the APC are RING
family ubiquitin ligases. Our findings now show that a HECT
ubiquitin ligase, EEL-1, preferentially regulates GABAergic
transmission.
EEL-1 and Synaptic Transmission: Implications for
HUWE1 and Intellectual Disability
The worm motor circuit requires E/I balance for proper func-
tion, which makes this model circuit valuable for studying
the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neurodevelopmental
disorders (Bessa et al., 2013). Our results indicate that
EEL-1 is required for GABAergic presynaptic transmission
and E/I balance in the motor circuit. Like the worm motor cir-
cuit, GABA is inhibitory in the mammalian brain. The obvious
caveats of our simple system aside, if HUWE1 is a conserved
regulator
of
GABAergic
transmission,
then
increased
or
reduced HUWE1 function might affect E/I balance in the brain.
This could have important implications for HUWE1 and intel-
lectual disability because E/I imbalances occur in many neuro-
developmental disorders (Gatto and Broadie, 2010; Ruben-
stein and Merzenich, 2003).
Increased copies of HUWE1 are associated with intellectual
disability, and missense mutations in HUWE1 are associated
with intellectual disability as part of Juberg-Marsidi-Brooks
syndrome. An explanation for how differing HUWE1 genetic
changes lead to intellectual disability remains absent. Using
in vivo neuronal assays, we have shown that two mutations
associated with intellectual disability impair eel-1 function
(Figure 7). The mutated residues are identical in EEL-1 and
HUWE1, suggesting that they are likely to result in loss of
HUWE1 function. Nonetheless, these mutations are presumably
hypomorphic in some contexts (for example, early neurogenesis)
because Huwe1 knockout is lethal (Zhao et al., 2009). Overex-
pression of EEL-1 in GABAergic motor neurons results in
altered motor circuit function and resistance to aldicarb. Thus,
copy number increases in HUWE1 could potentially affect
GABAergic transmission. If increased and reduced HUWE1
function are associated with intellectual disability, HUWE1 would
join SHANK3 and MECP2 as genes with both gain- and loss-of-
function changes associated with intellectual disability (Zoghbi
and Bear, 2012).
Our previous work showed that impaired GABAergic transmis-
sion caused by unc-25/GAD (lf) results in E/I imbalance in the
motor circuit and increased sensitivity to electroshock (Risley
et al., 2016). eel-1 (lf) mutants also have increased electroshock
sensitivity, consistent with reduced GABAergic transmission
(Figure 5D). This defect is suppressed by the anticonvulsant
RTG, an agonist for KCNQ2/3 voltage-gated potassium chan-
nels in mice and flies (Barrese et al., 2010). Although it is unclear
how RTG rescues eel-1 mutants, one possibility is that RTG re-
lieves hyperexcitation in eel-1 mutants by stimulating potassium
channels. Given that electroshock is often used to study seizure
in different systems and keeping in mind the limitations of our
worm electroshock assay, it is noteworthy that subsets of indi-
viduals with genetic changes in HUWE1 experience seizures
(Froyen et al., 2008, 2012).

 eel-1 and rpm-1 Function in the Same Pathway to
Regulate Neuronal Development
EEL-1 and Huwe1 are single-subunit ubiquitin ligases of the
HECT family. The HECT family includes Ube3a, Nedd4, and
Smurf, which have important roles in neuronal development (Am-
brozkiewicz and Kawabe, 2015; Yamada et al., 2013). Previous
work showed that EEL-1 and Huwe1 regulate neural progenitor
proliferation and migration (de Groot et al., 2014; Forget et al.,
2014; Zhao et al., 2009). We have explored the role of EEL-1 in
later developmental events, such as synapse formation and
axon termination.
Axon termination defects in SAB neurons and mechanosen-
sory neurons were the most prevalent developmental defects
we observed in eel-1 (lf) mutants (Figures S5 and S6). Small
ectopic axon branches, referred to as sprouts, were also
observed in the SAB neurons of eel-1 (lf) mutants. Previous
work showed that transgenic overexpression of Huwe1 results
in ectopic axon branching in flies (Vandewalle et al., 2013). Our
findings and this prior work indicate that decreasing or
increasing EEL-1/Huwe1 function can affect axon termination
and branching.
We examined presynaptic organization in cholinergic and
GABAergic motor neurons of eel-1 (lf) mutants. As mentioned
earlier, GABAergic presynaptic organization was normal in
eel-1 mutants (Figures 6C and 6D). We observed mild defects
in cholinergic motor neurons, which did not impair cholinergic
transmission.
Thus,
EEL-1
figures
more
prominently
in
GABAergic transmission and has a minor role in presynaptic
organization in cholinergic motor neurons. Although our results
indicate that motor neuron synapse formation is largely normal
in eel-1 mutants, they do not rule out the possibility subtle
defects
in
presynaptic
terminals
could
affect
GABAergic
transmission.
Axon termination defects and cholinergic presynaptic organi-
zation defects in eel-1 mutants were similar, but milder, than
what occurs in rpm-1 mutants. Therefore, we explored the ge-
netic relationship between eel-1 and rpm-1 in synapse and
axon development. Previous work established RPM-1 and or-
thologous Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) proteins as regulators
of synapse and axon development (Grill et al., 2016). RPM-1 is
an intracellular signaling hub that regulates several downstream
pathways (Baker et al., 2014; Grill et al., 2007, 2012; Nakata
et al., 2005; Tulgren et al., 2014). Our analysis indicates that
fsn-1, an F box protein that mediates a portion of RPM-1
signaling, functions in a parallel pathway with eel-1 to regulate
GABAergic synapse formation and axon termination (Figures
6C and 6D; Figure S6). Like other fsn-1 enhancers, eel-1 func-
tions in the same genetic pathway as rpm-1. These genetic re-
sults are consistent with EEL-1 and RPM-1 localizing to
GABAergic presynaptic terminals (Figure 4F; Zhen et al., 2000).
Work using non-neuronal cells showed that the RPM-1 ortho-
log Pam/MYCBP2 can function in a ubiquitin ligase complex with
Huwe1 (Yin et al., 2010). Our genetic results suggest that RPM-1
could function in one complex with EEL-1 and in a different
complex with FSN-1. Prior evidence indicates that RPM-1 can
function through two mechanisms, RPM-1/FSN-1 ubiquitin
ligase activity and RPM-1 recruitment of the PPM-2 phospha-
tase, to restrict the DLK-1 mitogen activated protein kinase
kinase kinase (MAP3K) (Baker et al., 2014; Nakata et al., 2005).
Thus, RPM-1 might utilize FSN-1 and EEL-1 as different mecha-
nisms to regulate DLK-1 or other molecules in the DLK-1/PMK-3
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
Another potential link between EEL-1 and RPM-1 is b-catenin
signaling. EEL-1 regulates neuroblast migration by inhibiting the
Wnt effector protein Dishevelled, which regulates b-catenin (de
Groot et al., 2014). RPM-1 regulates axon termination and syn-
apse formation by binding to the Nesprin ANC-1 and regulating
b-catenin signaling (Tulgren et al., 2014). Therefore, RPM-1
and EEL-1 might function in the same genetic pathway because
they both affect b-catenin signaling.
Genetic and molecular links between RPM-1 signaling and
neurodevelopmental disorders have begun to emerge. For
example, Pam regulates the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC),
which is linked to tuberous sclerosis and autism (Han et al.,
2012; Murthy et al., 2004). Microduplications and microdeletions
that include Fbxo45, the ortholog of FSN-1, are associated with
neurodevelopmental disorders (Grill et al., 2016). Our findings
now provide in vivo genetic evidence from a model system link-
ing the RPM-1 signaling network to eel-1, a gene associated with
intellectual disability.
Conclusions
Our results with a simple model circuit indicate that EEL-1 regu-
lates presynaptic GABAergic transmission. This EEL-1 function
is required for proper locomotion, affects sensitivity to electro-
shock, and provides important insight into the molecular mech-
anisms required to establish E/I balance. Our findings could also
have important implications for the link between EEL-1 and
intellectual disability, which is heightened by our observation
that mutations associated with intellectual disability lead to
loss of EEL-1 function in neurons in vivo. Although we have
learned much about the electrophysiological and cellular mech-
anisms by which EEL-1 regulates GABAergic transmission, an
intriguing and challenging future goal will be understanding the
molecular mechanisms by which EEL-1 regulates GABAergic
transmission.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Further details and expanded methods can be found in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Strains and Genetics
The C. elegans N2 isolate was propagated and maintained using standard pro-
cedures. The alleles used included eel-1 (zu462), eel-1 (ok1575), rpm-1 (ju44),
rpm-1 (ok364), fsn-1 (gk429), goa-1 (n363), ric-3 (md158), unc-4 (e120), mml-1
(ok849), mxl-2 (tm1516), and unc-49 (e407). The integrated transgenic strains
used included jsIs42 [Punc-4SNB-1::GFP], nuIs152 [Punc-129SNB-1::GFP], juIs1
[Punc-25SNB-1::GFP], muIs32 [Pmec-7GFP], juIs76 [Punc-25GFP], and bggIs16
[Peel-1EEL-1].
We sequenced to confirm the nature of the lesions in ok1575 and zu462.
ok1575 is a 1,637-bp deletion that removes intronic and exonic sequences.
Failed splicing in ok1575 is likely to create a premature stop, resulting in loss
of more than 50% of the EEL-1 sequence, including the HECT ubiquitin ligase
domain (Figure 1A). zu462 is an inverted duplication that results in a large dele-
tion and insertion of 5,884 bp. zu462 disrupts the eel-1 reading frame, leads to
36 amino acids of non-sense sequence and a stop codon, and results in a trun-
cated protein lacking a HECT domain (Figure 1A).

 Transgenics
Transgenic animals were generated using standard microinjection proced-
ures. Extrachromosomal transgenic arrays were constructed by injecting
animals with the plasmid or PCR product of interest, Pttx-3RFP (50 ng/mL) or
Pmyo-2mCherry (1 ng/mL) as coinjection marker, and pBluescript (25–
90 ng/mL) to normalize injections to 100 ng/mL total DNA. For eel-1 promoter
expression, shown in Figure 4, pha-1(e2123) was used as a temperature-sen-
sitive positive selection marker. The precise composition of injection mixtures
and genotypes of animals used in this study are annotated in Table S1. The
transgenic line bggIs16 [Peel-1EEL-1] was generated by UV/4,50,8-trimethyl-
psoralen (TMP) integration of bggEx117. bggIs16 was outcrossed seven
times to N2 worms and mated to eel-1 (zu462) for rescue experiments.
bggEx117 was generated by injecting Peel-1EEL-1 (pBG-GY550, 75 ng/mL),
Pmyo-2mCherry (1 ng/mL), and pBluescript (25 ng/mL).

by

transgenic
animals
carrying
juIs1 [Punc-25SNB-1::GFP] with the following plasmid mixture: pBG-GY656
(Punc-25mCherry::EEL-1, 40 ng/mL), pBG-GY322 (Pmyo-2mCherry, 1 ng/mL),
and pBlueScript (60 ng/mL). Two independent lines were isolated and
analyzed: bggEx125; juIs1 and bggEx126; juIs1.
Aldicarb Assay
Nematode growth media (NGM) plates with aldicarb (Aldicarb-Pestanal,
Sigma) and a spot of OP-50 E. coli were warmed to room temperature
for 3 hr prior to experimentation. Animals (blinded for genotype) were indi-
vidually touched on the posterior body to assess movement every 15 min.
Animals were considered paralyzed when no body or head movement was
detected. Initially, for analysis of eel-1 RNAi and mutants, 1 mM aldicarb
was used. To more accurately separate differences in hypersensitivity for
different
genotypes,
subsequent
experiments
were
performed
with
0.5 mM aldicarb because this lower concentration enhanced the sensitivity
of aldicarb responses. Prior to the aldicarb assays, all strains were grown
at 23�C.
Forward Speed during Exploratory Locomotion
C. elegans locomotion was assessed as described previously (Giles et al.,
2015). Briefly, C. elegans were cultivated at 23�C, and synchronized adults
were placed on NGM agar plates without E. coli and allowed to spontane-
ously explore for 5 min. Behavioral recordings of this exploration were taken
using an adapted version of MWT. Centroid speed during periods of forward
locomotion was measured during the final minute of observation. The
average speed of �30 worms was measured at a time on one plate and
considered a single data point; six to nine plates were tested per strain.
Some mutants had a significantly smaller body length than the wild-type,
which could affect absolute speed. To control for this, speed was standard-
ized to body length. Only absolute speed is presented because similar results
were observed when standardized. In-depth details regarding forward loco-
motion analysis with MWT analysis can be found in the Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures.
Electrophysiology
Electrophysiological recordings were performed as described previously
(Gao and Zhen, 2011). The intracellular solution contained K-gluconate,
115 mM; KCl, 25 mM; CaCl2, 0.1 mM; MgCl2, 5 mM; 1, 2-bis (o-aminophe-
noxy) ethane-N, N, N0, N0-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), 1 mM; HEPES, 10 mM;
Na2ATP, 5 mM; Na2 guanosine triphosphate (GTP), 0.5 mM; cyclic AMP
(cAMP), 0.5 mM; and cyclic GMP (cGMP), 0.5 mM (pH 7.2 with potassium hy-
droxide [KOH], 320 mOsm). The extracellular solution contained NaCl,
150 mM; KCl, 5 mM; CaCl2, 5 mM; MgCl2, 1 mM; glucose, 10 mM; sucrose,
5 mM; and HEPES, 15 mM (pH 7.3 with NaOH, 330 mOsm). GABAergic
mIPSCs were recorded in the presence of 0.5 mM d-tubocurarine in the extra-
cellular solution to block cholinergic receptors while holding the membrane
at �10 mV so GABAergic mIPSCs appeared as outward currents (Maro
et al., 2015). Cholinergic mEPSCs were recorded in the background of
unc-49 (e407), a loss-of-function mutation in the GABA receptor, while hold-
ing the membrane at �60 mV. All experiments were performed at room tem-
perature (20�C–22�C).
Electroshock Assay
The electric shock procedure was performed as described previously (Risley
et al., 2016). 1-day-old adult C. elegans (approximately 10 animals/electro-
shock assay) were incubated for 30 min with or without retigabine and
subjected to electric shock for three seconds (204 Hz, 47 V). Videos were
manually scored to quantify the time needed to recover from electroshock.
The Supplemental Experimental Procedures contain further details.
Analysis of Developmental Phenotypes
Young adult animals were anesthetized using 2% (v/v) 1-phenoxy-2-propanol
in M9 buffer. Synchronized young adults were analyzed for cholinergic motor
neurons (nuIs152) and GABAergic motor neurons (juIs1), whereas non-syn-
chronized young adult animals were analyzed for SAB neurons (jsIs42) and me-
chanosensory neurons (muIs32). Analysis with nuIs152, juIs1, and jsIs42 was
done on worms grown at 25�C, and analysis with muIs32 was done on worms
grown at 23�C. jsIs42 animals were visualized using 633 magnification, and
muIs32, juIs1 and nuIs152 animals were visualized using 403 magnification
oil immersion and an epifluorescence microscope (Leica CRF 5000). Images
of anesthetized animals were taken using a charge-coupled device (CCD)
camera (Leica DFC345 FX). Image analysis was performed using Leica Appli-
cation Suite for Advanced Fluorescence (LAS-AF) software. For nuIs152 and
juIs1, images from the dorsal cord were measured using LAS-AF software,
and the number of SNB-1::GFP puncta were manually scored using Adobe
Photoshop.
Confocal Microscopy
Animals were paralyzed in 5 mM levamisole. Confocal imaging was done using
a Leica TCS SP8 MP confocal microscope system in resonant mode with a
403 water immersion lens (HC PL APO 403/1.10 CS2). Images were acquired
using the Leica acquisition software with a 2–103 zoom factor. ImageJ
(version 1.50d) was used to process the images. For presentation of confocal
stacks, either a single slice was used, or the maximum intensity projection was
used as noted. Further details are available in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Reported are original Student’s t test values. In cases where multiple compar-
isons were performed, Bonferroni corrections were tested, and in all cases
statistical significance was maintained. For detailed statistical methods, see
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
