IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is underused, especially among vulnerable
populations. Decision aids and patient navigation are potentially complementary
interventions for improving CRC screening rates, but their combined effect on screening
completion is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine the combined effect of a CRC screening decision aid and patient
navigation compared with usual care on CRC screening completion.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized clinical trial, data were collected
from January 2014 to March 2016 at 2 community health center practices, 1 in North Carolina
and 1 in New Mexico, serving vulnerable populations. Patients ages 50 to 75 years who had
average CRC risk, spoke English or Spanish, were not current with recommended CRC
screening, and were attending primary care visits were recruited and randomized 1:1 to
intervention or control arms.
INTERVENTIONS Intervention participants viewed a CRC screening decision aid in English or
Spanish immediately before their clinician encounter. The decision aid promoted screening
and presented colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing as screening options. After the
clinician encounter, intervention patients received support for screening completion from a
bilingual patient navigator. Control participants viewed a food safety video before the
encounter and otherwise received usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was CRC screening completion within
6 months of the index study visit assessed by blinded medical record review.
RESULTS Characteristics of the 265 participants were as follows: their mean age was 58 years;
173 (65%) were female, 164 (62%) were Latino; 40 (15%) were white non-Latino; 61 (23%)
were black or of mixed race; 191 (78%) had a household income of less than $20 000; 101
(38%) had low literacy; 75 (28%) were on Medicaid; and 91 (34%) were uninsured.
Intervention participants were more likely to complete CRC screening within 6 months (68%
vs 27%); adjusted-difference, 40 percentage points (95% CI, 29-51 percentage points). The
intervention was more effective in women than in men (50 vs 21 percentage point increase,
interaction P = .02). No effect modification was observed across other subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A patient decision aid plus patient navigation increased the
rate of CRC screening completion in compared with usual care in vulnerable primary care
patients.

olorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of can-
cer death in men and women in the United States.1 Al-
though non-Hispanic whites have experienced de-
clines in CRC incidence and mortality, other racial/ethnic
minority groups have not experienced similar declines.2 Co-
lorectal cancer screening is effective at reducing CRC mortal-
ity, and expert groups, including the US Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) recommend CRC screening with several
testing options.3-5 The US National Colorectal Cancer Round-
table, a coalition of public, private, and volunteer organiza-
tions, has set a goal of increasing US screening rates to 80%
by2018,anambitioustargetthatwouldhaveasubstantialpub-
lic health impact.6,7 Unfortunately, screening remains under-
used,especiallyamongvulnerablepopulations,includingthose
with Medicaid, no health insurance, low educational attain-
ment, limited English proficiency, and members of racial/
ethnic minority groups.8-14 Screening rates among Latinos, the
largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States, are
substantially lower than in the general population.9,13,15,16 To
increase CRC screening nationally, interventions that ad-
dress multiple patient- and system-level screening barriers are
needed, particularly in care settings where diverse, vulner-
able populations are served.
Accumulating evidence suggests that offering patients a
choice of screening options, particularly a choice that includes
fecal occult blood testing or fecal immunochemical testing
(FOBT/FIT)inadditiontoprimaryendoscopicscreening,maybe
especially important for increasing screening in vulnerable
populations.17-20Colorectalcancerscreeningdecisionaidspro-
vide a structured tool for offering such a choice to patients and
havebeenconsistentlyshowntoincreasepatientknowledgeof
CRC screening, stated intent to complete screening, and CRC
screeningtestordering.21However,theireffectonactualscreen-
ingcompletionhasgenerallybeenlimited,indicatingthatthere
areotherimportantbarrierstoscreeningcompletionthatarenot
addressed by decision aids alone.
Patient navigation represents another promising interven-
tion, and several studies have found it to be effective in help-
ing vulnerable patient populations to overcome barriers to rec-
ommended cancer screening, including CRC screening.22-27
However, the absolute effects of navigation on screening rates
are often modest in size.24,28-31
Decision aids and patient navigation represent potentially
complementaryinterventionsforpromotingCRCscreeningbe-
cause they address multiple barriers that affect different steps
in the screening process. Decision aids act “proximally” in the
screening process to enhance patients’ initial awareness of
screening, promote patient-clinician communication, build in-
tent,andclarifypreferences.Patientnavigationactsmore“dis-
tally” to address other (often practical) barriers to CRC screen-
ing completion that vulnerable patient populations face once
anindividualdecidestobescreened.Aninterventionthatcom-
bines a decision aid and patient navigation has potential to be
highlyeffective.However,toourknowledge,nostudyhastested
an intervention combining a decision aid with patient naviga-
tion to improve CRC screening.
The objective of this study was to test, in a randomized
clinical trial (RCT), the effect of a combined intervention that
included visit-based delivery of a CRC screening decision aid
plus patient navigation vs usual care on CRC screening test
completion among patients in a primary care safety net set-
ting. We hypothesized that the intervention would increase
screening completion compared with usual care.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
Details of trial design, setting, eligibility, enrollment, inter-
ventions, and measures have been published previously in our
protocol article and intermediate outcomes analysis.32,33 (The
trial protocols are provided in the Supplement.) Briefly, this
RCT tested a 2-component intervention including a patient de-
cision aid (delivered immediately before the clinician encoun-
ter) and patient navigation (delivered after the clinician
encounter).32 Participants were recruited from 2 community
health centers, 1 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and 1 in Char-
lotte, North Carolina. The sites serve diverse low-income com-
munities including substantial numbers of Latino patients and
had baseline CRC screening rates of approximately 35%. The
study was approved by the institutional review boards at the
University of North Carolina, the University of New Mexico,
and Carolinas HealthCare System. Data were collected from
January 2014 to March 2016, and analyzed in 2016.
Recruitment and Enrollment
We recruited participants ages 50 to 75 years who spoke Eng-
lish or Spanish, were at average CRC risk (no personal or fam-
ilyhistoryofCRC,polyps,orinflammatoryboweldisease),were
notup-to-datewithrecommendedCRCscreening,andhadup-
coming appointments. Bilingual research assistants/patient
navigators (“navigators”) contacted potentially eligible pa-
tients either before an upcoming visit or on the day of the visit
to invite them to participate. Participants received a $40 in-
centive, and provided written informed consent.
Study Activities and Randomization

Key Points
Question Compared with usual care, what is the effect of an
intervention combining a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
decision aid and patient navigation on CRC screening completion
in a diverse, vulnerable primary care population?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 265
patients, the rate of CRC screening completion at 6 months was
greater in the intervention arm (68%) than in the control arm
(27%), a significant difference.
Meaning Given the substantial effect on screening, efforts to
understand how this kind of intervention can be more broadly
implemented are warranted.

from navigators. After randomization, navigators (no longer

viewed in the waiting area or examination room on a handheld
computertabletbeforetheclinicianencounter.Aftertheencoun-
ter, intervention participants received patient navigation; con-
trol participants received usual care.
Decision Aid
Development and testing of the English and Spanish lan-
guage decision aids are described in detail elsewhere.34-38
Briefly, the videos are approximately 15 minutes long and con-
sist of 3 parts: (1) overview of importance of CRC screening and
review of fecal testing (FOBT/FIT) and colonoscopy; (2) head-
to-headcomparisonofscreeningtestoptions(afterwhichview-
ers are asked to consider which test features are important to
them); and (3) selection of a colored brochure corresponding
to their screening readiness.
Patient Navigation
Thepatientnavigationinterventionisdescribedinthepublished
protocolarticle.32Briefly,patientnavigators(2ateachsite,with
a total of 0.75 full-time equivalent/site) were employees of the
clinic or its affiliated health system with previous training as
medicalassistants,socialworkers,ormaster’
sdegree–levelpub-
lichealthprofessionals.Theyreceivedapproximately6hoursof

after their clinician encounter and assisted in carrying out the
screeningplan.Supportwastailoredbasedonindividualpatient
factors,includingpreferredteststrategy(FOBT/FITorcolonos-
copy), screening barriers, and stage of readiness for screening.
Navigators were also able to offer and distribute FOBT/FIT kits
usingstandingorders.Aftertheinitialpostencounterconversa-
tion, navigators periodically tracked intervention participants
and attempted to contact unscreened participants at roughly
2-week intervals until participants refused, completed screen-
ing, or were deemed unreachable (after 5 attempts).
Main Outcome Measures
The primary study outcome was completion of a CRC screen-
ing test within 6 months after the initial study visit. Screen-
ingtestcompletionwasassessedthroughelectronichealthrec-
ord (EHR) review conducted independently by 2 investigators
(R.L.R. and R.H. at the New Mexico site; A.M. and H.T. at the-
North Carolina site) who were masked to study arm assign-
ment and resolved discrepancies by consensus. Patients were
considered current with screening if there was evidence of
completion of a recommended CRC screening test.3
Power Calculations
Assumingthatscreeningstatuswouldbeassessedforatleast90%
ofenrolledparticipantsanda20%screeningrateamongcontrols,
we calculated that a total sample of 250 would provide at least
90% power to detect a 20% difference in the primary outcome
between the groups using a 2-sided 5% significance level.
Statistical Analysis
We used intention-to-treat analysis, including all partici-
pants in their assigned study arm. We used Mantel-Haenszel
weights to estimate differences across study arms, adjusted for
site. We explored subgroup differences and tested for inter-
actions using a generalized linear model with identity link and
binomial variance function.
Other Outcomes
To provide additional data regarding intervention implemen-
tation beyond what is published previously,32,33 we reviewed
the patient navigation logs, and describe, semiquantitatively,
the findings regarding decision aid video viewing, telephone
contacts, FOBT/FIT distribution, and barriers addressed. We
also summarize screening test results from participant labo-
ratory and/or pathology reports.
Results
Figure 1 shows the flow of study participants. We contacted
670 patients with upcoming primary care appointments who
were 50 to 75 years old and without evidence of current CRC
screening in their EHRs. Of these, 161 declined to participate,
180 were ineligible, and 64 did not keep or cancelled their ap-
pointment, leaving 265 who were randomized. One partici-
pant was excluded from the intervention after randomiza-
tion by his or her clinician (for medical comorbidity) but was
included in analysis. We had primary outcome data (from EHR
review) on all 265 randomized participants.
Participant characteristics (Table) include a mean age of
58 years; 173 (65%) were female; 164 (62%), Latino; 40 (15%),
non-Latino white; and 61 (23%), non-Latino black or mixed
race. Spanish was the preferred language in 118 (45%). Most
(191 [78%]) reported a household income of less than $20 000;
101 ( 38%) had limited health literacy,39 75 (28%) had Medic-
aid, 67 (25%) had Medicare, and 91 (34%) were uninsured. Re-

black, 39 (39%) were Latino, and 12 (12%) were non-Latino
white. Participants at the New Mexico site were more likely to
have Medicaid than those in North Carolina (57 of 164 [35%]

wise similar across sites.

Intervention participants were more likely to complete a CRC
screening test within 6 months of the index visit: 68% (54%
FOBT/FIT, 14% colonoscopy) in the intervention arm (n = 133)
vs 27% (21% FOBT/FIT, 6% colonoscopy) in controls (n = 132)

 Implementation Findings
Pre–clinician encounter activities, including consent, baseline
survey,andvideoviewing,tookapproximately45minutes.Most
participantsviewedtheirassignedvideoinitsentirety(interven-
tion group, 88%; controls, 95%). Navigators reported that clin-
icsoftenranbehindschedule,allowingparticipantstocomplete
videoviewing.Regardingnavigatorcontact,42interventionpar-
ticipants completed screening without additional contact after
theindexvisit.Navigatorshadatleast1additionalcontact(usu-
ally by phone) with 79 intervention participants, of whom 48

monbarrierstoscreeningwerecompetinghealthpriorities,for-
getting about the stool tests, the time required to complete
screening, and losing the FOBT/FIT kit.
Screening Test Results
Among 100 study participants who completed FOBT/FIT, 5 re-
sults (5%) were positive. Among the 28 study participants who
underwent colonoscopy either as the primary screening test
or for follow-up of an abnormal FOBT/FIT test result, 19 (18 had
a primary colonoscopy; 1 had follow-up) had normal or hyper-
plastic polyps, 5 had 1 to 2 small adenomas (low risk), and 3
had 3 or more adenomas or large (≥ 1 cm) adenoma or villous
histologic abnormalities (high-risk adenomas) (2 had a pri-
mary colonoscopy; 1 had follow-up). One intervention partici-
pant who underwent primary screening colonoscopy
was found to have stage 0 (in situ) adenocarcinoma within a
large, pedunculated polyp. Three participants with positive
FOBT/FIT results did not complete a diagnostic colonoscopy:
1 who became critically ill with bowel obstruction (not due to
CRC) and 2 who refused despite multiple entreaties from their
primary care clinicians.
Discussion
We found that an intervention that combines a patient deci-
sion aid shown before a primary care encounter and practice-
based patient navigator support delivered after the encoun-
ter substantially increased CRC screening test completion
compared with usual care in a diverse, vulnerable primary care
patientpopulation.Theinterventionwasbroadlyeffective,im-
proving screening completion across multiple subgroups
known to have low CRC screening rates, including those with
low-income, Spanish-speaking Latinos, those with low edu-
cation levels, and those with Medicaid insurance.40-44

 Severalfactorslikelycontributedtotheeffectivenessofthe
intervention, driven mainly by increasing FOBT/FIT (although
colonoscopy also increased). First, as our previously published
intermediatestudyfindingsshowed,33thedecisionaidcompo-
nent of the intervention successfully mitigated several “proxi-
mal” barriers to CRC screening by increasing screening-related
knowledge of test options, intent, and clinician-patient discus-
sions(includingdiscussionofbothFOBT/FITandcolonoscopy).
This is consistent with observational studies showing that CRC
screeningpreferencesamongUScliniciansoftendifferfromthose
ofpatientsandthatcliniciansoftenfailtoofferstooltesting,in-
stead tending to simply recommend colonoscopy.20,45-47
Second, the patient navigation component was apparently
successfulinaddressingmore“distal”barrierstoCRCscreening
completion,includingnotconsistentlyreceivingFOBT/FITkits
fromclinicstaff,losingorforgettingtocompleteFOBT/FITs,and
difficulties scheduling colonoscopy. Although we are unable to
separatetherelativecontributionsofthedecisionaidandpatient
navigationcomponents,ourobservedeffectsizeisconsiderably
larger than has been shown in studies of either decision aids or
patientnavigationalone.Arecentmeta-analysis21foundthatCRC
screeningdecisionaidsalonetypicallyincreasescreeningbyonly
about8percentagepoints.Inaddition,whiletrialsofpatientnavi-
gationhavebeenpromisingatimprovingactualtestcompletion
in vulnerable populations, the effect sizes have generally been
smalltomoderate,rangingfrom2to15percentagepoints.24-27,31
Our findings of a 40-percentage point increase in screening
completionsupportourhypothesisthatdecisionaidsandpatient
navigation are complementary.32
Third, we suspect that the visit-based approach to patients
who were due for screening contributed to the effectiveness of
thisintervention.Previousstudies24,48-50havefoundthatnon–
visit-based approaches to delivering decision aids (eg, mailing
and/or phone outreach) lead to low uptake of the materials. For
manypatients,particularlythoseinvulnerablegroupsforwhom
cancerscreeningmaynotbesalientduringtheirday-to-daylives,
anoptimaltimetodeliverthedecisionaidisduringprimarycare
visits. This allows care team members to facilitate viewing and
tohelppatientsactontheirenhancedintentandinformedpref-
erences.Furthermore,wesuspectthatthevisit-basedapproach
caused patients to perceive that the intervention was endorsed
bytheirclinician.Thisisconsistentwithstrongobservationalevi-
denceshowingthatclinicianrecommendationisastrongandin-
dependentpredictorofCRCscreening.51-55Ourdatasupportthe
ideathatsuchteam-basedinterventions,whichincludebutare
not dependent on the clinician, can promote effective delivery
ofchronicandpreventivecareservicesinacarecontextinwhich
the primary care clinician is often overwhelmed with compet-
ing demands.56,57
Our study reinforces the importance of offering FOBT/FIT
testing and extends the findings of Inadomi et al,20 who found
that offering FOBT/FIT as a screening option substantially in-
creasesCRCscreeningcompletion.Ourtrialdifferedfromtheone
by Inadomi et al20 in several important ways. First, their study
was conducted in a unique care context in which colonoscopy
access was guaranteed to underinsured patients, colonoscopy
wait times were reduced to 2 weeks or less, and transportation
barriers were mitigated. Our trial was conducted in a care con-
textthatismorereflectiveofUScommunityhealthcentersgen-
erally.Second,thestudybyInadomietaldidnotuseanexplicit
patient decision aid to leverage patient preferences regarding
screening.Infact,theiroriginalhypothesiswasthatofferingpa-
tients a choice of screening strategies would actually reduce
screeningadherencebyintroducingconfusionanduncertainty.
Third,theirstudydidnotusepatientnavigationperse,although
the bilingual research assistants functioned at times as de facto
navigators(eg,byensuringdeliveryandassistingwithreturnof
FOBT/FIT) and helping with colonoscopy transportation.
Althoughourinterventionwaseffective,thefeasibilityofits
widespread implementation remains unclear. The primary ob-
jectiveofthisstudywastotesttheeffectivenessofthecombined
interventiononscreeningcompletion.Weassessedimplemen-
tationonlyobservationally,makingthisatype1“effectiveness-

was spent on research-related activities, including consent and
survey delivery; however, partitioning these activities from in-
terventionactivities(eg,decisionaiddeliveryorpostencounter
navigation) is challenging. In practice, research-related activi-
tieswouldbeunnecessary.Furthermore,someinterventionac-
tivitiescouldbedistributedamongclinicalsupportstaff,consti-
tuting only a portion of an individual’

with optimized work distribution, additional resources may be

Ourstudyhasmethodologicstrengths.TheRCTdesign,masked
primary outcome assessment, intention-to-treat analysis, and
complete primary outcome data reduce risk of bias. Our study
also has limitations. First, our design did not allow assessment
ofindependenteffectsoftheinterventioncomponents.Second,
patient-level randomization could have affected usual care by
clinicians,althoughthiswouldlikelyhavebiasedfindingstoward

Our study has implications for clinical practice and policy.
The USPSTF recently issued new screening guidelines essen-
tially recommending any of several acceptable screening tests.
Their guidelines recommend “engaging patients in informed
decision making about the screening strategy that would most
likely result in completion….”4 Our study provides empirical
trial evidence supporting the provision of structured patient

 ing completion as part of a “medical home” strategy to in-
crease uptake of this high-value clinical preventive service.
Conclusions
We have shown that this intervention substantially increases
CRC screening completion rates in diverse, vulnerable
patients, and does so in a way that acknowledges and lever-
ages informed patient preferences. Broader implementation
will require that primary practices have the resources to sys-
tematically identify patients due for screening and deliver
the intervention components. To substantially increase rates
of CRC screening in the United States, payment models that
allow primary care practices to become true medical homes
are needed.
