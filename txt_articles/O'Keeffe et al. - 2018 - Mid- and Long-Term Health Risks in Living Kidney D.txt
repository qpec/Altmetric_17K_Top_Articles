 Mid- and Long-Term Health Risks in Living Kidney Donors 
 
IN RESPONSE: Our systematic review and meta-analysis involving 52 studies with more 
than 100 000 living kidney donors found that there is no evidence of increased risk for 
adverse psychosocial outcomes, mortality, or major chronic diseases (such as cardiovascular 
disease or type 2 diabetes) among donor compared with nondonor populations. Living kidney 
donation is associated with a higher relative risk for end-stage renal disease and 
preeclampsia, but the absolute risk for these outcomes remains low. 
 
Drs. Mjoen and Holdaas correctly note that the length of follow-up differed among the 
studies included in our meta-analysis of all-cause mortality. The overall mortality estimate 
reported in our review reflects the risk for a median follow-up time (that is, the median length 
of follow-up across the reported studies) of approximately 8 years. However, if mortality 
rates change over time, the overall mortality estimate presented in our review will not 
appropriately reflect the risk for longer follow-up (such as that for ≥10 years). We agree with 
Drs. Mjoen and Holdaas that the relatively short follow-up reported by published studies is a 
limitation of the available evidence and that studies reporting longer-term outcomes for living 
kidney donors are needed. 
  
Drs. Mjoen and Holdaas’ also commented on the possible overlap between the living kidney 
donor population reported in 2 studies (1, 2). We clarify that Segev and coworkers’ study 
included 80 347 donors older than 18 years registered in the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network through the United Network for Organ Sharing between 1994 and 
2009, whereas Berger and colleagues’ study included 219 donors aged 70 to 84 years 
enrolled. in the same registry between 1990 and 2010. Given the partial overlap in the 
 baseline recruitment period between these 2 studies that have used the same living donor 
registry, their populations may have overlapped. However, because fewer than 4% of donors 
included in Segev and coworkers’ study were older than 60 years at baseline, that the 
potential overlap would strongly bias the meta-analysis estimate is unlikely. Indeed, there is 
no meaningful difference in the overall estimate for all-cause mortality with and without 
inclusion of Berger and colleagues’ study in the meta-analysis (risk ratio, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.31 
to 1.10] vs. 0.68 [CI, 0.31 to 1.50], respectively).
