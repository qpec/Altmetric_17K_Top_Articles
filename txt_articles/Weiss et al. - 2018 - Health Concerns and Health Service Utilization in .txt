Introduction
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have core 
deficits in socio-communicative ability and behavior (Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association 2013). In addition, they experi-
ence associated difficulties with health, mental health and 
challenging behaviors, which can lead to increased service 
use. With the increasing prevalence of school-aged youth 
with ASD in recent years, now estimated at 1 in 68 8-year-
olds (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014), 
many are warning of the impending heightened demand for 
adult services (Gerhardt and Lainer 2011). Service needs 
will span across sectors, and invariably involve health care. 
To adequately address future demands, a better understand-
ing of the health needs and health services utilization pat-
terns of young adults with ASD is required. This study used 
administrative health data to document the profile of health 
needs of young adults with ASD and compare it to that of 
typically developing peers and those with other forms of 
developmental disability (DD).
Previous research indicates that individuals with ASD, 
across all ages, are at risk for health problems. A recent 
study by the National Institutes of Mental Health compared 
rates of health problems in 8325 children and youth with 
ASD, 3–17 years of age, to 83,195 controls without ASD, 
based on age, gender, months of enrollment in the health 
care system, having a prescription drug plan, and the type 
of health care system they used (Cummings et al. 2016). 
Patients with ASD were more likely to have a variety of 
chronic medical conditions compared to controls, including 
allergies, epilepsy, and neurological, sleep, autoimmune, 
and endocrine disorders. They were also more likely to 
have received a psychiatric diagnosis of attention deficit-
hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder/conduct 
disorder, anxiety, depression, or other serious mental illness, 
Abstract Individuals with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) have many health needs that place demands on the 
health service sector. This study used administrative data to 
compare health profiles in young adults 18–24 years of age 
with ASD to peers with and without other developmental 
disability. Young adults with ASD were more likely to have 
almost all the examined clinical health issues and health 
service use indicators compared to peers without develop-
mental disability. They were more likely to have at least one 
psychiatric diagnosis, and visit the family physician, pedia-
trician, psychiatrist, and emergency department for psychiat-
ric reasons, compared to peers with other developmental dis-
ability. Planning for the mental health care of transition age 
adults with ASD is an important priority for health policy.

although less likely to have a substance abuse disorder. In 
one of the only large scale studies of health conditions spe-
cifically for adults with ASD, Croen et al. (2015) reported 
higher rates of medical conditions (including gastrointestinal 
problems, sleep issues, immune conditions, seizure disor-
der, hypertension, and diabetes) and psychiatric disorders in 
1507 U.S. adults with ASD aged 18–65 years compared to a 
sex- and age-matched comparison group of patients without 
ASD.
In line with this heightened comorbidity, individuals 
with ASD have higher levels of health service use (Treg-
nago and Cheak-Zamora 2012). For example, Cummings 
et al. (2016) reported that children with ASD were more 
likely than children without ASD to have at least one pedi-
atric visit and more overall visits to the pediatrician, as well 
as specialty care visits, including speech therapy, occupa-
tional or social skills therapy, physical therapy, psychother-
apy, and neurology, within a 1 year period. They were also 
more likely to be hospitalized, have at least one emergency 
department (ED) visit, and be involved as an outpatient in 
hospital care. Higher rates of psychiatric-related visits to the 
ED and hospital admission occur specifically in preadoles-
cents (9–12 years of age) and adolescents (12–18 years of 
age) with ASD compared to controls (Schlenz et al. 2015). 
Higher rates of ED visits for psychiatric and non-psychiatric 
reasons are similarly found for adults with ASD when com-
pared to the general population (Vohra et al. 2016). Children 
with ASD also use more services, and have greater unmet 
needs (including for therapeutic, health care, and family 
support services), compared to children with other special 
health care needs (Benevides et al. 2016; Kogan et al. 2008). 
Even when compared to other children with special health 
care needs who have emotional, developmental, or behavio-
ral problems, children with ASD are reported to have more 
unmet needs for specialty and therapy care (Chiri and War-
field 2012). Individuals with ASD often experience many 
barriers to service receipt across the lifespan, as a result of 
waitlists, a lack of resources, and inadequate service pro-
vider skills (Lai and Weiss 2017).
Understanding patterns of need and service use specifi-
cally in young adults with ASD is important, given that they 
are in the transition period between child and adult health 
care and educational systems (Carbone et al. 2010; Cooley 
and Sagerman 2011; McDermott et al. 2015), a period in 
life often reported to be fraught with crisis and service gaps 
(Cheak-Zamora et al. 2014). Post-high school age youth 
with ASD are noted to experience a large drop in the use 
of mental health, medical, speech therapy and case man-
agement services when compared to when still in the high 
school years (Shattuck et al. 2011). Adults with ASD are 
reported to have greater unmet need across multiple types of 
services than children and youth with ASD (Lai and Weiss 
2017; Turcotte et al. 2016). While we know about medical 
profiles and service use of children with ASD, and there is 
an emerging literature on adults with ASD, there is gap in 
terms of population-based information about young adults 
(Hamdani and Lunsky 2016).
There is one additional limitation to the reviewed litera-
ture. While studies paint a consistent picture of high medical 
and mental health need, and high rates of health care utiliza-
tion in individuals with ASD, relative to the general popu-
lation, this kind of comparison does not consider whether 
the comorbidities in ASD are indeed unique to this popula-
tion, or more endemic of DD generally. Individuals with DD 
without ASD also have greater levels of comorbidities and 
health service use compared to children without such dis-
abilities (Boulet et al. 2009). If heightened rates are indeed 
unique to ASD, this would speak to the need for tailored 
services and health care policies for this population. If these 
rates are common across individuals with many forms of 
DD, this would indicate a need for attention to health care 
policies for a broader array of people with developmental 
concerns, an even larger group than those with ASD alone. 
A comparison to peers without DD can provide a reflec-
tion for what might be expected based on chronological age 
alone, but a DD comparison group can provide a benchmark 
of what might be expected by other individuals with endur-
ing adaptive and cognitive limitations that are also impacted 
by transition periods (Beresford 2004).
Few large-scale studies exist comparing rates of health 
need and health service use in individuals with ASD to 
other DD. Using a population-based register of children up 
to 18 years of age, including those with intellectual disability 
(ID), those with ASD (with and without ID), and those with 
neither condition in Western Australia, Bebbington et al. 
(2013) found that while rates of hospitalization were higher 
in those with ASD than the general population, they were 
not higher than patients with ID only. In contrast, Nayfack 
et al. (2013) compared rates of hospital discharge in children 
1–18 years of age with ASD to rates in children with cer-
ebral palsy, Down syndrome, and to the broader ID category, 
through a retrospective analysis of hospitalizations during a 
10-year period (1999–2009) in California. While there were 
no changes in the annual rate of discharge for cerebral palsy, 
Down syndrome, or the general population, rates increased 
every year for children with ASD. The rise in hospitali-
zations for children with ASD were most pronounced for 
children who did not have ID, and was associated with the 
presence of mental health conditions.
To our knowledge, only one study has examined how 
patterns of health service use may differ in young adults 
with ASD compared to peers with and without DD using 
population-based data, and speaks to the importance of 
questioning whether patterns of health need and health ser-
vice use are specific to ASD or more a factor of broader 
developmental needs. McDermott and colleagues (2015)

compared rates of hospital encounters in adolescents and 
young adults with fragile X syndrome, ASD, and other ID to 
a non-affected comparison group in South Carolina. Young 
adults in all three affected groups were more likely to have 
an inpatient admission, and those with ASD and with ID 
were more likely to visit the ED, compared to the compari-
son group. All three DD groups had higher likelihood for 
hospital admission because of mental illness, a neurologi-
cal condition, epilepsy/seizures, and pneumonia than those 
without DD. Those with ASD and with other ID also had a 
greater likelihood of admission because of a respiratory or 
genitourinary condition. Although this study included dif-
ferent DD groupings, they failed to compare these groups to 
one another. Also, their study of health services focused only 
on ED and inpatient based hospital care, and not outpatient 
health care use.
The current study aimed to compare the patterns of health 
needs and health service use in young adults with ASD com-
pared to both young adults with other DD and to the general 
population. We hypothesized that young adults with ASD 
would have higher rates of common chronic medical condi-
tions and psychiatric diagnoses and greater levels of primary 
care, specialized care, emergency care, and hospitalizations 
compared to young adults with other DD and to young adults 
without any DD.
Methods
The demographics, clinical profiles, and health service use 
patterns of young adults aged 18–24 years with ASD, with 
other DD (other DD), and those without ASD or other DD 
(non-DD) in Ontario, Canada were studied using adminis-
trative health data. The upper age limit of 24 was chosen 
through consultation with government policy staff from 
the children’s, social service and education ministries in 
Ontario. In Ontario, the switch from child to adult social, 
and mental services occurs at 18, and individuals with DD 
typically remain in school until 22. Using the 18–24 age 
range provides an opportunity to study this group after they 
age out of child services and are in the process of leaving 
school. The samples of young adults with ASD and other 
DD were drawn from a larger cohort of 66,484 adults with 
DD, aged 18–64 years as of April 1, 2009, living in Ontario 
(Health Care Access Research and Developmental Disabili-
ties; H-CARDD). This larger cohort of adults with DD was 
identified by a person-level data linkage of health adminis-
trative data (including inpatient, ED, and physician contacts) 
with Ontario disability income supports from the 2009 fis-
cal year and contains both people with ASD and other DD. 
These datasets were linked using unique encoded identifiers 
and analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences 
(ICES). The data sources, linkage process and the meth-
ods for identifying the population with DD are described 
in detail in prior publications (Lin et al. 2014; Lunsky et al. 
2013). Out of the larger cohort, we identified all individuals 
aged 18–24 years (n = 15,980) and applied an algorithm to 
identify those with ASD within this subset (see Table 1). A 
person was categorized as having ASD if they met any one 
of the following criteria:
• one or more hospital admissions or ED visits with an 
ASD diagnostic code;
• two or more physician visits with an ASD diagnostic 
code; or
• an ASD diagnostic code recorded in their disability 
income support program diagnostic information.
Similar to the logic applied in developing the larger cohort 
of individuals with DD (Lin et al. 2012), two instances were 
required in the physician visits criterion. Using two physi-
cian visit codes or one from another source has good speci-
ficity and moderate sensitivity when examining the validity 
of administrative data relative to gold standard ASD assess-
ment methods (Dodds et al. 2009). In Ontario, a person is 
eligible for disability income support if they are at least 18 
years of age, an Ontario resident, be in financial need, and 
meet the program’s definition of having a disability. Disabil-
ity is defined by a substantial mental or physical impairment 
that is continuous or recurrent, is expected to last 1 year

or more, results in a substantial restriction in the ability to 
work, self-care, or take part in community life, and is veri-
fied by an approved health care professional.1 Applying this 
algorithm resulted in a group of 5095 individuals with ASD.
Those not identified as having ASD within the H-CARDD 
subset were placed in the other DD group, with one excep-
tion. To maintain greater specificity relative to sensitivity, 
we excluded individuals with only one physician billing 
code of ASD and no other database code of ASD (n = 398). 
This resulted in a group of n = 10,487 individuals with other 
DD. The non-DD group was comprised of a random sample 
of 20% of young adults from Ontario health administrative 
data, aged 18–24 years, who were not part of the H-CARDD 
cohort (n = 393,263).
The three groups were compared on demographics, clini-
cal profiles, and health service use data for the 2009/2010 
fiscal year. Demographic variables included age, sex (male, 
female); area of residence (urban or rural); and neighbor-
hood income quintile, the latter two derived by linking 2006 
Census data to individual residential postal code areas. The 
category “rural and small town” was designated for areas 
with a population of 10,000 or less. Income data were 
adjusted for household and community size, such that each 
community would be expected to have 20% of its population 
in each income quintile, and were ranked in five catego-
ries ranging from poorest (income quintile 1) to wealthiest 
(income quintile 5).
Health variables of interest included both physical and 
mental health conditions: diabetes, hypertension, asthma, 
psychiatric disorders, and substance-related and addictive 
disorders. Diabetes, hypertension, and asthma were cho-
sen as past research comparing patients with ASD to the 
general population have often found higher rates in ASD. 
Validated algorithms for these conditions were used in the 
current study (Gershon et al. 2009; Hux et al. 2002; Quan 
et al. 2009). The look-back period for diabetes, hypertension, 
asthma, psychiatric disorders, and substance-related and 
addictive disorders was 2 years (2007–2009; Lin et al. 2016).
Health service use variables were family physician vis-
its, pediatrician visits, specialist visits (gastroenterologist, 
neurologist, psychiatrist, respirologist, surgeon, and other 
specialist), any type of ED visits, ED visits specifically for 
psychiatric concerns, any type of hospital admission, and 
hospital admission specifically for psychiatric concerns. We 
calculated percentages of individuals with one or more of 
these health service variables in a 1-year period between 
April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2010.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.2. 
Standardized differences were used to examine the differ-
ences in socio-demographic characteristics between groups. 
Standardized differences quantify the effect size for differ-
ences in proportions and are an extension of methods such 
as Cohen’s d (Austin 2009). The advantage of using stand-
ardized differences is that they are not influenced by sample 
sizes as are p-values, and are therefore more appropriate 
for large population-based studies (Mamdani et al. 2005). 
A standardized difference of at least 0.10 is viewed as clini-
cally meaningful (Austin 2009). Clinical profiles and health 
service use of the three groups of young adults (with ASD, 
with other DD, and without DD) were compared by cal-
culating unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted ORs 
along with 95% confidence intervals, using logistic regres-
sion, whereby statistical significance was determined when 
confidence intervals did not overlap with 1. Adjusted ORs 
controlled for demographic characteristics (age, sex, rural-
ity, and neighborhood income quintile). The study was 
approved by the institutional ethics review board at Sun-
nybrook Health Sciences Centre, the Centre for Addiction 
and Mental Health, and York University.
Results
Demographics
As shown in Table 2, the ASD group had a greater per-
centage of 18-year-olds, and fewer 24-year-olds, compared 
to the other DD group (standardized difference = 0.12 and 
0.11, respectively). Similarly, the ASD group had a greater 
percentage of 18-year-olds (standardized difference = 0.19), 
and fewer 23- and 24-year-olds, than the non-DD group 
(standardized difference = 0.11 and 0.17, respectively). The 
ASD group was more likely to be male compared to those 
with other DD (standardized difference = 0.43), and to the 
non-DD group (standardized difference = 0.59). Those with 
ASD showed a similar pattern of distribution along income 
compared to the non-DD group, with a relatively even dis-
tribution at each quintile (e.g., lowest quintile: 21 versus 
20.6%, standardized difference <0.03). In contrast, individu-
als with other DD were more likely to come from the lowest 
quintile (standardized difference = 0.15), and less likely to 
be in the highest quintile (standardized difference = 0.16) 
than those with ASD. Young adults with ASD were equally 
likely to come from rural regions compared to the compari-
son groups.

Clinical Profile Differences
Clinical profile differences are shown in Table 3. After con-
trolling for demographics, compared to the non-DD group, 
those with ASD were more likely to have all the identified 
clinical health issues, including having 5.2 times greater 
odds of having at least one psychiatric diagnosis. However 
compared to those with other DD, young adults with ASD 
were less likely to have asthma, hypertension, and sub-
stance-related and addictive disorders, and more likely to 
have psychiatric diagnoses. In fact, the odds of an individual 
with ASD having at least one psychiatric diagnosis were 
1.89 greater than those of their peers with other DD.
Health Service Use Differences
Health service use is also shown in Table 3. After control-
ling for demographics, young adults with ASD were more 
likely to have at least one visit with the family physician, 
pediatrician, psychiatrist, neurologist, gastroenterologist, 
and to visit the ED for psychiatric reasons, and be hospital-
ized overall and for psychiatric reasons, compared to the 
non-DD group. They were equally likely as the non-DD 
group to visit a respirologist or surgeon, and to visit the 
ED overall. Compared to young adults with other DD, the 
ASD group was more likely to have at least one visit to the 
family physician, pediatrician, and psychiatrist, and to visit 
the ED for psychiatric reasons; less likely to have a visit 
with a respirologist or surgeon and to have any type of ED 
visit; and equally likely to be hospitalized for any reason 
or psychiatric reasons, and to visit the neurologist or the 
gastroenterologist, compared to young adults with other DD.
Discussion
This is the first population-based study of broad health status 
and health utilization in young adults with ASD compared 
to both young adults with other forms of DD and to those 
with no DD. The differences found between young adults 
with ASD and with no DD were in line with our hypotheses. 
Our findings echo other studies that have consistently shown 
that people with ASD (and other DD) have more medical 
and mental health issues compared to the general population 
and are more likely to use health, particularly hospital, based 
services (Croen et al. 2015; Cummings et al. 2016; Schlenz 
et al. 2015; Vohra et al. 2016). The current study largely 
stands out because of its identification of unique health con-
cerns and health usage patterns of young adults with ASD 
relative to same age young adults with other DD. While the 
literature suggests that overall health use is higher in those 
with ASD, our findings suggest that this may be only when 
compared to the general population.

In our study, young adults with ASD had fewer or similar 
physical health issues and correspondingly less or similar 
health service use, compared to peers with other DD. Spe-
cifically, they were less likely to be diagnosed with either 
asthma or hypertension, and had similar rates of diabetes. 
Many of the genetic causes of intellectual impairment may 
have etiological repercussions for physical health condi-
tions, explaining the relatively higher rate in the compari-
son group. For instance, young adults with intellectual dis-
ability without ASD have a higher likelihood of admission 
to hospital as a result of severe ear/nose/throat, respiratory, 
and genitourinary problems than do young adults with 
ASD (McDermott et al. 2015) and this is thought to relate 
to Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome (Banjar 2012; 
Kidd et al. 2014; Kupferman et al. 2009; Hagerman et al. 
2009; Shott 2006). It may also be that medical conditions 
not reflected in the current dataset may be higher in the ASD 
group, such as gastrointestinal problems (Croen et al. 2015).
This is not to say that health issues in those with ASD are 
unimportant, but rather that when training health care pro-
viders in internal medicine and emergency care, it is neces-
sary that they understand there are health risks for all young 
adults with DD. A slightly broader healthcare training focus 
may assist many disability groups in addressing health needs, 
including patients with ASD. Further, even if some diseases 
are less common or similar at this specific age, how a patient 
with ASD may experiences healthcare may still differ. A 
reduced likelihood of health care visits may reflect less need

or reflect more difficulties accessing or engaging with a ser-
vice, because of the ASD-related stressors often present in 
the healthcare environment, or past negative experiences with 
the sector (Muskat et al. 2016). Certainly, in the case of ED 
visits for those with ASD, this has been suggested; parents 
are reluctant to return to an ED because the first visit can be 
highly stressful and traumatic for someone with ASD (Lunsky 
et al. 2015), and in our study, patients with ASD were less 
likely to visit the ED in general compared to other DD peers.
Even though medically young adults with ASD do not 
appear worse off than their peers with other DD, young 
adults with ASD were significantly more likely to have at 
least one psychiatric diagnosis, to visit a psychiatrist, and 
to have a psychiatric emergency department visit within 
the year. Mental health issues are common sources of stress 
and crisis for families living with ASD (Weiss et al. 2014), 
and likely account for the increased mental health service 
use found in our analysis. Findings here replicate patterns 
observed in non-population-based research. Clinical psy-
chiatric interviews with parents of people with ASD and 
with ID consistently find that while both groups have higher 
rates of emotional and behavioral disorders compared to 
the general population, individuals with ASD present with 
even greater risk compared to those with ID without ASD 
(Bradley et al. 2004; Totsika et al. 2011). These studies have 
focused on the experience of children and youth with ASD. 
Our study reports on this occurrence in young adults, at a 
time when their health service providers change, along with 
disruptions in access to community services and alterations 
in daily routines as schooling comes to an end (Cheak-
Zamora and Teti 2015; Shattuck et al. 2012). There is a clear 
need for mental health care supports for individuals with 
ASD in adulthood (Lake et al. 2014).
Unexpectedly, young adults with ASD did have a slightly 
higher likelihood of visiting the pediatrician that those with 
other DD, and certainly higher than the general population 
(OR of 1.3 and 4.0, respectively). One explanation is that 
the transition from pediatrician to family physician is more 
difficult for this group. In the US, it has been shown that 
adults with ASD have problems accessing family medicine 
(Nicolaidis et al. 2013). In a small scale Canadian study, a 
group of adults with ASD self-reported on their health ser-
vice use over a year, with 1/3 of young adults with ASD not 
having a single visit with a primary care provider (Vogan 
et al. 2016). Given the higher rates of mental health prob-
lems, specific impairments in communication, and stress in 
unfamiliar situations (like hospital or ED) in adults with 
ASD, there is a need to offer holistic, proactive adult based 
care, similar to the medical home concept for children and 
adolescents (Walsh et al. 2017). The rise in prevalence of 
ASD in children over the last decade means that there will 
be even greater numbers of young adults with ASD entering 
the adult healthcare system in the near future, and tools are 
needed to help physicians and families navigate this transi-
tion so that all of them can access proactive care (McGonigle 
et al. 2014).
Strengths of this study include the size and generaliz-
ability of the cohort of young adults with ASD and other 
DD. By using health and social services administrative data 
to identify these young adults, we were able to achieve more 
complete ascertainment of disability status than is possible 
in clinical samples or using health data alone. Nevertheless, 
there are limitations to our study which should be acknowl-
edged. Despite using linked health and social services data, 
some young adults with ASD and other DD may have been 
missed if they were not receiving income support for their 
disability and did not have a health care encounter with a rel-
evant diagnostic code. Such misclassification would bias the 
results toward the null. Both ASD and other DD represent 
heterogeneous groups of conditions; although there could 
be variability in health and health service use according to 
the severity of the disability, we were not able to capture 
this information. Finally, we were unable to capture infor-
mation on key medical issues known to be problematic for 
those with ASD (seizures and GI issues), and non-physician 
provided mental health services, including those delivered 
by psychologists or in community mental health centres.
Conclusion
Based on the results, there is a need to plan health care for 
young adults with ASD in a way that is different not only 
from the general population, but also those with other DD. 
In particular, there is a considerable need for those with 
ASD in the area of mental health. As well as enhancing 
psychiatric services for people with ASD at this age, atten-
tion should also be paid to childhood and the transition years 
that lead up to young adulthood, to implement proactive care 
initiatives. Early identification of, and intervention for, psy-
chiatric conditions for children and adolescents with ASD 
should be a priority, as should services that enhance mental 
well-being with the goal of preventing psychiatric illness.
