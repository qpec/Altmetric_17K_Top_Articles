Abstract
The loss of vision after damage to the retina, optic nerve, or brain has often grave consequences in everyday life such as problems
with recognizing faces, reading, or mobility. Because vision loss is considered to be irreversible and often progressive, patients
experience continuous mental stress due to worries, anxiety, or fear with secondary consequences such as depression and social
isolation. While prolonged mental stress is clearly a consequence of vision loss, it may also aggravate the situation. In fact,
continuous stress and elevated cortisol levels negatively impact the eye and brain due to autonomous nervous system
(sympathetic) imbalance and vascular dysregulation; hence stress may also be one of the major causes of visual system diseases
such as glaucoma and optic neuropathy. Although stress is a known risk factor, its causal role in the development or progression
of certain visual system disorders is not widely appreciated. This review of the literature discusses the relationship of stress and
ophthalmological diseases. We conclude that stress is both consequence and cause of vision loss. This creates a vicious cycle of a
downward spiral, in which initial vision loss creates stress which further accelerates vision loss, creating even more stress and so
forth. This new psychosomatic perspective has several implications for clinical practice. Firstly, stress reduction and relaxation
techniques (e.g., meditation, autogenic training, stress management training, and psychotherapy to learn to cope) should be
recommended not only as complementary to traditional treatments of vision loss but possibly as preventive means to reduce
progression of vision loss. Secondly, doctors should try their best to inculcate positivity and optimism in their patients while
giving them the information the patients are entitled to, especially regarding the important value of stress reduction. In this way,
the vicious cycle could be interrupted. More clinical studies are now needed to confirm the causal role of stress in different low
vision diseases to evaluate the efficacy of different anti-stress therapies for preventing progression and improving vision recovery
and restoration in randomized trials as a foundation of psychosomatic ophthalmology.

Introduction
About 285 million people are estimated to be visually im-
paired worldwide, including 39 million which are blind [1].
Unlike refractive errors caused by diseases of the cornea or
lens which can be corrected by optic means or surgery, dis-
eases affecting the visual nervous system (retina, optic nerve,
brain) are widely assumed to be irreversible. If patients are
informed of such a grim diagnosis and poor prognosis, they
typically experience anxiety and fear of becoming blind. This
creates a psychological double-burden; not only do they ex-
perience fear-inducing difficulties in daily life with reading,
orienting, or mobility, but a negative prognosis typically has a

 severe emotional impact, leading to worries, anxiety, fear, de-
pression, and social isolation [2]. Thus, vision loss and emo-
tional responses go hand in hand. Unless these patients are
properly consulted, a long-lasting psychosocial and socioeco-
nomic burden ensues.
At the outset, it seems obvious that vision loss and blind-
ness lead to mental stress, i.e., stress being the result or
consequence of the disease. But as we will now discuss, stress
may actually also be a causal factor, i.e., contributing to the
onset and progression of vision loss. This causality of stress,
however, has not been systematically considered despite its
relevance for the pathophysiology of certain Beye^ diseases
with nervous system involvement. The aim of this review is
therefore to summarize the literature with the goal to untangle
the relationship between vision loss and psychological factors
both in research and in the clinical context from a holistic
point of view. The underlying assumption is that stress man-
agement can help activate residual vision and restoration [3],
augmenting current approaches to prevent further vision loss
and to enhance rehabilitative efforts such as vision training [4,
5] or brain current stimulation [6–9].
Stress and vision loss
The idea that mental distress is one of the main causes of vision
loss dates back to ancient times. In a Sanskrit book entitled
BSUSRUTA SAMHITA,^ believed to be written as early as
1.300 BC [10], i.e., over 3000 years ago, a famous Indian sur-
geon named Susruta, practicing the ancient Indian traditional
Ayurveda medicine, lists 18 different causes of vision loss (see
first chapter on BBasics of Eye Diseases^ with an excerpt shown
in Fig. 1). Among them, six Bcauses^ or signs of bodily or
emotional stress are listed: improper sleeping habits like day time
sleeping, awakening at night, etc. (SWAPNA
VIPARYAASCHA); continuous weeping (PRASAKTA
SAMRODHANA); excessive anger (KOPA); grief (SHOKA);
stress suffering—pain, physical, and mental exhaustion
(KLESHA); and suppression of tears (BHASHPA GRAHATH).
In agreement with this ancient proposal—and based on our
clinical experience amalgamated with a thorough literature
review pertinent to the recently described Flammer syndrome
(FS) [11, 12], we now wish to propose that psychological
stress is not only a consequence or just a minor Brisk factor.^
Rather, it is one of the main causes of certain (but not all) cases
of vision loss, particularly certain forms of glaucoma and optic
neuropathy. If this causality proposition could be substantiated
with convincing and coherent arguments, then some disorders
of the visual pathways might be considered to have psycho-
somatic components or may even represent a
Bpsychosomatic^ disorder. If confirmed, this new understand-
ing could lead to better management and new treatment
options.
Before discussing our proposition in more detail, it is im-
perative to reveal a caveat: we do not suggest mental stress is
the exclusive cause of vision loss, but our proposition is that
stress should be considered as one of the cardinal causal fac-
tors and a major risk factor. This subject is not only important
as an anecdote of suffering for individual patients but also a
practical step forward to better manage an ever growing prob-
lem of general public interest. As an increasing number of
people are affected by low vision every day and their number
is growing in our aging societies, this issue becomes essen-
tially pertinent.
Besides problems related to the optics of the eye, many
diseases affecting the nervous system structures can cause
vision loss and function which include glaucoma, optic neu-
ropathy, diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and
age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Primary open-
angle glaucoma (POAG) is the main cause of irreversible
blindness with a prevalence expected to grow from 64.3 mil-
lion (2013) to 76.0 million (more than twice that of
Alzheimer’s disease) in 2020 (111.8 million in 2040). Of all
causes of vision loss, glaucoma is the second leading cause of

chapter of BBASICS OF EYE DISEASES.^ The figure shows the original
Sanskrit text passage with its transformation to Roman lettering and the

exposing to heat. 2. DOOREKSHANATH—Looking at the very distant
objects regularly for a long time, may be without blinking. 3. SWAPNA

awakening at night etc. 4. PRASAKTA SAMRODHANA—
Continuous weeping. 5. KOPA— Excessive anger. 6. SHOKA—Grief.
7. KLESHA— Stress: suffering pain, physical, and mental exhaustion.
8. ABIGHAATA—Minute irritative injuries or contusion injuries or
perforating injuries. 9. ATI MAITHUNNA—Indulgence in excessive
sexual intercourse. 10. SHUKTHA ARANALA AMLA—Vinegar and

or tobacco smoking. 15. CHARDHIR VIGHATATH—Suppressing the
vomit. 16. VAMANATHI YOGATH—Excessively indulging in inducing
vomiting. 17. BHASHPA GRAHATH—Suppressing tears. 18.

 blindness (first leading cause of Birreversible^ blindness) [13,
14], with POAG and normal-tension glaucoma being the most
common types [15]. Because vision loss is among the most
perturbing diseases in the elderly precipitating anxiety and
depression, understanding how stress affects the eye and
vision-related brain circuits is an issue of immense cogent
rationale.
Yet, the body of evidence for stress-based vision loss cau-
sality is rather limited and includes many old references
(mostly before the 1960s). It is, therefore, important to under-
stand that even if a comprehensive analysis is carried out, the
best that can be done is to discuss the general role of stress in
vision loss without making meticulous distinctions between
different diseases. The premise of our proposal, therefore, is
subject to certain inevitable limitations and constraints. For
this reason, the discussion may appear to be rather obscure
and devoid of objective precision about the etiological role of
stress in specific diseases. For example, the term Bglaucoma^
is used for a variety of different pathologies such as closed- or
open-angle glaucoma, pigment glaucoma, juvenile glaucoma,
normal-tension glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, etc.
Similarly, optic neuropathies can be with or without trauma,
developmental anomalies, genetic mutations, etc. On the other
hand, there are specific diseases, like normal-tension glauco-
ma and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), where
stress can clearly be identified as a major cause. Whereas
stress may play a greater role in younger patients with AION
or glaucoma, in the elderly other factors are more likely to
exist, such as arteriosclerosis.
Despite the uncertainty regarding whether or not, or to
what extent, stress plays a role in a specific disease related to
vision loss, we believe that stress (and certain personality dis-
positions) is a hitherto under-appreciated factor in the devel-
opment of certain—but not all—diseases of the visual system.
Low vision, stress, and the brain
Challenging life events and any other stimuli that lead to stress
are called Bstressors^. They are part of our daily lives.
However, in what way the body and mind react to any specific
stressor depends on the brain’s interpretation and the bodily
reaction to it. The brain’s appraisal determines whether a
physiological stress response is elicited and affects the body
and, if so, how stress causes pathophysiology of vision loss.
Eye diseases are also brain and vascular diseases Bin
disguise^
Because the retina and eye are extensions of the brain [16], it
may be conceivable that Bophthalmologic^ diseases might
actually also be Bbrain^ diseases in disguise, both of which
depend on the vascular system. For example, glaucoma is both
an ocular and brain neurodegenerative disorder characterized
by progressive damage of both the optic nerve head and differ-
ent visual brain centers [16–19] as well as those that control
emotions (amygdala) [20]. Since stress and emotional experi-
ences affect the eye, brain, and vascular system by way of
autonomic imbalance and/or stress hormone release thereby
ensuing perfusion problems, and since neural circuits involved
in vision and emotion have functional and physiological over-
lap, stress could have a direct impact on vision as well.
With the premise of above introductory remarks, we sug-
gest that vascular dysregulation is a key mechanism of
normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) pathogenesis [21–23]. It
may arguably be caused by stress hormones circulating in
the vascular system, which—in turn—are controlled by brain
cognition and emotional response to stressors. Stress hor-
mones influence vascular tone, particularly in and around
the optic nerve and thereby impair vascular autoregulation. It
is therefore conceivably that the patient’s individual emotional
response to stressors determines whether or not the brain in-
duces the release of stress hormones. In this case, psycholog-
ical factors would contribute to the development of NTG.
While such a physiological hormonal state might be a neces-
sary condition, it is not a sufficient cause because not everyone
with emotional stress ends up with glaucoma. Therefore, other
factors must underlie the ethiopathogenic picture to make the
difference whether or not a stressed person develops NTG.
Such factors could range anywhere from genetic susceptibili-
ty, stress sensitization, to a disturbed stress resilience system.
As we will discuss below, such factors may contribute to the
pathology of the ocular blood vessel endothelial cells. In other
words, we could look upon the brain and patient’s individual
experiences as starting points for the pathogenesis of glauco-
ma, and presumably other vision problems as well (genetic/
pathological conditions being the second rung in the ladder).
Neither of the two factors alone should be considered suffi-
cient to cause NTG, but it is rather the combined effect of
both. This can be described by the following causal chain of
events which is slightly different from high-tension glaucoma:
(see also Fig. 2).
Normal-tension glaucoma:
Stressors (chronic or acute) → brain’s cognitive interpre-
tation → emotional response → stress-related biological
responses (hormonal, vascular dysregulation) → retinal
and optic nerve pathology → visual field loss.
High-tension glaucoma:
Stressors (chronic or acute) → brain’s cognitive interpreta-
tion → emotional response → autonomic imbalance → rising in-
traocular pressure (IOP) → retinal and optic nerve pathology →
visual field loss.
If mental stress causes vision loss and vision loss leads to
stress, this results in a downward spiral: mental stress impairs
vascular function in the ocular structures leading to vision
loss; this causes emotional worry and stress, which, in turn,
EPMA Journal
 aggravates vision loss and so on. Breaking this downward
spiral might provide an opportunity for prevention and/or
intervention.
The following case report exemplifies how vision and
stress are related.
A case report
W.G., a 78-year-old woman, is happily married for 55 years.
As a former business manager who worked 50+ h/week all her
life as supervisor in a bank’s IT department, she presented
herself at SAVIR-Center in Magdeburg to receive treatment
for her severe vision loss on both eyes.
Case history W.G. had cataract surgery on both eyes in 2001
with excellent outcome and clear vision thereafter. In January
2013, she lost vision on her left eye immediately after having
undergone gynecological surgery under general anesthesia. In
the morning of surgery, she received a tranquilizer to prepare
her for general anesthesia. But because the surgery was de-
layed, she received additional injections of the tranquilizer
throughout the day. The surgery finally started in the late af-
ternoon and lasted more than 2 h. When she woke up, it was
already dark outside. She slept well through the night, but next
morning she noted that her left eye was completely blind and
she had to vomit, which she never did before. She suspected
that the blindness occurred as a result of the surgery, but she
had not noticed it due to the darkness in the evening. Her
vision recovered a bit spontaneously but remained severely
impaired. The vision loss worried her a lot as she wondered
how to manage her life with only one eye and how she could
continue to take care of her frail husband who suffered from
heart problems. It was a 24/7 burden. Three years later, in
2016, her husband’s health suddenly deteriorated requiring
immediate by-pass surgery. She worried not only about her
vision problem but also that her husband might die and what
her future would be like after 55 years of a happy marriage. On
the day after her husband’s surgery, her vision suddenly dete-
riorated also on the right eye and she suspected that the 3 years
of continuous stress plus her acute worries were suddenly
Bdischarged^ in her vision loss. Though other factors might
have contributed to her condition, stress was the main trigger
for her vision loss. When asking her ophthalmologist if the
vision loss might be related to stress, she was informed that
stress had absolutely nothing to do with vision loss, though a
cause was not found. Asking what her prognosis would be,
she was told that once it is damaged, it will stay damaged
forever. Shocked by this prospect, an assistant doctor made a
remark without any sense of empathy: Bwhatever you try, you
will go blind.^
Medical The ophthalmological report indicates a history of
Sicca syndrome in both eyes; left eye optic nerve atrophy
due to NAION in 2013, and right eye NAION in Aug 2016,
normal IOP, no fundus pathology except for a nasal vasocon-
striction OD. Brain CTand lab values were normal, except for
indication of hyperlipoproteinemia. No treatment recommen-
dation for vision loss was given.
Vision testing Vision testing in October 2017 revealed an OD
Humphrey visual field index of 12% (mean deviation −
25.97 dB). OS could not be measured due to fixation

 problems. Supra-threshold stimulus detection (high-resolution
perimetry, HRP) to measure residual vision showed detection
rates of 43% OD (fixation of 100%) and 59% OS (fixation
99%) with reaction times of 600/500 ms, respectively. The
discrepancy between near-threshold and super-threshold test-
ing was surprisingly large. OD/OS visual acuity was 0.25/0
and contrast sensitivity 1.0 monocular on both eyes and 1.24
binocularly (see Fig. 3).
Subjective vision W.G. reported her vision to be reduced in
both eyes; OD was worse as she could see only course shapes
but no details. OS could recognize course shapes in temporal
visual field sectors and shadows in the nasal half of the visual
field which she perceived as gray (Bfoggy^) vision. She could
no longer read newspapers of her bank account statements,
had problems recognizing faces, frequently bumped into peo-
ple or objects, had painful glare with bright lights, adaptation
problems from dark to light, dry eyes, and problems with
black-white contrast; color perception was subjectively intact.
Her eyes could move in all directions, but she had occasional
extra-saccades while fixating.
Psychological assessment She was cognitively normal, under-
stood and responded to questions adequately, and was intel-
lectually quite alert. However, mental stress and worries in the
past and at present were dominant. She showed signs reminis-
cent of the Flammer syndrome (FS) (see below): cold hands
and fluctuations toward low blood pressure, slim body shape,
tendency to worry a lot, ambitious and perfectionist attitude
both at work and at home, problems falling asleep, lack of the
feeling of thirst, and very pale skin in her face and extremities.
In addition, she reported her thinking to be dominated by the
wish to fulfill the expectations of others but ignoring her own
desires, wishes, and needs. She was quite aware that stress has
been—and still was—a problem, but she did not know what to
do about it and was quite anxious to be ending up blind.
Case summary and conclusions It is likely that the vision loss
on the left eye after her 2013 surgery may have been caused by
the lengthy tranquilizer/anesthesia and might be explainable
by closed angle glaucoma or perfusion problems (apparently
not directly related to stress) as described by Flammer [24].
The subsequent loss on the right eye 3 years later, in all prob-
ability, is stress-related because of anxiety and worries about
her own vision loss plus her husband’s health problems, in
conjunction with her tendency to neglect her own emotional
needs. This might have induced a vasospasm as a conse-
quence of her chronic (3-year) stress plus the acute stress
due to her husband’s heart surgery. It is conceivable that the
earlier negative and stress-inducing prediction by the assistant
doctor (Byou will be blind^) did not help the situation but
rather potentiated the stress, increasing the probability of vi-
sion loss.
Treatment The patient was treated with the aim to improve
blood circulation and brain synchronization to activate resid-
ual vision [3] by daily administration of alternating current
stimulation [6–9], relaxation, and eye yoga exercises. In addi-
tion, she received psychological with the aim to develop great-
er stress resilience and improve coping. Though we do not
know which therapeutic module was most effective, the com-
bination of all treatments councelling that she received during
a 2-week period improved her vision both objectively and
subjectively (for further descriptions of these methods, [25]).
Treatment outcome After the 2-week treatment in the SAVIR-
Center in Magdeburg, W.G. subjectively noted that her vision
had improved: half way through the treatment, she could see
at far distance again and her Bgray^ vision became brighter
(Bwhite^) in the upper visual field sector. She was also able to
see more details again. For example, she could see parts of her
face again when looking into a mirror; she could see her eyes
and hair again for the first time. She reported being able to
read street signs again, but her central visual field still felt
problematic. These subjective reports were confirmed by
Humphrey visual fields which improved from 12 to 21% with
no fixation losses or false positives at both time points (Fig. 3).
Another case, also shown in Fig. 3, is a 52-year-old wom-
an, suffered from normal-tension glaucoma. When she came
for treatment to the office of the first author (B.S.) for 10 days
with alternating current, she did not improve much. She was a
rather agitated and energetic woman with strong tendency to
worry and perfectionism. When she returned for a second
course of treatment about 12 months later, the psychological
consulting from the first visit, together with a second course of
10-day treatment and psychological consulting, had a remark-
able benefit for her vision which improved from 19 to 63%
visual field index.
Worldwide research activities on stress
and ophthalmology
The above case report demonstrates that stress can lead to a
dramatic, psychosomatic reaction in the visual system while
reduction in stress and enhanced blood flow can notably im-
prove the condition. There are, however, many similar stories
of vision recovery and most clinicians are aware of visual field
fluctuations. Rozanski et al. [26] proposed that visual field
(VF) performance is not only a function of the actual vision
loss itself but is highly variable due to anxiety and functional
losses of vision. They presented a conceptual framework for
the development of coping strategies and mindfulness-based
interventions to reduce stress associated with negative
thoughts and worries [26]. Though there are unexplained
cases of vision loss and cases of unexpected recovery [27],
yet the literature is surprisingly silent as to how the mosaic of
stress, vision loss, vision recovery, and restoration are
EPMA Journal
 connected. It should not escape our notice that the term
Bunexplained^ could have two meanings: no pathology found
or pathological changes existed, but they could not explain the
visual field.
Unfortunately, our scientific understanding is disconcert-
ingly poor when it comes to the role of stress and the brain
in ophthalmological diseases. The question nevertheless arises
as to how much science exists about the role of stress in vision
loss. We therefore counted on PubMed the number of scien-
tific reports in the field of psychology/psychosomatics of vi-
sion loss (www.pubmed.org; Oct 2017). We reasoned this
might reveal some clues of how comprehensively this field
is being studied worldwide (Table 1).
We first searched for general terms in the fields of Vision and
Psychology and recorded the total number of hits separately for
Beye^ (565,167), Bvision loss^(58,052), and low vision^
(16,338) as well as Bstress^ (756,926), Bpsychosomatic^
(19,145), or Bpsychological stress^ (137,084). But when com-
bining the two fields, much fewer hits were recorded:
Bpsychology vision loss^ (4020), Bstress low vision^ (228),
Bmental stress vision loss^ (146), Bpsychosomatic eye^ (154),
Bpsychosomatic ophthalmology^ (95), or Bmental stress low
vision^ (52); this means that of all studies of eye/vision loss
(640,000), only 4700 (= 0.7%) addressed the topic of mental
stress. Such a low value of < 1% was a surprise vis-à-vis the
impact vision loss has on psychological well-being.
One might argue sensory functions are purely
Bphysiological,^ i.e., not influenced by the patients’ state of
mind. To check if this Bsomato-centric^ interpretation of vi-
sion is unique to ophthalmology, we carried out the same
analysis for the sense of hearing for Bear^ (172,353) or
Bhearing loss^ (78,780). While the scientific output was only
about one third of that related to Beye^ and Bvision,^ the
number of publications of the combined term Bmental stress
hearing loss,^ was 1.2% (306), i.e., almost double that of
vision. In other words, somato-centric thinking not only dom-
inates vision research, but it creates also a negative bias
against a role of mental-stress in vision loss.
This low number of scientific records addressing the inter-
face of stress and vision loss dovetails what patients are also
complaining about: that there is minimal interest (if any), or
even a negative bias against, psychological concerns in the oph-
thalmology clinical and research community. Yet, there is a rich
repertoire of literature on psychological treatments such as stress
reduction, relaxation techniques (such as yoga and meditation),
cognitive therapies, and psychotherapy. They might be valuable
adjuvant methods for a more holistic approach in ophthalmolo-
gy for treating the person behind the eye.
One could argue that ophthalmology shows less interest in
psychobiological mechanisms of visual diseases because the
patients and the public at large find psychological issue to
be irrelevant for the understanding (or treatment) of vision

 loss. Because our clinical experience suggests otherwise, we
next estimated general public interest in these topics by
conducting a Google search. Table 1 shows the number of hits
in Google as a metric of public interest and in Google scholar as
a metric of academic interest. This could teach us how well
(concordance vs discordance) scientific activity (PubMed hits)
and public interest (Google hits) match. The results are aston-
ishing: for every scientific publication identified by the two
PubMed search terms Beye/vision^ and Bpsychosomatics^ sep-
arately, there are 4000/1200 Google items, respectively. That
means the ratio of scientific activity and general public interest
is in the order 1:1.000–4.000. However, when combining vi-
sion and psychological terms, this number is 1:100.000. In
other words, for every science publication, there are 100,000
Google hits; a tremendous mismatch between general public
interest and scientific activity! This confirms that many people
are actively searching information about the role of mental
stress in low vision. If one would ask how much scientific
activity would have to increase to match public interest, the
answer would be: by a factor of 25!
The rather disappointing conclusion of our Google analysis
is as follows: though mental stress is of major subjective con-
cern for low vision patients and the public at large, the topic is
essentially ignored by the scientific community. This is sur-
prising if one considers that stress is factor which is well-
known to influence mental and bodily health; it is widely
recognized particularly in psychosomatic medicine. Yet, there
is a rather small body of evidence for the role of stress in
vision loss which will now be reviewed.
Literature analysis
Our search revealed 139 papers (163-250), some published
before the 1960s, but the majority after the year 2000 (n =
97) (Table 2). The publications discuss different eye diseases
and different psychosomatic conditions. The most frequently
studied disease is glaucoma (open angle or angle closure) (n =
46), followed by age-related low vision such as macular de-
generation or cataract (n = 10), non-organic vision loss or
functional vision loss (NOVL) (n = 9), retinitis pigmentosa
(RP, n = 4), myopia (n = 3), and one paper each for dry eye
syndrome (DES), diabetic retinopathy, and amblyopia.
Methodologies used in such studies included measurement
of visual fields (VFs), visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity
(CS), the Adaptation to Age-Related Vision Loss Scale
(AVL), and intraocular pressure (IOP). The study of psycho-
somatic consequences (or causes) varied as well, ranging from
depression, anxiety, life stress, coping strategies, personality,
self-concepts, and the study of the effects of various relaxing
methods. The psycho-diagnostic tools to assess the mental
state included the following: the NEI-VFQ-25 (National Eye
Institute 25-Point Visual Functioning Questionnaire) and oth-
er tests such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9),
36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), Generalized Anxiety

Whereas 32 papers indicate that psychosomatic factors are
the consequence of eye diseases, another 32 seem to favor the
opinion that psychosomatic influences are the cause of eye
diseases. Yet others are ambiguous about it. Thus, the literature
is evenly divided on this issue and the jury is still out if eye
diseases are cause or consequence. The cause-effect issue, as
we perceive it, may not be an Beither/or^ affair because stress is
probably both, cause and effect of vision loss. Before
discussing the role of stress in vision loss in more detail, we
will briefly summarize the biological stress response systems.
The stress response
Acute as well as chronic stressors can elicit the onset, or wors-
en the course, of vision loss. Understanding the physiological
mechanisms of the stress response is, therefore, a pursuit of
pertinent and pragmatic interest.
Stress response systems
The brain has two outflow systems to control the adaptation of
the body to stress: firstly, the neuronal sympathetic
adrenomedullary system (SAM) which is part of the autonom-
ic nervous system, and secondly a neuroendocrine stress re-
sponse system, i.e., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
(HPA). Both are activated during stress, and both are con-
trolled by neural brain networks which are involved in the
control of stress and emotion. Critical brain regions are the
brain stem, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and
hippocampus.
The sympathetic adrenomedullary system
Walter Cannon suggested already in 1932 [28] that acute re-
sponses to threat involve activation of the sympathetic ner-
vous system via autonomic centers in the brain stem, resulting
in peripheral catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla.
This sympathetic activation prepares the organism for in-
creased activity by constricting blood vessels to redistribute
blood flow to muscles and by increasing heart rate and pul-
monary function, in order to maintain homeostasis under con-
ditions of increased activation demand [29]. Sympathetic ac-
tivation simultaneously also shuts down other bodily func-
tions that are not needed at that moment such as feeding,
reproduction, or sleep. Stomach and upper intestinal functions
are inhibited so that digestion is slowed down. Thus, the stress
response is adaptive for a Bfight and flight^ response, which is
of great relevance for the survival of the individual and
survival of the species in evolution. It increases metabolism
for this action via glycogenolysis in the liver to raise glucose
levels, and modulates brain function to increase vigilance,
attention, and arousal. Here, central norepinephrine helps ac-
tivating the HPA axis [16].
As the Flammer syndrome implies, repeated or chronic
activation of this system can elicit vascular system dysfunc-
tion in patients, which have genetically susceptible endothelial
cells that can promote development of vision loss. In addition,
a sensitized system due to early-life adversity could represent
a risk factor for developing vision loss in response to acute
stressors [30]. This might be particularly true for genetically
susceptible individuals [31].
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
While the SAM is rather a fast-reaction system, the HPA axis
has a slower reaction to internal and/or external stress. The
HPA axis is controlled by the CA3 region of the hippocampus,
and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine va-
sopressin (AVP) neurons originating in the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus. Activation of these neurons is
elicited by combined input from cortical limbic and brain stem
circuits. The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus inhibit the
HPA axis and input from amygdala and noradrenergic brain
stem nuclei activate it (see next section). Axons of CRH neu-
rons (and co-secreted AVP) terminate in the median eminence
onto small blood vessels (neuroendocrine transmission). Here,
the neuronal signal is Btranslated^ into a hormone Bblood-
borne^ signal by releasing neuropeptides into the portal circu-
lation of the pituitary gland from where they reach the anterior
pituitary corticotrophic cells to stimulate the secretion of ad-
renocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH, in turn, stimu-
lates the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol
in humans) from the adrenal gland into the blood circulation.
Glucocorticoids then lead to increasing blood sugar through
gluconeogenesis and provide the energy resources for the or-
ganism to flee or to fight. Because glucocorticoids modulate
transcription of certain genes in the cell nuclei, the hormonal
response to stress is slower and longer lasting than the faster
SAM actions [32].
While the release of glucocorticoids during stress is good
news for its adaptation necessary for survival, it is bad news
under conditions of severe or chronic stress, such as early
childhood trauma or patients receiving a negative medical
prognosis (e.g., Byou are going blind^). The overexposure of
the brain to glucocorticoids can then become toxic to neurons,
e.g. in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and glucocor-
ticoids can even be toxic to retinal tissues [33, 34]. Because of
various feedback loops, glucocorticoid increase progressively
damage the hippocampus, leading to further glucocorticoid
release, then to even more damage of the brain; a vicious
cycle.
EPMA Journal
 Lower than normal levels of glucocorticoid release are also
detrimental as this can have adverse effects on the proper
regulation of hormones to control central stress responses
and activation of the immune system [35, 36]. Hence, an op-
timal balance of glucocorticoid release during stress is critical
for a healthy adaptation response to stress.
Brain circuits implicated in the stress response
Besides the systemic stressors and homeostatic imbalances,
the response to psychological or emotional stressors is key,
but this requires appraisal and processing activities by higher
brain regions.
While brain stem nuclei regulate the activation of SAM and
the HPA with ascending (Bbottom-up^) projections, several
Btop-down^ processes are involved in eliciting the stress re-
sponse. These brain structures include limbic forebrain struc-
tures, including the amygdala, the hippocampus, as well as the
prefrontal cortex (PFC). While hippocampus and PFC atrophy
in conditions of chronic stress, the amygdala volume in-
creases. It is involved in autonomic regulation and fear learn-
ing [37–40], and its volume enlargement is found in glaucoma
patients [20]. But how the brain’s visual and emotional system
interacts in cases of low vision is a yet unexplored issue of
ardent importance.
Stress and inflammation
In addition to the HPA axis and the SAM, the immune system
is another regulatory framework that is activated in response
to stress. There are complex interactions between these three
regulatory systems. For example, psychosocial stress can ac-
tivate inflammatory responses, by neural activation of signal-
ing pathways in immune cells, resulting in increased NFκB
production, which induces the secretion of inflammatory me-
diators. [36, 41]. Inflammatory mediators in turn can activate
central stress responses. Concerning vision loss, the role of
inflammation is a topic long known to be critical for a variety
of ocular maladies. A detailed overview of this field is, none-
theless, beyond the scope of this paper and we prompt the
reader to read important reviews by others [41–47].
Stress and vision loss in glaucoma
Glaucoma is an appropriate example of how an eye disease
can be influenced or caused by mental stress. The biological
response to mental stress and the pathogenesis of glaucoma
share numerous common features sufficient to justify the men-
tal stress based etiology (see also Fig. 2). The principle mech-
anisms are intraocular pressure elevation, vascular dysregula-
tion, and an imbalance of autonomic nervous system regula-
tion and immunological aspects [48, 49].
Stress and intraocular pressure
The main cause and the only currently known modifiable risk
factor for glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).
This reduces blood flow in the eye due to physical pressure
on the choroidal vascular system. The standard of care is low-
ering IOP by topical drugs or performing surgery with the aim
to relieve the physical pressure and thus normalize blood flow.
Several publications indicate that mental stress is associated
with IOP elevation which is confirmed by molecular studies
(see below) [50]. In patients who already have glaucoma, both
acute and chronic stress raise IOP; when lasting for longer
duration, stress may raise IOP even in those not having glau-
coma [50, 51]. But 33–57% of all glaucoma cases [52] have
normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). This shows that besides the
physical influence of IOP, there are other causes of glaucoma
as well: vascular dysregulation [53–55] and an imbalance of
the brain and eye pressure [20] are two possible mechanisms
which are either directly or indirectly controlled by the brain.
Blood flow, vascular dysregulation, and stress
hormones
Besides IOP, primary vascular dysregulation is particularly
relevant for both, POAG pathogenesis and NTG [56]. The
connection between the ocular perfusion pressure and primary
vascular dysregulation has been explicated in NTG by
Flammer [53, 54].
Both POAG and NTG are caused, or accelerated, by stress
hormones in the vascular system such as glucocorticoids, pro-
inflammatory cytokines, and endothelin-1. They influence
vascular tone, particularly in and round the optic nerve and
thereby impair vascular autoregulation. Stress hormones all
contribute to endothelial dysfunction (loss of autoregulation)
possibly via downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide syn-
thase (eNOS) expression, eNOS inactivation, decreased nitric
oxide (NO) actions, and increased NO degradation, together
with vasoconstriction counteracting against NO-induced va-
sodilatation. NO is a known regulator of ocular blood flow
and the reduction of NO metabolites is known to be associated
with glaucoma [57]. NO is involved in the control of basal
blood flow in the choroid, optic nerve, and the retina via the
maintenance of the autoregulation of ocular blood flow [58].
Autonomic nervous system imbalance
Stress being one of the main causes of sympathetic nervous
system activation is an axiomatic fundamental of medical sci-
ence. The evolutionary function of stress is to prepare the
body and mind for the Bfight flight^ response. Sympathetic
activity prepares the body for it, whereas parasympathetic
influences are predominant during relaxation states. The auto-
nomic nervous system is also a factor keeping the blood flow
EPMA Journal
 in synch with metabolic demand of nerve cells. It controls
autoregulation of the vasculature which is the intrinsic capac-
ity to maintain constant flow despite changes in perfusion
pressure. But if autoregulation fails in the ocular blood ves-
sels, this can have a dramatic impact on ocular blood flow
homeostasis thereby precipitating impairment. Hence, blood
flow regulation may not match the metabolic demands of the
retinal nerve cells which then fail to fire action potentials at the
needed activity level or at the right point in time. It is to be
noted that, similar to blood flow in the retina, blood flow in the
brain is also autoregulated.
Na and Riccadonna [48, 49] showed that dysfunction of
autonomic control is associated with NTG which they discov-
ered by analyzing heart rate variability; autonomic dysfunc-
tion may, in fact, induce chronic ischemia of the optic nerve.
The study of heart rate variability (HRV) under conditions of
the cold provocation test confirmed the predominance of the
sympathetic nervous system activity in NTG [59].
Inflammation
Psychological stress is also a major provocative factor in
chronic inflammatory conditions which increases TNF-α (an
anti-inflammatory myokine) and IL6 (a pro-inflammatory cy-
tokine) [60]. As an example, elevated levels of IL6 are found
in the aqueous humor of glaucoma patients, suggesting their
contribution to glaucoma pathogenesis.
TNF-α is a cell signaling protein (cytokine) involved in
systemic inflammation. Its levels are elevated in glaucoma
patients and major depressive disorders revealing a tri-
faceted link between TNF-α, psychological stress, and glau-
coma. Levels of pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α as well
as IL6 and IL8 are elevated in glaucoma and downregulated
by meditation, which is associated with a normalization of
IOP (Dada et al. 2017, personal communication). For further
details about the relationship of psychological stress and the
immune system, please refer to Segerstrom and Miller [42].
Mental stress: consequence or cause of vision
loss
Our hypothesis that visual impairment has, at least in part, a
psychosomatic component is based on two considerations:
Firstly, patients suffering from low vision (for example due
to glaucoma or optic neuritis) often report that their vision loss
happened at a time of massive or prolonged mental stress (or
shortly thereafter). The source of massive mental stress could
be significant life events such as financial, marital, employ-
ment (retirement), or serious health problems. When asked
about it, patients often mention their impression that their
vision loss might have been triggered by stress.
The second consideration is the biological response chain
following continuously (or acutely) elevated stress hormone
levels in blood vessels (such as cortisol, adrenalin,
endothelin). They cause vascular dysregulation which leads
to insufficient amounts or the timing of oxygen supply in the
eye (and possibly brain) tissue, with widespread consequences
on the biochemical, physiological, and psychological level of
analysis. The BFlammer syndrome^ (FS) is one example of
this, where endothelial cell dysfunction, possibly due to ge-
netic abnormalities in combination with stress hormone expo-
sure, leads to vascular autoregulation problems [12] (see be-
low). However, direct proof of this hypothesis is still lacking.
The fundamental association of stress and glaucoma has
already been proposed many times before [61, 62]. The gen-
eral consensus is that mental stress is only the consequence of
vision loss reducing quality of life (QOL) [63]. Constant anx-
iety and worries plague many patients as they anticipate a grim
future of a progressing blindness. This fear severely impacts
QOL and lifestyle [2] for the risks of losing employment,
greater dependence on others, and declining self-esteem
[64]. This is particularly relevant to acquired visual impair-
ment, less so for blindness from birth [65].
Despite a compelling body of rationale, stress is of little
concern to clinical ophthalmology because ophthalmologists
are neither trained nor paid for helping with psychological
problems which are for psychologists or psychiatrist to fix.
If we accept the notion that stress is causal for vision loss,
then there is considerable risk associated with situations when
patients are informed by ophthalmologists with a negative
prognosis like Bget used to it,^ Bblind stays blind,^ or Byou
are going to be blind.^ Clinicians are therefore advised to
refrain from making such negative predictions for anxiety
and fear may actually accelerate the vision loss. Such a con-
ceptual layout makes a case for psychological counseling of
patients where an ophthalmologist foresees poor prognosis.
Flammer syndrome and stress
FS and the science behind it is a starting point for our discus-
sion of the concept that some diseases of low vision may be
considered psychosomatic in nature. FS is found mostly in
cases with NTG which was first described by Dr. Josef
Flammer at the University Eye Clinic in Basel, Switzerland,
who provided insight into how closely the mind and the body
interact [11, 21, 53]. NTG often leads to visual field impair-
ments but almost never to blindness. According to Flammer’s
proposal, stress hormone release in persons with endothelial
dysfunction leads to vascular dysregulation. This, in turn, is a
key mechanism of vision loss in NTG but not one in high
pressure glaucoma. The discovery of the FS is a key advance
in our understanding of the role of stress in certain forms of
vision loss. It establishes a link between human psychology
EPMA Journal
 (state of mind), pathophysiological susceptibility (endothelial
integrity), and the biological stress response (stress hormone
release signature), the combination of which leads (or at least
predisposes) to vision loss. FS is most obvious in younger
patients that have NTG, but the principles we learn from FS
may also apply to other diseases of the visual system.
According to Flammer, the FS is inherited and its objective
signs (such as endothelial dysfunction, capillary reaction to
cold stress, altered gene expression, etc.) are stable across
the life span, with or without stress. But FS persons (F+) react
differently to stress than those without Flammer signs (F−).
Their response to emotional stress includes vasoconstriction,
whereas FS− subjects react with an imbalance of the ANS,
which lead to tachycardia, high blood pressure, IOP rise,
stomach pain, gastrointestinal upset, etc.
Stress, especially in younger patients with FS+, can
provoke acute diseases such as AION or retinal venous
vasoconstrictions because of vascular endotheliopathy.
This vasoconstriction does not seem to be the result of
stress hormone exposure alone. Rather, persons with vas-
cular endotheliopathy are more susceptible to stress, i.e.,
with an altered responsiveness to stress hormones (mainly
adrenalin and endothelin), to cold provocation, low atmo-
spheric pressure at high altitudes, and mechanical insults.
FS is thus the result of an interaction of genotype (biology)
and psychology (= stress perception); though there may
also be epigenetic mechanisms involved. Endothelial mi-
tochondrial dysfunction seems to be the subcellular source
of the problem [66] and this dysfunction is the only influ-
ence on the smooth muscles in the retina vessels, which
are not controlled by the ANS.
These observations suggest that glaucomatous optic neu-
ropathy (GON) is not only the result of some sort of
Bmechanical insult^ due to elevated IOP on the optic nerve
head (ONH) with subsequent degeneration of the inner layer
of retina and optic nerve. As the FS demonstrates, this
Bmechanical^ view of glaucoma is too simplistic because
GON pathology is more complex. GON (i) involves not only
the eye but the entire optic pathway including other parts of
the brain, (ii) GON can develop at either elevated or normal
IOP levels, and (iii) ocular blood flow (OBF) is reduced which
affects not only the eye but also other body parts such as nail
fold capillaries [67] and possibly the brain.
But not everyone with FS develops glaucoma because mul-
tiple co-factors have to be present: certain triggering factors,
oxidative stress, reduced Brepair^ capacities, and a
personality-based insufficient stress resilience (e.g. coping
problems). FS is more prevalent in women (70%), and FS
patients tend to be slender, have typically indoor rather than
outdoor jobs, and they are more likely academics than blue
collar workers [54]. And there are other symptoms such as
prolonged sleep onset time, prolonged blood flow cessation
in the finger capillaries after cooling, autoregulation problems
of ocular blood flow, increased retinal venous pressure, stiff-
ness of retinal vessels, and increased oxidative stress. FS+
individuals have also generally increased sensitivities to cer-
tain drugs, high altitudes (lower atmospheric pressure) chang-
es, vibration, and pain sensation [54].
FS is influenced by environmental factors and genetic pre-
dispositions. And also FS patients have a characteristic psy-
chology: FS+ patients are often worrisome and remarkably
assiduous, sportive, and ambitious, with a tendency toward
perfectionism. Such patients seem to have an urge to be good
to everyone (like BAngles^) and fulfill first and foremost
needs of others like their spouses, family, friends, and co-
workers. However, by being so good to others, they neglect
their own emotional needs and desires. It is as if their brain is
solely focused toward the social fabric in the outside world,
neglecting the own self. Such persons tend to be ruled by self-
denial and—to use psychoanalytic terms—their Bsuper-ego^
(strictly observing duties, rules, and satisfying expectations)
dominates their BIt^ (pleasure, joy, emotional satisfaction).
This super-ego domination, however, leads to long-lasting
self-deprivation, increasing the level of anxiety, and fear with
risk of depression. In fact, the FS bears similarities with the
Takotsubo syndrome, a stress-induced cardiomyopathy,
which also affects mostly women that have a similar psychol-
ogy [68].
Because of these personality traits, FS patients experience
chronic mental stress. The source of this trait is rather different
among different individuals, but childhood adversity and
programmed stress sensitivity may be among possible
causes. Two patients the author (BS) has seen in the clinic
had reported sexual abuse in their childhood, and this trau-
ma may have led, with a speculative pretext, to pro-
grammed (learned) stress sensitivity. FS symptoms and
signs—resulting from the common denominator of endo-
thelial dysfunction in conjunction with chronic stress—
are examples that certain low vision problems are, at least
in part, psychosomatic disorders.
From a clinical perspective, vascular dysregulation is not
limited to the eye but it is found also in non-eye diseases.
Concerning eye diseases, FS is found in normal-tension glau-
coma, retinitis pigmentosa [69], increased retinal venous pres-
sure due to a dysregulation of venous outflow from the eye
[53, 70], retinal vein occlusion [71], optic nerve compartment
syndrome [54], and preoperative ischemic optic neuropathy
[72]. Other body parts affected by FS are inner ear with dis-
eases such as tinnitus or sudden hearing loss [54], and it may
play a role in other diseases such as multiple sclerosis [73]
(Figure 2).
In summary, the syndrome that Flammer has uncovered is a
more holistic perspective of mechanisms underlying some
diseases of vision loss. It considers different levels of analysis
including molecular, cellular, physiological, and behavioral
(psychological) symptoms.
EPMA Journal
 Vision loss: a psychosomatic disorder?
Others have also suggested psychosomatic components in vi-
sion loss, some looking upon it as a consequence, but others as
a cause. The available literature is summarized in Table 2 and
some psychosomatic considerations are now discussed.
Though the general consensus seems to be that stress is only
the consequence of vision loss, numerous studies indicate that
stress can be a triggering (or risk) factor for visual impairment.
Though it is unclear if stress alone is a sufficient condition to
induce vision loss, it is a least a well-recognized and critical
co-factors when other pathological conditions are present,
such as arteriosclerosis, inflammation, or, as in the case of
FS, an endothelial dysfunction.
Non-organic vision loss
One rather frequent observation is quite revealing: vision loss
can happen without any indication of pathological abnormal-
ities as examined with blood tests, electrophysiological eval-
uation, retina imaging, computed tomography (CT), or mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI). These cases are referred to as
non-organic or functional vision loss [15]. Except for pur-
poseful feigning or exaggeration of symptoms, many of these
non-organic visual disorders are called somatoform or conver-
sion disorders [74]. In addition, vision loss has been associat-
ed with psychosocial problems. For example, Lim [75] report-
ed that 36% of 140 adults and children with vision impairment
reported concomitant psychosocial problems such as psycho-
logical trauma in adulthood or problems with their social in-
teractions in childhood.
Glaucoma
Odberg [76, 77] examined the psychological impact of glau-
coma in 589 patients and found that 80% reported negative
emotional reactions after knowing that they had glaucoma and
one third were afraid of going blind. Higher levels of anxiety
[78, 79] and depression [80, 81] have been reported in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) than in those
with open-angle glaucoma (POAG) [82]. Younger age was
found to be a risk factor for anxiety, while an older age and
increased glaucoma severity were risk factors for depression
[83]. Diniz-Fiho [84] reported that faster progression of visual
field loss in glaucoma was associated with the occurrence of
depressive symptoms.
AMD
There is little literature on the psychological impact of AMD.
Casten [85] studied 114 elderly AMD patients and found high
rates of depression which exacerbates physical disability.
Similarly, other group [86] tested 86 elderly adults with
AMD and found them to suffer significant emotional distress
with profoundly reduced QOL and impairments in their daily
activities. Psychological control strategies were studied in 90
AMD patients by Wahl et al. [87]. Shortly after the initial
diagnosis, the patients used compensatory primary control
strategies which were related to functional loss in instrumental
daily activities. But within 1 year, there was an increase in
compensatory secondary control strategies which were asso-
ciated with functional loss in instrumental daily activities.
Thus, the strategies of control play a role in coping with an-
ticipated or real functional loss.
Retinitis pigmentosa
Retinitis pigmentosa is a set of hereditary retinal diseases
characterized by degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors
[88]. A group of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients (n = 970)
also showed significant anxiety and intense phobic pathology
[89]. Greater visual field (VF) variability was found to be
associated with reduced visual fields, less physical activity,
or increased negative psychosocial states [90]. Hahm [91]
found that patients with depression have worse vision than
those without depression.
Myopia
Myopia, a condition where light focuses in front of rather than
on the retina, is mainly caused by anomalies in shape of eye-
ball and imprecise refraction by the optical system of the eye
(cornea, lens). While myopia can be fixed by glasses or con-
tact lenses, myopia is not merely a physical problem. Rather,
contrary to generally held belief, it also depends on the psy-
chological state. Until now, it is not clear if stress could have a
causal role in myopia. While Angi [92] found that the person-
ality profile and psychophysical stress did not play a role in
the pathophysiology of myopia, Avetisov [93] concluded that
acute psychogenic stress could lead to myopia. After the 1988
earthquake in Armenia, they examined 762 residents who had
never complained of their vision before but 30% developed
pseudo-myopia. Pseudo-myopia is caused by a spasm in cili-
ary muscles, which thickens the lens and shortens the focal
length by a shift of the focal point away from the retina rather
than on it. In fact, pseudo-myopia is thought to be caused (at
least in part) by an imbalanced autonomic nervous system
function, here parasympathetic activation [94].
It is conceivable that vision acuity loss is affected by mental
stress (and/or fatigue) because stress might lead to tension of
the tissues and muscles around the eyes, changing the shape of
the eye ball. And vision acuity could be modulated by prob-
lems with eye muscle tone, eye movements (microsaccades),
vascular changes in the eye or brain, or by brain mechanisms
of visual signal resolution.
EPMA Journal
 Other ocular diseases
There are reports of other eye conditions with psychosomatic
involvement as well. This includes dry eye syndrome (DES)
which is caused, among other reasons, by low tear production.
Psychological stress is well known to result in a sympathetic
predominance of the ANS which reduces the activity of bodily
glands, such as saliva and tear production. When Li et al. [95]
compared 89 DES patients with 73 control subjects, DES
patients scored high on anxiety and depression on the Zung
Self Rating Anxiety Scales (SAS) and Zung Self Rating
Depression Scales (SDS) which correlated significantly
with the DES scores of the Ocular Surface Disease Index
(OSDI).
Scrutiny, analysis, and interpretation of all the available
evidence of associations between psychosomatic indicators
and vision loss is beyond the scope of this paper. Table 2
however, lists the available references. Many papers are silent
with regard to the issue of whether stress is cause or conse-
quence; to this effect, those that are explicit about it, half argue
in favor of stress as a consequence of vision loss and the other
half as a cause.
Mental stress and personality
Psychology is the science of mind and behavior, including all
aspects of conscious and unconscious experiences as well as
thought (cognition) [13]. When a person suffers from
prolonged psychological (mental) stress, this reduces QOL
and is a burden to him/her and also to their social environment
[14]. People have different mechanisms for coping with stress,
i.e., being able to react to stress in an adaptive manner. But if
stress is too high or lasts too long, or if the person does not
have sufficient resilience capacities or coping skills because of
his/her personality disposition, mental fatigue, burnout, anxi-
ety/fear, or depression may ensue. This can go hand-in-hand
with organic/somatic problems like feeling non-organic pain
or non-organic vision loss [15, 74, 75], especially if such
persons have a predisposing genotype. There are many dis-
eases in medicine that are characterized by both somatic and
psychological aspects, and psychosomatic medicine is a well-
established discipline. Its task is to help reducing the impact of
psychological problems to improve patient’s well-being and
providing coping resources for their physical diseases or dis-
abilities [48, 49, 67, 84, 85, 91, 96, 97]. But because diseases
of the visual system have traditionally been viewed as an
exclusive affair of biology and physics (optics), the interaction
between ophthalmology and psychosomatic medicine is prac-
tically non-existent.
If an individual is resilient or susceptible to stressors de-
pends largely on their personality. Maladaptive coping strate-
gies and specific personality patterns are found in patients
with glaucoma [98–100]. Mabuchi [101] observed that
PAOG patients have significantly higher mean neuroticism
scores (N), and agreeableness (A) as well as conscientiousness
(C) were significantly lower in male POAG patients. The
mean extraversion score (E) was significantly lower in female
POAG patients. Freeman et al. [98] observed that those pa-
tients that use denial when confronted with their first POAG
diagnosis had a faster progression of the visual field loss.
Individuals who are blind or have low vision face the con-
stant challenge of psychologically and socially adjusting to
their disability [102]. A person’s personality determines if
their coping strategy is sufficient to handle stressful events
or not. Meta-analyses [103] link optimism, extraversion, con-
scientiousness, openness, and agreeableness to more engage-
ment in coping; so does, in contrast, neuroticism which leads
to less disengagement in coping [94]. Benn [104] studied two
personality traits: neuroticism and optimism and five coping
strategies: distancing, accepting responsibility, escape-avoid-
ance, effective problem solving, and positive reappraisal. The
result indicates that personality and coping (primarily
distancing and escape-avoidance) appeared to exert their ef-
fects directly on adaptation. Neuroticism and escape-
avoidance were associated with reduced adaptation, and opti-
mism and distancing were related to greater adaptation. It is
well known that adaptation through coping is a psychological
defense mechanism. Tolman et al. [105] used the BAdaptation
to Vision Loss Scale^ and tested 144 patients with AMD. The
study suggested that legally blind older adults with AMD who
were more adapted to their vision reported fewer depressive
symptoms.
This puts the studies by Flammer in context. He observed
that the FS happens more frequently in females (70%) and FS
women tend to be characterized by stereotypic feminine tra-
ditional gender socialization, which is an important determi-
nant for anger suppression and all the FS+ signs [106].
To summarize, since personality traits determine how a
person reacts to everyday stressors and because many patients
with vision loss (especially glaucoma) are poorly adapted to
stress, we propose that patients with specific personality traits
related to negative coping styles are more prone to vision loss
and its progression. If it is agreed that prolonged mental stress
can be a major (though not only) cause of vision loss, then
ophthalmologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other relat-
ed professionals should be encouraged to offer stress manage-
ment interventions to vision loss patients with the goal to
reduce stress and thus prevent or halt the progression of vision
loss. Furthermore, if such stress reduction methods are suc-
cessful, then conclusive evidence is needed for the proposition
that stress is causal, and not just the consequence of vision
loss. The study that meditation can normalize IOP is one such
study (Faiq et al. 2018, submitted), and many several other
observation show how stress reduction can help in the man-
agement of vision loss.

 Psychological treatments to reduce stress
in vision loss
Considering the discussion above, relaxation, psychotherapy,
or other stress reduction programs should be helpful in reduc-
ing the impact of low vision. There are several such reports in
the literature. For example, relaxation and visual imagery
techniques can reduce IOP [107], psychotherapy can be ben-
eficial for glaucoma patients during surgical or drug therapy
[108], and meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, and coping
strategies can help people reduce stress [109–112].
In fact, relaxation techniques and psychotherapy are the
most promising methodologies with a potential to reduce the
progression of vision loss or even improve vision recovery.
Relaxation to counteract stress has always been part of human
societies, ranging from hallucinogenic drugs (such as legal use
of marijuana) to music and sports, and it is practiced in different
schools of thought, religions, wellness programs, and psychol-
ogy institutions. Furthermore, relaxation is part of traditional
(alternative) medicine and healing traditions and has recently
become the focus of modern evidence-based medicine.
There are many every-day activities that can help people to
relax and enhance their well-being such as sports, reading,
sleeping, mind-wandering, prayer, or listening to music. But
if the level of stress and tension is too high or consistently
persistent for long periods, these everyday methods may be
insufficient and more systematic and powerful relaxation tech-
niques are needed to calm down the body and mind. Such
techniques include meditation (transcendental and mindful-
ness meditation), yoga, autogenic training, progressive muscle
relaxation, fantasy journeys, or slow/deep breathing exercises
(Bpranayama^). What they all have in common is that they
counteract stress and tension by rebalancing the autonomic
system by reducing sympathetic and activating parasympa-
thetic nervous system activity. Such relaxation techniques
have a positive impact on all levels of the psycho-neuro-
endocrine axis.
For example, meditation counteracts symptoms of the
stress response by slowing the breathing rate, relaxing mus-
cles, and normalizing blood pressure [113, 114]. On the bio-
chemical level of analysis, relaxation increases levels of plas-
ma endorphins, endogenous opioid neuropeptides which, in
turn, inhibits pain signaling and triggers the feeling of
euphoria [115]. Meditation also influences a plethora of
molecular processes including oxidative metabolism,
epigenetics, gene repair, aging, blood pressure, organ system
maintenance, and neuroendocrine health (Dada et al. 2017,
unpublished; [116]) and it can improve cardiovascular
functions [117] and counteract brain aging-associated changes
[118]. In fact, even a single session of relaxation can acutely
reduce IOP [119].
Despite this long tradition, relaxation techniques are some-
how novel for the treatment of visual disorders.
Several biological mechanisms are influenced by relaxa-
tion exercises, which ameliorate POAG. Endorphins, by way
of modulation of the brain’s arcuate nucleus [120], can be
beneficial through its ability to reduce IOP in rabbits [121,
122], appease depression symptoms and cortisol levels [123]
with concomitant decrease in blood pressure [124].
Relaxation techniques where shown to be able to reduce IOP
[125], improve neuroendocrine regulation [111] of ciliary
body production of aqueous humor and normalize IOP
[126]. Furthermore, relaxation brings down inflammation
and decreases glial activation [127, 128]. It also elevates brain
and aqueous nitric oxide [129], improves outflow pathways,
and normalizes IOP [130]. Other observations related to re-
laxation are improved glutamate metabolism and decreased
glutamate-mediated toxicity [131], modulation of extracellu-
lar matrix, and the integrity of the trabecular meshwork to
maintain aqueous outflow, improved perfusion of cerebral tis-
sue [132], and parallel gene expression changes through epi-
genetic modulation [133].
Though relaxation techniques may be viewed with some
skepticism because of their traditional use in esoteric or reli-
gious contexts, different relaxation techniques are, nevertheless,
systematic and powerful modulators of nervous system func-
tion with a widespread impact on both mental and bodily
health. Moreover, in modern medicine, everything is subject
to validation. Relaxation-based techniques and their efficacy
can be—and have been—validated through well-designed clin-
ical trials with methodological rigor and empirical reasoning.
Meditation
Meditation encompasses a family of complex practices that
include mindfulness meditation, mantra meditation, yoga, tai
chi, and chi gong [134, 135]. Meditation was shown to in-
crease parasympathetic activity to reinstate sympathovagal
balance [136] and help patients to cope with their clinical
and non-clinical problems [137]. In a classical study of
short-term yoga-based meditation, Netam et al. [138] found
reduced IL6 levels in patients with chronic inflammatory con-
ditions, and mind-body therapies reduced inflammation
markers [139]. In a recent randomized trial (Dada et al.
2017, unpublished), a 3-week meditation-based stress reduc-
tion program significantly normalized IOP, reduced stress bio-
markers, and changed gene expression in such a way so as to
help induce a neurotrophic response.
Music therapy
Music has been used since ancient times to enhance well-
being and reduce pain and suffering [140]. Steady rhythms
entrain regular respiratory patterns, and listening to classical
music increases heart rate variability (a measure of cardiac
autonomic balance), whereas listening to noise or rock music
EPMA Journal
 decreases heart rate variability [141, 142]. A meta-analysis
[143] indicates that music alone and music-assisted relaxation
techniques significantly decreases arousal due to stress. In the
Knight study [144], 89 undergraduate students were exposed
to a cognitive stressor task. This significantly increased their
anxiety, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure. But when they
were exposed to music therapy, there was a significant reduc-
tion of anxiety by 28%, in systolic blood pressure by 26% and
in heart rate by 36%.
Biofeedback
Biofeedback is a method of gaining greater awareness of the
body’s physiological state using instruments that provide in-
formation on the activity of different bodily parameters such
as brain wave activity, muscle tone, heart rate, or skin temper-
ature. The goal is learn to manipulate these functions at will to
achieve a state of relaxation [145]. Though biofeedback has
been used to improve visual fields in patients [146], it has so
far only been used as a means to induce relaxation in normally
seeing subjects. Amore et al. [146] reported that biofeedback-
relaxation can increase finger temperature and cardiac output
and decrease systemic vascular resistance and respiratory rate.
Likewise, Moser et al. [147] employed biofeedback-assisted
relaxation which increased fingertip temperatures. Also,
Bernat and coworkers [148] and Del Pozo et al. [149] used
it to increase heart rate variability in patients with coronary
artery disease. Besides des Amore study, the application of
biofeedback to improve the condition of low vision patients
(here: AMD) has not been studied at all.
Autogenic training
Autogenic training is a relaxation technique introduced by the
German psychologist Schultz early last century (1932). It was
used for the treatment of ophthalmological diseases by
Strempel and her colleagues who reported it to be beneficial
for IOP normalization in open-angle glaucoma patients. Each
patient’s IOP could be reduced by an average of 3 mmHg, and
it benefited their psychological state. At the end of the exper-
iment, 43% of her patients reduced or even stopped taking eye
drops. The other 57% of the patients continued to take their
medicine or changed their medicine with associated IOP re-
duction to levels well below their lowest values before [107,
150, 151].
Coping strategies
There are different strategies for better coping with medical
problems. They include cognitive restructuring such as opti-
mism (looking not only at the rear mirror but looking for-
ward), looking at the situation in relative terms such as Bthere
are so many worse things^ to keep vision loss in perspective
[152]. Other methods are focusing on what one can still do
and not dwelling in the past, positive social comparisons
[153], and a positive prognosis that there are different means
to improve vision or ways to compensate for the loss. There
are also more general methods to help with emotional anger
including psychotherapy or even simply Bkicking and
screaming^ [152]. Considering that a negative problem orien-
tation significantly predicted depression and emotional dis-
tress, while rational problem-solving skills predicted life sat-
isfaction [154], Garnefski concluded that both cognitive and
goal-related coping could be an important intervention for
patients with vision loss [155].
Another interesting intervention to improve coping in pa-
tients with vision loss was described by Bryan and Lu [156].
They studied patients with Stargardt’s disease, a rare condition
of macular degeneration who received an expressive writing
intervention for 3 to 6 weeks. This had a positive impact on
their psychological health outcomes at 3-week follow-up and
self-reported physical health at 6-week follow-up. The authors
suggest that expressive writing is an effective, practical, and
low-cost psychological intervention to improve QOL.
Social support
Decreased visual acuity, visual field loss, or blurred (Bfoggy^)
vision are also associated with decreased QOL [157]. Family
members can play an important role in the adaptation of pa-
tients, providing encouragement for the initiation and comple-
tion of rehabilitative services [158, 159]. In Reinhardt’s [160]
study, scores for support by family members were higher than
those for friend. As compared to friends, family members are
relied upon more often for both instrumental (practical) and
emotional support [161].
Conclusions and expert recommendations
On the one hand, vision loss reduces subjective QOL due to
anxiety, fear, and depression, i.e., stress being the conse-
quence of low vision. On the other hand, we now propose that
mental stress is also a cause of different visual diseases, per-
haps even the main cause of some of them. Both cause and
consequence interact in a downward spiral manner. Stress
leads to vision loss which causes stress, which in turn worsens
the vision loss, making the stress even worse and so on (Fig.
2). It is important for doctors, researchers, caregivers, and
patients to know about this downward spiral and finding ways
of breaking it. Owing to the extensive interactions between the
eye, brain, and vascular system, ophthalmological diseases are
not only a matter of physics and biology but also one of the
psychology and the persons’ state of mind (Sabel, Flammer,
Merabet, unpublished). An increased understanding of the
precise biological mechanisms that translates stress into visual
EPMA Journal
 disease may open up completely new mechanism-driven/path-
ophysiology-informed intervention strategies that directly tar-
get these mechanisms.
This new psychosomatic perspective has several implica-
tions for clinical practice. (i) Stress reduction and relaxation
techniques should be recommended not only as complemen-
tary to traditional treatments of vision loss but possibly as
preventive means to reduce progression of vision loss. (ii)
Doctors should try their best to inculcate positivity and opti-
mism in their patients while giving them the information the
patients are entitled to, especially regarding the important val-
ue of stress reduction and relaxation. Statements of a grim
future such as Byou will go blind^ should be strictly avoided.
This induces unnecessary anxiety and fear, possibly acceler-
ating vision loss progression (Fig. 4). (iii) Medical treatments
might aim at reducing the biochemical effects of stress hor-
mones on the blood vasculature, and (iv) various psycholog-
ical interventions, well established in clinical psychology such
as coping strategies, relaxation techniques, or psychotherapy
should become adjuvant methods of standard ophthalmologic
care. In this spirit, the relationship of stress and vision loss can
help reach the recently proposed need to turn more attention to
predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine as outlined
by Golubnitschaja et al. [162]. BPredictive^ because the level
of mental stress could help predict how vision loss progresses
on the one hand and predicting the outcome of new therapies
on the other hand. BPreventive^ in that reducing or preventing
stress could reduce the progression and/or prevent the devel-
opment of vision loss. And Bindividualized^ in that it helps
tailor medical and psychological interventions to the individ-
ual patients psychomedical needs and personal circumstances.
The FS is thus a kind of Brediscovery^ that psychosocial
factors play a crucial role in ophthalmological diseases. By
linking the concept of biological stress, vascular dysregula-
tion, and vision loss, Josef Flammer has provided new insight
into the tight interaction of biological and psychological
factors in glaucoma. In that sense, the discovery of the
Flammer syndrome offers ophthalmology a holistic perspec-
tive that vision loss may not just be a problem of physics and
biology, but also one of the human mind. This will help to fill
the void of the long felt need by many patients that their
subjective experiences and feelings regarding vision loss mat-
ter and should not be ignored. Considering psychosomatic
factors offers new leads for interventions to supplement
existing concepts of treating vision loss by means that go
beyond mere eye drops and surgery. In that sense, the
Flammer syndrome is a starting point for the dawn of psycho-
somatic ophthalmology. Such a new path will help us address
the most important subject matter: the person behind the eye.
