IMPORTANCE Demonstrating that success of Descemet stripping automated endothelial
keratoplasty is similar across donor cornea preservation times (PTs) could increase the
donor pool.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether the 3-year rate of graft success using corneal donor tissue
preserved 8 to 14 days is noninferior to that of donor tissue preserved 7 days or less.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter, double-masked, randomized
noninferiority clinical trial was conducted from April 16, 2012, to June 5, 2017, at 40 clinical
sites (70 surgeons) in the United States, with donor corneas provided by 23 US eye banks.
A total of 1090 individuals (1330 study eyes) underwent Descemet stripping automated
endothelial keratoplasty (1255 eyes [94.4%] for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy).
INTERVENTIONS Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty with random
assignment of a donor cornea with a PT of 7 days or less (0-7d PT) or 8 to 14 days (8-14d PT).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Graft success at 3 years.
RESULTS Of the 1090 participants (1330 study eyes; 60.2% women and 39.8% men; median
age at enrollment, 70 years [range, 42-90 years]), the 3-year cumulative probability of graft
success was 95.3% (95% CI, 93.6%-96.9%) in the 0-7d PT group and 92.1% (95% CI,
89.9%-94.2%) in the 8-14d PT group (difference, 3.2%). The upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI
on the difference was 5.4%, exceeding the prespecified noninferiority limit of 4%. The
difference was mostly owing to more primary donor failures in the 8-14d PT group, with the
conditional probability of failure after the first month being 2.4% in the 0-7d PT group and
3.1% in the 8-14d PT group. In preplanned secondary analyses, longer PT was associated with
a lower rate of graft success (unadjusted hazard ratio for graft failure per additional day of PT,
1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18; P = .008 [PT analyzed as days]), with success rates of 96.5% (95% CI,
92.3%-98.4%) for PT of 4 days or less, 94.9% (95% CI, 92.5%-96.6%) for PT of 5 to 7 days,
93.8% (95% CI, 91.0%-95.8%) for PT of 8 to 11 days, and 89.3% (95% CI, 84.4%-92.7%) for
PT of 12 to 14 days (P = .01 [PT analyzed as categorical variable]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 3-year success rate in eyes undergoing Descemet
stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty was high irrespective of PT. However, the study
was unable to conclude that the success rate with donor corneas preserved 8 to 14 days was
similar to that of corneas preserved 7 days or less with respect to the prespecified
noninferiority limit. Although longer PT was associated with a lower success rate, the
difference in rates was small when PT was less than 12 days.

The Cornea Preservation Time Study (CPTS) was de-
signed to definitively determine the effect of PT on graft suc-
cess and endothelial cell loss.12 Eyes undergoing Descemet
strippingautomatedendothelialkeratoplasty(DSAEK)forcon-
ditions associated with endothelial dysfunction and moder-
ate risk for graft failure (Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy
[FECD] or pseudophakic or aphakic corneal edema) were con-
sidered optimal for addressing the study objective. Descemet
strippingautomatedendothelialkeratoplastywaschosensince
it was the most common keratoplasty procedure being per-
formed for these conditions at the time of study initiation.17
Primary graft outcome results for the 3-year randomized clini-
cal trial are reported herein. Results on PT and long-term en-
dothelial cell loss are reported in a companion article.18
Methods
Enrollment occurred between April 16, 2012, and February 20,
2014,andfollow-upendedonJune5,2017.Studyoversightwas
providedbyanindependentdataandsafetymonitoringcommit-
tee.Studymethodshavebeenpublished12andaresummarized
below. The protocol is available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2
/show/NCT01537393 and Supplement 1. The protocol was ap-
provedbyinstitutionalreviewboardsforparticipatingsites(eAp-
pendix 2 in Supplement 2), and each participant provided writ-
ten informed consent, with consent requested again to extend
follow-up from 36 months to a common study end date.
Clinical sites, eye banks, surgeons, and ancillary staff were
certified prior to study participation. Surgeons were required
to have performed at least 50 DSAEK cases, with a reported
primarydonorfailurerateoflessthan3%andadislocationrate
requiring repositioning or rebubbling of less than 15% in the
prior year. All eye banks were accredited by the Eye Bank As-
sociation of America.
Eligible participants were 30 to 90 years of age and under-
going DSAEK for FECD or pseudophakic or aphakic corneal
edema.Eyeswereexcludediftheyhadafailedpenetratingkera-
toplasty (PKP) or DSAEK, tube shunts, uncontrolled glaucoma,
anteriorchamberintraocularlenses,orperipheralanteriorsyn-
echiae spanning more than one-fourth of the anterior chamber
angle. Both eyes of a participant could be enrolled.
Donor corneas met Eye Bank Association of America stan-
dards for DSAEK,19 including the following criteria: donor age
of 10 to 75 years, time from death to preservation at 20 hours
or fewer if the donor body was refrigerated or 10 hours or fewer
if not refrigerated, eye bank–determined central endothelial
cell density of 2300 cells/mm2 or more, no more than mild
(slight) polymorphism or polymegethism, absence of guttae,
and no evidence of central endothelial cell damage, trauma,
or dystrophy. Donor pairs were placed in either Optisol-GS or
Life 4°C, as preferred by each eye bank.
Randomization to either the group that received a donor
cornea with a PT of 7 days or less (0-7d PT group) or a group
that received a donor cornea with a PT of 8 to 14 days (8-14d
PT group) was stratified by surgeon (G.O.R., A.J.A, S.P.D., T.M.,
S.P., R.D.S., M.A.T., E.Y.T., and D.D.V; eAppendix 1 in
Supplement2)usingapermutedblocksdesign.Whenbotheyes
of a participant were included in the study, the eye undergo-
ing surgery first was assigned randomly to a PT group and the
second eye was assigned to the other PT group. A minimiza-
tion algorithm was used to achieve a balance of preplanned PT
subgroups (PT of 0-4 days, 5-7 days, 8-11 days, and 12-14 days).
Only eyes that had surgery using the CPTS-assigned donor cor-
neas were included in the analyses. The numbers and rea-
sonsforrandomizedeyesexitingthestudypriortosurgeryand
deviations from the randomization assignments for 3 cases are
shown in Figure 1.
Eye banks or surgeons prepared the donor cornea accord-
ing to their customary technique. Under specific authoriza-
tion by the Eye Bank Association of America, surgeons were
masked to all data about donor corneas except for storage so-
lution, residual bed thickness following lamellar dissection,
Key Points
Question What is the effect of donor cornea preservation time on
the success of Descemet stripping automated endothelial
keratoplasty 3 years after the procedure?
Findings In this randomized noninferiority clinical trial, the 3-year
success rate of Descemet stripping automated endothelial
keratoplasty using a donor cornea preserved 8 to 14 days did not
meet the study’
s definition of noninferiority compared with a
preservation time of 7 days or less (92.1% vs 95.3%), principally
owing to a lower success rate with preservation time of 12-14 days.
Meaning Success of Descemet stripping automated endothelial
keratoplasty is higher with shorter preservation time, but
preservation time up to 11 days can be expected to have little
influence on outcomes.

 and observations captured during preparation of donor tis-
sue. Preoperative care, surgical technique, and postoperative
care were provided according to each investigator’
s routine.
Follow-up examinations were performed at 1 day, 1 week,
and 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the procedure.12 Partici-
pants consenting to the extension of the study had additional
visits at 48 and 60 months, if possible, prior to study conclu-
sion.Examinationprocedureswereconductedaccordingtothe
investigator’
s standard practices. A standardized grading scale
was used to categorize clarity of the recipient’
s central cornea
stroma by a certified examiner as clear, equivocal, or cloudy,12
as defined in eTable 1 in Supplement 2. All investigators were
trained, tested, and certified on this assessment using a vali-
dated photographic guide.12
Graft Failure
Graft failure was defined as the occurrence of 1 of the follow-
ing: regrafting for any reason, a cloudy or equivocally cloudy
cornea on the first postoperative day that did not clear within
8 weeks, or a cornea that was initially clear postoperatively but
becameandremainedcloudyfor90days.Thedateofgraftfail-
ure was the first examination during the failure event in which
the cornea was cloudy or the date of regraft if the cornea was
not documented as cloudy prior to regraft. The determina-
tion of graft failure was made by the certified surgeon inves-
tigator, centrally tracked, and confirmed by the coordinating
center and ultimately the study chair (J.H.L.) using the above
definition. Graft failure status for corneas that were cloudy for
fewer than 3 months at the last available visit or the 3-year visit
was determined by the study chair with advice from the ex-
ecutive committee. The principal causes of graft failure were
classified as defined in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 1330 study eyes was computed based on a
1-sided noninferiority test under the following assumptions:
1:1 distribution of corneas between the 2 PT groups, α = .05,
power = 0.90, 94% success rate in each PT group, a noninfe-
riority limit of 4%, and 10% incomplete follow-up. Kaplan-
Meier estimates of 3-year graft success with 95% CIs
(Greenwood estimate of variance20) were calculated for
each PT group, and a 1-sided 95% CI was constructed for the
difference. A bootstrap resampling technique was used to ac-
count for potentially correlated data from 2 study eyes of the
same participant; the 95% CI was calculated with bias correc-
tion. Confounding and treatment interactions were assessed
in Cox proportional hazards regression models.
In preplanned secondary analyses using similar statisti-
cal methods, the effect of PT on graft success was evaluated
within predefined PT categories (0-4 days, 5-7 days, 8-11 days,
and 12-14 days) and as a continuous variable (days from pres-
ervation to surgery). A post hoc analysis similarly compared
the subgroup with a PT of 8 to 11 days with the 0-7d PT group.
Post hoc comparisons of PT groups with respect to postopera-
tive donor positioning issues were computed using Fisher ex-
act tests.
The 95% CI for evaluating the primary analysis of nonin-
feriority is 1-sided; all other 95% CIs and P values are 2-sided.
P < .05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were
conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Inc).

A total of 480 study eyes completed bilateral surgery (240 participants) and
850 eyes completed unilateral surgery. Deviations from preservation time (PT)
group assignment: 2 eyes had their assigned donor corneas inadvertently
switched and received the opposite of their intended PT group. This switch
resulted in 1 of these participants receiving a donor cornea in both study eyes
from the same PT group (the group that received a donor cornea with a PT of
8 to 14 days [8-14d PT group]). These cases are counted in the PT group as
treated. One participant received a donor cornea that was stored for 15 days
and was included in the 8-14d PT group. The lost-to-follow-up category includes
20 eyes with no data in the 3-year window but with data in the 4-year window;
these eyes were censored prior to 3 years in the primary analyses. Overall graft
failure was 31 in the group with PT of 0 to 7 days [0-7d PT group] and 50 in the
8-14d PT group; 1 graft failure in each PT group was censored owing to a severe
event unrelated to the PT. The 3-year-visit-completed category includes only
eyes without graft failure and includes 13 eyes that did not complete a 3-year
visit, but medical records were available to capture data either within the 3-year
window (35-42 months) or within the acceptable late out-of-window range
(42-44 months).

 Intraoperative and Postoperative Procedures
and Complications
The numbers and types of intraoperative procedures per-
formed in addition to DSAEK were similar between the 2 PT
groups (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). For 682 of the 1330 eyes
(51.3%), cataract extraction with a posterior chamber intra-
ocular lens placement was performed concurrently with
DSAEK. After DSAEK, all study eyes except 10 (4 in the 0-7d
PT group and 6 in the 8-14d PT group) were pseudophakic with
a posterior chamber intraocular lens. The rate of intraopera-
tive complications was low and was similar between the 2
groups (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Postoperatively,111of675eyes(16.4%)inthe0-7dPTgroup
and 143 of 655 eyes (21.8%) in the 8-14d PT group had at least
1 donor positioning issue (P = .01): dislocation (total detach-
ment) of donor in 33 eyes (4.9%) in the 0-7d PT group and 53
eyes (8.1%) in the 8-14d PT group, graft repositioning in the ab-
sence of dislocation in 4 eyes (0.6%) in the 0-7d PT group and
12 eyes (1.8%) in the 8-14d PT group, and detachment in the
absenceofeitherdislocationorrepositioningin74eyes(11.0%)
in the 0-7d PT group and 78 eyes (11.9%) in the 8-14d PT group
(eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Air injection was performed 1 or
more times in 54 eyes (8.0%) in the 0-7d PT group and 85 eyes
(13.0%) in the 8-14d PT group (P = .003).
One case of bacterial endophthalmitis (0.1%) occurred in
the 0-7d PT group 4 days after surgery, and 2 cases of fungal
keratitis (0.3%) occurred in the 8-14d PT group 13 and 43 days
after surgery (eTables 5 and 6 in Supplement 2). Other ocular
findings and postoperative procedures are in eTables 5-7 in
Supplement 2.
Study Completion
Overall, 584 study eyes (86.5%) in the 0-7d PT group and 558
study eyes (85.2%) in the 8-14d PT group either completed a

Excluding deaths prior to 3 years and accounting for partici-
pants who missed the 3-year visit but completed a subse-
quent visit, the study completion rate was 90.7% in the 0-7d

a All models accounted for correlated data from study participants with 2 study
corneas. (Since no donor pairs had multiple failures, models did not adjust for
random donor effect.)
bPotential confounders evaluated included the following: baseline endothelial
cell density, recipient and donor age, recipient and donor race/ethnicity,
presence of glaucoma, presence of corneal vessels, history of smoking,
storage solution, time from lamellar dissection to surgery, lamellar dissection
preparation by eye bank vs surgeon, and donor rim culture result. Factors from
univariate models with P < .10 were evaluated in a multivariate model, keeping
factors with P < .01 following a backward selection process. The final model
adjusted only for corneal diagnosis (prespecified to be forced in the analysis).
Random surgeon effects were explored using a frailty model with similar
results (P = .02).
c The primary model comparing 2 preservation time groups was used.
Preservation time subgroups were analyzed as categorical.
dThe primary model comparing 2 preservation time groups was used.
Preservation time was analyzed as a continuous variable in which preservation
time days’calculation was fractional based on hours.

Graft Outcome
The 3-year cumulative probability of graft success was 95.3%
(95% CI, 93.6%-96.9%) in the 0-7d PT group and 92.1% (95%
CI, 89.9%-94.2%) in the 8-14d PT group (difference between
groups, 3.2%) (Table 2). The upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI
of this difference was 5.4%, exceeding the prespecified non-
inferiority limit of 4%. The unadjusted hazard ratio for graft
failure in the 8-14d PT group compared with the 0-7d PT group
was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.09-2.71; P = .02), with no indication of con-
founding upon adjustment for covariates or statistical inter-
action (eTable 8 in Supplement 2). Most of the difference of
failure rates between the groups occurred in the first postop-
erative month, with the probability of failure in the first month
being 2.4% in the 0-7d PT group and 4.9% in the 8-14d PT
group, and the conditional probability of 3-year failure after

36. Available data beyond the
designated 3-year visit (or the cutoff
for the 3-year window when a 3-year
visit was not completed) were not
used in determination of failure
status or censor date for the primary
analyses. This protocol affected the
following: 20 eyes with no data in the
3-year window but with data in the
4-year window were censored prior
to 3 years in the primary analyses.
One eye initiated failure before the
end of the 3-year window but after
the 3-year visit date that did not
count as a 3-year failure in the
primary analysis. Data beyond the
3-year protocol window (35-42
months) but prior to the 4-year
window (42-44 months) were used
to determine failure status or censor
dates. This protocol affected the
following: 28 eyes were permitted to
complete their 3-year visit late out of
window between 42 and 44 months.
Four eyes did not complete a 3-year
visit, but medical records were
available to capture data between
42 and 44 months.

 the first month being 2.4% in the 0-7d PT group and 3.1% in
the 8-14d PT group (Figure 2A). Twenty-eight of 30 eyes in the
0-7d PT group and 44 of 49 eyes in the 8-14d PT group had a
regraft; the other 2 failures in the 0-7d PT group and 5 fail-
ures in the 8-14d PT group met the criteria for cloudy cornea
failure (of these, 1 eye in the 8-14d PT group had a cloudy cor-
nea for less than 3 months at the last study visit). The princi-
pal causes of graft failure are summarized in Table 3. As shown
in Table 2, in a preplanned secondary analysis treating PT as a
continuous variable, graft success tended to decrease as PT in-
creased (unadjusted hazard ratio for graft failure per addi-
tional day of PT, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18; P = .008). The 3-year
cumulative probability of graft success was lower (89.3%; 95%
CI, 84.4%-92.7% [N = 246]) for PT of 12 to 14 days, compared
with 96.5% (95% CI, 92.3%-98.4% [N = 173]) for PT of 4 days
or less, 94.9% (95% CI, 92.5%-96.6% [N = 502]) for PT of 5 to
7 days, and 93.8% (95% CI, 91.0%-95.8% [N = 409]) for PT of
8 to 11 days (Table 2 and Figure 2B; P = .01). In a post hoc analy-
sis, the difference in 3-year graft success rates comparing the
0-7d PT group (95.3%) with PT of 8 to 11 days (93.8%) was 1.5%
(95% CI, –1.3% to 4.4%). Graft success results through 4 years
were consistent with the 3-year primary outcome analysis
(eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
The CPTS determined whether the success rate of DSAEK with
donor corneas preserved for 8 to 14 days was noninferior to
that of corneas preserved 7 days or less in eyes with endothe-
lial dysfunction. To judge noninferiority, the end of the 1-sided
95% CI on the difference in success rates between the longer
and shorter PT groups was compared with a prespecified non-
inferiority limit of 4% (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). This crite-
rionwasbasedonjudgmentofthemagnitudeofdifferencethat
would be considered clinically insignificant. The study found
that,althoughtheobserveddifferencebetweenthe2PTgroups
was 3.2%, the end of the 95% CI was 5.4%, which exceeded
the predetermined 4% limit. Thus, the study cannot con-
clude that the success rate for donor corneas with PT of 8 to
14 days is similar to the success rate for donor corneas with a
shorter PT.
Analyzed as a continuous variable (days), there was a sig-
nificant association between longer PT and a lower graft suc-
cess rate. However, up to 11 days, the effect of PT on the graft
success rate was small, consistent with the endothelial cell loss
data reported in a companion article.18 These findings are clini-
cally important, as eye bank data have shown that more than
95% of donor corneas used domestically have a PT of less than
8 days.12 The CPTS results should encourage surgeons to ac-
cept corneas stored between 7 and 11 days. The success rate
was still high in the group with a PT of 12 to 14 days (89.3%),
which may support continued use of these stored tissues as
logistics dictate. Also, additional time to evaluate and distrib-
ute the donor tissue will be most helpful to eye banks.
The combined primary and early graft failure rate in the
first month was about twice as high in the 8-14d PT group as
it was in the 0-7d PT group, while the difference in failure rates
between groups after 1 month was small. This finding sug-
gests that loss of endothelial cell function during longer-term
storage leads to early failure in a small number of donor cor-
neas. Although the rate of primary donor failure was twice as
high in the 8-14d PT group vs the 0-7d PT group (3.4% vs 1.6%),
the overall 2.5% rate (33 of 1330 cases) of primary donor fail-
ure was below the selection criterion (<3%) for our surgeons
to participate in the CPTS.12 This rate was also comparable with
the mean 5% rate (range, 0%-29%) cited in the American Acad-
emy of Ophthalmology report summarizing estimates of pri-
mary failure reported in the literature at the time.23
Prior studies assessing the effect of PT on graft outcomes
of PKP13,14,24,25 and endothelial keratoplasty26-30 are limited.
Several studies have not shown an association between PT and
graft success, but PT was primarily 10 days or less.13,14,24,28
A retrospective PKP study showed no statistically significant
association between PT and graft success; however, only 62
of the 234 reported cases (26.5%) had storage times of 11 days
or more.14
The94.1%overallsuccessrate(1251of1330eyes)forDSAEK

is identical to what was projected in designing the study and
comparabletothatofsingle-sitestudiesforcasesofFECDman-

of DSAEK for pseudophakic or aphakic corneal edema and
failed cases of PKP or endothelial keratoplasty is significantly

 lower than that for FECD.35-37 The CPTS protocol was de-
signed to include only moderate-risk endothelial failure con-
ditions(FECDanduncomplicatedpseudophakicoraphakiccor-
neal edema) to minimize the number of grafts that would be
at higher risk for failure owing to other causes. The high suc-
cess rate reported in this article is not necessarily reflective of
the expected success rate for the entire population of pa-
tients with endothelial failure undergoing DSAEK. We report
a higher graft success rate with DSAEK in the surgical man-
agement of FECD at 3 years than in the Australian38 and United
Kingdom39 registries reports, possibly owing to the absence
of a learning curve with surgeons meeting minimum experi-
ence requirements for study participation.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of the study included a large sample size, masking
of surgeon and participant to PT, experienced DSAEK sur-
geons in both university and community settings, good reten-
tion, and a standardized definition of graft failure. Although
the CPTS cohort consisted principally of FECD cases (94.4%),
there is no biologically plausible reason to expect that the ef-
fect of PT on DSAEK success would be different for other cor-
nea conditions. We also hypothesize that these results may ap-
ply to the increasingly popular Descemet membrane
endothelial keratoplasty40,41 and to PKP,13,14 although this hy-
pothesis was not studied.
Conclusions
The 3-year success rate in eyes undergoing DSAEK predomi-
nantly for FECD was high irrespective of PT. Although the
study was unable to conclude that the success rate using
donor corneas preserved for 8 to 14 days was similar to that
of corneas preserved 7 days or less based on the study’
s pre-
determined definition of noninferiority, the difference in
rates was small when PT was less than 12 days. Therefore,
these results suggest that using donor corneas with PT up to
11 days is likely to have comparable success rates and that
donor corneas with PTs beyond 11 days could be used when
logistically necessary, as the success rate using these cor-
neas was also high.
