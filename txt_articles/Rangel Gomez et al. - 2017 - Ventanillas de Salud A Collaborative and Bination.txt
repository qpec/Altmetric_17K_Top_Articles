While individuals of Mexican origin are the largest immigrant group living in the U.S., this 
population is also the highest uninsured. Health disparities related to access to health 
care, among other social determinants, continue to be a challenge for this population. The 
government of Mexico, in an effort to address these disparities and improve the quality 
of life of citizens living abroad, has partnered with governmental and non-governmental 
health-care organizations in the U.S. by developing and implementing an initiative known 
as Ventanillas de Salud—Health Windows—(VDS). The VDS is located throughout the 
Mexican Consular network and aim to increase access to health care and health literacy, 
provide health screenings, and promote healthy lifestyle choices among low-income and 
immigrant Mexican populations in the U.S.

The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born into, grow from, live 
in, and work including a wide range of other forces and governmental and social systems that shape 
daily life (1). In immigrant groups, the social determinants of health are a combination of these 
conditions between the country of origin and the destination where migrant populations will form 
new lives subjected to new governmental, social, and culturally established infrastructures.
The U.S. census estimated 33 million individuals of Mexican origin resided in the U.S. in 2010. Of 
the 11.2 million undocumented immigrants in U.S. (2), an estimated 5.9 million were from Mexico 
(3). Health disparities and limited access to care continue in this population (4–6). By 2012, 53% 
of immigrants from Mexico lacked health insurance (7). By contrast, DeNavas-Walt et al. (8) found 
that only 13% of U.S. born individuals were uninsured in 2012. Furthermore, 61% of those born in 
Mexico, who work and contribute to the U.S. economy (18–64 years of age) reported lacking health 
insurance. This situation is not limited to this age group, according to the Health Needs Survey 
conducted by the Mexican Consulate General in Los Angeles in 2004. This survey reported that 49% 
of children born to Mexican parents in the U.S. lacked health insurance, notwithstanding, the state 
of California, which offered free insurance for low-income children of age 18 and under (9).
In the U.S., many factors impede Mexican immigrants accessing health services. These barri-
ers include the following: low socioeconomic status (4, 10), which is associated with educational

attainment, occupation, and income (11); limited English speak-
ing skills (3, 12–16); and immigration status (17–19). Moreover, 
place of residence and structural factors such as stigma, racism, 
and anti-immigrant policies further influence individual behav-
iors in accessing health services (20–22). Services offered in their 
preferred language are yet another factor (23), as well as family 
composition, such as mixed immigration status (22).
Given this background, in 2003, Mexico’s Ministry of Health 
created the Ventanillas de Salud (VDS) program as part of an 
unprecedented effort to use its Consular network to promote 
well-being in efforts to reduce health disparities among the 
Mexican diaspora in the U.S. (24–26). The VDS program aims 
to promote and enhance the health of Mexicans living abroad, 
particularly in the U.S. and offers an exceptional opportunity 
for partnerships with U.S. public health agencies (9). This article 
describes how the VDS program was created to address the 
most pressing health disparities within the immigrant Mexican 
population, the strategic alliances forged and the impact of this 
program. It further provides a description of the size and scope 
of the services offered through the VDS in 2013.
VDs Program (27)
In 2003, a pilot project providing information on basic health 
issues and access to preventive care was introduced in San Diego, 
CA, USA. The purpose of this pilot was to gather information 
concerning the main health problems and access to health services 
for immigrants of Mexican origin. This pilot program continued 
in 2004 with the aim of establishing the groundwork for replicat-
ing the model within the Mexican Consular Network in the U.S. 
Following the pilot and two evaluation studies conducted in 2004, 
the VDS program established 11 additional VDS between 2004 
and 2007 within the Mexican Consular Network. Between 2008 
and 2011, an additional 38 VDS opened for a total of 50 affiliated 
with the Mexican consulates that work closely and in partner-
ship with local health-care organizations. In 2012, Kansas City 
initiated a mobile unit and in 2013 New Jersey followed suit with 
a second mobile unit serving as the VDS outreach arm of their 
respective programs.
The VDS is the result of collaborative efforts between two 
federal agencies within the Mexican Government—Ministry of 
Health and Ministry of Foreign Affairs—working in partnership 
and cooperatively with U.S. governmental and non-governmental 
health-care organizations that provide the available and needed 
services. Currently, the government of Mexico provides monetary 
and in-kind resources to support the program in its entirety. These 
resources are in turn leveraged by the organizations, foundations, 
and local sponsors of each VDS. For example, federally qualified 
community health centers located throughout the U.S. provide 
primary and secondary prevention services on a sliding fee scale.
This network provides reliable information on health promo-
tion and disease prevention, counseling, and referrals to available, 
affordable, and accessible services to the immigrant Mexican 
population in the U.S. The program is designed to increase access 
to health-care services and health insurance enrollment, for 
those qualified, and decrease use of emergency medical services, 
thereby improving the physical and mental health of immigrant 
Latinos (9).
The VDS program offers a standard package of services across 
the 50 consulates (defined according to the main health issues 
identified for the Latino population, adjusted in some particular 
situations), and guarantee a culturally and linguistically sensitive 
services allowing clients to fully comprehend the nature and 
importance of health care and utilization of the existing health-
care infrastructure. The potential scope of the VDS is significant, 
since the Consular Network serves on average 1.5 million indi-
viduals annually through its 50 VDS.
The VDS is a unique model of binational collaboration linking 
Mexican Consulates, local health-care providers, and organiza-
tions dedicated to improving access to health-care services, 
providing a safe and secure environment for Mexican immigrants 
and their families living in the U.S. through information, health 
assessment, and health education.
The mission of the VDS is to provide disease prevention and 
health promotion services, which includes information about the 
medical and health insurance marketplace in Mexico and in the 
U.S., and referral to health-care services. It is up to the individual 
client to follow through in receiving needed services; although, 
a few of the VDS do provide navigators or health promotores 
(community health workers) that assist clientele in securing 
medical insurance from the marketplace, as well as tracking 
clients referred for specialized services to ensure they receive 
follow-up care. Upon written consent of the client, tracking is 
accomplished through direct phone calls or through emails by the 
health promotores to determine the status of the referral.
MeThODs anD DaTa
The data presented correspond to clients accessing services at the 
50 VDS during 2013. Each client completed a standardized form 
upon accessing services at one of the 50 VDS. The standardized 
form included a series of questions on demographics, history of 
access to medical services, personal medical history, anthropo-
metric measurements, services rendered, referrals made, screen-
ing tests, and results. This information was collected by health 
promotores at each of the 50 VDS. Health promotores receive 
training on data collection. The database was maintained in a 
secure file and was subsequently reported on a quarterly basis to 
the Ministry of Health of Mexico. Data obtained by the coauthors 
were de-identified. The aggregate data were analyzed using SPSS 
version 19 software to provide the descriptive analysis for this 
article. The project was submitted for approval by the ethics com-
mittee established by of the Mexico Section of the US-Mexico 
Border Health Commission.
resUlTs
The number of clients accessing services from the 50 VDS 
between January and December 2013 totaled 1,182,760, of which 
225,058 (19%) were provided by the mobile VDS. A snapshot of 
VDS participants shows the greatest number of users is within the 
reproductive age, with 34% between ages of 36 and 45 followed 
by 26- and 35-year olds with 29%. In addition, 63% of VDS users 
are women while 37% are men. While the VDS program does 
not inquire about immigration status, demographics on country

of origin show users to be predominantly from Mexico and 
Latin America followed by Caribbean countries and territories. 
Languages reported include Spanish, English, and indigenous 
languages to Mexico and Latin America.
These same clients received 2,718,617 services; an average of 
2.3 services per client. Services included educational information, 
service referrals to community health-care centers, screenings, 
and immunizations. In each of the VDS, on average 23.7 clients 
were serviced, ranging from 1,453 client visits made to the VDS 
in Anchorage, AK, USA compared to 13,423 visits made in Los 
Angeles, CA, USA. Of the total services offered, 57.4% involved 
information and referral. Educational health topic orientations 
by trained CHWs included diabetes, obesity, women’s health, 
hypertension, mental health, substance abuse, family violence, 
birth control, and health insurance (both the Affordable Care Act 
marketplace for eligible individuals and Mexico’s Seguro Popular 
program). Another 20.3% received screening for diabetes, hyper-
tension, cholesterol, and HIV/AIDS (Figure 1).
A total of 116,468 blood glucose screenings were performed. 
Of these, 32% (31.9%) had high glucose levels. Of the 50,272 
consumers measured for body mass index, half were found to be 
overweight or obese. Blood pressure screens totaled 14,997, of 
which 32.6% had a systolic blood pressure greater than 130 mmHg. 
Approximately 16,369 HIV blood screens were performed, and 
1.6% found to be positive. The prevalence of sexually transmitted 
infections of those receiving testing equaled 3.7% (Table 1).
In addition, 63,755 clients of the VDS received orientations; 
39.4% were referred for secondary and tertiary care for substance 
use. Of those receiving mental health counseling, 2.6% (56,368) 
were referred for additional services. A total of 318,319 clients 
were referred to community clinics for health-care services, and 
another 86,273 received information about available programs.
The VDS clients received health insurance program informa-
tion. A total of 8,951 clients were enrolled in the U.S. health 
insurance marketplace. Health insurance enrollment is a service 
provided by some of the VDS; especially given the challenges of 
enrolling the Mexican population in the U.S. (Figure 1).
DiscUssiOn
The VDS program (27) serves as a resource providing Mexican 
immigrants in the U.S. information, referral, and health educa-
tion on promoting healthy lifestyles while living abroad. The mis-
sion of the VDS is reassuring the safety and health of immigrants 
and families where they work and live across the U.S.; thereby, 
realizing their full potential physically, mentally, and socially. 
The VDS program is an effort by the Mexican Government in 
collaboration with local U.S. Health Institutions, agencies, and 
non-governmental health organizations to address barriers and 
reduce disparities with the Mexican immigrants in accessing 
health care and meeting their medical needs.
Through this program, a significant number of services have 
been granted, which have enabled not only to guide and inform 
the community about the different conditions that affect the 
Latino population living in the U.S. but also to detect the presence 
of high levels of blood glucose, overweight, and obesity, HIV/
AIDS, among other conditions. Referrals for follow-up and spe-
cialized care to community clinics is another important objective

of this program as, through timely detection and referral to health 
services, the VDS program helps reduce emergency room visits 
and establish a medical home.
The impact of the VDS program is largely due to the support 
of partnerships with more than 500 agencies, both public and 
private, that impact and help improve the health of Mexicans 
who reside in the U.S. These partnerships have become a com-
prehensive preventive health-care safety-net model for Mexican 
communities abroad, making the VDS the main disseminator of 
programs for prevention and health promotion among Mexicans 
in the U.S., with the purpose of guaranteeing their constitutional 
right to health, regardless of the territory where they live. The 
VDS model has also been adopted by other Latin and Central 
American countries exploring ways to support the needs of their 
population living and working abroad.
Currently, the VDS program faces an important challenge 
to achieve long-term sustainability for its expanding programs, 
and this will depend, to a large extent, on the support and con-
tinued partnerships of health institutions in the U.S. To achieve 
this, it is essential to establish and strengthen alliances with 
key institutions, such as national institutes of health, Mexican 
migrant associations, local city and state governments, aca-
demic institutions and civil society organizations, among many 
others.
The VDS program continues to grow and expand its reach 
by creating new venues to resolve current health problems and 
maintain flexibility and adapt to local trends and health-care 
needs.
