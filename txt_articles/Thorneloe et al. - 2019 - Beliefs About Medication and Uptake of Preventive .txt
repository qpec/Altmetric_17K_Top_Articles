Abstract
Preventive therapies, such as tamoxifen, are a risk reduction option for women at increased risk of breast
cancer. Little is known about the psychological factors influencing the decision to use chemoprevention. Using
latent profile analysis, women who reported a low need for preventive therapy and strong medication concerns
were less likely to initiate tamoxifen treatment. Medication beliefs are targets for supporting informed decision-
making.
Introduction: Uptake of preventive therapies for breast cancer is low. We examined whether women at increased risk
of breast cancer can be categorized into groups with similar medication beliefs, and whether belief group membership
was prospectively associated with uptake of preventive therapy. Patients and Methods: Women (n ¼ 732) attending
an appointment to discuss breast cancer risk were approached; 408 (55.7%) completed the Beliefs About Medicines
and the Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines questionnaires. Uptake of tamoxifen at 3 months was reported in 258
(63.2%). The optimal number of belief groups were identified using latent profile analysis. Results: Uptake of
tamoxifen was 14.7% (38/258). One in 5 women (19.4%; 78/402) reported a strong need for tamoxifen. The model fit
statistics supported a 2-group model. Both groups held weak beliefs about their need for tamoxifen for current and
future health. Group 2 (38%; 154/406 of the sample) reported stronger concerns about tamoxifen and medicines in
general, and stronger perceived sensitivity to the negative effects of medicines compared with group 1 (62%; 252/
406). Women with low necessity and lower concerns (group 1) were more likely to initiate tamoxifen (18.3%; 33/180)
than those with low necessity and higher concerns (group 2) (6.4%; 5/78). After adjusting for demographic and clinical
factors, the odds ratio was 3.37 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-10.51; P ¼ .036). Conclusion: Uptake of breast cancer
preventive therapy was low. A subgroup of women reported low need for preventive therapy and strong medication
concerns. These women were less likely to initiate tamoxifen. Medication beliefs are targets for supporting informed
decision-making.

 Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide.1
Preventive therapy is a risk reduction approach for women at
increased risk of breast cancer. In a meta-analysis of 9 randomized
trials, women at increased risk of breast cancer had at least a 30%
lower risk of the disease if they used selective estrogen receptor
modulators.2 The IBIS-I (International Breast Cancer Intervention
Study) indicated the preventive effect of tamoxifen lasts for at least
20 years.3 The effectiveness of preventive therapy depends on
adequate uptake but initiation rates remain low.4-7
Individual’s beliefs about medication are modifiable drivers of
treatment decision-making.8 These beliefs include perceptions of
personal need for medication (necessity beliefs) and concerns about its
usage (concern beliefs), as well as more general concerns relating to the
nature of medications and how they are used by doctors. The Beliefs
About Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) is the tool most commonly
used to assess and quantify medication beliefs.8,9 Women’s concerns
about side effects are a barrier to initiating preventive therapy.5,10
However, there can be heterogeneity in individual’s beliefs.11
Understanding subgroup differences in medication beliefs can sup-
port the development of personalized interventions.
The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess whether women at
increased risk of breast cancer can be categorized into groups with
similar medication beliefs; (2) determine whether sociodemographic
and clinical variables are related to medication belief group mem-
bership and; (3) examine whether medication belief groups are
associated with tamoxifen uptake.
Patients and Methods
Patients
Women were approached after their appointment at 1 of the
following clinic types; family history clinic (n ¼ 12), breast clinic
(n ¼ 4), clinical genetic centers (n ¼ 3), and a family history clinic
with genetics support (n ¼ 1). In the United Kingdom, women are
referred to secondary care if their general practitioner (family doc-
tor) believes they are likely to meet National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria for breast cancer risk.12
Recruitment took place at 20 clinics in England between
September 2015 and December 2016. Eligibility criteria included:
women aged 18 years or older; English-speaking; had discussed
preventive therapy with a health care professional; were classified as
having a moderately high or high risk of breast cancer according to
NICE guidelines12; and had no known contraindications for
tamoxifen use. Women were excluded if they were unable to
consent, read English, or had a previous diagnosis of breast cancer.
Materials
Women were invited to complete a baseline survey containing
the following measures: the BMQ9 is used to assess perceptions
about personal need for tamoxifen (3 items, specific necessity);
concerns about negative effects from tamoxifen (6 items, specific
concerns); beliefs relating to the nature of medication (4 items,
general harmfulness); and beliefs about how they are used by doc-
tors (4 items, general overuse). The BMQ was adapted for use in
chemoprevention decision-making. Each item is scored on a 5-point
scale (“strongly disagree: [¼ 1] to “strongly agree” [¼ 5]), with
higher scores indicating stronger medication beliefs. A mean score
was calculated for each subscale, with scores ranging from 1 to 5.
The proportion of women who agreed (¼ 4) or strongly agreed
(¼ 5) with each item within the subscales were also examined.
The Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines (PSM) scale13 is used to
assesses perceived sensitivity to potential adverse effects of medicines
(5 items). Each item is scored on a 5-point scale (“strongly disagree”
[¼1] to “strongly agree” [¼ 5]), with higher scores indicating higher
perceived sensitivity to the negative effects of medicines. A mean
score was calculated, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. The pro-
portion of women who agreed (¼ 4) or strongly agreed (¼ 5) with
each individual scale item was examined.
The baseline survey obtained the following data: marital status;
ethnicity; education level; employment status; nulliparity; and
self-reported health. Age was calculated from date of birth provided
from National Health Service records; women were coded as �35
years; 36 to 49 years and; �50 years for analysis. Index of Multiple
Deprivation scores were calculated from participant postcodes, and
women were classified into tertiles of neighborhood deprivation.14
Breast cancer risk category (moderately high or high) as outlined
in the NICE guidelines, was provided by clinic staff (with partici-
pant consent).12 Uptake of tamoxifen was assessed in the 3-month
follow-up questionnaire. Women were classified as initiating
tamoxifen if they reported having a prescription for tamoxifen from
their general practitioner or were currently taking tamoxifen. This is
because some women might not have had the opportunity to collect
their prescription and start treatment at the time of the 3-month
follow-up period.
Analysis
The analysis was preregistered.15 The association between the
BMQ subscales and the PSM scale were analyzed using Pearson
correlation coefficients. Differences in medication beliefs between
those who completed the baseline survey and women who returned
a baseline and follow-up survey were analyzed using t tests. Theory-
driven latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to investigate whether
women could be categorized into medication belief groups. LPA is
used to categorize individuals with similar profiles on a set of
continuous variables (BMQ and PSM scales) into discrete groups
represented by a categorical latent variable (medication belief
groups). Participants’ mean scores for the BMQ subscales and the
PSM scale were included in the LPA analysis. Two participants had
missing data for all 5 variables and were excluded from analysis
(n ¼ 406 included in baseline analysis). Model fit statistics for LPA
models with 1 through 5 class solutions were examined. These were
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Infor-
mation Criterion (BIC), where smaller values indicate a better fit.
The VuongeLoeMendelleRubin likelihood ratio test and the
LoeMendelleRubin adjusted likelihood ratio test were used to
compare the current model with a model with 1 less latent class.
Entropy provides a measure of the classification quality of the
model, with values approaching 1 indicating a good separation of
classes.
Two planned sensitivity analyses were performed. The LPA
model was run with and without the PSM scale. The LPA model
was also run on individuals who provided baseline and 3-month
follow-up data on tamoxifen uptake (n ¼ 258) to ensure that the
reduction in sample size would not bias the results.

 A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine
the association between participant characteristics and medication
belief group membership. Multivariable logistic regression was also
used to examine the role of medication belief group membership
on uptake. The analysis was done using Mplus 716 and SPSS
version 24.0 (IBM Corp). Statistical significance was set at a
2-sided P < .05.

Results
In total, 732 women were invited to complete a survey; 408
women (55.7%) returned the baseline survey (Table 1) and 258
(63.2%) women provided uptake data at least 3 months after their
appointment (see Supplemental Figure 1 in the online version).
Demographic and clinical differences between responders and
nonresponders and between those who did and did not provide
3-month data are published elsewhere.6 There were no differences
between responders and nonresponders with regard to clinical risk,
socioeconomic status (SES), or age group. Women were more likely
to provide follow-up data if they were from a higher SES group.
There were no differences in medication beliefs between women
who provided baseline data and those who provided baseline and
3-month data (see Supplemental Table 1 in the online version).
Beliefs About Medication and Perceived Sensitivity to its
Effects
Women reported low perceived need for tamoxifen; 19.4% (78/
402) believed their current health depends on them taking tamox-
ifen and 18.2% (73/401) believed they would become very ill
without it (Table 2). Concerns about tamoxifen were common;
72.4% (291/402) worried about its long-term effects and 56.9%
(230/404) believed tamoxifen use would result in unpleasant side
effects. A significant proportion of women reported poor under-
standing about tamoxifen; 22.6% (91/402) believed tamoxifen was
a “mystery” to them. Perceptions of perceived need for tamoxifen
were unrelated to concerns about its usage (see Supplemental
Table 2 in the online version).
A significant proportion of women reported concerns about the
nature of medicines and how they are used by doctors. This
included the belief that doctors use too many medicines (28.9%;
117/405) and would prescribe fewer medicines if they had more
time with patients (35.3%; 143/405). Some women also reported
heightened sensitivity to the effects of medication; 22.8% (92/404)
reported that they were particularly sensitive to medicines and they
have had reactions to medicines in the past, with 10.7% (43/403)
believing that even very small amounts of medication can upset their
body.
Medication Belief Groups
Model fit statistics for 1 through 5 class solutions are presented in
Supplemental Table 3 in the online version. Although the AIC,
BIC, and entropy values supported a 3-class solution, the log ratio
(LR) tests were nonsignificant, suggesting that extraction of 3 classes
did not improve model fit above a 2-class solution. Furthermore, the

 second class was a small group (n ¼ 14). A 2-class solution was
selected; both LR tests were significant with good sample sizes
within each latent class. Excluding the PSM scale did not improve
model fit (see Supplemental Table 4 in the online version).
Rerunning the analysis using only participants who had completed
baseline and had 3-month uptake data indicated a 2-class solution
with similar medication belief profiles (see Supplemental Table 5 in
the online version).
Sample means (95% confidence interval [CI]) of medication
beliefs for the 2-class solution are presented in Figure 1. Both
medication belief groups perceived a low need for tamoxifen (sub-
scale: specific necessity), but differed in their medication concerns
and perceived sensitivity to medicines. Women classified into group
2 (38%; 154) reported the strongest concerns about tamoxifen and
medicines in general, as well as stronger perceived sensitivity to the
effects of medicines, compared with women classified into group 1
(62%; 252). The largest difference between the groups was for
concerns about the overuse and harmfulness of medicines in general
(Table 2). A higher proportion of women classified into group 2
(low necessity and higher concerns) believed that doctors use too
many (59.1% [91/154] vs. 10.4% [26/251]) and place too much
trust in medicines (34.4% [53/154] vs. 2.0% [5/251]), and would
prescribe fewer medicines if they had more time with patients (66%
[101/153] vs. 16.7% [42/252]). A higher proportion of women in

 group 2 also believed that medicines are poisons (13.6% [21/154]
vs. 1.2% [3/252]), addictive (29.9% [46/154] vs. 3.2% [8/252]),
and people who take medicines should stop for a while every now

Factors Related to Medication Belief Group Membership
Women classified into group 2 (low need, higher concerns) were
more likely to be: aged 50 years or older (vs. 36-49 years), from
nonwhite ethnic groups (vs. white ethnic group), not working
full-time (vs. full-time employment), and unmarried (vs. married or
cohabiting; see Supplemental Table 6 in the online version). Only
age (50 years or older vs. 36-49 years) remained significantly

in

Predictors of Tamoxifen Uptake
Uptake of chemoprevention was 14.7% (38/258); 31 women
were currently taking tamoxifen and 7 women reported having a
prescription. Uptake according to clinic setting is presented in
Supplemental Table 7 in the online version. Women classified into
group 1 (low necessity, lower concerns) were more likely to initiate
tamoxifen (18.3%; 33/180) than those classified into group 2 (low
necessity, higher concerns) (6.4%; 5/78). After adjusting for de-
mographic and clinical factors, the OR was 3.37 (95% CI, 1.08-
10.51; P ¼ .036; Table 3).
Discussion
In this United Kingdom multicenter study, only 1 in 5 women at
increased risk of breast cancer reported a strong need for tamoxifen
preventive therapy. More than 70% of women reported strong
worries about its long-term effects and more than half reported
concerns about potential unpleasant side effects. A subgroup of
women, accounting for almost two-fifths of the sample, reported the
strongest medication concerns and perceived sensitivity to medi-
cines. Women with low necessity and lower concerns were more
likely to initiate tamoxifen than those with low necessity and higher
concerns.
It is important to determine whether preventive therapies can
create or exacerbate existing inequalities in breast cancer out-
comes.17 We have previously shown within this cohort that there
are no sociodemographic differences in tamoxifen uptake.6 In this
study, medication belief group membership was associated with
key indicators of SES, which might help identify those who would
most benefit from additional decision-making support.
Medication beliefs are key modifiable determinants of treatment
decision-making.8 Beliefs about breast cancer risk and its treatment
are complex and influenced by family experiences of cancer and
medication use.6 We have illustrated the specific medication beliefs
held by individuals at increased risk, with the identification of
subgroup differences having implications for supporting informed
decision-making. Perceived need for tamoxifen was low, suggesting
intervention strategies should focus on communicating the role
tamoxifen could play in cancer prevention, while balancing this with
information about harms and respecting women’s decision to
decline. Although women who reported low need and lower con-
cerns (group 1) were more likely to initiate tamoxifen, uptake was
still low in this group. For those who initiate tamoxifen, continued
uncertainty about personal need might result in lower adherence,
which has been shown to be problematic in clinical trials.18-20
An important subgroup of women reported low need for
tamoxifen and stronger medication concerns, and these beliefs

 influenced uptake decisions. This group might benefit from
additional support that focuses on eliciting and addressing unre-
solved medication concerns.21 Treatment expectations have been
shown to increase the risk of treatment-specific side effects and
nonadherence in the context of secondary breast cancer preven-
tion.22 Our study shows how previous treatment expectations can
influence primary prevention decision-making and emphasizes the
need for clinicians to address concerns and ensure realistic treat-
ment expectations.
Strengths and Limitations
The participation of more than 400 women from 20 centers
across England reflects the experiences of treatment decision-
making in clinical practice. The sample size was reduced for data
on tamoxifen uptake, but sensitivity analyses did not indicate bias.
Although the low level of uptake is comparable with other studies,4
it might have reduced statistical power. All women were given 3
months to decide whether they would like to initiate tamoxifen,

 however, some women might not have made their decision at the
time of follow-up. These data are self-reported, and therefore uptake
estimates might be biased. A number of sociodemographic, clinical,
and psychological factors have been reported to be associated with
uptake.4 We did not explore the quality of clinicianepatient
communication, which might influence women’s knowledge,
understanding, and beliefs about tamoxifen. However, our findings
point to potentially modifiable targets to help women make an
informed choice regarding preventive therapy.
Conclusion
In this multicenter study, the decision to initiate tamoxifen was
predicted by women’s beliefs about tamoxifen and medicines in
general, as well as perceived sensitivity to its negative effects. Elic-
iting and addressing women’s beliefs might help support informed
decision-making.
Clinical Practice Points
� The effectiveness of preventive therapy for breast cancer depends
on adequate uptake, but initiation rates remain low. Across many
disease contexts, individuals’ beliefs about medication have been
shown to influence treatment decision-making. Little is known
about the psychological factors influencing the decision to use
chemoprevention.
� Our multicenter prospective study showed that uptake of breast
cancer preventive therapy was low. Using LPA, we identified an
important subgroup of women who reported low need for pre-
ventive therapy and strong medication concerns. These women
were less likely to initiate tamoxifen.
� This study identified why some women might decide to opt out
of taking tamoxifen as a preventive measure. Identifying and
addressing medication beliefs might help support informed
decision-making.
