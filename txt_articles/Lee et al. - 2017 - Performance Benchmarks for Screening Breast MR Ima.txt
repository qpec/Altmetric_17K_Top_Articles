Purpose:
To compare screening magnetic resonance (MR) imag-
ing performance in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Con-
sortium (BCSC) with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data 
System (BI-RADS) benchmarks.
Materials and 
Methods:
This study was approved by the institutional review board 
and compliant with HIPAA and included BCSC screening 
MR examinations collected between 2005 and 2013 from 
5343 women (8387 MR examinations) linked to regional 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program 
registries, state tumor registries, and pathologic infor-
mation databases that identified breast cancer cases and 
tumor characteristics. Clinical, demographic, and imag-
ing characteristics were assessed. Performance measures 
were calculated according to BI-RADS fifth edition and 
included cancer detection rate (CDR), positive predictive 
value of biopsy recommendation (PPV2), sensitivity, and 
specificity.
Results:
The median patient age was 52 years; 52% of MR ex-
aminations were performed in women with a first-degree 
family history of breast cancer, 46% in women with a 
personal history of breast cancer, and 15% in women 
with both risk factors. Screening MR imaging depicted 
146 cancers, and 35 interval cancers were identified (181 
total—54 in situ, 125 invasive, and two status unknown). 
The CDR was 17 per 1000 screening examinations (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 15, 20 per 1000 screening exam-
inations; BI-RADS benchmark, 20–30 per 1000 screen-
ing examinations). PPV2 was 19% (95% CI: 16%, 22%; 
benchmark, 15%). Sensitivity was 81% (95% CI: 75%, 
86%; benchmark, .80%), and specificity was 83% (95% 
CI: 82%, 84%; benchmark, 85%–90%). The median tu-
mor size of invasive cancers was 10 mm; 88% were node 
negative.
Conclusion:
The interpretative performance of screening MR imag-
ing in the BCSC meets most BI-RADS benchmarks and 
approaches benchmark levels for remaining measures. 
Clinical practice performance data can inform ongoing 
benchmark development and help identify areas for qual-
ity improvement.

breast imaging data linked to cancer 
outcomes. In contrast, screening MR 
imaging performance benchmarks are 
based on data from high-risk screening 
MR imaging trials, largely from aca-
demic medical centers, and have yet to 
include performance from community 
practice settings outside of clinical tri-
als. The purpose of our study was to 
compare screening MR imaging per-
formance in the BCSC with current BI-
RADS performance benchmarks.
Materials and Methods
Data Sources
Six regional BCSC registries provided 
screening MR imaging data from 49 fa-
cilities in the following areas: Chicago, 
Western Washington (Kaiser Perma-
nente), New Hampshire, North Caro-
lina, the San Francisco Bay Area, and 
Vermont. Among BCSC facilities con-
tributing data to this study, 12% were 
academic (six of 49 facilities) and con-
tributed 33% of the MR examinations 
(2795 of 8387 examinations) included 
for analysis. Breast cancer diagnoses 
breast cancers in asymptomatic women 
after treatment of primary breast can-
cer (“surveillance”) has also increased, 
with reports from single-institution 
observational studies indicating incre-
mental cancer detection beyond that of 
mammography alone (7–11). Currently, 
most breast MR examinations are being 
performed for screening and surveil-
lance indications (5,6).
The American College of Radiolo-
gy’s Breast Imaging Reporting and Data 
System (BI-RADS) (12) provides a stan-
dardized lexicon to describe findings, 
assessments, and recommendations for 
mammography, ultrasonography (US), 
and MR examinations. It also provides 
guidance for conducting a medical 
outcomes audit of interpretive perfor-
mance for quality assurance purposes, 
as well as performance benchmarks for 
screening and diagnostic mammogra-
phy. The current (fifth) edition, pub-
lished in 2013, added screening MR 
imaging performance benchmarks (13).
The BI-RADS performance bench-
marks for screening and diagnostic 
mammography are based on data from 
the Breast Cancer Surveillance Con-
sortium (BCSC) (14), a network of 
breast imaging registries throughout the 
United States that collect longitudinal

Advances in Knowledge
 
n In a study of screening MR exam-
inations collected between 2005 
and 2013 from 5343 women 
(8387 MR examinations), the 
cancer detection rate was 17 per 
1000 screening examinations 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 
15, 20 per 1000 screening exami-
nations; Breast Imaging Report-
ing and Data System [BI-RADS] 
benchmark, 20–30 per 1000 
screening examinations).
 
n The positive predictive value for 
biopsy recommendation was 19% 
(95% CI: 16%, 22%; BI-RADS 
benchmark, 15%).
 
n Sensitivity was 81% (95% CI: 
75%, 86%; benchmark, .80%) 
and specificity was 83% (95% CI: 
82%, 84%; BI-RADS benchmark, 
85%–90%).
 
n Our results provide clinical prac-
tice–based values for measures 
currently noted as “To Be Deter-
mined” in the BI-RADS manual: 
percentage of stage 0 or 1 breast 
cancers (87%) and median  
size of invasive breast cancers 
(10 mm).
Implications for Patient Care
 
n The interpretive performance of 
screening breast MR imaging in 
clinical practices of the Breast 
Cancer Surveillance Consortium 
meets or approaches current BI-
RADS benchmarks based on 
expert practice in clinical trials.
 
n Positive predictive values and MR 
imaging specificity (which 
approached but did not meet the 
benchmark of 85%–90%) sug-
gest that a continued focus on 
reducing false-positive results 
while maintaining sensitivity and 
cancer detection remains impor-
tant in ongoing quality improve-
ment efforts.
 
n Clinical practice performance 
data can inform and supplement 
ongoing benchmark 
development.
I
nternational clinical trials of women 
at increased hereditary risk of de-
veloping breast cancer have shown 
that breast magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging can allow detection of breast 
cancers that are not visible with mam-
mography and are small and at an early 
stage (1). These screening MR imaging 
trials formed the evidence base for rec-
ommendations to use MR imaging as an 
adjunct to mammography for screening 
women at high risk of developing breast 
cancer, with a lifetime risk of 20% or 
higher as assessed with hereditary risk 
models per the American Cancer So-
ciety (2), the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (3), and the American 
College of Radiology (4).
Since the publication of these guide-
lines, the use of screening MR imaging 
in clinical practice has increased na-
tionally (5,6). The use of breast MR im-
aging for the early detection of second

screening results were defined as those 
classified as BI-RADS category 0, 3, 4, 
or 5; negative results were defined as 
those classified as BI-RADS category 1 
or 2. If each breast was given an assess-
ment, we applied a hierarchical ranking 
of assessment categories to determine 
the overall assessment for the examina-
tion, as follows: 5 . 4 . 0 . 3 . 2 . 1.
True-positive findings (screening-de-
tected cancers) were defined as breast 
cancer diagnosis within 12 months of 
a positive screening MR examination. 
False-positive findings were defined as 
positive screening MR imaging results 
and no breast cancer diagnosis within 
12 months. True-negative findings were 
defined as no breast cancer within 12 
months of a negative screening MR ex-
amination. False-negative findings (in-
terval breast cancers) were defined as 
diagnosis within 12 months of a nega-
tive screening MR imaging examination. 
The mode of interval cancer detection 
(screening mammography, diagnostic 
mammography or US, or other) and 
the time between negative MR imag-
ing results and cancer diagnosis were 
recorded.
The following performance metrics 
were calculated according to the BI-
RADS manual, fifth edition: cancer de-
tection rate (CDR); positive predictive 
value (PPV) of positive screening result 
 
(PPV1), PPV of biopsy recommenda-
tion (PPV2), PPV of biopsies performed 
(PPV3), sensitivity, and specificity. The 
CDR was calculated as the number of 
true-positive cancers per 1000 exami-
nations. The current (fifth) edition of 
BI-RADS no longer recommends calcu-
lation of PPV after positive screening 
MR imaging (PPV1). However, because 
data 
were 
collected 
while 
the 
fourth 
edi-
tion of BI-RADS (15) was used in clin-
ical practice and PPV1 calculation was 
recommended, we calculated PPV1 as 
the percentage of category 0, 3, 4, and 
5 assessments with a tissue diagnosis 
of cancer within the follow-up period. 
PPV2 was calculated as the percentage 
of category 4 and 5 assessments with 
a tissue diagnosis of cancer within the 
follow-up period. PPV3 was calculated 
 
as the percentage of biopsies per-
formed with a tissue diagnosis of 
had been performed within 9 months 
(n = 220). MR examinations were 
also excluded if a BI-RADS category 6 
(known malignancy, n = 35) had been 
assigned, if the BI-RADS assessment 
was missing (n = 225), or if less than 12 
months of complete capture of cancer 
data were available (n = 3523). Because 
capture of data on breast cancer recur-
rence varies across Surveillance, Epi-
demiology, and End Results program 
and state tumor registries, we excluded 
MR examinations (n = 81) from women 
with a personal history of breast cancer 
from facilities with biopsy and path-
ologic data capture rates of less than 
65% after BI-RADS category 4 or 5 
assessments.
Demographic, clinical, and imag-
ing characteristics examined included 
age, race and/or ethnicity, first-degree 
family history or personal history of 
breast cancer, previous breast biopsy, 
mammography within the previous 12 
months, and BI-RADS breast density. A 
first-degree family history of breast can-
cer was defined as breast cancer in a 
mother, sister, or daughter. A personal 
history of breast cancer was defined 
as previous breast cancer, either self-
reported or documented in a pathologic 
information database, a state tumor 
registry, or the Surveillance, Epidemiol-
ogy, and End Results program registry. 
Previous mammographic examination 
was defined on the basis of the most 
recent date from either self-report or 
the BCSC database. Breast density was 
classified according to the BI-RADS 
manual (13) and was obtained from the 
most recent mammogram in the BCSC 
database.
Measures, Definitions, and Statistical 
Analysis
The MR examination was the unit of 
analysis, as recommended in the BI-
RADS manual, to derive performance 
and outcomes to be used as clinically 
relevant benchmarks. The BI-RADS 
assessment categories are defined as 
follows (13): 0 (incomplete, need addi-
tional imaging evaluation), 1 (negative), 
2 (benign), 3 (probably benign), 4 (sus-
picious for malignancy), and 5 (highly 
suggestive of malignancy). Positive 
and tumor characteristics were ob-
tained by linkage of BCSC data to pa-
thology databases and regional Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
Program or state tumor registries. Data 
were pooled at a central statistical co-
ordinating center.
Registries and the statistical coor-
dinating center received institutional 
review board approval for data collec-
tion and analysis. All procedures were 
compliant with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act, and 
registries and the statistical coordinat-
ing center received a federal Certificate 
of Confidentiality for the identities of 
women, physicians, and facilities. Pre-
vious reports of BCSC registries and 
the statistical coordinating center are 
available at http://www.bcsc-research.
org/publications/index/html.
Study Population
The cohort included women with and 
women without a personal history of 
breast cancer, because the BI-RADS 
manual recommends that breast MR 
examinations performed in asymptom-
atic women with a personal history of 
breast cancer be audited as screening 
examinations. We identified 13 
312 MR 
examinations performed in women 
aged 18 years and older from 2005 to 
2013 that were coded with an indica-
tion of screening. There were 6034 
women with and 7278 women without 
a personal history of breast cancer. For 
women in the BCSC database who had 
undergone more than one screening 
MR examination, we included all avail-
able examinations for analysis.
Screening MR examinations in 
women with a personal history of 
breast cancer were excluded if MR im-
aging was performed within 6 months 
after cancer diagnosis (n = 405), if the 
examination was associated with pre-
vious bilateral mastectomy (n = 143), 
or if a previous MR examination had 
been performed within 60 days (n = 
34). Screening MR examinations in 
women without a personal history of 
breast cancer were excluded if the ex-
amination was not bilateral (n = 125), if 
previous mastectomy was reported (n = 
134), or if a previous MR examination

5) per 1000 examinations. All other 
performance measures were based on 
the initial assessment from screening 
MR imaging.
The following cancer outcomes 
were determined overall and stratified 
according to screening detection and 
interval presentation, as follows: per-
centage of minimal cancer (defined as 
ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or inva-
sive carcinoma 10 mm) (13), percent-
age of node-negative invasive cancers, 
percentage of stage 0 and 1 cancers, 
and median size of invasive cancer. 
BCSC performance measures and out-
comes were compared with BI-RADS 
fifth edition benchmarks (13).
Descriptive 
mean 
performance 
measures and confidence intervals 
(CIs) were calculated on the basis of a 
binomial distribution by using a of .05. 
All statistical analyses were performed 
by using software (SAS, version 9.3; 
SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Data were collected from 13 
312 MR ex-
aminations with a screening indication. 
After application of exclusion criteria, 
the final sample was 8387 screening 
MR examinations performed in 5343 
women from 2005 to 2013. Of the 5343 
women, 3630 (68%) underwent one 
breast MR examination, 967 (18%) 
underwent 
two 
examinations, 
405 
(8%) underwent three examinations, 
and 341 (6%) underwent four or more 
examinations.
Table 1 summarizes the character-
istics of screening MR examinations. 
During the study period, screening MR 
imaging use increased steadily between 
2005 and 2010 and then remained stable 
through 2012. The median age of women 
undergoing screening MR imaging was 52 
years (range, 19–92 years). MR examina-
tions were performed in women primar-
ily between the ages of 40 and 59 years 
(5341 of 8387 examinations [64%]). 
Examination-level race and ethnicity 
associated with screening MR imaging 
showed that 85% of examinations were 
performed in non-Hispanic white women 
(6559 of 7718 examinations) and 12% in 
black, Asian, or Hispanic women (898 of 
cancer within the follow-up period, in-
cluding core-needle biopsy, fine-needle 
aspiration, and excisional biopsy. For 
auditing at the facility level as rec-
ommended in the BI-RADS manual 
(13), PPV2 and PPV3 typically have 
the same numerator, and the denom-
inator for PPV3 is that of PPV2 after 
subtraction of the cases with no re-
corded biopsy performed. When PPV3 
was calculated within the BCSC, the 
denominator included examinations 
with confirmed biopsies preceded by 
a final assignment of category 4 or 5 
at screening MR examination. Within 
this group, the subset of true-positive 
findings formed the numerator. Sensi-
tivity was calculated as the percentage 
of true-positive results among women 
with cancer within the follow-up pe-
riod. Specificity was calculated as the 
percentage of true-negative results 
among women without cancer within 
the follow-up period.
PPV2 and PPV3 calculations were 
based on final assessments after imag-
ing follow-up. BI-RADS category 0 as-
sessments (n = 306) were resolved to 
final assessments in the following or-
der: (a) We used the earliest BI-RADS 
category 1–5 assessment identified 
within a 90-day follow-up period (n 
= 188); (b) we imputed the BI-RADS 
assessment on the basis of the rec-
ommendation in the follow-up period 
(as BI-RADS category 2 if recommen-
dation was for routine screening, BI-
RADS category 3 if recommendation 
was for short-interval follow-up, and 
BI-RADS category 4 if recommenda-
tion was for biopsy [n = 6]); (c) we 
imputed the BI-RADS assessment as a 
category 4 assessment if a biopsy was 
performed in the follow-up period (n 
= 35); and (d) we assigned final as-
sessment on the basis of recommen-
dations from the original examination 
(n = 9) or (e) we left as unresolved 
BI-RADS category 0 and excluded 
these examinations from PPV2 and 
PPV3 calculations (n = 68). The false-
positive biopsy recommendation rate 
was defined as MR examinations with 
no known tissue diagnosis of cancer 
within 12 months after biopsy recom-
mendation (BI-RADS category 4 or

false-positive biopsy recommendation 
rate was 66 per 1000 examinations (548 
of 8319 examinations; 95% CI: 62, 71).
Breast Cancer Characteristics
Breast cancers diagnosed within 1 year 
of MR imaging screening tended to be 
small and at an early stage (Table 2). 
Minimal cancer accounted for 69% of 
breast cancers (110 of 160 cancers), and 
88% of invasive cancers were node neg-
ative (95 of 108 examinations). Among 
breast cancers, 87% (134 of 154 can-
cers) were stage 0 or 1; the median size 
of invasive cancers was 10 mm.
Cancer characteristics stratified 
according to mode of detection (ie, 
screening detected vs interval cancers) 
are shown in Table 3. Both screening-
detected and interval cancers had 
comparable, favorable prognostic char-
acteristics. DCIS represented a simi-
lar proportion of screening-detected 
cancers (44 of 145 cancers [30%]) 
and interval cancers (10 of 34 cancers 
4 or 5; n = 110) or negative (BI-RADS 
category 1, 2, or 3; n = 128). The re-
maining 68 examinations with unre-
solved assessments (0.8% of total ex-
aminations) were excluded from PPV2 
and PPV3 calculations. Biopsy was ulti-
mately recommended for lesions in 680 
examinations—8% of all MR imaging 
examinations and 44% of examinations 
with positive screening results (initial 
BI-RADS assessment 0, 3, 4, or 5).
Screening MR imaging performance 
in the BCSC and BI-RADS benchmarks 
are shown in Table 2. The CDR was 17 
per 1000 examinations (146 of 8387 ex-
aminations; 95% CI: 15, 20 per 1000). 
PPV1 was 9% (146 of 1552 examina-
tions; 95% CI: 8%, 11%), PPV2 was 19% 
(132 of 680 examinations; 95% CI: 16%, 
22), and PPV3 was 21% (115 of 558 ex-
aminations; 95% CI: 17%, 24%). Sensi-
tivity and specificity were 81% (146 of 
181 examinations; 95% CI: 75%, 86%) 
and 83% (6800 of 8206 examinations; 
95% CI: 82%, 84%), respectively. The 
7718 examinations). Forty-six percent of 
the MR examinations (3878 of 8387 ex-
aminations) were performed in women 
with a personal history of breast can-
cer and 52% were performed in women 
with a first-degree family history (4020 
of 7724 examinations). Both of these risk 
factors were reported in 15% of MR ex-
aminations (1134 of 7724 examinations). 
Most MR examinations (6324 of 8387 
examinations [75%]) were preceded by 
screening or diagnostic mammography 
within the previous 12 months. Breast 
density was classified as either heteroge-
neously dense or extremely dense in 67% 
of previous mammograms (4932 of 7408 
examinations).
Screening MR Imaging Performance
Of the 8387 screening MR examina-
tions, 6835 (81%) were negative and 
1552 (19%) were positive (Fig 1). Of 
306 BI-RADS category 0 assessments, 
238 (78%) were resolved to final as-
sessment of positive (BI-RADS category 
Figure 1
Figure 1: BI-RADS audit flowchart. CDR, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated on the basis of positive or nega-

[29%]). Invasive screening-detected 
and interval cancers had comparable 
proportions of cancers that were larger 
than 20 mm (12% and 18%, respec-
tively) or node positive (12% and 11%). 
Sensitivity according to histologic type 
was 82% (95% CI: 71%, 92%) for DCIS 
and 81% (95% CI: 74%, 88%) for inva-
sive cancers. Median time to diagnosis 
for interval breast cancers was 227 days 
(interquartile range, 45–305 days).
Figure 2 displays the frequency of 
screening mammography relative to 
screening MR examinations. Of the 8387 
MR imaging examinations, 4557 (54%) 
were performed in women who had un-
dergone screening mammography within 
the period of 60 days before MR imaging 
through 365 days after a screening MR 
imaging examination. Screening mam-
mography occurred most frequently 
within 60 days prior to a screening MR 
examination or on the same day (1811 
of 4557 examinations [40%]), followed 
by another frequency peak at around 6 
months after a screening MR examina-
tion (range, 151–210 days; 1081 of 4557 
examinations [24%]).
To examine whether the interval 
cancers after negative screening breast 
MR examinations might have been de-
tected in asymptomatic women choosing 
MR imaging and mammography screen-
ing that alternated every 6 months, we 
searched the BCSC database for any ad-
ditional imaging examinations performed 
within 60 days prior to interval cancer 
diagnosis. Eight of 35 interval cancers 
(23%) were identified with screening 
mammography and 12 (34%) were iden-
tified with diagnostic mammography, 
breast US, or both. Three of 35 interval 
cancers (9%) were identified by means 
of MR imaging; two of these examina-
tions were performed for screening 
within the 365-day follow-up period. For 
the remaining 12 interval cancers (34%), 
either imaging records did not specify 
modality or indication (n = 5) or no im-
aging was performed before diagnosis 
within the BCSC catchment area (n = 7).

Our findings summarize the current

invasive breast cancers were exceeded 
in this study. In addition, our results 
provide clinical practice–based values 
for measures currently noted as “To Be 
Determined” in the BI-RADS manual 
(13): percentage of stage 0 or 1 breast 
cancers (87%) and median size of in-
vasive breast cancers (10 mm). Previ-
ous analyses of BCSC data informed 
BI-RADS benchmark values for per-
formance and outcomes for screening 
and diagnostic mammography (16–19) 
in the third (20), fourth (15), and fifth 
(21) editions of the manual. The results 
of our study provide additional data to 
inform and guide continued revision 
of screening MR imaging performance 
benchmarks.
Further examination of breast can-
cer characteristics indicated that both 
screening-detected and interval cancers 
had favorable prognostic character-
istics. The proportion of cancers that 
were larger than 20 mm or node pos-
itive was comparable across the two 
groups. This suggests that screening 
MR imaging is effective in detecting 
most breast cancers within the detect-
able preclinical phase (22,23). It may 
be that both screening-detected and

time (in 30-day increments) between screening MR examination and associated screening mammography is shown. Of

screening MR imaging in clinical prac-
tice within the BCSC and place these 
results in the context of clinical bench-
marks recommended by the American 
College of Radiology. Overall, screening 
MR imaging in the BCSC met BI-RADS 
benchmarks for most performance 
measures and approached benchmark 
levels for the remaining measures.
The CDR of screening MR imaging 
approached the performance bench-
mark, consistent with the application 
of screening MR imaging in women at 
increased risk of developing breast can-
cer. Compared with women receiving 
screening digital mammography in the 
BCSC (16), women receiving screening 
MR imaging were younger, with 40% of 
screening MR imaging versus 29% of 
screening mammography examinations 
performed in women younger than 50 
years and in women who were more 
likely to have a family history of breast 
cancer (52% vs 17%, respectively) or a 
personal history of breast cancer (46% 
vs 5%). Accordingly, the observed CDR 
of screening MR imaging is higher than 
that of screening mammography (17.4 
vs 5.1 per 1000 screening procedures, 
respectively).
When the cancer yield of biopsy is 
examined, both PPV2 (PPV of biopsies 
recommended) and PPV3 (PPV of bi-
opsies performed) met the benchmark 
at the lower end of the benchmark 
range. The PPVs, along with MR imag-
ing specificity, which approached but 
did not meet the benchmark of 85%–
90%, suggest that a continued focus 
on reducing false-positive results while 
maintaining sensitivity and cancer de-
tection remains important for ongoing 
quality improvement efforts at popula-
tion, facility, and individual radiologist 
levels. We also calculated the false-pos-
itive biopsy recommendation rate (66 
per 1000 examinations). Although this 
is not a current American College of 
Radiology performance benchmark, its 
standardization per 1000 examinations 
enables more direct comparison of in-
formation along with CDR (17 per 1000 
examinations) to describe the benefits 
and potential harms of screening MR 
imaging.
In terms of characteristics, breast 
cancers diagnosed after screening MR 
imaging are small and at an early stage.

our results are likely to reflect clinical 
radiology practice. Our results indicate 
that clinical practice performance can 
meet or approach benchmarks based 
on expert practice in clinical trials. 
In addition, our results provide addi-
tional data that could be used to define 
new benchmarks where a value of “To 
Be Determined” exists in the current 
(fifth) edition of the BI-RADS manual, 
to inform and guide continued revision 
of screening MR imaging performance 
benchmarks.
A limitation of this study is the lack 
of inclusion of genetic mutation data, 
which would improve characterization 
of the underlying risk distribution in 
women undergoing screening MR imag-
ing. In addition, 46% of screening MR 
examinations in this study were per-
formed in women with a personal history 
of breast cancer, for whom risk models 
for second breast cancer events are not 
currently available. We did not stratify 
the performance of screening MR im-
aging between women with and women 
without a personal history of breast can-
cer because the BI-RADS manual rec-
ommends that breast MR examinations 
in asymptomatic women with a personal 
history of breast cancer be audited as 
screening examinations. For women in 
the BCSC database who had undergone 
more than one screening examination, 
we included all available examinations in 
our analysis. Following the BI-RADS au-
dit guidelines, we report overall perfor-
mance, combining first and subsequent 
screening MR examinations, and did not 
separately analyze prevalence versus in-
cidence screening performance.
When determining breast cancer 
status in this study, we adhered to BI-
RADS auditing guidance that an exam-
ination be classified as “true-negative” 
when there is no known tissue diagno-
sis of breast cancer within 1 year of a 
negative examination. Linkage of MR 
examinations in this study to state and 
regional tumor registries enables broad 
capture of breast cancer status, even 
when diagnosis occurs at a different 
facility from the one that conducted 
the screening examination. However, 
it is possible for an MR examination 
to be misclassified as true-negative 
(MR imaging) contribute a higher propor-
tion of breast cancers classified as false-
negative to the calculation of sensitivity 
for the initial screening test, compared 
with regimens in which both screening 
tests are performed concurrently, with 
no additional screening tests performed 
during the follow-up period. As we move 
to implement risk-based screening and 
 
surveillance, revision of auditing methods 
to account for multimodality regimens in 
addition to single-modality assessments 
may be needed to improve accurate as-
sessment of screening programs and 
outcomes.
With regard to screening MR imag-
ing use at the population level, evalua-
tion of appropriate utilization includes 
examination of whether MR imaging 
utilization in women at low risk of 
breast cancer and lack of MR imaging 
use in women at high risk occurs. Use 
of advanced imaging techniques such 
as breast MR imaging has the poten-
tial to exacerbate existing disparities 
in access to breast cancer screening 
and diagnostic services. Previous BCSC 
analyses showed that, among women 
at high risk, those with lower educa-
tional attainment (high school gradu-
ate, General Educational Development 
certificate of high school equivalency, 
or lower) were 60% less likely to use 
screening MR imaging compared with 
women with at least a college degree 
(25). At the same time, among women 
at average risk, those with at least a 
college education were almost 2.5 times 
more likely to use screening MR imag-
ing. These results suggest that improved 
risk communication may improve ap-
propriate use of screening MR imaging, 
further increasing achievable CDRs into 
the range observed in clinical trials.
Strengths of this study include the 
large, diverse sample of breast imaging 
facilities in the BCSC linked to pathol-
ogy databases as well as state and re-
gional tumor registries to provide com-
prehensive capture of cancer outcomes 
for accurate assessment of performance 
and comparison with benchmarks. 
Data were collected from community 
and academic practices that serve a 
geographically and racially representa-
tive sample of the U.S. population, and 
interval cancers are being identified be-
fore the critical point of disease, beyond 
which treatment becomes less effective.
When we examined the mode of de-
tection for interval breast cancers, 23% 
(eight of 35 cancers) were detected by 
means of subsequent screening mam-
mography during the follow-up period. 
This proportion may be an underesti-
mate, because designation of a mammo-
graphic examination as diagnostic after 
breast conservation therapy, even if the 
patient is asymptomatic, is considered 
appropriate by the American College of 
Radiology (24). Although breast cancers 
detected with screening mammography 
were counted as a false-negative finding 
for screening MR imaging, the cancers 
were still identified when patients were 
asymptomatic and were detected with a 
multimodality regimen concordant with 
guidelines for screening women at high 
risk of developing breast cancer (2–4). 
Two additional interval cancers were 
identified by means of screening MR 
imaging in women who returned for 
screening before the end of the 365-day 
follow-up period (on days 362 and 365, 
respectively).
In this study, the observed sensitiv-
ity of screening MR imaging in commu-
nity practice met the benchmark value 
of 80%. Multimodality screening with 
both mammography and MR imaging is 
recommended for women at high risk 
of developing breast cancer, and many 
women choose screening regimens in 
which MR imaging and mammography 
are alternated at 6-month intervals. Al-
though concordant with clinical guide-
lines, multimodality screening with al-
ternating tests at intervals shorter than 
the standard follow-up period poses an 
auditing challenge. The single-modality 
auditing approach recommended by the 
American College of Radiology defines 
false-negative (interval) cancers as any 
that are identified during the follow-up 
period and includes both breast cancers 
that manifest clinically and those that 
are asymptomatic and detected with a 
second screening modality such as mam-
mography. Asymptomatic breast cancers 
detected with a second screening modal-
ity (mammography) during the follow-up 
period after an initial screening modality
