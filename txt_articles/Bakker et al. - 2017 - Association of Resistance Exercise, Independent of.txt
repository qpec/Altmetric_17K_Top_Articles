Abstract
Objective—To determine the association of resistance exercise, independent of and combined 
with aerobic exercise, with the risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Patients and Methods—This cohort includes adults (mean age, 46; SD, 9.5) who received 
comprehensive medical examinations at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas during January 1st, 
1987 and December, 31st, 2006. Exercise was assessed by self-reported frequency and minutes per 
week of resistance and aerobic exercise, and meeting the US Physical Activity Guidelines 
(resistance exercise ≥2 days/week; aerobic exercise ≥500 MET-minutes/week) at baseline. The 
incidence of MetS was based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment 
Panel III criteria. We used Cox regression to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals.

 Results—Among 7418 participants, 15% (n=1147) developed MetS during a median follow-up 
of 4 years (max 19, min 0.1). Meeting the resistance exercise guidelines was associated with a 
17% lower risk of MetS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; P=.009) after adjusting for potential 
confounders and aerobic exercise. Further, less than one hour of weekly resistance exercise was 
associated with 29% lower risk of developing MetS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56–0.89; P=.003), 
compared to no resistance exercise. However, larger amounts of resistance exercise did not provide 
further benefits. Individuals meeting both recommended resistance and aerobic exercise guidelines 
had a 25% lower risk of developing MetS (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63–0.89; P<.001), compared to 
meeting neither guidelines.
Conclusions—Participating in resistance exercise, even less than one hour per week, was 
associated with a lower risk of developing MetS, independent of aerobic exercise. Health 
professionals should recommend patients to perform resistance exercise along with aerobic 
exercise to reduce MetS.
One third of US adults have metabolic syndrome (MetS)1. Cardiometabolic disorders, such 
as glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension are 
its key components2, 3. Therefore, MetS is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes 
mellitus4, 5 and cardiovascular diseases (CVD)6, 7. Increasing physical activity (PA) is a 
cornerstone for preventing and treating MetS3, 8. Several intervention studies have shown the 
benefits of aerobic exercise for improving metabolic risk factors9, 10. Previous studies, 
mostly cross-sectional, have identified negative associations of muscular strength11–14 or 
resistance exercise15–17 with the prevalence of MetS. Furthermore, recent cohort studies 
have indicated that higher levels of resistance exercise were associated with lower risks of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus in men and women18–20, which suggests that increasing resistance 
exercise might be a potential target for preventing MetS. However, there is very little 
evidence from large epidemiological studies regarding the effects of resistance exercise on 
the development of MetS. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the association of 
resistance exercise, independent of/and combined with aerobic exercise, with the risk of 
developing MetS in relatively healthy middle-aged adults. We hypothesized that resistance 
exercise lowers the risk of developing MetS and the combination of resistance and aerobic 
exercise might be stronger associated with lower risk than either one independently.
METHODS
Study Population
The Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study is a cohort of men and women, who received 
extensive preventive medical examinations at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas during 
January 1st, 1987 and December 31st, 2006. Among 10 243 participants, we excluded 836 
individuals with a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer and 1989 individuals 
with MetS at baseline. Our final sample included 7418 individuals (19% women). The 
participants were predominantly non-Hispanic whites (>95%), well educated, and employed 
in, or retired from, professional or executive positions21. The Cooper Institute institutional 
review board annually approved the study, and written informed consents were obtained 
from participants before data collection at baseline and during follow-up examinations.

 Clinical examination
All participants performed comprehensive medical examinations at baseline, including body 
composition assessments, blood chemistry analyses, blood pressure measurements, 
electrocardiography, physical examination, and detailed medical history questionnaire. Body 
mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight and height squared (kg/m2). Waist 
circumference was measured with anthropometric tape at the umbilicus level. Blood 
chemistry analyses, measuring triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and 
fasting glucose, were obtained with automated bioassays after 12-hour fasting. Resting 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured by standard auscultatory methods after 
5 minutes of seated rest, and calculated as the average of at least two readings separated by 2 
minutes.
Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, personal history of physician-diagnosed 
CVD, cancer, and parental history of CVD, hypertension, and diabetes were assessed by a 
medical history questionnaire. Heavy alcohol drinking was defined as >14 and >7 alcoholic 
drinks per week for men and women, respectively22. The medical history questionnaire 
included a PA questionnaire containing self-reported leisure-time PA or recreational PA 
during the past 3 months. We classified aerobic exercise into four categories: “inactive (0 
MET-minutes/week)”, “insufficient (1–499 MET-minutes/week)”, “medium (500–999 MET-
minutes/ week)” and “high (≥1000 MET-minutes/week)” based on the 2008 US PA 
Guidelines23.
Assessment of resistance exercise
Self-reported resistance exercise was assessed in the medical history questionnaire. 
Participants were asked about the weekly frequency and average exercise duration (minutes) 
for each session of muscle-strengthening PA using either free weights or weight training 
machines over the past 3 months. We used frequency (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or ≥5 times/week) and 
total amount (0, 1–59, 60–119, 120–179 and ≥180 minutes/week) of resistance exercise, as 
well as meeting the 2008 PA Guidelines for resistance exercise (≥2 times/week23), as our 
main exposures. The total amount of resistance exercise was calculated by multiplying 
frequency of exercise with the average minutes per session.
Ascertainment of MetS
Participants were classified as having MetS using the criteria of the National Cholesterol 
Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III3 at both baseline and follow-up. MetS was 
based on the presence of 3 or more of the following risk factors: 1) abdominal or central 
obesity (waist circumference >102 cm in men, >88 cm in women), 2) fasting 
hypertriglyceridemia (≥150 mg/dL), 3) low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL in men, <50 
mg/dL in women), 4) high blood pressure (≥130/85 mm Hg or history of physician-
diagnosed hypertension) and 5) high fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dL or history of physician-
diagnosed diabetes). Follow-up time was calculated from the baseline examination to the 
first event of MetS or the last follow-up examination through 2006 for individuals who did 
not develop MetS.

 Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were summarized as mean and standard deviation (SD) for 
continuous variables, and as number and percentage (%) for categorical variables. Baseline 
differences for participants with different amounts of resistance exercise were examined 
using analyses of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for 
categorical variables.
Cox proportional hazard regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) of MetS across different amounts and frequencies of resistance 
exercise. Participants who reported no resistance exercise were used as reference category. 
The regression models were adjusted for age, gender, examination year, BMI, current 
smoking, heavy alcohol drinking, abnormal electrocardiography, parental history of CVD, 
hypertension, diabetes, and aerobic exercise (inactive, insufficient, medium, and high). In 
addition, we examined the independent and combined effects of meeting aerobic (≥500 
MET/week23) and/or resistance exercise guidelines on the risk of developing MetS in the 
combined analyses.
To examine potential effect modification by sex in the association between resistance 
exercise and incident MetS, we tested interaction terms of sex and resistance exercise using 
Cox regression. In addition, we compared risk estimates in sex-stratified analyses. We did 
not find any significant interaction, and trends of developing MetS in men and women were 
similar. Therefore, we presented the results of pooled analyses. All statistical tests were 2-
sided, and significance was set at P<.05. All analyses were conducted using SAS software, 
version 9.4.
RESULTS
Among 7418 participants, 15% (n=1147) developed MetS during a median follow-up of 4 
years (maximum 19 years; Table 1). Among individuals who participated in resistance 
exercise (n=2785, 38%), resistance exercise was most frequently performed for 60–119 
minutes per week (n=1061, 38%). Compared to individuals not performing resistance 
exercise, individuals with higher levels of resistance exercise were more likely to be 
younger, leaner (lower BMI and waist circumference), and aerobically active. However, the 
proportion of men decreased with higher levels of resistance exercise. Individuals who 
participated in resistance exercise were also less likely to smoke and had more favorable 
lipids profile (lower triglycerides and higher HDL cholesterol; all P<.05).
Performing any resistance exercise was associated with a 17% lower risk of developing 
MetS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95; P=.006) after adjusting for potential confounders, 
including aerobic exercise levels in the fully adjusted model 3 (Table 2). Meeting the 
resistance exercise guidelines had a similar 17% lower risk of MetS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 
0.73–0.96; P=.009) in the full model (model 3). Furthermore, we found that resistance 
exercise at 1–59, 60–119, 120–179, and ≥180 minutes per week were all associated with 
lower HRs for MetS (all P<.05), compared to no resistance exercise; after adjusting for age, 
gender, and examination year (model 1). However, after further adjustment for other 
potential confounders and aerobic exercise levels (model 3), only 1–59 minutes per week of

 resistance exercise was associated with a 29% reduced risk of MetS (HR, 0.71; 95%CI, 
0.56–0.89; P=.003). We also found that four days per week of resistance exercise was 
associated with a 38% lower risk of developing MetS (HR, 0.62; 95%CI, 0.44–0.89; P=.
009), compared to no resistance exercise in the fully adjusted model (model 3). In additional 
analyses after further adjustment for the number of MetS risk factors (0, 1, or 2) at baseline, 
the results were virtually the same, in that the risk of developing MetS was 14% lower in 
individuals performing any resistance exercise (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98; P=.02), 14% 
lower in individuals meeting the recommended guidelines (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.99; 
P=.03), 26% lower in individuals performing <1 hour per week (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–
0.93; P=.01), and 33% lower in individuals performing 4 times per week (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.47–0.95; P=.03) resistance exercise.
In addition, we examined the risk of MetS among individuals with the same total amount of 
weekly resistance exercise (minutes/week), but at different frequencies (1–2 vs ≥3 times/
week). For example, some people may perform 2 hours of weekly resistance exercise in one 
or two sessions, especially during weekends (so-called “weekend warriors”), whereas others 
may perform the same 2 hours of weekly resistance exercise in more than 2 sessions. In the 
result, the joint analysis of frequency and the total amount of resistance exercise (Figure 1) 
did not show any significant differences in the risk of developing MetS between less 
frequent (1–2 times/week) and more frequent (≥3 times/week) exercisers among individuals 
with the same total amount of weekly resistance exercise. However, we observed a 33% 
lower risk of developing MetS (HR, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.49–0.91; P=.01) in individuals who 
performed resistance exercise 1–2 times per week with a total exercise amount of 1–59 
minutes per week.
Figure 2 shows the independent and combined associations of meeting the resistance and/or 
aerobic exercise guidelines with incident MetS. We found that individuals meeting both 
recommended resistance and aerobic exercise guidelines had a 25% lower risk of developing 
MetS (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63–0. 89; P<.001), compared to individuals meeting neither 
guidelines.
DISCUSSION
This large cohort study yielded three major study findings. First, we demonstrated that 
participating in resistance exercise, independent of aerobic exercise, significantly decreases 
the risk of developing MetS, compared to no resistance exercise in a middle-aged relatively 
healthy population. Specifically, less than one hour per week of resistance exercise resulted 
in significantly lower risk of MetS compared to no resistance exercise. However, higher 
volumes of resistance exercise did not provide further benefits (Table 2), suggesting against 
the “more is better” philosophy. Second, the combined analysis of weekly frequency and 
total amount of resistance exercise (Figure 1) showed no effect of exercise frequency in 
incident MetS at a given total volume of resistance exercise. Therefore, resistance exercise 
for less than one hour per week, regardless of training frequency, may be important in 
preventing MetS. Third, meeting both resistance and aerobic exercise guidelines was 
associated with 25% lower risk of developing MetS, compared to meeting neither of these

 guidelines (Figure 2). This suggests additional benefits of doing both resistance and aerobic 
exercise for the prevention of MetS.
Previous studies have indicated a negative association of muscular strength and MetS, which 
was still present after adjusting for aerobic fitness12. However, the protective effect of 
muscular strength against MetS might be explained by regular participation in resistance 
exercise, because resistance exercise is a major determinant of muscular strength24, 25. 
Cross-sectional studies of muscle-strengthening PA have also reported a negative association 
with the prevalence of MetS15–17, which is in line with our findings. Nevertheless, those 
prior studies only investigated the effect of participating in resistance exercise (yes/no) or 
meeting the resistance exercise guidelines (yes/no). On the other hand, our study further 
examined the dose-response relationship between resistance exercise and incident MetS 
across different weekly frequencies and total amounts of resistance exercise. In addition, we 
also examined the independent and combined effects of resistance and aerobic exercise on 
the development of MetS.
Several studies have investigated the associations between resistance exercise and type 2 
diabetes mellitus, another common metabolic disease. Grontved et al. found a reduced risk 
of type 2 diabetes mellitus by performing less than one hour of resistance exercise per week 
in 32 000 men and 99 000 women 19, 20. In addition, they showed that a combination of 
aerobic and resistance exercise was superior in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus. We 
found similar results for the prevention of MetS. Further, they found a linear dose-response 
relationship between the amount of resistance exercise and the risk of incident type 2 
diabetes mellitus. In contrast, however, we did not observe a linear dose-response 
relationship between resistance exercise and the risk of developing MetS, suggesting against 
the “more is better” hypothesis regarding resistance exercise and development of MetS. 
However, this might be at least partially due to the smaller sample size and number of cases 
in our study. It is also possible that resistance exercise dose-response curves may be different 
between MetS and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These contradictory findings suggest that further 
investigations on dose-response relationships between resistance exercise and different 
health outcomes are clearly warranted. We also investigated the dose-response relationship 
between the frequency of resistance exercise and risk of MetS, demonstrating significant 
benefits of four times per week resistance exercise. However, this result is somewhat 
complicated since the frequency does not necessarily fully represent the total amount of 
resistance exercise. Therefore, the prescription of frequency in the current resistance 
exercise guidelines may lack sufficient detail, whereas a prescription of total minutes per 
week might be more appropriate.
The current study demonstrated that there is no significant difference in the risk of MetS 
between 1–59 and ≥180 minutes per week of resistance exercise, which suggests no 
additional benefits of higher levels of resistance exercise on the development MetS. In 
addition, the dose-response relationship between resistance exercise and MetS may not be 
linear, but reverse J-shaped, which has been found in studies regarding aerobic exercise and 
CVD health26–28. Although it is not clear why there are no further benefits on incident MetS 
by increasing the amount of resistance exercise, it may be related to no significant 
differences in blood pressure and fasting glucose across different amounts of resistance

 exercise, as shown in Table 1. However, more favorable lipid profiles (Triglycerides and 
HDL cholesterol) by increasing resistance exercise (Table 1) may partially explain the 
benefits of resistance exercise on the development of MetS since blood lipids are the 
components of MetS. Furthermore, additional analyses did not show significant differences 
in risk of MetS in individuals performing weekly 1–59 minutes resistance exercise for less 
than one year and more than one year (P>.05). A possible explanation could be the absence 
of training progression (no gradual increase in amount and/or intensity of resistance 
exercise) after a certain period, which results in a stabilization of the muscle mass and 
strength, and therefore no further health benefits. Future studies of long-term resistance 
exercise training with different doses and intensities are therefore needed to determine the 
protection against MetS as well as CVD.
In 2004, Lee et al.29 introduced the concept of ‘weekend warriors’, individuals who meet the 
aerobic exercise guidelines but performed their PA in 1–2 days per week, possibly during 
weekends. They demonstrated that ‘weekend warriors’ still had mortality benefits, compared 
to sedentary individuals, but their benefits were less, compared to individuals who were 
regularly physically active, especially in individuals with major CVD risk factors, such as 
smoking, overweight, and hypertension. In our study there was no effect of increased 
frequency with the same amount of resistance exercise (all P>.05). Nevertheless, only 
individuals performing 1–59 minutes of resistance exercise in 1–2 sessions per week had 
significantly lower risk of MetS, compared to no resistance exercise. This suggests that even 
a relatively small amount of resistance exercise once or twice per week may be enough to 
maximally reduce the risk of MetS, at least from the resistance exercise perspective. 
However, it should be mentioned that the sample sizes and number of cases were smaller in 
categories with higher levels of resistance exercise, which reduced the statistical power in 
these groups.
MetS is more prevalent in older and overweight individuals1. However, subgroup analyses in 
our study appear to show similar negative trends, although not significant, for resistance 
exercise and MetS in different BMI (<25 vs ≥25 kg/m2) and age (<50 vs ≥50 years old) 
groups (data not shown). The lack of statistically significance was probably due to the small 
number of participants and MetS cases across these strata. Nevertheless, the reduced risk of 
MetS by resistance exercise remained significant after adjusting for BMI and age, and shows 
consistency in our findings.
The strengths of this study include a large cohort with a relatively long follow-up time. 
Furthermore, we believe that this is the first prospective study that investigated the 
association between resistance exercise and incident MetS. However, limitations of our 
study include self-reported data on PA, which may cause measurement errors due to over-
reporting of leisure-time PA30. Nevertheless, over-reporting generally causes an 
underestimation of the true effect of exercise on health outcomes31. Only baseline levels of 
PA were used for the analyses, therefore changes in PA patterns were not included in the 
study. Our study includes primarily well-educated non-Hispanic whites from middle-to-
upper socioeconomic strata, which may limit the generalizability of the results, thus the 
findings may be different in other populations. On the other hand, homogeneity in ethnicity 
and socio-economic status reduces potential confounding by race/ethnicity, education, and

 income. Physiological characteristics of this cohort are also similar to other representative 
population samples21. Another limitation is that we had no information about medications to 
take into account in the analyses. Although we adjusted for potential confounders such as 
medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and abnormal electrocardiography) and 
lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol intake, and body mass index), randomized controlled 
trials of resistance exercise are warranted to remove those confounding biases in the future.
CONCLUSION
Meeting the resistance exercise guidelines, independent of aerobic exercise, decreases the 
risk of developing MetS in a middle-aged adult population. Especially, relatively smaller 
amounts of resistance exercise, less than one hour in 1–2 sessions per week as could be seen 
in the “weekend warrior” profile, resulted in the highest reduction in the risk of developing 
MetS, compared to no resistance exercise. Also, meeting both resistance and aerobic 
exercise guidelines is superior in preventing MetS. Therefore, resistance exercise, 
independent of/and combined with aerobic exercise, should be included in one’s PA routine 
for the prevention of MetS. Clinicians should routinely recommend resistance exercise 
training, in addition to aerobic training, for the prevention of MetS and future CVD risk. 
Especially, individuals with CVD risk factors should consider more individualized, safe and 
effective exercise program under the direction of a qualified exercise professional.

 Figure 1. 
Hazard ratios of metabolic syndrome by the combination of weekly frequency (1–2 vs ≥3 
times/week) and minutes of resistance exercise (0, 1–59, 60–119, 120–179 and ≥180 min/
week). The dots indicate hazard ratios and the lines present 95% confidence intervals. The 
model was adjusted for age (years), gender, examination year (year), body mass index (kg/
m2), current smoking (yes/no), heavy alcohol drinking (yes/no), abnormal 
electrocardiography (yes/no), parental history of cardiovascular, hypertension, diabetes 
(yes/no for each), and aerobic exercise (inactive, insufficient, medium and high). Analysis in 
the category of ≥180 minutes in 1–2 sessions resistance exercise per week was not 
applicable (NA).
