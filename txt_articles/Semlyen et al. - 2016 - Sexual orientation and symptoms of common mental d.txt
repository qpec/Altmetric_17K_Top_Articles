Sexual orientation and symptoms of
common mental disorder or low
wellbeing: combined meta-analysis
of 12 UK population health surveys

Abstract
Background: Previous studies have indicated increased risk of mental disorder symptoms, suicide and substance
misuse in lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) adults, compared to heterosexual adults. Our aims were to determine an
estimate of the association between sexual orientation identity and poor mental health and wellbeing among
adults from 12 population surveys in the UK, and to consider whether effects differed for specific subgroups of the
population.
Methods: Individual data were pooled from the British Cohort Study 2012, Health Survey for England 2011, 2012
and 2013, Scottish Health Survey 2008 to 2013, Longitudinal Study of Young People in England 2009/10 and
Understanding Society 2011/12. Individual participant meta-analysis was used to pool estimates from each study,
allowing for between-study variation.
Results: Of 94,818 participants, 1.1 % identified as lesbian/gay, 0.9 % as bisexual, 0.8 % as ‘other’ and 97.2 % as
heterosexual. Adjusting for a range of covariates, adults who identified as lesbian/gay had higher prevalence of
common mental disorder when compared to heterosexuals, but the association was different in different age
groups: apparent for those under 35 (OR = 1.78, 95 % CI 1.40, 2.26), weaker at age 35–54.9 (OR = 1.42, 95 % CI 1.10,
1.84), but strongest at age 55+ (OR = 2.06, 95 % CI 1.29, 3.31). These effects were stronger for bisexual adults, similar for
those identifying as ‘other’, and similar for 'low wellbeing'.
Conclusions: In the UK, LGB adults have higher prevalence of poor mental health and low wellbeing when compared
to heterosexuals, particularly younger and older LGB adults. Sexual orientation identity should be measured routinely in
all health studies and in administrative data in the UK in order to influence national and local policy development and
service delivery. These results reiterate the need for local government, NHS providers and public health policy makers
to consider how to address inequalities in mental health among these minority groups.

 Background
Around 1–2 % of the United Kingdom’s adult population
identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB) [1, 2] and 5 %
as non-heterosexual [2], although because sexual orien-
tation comprises identity, behaviour and attraction [3],
the chosen definition used can lead to variability in these
estimates. We know that sexual minority populations ex-
perience poorer physical heath [4] and engage in riskier
health behaviours such as smoking and hazardous drink-
ing [5]. These inequalities may emerge in adolescence
and early adulthood, then persist throughout the life-
course [6].
Symptoms of poor mental health (e.g. anxiety, depres-
sion) and low wellbeing (e.g. not having ‘positive mental
health’ [7]) are common in the adult population but
there is established evidence that adults who identify as
lesbian, gay or bisexual are at higher risk of experiencing
these symptoms than adults who identify as heterosex-
ual. A systematic review of the prevalence of mental dis-
order, substance abuse, suicidality and self-harm in LGB
people showed that these populations experience a
greater incidence of depression, anxiety, suicidality and
substance misuse [8] than heterosexuals. Meta-analysis
following this review found that LGB people were
around twice as likely to have attempted suicide in their
lifetime and have around 1.5 times higher prevalence of
depression
and
anxiety
disorders
in
the
preceding
12 months. Associations between minority sexual orien-
tation and poorer mental health have persisted over time
with recent studies showing the same effects as older
studies [9]. Such disparities are thought to emerge early
in adolescence and persist into adulthood [10].
Population-based evidence of poorer mental health in
LGB people has been found in samples from the United
States [11, 12], Netherlands [9] and England [13]. Al-
though these findings are restricted to high-income
countries, data from low income countries are minimally
available [14]. Population surveys involving comprehen-
sive psychiatric interviews have shown increased risk of
common mental disorders among LGB adults [2, 13].
Similar results have been found in clinical, community
and convenience samples [13, 15–17]. Until recently
however, sexual orientation was not recorded routinely
in UK population health surveys [5] and remains poorly
recorded in national data collection from services such
as the UK’s Increased Access to Psychological Therapies
(IAPT) services. This lack of recording of sexual orienta-
tion presents challenges when targeted or tailoring inter-
ventions to LGB adults and in particular, subgroups of
LGB adults with specific service needs [18, 19]. Few
studies have considered which subgroups of the LGB
adult population are most at risk of poor mental health
(for example, by age group, sex, ethnic minority status
or educational attainment). The aim of our study was
therefore to evaluate whether the association between
sexual orientation identity and mental health (common
mental disorder and low wellbeing) was different in dif-
ferent subgroups of the non-heterosexual identified adult
population in the United Kingdom, using newly available
pooled data from 12 population health surveys.
Method
Design and setting
Participants were from the British Cohort Study (BCS)
2012 [20], Health Survey for England (HSE) 2011 [21],
2012 [22] and 2013 [23], Scottish Health Survey (SHS)
2008 to 2013 [24], the Longitudinal Study of Young
People in England (LSYPE) 2009/10 [5] and Understand-
ing Society (US) 2011/12 [25], identified by searching
the UK Data Service (search terms ‘sexual orientation’
,
‘gay’
, ‘lesbian’
, ‘bisexual’
, ‘sexuality’). All studies collected
data using either home visit interviews, self-completion
questionnaires, telephone interviews, web surveys or a
combination (details including sampling designs and in-
clusion/exclusion criteria are available from the UK Data
Archive). Our study population comprised adults with
available data on sexual orientation identity, symptoms
of mental health and wellbeing, and study covariates.
Participants and materials
Participants: For all studies included in our analysis, par-
ticipants were recruited through random or stratified
random sampling of their target population.
Sexual orientation identity
Sexual
orientation
identity
was
recorded
in
self-
completion questionnaires in all included studies using
standardised wording recommended by the Office of
National Statistics (ONS) [1]. Participants were asked
‘Which of the following options best describes how you
think of yourself?’ Response options were ‘Heterosexual
or Straight’
, ‘Gay or Lesbian’
, ‘Bisexual’
, ‘Other’
, or refusal.
Participants who refused to answer this question were
excluded from our analysis, on the basis that they could
not be assigned to any sexual orientation identity cat-
egory. Table 1 shows the refusal rate across all studies.
Symptoms of common mental disorder
Meeting the threshold for symptoms of mental health
was defined as scoring 4 or higher on the General
Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) [22, 26]. For HSE,
cases were defined as moderately/severely depressed on
the EQ-5D subscale which measures very similar mental
health symptoms [22, 27–29]. Both instruments have
been validated for the detection of clinically significant
symptoms of mental disorder [7, 26, 30, 31]. Sensitivity
analyses (described below) evaluated whether differences
between these instruments influenced the results.

 Low wellbeing score
Low wellbeing was defined as falling in the lowest sex-
specific quartile of scores on the Warwick-Edinburgh
Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) [7] in the analytic
sample for our study, on the basis that there is currently
no established threshold for defining ‘low wellbeing’ in
the adult population. The WEMWBS has been validated
as a measure of ‘positive mental health’ which covers a
wider range of concepts than the absence of mental dis-
order, including the subjective experience of happiness
and life satisfaction, psychological functioning and self-
realisation.
Covariates
Covariates were selected on the basis that they are
known to be associated with sexual orientation identity
and with symptoms of mental health and wellbeing (i.e.
are potential confounding factors). Covariates were har-
monised across studies to ensure comparability: sex
(male or female), ethnic group (White vs. ethnic minor-
ity), educational attainment (a five-point scale ranging
from
‘none’
to
University
degree),
smoking
status
(current vs. ever smoker), longstanding illness/disability
(yes or no) and married or co-habiting (yes or no).
Statistical analysis
Bivariate associations between sexual orientation identity
and mental health were evaluated using t-tests or chi-
square statistics. For the main analysis, random effects
meta-analysis
with
logistic
regression
was
used
to
evaluate the association between sexual orientation iden-
tity categories, mental health and wellbeing, adjusting
for covariates. In preliminary analyses, we found that the
proportion of variance in the effects accounted for by
between-study variation ranged from 0 % to 53 % (as a
proportion of total study variance), leading us to use
random effects meta-analysis to pool study-specific odds
ratios and their standard errors. Results were obtained
first adjusted for age and sex, then after additional ad-
justment for covariates. We also examined whether sex,
age and educational attainment significantly modified
the
association
between
sexual
orientation
identity
groups and mental health, to identity population sub-
groups with higher relative risks of poor mental health.
In
sensitivity
analyses
to
evaluate
several
possible
sources of bias, we checked whether results differed ma-
terially when using the alternative ‘one stage’ approach
to individual participant meta-analysis [32]. This in-
volves analysing all data simultaneously with a random
effect for study, rather than pooling results from each
study separately. We also evaluated whether results dif-
fered when using only the GHQ-12 not the EQ5D, in
case differences between these instruments influenced
the results. Because some studies used over-sampling of
some population groups and had other complex survey
design features, we compared results separately for Un-
derstanding Society (the study with the largest contribut-
ing sample size) before and after accounting for the
survey design, using sampling weights. We also reran
models replacing the covariate ‘married or co-habiting’

 with ‘married or civil partnered’ to check whether these
affected the estimates in the fully adjusted model. All
analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.1.
Ethical approval
For all of the original studies used, ethical approval
was provided by a university or local research ethics
committee (see UK Data Service for details for each
study). Written informed consent was provided by all
participants. All data are available from the UK Data
Service.
Results and discussion
Of the 94,818 participants in the analytic sample (those
with available data on sexual orientation identity, mental
health and covariates), 97.2 % as heterosexual, 1.1 %
identified as lesbian/gay, 0.9 % as bisexual and 0.8 % as
‘other’ (Table 1). People meeting the threshold of com-
mon mental disorder or low wellbeing were significantly
different across all study variables (using bivariate t-test
or chi-square tests): they were younger, comprised more
females, and had lower levels of educational attainment,
more current smokers, more longstanding illness/dis-
ability and fewer married/co-habiting participants than
those below the threshold (Table 2). Significantly higher
proportions of those who identified as lesbian/gay, bisex-
ual and ‘other’ were found among those who met the
mental disorder threshold.
Compared to heterosexuals, participants identifying as
lesbian/gay were more likely to have poor mental health,
were significantly younger, comprised more men, fewer
ethnic minorities, higher levels of educational attain-
ment, more smokers, and fewer who were married or
cohabiting (Table 3). Compared to heterosexuals, partici-
pants identifying as bisexual had similar patterns to les-
bian/gay participants except no significant differences
were found for sex or educational attainment. Addition-
ally, there was a significantly higher proportion with
longstanding illness/disability among bisexual partici-
pants compared to heterosexual participants. Partici-
pants identifying as ‘other’ were significantly different
across all study variables compared to heterosexuals, ex-
cept for the proportion of smokers which was similar.
Across each of the 12 surveys, the proportion of par-
ticipants identifying as lesbian/gay ranged from 0.7 to
1.9 %, bisexual ranged from 0.5 to 1.7 %, ‘other’ from 0.2
to 1.4 %. Table 1 shows the sample size that each study
contributed to the study, and differences across studies
for study variables, including the refusal rate for the
question about sexual orientation identity.
There was evidence that effects differed for men/
women (p for interaction = 0.02) and by age group (p for
interaction < 0.001) but not for ethnic minority status (p
for interaction = 0.30) or educational attainment (p =
0.19). Differences for men/women generally showed
stronger effects for men but in the same direction for
men and women. Differences across age groups were
more pronounced, leading us to separate age groups for
the main analysis and show men/women separately in
Additional file 1: Table S1.
Results from the main pooled analysis are shown in
Table 3. In the under 35 age group, lesbian/gay identity
was associated with increased risk of symptoms of com-
mon mental disorder, adjusting for a range of covariates
(OR = 2.06, 95 % CI 1.60, 2.66) when compared to het-
erosexuals in the same age group. The association was
not significant in the 35–54.9 age group (OR = 1.03,
95 % CI 0.71, 1.48). The direction of the effect was con-
sistent with a small increase in risk, but there was insuf-
ficient statistical power in this subgroup to estimate this
effect with confidence. In the age group 55+ however,
lesbian/gay identity was associated with more than twice
the risk (OR = 2.11, 95 % CI 1.16, 3.83) of these symp-
toms than the heterosexual reference group. Patterns
were similar in relation to low wellbeing, as measured by
the WEMWBS, with the association weaker at midlife.
Bisexual identity was associated with increased risk of
poor mental health symptoms when compared to het-
erosexuals, across all age groups, with a similar pattern
of effect modification: in the under 35 age group (OR =
2.31, 95 % CI 1.83, 2.90), lowest at age 35 to 54.9 (OR =
1.80, 95 % CI 1.29, 2.50) and strongest at age 55+ (2.45,
95 % CI 1.58, 3.79), adjusting for a range of covariates in
relation to symptoms of common mental disorder. Pat-
terns were broadly similar for low wellbeing, with the as-
sociation weakest at midlife.
The group who identified as ‘other’ showed smaller ef-
fect sizes with wider confidence intervals, but the pat-
tern was consistent with an increase in risk of meeting
the threshold for disordered symptoms in all three
groups when compared to heterosexuals in each age
group: under 35 (OR = 1.96, 0.94, 4.09), 35–54.9 (OR =
1.63, 95 % CI 0.93, 2.86), age 55+ (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI
0.87, 1.86). Statistical power was not sufficient to esti-
mate these smaller effects confidently, because of the
limited sample size in these subgroups. This group were
more likely than heterosexuals to have low wellbeing,
across all three age groups, with weaker effects seen in
older adults.
In sensitivity analyses, the pattern of results was the
same after using the ‘one stage’ approach to analyse the
pooled data. We also reran the models after excluding
studies using the EQ5D rather than the GHQ-12. The
results were not materially different, with lowest relative
risks seen at midlife and highest in older adults. We also
reran models for the ‘Understanding Society’ cohort after
adjusting for the complex survey design using sampling
weights. The same pattern of results was seen. Results

 were not materially different when adjusting for ‘married
or civil partnered’ instead of ‘married or co-habiting’.
By pooling data from 12 population health surveys, we
were able to show that lesbian, gay, bisexual and ‘other’
identified adults (non-heterosexual) were around twice
as likely to report symptoms of poor mental health (i.e.
anxiety, depression) than heterosexual adults. This result
was less strong in female participants (see Table 4). The
lowest relative risks were seen at midlife, with increased
risk strongest in young non-heterosexual adults and
highest for older non-heterosexual adults. Overall, bisex-
ual (vs. heterosexual) adults had the highest risk of
meeting the threshold for disordered symptoms.
This study is the first to pool sexual orientation iden-
tity data from 12 surveys, with data collected in the
United Kingdom, using individual participant meta-
analysis to determine the association with mental health
(common mental disorder and wellbeing) symptoms.
This approach provides sufficient power to examine sub-
groups, which is often not possible within each study
because of low numbers. We were able to evaluate
whether the association differed for men/women, across
levels of educational attainment, for ethnic minorities
and across the age range. The data contained a hetero-
sexual comparison group, often not available in conveni-
ence samples. A standardised question was used to
record sexual orientation identity, allowing comparabil-
ity across studies. An important finding was that a num-
ber of participants selected ‘other’ but not ‘heterosexual’.
It is not clear what participants intended in making this
choice. It could reflect lack of understanding or literacy
problems, a reluctance or refusal to be categorised by
any of the more specific options, or self-identification as
an identity not included in the list. It is also worth not-
ing that this group contained the highest proportion of
ethnic minorities, high levels of longstanding illness/dis-
ability and tended to be older. Future health surveys
could collect additional detail on sexual orientation
identity in order to clarify what this category means to
participants.
The main limitation of our study was that results do
not generalise beyond sexual orientation identity. Results
may have differed if sexual orientation groups were de-
fined in terms of sexual behaviour or sexual attraction,
because adults with same-sex behaviour or same-sex at-
traction do not necessarily identify as non-heterosexual
[2, 33]. When separating age groups, our models had
statistical power >80 % to detect odds ratios larger than
1.5 (assuming 1 % in a comparison group and 99 % in a
heterosexual comparison group, a sample size of 28,000,
R-square of 0.10 and p = 0.05), but did not have suffi-
cient statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes such
as those seen in the ‘other’ group. A further limitation is
that the question did not ask about change in identity
over time. Sexual orientation identity can change over
time, and change in sexual identity might also impact on
mental health [34]. We did not consider longitudinal
changes in mental health over time [35]. Although we
considered age, sex, ethnic minority status and educa-
tional attainment as possible effect modifiers of the asso-
ciation between sexual orientation identity and mental
disorder symptoms, further work could explore regional
differences, as well as people with disabilities and other
groups in the non-heterosexual population who might
be more vulnerable than others. Given clear evidence of
heterogeneity in the refusal rate for the question asked
about sexual orientation identity (Table 1), there is a
need to evaluate methodological differences across stud-
ies and the potential for bias according to mode of sur-

 chance. Statistical power was sufficiently high for evalu-
ating the larger effect sizes observed here but not
smaller effects including those seen for the ‘other’ group.
It is important to note however, that all the subgroups
we considered are important from a public health per-
spective in order to allocate resources and target services
to subgroups of the LGB adult population who have
different service needs [18, 19]. Our analysis was cross-
sectional rather than longitudinal, meaning that we
considered prevalence of poor mental health or low
wellbeing, but not incidence. Elevated prevalence for a
specific subgroup could be a function of higher inci-
dence or longer duration of illness. Finally, the EQ-5D
provides a very limited measure of mental disorder, com-
prising only one question on psychological symptoms
that conflates anxiety with depression. Results were
similar however, when excluding studies using this
measure.
Our
results
are
consistent
with
evidence
inter-
nationally [9, 11–13] that non-heterosexual adults are
at increased risk of mental health symptoms com-
pared to heterosexuals, but provide important new in-
sights by suggesting that younger and older non-
heterosexual adults are particularly vulnerable (com-
pared to those at mid-life). The cross-sectional nature
of the data however, means that we cannot determine
if these are aging, period, or cohort (generational)
effects. These findings could reflect an existing obser-
vation that susceptibility to poor mental health is re-
duced in older adults [22], which may offer individual
non-heterosexual adults some advantage in compari-
son to their younger peers.
Our study did not evaluate explanations for the associ-
ations between sexual orientation identity and mental
health, that is, mechanisms or mediating variables.
Mechanisms underlying an association between LGB
orientation and poor mental health outcomes are not
understood fully, but it has been argued that it is the ex-
perience of discriminatory and stigmatised experiences
that can lead to increased mental disorder, as might
early exposure to adversity [11]. Minority stress theory
[36] suggests that internal and external manifestations of
prejudice, victimization, and discrimination create ob-
served health differences because these experiences are
internalised. Chronic stress brought about by internalis-
ing stigma may therefore lead people who identify as

 non-heterosexual to experience poorer mental health
and wellbeing [37, 38]; unhealthy behaviours [5] and
worse physical health [4]. Certainly in LGB youth, evi-
dence points to an increased risk of harassment and vic-
timisation compared to heterosexual youth [39] and that
the negative impact can be ameliorated by positive atti-
tudes [40] and family support [41]. Many LGB adults do
not disclose their sexual orientation to healthcare profes-
sionals, which could delay access to treatment [42, 43].
This study reinforces the need for clinicians to ensure
that they provide services in which LGB patients can
disclose their sexual orientation and receive supportive
and integrated care.
Public health policies to address health inequalities re-
quire an evidence base that clarifies the extent of the
problem. Population data on sexual orientation identity,
which will provide policy makers and commissioners
with the evidence they need, have only recently become
available in the United Kingdom a limited number of
data sets. Sexual orientation needs to become a part of
routine data collection so that inequalities in poor men-
tal health can be more fully understood. This study em-
phasises
the
need
for
continued,
and
expanded,
collection of sexual orientation in all large health surveys
and cohort studies to understand better the life course
risks and impacts on outcomes for this population
group. The cross-sectional data used in this study allows
us to determine prevalence of poor mental health in this
population. Future research is needed to determine
whether these patterns track over time in longitudinal
data. Longitudinal data will also allow us to monitor the
incidence of new mental health problems rather than
prevalence of existing symptoms, which might vary in
duration. Further research is needed to consider what
the underlying mechanisms of these associations are,
and how interventions can be designed that remove in-
equalities in mental health between adults who identify
as heterosexual and those who identity as lesbian, gay,
bisexual or 'other'.
Conclusions
� Adults identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or ‘other’
are at increased risk of poor mental health and low
wellbeing compared to those identifying as
heterosexual.
� The association varies across the life course, with
the lowest relative risks seen in midlife and the
highest among older adults
� Our study used cross-sectional data suitable for
estimating prevalence, but future studies should
consider longitudinal patterns (such as onset and
persistence of new mental health problems) and
clarify mechanisms
