Abstract
Background
Dietary guidelines recommend avoiding foods high in saturated fat. Yet, emerging evidence
suggests cardiometabolic benefits of dairy products and dairy fat. Evidence on the role of
butter, with high saturated dairy fat content, for total mortality, cardiovascular disease, and
type 2 diabetes remains unclear. We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the
association of butter consumption with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and dia-
betes in general populations.
Methods and Findings
We searched 9 databases from inception to May 2015 without restriction on setting, or lan-
guage, using keywords related to butter consumption and cardiometabolic outcomes. Pro-
spective cohorts or randomized clinical trials providing estimates of effects of butter intake
on mortality, cardiovascular disease including coronary heart disease and stroke, or diabe-
tes in adult populations were included. One investigator screened titles and abstracts; and
two reviewed full-text articles independently in duplicate, and extracted study and partici-
pant characteristics, exposure and outcome definitions and assessment methods, analysis
methods, and adjusted effects and associated uncertainty, all independently in duplicate.
Study quality was evaluated by a modified Newcastle-Ottawa score. Random and fixed
effects meta-analysis pooled findings, with heterogeneity assessed using the I2 statistic and
publication bias by Egger’s test and visual inspection of funnel plots. We identified 9 publi-
cations including 15 country-specific cohorts, together reporting on 636,151 unique partici-
pants with 6.5 million person-years of follow-up and including 28,271 total deaths, 9,783
cases of incident cardiovascular disease, and 23,954 cases of incident diabetes. No RCTs
were identified. Butter consumption was weakly associated with all-cause mortality (N = 9

Conclusions
This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests relatively small or neutral overall asso-
ciations of butter with mortality, CVD, and diabetes. These findings do not support a need
for major emphasis in dietary guidelines on either increasing or decreasing butter consump-
tion, in comparison to other better established dietary priorities; while also highlighting the
need for additional investigation of health and metabolic effects of butter and dairy fat.
Introduction
Growing uncertainty and changing views on the role of butter in cardiovascular disease (CVD)
have been prominently discussed, including in the New York Times and Time Magazine. [1, 2]
This has partly arisen from increasing controversy on the utility of focusing on isolated macro-
nutrients, such as saturated fat, for determining risk of chronic diseases. Mounting evidence
indicates a need to shift away from isolated macronutrients toward food-based paradigms for
investigating dietary priorities for chronic diseases. [3, 4] The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advi-
sory Committee (DGAC) recommended replacing animal fats, including butter, with non-
hydrogenated vegetable oils high in unsaturated fats and relatively low in saturated fatty acids.
[4] Yet, the DGAC also concluded that further research was needed on the effects of saturated
fat from different food sources, including animal products, on cardiovascular risk, because dif-
ferent food sources contain varying specific fatty acid profiles as well as other constituents that
may result in distinct lipid and metabolic effects. [4]
For example, growing evidence supports potential metabolic benefits of certain dairy prod-
ucts, such as yogurt and possibly cheese, on risk of type 2 diabetes [5, 6], which may even relate
to benefits of dairy fat. [7–9] However, the relationship of butter, which is highest in dairy fat,
with diabetes remains unclear. The long-term effects of butter consumption on other major
endpoints, such as all-cause mortality and CVD, are also not well-established. Previous reviews
have evaluated only some of these outcomes, included butter as part of a wider investigation
into dairy foods or types of fats [10–12], and utilized methods that provided imprecise esti-
mates of effect, precluded dose-response evaluation, or may have introduced unintended bias
(e.g., due to inclusion of crude, unadjusted effect estimates).
A systematic review of the evidence for of the relationship between butter consumption and
long-term health is of considerable importance, both for understanding food-based health as
well as informing dietary recommendations for clinicians and policy makers. The US Depart-
ment of Agriculture has documented a 40-year record high in US butter consumption in 2014
[13], making a synthesis of the evidence on butter and major chronic diseases highly relevant
and timely.
To synthesize the evidence on the long-term association of butter consumption with
major health endpoints, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective

 observational studies or randomized clinical trials investigating butter consumption and all-
cause mortality, CVD including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and type 2 diabe-
tes in general populations.
Materials and Methods
We followed Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines (S1
File) for observational studies and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (S2 File) guidelines for trials during all stages of design, implementa-
tion, and reporting.
Data sources
We performed a systematic search for all prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical
trials examining butter consumption and all-cause mortality, CVD including CHD and stroke,
or type 2 diabetes. Electronic searches were performed using PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed), EMBASE (www.scopus.com), The Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com),
Web of Knowledge (www.webofscience.com), CAB Abstracts and Global Health (www.ovid.
com), CINAHL (www.ebscohost.com) and grey literature searches of SIGLE (www.opengrey.
eu) and ZETOC (www.zetoc.mimas.ac.uk/) from the earliest indexing year of each database
through May 2015, without language or other restrictions. Search terms included butter, mar-
garine, dairy, dairy products, yogurt, cheese, ghee, animal fat, solid fat, cardiovascular diseases,
heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart attack, cerebrovascular disease, cerebrovas-
cular accident, sudden death, diabetes, mortality and deaths; see S3 File for a full listing. For all
final included articles, we further performed hand-searches of citation lists and a review of the
first 20 related references on PubMed for additional eligible reports.
In addition, among studies excluded by title and abstract screening, several were identified
evaluating overall dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean, Western, etc.) To ensure that we were
not missing effect estimates for butter contained within these reports (e.g., in supplementary
tables on the individual components of these dietary patterns), we also reviewed the full texts
of the first 15 identified studies of dietary patterns. None of these studies reported individual
effect estimates for butter, so further diet pattern studies lacking any information on butter in
the title or abstract were excluded
Study selection
Titles and abstracts of all identified eligible articles were screened by one investigator. For all
potentially relevant articles, the full text was retrieved and reviewed independently and in
duplicate by two reviewers according to the eligibility criteria.
We searched for all randomized controlled trials or prospective cohorts (cohort, nested
case-subcohort, nested case-control) conducted in adults (18+ y) that provided a multivariate-
adjusted effect estimate (or unadjusted effect estimate in trials) and measure of statistical
uncertainty of the relationship between total or added butter and all-cause mortality, incident
CVD including CHD or stroke, and incident diabetes. We excluded animal, ecologic, quasi-
experimental, and non-prospective observational studies (case reports, cross-sectional studies,
and retrospective case-control studies), editorials, letters, and reviews (S4 File).
Studies were also excluded if evaluating only children or populations with major end-stage
diseases such as cancer; if duration of intervention or follow-up was less than 3 months; if con-
sumption of butter was not separately distinguishable from other dairy product or fats; if evalu-
ating only soft endpoints (e.g. angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency); or, for observational
studies, if providing only unadjusted (crude) effect estimates. When duplicate publications

 were identified, the report including the largest number of cases for each endpoint of interest
was selected. If references were only available in abstract form (e.g. from meeting proceedings
or conference presentations), data were extracted if sufficient detail was available; if not, a rele-
vant publication was searched for in PubMed.
Data extraction
Data from the included studies were independently extracted in duplicate by two investigators
using a standardized and piloted electronic form (Microsoft Excel). Any differences in extrac-
tion were resolved by consensus. Information was extracted on the publication (first author
name, contact information, publication year), study details (name, location, design), popula-
tion (age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, body mass index), sample size, dates of recruit-
ment, duration of follow-up, dietary assessment (dates, method, definition, categories),
outcome(s) (assessment method, definition), covariates and analysis methods, and multivari-
ate-adjusted effect estimates and associated uncertainty. To evaluate dose-response, we
extracted continuous effect estimates when available; and for categorical analyses, collected
additional information on median exposure, number of participants or person-years, and
number of events in each category. Missing information in any category was obtained by direct
author contact or, if necessary, estimated using a standard approach (see S5 File).
When more than one multivariable model was reported, we used the risk estimate including
the greatest number of potential confounders but not potential mediators (e.g., blood cholesterol).
If the main multivariable model included covariates which could either be confounders or inter-
mediates, this was utilized rather than a model with crude or minimal covariate adjustment.
When energy intake was included as a covariate, body mass index was not considered to be an
intermediate variable, so models adjusting for body mass index were extracted (this only arose in
one study, by Buijsse et al. [14]). The effect results from the Guasch-Ferre et al. [15] study were
estimated using the models of risk of diabetes associated with substitution of olive oil for equiva-
lent amounts of butter, and our results were confirmed and validated by contact with the authors.
Quality assessment
We adapted the Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale(NOS) [16] to assess study quality, based on
five criteria evaluating the reporting and appropriateness/representativeness of participant
inclusion and exclusion criteria (combining the first two items of the NOS Selection scale), par-
ticipant attrition (NOS adequacy of follow-up item), control for confounding (NOS Compara-
bility scale), assessment of exposure (NOS ascertainment of exposure item), and assessment of
outcome (combining the first two items of the NOS Outcome scale). One point was allocated
per criterion met, the sum of which provided an overall quality score. A score between 0 and 3
was considered low-quality; and 4 to 5, high-quality. Quality scores were assessed indepen-
dently and in duplicate by two investigators, with any differences resolved by consensus.
Data synthesis and statistical analysis
Reported hazard ratios were assumed to approximate relative risks (RRs). We used the two-
stage generalized least-squares trend estimation method described by Greenland and Long-
necker [17, 18] to perform dose-response analysis and compute study-specific linear estimates
and 95% CIs across categories of butter intake. Butter intakes across studies were standardized
at the study level to 14 g/d, corresponding to one United Stated Department of Agriculture-
defined serving. [19] Study-specific dose-response estimates were then pooled to derive an
overall estimate using inverse-variance weighted DerSimonian and Laird meta-analysis with
random effects. [20] Because random effects can result in larger weights for small outlier

 studies, we also conducted fixed effects meta-analysis for comparison. For reports presenting
results only by study subgroups (e.g., men, women), we first pooled the study-specific sub-
groups using fixed-effect meta-analysis to obtain a single estimate per study.
Heterogeneity between studies was quantified using the I2 statistic, with statistical signifi-
cance (P<0.05) evaluated by the Q statistic. [21] We considered I2 values between 25% and
50%, between 50% and 75% and above75% as upper thresholds for low, moderate, and high
heterogeneity, respectively. We planned pre-specified subgroup analyses to further explore
potential heterogeneity in results by gender, population mean age and body mass index, dura-
tion of follow-up, and study quality score. Restricted cubic spline models [22] with knots at the
25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were used to examine potential nonlinear relations.
Potential for publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and by Egger’s
test. [23] We used Duval and Tweedie’s non-parametric “trim and fill method” to adjust the
pooled estimates for any hypothetically missing studies. [24] All analyses were conducted using
Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas), with 2-tailed alpha = 0.05.

 these endpoints were identified. Outcomes in each study were generally assessed by review of
medical records, linkage to death certificates, or hospital registers.
Diet was generally assessed by detailed, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires;
one cohort utilized a structured diet history interview (Table 1). The median butter consump-
tion across studies ranged from 4.5g/d (0.3 servings/d) in the European Prospective Investiga-
tion into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) studies to 46 g/d (3.2 servings/d) in Finland. Mean
participant age ranged from 44 to 71 years. All studies were published between 2005 and 2015,
and included 1 in the Netherlands, 2 in the US, 2 in Finland, 2 in Sweden, and 2 from the
multi-country, multi-cohort EPIC study which included 8 country-specific cohorts from Den-
mark, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Five of the studies
presented results from models with optimal covariate adjustment including demographics,
clinical risk factors, and other dietary habits; the remainder provided results with moderate
covariate adjustment.
All-cause mortality
Two large studies including 9 country-specific cohorts evaluated butter intake and all-cause
mortality, including 379,763 participants and a total of 28,271 deaths. [27, 30] Pooling these

 butter intake was not significantly associated with CVD (RR = 1.00 (95%CI = 0.98, 1.02;
P = 0.704) (Fig 3). Results were similar with fixed effects; with minimal heterogeneity between
studies (I2 = 0.0%).
Stroke alone was investigated in 3 studies including 5,299 incident cases (Fig 3); and CHD
alone, in 3 studies including 4,484 cases. No significant associations were seen: RR = 1.01 (95%
CI = 0.98, 1.03; P = 0.737), and RR = 0.99 (95%CI = 0.96, 1.03; P = 0.537), respectively, without
evidence for heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0% each).
Total CVD, combining outcomes of CHD and stroke was reported in two cohorts,
consisting of 123,497 participants, with 6051 total CVD events (4033 CHD and 2018
stroke). Results from random and fixed effects meta-analysis were identical (RR = 0.99
(95%CI = 0.96, 1.02); P = 0.498). No heterogeneity between the two studies was detected
(I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.498).

 Type 2 diabetes
Four studies including 11 country-specific cohorts reported on butter consumption and onset
of type 2 diabetes [14, 15, 26, 29], including 201,628 participants and 23,954 incident cases. In
both random-effects and fixed effects meta-analysis, butter consumption was associated with
lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, with 4% lower risk per daily 14g serving: RR = 0.96 (95%
CI = 0.93,0.99); P = 0.021). Moderate heterogeneity was seen (I2 = 42.1%, p-heterogene-
ity = 0.131) (Fig 4).
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
While total numbers of subjects and cases were large, the relatively low number of separate
studies precluded meaningful subgroup analyses by study or participant characteristics, which
were therefore not performed. Similarly, potential nonlinearity in dose-response could not be
meaningfully evaluated for total mortality. Evidence for nonlinearity was not identified for but-
ter intake and CVD or diabetes (by cubic spline regression, P for nonlinearity = 0.364 and
0.160, respectively).
Publication bias and small-study effects
Visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger’s test suggested little evidence for asymmetry or
presence of small-study effects for any CVD (p = 0.866), stroke (p = 0.913), CHD (p = 0.769),
or diabetes (p = 0.369), although the relatively small number of studies limited statistical power
of Egger’s test (S1 Fig). Egger’s test could not estimate small-study effects for all-cause mortal-
ity (N = 2 studies). No trimming was identified for all-cause mortality or CVD using Duval

 and Tweedie’s “Trim and Fill” method (S2 Fig). For diabetes, this approach did estimate one
missing study, the addition of which resulted in a theoretical corrected pooled estimate of
RR = 0.95 (95%CI = 0.93, 0.98; P = 0.001).
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies, we found a small positive
association between butter consumption and all-cause mortality, no significant association
with incident CVD or CVD subtypes, and a modest inverse association with type 2 diabetesNo
RCTs of butter intake were identified in our literature search. Because several of the identified
reports included multiple country-specific cohorts, the total numbers of nation-specific
cohorts, participants, and clinical events appear reasonably robust. Indeed, together these stud-
ies included more than 28,000 total deaths, nearly 10,000 cases of incident CVD, and nearly
24,000 cases of incident diabetes. We found limited formal evidence for between-study hetero-
geneity or publication bias, and all reports had high quality scores. Together, these findings
suggest relatively small or neutral associations of butter consumption with long-term health.
Current dietary recommendations on butter and dairy fat are largely based upon predicted
effects of specific individual nutrients (e.g., total saturated fat, calcium), rather than actual
observed health effects. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence on long-term health
effects of specific foods and types of fats. [12, 32, 33] Conventional guidelines on dietary fats
have not accounted for their diverse food sources nor the specific individual fatty acid profiles
in such foods. [4] Different foods represent complex matrices of nutrients, processing, and
food structure, which together influence net health effects. [3, 34] Thus, studying intakes of
foods, as in the present investigation, is crucial to elucidate health impact. Our novel results,
together with other prior research described below, indicate a need for further funding, evalua-
tion, and reporting on health effects of butter and dairy fat on mechanistic pathways and long-
term health outcomes.
While prior meta-analyses have evaluated total dairy or some dairy subtypes and incident
diabetes, to our knowledge none have evaluated butter and type 2 diabetes. [6, 12] A meta-anal-
ysis of butter and all-cause mortality identified no significant association (highest category vs.
lowest: RR = 0.96; 95%CI = 0.95, 1.08) [10], but did not include the more recent large report
from Sluik et al. [30](258,911 participants, 12,135 deaths) and also included two smaller studies
not meeting our inclusion criteria: one having only crude (unadjusted) estimates, [35] and
another evaluating polyunsaturated fats or margarine in comparison to butter, rather than but-
ter separately. [36] A meta-analysis evaluating dairy consumption and CVD found no associa-
tion between butter consumption and stroke (2 cohorts: RR = 0.94; 95%CI = 0.84, 1.06) or
CHD (3 cohorts: RR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.88, 1.20), but only evaluated high vs. low categories of
intake rather than conducting dose-response analyses utilizing all available data. [5] Another
meta-analysis included dose-response findings on butter consumption and stroke, but not
CHD, CVD, diabetes, or all-cause mortality, and arrived at similar findings for stroke as seen
in the present study. [11] In comparison to these prior reports, we evaluated up-to-date reports
and full dose-response analyses for all-cause mortality, CVD including CHD and stroke, and
type 2 diabetes; providing the most comprehensive investigation to-date of butter consumption
and risk of long-term major health endpoints.
Our investigation also adds to and expands upon prior studies evaluating other dairy foods
and dairy fat biomarkers in relation to cardiometabolic outcomes. In a multi-ethnic US popula-
tion, serum levels of pentadecanoic acid (15:0), the odd-chain saturated fat most strongly asso-
ciated with self-reported butter intakes (r = 0.13), were associated with lower CVD and CHD
risk. [37] This is consistent with a meta-analysis of odd-chain saturated fat biomarkers

 demonstrating inverse associations with CHD [33]. A prior meta-analysis of dairy consump-
tion and CVD suggested protective associations with total CVD (for highest vs lowest category
of intake: 12% lower risk) and stroke (13% lower risk), with conflicting results for major sub-
types of dairy. [5] Dairy fat has also been linked to lower risk of diabetes, based on studies of
circulating fatty acid biomarkers [8, 9] and studies of self-reported consumption of dairy prod-
ucts, which have seen protective associations for yogurt and perhaps cheese, and null associa-
tions for both low-fat and whole-fat milk. [12, 27]
Given adverse effects of certain dairy fats (e.g. 16:0) on cardiometabolic risk factors such as
LDL-cholesterol and fasting glucose [38, 39], our findings suggest potential presence of other
mechanistic benefits of butter that might at least partly offset these harms. For instance, satu-
rated fats also increase HDL-C, lower VLDL-C and chylomicron remnants, and lower lipopro-
tein(a) [40, 41]; while potential cardiometabolic benefits have been identified for calcium, fat-
soluble vitamin D, medium-chain saturated fats, branched-chain fats, trace ruminant trans
fats, or other processes related to fermentation (e.g. cheese) or active bacterial cultures (e.g. in
yogurt). For example, dietary calcium may decrease fatty acid synthase and increase lipolytic
activity in adipocytes, [42] reduce blood pressure by modulation of smooth muscle reactivity,
[43, 44] and reduce weight gain. [45] Vitamin D may reduce dyslipidemia and improve blood
pressure through maintenance of calcium homeostasis, stimulation of insulin production and
release, and regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Higher dairy fat consump-
tion has been linked to lower liver fat and greater hepatic and systemic insulin sensitivity [46]
which could relate to inhibition of hepatic de novo lipogenesis by specific dairy fatty acids. [8]
Branched-chain fatty acids in dairy fat may promote healthier bacterial microbiome composi-
tion and function. Dairy fat also contains monounsaturated fats which might improve glycemic
responses and insulin sensitivity. [47, 48] Other dairy-related factors, such as probiotic bacteria
in yogurt and menaquinones in fermented milk and cheeses, may improve insulin sensitivity,
reduce weight gain, and reduce inflammation through microbiome and vitamin-K related
pathways; [49, 50] such pathways would be less relevant for butter, which has been linked to
greater weight gain. [51, 52] Clearly, additional mechanistic studies on health effects of butter,
dairy fat, and dairy foods are warranted.
Our results suggest relatively small or neutral overall associations of butter with mortality,
CVD, and diabetes. These findings should be considered against clear harmful effects of refined
grains, starches, and sugars on CVD and diabetes; [53–55] and corresponding benefits of fruits,
nuts, legumes, n-6 rich vegetable oils, and possibly other foods such as fish on these endpoints.
In sum, these results suggest that health effects of butter should be considered against the alter-
native choice. For instance, butter may be a more healthful choice than the white bread or
potato on which it is commonly spread. In contrast, margarines, spreads, and cooking oils rich
in healthful oils, such as soybean, canola, flaxseed, and extra-virgin olive oil, appear to be
healthier choices than either butter or refined grains, starches, and sugars. [15, 56, 57] In
Guasch-Ferre’s analysis of the Nurses Health Study, substitution of 8 g olive oil for an equiva-
lent amount of butter was associated with an 8% reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes
(RR = 0.92 (95%CI = 0.87, 0.97). [15] Thus, even with an absence of major health associations
in the present investigation, healthier (and less healthy) alternatives may be available. Our find-
ings suggest a major focus on eating more or less butter, by itself, may not be linked to large dif-
ferences in mortality, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. In sum, our findings do not support a
need for major emphasis in dietary guidelines on butter consumption, in comparison to other
better established dietary priorities. In any meta-analysis, the effects of potential publication
bias should be considered. Such bias increases the probability that large, positive associations,
rather than small or null findings, will be published. In this case, the identified studies each
reported generally modest or null findings. Considering the number of large prospective

 studies globally having data on dietary habits (including butter consumption) and these out-
comes, it is evident that many additional cohort studies have collected such data but not ana-
lyzed or reported their findings. Such “missing,” unpublished studies may be more likely to
have null effects. This may be particularly relevant for total mortality, with only 2 identified
publications: additional publications might plausibly move findings toward the null. For diabe-
tes, where a larger count of publications allowed better assessment for bias, the “trim and fill”
method identified one theoretical missing study, with a protective point estimate.
Our investigation has several strengths. We followed stringent eligibility criteria that maxi-
mized inclusion of high quality, comparable studies. Our comprehensive literature search of
multiple databases together with author contacts for clarification and missing data maximized
statistical power and minimized the possibility of missed reports. While relatively few publica-
tions reported on certain outcomes, the identified studies were large, included multiple nation-
specific cohorts and thousands of cases, and were of high quality; and as described above, it
would be unlikely that publication bias would explain small or null (as opposed to large) associ-
ations. The inclusion of generally healthy participants followed since the 1980s and 1990s to
the present provided populations generally free of lipid-lowering medications, which might
otherwise mask full effects of butter on CVD. The identified cohorts provided a wide range of
butter intakes, increasing power to detect an effect, if present. The dose-response analyses max-
imized use of all reported data, increasing precision.
Potential limitations should be considered. The health effect of any food could be modified
by a person’s background diet, genetics, or risk factor profile. This is true for any lifestyle, phar-
macologic, or other health intervention—effects may be modified by other treatments or
underlying characteristics—but this does not lessen the relevance of evaluating the average
population effect. We did not observe any obvious differences in associations based on country
or region, where background dietary patterns might differ; but the number of identified studies
precluded robust investigation of potential sources of heterogeneity. While the majority of
studies adjusted for major demographic, clinical, and dietary covariates, residual confounding
may be present. Because butter consumption is associated with generally worse diet patterns
and lifestyle habits [58, 59], such residual confounding may overestimate potential harms of
butter for mortality, and underestimate potential benefits of butter for CVD or diabetes. Error
or bias in measurement of dietary intake from self-reports, as well as the long periods between
dietary assessment and follow-up in several studies (10 years or more), may attenuate findings.
On the other hand, even with such limitations, many other dietary factors in these and other
cohorts have identified significant associations with mortality, CVD, and diabetes, so this is
unlikely to be the sole explanation for the null findings. We did not identify any randomized
clinical trials of our hard endpoints, although such a long-term trial focused on butter alone
might be prohibitively expensive and impractical. Our results are based on best available obser-
vational findings, and long-term interventional studies were not found, limiting inference on
causality.
In conclusion, the available evidence indicates small or neutral associations of butter con-
sumption with all-cause mortality, CVD, and type 2 diabetes.
