In Brief
Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells are considered
to be a homogeneous and rapidly
proliferating population. Barriga et al.
show that the RNA binding protein Mex3a
defines a subset of slowly proliferating
Lgr5+ cells that contribute to all intestinal
lineages with slow kinetics, are resistant
to chemotherapy, and support intestinal
regeneration.

SUMMARY
Highly proliferative Lgr5+ stem cells maintain the in-
testinal epithelium and are thought to be largely ho-
mogeneous. Although quiescent intestinal stem cell
(ISC) populations have been described, the identity
and features of such a population remain controver-
sial. Here we report unanticipated heterogeneity
within the Lgr5+ ISC pool. We found that expression
of the RNA-binding protein Mex3a labels a slowly
cycling subpopulation of Lgr5+ ISCs that contribute
to all intestinal lineages with distinct kinetics. Sin-
gle-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that Lgr5+
cells adopt two discrete states, one of which is
defined by a Mex3a expression program and rela-
tively low levels of proliferation genes. During
homeostasis, Mex3a+ cells continually shift into the
rapidly dividing, self-renewing ISC pool. Chemo-
therapy and radiation preferentially target rapidly
dividing Lgr5+ cells but spare the Mex3a-high/
Lgr5+ population, helping to promote regeneration
of the intestinal epithelium following toxic insults.
Thus, Mex3a defines a reserve-like ISC population
within the Lgr5+ compartment.
INTRODUCTION
The small intestine is the fastest self-renewing tissue in mam-
mals (Clevers, 2013). Cells are generated within invaginations
of the epithelium called crypts, migrate rapidly toward the
surface, and die at the tip of finger-like protrusions known as villi.
This whole process takes less than a week. In homeostasis, cell
loss in the villi is compensated by continuous cell production in
crypts. The rapid cellular turnover of the intestine is powered
by Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that reside at the bottom-
most positions of the crypts (Barker et al., 2007). Lgr5+ cells
actively proliferate and give rise to progenitors that differentiate
as they reach the top of the crypts. Large numbers of absorptive
cells (enterocytes) and mucosecreting cells (goblet cells) that
populate the intestinal epithelium are generated by amplification
of the progenitor pool through several rounds of cell division
before differentiation. A subset of progenitor cells undergoes
differentiation to Paneth cells, which remain intermingled with
Lgr5+ cells at the base of the crypt. In addition, the small intes-
tine contains three low-abundance cell types: enteroendocrine
cells, which are hormone-secreting cells scattered throughout
the crypts and villi; microfold (M) cells, which line the Peyer
patches and initiate mucosal immunity; and tuft cells, which
are dedicated to sensing and triggering responses to helminth
parasites. Enteroendocrine, M, and tuft cells in the intestine
represent less than 1 epithelial cell in every 100.
Lgr5+ ISCs proliferate as a homogeneous cell pool (Snippert
et al., 2010), with a rate of about one division per day (Barker
et al., 2007). Such a high proliferation rate renders Lgr5+ ISCs
sensitive to DNA and cytostatic damage (Tao et al., 2015).
Despite single-cell profiling supporting the absence of heteroge-
neity in the Lgr5+ cell population (Gr€
un et al., 2015), the intestine
displays a remarkable capacity to recover from these insults,
suggesting the existence of reserve or facultative stem cells in
a relatively quiescent state. Numerous studies have proposed
that quiescent ISCs occupy the +4 crypt position and express
markers such as Bmi1, mTert, Lrig1, or Hopx (Montgomery
et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2012; Takeda et al., 2011; Yan et al.,
2012). However, the existence and identity of such quiescent
ISCs have been largely controversial (Mun
˜ oz et al., 2012) and
remain a matter of debate. It was also shown that, upon damage
of the Lgr5+ pool, committed progenitor cells undergo dediffer-
entiation and act as facultative stem cells by regenerating the
ISC compartment. For example, Alpi+ enterocytes act as facul-
tative stem cells upon genetic ablation of Lgr5+ cells (Tetteh
et al., 2016). Likewise, crypt progenitors that express the Notch
ligand Dll1 give rise to secretory cells under homeostatic condi-
tions, but they produce Lgr5+ ISCs upon radiation-induced

 damage of the intestine (van Es et al., 2012). Secretory cell
progenitors are slow-proliferating, retain DNA labels, and are
relatively
resistant
to
chemotherapeutic
drugs
(Buczacki
et al., 2013).
Mex3a belongs to the Mex3 family that, in mammals, contains
four members encoded by different genes: Mex3a, Mex3b,
Mex3c, and Mex3d. Mex3 proteins have highly conserved RNA
binding domains and a C-terminal RING finger domain with E3
ubiquitin ligase activity (Buchet-Poyau et al., 2007). The role of
Mex
genes
in
mammals
is
largely
unknown,
but
their
C. elegans homolog, mex3, is required for germline stem cell
identity and maintenance (Ciosk et al., 2006), and human
MEX3A has been correlated to stemness in colon cancer cell
lines (Pereira et al., 2013). Here we report that Mex3a labels a
subpopulation of slowly proliferating progenitor cells located
around the +3/+4 crypt position. Under homeostatic conditions,
Mex3a-high cells give rise to cells that differentiate into all intes-
tinal lineages with low output. A substantial proportion of Mex3a-
high cells also produce rapidly proliferating ISCs in homeostasis.
Upon damage of the intestinal epithelium with chemotherapy or
irradiation, Mex3a-high cells are spared, and a larger proportion
of this population contributes to regeneration of the rapidly prolif-
erating ISC pool.
RESULTS
Characterization of Mex3a-Expressing Intestinal Cells
We compared the specific transcriptional programs of ISCs of
the mouse small intestine (Mun
˜ oz et al., 2012), mouse large in-
testine, and human colon (Jung et al., 2011) (Figure S1A; Table
S1). These three sets of ISCs were characterized by expression
of canonical intestinal stem cell markers such as Lgr5 (Barker
et al., 2007), Ascl2 (van der Flier et al., 2009), EphB3 (Batlle
et al., 2002), and Smoc2 (Mun
˜ oz et al., 2012). We focused our
attention on the RNA binding protein Mex3a, which was enriched
in the three types of ISCs, but it had not been studied previously
in the intestine. We confirmed by qRT-PCR that Mex3a was up-
regulated in human and mouse ISCs (Figure S1B). By RNAscope
in situ hybridization (ISH) on small intestine tissue, we found that
Mex3a mRNA was restricted to crypt base columnar cells
(CBCs) (Figure 1A). Most CBCs displayed low levels, but about
half of the crypts in each histological section contained one to
three CBCs with relative higher Mex3a mRNA abundance (Fig-
ure 1B). Quantification revealed that Mex3a-high cells were pref-
erentially located at the crypt position +3 near the boundary of
the Paneth cell compartment (Figure 1C). To functionally analyze
the population of cells that express Mex3a, we generated mice
bearing a transcriptional reporter cassette knocked in at the start
codon of the Mex3a locus. The reporter cassette consisted of
tdTomato and CreERT2 cDNAs separated by self-cleavage
T2A peptide (Figure 1D; Figure S1C). We termed this mouse
strain Mex3aTom-CreERt2/+ (hereafter referred to as Mex3aTom/+).
Mex3aTom/+ mice were born at Mendelian ratios, had normal
lifespans, were fertile, and showed no overt phenotype. Analysis
of reporter expression in the small intestine revealed Tomato-pos-
itive (Tom+) cells positioned at the crypt base. The expression of
the reporter was low, which is in agreement with the low endoge-
nous levels of Mex3a mRNA detected by qRT-PCR and ISH. We
observed that cells with higher Tomato levels were located most
frequently near uppermost Paneth cells; i.e., the +3/+4 crypt re-
gion (Figure 1D). In flow cytometry analysis of dissociated crypt-
enriched epithelial cells, approximately 4% were Tom+. We
defined the Tom-high cell population as the top 20% brightest
cells of the Tom+ fraction, which correspond to about 1% of all
crypt cells (Figure 1E). Given that each crypt is formed by 200–
300 epithelial cells, this threshold coincides with two to three
Tom-high cells per crypt, which is roughly the frequency of
Mex3a-high cells observed by ISH. Indeed, Tom-high cells ex-
pressed the highest levels of Mex3a mRNA (Figure 1F).
Genes driven by WNT signaling in ISCs, such as Lgr5, Ascl2,
Axin2, Fzd2, or Smoc2, were expressed at similar levels in
Mex3a-high compared with Mex3a-low cells, whereas Mex3a-
negative (neg) cells displayed severalfold lower expression (Fig-
ure 1F). In contrast, expression of markers of mucosecreting and
enterocyte differentiation was highest in the Mex3a-negative cell
population (Figure 1G). We also assessed the expression of
putative +4 ISC markers. We observed a small but consistent
enrichment in Bmi1 and Tert in Mex3a-high cells (Figure 1H).
To further define the phenotype of Mex3a-expressing cell popu-
lations, we performed transcriptomics of Mex3a-high, -low, and
-neg cells (Table S2). Gene ontology analysis showed that
Mex3a-high cells were enriched in genes encoding secretory
cell functions and hormone metabolic processes and also in
genes that negatively regulate the cell cycle (Figure 1I; Table
S3). This profile differed substantially from that of Lgr5-high cells,
which were characterized by expression of genes that promote
mitosis, Wnt signaling, and biosynthetic processes, as reported
previously (Figure 1I; Table S3; Mun
˜ oz et al., 2012).

 Mex3a-High Cells Are Slow Proliferating
In agreement with the expression of a gene program of negative
regulation of cell proliferation in Mex3a-high cells, we confirmed
high levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p57
(Cdkn1c) and p21 (Cdkn1a) in Mex3a-high cells (Figure 2A). To
study the proliferative status of Mex3a-expressing cells in vivo,
we interrogated Cyp1a1::H2B-YFP mice, which express H2B-
YFP under the control of the beta-naphthoflavone-inducible
Cyp1a1 promoter in all epithelial intestinal cells except in Paneth
cells. In pulse-chase experiments, only long-lived slowly prolifer-
ating cells retain the H2B-YFP label after 10 days of induction
with beta-naphthoflavone (Buczacki et al., 2013). Label-retaining
cells (LRCs) were characterized by elevated levels of both Mex3a
and Lgr5 (Figure 2B). Analysis of the transcriptomes of LRCs re-
vealed 68 genes specifically upregulated in LRCs (H2B-YFP+
compared with H2B-YFP� cells and Paneth cells; Table S4).
This LRC signature was very significantly enriched in Mex3a-
high cells (Figure 2C). We confirmed expression of LRC-specific
genes such as Rfx6 and Peg3 by qRT-PCR in Mex3a-high cells
(Figure 2D).
To functionally validate the association of Mex3a-high cells
with LRCs, we crossed Cyp1a1::H2B-YFP mice with Mex3aTom/+
mice and analyzed the distribution of the two reporters in com-
pound mice. We had previously demonstrated that high surface
abundance of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 identifies cells
at the bottommost positions of the crypt and enables the isola-
tion of ISCs from mouse and human intestine (Jung et al.,
2011; Merlos-Sua
´ rez et al., 2011). Pulse-chase experiments
demonstrated
that
Mex3a-high/EphB2-high
cells
retained
H2B-YFP compared with the Mex3a-neg/EphB2-high cell popu-
lation (Figures 2E and 2F). Within H2B-YFP-retaining cells, LRC
gene expression was largely restricted to the Mex3a-high popu-
lation (Figure S2A). We also performed classical DNA labeling of
proliferative cells using the nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-20-deox-
yuridine (EdU) (Figure 2G). These experiments confirmed that
Mex3a-high cells retained about 15-fold more EdU than
Mex3a-neg cells 10 days after labeling (Figure 2H). From these
experiments, we concluded that Mex3a marks a population of
slowly proliferating cells within the crypt base.
Lineage Tracing from Mex3a-High Cells
We next sought to analyze the contribution of Mex3a-high cells
to intestinal homeostasis (Figure 3). To this end, we crossed
Mex3aTom/+ mice to Rosa26 mTmG mice (Muzumdar et al.,
2007). In this mouse model, induction with tamoxifen switches
on the activity of Mex3a-driven CreERT2, which, in turn, acti-
vates the expression of membrane-bound GFP (GFP) in
Mex3a-expressing cells and their progeny. In parallel, we
analyzed
the
dynamics
of
Lgr5+
cells
using
Lgr5GFP/+;
Rosa26RLacZ mice (Figure S3A). These experiments were per-
formed under conditions that trigger recombination in one cell
per crypt. We focused our analysis on the small intestine and first
established the initial position of Mex3a-derived clones. 36 hr af-
ter induction, around 80% of clones were located just above or
below the uppermost Paneth cells, within the crypt +3/+4 region
(Figure 3A). Lineage tracing from the Lgr5GFP/+ mice showed a
distribution of labeled cells complementary to that observed
in Mex3aTom/+ mice at this early time point; i.e., 80% of LacZ+
cells were positioned at the crypt base, whereas the rest
marked +3/+4 crypt cells (Figure 3A). Thus, the initial position
of Mex3a+ clones coincided approximately with that of cells ex-
pressing the highest levels of Mex3a mRNA (Figures 1A and 1D).
However, we could only find about one recombined (GFP+) cell
every 700 crypts, and this frequency remained in a similar range
over the first month of tracing despite the progressive increase in
clone size (Figure 3B). Thus, recombination of the Rosa26 mTmG
reporter allele only occurred in a small fraction of Tomato-
CreERT2-expressing cells, which probably reflects poor Cre
recombinase activity as a result of low expression of the
Mex3a locus. Nevertheless, we confirmed that creERT2 mRNA
was largely restricted to Mex3a-high cells (Figure S3B), implying
that most traces originate from this population. We also found
that clones arising 3 days after tamoxifen induction, which
were mostly composed of one or two cells, retained higher levels
of Mex3a and p57 mRNA compared with non-recombined cells
(Figure S3C). To overcome the limitations imposed by the low
frequency of recombination and capture the behavior of the
whole Mex3a+ cell population, we assessed a large number of
clones for each time point in subsequent experiments (n = 56–
331 clones; Figure 3B).
Clones generated by Mex3a+ cells increased progressively in
size but displayed slow growth kinetics compared with those
produced by Lgr5+ cells (Figures 3C and 3D). At 3 days of
tracing, around 80% of GFP+ clones in Mex3aTom/+ mice ap-
peared as one or two labeled cells around the crypt +3/+4 region
(Figure 3C and examples in Figure 3G). At 7 days, approximately
50% of clones were still composed of one or two cells, whereas
only one-third had expanded beyond 20 cells (Figure 3C and
Figure 2. Mex3a Expression Identifies Intestinal Label-Retaining Cells

 examples in Figure 3H). At this time point, most clones within
crypts remained localized at the +3/+4 position (Figure 3E) and
included one or two CBCs (Figure 3F). In contrast, Lgr5+ cells
generated clones that, after 7 days, appeared as ribbons of cells
that expanded from the crypt base up to the villus tip (Figure 3D
and examples in Figure S3E). This pattern is generated by the
rapid and continuous proliferation of ISCs as described else-
where (Barker et al., 2007; Lopez-Garcia et al., 2010). Impor-
tantly, we did not observe a single ribbon in Mex3aTom/+ mice
at 7 days of tracing, implying that we did not initially mark any
fast-dividing ISCs. However,
ribbons
equivalent
to those
observed in Lgr5GFP/+ mice appeared after 14 days of tamoxifen
induction and progressively became more abundant up to a
point where they were the only clone type present at 28 days
(Figure 3C and example in Figure S3E). Quantification of clone
number per crypt indicated that the frequency decreased
progressively until day 28 to then stabilize, coinciding with the
preponderance of ribbon clones (Figure 3B). Analysis of clone
position in Mex3aTom/+ mice showed that the majority migrated
into the villus over a period of 2 weeks, but some clones re-
mained in the crypt even after 14 days (Figure 3E). These delayed
clones may result from either slow cell migration or simply repre-
sent new clones generated by traced Mex3a+ cells. Altogether,
these observations suggest that Mex3a labels a population of
slowly dividing progenitor cells. The emergence of ribbon clones
2 weeks after tamoxifen induction implies that a substantial frac-
tion of Mex3a+ cells or their progeny gives rise to rapidly prolif-
erating ISCs under homeostatic conditions.
We next studied the cell composition of the clones formed by
Mex3a+ cells. 3 days post-induction, the majority of single cells
and small clones were located within the crypt. None expressed
differentiation markers (n = 59 clones; Figure 4A). At 1 week, 60%
of clones had migrated into the upper region of the crypt and the
villus (Figure 3E). Villus clones formed by one or two cells
expressed DCLK1, CHGA, or ANPEP, implying differentiation to-
ward tuft, enteroendocrine, or adsorptive lineages, respectively
(examples in Figure 4B and Figure S4A). Multi-cell clones
(3–20 cells) were composed of both absorptive (ANPEP+) and
mucosecreting cells (MUC2+) (examples in Figure 4C). Six
clones of 241 analyzed contained Paneth cells located at the
crypt base (examples in Figure S4B). Quantification revealed
approximately a 3:1 ratio of absorptive versus secretory cell dif-
ferentiation (Figure 4D). Clones that, after 7 days, remained posi-
tioned near the crypt base did not express differentiation makers
(examples in Figure 4E and Figures S4C and S4D). From these
results, we conclude that, similar to Lgr5+ ISCs, Mex3a-high
cells generate multilineage progeny, albeit with low output.
Mex3a Is Expressed in a Subset of Lgr5+ Cells
To explore the relationship between the Mex3a+ and Lgr5+ cell
populations, we crossed Mex3aTom/+ mice with the Lgr5GFP/+
strain (Barker et al., 2007) and analyzed the distribution of the
two fluorescent reporters in crypt cells of the small intestine. Pre-
vious studies had shown that Lgr5-high cells represent ISCs,
whereas Lgr5-low cells are early transient amplifying cells (van
der Flier et al., 2009). GFP-negative cells are not informative of
Lgr5 mRNA as a result of mosaicism in transgene expression
in these mice (Schuijers et al., 2014). We thus limited our
analyses to the distribution of Mex3a-Tomato within the Lgr5-
GFP+ gate. Lgr5-high/Mex3a-high cells represented around
5% of total GFP cells, and Lgr5-low/Mex3a-high cell repre-
sented around 4% of total GFP cells (Figure 5A; Figure S5A).
Thus, one in every five Lgr5-high and one in every 16 Lgr5-low
cells are Mex3a-high.
We measured expression of marker genes by qRT-PCR
across the six cell populations defined by Mex3a-Tomato and
Lgr5-GFP levels (Figures 5B–5D; Table S5). ISC-specific and
WNT-driven genes were elevated in Lgr5-high cells regardless
of Mex3a expression. Mex3a mRNAs were highest in Mex3a-
high/Lgr5-high cells (Figure 5B). Paneth cell-specific genes
such as Defa and Lyz1 were expressed in Mex3a-high/Lgr5-
high cells (Figure 5D), but the levels of these genes were
80-fold lower in Mex3a-high cells than in mature Paneth cells
(Figure S5C). Consistent with our previous data, Mex3a-high
cell populations contained 2- to 3-fold more Bmi1 mRNA
(Figure S5B).
The Lgr5-low cell population was characterized by reduced
expression of ISC/WNT genes and elevated levels of markers
of intestinal differentiation, as reported previously (Figures 5B
and 5C; van der Flier et al., 2009). Mucosecreting (Muc2+/
Tff3+) and absorptive progenitor cells (Alpi+) were captured in
Lgr5-low/Mex3a-low and Lgr5-low/Mex3a-neg gates, implying
that these cells represent transient amplifying cells (Figure 5C).
Dll1+, a marker of secretory precursors, was within the limit of
detection, but it did not show differential expression between
subpopulations
(Figure
S5B).
Interestingly,
the
Lgr5-low/
Mex3a-high cell population expressed genes characteristic of
low abundant lineages: tuft cells (Dclk1), enteroendocrine cells

 (Chga), and M cells (Spib) (Figure 5D). Altogether, these expres-
sion patterns indicate that Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high cells resemble
ISCs with an incipient expression of genes characteristic of both
Paneth and rare secretory cells. Of note, most of the clones
observed in lineage tracing experiments using the Mex3aTom
driver probably originated from the Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high popu-
lation, as inferred from the observation that these cells ex-
pressed the highest levels of creERT2 (Figure 5B).
We next assessed the clonogenic potential of Mex3a/Lgr5
subpopulations, using as readout their ability to form in vitro
organoids (Sato et al., 2009). As reported previously, Lgr5-high
cells showed the highest organoid-forming capacity in media
supplemented with RSPO1, epidermal growth factor (EGF),
and NOGGIN (Sato et al., 2009). We found, however, that
Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high cells formed 3-fold and 10-fold more or-
ganoids than Mex3a-low/Lgr5-high and Mex3a-neg/Lgr5-high
cell populations, respectively (Figures 5E and 5F). Organoids
generated from Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high cells contained all intesti-
nal lineages (Figure 5G) and could be maintained during multiple
passages (n = 8), implying self-renewal and multilineage differen-
tiation potential. Finally, to test whether Mex3a-high/Lgr5-low
cells could gain clonogenic potential under conditions that
promote self-renewal, we enforced WNT and NOTCH signaling
using CHIR99021 and valproic acid, two small molecules that
maximize signaling from these pathways in the absence of
ligands (Yin et al., 2014). Under these conditions, cells remain
blocked in an ISC-like state, as indicated by the formation of
spheroids, but Mex3a-high/Lgr5-low and Mex3a-low/Lgr5-low
cells remained poorly clonogenic (Figure S5D).
Single-Cell Transcriptomics Identify a Subpopulation of
Lgr5-High Cells Enriched in the Mex3a Signature
The finding that a subset of Lgr5-high cells expresses Mex3a and
that Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high cells display slow proliferation ki-
netics implies heterogeneity of the ISC pool. Our data contrast
with a recent single-cell transcriptomic analysis of Lgr5-high
cells (Gr€
un et al., 2015) that concluded that this population is
largely homogeneous. Indeed, we reanalyzed the dataset from
Gr€
un et al. (2015) and failed to identify an obvious Lgr5+ subpop-
ulation expressing the Mex3a-specific signature. We, however,
reasoned that this negative result might simply be due to under-
representation of the Mex3a population because the dataset
from Gr€
un et al. (2015) contained sequences of only 53 individual
Lgr5-high cells at a relatively low coverage (mean of 0.4 million
reads/cell). Therefore, we set out to generate transcriptomic
data for a larger number of Lgr5-high cells at a higher sequencing
depth. To this end, the top 25% of the brightest Lgr5-GFP+ cells
from the small intestine were isolated and loaded into a high-
throughput microfluidic chip. We generated single-cell transcrip-
tomic profiles by RNA sequencing of 400 capture sites. Subse-
quently, we excluded both empty capture sites and sites that
contained visually identified cell doublets. Additionally, we
applied stringent quality control filters to further discard cells
showing either low-quality sequencing data or transcript distri-
butions that scored with an elevated probability of belonging
to cell aggregates (see STAR Methods for details). The final
high-quality dataset contained 245 individual Lgr5-high cells
sequenced at an average of 1.8 million reads/cell (Figure 6A).
We identified unique transcripts (using unique molecular identi-
fiers [UMIs]) and assessed cell population distribution using
principal-component analysis (PCA). Unsupervised analysis
grouped Lgr5-high cells into two well defined clusters. Clusters
1 and 2 contained 140 and 105 Lgr5-high cells, respectively (Fig-
ure 6B). The optimal cluster number was not affected by
coverage, as shown by downsampling analysis (Figure S6A),
but a reduction of cell numbers below 50% precluded the iden-
tification of the two Lgr5-high cell populations (Figure S6B). We
estimated that the classification (out-of-bag) error of cells into
the two predefined cell clusters increased upon downsampling
of the number of reads per cell below 20% (Figure S6C). Analysis
of the dataset based on t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (tSNE) also grouped Lgr5-high cells in two clusters
(Figures S6E–S6G). Thus, a minimal number of cells with suffi-
cient coverage is required to identify heterogeneity within the
Lgr5-high cell population.
The ISC-specific genes Lgr5, Smoc2, Olfm4, and Axin2 were
expressed at equal levels in clusters 1 and 2 (Figure 6C). Further-
more, the average level of the Lgr5-GFP-high specific gene
expression signature was equivalent in the two clusters (Fig-
ure 6D; Figure S6E). Therefore, both clusters 1 and 2 contain
bona fide Lgr5-high cells. Lowly expressed genes such as
Mex3a, Tert, or Dll1 were captured with very low coverage in
our dataset (i.e., an average of 0.24, 0.06, and 0.47 UMIs/cell
respectively), which precluded reaching reliable conclusions
about their expression pattern. However, we found that the
Mex3a-high signature was largely upregulated in cells belonging
to cluster 2 (Figure 6E; Figure S6F). Genes upregulated in
Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high cells compared with Mex3a-neg/Lgr5-
high cells were also enriched in cluster 2 (Table S6; Figure S6H).
We found no correlation between expression levels of Lgr5-high
and Mex3a-high signatures (Figure 6F).
The above data imply that cluster 2 contains Lgr5-high cells that
express the gene program characteristics of Mex3a-high cells.
Additionally, the PCA plots showed that the Mex3a gene program
was expressed in a graded manner; this is, it increased as cells
from cluster 2 separated from cluster 1 along principal component
1 (PC1). We found that the graded expression of the Mex3a pro-
gram correlated inversely with a signature characteristic of
Ki67+ crypt cells (correlation coefficient [corr], �0.38; p value,
7.8 3 10�10) (Figures 6G and 6H) obtained from Ki67-RFP knockin
mice (Table S6; Basak et al., 2014), which is enriched in genes
required for mitosis and progression through the cell cycle.
Indeed, clusters 1 and 2 in the PCA and tSNE plots differed in
the expressionlevels ofthe Ki67 signature (Figure 6G; Figure S6G).
Therefore, as Lgr5-high cells become progressively Mex3a-posi-
tive, they lowered the expression of the proliferation program.

 Finally, a recent study has identified a subset of Lgr5-high cells
characterized by incipient expression of makers of both of
absorptive and secretory lineages. It was proposed that these
‘‘primed’’ Lgr5-high cells, termed intestinal bipotent progenitors
(IBPs), may represent ISCs undertaking the first step toward dif-
ferentiation before commitment to either lineage (Kim et al.,
2016). We used genes enriched in IBPs to identify this population
in our dataset and confirmed that a fraction of Lgr5-high cells
expressed markers of both absorptive and secretory lineages.
IBP-like cells were present in both clusters 1 and 2, and, there-
fore, they did not represent a main source of cell heterogeneity
in the PCA (Figure S6I).
Mex3a-Expressing Cells Are Resistant to Both
Chemotherapy and g Radiation
Standard chemotherapy and g radiation treatments are aimed at
killing rapidly dividing cells. A main example is 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), which blocks thymidine synthesis, thus impeding DNA
replication. g Radiation induces double-strand breaks in all cell
types, albeit with higher toxicity in highly proliferative cells.
Consistent with this notion, treatment of mice with both high-
dose 5-FU and ionizing radiation (IR) significantly reduced the
Lgr5-high cell population (Figures 7A and 7B; Figure S7A). In
contrast, the frequency of Mex3a-high cells increased upon
treatment (Figures 7A and 7B; Figure S7B). Analysis of com-
pound Mex3aTom/+; Lgr5GFP/+ mice showed that Mex3a-high/
Lgr5-high cells were more resistant to 5-FU and IR than Lgr5-
high/Mex3a-low and Lgr5-high/Mex3a-neg cells (Figures 7C
and 7D). Mex3a expression also segregated Lgr5-low cells ac-
cording to their sensitivity to 5-FU and IR. These experiments
also showed that Lgr5-low/Mex3a-neg cells, which represent
the bulk of the transient amplifying compartment, were highly
sensitive to these insults, whereas the relative numbers of
Lgr5-low/Mex3a-high and Lgr5-low/Mex3a-low cells increased
upon treatment (Figures 7C and 7E). Therefore, the majority of
Lgr5-high and Lgr5-low cells that resisted 5-FU expressed
Mex3a. Because we assessed cell numbers 48 hr after treat-
ment, the observed frequencies likely reflect relative survival
rates rather than proliferation and subsequent expansions of
each subpopulation.
We next studied the contribution of Mex3a-high cells to tissue
renewal upon chemotherapy by mapping their fate using lineage
tracing analysis. We did not find significant differences in clone
size or numbers at early time points of treatment (Figures S7C
and S7D). Importantly, 1 week after 5-FU treatment, Mex3a+
cells produced larger clones, including 10% of ribbons that
were never present in untreated mice at this time point (Figures
7F and 7G). All clones produced in control or 5-FU-treated
Mex3aTom/+ mice arose from the +3/+4 crypt region, except for
ribbons that started below within the crypt base (Figure S7E).
Two weeks after 5-FU treatment, the percentage of crypt
base-to-villus ribbons generated by Mex3a-high cells increased
by more than 2-fold compared with controls (Figure 7G). These
patterns fit well with the notion that Mex3a-high cells are not
only relatively resistant to chemotherapy but also contribute to
regeneration of the rapidly proliferating ISC pool after damage.
DISCUSSION
The features and behavior of Mex3a+ cells are unique among
other previously characterized crypt cell populations. Mex3a-
high cells resemble Lgr5+ crypt base columnar cells in that
they express high levels of WNT-driven ISC-specific genes.
However, the progeny of Mex3a-high cells originates largely
from the +3/+4 crypt region and is substantially less abundant
than that produced by the bulk Lgr5+ cell population during
equivalent periods. Mex3a+ cells generate multilineage progeny,
and, therefore, they do not represent progenitors committed to
particular lineages. Dll1, Dclk1, Ngn3, or Alpi mark short-lived
progenitor cells that differentiate toward particular lineages
(Nakanishi et al., 2013; van Es et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2007).
None of these populations contribute long-term to renewal of
the epithelium under homeostatic conditions. In contrast, a large
fraction of the Mex3a population is recalled to the ISC pool and
regenerates the epithelium over months.
Mex3a-high cells display features reminiscent of crypt LRCs,
originally identified by Potten et al. (1978) and later characterized
by Buczacki et al. (2013). The observation that the H2B-YFP
mark that accumulates in LRCs is inherited by enteroendocrine
and Paneth cells led to the proposal that these cells are precur-
sors of these secretory lineages (Buczacki et al., 2013). Experi-
ments of lineage-tracing using a bipartite Cre recombinase in
which the enzyme is reconstituted only in label-retaining cells
indicated that this cell population does not retain clonogenic
capacity in homeostasis (Buczacki et al., 2013). Similarly to
LRCs, Mex3a-high cells accumulate nucleotide analogs as a
result of their low proliferation rates and display incipient expres-
sion of Paneth cell markers. However, Mex3a-derived clones
contain a larger proportion of absorptive cells, which reflects
the greater abundance of this cell type in the small intestine,
and, therefore, Mex3a+ progeny is not biased toward the secre-
tory lineage. More importantly, unlike the LRCs described by
Buczacki et al., 2013, Mex3a-high cells or their progeny produce
ribbon clones under homeostatic conditions, implying long-term
clonogenic potential. The reasons for the discrepancy between
the behavior of H2B-YFP-retaining cells reported in the previous
study (Buczacki et al., 2013) and that of the Mex3a-high cells
described here are unclear but indicate that these two popula-
tions are not completely overlapping. A potential confounding
effect is the fact that Mex3a-high cells include both Lgr5-high

 and Lgr5-low populations. Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high cells express
the ISC/WNT program and are highly clonogenic ex vivo. In
contrast, Mex3a-high/Lgr5-low cells are characterized by higher
levels of enteroendocrine and tuft cell genes and give rise to or-
ganoids with very low efficiency. We thus speculate that lineage
tracing from the bipartite cre/H2B present in the previous study
(Buczacki et al., 2013) may largely reflect the behavior of the
Mex3a-high/Lgr5-low population. Testing this hypothesis will
require the generation of genetic tools that enable fate mapping
from each of these two populations.
Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed a previously unan-
ticipated heterogeneity of the Lgr5-high cell pool. Our data indi-
cate that two classes of Lgr5-high cells co-exist within the crypt
base. Both are marked by genes that define canonical ISCs,
whereas cluster 2 cells are enriched in the gene program specific
to Mex3a+ cells. The average expression of the Mex3a signature
is anti-correlated with that of Ki67+ progenitor cells, an observa-
tion that fits well with the limited cellular output generated by
Mex3a+ cells in lineage tracing experiments. Nevertheless, the
Ki67 program is not fully silenced in cluster 2 cells, which is in
agreement with Lgr5-high/Mex3a-high cells being slow-prolifer-
ating rather than fully quiescent. Thus, single-cell expression
data reflect, to a large extent, rapid versus slow proliferative
states adopted by ISCs. Based on the graded levels of the
Mex3a-specific gene signature across cluster 2 cells, we specu-
late that some cluster 1 cells may progressively acquire the
slowly dividing Mex3a+ phenotype. Because the Lgr5-driven
creERT2 marks both rapid and slowly proliferating ISCs, lineage
tracing of alleles specific to cluster 1 cells will be required to track
conversion between these two states.
It is important to consider that, as a consequence of their lower
division rates, Mex3a-high cells have a modest contribution to
sustaining the renewal of the epithelium under homeostatic con-
ditions. According to the lineage tracing experiments, individual
cells and small clones derived from Mex3a-high cells last about
2–3 weeks, suggesting that this is the approximate lifespan of the
Mex3a-high cell population. These data fit well with the possibil-
ity that slowly proliferating Mex3a-high cells are continuously
displaced by the rapidly dividing ISCs as a result of the neutral
competition dynamics that drive renewal of the intestinal epithe-
lium (Snippert et al., 2010). An alternative explanation for the long
residence time of Mex3a-derived clones in crypts would be that,
over a period of 2 weeks, Mex3a+ cells keep producing new
progeny, which is observed as individual cells or small cell clones
at each experimental time point. Importantly, a fraction of
Mex3a-derived cells is converted to rapidly proliferating ISCs,
as shown by the emergence of crypt base-to-villus clones (‘‘rib-
bons’’) in 2-week tracing experiments. The fact that we never
observed ribbon-like clones before this period implies that
Mex3a-driven creERT2 does not initially mark fast-dividing ISCs.
Finally, Mex3a cells are largely resistant to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy compared with bulk Lgr5+ ISCs (Tao et al., 2015).
This property is likely a consequence of their relatively slow
proliferation rates. In addition, the observation that isolated
Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high cells display enhanced organoid forma-
tion capacity may suggest that this cell population adapts partic-
ularly well to stress conditions such as those present in ex vivo
cultures. We show that, upon 5-FU treatment, the rate of conver-
sion of Mex3a-high cells to ISCs is exacerbated. Mounting
evidence indicates that Dll1+ secretory progenitors (van Es
et al., 2012) and even differentiated enterocytes (Tetteh et al.,
2016) exhibit plasticity and regain stemness upon depletion of
the Lgr5+ pool. However, we argue that reversion of differenti-
ated cells to a stem cell state is probably a rare event that
does not contribute substantially to regeneration of the epithe-
lium after chemotherapy or radiation. Indeed, Metcalfe et al.
(2014) demonstrated that the Lgr5+ cell population is necessary
to regenerate the epithelium upon irradiation. Our experiments
show that chemotherapy and radiation preferentially eliminate
the Mex3a-neg/Lgr5-low cell population, which contains the
bulk of transient amplifying cells in the crypt. In contrast, the
Mex3a+ cell population continues to generate progeny immedi-
ately after 5-FU treatment. Under these conditions, about 40% of
Mex3a-high cells produce ribbon-like clones, implying that a
large proportion contributes to generate the compartment of
fast-dividing Lgr5+ ISCs. Given the fact that Mex3a-high/Lgr5-
low cells show little clonogenic capacity in ex vivo assays, we
favor
the
idea
that
resilient
Mex3a-high/Lgr5-high
cells
contribute the most to regeneration after damage. Therefore,
Mex3a-high cells represent a reservoir of slow-dividing chemo-
therapy- and radiotherapy-resistant Lgr5+ cells.

Mex3atm1(tdTomato-T2A-CreERT2)EBa were generated at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) Barcelona. Lgr5tm1(cre/ERT2)Cle
mice have been previously described (Barker et al., 2007) and were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Hans Clevers. Tg(Cyp1a1-
H2B-YFP)Dwi mice have been previously described (Buczacki et al., 2013) and were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Douglas J
Winton. Reporter strains Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo and Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor have been previously described (Mu-
zumdar et al., 2007; Soriano, 1999), and were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Mex3a reporter mice were used to identify
the population within the mouse small intestine that expresses this gene. To assess their proliferation rate, lineage tracing and overlap
with the small intestine Lgr5 population, Mex3a mice were crossed with the different models described above. For these in vivo
experiments, age and sex-matched littermates were always used, with n > 3 mice in all experiments (detailed description and number
of mice are detailed in the respective figure legends and Method Details).
METHOD DETAILS
Analysis of ISC signatures
To identify robust ISC genes we compared three lists of ISC expression signatures derived from mouse and small intestine
populations. We overlapped the expression profile of three different ISC signatures: The first is the small intestine Lgr5-GFP-hi signa-
ture (GEO dataset: GSE36497) (Mun
˜ oz et al., 2012), which is defined as those genes enriched in Lgr5-high compared to Lgr5-low
cells in both Agilent and Affymetrix platforms (Fold change > 2, p value < 0.05). The second is the previously characterized human
EPHB2 derived signature (Jung et al., 2011), which is defined by those genes enriched in EPHB2-high cells in a graded manner (i.e.,
EPHB2-high > EPHB2-med > EPHB2-low. Fold chage > 2, p value < 0.05). The third signature is obtained from mouse colon
Lgr5-GFP cells defined as follows those genes enriched over 2.5 fold in Lgr5-GFP-high compared to Lgr5-GFPlow cells (no p value
was used as cut-off). Consistent ISC genes were those present in all signatures (Table S1).
Generation of the Mex3a reporter allele
A cassette bearing a tdTomato/T2A/Cre-ERT2/bGH polyA was inserted in frame with the Mex3a start codon in exon 1. The targeting
vector was generated by Genebridges. The vector was verified by restriction enzyme digestion as well as sequencing. The vector was
electroporated into W4 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and stably transfected cells were selected with G418. After this, single
colonies were picked and triplicate plates were generated of resistant clones. The clones were then screened by long range PCR by
using the SequalPrep Kit (Invitrogen). Positive clones were then expanded and further analyzed by Southern Blot (as described in
(Barker et al., 2007)) to assure correct and unique genomic integration. The clones verified by Southern blot were then transfected
with an FlpO-bearing plasmid to remove the Neomycin resistance. Single clones were picked and screened by PCR for recombina-
tion and presence of the reporter cassette. Positive clones were then expanded and analyzed by Southern once again to ensure the

 appropriate integration of the cassette, as well as to independently confirm the deletion of the Neomycin resistance cassette. Finally,
positive clones were selected and blastocyst injection was done to generate chimeras. The chimeras with successful germline
transmission were bred with C57Bl6 mice and the offspring was used to generate the final mouse colonies. mESC culture, blastocyst
injection of selected clones and generation of chimeras were conducted in the Mouse Mutant Core Facility of IRB Barcelona following
institutional guidelines. See Table S7 for genotyping primers.
Mouse models
Lgr5tm1(cre/ERT2)Cle mice have been previously described (Barker et al., 2007) and were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Hans
Clevers. Tg(Cyp1a1-H2B-YFP)Dwi mice have been previously described (Buczacki et al., 2013) and were obtained from the
laboratory of Dr. Douglas J Winton. Reporter strains Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo and Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor have
been previously described (Muzumdar et al., 2007; Soriano, 1999), and were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were
housed and bred according to IRB Barcelona and PCB institutional guidelines.
Lineage tracing
Rationale
For lineage tracing in the Mex3aTom/+ we used CAG-driven mTmG cassette inserted in the ROSA26 locus. We used this model due to
the high sensitivity of this allele, which allows the identification of very low number of recombination events. In the case of Lgr5GFP/+
model, we turned to the ROSA26 lox-stop-lox LacZ model since the Lgr5-driven GFP would be confounded with the recombination of
the ROSA26mTmG cassette.
Dosage
For lineage tracing experiments in the Mex3aTom/+ model, mice were injected with two consecutive intraperitoneal doses of tamoxifen
(20 mg/kg, Sigma). For early time points (i.e., 36 hr), mice were treated with a single dose of 4-OH tamoxifen (5 mg/kg, Sigma). For
lineage tracing from the Lgr5GFP/+ model, 1 dose of diluted Tamoxifen (2 mg/kg) was used to ensure tracing from single cell condi-
tions. The time of tracing is referred to the first dose of Tamoxifen.
Clone identification
In the case of Mex3aTom/+ mice, the presence of tdTomato in the mTmG cassette is confounded with the Mex3a-driven tdTomato.
Thus for all lineage tracing experiments, intestines were stained to detect GFP+ cells by either IHC or immunofluorescence (IF)
without considering the tdTomato signal. In the case of Lgr5-driven tracing, intestines were stained to detect b-galactosidase activity.
(See below for the protocols used for staining).
Time points for tracing
Clone scoring was performed at 36 hr (n = 11 mice), 3 days (n = 6 mice), 7 days (n = 12 mice), 14 days (n = 9 mice), 21 days (n = 4 mice),
28 days (n = 4 mice) and after 6 months (n = 3 mice) for Mex3a-driven lineage tracing. Lgr5-driven lineage tracing was assessed at
36 hr (n = 3 mice) and 7 days (n = 3 mice). At least 5 independent sections were stained per mouse and clones were scored according
to their size and position (see below). For tracing after 5-FU treatment, clone scoring was performed at 3 days (n = 4 mice), 7 days
(n = 6 mice) and 14 days (n = 8 mice) after the final dose of Tam.
Clone scoring
Position
GFP+ or LacZ+ clones were scored for their position in three categories: crypt base (crypt position +1/+2); suprabasal (crypt
position +3/+4) and ‘‘crypt top or villus’’ (clone outside of the crypt base). Clone position was only assessed when clones
were unequivocally localized in each of these compartments (i.e., clones spanning crypts and villi were discarded from the
analysis.)
Size
GFP+ or LacZ+ clone size was estimated by counting the number of cells. Clones were then classified as single cells, two-cell clones,
small clones (3-20 cells), large clones (> 20 cells) and ribbons. Clones were scored as ribbons only when GFP+ or LacZ+ cells were
present both at the crypt base (position +1/+2) and up to the tip of the villus in the section analyzed.
CBC clone number
Number of crypt-base columnar cells were assessed in clones localized at the crypt base where the orientation of the crypt allowed
assessment of CBC positions from +1 to +4. Since we focused on sections were we could observe the crypt-villus axis, the maximum
number was 8 CBCs per crypt.
Lineage bias
In order to analyze potential differentiation bias of the Mex3a population, 7 day clones were co-stained for GFP and either absorptive
(ANPEP) or a pan-secretory antibody mix (CHGA, DCLK1, LYZ1, MUC2). The 7 day tracing time was chosen because it has the
highest diversity in terms of clone position and clone size.
In vivo treatments
Cyp1a1::H2B-YFP pulse chase experiments: Transgenic mice bearing the Cyp1a1::H2B-YFP allele were given 3 intraperitoneal
doses of b-napthoflavone (80 mg/kg, Sigma) over a 36 hr period to induce activity of the Cyp1a1 promoter and mark intestinal cells

 with H2B-YFP as previously described (Buczacki et al., 2013). After 10 days, intestines were dissociated and stained for EPHB2 (see
below for detailed staining protocol). EPHB2-high cells that retained H2B-YFP mark were quantified 10 days after the initial dose by
flow cytometry (Buczacki et al., 2013).
Label retention assay: For EdU label-retention, Mex3aTom/+ mice were treated with 3 intraperitoneal doses (1 mg/25 g, Life tech-
nologies) in a 36 hr period and analyzed 10 days after the final dose.
5-FU and IR treatments: Damage to the intestinal epithelium was done by injecting two intraperitoneal doses of 5-fluorouracil
(100 mg/kg, Sigma) over a 48h period or 12 Gy of g-radiation from a Cs source. For FACS of single and compound reporters, intestinal
cells were analyzed 48h after the last 5-FU dose. For FACS analysis 4-5 mice (age and sex-matched littermates) were analyzed per
group. Treatments were randomized but no blinding was incorporated. For lineage tracing experiments mice were injected with
tamoxifen, treated with 5-FU (100 mg/kg, Sigma) and analyzed at 3, 7 or 14 days after the first dose of Tamoxifen (refer to lineage
tracing section for exact number of clones and mice analyzed per time point).
Crypt purification and staining
Intestinal crypt cells were purified as previously described (Merlos-Sua
´ rez et al., 2011). Proximal small intestines (duodenum and
jejunum) were dissected from age and sex-matched mice and cut open longitudinally. They were later incubated with HBSS
EDTA (8 mM) for 5 min at room temperature. After this incubation, intestines were shaken vigorously to remove villi and the first
supernatant was discarded. The intestines were then incubated with HBSS EDTA on ice for 15 min, after which shaking was
repeated. This yielded the first crypt fraction. This process was repeated twice and after microscopic inspection of the samples
the fractions enriched in crypts were kept (usually fractions 2 and 3). These fractions were then pooled together for each mouse,
centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min (4�C) and filtered through a 70 mm mesh (BD Biosciences) to further remove villi. Filtered fractions
were enzymatically disaggregated by adding dispase (0.4 mg/mL, GIBCO) and incubated for 20 min at 37�C. The media was then
supplemented with 5% FBS (GIBCO) to neutralize dispase and the samples were filtered through a 40 mm mesh. For intestinal
LRC analysis in compound reporter mice, single cells were stained with an APC-conjugated antibody raised against EphB2 (Clone
mAb 2H9, 6 mg/mL, BD). Cells were stained with DAPI (1 mg/mL, Sigma Aldrich) to exclude dead cells. The single-cell preparations of
small intestinal crypts were analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACS Aria 2.0 (BD). Data was analyzed with FACSDiva software (BD) or
FlowJo for EdU retention assays.
Population gating rationale
To define subpopulations with the reporter mice we used the following criteria: for the Mex3a reporter allele, Tomato-high cells
were defined as the top 20% brightest cells within the Tomato+ population. For the Lgr5 reporter allele, GFP-high cells were
defined as the top 25% of the GFP+ population. For compound reporter mice, only the GFP+ population was analyzed due to
mosaicism of the Lgr5-GFP allele and Mex3a gates were defined within the Lgr5-GFP high and Lgr5-GFP low populations. For
all experiments a Mex3a+/+ mouse was processed in parallel to set the sorting gates in both single and compound reporter
FACS experiments.
In vitro organoid growth
Compound Mex3a / Lgr5 reporter mice were used to isolate the populations expressing different levels of Mex3a and Lgr5. As
described above, these experiments were done by gating the Lgr5::GFP+ cells and isolating single cells from the respective
Mex3a-high, Mex3a-low and Mex3a-neg cells within both Lgr5-high and Lgr5-low populations. 4500 cells of each population
were sorted into organoid growth media (Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with Glutamax, HEPES, B27, recombinant EGF
(50 ng/mL), recombinant NOGGIN (100 ng/mL), recombinant RSPO1 (500 ng/mL) and Y27632 (10 mM). Sorted cells from each
population were seeded in three independent Matrigel drops (1500 cells/drop). Media was changed every 48 hr and organoid
formation was quantified 10 days after seeding. To assess organoid formation in stem cell conditions, CHIR99021 (3 mm) and
Valproic acid (1 mM) were added to the cultures. To test the self-renewal of Mex3a-high Lgr5-high cells, established organoids
were serially passaged in Matrigel every 7 days and kept in culture for over 8 passages. To test for multipotency, Mex3a-high
Lgr5-high derived organoids were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Sections were then stained for EPHB2, LYZ1,
CHGA, ANPEP, MUC2 and DCLK1 with standard IF protocols (see below for details and refer to Table S7 for antibodies and con-
centrations used).
RT qPCR analysis
RNA was extracted from sorted cells by using the Trizol Reagent (Life technologies) following manufacturer’s instructions. The only
modification was the addition of glycogen (40 ng/mL, Roche) to the aqueous phase to visualize the RNA pellet after precipitation. RNA
was quantified using a Nanodrop and cDNA was produced with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems) following manufacturer’s instructions. For experiments with low cellular yield, cells were directly sorted on lysis buffer
and subjected to cDNA amplification as previously described (Gonzalez-Roca et al., 2010). To assess changes in expression of
selected genes RT-qPCR was done with their respective TaqMan probes or primers for SYBR Green. For TaqMan assays the
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used. In the case of SYBR Green reactions the Power SYBR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used. To calculate gene expression to a normalization gene the comparative threshold cycle method
was used. See Table S7 for a list of Taqman assays and SYBR primers used.

 GO Analysis
A signature for Mex3a-high cells was derived by filtering genes differentially expressed with a p value < 0.05 and a fold change > 2 fold
compared to Mex3a-low cells. The previously defined Lgr5 mRNA cell signature (Mun
˜ oz et al., 2012) was used. These signatures
were then analyzed with the DAVID analysis platform and the GO biological process enrichment was retrieved for each signature
(Huang et al., 2009).
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue fixation
Intestines were processed and cut longitudinally to expose villi. They were fixed in formalin for 24h at room temperature and later
processed for paraffin embedding as previously described (Merlos-Sua
´ rez et al., 2011).
Tissue staining
Paraffin sections were processed for standard histological staining as previously described (Merlos-Sua
´ rez et al., 2011). Antibody
concentrations for IHC are shown in Table S7. For the detection of tdTomato by immunofluorescence (IF), primary anti tdTomato
antibody was incubated overnight at room temperature followed by an incubation with HRP-coupled polymer (Envision+). After
this incubation, a tyramide-biotin conjugation was performed and later stained with streptavidin-Alexa532 following manufacturer’s
instructions (Perkin Elmer). b-galactosidase staining was performed as previously described (Barker et al., 2007).
GSEA Analysis
We ranked all genes measured in Mex3a-high and Mex3a-low cells by microarrays according to differential expression between the
two populations. We then assessed the enrichment of the LRC signature (LRC genes > 2 fold, p value < 0.05 when compared to both
Paneth and crypt cycling cells. For details refer to Table S4) between phenotypes against the ranked file using GSEA. To validate the
statistical relevance of the enrichment, the enrichment score of 1000 random signatures of matching size was computed and
compared to the signature of interest. GSEA analysis was performed using the implementation from the Broad Institute (Merlos-
Sua
´ rez et al., 2011; Subramanian et al., 2005).
In situ hybridization
Single-molecule in situ hybridization was performed using Advanced Cell Diagnostics RNAscope 2.5 HD detection kit (REF 322360)
with a probe against Mex3a RNA (REF 318531). Small intestines from 4-month old mice were formalin fixed for 24 hr, paraffin-
embedded and cut into 5-micron thick slices. The single-molecule ISH protocol was followed according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions with the following modifications: 1) after deparafinization and rehydration, tissue was fixed in 10% formaldehyde/PBS for 16 hr
prior to pretreatment steps, 2) protease treatment for 20 min, and 3) Amp5 incubation for 20 min. Images were acquired with an
Olympus BX43 upright microscope and DP73 color camera.
Transcriptomic analysis
25 ng of RNA from sorted cells were used to hybridize mouse M430 PM strip microarrays (Affymetrix). For Lgr5 colon cells, a pool of
proximal colon epithelium from 5 different mice was used to obtain the necessary material. In the case of Mex3a and Mex3a/Lgr5
populations, proximal small intestine epithelium was used. All samples were age and sex matched. Affymetrix arrays were normalized
using RMA background correction and summarization (Irizarry et al., 2003) as implemented in the ‘‘affyPLM’’ package from the R
statistical framework. Annotations for the ‘‘HT-430_PM’’ array version na34 were downloaded from Affymetrix. Technical metrics
capturing RNA degradation, array saturation, noise floor and quantity of starting material were computed for each sample as
described in (Eklund and Szallasi, 2008). All samples passed quality controls. A linear model was fitted to find differentially expressed
genes between conditions of interest with technical metrics and scan strip as covariates. The ‘‘lmFit’’ function from the ‘‘limma’’ pack-
age (Ritchie et al., 2015) was used for fitting the model.
Single cell RNA sequencing
A single cell preparation from the small intestine of Lgr5 GFP/+ mice was obtained as described above. After stringent gating, the top
25% of GFP+ cells were collected. Isolation of single cells (400 capture sites), cDNA synthesis and amplification were performed on
the C1 mRNA Seq HT IFCs medium chip (10-17 mm) (Fluidigm) with the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit (Clonetech). Spike-in artificial
transcripts (ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix, Ambion) from The External RNA Controls Consortium were added during sample preparation as
internal control to support subsequent quality control steps (Baker et al., 2005). Quantity and quality of cDNA were assessed with a
High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were generated by Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and
sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) using 100-bp mode of Truseq Rapid SBS kit v2. Sequencing was carried out as paired-end
reads. Read one (12 bp) contained cell and unique molecular barcodes (Islam et al., 2014; Kivioja et al., 2011); read two (85 bp) con-
tained the transcript sequence. Primary data analysis was carried out with the standard Illumina pipeline.
Fluidigm C1 HT-Seq technology includes a two-level indexing system, which allows the multiplexed sequencing of multiple single
cells and library pools. Here, we processed 10 libraries (up to 40 cells per library) of Lgr5-high cells, with a total number of
546,853,233 reads. Quality check was performed with FastQC quality control suite. All samples reached the quality standards
and were processed to deconvolute reads by demultiplexing library and cell barcodes. Prior to mapping, reads were filtered for

e5
 poly-T sequences. Then, reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome GRCm38.p4 (Cunningham et al., 2015) using Gencode
M8 annotations (Mudge and Harrow, 2015) with the GEMTools 1.7.0 RNASeq pipeline (Marco-Sola et al., 2012). In-house scripts
were used for gene expression quantification based on molecular identifiers. ERCC spike-ins were mapped and quantified in parallel.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
General experimental design
For all experiments n represents the number of independent biological replicates. In mice experiments, all groups consisted of age
and sex-matched littermates. No blinding nor sample-size estimations were incorporated to the experimental setup and all data
points were included in the analyses (i.e., no exclusion criteria was used). For the experiments of 5-FU and IR treatments, mice
were randomized.
General statistical analysis
Graphs and statistical analysis for Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were done with GraphPad Prism 7.0. In these figures n indicates the
number of biological replicates (populations obtained from independent mice). For Figures 2F and 2H, significant differences
were assessed by a t test. For Figure 7B, a one-way ANOVA was used followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test. For Figures
5F and 7D, a two-way ANOVA was used followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Asterisks in figures indicate the following:
*, p value < 0.05; **, p value < 0.01; ***, p value < 0.001. n.s., p value > 0.05.
Single cell transcriptomic analysis
Filtering and preprocessing of SCS data
Cells with a percentage of reads aligning to spikes larger than 40% and exon percentage lower than 30% were removed from the
dataset. 10 out of 400 cells were filtered by this criterion.
The gene expression y for a cell with vector of UMI counts x was computed as
y = log 2
�
ðx + 1Þ
sumðx + 1Þ � 1e6
�
and quantile normalization was applied to the resulting matrix. The expression matrix was further filtered by removing genes with
expression in less than 4 cells and cells with less than 1000 genes expressed. The minimum expression was set at 4.5.
Doublets and empty wells were detected by visual inspection of microscopy images (81 doublets and 24 empty). In order to remove
any undetected doublet we performed unsupervised clustering and looked for clusters enriched in these categories. First, tSNE
coordinates (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) were computed without removing any artifact and clusters were found using Normal
Mixture Modeling as implemented in the R package ‘‘Mclust’’ with default parameters and variable number of clusters. For each clus-
ter we computed the median of the classification uncertainty for empty and non-empty cells. Clusters for which this value for empty
cells was lower than for non-empty cells were classified as enriched (3 out of 7 clusters). All cells belonging to this cluster with cer-
tainty larger than 0.95 were marked as empty wells (65 of 390).
A similar approach was followed to remove doublets: starting with the dataset without low quality or empty cells, clusters were
found and defined to be enriched in doublets with the same criterion as before except that clusters were only considered to be
enriched if they contained more than 8% of cells marked as doublets. 2 out of 7 clusters were classified as enriched and 55 cells
were removed from the dataset.
Analysis of final dataset
The final dataset consisted of 245 cells after removing visually detected and predicted artifacts. The mean number of UMIs per cell
was 31630 (min = 4459, median = 25920 and max = 70040). Count data was normalized as described before and principal compo-
nents were computed using the most variable and expressed genes (top 11% of genes according to the median absolute deviation
and mean expression). For plotting of the dataset, dimension reduction was performed through tSNE using the ‘‘Seurat’’ R package
(Satija et al., 2015). In order to detect possible heterogeneity in the data, clustering was computed on the first 3 principal components
or in the tSNE coordinates accordingly. The optimal number of clusters was decided according to the Bayesian Information Criterion
for expectation-maximization as implemented in the Mclust function. 2 clusters were found in both PCA and tSNE analysis. For PCA
analysis, clusters 1 and 2 were of sizes 140 and 105 cells respectively. For tSNE analysis, clusters 1 and 2 were of 165 and 80 cells
respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) as implemented in (Subramanian et al., 2005) was performed on ranked lists by
fold change of expression between clusters. Fold changes and p value for differential expression were computed with a bimodal
model as implemented in the function ‘‘find.markers’’ from the R package Seurat.
Robustness analysis of clusters
Downsampling of the total number of UMIs per cell was performed in order to investigate the robustness of the resulting clusters.
Datasets were simulated 20 times for total number of UMIs ranging from 10 to 90% of the original value. Unsupervised clustering
was repeated as with the original data and the number of clusters and expression was stored. The number of clusters remained rela-
tively constant for all simulations (Figure S6A). A random forest classifier was fitted to the simulated data and original cluster labels.
The number of individuals may be important for cluster discovery therefore we downsampled our dataset choosing subsets of cells

 and repeating the process. We found that with fewer than 50% of the cells the second cluster was lost in half of the simulations and
almost completely with 30% of the cells (Figure S6B). The out of bag error of classification is depicted (Figures S6C and S6D),
showing that most cells are correctly classified even with 10% of reads or cells analyzed.
