Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology
(ACR) are intended to provide guidance for particular patterns of practice and not to dictate the care of a
particular patient. The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations within this guideline to be volun-
tary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in light of
each patient’s individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote benefi-
cial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations
developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medi-
cal knowledge, technology, and practice. ACR recommendations are not intended to dictate payment or
insurance decisions. These recommendations cannot adequately convey all uncertainties and nuances of
patient care.

 Objective. This collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology and the American Association of Hip
and Knee Surgeons developed an evidence-based guideline for the perioperative management of antirheumatic drug
therapy for adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA) including ankylosing spondylitis and psori-
atic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing elective total hip
(THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
Methods. A panel of rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons specializing in hip and knee arthroplasty, and meth-
odologists was convened to construct the key clinical questions to be answered in the guideline. A multi-step system-
atic literature review was then conducted, from which evidence was synthesized for continuing versus withholding
antirheumatic drug therapy and for optimal glucocorticoid management in the perioperative period. A Patient Panel
was convened to determine patient values and preferences, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations,
using a group consensus process through a convened Voting Panel of rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons. The
strength of the recommendation reflects the degree of certainty that benefits outweigh harms of the intervention, or
vice versa, considering the quality of available evidence and the variability in patient values and preferences.
Results. The guideline addresses the perioperative use of antirheumatic drug therapy including traditional disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologic agents, tofacitinib, and glucocorticoids in adults with RA, SpA, JIA, or SLE
who are undergoing elective THA or TKA. It provides recommendations regarding when to continue, when to with-
hold, and when to restart these medications, and the optimal perioperative dosing of glucocorticoids. The guideline
includes 7 recommendations, all of which are conditional and based on low- or moderate-quality evidence.
Conclusion. This guideline should help decision-making by clinicians and patients regarding perioperative antirheu-
matic medication management at the time of elective THA or TKA. These conditional recommendations reflect the
paucity of high-quality direct randomized controlled trial data.
INTRODUCTION
Although the wide utilization of disease-modifying antirheu-
matic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents has improved the
quality of life for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
spondyloarthritis (SpA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), or
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rates of total hip arthro-
plasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain high
(1–6). Patients with rheumatic conditions report significant
improvement in pain and function after THA or TKA, yet
critical outcomes such as infection, dislocation, and readmis-
sion are reported to be higher for patients with RA, SpA, or
SLE (7–10) compared to patients with osteoarthritis. At the
time of arthroplasty in a high-volume orthopedic hospital,
46% of RA patients were receiving biologic agents, 67%
were receiving nonbiologic DMARDs, and 25% were receiv-
ing glucocorticosteroids, while 75% of patients with SLE
were receiving immunosuppressive medications, and 15%
were receiving glucocorticosteroids. The optimal strategy
to manage these medications is not known (11–14). Inher-
ent risk factors for infection, such as overall disability and
disease activity/severity, may not be modifiable, but the
optimal perioperative management of immunosuppressant
therapy around the time of arthroplasty may present an
opportunity to mitigate risk (15–19).
In this setting, clinicians require guidance regarding
perioperative management of antirheumatic drug therapy.
Direct evidence, however, which addresses perioperative
management is sparse (20,21). To our knowledge, there
are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the
cessation and reintroduction of biologic agents at the time
of THA or TKA. The relevant outcomes considered for
these guidelines are the potential increase in infection
risk added by the medications versus the risk of disease

 flare when the medications are withheld. This guideline
pertains only to adult patients with RA, SpA including
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA),
JIA, or SLE, who are undergoing elective THA or TKA,
and incorporates patient preferences.
This guideline addresses management of antirheumatic
medication in those adult patients with diagnoses of RA,
SpA, JIA, or SLE, but is not limited to those who meet
classification criteria. This guideline is to be used for
those who have elected and have been deemed appropri-
ate candidates for THA or TKA. We would caution against
extrapolation of this guideline to other orthopedic proce-
dures until further data are available.
This guideline is intended for use by clinicians, includ-
ing orthopedists, rheumatologists, and other physicians
performing perioperative risk assessment and evaluation,
as well as patients. The guideline addresses common
clinical situations, but may not apply in all exceptional
or unusual situations. It is imperative that open and
informed communication between the patient, orthopedic
surgeon, and rheumatologist takes place. In addition,
while cost is a relevant factor in health care decisions, it
was not considered in this project.
The populations included in this guideline are shown
in Table 1 (22–24). Figure 1 contains a list of the drugs
included in the evaluation, along with their dosing inter-
vals, as the Panel determined that the dosing interval and
route were more relevant for this guideline because they
reflect the duration of effect.
This guideline does not address indications for THA or
TKA, medical decisions unrelated to antirheumatic drug
therapy, choice of implant, surgical approach, or perioper-
ative evaluation and management of concurrent disease,
such as that affecting the cervical spine of patients with
RA. Although patients with RA, SpA, JIA, or SLE should
be assessed for risk of venous thromboembolism and
major acute coronary event (8,25), this guideline does not
address cardiac risk assessment or perioperative venous
thromboembolism
prophylaxis;
both
are
covered
in
existing guidelines (26–29).

Guidelines-Disclosure-Summary.pdf). The full methods
are presented in Supplementary Appendix 1 (available

Using GRADE, a recommendation can be either in favor
of or against the proposed intervention and either strong
or conditional (31,32). Much of the evidence was indirect,
coming from nonsurgical studies, and all evidence was low
to moderate quality (33,34). A strong recommendation indi-
cates that most or almost all informed patients would choose
the recommended action. Conditional recommendations are
those in which the majority of the informed patients would
choose to follow the recommended course of action, but a
minority might not (35,36).
Teams
involved. This
project
was
a
collaboration
between the ACR and the American Association of Hip
and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS). All participating teams con-
tained representatives from both organizations, including
a Core Leadership Team for project oversight (5 members),
the Literature Review Team, who reviewed the literature
and compiled the literature report, the Expert Panel, who
helped frame the scope of the project, and the Voting
Panel (consisting of orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists,
an infectious disease expert, an SLE expert, patient repre-
sentatives, rheumatology methodologists, and a GRADE
expert), who determined the final recommendations (for a
complete listing of Panel and Team members see Supple-
mentary Appendix 2 [available on the Arthritis Care &
Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/
10.1002/acr.23274/abstract]). Additionally, a Patient
Panel consisting of 11 adults with RA or JIA, all of whom
had undergone THA or TKA, reviewed the evidence and
provided input on their values and preferences.
PICO
(population/intervention/comparator/outcomes)
question development and importance of outcomes. The
Core Leadership Team initially drafted the project scope,
key principles, and relevant clinical PICO questions,
which were then presented to the Expert Panel, the Voting
Panel, and the Literature Review Team for their review at
a face-to-face meeting where the project plan was defined.
The relevant topics addressed included: 1) Should anti-
rheumatic medications be withheld prior to elective THA/
TKA? 2) If they are withheld, when should they be
stopped? 3) If withheld, when should they be restarted
after surgery? 4) In patients receiving glucocorticoids,
what dose should be administered at the time of surgery?
The full list of PICO questions is shown in Supplementary
Appendix 3 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/
acr.23274/abstract).
Direct high-quality RCT data available comparing the
risk of THA or TKA in those receiving versus not receiving
the medications of interest, or comparing the background
risk of THA and TKA in the populations of interest, were
sparse. To address this gap, 2 questions were included
to inform the recommendations. The first asked, “What is
the background risk for serious adverse events including
infections, or hospitalization, associated with use of each
of
the
candidate
drugs
in
patients
not
undergoing
surgery?” The second question asked, “What is the back-
ground risk of adverse events associated with THA or
TKA, independent of use of candidate medications in the
populations of interest?” The group determined that both
superficial and deep surgical site infection (reported
within the first year after surgery), non–surgical site infec-
tion (within 90 days of surgery), and disease flare were the
most critical outcomes; other outcomes such as hospital
readmission, death, and long-term arthroplasty outcome
were also deemed relevant.
Systematic synthesis of the literature and evidence
processing. Systematic
literature
searches
were
per-
formed in Embase (searched since 1974), the Cochrane
Library, and PubMed (searched since the mid-1960s) from
January 1, 1980 through March 6, 2016. The search strate-
gies were developed using the controlled vocabulary or
thesauri language for each database: Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) for PubMed and Cochrane Library and
Emtree terms for Embase (see Supplementary Appendix
4, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site
at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23274/
abstract). Text words were used in PubMed and Embase,
and keyword/title/abstract words in the Cochrane Library.
Searches resulted in 2,230 total references (see Supple-
mentary Appendix 5, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/
10.1002/acr.23274/abstract). A final search update was
performed for the time period of January 1 to September 8,
2016, using the inclusive search terms of the disease
states, coupled separately with “arthroplasty”; no random-
ized trials were identified that were relevant to the guide-
line. DistillerSR software (http://systematic-review.net/)
was used to screen the literature search results grouped by
their match with the pertinent PICO questions.
The Literature Review Team analyzed and synthesized
data from eligible studies. Due to the lack of RCTs, we
were unable to prepare GRADE Summary of Findings
tables for most PICO questions. Microsoft Excel was used
for abstracting data from observational studies. When
available, the evidence summaries included the benefits
and harms for outcomes of interest across studies, the rela-
tive effect (with 95% confidence interval [95% CI]), the
number of participants, and the absolute effects. We rated
the quality of evidence for each critical and important out-
come as high, moderate, low, or very low quality, taking
into account limitations of study design (including the
risk of bias), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and
other considerations (including publication bias).
Moving from evidence to recommendations. The Patient
Panel attached far greater importance to infection at the
time of surgery than to flares. They were unable to pre-
cisely quantify the difference in value, noting that it was
greater than 10:1.
The Voting Panel met to decide the final recommenda-
tions. The Panel discussed the evidence in the context of
both their clinical experience and the input from the
Patient Panel. The Panel voted anonymously, and 80%
agreement defined the threshold for a recommendation; if
80% agreement was not achieved during an initial vote,
ACR/AAHKS Guideline for Perioperative Management
1115
 the Panel members held additional discussions before re-
voting. Considerations that led to rating down of quality
of evidence included indirectness (much of the evidence
came from RCTs outside of the surgical context, or from
foot or spine procedures in which infection risks may vary
markedly from THA or TKA); heterogeneity in baseline
medication dose and duration, particularly relevant in
studies addressing glucocorticoid “stress-dose” therapy;
and imprecision associated with small sample size.
All recommendations were supported by more than 80%
of the Panel, and all but 1 were supported unanimously. In
some instances, the Panel combined PICO questions into 1
final recommendation. For recommendations to withhold
a medication, a recommendation for the suggested timing
of surgery in relation to the last drug-dose was included.
RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS
How to interpret the recommendations
1. All recommendations in this guideline are conditional
due to the quality of the evidence (see bolded statements
in Table 2). A conditional recommendation means that
the desirable effects of following the recommendation
probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course
of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but
may not apply to all patients. Because of this, condi-
tional recommendations are preference sensitive and
always warrant a shared decision-making approach. No
strong recommendations are made in this guideline.
2. For each recommendation, a summary of the supporting
evidence or conditions is provided.
3. Therapies that were approved after the original sys-
tematic literature review are not included in these
recommendations.
4. PICO questions were combined in the final recommen-
dations for clarity.
Recommendations
1. RA, SpA including AS and PsA, JIA, and SLE receiv-
ing nonbiologic DMARDs
Continue the current dose of methotrexate, lefluno-
mide, hydroxychloroquine, and/or sulfasalazine for
patients undergoing elective THA or TKA (Table 2).
This conditional recommendation was based on low- to
moderate-quality evidence. A systematic review of litera-
ture, which included RCTs of continuing versus dis-
continuing DMARDs at the time of surgery, revealed that
the risk of infections was in fact decreased, with continu-
ing DMARDs having a relative risk (RR) of 0.39 (95% CI
0.17–0.91) (37,38). The evidence base is rated down
from high to moderate for reduction in infection risk
after orthopedic surgery when these drugs are continued,
because of risk of bias. There is indirect evidence describ-
ing a low infection risk with these specific DMARDs
in settings other than THA and TKA (39). This recommen-
dation was based on infection risk, although flares are
also less frequent after surgery in those who continue
DMARDs, and the RRs of flares when DMARDs are contin-
ued versus stopped (RR 0.06 [95% CI 0.0–1.10]) were
derived from low-quality evidence (37,40).
2. RA, SpA including AS and PsA, JIA, or SLE
Withhold all current biologic agents prior to surgery
in patients undergoing elective THA or TKA, and
plan the surgery at the end of the dosing cycle for
that specific medication (Table 2).
This recommendation was based on evidence that was
rated down in quality for indirectness, as no RCTs were
performed in patients undergoing THA or TKA. We
abstracted data from a systematic review of literature that
included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of biologic
agents versus placebo (and occasionally versus control
treatment including nonbiologic DMARDs) in nonsurgical
patients, which revealed that the risk of serious infections
was increased with biologic agents, with most odds/
hazards/risk ratios ;1.5 (range 0.61–8.87) and a higher risk
of serious adverse events with most odds/hazards/risk
ratios ;1.5 (range 0.33–2.54) (41–87). Our systematic
review did not provide ample evidence that would support
a differential risk of serious infection among available bio-
logic agents (41–87). Because avoiding infection was signif-
icantly more important to patients than flares in the
postoperative period, the Panel did not support separating
biologic agents regarding infection risk in the perioperative
period until further studies clarify and establish differ-
ences in risk (41–87). The literature review also revealed
that the risk of postoperative infection complications after
total joint arthroplasty (TJA) was increased in patients with
RA nearly 2-fold, and deep infection complications increased
by 1.5-fold (2,56); in SLE, overall postoperative complications
were increased 1.3-fold, and septicemia by 2-fold (8), although
medication use at the time of surgery was not always reported.
In addition, a systematic review, meta-analysis, and network
meta-analysis revealed that infection risk for biologic agents is
strongly associated with high-dose therapy (higher dose than
the standard) and may not be associated with low-dose bio-
logic agents (42), so serum half-life may not correspond to the
duration of the immunosuppressant effect. The dosing cycle
was therefore chosen as more relevant in determining the with-
holding interval (88–91) and timing the surgery at the end of
the dosing interval at the nadir of the drug effect.
With regard to patients with SLE, a systematic review of
literature that included systematic reviews and meta-
analyses of rituximab versus placebo (and occasionally
versus control treatment including nonbiologic DMARDs)
in nonsurgical patients with RA and SLE revealed the risk
of serious infections with rituximab with a range of RRs
from 0.66 to 0.73 (41,45), and a risk for all serious adverse
events with a range of RRs from 0.85 (95% CI 0.62–1.17) to
0.89 (95% CI 0.7–1.14) (59,92). However, most data were
indirect and the Panel considered these medications to be
similar to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors used for the
treatment of RA, which usually have a risk of infection.
Moreover, rituximab is not approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of SLE, and
belimumab, although FDA-approved for use in SLE, has
not been studied in manifestations of severe SLE (e.g.,
1116
Goodman et al
 lupus nephritis), so the Panel recommended withholding
these medications prior to surgery and planning the sur-
gery for the end of the dosing cycle, due to the risk of
infection and the paucity of data supporting perioperative
benefit in SLE (93–95).
Observational studies reveal that patients with severe
or active SLE have a higher risk of adverse events after
surgery, but there is no approved role for these biologic
agents for patients with severe SLE, including periopera-
tive risk mitigation. SLE manifestations of rash and syno-
vitis are the common clinical indications for belimumab
(95,96), and are not thought to increase perioperative
risk. There is no direct evidence, however, linking peri-
operative infection risk to the use of these biologic
agents, and little is known about the association of surgi-
cal risk with biologic agents for patients with SLE. Since
the duration of the immunologic effects of these drugs
does not correspond to the serum level, the Panel based
the recommendation on the dosing interval (88–91). The
Patient Panel did not include patients with SLE, and
they were reluctant to vote on SLE medication manage-
ment strategies because they were uncertain about the
value SLE patients would place on flares, which might be
organ-threatening, compared to infection risk.
As an example, using this guideline, patients treated
with adalimumab, routinely dosed at 2-week intervals,
would plan their surgery in week 3, while patients treated
with infliximab, when dosed every 8 weeks, would sched-
ule their surgery in the week after the first withheld dose
during week 9. Patients treated with rituximab every 6
months would schedule their surgery, when possible, at the
week after the first withheld dose during month 7. Patients
with SLE receiving belimumab, which is given every
4 weeks, would schedule their surgery during week 5.
3. RA, SpA including AS and PsA, or JIA
Withhold tofacitinib for at least 7 days prior to sur-
gery in patients with RA, SpA including AS and PsA,
or JIA undergoing THA or TKA (Table 2).
This recommendation was based on indirect evidence
from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of tofacitinib
versus placebo (and occasionally versus control treatment
including nonbiologic DMARDs) in nonsurgical patients
showing that the risk of serious infections was increased
with tofacitinib, with an incidence rate of 2.91 (95% CI
2.27–3.74) (97) and higher risk of all infections, with an
RR of 5.7 (95% CI 1.8–18.1) (48). Although this drug has
an extremely short serum half-life, little is known about
the duration of immunosuppression after the drug is with-
held, although indirect translational data suggest that host
defense returns to normal at 7 days. Therefore, the Panel
recognized that the recommendation for the duration of with-
holding may change in the future, as physician and patient
experience with this drug grows (41,47,48,51,77,79,97,98).
4. Severe SLE (as defined in Table 1)
Continue
the
current
dose
of
methotrexate,
mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine,
or tacrolimus through the surgical period in all
patients undergoing THA or TKA (Table 2).
There is a great deal of uncertainty and little published expe-
rience regarding risks associated with perioperative medica-
tion management in patients with severe SLE. There is,
however, indirect evidence concerning organ transplant
patients who continue anti-rejection therapy through the surgi-
cal period (99,100). The caveat to this analogy is that the time
course of organ rejection after withholding immunosuppres-
sant medication may be different from the time to SLE flare
after withholding medications. These considerations led to
the recommendation to continue the current dose of metho-
trexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine,
or tacrolimus through the surgical period in all patients
with severe SLE. Nevertheless, the Panel felt that decisions
regarding elective surgery in patients with severe SLE
should be made on an individual basis with the patient’s
rheumatologist.
5. Not-severe SLE (as defined in Table 1)
Withhold the current dose of mycophenolate mofetil,
azathioprine, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus 1 week prior
to surgery in all patients undergoing THA or TKA
(Table 2).
For patients with not-severe SLE, the time course to
flares after withholding medications is not known, while
there is a known infection risk associated with these medi-
cations. The Panel felt that careful monitoring of the
patient after surgery would permit restarting the medi-
cations prior to clinical flares in patients with not-severe
SLE, for whom the morbidity of infection might outweigh
the risk of a flare. These medications can be withheld 1
week prior to surgery, permitting some return of normal
immune function, and restarted at 3–5 days after surgery
in the absence of wound healing complications or infec-
tion at the surgical site or elsewhere. There are multiple
mechanisms
postulated
for
immunosuppression
with
these medications, including leukopenia, interference
with T cell costimulatory signaling, and blocking the de
novo pathway of purine synthesis, with different time
courses for onset and reversal (101,102).
6. RA, SpA including AS and PsA, JIA, or SLE
Restart biologic therapy in patients for whom biologic
therapy was withheld prior to undergoing THA or TKA
once the wound shows evidence of healing (typically ~14
days), all sutures/staples are out, there is no significant
swelling, erythema, or drainage, and there is no clinical
evidence of non–surgical site infections (Table 2).
The decision to restart antirheumatic therapy can be
based on evaluation of the patient’s wound status and
clinical judgment for absence of surgical and non–surgical
site infections; wound closure is typically reached by 14
days. Therefore, biologic therapy can be restarted once the
wound shows evidence of healing (typically ;14 days),
all sutures/staples are out, there is no significant swelling,
erythema, or drainage, and there is no clinical evidence of

Recommendations for perioperative management of antirheumatic drug therapy in patients
with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective THA or TKA*
Recommendation/strength of recommendation (bold indicates conditional)
Level of evidence
RA, SpA including AS and PsA, JIA, or SLE: Continue the current dose of methotrexate, leflunomide,
hydroxychloroquine, and/or sulfasalazine (nonbiologic DMARDs) for patients undergoing elective THA
or TKA.
� RCTs of continuing vs. discontinuing DMARDs at the time of surgery revealed that the risk of infections
was not increased, but in fact decreased, when DMARDs were continued, with an RR of 0.39 (95% CI
0.17–0.91) (37,38). Evidence indicates a low infection risk with these DMARDs in settings other than
THA and TKA (39).
� Disease flares after surgery occur frequently, and continuing DMARDs decreases the risk (RR 0.06 [95%
CI 0.0–1.10]) (37,40), yet flares were significantly less important than infection for the Patient Panel.
Low to moderate
RA, SpA including AS and PsA, JIA, or SLE: Withhold all current biologic agents (see Figure 1) prior to
surgery in patients undergoing elective THA or TKA, and plan the surgery at the end of the dosing cycle
for that specific medication.
� RCTs (nonsurgical) demonstrated an increase in infection risk associated with use of all biologic agents
(41–87).
� Avoiding infection was significantly more important to patients than flares for patients with RA and JIA.
� Meta-analysis and network meta-analysis revealed that infection risk for biologic agents is strongly
associated with high-dose therapy and may not be associated with low-dose biologic agents (42).
� Serum half-life may not correspond to the duration of the immune-suppressant effect, so the dosing
cycle was chosen as more relevant in determining the withholding interval (88–91).
� Until further studies have clarified and established differences in risk between biologic agents, there
was insufficient evidence to support separating biologic agent management in the perioperative period
(43–89).
� For SLE, there was paucity of data supporting perioperative benefit in SLE (93–95).
� A systematic review of rituximab vs. placebo (and occasionally vs. control treatment including
nonbiologic DMARDs) in nonsurgical patients with RA and SLE revealed the risk of all serious adverse
events with a range of RRs from 0.85 (95% CI 0.62–1.17) to 0.89 (95% CI 0.7–1.14) (59,92).
� Observational studies reveal that patients with SLE, particularly those with active or severe SLE, are at
a higher risk for adverse events after surgery.
� Belimumab is indicated for use in not-severe SLE, which is not thought to increase perioperative risk
(95,96).
� As an example, using this guideline, patients treated with rituximab every 6 months would schedule
their surgery, when possible, at the week after the first withheld dose during month 7. Patients receiving
belimumab, which is given every 4 weeks, would schedule their surgery during week 5.
� Patients treated with adalimumab, dosed at 2-week intervals, would plan their surgery in week 3, while
patients treated with infliximab, when dosed every 8 weeks, would schedule their surgery in the week
after the first withheld dose during week 9.
Low
RA, SpA including AS and PsA, or JIA: Withhold tofacitinib for at least 7 days prior to surgery in
patients undergoing THA or TKA.
� Indirect evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of tofacitinib vs. placebo (and occasionally
vs. control treatment including nonbiologic DMARDs) in nonsurgical patients shows that the risk of
serious infections was increased with tofacitinib with an incidence rate of 2.91 (95% CI 2.27–3.74) (97)
and higher risk of all infections with an RR of 5.7 (95% CI 1.8–18.1) (48).
� Although this drug has an extremely short serum half-life, little is known about the duration of
immunosuppression after the drug is withheld. Therefore, the Panel recognized that the recommenda-
tion for the duration of withholding may change in the future, as physician and patient experience with
this drug grows (41,47,48,51,77,79,97,98).
Low
Severe SLE: Continue the current dose of mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine, or
tacrolimus through the surgical period in all patients undergoing THA or TKA (see Figure 1).
� The Panel recognized that there is a great deal of uncertainty and little published experience regarding
risks associated with perioperative medication management in patients with severe SLE.
� Indirect evidence with organ transplant patients supports continuing anti-rejection therapy without
interruption at the time of surgery (99,100).
� Decisions regarding elective surgery in patients with severe SLE should be made on an individual basis
with the patient’s rheumatologist.

 non–surgical site infections. There is no direct evidence
regarding the optimal time to restart medication after sur-
gery, but standard precautions for biologic agents warn
against use in patients with an active infection or in high-
risk settings, such as with an open wound.
7. RA, SpA including AS and PsA, or SLE
Continue the current daily dose of glucocorticoids in
adult patients with RA, SpA including AS and PsA, or
SLE who are receiving glucocorticoids for their rheu-
matic condition and undergoing THA or TKA, rather
than administering perioperative supra-physiologic glu-
cocorticoid doses (so-called “stress dosing”) (Table 2).
Hemodynamic instability/hypotension and infection
risk were 2 specific areas of concern with regard to periop-
erative glucocorticoid dosing. Regarding hemodynamic
instability, the recommendation to continue the current
daily dose of glucocorticoids in adult patients who are
receiving
glucocorticoids,
rather
than
administering
perioperative
supra-physiologic
glucocorticoid
doses
(“stress dosing”), specifically refers to adults with RA, AS,
PsA, or SLE who are receiving glucocorticoids (#16 mg/
day prednisone or equivalent) for their rheumatic condi-
tion; it does not refer to JIA patients receiving glucocorti-
coids who may have been treated with glucocorticoids
during childhood developmental stages, or to patients
receiving glucocorticoids to treat primary adrenal insuffi-
ciency or primary hypothalamic disease. Low-quality RCT
evidence (rated down for indirectness due to varying gluco-
corticoid doses, heterogeneity of surgical procedures, and
imprecision due to small numbers) and evidence from obser-
vational trials summarized in a systematic review suggested
that
there
was
no
significant
hemodynamic
difference
between those patients given their current daily glucocorticoid
dose compared to those receiving “stress-dose steroids” (103).
Regarding the infection risk, the Panel noted that the
cutoff for immunosuppression according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention was 20 mg/day of
prednisone for at least 2 weeks, in the context of risk

addition, observational studies demonstrate an increase in
infection risk following TJA for long-term users of gluco-
corticoids at doses of .15 mg/day. A patient in optimal
condition for elective THA or TKA would be receiving a
dose of prednisone or equivalent that was ,20 mg/day,
when possible, and receive their usual daily dose rather
than the “stress dose” in light of the effect on infection
risk (102,103).
DISCUSSION
The 2017 ACR/AAHKS guideline for the perioperative
management of antirheumatic drug therapy for adults
undergoing elective THA and TKA was designed for use
by clinicians and patients during the perioperative period.
Included recommendations address the use of treatment
with antirheumatic drugs (including DMARDs, tofacitinib,
biologic agents, and glucocorticoids) for the adult patient
with RA, SpA including AS and PsA, JIA, or SLE, recog-
nizing that antirheumatic medication is frequently used at
the time of THA or TKA, and that rates of infection and
adverse events, including readmission, are increased in
this population. The optimal management of antirheu-
matic medications to treat these diseases may mitigate
risks. We have used GRADE methodology to synthesize
the best available evidence and have been transparent
regarding both the strength of the recommendation and the
limited quality of the evidence for each recommendation.
This project brought together major stakeholders (orthope-
dic arthroplasty surgeons, rheumatologists, methodologists,
and patients) to create a patient-centric, expert-led group to
determine optimal management of these high-risk patients
through a group consensus process. To date, there has been
little to no consensus among orthopedic surgeons or rheu-
matologists on the optimal way to manage antirheumatic
medications during the TJA perioperative period, which
often leads to uncertainty in decision-making for physicians
and patients alike.
A major limitation of this guideline is the paucity of
high-quality, direct evidence regarding medications and
perioperative risk of infection and flare. The indirect
nature of the evidence was the primary reason the quality
of evidence was considered low, which led to a condi-
tional designation for all the recommendations. Nonethe-
less, because patients with rheumatic diseases frequently
undergo THA and TKA while receiving DMARDs and bio-
logic agents, we sought to fulfill the need for guidance
based on the best available evidence and agreement among
stakeholders. The Patient Panel thought infection risk was
much more important than flare risk, and this drove the
direction of the recommendations (uniformly in favor of
withholding any medications in which evidence from non-
operative populations suggested an increase in infection).
Topics such as cardiac risk, deep venous thrombosis
risk, risk of 90-day readmissions, and management and
care of the cervical spine are related to the perioperative
care of patients with rheumatic disease who are undergo-
ing THA or TKA. The guideline was limited, however, to
risks attributable to perioperative management of anti-
rheumatic drug therapy.
Antirheumatic medications and disease states were ini-
tially evaluated individually. Due to a lack of evidence,
however, for each individual medication and disease
state, the medications were combined by category and dis-
eases, with the exception of SLE.
With regard to patients with SLE, the Panel recognized
that recommendations for perioperative medication man-
agement in a complex disease such as SLE would be chal-
lenging, as SLE is frequently complicated by multiple
organ involvement, as well as complex or unusual medi-
cation regimens. Moreover, SLE flares may be organ-
threatening, and SLE patients may be more averse to
risk of flare than to infection; therefore, the lack of SLE
patients on the Patient Panel was a limitation. Nonethe-
less, the orthopedic and rheumatology stakeholders felt
strongly that perioperative medication management guid-
ance was needed for SLE patients.
The recommendation to restart biologic agents was
based on the patient’s wound healing (generally requiring
a minimum of 14 days) and clinical judgment for the
absence of both surgical site and non–surgical site infec-
tion. While there are differences in practice patterns and
many patients do not return to their surgeon within 2
weeks of discharge, screening mechanisms to assess the
wound, including utilizing visiting nurse services, and
taking photographs of the wound for review by e-mail,
smartphone, or other mobile health technologies, would
help to identify those who should be evaluated in person
prior to restarting biologic agents.
The Voting Panel thought it worthwhile to suggest a
research roadmap for future studies that could be con-
ducted
as
part
of
a
collaboration
between
the
2
organizations. The team discussed the following topics
and
recommended
that
they
be
targeted
for
future
research: 1) Perioperative glucocorticoid management.
While the RCT data support continuing the current gluco-
corticoid dose rather than “stress dosing,” limited num-
bers of patients and heterogeneity of dose, diagnosis, and
surgical procedure leave us with only low-quality evi-
dence; 2) Perioperative management of biologic agents.
The Voting Panel suggested investigating existing biologic
agents through registries and administrative databases, as
well as planning multicenter RCTs to define the optimal
medication management strategy; and 3) Perioperative
management of DMARDs. Currently, data from RCTs for
patients undergoing surgery reflect older, lower-dose
regimens for methotrexate, and studies of leflunomide
include small numbers of patients. Multicenter RCTs
should be performed to determine the optimal periopera-
tive management regimens and include assessment of
comorbidities and glucocorticoid use in the study design.
The recommendations that form this guideline are not
treatment mandates, but can be used to provide guidance
and promote discussion regarding medication manage-
ment prior to surgery. The authors recognize that not all
potential perioperative clinical scenarios are covered by
this guideline, but the most common clinical scenarios are
addressed. This guideline does not replace perioperative
clinical
assessment
and
optimization,
and
does
not
1120
Goodman et al
 preclude a discussion of the risks and benefits of surgery
as patients and their physicians prepare for THA and
TKA.
In summary, this guideline provides clinicians and
patients with a working document regarding how to man-
age antirheumatic drugs in the time leading up to elective
THA and TKA. The recommendations provide important
guidance that was informed by the available literature,
clinical expertise and experience, and patient values and
preferences. The acknowledgment of low-quality evidence
in this area should lay the foundation for future research.
