In Brief
Buonomo et al. find that IL-25, a
microbiota-regulated cytokine, reduces
mortality during C. difficile infection. IL-25
expression is reduced during human and
mouse infection, but repletion of its signal
leads to an eosinophil-dependent
reduction in intestinal tissue damage.
This work may provide targets for future
microbial or immune-based therapies.

SUMMARY
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most com-
mon cause of hospital-acquired infection in the
United States. Host susceptibility and the severity
of infection are influenced by disruption of the micro-
biota and the immune response. However, how the
microbiota regulate immune responses to mediate
CDI outcome remains unclear. Here, we have investi-
gated the role of the microbiota-linked cytokine IL-25
during infection. Intestinal IL-25 was suppressed
during CDI in humans and mice. Restoration of IL-
25 reduced CDI-associated mortality and tissue pa-
thology even though equivalent levels of C. difficile
bacteria and toxin remained in the gut. IL-25 protec-
tion was mediated by gut eosinophils, as demon-
strated by an increase in intestinal eosinophils and
a loss of IL-25 protection upon eosinophil depletion.
These findings support a mechanism whereby the in-
duction of IL-25-mediated eosinophilia can reduce
host mortality during active CDI. This work may pro-
vide targets for future development of microbial or
immune-based therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is currently the leading cause
of hospital-acquired infection and gastroenteritis-associated
deaths in the United States (Lessa et al., 2015). As a result, it
has been listed as one of three urgent threats by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Despite therapy,
C. difficile causes an estimated 453,000 infections, 83,000 re-
lapses, and 29,300 deaths annually, stressing the need for better
treatment and management options (Lessa et al., 2015). This
gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium infects the
colon when the normal microbiota have been disrupted, primar-
ily through antibiotic use. Following colonization, the release of
chief virulence factors, toxins A and B, causes epithelial cell
rounding and death, compromising the integrity of the intestinal
barrier. Therapy involves treatment with antibiotics such as van-
comycin, fidaxomicin, or metronidazole (Cowardin and Petri,
2014). In addition to effectively targeting C. difficile, these antibi-
otics can inhibit the reestablishment of beneficial endogenous
flora, which may in part explain the high numbers of relapses
and deaths associated with this disease.
CDI symptoms range from mild diarrhea to life-threatening
pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Recent studies
indicate that increased inflammatory markers, such as IL-8, are
more accurate at predicting poor patient outcome than increased
bacterial burden, suggesting that the type and/or intensity of the
immune response may control the severity of the disease (El Fe-
ghaly et al., 2013a, 2013b). In fact, numerous studies support a
dual rolefortheimmuneresponsetoCDI.Forinstance,innateme-
diators, such as MyD88 signaling, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs),
leptin, and IL-22, have been observed to play a protective role
during CDI in mice, yet inflammasome-driven IL-23 signaling is
deleterious during CDI in mice (Abt et al., 2015; Buonomo et al.,
2013; Cowardin et al., 2015; Geiger et al., 2014; Hasegawa
et al., 2014; Jarchum et al., 2012; Madan et al., 2014; Ryan
et al., 2011). Together these studies support a multifaceted role
for the immune response during CDI.
In addition to the immune response, the status of the micro-
biota plays a fundamental role during CDI. The protective capa-
bilities of healthy microbiota to both inhibit and resolve disease
is emphasized by the lack of host susceptibility to C. difficile
in the presence of intact microbiota and the recently demon-
strated efficacy of fecal transplants in preventing relapses
(Britton and Young, 2014). Despite the central role of both
the microbiota and the immune response to regulate disease
pathogenesis, the role of the microbiota in influencing the host
immune response during CDI is unclear. Crosstalk between
the microbiota and the immune system is critical for shaping
both the immune response and the microbial composition of
the gut.
One example of this relationship is the cytokine interleukin-25
(IL-25), which is dependent on the microbiota, as germ-free and

 antibiotic-treated mice show decreased IL-25 production (Zaph
et al., 2008). IL-25 is an inducer of type 2 immune responses and
increased levels correlate with decreased IL-23 expression
(Kleinschek et al., 2007; Zaph et al., 2008). IL-25 is capable of
inducing type 2 responses characterized by eosinophil, baso-
phil, and mast cell accumulation systemically and at local sites
of inflammation (Fallon et al., 2006; Fort et al., 2001; Franze
`
et al., 2011). Although type 2 immunity is typically examined
in the context of asthma, allergy, and helminth infection, the con-
sequences of type 2 effector functions are versatile and can
mediate pathogenic, protective, or regulatory responses given
the environmental contexts (Saenz et al., 2008). In human CDI,
low eosinophil numbers are a risk factor for persistent diarrhea
or death and recurrent disease (Crook et al., 2012). These obser-
vations prompt the possibility that microbiota regulation of IL-25
and type 2 immune responses may influence disease severity
during CDI. Furthermore, they uncover a potential therapeutic
target, which may help to guide future prebiotic and fecal
transplant cocktail development to enhance IL-25 and type 2 re-
sponses. Since IL-25 is regulated by the microbiota and is ex-
pressed inversely to the cytokine IL-23, which is deleterious dur-
ing CDI, we hypothesize that IL-25 is downregulated during CDI.
Increasing its levels might thus reduce disease severity through
influencing the immune response.
RESULTS
IL-25 Is Regulated by the Microbiota and Suppressed
during Human and Murine CDI
The presence of healthy microbiota has been shown to both pre-
vent susceptibility to and resolve active CDI. The expression of
the type 2 cytokine IL-25 is dependent on the microbiota, as
demonstrated by its diminished expression in antibiotic-treated
and germ-free mice (Zaph et al., 2008). Therefore, we hypothe-
sized that IL-25 protein expression is decreased during CDI.
To evaluate IL-25 protein regulation during human CDI, we
stained colon biopsies of CDI-negative (�) and CDI-positive (+)
patients (Figure 1A; Table S1), and we scored for IL-25 staining
(Figure 1B). Significant reductions in IL-25 expression were
observed in CDI patients when compared to controls.
We wished to understand if the reduction in IL-25 expression
during human CDI was due to antibiotic treatments that CDI pa-
tients were likely receiving or the infection itself. IL-25 protein
was measured in the cecum of C57BL/6J mice that were un-
treated; given only antibiotics; or on days 1, 2, and 3 post-
C. difficile infection. Our infection model consists of antibiotic
treatment in order to render mice susceptible to infection, fol-
lowed by gavage with �104–105 colony-forming units (CFUs) of
vegetative C. difficile (strain VPI10643) (Chen et al., 2008).
IL-25 expression was evaluated by both immunohistochem-
ical staining of the cecum and total protein in cecal lysates. IL-
25 expression by both analyses was suppressed by antibiotics
but further diminished on day 3 of CDI (Figures 1C and 1D).
These data suggest that the environment created by CDI not
only sustains but also further decreases IL-25 protein levels
compared to antibiotic treatment alone. Separation of the
colonic epithelial from the lamina propria (LP) indicated that IL-
25 protein was found primarily in epithelial cells (Figure 1E). Addi-
tionally, epithelial cell-specific IL-25 was similarly reduced from
antibiotic-treated levels on day 3 of CDI (Figure 1F). In contrast,
IL-25 protein was observed in both epithelial cell and cells infil-
trating the LP in human biopsies, suggesting IL-25 expression
might differ between humans and mice. This observation re-
quires further investigation; but, regardless of human and mouse
cell differences in IL-25 expression, IL-25 protein expression
was decreased during CDI in both human and mice. Overall,
these data indicate that epithelial cells in mice are the primary
source of IL-25 protein and that CDI significantly decreases IL-
25 levels from antibiotic treatment alone.
Restoration of IL-25 Provided Protection to Mice against
CDI-Associated Mortality and Morbidity
The microbiota can prevent susceptibility to CDI by outcompet-
ing the pathogen and inducing host factors, yet potentially bene-
ficial influences of the microbiota to modulate the immune
response and regulate CDI severity remain unknown (Britton
and Young, 2014). Our observation of decreased IL-25 protein
during CDI suggested that IL-25 regulation of type 2 immunity
could be a downstream mechanism of microbiota-mediated pro-
tection. To address this question, we tested if repletion of IL-25
could reduce disease severity in the setting of antibiotics and
active CDI. Mice were treated with a daily dose of 0.5 mg recom-
binant IL-25 or PBS daily for 5 days prior to infection (Figure S1).
Protection was assessed by mortality and a clinical scoring sys-
tem of morbidity (Warren et al., 2012).
Restoration of IL-25 led to significant decreases in mortality
(Figure 2A) and morbidity (Figure 2B), indicating that IL-25 reple-
tion leads to host protection. IL-25 pretreatment also was
capable of reducing CDI-associated morbidity in two additional
models of CDI, including a spore challenge (strain VPI10643)
(Figures S2A and S2B) and challenge with a second toxin A
and B producing C. difficile strain (strain 630) (Figures S2C and
S2D). IL-25- and PBS-treated mice surprisingly had similar levels
of C. difficile CFUs (Figure 2F) and virulence factors, toxins A and
B (Figure 2E), in the cecal contents, indicating that IL-25 does not
protect by influencing the ability of the pathogen to expand or
produce toxins in the gut. Immunohistological evaluation of the
cecum at day 3 post-infection showed that IL-25 significantly
decreased CDI-associated tissue pathology (Figures 2C and
2D). IL-25 treatment decreased cellular exudate and inflamma-
tory cell numbers in the LP, but the most profound impact was
the prevention of epithelial cell disruption at the intestinal barrier.
We concluded that IL-25 reduced disease severity by protecting
host tissue and maintaining the integrity of the epithelium, rather
than by dampening C. difficile growth or toxin production.
IL-25 Resulted in Increased IL-4 and Mucin Production
during CDI
The crosstalk between immune responses and the intestinal
epithelial is critical to maintaining homeostasis in the gut (Peter-
son and Artis, 2014). Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-25-
mediated epithelial tissue protection during CDI occurred
through influences on the immune response. To understand
how IL-25 shaped immunity during infection, we evaluated pro-
tein levels of inflammatory cytokines in cecal tissue on day 3 of
infection (Figure 3A). IL-23 is known to have a deleterious role

 during CDI and also has been indicated to signal inversely of IL-
25; thus, we examined whether IL-25 dampened IL-23 levels in
the gut (Buonomo et al., 2013; Kleinschek et al., 2007; Zaph
et al., 2008). IL-25 treatment reduced IL-23 protein production
in cecal lysates, but had no effect on downstream Th17-like cy-
tokines IL-17 or IL-22 (Figure 3A). Therefore, we concluded that
the reduction in IL-23 may partly contribute to IL-25-mediated
protection, but there are likely additional immune mediators
playing a role. Next we evaluated how IL-25 treatment manipu-
lated two canonical type 2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13. IL-25 has
historically enhanced both cytokines, yet we only observed
increased production of IL-4 during CDI (Figure 3A). Conversely,
we detected decreased IL-13 protein levels in the cecal tissue on
day 3. To test if induction of IL-13 by IL-25 occurs earlier than
day 3, cecal protein levels also were measured on days 0 and
2 without evidence of increased IL-13 protein with IL-25 treat-
ment (Figure S3). Our studies were done in antibiotic-treated
and infected mice, which may explain the lack of IL-25 induction
of IL-13 protein. Further investigation into the role of IL-13 and its
protein levels in cecal contents and systemically during CDI is
needed to establish the relevance of this observation.
To evaluate the cellular source of IL-4, we utilized flow cytom-
etry to intracellularly stain and measure IL-4-producing cell pop-
ulations in the colonic LP on day 3 of infection (Figure S4). In
agreement with protein levels, the absolute number of IL-4-pro-
ducing cells was increased with IL-25 treatment (Figure S4A).
The majority of IL-4-producing cells were CD11b+ (Figure S4B).
Further examination revealed that IL-4+ cells were mainly

 CD11b+ SiglecF+, identifying eosinophils as the primary source
of this cytokine during CDI (Figure S4C).
IL-25 also has been demonstrated to enhance mucus produc-
tion (von Moltke et al., 2016). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining
(Figure 3B) and scoring (Figure 3C) of the cecal tissue on day 3
revealed that IL-25 induced mucus production. RNA analysis
of cecal tissue by qPCR confirmed increased transcripts for
muc2, a gene that encodes a major component of mucin, in IL-
25-treated mice (Figure 3D). These data prompted the hypothe-
sis that IL-25 may protect the host by bolstering the physical
mucus barrier lining the epithelial tissue or by inducing IL-4.
From these data, we concluded that IL-25 decreased the delete-
rious cytokine IL-23 and increased IL-4 and mucin production
during CDI.
IL-25 Resulted in the Accumulation of Eosinophils, but
Not Neutrophils in the LP of the Colon during CDI
Neutrophils are considered the hallmark innate effector cell of
human C. difficile infection, but IL-25 signaling is primarily asso-
ciated with eosinophilia (Cowardin and Petri, 2014; Fort et al.,
2001). Therefore, we sought to identify the ability of IL-25 to
modulate neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes in LP of the
colon on day 3 of CDI. Infection increased the levels of both eo-
sinophils (Figure 4A) and neutrophils (Figure 4B) compared to
antibiotic treatment alone, indicating that both granulocyte sub-
sets were recruited to the LP during infection. IL-25 selectively
increased absolute cell numbers and percentages of eosinophils
during CDI (Figure 4A). In contrast, IL-25 treatment did not influ-
ence numbers of neutrophils (Figure 4B) or Ly6chi and Ly6clo
monocytes (Figure S3) during CDI. Increased eosinophilia by
both measurements correlated with decreased clinical scores
(Figures 4C and 4D), implying that eosinophilia may play a role
in dampening CDI severity. These data demonstrated that IL-
25 pretreatment selectively enhanced eosinophil, but not neutro-
phil, accumulation during CDI, and they prompted the hypothe-
sis that eosinophils may play a role in IL-25-mediated protection.
Eosinophils Are Essential for IL-25-Mediated Protection
against CDI Severity
IL-25 pretreatment decreased mortality and induced robust
eosinophilia during CDI. Furthermore, increased eosinophils in
the colon correlated with less severe clinical scores. This led
us to hypothesize that eosinophils may be downstream of IL-
25-mediated protection. Two distinct models where mice lacked
eosinophils were utilized to test the hypothesis. First, PBS- and
IL-25-treated mice were treated with either anti-SiglecF, an

 eosinophil-depleting monoclonal antibody, or an IgG isotype
antibody. Anti-SiglecF treatment selectively depleted eosino-
phils, as demonstrated by a significant decrease in eosinophils
(Figure S5A), but not neutrophils (Figure S5B) in the LP of the
colon (Chu et al., 2014; Griseri et al., 2015). Similarly, total IL-4
(Figure S5C) and CD11b+ IL-4+- (Figure S5D) expressing
cells were significantly reduced with anti-SiglecF treatment.
This was expected since eosinophils are the primary producers
of IL-4 during CDI.
IL-25-treated mice lacking eosinophils due to anti-SiglecF
depletion experienced increased mortality (Figure 5A) and
morbidity (Figure 5B), demonstrating that eosinophils were an
essential downstream effector cell in IL-25-mediated protection.
Interestingly, depletion of eosinophils in control mice did not
influence mortality, suggesting that a more significant enhance-
ment of eosinophilia to levels seen in IL-25-treated mice may
be required for survival benefits. Second, we utilized PHIL
mice, transgenic mice that genetically lack eosinophils, to
assess the ability of IL-25 to protect in the absence of eosino-
phils (Jacobsen et al., 2008). PHIL mice and wild-type littermate
controls were treated with PBS or IL-25 and assessed for sur-
vival rates (Figure 5C) and clinical scores (Figure 5D) during
infection. In agreement with antibody-mediated depletion of eo-
sinophils, PHIL mice could not be rescued from severe disease
with IL-25 pretreatment, supporting the necessity of these cells
in IL-25-mediated protection. In PHIL experiments, mice were
treated with a sub-lethal dose of 103 CFUs of C. difficile in order
to delineate differences between genotypes. The decreased
dose of C. difficile used to challenge mice in PHIL mice
experiments likely explains the reduced mortality of wild-type
PBS-treated mice when compared to wild-type mice used in
other experiments. Interestingly, enhanced disease severity
was observed in PHIL mice regardless of IL-25 treatment when
compared to wild-type controls, consistent with the importance
of eosinophils in CDI. We concluded that eosinophils were
the cellular mechanism by which IL-25 protects against CDI
mortality and morbidity.
Eosinophils Did Not Protect by Inducing IL-4 or Mucin
Production
IL-25 treatment led to enhanced IL-4 production. Since eosin-
ophils were the primary source of IL-4 during CDI and were
necessary for IL-25-mediated reduction in mortality, we spec-
ulated that IL-4 production may be the mechanism by which
eosinophils reduce disease severity. To test this, we compared
survival (Figure S6A) and morbidity (Figure S6B) in PBS con-
trol, IL-25-treated, and IL-25 + anti-IL4 monoclonal antibody-
treated mice. Neutralization of IL-4 did not influence mortality
but did slow disease resolution, suggesting that IL-4 does
not

a
role

 during initial disease, but may be important during disease
resolution.
Increased mucin also was observed with IL-25 treatment dur-
ing CDI. To test whether IL-25 protects via mucus induction, we
compared muc2 gene expression (Figure S6C) and mucin by
PAS histological analysis (Figure S6D) in the cecum of IL-25-
treated mice with or without eosinophils on day 3 of infection.
We did not observe differences in mucin production in the
absence of eosinophils. Thus, we concluded that mucin is not
likely to contribute to the protective capabilities of eosinophils.
Lastly, due to mounting evidence supporting a role for eosin-
ophils in promoting IgA responses, we tested whether eosino-
phils may be protective by increasing antibody levels in the gut
(Chu et al., 2014). We measured on day 3 post-infection total
IgA (Figure S6E) and IgG (Figure S6F) levels in the cecal contents
of IL-25-treated mice with or without eosinophil depletion. IgG
and IgA production were comparable despite the presence or
absence of eosinophils, indicating eosinophils do not protect
by increasing total IgA or IgG levels during the initial 3 days of
CDI infection. Together these data signify that IL-4, mucin, IgA,
and IgG responses were likely not responsible for the ability of
eosinophils to reduce mortality and morbidity during CDI.
Eosinophils Protected the Intestinal Epithelial Barrier
during CDI
To understand how eosinophils may be protecting against CDI-
associated mortality, we investigated the impact of eosinophil
depletion on the colonic intestinal epithelial barrier. Immunohis-
tochemical staining (Figure 6A) and scoring (Figure 6B) of cecal
tissue pathology were analyzed in IL-25-treated ± eosinophil-
depleted mice on day 3 post-infection. IL-25 mice lacking eosin-
ophils had increased epithelial destruction and cellular exudate
comparable to levels seen in wild-type mice. Additionally, mice
lacking eosinophils were the only group to have significantly
elevated luminal albumin compared to protected IL-25-treated
mice, demonstrating that these mice had the most severe barrier
disruption during infection (Figure 6C). In line with these findings,
IL-25-treated mice lacking eosinophils and PBS control mice had
significantly shorter colon length, a measure of more severe coli-
tis, when compared to IL-25-treated mice (Figure 6D). These data
suggest that the loss of eosinophils permitted the most drastic in-
testinal tissue damage, despite the presence of IL-25. To rule out
the possibility that eosinophils protected mice from mortality by
a direct bactericidal function against C. difficile, we quantified
C. difficile toxins A and B (Figure 6E) and bacterial burden (Fig-
ure 6F) in the cecal contents on day 3 of infection. We found com-
parable levels in all groups of mice, indicating that eosinophils do
not alter the ability of C. difficile to colonize and produce toxins in
the colon. Together, these data signify that eosinophils contribute
to IL-25-mediated protection during CDI by protecting host tis-
sue, rather than reducing the capabilities of the pathogen.
DISCUSSION
This work demonstrates that repletion of IL-25 protected from
CDI-associated mortality and morbidity through the action of

 gut eosinophils. We discovered that IL-25, a cytokine regulated
by the microbiota, was repressed in the colon of humans and
mice with CDI. Restoration of IL-25 reduced disease severity,
despite the presence of equivalent levels of C. difficile and toxins
in the gut lumen. IL-25 treatment reduced mortality and
morbidity and enhanced integrity of gut epithelial barrier in
an eosinophil-dependent manner. Therefore, this work demon-
strates a mechanism by which a microbiota-regulated cytokine
can induce an innate eosinophilic response that protects the
host epithelium and reduces mortality during CDI.
Our results suggest a role for the microbiota in CDI, one that
occurs after C. difficile colonization and that does not act by
decreasing the burden of C. difficile infection or intoxication.
Antibiotic treatment reduces microbial diversity and leads to
host susceptibility to CDI (Antonopoulos et al., 2009; Buffie
et al., 2012; Ferreyra et al., 2014). The mechanism by which
gut commensal bacteria protects historically has been linked
to
the
ability
of
the
healthy
microbiota
to
outcompete
C. difficile for space and nutrients (Britton and Young, 2014;
Ng et al., 2013; Wilson and Perini, 1988). Disruption of the micro-
biota also has been shown to alter primary and secondary bile
acids, resulting in enhanced germination of spores and subse-
quent outgrowth of C. difficile (Britton and Young, 2012; Buffie
et al., 2015). Therefore, prior studies support the paradigm that
the microbiota provides resistance to CDI by acting to block
host susceptibility to C. difficile. In contrast, our study demon-
strates that restoration of IL-25, a cytokine regulated by the mi-
crobiota and reduced during CDI, prevented death and disease
from CDI without influencing C. difficile bacterial burden or toxin
production. Thus IL-25 functions to reduce mortality in the face
of C. difficile toxin production, and it does so despite active
C. difficile colonization. These findings indicate that there are
several mechanisms by which the microbiota protect, and un-
derstanding the importance of microbiota regulation of innate
immune responses may provide insight into the development
of microbial-based therapies used for transplant and probiotic
treatments.
It is unclear how IL-25 is regulated during homeostasis, antibi-
otic treatment, and active CDI. However, it is possible that the
immune response to CDI may directly contribute to reducing
IL-25 levels. CDI has been associated with the induction of the
proinflammatory cytokines IL-23 and IL-1b (Cowardin et al.,
2015). Both cytokines correlate with lower IL-25 levels, and their
increased production during CDI may explain the significant
drop in IL-25 during infection (Zaiss et al., 2013; Zaph et al.,
2008). Alternatively, epithelial destruction, the cell source of IL-
25 in mice, may explain decreases observed in IL-25 expression
during CDI. Lastly, CDI has been shown to sustain microbial dys-
biosis in the intestine conferred by initial antibiotic treatment (An-
tharam et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2008; Engevik et al., 2015).
Thus, persistent decreases in microbial diversity combined
with the outgrowth of C. difficile during active infection may
abolish beneficial signals from commensal organisms that
induce IL-25 expression. Investigation into the bacterial compo-
nents of the microbiota that regulate IL-25 expression is required
to better understand these relationships.
Eosinophils were identified as the effector cell by which IL-25
signaling protected against CDI-associated mortality. While pre-
viously shown to be protective against gut helminth infection, the
role of eosinophils in CDI was unanticipated. In human CDI, pe-
ripheral eosinophils have been associated with protection from
persistent diarrhea and death, which supports our finding in
mice of their protective role (Crook et al., 2012). Currently, eosin-
ophils remain heavily examined in the context of allergy, asthma,
and parasitic infection, while our understanding of their role in
the broader context of bacterial infections remains incomplete.
Although there has been evidence of eosinophils having antibac-
terial capabilities in vitro, in vivo correlatives of their role in bac-
terial infections are limited (Hogan et al., 2013; Linch et al., 2012).
Since eosinophils did not reduce the burden of the pathogen, it is
likely that their action occurred downstream and involved main-
taining the intestinal barrier.
Eosinophils have several effector functions that may be bene-
ficial to protecting host tissue during CDI. First, eosinophils may
protect the host by regulating immune responses to promote a
balanced inflammatory environment that effectively combats
the pathogen but prevents off-target host tissue destruction.
This is plausible, as the immune response has a multifaceted
role during disease and different immune mediators play a pro-
tective or pathogenic role during CDI (Cowardin and Petri,
2014). Eosinophils previously have been demonstrated to pro-
mote a beneficial immune response in the colon. For instance,
in a model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, eo-
sinophils reduced intestinal pathology by dampening inflamma-
tory mediators in the colon via the lipid mediator protectin D1
(Masterson et al., 2015). Likewise, recent reports indicate that
eosinophils specific to the LP are capable of inducing the devel-
opment of regulatory T cells (Treg) and play an important role in
maintaining gut homeostasis by promoting IgA responses (Chen
et al., 2015; Chu et al., 2014).
In our model, it is possible that the environment in the colon
created by enhanced eosinophils may functionally influence
other immune mediators to result in a balanced immune
response that is beneficial to host outcome. This hypothesis is
supported by our results that IL-25 can selectively reduce dele-
terious IL-23, but does not influence downstream cytokine IL-22,
which has been demonstrated to have a protective role during
CDI (Buonomo et al., 2013; Hasegawa et al., 2014). Eosinophils
also may protect host tissues through their well-documented
ability to remodel and repair host tissue, limiting pathogen or
commensal entry into the LP. Likewise, eosinophils may protect
the host by facilitating rapid wound healing responses after
disruption by the pathogen (Travers and Rothenberg, 2015).
Thus, IL-25-mediated eosinophilia may protect against CDI-
associated mortality by creating a balance between proinflam-
matory and tolerogenic immune responses and/or by inducing
tissue remodeling and repair pathways to strengthen the
epithelial barrier.
While our study indicates that eosinophils are necessary for
IL-25-mediated protection, it is unknown whether IL-25 signals
directly or indirectly to facilitate the accumulation of eosinophils
in the LP. IL-25 receptor (IL-25RB) is expressed on human eosin-
ophils, yet it is more commonly found on type 2 innate lymphoid
cells (ILC2) in mice (Cheung et al., 2006; Saenz et al., 2008; Tang
et al., 2014; von Moltke et al., 2016). This prompts the question
of the involvement of ILC2s in IL-25-eosinophilia-mediated
440
Cell Reports 16, 432–443, July 12, 2016
 protection from CDI severity. Additionally, IL-25 shares the IL-
17RB/IL-17RA complex with IL-17B; therefore, it is possible
that IL-25 activates this receptor complex to influence the
expression of IL-17B, which may factor into the accumulation
of eosinophils in the intestine (Reynolds et al., 2015).
Finally, it remains unclear whether the ability of eosinophils
to reduce mortality is specific to the IL-25 signal, or if other
cytokines and chemokines that promote eosinophilia also are
capable of protecting the host. Our data demonstrate that, in
wild-type infection where IL-25 signal is diminished, depletion
of eosinophils does not influence host mortality, suggesting
that the eosinophils recruited during CDI in the absence of IL-
25 treatment are not sufficient to reduce the severity of disease.
It is possible that robust eosinophilia to levels higher than those
seen in wild-type infection is necessary to reduce mortality and
that any eosinophilia-promoting cytokine is capable of protect-
ing the host. Alternatively, it is conceivable that IL-25 functions
not only to support eosinophilia in the gut but directly or indirectly
primes eosinophils to function in a manner that is protective
toward host tissue. Further examination is required to under-
stand how IL-25 influences eosinophils to mediate protection
during CDI.
Overall, our study identifies IL-25 as a component of the
immune response that is regulated by healthy microbiota
and reduces pathology associated with CDI. We identified an
essential role for eosinophils in this process. Enhanced mortality,
relapse rates, and increased prevalence of CDI in the United
States stress the need for better therapies and management
strategies. Modulating the innate immune response to reduce
CDI-associated pathology may offer advantages to currently
inadequate antibiotic therapies, and, by acting downstream of
the microbiota, it may complement microbial-based therapeutic
development.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
Male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and PHIL mice
were a provided by J. Lee (Mayo Clinic) and bred in the UVA vivarium. Mice
were between 8 and 10 weeks of age and given access to autoclaved food
and water at the animal facility at UVA. All C57BL/6J mice ordered from Jack-
son were age-matched males, but both male and female mice were age
matched and evenly distributed within experimental groups used in PHIL ex-
periments. Sex- and age-matched controls were used in all experiments. All
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit-
tee (IACUC) at UVA.
CDI
Mice were received from Jackson Laboratory and started immediately on anti-
biotic treatment. PHIL mice were littermates and bred at the UVA vivarium. An-
tibiotics consisted of gentamicin (Sigma) (50 mg/ml), metronidazole (Hopsra)
(5 mg/ml), colistin (Sigma) (25 mg/ml), and vancomycin (Hopsra) (50 mg/ml)
in the drinking water for 3 days followed by 2 days of fresh water and a subse-
quent single intraperitoneal injection of clindamycin (Hopsra) (10 mg/kg) 1 day
prior to infection with 103–105 CFUs of vegetative C. difficile (strain VPI10643
ATCC 43255 and strain 630 ATCC BAA-1382) or 105 C. difficile spores (strain
VPI10643) via oral gavage. Vegetative C. difficile was obtained by overnight
culture of a plated single colony of C. difficile in anaerobic chopped meat broth
(Anaerobic Systems), followed by a subculture of 100 ml in the same media for
5 hr. Then 1 ml C. difficile in broth was pelleted, washed, quantified by spec-
trophotometer, resuspended to desired concentration in sterile PBS, and
given orally by gavage. Quantification of C. difficile inoculum was verified by
counting CFUs on anaerobic brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plates (Becton
Dickinson) supplemented with taurocholate (Sigma) (BHI-T). For spores,
mice were treated with a daily dose of 0.5 mg recombinant IL-25 protein
(BioLegend or R&D Systems) daily for 5 days prior to infection (Zaph et al.,
2008). In eosinophil-depleting experiments, mice received 20 mg monoclonal
anti-SiglecF (clone 238047, R&D Systems) or IgG isotype (clone 54447, R&D
Systems) on day �1 and day 1 of infection. For IL-4 neutralization experiments,
mice received 1 mg anti-IL4 (clone 11B11, University of Virginia Lymphocyte
Culture Center) monoclonal antibody or isotype control on day �1 and day 1
of infection. Post-infected mice were assessed for mortality rates and
morbidity-based clinical scores (weight loss, hair ruffling, ocular discharge, ac-
tivity, posture, and diarrhea severity) determined by scorer blinded to experi-
mental conditions (Warren et al., 2012).
C. difficile Quantification
Cecal contents were suspended in sterile, anaerobic PBS and serially diluted.
Bacterial burden was determined by quantification of CFUs grown anaerobi-
cally on BHI-T and 23 C. difficile supplement (Sigma) (BHIS-T) agar plates.
Toxins A/B were quantified using the ELISA C. difficile TOX A/B II kit (Techlab).
Both CFU and toxin levels were normalized to stool weight.
Isolation of LP and Flow Cytometry
LP and epithelial cells in the colon were separated as previously described
(Madan et al., 2014). Briefly, the colon was removed, cut longitudinally, and
rinsed in a Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), 5% fetal calf serum (FCS),
215 25 mM HEPES buffer. The tissue was incubated in pre-warmed buffer con-
sisting of HBSS, 15 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, 10% FCS 217, and 1 mM DTT at
37�C on a shaking incubator for two 20-min cycles in fresh media to remove
the epithelial layer. The tissue was minced and incubated in prewarmed
RPMI containing 0.17 mg/ml liberase TL (Roche) and 30 mg/ml DNase (Roche)
for 40 min. After digestion, tissue was passed through 40- and 100-mm nylon
strainers, resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer,
and quantified for total cell numbers and cell viability using trypan blue cell
counting. Single-cell colonic LP cells were plated at 106 live cells per sample
and stained. After Fc blockade (anti-mouse CD16/32 TruStain, BioLegend),
cells were stained using monoclonal antibodies to markers: live/dead (Fixable
Viability Dye eFluor 506), CD11b-APC(M1/70), CD45-APC-Cy7(30-F11),
CD11c-BV421 (N418), Siglecf-PE(E50-2440), Ly6g-PeCy7(1A8), Ly6c-Fitc
(HK1.4) (BioLegend, Becton Dickinson, and eBioscience). For ex vivo intracel-
lular analysis, cells were incubated without stimulation for 3 hr with Golgiplug
(eBioscience) in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) + 5% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37�C. Following incubation, cells were stained with
the clones above and IL-4 (11B11, BD Biosciences) using the Fixation/Perme-
abilization Solution Kit (BD Biosciences). Data were acquired on a Becton
Dickinson LSRFortessa flow cytometry BD FACSDiva version 6 software (BD
Biosciences). Events (5 3 105–106) were collected and data were analyzed us-
ing FlowJo version 9.2 software (Tree Star). Cell populations were calculated
from total cells per colon and as a percentage of live cells.
Cytokine, IgA and IgG, and muc2 Analysis
Cecal tissue was flushed with sterile PBS and homogenized by bead beating
for 1 min in a buffer consisting of 1 M HEPES and HALT protease inhibitor
cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by a 30-min incubation on ice
and with an Triton X-100, HEPES, and HALT protease inhibitor cocktail-con-
taining buffer. Cytokine levels were evaluated by ELISA (IL-23, IL-25, IL-22,
IL-17A, IL-4, and IL-13 Duo-Set, R&D Systems). Cytokine protein expression
was normalized to total protein concentration generated from the Pierce
BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For epithelial cell and LP extrac-
tion, the above protocol was used. For IgA and IgG analysis, cecal contents
were diluted and analyzed by ELISA (Ready-SET-go, eBioscience). For
muc2 analysis, cecal tissue was flushed with sterile PBS and processed using
the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) and Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA was
reverse transcribed with Tetro cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline). Amplification of
muc2 was done using the Sensifast SYBR and fluorescein mix (Bioline) and
forward (TGCCCAGAGAGTTTGGAGAG) and reverse (CCTCACATGTGGT
CTGGTTG) primers. Gene expression was normalized to b-actin and GAPDH.

 Human and Mice Histology
Human biopsies were obtained from the University of Virginia Biorepository
and Tissue Research Facility. Tissue samples were provided from remnant
surgeries and researchers were blinded to patient identity. Patients with the
closest age match were chosen and a full description is provided in Table
S1. Positivity of CDI was based on the presence of C. difficile toxins in stool
samples of patients. CDI-negative tissues were derived from patients sus-
pected of various other intestinal diseases but confirmed negative for tissue
pathology upon biopsy analysis. Immunochemistry staining was performed
using the Dako Autostainer Universal System with a primary antibody directed
against IL-25 (R&D Systems). Scoring was done by four independent blinded
scorers and was based on intensity and abundance of IL-25 staining in LP cell
infiltrates. The staining scale was between 0 and 3. Mouse cecal tissue was ex-
tracted and fixed for 24 hr in Bouin’s solution (or Corony’s fixative for PAS
stain), washed, and stored in 70% ethanol. Tissue was processed and H&E
and PAS stained by the University of Virginia Research Histology core. Mouse
IL-25 (US Biological Life Sciences) staining was performed by the University of
Virginia Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility. Two independent blinded
scorers graded tissues based on five parameters (immune infiltrates, cellular
exudate, mucosal thickening, epithelial disruption, and edema) with individual
scales of 0–3 per parameter.
Statistical Analysis
Survival rates between groups were assessed using log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests. An ANOVA was used for differences
among multiple groups. Student’s t test (two-tailed) or Mann-Whitney test
was used to compare two groups. A p value below 0.05 was considered sig-
nificant. All statistical tests were done using GraphPad Prism software.
