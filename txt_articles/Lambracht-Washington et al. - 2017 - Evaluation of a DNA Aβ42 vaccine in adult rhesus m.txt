Abstract
Background: Aggregated amyloid-β peptide 1–42 (Aβ42), derived from the cellular amyloid precursor protein, is
one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although active immunization against Aβ42 peptide
was successful in AD mouse models and led to removal of plaques and improved memory, a similar clinical trial in
humans (Aβ42 peptide immunization with QS-21 adjuvant) was stopped in phase II, when 6% of the treated patients
developed encephalitis. Currently ongoing passive immunizations with the injection of preformed monoclonal
antibodies against different epitopes within the Aβ1–42 peptide, which do not lead to activation of the immune system,
have shown some effects in slowing AD pathology. Active DNA Aβ42 immunizations administered with the gene gun
into the skin are noninflammatory because they activate a different T-cell population (Th2) with different cytokine
responses eliciting a different humoral immune response. We present our findings in rhesus macaques that underwent
the DNA Aβ42 immunization via gene gun delivery into the skin.
Methods: Six rhesus monkeys received two different doses of a DNA Aβ42 trimer vaccine. The humoral immune
response was analyzed from blood throughout the study, and cellular immune responses were determined in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after three and six immunizations.
Results: DNA Aβ42 trimer immunization led to high titer antibody responses in the nonhuman primate (NHP) model.
Antibodies generated in the rhesus monkeys following DNA Aβ42 immunization detected amyloid plaques consisting
of human Aβ42 peptide in the brain of the triple-transgenic AD mouse model. T-cell responses showed no interferon
(IFN)-γ- and interleukin (IL)-17-producing cells from PBMCs in Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot assays after three immunization
time points. At six immunization time points, IFN-γ- and IL-17-producing cells were found in immunized animals as well as
in control animals and were thus considered nonspecific and not due to the immunization regimen. IFN-γ
and IL-17 secretion in response to Aβ42 peptide restimulation became undetectable after a 3-month rest period.
Conclusions: Intradermal DNA Aβ42 immunization delivered with the gene gun produces a high antibody response in
NHPs and is highly likely to be effective and safe in a clinical AD prevention trial in patients.

 Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by two patho-
logical hallmarks: (1) senile plaques consisting of aggregated
amyloid-β peptide 1–42 (Aβ42) and (2) neurofibrillary
tangles consisting of aggregated tau proteins. Immunother-
apy has the rationale that immunization induces an
immune response that is able to clear plaque and tangles,
which has high potential to treat these two hallmarks and
has been successful in mouse AD models [1–3].
In a first clinical trial in which full-length Aβ1–42
peptide was stopped in 2002 in phase II, when 6% of the
immunized patients developed meningoencephalitis that
was due to inflammatory T-cell responses likely caused
by the adjuvant, which was used to enhance the immune
response and antibody production [4–7]. The clinical
evaluations of the patients performed later showed that
immunizations with Aβ42 peptide initiated the produc-
tion of anti-Aβ42 antibodies and led to reduction of Aβ
levels in brain and lesser plaque counts in the immu-
nized
patients.
Furthermore,
the
level
of
amyloid
removal showed a clear relationship to the titers of anti-
Aβ42 antibodies present in the patients analyzed [8, 9].
Thus, Aβ42 immunotherapy and anti-Aβ antibodies
have high potential to be effective in the removal of
excess amyloid from the brain in patients with AD.
To avoid the inflammatory cellular side effects, large
numbers of ongoing clinical trials are using passive
immunizations
with
preformed
anti-Aβ
monoclonal
antibodies [10–16]. One of the most recent clinical trials
(of aducanumab in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
phase Ib randomized trial [16]) in patients with pro-
dromal or mild AD using a fully human monoclonal
antibody selectively targeting aggregated Aβ, including
soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils, showed that
following 1 year of monthly intravenous infusions of this
antibody, brain Aβ had been reduced in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the investigators
were able to show a slowing of clinical decline as mea-
sured by Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini Mental
State Examination scores. [16]. However, passive immu-
nizations carry different side effects, such as brain
microhemorrhage [17], which was also found in this re-
cent trial. Passive immunization is expensive, which
makes the distribution and availability to large patient
populations difficult. Active DNA immunization is in
general less expensive, and it has been shown by us and
others that DNA immunization into the skin results in
sufficient antibody responses and a noninflammatory
cellular immune response [18–28]. With recent progress
in this area of immunization in the clinic, DNA immuni-
zations are no longer restricted to preclinical studies in
rodents and veterinary practice [29–33].
The genome sequence of the rhesus macaque shares
about 93% of its sequence with the human genome and is
thus an evolutionarily close relative to humans. Successful
DNA Aβ42 immunization in a nonhuman primate (NHP)
model, the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), will thus
provide valuable information about the immune responses
and possible side effects if this type of immunotherapy is
given to human patients. We have previously shown that
DNA Aβ42 immunization was effective in eliciting an
antibody response in aged mice and rabbits [24, 34].
Our
working
hypothesis
is
that
when
DNA
Aβ42
immunization results in good antibody responses in the
rhesus monkey, it is highly likely that this vaccine will
result in a similar humoral immune response in humans
as well. DNA Aβ42 immunization in rhesus monkeys is
an important step prior to proceeding to a clinical trial.
Therefore, we tested our DNA Aβ42 vaccination protocol
in a group of adult rhesus macaques to show its effects on
the immune system, including the anticipated antibody
responses and unwanted cellular side effects. Positive
outcome measures derived from these experiments in-
dicative of effectiveness and safety are high antibody
titers (1:25,000) without accompanying inflammatory
interferon (IFN)-γ- and interleukin (IL)-17-producing
T-cell responses.
Methods
Animals and immunizations
Eight 6- to 10-year-old rhesus macaques (four females,
four males, weighing 4.5–11 kg) had been selected for
this study (Southwest National Primate Research Center,
San Antonio, TX, USA). The macaques had not been
used in any research studies prior to this study. During
the period of the study, the animals were housed in
groups of two and were monitored daily for signs of ill-
ness or distress. The macaques were randomly separated
in
two
groups
(three
animals/group).
One
group
received a high-dose immunization regimen of 16 μg of
DNA per immunization time point, and the other group
received a low-dose regimen of 8 μg of DNA per
immunization time point. Two animals served as con-
trols to evaluate responses in nonimmunized macaques.
The intradermal DNA immunizations with plasmid
DNA encoding Aβ42 trimer were performed into the
skin of the upper inner arm using the Helios gene gun
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). In brief,
DNA-coated gold particles were injected into the skin
with a helium pressure of 400 psi for a total of six
immunization time points. The first three immuniza-
tions were done in biweekly intervals, followed by three
vaccinations in monthly intervals. Three months follow-
ing these six immunizations, a final blood draw was per-
formed to analyze antibody half-life. The experimental
schedule is based on a possible schedule for treatment of
patients with early AD in a future clinical trial and is
illustrated in Fig. 1. The three initial immunizations in
Lambracht-Washington et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2017) 9:30

 biweekly intervals will initiate and boost an immune
response;
the
following
three
immunizations
in
monthly intervals will maintain and strengthen the
humoral
antibody
response.
Animal
use
for
this
study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and
Use
Committee
of
the
Texas
Biomedical
Research Institute.
Antibodies and peptides
The anti-Aβ42 immune response was measured with
a panel of antimonkey immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM,
and
IgA
antibodies
(Rockland
Immunochemicals,
Limerick, PA, USA) and antihuman IgG, IgG1, IgG2,
and IgG4 antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). An unlabeled rhesus monkey IgG antibody
(SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) was used as
a standard antibody to determine the anti-Aβ IgG
immune response. Aβ peptides and other peptides
used in this study had been purchased from rPeptide
(Bogart, GA, USA), AnaSpec (Fremont, CA, USA),
New England Peptide (Gardner, MA, USA), Bachem
(Bubendorf,
Switzerland),
and
American
Peptide
Company (Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Plasma collections
Blood was collected prior to the first immunization;
after the second, third, fourth, and fifth immuniza-
tions; and 2 and 8 weeks past the sixth immunization.
Antibody
levels
were
determined
from
all
blood
samples. Blood chemistry and complete blood count
(CBC) were determined from samples prior to the
first immunization, after the fourth immunization,
and from blood samples drawn 8 weeks past the fifth
immunization. Lymphocytes from blood were isolated
by density separation centrifugation using Lympholyte®
Mammal Cell Separation Media (Cedarlane, Burlington,
ON, Canada). Tissue culture was performed as previously
described [22–24].
Antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Aggregated Aβ1–42 peptide was prepared as described
previously [19]. Briefly, the peptide was prepared by
adding 250 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, to 1 mg of lyophilized
Aβ1–42 (counterion trifluoroacetic acid), followed by
an overnight incubation at 37 °C. Anti-Aβ antibodies
in rhesus plasma were measured according to stand-
ard
procedures.
High-binding
96-well
plates
were
coated
with
human
Aβ1–42
peptide
(2
μg/ml)
in
50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C.
Standard curves were included by binding of serial
dilutions of an unlabeled rhesus monkey IgG antibody
to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
plates.
Plasma
samples
were
diluted
1:400
and
analyzed in triplicates. ELISAs were repeated three or
four times, and data from one representative ELISA
for the different time points are shown.
ELISAs for antibody titers in rhesus monkey plasma
were performed according to standard procedures.
The titers of antibodies were calculated as the recip-
rocal of the highest serum dilution that gave a read-
ing twice the baseline of a 450-nm optical density
(OD450) of 0.2. Plasma samples were serially diluted
up to 1:50,000 from an initial dilution of 1:100.
Secondary isotype antibodies used had been cross-
adsorbed with rhesus IgG, IgA, or IgM, respectively
(Rockland Immunochemicals).
For the antibody epitope studies, all Aβ peptides
(1–42, 1–16, 6–20, 17–31, 22–35, 23–42) were used
in 1 μM dilutions to compensate for the different
lengths of the amino acid sequences and the number
of epitopes available on the ELISA plate for the anti-
body binding. Epitope binding of IgG, IgA, and IgM
antibody isotypes was analyzed.
For the antibody specificity studies, peptides (Aβ1–42,
scrambled Aβ42, islet amyloid peptide 22–27, tau275–305,
ovalbumin
[OVA265–280],
prion
protein
[Prp106–140],
serum amyloid P component [SAP], and tetanus toxin
[TTX830–844]) were used in dilutions of 2 μg/ml. Binding

 of IgG and IgA antibodies was analyzed from plasma
samples diluted 1:500.
Cytokine Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot and ELISA assays
Enzyme-Linked
ImmunoSpot
(ELISPOT)
assays
to
determine frequencies of cytokine-secreting cells were
performed according to standard procedures and as
previously described using commercial available anti-
body sets for rhesus and human IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-4
(Mabtech, Stockholm, Sweden) [21–23]. For maximal
T-cell stimulation, concanavalin A (ConA; 2.5 μg/ml) or
an antirhesus CD3 antibody (Mabtech) were used in
48-h cultures. IFN-γ concentrations from cell culture
supernatants were measured using a commercially avail-
able rhesus monkey IFN-γ ELISA kit (Mabtech).
Analysis of cell proliferation by carboxyfluorescein
succinimidyl ester dilution
Cells for labeling were resuspended in PBS and im-
mediately mixed with an equal volume of carboxyflu-
orescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) diluted in PBS
(1:1). The cells were incubated for 5 minutes at room
temperature
with repeated mixing to obtain even
CFSE labeling of all cells. The labeling was stopped
by
adding
an
equal
volume
of
complete
RPMI
medium and removal of the solution from the cells
by centrifugation. The cells were plated in round-
bottomed 96-well cell culture plates at concentrations
of 1 × 106 cells per well and restimulated with Aβ42
peptide, anti-CD3, or ConA for 6 days. After being
harvested, cells were resuspended in
fluorescence-
activated cell sorting buffer (PBS/1% bovine serum
albumin/0.1% NaN3) and stained with an allophycocyanin-
labeled mouse antihuman CD4 antibody or phycoerythrin-
cyanine 7-conjugated mouse antihuman CD8 antibody
(Tonbo Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Fluorescence of
the cells was measured using a BD Accuri C6 Plus flow
cytometer and analyzed with CFlow Plus (BD Biosciences).
Immunohistochemistry of mouse brain
Brain sections of triple-transgenic (3xTg)-AD mice were
stained with plasma samples derived from the DNA of
Aβ42-immunized
rhesus
monkeys
and
the
control
monoclonal antibody 6E10 (mouse antihuman Aβ42).
For antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated in 70%
formic acid prior to staining. Brain sections were incu-
bated with the plasma samples (dilution 1:20) overnight
at 4 °C. Antibody binding was detected with an HRP-
conjugated rabbit antimonkey IgG antibody, which was
detected with a Poly-HRP tertiary antibody followed by
Alexa
Fluor
488-tyramide
signal
amplification
(Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sections were coun-
terstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images
were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Scan slide scanner and
analyzed with the Zen lite software package (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy, Jena, Germany).
Statistics
For statistics (unpaired t test with two-tailed p values,
Mann-Whitney u test, column statistics) we used Prism for
Windows version 6 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA). p Values ≤0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Blood work
Blood from the eight animals used in this study was ana-
lyzed before the first vaccination, following the fourth
vaccination, and 12 weeks past the sixth vaccination for
signs of inflammation (CBC) or signs of metabolic
changes (blood chemistry). No changes were observed
(data not shown).
Evaluation of the injection sites
DNA Aβ42 injection via gene gun was delivered to the
shaved skin area of the axillae. Adverse effects (redness,
itching, and inflammation) were not observed in the
immunized animals following the six immunization time
points. The characteristic appearance of the skin injec-
tion sites is shown for two macaques in Fig. 2. Pictures
were taken 14 days after the second immunization prior
to the third immunization time point. Shown are the
upper inner arms and arm axillae from two animals.

 consisting of 8 or 16 μg of DNA. These doses were
extrapolated from our previous studies in mouse models
and increased respectively based on the larger body size.
We also used the 8- or 16-μg DNA doses in another set
of experiments in which we analyzed the immune re-
sponses to DNA Aβ42 immunization in aged New
Zealand White rabbits [34]. Antibody levels and total
antibody amounts were measured for anti-Aβ42 anti-
bodies of the IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes. In blood
samples
taken
prior
to
the
first
immunizations,
baseline
levels
of
anti-Aβ42
antibody
levels
were
found (36.46 ± 16.24 μg/ml plasma, n = 8). Antibody
levels increased to mean antibody levels of 46.78 ±
13.41 μg/ml plasma after three immunizations (p =
0.0383),
to
114.2 ± 41.62
μg/ml
plasma
after
five
immunizations, and to 119.4 ± 32.55 μg/ml plasma
after six immunizations (Fig. 3a). No significant differ-
ences were found between the low-dose group (8 μg
of DNA per immunization) and the high-dose group
(16 μg of DNA per immunization) (Fig. 3b). Antibody
levels declined slightly to 99.53 ± 50.09 μg/ml (n = 6,
p = 0.558) after a resting period of 3 months following
the sixth immunization, so that the antibody half-life
can be estimated as 4 months.
Antibody titers for anti-Aβ42 IgG and IgA antibodies
were determined from blood drawn after the sixth
immunization time point. Plasma dilutions of 1:100 to
1:51,200 were tested for binding to Aβ42 peptide. The
comparison with antibody levels prior to the immuniza-
tions is indicated by the green line in Fig. 4, and the
comparison with antibody levels after two immuniza-
tions is indicated by the red line. Final antibody titers
were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum
dilution that gave a reading twice the baseline of an
OD450 of 0.2. Both antibody isotypes showed titers greater
than 1:20,000; a titer of 25,600 ± 14,022 was found for
anti-Aβ42 IgG antibody, and a titer of 23,467 ± 14,964 was
measured for anti-Aβ42 IgA antibody (Fig. 4).
Antibody isotypes and epitopes
The humoral immune response consists of four antibody
isotypes: IgM, IgG, IgE, and IgA. Among the four IgG
subclasses in humans, rhesus monkeys possess three of
them: IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4. We analyzed the binding of
antibody isotypes IgM, IgG, and IgA to Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42
peptides as well as to a panel of truncated Aβ42 peptides
(Aβ3–42,
Aβ4–42,
Aβ5–42,
and
Aβ11–42).

 antibodies of all three isotypes were produced upon DNA
Aβ42 vaccination in the rhesus monkeys (Fig. 5a).
High binding to Aβ3–42 and Aβ4–42 was observed for
anti-Aβ42 IgG antibodies to Aβ3–42 and Aβ4–42, as well
as good binding to Aβ5–42 and Aβ11–42. Antibodies of
the IgA isotype bound similarly but less strongly to the
truncated Aβx–42 peptides. Good antibody binding to the
truncated Aβ42 peptides was found for anti-Aβ anti-
bodies of the IgM isotype (Fig. 5b). Next, we studied the
development of the different isotype immune responses in

 the rhesus monkeys. Differences were found between the
sexes of animals, with higher antibody responses seen in
the females (Fig. 5c). Between the third and fourth immu-
nizations, a strong boost of antibody production was
found with highly increased levels of anti-Aβ42 antibodies
of the IgG isotype. Anti-Aβ42 antibodies of the IgA
isotype
increased
only
slightly
at
the
fourth
immunization time point, but a large boost of an IgA
antibody
response
was
found
with
the
sixth
immunization. Antibody levels of all isotypes declined
with the 3-month rest period, with a larger decline
seen in the male monkeys.
For characterization of the linear anti-Aβ-specific
B-cell epitopes, we used a panel of shorter Aβ peptides
spanning the Aβ1–42 sequence: Aβ1–16, Aβ6–20, Aβ10–26,
Aβ17–31, Aβ22–35, and Aβ23–42. In a direct ELISA,
antibody binding of the IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes
to the shorter Aβ peptides was determined from
blood samples following the third, fourth, and sixth
immunizations
and
in
the
blood
samples
drawn
12 weeks past the sixth immunization (rested state)
(Fig. 6). Consistent with the strong boost of antibody
production
following
the
fourth
immunization,
antibody binding to full-length Aβ1–42 as well as the
different linear Aβ peptides increased, showing strong
reactivity
to
all
the
shorter
epitopes
and
highest
binding of IgG antibodies to the midregion epitope
Aβ17–31 (Fig. 6b). With the sixth immunization, a
clear boost of IgA antibodies was detected again, with
the highest binding to full-length Aβ1–42 and the mid-
region peptide Aβ17–31 (Fig. 6c). IgM antibodies in
blood samples from monkeys immunized six times
with DNA Aβ42 bound strongly to full-length Aβ1–42
and Aβ6–20. With the 3-months rest period following
the
sixth
immunization,
antibody
binding
of
all
isotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and to all Aβ epitopes
declined (Fig. 6d).
Antibody specificity was tested by comparing the
binding of antibodies in plasma from the immunized
rhesus monkeys to Aβ1–42 peptide, scrambled Aβ1–42
peptide,
islet
amyloid
protein
peptide
(IAPP22–27),
SAP, Prp106–140, tau peptide repeat 2 domain (275–
305),
TTX830–844,
OVA257–264,
OVA265–280,
and
OVA323–339. Very low binding was found for the
scrambled Aβ1–42 peptide, which is the optimal nega-
tive control owing to the presence of all amino acids
present in Aβ1–42 in a randomly altered sequence. It
showed
that
the
specific
amino
acid
sequence
is
critical for antibody binding (p values of 0.0008 for
IgG plasma antibodies and 0.0001 for IgA plasma
antibodies in comparison to binding to Aβ1–42 by
Mann-Whitney t test) (Fig. 7). Amino acid sequences
for the two peptides, Aβ1–42 and scrambled Aβ1–42
are illustrated in Fig. 7. Similar low binding was
found for IgG and IgA antibodies in plasma from the
immunized animals to IAPP, SAP, Prp, and TTX pep-
tides (p values ranging from 0.0002 to 0.0415 in the com-
parison of binding to Aβ1–42) (Fig. 7). High binding was
found for plasma antibodies of IgG and IgA isotypes to all
OVA peptides tested (data not shown; only OVA265–280 is
shown in Fig. 7). A literature search showed that
blood of 90% of adult human donors contained IgG
antibodies against OVA as a food-derived antigen
[35], which might explain the high level of cross-
reactivity observed.
Analyses of T-cell responses in the immunized rhesus
macaques: cytokines and proliferation
IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-4 secretion was determined by an
ELISPOT assay for all of the animals (n = 8) 1 month fol-
lowing the third immunization and 3 weeks following
the sixth immunization from peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMCs). After the third immunization,
no IFN-γ-, IL-17-, or IL-4-secreting cells were de-
tected after Aβ42 peptide restimulation, whereas high
numbers of spots were found in wells that had been
stimulated with ConA or anti-monkey CD3 (Fig. 8a
and data not shown). Further T-cell responses were
determined in the six immunized and two control an-
imals
3
weeks
following
the
sixth
DNA
Aβ1–42
immunization by ELISPOT assays for IFN-γ, IL-17,
and IL-4 (Fig. 8b) and a CFSE proliferation assay with
PBMCs (Fig. 9). Increased numbers of IFN-γ-, IL-17-,
and IL-4-secreting cells were found in all the animals,
including the control animals, which had not been
immunized. The number of IFN-γ-secreting cells was
highly significant in all monkeys except one, including
the control animals (p < 0.05, p < 0.005, p < 0.0001).
One of the control animals actually had the highest
number of IFN-γ-secreting cells (253.3 ± 37.23 spots/
106 cells). Similarly, the numbers of IL-17 secreting
cells was elevated. A significant increase was found
for one of the immunized rhesus macaques (p =
0.0269) and for one of the control animals (p = 0.001).
The
number
of
IL-4-secreting
cells
was
also
significantly increased in all the animals except one
(p < 0.05 and p < 0.005) (Fig. 8b). No proliferation of
CD4 or CD8 T cells was found in the wells that had
been restimulated with Aβ42 peptide for 6 days
(Fig.
9).
Good
proliferation
was
found
for
the
PBMCs in the control wells of each rhesus macaque
that had been restimulated with ConA or an anti-
CD3 antibody, confirming the viability of the cells.
Cytokine secretion after Aβ42 peptide restimula-
tion was again examined 3 months following the
sixth
immunization
(Fig.
10a–d).

significant
increase was found for the numbers of IL-17- and

the viability of the cells in culture (Fig. 10c). IFN-γ

induced IFN-γ secretion was found (Fig. 10d). One
animal (30633) had higher levels of IFN-γ in the cell
culture supernatant in the medium control wells as
well as in the Aβ42 peptide-restimulated well. Owing
to the higher levels already in the control super-
natant
and

in

Antibodies generated in rhesus macaques bind to
amyloid plaques in an AD mouse model
The specificity of the antibody response in the DNA
Aβ42-immunized rhesus monkeys was further tested for
staining of senile plaques containing human Aβ42 in an
AD mouse model. The staining of brain sections from a
3xTg-AD
mouse
[B6;129-Psen1tm1Mpm
Tg(APPSwe,-
tauP301L)1Lfa/Mmjax;
The Jackson Laboratory,
Bar
Harbor, ME, USA] with plasma from the monkeys that
had received DNA Aβ42 immunizations showed clear
staining in the typical area in which amyloid plaques are
present in this AD mouse model: the subiculum of the
hippocampus (Fig. 11a). In the comparison with a
commercial
anti-Aβ42
antibody
(6E10,
shown
in
Fig. 11b), the stained areas are overlapping. No staining
was found in a brain section that was stained only with
the secondary antibody and detection reagents (Fig. 11c).
Thus, antibodies generated in the immunized rhesus
monkeys upon DNA Aβ42 vaccination detected human
Aβ42 in brains of the AD mouse model.
Discussion
DNA Aβ42 trimer immunization with a two-plasmid
system delivered via gene gun into the skin led to good
antibody responses in the rhesus monkey. The results
described in this report were very similar to the find-
ings we published for experiments with mice (wild-
type and AD mouse models) and rabbits [18–25, 34].
The anti-Aβ42 IgG antibody levels produced in the
six
monkeys
reached
mean
values
of
120
μg/ml
plasma after six immunizations, as well as mean
antibody titers of 1:25,000. The antibody half-life was
estimated as 4 months. The data show that intrader-
mal DNA Aβ42 immunization is a successful route to
trigger an antibody response against a self-antigen in
large mammals. In regard to the antibody titers found
in this study, it is important to note that antibody
titers of 1:2000 found in patients in the AN1792
clinical trial had been shown to be sufficient for re-
moval of Aβ from the brain and significant reduction
of the plaque load [8]. Thus, the antibody levels
found here following DNA Aβ42 immunization in
rhesus macaques (1:25,000) are highly likely to be
effective for removal of amyloid from the brain in
patients with AD.

immunization time point of the six immunized rhesus monkeys were tested for binding to a variety of different peptides (Aβ1–42, scrambled Aβ1–42,
islet amyloid protein [IAPP], serum amyloid P component [SAP], prion protein fragments [Prp], tau peptide repeat 2 domain, tetanus toxin peptide
[TTX], ovalbumin peptides [OVA]). Plasma was diluted 1:500 for these assays. In the comparison of binding to Aβ1–42, significant differences were found
for binding of immunoglobulin G (IgG; blue bars) and IgA (red bars) antibodies in plasma to the distinct peptides tested (indicated by *, **, *** p values
above the bars). Differences in IgG and IgA antibody binding in plasma samples from the immunized monkeys to nonrelated OVA peptides compared
with binding to Aβ1–42 were nonsignificant (Mann-Whitney p values of 0.1246 and 0.5532, respectively). OD450 450-nm Optical density

 isoforms, and should thus be efficient also in removing
N-truncated Aβx–42 species for which it had been shown
in a case study that they remained in brains from
patients who had received the AN1792 Aβ42 peptide
vaccine producing antibodies mainly against the B-cell
epitope in Aβ1–42, which is Aβ1–15 [36, 37].
In work done at a different laboratory where re-
searchers developed an epitope vaccine containing three
copies of Aβ1–11 with inclusion of eight nonself T-helper
epitopes into the DNA construct (3 × -Aβ1–11-Thep),
two groups of monkeys received three intramuscular
immunizations with 0.4 mg and 4 mg of the DNA
vaccine, and antibody titers of 1:2500 (0.4 mg) and
1:6000 (4 mg) were found [26]. Intramuscular DNA
immunization
compared
with
intradermal
DNA
immunization uses much higher doses of DNA and is
considered more prone to cellular and potentially in-
flammatory immune responses. Cellular anti-Aβ42 im-
mune responses were not found in this vaccine, because it
contains only the B-cell epitope, but high doses of

 DNA were used to mount an antibody response.
This group optimized the vaccine, and in a second
group of immunized macaques receiving the opti-
mized vaccine, mean antibody titers reached 1:6050
and 1:9680 (week 50), respectively, which declined
quickly in the following 10 weeks (week 60, 1:1375
and 1:3190, respectively [27]). Monkeys immunized
with the epitope vaccine study produced only IgG
antibodies, which is likely due to the lack of T-cell
help during the generation of an antigen-specific im-
mune response.
In a study done at another laboratory, the analyses
of groups of aged (10–26 years old) and juvenile (1–2
years old) macaques, which had received a total of
five Aβ42 peptide (100 μg/time point) immunizations
with monophosphoryl lipid A as an adjuvant, it was
found that only the juvenile animals developed a
strong and sustained antibody response [38]. Despite
the low levels of antibodies in the aged animals, the
analysis of cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 levels showed a
positive correlation between Aβ42 and anti-Aβ42 anti-
body levels, which was significant for the subgroup of
aged animals but not for the subgroup of juvenile
animals. The findings imply that even with a low
antibody
response
upon
Aβ42
immunization,
the
effects on Aβ42 removal from the brain are measur-
able. The adult cohort (6–10 years old) analyzed in
this study developed a strong antibody response in all
animals, and we predict, on the basis of data derived
from the use of this immunization protocol in aged
mice and rabbits, that DNA Aβ42 immunization will
also lead to strong humoral immune responses in
patients with AD [24, 34].
The strong IgA antibody response found in our study
and in our previous analysis to the immune responses in
New Zealand White rabbits [34] was unexpected. In a
different DNA immunization approach in which rhesus
monkeys received a protective DNA vaccine against sim-
ian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection, which was

 antibodies was found [39, 40]. DNA doses were 20 μg of
DNA/immunization/animal, and the mean SIV gp120-
specific antibody titer for all monkeys following the
fourth DNA dose was 1:9142. Even though this is a
completely different approach and intended to induce a
mucosal immune response, the comparison with this
study is of interest for two reasons: one is the finding of
high levels of IgA antibodies, and the second is the
comparison of antibody titers. Considering that the
immunization with a plasmid DNA encoding a virus
protein (SIV/17E-Fr gag-pol-env), which is a foreign and
pathogenic antigen, resulted in an antibody titer of
1:10,000, which was protective in the macaques against
SIV infection, and an antibody titer of 1:25,000 against a
self-antigen (Aβ1–42), presented in our study, is indica-
tive of a good immune response.
During the humoral antibody responses, antibody class
switch recombination (CSR) to produce antibodies with
the IgA isotype is controlled by cytokine signals. The
major cytokine signal for α-CSR is transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β together with additional contributions
from IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 [41]. Importantly,
the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 are all indicative of a
Th2 immune response, and IL-10 and TGF-β are
produced by regulatory immune cells, which is consist-
ent with our previous findings demonstrating a Th2/
regulatory T-cell immune response following DNA Aβ42
immunization in the mouse model [20–24].
No cytokine secretion was found after three immu-
nizations in rhesus monkeys that had received the
MultiTEP-Aβ epitope vaccine (Vaxine Pty, Adelaide,
Australia) [26], which is consistent with the findings
in
our
study
using
a
full-length
DNA
vaccine.
Elevated
cytokine
levels
were
found
at
the
sixth
immunization time point in our study, but they were
considered nonspecific because the control animals
had increased numbers of cytokine-producing cells as
well. In the parallel analyses of T-cell proliferation, no
proliferation of CD4 or CD8 T cells was found for
cells that had been restimulated with Aβ42 peptide.
This lack of T-cell proliferation in response to peptide
restimulation
is
a
second argument
that the
low
though significantly increased numbers of cytokine-
secreting cells were not in response to the Aβ42
peptide restimulation, and thus nonspecific. The num-
bers of IL-17-secreting cells went down again after a
3-month rest period, and no IFN-γ was found in
Aβ42
peptide-restimulated
PBMC
cultures
at
this
time point. Altogether, we conclude that DNA Aβ42
immunization does not lead to inflammatory T-cell
responses
in
NHPs,
similar
to
our
previously
described results in mice and in rabbits [20–24, 34].

 Conclusions
DNA Aβ42 immunization led to a good humoral immune
response in rhesus macaques that had received a total of
six immunizations. High titers of anti-Aβ42 IgG and IgA
antibodies were found, which might complement each
other in their effect to remove excess amyloid from the
brain. Anti-Aβ antibodies produced after DNA Aβ42
immunization detect a wide variety of epitopes on the
Aβ1–42
peptide,
including
N-terminal
truncated
Aβ
isoforms.
Antibodies
produced
after
DNA
Aβ42
immunization
in
rhesus
monkeys
are
Aβ42-specific
because low binding to a panel of distinct peptides tested
was found. Anti-Aβ antibodies produced after DNA Aβ42
immunization detect plaques consisting of Aβ peptides of
human type in the brain of an AD mouse model. No indi-
cations for an inflammatory cellular immune response
(IFN-γ and IL-17) were observed in mice [20–24], rabbits
[34], or NHPs as shown in our study. On the basis of these
data, we predict a positive outcome, with good humoral
immune responses and no inflammation, in patients with
early AD in a clinical trial using full-length DNA Aβ42
trimer vaccination.
