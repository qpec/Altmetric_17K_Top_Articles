 Diagnosis and Management 
of Gastroesophageal Reflux 
in Preterm Infants
Eric C. Eichenwald, MD, FAAP, COMMITTEE ON FETUS AND NEWBORN
Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), generally defined as the passage of gastric 
contents into the esophagus, is an almost universal phenomenon in 
preterm infants. It is a common diagnosis in the NICU; however, there is 
large variation in its treatment across NICU sites. In this clinical report, the 
physiology, diagnosis, and symptomatology in preterm infants as well as 
currently used treatment strategies in the NICU are examined. Conservative 
measures to control reflux, such as left lateral body position, head elevation, 
and feeding regimen manipulation, have not been shown to reduce clinically 
assessed signs of GER in the preterm infant. In addition, preterm infants 
with clinically diagnosed GER are often treated with pharmacologic agents; 
however, a lack of evidence of efficacy together with emerging evidence of 
significant harm (particularly with gastric acid blockade) strongly suggest 
that these agents should be used sparingly, if at all, in preterm infants.

INTRODUCTION
Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), generally defined as the passage of gastric 
contents into the esophagus, 
1 is an almost universal phenomenon in 
preterm infants. The normal physiologic occurrence of GER in infants 
can be distinguished from pathologic GER disease, which includes 
troublesome symptoms or complications associated with GER.2 GER 
occurs commonly in infants, in part because of relatively large volumes 
ingested during feeding and supine positioning, which frequently place 
the gastroesophageal junction in a liquid environment. Whether GER 
becomes clinically significant depends on both the quality (eg, degree 
of acidity) and quantity of reflux3, 
 
4 as well as potential injury to the 
esophageal mucosa. GER is a common diagnosis in the NICU; however, 
there is as much as a 13-fold variation in its diagnosis and treatment 
across sites.5, 
 
6 Preterm infants who are diagnosed with GER have longer 
hospital stays and higher hospital costs than infants without GER, 
5, 
 
7, 
 
8 
making it an important clinical phenomenon in the NICU.

 GER in preterm infants is most often 
diagnosed and treated on the basis 
of clinical and behavioral signs 
rather than on specific testing to 
prove or disprove pathology, 
6 and 
many infants continue to be treated 
after they are discharged from 
the hospital.9 However, evidence 
that GER causes harm in preterm 
infants is scant.10, 
 
11 Indeed, routine 
use of antireflux medications for 
the treatment of symptomatic GER 
in preterm infants was 1 of the 
therapies singled out as being of 
questionable value in the recent 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) Choosing Wisely campaign.12
In this clinical report, the following 
will be reviewed: (1) the physiology 
of GER in preterm infants, (2) 
methods for its diagnosis, (3) 
evidence that it is associated with 
the signs frequently attributed 
to GER, and (4) the safety and 
efficacy of nonpharmacologic and 
pharmacologic therapy.
PHYSIOLOGY
The primary mechanism of GER in 
preterm infants is transient lower 
esophageal sphincter relaxation 
(TLESR). TLESR is an abrupt reflex 
decrease in lower esophageal 
sphincter (LES) pressure to levels 
at or below intragastric pressure, 
unrelated to swallowing. Preterm 
infants have dozens of episodes of 
TLESR each day, 
13 many of which 
are associated with some degree 
of GER. As such, GER is a normal 
phenomenon in preterm infants, 
which is exacerbated by a pure 
liquid diet and age-specific body 
position.3 In addition, the presence 
of an indwelling gastric tube through 
the esophageal sphincter increases 
the frequency of GER, presumably 
secondary to impaired closure of the 
LES.14 Delayed gastric emptying does 
not appear to play a contributory 
role in GER in preterm infants, in that 
infants with symptomatic GER do 
not have delayed gastric emptying 
compared with other infants.15, 
16  
However, GER is more common 
immediately after a feeding, likely 
because of gastric distension.15 
Body position also influences TLESR 
and GER in preterm infants. Infants 
placed in the right-side-down lateral 
position after a feeding have more 
TLESR episodes and liquid reflux 
compared with the left-side-down 
lateral position, despite gastric 
emptying being enhanced in the 
right lateral position.17, 
 
18 Prone 
position also decreases episodes of 
GER versus supine position, likely 
because of more optimal positioning 
of the LES relative to the distended 
stomach.17
Mechanisms to protect the esophagus 
and airway from GER appear to be 
intact in the preterm infant. These 
include reflex forward peristalsis 
of the esophagus in response to 
distention from refluxate in the lower 
esophagus with closure of the upper 
esophageal sphincter to prevent 
refluxate reaching the pharynx. 
Despite these mechanisms, if refluxed 
material does reach the upper 
esophagus, the upper esophageal 
sphincter will reflexively open to 
allow the material into the pharynx, 
which results in the frequent 
episodes of “spitting” or emesis 
observed in infants.
DIAGNOSIS
Several methods have been used 
to diagnose GER in the preterm 
population, including contrast 
fluoroscopy, pH monitoring, and 
multichannel intraesophageal 
impedance (MII) monitoring. 
Although contrast fluoroscopy can 
be used to show episodes of reflux, 
it cannot be used to differentiate 
clinically significant GER from 
insignificant GER. Monitoring of 
pH in the lower esophagus has 
classically been used to diagnose GER 
in older children and adults. Reflux 
of acidic gastric contents results in 
transient periods of acidity in the 
lower esophagus. Common measures 
obtained from pH probe monitoring 
include the total number of reflux 
episodes, the duration of the longest 
reflux episode, and the “reflux 
index” (RI), which is the percentage 
of the total recording time with an 
esophageal pH <4. In pH studies, an 
RI >7% is considered abnormal, an 
RI <3% considered normal, and RIs 
between 3% and 7% are considered 
indeterminate.2 However, labeling 
a study “abnormal” does not prove 
that it is causing the symptoms in 
question.
Measurement of esophageal pH is not 
a reliable method to diagnose GER 
in preterm infants19 because their 
stomach pH is rarely <4 owing to 
frequent milk feedings and a higher 
baseline pH. In addition, abnormal 
esophageal pH does not correlate 
well with symptom severity.20 Other 
measures that have been investigated 
include the presence of pepsin in 
saliva21 and the pH of oropharyngeal 
secretions.22 Although these 
measures may correlate with acidic 
reflux, it is unknown whether they 
correlate with symptom severity.
Currently, the most accurate method 
for detecting GER is MII monitoring, 
which is frequently combined with 
simultaneous measurement of 
pH.2 MII can be used to track the 
movement of fluids, solids, and air 
in the esophagus by measuring 
changes in electrical impedance 
between multiple electrodes along 
an esophageal catheter. MII can be 
used to discern whether a fluid bolus 
is traveling antegrade (swallow) or 
retrograde (reflux) in the esophagus 
and can be used to determine the 
height of the retrograde bolus. It is a 
reliable and reproducible technique 
for diagnosing GER in preterm 
infants14 and can be combined with 
a pH sensor to determine if GER is 
acidic, mildly acidic, or alkaline.  
López-Alonso et al23 measured 
24-hour MII and pH in 26 healthy 
preterm infants with a median 
postmenstrual age of 32 weeks.

Downloaded from 
 The median number of reflux episodes 
recorded in 24 hours was 71; 25.4% 
were acidic, 72.9% were weakly 
acidic, and 2.7% were alkaline. Of 
note, the gastric pH was higher than 4 
for almost 70% of the recording time. 
Not surprisingly, periods of feeding 
were associated with a higher number 
of total reflux events per hour.
In practice, GER is diagnosed most 
often in infants on the basis of 
clinical and behavioral signs and/or 
response to a trial of pharmacologic 
or nonpharmacologic interventions.6 
Signs attributed to GER include 
feeding intolerance, poor growth, 
apnea, desaturation and bradycardia, 
and worsening pulmonary disease 
as well as nonspecific behavioral 
signs including arching, irritability, 
and apparent discomfort associated 
with feedings. There is no evidence, 
however, that these signs are 
temporally associated with measured 
GER episodes.20, 
 
24, 
 
25 In 1 study of 
40 preterm and 18 term infants 
evaluated with combined MII/pH 
testing for a clinical suspicion of 
GER, signs (including irritability, 
bradycardia and desaturations, or 
feeding intolerance) were rarely 
associated with documented reflux 
events.20 In another study of 14 
healthy preterm infants, Snel et al24 
recorded both esophageal pH and 
infant behaviors. General behavior 
scores did not change during 
esophageal acidification episodes. 
In addition, infants frequently 
demonstrated behaviors ascribed 
to GER (apparent discomfort, 
head retraction, and “mouthing”) 
unrelated to pH-documented 
GER episodes. In these results, it 
is suggested that preterm infant 
behaviors commonly ascribed to 
reflux are, in reality, not associated 
with GER and that treatment should 
not be based solely on clinical signs.
GER IN THE PRETERM INFANT
Several clinical conditions are thought 
to be associated with GER in the 
preterm infant, although analyses are 
hampered because most cases of GER 
are diagnosed clinically.
Apnea, Desaturation, and 
Bradycardia
Preterm infants have a hyperreactive 
laryngeal response to chemoreceptor 
stimulation that precipitates apnea 
or bradycardia. In addition, as 
previously noted, almost all preterm 
infants have some GER. These 2 
observations have led to speculation 
that GER can precipitate apnea, 
oxygen desaturation, and bradycardia 
episodes in preterm infants and that 
pharmacologic treatment of GER 
might decrease the incidence or 
severity of these events.26 However, 
researchers examining the timing of 
reflux episodes in relation to apneic 
events have found that they are 
rarely temporally related14, 
 
27 and 
that GER does not prolong or worsen 
apnea.28 In 1 study, small amounts 
of normal saline were infused into 
the pharynx of sleeping preterm 
infants at term-equivalent age. The 
investigators found that swallow 
frequency increased, but apnea did 
not occur, 
29 and they suggested that 
apnea is provoked when the larynx, 
not the pharynx, is stimulated. The 
larynx is not usually stimulated by 
reflux of small amounts of liquid. 
Finally, there is no evidence that 
pharmacologic treatment of GER  
with agents that decrease gastric 
acidity or promote gastrointestinal 
motility decrease the risk of 
recurrent apnea or bradycardia  
in preterm infants.30, 
 
31
Respiratory Disease and 
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
Proving a causal relationship 
between GER and respiratory 
symptoms in children has been 
difficult. Suggested methods of 
diagnostics, such as GER scintigraphy 
and the presence of lipid-laden 
macrophages in bronchoalveolar 
lavage, lack specificity32 or correlate 
poorly with esophageal impedance 
and fail to differentiate reflux-related 
aspiration from primary aspiration 
from above.33 In 1 study, children 
with a heterogeneous array of 
chronic lung problems who had 
documented GER had higher 
concentrations of pepsin and 
inflammatory interleukins in their 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than 
those without GER, suggesting 
microaspiration may contribute to 
their lung disease.34
It is not clear whether GER 
causes “silent” microaspiration 
in mechanically ventilated 
preterm infants that worsens lung 
disease, particularly in infants 
with developing or established 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
(BPD). In 1 study, it was reported 
that pepsin was detected in 93% of 
tracheal aspirates obtained from 
intubated preterm infants during 
the first postnatal month, 
35 and in 
addition, that ventilated preterm 
infants who developed BPD had 
higher levels of tracheal aspirate 
pepsin than those who did not. In 
addition, these investigators reported 
that increased concentrations 
of pepsin were associated with 
increased severity of BPD36 and 
speculated that chronic aspiration 
of gastric contents may contribute 
to the development of BPD. 
However, these results should be 
interpreted with caution because 
of emerging data on the low 
sensitivity and specificity of pepsin in 
bronchoalveolar lavage assays for the 
detection of GER-related aspiration.37
In contrast, Akinola et al38 reported 
no relationship between the 
diagnosis of BPD and the clinical 
diagnosis of GER confirmed by 
esophageal pH monitoring.38 In a 
small study comparing combined 
MII and pH monitoring in 12 infants 
with BPD and 34 without who were 
evaluated for clinical signs believed 
to be attributable to GER, infants 
with BPD had a similar number of 
documented reflux events as infants 
without BPD.25 In both groups, fewer 
than 10% of the documented reflux

 events were temporally associated 
with reflux symptoms as assessed 
by nursing observation. However, 
infants with BPD were more likely 
to have “pH only events” (acidic pH 
in the lower esophagus without an 
associated MII determined reflux 
event), which were more often 
associated with symptoms, but at a 
low frequency (9% vs 4.9% in infants 
without BPD). Although infants 
with evolving BPD are more likely 
to have a diagnosis of and receive 
therapy for GER, 
39 with these results, 
it is suggested that these infants do 
not have an increased incidence of 
symptomatic GER.
Feeding Problems
Some infants and children with 
GER may exhibit feeding problems, 
including feeding resistance, failure 
to thrive, or food aversion.40, 
 
41 
Although preterm infants may 
have frequent regurgitation, there 
is no evidence that this leads to 
poor growth or other nutritional 
difficulties.7, 
 
42 Although preterm 
infants with a diagnosis of GER are 
sometimes treated with prokinetic 
agents to enhance gastric emptying, 
6  
there are no data to suggest that 
delayed gastric emptying is a 
physiologic mechanism for GER 
in this population.15 As noted 
previously, other feeding-related 
behaviors in preterm infants often 
attributed to GER, including feeding-
associated arching or irritability 
and oral feeding aversion, are not 
temporally associated with MII or 
lower pH documented reflux events 
and, thus, are not reliable markers of 
clinically significant reflux.20, 
 
24
TREATMENT
Although preterm infants frequently 
receive nonpharmacologic and 
pharmacologic therapy for GER, 
there is a paucity of data about the 
effect of treatment on symptoms 
or short- and long-term outcomes. 
Furthermore, the lack of randomized 
placebo-controlled trials of GER 
therapies in preterm infants makes it 
difficult to assess the efficacy of long-
term therapy versus the expected 
natural history of GER. Despite the 
lack of data, in recent years, the use 
of antireflux medications both in 
the NICU and after discharge has 
substantially increased.9, 
 
43
Nonpharmacologic Management
Body Positioning
Body positioning is widely used 
as a conservative management 
approach to infants believed to have 
GER. Placing infants on a head-up 
angle is a common initial approach 
to management; however, head 
elevation is ineffective in reducing 
acid reflux in older infants. In 
addition, car seat placement was 
found to elicit worse acid GER in term 
infants.44 
– 
46 This position has not 
been studied in preterm infants to 
prevent symptomatic GER, but there 
is no reason to expect the physiologic 
result would be different from term 
infants. Placing preterm infants in 
the left lateral versus right lateral 
position after feeding and in prone 
versus supine position may reduce 
TLESRs and reflux episodes.15, 
17, 
 
18 
However, although placement in the 
right lateral position may increase 
reflux episodes after feeding, van 
Wijk et al18 showed that this position 
also enhanced gastric emptying. 
These authors suggested placing 
infants in the right lateral position 
immediately after feeding, followed 
in 1 hour by placing them in the 
left lateral position to decrease 
acid reflux. However, 1 small MII 
and pH study of term infants at a 
mean postnatal age of 13 weeks 
revealed that, despite a reduction 
in reflux episodes in the left lateral 
position, behavioral manifestations 
of reflux (crying and/or irritability) 
did not improve.47 Thus, whether 
positioning techniques can reduce 
signs of GER in infants with reflux 
remains uncertain. Given that 
lateral and prone positioning also 
increase the risk of sudden infant 
death syndrome (SIDS), 
48 the AAP 
and the North American Society 
for Pediatric Gastroenterology 
and Nutrition have concurred that 
infants with GER should be placed 
for sleep in the supine position, with 
the exception of the rare infants for 
whom the risk of death from GER 
is greater than the risk of SIDS.2 
The AAP Task Force on SIDS, after 
conferring with the authors of the 
North American Society for Pediatric 
Gastroenterology and Nutrition 
statement, provided additional 
guidance: “Examples of such upper 
airway disorders are those in which 
airway-protective mechanisms are 
impaired, including infants with 
anatomic abnormalities, such as 
type 3 or 4 laryngeal clefts, who 
have not undergone antireflux 
surgery.” 
48 Safe sleep approaches, 
including supine positioning on a 
flat and firm surface and avoidance 
of commercial devices designed to 
maintain head elevation in the crib, 
should be paramount as a model 
for parents of infants approaching 
discharge (ie, infants greater than 32 
weeks’ postmenstrual age) from the 
hospital.49
Feeding Strategies
If GER results from increased  
intragastric pressure, smaller-volume 
 
feedings given more frequently  
might result in fewer GER episodes.  
Omari et al15 reported that feeding 
hourly, compared with feeding every 
2 or 3 hours, resulted in fewer total 
GER episodes but more frequent 
acidic reflux episodes. Jadcherla  
et al50 reported that longer feeding 
duration and slower milk flow rates 
were associated with fewer GER 
events, diagnosed by MII and pH 
study, although nutrient composition 
of expressed human milk may be 
compromised with this approach. No 
randomized trials have been used to 
compare the effects of continuous 
intragastric or transpyloric versus 
bolus intragastric tube feedings on 
GER symptom severity.51

 Another feeding strategy has been 
to thicken feedings with agents 
including xanthan gum, starch, 
or rice cereal.52 Unfortunately, in 
recent data, researchers have linked 
thickening with a xanthan gum 
product to late-onset necrotizing 
enterocolitis53; as such, it is 
recommended that xanthan gum 
or similar thickeners not be used 
in preterm or former preterm 
infants in the first year of life. 
Commercially available formula 
products that thicken on acidification 
in the stomach are not nutritionally 
appropriate for preterm infants.  
A systematic review of randomized 
controlled trials of thickened 
formulas in term infants with GER 
revealed that although these agents 
reduced episodes of regurgitation, 
they were ineffective in reducing 
acidic GER.54 Only small trials of 
thickeners have been performed in 
the preterm population. In 1 trial of 
a starch-thickened preterm formula, 
the total number of GER episodes 
was unchanged compared with a 
standard formula feeding; however, 
total lower esophageal acid exposure 
was less with the thickened formula 
feeding. No assessment was made 
about whether the reduction in acid 
exposure had an effect on associated 
symptoms.55
In the data, it is suggested 
that elemental or extensively 
hydrolyzed protein formulas reduce 
gastrointestinal transit time and 
reduce symptoms in term infants 
with symptomatic GER.56 These 
observations in term infants may 
be an overlap of signs of cow milk 
protein allergy and those attributed 
to GER, including vomiting, failure 
to thrive, and irritability.57 In 
contrast, in small studies of preterm 
infants, although feeding with 
extensively hydrolyzed protein 
formula compared with standard 
formula or human milk resulted in 
fewer reflux episodes as measured 
by MII and pH study, 
58, 
 
59 it did not 
reduce behavioral signs of GER.59 
It is unclear what role cow milk 
protein allergy may play in preterm 
infants with signs of GER; a trial of 
extensively hydrolyzed protein-based 
formula may be reasonable in  
age-appropriate preterm infants  
with signs of severe reflux.
Pharmacologic Management
Prokinetic Agents
Prokinetic (promotility) agents 
include metoclopramide, 
domperidone, and erythromycin. 
Prokinetic agents have been widely 
used in older infants to reduce the 
symptoms of GER. These drugs 
appear to improve gastric emptying, 
reduce regurgitation, and enhance 
LES tone. None of these drugs has 
been shown to reduce GER symptoms 
in preterm infants, 
60, 
 
61 and all 
have the potential for significant 
adverse effects, including a higher 
risk of infantile pyloric stenosis 
(erythromycin), cardiac arrhythmia 
(erythromycin), and neurologic 
side effects (domperidone and 
metoclopramide). Because of a lack of 
data about efficacy and a concerning 
safety profile, these drugs should not 
be used in preterm infants if the only 
indication is the treatment of GER.
Sodium Alginate
In older infants and children, 
researchers in several studies have 
revealed that alginate-containing 
formulations, which are frequently 
combined with sodium bicarbonate, 
may reduce the symptoms of GER.61 
In the presence of gastric acid, 
alginate formulations precipitate 
into a low-density viscous gel that 
acts as a physical barrier to the 
gastric mucosa; when combined with 
sodium bicarbonate (Gaviscon), a 
carbon dioxide foam forms, which 
preferentially is refluxed into the 
esophagus during GER events, 
protecting the lower esophagus 
from acidification. In preterm 
infants in small studies, sodium 
alginate preparations decreased the 
number of acidic GER episodes and 
total esophageal acid exposure62 
and decreased the frequency of 
regurgitation.63 However, the long-
term safety of these preparations 
in preterm infants has not been 
evaluated.
Histamine-2 Receptor Blockers
Histamine-2 (H2) receptor blockers 
(eg, ranitidine, famotidine) compete 
with histamine for the H2 receptor 
in the parietal cells in the stomach, 
decreasing hydrochloric acid 
secretion and increasing intragastric 
pH. H2 receptor blockers are 
frequently prescribed for infants in 
whom GER is clinically diagnosed6, 
 
9  
on the theory that these symptoms 
are secondary to acidic reflux into 
the lower esophagus. However, 
no researchers have assessed 
the efficacy of H2 blockers on the 
symptom profile of preterm infants 
with presumed reflux. In addition, 
use of these drugs in preterm infants 
has been linked to an increased 
incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis 
in several studies64 and a higher 
incidence of late-onset infections 
and death, 
65 possibly resulting 
from alteration of the intestinal 
microbiome.66
Proton Pump Inhibitors
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) block 
the gastric proton pump, decreasing 
both basal and stimulated parietal 
cell acid secretion. PPIs in older 
children have been associated with 
a higher risk of gastric bacterial 
overgrowth, gastroenteritis, and 
community-acquired pneumonia.67 
– 
69 
PPIs are used less often than H2 
blockers in preterm infants but are 
used for similar indications.9 Given 
their effect on gastric acid secretion, 
it is likely that PPIs would have 
similar potential adverse effects as 
H2 blockers, although this has not 
been investigated. Although there 
is evidence that administration 
of PPIs will consistently maintain 
the stomach pH >4 in preterm 
infants, they are largely ineffective 
in relieving clinical signs of GER. In

 randomized double-blind placebo-
controlled trials, both omeprazole 
and lansoprazole were ineffective 
in reducing GER signs in infants. In 
addition, lansoprazole was associated 
with a higher rate of adverse 
events.70
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1. GER is almost universal in  
preterm infants. It is a physiologic 
process secondary to frequent 
TLESR, relatively large-volume 
liquid diet, and age-specific  
body positioning. As such, it 
is a normal developmental 
phenomenon that will resolve 
with maturation.
2. Pathologic GER occurs when reflux 
of acidic gastric contents causes 
injury to the lower esophageal 
mucosa. Although preterm infants 
do have some acidic GER episodes, 
most GER episodes in this 
population are only weakly acidic 
because of their lower gastric 
acidity and frequent milk feedings, 
making such esophageal injury 
unlikely to occur.
3. Signs commonly ascribed to 
GER in preterm infants include 
feeding intolerance or aversion, 
poor weight gain, frequent 
regurgitation, apnea, and 
desaturation and bradycardia 
and behavioral signs, including 
irritability and perceived 
postprandial discomfort. In the 
data, the temporal association of 
these perceived signs of GER with 
either acidic or nonacidic reflux 
episodes as measured by MII and 
pH is not supported, and the signs 
will usually improve with time 
without treatment.
4. Data regarding the possible 
association between worsening 
lung disease attributable to 
GER and microaspiration in 
mechanically ventilated preterm 
infants are sparse. Further studies 
to elucidate such an association 
and to assess the effect of GER 
treatment on the severity of lung 
disease are needed.
5. There is marked variability in 
the diagnosis and treatment of 
GER in preterm infants among 
NICUs, perhaps because the 
diagnosis is usually made by 
clinical assessment of signs 
and symptoms and/or a 
trial of nonpharmacologic or 
pharmacologic treatment rather 
than definitive tests.
6. Conservative measures to control 
reflux, such as left lateral body 
position, head elevation, and 
feeding regimen manipulation, 
have not been shown to reduce 
clinically assessed signs of 
GER in the preterm infant; for 
infants greater than 32 weeks’ 
postmenstrual age, safe sleep 
approaches, including supine 
positioning on a flat and firm 
surface and avoidance of 
commercial devices designed to 
maintain head elevation in the 
crib, should be paramount as 
a model for parents of infants 
approaching discharge from the 
hospital.
7. Preterm infants with clinically 
diagnosed GER are often treated 
with pharmacologic agents; 
however, a lack of evidence of 
efficacy together with emerging 
evidence of significant harm 
(particularly with gastric acid 
blockade) strongly suggest that 
these agents should be used 
sparingly, if at all, in preterm 
infants.
