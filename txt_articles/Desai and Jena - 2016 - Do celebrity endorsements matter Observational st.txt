ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To examine the effect on BRCA testing and mastectomy 
rates of a widely viewed 2013 New York Times editorial 
by public figure Angelina Jolie that endorsed BRCA 
testing and announced Jolie’s decision to undergo 
preventive mastectomy.
Design
Observational study with difference-in-difference 
analysis.
setting
Commercially insured US population.
PartiCiPants
Women aged 18-64 years with claims in the Truven 
MarketScan commercial claims database 
(n=9 532 836).
Main OutCOMe Measures
Changes in BRCA testing rates in the 15 business days 
before versus after 14 May 2013 (editorial date) 
compared with the change in the same period in 2012; 
mastectomy rates in the months before and after 
publication, both overall and within 60 days of BRCA 
testing among women who were tested; national 
estimates of incremental tests and expenditures 
associated with Jolie’s article in the 15 days after 
publication.
results
Daily BRCA test rates increased immediately after the 
2013 editorial, from 0.71 tests/100 000 women in the 
15 business days before to 1.13 tests/100 000 women 
in the 15 business days after publication. In 
comparison, daily test rates were similar in the same 
period in 2012 (0.58/100 000 women in the 15 
business days before 14 May versus 0.55/100 000 
women in the 15 business days after), implying a 
difference-in-difference absolute daily increase of 0.45 
tests/100 000 women or a 64% relative increase 
(P<0.001). The editorial was associated with an 
estimated increase of 4500 BRCA tests and $13.5m 
(£10.8m; €12.8) expenditure nationally among 
commercially insured adult women in those 15 days. 
Increased BRCA testing rates were sustained 
throughout 2013. Overall mastectomy rates remained 
unchanged in the months after publication, but 60 day 
mastectomy rates among women who had a BRCA test 
fell from 10% in the months before publication to 7% 
in the months after publication, suggesting that 
women who underwent tests as a result of to the 
editorial had a lower pre-test probability of having the 
BRCA mutation than women tested before the 
editorial.
COnClusiOns
Celebrity endorsements can have a large and 
immediate effect on use of health services. Such 
announcements can be a low cost means of reaching a 
broad audience quickly, but they may not effectively 
target the subpopulations that are most at risk for the 
relevant underlying condition.
Introduction
Celebrity endorsements of healthcare products and 
behaviours are ubiquitous. We studied the effect of a 
major announcement by actress Angelina Jolie, who in 
a 2013 New York Times editorial urged women to con-
sider BRCA1/2 genetic testing and announced that she 
had undergone preventive mastectomy.1  The editorial is 
one of the most viewed health related articles in the 
social media age.2 
3  To date, analyses of the editorial’s 
effects have been limited to showing greater testing or 
referrals in small and specific subpopulations.4 
5 Using 
data from a large commercially insured US population, 
we analysed rates of BRCA testing and mastectomy 
before and after Jolie’s editorial.
Methods
Data
Our study included women aged 18-64 years in the 
United States who were continuously enrolled in com-
mercial insurance during 2012-13. Data came from the 
Truven MarketScan Analytics Commercial Claims and 
Encounters Database, which comprises de-identified 
health insurance claims for inpatient care, outpatient 
care, and prescription drugs for more than 50 million 
people covered by self insured employers and health 
plans. Details of this database have been published 
elsewhere.6
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Celebrity endorsements for health related matters such as preventive screening, 
fad diets, and supplements are ubiquitous
Evidence on whether celebrity endorsements actually affect health related 
behaviours remains limited
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This study analysed the effect of an editorial on BRCA gene testing by Angelina Jolie 
on rates of BRCA testing and mastectomy in a large US population
A 64% increase in BRCA testing rates occurred in the 15 business days after the 
editorial was published, but with no increase in mastectomy rates in the following 
months
Celebrity announcements can influence use of healthcare services, but they may 
not effectively target the subpopulation at greatest risk for the underlying

analysis
We identified BRCA gene testing according to Current 
Procedural Terminology codes 81211-81217 in outpatient 
claims.5 We estimated changes in BRCA testing after the 
editorial by using an individual level difference-in-dif-
ference model that compared the change in probability 
of BRCA testing in the 15 business days before versus 
the 15 business days after 14 May with the change in the 
same period in 2012 (to account for potential seasonal 
trends). We selected this relatively narrow time window 
to attenuate concern that factors other than Jolie’s edi-
torial would confound our estimates. In a sensitivity 
analysis, however, we extended the time window to 30 
days. Individual covariates included patient’s age (18-
25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, and 56-64 years), US Census 
region of residence (Northeast, North Central, South, 
West, unknown), and health plan type (preferred pro-
vider organisation (PPO), health maintenance organisa-
tion, consumer directed health plan, or other). Monthly 
BRCA testing rates in 2013, adjusted for number of days 
in the month, were reported to examine longer term 
trends. We estimated short term changes in spending 
on BRCA testing nationally (see online appendix).
We also graphically analysed changes in mastectomy 
rates after Jolie’s editorial to assess whether any addi-
tional BRCA gene testing led to subsequent preventive 
mastectomies.7 As our data did not contain modifier 
codes that would indicate whether a mastectomy was 
preventive, we calculated monthly mastectomy rates in 
the overall study population as well as rates in the 60, 90, 
and 180 days after the test among women who under-
went BRCA testing in 2013. If women responded to Jolie’s 
editorial with more intensive treatment choices, we 
would expect rates of mastectomies to increase in the 
months after publication of the editorial. We included 90 
and 180 day follow-up periods to allow sufficient time for 
women testing positive for BRCA to undergo mastectomy.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for the design or implementation of 
the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpre-
tation or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
study population
Our sample included 9 532 836 women, of whom 
2 546 635 (27%) were aged 46-55 and 2 018 218 (21%) were 
aged 56-64 in 2012 (table 1). Additionally, 3 118 836 
(33%) women resided in the South, and 5 555 048 (58%) 
were in PPO plans. During the study period, 32 945 
(0.35%) women had a BRCA test. Women who had BRCA 
tests were somewhat older (BRCA tested, 36% of women 
aged 46-55 and 22% aged 56-64; non-tested, 27% of 
women aged 46-55 and 21% aged 56-64), more heavily 
represented in the West (24% v 22%), and more likely to 
be covered by a PPO health plan (67% v 58%). Of 32 945 
women who had a BRCA test during 2012-13, almost half 
(15 233) had the test in the 231 remaining days of the 
year after the Jolie editorial was published (14 May 
2013), which represented less than a third of the two 
year study period. Characteristics of women who had 
the test before publication of the editorial compared 
with those who had the test after it are shown in appen-
dix 1. Women were similar in most characteristics, 
except that those who had the test after the editorial 
were slightly more likely to be covered under a PPO plan 
(70% v 64%).
rates of brCa testing
Daily BRCA test rates increased immediately and 
sharply after publication of the editorial. Rates rose 
from 0.71 tests per 100 000 women in the 15 business 
days before to 1.13 tests in the 15 business days after 14 
May 2013. In comparison, daily BRCA test rates were rel-
atively similar in the same period in 2012 (0.58 per 
100 000 women in the 15 business days before 14 May 
versus 0.55 tests per 100 000 in the 15 business days 
after) (fig 1). This corresponds to an adjusted differ-
ence-in-difference absolute daily increase of 0.45 tests 
per 100 000 women or a 64% relative increase

(P<0.001). Using a 30 day window, we estimated a dif-
ference-in-difference relative increase in BRCA testing 
rates of 52% (appendix 2).
Increases in BRCA testing persisted to the end of our 
study period (fig 2). Average monthly test rates 
increased from 15.6 tests per 100 000 women in months 
January to April 2013 to 21.3 tests per 100 000 women 
during May to December 2013, a relative monthly 
increase of 37%. Nationally, our results imply 4500 
additional BRCA tests and more than $13.5m (£10.8m; 
€12.8) in incremental expenditures on BRCA tests in the 
15 business days after the editorial among commercially 
insured women aged 18-64 (appendix 3).
We saw no increase in mastectomy rates in the overall 
population, with an average of seven mastectomies a 
month per 100 000 women during January to April as 
well as during May to December 2013 (fig 3 ). Moreover, 
among women who had BRCA tests, 60 day monthly 
mastectomy rates decreased from on average 10% 
during January to April 2013 to 7% during May to 
December 2013 (fig 4), further suggesting that incre-
mental BRCA tests obtained as a result of the Jolie edito-
rial did not yield additional BRCA positive mutations 
that might warrant preventive mastectomy. Ninety and 
180 day monthly mastectomy rates (post-BRCA testing) 
suggested a similar pattern.
discussion
We observed a large and immediate increase in BRCA 
testing among commercially insured women aged 18-64 
years in the United States after Angelina Jolie’s edito-
rial. Our findings illustrate that well delivered 
announcements by high profile figures may be a low 
cost and effective means to influencing healthcare deci-
sion making, particularly in this social media age.
However, both stable overall mastectomy rates and 
decreased mastectomy rates among women who had a 
BRCA test after the editorial suggest that additional 
BRCA testing induced by the editorial probably did not 
identify new BRCA mutations requiring preventive mas-
tectomy. This may suggest that incremental tests 
 
performed had a lower pre-test probability of being pos-
itive than tests done before the editorial or that addi-
tional women identified as having a BRCA mutation 
after the editorial were less likely to undergo preventive 
mastectomy. This also suggests that celebrity announce-
ments can reach a broad audience but may not effec-
tively target the population that would benefit most 
from the test, in this case women with a family history 
of breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, 
as advised by the US Preventive Services Task Force.8
limitations of study
Because we did not observe test results, we did not mea-
sure benefits associated with knowing one’s BRCA sta-
tus such as peace of mind or increased vigilance after 
learning one’s risk factors. Moreover, as our data did 
not allow us to identify preventive mastectomies, pre-
ventive mastectomies among women who tested posi-
tive for the BRCA mutation may have increased after 
Jolie’s editorial even though overall mastectomy rates 
remained steady. Moreover, rates of mastectomy among 
women who tested positive for the BRCA mutation 
could have increased after the time captured by our 
study period.9

was more general than that of previous studies, certain

Conclusions
We found an immediate increase in BRCA testing rates 
after Angelina Jolie’s breast cancer editorial in the New 
York Times but no change in overall mastectomy rates 
and a decrease in mastectomy rates among women who 
had the BRCA test. Celebrity announcements in the 
social media age can raise awareness and use of preven-
tive care by a large and broad audience, although their 
ability to target subpopulations of interest may be 
 
limited.
