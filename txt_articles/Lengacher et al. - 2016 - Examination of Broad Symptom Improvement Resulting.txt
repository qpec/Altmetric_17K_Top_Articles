Purpose
The purpose of this randomized trial was to evaluate the efficacy of the Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction for Breast Cancer (MBSR[BC]) program in improving psychological and physical
symptoms and quality of life among breast cancer survivors (BCSs) who completed treatment.
Outcomes were assessed immediately after 6 weeks of MBSR(BC) training and 6 weeks later to
test efficacy over an extended timeframe.
Patients and Methods
A total of 322 BCSs were randomly assigned to either a 6-week MBSR(BC) program (n = 155) or
a usual care group (n = 167). Psychological (depression, anxiety, stress, and fear of recurrence) and
physical symptoms (fatigue and pain) and quality of life (as related to health) were assessed at
baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks. Linear mixed models were used to assess MBSR(BC) effects over
time, and participant characteristics at baseline were also tested as moderators of MBSR(BC)
effects.
Results
Results demonstrated extended improvement for the MBSR(BC) group compared with usual care in
both psychological symptoms of anxiety, fear of recurrence overall, and fear of recurrence problems
and physical symptoms of fatigue severity and fatigue interference (P , .01). Overall effect sizes
were largest for fear of recurrence problems (d = 0.35) and fatigue severity (d = 0.27). Moderation
effects showed BCSs with the highest levels of stress at baseline experienced the greatest benefit
from MBSR(BC).
Conclusion
The MBSR(BC) program significantly improved a broad range of symptoms among BCSs up to
6 weeks after MBSR(BC) training, with generally small to moderate overall effect sizes.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 14.5 million cancer survivors are
living in the United States, with an estimated
increase to 19 million by 2024,1 and 41% are
breast cancer (BC) survivors (BCSs).1 Treatments
have increased survival rates up to 100% for those
with stage 0 to I, 93% for those with stage II, and
72% for those with stage III disease.2
Although BCSs are living longer, they often
experience late effects from either the disease
and/or treatment, which may affect daily func-
tioning and quality of life (QOL).3,4 BCSs are
often unprepared for the emotional trauma
associated with diagnosis and treatment; the
immediate and long-term sequalae often resulting
in depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances,5-8 and
fears of recurrence (FORs); or the physical
problems of pain and fatigue.6,7,9-14 During the
period when BCSs transition to treatment com-
pletion, worries and FORs often accompany
physical symptoms,15 placing BCSs at higher risk
for anxiety and depression secondary to multiple
other stressors.16 Frequently, psychological and
physical symptoms overlap, exacerbating one
another and affecting QOL for many years after
treatment.5,10-13,17,18
Considering the multiple symptoms BCSs
endure, there is a need for large clinical trials to

 test the efficacy of effective interventions that can assist these
survivors.19 Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) has been
found to be an effective intervention for BCSs in decreasing de-
pression, anxiety, stress, FORs,5,20-24 and QOL.25 Preliminary
evidence exists for the efficacy of MBSR in decreasing fatigue, pain,
and sleep disturbances among BCSs.22,24,26,27 MBSR continues to
demonstrate varied effectiveness in reducing symptoms during the
transitional phase after treatment and thereafter.21-24,28 Despite
promising results, there is limited evidence from large clinical trials
regarding the effects of MBSR on QOL among BCSs.22,23 A recent
trial among 229 BCSs no longer receiving treatment demonstrated
greater improvement in QOL at both 8- and 12-week follow-up
compared with controls.22 Meditative training in mindfulness
(attention to the breath and body sensations) facilitates self-
regulation of emotions by acceptance and nonreactive awareness
of internal and external experiences.29,30 We postulate that this
technique reduces rumination and reactions to emotional and
physical triggers.
In summary, although evidence exists to support the use of
MBSR among BCSs to alleviate symptom burden, few studies have
tested the efficacy of MBSR in improvement of multiple psy-
chological and physical symptoms along with QOL in a meth-
odologic, rigorous large trial.30,31 The major aim of this large
randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the efficacy of
the MBSR for BC (MBSR[BC]) program in improving psycho-
logical and physical symptoms and QOL among BCSs re-
cently completing treatment. We hypothesized that compared
with usual care (UC), participants randomly assigned to MBSR
(BC) would experience greater improvements in psychological
symptoms (depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and FORs),
physical symptoms (pain and fatigue), and QOL, with im-
provements immediately after MBSR(BC) training and 6 weeks
later. Additionally, we expected BCSs with the most distress at
baseline would experience the greatest benefits. To test this possi-
bility, perceived stress was examined at baseline to determine if it
moderated treatment effects of MBSR(BC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Participants
From April 2009 through March 2013, 322 BCSs age 21 years or
older with a diagnosis of stage 0 to III BC who had completed treatment
from 2 weeks to 2 years before were recruited from the Moffitt Cancer
Center, Carol and Frank Morsani Center for Advanced Healthcare, and
Life Hope Medical Group, located in Tampa, Florida. Exclusion criteria
included a diagnosis of stage IV BC, severe mental disorder, and/or BC
recurrence.
Procedures
Study
design
and
randomization. Participants
were
randomly
assigned at a one-to-one ratio to MBSR(BC) or UC with waitlisted
MBSR(BC). An SPSS macro (version 17.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to
create a stratified block randomization scheme, stratifying patients by type
of surgery (lumpectomy v mastectomy), BC treatment (chemotherapy
with or without radiotherapy v radiotherapy alone), and BC stage (stage
0 to I v II to III). This, along with the blocking mechanism, was performed
to ensure balanced distributions of baseline factors between the two study
groups (eg, pre-existing levels of anxiety). The sample size was calculated
to compare adjusted mean outcome scores separately at 6 and 12 weeks of
follow-up between the two groups. Allowing for 10% loss to follow-up of
the sample, a sample of 300 or more would provide 90% power (type I
error rate, 0.01) to detect an effect size (between groups) of (d) 0.45.
Recruitment and data collection procedures. The trial protocol was
approved by the institutional review board at the University of South
Florida and the Moffitt Cancer Center Scientific Review Committee.
BCSs who met inclusion criteria were invited to an orientation session
during which informed consent was obtained along with base-
line assessments followed by random assignment to either MBSR(BC)
or UC.
MBSR(BC) intervention. Participants randomly assigned to MBSR
(BC) attended 2-hour sessions once per week for 6 weeks conducted by
a clinical psychologist trained in MBSR and were provided training
manuals and CDs to guide their practice. MBSR(BC) was adapted from
the 8-week program of Kabat-Zinn et al32,33 to address the specific
needs, concerns, and symptomology of BCSs and consists of educational
materials, practice sessions of four meditative techniques(ie, sitting
meditation, walking meditation, body scan, and gentle Hatha yoga33),
and group processes related to barriers to the practice of meditation,
application in daily situations, and supportive interaction among group
members.33 BCSs were also taught informal techniques of integrating
mindfulness into their daily activities. Compliance was assessed by the
number of classes attended, completion of diaries, and minutes prac-
ticed. Indicators of MBSR(BC) compliance were established as at least
75% attendance at the MBSR(BC) sessions and completion of at least
75% of the homework assigned (ie, 15 to 45 minutes practiced each
day).
Fidelity. A structured observational method was used to evaluate
instructors’ adherence to the intervention protocol. Participant diaries
were evaluated monthly for fidelity to the MBSR(BC) intervention.
UC. Participants randomly assigned to UC attended standard post-
treatment clinic visits and were offered the MBSR(BC) program on study
completion.
Measurements
Physical symptoms. The Brief Pain Inventory, a 15-item question-
naire, was used to assess pain severity and pain interference in daily living,
with higher scores indicative of greater pain severity and interference. The
Fatigue Symptom Inventory was used to measure severity and perceived
interference with QOL; higher scores are demonstrative of higher fatigue
severity and interference with QOL.34
Psychological symptoms. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies De-
pression Scale was used to evaluate depression; greater scores are associated
with
greater
depressive
symptomology.35
The
State-Trait
Anxiety
Inventory–State, a subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, was used
to measure situational anxiety; higher scores are indicative of greater
anxiety. The Perceived Stress Scale, a 14-item questionnaire, was used to
measure stress; higher scores are characteristic of greater stress. The
Concerns About Recurrence Scale was used to measure overall FOR and
problems related to FORs; higher scores are indicative of greater overall
fear and worry.36
QOL. The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form was used to assess
mental and physical health as related to QOL; higher scores are de-
monstrative of better mental and physical health.
Demographic data and clinical history. Socioeconomic and de-
mographic data were collected on age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital
status, income, and employment status, along with clinical history data on
cancer diagnosis and treatment. All demographic and clinical history data
were completed at baseline and updated at 6 and 12 weeks.
Statistical Methods
The intent-to-treat principle was used, and all outcomes were
considered of equal importance (ie, no secondary outcomes). There were
two post-MBSR(BC) outcome assessment periods: one at 6 weeks im-
mediately on completion of the program and one at 12 weeks (an

 additional 6 weeks after program completion). This design, coupled with
initial baseline assessment, resulted in two separate assessment time points,
allowing for the opportunity for repeated measures analysis. Linear mixed
models were implemented to assess the interaction between participant
assignment (MBSR[BC] v UC) and time (baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks)
in relation to symptom outcomes, testing whether the rate of symptom
change varied by study assignment. Linear mixed models were also used to
account for baseline differences and allow for inclusion and analysis of
participants with some missing data (the number of whom was minimal).
These linear mixed models assumed a compound symmetry correlation
structure, and a two-sided P value of less than .01 was used to define
statistical significance for all analyses (to test the sensitivity of effects,
a parallel set of tests assumed an unstructured correlation structure).
Model estimation was conducted in Mplus (version 7.1; Muth´
en and
Muth´
en, Los Angeles, CA) using full-information maximum-likelihood
estimation to benefit from available information in the data. Participants
with missing information were included in the analyses under the as-
sumption of missing at random (ie, missing data conditional on observed
variables). Because BCSs who were most distressed at study enrollment
seemed to benefit the most from MBSR(BC), participant stress (Per-
ceived Stress Scale) was selected as a moderator. Moderator effects were
explored using analysis of covariance and tested as interaction effects in
the context of a series of linear mixed models. Characteristics at baseline
were tested as moderators of the most robust main effects on symptom
improvement (FOR as a psychological symptom and fatigue as a physical
symptom).

Effects of MBSR Among Breast Cancer Survivors
 RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Of the 322 BCSs enrolled in the study, 299 completed the
baseline and 6- and 12-week assessments, yielding a 9% attrition
rate. The CONSORT diagram in Figure 1 identifies the number of
patients screened, randomly assigned, and retained. Table 1 lists
demographic characteristics by random assignment, identifying no
statistically significant differences between groups at baseline and
no significant differences in clinical characteristics, except in the
use of anxiety medications (Table 2). Nearly 20% of BCSs had at
least one first-degree relative with BC, and 10.9% of those first-
degree relatives were diagnosed at age 50 years or younger.
Efficacy of MBSR(BC) on Outcomes
Linear mixed models were used to test the efficacy of MBSR
(BC) on each outcome. Descriptive data for each outcome are
summarized in Tables 3 and 4.
Psychological symptoms. When examining effect sizes, the
largest MBSR(BC)-related improvements occurred during the first
6 weeks, and most were maintained at 12 weeks. Statistically
significant psychological symptom improvements were observed
for BCSs in the MBSR(BC) program through the 12-week period.
Participants randomly assigned to MBSR(BC) showed significantly
greater improvements in anxiety (P = .007) and FORs (overall and
problems; P , .01). Twelve-week effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were be-
tween 0.27 and 0.35. Results for depression were consistent with the
pattern observed for the other psychological measures. Participants
assigned to MBSR(BC) tended to experience greater improvement
than those assigned to UC; however, this trend did not reach sta-
tistical significance (P = .06). Table 3 includes P values for the
condition-by-time improvement of psychological symptoms, along with
the effect sizes at 6 and 12 weeks. Because use of anxiety medications
differed between experimental groups at baseline, anxiety medication
was included as a covariate in the mixed models testing both anxiety and
FOR effects, which did not alter the patterns of statistical significance.
Physical symptoms. BCSs randomly assigned to MBSR(BC)
demonstrated greater symptom improvement in fatigue (severity
and interference; P ,.01). Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were between 0.27
and 0.23. Similar to improvement in psychological symptoms, a ma-
jority of improvements in fatigue occurred during the MBSR(BC)
training, with little change occurring during the follow-up period (6 to
12 weeks). Groups did not differ statistically in pain outcomes. Table 4
includes P values for the condition-by-time improvement of physical
symptoms, along with the effect sizes at 6 and 12 weeks.
QOL. Although a trend for QOLwas observed (P ,.05), with an
effect size (d) of 0.21, the difference was not statistically significant

 (defined as P ,.01). Table 3 includes P values for the condition-by-time
improvement of QOL, along with the effect sizes at 6 and 12 weeks.
Moderators. Baseline stress was tested as a moderator of the
most robust main effect symptom improvements (FORs and fa-
tigue), and a consistent pattern was observed across both tests.
BCSs with the most stress at baseline experienced the most im-
provement from MBSR(BC) in both fatigue and FORs (both
P , .001; Figs 2 and 3 show moderation effects).
Sensitivity analysis. Each mixed model was tested assuming
a compound symmetry correlation structure. To test whether effects
were robust to different correlation structures, all models were also
tested with an unstructured correlation matrix. All differences
remained statistically significant except for anxiety, which went from
a P value of .007 to .018.
Compliance. A majority of MBSR(BC) participants were
classified as compliant. There was no evidence of effect modifi-
cation by compliance with respect to the outcome of anxiety, FORs,
or fatigue (P . .05).
DISCUSSION
This clinical trial further supports the empirically established
benefits of MBSR(BC) and shows added efficacy over an extended
timeframe for wide-ranging symptoms. The major benefit of
MBSR(BC) is that it provides evidence of alleviation of multiple
symptoms concurrently. This RCT is the largest clinical trial to our
knowledge testing the effects of MBSR(BC) among BCSs with
a 12-week follow-up examining the immediate and sustained
treatment effects on physical (fatigue and pain) and psychological
symptoms (anxiety, depression, stress, and FORs) and QOL.
Methodologically, this study met the standards for a large, rigorous
RCT with sufficient power to detect treatment effects. It is im-
portant to note that a majority of symptom improvements oc-
curred during the MBSR(BC) training (baseline to 6 weeks) and
were sustained during the follow-up period. We find it promising
that participants assigned to MBSR(BC) experienced immediate
improvements in fatigue and also psychological symptoms during
the MBSR(BC) training period.
This trial provides evidence to support MBSR(BC) as clinical
treatment with sustained effects for the symptoms associated with
BC treatment. Our work is similar to a study of MBSR among 229
BCSs no longer receiving treatment, which found significant
improvements in total mood at 8 and 12 weeks, subscales of anxiety
and depression at 8 weeks only, and anger at 12 weeks only.22
Psychological improvements in stress, anxiety, and depression among
BCSs in clinical trials have beenvalidated in earlier work by our team23
and others.20,21 Although FOR is a chronic problem for BCS and is
associated with heightened stress, anxiety, and depression, it is not
often examined as an outcome of MBSR. FOR is triggered by an-
tecedents such as physical symptoms or by perceived risk, resulting in
psychological distress,37,38 and contributes indirectly to fatigue.39,40
Previous research has shown that MBSR(BC) reduces FOR and distal
psychological and physical symptoms.41
This is the only large clinical trial to our knowledge to examine
and validate the effects of MBSR(BC) on FOR among BCSs unique

Effects of MBSR Among Breast Cancer Survivors
 showing immediate (6 weeks) and sustained (12 weeks) im-
provements for reducing FOR. The improvement in FOR is
consistent with that seen in our previous small R21 National
Cancer Institute trial23 and our pilot study testing the feasibility of
the MBSR(BC) intervention.42 Although a sensitivity analysis
decreased the P value of the effect of MBSR on anxiety, numerous
replications of MBSR-related anxiety reduction make us confident
that this was not a type I error.
A second major finding provides evidence that MBSR(BC)
had significant effects on fatigue severity and interference up to
6 weeks after cessation of MBSR(BC) training. In comparison,
Hoffman et al22 found significant improvements at 8 weeks in
fatigue, vigor, and confusion. Our results were also similar to
those of Carlson et al.43 The moderation analysis suggests patients
who were experiencing the greatest stress at baseline gained the
greatest benefit from MBSR(BC) in decreasing their fatigue and
FOR.
Relatively small effect sizes may have resulted from low
symptom levels at baseline (floor effects), particularly because this
study did not screen for high levels distress, anxiety, and/or de-
pression before enrollment. Future studies may consider screening
for distress or other moderating factors. Floor effects may also be
the reason that little further improvement was observed in
symptoms during the follow-up period.
This large clinical trial provides support for MBSR(BC) as
clinical treatment for psychological and physical symptoms ex-
perienced by BCSs as they transition away from treatment and
move forward into long-term survivorship. Although in 2014, the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network indicated that MBSR
had a high level of evidence, there have been few large randomized
trials reporting significant effects.5,22,28 Our large RCT adds ad-
ditional scientific evidence for the extended clinical effectiveness of
MBSR(BC) to alleviate multiple existing psychological and physical
symptoms in BCSs. Major benefits of the MBSR(BC) program
include that it can be easily learned and does not require a great
deal of physical effort when practiced. MBSR(BC) can become
a beneficial way of life, if BCSs cultivate decreased reactions to
stress through their formal or informal meditation practice.
A practical limitation in widespread clinical translation of
MBSR(BC) is that the current delivery approach requires in-person
sessions over a minimum of 6 weeks. This warrants the devel-
opment and testing of technology-based methods that can deliver
the MBSR(BC) intervention remotely in an efficacious manner,
such as by the use of video telecommunications or mobile devices,
for the wide adoption of this evidence-based program.
A limitation of this study was the trial design. Although
participants were randomly assigned to either MBSR(BC) or UC,
an ideal control condition would have been an active attention
comparison treatment, thereby controlling for expectancy effects
and time and attention. Our sample was largely middle class with
some diversity; however, we did not include non–English speaking
BCSs. Blinding to group assignment after the baseline assessment
by the assessors was not possible with use of the waitlisted control
design. Although participants were randomly assigned, this trial

 enrolled BCSs interested in the trial (ie, motivated), possibly
creating some selection bias. Finally, related to data in Figure 1, the
participation rate among screened eligible BCSs (ie, those who
ultimately enrolled) was low; however, this does not indicate a lack
of generalizability per se, because the primary reasons for non-
enrollment were logistic in nature (eg, distance too far to travel),
taking into consideration that many of the patients traveled to the
cancer center from a distance.
In conclusion, this study provides evidence to support the
benefits of MBSR(BC) as a clinical nonpharmacologic intervention
targeting extended relief for BCSs experiencing distressing psy-
chological and physical symptoms. Major advantages of this
intervention are that MBSR(BC) targets multiple distressing
symptoms concurrently and that it is most beneficial to those who
are most distressed. Future technology-based approaches should be
developed and tested to widely deliver this intervention in an
efficacious manner.
