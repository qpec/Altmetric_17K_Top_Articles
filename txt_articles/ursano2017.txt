IMPORTANCE Mental health of soldiers is adversely affected by the death and injury of other
unit members, but whether risk of suicide attempt is influenced by previous suicide attempts
in a soldier’
s unit is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether a soldier’
s risk of suicide attempt is influenced by previous
suicide attempts in that soldier’
s unit.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using administrative data from the Army Study to
Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS), this study identified person-month
records for all active-duty, regular US Army, enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide from
January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009 (n = 9650), and an equal-probability sample of
control person-months (n = 153 528). Data analysis was performed from August 8, 2016, to
April 10, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Logistic regression analyses examined the number of
past-year suicide attempts in a soldier’
s unit as a predictor of subsequent suicide attempt,
controlling for sociodemographic features, service-related characteristics, prior mental health
diagnosis, and other unit variables, including suicide-, combat-, and unintentional
injury–related unit deaths. The study also examined whether the influence of previous unit
suicide attempts varied by military occupational specialty (MOS) and unit size.
RESULTS Of the final analytic sample of 9512 enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide and
151 526 control person-months, most were male (86.4%), 29 years or younger (68.4%),
younger than 21 years when entering the army (62.2%), white (59.8%), high school educated
(76.6%), and currently married (54.8%). In adjusted models, soldiers were more likely to
attempt suicide if 1 or more suicide attempts occurred in their unit during the past year (odds
ratios [ORs], 1.4-2.3; P < .001), with odds increasing as the number of unit attempts
increased. The odds of suicide attempt among soldiers in a unit with 5 or more past-year
attempts was more than twice that of soldiers in a unit with no previous attempts (OR, 2.3;
95% CI, 2.1-2.6). The association of previous unit suicide attempts with subsequent risk was
significant whether soldiers had a combat arms MOS or other MOS (ORs, 1.4-2.3; P < .001)
and regardless of unit size, with the highest risk among those in smaller units (1-40 soldiers)
(ORs, 2.1-5.9; P < .001). The population-attributable risk proportion for 1 or more unit suicide
attempts in the past year indicated that, if this risk could be reduced to no unit attempts,
18.2% of attempts would not occur.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Risk of suicide attempt among soldiers increased as the
number of past-year suicide attempts within their unit increased for combat arms and other
MOSs and for units of any size but particularly for smaller units. Units with a history of suicide
attempts may be important targets for preventive interventions.

 T
he suicide attempt (SA) rate among US Army soldiers in-
creased substantially during the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars.1 Medically documented SAs are more likely to
occur among soldiers never or previously deployed (vs cur-
rently deployed) and soldiers who are female, younger, non-
Hispanic white, less educated, and in the early stages of
army service, particularly the initial months of training.2,3
The risk of SA may also be influenced by events within a sol-
dier’
s army unit, including suicidal behavior of other unit
members.
Units are the foundational structure of the US Army. Sol-
diers have a variety of shared unit experiences, including ex-
posure to external group stressors (eg, training, deployment,
and combat) and internal group stressors (eg, leadership
changes, bullying by peers or leaders, and injury or death of
unit members). External group stressors, particularly com-
bat, adversely affect the mental health and suicide risk of sol-
diers within a unit.4-6 Internal unit characteristics, including
leadership quality and group cohesion, can exacerbate or miti-
gate the influence of external group stressors on perfor-
mance and health-related outcomes,7-10 including suicide
ideation.11
Injuries and deaths from combat and unintentional
events become internal group stressors that adversely affect
the mental and physical health of unit members.12-14 Less is
known about the influence of suicidal behavior on other
unit members. Personal accounts suggest that suicidal
events can have profound negative effects within a unit.15
Suicide contagion, in which exposure to suicide is proposed
to increase suicidal behaviors in others, even if the person
who died was not personally known,16 may result in
clustering or multiple suicidal behaviors exhibited in a short
period and/or specific geographic area or community.17,18
Multiple suicidal events may also reflect high unit stress
attributable to factors such as poor leadership or low group
cohesion.
To the extent that there is an association between previ-
ous SAs within a unit and subsequent SA risk among sol-
diers in that unit, the strength of that association may be
modified by individual and unit characteristics. Military
occupation influences suicide risk, with combat soldiers
having significantly elevated rates of suicide death com-
pared with other soldiers.19 It is not known whether this
increased risk is associated with the number of previous
unit suicides or SAs. Unit size is another potentially relevant
characteristic. Small military units, with their shared cul-
ture, structure, and cohesion, may profoundly affect sol-
diers’functioning and well-being.20 It is possible that previ-
ous SAs within smaller units have a greater influence on
subsequent risk among unit members.
We examined whether a soldier’
s risk of SA is influenced
by previous SAs in that soldier’
s unit after adjusting for indi-
vidual sociodemographic and service-related characteris-
tics, history of mental health diagnosis, and other internal
unit stressors, including previous unit deaths from combat,
unintentional injuries, and suicide. We also examined
whether the influence of previous unit SAs varies by occu-
pation and unit size.
Methods
Sample
This longitudinal, retrospective cohort study used data from
the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemem-
bers (STARRS) Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS),
which integrates 38 US Army and US Department of Defense
administrative data systems and includes individual-level per-
son-month records for all soldiers on active duty from Janu-
ary 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009 (n = 1.66 million).21
Data analysis was performed from August 8, 2016, to April 10,
2017. The HADS was approved by the institutional review
boards of the Uniformed Services University of the Health
Sciences; University of Michigan Institute for Social Re-
search; University of California, San Diego; and Harvard Medi-
cal School. These institutional review boards determined that
the present study did not constitute human participant re-
searchbecauseitreliesentirelyondeidentifiedsecondarydata.
The HADS includes administrative records for all 957 057
regular army soldiers on active duty during the 2004 to 2009
study period (excluding activated US Army National Guard and
Army Reserve), 9791 of whom had a documented SA. The cur-
rent study focused on enlisted soldiers, which were previ-
ously found to account for nearly 99% of SAs from 2004
through 2009.3 Using all enlisted soldiers who attempted
suicide(n = 9650cases)andanequal-probability1:200sample
of control person-months (n = 153 528), the study3 excluded
person-months that were not linked to an army unit (n = 82)
and outlier person-months with a unit size greater than 600
(n = 2058). The final analytic sample included 9512 enlisted
soldiers who attempted suicide (hereinafter referred to as sui-
cide attempters) and 151 526 control person-months. In select-
ing controls, the population was stratified by sex, rank, time
in service, deployment status (never, currently, or previously
deployed), and historical time. Control person-months ex-
cluded all soldiers with a documented SA or other nonfatal sui-
cidalevent(eg,suicidalideation)1andperson-monthsinwhich
a soldier died. Data were analyzed using a discrete-time sur-
vival framework with a person-month unit of analysis,22 such
that each month in a soldier’
s career was treated as a separate
Key Points
Question Does a previous suicide attempt in a soldier’
s US Army
unit increase the risk of subsequent suicide attempts?
Findings In this longitudinal cohort study of administrative
records from 9650 medically documented soldiers who
attempted suicide between the years 2004 and 2009 and 153 528
control person-months, the risk of suicide attempt among soldiers
increased as the number of past-year suicide attempts within their
unit increased. This finding was true for combat arms and other
occupations and for units of any size but particularly for smaller
units (1-40 soldiers).
Meaning Units with a history of suicide attempts may be
important targets for preventive interventions.

 observational record. Control person-months were assigned
a weight of 200 to adjust for undersampling.
Measures
Suicide Attempt
Suicide attempters were identified using US Army and US De-
partment of Defense administrative records from the Depart-
ment of Defense Suicide Event Report,23 a US Department of
Defense–wide surveillance mechanism completed by medi-
cal professionals at US Department of Defense treatment fa-
cilities, and ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes E950 to E958 (indi-
cating self-inflicted poisoning or injury with suicidal intent)
from health care encounter data systems for military and ci-
vilian treatment facilities, combat operations, and aeromedi-
cal evacuations (eTable 1 in the Supplement). We excluded sui-
cide deaths, Department of Defense Suicide Event Report
records indicating only suicide ideation, and E959 codes (late
effects of a self-inflicted injury) because this code confounds
the temporal associations between the predictor variables and
SA.24 Records from different data systems were cross-
referenced, ensuring all cases represent unique soldiers. For
soldiers with multiple SAs, we selected the first attempt using
a hierarchical classification scheme that prioritized Depart-
ment of Defense Suicide Event Report records because of that
system’
s more extensive reporting requirements.1
Sociodemographic and Service-Related Variables
Sociodemographic (sex, current age, race, educational level,
and marital status) and service-related variables (age at army
entry, time in service [1-2, 3-4, 5-10, or >10 years], deploy-
ment status [never, currently, or previously deployed], and oc-
cupation [combat arms vs other]) (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment) were drawn from administrative data.
Previous Mental Health Diagnosis
Wecreatedanindicatorvariableforanypreviousmentalhealth
diagnosis during army service by combining ICD-9-CM codes
from administrative medical records (eg, major depression, bi-
polar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and personality
disorders), excluding postconcussion syndrome, tobacco use
disorder, and supplemental V codes that are not disorders (eg,
stressors or adversities, marital problems) (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Unit Variables
Unit-related variables for each soldier were constructed from
administrative records. Duty units were determined using de-
identified Unit Identification Codes. Soldiers with the same
Unit Identification Code in a given calendar month were con-
sidered to be members of the same unit (eAppendix in the
Supplement).
Unit SAs in the Past Year
We constructed a total count of SAs occurring in each sol-
dier’
s unit during the year before the sampled person-month
record. This count excluded SAs made by case soldiers. The
resulting predictor variable was interpreted from the
sampled soldier’
s perspective (ie, number of SAs in “my”
duty unit during the past year). The same method was used
to obtain counts of past-year unit suicide, combat, and unin-
tentional deaths.
Unit Size
The size of a soldier’
s army unit was determined based on the
mean number of soldiers in that unit during the past 3 months
(including the sampled person-month). For instance, the size
of a given soldier’
s unit in March 2009 was obtained by aver-
aging the number of soldiers in that unit in January, Febru-
ary,andMarch2009.Unitsizes(1-40,41-100,101-200,and201-
600 soldiers) were categorized to approximate army
operational units.25
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software, ver-
sion 9.4.26 The association of past-year unit SAs with SA risk
was first examined in a univariable logistic regression analy-
sis, followed by a series of multivariable logistic regression
analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic variables (sex, cur-
rent age, race/ethnicity, educational level, and marital sta-
tus), service-related characteristics (age at army entry, time in
service, deployment status, and occupation), prior mental
health diagnosis, and other unit variables (unit size, suicide
deaths, combat deaths, and unintentional deaths). We then
separately examined the interaction of unit SAs with occupa-
tion and unit size to determine whether the association of unit
SAs with subsequent SA risk varied according to these char-
acteristics. These interactions were further explored by strati-
fying the sample. Logistic regression coefficients were expo-
nentiated to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Final model
coefficients were used to generate a standardized risk
estimate27(SRE;numberofsuicideattemptersper100 000per-
son-years) for each category of a predictor under a model that
assumed other predictors were at their sample-wide means.
All logistic regression models included a dummy predictor for
calendar month and year to control for increasing rates of SA
from2004through2009.1Coefficientsofotherpredictorswere
consequently interpreted as averaged within-month associa-
tions based on the assumption that effects of other predic-
tors do not vary over time. Population-attributable risk
proportions28 were calculated to identify the proportion of ob-
served SAs that would not have occurred if the effects attrib-
utable to unit SAs were reduced to a reference level, assum-
ing that coefficients in the model represent causal effects of
the predictors.
Results
Of the 9512 enlisted suicide attempters and 151 526 control per-
son-months, most were male (86.4%), 29 years or younger
(68.4%), younger than 21 years when entering the army
(62.2%),white(59.8%),highschooleducated(76.6%),andcur-
rently married (54.8%). Almost three-quarters (72.2%) had
more than 2 years of service, 40.3% had never deployed, and
76.7% were assigned to an occupation other than combat arms
(eTable 4 in the Supplement).

 In univariate analyses, soldiers were more likely to at-
tempt suicide if assigned to a unit with 1 or more past-year SAs
(χ2
5 = 1534.6, P < .001) (Table 1), with odds increasing mono-
tonically as the number of unit SAs increased from 1 (OR, 1.6;
95% CI, 1.5-1.7) to 5 or more (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 3.6-4.3). This as-
sociation remained significant after adjusting for sociodemo-
graphic variables, age at army entry, time in service, deploy-
ment status, occupation, and unit size (χ2
5 = 543.9, P < .001),
with soldiers being twice as likely to attempt suicide if there
were 5 or more past-year unit attempts than if there were no
attempts (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 2.1-2.6). Of importance, the results
were unchanged when (1) examining the number of past-year
unit attempters (not attempts) as the predictor, (2) excluding
soldiers in their first 6 months of service (a period of initial
army training associated with particularly high risk of SA3),
(3) excluding soldiers in Warrior Transition Units (intensive re-
habilitative care units for soldiers with significant physical
and/or mental health needs), and (4) adjusting for the num-
ber of soldiers within a unit who had a past-year mental health
diagnosis (an indicator of unit-based differences in distress).
Results were also replicated in a generalized linear mixed-
effects model and a generalized estimating equation model to
account for any potential nonindependence (detailed results
available on request).
The SREs of SA increased from 319 per 100 000 person-
years for soldiers in a unit with no past-year SAs to 747 per
100 000 person-years for soldiers in a unit with 5 or more SAs.
The population-attributable risk proportion for at least 1 unit
SA in the past year (ie, the proportion of observed SAs associ-
ated with the predictor) based on this model was 18.2%, indi-
cating that, if the risk associated with units that had at least 1
past-yearSAcouldbereducedtothosewithnoattempts,18.2%
of attempts would not occur. The population-attributable risk
proportion for units with a history of 5 or more SAs revealed
that 4.1% of subsequent SAs could be eliminated if risk was re-
duced to that of units in which there were 4 SAs or fewer.
We further examined the robustness of unit SAs by add-
ingpriormentalhealthdiagnosisandpast-yearunitdeathsdue
to suicide, combat, and unintentional injury to the model. The
SA was related to prior mental health diagnosis (χ2
1 = 7169.7,
P < .001) but not to past-year unit deaths due to suicide
(χ2
1 = 1.4, P = .23), combat (χ2
6 = 1.3, P = .97), or unintentional
injury(χ2
2 = 0.3,P = .87).Ofimportance,theassociationofpast-
year unit SAs with soldiers’risk of SA remained significant af-
ter inclusion of these factors (χ2
5 = 505.5, P < .001) (eTable 5
in the Supplement).
To identify whether the association of unit SA with risk of
SAwasmodifiedbyoccupationandunitsize,weincludedtheir
2-way interactions in separate multivariable models, adjust-
ing for sociodemographic and service-related variables. The
interactionsofunitSAswithoccupation(χ2
5 = 13.2,P = .02)and
unit size (χ 2
15 = 87.6, P < .001) were significant; the 3-way
interaction was not (χ2
15 = 16.2, P = .37).
To better understand these 2-way interactions, we exam-
ined models stratified first by occupation and then, sepa-
rately, by unit size. Among combat arms (χ2
5 = 119.3, P < .001)
and other occupation groups (χ2
5 = 409.4, P < .001), the num-
ber of past-year unit SAs was significantly associated with risk
of SA (Table 2). The odds of SA increased as the number of unit
SAs increased in both groups (ORs, 1.4-2.3). Figure 1 shows the
standardized risk of SA by occupation. Risk of SA in both oc-
cupation groups generally increased as a function of past-
year unit SAs. Among soldiers in a unit with 5 or more past-
year SAs, the standardized risk for those with a combat arms
occupation was significantly higher than for those with other
occupations (rate ratio [RR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2).
After stratifying by unit size, past-year unit SAs were
consistently associated with higher odds of SA for each unit
size group (Table 3). This association was particularly strong
for smaller units of 1 through 40 soldiers (ORs, 2.1-5.9) com-
pared with units of 41 through 100 (ORs, 1.4-2.2), 101
through 200 (ORs, 1.3-2.0), and 201 through 600 soldiers
(ORs, 1.3-2.4). Figure 2 indicates that the SREs generally
increased as a function of past-year unit SAs, with risk
increasing most substantially for those in smaller units.
Among soldiers in a unit with 5 or more past-year SAs, the
SRE for those in a unit of 1 through 40 soldiers was signifi-
cantly higher than the SREs for those in a unit of 41 through

CI, 2.7-2.9), and 201 through 600 soldiers (RR, 2.8; 95% CI,

year SAs, soldiers in units of 1 through 40 were at least twice
as likely to attempt suicide as those in larger units (ie,
41-600 troops; RRs, 2.3-3.6; 95% CI, 2.2-3.7; P < .001).
Discussion
Suicide attempts within an army unit are significant stress-
ors. We found that a soldier’
s risk of attempting suicide in-
creased as the number of past-year unit SAs increased, a ro-
bust association that persisted even after adjusting for
sociodemographic and service-related variables, unit size, pre-
vious mental health diagnosis, and past-year deaths due to sui-
cide, combat, and unintentional injury. The association also
persisted when examining number of past-year unit suicide at-
tempters (instead of attempts) as the predictor, excluding sol-
diers in their first 6 months of service, excluding soldiers in
Warrior Transition Units, and when adjusting for the number
ofsoldierswithinasoldier’
sunitwithapast-yearmentalhealth
diagnosis.
Previous research has primarily focused on soldiers’re-
sponses to suicide death, with less attention to responses af-
ter unit SAs. It is estimated that for every suicide, many people
are profoundly affected.29,30 Nearly half of veterans report
knowing someone who died by suicide,31 with 65% of those
knowing more than 1 decedent.32 Exposure to suicide death
(knowing of, knowing, or identifying with the person who died
by suicide33) predicts subsequent suicide ideation and at-
tempts in veterans and civilians,32,34 highlighting the impor-
tance of this risk factor among servicemembers. Contrary to
previous findings, which relate generally to knowing some-
one who had died by suicide, unit deaths of any type, includ-
ing suicide, were not significantly associated with risk of SA
in our study. Unit deaths are a more specific and circum-
scribed group than knowing someone, and the causal mecha-
nisms and responses (eg, of peers and leaders) may differ for
unit suicide deaths vs attempts in an active-duty army unit.
In addition, there is a lower frequency of unit deaths relative
to unit SAs, which may make it harder to detect the influence
of deaths in our sample. Intervention efforts that track unit SAs
regardless of whether unit members were acquainted with the
attempter may help identify at-risk groups.
We found that past-year unit SAs were associated with risk
ofSAregardlessofoccupationorunitsize.Amongcombatarms
and other occupations, risk of SA was twice as likely among
those in units with at least 5 past-year SAs vs units with none.
Risk was generally higher for soldiers in smaller vs larger units,
regardless of the number of past-year unit SAs. Among sol-
diers assigned to smaller units (1-40 soldiers), the association
of past-year unit SAs with subsequent risk of SA was particu-
larly pronounced.

service-related variables (sex, age at entry into the army, current age,
race/ethnicity, educational level, marital status, time in service, deployment
status, unit size, and number of past-year unit suicide attempts) and included
a dummy predictor variable for calendar month and year to control
for secular trends.

 Unit characteristics that persist over time, including lead-
ership quality, extent of social support and cohesion, and pres-
ence of bullying, may influence unit culture and affect the like-
lihood of and responses to unit SAs. Such characteristics may
be more influential in smaller units. For example, unit cohe-
sion has been associated with reduced distress, increased re-
silience, and positive states of mind.9 To the extent that SAs
among fellow soldiers disrupt a soldier’
s sense of unit cohe-
sion,ourfindingssuggestthatthenegativeeffectsmaybestron-
gest in smaller units. Similarly, the potential for contagion, par-
ticularly within smaller units, is worthy of further study.
Limitations
The current study has several limitations. First, the SA data
were from administrative and medical records and are there-
fore recognized SAs, although they perhaps include the most
severe accounts. These records may be subject to diagnostic
or coding errors. Second, these data focus exclusively on the
2004 through 2009 period, and findings may not generalize
to earlier and later periods of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars
or to other US military conflicts. Third, this study did not ex-
amine mechanisms of risk. Given the manner in which units
wereconstructedforanalysis,unitmembersmaynothavebeen
located in the same geographic area or had direct contact with
those who attempted suicide. It is important for future stud-
ies to explore potential mediators. Fourth, although we ex-
amined a range of individual and unit-level covariates, there
may be additional important indicators to consider. For ex-
ample, future studies should examine whether the associa-
tion of previous unit SAs with subsequent SA risk is modified
by other unit variables, including leadership quality and co-
hesion. Studies should also examine whether the recency of
previous unit SAs affects subsequent risk.

The SREs (number of soldiers who attempted suicide per 100 000
person-years) were calculated assuming other predictors were at their
sample-wide means. The SREs were calculated separately for each unit size
based on logistic regression models that included basic sociodemographic and
service-related variables (sex, age at entry into the army, current age,
race/ethnicity, educational level, marital status, time in service, deployment
status, military occupation, and number of past-year unit suicide attempts) and
included a dummy predictor variable for calendar month and year to control for
secular trends.

 Conclusions
Our study indicates that risk of SA among US Army soldiers
is influenced by a history of SAs within a soldier’
s unit and
that higher numbers of unit SAs are related to greater indi-
vidual suicide risk, particularly in smaller units. Attention
to unit characteristics by leadership and service profession-
als may be a component in SA reduction efforts. Early
unit-based postvention consisting of coordinated efforts
to provide behavioral, psychosocial, spiritual, and
public health support after SAs may be an essential tool
in promoting recovery and suicide prevention in
servicemembers.35
