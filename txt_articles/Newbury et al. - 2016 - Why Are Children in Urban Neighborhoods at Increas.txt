Background: Urban upbringing is associated with a 2-fold 
adulthood psychosis risk, and this association replicates 
for childhood psychotic symptoms. No study has investi-
gated whether specific features of urban neighborhoods 
increase children’s risk for psychotic symptoms, despite 
these early psychotic phenomena elevating risk for schizo-
phrenia and other psychiatric disorders in adulthood. 
Methods: Analyses were conducted on over 2000 children 
from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin 
Study, a nationally-representative cohort of UK-born twins. 
Neighborhood-level characteristics were assessed for each 
family via: a geodemographic discriminator indexing neigh-
borhood-level deprivation, postal surveys of over 5000 resi-
dents living alongside the children, and in-home interviews 
with the children’s mothers. Children were interviewed about 
psychotic symptoms at age 12. Analyses were adjusted for 
important family-level confounders including socioeco-
nomic status (SES), psychiatric history, and maternal psy-
chosis. Results: Urban residency at age-5 (OR = 1.80, 95% 
CI = 1.16–2.77) and age-12 (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.15–
2.69) were both significantly associated with childhood psy-
chotic symptoms, but not with age-12 anxiety, depression, 
or antisocial behavior. The association was not attributable 
to family SES, family psychiatric history, or maternal psy-
chosis, each implicated in childhood mental health. Low 
social cohesion, together with crime victimization in the 
neighborhood explained nearly a quarter of the association 
between urbanicity and childhood psychotic symptoms after 
considering family-level confounders. Conclusions: Low 
social cohesion and crime victimization in the neighborhood 
partly explain why children in cities have an elevated risk of 
developing psychotic symptoms. Greater understanding of 
the mechanisms leading from neighborhood-level exposures 
to psychotic symptoms could help target interventions for 
emerging childhood psychotic symptoms.

Introduction
Urban vs rural upbringing doubles a child’s odds of 
developing schizophrenia in adulthood.1 The association 
between urbanicity and psychosis has been frequently 
replicated,2–10 shows a degree of specificity to non-affec-
tive psychoses,4,7,11,12 and is not explained by a range of 
potential confounding factors2,13–15 including migration 
of individuals with schizophrenia into cities.16 These 
converging lines of evidence suggest that the association 
between urbanicity and psychosis has genuine aetiologi-
cal underpinnings,16–19 though the mechanisms driving 
the association are currently unknown. Urbanicity is 
therefore a key area for psychosis research, considering 
that over two-thirds of the world’s population are pre-
dicted to live in cities by 2050.20,21
The vast majority of urbanicity-psychosis research 
has focused on adult psychosis. Yet urban residency 
from birth to adolescence, rather than during adult-
hood, appears to be more strongly associated with adult

Urban Neighborhoods and Child Psychotic Symptoms
psychosis.6,10,13 Consistent with the neurodevelopmental 
model of schizophrenia, this suggests that the processes 
leading from urban exposure to psychosis begin in ado-
lescence, childhood, or earlier. Notably, positive psy-
chotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, 
are surprisingly prevalent among children in the general 
population.22–26 These early psychotic phenomena share 
familial and environmental risk factors with psychotic 
disorders,27–29 and whilst they are usually transitory,22,23,30 
children who experience psychotic symptoms have a 
significantly elevated risk for schizophrenia and other 
psychoses in adulthood.31,32 Additionally, childhood psy-
chotic symptoms have broad psychiatric relevance as they 
significantly heighten risk for other subsequent mental 
health difficulties including substance abuse,26 depres-
sion,26 PTSD,32 and suicidal behavior.32,33 Childhood 
psychotic symptoms are therefore a useful marker of 
early-life risk indicators for psychosis and general psy-
chopathology. Childhood psychotic symptoms could 
also shed light on the urbanicity-psychosis association: 
a handful of studies have shown that these symptoms 
occur more frequently29 and are more likely to persist into 
adulthood among youth living in urban vs nonurban set-
tings.34,35 However, no studies have tested whether specific 
aspects of the urban environment increase risk for psy-
chotic symptoms among children.
Indeed, urbanicity is only a proxy for the currently 
unknown operative risk factor(s) for psychosis.18,36 
More recently, attention has turned to potential urban 
characteristics37 operating at the neighborhood-level. 
Neighborhood-level deprivation has been frequently 
implicated in adult psychosis.17,38–43 However, modern 
urban neighborhoods are very mixed in terms of pov-
erty and affluence,44 whilst adult psychosis risk increases 
incrementally through increasing levels of urbanicity.2,3,6,13 
Furthermore, the association between urbanicity and 
psychosis appears stronger in more recent generations,9,45 
despite urban populations becoming generally wealthier. 
Thus, the association is difficult to explain through neigh-
borhood-level deprivation alone. Cumulative evidence 
also supports the importance of neighborhood-level 
social processes such as crime,40,46 disorganization46,47 
and social fragmentation37,39,41,48 in adult psychosis (thor-
oughly reviewed by March et al36), which are purported 
to increase adult psychosis risk by heightening childhood 
exposure to social stressors.18,19,49,50 Intriguingly, prodro-
mal status among young adults has been shown to fol-
low spatial patterning in accordance with these kinds 
of neighborhood-level psychosocial characteristics.51 
However, the longitudinal associations between neigh-
borhood-level social processes and childhood psychotic 
symptoms are currently unknown. Ultimately, such 
research could help target social and clinical interven-
tions for early psychotic symptoms.
Here we draw from sociological theory and evidence 
illustrating that neighborhood-level social processes 
mediate the effect of neighborhood structural features (eg, 
urbanicity) on a range of health outcomes.52–54 Guided by 
this theory and adult psychosis findings, the current study 
focuses on 4 neighborhood-level social processes: (1) 
social cohesion, describing the cohesiveness and support-
iveness of relationships between neighbors52; (2) social 
control, describing the likelihood that neighbors would 
intervene in problems in the neighborhood52; (3) neigh-
borhood disorder, describing physical and social evidence 
of disorder/threat within the neighborhood53; and (4) 
crime victimization, representing more direct experiences 
of victimization in the neighborhood (eg, mugging). The 
current study investigates the pathways leading from 
urbanicity to childhood psychotic symptoms, whilst dif-
ferentiating the effects of specific neighborhood-level 
social processes from family-level effects. We utilized a 
cohort of 2232 nationally-representative British twin 
children who have been followed from birth to age 12 and 
interviewed for psychotic symptoms at age 12. Our longi-
tudinal neighborhood-level measures were obtained from 
multiple sources, and neighborhood scores were allocated 
with fine geographic resolution (ie, postcode-level). With 
these measures, we asked: (1) Are children in urban vs 
nonurban neighborhoods at increased risk for psychotic 
symptoms? (2) Is this association specific to childhood 
psychotic symptoms? (3) Is the association between urba-
nicity and childhood psychotic symptoms explained by 
background characteristics of families living in cities? 
(4) Are urban neighborhoods more likely to lack social 
cohesion and social control and be characterized by dis-
order and crime? (5) Finally, does the level of social cohe-
sion, social control, neighborhood disorder, and crime 
victimization operating within neighborhoods mediate 
the effect of urban residency on childhood psychotic 
symptoms? We hypothesized that the effect of urbanicity 
on childhood psychotic symptoms would be specific to 
this phenotype, and mediated via exposure to low social 
cohesion and social control, and high disorder and crime 
victimization in the neighborhood (proposed pathways 
shown in figure 1).
Methods
Study Cohort
Participants were members of the Environmental Risk 
(E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the devel-
opment of a nationally-representative birth cohort of 2232 
British twin children. The sample was drawn from a larger 
cohort of twins born in England and Wales in 1994–1995.55 
Full details about the sample are reported elsewhere.56 
Briefly, the E-Risk sample was constructed in 1999–2000, 
when 1116 families with same-sex 5-year-old twins (93% 
of those eligible) participated in home-visit assessments. 
Families were recruited to represent the UK population of 
families with newborns in the 1990s, based on residential 
location throughout England and Wales and mothers’ age

(teenaged mothers with twins were over-selected to replace 
high-risk families who were selectively lost to the register 
through non-response. Older mothers having twins via 
assisted reproduction were under-selected to avoid an excess 
of well-educated older mothers). E-Risk families are repre-
sentative of UK households across the spectrum of neigh-
borhood-level deprivation: 25.6% of E-Risk families live 
in “wealthy achiever” neighborhoods compared to 25.3% 
of households nation-wide; 5.3% vs 11.6% live in “urban 
prosperity” neighborhoods; 29.6% vs 26.9% live in “com-
fortably off” neighborhoods; 13.4% vs 13.9% live in “mod-
erate means” neighborhoods; and 26.1% vs 20.7% live in 
“hard-pressed” neighborhoods.57,58 E-Risk families under-
represent “urban prosperity” neighborhoods because such 
households are likely to be childless. Sex was evenly distrib-
uted in the resulting sample (49% male). All families were 
English speaking, and the majority (93.7%) were White. 
Follow-up home-visits were conducted when children were 
aged 7, 10, and 12 (participation rates were 98%, 96%, and 
96%, respectively). At age 12, the E-Risk sample comprised 
2146 twin children, and the majority of these children had 
complete data on both psychotic symptoms and urbanicity 
at age 12 (95.7%; N = 2054). Over half of children (56.7%, 
N = 1180) never moved house at all between ages 5 and 12, 
and of those who did nearly two-thirds (65.0%) moved less 
than 500 meters. The Joint South London and Maudsley 
and the Institute of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee 
approved each phase of the study. Parents gave informed 
consent and children gave assent.
Measures
Childhood Psychotic Symptoms. E-Risk families were 
visited by mental health trainees or professionals when 
children were aged 12.29 Each child was privately inter-
viewed about 7 psychotic symptoms pertaining to delu-
sions and hallucinations, with items including “have 
other people ever read your thoughts?,” “have you ever 
thought you were being followed or spied on?,” and “have 
you ever heard voices that other people cannot hear?.” 
This interview has been described in detail previously.29 
The item choice was guided by the Dunedin Study’s age-
11 interview protocol31 and an instrument prepared for 
the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.59 
Interviewers coded each experience 0, 1, 2 indicating 
respectively “not a symptom,” “probable symptom,” and 
“definite symptom.” A conservative approach was taken 
in designating a child’s report as a symptom. First, the 
interviewer probed using standard prompts designed to 
discriminate between experiences that were plausible (eg, 
“I was followed by a man after school”) and potential 
symptoms (eg, “I was followed by an angel who guards 
my spirit”), and wrote down the child’s narrative descrip-
tion of the experience. Second, items and interviewer 
notes were assessed by a psychiatrist expert in schizo-
phrenia, a psychologist expert in interviewing children, 
and a child and adolescent psychiatrist to verify the valid-
ity of the symptoms. Third, because children were twins, 
experiences limited to the twin relationship (eg, “My 
twin and I often know what each other are thinking”) 
were coded as “not a symptom”. Children were only 
designated as experiencing psychotic symptoms if they 
reported at least one definite symptom. At age 12, 5.9% 
(N = 125) of children reported experiencing psychotic 
symptoms. This is similar to the prevalence of psychotic 
symptoms in other community samples of children and 
adolescents.22–26 Furthermore, we previously showed that 
childhood psychotic symptoms in this cohort have good

construct validity, sharing many of the genetic, social, 
neurodevelopmental, and behavioral risk factors and 
correlates as adult schizophrenia.29 Additionally, as we 
focused on psychotic symptoms rather than diagnoses, 
the present study design avoids confounding by psychiat-
ric service utilization.
Urbanicity. Urban/nonurban classification of E-Risk 
families’ neighborhoods was based on responses from a 
postal survey sent to residents living alongside E-Risk 
families when children were aged 12.60,61 Questionnaires 
were sent to every household in the same postcode as the 
E-Risk families, excluding the E-Risk families themselves 
(addresses were identified from electoral roll records). 
The number of surveys sent ranged from 15 to 50 resi-
dences per neighborhood (Average = 18.96, SE = 0.21). 
Excluding undelivered surveys (N = 600), the overall 
response rate was 28.1% (5601/19 926). Survey respon-
dents typically lived on the same street or within the same 
apartment block as the children in our study. Surveys 
were returned by an average of 5.18 (SD = 2.73) respon-
dents per neighborhood (range = 0–18 respondents), and 
there were at least 2 responses from 95% of the neigh-
borhoods (N = 5601 respondents).61 Residents reported 
whether their neighborhood was in “a city,” “a town,” 
“a suburb,” “a small village,” or “the countryside.”29 
There was high agreement between residents in the same 
neighborhood, with only 50 neighborhoods returning 
discordant responses (ie, neighborhoods where residents 
differed in their urbanicity responses). These 50 ambigu-
ous neighborhoods were clarified by a British researcher 
(blind to any phenotypic/identifying data) using the chil-
dren’s full postcode, Google Aerial view and the Office 
of National Statistics’ population density map (http://
www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/
PopulationDensity_2010.html, last accessed April 28, 
2016), based on a combination of features including 
population density, building density, proximity to the 
countryside or city/town centre, land-use (eg, agriculture, 
transportation, industry, etc.), and the official definition 
of the settlement. This same method was used to esti-
mate urbanicity at age-5 for the 35% of children who had 
moved over 500 metres between ages 5 and 12. For ease 
of interpretation and to increase analytic power, urbanic-
ity is herein dichotomized as urban (1: city/town) vs non-
urban (0: suburb/small village/countryside). At age 12, 
the sample was split evenly between urban and nonurban 
neighborhoods, with 51.9% (N = 1066) of children liv-
ing in urban neighborhoods and the remaining 988 chil-
dren living in nonurban neighborhoods. Similarly, 55.1% 
(N = 1117) lived in urban neighborhoods at age 5.
Neighborhood-Level Deprivation. Neighborhood-level 
deprivation was constructed using A Classification of 
Residential Neighbourhoods (ACORN), a geodemo-
graphic discriminator developed by CACI Information 
Services (http://www.caci.co.uk/, last accessed April 28, 
2016).57 Detailed information about ACORN’s classifica-
tion of neighborhood-level socioeconomic-status (SES) 
has been provided previously.58,60,62 Briefly, CACI uti-
lized over 400 variables from 2001 census data for Great 
Britain (eg, educational qualifications, unemployment, 
housing tenure) and CACI’s consumer lifestyle data-
base. Following hierarchical-cluster-analysis, 5 distinct 
and homogeneous ordinal groups were created ranging 
from “Wealthy Achiever” (coded 1) to “Hard Pressed” 
(coded 5) neighborhoods. Each family in our sample was 
matched to the ACORN code for its neighborhood via 
its postcode (age 5 or age 12 postcode, where relevant).58
Neighborhood-Level Social Processes. Social processes 
included social cohesion, social control, neighborhood 
disorder and crime victimization, and were measured in 
both early and late childhood. Social processes were first 
measured at age 5 via in-home interviews with the chil-
dren’s mothers.63 Social cohesion52 (5 items) was assessed 
by asking mothers whether their neighborhood was close-
knit, whether neighbors shared values, and whether neigh-
bors trusted and got along with each other, etc. Higher 
scores indicate greater social cohesion. Social control52 (5 
items) was assessed by asking mothers to judge whether 
people in their neighborhoods would take action against 
different types of undesirable activities (eg, children skip-
ping school, fights in public places). Higher scores indicate 
greater social control. For neighborhood disorder,53 moth-
ers were asked whether 13 problems affected their neigh-
borhood, including noisy neighbors, arguments or loud 
parties, vandalism, graffiti or deliberate damage to prop-
erty, and cars broken into. Higher scores indicate greater 
neighborhood disorder. Crime victimization was assessed 
by asking mothers whether they or their family had been 
victimized by violent crime (eg, mugging, assault), a 
burglary, or a theft in the neighborhood. Higher scores 
indicate greater crime victimization. Items (each coded 
0–2) within each social process scale were summed for 
each mother. Social processes were also measured when 
children were aged 12 via the resident surveys60,61 (survey 
methodology described in detail under urbanicity head-
ing). Residents were asked the same questions regarding 
these 4 neighborhood-level social processes. For the res-
ident reports, the social process scales were created in 2 
steps. First, items belonging to each social process scale 
were averaged to create summary scores for each of the 
5601 respondents. Second, scores for each E-Risk fam-
ily were created by averaging the social process scores of 
respondents within that neighborhood.
Thus, neighborhood-level social processes were esti-
mated both before and contemporaneously to child-
hood psychotic symptoms, enabling us to triangulate a 
prospective design with objective neighborhood apprais-
als. At age 5, mothers’ views of the neighborhood were 
used as mothers are considered more reliable reporters

than children at this age and because their perceptions 
are likely to influence their children’s amount of exposure 
and experiences in the neighborhood.64,65 At age 12, resi-
dent reports were used to gain more objective and com-
prehensive assessments of the neighborhood. As children 
themselves reported on their own psychotic symptoms 
at age 12, both our age-5 (mother-reported) and age-12 
(resident-reported) assessments of neighborhood-level 
social processes are obtained from independent sources.
Other Age-12 Outcomes. Anxiety was assessed when 
children were aged 12, via private interviews using the 
10-item version of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for 
Children (MASC).66 An extreme anxiety group was formed 
with children who scored at or above the 95th percentile 
(N = 129, 6.1%). Depression symptoms were assessed at 
age 12 using the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI).67 
Children who scored 20 or more68 were deemed to have 
clinically significant depressive symptoms (N = 74, 3.5%). 
Antisocial behavior was assessed using the Achenbach sys-
tem of empirically-based assessment.69 An extreme antiso-
cial behavior group was formed with children who scored 
at or above the 95th percentile (N = 110, 5.1%), based on 
combined mother and teacher reports at age 12.70
Family-Level Confounders. Family SES was measured 
via a composite of parental income (total household), 
education (highest mother/father), and occupation 
(highest mother/father) when children were aged 5, and 
was categorized into tertiles (ie, low-, medium-, and 
high-SES). Family psychiatric history and maternal psy-
chosis were both assessed when children were aged 12. In 
private interviews, mothers reported on family history of 
DSM disorders,71 which was converted to a proportion 
(0–1.0) of family members with a history of psychiatric 
disorder. For maternal psychosis, mothers were inter-
viewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule72 for 
DSM-IV73 which provides a symptom count for charac-
teristic symptoms of schizophrenia (eg, hallucinations, 
delusions, anhedonia).
Statistical Analysis. Analyses were conducted in 
STATA 11.2 (Stata-Corp). Firstly, linear regression 
was used to investigate the association between urban-
icity and neighborhood-level social processes (table 1). 
Secondly, logistic regression was used to investigate the 
associations between neighborhood-level social processes 
and childhood psychotic symptoms (table 2). Thirdly, 
our mediation analyses utilized KHB pathway decom-
position (table 3).74 This procedure partitions the total 
effect of one variable (urbanicity) on another variable 
(childhood psychotic symptoms) into the direct effect 
(which also includes the effects of unknown/unspecified 
mediators and measurement error), and indirect effects 
explained by specified mediators (neighborhood-level 
social processes). Age-5 urbanicity is used when age-5 
social processes are analyzed; age-12 urbanicity is used 
when age-12 social processes are analyzed. As the scales 
differed between the age-5 (mother-reported) and age-12 
(resident-reported) social process variables, social process 
variables in steps 2 and 3 were standardized with a mean 
of 0 and a SD of 1 (subtraction of the mean then divi-
sion by the SD) to facilitate comparability of the results. 
Where appropriate, analyses accounted for the non-
independence of observations using the “CLUSTER” 
command because the sample comprised twins. This 
procedure is derived from the Huber-White variance 
estimator, and provides robust standard errors adjusted 
for within-cluster correlated data75 (Note: within-pair 
twin correlations can also be corrected using multi-level 
approaches. Supplementary table 1 shows that our main 
logistic regression analyses are highly robust to alterna-
tive estimation procedures.).
Results
Are Children in Urban vs Nonurban Neighborhoods at 
Increased Risk for Psychotic Symptoms?
There was a significant cross-sectional association between 
age-12 urban residency and childhood psychotic symp-
toms (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.15–2.69, P = .009). Around 
7.4% (N = 79) of urban-dwelling children compared to 
4.4% (N = 43) of nonurban-dwelling children experienced 
at least one definite psychotic symptom at age 12. The 
association between urbanicity and psychotic symptoms 
held when analyses were restricted to the 56.6% of children 
who never moved house between ages 5 and 12 (OR = 2.01, 
95% CI = 1.14–3.58, P = .017), and when controlling for 
residential mobility during this period (OR = 1.71, 95% 
CI = 1.12–2.61, P = .014). The association also held 
for the 93.7% of children who were ethnically White 
(OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.21–2.84, P = .005). Although in 
our sample there was a tendency for urban neighborhoods 
to be more deprived (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.99–3.32, P < 
.001), half of urban neighborhoods were relatively afflu-
ent (ACORN categories 1–3; 50.3%), and over a quarter 
of nonurban neighborhoods were considered deprived 
(ACORN categories 4 and 5; 27.8%). Moreover, when 
urbanicity and neighborhood deprivation were included 
in a logistic regression model together, they were both sig-
nificantly associated with childhood psychotic symptoms 
(OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.03–2.56, P = .039; OR = 1.62, 
95% CI = 1.05–2.50, P = .029, respectively), demonstrat-
ing that urbanicity is associated with childhood psychotic 
symptoms largely independently of neighborhood-level 
deprivation in this sample. Additionally, the associa-
tion between urbanicity and childhood psychotic symp-
toms held when earlier urbanicity at age 5 was examined 
(OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.16–2.77, P = .008). Therefore, the 
remaining analyses in this article will focus on tracing the 
effects of urbanicity (age-5 or age-12, where appropriate) 
on childhood psychotic symptoms.

Urban Neighborhoods and Child Psychotic Symptoms
Is Urbanicity Specifically Associated With Childhood 
Psychotic Symptoms?
Our assumption of specificity to psychotic symptoms 
was tentatively supported, as associations between 
age-12 urbanicity and age-12 depression (OR = 1.16, 
95% CI = 0.69–1.96, P = .571), anxiety (OR = 1.42, 
95% CI = 0.95–2.12, P = .091) and antisocial behavior 
(OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.59–1.47, P = .753) were each 
nonsignificant, with smaller effect sizes than demon-
strated for psychotic symptoms. However, given that the 
CIs for both depression and anxiety included the point 
estimate for the association between age-12 urbanicity 
and childhood psychotic symptoms (OR = 1.76), we can-
not be sure that these associations differed significantly. 
Nevertheless, after simultaneous adjustment for age-12 
depression, anxiety and antisocial behavior, urbanic-
ity remained significantly associated with childhood 
psychotic symptoms (OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.15–2.65, 
P = .009), suggesting that urbanicity was independently 
associated with childhood psychotic symptoms in this 
sample. Furthermore, the associations between urban-
icity and these 3 additional age-12 outcomes remained 
nonsignificant when they were recategorized at a lower 
threshold (80th percentile), suggesting that the negative 
findings were not due to inadequate power (results avail-
able upon request).

Note: The sample sizes and total effect ORs vary slightly for the age-5 mother reports of social processes, due to small numbers of children missing data on neighborhood-
level social processes and/or family-level covariates. These sample size differences also account for the difference between the main effect OR (1.80) and the total effect ORs for 
mother reports in Mediation model 1. Social processes can still be compared for the percentage that they mediate the total effect of urbanicity. We also conducted mediation 
analyses using Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) in Mplus to include all available cases at age 5 (N = 2232 for all Models reported) and found no differences 
in the size, direction or pattern of effects. Total effect = overall association between urbanicity and childhood psychotic symptoms; direct effect = the part of the overall 
association that is not explained by the mediator/covariates in the model; and indirect effect = the part of the overall association that is explained by the social process mediator 
in the model. Bold text denotes significant indirect (mediation) pathways at P < .05. All analyses account for the nonindependence of twin observations. All social process 
variables have been standardized with a mean of 0 and a SD of 1.

psychosis.

Urban Neighborhoods and Child Psychotic Symptoms
Is the Association Between Urbanicity and Childhood 
Psychotic Symptoms Explained by Background 
Characteristics of Families Living in Cities?
The association between age-12 urbanicity and child-
hood psychotic symptoms did not appear to be explained 
by 3 key potential family-level confounders, namely fam-
ily SES, family psychiatric history and maternal psycho-
sis. Simultaneous adjustment for these proxy indicators 
of genetic and environmental risk only slightly attenuated 
the association between age-12 urbanicity and childhood 
psychotic symptoms (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.04–2.51, 
P = .035).
Are Urban Neighborhoods More Likely to Lack Social 
Cohesion and Social Control and Be Characterized by 
Disorder and Crime?
Associations of urbanicity with neighborhood-level 
social processes are shown in table 1. At age 5, urban 
neighborhoods had (ie, mothers reported) significantly 
lower social cohesion and social control, and signifi-
cantly higher neighborhood disorder and crime victim-
ization than nonurban neighborhoods (all Ps < .001). 
Similar bivariate associations were found been urbanicity 
and social processes for age-12 neighborhoods (residents’ 
reports) (all Ps < .001; table 1).
Associations of neighborhood-level social processes 
with childhood psychotic symptoms are shown in table 2. 
Children were significantly less likely to experience psy-
chotic symptoms at age 12 if, at age 5, they lived in neigh-
borhoods with higher social cohesion (P < .001) and 
higher social control (P = .003). In contrast, children were 
significantly more likely to experience psychotic symp-
toms at age 12 if their age-5 neighborhood was charac-
terized by higher neighborhood disorder (P = .010) and 
higher crime victimization (P < .001). A comparable cross-
sectional pattern was found for the associations between 
age-12 neighborhood-level social processes and childhood 
psychotic symptoms, though social control was borderline 
statistically significant (P = .050) and neighborhood-level 
crime victimization failed to reach conventional levels of 
statistical significance (P = .123; table 2).
Do Neighborhood-Level Social Processes Mediate the 
Effect of Urban Residency on Childhood Psychotic 
Symptoms?
We investigated the extent that neighborhood-level social 
processes mediated the effect of urban residency on child-
hood psychotic symptoms (figure 1). Social processes 
were only included if they were significantly associated 
with both urbanicity and childhood psychotic symptoms 
(ie, age-12 neighborhood-level crime victimization was 
excluded as it was not associated with childhood psychotic 
symptoms at P < .05). Table 3 shows results as odds ratios 
with 95% CIs for the total (overall association), direct 
(the part of the overall association that is not explained 
by the mediator/covariates in the model) and indirect (the 
part of the overall association that is explained by the 
social process mediator in the model) effects of urba-
nicity on childhood psychotic symptoms. A model in 
which the indirect OR is equal to the total OR would 
indicate that the effect of the predictor on the outcome 
is entirely (100%) mediated by the specified mediator. 
Mediation model 1 is unadjusted, and Mediation model 
2 is adjusted for family-level confounders (family SES, 
family psychiatric history, maternal psychosis) (Note: 
sample size and total effect ORs vary slightly within 
table 3 due to small numbers of children missing data on 
age-5 neighborhood-level social processes and/or family-
level confounders. Further detail is provided in Table 3’s 
footnote.). Mediation model 1 shows that neighborhood-
level low social cohesion at age 5 significantly mediated 
the effect of age-5 urbanicity on age-12 psychotic symp-
toms, explaining 25% of the association. Low social con-
trol and high crime victimization in the neighborhood 
also significantly mediated the effect of age-5 urbanic-
ity on childhood psychotic symptoms, each explaining 
13% of the association. These prospective models were 
somewhat supported by our cross-sectional analysis of 
age-12 urbanicity and age-12 social processes, in that low 
social cohesion once again significantly explained the 
largest proportion of the association between urbanicity 
and childhood psychotic symptoms (19%). These media-
tory effects were slightly attenuated after considering 
family-level confounders (Mediation model 2, table 3). 
Nonetheless, following adjustment, neighborhood-level 
low social cohesion and high crime victimization at age 5 
still significantly mediated the effect of age-5 urbanicity 
on childhood psychotic symptoms (explaining 17% and 
11%, respectively). When age-5 social cohesion and crime 
victimization were simultaneously modeled, together they 
explained nearly a quarter of the effect of age-5 urbanic-
ity on age-12 psychotic symptoms (24%: OR = 1.11, 95% 
CI = 1.03–1.20, P = .004).
Discussion
This is the first study to investigate whether specific psy-
chosocial features of the urban environment increase chil-
dren’s risk for psychotic symptoms. Our findings add to 
existing knowledge in at least 3 ways. First, children living 
in urban neighborhoods were ~80% more likely to experi-
ence psychotic symptoms at age 12 compared to children 
living in nonurban neighborhoods. This association held 
in both prospective and cross-sectional models, and was 
not explained by the socioeconomic or psychiatric com-
position of urban families. Second, psychotic symptoms 
were more common among children living in neighbor-
hoods characterized by low social cohesion, low social 
control, high neighborhood disorder, and where the fam-
ily had been directly victimized by a crime. Our findings

J. Newbury et al
highlight that these neighborhood-level social processes, 
which are implicated in adult psychosis,17,37,39,40,46–48 may 
also be relevant to positive psychotic symptoms in child-
hood. Third, low social cohesion explained the largest 
proportion of the effect of urbanicity on childhood psy-
chotic symptoms, regardless of reporter (17% for mother 
reports, 10% for resident reports), and independently of 
the potential family-level confounders measured in this 
study. Furthermore, social cohesion together with crime 
victimization at age-5 explained almost a quarter of the 
effect of age-5 urbanicity on childhood psychotic symp-
toms. Though we have investigated childhood psychotic 
symptoms as the main outcome measure, our findings 
regarding social cohesion and crime victimization are 
consistent with previous studies implicating area-level 
social fragmentation39,41,47 (or related constructs) and 
crime40,46 in adult psychosis.
A significant minority of children experience persistent 
psychotic symptoms and eventual clinical diagnosis.31,32 
Furthermore, urban upbringing is highly correlated 
with urban adult residency.6 Taken together, ours and 
previous findings are consistent with the proposal that 
early-life exposure to neighborhood-level social stress-
ors contributes to the heightened psychosis rates found 
in cities.17–19,49,50 From a child’s perspective, growing up 
in a crowded neighborhood characterized by insecure/
nonexistent social support networks, unfriendly/unpre-
dictable interactions between neighbors, and fear of/
exposure to crime could promote psychotic symptoms in 
various mutually compatible ways. Prolonged exposure 
to neighborhood-level social stressors could dysregulate 
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,76 dopaminergic 
system,50 and/or neurodevelopment,21 increasing risk for 
psychotic symptoms particularly among children with 
genetic predisposition.77 A cognitive mechanism, with 
specific adverse neighborhood-level experiences exacer-
bating or providing content to emerging delusions and 
hallucinations78 could also explain why urbanicity was 
associated with positive psychotic symptoms but not 
significantly with anxiety or depression.79 These neigh-
borhood effects could also be transmitted indirectly by 
heightening children’s exposure to family-level stress 
or even maltreatment. Indeed, low neighborhood-level 
social cohesion appears to undermine positive parent-
ing practices.80 The individual-level factors and potential 
mechanisms leading from neighborhood-level adverse 
exposures to childhood psychotic symptoms now require 
attention. For example, children raised in urban vs non-
urban neighborhoods could differ in their neurocogni-
tive reactivity to social stress, as recently demonstrated 
among healthy adults.81,82
Limitations
Five limitations deserve mention. First, causal infer-
ence is limited as families were not randomly selected 
into neighborhoods. Whilst we adjusted for a number of 
important proxy measures of genetic and environmen-
tal risk, various non/reverse-causal explanations remain 
possible. Future research with larger samples, and ideally 
quasi-experimental designs, are required to more persua-
sively rule out social selection as an explanation for these 
findings. The role of gene-environment correlation (eg, 
individuals with higher genetic risk for psychosis “drift-
ing” into urban neighborhoods) can also now be estimated 
via emerging methods such as polygenic risk score analy-
sis. Second, childhood psychotic symptoms are relatively 
rare, with only ~6% of children reporting symptoms in 
the E-Risk cohort at age 12. Our findings would benefit 
from replication. Third, this low base-rate also made it 
necessary to dichotomize urbanicity to increase power. 
This potentially simplified our findings, particularly given 
previous evidence for a dose-response urbanicity-psycho-
sis association through the range of urbanicity. Fourth, 
although childhood psychotic symptoms are thought to lie 
on a continuum with schizophrenia,83 they are also asso-
ciated with other psychiatric disorders in adulthood26,32,33 
and therefore the current findings may extend beyond 
schizophrenia to risk for serious adult psychopathology in 
general. Finally, the E-Risk cohort is a twin sample, and 
whether findings from twin studies generalize to singletons 
is sometimes contested. However, the children in our study 
are representative of singletons for the prevalence of psy-
chotic symptoms,22–26 and representative of UK families in 
terms of geographic and socioeconomic distribution.57,58
Importantly, neighborhood-level social processes did 
not completely explain the effect of urbanicity in our anal-
yses. Future investigations should consider a wider range 
of potential social and physical neighborhood-level char-
acteristics when testing for environmental contributions 
to childhood psychotic symptoms. Neighborhood-level 
physical exposures such as noise, light, and air pollution, 
as well as exposure to viral infections warrant research 
in relation to early psychotic symptoms. The modest 
mediation could also be partly attributable to measure-
ment error entailed in the neighborhood-level social 
process measures. Additionally, it is possible that up to 
age 12 the children in our study were relatively sheltered 
from certain threats in their neighborhoods. Cumulative 
neighborhood-level exposures, from childhood, through 
adolescence and into adulthood, may each contribute in 
different ways or combine to increase risk for psychotic 
symptoms. It will therefore be important to investigate 
the contribution of neighborhood-level social processes 
to the emergence of psychotic symptoms in late adoles-
cence, when many children will have experienced more 
direct exposure to adversity in their neighborhood.
Conclusion
In this study, the increased risk for childhood psychotic 
symptoms in urban neighborhoods was explained, in

part, by lower levels of social cohesion and higher levels 
of crime victimization operating within these neighbor-
hoods. If these novel findings are replicated, they could 
support the role of exposure to neighborhood-level social 
stressors in the aetiology of childhood psychotic symp-
toms.17,18,46 Populations are becoming increasingly urban, 
and child and adolescent psychopathology represents a 
growing proportion of the global burden of disease.84 
The present findings therefore underscore the emerging 
need to identify the social, psychological, and biological 
pathways leading from neighborhood-level exposures to 
childhood psychotic symptoms.
