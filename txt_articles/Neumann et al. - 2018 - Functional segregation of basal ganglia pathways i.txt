Dopamine exerts modulatory signals on cortex–basal ganglia circuits to enable flexible motor control. Parkinson’s disease is
characterized by a loss of dopaminergic innervation in the basal ganglia leading to complex motor and non-motor symptoms.
Clinical symptom alleviation through dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus likely
depends on a complex interplay between converging basal ganglia pathways. As a unique translational research platform, deep
brain stimulation allows instantaneous investigation of functional effects of subthalamic neuromodulation in human patients with
Parkinson’s disease. The present study aims at disentangling the role of the inhibitory basal ganglia pathways in cognitive and
kinematic aspects of automatic and controlled movements in healthy and parkinsonian states by combining behavioural experi-
ments, clinical observations, whole-brain deep brain stimulation fibre connectivity mapping and computational modelling. Twenty
patients with Parkinson’s disease undergoing subthalamic deep brain stimulation and 20 age-matched healthy controls participated
in a visuomotor tracking task requiring normal (automatic) and inverted (controlled) reach movements. Parkinsonian patients on
and off deep brain stimulation presented complex patterns of reaction time and kinematic changes, when compared to healthy
controls. Stimulation of cortico-subthalamic fibres was correlated with reduced reaction time adaptation to task demand, but not
kinematic aspects of motor control or alleviation of Parkinson’s disease motor signs. By using clinically, behaviourally and fibre
tracking informed computational models, our study reveals that loss of cognitive adaptation can be attributed to modulation of the
hyperdirect pathway, while kinematic depends on suppression of indirect pathway activity. Our findings suggest that hyperdirect
and indirect pathways, converging in the subthalamic nucleus, are differentially involved in cognitive aspects of cautious motor
preparation and kinematic gain control during motor performance. Subthalamic deep brain stimulation modulates but does not
restore these functions. Intelligent stimulation algorithms could re-enable flexible motor control in Parkinson’s disease when
adapted to instantaneous environmental demand. Our results may inspire new innovative pathway-specific approaches to
reduce side effects and increase therapeutic efficacy of neuromodulation in patients with Parkinson’s disease.

Introduction
The cortex–basal ganglia–thalamic circuit embodies a cru-
cial network for behavioural control (Albin et al., 1989).
Alterations in basal ganglia signalling lead to changes in
behaviour and have been frequently reported in diverse
neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized
by perturbed motor control (DeLong, 1990). Parkinson’s
disease is the most prevalent basal ganglia disorder and
causally linked to a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the
substantia nigra pars compacta, resulting in a depletion of
dopamine in the striatum. Studies in animal models of
dopamine depletion have guided the development of a sim-
plified but still useful circuit model of parkinsonism in
which the hypodopaminergic state leads to an imbalance
in the prokinetic direct and inhibitory indirect striatal–
pallidal pathways through a shift in dopamine dependent
firing rate modulation of striatal medium spiny neurons
(MSNs) (Albin et al., 1989). Loss of dopamine reduces
D1 receptor dependent direct pathway MSN activation
and increases D2 receptor dependent indirect pathway
MSN inhibition resulting in increased GABAergic pallidal
output to the thalamus (Wichmann and DeLong, 1996).
The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is part of the indirect path-
way and drives pallidal GABAergic output through gluta-
matergic synapses. High frequency deep brain stimulation
(DBS) of the STN was probed to reduce increased firing of
the indirect pathway, after the observation that lesioning
this nucleus in the MPTP non-human primate model of
parkinsonism
had
beneficial
effects
(Bergman
et
al.,
1990). Subthalamic DBS is now an established treatment
for Parkinson’s disease patients with motor complications
(Deuschl et al., 2006; Weaver et al., 2009; Schuepbach
et al., 2013), but the exact mechanisms of DBS-induced
changes in motor and non-motor symptoms remain elusive.
The identification of a third, ‘hyperdirect’ cortico–subtha-
lamic pathway (Nambu et al., 2002) implicated the STN in
a cognitive inhibition network that delays behavioural re-
sponses in favour of outcome optimization (Aron et al.,
2016). Subthalamic DBS is hypothesized to suppress the
hyperdirect pathway dependent modulation of subthalamic
activity (Frank et al., 2007; Herz et al., 2018), but the
cognitive effects in patients with Parkinson’s disease have
so far not been empirically integrated into a holistic ac-
count of DBS effects on cognition, movement control and
motor disability. Conceptually, the basal ganglia have been
proposed to integrate inhibitory control across motor and
non-motor
domains
in
favour
of
adaptive
behaviour
(Jahanshahi et al., 2015). Inspired by the rise of cell-type
specific optogenetic manipulation that has recently actuated
a re-evaluation of classic basal ganglia pathway hypotheses
in behaving animals (Lee et al., 2017), we designed a study
to disentangle the effects of DBS on cognition and motor
performance. The aims of the study were (i) to differentiate
cognitive demand dependent STN DBS effects on motor
preparation and execution; and (ii) to segregate the hyper-
direct versus indirect pathway modulation driving these
effects. We demonstrate that subthalamic DBS reduces reac-
tion times only in the condition with higher cognitive
inhibitory demand, while movement velocity is globally
increased independently of task difficulty. Next, we use
fibre tracking to elucidate a cortico–subthalamic connectiv-
ity pattern between the supplementary motor area (SMA)
and the STN that is linked to the DBS effect on cognitive
motor control. Finally, we predict and test differential
effects of DBS on the hyperdirect and indirect pathways
through alterations in a clinically and fibre tracking in-
formed basal ganglia network model.

mean � standard error of the mean (SEM)]. Patients with
prominent tremor in the dominant hand were excluded from
the study, to avoid contamination of kinematic traces through
tremulous movements. The clinical details are summarized in
Table 1. To account for changes both on and off subthalamic
stimulation in patients with Parkinson’s disease, a group of 20
age-matched healthy participants was recruited (17 males, age

agent (ON) and compared to a subgroup of age and Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) matched DBS pa-
tients (Patients 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11 and 16–19) to validate the

 deficits, all patients were examined for parkinsonian symptoms
using the motor part of the UPDRS-III on and off DBS and
ON and OFF levodopa in the group of non-DBS patients with
Parkinson’s disease. The study was approved by the local ethics
committee with the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.
For all participants, written informed consent was obtained
before inclusion in the study. All participants engaged in a
visuomotor task (Fig. 1A), where they had to steer a cursor
using a pen on a digitizing tablet (Intuos Pro, Wacom) to
round target areas appearing in one of eight pseudorandomized
circularly arranged positions on a 15” computer screen 40cm in
front of them. The task was programmed in MATLAB (The
Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) using the cogent toolbox.
Trials started when the cursor position was moved to a central
fixation cross. After 3 s without movement a warning cue ap-
peared for 500 ms as a yellow circle surrounding the fixation
cross and 500 ms later the target appeared. The subjects could
respond
immediately
after
the
target appeared.
The
task
included two pen-to-cursor mapping conditions. In the auto-
matic condition (green target), the pen-to-cursor mapping was
congruent, while in the controlled condition (red target), the
pen-to-cursor mapping was inverted. All participants completed
60 trials of each condition split into blocks of 30 trials (ordered

Participants engaged in a visuomotor tracking task (A) in which
a target appeared on one of eight circular positions surrounding
the fixation cross to which they had to steer a cursor (little black
dot) using a pen on a digitizing tablet in front of the screen.
In the automatic condition green targets appeared indicating
congruent pen-to-cursor mapping, whereas in the controlled con-
dition pen-to-cursor mapping was inverted. Patients with
Parkinson’s disease were tested twice, off and on subthalamic DBS,
which had a significant effect on clinical motor symptom severity
measured with UPDRS-III scores (B; box and whisker depict mean,
error bars indicate SEM).

 block: 4 � 30 trials). The condition was announced before each
block, so that the patients could prepare for the pen-to-cursor
mapping. The condition of the first block (automatic versus
controlled) was randomized across patients and healthy con-
trols. All patients completed the 180 trials twice, once with
subthalamic stimulation turned on for at least 30min and
once after subthalamic stimulation was switched off for at
least 30min before task performance. Again, the starting stimu-
lation condition was pseudo-randomized across patients (10
started on stimulation, 10 started off stimulation). Cursor move-
ment traces were saved for offline analysis by converting the
concurrent cursor positions in the x- and y-axes to analogue
signals using a National Instruments digital analogue converter
(NI-USB 6212; National Instruments) that were recorded on a
separate computer using Spike2 software with a 1401 Power
Mk2 (CED) A-D converter with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz for
offline analysis. All movement traces were analysed using
custom MATLAB code. Reaction times were defined as the
time between target appearance and the first increase in move-
ment acceleration in either of the two axes. Movement times
were defined as the time between movement onset and the
cursor reaching the target in each trial. Movement velocity
was calculated as the peak of the first derivative of the move-
ment traces. Movement trajectory error was calculated as the
average difference between the optimal movement trajectory
(straight line) connecting the fixation cross and the target en-
trance of the cursor interpolated for the length of the move-
ment. Deviation from a straight trajectory leads to increased
distance that needs to be covered and is therefore considered
less optimal. In a separate block in the same participants, each
subject completed 60 trials with conditions pseudo-randomly
appearing without prior knowledge of the upcoming trial
(random block: 1 � 60 trials). This was designed to validate
the generalizability of potential DBS induced reaction time ef-
fects to the automatic condition, if the patients are not informed
of the pen-to-cursor mapping in advance.
DBS electrode localization and
fibre tracking
All patients exhibited satisfactory symptom alleviation through
subthalamic DBS with an average improvement in UPDRS-III
scores of 60 � 2.8% on top of medication as assessed during
the experiment (Fig. 1B). The DBS electrodes were localized
(Fig. 3A) using Lead-DBS (Horn and Ku
¨hn, 2015; www.lead-
dbs.org) in 19 of 20 patients (Patient 11 was excluded from
the fibre tracking analysis because preoperative images were
not available for this study, as the patient was operated in
another surgical centre). In brief, postoperative images were co-
registered to preoperative MRI using SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.
uscl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12).
After
visual
inspection,
co-
registrations were manually refined if necessary. Pre- and post-
operative
acquisitions were
spatially normalized
into
MNI
ICBM152 NLIN 2009b stereotactic space using a diffeomorphic
registration
algorithm
using
geodesic
shooting
and
Gauss-
Neuwton optimization (SHOOT) as implemented in SPM12
(Ashburner and Friston, 2011). SHOOT registration was per-
formed by directly registering tissue segmentations of preopera-
tive
acquisitions
(obtained
using
the
unified
Segmentation
approach; (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) to a SHOOT template
created from tissue priors defined by the MNI atlas (http://nist.
mni.mcgill.ca/?p=904) supplied within Lead-DBS software (Horn
and Ku
¨hn, 2015; www.lead-dbs.org). Electrodes were localized in
the aforementioned MNI space using the semi-automatic imple-
mentation in Lead-DBS. Active DBS contacts in the stimulation
on condition were then identified and a spherical region of inter-
est with a radius of 1mm roughly reflecting the cylindrical DBS
contacts (1.27 diameter, 1.5mm length) was created as a seed
region projected to an openly available group connectome (www.
lead-dbs.org) previously used in Horn et al. (2017b, c), which
was derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images
of 90 patients of the Parkinson’s progression markers initiative
(PPMI) database (Marek, 2011). All scanning parameters are
published on the website (www.ppmi-info.org). Whole brain trac-
tography fibre sets were calculated using a generalized q-sam-
pling imaging algorithm as implemented in DSI studio (http://
dsi-studio.labsolver.org) within a white-matter mask after seg-
mentation with SPM12. All fibre tracts were transformed into
MNI space as previously described (Horn et al., 2014, 2017c;
Ewert et al., 2018). The current study used connectome data
from large cohorts of patients with Parkinson’s disease rather
than connectivity data from individual patients. This is a major
practical advantage, as MRI-based connectivity data are not rou-
tinely acquired in DBS patients, making the current results ap-
plicable to a greater number of patients with Parkinson’s disease,
who most often will not have their own connectivity data, and
may facilitate generalizability of our approach to other DBS in-
dications (Fox et al., 2014). Beyond this practical advantage,
there is also a theoretical advantage in using normative connec-
tome data, which has significantly better signal to noise than data
from single patients. Connectome datasets are acquired on special
MRI hardware, often with cohort sizes in the thousands, leading
to connectivity estimates that are much more robust than those
from individual patients. A sensorimotor cortex mask including
the SMA and the preSMA was created based on the Automated
Anatomical Labeling Atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). The
hyperdirect pathway was defined by identifying fibres that ori-
ginate in the sensorimotor cortex and traverse the STN. Fibre
tracking gives a relative (and indirect) estimate of potential white
matter tracts connecting predefined regions of interest and should
not be misunderstood as anatomical truth. Nevertheless, for the
sake of simplicity, all fibres identified to connect the STN directly
to sensorimotor regions are further denominated as hyperdirect
pathway fibres. The amount of fibres affected by stimulation was
quantified by identifying hyperdirect pathway fibres traversing
the spherical active contact regions of interest for each patient.
To investigate the relative change in reaction time adaptation to
task condition, the number of hyperdirect pathway fibres
was correlated with the subthalamic stimulation related percent-
age decrease in reaction time adaptation to increased task
demand
in
the
controlled
condition
(�RToffcontrolled-
automatic� �RToncontrolled-automatic) / �RToffcontrolled-automatic. This
measure isolates the specific delay that is induced by the inversion
of pen-to-cursor mapping and is robust for the potential effects
of improvement in bradykinesia, which could confound a direct
comparison of reaction times in the controlled condition off and
on DBS. Patients who are able to move faster would have
quicker reaction times without a necessary effect of cognitive
demand. The relative change was chosen, because patients that
were more affected likely are slower to respond, yielding greater
absolute reaction time differences. These confounds were nullified
by isolating the condition-specific difference in reaction times and
quantifying the relative DBS induced change. We refer to this

 measure as the relative stimulation induced decrease in reaction
time adaptation.
To validate the reported correlation, we further created a
voxel-wise structural connectivity correlation map from volu-
metric fibre density images as previously described in Horn
et al. (2017c). Finally, to identify the most relevant fibres driv-
ing the correlation effect, we correlated each fibre density
voxel within the sensorimotor cortex mask with the stimula-
tion
induced
decrease
in

time
adaptation
(%�RTcontrolled-automatic). Significant (P 5 0.05) clusters of cor-
relation coefficients in the 3D map were then tested against
surrogate clusters derived from random permutation.
Design of the computational basal
ganglia model
The architecture of our computational model is shown in Fig. 5A.
The model comprises direct, indirect and hyperdirect basal ganglia
pathways, connecting SMA to motor cortices via the thalamus.
Direct pathway activation facilitates execution of specific motor
responses (Go function), while indirect pathway activation inhibits
response execution (NoGo function). Hyperdirect pathway activ-
ity globally inhibits responding to prevent execution of prepotent
responses in the case of response conflict. Next to these basal
ganglia pathways, the model contains a cortico-thalamic route
that bypasses the basal ganglia to allow for fast execution of
highly automatized responses (i.e. in our task, to move towards,
but not away from a suddenly appearing stimulus).
The model allows simulating presumed basal ganglia activity
in silico during patients’ execution of the sensorimotor task
outlined above. Input stimuli are fed into to the model’s sup-
plementary motor cortex. For matters of simplification, we
assume the input independent of the particular angle of pos-
ition in the circular arrangement leading us to only two input
locations. The model processes this information and may fi-
nally prompt its motor cortex to execute a response (i.e. to
move towards or away from the green/ red circle).
Each of the model’s structures (i.e. striatum, STN, external
and internal globus pallidus, thalamus and motor cortex) com-
prise two separate units (i.e. artificial neural ensembles) to
code for the two possible movement directions (i.e. towards
or away from the circle)—except for the supplementary motor
cortex, which comprises four individual units to code for four
different input stimuli (i.e. red versus green circles, which can
each be presented at two different locations).
Spread of
activity through the
model is visualized
in
Supplementary Video 1. In brief, presentation of green circles
activates both direct and indirect pathways, both of which are
directed onto the response towards the circle’s locations (hard-
coding; no plasticity involved). The balance of direct and in-
direct pathway activation determines how fast the model’s
movement towards the circle is executed. Under normal,
non-parkinsonian
conditions,
direct-pathway
activation
strongly outweighs indirect-pathway inhibition. As there is
no response conflict in trials with green circles, moreover,
the hyperdirect pathway is only slightly activated. The cor-
tico-thalamic pathway, finally, bypassing the basal ganglia,
provides additional facilitation of the movement towards the
circle’s location (i.e. of the automatized response).
Presentation of red circles similarly activates direct and in-
direct pathways. However, these are now targeted onto units
that encode movement away from the circle. Again, the path-
ways’ balance determines how fast the corresponding move-
ment is executed. Importantly, the cortico–thalamic pathway
(encoding automatized movements) now facilitates the compet-
ing response to move towards the stimulus (which is incorrect,
here), causing response conflict. To prevent prepotent incorrect
responses, hyperdirect pathway activation globally inhibits
responding.
Each of the model’s units is associated with a differential
equation (integrated via the Euler method) that determines
the unit’s membrane potential. In brief, membrane potentials
are determined by summing up baseline values, inputs and a
random noise term. Membrane potentials are converted into
firing rates via a sigmoid function. Detailed descriptions and
equations of all model structures are summarized in the
Supplementary material.
For fitting purposes, a separate network of our model was
run for each human participant that took part in the experi-
ment. Each parkinsonian (i.e. non-healthy) network was in-
formed by the relevant patient’s UPDRS score off stimulation
as an estimation of how strongly direct and indirect pathways
were affected by Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease was
implemented in the model by additively increasing the strength
of the indirect and decreasing the strength of the direct path-
way, thereby shifting the balance between speeding up and
slowing down movements towards the latter, as also motivated
by previous model simulation studies (Schroll et al., 2014;
Schroll and Hamker, 2016). The impact of DBS on the STN
was determined via two separate factors: first, the patient’s
empirically determined fibre count value (assumed to be a
good estimator of DBS effects on the hyperdirect pathway)
and secondly the difference between UPDRS values on and
off stimulation (as an estimator of DBS effects on the indirect
pathway).
Resulting reaction and movement times of our networks (ar-
bitrary units) were fitted to participants’ empirical results.
Fitting was achieved by searching for linear transformation
parameters (i.e. slope and intercept) that optimally trans-
formed the networks’ times into patients’ empirical data. To
prevent overfitting, only a single slope and intercept value were
fitted across trial types for each network.
The model’s resulting reaction and movement times were
analysed via the same statistical analyses as patients’ experi-
mental data.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean � SEM. All statistical analyses
were carried out in MATLAB. To avoid the violation of ne-
cessary assumptions, we conducted permutation statistics,
whenever possible. These are free from any assumptions
about the distributions of group values and are robust against
small sample size. Multiple comparisons were corrected by
controlling for the false discovery rate (Benjamini et al.,
2006) in the behavioural analyses for each measure tested or
correlated. As many of the behavioural measures are right
skewed, we report non-parametric rank-based Spearman’s cor-
relations, whenever possible. If data were normally distributed,
we additionally report Pearson’s linear correlations. To test for
the predictive value of the computational modelling results we
conducted linear regression analyses. Therefore, data were
transformed to a normal distribution with zero mean and

Results
Subthalamic stimulation elicits
different task-specific effects on
cognitive and motor aspects of
movement execution
Subthalamic DBS led to a significant improvement of motor
symptom severity as measured by the UPDRS-III (Fig. 1B;
off: 28.9 � 2.5, on: 11.2 � 1.2 points, mean � SEM re-
ported throughout manuscript; P 5 0.0001). Patients off
stimulation required more time to reach the target after
movement onset (from now on referred to as movement
time),
when
compared
to
healthy
controls
(Fig.
2A;
P 5 0.0001). This effect was higher in the controlled move-
ment
condition
with
inverted
pen-to-cursor
mapping
(�MTcontrolled-automatic P = 0.002). DBS decreased movement
times (P 5 0.0001 in both conditions), but movement time
was significantly more reduced in the controlled condition
(�MTcontrolled-automatic P 5 0.0001). Healthy participants in
contrast to patients with Parkinson’s disease showed a re-
duction of movement velocity in the controlled condition
(Fig. 2B; P 5 0.0001). STN stimulation increased movement
velocity, but did not improve movement velocity adaptation,
leading to less velocity decrease in the controlled condition,
when compared to healthy controls (�Vcontrolled-automatic
both off and on stimulation P 5 0.001, unpaired permuta-
tion tests). In line with this, larger trajectory errors (Fig. 2C;
defined as the average deviation of the movement trajectory
from a straight line connecting the start position with the
target) in the on stimulation condition were observed.
Importantly, trajectory error was calculated independent of
movement time, so that patients with Parkinson’s disease
who were moving slower could still achieve minimal trajec-
tory errors. Patients with Parkinson’s disease off stimulation
committed relatively higher movement trajectory errors in
the controlled movement condition, when compared to the
automatic
condition
(�ERRcontrolled-automatic
P = 0.02).
Subthalamic stimulation increased trajectory errors in both
conditions (P 5 0.001), but again changes were significantly
more marked in the controlled condition (�ERRcontrolled-
automatic
P 5 0.005).
Relative
movement
time
changes
[%MT(off-on)/off] correlated significantly with patients’ symp-
tom alleviation [%UPDRS-III(off-on)/off)] across conditions
(Spearman’s
rho = 0.51,

P = 0.03; both rank-based Spearman and linear Pearson cor-
relation coefficients are reported if data are normally distrib-
uted
as

stimulation conditions inversely correlated with movement
velocity averaged across movement conditions (Fig. 2E;
Spearman’s rho = � 0.55, P 5 0.001; Pearson’s R = � 0.51,
P 5 0.001)
and
relative
change
in
UPDRS-III
scores
[%UPDRS-III(off-on)/off)] correlated with relative change in
movement velocity (Fig. 2F). Pen-to-cursor mapping inver-
sion in the controlled condition led to longer reaction times,
indicating higher cognitive or inhibitory demand (Fig. 2D;
P 5 0.0001 for all participants). Patients with Parkinson’s
disease off stimulation reacted slower than healthy controls
in both conditions (P 5 0.05, unpaired permutation tests).
Subthalamic stimulation led to a significant decrease in re-
action times only in the controlled condition (P 5 0.001)
and to a significant decrease in reaction time adaptation defined
as �RTcontrolled-automatic compared to off stimulation (P = 0.004)
and healthy controls (P5 0.018). When trial conditions were
presented in random order (random block), reaction times were
significantly reduced by DBS in both conditions, suggesting a
general effect of DBS on reaction times under cognitive demand
(P5 0.05, paired permutation test).
Reaction time modulation is corre-
lated with the amount of cortico–
subthalamic fibres affected by sub-
thalamic stimulation
Average active contact location (Fig. 3A) was in remarkable

condition by 41.29 � 13.48% and this change correlated
with the relative and absolute amount of hyperdirect path-
way fibres (Fig. 3B and C) stimulated by the active DBS

P = 0.002/0.003;

ical motor DBS effect in UPDRS-III scores, levodopa

Moreover, direct comparison of the two subgroups of 10

dated that DBS lead to a significantly greater reaction
time change in the controlled condition, when compared
to the effect of levodopa (P = 0.02; unpaired permutation
test; Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, no significant cor-
relations were revealed for fibre counts with movement
times (P 4 0.1), UPDRS scores on stimulation (P 4 0.1)
or

turbed reaction time adaptation to task difficulty. Voxel-
wise Spearman correlations of fibre density with the
reaction time effect revealed a significant cluster in a

was visualized on the cortical surface (Fig. 3E; P 5 0.05,

 Computational basal ganglia model-
ling can predict the behavioural results
of DBS induced dynamic circuit
alterations in patients with Parkinson’s
disease
To test our hypotheses of differential indirect and hyperdir-
ect pathway alterations through subthalamic DBS a com-
putational model of the cortex–basal ganglia–thalamic
circuit (adapted from Schroll et al., 2014) was designed
to simulate task-related basal ganglia activity in silico
(Fig. 4). Model reaction times and movement times were
determined by activity thresholds of the model’s motor
neurons depending on upstream computations of direct,
indirect and hyperdirect basal ganglia pathways (Fig. 5A).
To simulate the effects of Parkinson’s disease, loss of dopa-
mine was assumed to strengthen the indirect and weaken
the direct pathway. Our model could correctly predict the
reaction
(Pearson’s
R = 0.96,
P 5 0.0001;
Spearman’s
rho = 0.94, P 5 0.0001) and movement times (Pearson’s
R = 0.98, P 5 0.0001; Spearman’s rho = 0.97, P 5 0.0001)
in patients with Parkinson’s disease off stimulation and
healthy controls (Pearson’s R = 0.82/0.46, P 5 0.001/0.02
and Spearman’s rho = 0.89/0.51, P 5 0.0001/0.01 for reac-
tion/movement times, respectively). Next, pathway lesions
were introduced to the computational basal ganglia loop to
test the contributions of both the indirect and hyperdirect
pathway to the DBS-related reaction time and movement
time effects. The hyperdirect pathway lesion was modelled
as a disruption of monosynaptic cortico-subthalamic signal-
ling, whereas the indirect pathway lesion was introduced by
disruption of cortical input to striatal D2 neurons with a
consecutive increase in external globus pallidus activity and
a subsequent increase in STN inhibition. Note, that this is a
practical implementation of the finding that DBS induced
motor sign alleviation are best explained by suppression of
indirect pathway activity (Kahan et al., 2014), which is
further supported by the finding that parkinsonian symp-
tom alleviation is correlated with local modulation of os-
cillatory activity, but not reduction in cortico-subthalamic
connectivity (Oswal et al., 2016). Stepwise regression
model selection was conducted to find the lesion that best
predicted the patients’ behaviour on STN-DBS. In line with
the fibre tracking results, the hyperdirect pathway lesion
best predicted the patients on stimulation reaction time

indirect pathway lesion data removed by stepwise model
selection, hypothetical estimated coefficient: �1.1) in the
stepwise model selection. For movement times, the indirect
pathway lesion data best explained the patients on stimulation
results (estimated coefficient: 0.7 R2 = 0.49, P 5 0.001,
hyperdirect pathway lesion data removed by stepwise
model selection, hypothetical estimated coefficient: �1.9).
Figure 5 The computational basal ganglia model can predict task effects. The model architecture comprises a simplified version of the
cortex–basal ganglia–thalamic loop (A). The model’s SMA comprises four distinct neurons, each encoding a combination of stimulus type (red
versus green circle) with spatial location (i.e. the location at which circles were shown with respect to the fixation cross in the unit; in our
simulations we generalize across the exact circular angle providing only two options). The subsequent structures integrate the condition-specific
activity in two cells (the striatum has two cells in each of the D1 and the D2 compartments), encoding the two spatial locations to which motor
responses can be directed. The respective model computations result in different levels of motor cortex output that is directly translated into
cursor movement. Lesions (B) of the hyperdirect pathway best predicted the reaction times during DBS (left; only results from leave one out
cross-validation are shown throughout all panels), while lesions of the indirect pathway best predicted movement times (right). Overall, relevant
original behavioural results (C) could be replicated by our models (shaded box and whisker; error bars depict SEM) for both reaction times (left)
and movement times (right). All predictions were robust after leave-one-out cross validation, through which performance time (reaction
time + movement time) of left out participants could be significantly predicted from the model of the remaining participants (D) for patients off
(left) and on subthalamic DBS (middle) and healthy controls. D1 = striatal dopamine receptor 1 positive medium spiny neuron; D2 = striatal
dopamine receptor 2 positive medium spiny neuron; GPi = internal pallidum.

 Again, leave one out cross-validation was used to validate the
predictive power of the linear regression model for the hyper-
direct pathway lesion for reaction times (Fig. 5B; Pearson’s
R = 0.79, P 5 0.0001; Spearman’s rho = 0.87, P 5 0.0001)
and indirect pathway lesion for movement times (Pearson’s
R = 0.62,
P = 0.001;
Spearman’s
rho = 0.70
P 5 0.001).
Finally, to integrate all the reported findings of hyperdirect
and indirect pathway modulations through subthalamic
stimulation, we simulated subthalamic high frequency DBS
in our model as a decrease of firing rate modulation of the
STN leading to disruption of pallidal outflow from cortical
hyperdirect
and
striatal
indirect
pathway
activity,
thus
mimicking a depolarization block, which is a practical but
likely
simplistic
account
of
the
underlying
therapeutic
mechanism (Florence et al., 2016). For our DBS simulation
in the basal ganglia networks, the disruption of hyperdirect
pathway signalling was dissociated from the disruption of
indirect pathway input by weighting the hyperdirect pathway
modulation by the amount of hyperdirect fibres stimulated in
each case, whereas the indirect pathway modulation was
weighted by the relative improvement in UPDRS-III scores.
To investigate the predictive performance of our DBS model
in comparison to hyperdirect and indirect pathway lesions,
we included the DBS modelling results to the stepwise regres-
sion. Our combined hyperdirect and indirect pathway lesion
(DBS) model outperformed the single pathway lesion models
leading to improved estimations for both reaction (estimated
coefficient: 0.84, R2 = 0.71, P 5 0.0001) and movement
times (estimated coefficient: 0.76, R2 = 0.57, P = 0.0001)
and mildly improved leave one out cross-validation results
(Pearson’s
R = 0.79/0.69
P 5 0.001/0.001;
Spearman’s
rho = 0.87/0.73
P 5 0.001/0.001
for
reaction/movement
times, respectively) highlighting the interference of STN
DBS with these pathways. Finally, we visualized the predict-
ive power by running leave one out validation on the per-
formance times (reaction + movement times) in patients off
and on DBS and healthy controls. Reaction times, movement
times and performance times are visualized separately in box
and whisker plots and compared using permutation tests as
mentioned above (Fig. 5C). After confirming the significance
in normalized data, we reran the last analyses to estimate the
true error in milliseconds to present meaningful values for the
predicted times without prior transformation to a normal
distribution (Fig. 5D). Average root mean squared errors
were 40.6/45.7/40.8 ms (Parkinson’s disease off/Parkinson’s
disease on/healthy controls, respectively) for reaction times,
309.0/240.7/153.2ms

for

times, and 569.18/221.27/172.9ms (Parkinson’s disease off/
Parkinson’s disease on/healthy controls, respectively) for per-
formance times.
Discussion
We have shown that subthalamic DBS has differential
effects
on
movement
preparation
and
execution
that
could be explained by hyperdirect and indirect pathway
functionality, respectively. First, behavioural results show
that subthalamic DBS reduces the adaptation of reaction
times to task demands, leading to faster but more errone-
ous movements. This was independent of the clinical motor
sign improvement that was significantly correlated with
modulation of movement velocity and movement time.
Second, hyperdirect pathway fibre stimulation specifically
decreased
reaction
times
under
cognitive
inhibitory
demand leading to faster reaction times, despite increased
task difficulty. Finally, a computational model was able to
explain both changes in reaction and movement times by
means of hyperdirect and indirect pathway functionality.
This suggests that DBS in Parkinson’s disease modulates
cognitive aspects of motor preparation through the hyper-
direct pathway, in parallel with movement kinematics
through the indirect pathway. Patients off DBS showed
marked deterioration in task performance that was more
pronounced in the condition that required cautious inhibi-
tory motor control. DBS interfered with both cognitive and
motor processing in the task and our findings integrate
with previous reports regarding cognitive and clinical im-
plications of distinct pathway effects in Parkinson’s disease.
Before we move on with a detailed discussion of our
findings on pathway-specific effects we should bear in
mind that the present study was not intended or designed
to identify the cellular mechanism of action of DBS. Hence,
we will not claim that clinical efficacy does not depend at
least in part of orthodromic or antidromic activation of
white matter tracts, which is supported by several well con-
ducted studies (Gradinaru et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012;
Sanders and Jaeger, 2016). Fibre activation may be one
of the underlying mechanisms of DBS that could result in
local and distant network effects on subcortical and cortical
levels, but the exact fibres implicated remain unknown.
Importantly, this does not contradict a net suppression of
subthalamic firing during DBS, which was recently demon-
strated in patients with Parkinson’s disease (Milosevic
et al., 2018) and could underlie the information block as
modelled in the present study. Moreover, not only changes
in firing rate but also temporal patterning of spike firing in
the beta frequency range that has been shown to underlie
the local representation of oscillatory beta activity (Ku
¨hn
et al., 2005) is considered an important factor in the patho-
physiology of Parkinson’s disease (Neumann et al., 2016a,
2017; Geng et al., 2017; Steiner et al., 2017; Tinkhauser
et al., 2017). Our model does not incorporate beta oscilla-
tions as this would add significantly to the model complex-
ity with many assumptions that remain to be established.
However, we would like to point out that subthalamic beta
oscillations have shown to parallel an increase in firing
rates associated with the hypodopaminergic state in the
MPTP-treated monkey, while pharmacological lesioning
of the STN was shown to reduce both, STN firing rates
and beta activity (Tachibana et al., 2011). Indeed, suppres-
sion of beta activity through DBS (Ku
¨hn et al., 2008;
Neumann et al., 2016b) was recently proposed to rely on

 synaptic silencing, leading to reduced subthalamic firing
rates (Milosevic et al., 2018). Thus, the implemented rate
changes can be interpreted as the foundation for more
complex basal ganglia models including temporal pattern-
ing in the beta range (Pavlides et al., 2015) that should be
integrated in future studies but can be interpreted as com-
plimentary mechanisms that do not contradict each other.
The following discussion will aim to explain the functional
consequences of subthalamic DBS in relation to previous
findings on the cortex–basal ganglia–thalamic loop.
The role of the hyperdirect pathway has best been stu-
died in the cognitive domain where the STN is proposed to
elevate decision thresholds under conflict to optimize be-
havioural outcome (Frank et al., 2007; Green et al.,
2013) potentially through communication in low frequency
oscillations (Cavanagh et al., 2011; Herz et al., 2016).
Subthalamic DBS interferes with this function leading to
impulsive and consequently suboptimal choices or increased
error rates. Our study extends these findings to the (pre)-
motor domain, as patients in our task were preparing for a
complex movement rather than indicating binary choices
with a single button press. While reaction times were sig-
nificantly slower when DBS was turned off, the adaptation
of reaction times to the more difficult task condition was
not significantly different to that of healthy controls—indi-
cating a normal but shifted reaction time adaptation in
Parkinson’s disease. DBS specifically reduced the reaction
time adaptation, i.e. reduced the reaction time relatively
more in the controlled as opposed to automated motor
task. This DBS effect increased with proximity of the
active contact to cortico-subthalamic fibres connecting the
medial frontal cortex or SMA with the STN that are part of
a postulated inhibition triangle (Aron et al., 2007). The
STN and SMA have previously been implicated in switch-
ing from automatic to controlled behaviour in a similar
experiment on saccades and antisaccades in trained ma-
caques (Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007, 2008, 2011). Neurons
in the medial frontal cortex were reported to be active
during switching from automatic saccades to controlled
antisaccades and stimulation of SMA replaced automatic
incorrect responses with slower correct responses (Isoda
and Hikosaka, 2007). In the STN, specific neurons were
identified that are activated during the preparation of con-
trolled antisaccades, potentially reflecting a suppression of
the automatic response (Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008). This
observation in combination with the fact that suppression
of hyperdirect pathway activity to the STN in the model
best predicted reaction times of our patients on DBS sup-
ports the hypothesis that decreased reaction time adapta-
tion through stimulation may be mediated by interfering
with hyperdirect pathway communication to the STN.
Neither
the
reported
reaction
time
effects,
nor
the
amount of SMA–subthalamic fibres in relation to all
fibres in proximity to active DBS contacts showed a signifi-
cant association with clinical motor sign alleviation, which
was in contrast correlated with movement time and vel-
ocity. This point is crucial, since it differentiates the
hyperdirect mediated effect from general symptom im-
provements and demonstrates that the pathway is likely
responsible for a specific behavioural phenomenon that
does not share significant variance with pure motor im-
provement as measured by UPDRS. Increased movement
velocity and decreased movement times in the DBS on
condition may thus reflect a modulation of subcortical
neurotransmission to the STN that to a certain degree is
independent from monosynaptic cortical input. Indeed, cor-
tico–subthalamic hyperdirect pathway input has recently
been reported to decrease in the parkinsonian state due
to
increased
striatopallidal
transmission
(Chu
et
al.,
2017). The computational model demonstrated best predic-
tions on movement times on DBS through a suppression of
the indirect pathway in our patients. In this regard, opto-
genetic manipulation of basal ganglia circuitry reported
optogenetic excitation of indirect pathway MSNs to be suf-
ficient to elicit parkinsonian symptoms in healthy rodents,
whereas direct pathway activation could alleviate motor
symptoms
in
a
mouse
model
of
Parkinson’s
disease
(Kravitz et al., 2010). In fact, cell-specific excitation of
Parvalbumin positive neurons in the external pallidum
alone was shown to produce marked movement restoration
in parallel with attenuation of pathological activity in basal
ganglia output nuclei in dopamine depleted mice (Mastro
et al., 2017).
Furthermore, investigation of pathway-specific DBS effects
in patients with Parkinson’s disease through dynamic causal
modelling in resting state functional MRI has proposed that
the clinical state was best explained by increased indirect
pathway activity and that DBS-related symptom alleviation
correlated with a reduction of the latter (Kahan et al., 2014).
Furthermore, observations on cortico–subcortical oscillatory
circuit dynamics through parallel subthalamic local field po-
tential and whole head magnetoencephalography suggest
that suppression of subthalamic low beta activity correlates
with DBS related motor improvement, but not modulation
of cortico–subthalamic high beta connectivity, which was
proposed to reflect hyperdirect pathway coupling in analyses
of conduction delays (Oswal et al., 2016). In the present
study, patients with Parkinson’s disease were more impaired
in the controlled condition of our task requiring increased
motor control. This effect may be related to the role of the
basal ganglia in motor skill acquisition and procedural learn-
ing (Jog et al., 1999), where well-trained actions may
become less dopamine dependent and therefore less affected
in the parkinsonian state (Choi et al., 2005). In contrast,
dopamine seems critical for the formation of habit and auto-
maticity (Graybiel, 2008). Importantly, DBS did not improve
movement velocity adaptation via slowing of movement to
cope with increased task difficulty in the controlled condi-
tion, which in fact may reflect the loss of an important
physiological function of the basal ganglia not restored
through continuous DBS. Remarkably, optogenetic manipu-
lations of indirect pathway neurons were sufficient to de-
crease
and
increase
movement
velocity
during
task
performance in healthy mice (Yttri and Dudman, 2016). In

 this regard, subthalamic oscillatory activity was recently
demonstrated to encode movement velocity in dependence
of dopamine in human patients with Parkinson’s disease,
providing a link between kinematic motor control and symp-
toms of bradykinesia in the hypodopaminergic state (Lofredi
et al., 2018).
It is likely that DBS effects are transmitted not by a single
mechanism of action but multiple interactions from molecu-
lar and cellular processes translating into global network
effects that also span different time scales. Here, potentially
complementary mechanisms to the depolarization block, im-
plemented in our computational model, have been proposed,
such as regularization of aberrant activity, modulation of
extracellular ions and neurotransmitters and axonal activa-
tion (Florence et al., 2016; Wichmann and DeLong, 2016).
Each proposed mechanism would likely yield complex inter-
actions
with
both
hyperdirect
and
indirect
pathways.
Cognitive and motor effects of DBS may result from modu-
lation of converging neural pathways in the STN and are
impossible to disentangle with certainty. Similarly, the classic
rate model does not account for all observed behavioural
effects through optogenetic stimulation, as the indirect path-
way and direct pathway have both been shown to be
involved in action initiation and execution (Cui et al.,
2013; Tecuapetla et al., 2016). Notwithstanding this, our
study aims at providing a framework to explain pathway-
linked DBS effects that may guide innovation to improve
therapeutic success in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
Adaptive closed loop DBS approaches are now in develop-
ment in the hope to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce
adverse effects and first studies have shown promising results
(Little et al., 2013) using subthalamic beta synchronization
that can reflect parkinsonian symptom severity in the STN
(Ku
¨hn et al., 2006; Neumann et al., 2016a, 2017) or poten-
tially cortical phase amplitude coupling (de Hemptinne et al.,
2013, 2015; Swann et al., 2015, 2018) to trigger stimula-
tion. Based on our findings, we propose that innovative
therapeutic neuromodulation approaches should aim to
adapt stimulation not only to symptom severity, but also
to physiological signals reflecting inhibitory cognitive and
motor demand to re-enable flexible motor control. We pro-
pose that computational basal ganglia models could serve as
neural prosthetics to control subthalamic inhibitory output
based on complex input signals derived from cortical, sub-
cortical and peripheral sensors. Crucially, the model devised
in the present manuscript only requires clinically abundant
parameters (UPDRS-III in off state, pre- and postoperative
imaging) to make predictions about behavioural DBS effects
that go above and beyond pure motor sign improvements
and may be able to further fine-tune optimal stimulation
parameters in DBS programming in the future.
