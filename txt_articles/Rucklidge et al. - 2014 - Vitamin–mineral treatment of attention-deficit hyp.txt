 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the
most common psychiatric disorders characterised by impairments
in inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity1 and the prevalence
in adults has been estimated between 4 and 5%.2 Poor long-term
outcomes of children followed to adulthood have been documented
in both treated and untreated samples.3,4 Response to medications
is lower in adults with ADHD compared with those in children,
and comorbid conditions alongside ADHD in adults appear to
lower the response further.5 Concerns over adverse effects of
medications, limited accessibility to psychotherapy, reduced
responses because of comorbidities and disappointing long-term
outcomes have resulted in many individuals with ADHD seeking
alternative treatments.6,7 Notwithstanding some negative studies
in the 1970s and 1980s,8,9 there has been a recent resurgence in
interest regarding the effects of diet and nutrient interventions
on ADHD symptoms.10 Topics investigated include the impact
of processed foods,11 elimination diets,12 food dyes,13 essential
fatty acids14 and early malnutrition.15 Despite this growing
interest, the number of robust randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) testing nutrient interventions is few in comparison with
the numerous studies of psychopharmacological treatments.16
There is an expanding evidence base concerning the role of
micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) in the pathophysiology
and management of psychiatric symptoms including mood,
stress and autism.17–19 Proposed mechanisms by which micro-
nutrients could be beneficial for mental illness include functioning
as cofactors for various metabolic pathways in the brain,20 correcting
inborn errors of metabolism,21 improving mitochondrial function
and membrane functioning,22 and promoting healthy gastro-
intestinal functioning and improved absorption of nutrients.23
All these proposed mechanisms support a broad-based nutrient
approach rather than an individual nutrient (for example zinc,
iron), the more typical method studied in the treatment of
ADHD24–26 but an approach that has yielded modest and often
inconsistent findings.16 Only one masked RCT has assessed the
effects of broad-spectrum nutrients in ADHD.27 Children taking
an herbal supplement for 4 months showed greater improvements
on the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), but the doses and
type of individual nutrients were not quantified. Other studies
assessing micronutrient combinations for the treatment of ADHD
have reported positive benefits but have been open-label,28–30
retrospective database analyses,31 case reports32 or patient-preference
studies.33 This paper presents the first double-blind, parallel-group
RCT designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a broad-spectrum
micronutrient formula, EMPowerplus, compared with placebo in
medication-free adults with ADHD. This micronutrient formula
has been examined in over 20 published studies for treating
various mental conditions, has documented evidence of both
short- and long-term safety data34 and has been more extensively
examined in psychiatric conditions than any other multivitamin/
multimineral formula;35 however, as of yet, no masked trials have
been conducted on it. Efficacy measures included standardised
self-report, observer-rated and clinician-rated scales capturing
attention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, mood, quality of life and
overall psychiatric functioning.
Method
Participants and entry criteria
Participants were recruited in Canterbury, New Zealand, from
May 2009 to May 2012 via referrals from public services, private
clinicians, and self-referrals based on advertisements. From 136
referrals, 80 adults (age 516 years) with ADHD were assigned
in a 1:1 ratio to 8 weeks of treatment with either micronutrients
or placebo (Fig. 1). Of the final sample, 44 (55%) were self-
referred and the remainder were referred by mental health
professionals in the community (with no group differences

Vitamin–mineral treatment of attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder in adults: double-blind
randomised placebo-controlled trial
Julia J. Rucklidge, Chris M. Frampton, Brigette Gorman and Anna Boggis
Background
The role of nutrition in the treatment of attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is gaining international attention;
however, treatments have generally focused only on diet
restriction or supplementing with one nutrient at a time.
Aims
To investigate the efficacy and safety of a broad-based
micronutrient formula consisting mainly of vitamins and
minerals, without omega fatty acids, in the treatment of
ADHD in adults.
Method
This double-blind randomised controlled trial assigned
80 adults with ADHD in a 1:1 ratio to either micronutrients
(n = 42) or placebo (n = 38) for 8 weeks (trial registered
with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry:
ACTRN12609000308291).
Results
Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant between-group
differences favouring active treatment on self- and
observer- but not clinician-ADHD rating scales. However,
clinicians rated those receiving micronutrients as more
improved than those on placebo both globally and on
ADHD symptoms. Post hoc analyses showed that for those
with moderate/severe depression at baseline, there was a
greater change in mood favouring active treatment over
placebo. There were no group differences in adverse events.
Conclusions
This study provides preliminary evidence of efficacy for
micronutrients in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in adults,
with a reassuring safety profile.

 observed between the two groups). The study was approved by
both the National Upper South A Health and Disability Ethics
Committee and the Human Ethics Committee at the University
of Canterbury. After a complete description of the experimental
nature of the trial as well as a review of conventional treatments
available, written informed consent was obtained from all
participants. The trial was prospectively registered (Australian
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12609000308291).
Only individuals not taking psychiatric medications were
considered (that is, who were medication-free for at least 4 weeks).
Participants were allowed to continue psychological therapies
(n = 3) and supplements such as essential fatty acids if dose and
intensity did not change throughout the duration of the study
(n = 0). Participants with any of the following were excluded: (a)
neurological disorder involving brain or other central nervous
system function (such as epilepsy); (b) pregnant or breastfeeding;
(c) evidence of untreated or unstable thyroid disease; (d) any
known abnormality of mineral metabolism (such as Wilson’s
disease, haemochromatosis); (e) abnormal baseline biochemistry
or haematology laboratory values as assessed by the study
physician (A.B.); or (f) judged clinically to be at serious risk of
suicide or violence. These criteria resulted in three participants
being excluded, all due to abnormal blood work at baseline.
Medications for physical conditions were considered individually
but generally were allowed; two were taking birth control pills,
one was taking thyroxine and one was taking a statin.
Participants had to meet criteria for ADHD based on the Conners
Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID)36 or,
for those under 18 years (n = 7), the Schedule for Affective
Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children – Present
and
Lifetime
version
(Kiddie-SADS-PL).37
Information
on
historical symptoms was obtained for all participants either
directly from the participants if possible or from reviewing past
report cards or psychological assessments (if available) or inter-
viewing family members for supporting information. In addition,
participants had to have an elevated level (T-score 465) on one or
more of the three DSM-IV subscales of the Conners Adult ADHD
Rating Scales (CAARS)38 on either the self or the observer ver-
sions. For participants under 18 years, the Conners Rating Scales
for youth and parents were completed.39 Thirty-four (42.5%) of
the participants had already received a diagnosis of ADHD from
other mental health professionals.
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I
Disorders (SCID-I)40 was also administered to assess co-occurring
disorders and to determine whether another psychiatric disorder
could better account for the ADHD symptoms. We purposefully
included participants with other Axis I disorders, acknowledging
the limitations but also appreciating that the clinical utility of
the results would be more meaningful if the sample was
representative
of
individuals
affected
by
ADHD.
Clinical
interviews were conducted by clinical psychologists or senior
clinical psychology graduate students. All the participants were
discussed by a team with a senior clinician; 10% of interviews were
independently rated, with 100% agreement in diagnosis.
Efficacy and safety assessments
All participants were monitored by a clinical psychologist or
senior clinical psychology graduate student under a psychologist’s
supervision with face-to-face meetings or telephone contact at the
screening visit, baseline, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 (or end of
study). At each post-screening visit, the following measures were
completed: (a) the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement
(CGI-I) Scale,41 producing two scores: CGI-I-ADHD (reflecting
change in ADHD symptoms) and CGI-I – Overall Impression
(capturing
global
change
in
functioning
from
baseline,
acknowledging that individuals with ADHD typically present
with many psychiatric symptoms beyond ADHD); (b) the
Montgomery–A
˚ sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS),42 a
10-item scale administered by a trained clinician who assigns
a severity rating for each symptom of depression based on a
personal interview. Interrater reliability on a subset of these

interviews (intraclass correlation coefficient) was estimated at
0.98; and (c) the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF),1 a
numeric scale (1 through 100) used by mental health clinicians
to rate the general functioning of adults.
At baseline and at 8 weeks, the clinician also completed:
(a) the CAARS – Observer: Screening Version (CAARS-O:SV)43
based on the clinician’s impression of functioning on the
items over the previous 8 weeks. This scale provides four
subscales including DSM-IV inattention, DSM-IV hyper-
activity/impulsivity and DSM-IV ADHD symptoms total. All
raw scores are converted to T-scores based on age and
gender. The use of T-scores makes interpretations of change
more clinically relevant.
(b) The Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation – Range
Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT),44 which explores
psychosocial functioning over the previous week in four
domains: work, interpersonal relations, recreation and global
satisfaction. It also evaluates how impairing the psychiatric
symptoms are across these domains.
At baseline and 8 weeks (or end of study visit), each parti-
cipant
completed
the
CAARS-Self-Report:
Long
version
(CAARS-S:L),43 which includes three DSM-IV subscales for
inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity and combined inattention
and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Finally, participants asked someone
they knew well, typically a spouse, friend or a parent, to act as an
observer and complete a CAARS – Observer Scale: Long Version
(CAARS-O:L).43 Twenty (25%) of our participants did not have
anyone close to them who could complete the scale.
Other areas assessed included participant’s expectancy of
benefit measured by asking how much the participant expected
to improve from 0 (‘not at all’) to 3 (‘very much’), a brief diet
intake questionnaire (modified from Baker et al45 to assess dietary
patterns including consumption of fruit and vegetables, breakfast,
consumption of fast foods and eating when full), fortnightly
consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine and illicit drugs, and
therapeutic alliance assessed by participants at the end of the
RCT phase using a modified version of the Helping Alliance
Questionnaire (HAQ),46 which consisted of five items assessing
the therapeutic relationship developed between the participant
and the clinician monitoring them.
Treatment response was defined a priori in two ways: (a)
530% decrease, which is a standard percentage change in ADHD
ratings used in the ADHD literature,47 on any of the self-report
CAARS DSM-IV subscales; and (b) a final CGI-I – Overall
Impression of either ‘much’ or ‘very much’ improved in order
to assess improvement globally across all areas of functioning.
Procedures
At baseline and trial completion, there were laboratory tests for
thyroid function, serum lipids, prolactin, fasting glucose, blood
clotting, iron, zinc, vitamin D, vitamin B12 and copper levels,
urinalysis and urine drug screen. Participants were randomly
assigned to treatment using a computer-generated randomisation
sequence.
Medication
kits
containing
all
required
study
medication for the 8-week intervention were prepared by the
pharmacist in advance. Only the pharmacist had access to the
randomisation list until all study data had been adjudicated and
the study database was completed and locked. This process
ensured participants, investigators and clinicians were unaware
of the participant’s treatment allocation.
Once eligibility was confirmed and baseline assessment
completed, participants were allocated to the next sequentially
numbered kit. Participants titrated up their dose over a week to
15 capsules per day, in three doses of 5 capsules, taken with food
and water. The micronutrient formula and placebo (see online
Tables DS1 and DS2 for ingredients) were identical in appearance.
The placebo included a small amount of riboflavin to mimic the
smell and urine colour associated with taking vitamins. Unused
pills were collected at each assessment to obtain an estimate of
adherence. At each visit, participants received a NZ$10 petrol
voucher to cover travel costs. No other compensation was
provided. Participants were offered daily text messages to remind
them to take their pills (36 (45%) participants opted for these).
Procedures deviated slightly during the Christchurch earthquakes
(4 September 2010 and February 22 2011) for 11 (14%)
participants, whose pills were delivered in person or mailed and
followed with telephone interviews.
Sample size
An open-label single-arm pilot study using the micronutrient
formula provided the basis for the sample size estimation.30 Based
on within-group effect sizes from this pilot study ranging between
0.90 and 1.70, a sample size of 36 participants per group was
required to detect statistically significant (2-tailed a = 0.05)
between-group effect sizes of 0.67 or greater with 80% power.
These effect sizes approximate minimum clinically significant
differences for the primary outcome measures. To allow for an
anticipated 10% attrition rate, 80 participants were recruited.
Statistical analyses
The three primary outcome measures defined a priori and
reflecting the broad spectrum of ADHD symptoms were the
CAARS (self, observer and clinician DSM scales), CGI and
MADRS. The changes from baseline to the end of treatment were
compared between randomised groups using a repeated-measures
ANCOVA, with the baseline level as the covariate. Change
measures (CGI-I ratings) assessed at the end of treatment were
compared using one-way ANOVA. The treatment effects were
summarised by mean differences and 95% confidence intervals
generated
from
the
ANCOVA/ANOVA
models.
Categorical
outcomes were compared between groups using chi-squared tests
with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. Adverse
event rates were compared between treatment groups using
Fisher’s
exact
tests.
All
analyses
were
undertaken
on
an
intention-to-treat
(ITT)
basis.
For
those
participants
not
completing the trial, data from their final assessment were used
(which may have been baseline). Secondary analyses were
undertaken on all outcomes using the per-protocol analysis set.
All tests were two-tailed, and P-values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
In total, 80 participants gave informed consent and were
randomised, 42 to the micronutrient group and 38 to placebo
group. Apart from a significant imbalance in gender ratio
(w2(1, n= 80) = 7.6,
P= 0.006)
and
current
anxiety
disorder
(w2(1, n= 80) = 4.5, P= 0.03), the two groups were well matched
(Table 1). Just over half the sample had a history of taking
psychiatric medications, of which 13 (16.3%) had only been
prescribed a stimulant, 8 (10%) had been prescribed a stimulant
and another psychiatric medication (such as antidepressant,
anxiolytic), and 20 (25%) had been prescribed a psychiatric
medication other than a stimulant. Fourteen (17.5%) of the
participants had received a medication as a child (under 16). Four
participants in the micronutrient group did not complete the
study; one developed sarcoidosis at week 4 and withdrew, and
308
 Micronutrient treatment and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
the remaining three withdrew at weeks 2, 4 and 6. Two partici-
pants in the placebo group did not complete the study; both with-
drew at week 2 (Fig. 1). The participant masking was successful,
with no group differences in what participants thought they were
receiving. More participants believed they were taking placebo
(64.3% in the micronutrient group, 65.8% in the placebo group).
Primary efficacy outcomes
Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant group differences
favouring micronutrient treatment on the self and observer
CAARS DSM ADHD symptoms total subscales, but not on the
clinician CAARS ratings (Fig. 2). However, based on CGI-I ADHD
(Fig. 3) and CGI-I – Overall Impression, clinicians rated ADHD
symptoms and global change as more improved in participants
taking the micronutrient formula compared with the placebo.
There were no group differences in MADRS scores (Table 2).
Differences observed between the groups were not altered when
gender and presence of an anxiety disorder were included as
covariates. Effect sizes of significant differences fell within the
medium to large range (0.46 to 0.67).
Other treatment-related outcomes
Consistent with these findings on ADHD Total Symptom scores,
intent-to-treat analyses revealed significant group differences
separately for both attention (based only on self-report) and
hyperactivity/impulsivity (based on both self- and observer report
but only a trend based on clinician ratings). The micronutrient
group also showed greater overall improvement based on the
GAF score, but not on the LIFE-RIFT (Table 2). In the per-protocol
analyses, excluding participants who withdrew before 8 weeks

(n = 6), the statistical interpretations did not change for any
outcome. A further exploration of the MADRS scores revealed a
significant difference favouring the micronutrient group when a
subsample of those with moderate or severe depression at baseline
(MADRS score 520)51 was examined (micronutrient group:
n = 11, D= 9.5 s.e.= 2.7; placebo group: n = 10, D= 5.1 s.e.= 2.0,
P = 0.039, effect size (ES) = 0.64; Fig. 4).
Treatment response
At end-point, 27 (64.3%) of those in the micronutrient group v.
14 (36.8%) in the placebo group showed a 530% drop from
baseline (w2(1, n= 80) = 6.014, P= 0.014) on at least one subscale
of the CAARS (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.2–7.7). Further, 20 (47.6%) of
those in the micronutrient group v. 8 (21.1%) in the placebo
group (w2(1, n = 80) = 6.189, P50.013) were ‘much’ to ‘very
much’ improved on the CGI-I – Overall Impression (OR = 3.4,
95% CI 1.3–9.2).
Safety and adherence
The rates of the most common adverse events did not differ
between the micronutrient and placebo groups (Table 3).
Prolactin levels were trending higher in the micronutrient
group (P = 0.006), rising from a mean of 191 to 222, but still
within the normal clinical range of 50–350 mIU/l (females) and
50–550 mIU/l (males). No other group differences were found in
the chemistry and haematology safety screens (Table 4), and no
individual’s changes in these measures were considered clinically
significant.
The overall adherence rate (that is taking all required doses)
was 94.6% (s.d.= 6.9) for the micronutrient group and 95.8%
(s.d.= 10.1) for the placebo group based on self-report and
96.4% (s.d.= 8.9) for the micronutrient group and 92.1%
(s.d.= 18.6) for the placebo group based on pill counts. Nutrient
assays showed significant group differences in the changes for
vitamin D (P = 0.002), B12 (P50.001) and folate (P50.001) levels
in those taking the micronutrient formula having higher levels at
study end (Table 4). Only B12 levels increased beyond the reference
range in the micronutrient group.
Other variables
There were no group differences in alcohol misusers (n = 7
(16.7%) micronutrient group, n= 5 (13.2%) placebo group),
cannabis users (n = 6 (14.3%) micronutrient group, n = 3 (7.9%)
placebo group), rates of smokers (n = 9 (21.4%) micronutrient
group, n= 4 (10.5%) placebo group), diet and participant-assessed
therapeutic alliance and expectancies between the two groups.
Discussion
This study is the first double-blind RCT to investigate the efficacy
and safety of a broad-based vitamin/mineral formula in the treat-
ment of ADHD in adults. We demonstrated that micronutrient
treatment induced statistically robust improvements in several
indices, from ADHD symptoms to global assessment of functioning,
compared with placebo, with effect sizes ranging from 0.46 to 0.67.
Specifically, participants taking the micronutrient formula reported
greater improvement in both inattention and hyperactivity/
impulsivity compared with those taking a placebo. Improvement
in hyperactivity/impulsivity was also noted by the observers.

 Micronutrient treatment and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
Clinicians did not observe group differences on the ADHD rating
scales or the LIFE-RIFT scale, but reported greater global
functioning improvements based on the GAF, CGI-I-ADHD and
CGI-I – Overall Impression.
The varied findings across reporters on attention highlight the
difficulties in reliably measuring attention, which is generally
more difficult to observe than behavioural changes. Further,
elsewhere we have documented that it may take more than 8 weeks
for attention scores to drop into the non-clinical range when it
might have been more noticeable to others.30 Although there
was a significant group difference on self-report of attention, the
fact that the scores in the micronutrient group remained elevated
questions the clinical significance of the findings. In contrast to
inattention, based on an average across raters, hyperactivity/
impulsivity scores were reduced into the normal non-clinical
range with micronutrient administration but not placebo. The
lack of a group difference in clinician ratings on hyperactivity/
impulsivity was in contrast to self and observer ratings of change;
this difference may in part reflect low power to detect a more
modest effect size (0.40). Further, clinicians have less data
available to them to make ratings given the relative lack of time
spent with the individual (an hour every 2 weeks), perhaps
resulting in more conservative estimates of change. Although
clinicians are often viewed as having the greatest objectivity and
therefore their ratings are often perceived as more reliable and
valuable than self- and observer reports, it is only the participant
and/or observer who are experiencing and observing the symptoms
on a daily basis. Further, a recent meta-analysis challenged the
view that self-ratings are not as useful as physician ratings in
ADHD research, finding that self-ratings were more consistent

across studies than observer ratings and therefore, we should not
be over-reliant on observer ratings to assess change associated with
ADHD treatments.52
The improvements in global measures of functioning suggest
that, whereas ADHD symptoms persist to some degree, micro-
nutrient treatment appears to benefit a variety of areas of
psychological functioning. This result may seem surprising, but
is consistent with the hypothesised mechanisms of action20,21,35
as well as international studies showing the benefit of the
micronutrient formula in the treatment of a wide range of mental
disorders.29,53–57 Further, in this study, micronutrient treatment
was found to be superior to placebo in ADHD adults with a high
rate of comorbid disorders (56%), a population that has been
documented to have lower rates of response to treatment than
adults with only ADHD.5
We also note that an equal number of participants in both
groups thought they were receiving placebo, so the observed
changes were unlikely to have been driven by expectancy effects.
Indeed, the relative absence of side-effects may have played a role
in these perceptions. As a result of the relatively slow change
observed
with
micronutrients
compared
with
standard
medications used to treat ADHD (i.e. stimulants), it is also
possible that although change was occurring, participants were
not aware of the change and hence thought they were on the
placebo. However, we also observed that some participants who
reported great improvements in their functioning still thought
they had taken the placebo, stating that vitamins and minerals
on their own could not achieve such large effects. Further,
guessing at group allocation may confound ‘true efficacy’,58 in that
individuals who think they are getting a placebo tend to show
lowered response rates.
A trend towards improvement in MADRS depression scores
was noted with micronutrient treatment (P = 0.078, ES = 0.41);
however, the baseline level of depression in the overall sample
was relatively low (mean 15.8). Post hoc analyses revealed a benefit
of micronutrients for adults with moderate to severe depression,
a finding consistent with other RCTs that show benefit of
micronutrients in improving mood.59,60
The Canterbury earthquakes, which directly affected many
participants in this study, may have dampened response rates
and affected life satisfaction, as these major earthquakes had a
wide impact on wellbeing in the community,61 as well as
cognitive
functions
including
attention.62
Nevertheless,
our
drop-out rate was low at 7.5% (n = 6) and adherence was
satisfactory (95%).
Many are inclined to ask which are the psychologically active
ingredients in a complex formula. This multi-ingredient approach
challenges conventional understanding in that medical treatments
tend to manipulate one variable (medication) at a time; however,
a single-ingredient strategy for nutritional treatments is at odds
with human physiology as optimal functioning requires the
presence of all nutrients in balance rather than one nutrient
provided in high doses.63 Indeed, single-nutrient studies have
yielded only modest findings,16 whereas broader interventions
may be more promising.29–33 The one-disease, one-nutrient
solution to illness is likely outdated, and may need to be replaced
by a model that is responsive to the broad spectrum of human
nutritional needs.64 The formula used in this study had all the
vitamins (except vitamin K) and 16 minerals. A consideration of
some of the ingredients and the role they play in brain metabolism
highlights the importance of the broad array of nutrients and may
help explain the non-specific effects the nutrients appear to have
on psychiatric symptoms. For example, pyridoxal 5’-phosphate
(vitamin B6) acts as a cofactor for the synthesis of gamma-amino-
butyric acid, serotonin and dopamine; 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
(vitamin B9) regenerates tetrahydrobiopterin, which is essential
for neurotransmitter formation; iron functions in the enzyme
system involved in the production of serotonin, noradrenaline,
adrenaline and dopamine, and is a cofactor in the metabolism
of tyrosine to dopamine; and niacinamide (vitamin B3) shunts
tryptophan to serotonin.21,65
There were no group differences on any adverse events. We
found no changes in creatinine, fasting sugar, haematological
indices,
liver
functions,
lipid
profile,
thryoid-stimulating
hormone, ferritin, iron, magnesium, calcium, zinc or copper.
These results are consistent with a review of over 140 patients
treated with this micronutrient formula, which did not identify
any significant adverse effects or safety concerns.34 We are unsure
whether the treatment caused sarcoidosis in one participant and
therefore this potential adverse effect needs to be monitored in
future research.
A statistically significant increase in prolactin with micro-
nutrient treatment was found in this study, but it was small and
unlikely to be clinically significant. No prolactin-related adverse
effects have been previously reported in the clinical trials on
broad-spectrum micronutrient treatment.34 Increased prolactin
might be caused by dopamine receptor blockade in the tubero-
infundibular pathway,66 consistent with research on zinc and B
vitamins, suggesting that micronutrients can affect the dopamine
inhibitory system,67,68 which influences prolactin levels. Neverthe-
less, given the raised prolactin, future studies should assess blood
changes over a longer period of time. Also, interactions with
medications would need to be carefully considered when using
micronutrients
given
some
concerns
raised
about
drug
interactions.53 This sample was largely unmedicated (with no
participants taking psychotropic medications during the trial)
and therefore these results may not be applicable to a medicated
population.
Blood nutrient levels of vitamins D, B12 and folic acid
increased more in the micronutrient group but only B12 levels rose
beyond reference levels, and no adverse effects are associated with
high B12 intake.69 Increased levels of these and other key vitamins
might contribute to the positive effects seen with micronutrient
administration, given their role in the regulation of homocysteine
metabolism,70 mood71,72 and neurotransmitter synthesis.73 These
levels also provide further evidence of good adherence in the
active group.
Limitations and future directions
Our trial relied predominantly on clinical interviews and self-
reports, since we were initially concerned with determining the
potential benefit of micronutrients for ADHD. Tools used in
future research might usefully include neurocognitive measures,
functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as metabolomic
methods to provide detailed metabolic information at the cellular
level. Generalisability of the results is limited by geographical
sampling and the need for individuals who were willing to
participate in an RCT and be adherent with the consumption of
a large number of pills. These factors may explain the higher than
expected IQ of the sample. Generalisability to individuals with
uncomplicated ADHD (free of other Axis I disorders) is also
limited by the high rate of comorbidity. Studying a ‘cleaner’ group
(that is, without comorbidity) might reveal specific effects on
individuals with ADHD; however, such a trial would have limited
generalisability to the majority of clinically referred adults with
ADHD where comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception.74
Long-term v. acute exposure to micronutrients also needs to be
investigated as longer exposure appears to be associated with
greater benefit, especially for inattention.30 Larger trials could
312
 Micronutrient treatment and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
determine whether the trends noted on some measures can be
confirmed.
The consumption of large numbers of pills was tedious for
some participants and likely the reason some people stopped
taking them at the end of the trial and this may make the
treatment less amenable to some people. It is expected that if
further studies replicate these results, manufacturing techniques
(that target improving the absorption of the minerals) may be
developed to reduce the number of pills. It is also worth
researching whether a similar benefit can be achieved through
consuming fewer pills with simultaneous changes in diet and
lifestyle.
We purposefully chose three primary outcomes to cover the
range of ADHD symptoms, to include multiple raters, and to
investigate more globally the impact of nutrients on mental health.
By separating out inattention from hyperactivity/impulsivity and
providing T-scores, we hope to assist the reader in interpreting
where clinically significant change may be occurring. Most studies
of pharmacological and psychological interventions for ADHD in
adults employ self-report75 and/or clinician assessment,76,77 so it is
a strength of the current study that data were also provided by
non-clinician observers (somewhat comparable to the use of
teacher ratings in child studies). Using multiple measures increases
the risk of type I errors, but most of the primary measures were
found to favour the active intervention over placebo, so it is unlikely
that our findings are a consequence of type I errors.
The findings reported here need to be interpreted cautiously
given the inconsistencies noted across raters; larger trials are
required to determine how robust these preliminary findings
are. Despite the modest changes, nutrients may turn out to be a
viable alternative to other treatments for some individuals. A
proportion of individuals taking the micronutrients in the trial
obtained scores on ADHD ratings after 8 weeks that were in the
normal non-clinical range, suggesting that it may be an effective
treatment for some, particularly those who do not tolerate or
choose not to take medications. Although most studies using
alternative treatments for ADHD have been done on children,
the effect sizes reported here are comparable if not better than
other non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD, including
omega-3s (ES = 0.16)78 and food restriction diets (ES = 0.51).78
There is often scepticism associated with using vitamins and
minerals for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms, despite a long
history of their use.21 The field is plagued with poorly designed
and controlled studies, often leading to erroneous conclusions.
However, with a growing number of well-controlled studies
supporting
their
use
across
a wide variety of
psychiatric
symptoms,18,79 perceptions are changing and some are publicly
calling for investigations of dietary treatments for ADHD.7
Although the results of nutrient treatments in short-term trials
for ADHD may be more modest compared with medication trials,
there are many reasons for urging further research on this topic:
(a) there is a growing body of literature documenting the
disappointing long-term outcomes of medications3,80–83 as a
primary treatment for some mental disorders; (b) there are
concerns being voiced from psychiatry84 about the outcomes of
some pharmaceutical treatments; and (c) medication side-effects
can be problematic for some patients. The current study, alongside
others, should provide a stimulus for further trials on nutrient
treatment for a variety of psychiatric symptoms.
