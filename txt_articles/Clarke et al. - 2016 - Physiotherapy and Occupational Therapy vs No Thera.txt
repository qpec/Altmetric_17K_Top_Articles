IMPORTANCE It is unclear whether physiotherapy and occupational therapy are clinically
effective and cost-effective in Parkinson disease (PD).
OBJECTIVE To perform a large pragmatic randomized clinical trial to evaluate the clinical
effectiveness of individualized physiotherapy and occupational therapy in PD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The PD REHAB Trial was a multicenter, open-label,
parallel group, controlled efficacy trial. A total of 762 patients with mild to moderate PD were
recruited from 38 sites across the United Kingdom. Recruitment took place between October
2009 and June 2012, with 15 months of follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS Participants with limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) were
randomized to physiotherapy and occupational therapy or no therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the Nottingham Extended
Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) Scale score at 3 months after randomization. Secondary
outcomes were health-related quality of life (assessed by Parkinson Disease
Questionnaire–39 and EuroQol-5D); adverse events; and caregiver quality of life. Outcomes
were assessed before trial entry and then 3, 9, and 15 months after randomization.
RESULTS Of the 762 patients included in the study (mean [SD] age, 70 [9.1] years), 381
received physiotherapy and occupational therapy and 381 received no therapy. At 3 months,
there was no difference between groups in NEADL total score (difference, 0.5 points; 95% CI,
−0.7 to 1.7; P = .41) or Parkinson Disease Questionnaire–39 summary index (0.007 points;
95% CI, −1.5 to 1.5; P = .99). The EuroQol-5D quotient was of borderline significance in favor
of therapy (−0.03; 95% CI, −0.07 to −0.002; P = .04). The median therapist contact time was
4 visits of 58 minutes over 8 weeks. Repeated-measures analysis showed no difference in
NEADL total score, but Parkinson Disease Questionnaire–39 summary index (diverging 1.6
points per annum; 95% CI, 0.47 to 2.62; P = .005) and EuroQol-5D score (0.02; 95% CI,
0.00007 to 0.03; P = .04) showed small differences in favor of therapy. There was no
difference in adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Physiotherapy and occupational therapy were not associated
with immediate or medium-term clinically meaningful improvements in ADL or quality of life
in mild to moderate PD. This evidence does not support the use of low-dose,
patient-centered, goal-directed physiotherapy and occupational therapy in patients in the
early stages of PD. Future research should explore the development and testing of more
structured and intensive physical and occupational therapy programs in patients with all
stages of PD.

P
arkinson disease (PD) causes problems with activities
of daily living (ADL) that are only partially treated by
medication and occasionally surgery. Despite treat-
ment, patients go on to develop intractable motor problems,
including falls, with mental health problems and other non-
motorsymptoms.Physiotherapy(PT)andoccupationaltherapy
(OT) are traditionally used later in the disease.1 However, ser-
viceprovisionvarieswidely,withsomecentersinvolvingphys-
iotherapists and occupational therapists from diagnosis, while
other areas have no specialist services.
Cochrane reviews of PT for PD found small but signifi-
cant effects on motor function but not quality of life (QoL).2,3
A Cochrane review of OT found insufficient evidence of
effectiveness.4 Previous trials with both therapies were small
with short-term follow-up.2-4 Despite this lack of evidence, the
UK National Institute for Health and Care Effectiveness guide-
lines, although recognizing these shortcomings and recom-
mending further trials, stated that all patients should have ac-
cess to both therapies.1
The PD REHAB Trial was designed to evaluate the clinical
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of individualized PT and
OT in patients with PD. The current trial design was informed
by our pilot study of OT in PD.5
Methods
The PD REHAB Trial was a large-scale pragmatic, multi-
center, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects of in-
dividualized PT and OT on ADL and QoL in patients with PD.
The full trial protocol can be found in Supplement 1.
Study Participants
Recruitment took place between October 2009 and June 2012.
Patients from 38 neurology or geriatric medicine outpatient
centers across the United Kingdom were invited to take part.
Eligibility criteria were idiopathic PD defined by UK Parkin-
son Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria6; self- or caregiver-
reported limitations in ADL; and the investigator was uncer-
tain that the patient would require PT and/or OT during the 15
months of the trial (ie, equipoise about the need for therapy
existed). Exclusion criteria were dementia as locally defined
and receipt of PT or OT for PD in the last 12 months. All pa-
tients gave written informed consent before randomization.
Ethical approval was granted by the West Midlands Research
Ethics Committee and local approval was obtained at each par-
ticipating center.
Randomization and Therapy Allocation
Patients were randomized (1:1) between combined PT and OT
(therapies group) or no therapy (control group) using an on-
line randomization service at the University of Birmingham
Clinical Trials Unit. Randomization used a computer-based
algorithm with minimization by baseline Nottingham Ex-
tendedActivitiesofDailyLiving(NEADL)Scaletotalscore(limi-
tations in ADL: severe, 0-21; moderate, 22-43; and mild 44-
66), Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage7 (≤2; 2.5; 3; and ≥4), and age
(<60; 60-69; 70-79; and ≥80 years).
Intervention
PhysiotherapyandOTweredeliveredinthecommunityand/or
outpatient setting by qualified therapists working within the
National Health Service (NHS) per local practice. Before the
trial, a framework for therapy content was developed and
agreed on by expert therapist groups based on previous work
on standards of NHS PT and OT and European guidelines.8-11
This framework was based on usual NHS practice and not an
innovative intervention. Following initial assessments by both
therapists, therapy was tailored to an individual patient’
s re-
quirements using a patient-centered joint goal-setting ap-
proach. Interactions between therapists and patients were de-
scribed and quantified using predefined recording forms and
included administration time (eg, ordering equipment). Con-
trolpatientsconsentedtohavetherapiesdeferreduntiltheend
of the 15-month trial, unless pressing reasons for therapy de-
veloped. Because therapies may have been arranged outside
the trial, control patients were asked whether they had re-
ceived any therapy at each assessment point.
Primary Outcome Measure
Total NEADL score at 3 months after randomization was the
primary outcome measure.12 The NEADL measures instru-
mentalADL,whicharespecificallyaddressedbyPTandOTand
includes more complex ADL issues such as making a meal,
cleaning, and traveling on public transport. The NEADL scale
was developed for stroke but is used widely as a generic out-
come measure in rehabilitation trials of older people. It is sen-
sitive to change in OT trials13 and was successfully used in our
pilot study of OT for PD, with good correlation with the Uni-
fied Parkinson Disease Rating Scale and the Parkinson Dis-
ease Questionnaire–39 (PDQ-39) ADL domains.5
Secondaryoutcomemeasureswerepatient-ratedQoLusing
the39-itemPDQ,14consistingof8domainsandthemostwidely
used disease-specific QoL rating scale for PD, and EuroQol-5D
(EQ-5D, 3-level version), a generic QoL scale; adverse events;
andcaregiverwell-beingusingShortForm–12(SF-12,version2).
Followingariskassessment,onlytherapy-relatedadverseevents
and serious adverse events were recorded. These were defined
as falls or equipment failure leading to injury requiring a hos-
pital, general practitioner, or ambulance visit or to death. A
healtheconomicsanalysiswasconductedalongsidePDREHAB

Key Points
Question: Are physiotherapy and occupational therapy clinically
effective in Parkinson disease?
Findings: In this randomized clinical trial in 762 patients with mild
to moderate Parkinson disease, physiotherapy and
occupational therapy were not associated with immediate or
medium-term clinically meaningful improvements in activities of
daily living or quality of life.
Meaning: This study shows that more structured and intensive
physical and occupational therapy programs should be developed
and tested at all stages of Parkinson disease.

tiondosagewasconvertedintolevodopadoseequivalentsusing
a standard formula.15
Statistical Analysis
A minimally clinically important change in NEADL score in pa-
tients with stroke is 1 to 2 points.16 However, such a small
change may be of little benefit to patients; a clinically mean-
ingful change in NEADL for patients is likely to be around
double this at 2.5 points. A 2-point change in NEADL score rep-
resents becoming independent in 1 item (eg, stair climbing and
crossing roads) or improvement in 2 items (eg, being depen-
dent on another person with help to being fully indepen-
dent). To detect a 2.5-point difference in NEADL at 3 months
(usingtheobservedSDfromthePDOTpilottrial5of10.1points;
P = .05, 2-tailed; 90% power) required 340 patients in each
group: this increased to 750 participants (375 per group) to al-
low for around 10% noncompliance and drop out.

a Eight patients randomized to the PT and OT group were later found to be
ineligible because they had received PT and/or OT for PD in the 12 months
prior to randomization (exclusion criteria). One patient did not receive any PT
or OT after randomization (crossover; only baseline data available: diagnosed
as having cancer and died at 5 months after randomization). One patient did
not receive PT or OT within 3 months but was referred for PT outside of the
trial at 6 months (3-, 9-, and 15-month data available). The other 6 patients all
received PT and/or OT after randomization (baseline and 3-month data
available except for 1 patient, where only baseline data were available).
bThree patients randomized to the no therapy group were subsequently found
to be ineligible because they had received PT and/or OT for PD in the 12
months prior to randomization (exclusion criteria). One patient received PT
and/or OT within 3 months of randomization (crossover). For all 3 patients,
baseline and 3-month data were available.
c Thirteen patients randomized to the PT and OT group are known to have not
received any PT or OT. Baseline and 3-month data are available for 2 of these
patients (for the other 11 patients, only baseline data are available). Twelve
patients did not receive PT or OT by 3 months after randomization but did
start therapy after 3 months; baseline and 3-month data are available for all
patients (except 2, 1 of whom had baseline data only and 1 who had 3-month
data only).
dNine patients randomized to no therapy had some PT and/or OT before their
3-month NEADL form was completed; all patients had baseline and 3-month
data available.
e Partially withdrawn patients did not want to complete patient forms but
agreed to clinical follow-up.

Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
Missing data in PDQ-39 domain scores were imputed using an
expectation maximization algorithm.17,18 There is no estab-
lished imputation method for the NEADL scale; therefore, pri-
mary analyses used available data only, with no imputation for
missing values. However, sensitivity analyses using a best
(score, 3), worst (score, 0), middle (score, 1.5), and average (at
participant level) case score for missing items on the NEADL
were explored. Three a priori subgroup analyses used a test of
interaction to explore the effect of the therapies at 3 months
at different levels of ADL, disease stage, and age. All sub-
group analyses were interpreted cautiously.
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Insti-
tute).Interimanalysesofunblindedefficacyandsafetydatawere

Results
Study Population
A total of 762 people with PD were randomized to either com-
bined PT and OT or no therapy (381 per group; Figure 1). Base-
line characteristics were similar between groups (Table 1). The
meanagewas70years,65%weremale,andthemediandisease
durationwas3.1years(mean,4.6years).Mostpatientshadmild
tomoderatedisease,with67%inH&Ystage2orless(254patients
in each group) and median NEADL total score of 54 (mean, 51).
At3months,92%ofpatients(350inthePT/OTarmand349
in the no therapy arm) in each arm had completed the NEADL
(Figure 1). By 15 months, 311 (82% of 381 patients randomized)
in the therapies arm had completed the NEADL compared with
322 (85% of 381 patients randomized) in the control arm.
Twenty-five patients (6%) allocated to the therapies arm
did not receive therapy by 3 months after randomization (12
started PT and/or OT after 3 months and 13 never received any
therapy; Figure 1). Nine patients (2%) allocated to no therapy
received therapy for PD-related problems within 3 months,
mainly owing to worsening PD symptoms including falls and
imbalance (Figure 1).
Therapy Content
In the therapies group, the median number of therapy ses-
sions was 4 (range, 1-21), with a mean time per session of 58
minutes.Themeandurationoftherapywas8weeks.Themean
total dose of both therapies was 263 minutes (range, 38-1198

physiotherapists provided specific PD exercise advice accom-
panied by a booklet, and there was no evidence of a formal ex-
ercise progression protocol for any patient. Occupational
therapy assessed the full range of ADL, but predominant in-
terventions were equipment provision, onward referral, and
other advice (eg, management of sleep disorders and apply-
ing for benefits). There was little task-related practice.
Outcome Measures
The mean NEADL total score deteriorated from baseline to 3
months by 1.5 points in the therapies group compared with 1.0
point in the no therapy group (difference, 0.5 points; 95% CI,
−0.7 to 1.7; P = .41; Table 2). No difference was seen in any of
the individual categories of the NEADL score (Table 2). Re-
peated-measures analysis of the NEADL across all points
showed no difference between the treatment arms (Figure 2;
eTable 1 in Supplement 2).

but there was no difference in the mobility domain. There was
also a borderline significant difference over time in the EQ-5D

0.03; P = .04; Figure 2).

Planned subgroup analyses for NEADL total score found
no evidence of difference in therapy effect at 3 months ac-
cording to baseline total NEADL score, age, or disease sever-
ity (eFigure in Supplement 2).
Four hundred and seventy three patients (62%) had a care-
giver and 406 caregivers (86%) agreed to take part in the trial
(meanage,67years;76%female).Therelationshipbetweenpa-
tient and caregiver was most often partner or spouse (72%). Al-
thoughtherewasnodifferenceincaregiverSF-12physicalcom-
ponent score at 3 months, there was less decline in caregiver
SF-12 mental component score (difference, −2.1; 95 CI, −3.9 to
–0.3; P = .02; Table 3) although this was not maintained with
longer follow-up (eTable 3 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Adverse Events
Targeted adverse events are detailed in eTable 5 in the
Supplement 2. There were no differences in adverse events be-
tween trial arms at 3 or 15 months.

term significant differences in QoL measured by PDQ-39 sum-
mary index and EQ-5D quotient in favor of therapy were small
anddidnotreachclinicallysignificantlevels,whichwedefined
as twice the minimally clinically important change levels.
OurCochranereviewofPTvsnointerventioninPDshowed
that all forms of PT produced small benefits in motor function
and ADL but no change in QoL.19 The Cochrane review of OT
foundinsufficientevidenceabouteffectivenessin2smalltrials,4
althoughalarge(n = 191)DutchtrialfoundthatOTimprovedself-
perceived performance but not QoL.20 The absence of any mo-
tor effect (PDQ-39 mobility domain) or response in ADL in the
PD REHAB Trial is likely to be multifactorial owing to early dis-
easestageofmostpatients,low“dose”ofintervention,andlack
of consistency in therapy assessment and intervention.
Traditionally, PT and OT have been used in the more ad-
vanced stages of PD, once imbalance and falls have devel-
oped (H&Y stage ≥3).1 As a result of using the uncertainty prin-
ciple for entry into the trial, most patients in the PD REHAB
Trial had H&Y stage less than 3 at randomization. It is pos-
sible that such mild to moderate disease may not respond to
the therapies, whereas more severe disease may respond, al-
though this remains to be established. As a consequence, the
results of the PD REHAB Trial can only be generalized to pa-
tients with mild to moderate disease.
Median therapy dose was 4 sessions of 58 minutes over
8 weeks for both therapies combined. This is low in compari-
son with the 5 PT trials in the Cochrane review (5-52 weeks
of therapy).3 In a Dutch trial of PT in PD (ParkinsonNet),21
total contact time (over 6 months) between patients and
physiotherapists was 15 sessions of 30 minutes, nearly
double that in the PD REHAB Trial, but the study also
showed no evidence in favor of therapy. Importantly, the
dose delivered in the PD REHAB Trial reflects routine NHS
practice.

Therapy expert groups recommended an individual “goal-
setting” approach for PD REHAB interventions because this is
the gold standard and addresses the personalized needs and
wishes of the individual. Therapy content was in keeping with
NHS and European guidelines on PT and OT.8-11 However, an
individualizedgoal-settingapproachwiththiscontentmaynot
be transferable to patients with mild disease. The lack of task-
related practice is of particular concern because this has been
shown to be a significant factor in stroke rehabilitation trials.22
We were also concerned by the low prescription and dose of
exercise in the PD REHAB Trial.
The possibility that patients with more severe disease
might show a better response was examined in a planned sub-
group analysis examining response according to baseline
NEADL score and H&Y stage. While the data did not support
this hypothesis, the numbers with severe disease were small,
so this is likely to be underpowered. Similarly, older patients
might respond better to the therapies because of greater lev-
els of frailty and comorbidities, but there was no evidence of
this in the subgroup analysis.
Thefidelityoftheinterventionwasreasonableinbotharms
of this pragmatic real-world trial. In the therapies arm, 93% of
patients (n = 353) received therapies within 3 months of ran-
domization. Whereas, only 2% (n = 9) of the no therapy arm
crossed over to receive treatment within 3 months, mainly ow-
ing to motor progression. It is unlikely that these small pro-
portions of crossovers led to the lack of effect seen in the trial.
Despite all patients reporting ADL problems at baseline,
many had mild disease. A total of 29% (n = 221) had a NEADL
scoreatbaselineofgreaterthan61and14%(n = 107)hadascore
of 65 or greater (mean baseline score, 51). This may have led
to a floor effect because the NEADL score could not improve
much from a good baseline score. However, planned sub-
group analysis showed that there was still no response in pa-
tients with more severe baseline NEADL scores. It should also
be noted that the NEADL results are supported by the lack of
a clinically meaningful effect on PDQ-39 ADL domain.
