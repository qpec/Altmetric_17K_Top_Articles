*Cosponsoring Organizations: European Society of Endocrinology.

Objective: To update the “Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes”
guideline published in 2010.
Participants: The participants include an Endocrine Society–appointed task force of 10 medical
content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.
Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations
and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best
available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.
Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications
facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring
organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.
Conclusions: We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and
signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T
concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an ac-
curate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by
repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near
the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone–binding globulin, we
recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using
an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional
diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for
men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct
symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of

 monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T
therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following con-
ditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen
level . 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen . 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer
(e.g., African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer)
without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep
apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction
or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute
T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with
any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics,
formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men
receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects,
and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate
cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 103: 1715–1744,

Summary of Recommendations
1.0 Diagnosis of hypogonadism in men
Diagnosis of men with suspected hypogonadism
1.1 We recommend diagnosing hypogonadism in
men with symptoms and signs of testosterone
deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low
serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone
concentrations (when indicated). (1j���O)
Screening and case detection for hypogonadism
1.2 We recommend against routine screening of men
in the general population for hypogonadism.
(1j��OO)
Distinguishing between primary or
secondary hypogonadism
1.3 In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend
distinguishing between primary (testicular) and
secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism
by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-
stimulating hormone concentrations. (1j���O)
Evaluation for determining the etiology
of hypogonadism
1.4 In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further
evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic,
pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction. (2j��OO)
2.0 Treatment of hypogonadism with testosterone
2.1 We recommend testosterone therapy in hypo-
gonadal men to induce and maintain secondary
sex characteristics and correct symptoms of tes-
tosterone deficiency. (1j���O)
2.2 We recommend against testosterone therapy in
menplanning fertilityinthe nearterm orinmen with
breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule
or induration, a prostate-specific antigen level .
4 ng/mL, a prostate-specific antigen level . 3 ng/mL
combined with a high risk of prostate cancer
(without further urological evaluation), elevated
hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea,
severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled
heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within
the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. (1j��OO)
2.3 In hypogonadal men 55 to 69 years old, who are
being considered for testosterone therapy and
have a life expectancy . 10 years, we suggest dis-
cussing the potential benefits and risks of evaluating
prostate cancer risk and prostate monitoring and
engaging the patient in shared decision making
regarding prostate cancer monitoring. For patients
who choose monitoring, clinicians should assess
prostate cancer risk before starting testosterone
treatment and 3 to 12 months after starting tes-
tosterone (2j�OOO). In hypogonadal men being
considered for testosterone therapy who are 40 to
69 years old and at increased risk of prostate cancer
(e.g., African Americans and men with a first-degree
relative with diagnosed prostate cancer), we suggest
discussing prostate cancer risk with the patient and
offering monitoring options. (2j�OOO)
Older men with age-related decline in
testosterone concentration
2.4 We suggest against routinely prescribing testos-
terone therapy to all men 65 years or older with
low testosterone concentrations (1j��OO). In
men .65 years who have symptoms or conditions
suggestive of testosterone deficiency (such as low
libido or unexplained anemia) and consisten-
tly and unequivocally low morning testosterone

 concentrations, we suggest that clinicians offer
testosterone therapy on an individualized basis
after explicit discussion of the potential risks and
benefits. (2j��OO)
HIV-infected men with weight loss
2.5 We suggest that clinicians consider short-term
testosterone therapy in HIV-infected men with
low testosterone concentrations and weight loss
(when other causes of weight loss have been ex-
cluded) to induce and maintain body weight and
lean mass gain. (2j��OO)
Men with type 2 diabetes mellitus
2.6 In men with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have
low testosterone concentrations, we recommend
against testosterone therapy as a means of im-
proving glycemic control. (1j��OO)
3.0 Monitoring of testosterone
replacement therapy
3.1 In hypogonadal men who have started testoster-
one therapy, we recommend evaluating the pa-
tient after treatment initiation to assess whether
the patient has responded to treatment, is suffering
any adverse effects, and is complying with the treat-
ment regimen. (Ungraded Good Practice Statement)
3.2 We recommend a urological consultation for
hypogonadal men receiving testosterone treat-
ment if during the first 12 months of testosterone
treatment there is a confirmed increase in prostate-
specific antigen concentration . 1.4 ng/mL above
baseline, a confirmed prostate-specific anti-
gen . 4.0 ng/mL, or a prostatic abnormality de-
tected on digital rectal examination. After 1 year,
prostate monitoring should conform to standard
guidelines for prostate cancer screening based on
the race and age of the patient. (2j��OO)
Method of Development of Evidence-Based
Clinical Practice Guidelines
The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society
deemed testosterone (T) therapy in men with hypogonadism a
priority area and appointed a task force to update the “Tes-
tosterone Therapy in Men with Androgen Deficiency Syn-
dromes” guideline published in 2010. The task force formulated
evidence-based recommendations following the approach rec-
ommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation Group, an international com-
mittee with expertise in the development and implementation of
evidence-based guidelines (1). A detailed description of the
grading scheme has been published elsewhere (2). The task force
used the best available research evidence to develop the rec-
ommendations. The task force also used consistent language
and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recom-
mendation and the quality of evidence. In terms of the strength
of a recommendation, strong recommendations use the phrase
“we recommend” and the number 1, and conditional recom-
mendations use the phrase “we suggest” and the number 2.
Cross-filled circles indicate the quality of the evidence, such that
�OOO denotes very low-quality evidence; ��OO, low quality;
���O, moderate quality; and ����, high quality. The task
force has confidence that persons who receive care according to
the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more good
than harm. Conditional recommendations require more careful
consideration of the person’s circumstances, values, and pref-
erences to determine the best course of action. Linked to each
recommendation is a description of the evidence and the values
that the task force considered in making the recommendation; in
some instances, there are remarks, a section in which the task
force offers technical suggestions for testing conditions, dosing,
and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the best
available evidence applied to a typical person being treated.
Often this evidence comes from the unsystematic observations
of the task force and their values and preferences; therefore, one
should consider these remarks as suggestions.
In this guideline, the task force made several statements to
emphasize the importance of: informing the patient regarding
potential benefits and risks of testosterone treatment and of
monitoring treatment; shared decision making; general pre-
ventive care measures; and basic principles of androgen de-
ficiency screening, diagnosis, and treatment. They labeled these
“Ungraded Good Practice Statement.” Direct evidence for these
statements was either unavailable or not systematically ap-
praised. The intention of these statements is to draw attention
and remind providers of these principles (3).
The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict-of-
interest review process for developing clinical practice guide-
lines. All task force members must declare any potential
conflicts of interest by completing a conflict-of-interest form.
The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee reviews all conflicts of
interest before the Society’s Council approves the members to
participate on the task force and periodically during the de-
velopment of the guideline. All others participating in the
guideline’s development must also disclose any conflicts of
interest in the matter under study, and most of these participants
must be without any conflicts of interest.
Conflicts of interest are defined as remuneration in any
amount from commercial interests; grants; research support;
consulting fees; salary; ownership interests [e.g., stocks and
stock options (excluding diversified mutual funds)]; honoraria
and other payments for participation in speakers’ bureaus,
advisory boards, or boards of directors; and all other financial
benefits. Completed forms are available through the Endocrine
Society office. The Endocrine Society provided all funding for
this guideline; the task force received no funding or remuner-
ation from commercial or other entities.
The Endocrine Society’s clinical practice guidelines are de-
veloped to be of assistance to endocrinologists by providing
guidance and recommendations for specific areas of practice.
The guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper
approaches or methods, or exclusive of others. The guidelines

 cannot guarantee any specific outcome, nor do they establish a
standard of care. The guidelines are not intended to dictate the
treatment of a particular patient. Treatment decisions must be
made based on the independent judgment of health care pro-
viders and each patient’s individual circumstances.

Commissioned Systematic Review
The guideline task force commissioned two systematic
reviews to assist with summarizing the evidence base
for this guideline. The first review determined whether
T-replacement therapy improves sexual function, phys-
ical function, fatigue, mood, cognition, anemia, and bone
mineral density in men with hypogonadism (4). The re-
view included placebo-controlled trials that allocated
subjects either using randomization or minimization with
concealed subject allocation and that recruited hypo-
gonadal men who had symptoms, a screening total
testosterone level , 300 ng/dL, and for whom the in-
tervention raised serum testosterone concentrations into
the normal range. The review only included trials that
used testosterone or its esters. The review identified 11
reports of four trials with 1779 participants. All in-
cluded trials tested transdermal therapy with a duration
of therapy that ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. The mean
baseline total testosterone concentrations ranged from 201
to 239 ng/dL. All studies were placebo-controlled trials
that used randomization or allocation-by-minimization
with a low risk of bias.
The meta-analysis suggested that testosterone treat-
ment was associated with a small but statistically sig-
nificant improvement in libido [standardized mean
difference (SMD), 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI),
0.01, 0.34], erectile function (SMD, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.06,
0.27), sexual activity (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.13, 0.33),
and sexual satisfaction (SMD, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.01, 0.31),
as compared with participants receiving placebo. SMD of
0.2 is considered a small treatment effect, 0.5 a medium
treatment effect, and 0.8 a large treatment effect. Re-
searchers observed no statistically significant difference
in energy or mood. Data about cognition and bone
mineral density were only available in one trial, which
reported no significant improvement in measures of
cognition but did report improvements in areal and
volumetric bone mineral density and bone strength in the
spine and hip.
The second review determined whether T-replacement
therapy is associated with an increased risk of lower
urinary tract symptoms and erythrocytosis in men with
hypogonadism. The review identified nine studies of
three trials with 1581 patients. Studies were placebo-
controlled trials that used randomization or allocation-
by-minimization with low-to-moderate risk of bias. All
included trials tested transdermal therapy with a du-
ration of therapy that ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. The
mean baseline total testosterone concentrations ranged
from 201 to 236 ng/dL. Meta-analysis suggested that
testosterone treatment was associated with signifi-
cantly higher frequency of erythrocytosis (hemato-
crit . 54%) (relative risk, 8.14; 95% CI, 1.87, 35.40).
There was no significant difference in the change in
lower urinary tract symptoms (mean difference, 0.38,
95% CI, 20.67, 1.43) between the testosterone and
placebo groups. The evidence from these trials war-
ranted moderate and high certainty, respectively, in the
provided estimates.
1.0 Diagnosis of Hypogonadism in Men
Hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome that results from
failure of the testis to produce physiological concentra-
tions of testosterone (T) (T deficiency) and/or a normal
number of spermatozoa due to pathology at one or more
concentrations of the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular
axis (5, 6). Abnormalities at the testicular level cause
primary hypogonadism, whereas defects of the hypo-
thalamus or the pituitary cause secondary hypogonad-
ism. Hypogonadism also can result from defects that
affect both the testis and the hypothalamus–pituitary
unit. This guideline describes the diagnosis, treatment,
and monitoring of T deficiency and does not address
isolated defects of spermatogenesis.
Primary hypogonadism results in low T concentra-
tions, impairment of spermatogenesis, and elevated go-
nadotropin levels. Causes of primary hypogonadism
include Klinefelter syndrome (KS), cryptorchidism, some
types of cancer chemotherapy, radiation to the testes,
trauma, torsion, infectious orchitis, HIV infection,
anorchia syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy (5).
Secondary hypogonadism results in low T concen-
trations, impairment of spermatogenesis, and low or
inappropriately normal gonadotropin levels. Causes of
secondary hypogonadism include hyperprolactinemia;
severe obesity; iron overload syndromes; the use of
opioids, glucocorticoids, or androgen-deprivation ther-
apy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists;
androgenic–anabolic steroid (AAS) withdrawal syn-
drome; idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism;
hypothalamic or pituitary tumors or infiltrative disease;
head trauma; and pituitary surgery or radiation.
Combined primary and secondary hypogonadism results
in low T concentrations, impairment of spermatogenesis,

 and variable gonadotropin levels, depending on whether
primary or secondary hypogonadism predominates.
Causes of hypogonadism may be organic or func-
tional, a distinction that has important clinical impli-
cations (Table 1). Organic hypogonadism (also referred
to as “classical” hypogonadism) is caused by a con-
genital, structural, or destructive disorder that results in
permanent hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular dys-
function (primary or secondary hypogonadism). In
contrast, functional hypogonadism is caused by con-
ditions that suppress gonadotropin and T concentra-
tions but that are potentially reversible with treatment of
the underlying etiology.
The classification of hypogonadism as primary or
secondary has therapeutic implications. Spermatogenesis
can be stimulated and fertility can be restored with ap-
propriate gonadotropin therapy in patients with sec-
ondary hypogonadism but not in patients with primary
hypogonadism. Fertility options for men with primary
testicular failure are limited to the use of donor sperm,
adoption, or (in some patients) assisted reproductive
technologies, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection
using sperm in the ejaculate or following testicular sperm
extraction. Additionally, the process of evaluating sec-
ondary hypogonadism may uncover a deficiency/excess
of other pituitary hormones or a hypothalamic or
pituitary tumor that may require management in addition
to treating hypogonadism. Secondary hypogonadism can
result from functional causes (e.g., obesity, opioids, or
systemic illness) that might be reversible by treating the
underlying condition or discontinuing the offending
medication. Managing the underlying conditions, such as
obesity, may have additional health benefits. In some
instances, educating patients that obesity or opioids may
be contributing to hypogonadism could motivate them to
lose weight or discontinue narcotic pain medications.
Diagnosis of men with suspected hypogonadism
1.1 We recommend diagnosing hypogonadism in men
with symptoms and signs of testosterone de-
ficiency and unequivocally and consistently low
serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone
concentrations (when indicated). (1j���O)
Technical remark
• Testosterone concentrations exhibit significant di-
urnal and day-to-day variations and may be sup-
pressed by food intake or glucose. Therefore,
clinicians should measure total testosterone con-
centrations on two separate mornings when the
patient is fasting. Clinicians should use an accurate
and reliable method, optimally, an assay that has
been certified by an accuracy-based standardization
or quality control program [e.g., Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Hormone Stan-
dardization Program for Testosterone].
• In men who have conditions that alter sex
hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) (Table 2), or
whose initial total testosterone concentrations are at
or near the lower limit of the normal range (Fig. 1),
clinicians should determine free testosterone con-
centrations either directly from equilibrium dialysis
assays or by calculations that use total testosterone,
SHBG,
and
albumin
concentrations.
Clinicians
should not use direct analog-based free testosterone
immunoassays, as they are inaccurate.
• Clinicians should not test men for testosterone
deficiency who have or are recovering from an
acute illness or are engaged in short-term use of
medications (e.g., opioids) that suppress testos-
terone concentrations.
Evidence
The diagnosis of hypogonadism in men poses several
challenges:
1. The clinical presentation of hypogonadism in men
depends on the age of onset of T deficiency. Men

 who have prepubertal onset of hypogonadism that
is not adequately treated will exhibit eunuchoidal
proportions, lack of development of second-
ary sex characteristics, and high-pitched voice
(eunuchodism) (5, 6).
2. The symptoms and signs of T deficiency are non-
specific and modified by age, comorbid illness,
severity and duration of T deficiency, variations
in androgen sensitivity, and previous T therapy.
Table 3 lists signs and symptoms based on the
clinical experience of severely T-deficient men and
their response to T-replacement therapy (5, 6);
there are no population-based surveys of symp-
toms and signs in men with the full spectrum of
severity of hypogonadism. Incomplete or delayed
sexual
development,
loss
of
secondary
sex
characteristics (such as body hair), and very small
testes are specific manifestations of hypogonadism
(Table 3).
3. In surveys of community-dwelling middle-aged and
older men, low libido, erectile dysfunction, and less
specific symptoms (such as fatigue, irritability,
depressed mood, poor concentration, reduced
physical performance, and sleep disturbance) are
associated with low T concentrations (10, 11). In
the European Male Aging Study (a cohort study of
community-dwelling middle-aged and older men
in Europe), only sexual symptoms (poor morning
erections, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction)
had a syndromic association with total T (TT)
concentrations , 320 ng/dL (11 nmol/L) and free
T (FT) , 64 pg/mL (220 pmol/L) (after adjusting
for age) (12). T alone is required to maintain lean
mass and muscle size and strength; estradiol
is required to prevent increases in fat mass and
vasomotor symptoms, and both T and estradiol
are required to maintain sexual function and bone
mineral density (BMD) (13, 14). The conversion of
T to dihydrotestosterone is not obligatory for
mediating its effects on erythropoiesis or muscle
mass and strength (15).
4. T concentrations may be affected by acute illness,
nutritional deficiency, and by certain medications
(e.g., opioids and glucocorticoids). T concentra-
tions also are affected by age, obesity, diabetes,
sleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA), and health status (10, 16). Therefore,
assessing men for T deficiency should include a
general health evaluation to exclude systemic ill-
ness, eating disorders, excessive exercise, sleep
disorders, and use of recreational drugs and certain
medications (e.g., opioids or high-dose glucocor-
ticoid therapy) that affect T production or meta-
bolism (5, 6).
5. Heritability can explain a substantial fraction
of population-level variations in T concentrations
among men (17).
6. Serum T concentrations vary significantly as a re-
sult of diurnal, circadian, and circannual rhythms,
episodic secretion, and assay variations (18, 19).
Serum T concentrations exhibit a diurnal variation
with peak values in the morning; aging reduces the
magnitude of this diurnal variation (18). Despite
this attenuation of the diurnal rhythm in older
men, a substantial fraction of 65- to 80-year-old
men who have low serum T concentrations in the
afternoon will have normal T concentrations in the
morning (9). Glucose and food intake suppress T
concentrations (20, 21). Therefore, clinicians
should measure T concentrations in the morning
after an overnight fast.
7. It is important to confirm low T concentrations,
because 30% of men with an initial T concen-
tration in the hypogonadal range have a normal T
concentration on repeat measurement (19). Also, a
small fraction of healthy young men have a T
concentration below the normal range during a
24-hour period (22). Day-to-day variations in
serum T concentrations in a community-based,
multiethnic cohort of middle-aged to older men

 Figure 1. An approach for the diagnostic evaluation of adult men suspected of having T deficiency. *The lower limit of the normal total
testosterone (TT) harmonized to the CDC standard in healthy nonobese young men is 264 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L) (9); this limit could be used for TT
assays that are CDC certified. For laboratories that are not CDC certified and do not participate in an accuracy-based quality control program, the
reference range may vary considerably depending on the assay and reference population used. Using the lower limit of the range established
in local laboratories may not accurately identify men with hypogonadism. #free testosterone (FT) should be measured by an equilibrium
dialysis method or estimated from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin using a formula that accurately reflects FT by equilibrium dialysis. A
harmonized reference range for FT has not been established, so reference ranges may vary considerably depending on the specific equilibrium
dialysis method or the algorithm used to calculate FT. Therefore, until a harmonized reference range is established, the lower limits
established by the laboratory may be used. $Conditions in which measurement of FT concentration is recommended, including those
conditions that alter SHBG levels, are listed in Table 3. **TT may also be high in some conditions in which SHBG levels are high, such as HIV

 measurements were inadequate to characterize an
individual’s concentrations. At least two T mea-
surements were needed to diagnose T deficiency
with confidence (9, 19).
8. TT concentrations are measured using radioim-
munoassay, immunometric assays, or liquid
chromatography–tandem
mass
spectrometry.
There is considerable interassay and interlaboratory
variability in TT measurements. When 1133 labo-
ratories using 14 different assays measured TT
concentrations using the same College of Ameri-
can Pathologists quality control sample from a
single hypogonadal man, the measured values
ranged from 45 to 365 ng/dL (1.6 to 12.7 nmol/L)
(23). Similar large interassay and interlaboratory
variability occurs with FT measurements. The var-
iability in T measurements is partly due to calibrator
differences and to biotin interference in some im-
munoassays. Since 2010, the CDC has provided an
accuracy-based standardization program for T
(CDC Hormone Standardization Program for
Testosterone).
Although
several
commercial
laboratories, some assay manufacturers, and some
academic laboratories are now CDC certified,
most T immunoassay kit manufacturers and local
hospital-based laboratories have not been certi-
fied. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spec-
trometry assays for TT generally offer higher
concentrations of specificity, sensitivity, and
precision (especially in the low range) than do
most immunoassays. Clinicians should ideally
measure TT using a CDC-certified assay or an
assay verified by an accuracy-based external
quality control program.
9. Serum TT concentration represents the sum of
unbound and protein-bound T in circulation. Most
of the circulating T is bound to SHBG and albumin
and, to a lesser extent, to cortisol-binding globulin
and orosomucoid; only 2.0% to 4.0% of circu-
lating T is unbound or free (24). The term “bio-
available T” refers to unbound T plus T bound with
low affinity to albumin, reflecting the view that
albumin-bound T is dissociable at the capillary
level, especially in tissues with relatively long blood
transit times (such as the liver and brain), and is
biologically available for action in those tissues
(24). The free hormone hypothesis states that in-
tracellular concentrations and biologic activity of a
hormone are dependent upon the concentrations of
the free rather than protein-bound hormone in
plasma (24). Support for the free hormone hy-
pothesis has come from a recent analysis of the
European Male Aging Study data, which showed
that (compared to middle-aged and older men who
had normal TT and FT concentrations) men with
low FT concentrations had sexual and physical
symptoms consistent with T deficiency, regardless
of their TT concentrations (25). Importantly, men
with low TT but normal FT concentrations were
more obese (and presumably had lower SHBG
levels) and did not have associated sexual or
physical symptoms (25). Also, a man with a mis-
sense mutation of the SHBG gene who had com-
plete deficiency of SHBG and very low TT
concentrations was reported to have normal FT
and gonadotropin levels, normal male reproductive
development, and normal testes size and sper-
matogenesis, suggesting a limited role of SHBG in

 male sexual development and spermatogenesis
(26). Clinicians should measure FT in men who
have conditions that alter SHBG levels (Table 2)
(24). Conditions that lower SHBG [e.g., obesity,
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or androgen use]
can lower TT concentrations to below the normal
range, although FT concentrations might remain
within the normal range. Conditions that increase
SHBG (e.g., advanced age, some anticonvulsants,
or HIV infection) can raise TT concentrations to
well above 400 ng/dL and sometimes into the high-
normal range or even above the normal range, even
though FT concentrations might be low. Clinicians
should also measure FT in men whose serum TT
concentration is modestly above or below the lower
limit of normal (e.g., 200 to 400 ng/dL) (27). In men
whose TT concentrations are far below the lower
limit of the normal range (e.g., ,150 ng/dL), the
probability of FT concentration being within the
normal range is low. So, in such circumstance,
measuring FT is generally not necessary (27). Local
laboratories usually do not have accurate and re-
liable assays for FT measurement. Therefore, cli-
nicians should use a reliable reference laboratory
for these tests.
Clinicians should measure FT using the equilibrium
dialysis method performed under standardized condi-
tions. If equilibrium dialysis is not available for mea-
suring FT, clinicians should estimate FT concentrations
using a formula that accurately calculates FT concen-
trations using TT, SHBG, and albumin concentrations.
The estimates of FT, regardless of the formula used, are
predicated upon accurate measurements of TT, SHBG,
and albumin. Several different algorithms are available
for calculating FT concentrations based on the binding
characteristics of T to SHBG and albumin (28–30). Re-
cent studies using modern biophysical techniques suggest
that SHBG circulates as a dimer (24, 28) and that binding
of T to SHBG is a multistep process that involves an
allosteric interaction between the two binding sites on the
SHBG dimer, such that the affinities of the two sites are
not equivalent (28). Estimates of FT that use an allosteric
model provide close approximations of levels measured
using equilibrium dialysis. Further investigation is needed
to determine the preferred method for routinely esti-
mating FT concentrations in clinical populations (28). FT
measurements by direct tracer analog immunoassays are
frequently available in local and some reference labora-
tories, but these direct immunoassays are inaccurate and
should not be used (23, 24). Bioavailable T concentrations
are measured by ammonium sulfate precipitation or cal-
culated from TT, SHBG, and albumin levels (23, 24).
Measuring bioavailable T concentrations using ammonium
sulfate precipitation is technically challenging. Fur-
thermore, there are no detailed studies (similar to those
described previously that relate FT concentrations to
manifestations of T deficiency) that use bioavailable T
concentrations (24).
The reported reference ranges for TT and FT con-
centrations in healthy young men vary considerably
among laboratories and assays (31). A substantial
amount of the variation in reference ranges is due to the
lack of standardization of T assays, calibrator differences,
and differences in the reference populations used to
generate ranges. Recently, the Endocrine Society and
the Partnership for the Accurate Testing of Hormones
supported a project to develop a harmonized reference
range based on data from community-dwelling men from
four large cohorts in the United States and Europe. The
project cross-calibrated the assays used for each cohort
against a higher order method and calibrator developed
by the CDC and then harmonized the local values to the
CDC-standardized measurements (31). The harmonized
reference range for TT in healthy, nonobese young men
(aged 19 to 39 years) was 264 to 916 ng/dL (9.2 to
31.8 nmol/L) using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile, and
303 to 852 ng/dL (10.5 to 29.5 nmol/L) using the 5th and
95th percentile (31). Clinicians can use this range for all
CDC-certified TT assays.
A major difficulty in interpreting FT concentrations is
the lack of standardization regarding FT assays, resulting
in variability in the lower limit of the reference ranges
quoted by different laboratories. Given the uncertainties
in the methods of calculations and variations in reference
intervals, laboratories are encouraged to establish their
own specific reference ranges for FT measured by equi-
librium dialysis and calculated FT (preferably calibrated
against the equilibrium dialysis method).
Values and preferences
Our diagnostic strategy reflects our preference to
avoid labeling men as having hypogonadism and re-
quiring T therapy based on low T concentrations due to
transient medical disorders, biological variations in T
concentrations, technical variations and inaccuracy in T
measurements, or SHBG abnormalities. Our strategy also
reflects our preference to avoid treating men without
symptoms and signs of T deficiency or without un-
equivocally low T concentrations when the benefits and
risks of T therapy remain unclear.
Screening and case detection for hypogonadism
1.2 We recommend against routine screening of men
in the general population for hypogonadism.

 Technical remark
• Low T concentrations occur frequently without
symptoms or signs of testosterone deficiency, and
these low levels (alone) do not establish a diagnosis
of hypogonadism. Current case-finding instruments
for detecting testosterone deficiency lack sufficient
sensitivityandspecificity to be useful for screening men
who are receiving health care for unrelated reasons.
Evidence
Because of the lack of consensus on the extent to which
hypogonadism is an important public health problem, as
well as the lack of data on the performance characteristics
of candidate screening tools, we do not recommend
population screening. The impact of untreated T de-
ficiency on mortality is unclear, although several, but not
all, epidemiological studies have reported an association
of low T concentrations with higher all-cause mortality
(particularly mortality due to cardiovascular dis-
ease) (32).
The benefits and adverse consequences of long-term T
therapy on patient-important outcomes in asymptomatic
men with low T concentrations remain unclear. There-
fore, screening for hypogonadism does not fulfill the
necessary criteria to justify population-level screening
(33, 34). No clinical trials have assessed the effectiveness
of screening strategies.
Ideally, case detection should identify those patients
who seek medical attention for one or more medical
problems who are at increased risk of having hypo-
gonadism and likely to benefit from T therapy. Table 4
lists candidate groups that have a high prevalence of low
T concentrations and for whom we suggest measuring T
concentrations; these include men with low libido,
erectile dysfunction, infertility, HIV-associated weight
loss, osteoporosis or low-trauma fracture, a history of
AAS use, and men receiving opioids or other drugs or
substances that affect T production or metabolism (5, 6,
35–41).
There is limited information about the performance
properties of case-detection questionnaires that rely on
self-reports, namely Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males
(42), the Aging Males’ Symptoms Rating Scale (43), and
the Massachusetts Male Aging Study Questionnaire (44).
Two recent scales have been designed to assess hypo-
gonadism symptoms: the Hypogonadism Impact of
Symptoms Questionnaire (45) and the Sexual Arousal,
Interest, and Drive Scale (46). Although these new scales
are psychometrically more robust than previous in-
struments, clinical experience with them is limited. There
are no trials of case-detection strategies in the patient
populations described above. As such, the positive and
negative predictive value and the cost-effectiveness of the
use of case-finding questionnaires over measuring serum
T concentrations is unknown. Therefore, we suggest that
clinicians not use the available case-finding question-
naires for detecting T deficiency in men receiving health
care for unrelated reasons. We suggest that clinicians
consider using TT concentration measurements for case
detection in men with certain clinical disorders (Table 4)
in whom the prevalence of hypogonadism is high and T
treatment might be indicated.
Values and preferences
The recommendation not to routinely screen men in
the general population places a high value on avoiding
labeling, testing, treating, and monitoring healthy men
for whom the benefits and risks are unclear. This rec-
ommendation also places a high value on avoiding in-
terventions with unclear outcomes. It places a low value
on the potential benefits of early detection and treatment
of T deficiency in men who have not sought medical
attention.
Distinguishing between primary or
secondary hypogonadism
1.3 In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend
distinguishing between primary (testicular) and
secondary (pituitary-hypothalamic) hypogonad-
ism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone
(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
concentrations (Fig. 1). (1j���O)
Evidence
Measuring LH and FSH concentrations can help
distinguish between primary and secondary hypo-
gonadism (Fig. 1). Most clinical laboratories measure LH
and FSH levels using immunometric assays that have
sufficient sensitivity to distinguish between normal and
Table 4.

prevalence of Low T Concentrations and for Which
We Suggest Measurement of
Serum T Concentrations

of the sellar region

metabolism, such as opioids and glucocorticoids

 low levels. LH and FSH assays are susceptible to biotin
interference (47) that can cause falsely high or low values;
accordingly, clinicians should stop biotin supplements for
at least 72 hours before testing.
Values and preferences
This recommendation places high value on identifying
men with secondary hypogonadism who might have
disorders of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus that
require management in addition to T treatment.
Evaluation for determining the etiology
of hypogonadism
1.4 In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further
evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic,
pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction. (2j��OO)
Technical remark
• In men with secondary hypogonadism, clinicians
should perform serum prolactin and iron saturation
measurements, and in certain cases, pituitary func-
tion testing and magnetic resonance imaging of the
sella turcica to determine the cause of gonadotropin
deficiency.
• In men with primary hypogonadism of unknown
etiology, especially in those with testicular vol-
ume , 6 mL, clinicians should obtain a karyotype
to diagnose KS.
Evidence
In men deemed to have secondary hypogonadism,
additional diagnostic evaluations may be needed to ex-
clude hyperprolactinemia, head trauma, iron overload
syndromes, hypothalamic or pituitary tumors, and other
infiltrative or destructive hypothalamic–pituitary dis-
eases, as well as genetic disorders associated with go-
nadotropin deficiency. Measuring serum prolactin and
iron saturation and/or serum ferritin can help determine
the presence of hyperprolactinemia and iron overload
syndromes, respectively. Assessing anterior pituitary
function, if clinically indicated, can uncover other pitu-
itary hormone deficiencies. Clinicians can make a di-
agnosis of congenital (also referred to as idiopathic)
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism after excluding other
causes of secondary hypogonadism in men with pre-
pubertal or less commonly adult onset T deficiency. In
patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, phe-
notypic features—such as hyperphagia or extreme obe-
sity (e.g., Prader–Willi syndrome), polydactyly, syndactyly,
synkinesia,
anosmia,
kidney
abnormalities
(e.g.,
Kallmann syndrome), or short stature (e.g., contigu-
ous gene deletions of chromosome X)—can help
clinicians identify specific syndromes via pattern
recognition (48).
When evaluating middle-aged and older men with
secondary hypogonadism, the cost-effectiveness of pitu-
itary imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) to exclude
pituitary and/or hypothalamic disease is unknown.
Surveys of middle-aged and older men with secondary
hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction have revealed a
low prevalence of hypothalamic–pituitary abnormalities
(49). Clinicians can improve the diagnostic yield of pi-
tuitary imaging to exclude pituitary and/or hypothalamic
tumors by performing this procedure in men with pan-
hypopituitarism, persistent hyperprolactinemia, serum
TT , 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L) (49), or symptoms of tumor
mass effect (e.g., visual impairment, visual field defect, or
new onset headache).
Many men with secondary hypogonadism have po-
tentially reversible or treatable causes of gonadotropin
suppression and low T concentrations or functional
secondary hypogonadism [e.g., due to obesity, opioid
use, or comorbid illness (Table 1)] that may be managed
without need for testosterone treatment.
Karyotype can be useful in diagnosing KS (47 XXY), a
common identifiable cause of primary testicular failure,
characterized by infertility, gynecomastia, very small
testes (testicular volume , 6 mL; although men with
mosaic KS may have larger testes), and elevated go-
nadotropin levels. The karyotype obtained from pe-
ripheral blood lymphocytes may be normal (46 XY) in
some men with KS who have mosaicism (46 XY/47
XXY). Men with KS can benefit from genetic counsel-
ing and need surveillance for certain disorders, such as
breast cancer and autoimmune disorders, for which they
are at increased risk (50).
T directly stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone
resorption through multiple mechanisms that involve
estrogen receptor– and androgen receptor–mediated
processes (14, 41). Additionally, T may increase skeletal
muscle mass and strength, which may indirectly increase
BMD and potentially reduce fall propensity and fracture
risk; however, there are no randomized trials that assess
the effect of T on fall and fracture prevention. The cost-
effectiveness of measuring BMD and the frequency at
which it should be performed are not known.
If fertility is a concern to a patient and his partner,
clinicians should perform at least two semen analyses
separated by an interval of several weeks on semen
samples collected within 1 hour of ejaculation after at
least 48 hours of abstinence.
Values and preferences
Our recommended diagnostic strategy places a rela-
tively higher value on detecting potentially reversible

 functional or organic conditions (e.g., pituitary tumors or
other treatable pituitary disorders) for which effective
treatment or counseling is available. This strategy places a
relatively lower value on avoiding the burden and cost of
tests with unknown yield.
2. Treatment of Hypogonadism
With Testosterone
2.1 We recommend testosterone therapy in hypo-
gonadal men to induce and maintain secondary
sex characteristics and correct symptoms of tes-
tosterone deficiency. (1j���O)
Technical remark
• Clinicians can initiate testosterone therapy with any
of the therapeutic regimens described in Tables 5
and 6, based on the patient’s preference, consider-
ation of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden,
and cost.
• Clomiphene citrate has been used empirically in men
with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; however,
neither its efficacy nor its safety has been demon-
strated in randomized trials.
2.2 We recommend against testosterone therapy in
men planning fertility in the near term or in men
with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate
nodule or induration, a prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) level . 4 ng/mL, a PSA level . 3 ng/mL
combined with a high risk of prostate cancer
(without further urological evaluation), elevated
hematocrit, untreated severe OSA, severe lower
urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart fail-
ure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last
6 months, or thrombophilia (Table 7). (1j��OO)
Technical remark
• Men who have a prostate nodule or induration
require a urological evaluation. Clinicians should
not administer testosterone therapy to men with
baseline hematocrit above the upper limit of normal
for the laboratory without discussing the potential
for an increased risk of erythrocytosis and the need
to monitor hematocrit assiduously.
2.3 In hypogonadal men 55 to 69 years old, who are
being considered for testosterone therapy and
have a life expectancy . 10 years, we suggest
discussing the potential benefits and risks of
evaluating prostate cancer risk and prostate
monitoring and engaging the patient in shared
decision making regarding prostate cancer moni-
toring. For patients who choose monitoring, cli-
nicians should assess prostate cancer risk before
starting testosterone treatment and 3 to 12 months
after starting testosterone (2j�OOO). In hypo-
gonadal men being considered for testosterone
therapy who are 40 to 69 years old and at increased
risk of prostate cancer (e.g., African Americans and
men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed
prostate cancer), we suggest discussing prostate
cancer risk with the patient and offering monitoring
options. (2j�OOO)
Technical remark
• We suggest that clinicians offer evaluation of
prostate cancer risk beginning at age 40 in hypo-
gonadal men who are being considered for testos-
terone therapy and are at high risk of prostate cancer
(e.g., African Americans and men with a first-degree
relative with prostate cancer). In patients who agree
to prostate cancer monitoring, clinicians should
evaluate PSA levels and perform a digital prostate
examination at baseline and at 3 to 12 months after
starting testosterone treatment. After 1 year of
testosterone-replacement therapy, we suggest cli-
nicians follow the guidelines for prostate cancer
screening based on the age and race of the patient.
Evidence
Tables 5 and 6 summarize the clinical pharmacology
of T formulations. Patients can begin T therapy using any
of the suggested regimens based on their preference, the
pharmacokinetics of the formulation, the treatment
burden, and the cost (Table 6). Outside the United States,
oral T undecanoate and a matrix transdermal T patch are
available for clinical use in many countries; physicians
should follow the drug regimens approved in those
countries. See Tables 5 and 6 for additional safety and
pharmacokinetics information.
When the goal of treatment is to replace T, treating
men with prepubertal onset of hypogonadism is similar to
treating men with postpubertal onset hypogonadism,
although some practitioners and patients may elect to
start T treatment at a lower dosage initially and gradually
increase the dose over many months to avoid sexually
disturbing thoughts. In contrast, when the goal of
treatment is to induce or restore fertility, men with
prepubertal onset hypogonadism are more likely to re-
quire both FSH and LH (human chorionic gonadotropin
or recombinant LH) replacement, whereas men with
postpubertal onset hypogonadism are more likely to
require LH replacement only (51).

 Efficacy
Most studies of T therapy in young, hypogonadal
men were open label and did not include a placebo
group. The observations from these open-label studies
are consistent with the data from a small number of
randomized trials.
Secondary sexual characteristics. In men who have not
undergone complete pubertal development, T therapy
induces the development of secondary sex characteristics,
including facial and body hair growth, deepening of the
voice, muscle and bone accretion, penile enlargement,
and pigmentation of the scrotum (52).
Sexual function. The commissioned systematic review
and meta-analysis showed that T treatment in hypo-
gonadal men with low libido is associated with signifi-
cantly greater improvement in libido, erectile function,
and sexual activity vs placebo (53–55). T does not sig-
nificantly improve sexual function and activity in men
who do not have low T concentrations in the hypo-
gonadal range (56).
Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors can improve erectile
function in eugonadal (57) and hypogonadal men (58).
However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have
failed to demonstrate further improvements in erectile
function with the addition of T to an optimized regimen
of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (58, 59). T therapy does
not improve ejaculatory function in men with low T
concentrations and ejaculatory dysfunction (60).
Well-being and depressive symptoms. T therapy im-
proves the positive and reduces the negative aspects of
mood, but the magnitude of the effect of T on mood in
older men is small (61, 62). T therapy does not improve
depressive symptoms in men with clinical depression
(63). Epidemiological studies have reported an associa-
tion between lower T concentrations and late-onset, low-
grade, persistent depressive disorder (previously referred
to as dysthymia) (64, 65). There is limited evidence that T
improves depressive symptoms in middle-aged and el-
derly men with late-onset, low-grade, persistent de-
pressive disorder and low T concentrations (66, 67).
In the Testosterone Trials (TTrials) (which we describe
in greater detail later in this article), no statistically sig-
nificant improvement was observed in fatigue with T
treatment vs placebo (68); this was confirmed in the
commissioned systematic review and meta-analysis.
Bone mineral density. T therapy in healthy hypogonadal
men increases areal and volumetric vertebral and femoral
BMD and vertebral and femoral bone strength (69–71),
but there are no studies on the effects of T on fracture risk.
T is not an approved treatment for osteoporosis or for
reducing fracture risk. Clinicians should not prescribe T
for treating osteoporosis in men who have normal T
concentrations or as monotherapy to prevent bone
fracture in men who are at high risk of bone fracture,
regardless of T concentrations (clinicians can assess
fracture risk using a fracture risk assessment instrument,
such as FRAX®). In hypogonadal men receiving T re-
placement, clinicians should treat osteoporosis in patients
at high risk of bone fracture with a pharmacologic agent
that has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis
(72). In hypogonadal men who have osteoporosis, are not
at high risk of bone fracture, and are being started on
T-replacement therapy, clinicians may consider deferring
treatment with approved osteoporosis drugs until they
have evaluated the response to T replacement by re-
peating BMD tests of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and
hip after 1 to 2 years of T therapy.
Body composition, muscle strength, and physical function.
T therapy in healthy men with hypogonadism increases
fat-free mass (73, 74) and muscle strength (73, 75).
T administration reduces whole body, intraabdominal,
and intermuscular fat (75). The effects of T on muscle/fat
mass and muscle strength are related to the administered
dose and increase in circulating T concentrations (75–77).
Estrogen predominantly mediates the effects of T on body
fat (13, 78). In placebo-controlled trials in healthy and
mobility-limited older men, T therapy resulted in greater
gains in lean body mass (LBM), maximal voluntary
strength, muscle power, and some performance-based
measures of physical function vs placebo (79–83). How-
ever, these studies have not shown consistent improve-
ments in gait speed or measures of disability (68, 79–81).
Cognitive function. Two RCTs in community-dwelling
older men did not find significant improvements in
memory or multiple other domains of cognitive function
with T treatment (84, 85). There are no studies on the
effects of T on men with dementia or on the progression
from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.
Adverse events associated with
testosterone therapy
Randomized and open-label trials in young men with
hypogonadism report a low frequency of serious adverse
events with replacement doses of T (86–88). Common
drug-related adverse events include acne, oiliness of skin,
and breast tenderness (Table 8). The frequency of breast
enlargement, sleep apnea, and prostate events has been
low in trials of young men with hypogonadism. Eryth-
rocytosis is the most frequent adverse event reported in
RCTs of T. T therapy is associated with a significant but

 small decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels (87, 88). T therapy may increase the risk of serious
adverse effects in men with some conditions (Table 7); we
recommend against using T therapy in patients with these
disorders.
Erythrocytosis. T administration increases hemoglobin
and hematocrit (88, 89); these effects are related to T
doses and circulating concentrations (89). In some men
with hypogonadism, T therapy can cause erythrocytosis
(hematocrit . 54%). The increase in hematocrit during T
administration and the frequency of erythrocytosis is
higher in older men than in young men (87). The com-
missioned meta-analysis showed that T treatment was
associated with a significantly higher frequency of eryth-
rocytosis vs placebo. The hematocrit level at which the
risk of neuro-occlusive or cardiovascular events increases
is not known. The frequency of neuro-occlusive events in
men with hypogonadism enrolled in RCTs of T who
developed erythrocytosis has been very low.
Clinicians should evaluate men who develop eryth-
rocytosis during T-replacement therapy and withhold T
therapy until hematocrit has returned to the normal range
and then resume T therapy at a lower dose. Using
therapeutic phlebotomy to lower hematocrit is also ef-
fective in managing T treatment–induced erythrocytosis.
Cardiovascular. There have been no RCTs that were
large enough or long enough to determine the effects of
T-replacement therapy on major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE). Additionally, there is no conclusive
evidence that T supplementation is associated with in-
creased cardiovascular risk in hypogonadal men.
The relationship of endogenous T concentrations and
coronary artery disease in cross-sectional and prospective
cohort studies has been inconsistent (90). The relation-
ship between T concentrations and cardiovascular events
in prospective epidemiologic studies is also inconsistent
(91, 92). A small number of epidemiologic studies have
reported a negative relationship between T concentra-
tions and measures of subclinical atherosclerosis, such as
common carotid artery intima–media thickness (92, 93).
The relationship of T and mortality has been hetero-
geneous across studies (32). A meta-analysis by Araujo
et al. (32) associated lower T concentrations with higher
risk for all-cause mortality, especially cardiovascular
mortality. It is possible that T is a marker of health, and
those who are at higher risk of dying have lower T
concentrations. Epidemiological studies can only show
association but cannot prove causality, and we cannot
exclude reverse causality. Other studies suggest that men
with erectile dysfunction and low T may have an in-
creased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause
mortality, but we cannot infer a causal association (94).
There are no adequately powered RCTs on the effects
of T replacement on MACE. The few RCTs that have
reported cardiovascular events were limited by their small

 size, short intervention durations, variable quality of
adverse event reporting, and failure to prespecify and
adjudicate cardiovascular events (79–82, 84, 95). Ret-
rospective analyses of data using electronic medical re-
cords have also been inconclusive and are similarly
constrained by the lack of randomized allocation
and prospective adjudication of cardiovascular events,
confounding by indication, and heterogeneity of pa-
tient populations, T doses, and intervention durations
(96–101). A number of meta-analyses have examined the
association between T-replacement therapy and cardio-
vascular events, MACE, and death in RCTs (101, 102).
Many of these meta-analyses show point estimates . 1.
However, most meta-analyses have not shown a statis-
tically significant association between T treatment and
cardiovascular events, MACE, or deaths. The trials in-
cluded in these meta-analyses suffered from various
limitations, including heterogeneity of eligibility criteria,
dosing, formulations, and intervention durations; vari-
ability in the quality of adverse event recording; lack of
large trial cohorts; failure to prespecify and adjudicate
cardiovascular outcomes; and lack of a sufficient number
of MACE. Thus, there are insufficient data to establish a
causal link between T therapy and cardiovascular events.
In response to a citizen petition to add a “black box”
warning about the potential cardiovascular dangers of T,
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
conducted an extensive review and concluded “the
studies presented in the petition have significant limita-
tions that weaken their evidentiary value for confirming a
causal relationship between T and adverse cardiovascular
outcomes” (103). Nevertheless, the FDA mandated phar-
maceutical companies to add labeling information
about a possible increased risk of cardiovascular events
with the use of T. The European Medicines Agency
concluded that there is no consistent evidence of an in-
creased risk of coronary heart disease associated with T
therapy in hypogonadal men (104).
Venous thromboembolism. Case-control and pharmaco-
epidemiologic studies have not shown a consistent in-
crease in the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with

 T treatment (105, 106). However, there are too few
T-associated VTE events in RCTs to draw meaningful
inferences. Some case reports have suggested that the risk
for VTE may be increased in the presence of thrombo-
philia even without a raised hematocrit, especially within
the first 6 months after starting T therapy (105–107). The
FDA has required manufacturers to include a warning
about the risk of VTE for T products.
Prostate. The relationship between T administration and
the risk of prostate cancer remains poorly understood
(106). No RCT has been long enough or large enough to
have adequate statistical power to determine whether T
administration increases the risk of prostate cancer.
There is no strong evidence for the association be-
tween prostate cancer risk and T concentrations or
polymorphisms in genes that encode for proteins in-
volved in androgen action or metabolism (108–112).
Meta-analyses of prospective epidemiologic studies
found no significant association between T concentra-
tions and the risk of prostate cancer, but there are some
inconsistencies among studies (109, 112). However,
androgen receptor signaling plays a central role in the
biology of prostate cancer, T administration promotes the
growth of metastatic prostate cancer, and androgen ab-
lation can provide benefits for aggressive prostate cancer
(113, 114). Therefore, we recommend against T supple-
mentation in men with prostate cancer and suggest
assessing prostate cancer risk prior to treatment initiation.
Many older men harbor small foci of subclinical
cancer in their prostate (108); we do not know whether T
replacement might cause these subclinical cancers to
grow and become clinically overt.
T therapy increases the risk of detecting subclinical
prostate cancer because of increased surveillance and
T-induced increase in PSA levels, which may lead to
increased risk of prostate biopsy (108). Because of the
high prevalence of subclinical prostate cancer in older
men, more prostate biopsies in men receiving T therapy
would lead to the detection of a greater number of
subclinical prostate cancers. In a meta-analysis of
RCTs, a greater proportion of men randomized to T had
prostate biopsies than those assigned to placebo (88).
Prostate biopsy may be associated with adverse effects
such as pain, fever, bleeding, infection, transient urinary
difficulties, the psychological harm of false-positive test
results, and overdiagnosis (115). Prostate cancer treat-
ment can result in erectile dysfunction, urinary inconti-
nence, bowel dysfunction, and a small risk of premature
death. Because of the current inability to reliably dis-
tinguish tumors that will remain indolent from those
destined to be lethal, many men are being subjected to the
harms of treatment of prostate cancer that might never
become symptomatic. Longer term follow-up of the
participants of the European Randomized Study of
Screening for Prostate Cancer (116) found that PSA-
based screening for prostate cancer prevents one to
two men from dying of prostate cancer for every 1000
men screened, and that screening 1000 men 55 to
69 years of age may prevent approximately three men
from developing metastatic prostate cancer. Therefore, it
is important to establish a standardized monitoring
process and criteria for referring patients receiving T
treatment for possible prostate biopsies to minimize the
risks and expense of unnecessary testing.
Metastatic prostate cancer and breast cancer are
hormone-dependent cancers that
T treatment may
stimulate to grow (114); T should not be administered to
men with these cancers.
Although some clinicians have suggested considering
patients with a history of organ-confined prostate cancer
for T replacement on an individualized basis—if they
have undergone radical prostatectomy, have undetect-
able PSA, and no detectable residual disease 2 or more
years after surgery (117)—the lack of data from RCTs
precludes a general recommendation.
An important objective of the baseline evaluation in
men being considered for T-replacement therapy is to
identify and exclude those who have a history of prostate
cancer or are at high risk for developing prostate cancer.
As previously noted, screening and monitoring for
prostate cancer entails some risk. Most organizations that
provide guidelines for prostate cancer screening strongly
encourage informing the patient of the potential benefits
and risks and engaging him in shared decision making
regarding screening with PSA levels and digital rectal
examination (DRE) (118). Clinicians should consider
screening and monitoring for all men with hypogonadism
who are 55 to 69 years of age, being considered for
T-replacement therapy, and in excellent health, and who
have a life expectancy .10 years. This should start at age
40 in men who are at increased risk for high-grade
cancers, such as African Americans and men with a
first-degree male relative with diagnosed prostate cancer.
Men ,40 years do not need prostate monitoring because
the risk of prostate cancer is very low. The risk of death
due to prostate cancer in men diagnosed when they
are .70 years of age is not considered high enough to
warrant monitoring. The baseline assessment of prostate
cancer risk should consider risk factors, such as age,
family history (increased risk in men having a first-degree
relative with prostate cancer), race (increased risk in
African Americans), prior biopsy history, elevated PSA
levels, and positive prostate examination results. Clini-
cians can estimate the prostate cancer risk using the
prostate cancer risk calculator (119), which considers

 age, race, PSA levels, prostate examination results, family
history, use of a 5-a-reductase inhibitor, and prior biopsy
history. However, clinicians should only use the prostate
cancer risk calculator for men 55 to 95 years old; fur-
thermore, clinical experience with this tool is limited
(especially in men with hypogonadism) and criteria for
urological referral have not been established. The Pros-
tate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening
Trial found that abnormal PSA and suspicious DRE are
independently associated with clinically significant
prostate cancer and prostate cancer–specific mortality
(120). The predictive value of a suspicious DRE was
greater in men who had a PSA level . 3.0 ng/mL (121).
A prostate nodule or induration or a PSA . 4.0 ng/mL
may indicate a previously unrecognized prostate cancer. A
confirmed PSA . 4.0 ng/mL is a widely accepted in-
dication for urological evaluation for prostate cancer
(122, 123).
Lower urinary tract symptoms. T therapy does not
worsen lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men who
do not have severe LUTS prior to treatment (124, 125).
We do not know whether T worsens LUTS in men who
have severe LUTS at baseline, because such men have
been excluded from T trials.
Fertility. T therapy suppresses spermatogenesis and is not
appropriate
in
men
with
hypogonadotropic
hypo-
gonadism who desire fertility in the next 6 to 12 months.
Men who are not certain about future plans for con-
ceiving children may want to bank their sperm if they are
not azoospermic. Uncontrolled studies show that go-
nadotropin therapy can reinitiate spermatogenesis in men
with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who have been
treated previously with T-replacement therapy (126).
Not all hypogonadal men are necessarily infertile;
a semen analysis may be performed prior to initiating
treatment to determine whether contraception is needed.
Formulation-specific adverse effects of testosterone
therapy. Table 8 lists the adverse effects associated with
the use of specific T formulations.
Miscellaneous. T therapy can cause fluid retention and
edema (127) and potentially worsen edema associated
with heart failure or other edematous states. Although
OSA and sleep disorders are associated with increased
risk of low T concentrations, the frequency of OSA in
randomized T trials has been very low.
Values and preferences
The recommendation to offer T therapy to healthy
hypogonadal men places a higher value on alleviating
symptoms of T deficiency and achieving the other benefits
of T therapy and a lower value on avoiding the potential
burden of long-term treatment, monitoring, cost, and the
unclear long-term safety of T therapy.
Older men with age-related decline in
testosterone concentration
2.4 We suggest against routinely prescribing testos-
terone therapy to all men 65 years of age or older
with low testosterone concentrations (1j��OO).
In men . 65 years who have symptoms or con-
ditions suggestive of testosterone deficiency (such
as low libido or unexplained anemia) and con-
sistently and unequivocally low morning testos-
terone concentrations, we suggest that clinicians
offer testosterone therapy on an individualized
basis after explicit discussion of the potential risks
and benefits. (2j��OO)
Evidence
TT and FT concentrations fall with increasing age in
men (12, 91, 128). Because SHBG levels increase with
advancing age, the decline in FT concentrations with age
is greater than that in TT. The fall in T concentrations
with age is gradual, and varies in different individuals
with higher rates of decline in men with adiposity and
comorbid diseases (12, 128, 129).
TTrials in older men. Initial RCTs of T in older men were
characterized by relatively small sample sizes, inclusion of
healthy men without symptoms of T deficiency, low-
normal rather than frankly low T concentrations, and
variable elevations of T in treated men (79–82, 84, 95,
130). In these trials, T treatment consistently increased
LBM and vertebral BMD and decreased fat mass, but the
effects on muscle strength, physical function, femoral
bone density, sexual function, energy, and mood were
variable. Additionally, no RCT was of sufficient size to
evaluate risk.
The TTrials reported that T treatment of 1 year in
symptomatic men $65 years of age resulted in moderate
improvements in sexual function (sexual activity, sexual
desire, and erectile function), a small improvement in
walking distance, mood, and depressive symptoms, but
no improvements in vitality and cognitive function (68).
Also, a greater proportion of men who had anemia at
baseline and were assigned to the T arm had hemoglobin
increments . 1 g/dL compared with those in the placebo
arm (131). T administration was associated with sig-
nificantly greater increments in hemoglobin and PSA
levels vs placebo. T administration significantly increased
volumetric and areal BMD and the estimated strength of

 trabecular and peripheral bone in the spine as well as hip
(69). The increases were greater in trabecular bone than
peripheral bone and greater in the spine than the hip.
In another RCT, T treatment in men .60 years who
were not selected for sexual symptoms and who had
baseline T concentrations .300 ng/dL was not associated
with improvements in sexual function (56).
Adverse outcomes associated with testosterone therapy
in older men. The TTrials observed men for adverse
outcomes during the year of treatment and the year after
treatment (68). Only three men treated with T and one
treated with placebo were diagnosed with prostate cancer
during those 2 years. During the year of treatment, the
International Prostate Symptom Score increased to .19
(indicating moderately severe LUTS) in similar numbers
of men in the placebo and testosterone arms. Seven men
treated with T but none treated with placebo experienced
an increase in hemoglobin to $17.5 g/dL. Compared
with placebo, T treatment was associated with a signif-
icantly greater increase in coronary artery noncalcified
plaque volume, as measured by coronary computed to-
mographic angiography (132). Similar numbers of men in
both treatment groups experienced MACE during the
year of treatment or the subsequent year of observation.
Although the differences between the two treatment arms
with regard to prostate and cardiovascular adverse
outcomes were not statistically significant, the number of
participants and the treatment duration in the TTrials
were not sufficient to draw conclusions about the effect of
T on these adverse outcomes. Another RCT in men $ 60
years old reported that the rate of subclinical athero-
sclerosis progression, assessed using common carotid
artery intima–media thickness and multidetector com-
puterized tomography, did not differ between T- and
placebo-treated men (56).
Values and preferences
The recommendation not to treat asymptomatic older
men with age-related declines in T concentration places a
higher value on avoiding unknown long-term risks and a
lower value on the limited evidence of the potential
benefits of T therapy.
Physicians should recognize that there is considerable
disagreement among experts on this issue due to in-
complete evidence. Nonspecific age-related symptoms and
low T concentrations often coexist in older men without a
clear causal link. Although good evidence suggests that T
treatment in older men with low T improves sexual
function, anemia, vertebral and femoral BMD, and
possibly walking distance, the risks of this treatment are
unknown. Furthermore, we still do not know the long-
term efficacy of T in improving patient-important
outcomes, such as disability, falls, fractures, low-grade
progressive depressive disorder, and progression to di-
abetes or dementia.
Patients with chronic illness and low
testosterone concentrations
Many chronic disorders are associated with an in-
creased risk of low T concentrations, sexual symptoms,
weight loss, muscle atrophy, anemia, and/or osteopo-
rosis. However, the paucity of RCT data on the efficacy
or safety of T therapy in these conditions precludes a
general recommendation for T therapy in patients with
chronic illnesses. Clinicians must individualize the de-
cision to treat or not to treat these men with T based on
careful consideration of the severity of symptoms, the
degree of T deficiency, confounding influence of the
comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty
of the risks and benefits of T therapy.
HIV-infected men with weight loss
2.5 We suggest that clinicians consider short-term
testosterone therapy in HIV-infected men with
low testosterone concentrations and weight loss
(when other causes of weight loss have been ex-
cluded) to induce and maintain body weight and
lean mass gain. (2j��OO)
Technical remark
• Diagnostic and treatment recommendations are the
same as for patients with classical testosterone de-
ficiency. Additionally, clinicians should provide
appropriate counseling for safe sex practices.
Evidence
There is a high prevalence of low T concentrations in
HIV-infected men (40, 133, 134). Twenty to 25% of
HIV-infected men on highly active antiretroviral therapy
have low TT or FT concentrations (134). Low T con-
centrations in HIV-infected men are associated with
multimorbidity, HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions,
progression to AIDS, frailty, weight loss, wasting, de-
pression, and loss of muscle mass and exercise capacity
(40, 133, 134).
In a systematic review of RCTs of T therapy in HIV-
infected patients with weight loss (135), 3 to 6 months of
T therapy was associated with greater gains in body
weight (+1.54 kg; 95% CI, 0.03, 3.10) and LBM
(+1.22 kg; 95% CI, 0.2, 2.2) vs placebo. The differences
in LBM between placebo and T groups were greater in
trials that used T esters (+3.34 kg). A Cochrane review
also found greater weight and LBM gains in men assigned
to androgens than in those assigned to placebo arms of

 RCTs (136). T administration has also been associated
with improvements in maximal voluntary strength (137,
138). There are no data on the effects of T on physical
function, risk of disability, or long-term safety. In another
systematic review of RCTs, T therapy had a moderate
effect on depression (20.6 SD units; 95% CI, 21.0, 20.2)
(138, 139). There were no significant T effects on quality
of life. Considerable heterogeneity across trials, varying
degrees of weight loss and disease severity, variable T
regimens and treatment durations, and imprecision all
limited the strength of inferences.
The adverse event rates did not differ significantly
between placebo and T groups. Changes in CD4+
T lymphocyte counts, HIV viral load, PSA, and plasma
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not signifi-
cantly different between groups.
Overall, short-term (3 to 6 months) T use in HIV-
infected men with low T concentrations and weight loss
can lead to small gains in body weight, LBM, and mood,
with minimal change in quality of life.
Values and preferences
The suggestion to offer short-term T therapy to HIV-
infected men with low T concentrations and weight loss
places a higher value on reversing weight loss and gaining
LBM and muscle strength and a lower value on the lack of
RCT evidence on the long-term safety of T therapy and
the efficacy of T in improving physical function, dis-
ability, fracture risk, and other health outcomes. Al-
though the evidence of benefit is limited to 6 months of
therapy, shared decision making is needed regarding
continuation of therapy beyond 6 months.
Men with type 2 diabetes mellitus
2.6 In men with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have low
testosterone
concentrations,
we
recommend
against testosterone therapy as a means of im-
proving glycemic control. (1j��OO)
Technical remark
• Testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men who have
T2DM should follow the same treatment and
monitoring plan as hypogonadal men without
T2DM.
Evidence
T2DM is associated with a high prevalence of low T
concentrations. In cross-sectional studies of men with
T2DM (140, 141), about one-third have low T con-
centrations, and TT concentrations were, on average,
86 ng/dL lower in men with T2DM vs controls (141). In
epidemiological studies, TT concentrations are negatively
associated with the risk of T2DM. The association of
SHBG and TT with the risk of T2DM is stronger than for
FT concentrations. Interventional studies designed to
address whether low T concentrations contribute to the
development of diabetes by modulating insulin resistance
have yielded conflicting results. Some studies have
demonstrated a favorable effect of T on insulin sensitivity
in men with T2DM (142–144), whereas others showed
no benefit (145, 146). Trials of the effects of T on gly-
cemic control have also yielded variable results; some
show no improvement in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c),
whereas others show a decrease. The discrepancy be-
tween studies likely reflects small sample size, differences
in baseline HbA1c levels, degrees of insulin resistance,
and the extent to which oral hypoglycemic agents were
controlled during the study. A meta-analysis of RCTs of
men with T2DM and/or the metabolic syndrome found
no evidence of an improvement in HbA1c (141).
Values and preferences
The suggestion not to treat asymptomatic men with
T2DM places a lower value on the unproven potential
benefits of T therapy with regard to glycemic control
and a higher value on avoiding the burdens of T ad-
ministration, monitoring, and cost, as well as the un-
known long-term risks of T therapy.
3. Monitoring of Testosterone-
Replacement Therapy
3.1 In hypogonadal men who have started testoster-
one therapy, we recommend evaluating the pa-
tient after treatment initiation to assess whether
the patient has responded to treatment, is suf-
fering any adverse effects, and is complying with
the treatment regimen. (Ungraded Good Practice
Statement)
Technical remark
• Clinicians
should
maintain
serum
testosterone
concentrations during treatment in the mid-normal
range for healthy young men (Table 9).
• Clinicians should evaluate symptoms and signs of
testosterone
deficiency and formulation-specific
adverse events at each visit (see Table 9).
• Monitoring includes measuring testosterone and
hematocrit at 3 to 6 months (depending upon the
formulation) and measuring testosterone and he-
matocrit at 12 months and annually after initiating
testosterone therapy.
• For those who choose prostate monitoring, moni-
toring should include PSA and DRE 3 to 12 months

 after treatment initiation. After 1 year, prostate
monitoring should conform to guidelines for pros-
tate cancer screening, depending on the race and age
of the patient.
3.2 We recommend a urological consultation for
hypogonadal men receiving testosterone treat-
ment if during the first 12 months of testosterone
treatment there is a confirmed increase in PSA
concentration . 1.4 ng/mL above baseline, a
confirmed PSA . 4.0 ng/mL, or a prostatic ab-
normality detected on digital rectal examination.
After 1 year, prostate monitoring should con-
form to standard guidelines for prostate cancer
screening based on the race and age of the pa-
tient. (2j��OO)
Technical remark
• Clinicians should confirm PSA elevations by re-
peating the test to exclude the possibility of transient
rises (e.g., due to prostatitis or assay variability).
• In hypogonadal men whose baseline PSA is between
2.6 and 4 ng/mL, an increase .4 ng/mL during
testosterone treatment could be due to test–retest
variability and/or the testosterone-induced increase
in PSA; therefore, in such men, the decision to refer
the patient for urological evaluation should be
guided by a confirmed increase of .1.4 ng/mL in
PSA concentration above baseline as well as the
absolute PSA level of .4 ng/mL.
Evidence
There is considerable variation in T concentrations in
hypogonadal men who are receiving T therapy (8, 147);
this variation is even greater in hypogonadal men being
treated with transdermal gels or with oral T undeca-
noate. Subtherapeutic T concentrations may contribute
to poor efficacy and high treatment discontinuation
rates. Furthermore, a small fraction of hypogonadal
men develop supraphysiologic T concentrations with
intramuscular T and may be susceptible to dose-related
adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to measure T
concentrations in the patient group once a steady-state
has been achieved. The pharmacokinetics of the T
formulation should guide the timing of therapeutic level
monitoring, as shown in Table 9. Multiple dose titra-
tions are usually necessary to maintain T concentrations
in the therapeutic range in hypogonadal men who are
receiving T therapy.
T administration in hypogonadal men is associated
with a dose-dependent increase in hemoglobin concen-
trations (88); the increase in hemoglobin is greater in
older men than in young hypogonadal men (89). Baseline
hematocrit . 48% and . 50% for men living at higher
altitudes is a relative contraindication to T therapy be-
cause these men are more likely to develop a hematocrit
Table 9.
Monitoring Men Receiving T Therapy
Explain the potential benefits and risks of monitoring for prostate
cancer and engage the patient in shared decision making
regarding the prostate monitoring plan.
Evaluate the patient at 3–12 mo after treatment initiation and
then annually to assess whether symptoms have
responded to treatment and whether the patient is
suffering from any adverse effects
Monitor T concentrations 3–6 mo after initiation of T therapy:
Therapy should aim to raise serum T concentrations into the
mid-normal range.
Injectable T enanthate or cypionate: measure serum T
concentrations midway between injections. If mid-
interval T is .600 ng/dL (24.5 nmol/L) or ,350 ng/dL
(14.1 nmol/L), adjust dose or frequency.
Transdermal gels: assess T concentrations 2–8 h following
the gel application, after the patient has been on
treatment for at least 1 wk; adjust dose to achieve serum
T concentrations in the mid-normal range.
Transdermal patches: assess T concentrations 3–12 h after
application; adjust dose to achieve T concentration in the
mid-normal range.
Buccal T bioadhesive tablet: assess concentrations
immediately before or after application of fresh system.
T pellets: measure T concentrations at the end of the dosing
interval. Adjust the number of pellets and/or the dosing
interval to maintain serum T concentrations in the mid-
normal range.
Oral T undecanoatea: monitor serum T concentrations 3–5 h
after ingestion with a fat-containing meal.
Injectable T undecanoate: measure serum T levels at the end
of the dosing interval just prior to the next injection and
aim to achieve nadir levels in low-mid range.
Check hematocrit at baseline, 3–6 mo after starting treatment,
and then annually. If hematocrit is .54%, stop therapy
until hematocrit decreases to a safe level; evaluate the
patient for hypoxia and sleep apnea; reinitiate therapy
with a reduced dose.
Measure BMD of lumbar spine and/or femoral neck after 1–2 y of
T therapy in hypogonadal men with osteoporosis,
consistent with regional standard of care.
For men 55–69 years of age and for men 40–69 years of age who
are at increased risk for prostate cancer who choose
prostate monitoring, perform digital rectal examination
and check PSA level before initiating treatment; check
PSA and perform digital rectal examination 3–12 mo after
initiating T treatment, and then in accordance with
guidelines for prostate cancer screening depending on
the age and race of the patient.
Obtain urological consultation if there is:
An increase in serum PSA concentration .1.4 ng/mL within 12
mo of initiating T treatment
A confirmed PSA . 4 ng/mL at any time
Detection of a prostatic abnormality on DRE
Substantial worsening of LUTS
Evaluate formulation-specific adverse effects at each visit as per

 . 54% when treated with T. Men with elevated he-
matocrit should undergo further evaluation before con-
sidering T therapy. Clinicians should measure hematocrit
at baseline, 3 to 6 months, and then annually after a
patient begins T therapy.
As discussed earlier, T therapy increases the risk of
detection of subclinical prostate disease due to increased
surveillance and T-induced increases in PSA concentra-
tions, which may lead to increased risk of prostate biopsy.
Some men may develop a new prostate cancer unrelated
to T treatment. It is also possible that T administration
may cause subclinical prostate cancers (which may have
been present before but were undetected) to grow during
T administration and become clinically overt. An im-
portant goal of the monitoring plan is to detect those who
develop a prostate cancer during T treatment (regardless
of its relationship to T treatment) to evaluate those at
increased risk of having a prostate cancer and to minimize
the risk of unnecessary prostate biopsy in those who are
not at increased risk of prostate cancer.
T-replacement therapy increases PSA concentrations
in hypogonadal men. In a systematic review, the average
PSA increase after initiating T therapy was 0.3 ng/mL in
young hypogonadal men and 0.44 ng/mL in older men
(108). The 90% confidence limit was 1.4 ng/mL for the
change in PSA concentrations between two PSA tests
performed 3 to 6 months apart in men with benign
prostatic hyperplasia (148). Increases in PSA concen-
trations . 1.4 ng/mL during 3 to 6 months after T
therapy in hypogonadal men are unusual (148). In the
TTrials, PSA increases . 1.4 ng/mL occurred in 2.4% of
men at 3 months and 4.7% of men at 12 months in the T
group and 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively, in the placebo
group (68). A confirmed PSA . 4.0 ng/mL is a widely
accepted indication for urological evaluation for prostate
cancer (122, 123).
Because of the T-induced increase in PSA and the
test–retest
variability
of
PSA
measurements,
some
hypogonadal men with baseline PSA between 2.6 and
4.0 ng/mL will develop PSA concentrations . 4.0 ng/mL
after initiating T treatment. Therefore, in hypogonadal
men treated with T whose baseline PSA was between 2.6 and
4 ng/mL, we suggest clinicians consider both a confirmed
increase of .1.4 ng/mL in PSA concentration above
baseline and the absolute PSA level when deciding to refer
the patient for further urological evaluation. Transient
PSA elevations are common and may be due to test–retest
variability (149) or other disorders, such as prostatitis,
benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate trauma, urinary
tract infections, or assay variability. If PSA elevation is
due to prostatitis, appropriate antibiotic treatment may
lower PSA level (150). Therefore, clinicians should
confirm PSA elevations by repeating the test.
Similarly, the detection of a prostate nodule or an
induration may indicate an unrecognized cancer. Based
on these considerations, we recommend that clinicians
obtain a urological consultation if a prostatic abnor-
mality is detected on DRE.
Because of the considerable controversy over prostate
cancer screening and monitoring, clinicians should dis-
cuss the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening
and monitoring and engage the patient in shared decision
making prior to starting T treatment (115, 118).
In men with osteoporosis who are not considered to be
at high risk for fracture, clinicians should repeat BMD
measurements 1 to 2 years after initiating T therapy to
determine the response to T and to ascertain whether the
patient needs additional therapy with an approved
osteoporosis drug.
Other syndromes associated with hypogonadism
in men
AAS withdrawal hypogonadism
AAS use suppresses the hypothalamic–pituitary–
testicular axis in men. AAS withdrawal after an extended
period of high-dose AAS use is associated with marked
suppression of endogenous T concentrations and severe
symptoms of AAS withdrawal hypogonadism, includ-
ing sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depressed mood, and
sometimes clinical depression and even suicidality (151).
The recovery of endogenous T may vary depending on the
dose and duration of AAS use. After prolonged use of
highly supraphysiologic doses of AAS, the recovery of the
hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis may take months
and even years and may be incomplete. A small minority
of these men may never recover normal endogenous T
production and require T-replacement therapy (38). In
some men’s health clinics, a substantial fraction of young
men receiving T prescriptions have a history of prior AAS
use (37, 39). The distressing symptoms of AAS with-
drawal hypogonadism may lead some AAS users to re-
lapse into recurrent AAS abuse resulting in a vicious cycle
of AAS dependence (38).
Hypogonadism associated with chronic opioid use
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is common in men
receiving chronic enteral, parenteral, or intrathecal opioid
medications for pain management (152). Nearly all opi-
oids in doses equivalent to 30 mg of methadone sup-
press endogenous T production, although longer acting
opioids induce greater and more sustained suppression
of T concentrations. Men receiving methadone main-
tenance therapy are at high risk of developing opioid-
induced hypogonadism, whereas the prevalence of
opioid-induced hypogonadism is substantially lower
with
buprenorphine.

 consequences of chronic opioid use are not completely
understood, opioid-induced suppression of the endoge-
nous hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis is associated
with sexual dysfunction, low mood, osteoporosis, and
increased risk of fracture (152–154). Chronic opioid use
has emerged as a common antecedent of T prescription
use in some health care systems (155).
Only limited clinical trials data are available on the
benefits of T therapy in men with opioid-induced
hypogonadism (156). In one RCT in men with opioid-
induced T deficiency, T administration improved pain
sensitivity, sexual desire, body composition, and some
aspects of quality of life (156). Clinicians should consider
T-replacement therapy in men with opioid-induced
hypogonadism who are experiencing sexual symptoms
and in whom discontinuation of opioid medication
seems unlikely.
