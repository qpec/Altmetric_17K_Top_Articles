Purpose
To evaluate the impact of breast cancer family history and maternal BRCA1/2 mutation on the
psychosocial adjustment and perceived risk in girls age 11 to 19 years old.
Materials and Methods
Girls age 11 to 19 years old with one or more relatives with breast cancer or a familial BRCA1/2
mutation (breast cancer family history [BCFH] positive, n = 208; n = 69 with BRCA1/2-positive
mother), peers (BCFH negative, n = 112), and their mothers completed assessments of psycho-
social adjustment, breast cancer–specific distress, and perceived risk of breast cancer.
Results
General psychosocial adjustment did not differ significantly between BCFH-positive and BCFH-negative
girls, either by self-report or mother report, except for higher self-esteem among BCFH-positive
girls (P = .01). BCFH-positive girls had higher breast cancer–specific distress than BCFH-negative girls
(P , .001), but girls from BRCA1/2-positive families did not differ from other BCFH-positive peers. BCFH-
positive girls were more likely to report themselves at increased self-risk for breast cancer in adulthood
than BCFH-negative peers (74% v 33%, respectively; P # .001). Girls from BRCA1/2-positive families
were more likely than other BCFH-positive and BCFH-negative peers to report themselves at increased
risk (P , .001). In all groups, perceived risk of breast cancer was associated with older age. Higher breast
cancer–specific distress among adolescent girls was associated with higher self-perceived risk of breast
cancer and higher maternal breast cancer–specific distress.
Conclusion
Adolescent girls from BRCA1/2-positive and breast cancer families have higher self-esteem and do
not have poorer psychosocial adjustment than peers. However, they do experience greater breast
cancer–specific distress and perceived risk of breast cancer, particularly among older girls. Un-
derstanding the impact is important to optimize responses to growing up in families at familial and
genetic risk for breast cancer, particularly given the debate over the genetic testing of children for
cancer susceptibility in adulthood.

INTRODUCTION
Although BRCA1/2 testing is not recommended
during childhood,1,2 there is increasing evidence
to suggest that adolescence is a key period of
carcinogenic vulnerability3 and that childhood
exposures are associated with breast cancer
risk.3-10 Most parents discuss genetic and famil-
ial risk with their adolescent children, and some
parents and adolescent providers believe genetic
testing should be permitted in adolescence.11-15
Additionally, there are new guidelines recom-
mending return of incidental genomic findings
(including BRCA1/2 mutations) regardless of
age.16 Understanding the psychosocial impact on
adolescents growing up in families at familial or
genetic risk for breast cancer is critical to ensuring
healthy adaptation of youth and the development
of genetic testing policies and cancer prevention
messaging.

 preadolescent 10- to 13-year-old girls identified themselves as at
increased risk for breast cancer and had higher breast cancer–
specific distress than peers.17 Further, we found that mothers’
psychosocial adjustment is associated with their daughters’ psy-
chosocial adjustment, regardless of maternal breast cancer. This
study also identified better psychosocial adjustment in pre-
adolescent daughters from BRCA1/2 families as compared with
their peers, although the number of girls from BRCA1/2 families
was small. Psychosocial adjustment in adolescent girls from breast
cancer families remains unknown. Studies in adolescents when
a parent has cancer have found increased internalizing and ex-
ternalizing problems18-20 and distress,21-24 but these outcomes
have not been evaluated in BRCA1/2 families and those with
a family history when a parent does not have cancer. Two small
studies have found that the majority of adolescent girls from breast
cancer families perceive themselves to be at increased risk for breast
cancer in adulthood, suggesting the potential for increased
awareness of breast cancer risk as girls progress through
adolescence,23,25 but the impact of this awareness on psychosocial
adjustment remains unknown.
In this study, we first aimed to determine whether girls across
adolescence (11 to 19 years old) from breast cancer families differ
from their peers in psychosocial adjustment, breast cancer–specific
distress, and perceived risk of breast cancer. Second, we aimed to
determine whether girls from BRCA1/2-positive families experi-
ence different outcomes from peers. Third, we evaluated how
family and personal factors impact adolescent outcomes to inform
potential interventions to optimize adjustment to awareness of
breast cancer risk in adolescent girls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedures
We recruited 320 girls age 11 to 19 years old and their biologic
mothers from families with (breast cancer family history [BCFH] positive)
and without (BCFH negative) breast cancer. BCFH-positive girls included
those with one or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer
or a mother with a BRCA1/2 mutation. BCFH-negative girls had no known
family history of breast cancer in first- or second-degree relatives and no
known BRCA1/2 mutation in the mother. Girls were classified on the
basis of mother-reported family history and BRCA1/2 status, given our
intent to evaluate the impact of maternal adjustment on daughter
outcomes. Girls were recruited from clinical cancer genetics programs at
the University of Pennsylvania and Fox Chase Cancer Center (Phila-
delphia, PA); a national nonprofit awareness group (Facing Our Risk of
Cancer Empowered); local pediatric practices, including Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia’s Pediatric Research Consortium (Philadelphia,
PA); community advertisements; and friend nomination by mothers
(Table 1). Institutional review board approval was obtained at each site.
Mothers provided written informed consent and permission for
daughter participation, and girls provided assent (, 18 years old) or
consent ($ 18 years old).
Measures
We used a novel conceptual model26 grounded in the Self-Regulation
Theory of Health Behavior27 and developmental theory,28,29 previously
described in related research,17 to inform our outcomes and measures. Our
model posits that response to a health threat, including psychosocial ad-
justment and the performance of health and risk behaviors, is a prod-
uct of one’s perceptions of the threat (eg, perceived risk, etiology,
controllability).26,27,30 This model is ideal for the study of youths during
maturation because it emphasizes common-sense representations, encom-
passes sociocultural factors, and is iterative and dynamic, providing a unique
opportunity to examine changes throughout development.30 Girls and
mothers independently completed surveys, either online (98%) or by phone.
Daughter general psychosocial adjustment reported by mothers and self-
reported by girls was assessed with the Behavioral Assessment System for
Children (BASC-2).31 Assessments not meeting validity checks were excluded
from analysis. Daughter breast cancer–specific distress was evaluated with the
eight-item Child Impact of Events Scale (Cronbach’s a = .83 to .90), a de-
velopmentally appropriate version of the Revised Impact of Event Scale32-35
used to evaluate intrusive and avoidant thoughts regarding breast cancer.36-38
Daughter perception of breast cancer risk was assessed with a single
item adapted from a longitudinal study of families at hereditary risk for
breast cancer.30,39 Girls were asked, “Do you think your chances of getting
breast cancer when you are an adult are the same or different than other girls
your age when they become adults?” Response choices ranged, on a 5-point
Likert-type scale, from much higher (5 points) to much lower (1 point).
General family function and communication was reported by girls
using the general function and communication subscales of the McMaster
Family Assessment Device (Cronbach’s a = .78 to .88).40,41 Maternal
psychosocial adjustment and perceived risk were assessed using the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Cronbach’s a = .78 to .85),42,43
eight items of the Revised Impact of Event Scale (Cronbach’s a = .88),32-38
and a parallel 5-point Likert-type scale comparing their lifetime risk for
breast cancer to that of other women their age.
Demographic, Health, and Family History Information and
Breast Cancer Experiences
Mothers provided demographic information. Mothers and daughters
independently reported family history, including whether any first- or
second-degree relatives of the daughter had cancer and the type of cancer.
Mothers reported their BRCA1/2 status. Daughters were asked how many
individuals they knew with breast cancer, including both relatives and in-
dividuals outside their family who had breast cancer (eg, friends’ parents,
neighbors, teachers, coaches) to assess total breast cancer acquaintances.
They were also asked whether they were aware of BRCA1/2 genes in general
and if they knew anyone who had had BRCA1/2 testing.
Statistical Analyses
In primary analyses informed by our theoretical model, we compared
general psychosocial adjustment, breast cancer-specific distress, perception
of breast cancer risk, and knowledge of breast cancer genes between
BCFH-positive and BCFH-negative girls. In secondary analyses, we
evaluated differences between the following three groups: girls with
a BRCA1/2-positive mother, BCFH-positive girls with a mother who is
BRCA1/2 negative or untested (ie, BRCA1/2 negative/unknown), and
BCFH-negative girls. We also evaluated outcomes among daughters with
BRCA1/2-positive mothers on the basis of their reported knowledge of
their mother’s testing. We used linear or logistic regressions to investigate
whether general psychosocial adjustment, breast cancer–specific distress,
and perceptions of breast cancer risk differed by family history group in the
two-group and three-group comparisons. To account for families with
more than one daughter, we used robust standard errors that accounted for
within-family correlation.44 We used interaction terms in the models to
test for age (as a continuous variable) by risk group interactions. Statistical
significance was considered as P , .05 (two-sided). Analyses were con-
ducted using STATA versions 12 and 13 (Statacorp, College Station, TX).
We designed the study with 80% power to detect differences using simple
linear regressions for standardized effect sizes of 0.28, anticipating
imbalanced access to each group and assuming 150 BCFH-negative girls
and 300 BCFH-positive girls. Our final sample size (112 BCFH-negative
and 208 BCFH-positive girls) gave us power to detect standardized
differences between the groups of 0.33, which were still modest-sized
associations.

 RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
We screened 288 families; 263 mothers had eligible girls and
consented for their own and their daughter’s participation. Among
335 eligible girls, 320 girls (96%) from 247 families were enrolled
and completed surveys. Two hundred eight girls were classified as
BCFH positive, of whom 69 had a BRCA1/2-positive mother.
Characteristics of mothers and daughters are listed in Table 1. Girls
with a BRCA1/2-positive mother were younger than girls with
mothers who were BRCA1/2 negative or unknown (age, 14.9 v 15.7
years, respectively; P = .03). There were no other significant dif-
ferences between groups. All girls accurately reported their mother’s
history of breast cancer, and 55% of girls with a BRCA1/2-positive
mother reported knowledge of their mother’s BRCA1/2 testing.

Psychosocial Adjustment and Perceived Risk Among Adolescent Girls
 Mother self-reported general anxiety and depression scores
did not differ significantly between groups, but BCFH-positive
mothers reported significantly higher breast cancer–specific dis-
tress than BCFH-negative mothers (Table 1), and more BRCA1/2-
positive mothers met criteria for clinically significant distress
compared with BRCA1/2-negative/unknown mothers (25% v 12%,
respectively; P = .043). BRCA1/2-positive mothers reported lower
perceived risk for breast cancer; many had undergone prophylactic
surgery (65% mastectomy; 81% oophorectomy).
Differences in Girls’ General Psychosocial Adjustment
and Breast Cancer–Specific Distress
Mother-reported internalizing and externalizing scores did
not differ significantly between BCFH-positive and BCFH-negative
girls. Internalizing composite scores reported by girls did not
differ between groups (Table 2). In secondary analyses evaluating
BASC-2 subscales, BCFH-positive girls reported higher self-esteem
than BCFH-negative peers (Table 2). BCFH-positive girls reported
higher breast cancer–specific distress compared with peers, and
significantly more BCFH-positive than BCFH-negative girls (11%
v 1%, respectively) met criteria for clinically significant breast
cancer–specific distress (Table 2). These findings did not differ in
similar analyses by daughter-reported family history. Among the
subset of 69 girls with BRCA1/2-positive mothers, those who
reported knowledge of their mother’s testing did not experience
significantly different BASC-2 or breast cancer–specific distress
scores compared with those who did not report knowledge of their
mother’s genetic testing.
We conducted exploratory cross-sectional analyses by age to
evaluate how select outcomes may differ by age, BCFH group, and
mother BRCA1/2 status. The data suggest the potential for dif-
ferences in general anxiety between BCFH groups by age (Fig 1A;
P for age 3 BCFH status interaction = .009). There were no sig-
nificant differences in associations of age with self-esteem, depression,
or breast cancer–specific distress.
Differences in Perceived Risk of Breast Cancer and
Awareness of Breast Cancer Genes
BCFH-positive girls had 5.7 greater odds (95% CI, 3.4 to 9.6)
of reporting themselves at increased lifetime risk for breast cancer
than BCFH-negative peers. Girls with a BRCA1/2-positive mother
had 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.0) and 9.4 (95% CI, 4.6 to 19.1) greater
odds of reporting themselves at increased lifetime risk for breast
cancer compared with girls of a BRCA1/2-negative/unknown
mother and BCFH-negative peers, respectively (Table 2). Girls of
BRCA1/2-positive mothers also had 6.1 (95% CI, 3.0 to 12.4) and
17.5 (95% CI, 7.1 to 42.8) greater odds of reporting knowledge of
BRCA1/2 genes in general compared with those with a BRCA1/2-
negative/unknown mother and BCFH-negative peers, respectively.
Among the subset of girls with a BRCA1/2-positive mother, 92% of

 those who reported knowledge of the mother’s testing reported
themselves at greater lifetime risk for breast cancer, compared with
69% of those who did not report knowledge of the mother’s genetic
testing. Perceived risk of breast cancer was significantly associated
with older age among all groups and was generally higher among
BCFH-positive girls compared with BCFH-negative peers (Fig 1B;
the interaction between age and BCFH status was not statistically
significant, P . .2).
Factors Associated With Girls’ Psychosocial
Adjustment, Breast Cancer–Specific Distress, and
Perceived Risk
We conducted multivariable analyses to evaluate whether
factors suggested by our theoretical model (eg, family history,
maternal adjustment and distress, and family and girl factors) were
associated with daughter outcomes. Higher general anxiety in girls
was associated with higher mother anxiety and poorer family
communication (Table 3). Higher self-esteem in girls was asso-
ciated with lower mother anxiety and better family communica-
tion, more relatives with breast cancer, higher mother breast
cancer–specific distress, and fewer breast cancer acquaintances
reported by girls. Higher breast cancer–specific distress in girls was
significantly associated only with higher mother breast cancer–
specific distress and girls’ perceived risk (Table 3). Higher perceived
risk for breast cancer among girls was significantly associated with
older age, more first- and second-degree relatives with breast
cancer, maternal breast cancer, maternal BRCA1/2 mutation,
daughter knowledge of mom’s genetic testing, and maternal de-
pression (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
family history of breast cancer or a familial BRCA1/2 mutation on
adolescent girls. Similar to the LEGACY Girls Study, which re-
ported outcomes among a younger 10- to 13-year-old cohort,17
11- to 19-year-old BCFH-positive girls did not experience worse
general psychosocial adjustment than peers. Interestingly, self-
esteem was higher among BCFH-positive girls and girls with
stronger family history of breast cancer, whereas depression was
lower with increasing number of relatives with breast cancer. These
data suggest that exposure to relatives with cancer in the family
might foster adaptive responses, but these outcomes may also be
differentially influenced by individual, mother, and family factors.
Similar to the LEGACY Girls Study, we found that 11- to
19-year-old BCFH-positive girls report higher breast cancer–
specific distress than peers and that distress increased with greater

group). Older age was significantly asso-
ciated with higher perceived risk (P , .01).
Compared with 11- to 13-year-old girls, 14- to
16-year old girls (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% CI,
1.26 to 3.79) and 17- to 19-year-old girls (odds
ratio, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.28 to 7.77) were more
likely to report themselves at increased risk
on a verbal scale. There were significant
differences between BCFH-positive and
BCFH-negative groups at the youngest
ages (P , .01 comparing BCFH-negative
with each of the three other risk categories)
but no statistically significant differences
among the three BCFH-positive groups.
The relationship of age with perceived risk
was not moderated by the four risk groups
(P . .2 for interaction terms).

Psychosocial Adjustment and Perceived Risk Among Adolescent Girls
 mother breast cancer–specific distress. Additionally, the majority of
adolescent girls from breast cancer families are aware of their
familial risk for breast cancer in adulthood, which is highest among
older girls and those who report knowledge of their mother’s
BRCA1/2 testing. This is not surprising given the majority of
parents discuss familial and genetic risk for breast cancer with their
children, particularly as they age.11 Thus, even though BRCA1/2
testing is not currently recommended for children and adolescents,
the majority of girls in families at familial and genetic risk report
themselves to be at higher lifetime risk for breast cancer than their
peers, particularly among girls who report knowledge of their
mother’s BRCA1/2-positive testing.
The clinical impact of heightened breast cancer risk awareness
and higher distress in BCFH-positive girls remains unclear. These
findings, consistent with our theoretical model, suggest the im-
portance of continuing assessment of biopsychosocial factors that
impact the long-term psychosocial and medical well-being of
adolescents in BCFH-positive families. This can better inform
development of interventions or subgroups for whom in-
terventions may be particularly beneficial. Chronic psychosocial
stressors can impact psychological and physical health,45-48 and
psychosocial distress can be associated with greater risk behaviors
(eg, tobacco, alcohol use). Furthermore, many health and risk
behaviors in adolescence relate to the adoption and maintenance of
health and risk behaviors throughout life.28,29,49-51 At the same
time, risk awareness in the context of low levels of distress might
motivate adolescents to engage in health-promoting behaviors.
Given data that lifestyle factors (eg, diet, exercise, tobacco and
alcohol use) in adolescence may impact risk for breast cancer in
adulthood,3-10 there is a great need to understand the longitudinal
outcomes and impact on health behaviors in girls from breast
cancer and BRCA1/2-positive families.
Consistent with the literature, the LEGACY Girls Study, and
our theoretical model, poorer daughter psychosocial adjustment
subscales (eg, anxiety, depression, self-esteem) are strongly asso-
ciated with poorer family function, poorer mother adjustment, and
higher daughter distress with higher mother distress.19,20,38,52-54
This provides additional data supporting efforts to assess and
address psychosocial issues of not just survivors of breast cancer
with adolescent daughters, but also “pre-vivors”17 (ie, individuals

 without cancer but at genetic risk). Such efforts could have benefits
for their adolescent daughters at critical points throughout their
development. This will become increasingly important as sus-
ceptibility testing for cancer expands, increasing the population of
at-risk families.
Historically, guidelines have recommended against genetic
testing of children for adult-onset disease, although recent guide-
lines have suggested that testing may be permitted in some cir-
cumstances.55 Additionally, recent guidelines recommend returning
incidental findings in adult-onset susceptibility genes (including
BRCA1/2) regardless of age.16 Although many oppose an obligation
to return incidental BRCA1/2 mutations to children and adoles-
cents, advances in genetic sequencing will continue to heighten the
debate over the risks and benefits of testing youth for disease that
will not manifest until adulthood.56,57 Although we do not suggest
that these data provide evidence to change existing policy, they do
highlight the need to better understand the potential benefits and
harms of extending testing for BRCA1/2 and other adult condi-
tions during childhood and adolescence. There might be potential
benefits to genetic testing in adolescence, such as relief from un-
certainty and reduced cancer-specific distress for those who test
negative or early incorporation of genetic identity into self-concept
during adolescence and motivation for early lifestyle changes
among carriers. There are also potential harms, including negative
impact on family relations, increased distress, risk behaviors, and
survivor guilt. These data do suggest that there could be benefits to
testing children and adolescents, because, by mid to late adoles-
cence, the overwhelming majority of girls of BRCA1/2-positive
mothers consider themselves to be at increased risk for breast
cancer. Nonetheless, empirical studies are needed to understand the
balance of risks and benefits across the developmental trajectory to
inform genetic testing policies of minors for adult-onset disease.
We acknowledge limitations to this study. Participants might
represent a biased sample, which might not be generalizable to all
girls and mothers. The study included few ethnic minorities, and
BCFH-positive and BCFH-negative families were recruited from
different sources. We focused on mother-daughter pairs. These
data might not reflect outcomes for daughters whose mother is
deceased or the impact of fathers or other parent figures. Although,
to our knowledge, this study represents the largest number of girls
from BRCA1/2-positive families to date, confirmation in a larger
population of BRCA1/2-positive families is needed. Although
outcomes did not differ on the basis of mother- versus daughter-
reported family history, more detailed query about what girls know
of cancer and susceptibility testing in the family could be useful.
Additionally, we do not report specifically what mothers com-
municated to daughters regarding cancer in the family and the
mother’s diagnosis or BRCA1/2 status. A better understanding of
this communication is an important area of further research.
Similarly, the impact of daughter exposure to affected mothers’
treatment was not included.
These data reveal that adolescent girls from breast cancer
families report greater self-esteem but also greater
breast
cancer–specific distress and perceived risk of breast cancer.
Identifying girls with a family history of breast cancer and pro-
viding referrals for maternal and familial psychosocial support for
mothers might promote optimal psychosocial and behavioral
adaptation of their daughters. Understanding the role of maternal
factors on outcomes, how daughter outcomes change de-
velopmentally, and their impact on health and risk behaviors is
necessary to inform interventions that optimize responses to
growing up in families at familial and genetic risk for breast cancer.
Further research on the risks and benefits of testing children for
familial BRCA1/2 or other breast cancer susceptibility genes is
needed to inform policies regarding the genetic testing of children
for adult-onset cancer susceptibility.
