The modern diet has become highly sweetened, resulting in unprecedented levels of
sugar consumption, particularly among adolescents. While chronic long-term sugar
intake is known to contribute to the development of metabolic disorders including obesity
and type II diabetes, little is known regarding the direct consequences of long-term,
binge-like sugar consumption on the brain. Because sugar can cause the release of
dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) similarly to drugs of abuse, we investigated
changes in the morphology of neurons in this brain region following short- (4 weeks) and
long-term (12 weeks) binge-like sucrose consumption using an intermittent two-bottle
choice paradigm. We used Golgi-Cox staining to impregnate medium spiny neurons
(MSNs) from the NAc core and shell of short- and long-term sucrose consuming rats
and compared these to age-matched water controls. We show that prolonged binge-like
sucrose consumption significantly decreased the total dendritic length of NAc shell
MSNs compared to age-matched control rats. We also found that the restructuring of
these neurons resulted primarily from reduced distal dendritic complexity. Conversely,
we observed increased spine densities at the distal branch orders of NAc shell MSNs
from long-term sucrose consuming rats. Combined, these results highlight the neuronal
effects of prolonged binge-like intake of sucrose on NAc shell MSN morphology.

INTRODUCTION
Over the last 40 years, there has been a documented rise in the consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages and foods containing added sugars (Nielsen et al., 2002; Popkin, 2010; Ng et al., 2012),
with reports estimating that up to 75% of all foods and beverages contain high amounts of
added sugars (Ford and Dietz, 2013; Bray and Popkin, 2014). During this period, there has also
been a concurrent increase in the prevalence of obesity and type II diabetes, particularly among
adolescents (Arslanian, 2002; Reinehr, 2013; Dabelea et al., 2014; Fryar et al., 2014). Recent studies
have shown that overweight and obese children often consume high amounts of added sugar,
however the contribution of high sugar containing diets to the increased incidence of overweight
 Klenowski et al.
Sucrose Alters Accumbens Neuron Morphology
and obese children remains controversial (Hu, 2013; Bray and
Popkin, 2014; Bucher Della Torre et al., 2015).
While a growing body of evidence indicates that the
consumption of high sugar diets may, in part, contribute to
weight gain among children and adolescents (Malik et al.,
2010; Te Morenga et al., 2013; Bray and Popkin, 2014), less
attention has been given to adverse non-metabolic consequences
arising from excessive sugar intake. Interestingly, some common
behavioral and psychological patterns often emerge amongst
a subset of those who over eat and maintain high sugar
containing diets. Most notable are the development of eating
disorders including binge-eating, combined with the concurrent
onset of psychological symptoms including lack of motivation
and depression (reviewed in Sheehan and Herman, 2015). In
addition, because binge-eating individuals often exhibit a loss
of control and an inability to self-limit their sugar intake, it
is likely that these behaviors arise as a result of neurological
adaptations in brain regions that evaluate the hedonic value of
highly palatable food (Saper et al., 2002; Lutter and Nestler,
2009; Kenny, 2011). This rationale is also supported by evidence
in humans demonstrating that sugar and sweetness can cause
cravings that are similar to those induced by addictive drugs such
as alcohol and nicotine (Volkow et al., 2012).
Although the addictive properties of sugar are still speculative,
these observations combined with studies demonstrating the
contribution of excessive sugar intake to changes in reward
circuitry and the development of addictive-like behaviors and
emotional states in animal models (Avena et al., 2008; Benton,
2010; Ventura et al., 2014), warrants the need for further
investigation. Previous studies in rodents have shown that
intermittent access to sucrose alters the activity of several
neurotransmitters within the mesolimbic system including
dopamine, opioids and acetylcholine (Reviewed in Avena et al.,
2008). Binge-like consumption of sucrose has been shown to
facilitate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc),
similarly to drugs of abuse (Avena et al., 2008). Furthermore,
we have shown that long-term consumption of sucrose using
a 24 h intermittent access two-bottle choice paradigm (Simms
et al., 2008) modulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
expression in the NAc (Shariff et al., in press). Interestingly, we
have also observed that nAChR compounds known to modulate
dopamine and acetylcholine activity in the NAc, have different
effects on sucrose consumption following short- and long-term
intake (Shariff et al., in press).
While these studies have demonstrated similarities in the
behavioral and neurochemical changes caused by intermittent
access to sugar and drugs of abuse, it is not known whether
these effects facilitate changes in neuronal morphology in the
NAc. This is in contrast to substances of abuse including cocaine,
amphetamine and nicotine which produce well characterized
changes in the morphology of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in
the NAc, including increased spine density and altered dendritic
complexity (Robinson and Kolb, 1999, 2004; Li et al., 2003;
Crombag et al., 2005). Because we have previously shown that
long-term exposure (12 week) to alcohol and sucrose using the
intermittent two-bottle choice paradigm produces a differential
response to pharmacotherapeutic interventions compared to
short-term intake (4 weeks; Steensland et al., 2007; Shariff et al.,
in press), we assessed the effects of short- and long-term sucrose
consumption on MSN morphology in the NAc. We allowed
adolescent rats to consume sucrose in a binge-like manner for
4 (short-term) or 12 (long-term) weeks and then analyzed the
morphology of NAc MSNs from short- and long-term sucrose
consuming rats and compared this to age-matched controls who
were given access to water only. Our results show that MSNs
from the NAc shell are altered following long- but not short-
term sucrose consumption, having reduced dendritic length, but
increased distal dendritic spine density. Furthermore, we found
the morphology of MSNs from the NAc core remained relatively
intact following short- and long-term sucrose consumption.
These results highlight a direct neurological consequence of long-
term sucrose consumption in a binge-like manner. Furthermore,
this data demonstrates the need for further studies aimed
at elucidating the molecular and neurochemical changes that
accompany the morphological restructuring of NAc shell MSNs
induced by prolonged, binge-like sucrose intake.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics Statement
All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with
the Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific
Purposes, 8th Edition (National Health and Medical Research
Council, 2013). The protocols were approved by the Queensland
University of Technology Animal Ethics Committee and the
University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee.
Animals and Housing
Five-week-old (adolescent) male Wistar rats (Control: 176.4 ±
4.8 g; Sucrose: 178.3 ± 5.0 g) (ARC, WA, Australia), were
individually housed in ventilated dual level Plexiglas R
� cages.
The rats were acclimatized to the individual housing conditions,
handling, and reverse-light cycle 5 days before the start of the
experiments. All rats were housed in a climate-controlled 12-hr
reversed light/dark cycle (lights off at 9 a.m.) room with standard
rat chow and water available ad libitum.
Intermittent-Access Two-Bottle Choice
Drinking Paradigm
The intermittent access 5% sucrose two-bottle choice drinking
paradigm (Simms et al., 2008) was adapted from Wise (1973).
All fluids were presented in 300 ml graduated plastic bottles with
stainless-steel drinking spouts inserted through two grommets
in the front of the cage following the commencement of the
dark light cycle. Weights of each bottle were recorded prior to
bottle presentation. Two bottles were presented simultaneously:
one bottle containing water; the second bottle containing 5%
(w/v) sucrose. The placement of the 5% (w/v) sucrose bottle was
alternated with each exposure to control for side preferences.
Bottles were weighed 24 h after the fluids were presented, and
measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1 g. The weight of
each rat was also measured to calculate the grams of sucrose
intake per kilogram of body weight. On day 1 of the drinking
period, rats (n = 6–9) were given access to one bottle of
5% (w/v) sucrose and one bottle of water. After 24 h, the
sucrose bottle was replaced with a second water bottle that

was available for the next 24 h. This pattern was repeated on
Wednesdays and Fridays. The rats had unlimited access to
water on all other days. Binge-like consumption of sucrose
resulted in an escalation in total sucrose intake (ml) over
time (Supplementary Figure 1) and was accompanied by stable
baseline drinking levels based on body weight [20 ± 5 g/kg of
the 5% (w/v)] during the short-term [∼4 weeks (13 drinking
sessions)] and long-term [∼12 weeks (37 drinking sessions)]
drinking periods. A separate group of control rats (n = 6–9)
were given access to water in both bottles (i.e., no sucrose) under
the same conditions described above. The mean body weight
of control and sucrose consuming rats at the end of short-term
exposure was 405.7 ± 40.8 g and 426.4 ± 31.2 g respectively.
At the end of long-term exposure, the mean body weight for
control and sucrose groups was 578.8 ± 53.4 g and 600.2 ±
45.2 g.
Golgi-Cox Staining
Following the last drinking session rats were transferred from
the animal facility to allow for processing of the brain samples
at the histology facility at the School of Biomedical Sciences,
University of Queensland (St Lucia, Australia). All approved
measures were taken to reduce stress during transport, following
which, rats were allowed to recover overnight. The next day, rats
were sacrificed by sodium pentobarbital overdose (60–80 mg/kg,
i.p. Vetcare, Brisbane, Australia) and intracardially perfused
with ∼300 ml artificial cerebro-spinal fluid that contained, (in
mM): 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 5 MgCl2,
1 CaCl2, and 10 D-glucose. Each animal was then decapitated
and the brain removed and incubated in the dark in Golgi-Cox
solution that contained 5% potassium dichromate, 5% potassium
chromate, and 5% mercuric chloride (all chemicals from Sigma-
Aldrich) that was made fresh 3 days prior to sacrifice as described
previously (Rutledge et al., 1969). Golgi-Cox stain incubation
and post-processing methods were modified from Ranjan and
Mallick (2010). Brains from short-term sucrose consuming
animals were incubated for 6 days at 37◦C, whilst brains from
long-term sucrose consuming animals were incubated for 10
days, with one change to fresh Golgi-Cox solution after 4 days
of incubation.
Following incubation, 300 µm coronal sections were cut
using a vibrating Zeiss Hyrax V50 microtome (Carl Zeiss,
Germany). Slices were then placed sequentially in 24-well plates
filled with 30% (w/v) sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline
and processed as outlined in (Ranjan and Mallick, 2010). Briefly,
sections were dehydrated in 50% ethanol for 5 min, then placed
in 0.1 M NH4OH solution for 30 min, rinsed twice with distilled
water for 5 min and placed in Fujihunt film fixer (Fujifilm,
Singapore) for 30 min in the dark. The slices were then rinsed
twice in distilled water for 2 min each and dehydrated in 70, 90,
95, and 100% ethanol twice for 5 min each. The sections were
then cleared in CXA solution (1:1:1 chloroform:xylene:alcohol)
for

The slides were left in the dark to dry at room temperature
overnight.
Neuronal Selection and Tracing within the
Nucleus Accumbens
Coronal slices between bregma +2.8 and +1.7 were surveyed
for MSNs within the core and shell of the NAc, using the lateral
ventricle and the anterior commissure as landmarks with the aid
of a rat brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 2007) (Figure 1). The
contour function in Neurolucida 7 (MBF Bioscience, VT, USA)
was used to demarcate the NAc core and NAc shell in each slice
(Figure 2). Between 2 and 9 neurons per region per animal were
traced for dendritic length parameters using a 63x objective or
for spine densities (reported as spines per 100 µm) using a 100x
objective on a Zeiss Axioskop II (Carl Zeiss, Germany) using an
automated xyz stage driven by Neurolucida R
� 7 software (MBF
Biosciences, VT, USA). All tracing was performed in a blinded
fashion with respect to treatment. Morphological parameters
of Golgi-Cox impregnated neurons were analyzed in a manner
similar to previous reports (Klenowski et al., 2015).
Statistical Analysis
Mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated for
each data set with the animal as n, using the mean morphometry

shell and n = 6 for NAc core 4-week, n = 9 for 12-week
groups). Where indicated, unpaired two tailed Student’s t-tests
or two-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni post-tests were conducted
for all analyses involving the comparison of group means,
using GraphPad Prism version 6.02 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA). Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

RESULTS

Dendritic Length, Decreased Dendritic
Complexity but Increased Mean Spine
Density at Distal Branch Orders Following
Long- but not Short-Term Sucrose
Consumption
Following short-term (4 weeks) sucrose consumption, there
were no significant differences in NAc shell MSN morphometric
parameters (Table 1). There were also no significant differences
between short-term sucrose consumption and water control
NAc shell MSNs in analyses related to centrifugal branch order.
Namely, dendritic segments per branch order (P = 0.4111),
mean dendritic length per branch order (P = 0.5581) and mean
spine density per branch order (P = 0.2977, two-way ANOVAs)
were not significantly different between groups. A location map
showing the approximate positions of the sampled neurons is
shown in Figure 1.
Following long-term (12 weeks) of sucrose consumption, the
total dendritic arbor length of NAc shell MSNs were decreased by
21% compared to water consuming controls (Water: 1827 ± 148
µm, n = 9; Sucrose 1449 ± 78 µm, n = 9, ∗P = 0.0384, two-tailed
unpaired Student’s t-test, Figure 2, Table 2). Comparison of the
mean number of dendritic bifurcations (nodes) and dendritic
endings between the water and sucrose groups revealed a reduced
(although not significant) level of dendritic complexity in NAc
shell MSNs (nodes: Water 12.9 ± 1.4 n = 9, Sucrose 10.1 ±
0.8 n = 9, P = 0.0879; endings: Water 17.9 ± 1.4 n = 9,

Sucrose 14.8 ± 0.7 n = 9, P = 0.0657, two-tailed unpaired

(P = 0.9400), mean dendritic tree length (P = 0.1646) or total
spine density (P = 0.3662) in NAc shell MSNs from long-
term sucrose consuming rats compared to water controls. These
morphometric parameters are detailed in Table 2.
Following the characterization of the general dendritic
morphology of long-term sucrose consuming NAc shell MSNs,
we analyzed dendritic arborizations and spine densities with
regard to their branch order characteristics. Our comprehensive
assessment of the dendritic trees quantified the number of
dendritic segments per branch order, the mean length of
dendritic segments per branch order and mean spine density per
branch order of NAc shell MSNs of water control and long-term
sucrose consuming rats. A summary of the branch order data and
analysis is presented in Table 3.
The mean dendritic branch segment number per branch order
of NAc shell MSNs was significantly reduced in long-term sucrose
consuming rats compared to water controls (∗∗P = 0.0015, two-
way ANOVA). Bonferroni post-tests revealed a trend toward a
reduced number of branch segments at 4th (Water: 5.2 ± 0.9,
n = 9; Sucrose 3.3 ± 0.8, n = 9, P = 0.0675, Figure 2F, Table 3),
and 5th order and above branch orders (Water: 3.3 ± 0.7, n =
9; Sucrose 1.2 ± 0.3, n = 9, P = 0.0566, Figure 2F, Table 3).
The mean dendritic segment length per branch order of NAc
shell MSNs was also significantly reduced in long-term sucrose
consuming rats compared to water controls (∗P = 0.0444, two-
way ANOVA). Bonferroni post-tests showed a reduction of 55%
at 5th order branches and beyond (Water: 53.9 ± 7.2 µm, n
= 9; Sucrose 24.1 ± 7.5 µm, n = 9, ∗∗P = 0.0038, Figure 2G,
Table 3).
Branch order analysis showed a significant increase in the
dendritic spine density of NAc shell MSNs of long-term sucrose
consuming rats compared to controls (∗P = 0.0124, two-
way ANOVA). Bonferroni post-tests showed a spine density
increase of 57% at distal 4th order branches and beyond (Water:
33.4 ± 4.2, n = 9; Sucrose 52.5 ± 6.8, n = 9, P = 0.0271∗, inset
of Figures 2A,B,H, Table 3). Representative images of overall
MSN architecture and distal spine density (inset) are depicted in
Figures 2A,B.
Taken together, these results indicate that short-term sucrose
consumption has little effect on morphologic parameters of
MSNs within the NAc shell. However, following prolonged
consumption, there is a significant decrease in the neuronal arbor
length and complexity, particularly in distal dendritic branches.
Concomitant distal spine density increases are also apparent in
NAc shell MSNs of long-term sucrose consuming rats.

Following short-term of sucrose consumption, there were

density per branch order (P = 0.3521, two-way ANOVAs) were
not different between groups.
Prolonged sucrose consumption also had no significant on
NAc core MSN morphometric parameters (Table 5). The mean
dendritic branch segment number per branch order of NAc
core MSNs was significantly reduced in long-term sucrose
consuming rats compared to water controls (∗P = 0.0416, two-

in mean dendritic length per branch order (P = 0.0995) and
mean spine density per branch order (P = 0.4888, two-way

our data shows the NAc core is not as responsive to long-term
sucrose consumption compared to MSNs from the NAc shell
region.

DISCUSSION
The increased availability of highly sweetened food in the
Western diet has not only contributed to the increased prevalence
and economic burden of obesity and type II diabetes, it has
also led to an onset of eating disorders such as binge eating
(Swanson et al., 2011; Kessler et al., 2013; Davis, 2015). Although
the addictive properties of sugars including fructose and sucrose
remain speculative, there is a striking similarity in the behavioral
and neural correlates that manifest as a result of over eating and
prolonged drug use (Avena et al., 2008, 2011). In addition, sugar
activates the brain’s reward circuitry in a way that is similar to
drugs of abuse (Volkow et al., 2012), and results from human
studies suggest that sugar and sweetness can induce cravings that
are comparable in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs
such as alcohol and nicotine (Volkow et al., 2012). We therefore
used a model of binge-sucrose consumption in rats to determine
the effects of short- (4 weeks) and long-term (12 weeks) sucrose
consumption on neuronal morphology of MSNs in the NAc,
a key component of the overlapping reward circuitry that is
modulated by sugar and addictive drugs. We show that MSNs
from the NAc shell of chronic long-term sucrose consuming
rats have significantly decreased dendritic length and complexity,
but increased distal dendritic spine density. Long-term sucrose
consumption had no effect on the morphology of MSNs from
the NAc core, while short-term sucrose consumption also had
no significant effect on MSN morphology from the NAc core
or shell. These results not only demonstrate a direct effect of
prolonged binge-like sucrose intake on neuronal morphology
of NAc shell MSNs, but they also highlight the potentially
harmful consequences of the prolonged consumption of high
sugar containing diets.
The NAc, which forms part of the ventral striatum, is
comprised primarily of MSNs, which are morphologically
characterized as medium-sized neurons with extensive dendritic
arborisations and high spine density (Kemp and Powell, 1971;
Graveland and DiFiglia, 1985; Rafols et al., 1989; Kawaguchi
et al., 1990). Glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons are the
two primary afferent inputs to the NAc, primarily contacting
the dendritic shafts and spines of MSNs (Groves, 1980; Kaiya
and Namba, 1981; Groves et al., 1994). Specifically, the NAc
shell and core receive glutamatergic input from functionally
distinct cortical areas (Brog et al., 1993). The NAc shell is
also innervated by excitatory afferents from subcortical regions
such as the hippocampus, thalamus and basolateral amygdala
(Brog et al., 1993; Wright and Groenewegen, 1995). Previous
studies have demonstrated that these glutamatergic inputs play
a pivotal role in motivation and goal-directed behaviors such as
food and reward seeking (Maldonado-Irizarry et al., 1995; Kelley
and Swanson, 1997; Reynolds and Berridge, 2003; Richard and
Berridge, 2011). The other predominant input onto NAc MSNs
is from dopaminergic afferents that project from the ventral
tegmental area (Lindvall and Björklund, 1978; Veening et al.,
1980; Kalivas and Miller, 1984). Interestingly, previous studies
using similar models of intermittent sugar access have shown
that the resulting binge-like consumption results in an increase
in extracellular dopamine in the NAc similarly (albeit to a lesser
extent) to drugs of abuse (Rada et al., 2005; Avena et al., 2006),
and can modulate dopamine receptor expression (Colantuoni
et al., 2001, 2002) in the NAc core and shell. Interestingly, binge-
like consumption of sucrose causes an escalation in intake over
time similarly to self-administration of drugs of abuse such as
cocaine and heroin (Ahmed and Koob, 1998; Ahmed et al., 2000,
2003) which is associated with the development of an “addictive
like” state.
Our analysis of branch order morphometry shows that the
overall reduction in dendritic length of NAc shell MSNs caused
by long-term sucrose intake, results primarily from reductions
in the complexity of distal branch orders. We observed reduced
distal branching (4th and 5th order and above branch orders)
and significantly reduced mean length at 5th order and above
dendrites, combined with increased spine densities at these
branch orders. A common factor likely to influence this type of
dendritic restructuring includes changes in synaptic connectivity
and/or function (Russo et al., 2010). Previous studies have shown
that glutamatergic synapses on MSNs are formed primarily on
spines, particularly at distal dendrites (Groenewegen et al., 1999).
Additionally, co-localization of dopamine and glutamatergic
inputs from the prefrontal cortex (Sesack and Pickel, 1992),
hippocampus (Totterdell and Smith, 1989; Sesack and Pickel,
1990), and amygdala (Johnson et al., 1994) have been observed
on dendritic spines of MSNs. These observations combined
with the increased spine density following long-term sucrose
consumption seen in our study, support the formation of
increased excitatory inputs. Therefore, the possibility arises
where persistent effects caused by prolonged binge-like sucrose
intake could facilitate increased excitatory synaptic activity at
the distal dendrites of MSNs in the NAc shell. Consequently,
reduction and/or retraction of distal dendrites may result via a
synaptic homeostatic mechanism (Reissner and Kalivas, 2010),
however this remains to be determined.
It is interesting to note that Crombag and colleagues showed
that there was no spine density increase in the NAc shell
following 4-week sucrose consumption via the nose-poke self-
administration paradigm despite a more robust acquisition
and a higher response rate to sucrose when compared with
amphetamine (Crombag et al., 2005). Their observation of an
absence of change in spine density at 4 weeks mirrors our
findings. By contrast, however, our study demonstrates that
following long-term (12 week) exposure to chronic sucrose

consumption, there is a significant increase in distal spine density
on the MSNs of the sucrose-experiences rats. Furthermore,
our laboratory has previously shown that long-term (12 week)
sucrose consumption facilitates a differential pharmacological
response to pharmacotherapeutics that have been shown to
modulate dopamine and acetylcholine responses at the level of
the NAc (Shariff et al., in press). Taken together, this suggests
that long-term (12 weeks and beyond) sucrose exposure, which
is more accurately reflective of real-world scenarios, results in
morphology adaptations at the level of the NAc.
In terms of drugs of abuse, repeated exposure to various
drugs produces long-lasting changes in the structure of dendrites
and dendritic spines. For example, amphetamines and cocaine
both increase spine density in the NAc in both shell and core
(Robinson and Kolb, 2004). Nicotine exposure has also been
shown to increase spine density in the NAc shell. Conversely,
morphine exposure leads to a decrease in spine density and
dendritic branch complexity (Robinson and Kolb, 2004). In
terms of long-term sucrose consumption, we observed an
increase in spine density similar to amphetamine, cocaine and
nicotine and opposite to the effect of morphine. However, unlike
amphetamine and cocaine, but similar to nicotine, the increase
of spine density on long-term exposure to sucrose is limited to
the NAc shell. It is also interesting that changes in both dendritic
branching (Robinson and Kolb, 1999) and spine density (Li et al.,
2003) produced by amphetamine or cocaine are confined to distal
dendrites of MSNs in the NAc, which reflects the findings in our
study. Furthermore, and corroborative to the changes described
above, sucrose consumption has also previously been shown to
enhance excitatory synaptic strength onto accumbal dopamine
neurons (Stuber et al., 2008b) as well as other components of
the mesolimbic reward pathway (Stuber et al., 2008a; Chen et al.,
2010). Taken together, this posits sucrose as a potent modulator
of neuron morphology following prolonged heavy use, which is
akin to the effects observed from drugs of abuse.
Although further investigations are required to uncover
the
cellular
and
synaptic
mechanisms
contributing
to
the morphological changes seen in this study, our results
demonstrate significant neuronal effects engendered by long-
term sucrose consumption. In particular, a consideration not
examined in our study is whether the observed morphological
effects of sucrose can also be elicited with non-caloric sweeteners
such as saccharin. In this regard it is important to note that
Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

Sucrose Alters Accumbens Neuron Morphology
Lenoir and colleagues have shown that intense sweetness
surpasses cocaine reward, be it generated by saccharin or sucrose
(Lenoir et al., 2007). Furthermore, a recent study published by
our lab (Shariff et al., in press) demonstrates that varenicline,
a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist reduced both
sucrose and saccharin intake in rodents following the same
long-term intermittent access regimen used in the present study.
Interestingly, previous studies have shown similarities in the
acute effects of non-caloric sweeteners such as saccharin and
sucrose at the level of the NAc (Scheggi et al., 2013; Tukey et al.,
2013; Carelli and West, 2014). However, further studies are
need to determine whether non-caloric sweeteners can induce
long-term effects similar to changes in the morphology of the
NAc shell MSNs caused by long-term sucrose consumption
reported here.
The lack of effect on NAc MSN morphology following
short-term sucrose consumption, highlights the importance
of implementing long-term studies to assess the impact of
prolonged abuse of drugs or natural rewards like sucrose. In
terms of dependence, not only are repeated cycles of binge intake
and abstinence key components of the addiction cycle, a growing
body of evidence has revealed that the transition to dependence
is a progressive process that often occurs over an extended
period of time. Although the addictive properties of sugars
remain uncertain, the plausibility of addiction to other non-drug
rewards such as sex, gambling and food is being increasingly
investigated. The results from this study add merit to the
hypothesis that sugars such as sucrose potentially have addictive
properties following long-term, binge-like consumption. Our
results also have implications for the growing number of children
and adolescents who maintain unhealthy eating habits (high
sugar consumption and binge eating) into adulthood. In line
with the increased risk of developing metabolic effects it is
also possible that neurological and psychiatric consequences
affecting mood and motivation may also result from these
behaviors.
