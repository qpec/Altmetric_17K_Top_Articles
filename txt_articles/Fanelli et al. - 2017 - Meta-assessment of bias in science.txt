Numerous biases are believed to affect the scientific literature, but
their actual prevalence across disciplines is unknown. To gain a
comprehensive picture of the potential imprint of bias in science, we
probed for the most commonly postulated bias-related patterns and
risk factors, in a large random sample of meta-analyses taken from
all disciplines. The magnitude of these biases varied widely across
fields and was overall relatively small. However, we consistently
observed a significant risk of small, early, and highly cited studies to
overestimate effects and of studies not published in peer-reviewed
journals to underestimate them. We also found at least partial
confirmation of previous evidence suggesting that US studies and
early studies might report more extreme effects, although these
effects were smaller and more heterogeneously distributed across
meta-analyses and disciplines. Authors publishing at high rates and
receiving many citations were, overall, not at greater risk of bias.
However, effect sizes were likely to be overestimated by early-career
researchers, those working in small or long-distance collaborations,
and those responsible for scientific misconduct, supporting hypothe-
ses that connect bias to situational factors, lack of mutual control, and
individual integrity. Some of these patterns and risk factors might
have modestly increased in intensity over time, particularly in the
social sciences. Our findings suggest that, besides one being routinely
cautious that published small, highly-cited, and earlier studies may
yield inflated results, the feasibility and costs of interventions to
attenuate biases in the literature might need to be discussed on a
discipline-specific and topic-specific basis.

N
umerous biases have been described in the literature, raising
concerns for the reliability and integrity of the scientific
enterprise (1–4). However, it is yet unknown to what extent bias
patterns and postulated risk factors are generalizable phenomena
that threaten all scientific fields in similar ways and whether
studies documenting such problems are reproducible (5–7). In-
deed, evidence suggests that biases may be heterogeneously dis-
tributed in the literature. The ratio of studies concluding in favor
vs. against a tested hypothesis increases, moving from the physical,
to the biological and to the social sciences, suggesting that re-
search fields with higher noise-to-signal ratio and lower method-
ological consensus might be more exposed to positive-outcome
bias (5, 8, 9). Furthermore, multiple independent studies suggested
that this ratio is increasing (i.e., positive results have become more
prevalent), again with differences between research areas (9–11),
and that it may be higher among studies from the United States,
possibly due to excessive “productivity” expectations imposed on
researchers by the tenure-track system (12–14). Most of these re-
sults, however, are derived from varying, indirect proxies of
positive-outcome bias that may or may not correspond to actual
distortions of the literature.
Nonetheless, concerns that papers reporting false or exagger-
ated findings might be widespread and growing have inspired an
expanding literature of research on research (aka meta-research),
which points to a postulated core set of bias patterns and factors
that might increase the risk for researchers to engage in bias-
generating practices (15, 16).
The bias patterns most commonly discussed in the literature,
which are the focus of our study, include the following:
Small-study effects: Studies that are smaller (of lower precision)
might report effect sizes of larger magnitude. This phenomenon
could be due to selective reporting of results or to genuine
heterogeneity in study design that results in larger effects being
detected by smaller studies (17).
Gray literature bias: Studies might be less likely to be published
if they yielded smaller and/or statistically nonsignificant effects
and might be therefore only available in PhD theses, conference
proceedings, books, personal communications, and other forms
of “gray” literature (1).
Decline effect: The earliest studies to report an effect might
overestimate its magnitude relative to later studies, due to a
decreasing field-specific publication bias over time or to differ-
ences in study design between earlier and later studies (1, 18).
Early-extreme: An alternative scenario to the decline effect
might see earlier studies reporting extreme effects in any di-
rection, because extreme and controversial findings have an
early window of opportunity for publication (19).
Citation bias: The number of citations received by a study
might be correlated to the magnitude of effects reported (20).
US effect: Publications from authors working in the United
States might overestimate effect sizes, a difference that could
be due to multiple sociological factors (14).
Industry bias: Industry sponsorship may affect the direction
and magnitude of effects reported by biomedical studies
Significance
Science is said to be suffering a reproducibility crisis caused by many
biases. How common are these problems, across the wide diversity of
research fields? We probed for multiple bias-related patterns in a
large random sample of meta-analyses taken from all disciplines. The
magnitude of these biases varied widely across fields and was on
average relatively small. However, we consistently observed that
small, early, highly cited studies published in peer-reviewed journals
were likely to overestimate effects. We found little evidence that
these biases were related to scientific productivity, and we found no
difference between biases in male and female researchers. However,
a scientist’s early-career status, isolation, and lack of scientific integrity
might be significant risk factors for producing unreliable results.

 (21). We generalized this hypothesis to nonbiomedical fields
by predicting that studies with coauthors affiliated to private
companies might be at greater risk of bias.
Among the many sociological and psychological factors that
may underlie the bias patterns above, the most commonly invoked
include the following:
Pressures to publish: Scientists subjected to direct or indirect pres-
sures to publish might be more likely to exaggerate the magnitude
and importance of their results to secure many high-impact pub-
lications and new grants (22, 23). One type of pressure to publish
is induced by national policies that connect publication perfor-
mance with career advancement and public funding to institutions.
Mutual control: Researchers working in close collaborations
are able to mutually control each other’s work and might
therefore be less likely to engage in questionable research
practices (QRP) (24, 25). If so, risk of bias might be lower
in collaborative research but, adjusting for this factor, higher
in long-distance collaborations (25).
Career stage: Early-career researchers might be more likely to
engage in QRP, because they are less experienced and have
more to gain from taking risks (26).
Gender of scientist: Males are more likely to take risks to
achieve higher status and might therefore be more likely to
engage in QRP. This hypothesis was supported by statistics of
the US Office of Research Integrity (27), which, however, may
have multiple alternative explanations (28).
Individual integrity: Narcissism or other psychopathologies un-
derlie misbehavior and unethical decision making and there-
fore might also affect individual research practices (29–31).
One can explore whether these bias patterns and postulated
causes are associated with the magnitude of effect sizes reported
by studies performed on a given scientific topic, as represented by
individual meta-analyses. The prevalence of these phenomena
across multiple meta-analyses can be analyzed with multilevel
weighted regression analysis (14) or, more straightforwardly, by
conducting a second-order meta-analysis on regression estimates
obtained within each meta-analysis (32). Bias patterns and risk
factors can thus be assessed across multiple topics within a disci-
pline, across disciplines or larger scientific domains (social, bi-
ological, and physical sciences), and across all of science.
To gain a comprehensive picture of the potential imprint of bias
in science, we collected a large sample of meta-analyses covering
all areas of scientific research. We recorded the effect size reported
by each primary study within each meta-analysis and assessed, us-
ing meta-regression, the extent to which a set of parameters
reflecting hypothesized patterns and risk factors for bias was indeed
associated with a study’s likelihood to overestimate effect sizes.
Each bias pattern and postulated risk factor listed above was
turned into a testable hypothesis, with specific predictions about
how the magnitude of effect sizes reported by primary studies in
meta-analyses should be associated with some measurable charac-
teristic of primary study or author (Table 1). To test these hy-
potheses, we searched for meta-analyses in each of the 22 mutually
exclusive disciplinary categories used by the Essential Science In-
dicators database, a bibliometric tool that covers all areas of science
and was used in previous large-scale studies of bias (5, 11, 33).
These searches yielded an initial list of over 116,000 potentially
relevant titles, which through successive phases of screening
and exclusion yielded a final sample of 3,042 usable meta-analyses
(Fig. S1). Of these, 1,910 meta-analyses used effect-size metrics that
could all be converted to log-odds ratio (n = 33,355 nonduplicated

 primary data points), whereas the remaining 1,132 meta-analyses
(n = 15,909) used a variety of other metrics, which are not readily
interconvertible to log-odds ratio (Table S1). In line with previous
studies, we focused our main analysis on the former subsample,
which represents a relatively homogeneous population, and we
included the second subsample only in robustness analyses.
On each included meta-analysis, the possible effect of each
relevant independent variable was measured by standard linear
meta-regression. The resulting regression coefficients were then
summarized in a second-order meta-analysis to obtain a gener-
alized summary estimate of each pattern and factor across all
included meta-analyses. Analyses were also repeated using an
alternative method, in which primary data are standardized
and analyzed with multilevel regression (see SI Multilevel Meta-
Regression Analysis for further details).
Results
Bias Patterns. Bias patterns varied substantially in magnitude as
well as direction across meta-analyses, and their distribution
usually included several extreme values (Fig. S2; full numerical
results in Dataset S1). Second-order meta-analysis of these re-
gression estimates yielded highly statistically significant support
for the presence of small-study effects, gray literature bias, and
citation bias (Fig. 1 A and B). These patterns were consistently
observed in all secondary and robustness tests, which repeated all
analyses not adjusting for study precision, standardizing meta-
regression estimates and not coining the meta-analyses or coin-
ing them with different thresholds (see Methods for details and all
numerical results in Dataset S2).
The decline effect, measured as a linear association between
year of study publication and reported effect size, was not statis-
tically significant in our main analysis (Fig. 1B), but was highly
significant in all robustness tests. Moreover, secondary analyses
conducted with the multilevel regression approach suggest that
most or all of this effect might actually consist of a “first-year”
effect, in which the decline is not linear and just the very earliest
studies are likely to overestimate findings (SI Multilevel Meta-
Regression Analysis, Multilevel Analyses, Secondary Tests of Early
Extremes, Proteus Phenomenon and Decline Effect).
The early-extreme effect was, in most robustness tests, mar-
ginally significant in the opposite direction to what was pre-
dicted, but was measured to high statistical significance in the
predicted (i.e., negative) direction when not adjusted for small-
study effects (Dataset S2). In other words, it appears to be true
that earlier studies may report extreme effects in either direction,
but this effect is mainly or solely due to the lower precision of
earlier studies.
The US effect exhibited associations in the predicted direction
and was marginally significant in our main analyses (Fig. 1B) and
was significant in some of the robustness tests, particularly when
meta-analysis coining was done more conservatively (Dataset S2;
see Methods for further details).
Industry bias was absent in our main analyses (Fig. 1B) but was
statistically significant when meta-analyses were coined more
conservatively (Dataset S2).
Standardizing these various biases to estimate their relative
importance is not straightforward, but results using different
methods suggested that small-study effects are by far the most
important source of potential bias in the literature. Second-order
meta-analyses of standardized meta-regression estimates, for ex-
ample, yield similar results to those in Fig. 1 (Dataset S2).
Calculation of pseudo-R2 in multilevel regression suggests that
small-study effects account for around 27% of the variance of
primary outcomes, whereas gray literature bias, citation bias,
decline effect, industry sponsorship, and US effect, each tested
as individual predictor and not adjusted for study precision,
account for only 1.2%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.2%, and 0.04% of the
variance, respectively (see SI Multilevel Meta-Regression Analysis,
Multilevel Analyses, Relative Strength of Biases further details).
Risk Factors for Bias. The pressure to publish hypothesis was overall
negatively supported by our analyses, which included tests at the
country (i.e., policy) as well as the individual level. At the country
level, we found that authors working in countries that incentivize
publication performance by distributing public funding to institu-
tions (i.e., Australia, Belgium, New Zealand, Denmark, Italy,
Norway, and the United Kingdom) were significantly less likely to
overestimate effects. Countries in which publication incentives
operate on an individual basis, for example via a tenure-track
system (i.e., Germany, Spain, and the United States), and coun-
tries in which performance is rewarded with cash-bonus incentives
(China, Korea, and Turkey), however, exhibited no significant
difference in either direction (Fig. 1C). If country was tested
separately for first and last authors, results were even more con-
servative, with last authors working in countries from the latter

factors, adjusted for study precision. Each panel shows second-order random-
effects meta-analytical summaries of meta-regression estimates [i.e., b ± 95%
confidence interval (CI)], measured across the sample of meta-analyses. Sym-
bols in parentheses indicate whether the association between factor and ef-
fect size is predicted to be positive (+) or negative (−). The gray area within
each circle is proportional to the percentage of total variance explained by
between–meta-analysis variance (i.e., heterogeneity, measured by I2). To help
visualize effect sizes and statistical significance, numbers above error bars
display t scores (i.e., summary effect size divided by its corresponding SE, b/SE)
and conventional significance levels (i.e., +P < 0.1, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
0.001). Numbers below each error bar reflect the cross–meta-analytical con-
sistency of effects, measured as the ratio of between–meta-analysis SD divided
by summary effect size (i.e., τ/b; the smaller the ratio, the higher the consis-
tency). A few of the tested variables were omitted from D for brevity (full
numerical results for all variables are in Dataset S2). See main text and Table 1
for details of each variable.

 two categories being significantly less likely to overestimate results
(Dataset S2). At the individual level, we again found little con-
sistent support for our predictions. Publication and impact per-
formance of first and last authors, measured in terms of
publications per year, citations per paper, and normalized journal
impact score (Fig. 1D) as well as additional related measures
(Dataset S2), were either not or negatively associated with over-
estimation of results. The most productive and impactful last au-
thors, in other words, were significantly less likely to report
exaggerated effects (Fig. 1D).
The mutual control hypothesis was supported overall, suggest-
ing a negative association of bias with team size and a positive one
with country-to-author ratio (Fig. 1E). Geographic distance
exhibited a negative association, against predictions, but this result
was not observed in any robustness test, unlike the other two
(Dataset S2).
The career level of authors, measured as the number of years in
activity since the first publication in the Web of Science, was
overall negatively associated with reported effect size, although
the association was statistically significant and robust only for last
authors (Fig. 1F). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis
that early-career researchers would be at greater risk of reporting
overestimated effects (Table 1).
Gender was inconsistently associated with reported effect size:
In most robustness tests, female authors exhibited a tendency to
report smaller (i.e., more conservative) effect sizes (e.g., Fig. 1F),
but the only statistically significant effect detected among all ro-
bustness tests suggested the opposite, i.e., that female first authors
are more likely to overestimate effects (Dataset S2).
Scientists who had one or more papers retracted were signifi-
cantly more likely to report overestimated effect sizes, albeit solely
in the case of first authors (Fig. 1F). This result, consistently ob-
served across most robustness tests (Dataset S2), offers partial
support to the individual integrity hypothesis (Table 1).
The between–meta-analysis heterogeneity measured for all bias
patterns and risk factors was high (Fig. 1, Fig. S2, and Dataset S2),
suggesting that biases are strongly dependent on contingent
characteristics of each meta-analysis. The associations most con-
sistently observed, estimated as the value of between–meta-
analysis variance divided by summary effect observed, were, in
decreasing order of consistency, citation bias, small-study effects,
gray literature bias, and the effect of a retracted first author
(Fig. 1, bottom numbers).
Differences Between Disciplines and Domains. Part of the heteroge-
neity observed across meta-analyses may be accounted for at the
level of discipline (Fig. S3) or domain (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4), as
evidenced by the lower levels of heterogeneity and higher levels of
consistency observed within some disciplines and domains. The
social sciences, in particular, exhibited effects of equal or larger
magnitude than the biological and the physical sciences for most
of the biases (Fig. 2) and some of the risk factors (Fig. S4).
Trends over Time. We assessed whether the magnitude of bias
patterns or risk factors measured within meta-analyses had
changed over time, measured by year of publication of meta-
analysis. Because individual-level bibliometric information might
be less accurate going backwards in time, this analysis was limited
to study-level parameters. Across seven tested effects, we observed
a significant increase in the coefficients of collaboration distance
and small-study effects (respectively, b = 0.012 ± 0.005/y, b =
0.020 ± 0.010/y; Dataset S3). Analyses partitioned by domain
suggest that the social sciences, in particular, may have registered
a significant worsening of small-study effects, decline effect, and
social control effects (Fig. S5; see Dataset S4 for all numerical
results). These trends, however, were small in magnitude and not
consistently observed across robustness analyses (Dataset S4).
Robustness of Results. Similar results were obtained if analyses were
run including the noninterconvertible meta-analyses, although
doing so yields extreme levels of heterogeneity and implausibly
high regression coefficients in some disciplines (Dataset S5). We
also reached similar conclusions if we analyzed the sample using
multilevel weighted regression analysis. This method also allowed
us to test all variables in a multivariable model, which confirmed
that measured bias patterns and risk factors are all independent
from one another (see analyses and discussion in SI Multilevel Meta-
Regression Analysis, Multilevel Analyses, Relative Independence of
Biases). Country of activity of an author might represent a signifi-
cant confounding factor in our analyses, particularly if country is a
surrogate for the way research is done and rewarded. For example,
countries with incentives to publish may also have higher research
standards, on average. Moreover, the accuracy of individual-level
data may be lower for authors from many developing countries that
have limited presence in English-speaking journals. However, very
similar results were obtained when analyses were limited to studies
from authors based in the United States (Fig. S6).
Discussion
Our study asked the following question: “If we draw at random
from the literature a scientific topic that has been summarized by a
meta-analysis, how likely are we to encounter the bias patterns and
postulated risk factors most commonly discussed, and how strong
are their effects likely to be?” Our results consistently suggest that
small-study effects, gray literature bias, and citation bias might be
the most common and influential issues. Small-study effects, in
particular, had by far the largest magnitude, suggesting that these
are the most important source of bias in meta-analysis, which may
be the consequence either of selective reporting of results or of
genuine differences in study design between small and large
Fig. 2.
Bias patterns partitioned by disciplinary domain. Each panel reports
the second-order random-effects meta-analytical summaries of meta-regression
estimates (b ± 95% CI) measured across the sample of meta-analyses. Symbols
in parentheses indicate whether the association between factor and effect size
is predicted to be positive (+) or negative (−). The gray area within each circle is
proportional to the percentage of total variance explained by between–meta-
analysis variance (i.e., heterogeneity, measured by I2). To help visualize effect
sizes and statistical significance, numbers above error bars display t scores (i.e.,
summary effect size divided by its corresponding SE, b/SE) and conventional
significance levels (i.e., +P < 0.1, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). Numbers
below each error bar reflect the cross–meta-analytical consistency of effects,
measured as the ratio of between–meta-analysis SD divided by summary effect
size (i.e., τ/b; the smaller the ratio is, the higher the consistency). The sample
was partitioned between meta-analyses from journals classified based on dis-
cipline indicated in Thompson Reuters’ Essential Science Indicators database.

 studies. Furthermore, we found consistent support for common
speculations that, independent of small-study effects, bias is more
likely among early-career researchers, those working in small or
long-distance collaborations, and those that might be involved
with scientific misconduct.
Our results are based on very conservative methodological
choices (SI Limitations of Results), which allow us to draw several
conclusions. First, there is a good match between the focus of
meta-research literature and the actual prevalence of different
biases. Small-study effects, whether due to the file-drawer problem
or to heterogeneity in study design, are the most widely un-
derstood and studied problem in meta-analysis (1). Gray literature
bias, which partially overlaps but is distinct from the file-drawer
problem, is also widely studied and discussed, and so is citation
bias (1, 34). Moreover, we found at least partial support for all
other bias patterns tested, which confirms that these biases may
also represent significant phenomena. However, these biases
appeared less consistently across meta-analyses, suggesting that
they emerge in more localized disciplines or fields.
Second, our study allows us to get a sense of the relative
magnitude of bias patterns across all of science. Due to the limi-
tations discussed above, our study is likely to have underestimated
the magnitude of all effects measured. Nonetheless, the effects
measured for most biases are relatively small (they accounted for
1.2% or less of the variance in reported effect sizes). This suggests
that most of these bias patterns may induce highly significant
distortions within specific fields and meta-analyses, but do not
invalidate the scientific enterprise as a whole. Small-study effects
were an exception, explaining as much as 27% of the variance in
effect sizes. Nevertheless, meta-regression estimates of small-study
effects on odds ratio may run a modest risk of type I error (35) and
were measured by our study more completely and accurately than
the other biases (SI Multilevel Meta-Regression Analysis, Reliability
and Consistency of Collected Data). Therefore, whereas all other
biases in our study were measured conservatively, small-study ef-
fects are unlikely to be more substantive than what our results
suggest. Moreover, small-study effects may result not necessarily
from QRP but also from legitimate choices made in designing
small studies (17, 36). Choices in study design aimed at maxi-
mizing the detection of an effect might be justified in some
discovery-oriented research contexts (37).
Third, the literature on scientific integrity, unlike that on bias, is
only partially aiming at the right target. Our results supported the
hypothesis that early-career researchers might be at higher risk
from bias, largely in line with previous results on retractions and
corrections (16) and with predictions of mathematical models
(26). The reasons why early-career researchers are at greater risk
of bias remain to be understood. Our results also suggest that there
is a connection between bias and retractions, offering some support
to a responsible conduct of research program that assumes negli-
gence, QRP, and misconduct to be connected phenomena that may
be addressed by common interventions (38). Finally, our results also
support the notion that mutual control between team members
might protect a study from bias. The team characteristics that we
measured are very indirect proxies of mutual control. However, in a
previous study these proxies yielded similar results on retractions
and corrections (16), which were also significantly predicted by so-
ciological hypotheses about the academic culture of different
countries (a hypothesis that this study was not designed to test).
Therefore, our findings support the view that a culture of openness
and communication, whether fostered at the institutional or the
team level, might represent a beneficial influence.
Even though several hypotheses taken from the research in-
tegrity literature were supported by our results, the risk factors
that were not supported included phenomena that feature
prominently in such literature. In particular, the notion that
pressures to publish have a direct effect on bias was not supported
and even contrarian evidence was seen: The most prolific
researchers and those working in countries where pressures are
supposedly higher were significantly less likely to publish over-
estimated results, suggesting that researchers who publish more
may indeed be better scientists and thus report their results more
completely and accurately. A previous study testing the risk of
producing retracted and corrected articles, with the latter assumed
to represent a proxy of integrity, had similarly falsified the pres-
sures to publish hypothesis as conceptualized here (16), and so did
historical trends of individual publication rates (39). Therefore,
cumulating evidence offers little support for the dominant
speculation that pressures to publish force scientists to publish
excessive numbers of articles and seek high impact at all costs
(40–42). A link between pressures to publish and questionable
research practices cannot be excluded, but is likely to be modu-
lated by characteristics of study and authors, including the com-
plexity of methodologies, the career stage of individuals, and the
size and distance of collaborations (14, 39, 43). The latter two
factors, currently overlooked by research integrity experts, might
actually be growing in importance, at least in the social sciences
(Fig. S5).
In a previous, smaller study, two of us documented the US ef-
fect (14). We did measure again a small US effect but this may not
be easy to explain simply by pressures to publish, as previously
speculated. Future testable hypotheses to explain the US effect
include a greater likelihood of US researchers to engage in long-
distance collaborations and a greater reliance on early-career re-
searchers as first authors.
Other general conclusions of previous studies are at least par-
tially supported. Systematic differences in the risk of bias between
physical, biological, and social sciences were observed, particularly
for the most prominent biases, as was expected based on previous
evidence (5, 11, 33). However, it is not known whether the disci-
plinary and domain differences documented in this study are the
result of different research practices in primary studies (e.g., higher
publication bias in some disciplines) or whether they result from
differences in methodological choices made by meta-analysts of
different disciplines (e.g., lower inclusion of gray literature). Sim-
ilarly, whereas our results support previous observations that bias
may have increased in recent decades, especially in the social sci-
ences (11), future research will need to determine whether and to
what extent these trends might reflect changes in meta-analytical
methods, rather than an actual worsening of research practices.
In conclusion, our analysis offered a “bird’s-eye view” of bias in
science. It is likely that more complex, fine-grained analyses tar-
geted to specific research fields will be able to detect stronger
signals of bias and its causes. However, such results would be hard
to generalize and compare across disciplines, which was the main
objective of this study. Our results should reassure scientists that
the scientific enterprise is not in jeopardy, that our understanding
of bias in science is improving and that efforts to improve scientific
reliability are addressing the right priorities. However, our results
also suggest that feasibility and costs of interventions to attenuate
distortions in the literature might need to be discussed on a dis-
cipline- and topic-specific basis and adapted to the specific con-
ditions of individual fields. Besides a general recommendation to
interpret with caution results of small, highly cited, and early studies,
there may be no one-size fits-all solution that can rid science effi-
ciently of even the most common forms of bias.
Methods
During December 2013, we searched Thompson Reuters’ Web of Science data-
base, using the string (“meta-analy*” OR “metaanaly*” OR “meta analy*”) as
topic and restricting the search to document types “article” or “review.” Sam-
pling was randomized and stratified by scientific discipline, by restricting each
search to the specification of journal names included in each of the 22 disciplinary
categories used by Thompson Reuters’ Essential Science Indicators database.
These disciplines and the abbreviations used in Fig. 2 and Figs. S1 and S3 are the
following: AG, agricultural sciences; BB, biology and biochemistry; CH, chemistry;

PT, pharmacology and toxicology; SO, social sciences, general; and SP,
space sciences. Studies retrieved from MU were later reclassified based on topic.
In successive phases of selection, meta-analyses were screened for potential
inclusion (Fig. S1), based on the following inclusion criteria: (i) tested a specified
empirical question, not a methodological one; (ii) sought to answer such ques-
tion based on results of primary studies that had pursued the same or a very
similar question; (iii) identified primary studies via a dedicated literature search
and selection; (iv) produced a formal meta-analysis, i.e., a weighted summary of
individual outcomes of primary studies; and (v) the meta-analysis included at
least five independent primary studies (see SI Methods for details).
For each primary study in each included meta-analysis we recorded reported
effect size and measure of precision provided (i.e., confidence interval, SE, or N)
and we retrieved available bibliometric information, using multiple techniques
and databases and attempting to complete missing data with hand searches.
Further details of each parameter collected and how variables tested in the
study were derived are provided in SI Methods.
Each dataset was standardized following previously established protocols
(14). Moreover we inverted the sign of (i.e., multiplied by −1) all primary
studies within meta-analyses whose pooled summary estimates were smaller
than zero—a process known as “coining.” All analyses presented in the main
text refer to meta-analyses coined with a threshold of zero, whilst results
obtained with uncoined data and data with a more conservative coining
threshold are reported in Datasets S1–S5.
Each individual bias or risk factor was first tested within each meta-
analysis, using simple meta-regression. The meta-regression slopes thus
obtained were then summarized by a second-order meta-analysis, weighting
by the inverse square of their respective SEs, assuming random variance of
effects across meta-analyses.
We also analyzed data using weighted multilevel regression, a method
that yields similar but more conservative estimates (30). A complete discus-
sion of this method and all results obtained with it can be found in Sup-
porting Information.
