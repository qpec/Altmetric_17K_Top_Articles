Abstract
Transplantation of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) for repair of traumatic brain injury has been used in 
the clinic. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment has long been widely used as an adjunctive therapy for treating traumatic brain injury. 
UC-MSC transplantation combined with HBO treatment is expected to yield better therapeutic effects on traumatic brain injury. In this 
study, we established rat models of severe traumatic brain injury by pressurized fluid (2.5–3.0 atm impact force). The injured rats were then 
administered UC-MSC transplantation via the tail vein in combination with HBO treatment. Compared with monotherapy, aquaporin 4 
expression decreased in the injured rat brain, but growth-associated protein-43 expression, calaxon-like structures, and CM-Dil-positive 
cell number increased. Following combination therapy, however, rat cognitive and neurological function significantly improved. UC-MSC 
transplantation combined with HBO therapyfor repair of traumatic brain injury shows better therapeutic effects than monotherapy and 
significantly promotes recovery of neurological functions.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often followed by cerebral 
hypoxia and ischemia, alterations in biochemical indices, 
and severe brain function disorders, making clinical treat-
ment very difficult. Animal experiments (Guo et al., 2013; 
Jiao et al., 2013) have demonstrated that transplantation of 
human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-
MSCs) is an effective treatment method for neurological 
function impairment. The UC-MSCs transplanted into the 
injured brain tissue can differentiate into new neural cells 
that promote repair and regeneration of injured brain tissue 
and functional recovery. 
UC-MSCs exhibit strong proliferative ability, low immu-
nogenicity, and multi-potential differentiation, all of which 
contribute to the success of cell transplantation (Kunke et 
al., 2009). In the case of TBI, these transplanted cells under-
go cell division, proliferation, differentiation, integration, 
and migration, thereby exhibiting repairing effects (Yu et al., 
2014). However, the number of surviving UC-MSCs follow-
ing transplantation into the brain remains limited (Xiong 
et al., 2014). UC-MSCs can be transplanted to substitute or 
repair injured nerve cells with the hopes of establishing neu-
ral pathways and recovery of neuronal functions, although 
the local microenvironment determines the differentiation 
and survival rate of the transplanted UC-MSCs (Guo et al., 
2009). Although UC-MSC transplantation has been used in 
the clinic to treat traumatic brain injury, only a small num-
ber of transplanted UC-MSCs differentiate into mature neu-
rons, resulting in limited therapeutic effects (Chang et al., 
2011). 
Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been widely used 
in the clinic to effectively treat TBI (Chuang et al., 2011). 
There is evidence that HBO therapy can increase the arterial 
partial pressure of oxygen, enhance blood oxygen content, 
and promote aerobic metabolism in central nervous system 
tissue (Ding et al., 2012; Jasaitis, et al., 2012). 
Recent studies have demonstrated that effective and suc-
cessful TBI treatment involves the local hypoxic/ischemic 
brain microenvironment, as well as cell proliferation and 
tissue repair/regeneration in the injured brain region (Aries 
et al., 2012; Bor-Seng-Shu et al., 2012). HBO promotes pro-
liferation and differentiation of exogenous UC-MSCs and 
their migration toward injured brain tissue, protects injured 
brain cells, and reduces disabilities and mortality rates (Tong 
et al., 2010). However, the majority of existing studies have 
used only HBO therapy, with sub-par therapeutic effects. 
The present study hypothesized that UC-MSC transplanta-
tion in combination with HBO therapy has greater synergistic 
effects on the repair of TBI compared with monotherapy. 
Materials and Methods
Umbilical cord source
Umbilical cords were harvested from healthy fetuses deliv-
ered through uterine incision after 9 months of pregnancy in 
the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Renmin Hos-
pital of Wuhan University, China. Written informed consent 
was obtained from each included woman regarding use of 
umbilical cord and experimental purpose. The experimental 
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee, First Hos-
pital of Wuhan University, China. 
Animals
A total of 160 adult, specific pathogen-free, Sprague-Dawley 
(SD), 80 males and 80 females, weighing 300–350 g, were 
purchased from the Animal Center, Peking Union Medical 
College, China (license No. SCXK (Jing) 20070001).   
All rats were maintained and housed under controlled 
conditions (22°C), with a 12-hour reversed light/dark cycle 
and access to food and water ad libitum. All operations were 
performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to 
minimize pain and distress of the experiment animals. All 
animal experiments were performed in accordance with the 
United States National Institutes of Health Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 
85-23, revised 1986).
Primary culture and identification of UC-MSCs
The umbilical cords were thoroughly washed with phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS). After removal of the umbilical 
cord vessel, the left tissue was chopped into 1-mm
3 blocks, 
and digested with 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% collagenase II 
(Shanghai Alading Biochemistry Science & Technology, 
Shanghai, China) at 37°C. After centrifugation, the superna-
tant was removed, the cells were re-suspended with a suffi-
cient amount of culture medium, and cultured with DMEM 
containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Shanghai Alading Bio-
chemistry Science & Technology). After the first passage, 
the cells were sub-cultured once every 3 days at a 1:3 ratio. 
Passage 3 cells were digested and then treated with CD34, 
CD45, CD29, CD 90, CD105 and CD49 antibodies which 
were labeled by PE FITC. Flow cytometry was performed 
using a Flow Cytometer System (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, 
CA, USA). 
Chloromethyl-1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-
indocarbocyanine perchlorate (CM-Dil) labeling of 
UC-MSCs 
A total of 5 µL CM-Dil solution and 1 mL of complete 
culture medium was added to a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube 
and kept in the dark. The UC-MSCs that fully adhered to 
the culture flask were harvested. After removal of culture 
medium, the cells were washed three times with PBS and 
then incubated with the above-prepared CM-Dil labeling 
solution at 40 µL/cm
2 for 20 minutes in an incubator of 
saturated humidity at 37°C and 5% CO2 environment. Af-
ter removal of the CM-Dil labeling solution, 5 mL of 37°C 
complete culture medium was added. After a 10-minute 
incubation, the complete culture medium was discarded. 
Culture medium was added again and cells were washed 
three times with PBS. After 24 hours of culture, CM-Dil la-
beling and UC-MSC morphology were observed under an 
inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan, USA). 
During sub-culture, sufficient amounts of UC-MSCs were

used for flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) to detect the 
CM-Dil labeling rate. 
Establishment of TBI rat models and group management 
Rat models of severe TBI induced by pressurized fluid were 
used (Wang et al., 2000). In brief, after anesthesia by intra-
peritoneal injection of 20% urethane (1.2 g/kg; Shanghai 
Maikelin Biochemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), 
a cranial window was opened with the dura mater intact, 
which was then impacted once by pressurized fluid [2.5–3.0 
atm (253.3–304.0 kPa) impact force] using an internation-
ally standard lateral fluid percussion Injury device (CIC, 
USA). If lack of spontaneous breathing occurred after injury, 
an oxygen mask was provided. After another 24 hours, the 
rats were anesthetized again and the original bone window 
was opened for stereotaxic injection (ALC-IP600 animal 
brain stereotactic apparatus, Beijing, China). 
A total of 160 rat models of TBI were randomly assigned 
to four groups, with 40 rats per group. In the TBI group, 
rats were injected with 1 mL DMEM/F12 culture medium 
via  the tail vein. In the UC-MSC group, an equal amount 
of UC-MSCs suspension (1 × 10
10/L) was injected via the 
tail vein. In the UC-MSCs + HBO group, an equal amount 
of UC-MSCs suspension (1 × 10
10/L) was injected via  the 
tail vein and then the rats were placed in an HBO chamber 
(Weifang Huaxin Company, Weifang, Shandong Province, 
China). The HBO chamber was washed with pure oxygen 
for 10 minutes and pressurized at a speed of 0.01 MPa/min 
until 0.2 MPa was reached. After pressure stabilization for 30 
minutes, the HBO chamber was intermittently pressurized to 
> 96.5% and then decompressed at a constant speed for 10 
minutes until normal pressure was reached. Then rats were 
routinely housed outside the HBO chamber. HBO therapy 
was performed 4 times a day with 6-hour intervals for four 
successive days. In the HBO group, HBO treatment was ad-
ministered as described above.     
Six rats per group were selected for reverse transcrip-
tion-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot 
analysis; 10 rats per group for neurological function evalua-
tion; 10 rats per group for Morris water maze test; 6 rats per 
group for hematoxylin-eosin staining; and 6 rats per group 
for immunohistochemical staining, resulting in 38 rats per 
group and 2 extra rats. 
Detection of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and growth-associated 
protein-43 (GAP-43) mRNA expression
At 4 days after injury and following anesthesia, the rats 
were decapitated and 50 g brain tissue was harvested and 
homogenized. According to Trizol reagent instruction, total 
RNA was extracted from brain tissue and RNA levels were 
measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Shimad-
zu-3550, Tokyo, Japan). Using the two-step RT-PCR kit, 
mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and then PCR 
was performed. The primers used are shown in Table 1. PCR 
products were electrophoresed. The optical density of each 
band was analyzed using a gel image analysis system (Ta-
non-3500, Tokyo, Japan). The optical density ratio of GAP-
43 and AQP4 to β-actin was calculated and used as the rela-
tive mRNA expression of GAP-43 and AQP4. 
Western blot analysis of AQP4 and GAP-43 protein 
expression 
At 3–5 days after injury, the cell lysate remaining after RT-
PCR was centrifuged at 1,500 r/min for 30 minutes and 
the supernatant was collected for protein concentration 
measurements using the Bradford method. The sample was 
added to a 5% stacking gel and electrophoresed at a constant 
voltage of 40 V for 1 hour, followed by a 10% separating gel 
at a constant voltage of 60 V for 3.5 hours, and then sub-
sequently transferred to a membrane using a wet transfer 
method at a constant voltage of 14 V for 14 hours. The mem-
branes were then blocked at 37 °C for 2 hours while shaking, 
followed by three wash steps for 10 minutes each. Rabbit 
anti-rat AQP4/GAP-43 monoclonal antibodies (1:1,000; 
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) that were diluted to 1:200 were 
dissolved in TBST and incubated at room temperature for 60 
minutes. The membranes were then washed with above-pre-
pared TBST for 10 minutes, three times/minute, treated with 
horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 
at 1:500 (Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) 
at room temperature for 60 minutes, and then washed three 
times for 10 minutes each. Subsequently, the membranes 
were washed with Tris-buffered saline for 10 minutes and 
developed with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB). The optical 
density of AQP4 and GAP-43 products were measured by 
Quantity One analysis software (Beijing Dingguo Chang-
sheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The optical 
density ratios of AQP4 and GAP-43 expression to β-actin 
expression were used to determine relative AQP4 and GAP-
43 protein expressions. 
Neurological function assessment
Rat neurological function was assessed at 24 hours, 3 days, 
and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after traumatic brain injury using 
the neurological examination grading system of Bederson 
et al. (1986): grade 0, no observable deficit; 1, contralateral 
forelimb flexion; 2, decreased gripping ability of contra-
lateral forelimb when held by the tail; 3, automatic action,

Figure 3 TBI rat brain tissue morphology after UC-MSC transplantation in combination with HBO therapy (× 200). 
Upper panels: Hematoxylin-eosin staining results under optical microscope: in the TBI group, brain tissue exhibits a disordered structure, i.e., 
scar tissue with obvious cavitations; in the UC-MSC group and HBO group, sizes of scarring and softening foci are less than in the TBI group, but 
greater than in the UC-MSCs + HBO group. In the UC-MSCs + HBO group, cavities are obviously reduced. Lower panels: Immunohistochemical 
staining results under fluorescence microscope: The number of CM-Dil-positive cells (arrows; i.e., surviving UC-MSCs) is less in the UC-MSC 
group than in the UC-MSCs + HBO group. UC-MSCs: Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells; HBO: hyperbaric oxygen; TBI: traumatic

cal function. 
Morris water maze test
Within 1–5 days after UC-MSC transplantation, the Mor-
ris water maze test was performed to analyze learning and 
memory abilities (Li et al., 2011). The rats were allowed to 
acclimate to the environment by placing them for 10 sec-
onds on the platform in quadrant 3 (Q3). The rats were the 
randomly placed facing the wall in different quadrants, and 
the time spent from entry into the water to 5 seconds after 
climbing on the platform was recorded, with the longest 
time spent of 120 seconds. If the rats did not climb onto the 
platform within 120 seconds, they were guided to climb onto 
the platform and were allowed to remain on the platform 
for 10 seconds, after which they were returned to their cages. 
The rats were placed into the pool as mentioned above four 
times per day with 1-hour intervals. The time taken from 
entry into water to climbing onto the platform (i.e., escape 
latency) was recorded. The rats were allowed to freely swim 
in the same water maze without a platform for 60 seconds, 
and the percentage of time spent in Q3 (where platform was 
originally positioned) compared with total time (60 seconds) 
was calculated as an index to evaluate memory (i.e., percent-
age of swimming time spent in target quadrant).  
Hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical 
staining 
Four weeks after injury, the brain tissues were embedded 
in paraffin and sectioned for histological examination. Five 
minutes after hematoxylin-eosin staining, brain tissue slices 
were washed with tap water, differentiated in hydrochloric 
acid/ethanol for 10 seconds, washed with tap water, stained 
with eosin for 7 minutes, washed with tap water, dehydrated 
with ethanol gradients, cleared with xylene, and mounted 
in neutral gum. In the CM-Dil immunohistochemical stain-
ing protocols, the primary antibody was rabbit anti-rat IgG 
(1:1,000; Sigma), and the secondary antibody was goat an-
ti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000; Sigma). A 2-hour incubation was per-
formed at 25°C once after addition of primary antibody and 
again after addition of secondary antibody. Ten non-over-
lapping visual fields were selected from each slice under 200-
fold magnification. CM-Dil-positive cells (i.e., UC-MSCs) 
were quantified in the visual field, and the mean value across 
10 visual fields was calculated as the number of CD-Dil-pos-
itive cells per group. Image Pro-Plus 6.0 Software (Media 
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) was used to analyze 
the results. 
Statistical analysis 
All measurement data are expressed as the mean ± SD and 
were statistically analyzed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS, 
Chicago, IL, USA). One-way analysis of variance and the 
least significance difference were used for analysis of differ-
ences of the means among groups. A level of P < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. 
Results
UC-MSC morphology 
After 4–5 days in culture, there was an increased number of 
UC-MSCs that adhered to the flask wall. They appeared as 
long shuttle-shaped or polygonal cells. Some cell colonies 
grew in clusters with expanded somas. After 8–9 days in 
TBI                                                   HBO                                                        UC-MSCs                                            UC-MSCs+HBO

culture, the UC-MSCs were confluent, appeared to grow in 
a whirlpool-like manner, and the majority of UC-MSCs in 
the periphery appeared as radiating or whirlpool migrating 
shapes (Figure 1A). Flow cytometry showed that these cells 
were positive for CD34, CD45, CD29, CD90, CD105, and 
CD49, with good homogenicity and a > 97% purity. After 24 
hours in culture, CM-Dil-labeled UC-MSCs appeared as red 
fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 1B). 
Flow cytometry showed that cell-labeling rate was 100%. 
AQP4 and AQP-43 mRNA and protein expression in
injured rat brain tissue after UC-MSC transplantation in 
combination with HBO therapy   
RT-PCR and western blot assay showed that 4 days after 
UC-MSCs transplantation, AQP4 mRNA and protein ex-
pression in the injured rat brain tissue was greatest in the 
TBI group, followed by the UC-MSCs or HBO groups, and 
lowest in the UC-MSCs + HBO group (P < 0.05). GAP-43 
mRNA and protein expression in injured rat brain tissue 
was lowest in the TBI group, followed by the UC-MSCs or 
HBO group, and highest in the UC-MSCs + HBO group (P 
< 0.05) (Figure 2).

At 3–14 days after UC-MSC transplantation, scores revealing 
neurological deficits were greatest in the TBI group, followed 
by the UC-MSC group or HBO group, and lowest in the 
UC-MSCs + HBO group (P < 0.05). These results suggested 
that UC-MSC transplantation in combination with HBO 
therapy resulted in the best outcome as assessed by neuro-
logical functions (Table 2). 
Changes in learning and memory abilities in TBI rats after 
UC-MSCs transplantation in combination with HBO 
therapy   
Morris water maze test results showed that mean escape 
latency gradually decreased in each group. There was no 
significant difference in mean latency between groups at 1 
day after UC-MSC transplantation. Mean escape latency 
was significantly decreased in the UC-MSCs + HBO group 
compared with the TBI group at 2 days. Mean escape latency 
in the UC-MSCs + HBO group was significantly less than in 
the HBO group (P < 0.05), UC-MSC group (P < 0.05), or 
the TBI group (P < 0.01) at 3–5 days. The number of times 
that the rats crossed the platform and the percentage of swim-
ming time spent in the target quadrant compared with total 
time were significantly greater in the UC-MSCs + HBO group 
than in the HBO group (P < 0.05), UC-MSC group (P < 
0.05), or the TBI group (P < 0.01). These results showed that 
UC-MSCs + HBO treatment resulted in the best learning 
and memory scores, followed by UC-MSCs or HBO group, 
and worst in the TBI group (all P < 0.05) (Table 3). 
Morphological changes in TBI brain tissue after UC-MSC 
transplantation in combination with HBO therapy
Four weeks after transplantation, hematoxylin-eosin stain-
ing results in the TBI group revealed glial scarring, with 
some atrophy and softening foci. In the UC-MSCs and HBO 
groups, the injured brain tissue was filled with glial cells 
and glial fibers, and the sizes of scar and softening foci were 
smaller than in the TBI group, but larger than in the UC-
MSCs + HBO group. In the UC-MSCs + HBO group, the 
injured brain tissue was filled with glial cells and glial fi-
bers, increased number of neuraxon-like structures, lack of 
softening foci, and a small amount of scar tissue. Immuno-
histochemical staining results showed no CM-Dil-positive 
cells in the injured brain tissue in the TBI and HBO groups; 
the number of CM-Dil-positive cells was 30.53 ± 9.43/200-
fold visual field in the UC-MSC group and 54.21 ± 14.52/ 
200-fold visual field in the UC-MSCs + HBO group, with 
significantly less CM-Dil-positive cells in the UC-MSC 
group compared with the UC-MSCs + HBO group (P < 
0.01) (Figure 3). 
Discussion
HBO therapy alone does not result in ideal therapeutic ef-
fects on TBI. In the present study, we investigated the ther-
apeutic effects of UC-MSC transplantation in combination 
with HBO therapy on TBI. Our results showed that this 
combined therapy resulted in better therapeutic effects on 
TBI than monotherapy. There is also evidence that HBO 
therapy can decrease malonaldehyde and calcium ion levels 
(Fuentes-Raspall et al., 2011), inhibit lipid peroxidation, in-
crease the antioxidant activity of cell membranes, reduce in-
tracellular calcium ion inflow, protect neurons, and promote 
neural regeneration. HBO therapy given in the early stage 
of UC-MSC transplantation promotes UC-MSC prolifera-
tion and induces migration toward the injured area, reduces 
cell apoptosis, promotes cell survival, alleviates swelling in 
the injured region, and improves microcirculation (Lin et 
al., 2011). These findings suggest that HBO therapy for the 
treatment of TBI can increase UC-MSC survival, promote 
endogenous and exogenous neural cells to proliferate and 
differentiate into neurons, improve microcirculation of 
brain tissue cells, alleviate cerebral edema, and reduce injury. 
Future studies are needed to determine the involved cellular 
and molecular mechanisms of UC-MSC transplantation 
used in combination with HBO therapy. 
Results from the present study showed that HBO therapy 
promoted proliferation and differentiation of UC-MSCs and 
significantly improved neurological functions in a rat TBI 
model. There were, however, several limitations to this study. 
First, the sample size was small, and larger sample sizes 
should be used in future studies to increase result reliability. 
Second, we only transplanted human UC-MSCs into a rat 
model of injury, but did not perform human experiments. 
Therefore, different biological models should be used to val-
idate the generalization of these experimental results. Third, 
we did not investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in 
UC-MSC transplantation combined with HBO therapy. 
Taken together, HBO therapy promoted proliferation and 
differentiation of transplanted UC-MSCs and improved the 
local microenvironment. UC-MSC transplantation used in

combination with HBO therapy to treat a rat TBI model 
exhibits synergistic effects in terms of the promotion of neu-
rological function, the reconstruction of a local microenvi-
ronment for injured brain tissue. Therefore, this combined 
therapy holds great potential for clinical application.
