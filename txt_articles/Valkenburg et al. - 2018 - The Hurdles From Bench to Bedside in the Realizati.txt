Influenza viruses circulate worldwide causing annual epidemics that have a substantial 
impact on public health. This is despite vaccines being in use for over 70 years and 
currently being administered to around 500 million people each year. Improvements in 
vaccine design are needed to increase the strength, breadth, and duration of immunity 
against diverse strains that circulate during regular epidemics, occasional pandemics, and 
from animal reservoirs. Universal vaccine strategies that target more conserved regions 
of the virus, such as the hemagglutinin (HA)-stalk, or recruit other cellular responses, 
such as T cells and NK cells, have the potential to provide broader immunity. Many 
pre-pandemic vaccines in clinical development do not utilize new vaccine platforms 
but use “tried and true” recombinant HA protein or inactivated virus strategies despite 
substantial leaps in fundamental research on universal vaccines. Significant hurdles exist 
for universal vaccine development from bench to bedside, so that promising preclinical 
data is not yet translating to human clinical trials. Few studies have assessed immune 
correlates derived from asymptomatic influenza virus infections, due to the scale of a 
study required to identity these cases. The realization and implementation of a universal 
influenza vaccine requires identification and standardization of set points of protective 
immune correlates, and consideration of dosage schedule to maximize vaccine uptake.

iNTRODUCTiON
Influenza A viruses have over 18 different hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes, and continual antigenic drift 
of seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 viruses generates new variants. In addition, there are distinct lineages 
of influenza B viruses that also exhibit antigenic drift, meaning there is a plethora of influenza viruses 
that pose a threat to public health (1). Reports of global influenza infection rates estimate that up 
to 18% of the population can be infected during annual influenza epidemics (2), causing excess 
morbidity and mortality resulting in projected economic losses of nearly US$87 billion (3). Influenza 
vaccines are the most widely used vaccines in the world due to annual updates on circulating strains 
and health authority recommendations for at risk groups (4). The groups most commonly targeted 
for influenza vaccination programs are children and elderly, pregnant women, immunocompromised, 
and healthcare workers (HCWs). Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) administered intramuscularly

have been available since the 1940s and progressive developments 
have been made to increase breadth of immunity provided by 
the vaccine, from monovalent to bivalent and then trivalent, to 
most recently quadrivalent formulations (5). The use of split and 
subunit vaccines has provided a more purified formulation, and 
the use of improved adjuvants with reduced side effects in recent 
years, such as MF59 and AS03 has enabled antigen sparing and 
increased immunogenicity of vaccine antigens (5, 6). One impor-
tant advance was the release of live-attenuated influenza vaccines 
(LAIV) by MedImmune to American markets in 2003, delivered 
as a nasal spray (7). The quadrivalent cell-grown recombinant 
HA protein vaccines, FluCelVax (Seqirus) available from 2012 
(8) and FluBlok (Sanofi Pasteur) available from 2013 (9), provide 
an expedient pipeline for pandemic vaccine responsiveness and 
avoid egg adaptations generated during vaccine production.
A combination of issues exists for the current influenza vac-
cines (10), including egg adaptations (11), lag between strain 
selection and vaccine availability (10), and breadth and duration 
of immunity (12). Annual vaccine effectiveness (VE) is variable 
and contingent upon antigenic distance between vaccine and 
circulating strains and the individual’s immune history (13). 
Shortcomings in VE for IIV and LAIV are repeatedly reported 
with a recent average VE found to be 78.4% and 30.7% against 
H1N1pdm09 infections, respectively, in 2- to 17-year olds in 
2015/2016 in the UK, US, Canada, and Finland (14), while IIV 
VE reported by the CDC ranges from 10 to 60% from 2004 to 
2016 (15). Therefore, current vaccines are not effective enough, 
with negative or low VE reported, and LAIV does not appear to 
improve upon VE over IIV consistently (16–18), hence, the need 
for universal vaccines. Furthermore, current IIV VE decreased 
over time by one-third from 3 to 6 months post vaccination (19), 
and reduced VE estimates over time were seen for LAIV (20, 21). 
Targeting the elderly for vaccination is a logical step as they are 
the demographic that have the highest morbidity and mortality 
risk from an influenza virus infection; however, current vaccines 
are even less effective at conferring protection within this suscep-
tible age group (22).

WHO published in 2017 the Preferred Product Char 
acteristics 
for Next-Generation Influenza Vaccines which lays out the targets 
for influenza vaccine development over the next 5 and 10 years 
(23). In the first 5 years, the WHO encourages the evaluation of 
currently available vaccine and vaccine technologies to achieve 
greater protection against vaccine-matched or drifted influenza 
strains and protection against severe influenza for at least 1 year. 
In 10 years, by 2027, the WHO encourages research and develop-
ment in next-generation vaccines to provide universal protection 
against severe influenza A illness for at least 5 years. In addition, 
a strategic work plan for the design of a universal vaccine has 
been outlined by the NIH NIAID (10, 24, 25). To achieve the goal 
of a universal influenza vaccine capable of providing protection 
beyond 1 year and with broader immunity against antigenically 
diverse strains, the work plan identified areas for expanded 
research efforts to address this goal, with an emphasis on research 
in the areas of (1) influenza transmission, natural history, and 
pathogenesis; (2) development of influenza immunity and corre-
lates of protection; and (3) rational design of universal influenza 
vaccines.
Ultimately, an ideal universal influenza vaccine would provide 
protection (1) against seasonal influenza epidemics by drift vari-
ants between seasons or pan-influenza A and B viruses, (2) against 
influenza pandemics with limited prior population immunity, 
and (3) against zoonotic (e.g., avian) influenza infections with 
severe disease outcomes. However, this “ideal” vaccine is still 
stuck at the laboratory bench (26), with fundamental questions 
about immune correlates of protection required for universal 
protection against influenza viruses yet to be answered.

Timing of Priming for T Cell immunity
Existing inactivated virus-based vaccine technologies could be 
improved to increase the strength and duration of the vaccine-
induced responses to overcome seasonal influenza epidemics of 
drifted variants. While natural infection may generate protective 
immunity for 2–10 years (2, 27), it has been reported that IIV 
sero-protection fell below 60% one year after vaccination (28). 
Therefore, bridging the gap between protection afforded by infec-
tion and vaccination, by defining immune correlates of protection 
(Table 1) associated with better outcomes of natural infection, 
severity of infection, and the protection afforded by current and 
other next-generation vaccines in clinical development (Table 2) 
is critical to future vaccine design.
Live-attenuated influenza vaccines have been shown to induce 
T cell responses in children but not adults (58), and in particular 
children under 10 years of age have greater T cell boosting (59). In 
mice, early-priming preserves optimal influenza-specific CD8+ 
T cell function and diversity and protects against age-related 
immune decline (60), with similar age-associated effects of VE 
observed for LAIV (20). Furthermore, the thymus involutes dur-
ing puberty greatly reducing naïve T cell output, while “inflam-
maging” impacts T cell priming (61). In another study, memory 
CD8+ T cells have been observed and stable longitudinally for 
over more than a 10-year period, most likely due to multiple re-
infections since childhood (27). It is likely that repeated boosting 
of T cell immunity to conserved, immunodominant epitopes of 
NP and M1 antigens (62) results in long-term maintenance of 
T cell responses associated with protection from symptomatic 
infection (2). In older adults, individuals who received 3–4 years 
of annual repeated IIV vaccination, rather than single vaccina-
tion, had higher response magnitude, long-term durability, and 
multifunctional quality cross-reactive memory CD4+ T cells (63). 
Indeed, the T cell-based modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) 
vector expressing NP + M1 influenza vaccine (MVA-NP + M1) 
could boost antigen-specific T cell memory responses in adults

over 65 years of age (64). The promising MVA-NP + M1, which 
is currently in phase II clinical trials (Table 2), has been proposed 
to be used in conjunction with current IIV (65) and shown to 
broaden both humoral and cellular immunity. Therefore, a win-
dow for priming optimal T cell immunity with longevity exists 
and could be considered for vaccine design to maintain effective 
T cell immunity.
In humans, the lungs are enriched with CD8+ T resident 
memory (TRM) that rapidly generate effector cytokines upon 
influenza infection (66). Furthermore, prime-pull strategies have 
been tested in mouse studies to seed local TRM responses (67), 
whereby a vaccine is given first parentally, i.e., intramuscularly 
like traditional vaccination route, to prime the T cell responses; 
and then inflammatory or secondary vaccine is given locally, 
 
i.e., intranasally, to pull responses to the lung, but this has had 
limited effect in the lung where cognate antigen presentation is 
required to maintain TRM (68).
However, the protective efficacy of localized TRM responses 
vs. circulating responses can only be tested in animal models. 
 
A 7-month limitation of protection has been identified by 
 5

lung-resident TRM in mouse models (69), but may not reflect the 
decay of human peripheral T cell memory in labeling and track-
ing studies (70). Whether lung TRM have a similar critical role 
in modulating disease outcome in humans is unknown, but it is 
essential to be understood for optimal vaccine design.
Stalling of the HA-Stalk
Development of next-generation vaccines that provide broader 
immune responses will be needed to protect against influenza 
pandemics and zoonotic influenza infections. A consensus on 
immune arms which are capable of providing broader immunity 
are split over a dichotomy, which are focused on either the anti-
HA-stalk antibodies or T cell immunity. Theoretically, a HA-stalk 
vaccine has an exciting and promising potential, with subtype 
specific, multigroup, and even pan-influenza A and B antibodies 
being identified (71). Impressive in vitro and animal studies have 
shown the breadth of HA-stalk antibodies, yet passive transfer in 
human clinical trials have shown high concentrations are needed 
but with little therapeutic effect (72). While HA-stalk antibodies 
have been found to be enriched in some individuals infected with 
the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, these antibodies are notoriously 
low in frequency with universal antibodies such as F10 represent-
ing only 0.001% of circulating antibodies (73). There is a paucity 
of data on the protective role of HA-stalk antibodies in human 
infection studies (46) (Table 1). A human challenge study found 
that higher baseline level hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) 
antibodies were accompanied by increased HA-stalk-specific 
antibodies and reduced viral shedding but not symptom severity, 
while anti-neuraminidase (NAI) antibodies were the strongest 
correlate of protection (CoP) for symptomatic infection (46). 
Therefore, the independent role of HA-stalk antibodies remains to 
be defined separately from HAI and NAI antibodies. Ultimately, 
harnessing HA-stalk-specific B cells capable of universal immu-
nity may also require repeated boosting to overcome immune 
waning, which limits the duration of current IIV.
Alternative Strategies in Development
There are a large number of universal vaccine strategies in devel-
opment in animal models, and only 61 in phase I and 189 in phase 
II clinical trials (Table 2) which are designed for pandemic poten-
tial viruses (56), and in total only 12.8% of these are designed to 
be effectively T cell stimulating (74). Apart from HA, additional 
viral proteins including the NP, NA, M1, and M2, are proposed 
to be possible targets for universal vaccines (75). Cross-reactive 
antibodies against these viral proteins from different subtypes 
have been identified and they are shown to have heterosubtypic 
protective effects in animals and humans. Various strategies using 
recombinant proteins/peptides, recombinant DNA, recombinant 
RNA, virus-like particles, viral vectors, and synthetic viruses for 
inducing heterosubtypic protective effects have been reported. 
Some of these approaches do not only aim at inducing broadly 
reactive antibodies but also cross-reactive T cell immunity 
against influenza infections. Clinical trials of experimental 
vaccines, such as proteasomal adjuvanted IIV by nasal delivery 
and MVA-NP + M1 have been assessed by experimental chal-
lenge and immune correlates of protection evaluated (Table 1). 
Previous reports also show many experimental vaccines are not 
undergoing clinical trials or approved for human use, suggesting 
a bottleneck to preclinical development (76), which could be 
attributed to limitations of some animal models to show vaccine 
efficacy or support needed from industry funding for increasing 
scale of clinical studies (Table 2).

Correlating immune Responses to 
infection and illness Severity
Hemagglutination inhibition and single radial hemolysis assays 
are the only accepted serological methods used both in the US 
and Europe for accelerated licensure of seasonal IIV and only 
recognized immune CoPs for influenza currently (77–79). Other 
candidates of CoPs (Table 1) have been evaluated against experi-
mental or natural human influenza virus infections and vaccine 
efficacy studies. The route of vaccination (intramuscular or intra-
nasal) determines systemic vs. local immunity, and variability in 
sampling techniques at the mucosa may hinder the precise evalu-
ation of mucosal antibody responses (53). Furthermore, different 
CoPs may be identified depending on the outcome measure that 
is used across the spectrum of severity, for example, from asymp-
tomatic infection to severe illness leading to hospitalization. 
Therefore, the context under which each CoP was determined 
should be considered, and a comprehensive analytical approach 
is needed for clinical studies (80).
Cellular immunity is important for protection from 
clinical disease. For example, the Flu Watch study highlighted 
NP-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells correlated with lower nasal 
viral shedding (2). Other studies identified dysregulation of 
cytokines (namely, IL-10, MCP3, and IL-6) (35) and reduced 
cellular responses (including T, NK, and MAIT cells) (39, 40, 
42) are associated with severe disease. The baseline presence 
and increasing titer of secreted IgA (33, 47) and NAI (30, 32, 
45, 46) have also been identified across studies and appear as more 
effective correlates of protection from symptomatic infection 
than HAI. In addition, reports are emerging that HA-stalk (46) 
and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-activating 
antibodies (51) have been associated with reduced viral titers 
upon infection. de Vries et al. showed HA-stalk-specific ADCC 
responses were boosted in children post-infection (81), while 
H7-cross-reactive ADCC antibodies were cumulative and detect-
able from 2 years of age but plateauing by 17 years of age (82). Early 
exposures to influenza boost ADCC antibodies, while older adults 
have limited rises in ADCC antibodies post-infection (83). A titer 
of HA-specific ADCC antibodies >320 correlated with reduced 
risk of infection, symptom scores, and viral shedding in a human 
challenge study (51).
While a HAI titer of 40 is believed to provide 50% protection from 
symptomatic infection (84), new thresholds are being defined for 
T cell immunity. IIV does not effectively boost T cell immunity, 
hence the need for new universal vaccines. The longevity derived 
from memory generated by natural infection is also limited, with

repeated infection during our lifetime, estimated every 2–10 years 
(2, 27). Therefore, universal vaccines will need to do better than 
nature to provide longer duration immunity from symptomatic 
infection. From community cohort studies with baseline samples 
prior to symptomatic infection, Hayward et al. (2) defined the 
protective threshold for symptomatic infection as >20 SFU/106 
PBMCs (by stimulation with overlapping peptides for NP/M1); 
and from a LAIV children cohort study Forrest et al. (20) defined 
protective T cell threshold for symptomatic influenza infection 
as evaluated by ELISPOT was >100 SFU/106 PBMCs. Inactivated 
vaccination from the study by Koutsakos et al. resulted in a modest 
boost of influenza-specific CD4+ T cells, while CD8+ T cells were 
not boosted (85). While CD4+ T follicular helper cells (Tfh), cor-
relate with greater antibody production and HAI titers (86), and 
are therefore important for current IIV efficacy. Future universal 
vaccines need to overcome limited immunogenicity of inacti-
vated and LAIV vaccines by more immunogenic vaccine vectors 
(74). While universal vaccines, such as MVA-NP + M1, which 
uses systemic vaccination of a one-step replication vector encod-
ing conserved NP and M1 proteins, boosted influenza-specific 
CD8+ T cells in adults over >65 years of age (64), a notoriously 
difficult population for increased cellular immunity. Therefore, 
universal vaccines in development already show improved ability 
to establish T cell memory.
The immune correlates of protection from influenza are mostly 
derived from the comparison of infected subjects on a spectrum 
of severity (Table 1). However, there is a difference between corre-
lates of protection against all infection vs. correlates of protection 
against symptomatic infection. Furthermore, studies of current 
IIV for boosting of T cell responses as correlates of protection are 
not ideal as IIV is not designed to stimulate cellular immunity 
and can impinge the cellular immunity that is being developed 
during natural infection (87). Rather, studies of uninfected but 
exposed and asymptomatic cases (low or no viral shedding) from 
naturally acquired infection could define immune correlates on a 
larger scale than possible with human challenge studies (Table 1) 
(2, 29, 30).
Limitations by Prior immunity
Prior immunity may impact vaccine efficacy, original antigenic 
sin, and similarly “HA-imprinting” may skew antibody and 
CD4+ T cell helper profiles by the viral subtype in the first expo-
sure (88, 89). Furthermore, the level of neutralizing antibodies 
in a population will affect influenza transmission, and Bolton 
et al. proposed that T cell activating vaccines will have different 
efficacy depending on the population’s prior immunity (90). For 
example, due to prior immunity to seasonal H3N2 viruses but 
not to avian H7N9 viruses, a T cell-activating vaccine would 
be more efficacious for H7N9 viruses. Vaccinating an immune 
population with biased prior immunity may reduce vaccine 
efficacy, and universal vaccine strategies may differ by age group 
due to HA imprinting and immunosenescence. Therefore, use 
of a universal vaccine in younger demographics could exploit 
immunological imprinting to their advantage. Previously, high-
antibody titers generated from childhood influenza infections 
which were maintained have been seen to be cross-reactive to 
antigenically drifted strains (91, 92).
On the other hand, seasonal influenza vaccination history 
may not always play a positive role in heterologous protection 
against subsequent influenza infection. Bodewes et al. (87) 
have compared the influenza A virus-specific cellular and 
humoral responses between 14 annually immunized children 
with cystic fibrosis and 27 unvaccinated healthy control 
children during winter season 2009–2010. A similar level of 
influenza-specific CD4+ T cell responses and neutralizing 
antibody titers were found between vaccinated and unvac-
cinated groups of children, but an age-dependent increase in 
the frequency of virus-specific CD8+ T cells were only observed 
in unvaccinated children. These findings indicated repeated 
annual influenza vaccinations might hamper the development 
of influenza A virus-specific CD8+ T cell immunity. One report 
in mice recently from Rowell et al. (93) also addressed such 
issue, which presented varied heterologous protection from a 
candidate universal influenza vaccine (A/NP + M2-rAd) fol-
lowing a history of conventional IIV vaccination. Interestingly, 
they found that humoral and cellular responses induced by 
universal vaccine could be enhanced, inhibited, or unaffected 
by selected prior vaccinations, and such variations may be 
affected by many factors including vaccine preparation and 
specific vaccine components.
Standardization of Assays and Findings 
Across Studies
Community cohort studies to identify natural influenza virus 
infections and measure immunity are established in the UK (2), 
US (94), Vietnam (95), Hong Kong (96, 97), China (98), and 
Nicaragua (99) with recruitment and experiments ongoing, mak-
ing this area of research an exciting area to watch. The seasonality 
of influenza and year-to-year variation in infectivity of viruses 
requires these studies to span multiple years to generate robust 
data, for example, the Flu Watch study spanned 2006–2011 to 
capture 205 infections from baseline responses (2). Peripheral 
blood sampling will continue to be a proxy for cellular immune 
correlates for influenza virus infection, and simplified and 
standardized assays for immune signatures or biomarkers may 
aid future vaccine trials (Table 2).
One of the challenges in conducting studies to identify new 
correlates of protection is the sample size required. Typical 
community-based studies can follow up more than a thousand 
people over multiple years (2, 30, 97), measuring immune status 
before the season as baseline immunity and then identifying 
infections after influenza activity. Dunning et al. commented 
that data from 1,000 to 2,000 persons may be needed for a 
reasonably precise estimate of an influenza CoP (49). However, 
such sample size is logistically challenging, and the size scale of 
existing studies ranged from 16 to 226 infected individuals to 
stratify cases by severity to derive immune correlates (Table 1), 
and community cohort studies such as those by Sridhar et al. (25 
cases from 342 participants) (29), Hayward et al. (205 cases from 
1,414 participants) (2), and Couch et al. (226 cases from 1,509 
participants) (30). The scale of vaccine efficacy trials precludes 
many vaccine studies, especially considering the need to show 
an improved standard of care from current IIV, which can be

reasonable when well-matched viruses are in circulation but are 
limited for novel viruses.
The French Interior Milieu project (100) has provided base-
line immune responses of 1,000 individuals over 2 time-points, 
sampled the individual’s genetic background, skin biopsy, nasal 
swab, urine, and fecal samples, and uses 10 unique panels by flow 
cytometry, and 40 stimuli for characterizing adaptive and innate 
cellular responses. The panels measure in parallel innate cells and 
adaptive cells, including innate lymphoid cells, NK cells, mucosal 
associated invariant T cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, B cells, 
and T cells (1, 2, 17, reg). Stimulation determines the individual’s 
ability to respond to viral, microbial, agonists, and ligands, such 
as influenza and Sendai viruses, Helicobacter pylori, Poly I:C, 
Flagellin, TNFα, and CD3 + CD28 (101). The implementation 
of standardized assays, such as the stimulation of PBMCs with 
influenza viruses directly at blood collection by TruCulture 
tubes, was essential for multicenter experimental success (102). 
However, due to the use of an archetypal and outdated laboratory 
strain, A/Puerto Rico 8/1934, the results in regard to determin-
ing relevant baseline influenza virus-specific immunity were 
obsolete. The study protocols from the Interior Milieu project 
are now being extrapolated to other ethnicities and countries to 
provide a spectrum of a “healthy” baseline immune system and 
may provide a model for assays on a larger scale beyond HAI 
needed for universal vaccine design. The feasibility and scale 
of larger community cohort studies is beyond the capacity of a 
single research group for processing, storage, and experimental 
measures (80, 103) and needs commercial partners. Therefore, 
consensus and synergy with other established cohorts and net-
work design to share expertise is essential to get past the bench to 
define quantifiable thresholds of immune correlates of protection.

Once a vaccine has been licensed to be truly effective within a 
population a certain coverage threshold must be reached. In 2009, 
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control set out 
to achieve 75% influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly and 
those suffering from chronic medical conditions by the winter 
season 2014/15. However, this target was only reached by one 
EU Member State in the 2013/14 season and during the 2014/15 
influenza season no Member States were able to reach this 
coverage rate (104). Whereas the vaccination coverage rate for 
adults aged 18-64 years is even lower, reaching only 36.7% dur-
ing 2013–2014 in the US (105). This demonstrates that current 
approach to vaccination, in the case of influenza, is insufficient 
and even with the development of novel vaccines, strategies for 
their implementation needs to be carefully considered.
Considerations and Strategies to increase 
Accessibility and Uptake
The live-attenuated influenza vaccine only represents 8% of the 
vaccine market share (106), and production in the US has been 
threatened by low VE in recent years. Other enhanced influenza 
vaccines, such as QIV Fluzone by intradermal vaccination 
(107), have also been threatened by a dwindling market share. 
Combination and heterologous approaches may complicate 
adherence to vaccine schedules. Various methods have been 
developed to stimulate HA-stalk antibodies, such as HA-headless 
or chimeric HA, and combination strategies of prime boost for 
four doses (108). However, anti-HA-stalk antibody-stimulating 
vaccine regimes by heterologous prime boost used in mouse stud-
ies to elicit HA-stalk antibody responses may not be feasible in 
practice in the community, with each regime requiring separate 
licensure and multiple doses reducing vaccine adherence. The 
human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vac-
cines both require a homologous 3-dose regime within 2 years 
for optimal sero-protection, and HBV also requires a 10-year 
dose booster. Adherence to HPV vaccine 3-dose schedule is 
only 28% (109), and similarly 29% for HBV vaccination (110). 
A comprehensive vaccination record system will be instrumental 
for orderly vaccination schedules.
An increasingly difficult barrier to successful vaccination 
strategies is “vaccine hesitancy.” The WHO Strategic Advisory 
Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization has defined vaccine 
hesitancy as a “delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite 
availability of vaccination services” (111). Vaccine hesitancy can 
develop into refusal and the encouragement of others to refuse 
vaccination, leading to unvaccinated clusters within a community 
and severe public health consequences. One of the more concern-
ing effects of vaccine hesitancy is the effect on vaccination cover-
age in HCWs. Vaccination for HCWs is recommended in most 
countries but mandatory vaccination programs vary. A survey of 
HCWs in China found a coverage rate of only 9.5% in the seasons 
of 2009/2010 to 2011/2012 (112). However, vaccination in HCWs 
in the US has increased since the 2010/2011 season, reaching 
64.8% in 2014/2015 (113), demonstrating this issue varies greatly 
by country due to policy decisions and cultural factors. If HCWs 
themselves are hesitant about current vaccines, novel vaccines 
that utilize “non-traditional” approaches for universal immunity 
may require extensive explanation and promotion to HCWs to 
encourage self-vaccination and increase vaccine recommenda-
tions to patients.
indirect Protection in the Community with 
vaccine Uptake
Many studies have shown that increasing vaccination uptake 
in children and younger adults reduces influenza burden in 
older adults (114–116, 117). Older children and adolescents 
have been shown to be the key age groups affecting the initial 
spread of influenza infections within a community (118). 
Elderly individuals often come into contact with children and 
young adults in household and urban settings, public areas and 
transportation. One of the clearest examples of this was seen 
in Japan, when influenza vaccination of school children ceased 
in 1994, leading to an increase in elderly mortality rates (119). 
 
A study analyzing US vaccine data also found that in areas where 
there was ≥31% vaccine coverage in younger adults, the elderly 
had a 20.6% lower chance of being diagnosed with influenza than 
in areas with a ≤15% coverage rate (120). Vaccination of healthy

children could also form the basis of establishing early T cell 
memory and broader HA imprinting from an immunological 
perspective.
CONCLUSiON
Universal influenza vaccine research is a growing trend (Figure 1), 
with first reports in the 1970s of heterologous immunity in 
the absence of antibodies for recombinant vaccines being 
developed following the antigenic switch from H1N1 to H3N2 
viruses (121). A large increase in the universal vaccine research 
field has been seen since 2003, coinciding with zoonotic infec-
tions from avian and equine sources and pandemic viruses 
becoming a real threat to public health. Therefore, the drive for 
increased breadth of coverage for influenza vaccine has been 
a long-term objective, and the recent NIAID push has been 
a “call to arms” to address this issue. An increasing number 
of immune biomarkers that are associated with protection 
against influenza virus infection and disease severity in vitro 
and in vivo have been identified, leading to vaccines designed 
to elicit these immune markers at different stages of clinical 
trials. Such a strategy assumes that these markers are correlates 
of protection in humans, but whether such assumptions hold is 
yet to be confirmed in large epidemiological studies. Ultimately, 
immune correlates should be compared in parallel and defined 
within a weighted hierarchy to drive vaccine design which 
can stimulate multiple immune arms effectively. Alternatively, 
despite measurable influenza-specific T and B cell immunity, 
all healthy adults experience repeat infections in their lifetime. 
Additionally the WHO goals to promote longevity of responses 
may also require a vaccine that elicits a “better than nature” 
response. With increased attention and funding for this area, 
particularly from the National Institutes of Health, there is real 
hope for the successful development of universal influenza 
vaccines.
