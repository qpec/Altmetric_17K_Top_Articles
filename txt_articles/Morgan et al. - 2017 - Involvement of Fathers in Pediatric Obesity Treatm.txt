abstract
CONTEXT: Despite their important influence on child health, it is assumed that fathers are less 
likely than mothers to participate in pediatric obesity treatment and prevention research.
OBJECTIVE: This review investigated the involvement of fathers in obesity treatment and 
prevention programs targeting children and adolescents (0–18 years).
DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of English, peer-reviewed articles across 7 databases. 
Retrieved records included at least 1 search term from 2 groups: “participants” (eg, child*, 
parent*) and “outcomes": (eg, obes*, diet*).
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing behavioral interventions to 
prevent or treat obesity in pediatric samples were eligible. Parents must have “actively 
participated” in the study.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted data using a predefined template.
RESULTS: The search retrieved 213 eligible RCTs. Of the RCTs that limited participation to 1 
parent only (n = 80), fathers represented only 6% of parents. In RCTs in which participation 
was open to both parents (n = 133), 92% did not report objective data on father involvement. 
No study characteristics moderated the level of father involvement, with fathers 
underrepresented across all study types. Only 4 studies (2%) suggested that a lack of fathers 
was a possible limitation. Two studies (1%) reported explicit attempts to increase father 
involvement.
LIMITATIONS: The review was limited to RCTs published in English peer-reviewed journals over 
a 10-year period.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing pediatric obesity treatment or prevention programs with parent 
involvement have not engaged fathers. Innovative strategies are needed to make 
participation more accessible and engaging for fathers.

Obesity is associated with numerous 
physical and psychological health 
consequences for children. 
1 
– 
3 
Escalating childhood obesity rates 
remain a global public health 
concern. 
4 Poor lifestyle behaviors 
have greatly contributed to this issue, 
with few children and adolescents 
meeting diet and physical activity 
recommendations internationally.5 
– 
7 
Childhood obesity also tracks 
throughout life. 
8 Compared with 
healthy-weight peers, overweight 
children are 4 times more likely to 
become obese adolescents, 
 
9 and 
overweight/obese adolescents are 
5 to 7 times more likely to become 
overweight/obese adults.10, 
 
11 
Although a plethora of studies 
have examined the efficacy of 
pediatric obesity treatment and 
prevention interventions, progress 
has been modest. 
12, 
 
13 Identifying 
innovative strategies to improve 
health outcomes for children and 
adolescents remains an international 
research priority.
Parents have a profound influence 
on their children’s weight status and 
lifestyle behaviors through their own 
behaviors, parenting practices, and 
role in shaping the food and physical 
activity environment at home. 
14 
– 
16 As 
such, identifying the most effective 
ways to engage parents in pediatric 
obesity treatment and prevention 
has become an important area of 
research. Although there is some 
evidence for the efficacy of family-
based approaches, 
 
17, 
18 the optimal 
nature of parental involvement 
remains unclear. 
13, 
 
19 In particular, 
researchers have called for greater 
and more meaningful involvement 
of fathers, 
 
20 
–22 who are assumed to 
participate less often than mothers in 
research studies.
In general, most parenting 
interventions to date have targeted 
mothers because of the historical 
nature of mothers as the primary 
socialization agent. 
23, 
 
24 As such, 
the potential underrepresentation 
of fathers in childhood obesity 
treatment and prevention research 
would align with a general trend 
observed in other fields of research 
including pediatric psychology 
treatment, 
 
25 developmental 
psychopathology, 
 
26 and general 
parenting research.27, 
 
28 However, 
this paradigm has become outdated 
as a growing body of research has 
revealed that fathers have a profound 
and independent influence on their 
children’s health and development. 
29, 
 
30 
Moreover, fathers appear to have a 
particularly important influence on 
key behaviors such as their children’s 
physical activity 
31– 
33 and dietary 
habits, 
 
34 
– 
36 which are intrinsically 
linked to child weight status. A 
longitudinal study of 3285 families 
identified that children with an obese 
father, but a healthy-weight mother, 
were 15 times more likely to be 
obese than children with healthy-
weight parents.37 In contrast, having 
an obese mother but a healthy-
weight father did not increase the 
risk of childhood obesity. 
37
These findings suggest that failing to 
include fathers in childhood obesity 
treatment and prevention efforts may 
have considerable consequences for 
intervention efficacy. Indeed, scholars 
have argued that implementing 
parenting programs without 
meaningful father engagement is 
akin to poor practice, leads to wasted 
resources, provides incomplete 
evaluation, and may undermine the 
duty of care that researchers and 
practitioners have to optimize child 
well-being. 
28 This practice also places 
disproportionate responsibility on 
mothers who already spend more 
hours on household and child-
rearing tasks, even when they work 
outside the home. 
38 In response, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
recently published a clinical report 
highlighting the need to encourage 
and support father involvement in 
pediatric care through all stages of 
child development. 
39
Although it is generally accepted 
that mothers are much more 
likely than fathers to participate in 
childhood obesity prevention and 
treatment research, 
 
20 
– 
22 this problem 
has never been systematically 
investigated. As such, the scope 
of the imbalance remains unclear, 
and little is currently known about 
how best to engage fathers in future 
interventions. 
40 To address this 
evidence gap and encourage an 
informed discourse about the role of 
fathers in future studies, this review 
was conducted to investigate the 
following 4 research questions:
1. What is the involvement of fathers 
in pediatric obesity treatment 
and prevention programs when 
participation is limited to 1 parent 
per family?
2. What is the involvement of 
fathers when both parents can 
participate?
3. Are fathers more or less likely to 
participate in studies with certain 
characteristics (eg, diet versus 
exercise; obesity prevention 
versus treatment)?
4. How many studies explicitly 
attempted to increase the 
recruitment of fathers or 
identified a lack of fathers as a 
possible study limitation?
METHODS
The conduct and reporting of this 
review adhered to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) statement. 
41
Eligibility Criteria
Eligibility criteria were as follows:
1. Study was a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT).
2. Study explicitly targeted and 
reported outcomes for adiposity, 
physical activity, diet, and/or 
sedentary behavior in children 
aged 0 to 18 years.
3. Study promoted behavior change 
rather than solely examining

the effect of weight loss or a 
prescribed diet or physical activity 
regimen on clinical biomarkers. 
Drug trials were not eligible.
4. At least 1 intervention arm 
included an “interactive” parent 
component (eg, family counseling 
sessions, parent-child home 
tasks, parent information nights). 
Studies in which parents were 
“passively” involved (eg, received 
newsletters or text messages) 
were not eligible. For the purposes 
of this review, the definition of 
parents also included primary 
caregivers (eg, stepparents).
5. Children were not a specifically 
targeted group with special 
medical conditions other than 
overweight/obesity (eg, mental 
illness, malnourishment).
6. Study was published in a peer-
reviewed, English journal from 
January 2004 to January 2014.
Information Sources and Search
Studies were identified by searching 
the following 7 electronic databases 
with a standardized protocol: 
MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), 
SCOPUS, ERIC, and SPORTDiscus. 
Search terms were divided into 2 
groups: (1) “participants” (eg, child*, 
parent*, father*) and (2) “outcomes” 
(eg, obes*, diet). To maximize the 
sensitivity of the search, the Boolean 
phrase “AND” was used between 
groups, and the Boolean phrase 
“OR” was used within groups. Where 
possible, the following limits were 
applied: “English, 
” “human, 
” “RCT, 
” 
“peer reviewed.” For a summary of 
the search syntax, see Supplemental 
Table 3.
Study Selection
After duplicates were removed, 
2 authors screened all retrieved 
citations based on title and abstract 
in a standardized, nonblinded 
manner. Full text articles were 
retrieved for remaining records, 
including those in which the abstract 
did not contain conclusive eligibility 
information. After this, 2 authors 
independently screened each article 
by using an “include, 
” “exclude, 
” or 
“unsure” approach. Disagreements 
were resolved through discussion, 
and full consensus was achieved. 
To ensure each included study 
represented an independent RCT, 1 
author (M.D.Y.) reviewed all included 
studies for unique distinguishing 
characteristics (eg, number of 
children, number of parents, year 
conducted), particularly in relation to 
other studies conducted by the same 
investigator.
Development of Coding Criteria
The data extraction template was 
adapted from a manual used in a 
previous systematic review of male 
engagement in weight loss RCTs. 
42 
After adapting and developing items 
to suit the current review objectives, 
the template was pilot tested by the 
study authors with a random selection 
of eligible articles. The authors then 
met to clarify ambiguous items. This 
process was repeated several times 
to improve agreement before the 
final template was set.
Data Extraction
For each article, 2 of 6 authors 
independently extracted the required 
data (A.B.L., M.L.W., A.M., N.E., E.M.M., 
A.T.B.). Each possible combination 
of coders received an equal share of 
articles. An additional author (M.D.Y.) 
resolved discrepancies with reference 
to the instruction manual and original 
article. Krippendorff’s α (k-α) was 
calculated to indicate interrater 
agreement, which is recommended 
for studies using ≥3 coders. 
43
Total Number of Parents
Where the data were available, 
coders recorded the total number of 
parents who were randomized into 
the study (k-α = .79).
Father Involvement
Where reported, the representation 
of fathers as a proportion of the total 
number of parents was also recorded 
(k-α = .79).
Study Aim
Coders recorded whether the study 
tested interventions for obesity 
treatment or prevention. If a study 
recruited overweight and obese 
children only, it was deemed to be 
obesity treatment. Studies without 
this eligibility criterion were classed 
as obesity prevention (k-α = .86).
Child Age Group
Studies were grouped based on the 
reported age range of the children: 
newborn/infant (0–1 year), toddler 
(2–4 years), child (5–9 years), 
preadolescent (10–12 years), and 
adolescent (13–18 years). If the 
child age range spanned 2 adjacent 
categories, the mean age of the 
sample was used for categorization. If 
the age range spanned >2 groups, the 
study was not categorized (k-α = .97).
Targeted Behaviors
Studies were classified into 3 groups 
based on the targeted behavior/s: (1) 
physical activity (including sedentary 
behavior), (2) diet, or (3) both 
physical activity and diet (k-α = .83).
Intervention Format
The primary “setting” and “delivery 
mode” of the parental intervention 
components were recorded. The 
categories for intervention setting 
were (1) school/community, (2) 
university/clinic, and (3) home. The 
categories for intervention mode 
were (1) face-to-face; multiple 
families, (2) face-to-face; 1 family, 
(3) face-to-face; multiple + single 
(ie, a mix of individual and group 
based sessions) and (4) distance (eg, 
phone consultations, online). k-α 
was slightly lower for these variables 
(setting: .65, mode: .64) due to 
inconsistent reporting across studies. 
However, because all discrepancies 
were resolved with a consistent

MORGAN et al 
approach by a single reviewer, these 
variables were deemed acceptable 
for inclusion in the analysis.
Additional Comments on Father 
Involvement
Coders recorded any references 
to explicit strategies used by 
the researchers to increase the 
involvement of fathers in the 
intervention. The coders also noted 
if the authors reported that a lack 
of fathers was a study limitation. 
Interrater reliability was not 
calculated for these qualitative items.
Data Analysis
Analyses were conducted by using 
SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). 
Means for quantitative variables and 
percentages for categorical variables 
were calculated. Independent 
samples t tests and analyses of 
variance investigated whether any 
study factors were associated with 
father involvement. Because the RCT 
design precludes participants from 
choosing a particular intervention 
arm, studies that tested multiple 
interventions that differed on a 
particular characteristic (eg, physical 
activity versus diet) were removed 
from that particular analysis. Studies 
that explicitly excluded mothers or 
fathers from participation were not 
included.
RESULTS
The search provided a total of 18 583 
unique citations. After screening 
titles, 8765 abstracts were reviewed 
and the full texts of 803 articles were 
retrieved for further investigation 
( 
Fig 1). Initial interrater agreement 
for article inclusion was 83%, and 
discrepancies were discussed until 
consensus was reached. Overall, 
212 articles reporting the results of 
213 RCTs were deemed eligible for 
inclusion (see Supplemental Table 4 
for a complete list of included studies).
As seen in  
Table 1, most included 
studies were conducted in the United 
States (47%). A similar number 
of studies tested interventions 
aimed at obesity prevention 
(51%) and treatment (49%). The 
number of published RCTs steadily 
increased over time, from 15 
(7%) in 2004–2005 to 73 (34%) 
in 2012–2013. Nineteen studies 
explicitly recruited mothers only 
(9%), and 1 recruited fathers only 
(0.5%). The most commonly targeted 
age group was “child” (5–9 years; 
35%), and studies were more likely 
to target both physical activity and 
diet in combination (62%) rather 
than alone. The interactive parent 
components of the interventions 
were most often held in the school/
community setting (27%), and the 
most common mode of delivery 
was face-to-face (multiple families) 
(43%). Of the 56 582 children that 
participated in the studies, 46% were 
boys, and 50% were girls (4% not 
reported).
Research Question 1: What Is the 
Involvement of Fathers in Pediatric 
Obesity Treatment and Prevention 
Programs When Participation Is 
Limited to 1 Parent per Family?
Eighty RCTs tested interventions 
where participation was limited to 
1 parent per family (eg, parent-child 
dyad studies). As seen in  
Table 2, the 
breakdown of participating parents 
by sex was initially available for 83% 
of these RCTs (n = 66), although this 
increased to 89% (n = 71) after the 
corresponding authors of 5 RCTs 
provided additional data on request. 
Of the available data, mothers 
represented the nominated parent/
caregiver in 93% of families (n = 
12 604), fathers in 6% of families 
(n = 871), and another family member 
(eg, stepparent, grandparent) in 
1% of families (n = 84). The modal 
proportion of fathers per RCT was 0%.
Research Question 2: What Is the 
Involvement of Fathers When Both 
Parents Can Participate?
Overall, 133 RCTs tested 
interventions in which participation 
in the parental component was 
open to both parents (eg, family 
counseling, parent information 
night). These studies were much less 
likely to report father involvement; 
only 11 (8%) provided quantitative 
data. Where reported, fathers 
represented 32% of parents at 
baseline, although none of the 
studies indicated whether treatment 
attendance throughout the program 
varied by parent sex. Six additional 
studies (5%) explicitly stated 
that parent participation was 
predominantly limited to the mother 
but did not provide quantitative data.
Because the majority of these studies 
did not describe the nature of father 
involvement, the corresponding 
authors were also e-mailed for 
additional insights. If the authors had 
not collected any data on the issue, 
they were asked to estimate the 
proportion of participating fathers. Of 
the 122 authors e-mailed, 22 replied 
with estimates of father involvement 
ranging from 0% to 10% (n = 15), 
10% to 20% (n = 3), 20% to 30% 
(n = 2), and 40% to 50% (n = 2). For 
the purposes of this review, these 
estimates were not considered 
objective engagement data and are 
included to provide additional insight 
only.

Research Question 3: Are 
Fathers More or Less Likely to 
Participate in Studies With Certain 
Characteristics?
The moderator analyses 
investigated whether fathers were 
more or less likely to participate in 
trials with different characteristics. 
Although 82 RCTs reported the 
breakdown of parent participation 
by sex, studies were only included 
if they allowed participation from 
both mothers and/or fathers. 
As such, 20 studies that explicitly 
excluded fathers (n = 19) or mothers 
(n = 1) were not included in the 
analysis. Five studies that recruited 
mothers only but did not explicitly 
exclude fathers from enrolling 
were included. As summarized 
in the following sections, father 
involvement was not significantly 
associated with any of the examined 
characteristics.
Intervention Aim
The proportion of fathers 
did not vary between studies 
testing interventions designed 
for obesity treatment (17%) or 
obesity prevention (13%; 
t60 = −1.0, P = .31).
Year
Father involvement did not 
vary significantly over time 
(F2, 
59 = 0.9, P = .43). To account 
for the escalating publication 
rate, studies were analyzed in 
3 groups of approximately equal 
size. Fathers represented 19%, 14%, 
and 14% of participants in studies 
published from 2004 to 2008, 
2009 to 2011, and 2012 to 2013, 
respectively.
USA Versus International
No association was detected 
between father participation in 
studies conducted in or outside the 
United States. US trials had a smaller 
mean proportion of fathers than 
international trials (13% vs 20%), 
but the difference was not significant 
(t24 = –1.5, P = .13).
Child Age Group
Child age did not have a significant 
influence on father involvement 
(F2, 
52 = 1.7, P = .20). However, 
all newborn/infant studies explicitly 
recruited mothers only so could 
not be included. Overall, toddler 
studies had the lowest proportion 
of fathers (10%), followed by 
preadolescent/adolescent studies 
(15%) and child studies (18%). 
The preadolescent and adolescent 
categories were merged as only 4 
adolescent studies were eligible for 
the analysis.
Targeted Behavior(s)
Diet only studies had the 
lowest representation of fathers 
(9%), compared with those

targeting physical activity only 
(17%) or physical activity plus 
diet (17%), although this difference 
was not significant (F3, 
58 = 1.8, 
P = .15).
Setting
Father participation did not vary by 
setting. The greatest participation 
of fathers (17%) was observed 
when the primary setting of the 
parental intervention component 
was in the school or community, 
compared with 12% in universities/
clinics and 12% at home. 
However, the difference between 
settings was not significant 
(F2, 
43 = 0.9, P = .42).
Delivery Mode
No association was detected 
between father participation 
across the different delivery 
modes (F3, 
47 = 0.4, P = .74). Father 
participation was greatest when the 
parental intervention components 
were delivered in a group setting 
with other families (17%) or in a 
mix of group and individual family 
sessions (18%), compared with 
individual family sessions (12%) or 
distance-based delivery (eg, online; 
15%).
Research Question 4: How Many 
Studies Explicitly Attempted to 
Increase the Recruitment of Fathers 
or Identifi
 ed a Lack of Fathers as a 
Possible Study Limitation?
Across the 213 RCTs, 2 studies (1%) 
explicitly reported using strategies to 
specifically recruit or engage fathers. 
One of these was the only published 
RCT to target fathers and children 
exclusively. 
44 The second was a 
preschool nutrition intervention that 
included 1 module in which fathers 
cooked with their children. 
45 Only 4 
studies (2%) suggested that a lack 
of father involvement was a possible 
study limitation or important area to 
address in future research.
DISCUSSION
This was the first systematic review 
to quantify the involvement of 
fathers in pediatric obesity treatment 
and prevention programs with 
parental involvement. In studies that 
recruited only 1 parent per family, 
participation could be verified for 
only 871 fathers (6%), compared 
with 12 604 mothers (93%). In 
studies in which both parents 
could participate, 92% did not 
provide objective data on fathers, 
with most studies reporting only 
general “parent” involvement. No 
characteristics moderated the level 
of father involvement, with fathers 
underrepresented across all study 
types. Despite this, only 2% of studies 
suggested that a lack of fathers 
was a possible study limitation, 
and only 1% reported the use of 
explicit strategies to increase father 
involvement.
This review has confirmed that most 
obesity treatment or prevention 
programs for children have not 
engaged fathers. Because of the 
relative scarcity of father-focused 
studies in obesity-related literature, 
the reasons for this lack of father 
involvement are not well understood. 
In a review that considered published 
evidence, practitioner insights, 
and father focus groups, Bayley 
and colleagues suggested that key 
barriers to participation in general 
parenting programs included 
competing work commitments, 
reduced awareness of programs, and 
a general discomfort participating 
in mother-dominated groups. 
27 
In general, fathers have also been 
reported to take a passive role in the

to perceive their child’s weight as a 
problem. 
46
To the extent that fathers may not 
be as concerned about their child’s 
weight, researchers may need to 
make concerted efforts to recruit 
them in future studies. Despite the 
important role of socioculturally 
targeted recruitment, 
 
47 existing 
programs may not have appealed 
directly to fathers. Indeed, only 1% 
of studies in this review reported 
the use of specific strategies to 
increase father involvement. 
This is particularly important 
because fathers often assume the 
term “parent” is interchangeable 
with “mother” when viewing 
advertising material for parenting 
programs. 
27 Notably, explicitly 
targeting men has shown promise 
as a recruitment strategy in the 
adult obesity literature, 
 
48 where 
men also represent a minority of 
participants. 
42
The lack of fathers in pediatric 
obesity prevention and treatment 
programs creates a number of 
conceptual and practical limitations 
for the field. Although it is plausible 
that mother-focused interventions 
could indirectly affect fathers’ 
behavior, a recent obesity prevention 
intervention identified that targeting 
mothers exclusively did not generate 
any flow-on benefits for father 
obesity risk behaviors, suggesting 
more direct targeting is required. 
49 
This is particularly important 
given that parenting practices 
from mothers and fathers may 
differentially affect child behavior. 
22, 
 
50 
Reduced father participation also 
affects data collection and study 
evaluation. Research shows that 2 
parents from the same household can 
provide different accounts of child 
behavior, 
 
50 with fathers providing 
more accurate estimates in some 
instances.51
Perhaps most important, evidence 
has highlighted the critical and 
independent role of fathers on their 
children’s physical activity and 
dietary behaviors. Compared with 
mothers, fathers are more likely to 
initiate and facilitate co–physical 
activity at home, 
 
33 spend a greater 
proportion of their time playing 
with their children, 
 
52 and engage in 
a type of play that is more physical, 
stimulating, and unpredictable. 
53 
Indeed, the emotional bond between 
fathers and their children has 
been referred to as an “activation 
relationship” that develops primarily 
through physical play. 
54 Although not 
statistically significant, it is notable 
that studies targeting physical 
activity included almost twice the 
representation of fathers (17%) in 
this review, compared with those 
targeting diet only (9%). However, 
preliminary evidence suggests that 
fathers also play a key role in shaping 
their children’s dietary behavior. 
For example, strong associations 
have been observed between fathers 
and child intake of fruit and energy-
dense, nutrient-poor foods, 
35, 
 
36 even 
after controlling for maternal diet. 
35 
Furthermore, fathers’ use of fast-
food restaurants and perceptions of 
dinner as an important family ritual 
have been linked to child fast-food 
consumption. 
34
This review did not identify any 
factors that were associated with 
greater participation of fathers. 
However, it should be noted that 
the moderator analysis may have 
been affected by the insufficient 
variation between studies, with 
fathers greatly underrepresented 
in almost all studies with reported 
data. Although the proportion of 
participating fathers appeared larger 
in studies when both parents could 
participate (32%), this estimate may 
have been inflated because only 8% 
of these studies provided data and 
none described whether session 
attendance varied between mothers 
and fathers during the intervention.
Of note, the rate of father 
participation in the research studies 
did not appear to markedly improve 
over time. This was an interesting 
finding given fathers are now more 
engaged with their children than ever 
before. 
39 Indeed, the average number 
of hours per week fathers spend on 
child care has tripled in the past 50 
years. 
38 There was also a paucity of 
fathers in obesity prevention studies 
targeting newborns, infants, and 
toddlers. Indeed, of the 19 studies 
that explicitly excluded fathers, 15 
targeted children from these age 
groups (79%). Given that physical 
activity and dietary behaviors can 
be established at a very young 
age 
55 and that fathers are critical 
for encouraging breastfeeding 
initiation and duration, 
 
56– 
58 early-life 
interventions would likely benefit 
from a more meaningful engagement 
of fathers.
Of concern, little evidence exists to 
suggest that the underrepresentation 
of fathers is considered an important 
evidence-gap or research priority 
within the field. Of the 213 RCTs in 
this review, only 4 (2%) explicitly 
reported that a lack of fathers was a 
limitation of the study. The silence 
on this issue is also evident in 
many recent reviews of family- and 
parent-based interventions targeting 
pediatric obesity prevention 
59 
 
– 
62 and 
treatment, 
63 
– 
65 which have failed 
to highlight the absence of fathers 
as an important area to address in 
future research. Notably, in a recent 
scientific summary of important 
research gaps relating to specifically 
parent-based interventions for 
childhood obesity treatment, 
the American Heart Association 
identified the need to increase 
the involvement of grandparents, 
siblings, and cousins in future efforts, 
but the issue of father involvement 
was not addressed. 
66 To meaningfully 
improve the involvement of fathers in 
future interventions, the issue must 
become a much more prominent 
consideration on the scientific agenda 
through explicit acknowledgment 
as well as intervention design 
considerations.

Currently, little research exists to 
illuminate which strategies are most 
important for recruiting fathers into 
behavioral pediatric interventions. 
Best practice insights from the 
broader literature on parenting 
interventions include using targeted 
advertising appealing to “fathers” 
rather than “parents” 
67 and providing 
flexibility in the location and timing 
of the program (eg, afternoon/
evening rather than work hours). 
68 
Importantly, programs should also 
be socioculturally relevant, targeting 
core values and preferences of 
fathers. 
47 Fathers report appreciating 
programs that allow them to spend 
quality time with their children, 
provide practical parenting tips, 
include opportunities for interaction 
with other fathers, recognize the 
unique contributions of fathers, 
provide opportunities for co–physical 
activity, and are delivered by credible 
facilitators. 
47, 
69
The search retrieved only 1 study 
that specifically targeted fathers. 
The Healthy Dads, Healthy Kids RCT 
from Australia was designed to treat 
overweight and obesity in fathers and 
prevent obesity in their children. 
44 
Compared with a control group, 
the program significantly improved 
weight status, physical activity, and 
diet for both fathers and children, 
 
44, 
 
70 
providing strong evidence for the 
utility of socioculturally relevant 
programs for fathers.
This review applied a comprehensive 
search strategy to 7 databases by 
using search term combinations 
that maximized sensitivity. For the 
213 included RCTs, all data were 
extracted by at least 2 independent 
reviewers, and the conduct and 
reporting of the review adhered to 
the PRISMA guidelines. This review 
also had some limitations. Given 
the immense number of published 
studies, the review was limited to 
English-language RCTs published 
in peer-reviewed journals over a 
10-year period. Consequently, the 
findings of this review may not 
be generalizable to non-English-
speaking cultures. In addition, the 
review was unable to examine the 
moderating influence of family 
ethnicity on father involvement 
because of the insufficient reporting 
of this variable.
CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review 
highlighted several conceptual and 
methodological gaps in the literature 
stemming from the relative absence 
of fathers in pediatric obesity 
treatment and prevention studies 
that included parent involvement. 
Targeted recruitment strategies are 
required to increase the participation 
and engagement of fathers in future 
research. Studies that examine the 
differential impact of including 
fathers and mothers together, fathers 
only, and mothers only will also 
provide valuable insights into factors 
that may influence intervention 
efficacy. To advance the field, a much 
greater understanding of the role 
and presence of fathers in obesity 
treatment and prevention trials is 
required. To achieve this, researchers 
should strive to report more 
comprehensive data to highlight 
the involvement and engagement of 
fathers in their studies.
