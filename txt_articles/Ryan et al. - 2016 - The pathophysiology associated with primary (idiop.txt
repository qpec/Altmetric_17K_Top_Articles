Abstract
Background: Frozen shoulder is a common yet poorly understood musculoskeletal condition, which for many, is
associated with substantial and protracted morbidity. Understanding the pathology associated with this condition
may help to improve management. To date this has not been presented in a systematic fashion. As such, the aim
of this review was to summarise the pathological changes associated with this primary frozen shoulder.
Methods: Databases: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, BNI and the Cochrane Library, were searched from
inception to 2nd May, 2014. To be included participants must not have undergone any prior intervention. Two
reviewers independently conducted the; searches, screening, data extraction and assessment of Risk of Bias using
the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI). Only
English language publications reporting findings in humans were included. The findings were summarised in
narrative format.
Results: Thirteen observational studies (involving 417 shoulders) were included in the review. Eight studies
reported magnetic resonance imaging or arthrography findings and 5 recorded histological findings. When
reported mean ages of the participants ranged from 40.0 to 59.8 years. Duration of symptoms ranged from 0 to
30 months. The majority of studies (n = 7) were assessed to be of moderate risk of bias, two studies at high risk and
the remaining four were rated as low risk of bias. Study characteristics were poorly reported and there was
widespread variety observed between studies in respect of data collection methods and inclusion criteria
employed. Pathological changes in the anterior shoulder joint capsule and related structures were commonly
reported. Imaging identified pathological changes occurring in the coracohumeral ligament, axillary fold and rotator
interval. Obliteration of the subcoracoid fat triangle also appeared to be pathognomonic. Histological studies were
inconclusive but suggested that immune, inflammatory and fibrotic changes where associated with primary frozen
shoulder.
Conclusions: This systematic review presents a summary of what is currently known about the tissue
pathophysiology of primary frozen shoulder. Further studies that use standardised inclusion and exclusion criteria
and investigate changes in naïve tissue at different stages of the condition are required.

 Background
Although frozen shoulder is considered to be a common
musculoskeletal condition, with reviews reporting up to
5.3 % of the population being affected [1], definitive
prevalence and incidence rates remain unknown [2].
The condition is associated with; (often severe) pain,
sleep deprivation, anxiety, and disability that may be
hugely disruptive and impacts on nearly every aspect of
daily living [3]. The average duration of the condition is
30.1 months (range 1 to 3.5 years) [4] but it may be sub-
stantially longer [5, 6], and the burden placed upon indi-
viduals and health care services may therefore be
considered substantial [7].
The term “frozen shoulder” was introduced in 1934 by
Codman who described the disorder as “difficult to de-
fine, difficult to treat and difficult to explain” [8]; and in
many respects this remains true today. Frozen Shoulder
(FS) has been classified into primary and secondary con-
ditions [9]. Primary FS (PFS) is characterised by an in-
sidious onset of idiopathic origin whereas secondary FS
is associated with a defined event, such as a known in-
trinsic (such as rotator cuff disease) or extrinsic (such as
trauma) cause [10]. FS associated with medical condi-
tions such as diabetes and thyroid disorders are subcate-
gorised as secondary systemic frozen shoulder [11].
Symptoms associated with frozen shoulder include:
localised pain, pain with movement, night pain (render-
ing the patient unable to sleep on the affected side),
marked limitation of active and passive range of move-
ment (particularly external rotation) and normal shoul-
der radiograph findings [8]. However, the absence of
definitive diagnostic criteria imposes challenges for clin-
ical diagnosis and management and research [12]. This
diagnostic challenge is further complicated by the clin-
ical overlap in signs and symptoms between frozen
shoulder and other conditions, such as; rotator cuff ten-
dinopathy, calcific tendonitis or early glenohumeral ar-
throsis [13, 14]. A recent narrative review suggested
thickening of the coracohumeral ligament (CHL), joint
capsule and synovium to be diagnostic features for fro-
zen shoulder [15]. However no systematic review has yet
collated the data from imaging studies to specify the
intra and peri-articular changes that are associated with
the condition.
Historically, the pathology of FS has been attributed to
structures such as the subacromial bursa and joint cap-
sule [16, 17]. As arthroscopic and microbiological tech-
niques
have
advanced
other
structures
have
been
associated
with
the
pathogenesis
of
the
condition:
namely, the rotator interval (RI), long head of biceps
(LHB) and the CHL [18]. Contemporary histological
analyses have identified the presence of inflammatory
markers within the asscoiated tissue [19]. Cytokines,
such as Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) α, Interleukin
(IL) 1 α and β and IL-6 have also been identified [20]. In
addition, studies have reported high numbers of fibro-
blasts and myofibroblasts, suggestive of a fibrotic process
[21, 22]. An immunological component has also been
linked with frozen shoulder; such as the presence of B-
lymphocytes, mast cells and macrophages [23]. Such
studies have led to the suggestion that FS may begin as
an immunological response which escalates to an in-
flammatory synovitis, eventually leading to fibrosis of
the capsule and that future research should focus on
disease [15].
The purpose of this systematic review was to identify
and synthesise the available evidence regarding the intra
and peri-articular pathophysiology of primary frozen
shoulder. A secondary aim was to identify deficits in our
knowledge that may inform future research. The review
was designed to include studies that had investigated the
pathology, physiology, physiopathology, neurophysiology,
histology, histocytochemistry, microbiology, immuno-
chemistry or immunohistochemistry of the glenohum-
eral joint and its related structures in adults diagnosed
with primary frozen shoulder.
Methods
This review is reported in accordance with the PRISMA
statement for reporting systematic reviews [24].
Searches
Databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, BNI and
the Cochrane Library) were searched from inception
until 2nd May, 2014. Searches were performed inde-
pendently by two researchers (HB and VR). The search
strategy was developed using the Population and Inter-
vention component of the PICO formula (Population,
Intervention, Comparator and Outcome) [25]. Search
terms related to patho-anatomical and pathophysio-
logical changes associated with primary idiopathic frozen
shoulder (Table 1). No language restrictions were ap-
plied and searches were limited to human studies. In
addition to the formal data base searches a reference list
search of included publications was also conducted.
Eligibility criteria
Studies were included if the participants were diagnosed
as having PFS and had undergone combinations of im-
aging, histological or biochemical analysis of the gleno-
humeral joint. Studies were excluded if participants were
diagnosed with any form of secondary frozen shoulder,
such as diabetes, rotator cuff disease or trauma [12]. To
reduce confounding the findings, studies were also ex-
cluded if participants had undergone previous interven-
tions directly to the shoulder joint (and were termed
non-naïve studies). This was because steroid injections
may impact on the structure and biochemistry of the

 tissue [15, 26]. Furthermore, arthrographic distension
and capsular release are designed to disrupt the capsule
[27] and manipulation under anaesthetic (MUA) may
cause intra-articular damage to multiple structures [28].
Translation services were not available thus non English
language studies, identified through the search, were
subsequently excluded.
Selection of studies
Two reviewers (HB and VR) reviewed the articles for eli-
gibility and inclusion with a third reviewer (JL) available
in the event of consensus not being achieved. Article ti-
tles were used to identify relevant studies. Following this,
eligibility was checked and recorded on a checklist de-
signed for the review that incorporated PICO criteria. A
data extraction form was developed for the review based
upon the University of York, Centre for Reviews and
Dissemination (2009) guidance [29].
Data analyses
Following data extraction, the study characteristics were
tabulated and the studies synthesized. The variables syn-
thesized in this review were reported findings from im-
aging studies of the shoulder joint and its related
structures, as well as histological, neural and vascular
findings. In addition, studies were assessed and their risk
of bias appraised. Whether meta-analyses would be pos-
sible or appropriate was considered at this point.
Risk of bias
Although not always included in systematic reviews in-
vestigating pathophysiological mechanisms it was de-
cided a priori to include an assessment of the risk of
bias of the studies included in the current systematic re-
view to enhance the validity of conclusion reached. The
choice of a risk of bias tool for the review proved diffi-
cult as no one tool was perfectly compatible with this
type of review. As the review question did not explore
diagnostic accuracy the QUADAS-2 tool to evaluate the
risk of bias and applicability of primary diagnostic accur-
acy
studies
was
not
considered
appropriate.
The
ACROBAT-NRSI (A Cochrane Risk Of Bias Assessment
Tool for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions) is
used
when
appraising
the
risk
of
bias
in
non-
randomized studies that compares the health effects of
at least two interventions. Although the current review
explored mechanisms rather than interventions, its do-
mains appeared relevant and appropriate to the review
and was chosen for use in the current review [30]. Stud-
ies were appraised to be at high, moderate or low risk of
bias independently by two reviewers (HB and VR) with a
third reviewer available in the event of any non-
agreement (JL).

 Results
Three thousand five hundred fifty-one potentially rele-
vant studies were identified in searches. Title, abstract
and reference list screening identified 58 articles meeting
the review criteria. Duplicates (n = 16) were removed
and the full text of articles read. Thirteen studies met
the inclusion criteria for the review and 29 studies were
excluded (Table 2). A summary is provided in the
PRISMA flow diagram (Fig. 1). The study characteristics
are presented in Table 3.
All 13 included studies were observational in design.
Nine studies included a control group [19, 31–38], four
did not [14, 39–41]. Of those using a control group, four
included patients with rotator cuff pathology [31, 32, 35,
37], three used asymptomatic controls [34, 36, 38] and
two studies included patients with shoulder instability
[19, 33]. One study included two control groups [31],
one with rotator cuff pathology and the other included
people without symptoms. Study characteristics were
generally poorly reported and there was widespread vari-
ation in diagnosis, methods of sample selection, timing
of sample selection and presence of confounding vari-
ables such as use of oral medications. Eight out of 13
studies (62 %) based their inclusion criteria on the
Codman classification [14, 31, 32, 34, 36, 38, 39, 42]. How-
ever, it was evident that there were substantial variations
in the interpretation of this classification (Table 3).
The risk of bias data is presented in Table 4. The ma-
jority of studies (n = 7) were identified as having a mod-
erate risk of bias, with two studies assessed of being at
high risk of bias and the remaining four rated as low risk
of bias. In general, sample sizes were small, ranging from
one to seventy two (average = 28) participants. All stud-
ies used convenience sampling. Despite eleven studies
identifying potential confounding factors, only six [14,
31, 33–35, 38] reported how they had taken account of
them in their study design and/or in their analysis. The
risk of bias data and widespread variation between stud-
ies did not permit meta-analyses.
Imaging findings
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were re-
ported in five studies [14, 31, 32, 34, 38], with one study
using Gadolinium enhancement [32] (Table 3). In
descending order of frequency, findings included: a
substantially thickened CHL [31, 34, 38]; thickening of
the joint capsule in the RI [32, 38] and axillary recess
[14, 32]; thickening of the synovial membrane in the RI
[32] and axillary recess [14, 32]; partial or complete
obliteration of the subcoracoid fat triangle [34, 38];
scarring and or thickening of the RI [14, 38]; fluid dis-
tension of the bursa within the superior subscapularis
recess [31] and synovitis abnormalities around the LHB
tendon [38].
Three studies used contrast enhancement arthrogra-
phy, with two utilising magnetic resonance angiogram
(MRA) [35, 36], and the third, radiology [40]. Arthrogra-
phy findings were contradictory (Table 3). Song et al.
[36] reported substantial thickening of the joint capsule
in the axillary recess and the RI. Neviaser [40] reported
reduced joint capacity secondary to thickening and con-
tracture of the capsule (region unspecified), obliteration
of the axillary fold and often complete or near complete
abolition of the subscapularis bursa. In contrast, Manton
et al. [35] reported a trend for greater capsular thickness
in the axillary recess and at the humeral head and in-
creased synovial thickness in the axillary recess in con-
trols, when compared to patients with FS. They also
reported that RI abnormalities were more common in
control participants, concluding that there are no useful
MRA signs of FS.
Histology findings
Extensive histological findings were reported (Table 3).
Tissue samples demonstrated the following: a dense col-
lagen matrix and high population of fibroblasts and con-
tractile myofibroblasts [19, 21, 33, 41]; a fibrotic process
limited to the anterior part of the capsule [41]; elevated
levels of inflammatory cytokines in the SAB and anterior
capsule [19] and the presence of mature and regenerat-
ing nerve fibres in the anterior capsule [37].
Five studies explored the histological and molecular
changes associated with idiopathic FS (Table 5). When
the study characteristics were reviewed limitations were
evident. As previously identified, symptomology, demo-
graphics and the stage of the condition were poorly re-
corded. Secondly, there was substantial diversity between
studies with regards to what was being measured. Further-
more, the techniques used to obtain the data also varied
(Table 3).
Neuronal and vascular findings
Xu et al. [37] investigated neuronal changes within the
condition. They reported elevated levels of several im-
munoreactive neuronal proteins (GAP43, PGP9.5 and
P75) in the anterosuperior joint capsule. The distribu-
tion of these proteins was either close to small blood
vessels or within fibroblastic tissue. Increased vascularity
was a common feature identified in the histology studies;
particularly located in the anterosuperior structures but
absent in the inferior structures (with the exception of
the AF).
Discussion

tures in primary frozen shoulder were the location of
greatest pathological change and in the subsequent

 clinical features of the disease, namely a loss of external
rotation of the shoulder. The limited number of studies
conducting histological analyses did not permit definitive
conclusions pertaining to histological changes associated
with PFS, however, and in line with previously published
research, immune, inflammatory and fibrosis appear to
play a role in the pathological process. The extent to
which each component contributes and the variance as-
sociated with this cannot as yet be determined.
Clinical inclusion criteria
The review identified substantial variations in interpret-
ation of the Codman classification. Future research must
clearly detail defined and standardised diagnostic guide-
lines, to allow for more accurate and definitive compari-
sons between findings in studies.
Imaging
Imaging investigations varied substantially across the in-
cluded trials and are a potential reason for the variations
in findings. Three studies used arthrography, with two
using direct arthrography, where contrast material was
injected directly into the joint [35, 40]. The basis for this
is to permit a more precise visualisation of the intra-
articular structures [43]. The contrast material was
injected until the capsule distended which occurred at
approximately 12–14 ml of fluid [44]. Neviaser [17] re-
ported that normal shoulder joint capacity is between
28–35 ml, often reducing to 5–10 ml in cases of FS.
Manton et al. [35] reported a tolerance of less than
10 ml in all nine people with FS. Although the signifi-
cance of reduced joint capacity in the diagnosis of FS re-
mains uncertain [18, 45–47], the effect of capsular
distension when introducing the contrast material may
have confounded the published findings relating to the
capsule and synovium [35, 47]. Song et al. [36] utilised
indirect MRA, where contrast was injected intravenously
into an antecubital vein. Indirect MRA requires exercis-
ing the joint for 10 to 15 min pre-imaging to increase
vascular perfusion to improve flow into the joint [48],
and again the influence of this activity on the reported
findings is unknown.

 There is no definitive guidance as to which imaging
modality demonstrates greater diagnostic value in FS,
and the heterogeneity of techniques used, and their associ-
ated potential confounding factors, limits deriving defini-
tive conclusions relating to the articular and peri-articular
changes associated with FS.
Histology
Symptomology, demographics and disease stage were
poorly reported in the studies included in this review.
The widespread diversity between studies with regards
to what was being measured and how data was collected
made comparison and synthesis of findings difficult. The
main findings with respect to pathology identified in this
review are presented in Tables 5 and 6 and are sum-
marised below.
Fibrosis and contracture
Bunker [39] and Uhthoff and Boileau [41] used immuno-
cytochemistry (ICC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
to review matrix components. Both reported fibroblastic
proliferation in the superior capsule and the RI. This is
consistent with the imaging findings and with previous
histological studies [49, 50]. Vimentin is a cytocontrac-
tile protein and its presence may be assessed during
ICC. Bunker [39] reported that vimentin was strongly
expressed and confirmed that the cells were fibroblasts.
In addition, when exposed to a smooth-muscle actin,
many of the fibroblasts displayed a differentiation into a
myofibroblastic phenotype. The myofibroblast, or con-
tractile fibroblast, is the pathognomonic cell of contract-
ile scar tissue and is found in Dupuytren’s and the other
fibromatoses [51]. Kilian et al. [33] used reverse tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) to study
the mRNA (messenger RNA) transcription rates in the
fibrosing stage of FS. They reported decreased levels of
fibroblast like cells and α1 (III) chains which was indica-
tive of a low number of myofibroblasts. The differing re-
sults may be due to samples being acquired at different
stages of disease process; Bunker [39] did not supply in-
formation regarding stage of the condition or duration
of symptoms since onset so comparison of results is
challenging. Discrepancies in data may also relate to the
way in which the tissue samples were managed. RTPCR

in the subsynovial tissue adjacent
to blood vessels. In the FS tissue,
PGP9.5 nerve fibres were often
observed close to small blood
vessels and within the fibroblastic

 evaluates gene expression through the presence of indi-
vidual cells types, whereas, ICC indicates which proteins
those cells are producing [52]. Although they had a rela-
tively small number of participants (N = 4) Uhthoff and
Boileau [41] conducted a comprehensive study to deter-
mine if fibroplasia affects all structures equally. Samples
were taken anteriorly, posteriorly, superiorly and infer-
iorly around the shoulder joint. All structures demon-
strated
fibroplasia,
however,
vimentin
was
strongly
expressed anteriorly but was absent in the posterior cap-
sule, leading the authors to suggest that fibroplasia and
contracture may be different processes. Their cohort
consisted of 4 female subjects with no information per-
taining to stage of the condition.
To reduce confounding variables the direct local intro-
duction of medication into the joint was an exclusion
criteria for the current review. All patients had failed
conservative management; but no studies specified what
this included. Common conservative management strat-
egies for FS include oral analgesics and NSAIDs [53].
Therefore, the systemic effects of oral medications
should be considered. Evidence in both bone and tendon
literature
suggests
that
ibuprofen
reduces
tensile
strength, collagen fibre organisation and fibroblastic
proliferation [54]. Almekinders et al. [55] conducted an
in-vitro study of the effects of indomethacin on injured
human tendon tissue. They reported diminished levels
of fibroblast DNA synthesis in the groups treated with

 indomethacin compared to control. It is important to ac-
knowledge that levels of reported fibroplasia may have
been influenced by pharmaceutical preparations poten-
tially prescribed to treat the symptoms.
Inflammation and immune modulation
Cyclooxygenases play an important role in inflammation
and the collagen catabolic process within peripheral tis-
sues [53]. Lho et al. [19] used RTPCR and IHC and re-
ported increased expression of COX1 in the endothelial
cells and stroma of the joint capsule and increased ex-
pression of COX2 in the capsule and subacromial bursa
of the FS group. Furthermore, levels of IL-1α, IL-β, IL6
and TNF-α also differed between the capsule, bursa and
joint fluid. Interleukin and TNF-α are pro-inflammatory
cytokines; released from immune cells such as macro-
phages [54]. This may imply that high numbers of these
cells may be present in the joint [56]. Bunker [39] re-
ported low numbers of macrophages and leukocytes in
the RI. This variation may be reflective of differing
pathological processes between structures and/or that
the biopsies were taken from different stages of disease,
and possibly different diagnostic criteria. Neither Bunker
[39] nor Lho et al. [19] provided sufficient background
data regarding their participants to explore this. Further-
more, no comparable studies were included in this SR
which again reveals a gap in the evidence base that is
worthy of exploration.
Neuronal and vascular factors
Pain is associated with FS [3]. Hand et al. [6] conducted
a longitudinal study of 223 patients with frozen shoulder
with a mean follow up time of 4.4 years (range 2 to
20 years), with 41 % of the patient’s reporting mild to
moderate pain and 6 % reported severe pain. To date,
few studies have investigated the causes of pain experi-
enced by patients with FS [57]. In this review, Xu et al.
[37] investigated neuronal components associated with
PFS, reporting elevated levels of several immunoreactive
neuronal proteins (GAP43, PGP9.5 and P75) in the ante-
rosuperior joint capsule, close to small blood vessels or
within fibroblastic tissue. These findings confirm the
presence of mature and regenerating nerve fibres in the
anterosuperior capsule and may explain the severe pain
experienced by sufferers of the condition in the early
stages (less than six months). Increased vascularity was a
common feature identified in the histology studies; par-
ticularly located in the anterosuperior structures but ab-
sent in the inferior structures (with the exception of the
axillary fold (AF)). This is consistent with the literature
where hypervascularity and angiogenesis have been re-
ported

 association with neovessels [58, 59]. Xu et al. [37] re-
ported stronger expression of CD34 (a haematopoietic
cell marker) in the superior joint capsule of the FS group
compared RC tears, as a control population. Limited
conclusions may be drawn from this study because of
the small sample size (n = 8). Ryu et al. [58] investigated
FS in a diabetic cohort and reported CD34 to be strongly
expressed. However, caution must be taken when ex-
trapolating these results as the patient’s had received
corticosteroid injections. A recent study by Okuno et al.
[59] reported that arterial embolization of neovessels in
the RI provided rapid relief of pain in their FS group.
Limited knowledge exists regarding the pain mecha-
nisms involved with FS [60]. This SR has provided some
insight into possible causes. This knowledge has great
significance for clinicians as pain is often the dominant
complaint in patients with FS. The literature has sug-
gested that the condition may manifest differently be-
tween
individuals.
A
greater
understanding
would
greatly assist clinicians to effectively manage this symp-
tom in their patients. It is clear further research is
required.
Limitations
It is acknowledged that this systematic review has a
number of limitations. These are reviewed in the follow-
ing section.
Searches
Only English language publications were included in this
review so the introduction of language bias cannot be
ruled out. Studies where an English translation could
not be sourced were identified during abstract analysis.
One reviewer (VR) identified eighteen studies where the
full text English article could not be sourced. The sec-
ond reviewer (HB) identified six of those eighteen. All
eighteen studies were excluded. The evidence surround-
ing language bias is conflicting [30], and it is not known
how these non-English publications may have influenced
the findings of the current review.
No date restriction was applied to the studies so that
all available studies could be identified and included in
this systematic review, believed to be the first of this
type, in this condition. MRI was first introduced into
healthcare in the 1980’s, and over time image quality has
advanced substantially [61]. The implication of this is
that the reported imaging findings from the earlier stud-
ies [32, 35] may lack the sensitivity of those in later stud-
ies [31]. This also may have influenced the findings and
contributed to reported discrepancies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The aim of the review was to investigate the intra and
peri-articular pathophysiology of the glenohumeral joint
in people diagnosed with primary idiopathic frozen
shoulder. Only studies specifying primary frozen shoul-
der were included as it was not possible to separate the
findings from investigations that included both primary
and secondary frozen shoulders. This meant that pri-
mary frozen shoulder findings may have been missed by
excluding studies that incorporated both. The decision
to only include samples from people diagnosed with pri-
mary FS hopefully generated more homogenised data.
Direct injection of medication into the joint was an ex-
clusion criteria in this review to reduce the potential
confounding influencing this may have had on the find-
ings. However, there may be other sources of confound-
ing which might have affected the findings of this
review. All patients included in the review had had failed
conservative management but none of the studies speci-
fied what this included. Common conservative manage-
ment strategies for frozen shoulder include oral analgesics
and NSAIDs [62] and potentially, the systemic effects of
such oral medications may have also influenced findings.
Widespread variation
The main limitation of this review relates to the in-
cluded studies. Variations in diagnosis, methods of sam-
ple selection, timing of sampling, and confounding
variables such as use of oral medications, all may have
influenced the reported findings and the conclusions of
this review. Meta-analysis was not considered due to the
considerable and widespread variance within the in-
cluded studies [30].
Risk of bias
The majority of studies (n = 7) were identified as having
a moderate risk of bias, with two studies assessed of be-
ing at high risk of bias and the remaining four rated as
low risk of bias. Study characteristics were poorly re-
ported. There are three possible concerns for this review.
The first is, as previously mentioned, a risk of bias tool
specifically for use in pathophysiology reviews was not
found, meaning there may be specific domains relevant
for this type of review which have not been appraised or
discussed. The second is that, with only a minority of
studies being assessed as low risk of bias, the findings of
this review may contain systematic bias [30]. Meta-
analyses were not included in this review: it is accepted
that meta-analyses of studies that are at risk of bias may
be seriously misleading since meta-analysis may simply
compound the errors, thus producing an erroneous re-
sults which may be interpreted as having more credibil-
ity [30]. The third concern is that the ACROBAT-NRSI
tool, as a recent development to meet the need for a tool
to assess risk of bias in non-randomised studies, has yet
to be widely used or evaluated. Further research on the
performance of the tool in the future may influence the

 findings of this review or enable the findings to be
placed more appropriately in context.
Conclusions
This systematic review is the first review to synthesise
imaging and histological studies to examine the patho-
physiology associated with primary frozen shoulder. The
review highlights the role of the anterior shoulder struc-
tures in primary frozen shoulder, but there is a lack of
available evidence considered at low risk of bias to in-
form understanding of the pathophysiology of the pri-
mary frozen shoulder condition. Consensus regarding
inclusion criteria (and the interpretation of the Codman
classification criteria) is first required for future research
to promote studies providing comparable findings. Fol-
lowing this, further studies that identify findings at
clearly defined stages of the condition are required to
improve the understanding of the disease continuum.
Improved understanding may then inform management
specific to each stage of this painful, disabling common
condition so that it is no longer difficult to define, treat
or explain.
