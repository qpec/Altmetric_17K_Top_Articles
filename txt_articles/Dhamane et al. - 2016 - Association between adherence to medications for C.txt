Background: Patients with COPD often have multiple comorbidities requiring use of multiple 
medications, and adherence rates for maintenance COPD (mCOPD) medications are already 
known to be suboptimal. Presence of comorbidities in COPD patients, and use of medications 
used to treat those comorbidities (non-COPD medications), may have an adverse impact on 
adherence to mCOPD medications.
Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between non-adherence 
to mCOPD medications and non-COPD medications in COPD patients.
Methods: COPD patients were identified using a large administrative claims database. Selected 
patients were 40–89 years old and continuously enrolled for 12 months prior to and 24 months 
after the first identified COPD diagnosis (index date) during January 1, 2009 to December 31, 
2010. Patients were required to have $1 prescription for a mCOPD medication within 365 days of 
the index date and $1 prescription for one of 12 non-COPD medication classes within ±30 days 
of the first COPD prescription. Adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC]) was measured 
during 365 days following the first COPD prescription. The association between non-adherence 
(PDC ,0.8) to mCOPD and non-adherence to non-COPD medications was determined using 
logistic regression, controlling for baseline patient characteristics.
Results: A total of 14,117 patients, with a mean age of 69.9 years, met study criteria. Of these, 
40.9% were males and 79.2% were non-adherent to mCOPD medications with a mean PDC of 
0.47. Non-adherence to mCOPD medications was associated with non-adherence to 10 of 12 
non-COPD medication classes (odds ratio 1.38–1.78, all P,0.01). 
Conclusion: Adherence to mCOPD medications is low. Non-adherence (or adherence) to 
mCOPD medications is positively related to non-adherence (or adherence) to non-COPD 
medications, implying that the need to take medications prescribed for comorbid conditions 
does not adversely impact adherence to mCOPD medications.

Introduction
Chronic lower respiratory diseases are the third leading cause of death in the US.1 
One of the most prevalent diseases in this category is COPD, which is characterized 
by persistent airflow limitation.2 In the US, COPD affects approximately 24 million 
adults.3 COPD is a progressive disease, with typical symptoms including sputum 
production, cough, and chronic and progressive dyspnea.2 Exacerbations, the sudden 
worsening of typical COPD symptoms, often complicate COPD, and are associated 
with reduction in health-related quality of life, declines in lung function, and increased 
hospitalizations and mortality.4

Dhamane et al
Although the long-term decline of lung function in 
COPD patients cannot be reversed by pharmacotherapy, 
medications are available to prevent and control symptoms, 
improve health status, and reduce the occurrence of COPD 
exacerbations.2 Medication adherence levels for COPD medi-
cations have been found to be well below the levels typically 
observed for treatments for other conditions.5–8 For example, 
in a 2011 study of US military veterans, proportion of patients 
adherent to COPD treatments, defined as proportion of days 
covered (PDC) $0.80, was reported to be approximately 30% 
versus 40%–63% for coronary artery diseases, diabetes, heart 
failure, and hyperlipidemia treatments.8
One potential reason for lower adherence to COPD medi-
cations may be the daily variations in symptoms experienced 
by COPD patients. Symptoms specific to COPD, such as 
breathlessness, cough, and sputum production, may fluctuate 
daily. Physicians typically prescribe rescue medications to 
alleviate these symptoms, and advise their patients to adjust 
their rescue medication use according to the symptoms 
experienced on any given day.2,9 Additionally, physicians 
often prescribe these rescue medications in conjunction with 
COPD maintenance medications depending on severity of 
the disease. Instructions to use or not use rescue medications 
based on symptoms while also managing maintenance medi-
cations that are often available in different delivery devices 
may result in patient confusion. This complexity could ulti-
mately lead patients to deviate from their prescribed dosing 
regimen of COPD maintenance medications.
Furthermore, COPD patients typically have multiple 
chronic comorbidities including conditions such as hyper-
tension, coronary atherosclerosis, other heart diseases, lipid 
disorders, diabetes, osteoporosis, and sleep apnea.10,11 In 
one study, 78% of participants with COPD had one or more 
comorbidities, compared with about 50% of participants 
without COPD.12 It is expected that COPD patients are pre-
scribed several concurrent therapies for these comorbidities, 
and COPD medication adherence may be impacted by this 
comorbidity burden and the correspondingly complex medi-
cation regimen. Other common reasons for non-adherence to 
medications in general include health system factors such as 
medication reimbursements and time spent with physicians, 
socioeconomic factors such as income and transportation, and 
patient-related factors such as knowledge and beliefs.13
In this study, we sought to describe and assess the 
association between adherence to maintenance COPD 
(mCOPD) medications and adherence to medications used 
to treat chronic conditions other than COPD (non-COPD 
medications). Understanding the relationship may provide 
further insight into the reasons for suboptimal adherence 
rates for COPD medications.
Methods
Design and data source
This observational study utilized retrospective adminis-
trative claims data from the Humana Research Database 
(Louisville, KY, USA) from January 1, 2008 to December 
31, 2012 (study period). Data used for the study included 
inpatient and outpatient medical and pharmacy claims as 
well as enrollment information for members participating 
in commercial insurance plans and Medicare Advantage 
plans with Prescription Drug benefits (MAPD). The study 
protocol, waiver of written informed consent, and waiver of 
authorization to use and disclose protected health informa-
tion were approved by Schulman IRB. (Cincinnati, OH, 
USA), an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
fully accredited by the Association for the Accreditation of 
Human Research Protection Programs (registration number 
is 00000971). This study followed the principles outlined in 
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Patient selection
Patients included in this study population were required 
to have a COPD diagnosis and were also required to initi-
ate mCOPD medication within a year of COPD diagnosis. 
A COPD diagnosis was determined by presence of two or 
more medical claims with a COPD diagnosis code (Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification [ICD-9-CM] code: 491.xx [chronic bronchitis], 
492.xx [emphysema], or 496.xx [COPD, unspecified]) in 
primary or secondary position during the identification period 
of January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010. The two medical 
claims with a COPD diagnosis code had to occur on separate 
days, occurring no more than 90 days apart. The earliest date 
of the medical claim with a COPD diagnosis code served as the 
index date. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled 
in a commercial or MAPD plan for a 12-month period prior 
to the index date (pre-index period) and a 24-month period 
following index date (post-index period) and were required to 
be between the age of 40 and 89 years on the index date.
To assess initiation of mCOPD medication therapy 
within a year of COPD diagnosis, patients were required to 
have at least one prescription claim for a mCOPD medica-
tion (most frequently prescribed classes of mCOPD medi-
cations during the study identification period: long-acting 
muscarinic antagonists [LAMA] and inhaled corticosteroid-
long-acting beta agonist [LABA] fixed-dose combinations,

adherence to COPD medications and adherence to other chronic medications
Table 1) during the first 365 days of the 24-month post-
index period. This criterion allowed for the assessment of 
1-year mCOPD medication adherence in the post-index 
period. The date of the first prescription claim for a mCOPD 
medication was termed the mCOPD medication start date. 
In addition, to assess initiation of non-COPD medication 
(Table 1, medications use to treat chronic conditions other 
than COPD), patients were required to have at least one 
prescription claim for a non-COPD medication and this 
claim had to occur within 30 days of the mCOPD medica-
tion start date.
Patients were excluded from the study if they had $1 
medical claim with any of the following ICD-9-CM diagnosis 
codes in any position during the study period: 277.0x (cystic 
fibrosis), 011.x (pulmonary tuberculosis), or 140.xx-172.xx, 
174.xx-209.3x, 209.7x (malignant neoplasms).
adherence to mCOPD medications
Adherence to mCOPD medications was the main outcome 
variable of this study. Adherence was measured in terms 
of the PDC. PDC was measured over a 365-day period fol-
lowing the mCOPD medication start date. PDC for mCOPD 
medications was defined as the sum of the number of non-
overlapping days-supply of prescriptions for mCOPD medi-
cations, divided by 365. No credit was given for overlap of 
days-supply.14 Patients were deemed adherent to mCOPD 
medications if the PDC was greater than or equal to the 0.80 
threshold and non-adherent otherwise.
adherence to non-COPD medications
Adherence to non-COPD medications was hypothesized to 
have an impact on adherence to mCOPD medications. This 
was also assessed using PDC.14 It was measured from the 
date of the first prescription for a non-COPD medication 
and ended at 364 days following the mCOPD medication 
start date. PDC for non-COPD medications was defined as 
the sum of the number of nonoverlapping days-supply of 
prescriptions for non-COPD medications, divided by 365. 
No credit was given for overlap of days-supply.14 Patients 
were deemed adherent to non-COPD medications if the 
PDC was greater than or equal to the 0.80 threshold and 
non-adherent otherwise.
Adherence to each of the following 12 non-COPD 
medication classes were measured: statins, antihypertensives, 
anticoagulants, oral antihyperglycemics, insulins, antidepres-
sants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), 
antianxiety, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, bis-
phosphonates, and diuretics (Table 1). These 12 non-COPD 
medication classes were identified based on the medications 
prescribed for the most common comorbidities observed in 
the selected patient population.
Baseline patient characteristics 
Baseline patient characteristics were measured to describe the 
study population and included age (as of index date), sex, and 
geographic location (as of index date) and influenza vaccina-
tion status. Influenza vaccination status was defined as null, 
partial, or full based on the number of pharmacy or medical 
claims for influenza vaccines and the timing of these claims 
during the 24-month post-index period as follows: null = 
zero pharmacy or medical claims indicating an influenza 
vaccine during the post-index period; partial = one pharmacy 
or medical claim indicating an influenza vaccine during the 
post-index period; full = at least two pharmacy and/or medi-
cal claims indicating an influenza vaccine and occurring at 
least 6 months apart during the post-index period. General 
comorbidity burden was assessed using the RxRisk-V score. 
The RxRisk-V score is a prescription claim-based comorbid-
ity index. This score involves the creation of 45 indicators 
for general drug categories (eg, human immunodeficiency 
virus drugs, diabetes drugs) and durable medical equipment 
(DME) categories. These indicator variables are summed 
to create the total RxRisk-V score. For this study, the DME 
categories were not included for the RxRisk-V calculation.

Only the 42 drug categories were included. The RxRisk-V 
has been rigorously tested and has demonstrated concordance 
with the Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index score.15
statistical analysis
Summary statistics including mean, median, and interquartile 
range were provided for adherence to mCOPD and non-
COPD medications. Summary statistics for baseline patient 
characteristics were also reported for the study population and 
compared between patients adherent (PDC $0.8) and non-
adherent (PDC ,0.8) to mCOPD medications. Unadjusted, 
statistical comparisons of baseline patient characteristics 
were made between patients adherent (PDC $0.8) and 
non-adherent (PDC ,0.8) to mCOPD medications using 
chi-square and non-parametric Wilcoxon Mann–Whitney 
(rank sum) test for categorical and continuous variables, 
respectively.
Association between adherence to mCOPD and non-
COPD medications was assessed using a logistic regres-
sion model controlling for baseline patient characteristics 
including age, sex, region, influenza vaccination status, and 
RxRisk-V score. The dependent variable for this model 
was non-adherence (PDC ,0.8) to mCOPD medications, 
and the main independent variables of this model were 
non-adherence (PDC ,0.8) to each of the 12 non-COPD 
medication classes. Odds ratios along with 95% confidence 
intervals were reported.
Results
The study population consisted of a total of 14,117 COPD 
patients that met all study criteria (Figure 1) with a mean 
age of 69.9 years; 40.9% of the patients were males and two-
thirds of the study population were residing in the southern 
US. The mean RxRisk-V score was 7.2, and 38.9% of the 
study population did not receive a claims-identifiable influ-
enza vaccination during the post-index period.
On the index date, 32.0% had a pharmacy claim for a 
LAMA only, 59.8% had a claim for an ICS/LABA only, and 
8.2% had claims for LAMA and ICS/LABA. Mean adher-
ence to mCOPD medications was 0.47, and less than one 
quarter (20.8%) of the study population was deemed adher-
ent based on the threshold of PDC $0.80. Baseline patient 
characteristics stratified by mCOPD medication adherence 
status are presented in Table 2. No statistically significant 
differences were found between the patients adherent to 
mCOPD medications and non-adherent to mCOPD medi-
cations with respect to sex and age, but there were statisti-
cally significant differences with respect to geographical 
location, comorbidity burden, and influenza vaccination 
status. The non-adherent group was more likely to reside in 
the south (67.5% vs 59.2%, P,0.0001) and less likely to 
reside in the northeast (P=0.0003), Midwest (P,0.0001) 
and west (P=0.0037) compared to the adherent group. The 
non-adherent group also had a greater comorbidity burden 
compared to the adherent group (mean RxRisk-V score 7.2 
vs 7.0, P,0.0001), was less likely to have the recommended

frequency of influenza vaccinations (influenza vaccination 
status = full: 29.1% vs 32.0%, P=0.0023), and had a higher 
proportion of patients without any influenza vaccinations 
during the post-index period compared to the adherent 
group (P,0.05).
Use of and adherence to the 12 classes of non-COPD 
medications are presented in Figure 2. Of the 12 classes 
examined, antihypertensives were the most commonly pre-
scribed (62.5%) non-COPD medication, while insulin was the 
least commonly prescribed (9.3%). Mean PDC for mCOPD 
medications was 0.47, whereas mean PDC for the non-COPD 
medication classes examined ranged from 0.33 to 0.71. 
Multivariate analyses showed that non-adherence to 
antidepressants, antihypertensives, oral antihyperglycemics, 
beta-blockers, bisphosphonates, calcium channel blockers, 
diuretics, insulins, NSAIDs, and statins was each indepen-
dently associated with increased odds of non-adherence 
to mCOPD medications (Table 3). Non-adherence to 
insulins, NSAIDs, and antidepressants had the strongest 
association with non-adherence to mCOPD medications. 
Patients non-adherent to insulins, NSAIDs, and antide-
pressants were 1.78 (P,0.01), 1.74 (P,0.0001), and 1.73 
(P,0.0001) times more likely to be non-adherent to mCOPD 
medications, respectively, after controlling for adherence or 
non-adherence with other medication classes and controlling 
for baseline patient characteristics. The model suggested that 
non-adherence to anticoagulants and antianxiety medications 
was not associated with non-adherence to mCOPD 
medications even with consideration of adherence or non-
adherence to the other medication classes (Table 3).
Discussion 
COPD is a debilitating disease and is often complicated by 
exacerbations.4 Although several medications are available 
to prevent and control COPD symptoms and exacerbations, 
a large proportion of COPD patients remain untreated.16 
Furthermore, medication adherence levels for mCOPD 
medications have been found to be suboptimal and lower 
than the levels typically observed for treatments for other 
conditions.5–8 One of the reasons for suboptimal adher-
ence to COPD medications may be due to the symptomatic 
nature of the disease leading to adjustment of medication 
use depending on how the patients feel on any particular 
day.9 Also, it is expected that COPD patients are prescribed 
several concurrent therapies since comorbidities are preva-
lent in these patients and may have an impact on COPD 
medication adherence.10,11 For this study, we hypothesized 
that adherence to mCOPD medications may be impacted by 
adherence to medications used to treat chronic conditions 
other than COPD.
Based on the literature review conducted at the time 
of this study, we believe our study is the first to explore 
the impact of overlapping use of non-COPD medications 
on COPD medication adherence. The results of this study 
suggest that there is a positive association between non-
adherence (or adherence) to mCOPD medications and

adherence to COPD medications and adherence to other chronic medications
non-adherence (or adherence) to non-COPD medications, 
ie, patients that are likely to be non-adherent (or adherent) 
to mCOPD medication are also likely to be non-adherent 
(or adherent) to non-COPD medications. This finding implies 
that adherence to medications may be impacted by factors 
that do not change regardless of disease or medication type 
but rather is influenced by aspects of the health system 
(lack of coordinated health care, access restrictions, etc) 
patient-related considerations (forgetfulness, suboptimal 
health literacy, etc), and socioeconomic status (education, 
income etc).13
The descriptive analysis results show that adherence for 
mCOPD medications was low (mean PDC =0.47) with only 
20% of the study population adherent to mCOPD medications 
based on the PDC $0.80 threshold. These suboptimal adher-
ence rate results are consistent with previous reports. Toy 
et al5 reported a PDC of 0.23–0.43 for inhaled COPD medica-
tions, while Neugaard et al8 reported that approximately 30% 
of patients were identified as adherent to COPD medications 
based on PDC $0.8 threshold in a Veterans Health Admin-
istration patient population.
Several health care payers and providers are focusing 
their efforts to improve medication adherence through 
multiple initiatives such as medication therapy manage-
ment, patient education, and counseling. Since our study 
findings imply that factors that do not change by medication 
type may be impacting adherence, more widespread use of 
patient counseling tools, such as motivational interviewing 
by pharmacists and other health care providers, may be able 
to influence patient behavior in improving their adherence 
irrespective of medication type.17
Limitations
This study has limitations consistent with other retrospec-
tive cohort studies conducted using administrative claims 
databases. First, although statistically significant associations 
have been shown, causal relationship cannot be determined 
from the study’s findings. Second, COPD medication adher-
ence was assessed based on incident COPD medication use, 
while prevalent use was evaluated for assessment of non-
COPD medication adherence. This potentially may have 
had an impact on the associations that were observed in 
this study. This approach was chosen to enable assessment 
of overlapping use of COPD and non-COPD medications. 
Limiting to only new users of non-COPD medications might 
have severely impacted the sample size. Third, adherence as 
measured by PDC might not represent true adherence, due 
to inability to track the use of physician samples and that a 
prescription claim does not guarantee drug use. Fourth, the 
study population was a predominantly Medicare popula-
tion, with an unbalanced geographic distribution in the US. 
Although 51% of the medical costs attributable to COPD in 
the US are paid for by Medicare and almost half of the COPD 
population is 65 years or older,18,19 generalizing the study 
findings to the entire US population should be approached 
with caution. Fifth, the total out of pocket costs for medica-
tions was not evaluated as a potential driver of medication 
adherence as it was expected that it would be directly propor-
tional to medication adherence. Lastly, inherent limitations of 
the administrative claims databases including coding errors 
and miscoding may have influenced the selection of the study 
population and result interpretation.
Conclusion
Adherence to mCOPD medications is low, which was known 
but verified by these data. Non-adherence (or adherence) to 
mCOPD medications is positively related to non-adherence (or 
adherence) to medications for other chronic conditions. This 
finding implies that adherence to medications may be impacted 
by factors such as health system-related factors, patient-related 
factors, and socioeconomic factors that do not change by dis-
ease or medication type. Thus, efforts to improve medication 
adherence should focus more generally on coordination of care, 
patient education, and patient cost containment.
