and dietary sources in Europe

Abstract
Public health policies, including in Europe, are considering measures and recommendations to limit the intake of
added or free sugars. For such policies to be efficient and monitored, a precise knowledge of the current situation
regarding sugar intake in Europe is needed. This review summarizes published or re-analyzed data from 11
representative surveys in Belgium, France, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, The Netherlands, Spain and the UK.
Relative intakes were higher in children than in adults: total sugars ranged between 15 and 21% of energy intake in
adults and between 16 and 26% in children. Added sugars (or non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES), in the UK) contributed
7 to 11% of total energy intake in adults and represented a higher proportion of children’s energy intake (11 to 17%).
Educational level did not significantly affect intakes of total or added sugars in France and the Netherlands. Sweet
products (e.g. confectionery, chocolates, cakes and biscuits, sugar, and jam) were major contributors to total sugars
intake in all countries, genders and age groups, followed by fruits, beverages and dairy products. Fruits contributed
more and beverages contributed less to adults’ total sugars intakes than to children’s. Added sugars were provided
mostly by sweet products (36 to 61% in adults and 40 to 50% in children), followed by beverages (12 to 31% in adults
and 20 to 34% in children, fruit juices excluded), then by dairy products (4 to 15% in adults and 6 to 18% in children).
Caution is needed, however, as survey methodologies differ on important items such as dietary data collection, food
composition tables or estimation of added sugars. Cross-country comparisons are thus not meaningful and overall
information might thus not be robust enough to provide a solid basis for implementation of policy measures. Data
nevertheless confirm that intakes of total and added sugars are high in the European countries considered, especially
in children, and point to sweet products and beverages as the major contributors to added sugar intakes.

Introduction
The role of excessive sugar intake on health and disease is
currently an active area of scientific and policy debate. Fol-
lowing a direction clearly indicated by WHO guidelines
[1], many countries are today considering regulations or
public health policy measures aiming at lowering sugar in-
takes in their population, and especially in children [2].
These concerns are justified by studies and reports indi-
cating that high intakes of sugars are associated with an
increased risk of dental caries [3], overweight [4] and
cardio-metabolic risk factors and mortality [5, 6]. How-
ever, uncertainty and controversies remain as to whether
sugar intake is directly related to these health outcomes or
whether they are rather due to an excessive energy intake
[7, 8]. For example, the change in body adiposity that oc-
curs with modifying sugar intakes seems to be mediated
via changes in energy intakes, since isoenergetic exchange
of sugars with other carbohydrates is not associated with a
difference in weight change [4]. By contrast, sugar intake
influences blood pressure and serum lipids, independently
of the effect of sugars on body weight [5]. In any case, de-
creasing sugar consumption is a good strategy to lower ex-
cessive energy intake, which is relevant to the current
obesity epidemic.
Across countries, several different recommendations ad-
dress the intake of total, added, or “free” sugars. Free
sugars are defined as “monosaccharides and disaccharides
added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook
or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey,
syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates” by WHO,
which recommends reducing their intake to less than 10%

 of total energy intake for children and adults [1]. The
American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that chil-
dren use “the minimum amount of added sugar necessary
to promote the palatability, enjoyment, and consumption
of nutrient-rich food items” [9]. The 2015 edition of the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans also adopts a 10%
threshold for added sugars [10], and the amount of added
sugar will be labeled on US food packages in 2019 at the
latest [11]. The European situation is today contrasted: the
10% limit has been highlighted in the Nordic Nutrition
Recommendations since 2014 [12] and the UK has
adopted in 2015 an even more demanding threshold, with
a recommended intake of less than 5% of dietary energy
as free sugars [13]. Most other countries have not set
quantitative reference intakes, but guidelines may mention
that high intakes may be detrimental to nutrition and
health, for instance 20% of the energy as added sugars in
the Netherlands [14].
In order to promote dietary patterns fitting with the
current recommendations on free sugars consumption, the
first step should be to know the current intake of total,
added and free sugars, the adherence to the recommenda-
tions and the main food sources for sugars consumption.
Because obesity and diet-related diseases are especially
worrying in populations with lower incomes and educa-
tional levels [15], they should be a priority target and know-
ledge on sugar intakes in this population is warranted.
While intakes of sugars have recently been reviewed world-
wide [16], there is scarce information concerning the main
food sources of sugars and the role of education and in-
come levels. Scattered information has been published,
such as in Australia, where sugar-sweetened beverages
accounted for the greatest proportion of sugars consump-
tion, followed by sugar and sweet spreads, and by cakes,
biscuits and pastries [17]. In Canada, the major source of
added sugars was confectionery in children aged 1 to 8, and
soft drinks in older children, teens and adults [18].
In echo to the discussions currently occurring at the
European level [19], the present review aims to summarize
and review the available data from representative nation-
wide surveys in the European Member States concerning
the various characteristics of sugar intakes in children and
adults, with the aim of informing stakeholders and
policymakers.
Material & methods
Definition of sugars
From a biochemical point of view, sugars correspond to
dietary monosaccharides, i.e. glucose, fructose, and gal-
actose, and disaccharides, i.e. sucrose and lactose.
Distinctions are made between “total sugars”, encom-
passing all naturally occurring sugars and “added sugars”,
corresponding to those added to foods by the manufac-
turer, cook or consumer. Several ingredients can be used
for this purpose, including sucrose, fructose, glucose, high
fructose syrup or concentrated fruit juices, some of them
also being naturally present in foods. Some surveys report
the intake of sucrose as the sole information about sugar
intakes. However, sucrose should neither be confused with
added sugars nor with total sugars, as several other sugars
can be added to foods and as sucrose is naturally present
in foods such as fruits. A third concept, referring to “free
sugars”, defined as “added sugars plus sugars naturally
present in honey, syrup and fruit juices” has been defined
by WHO [1]. In the UK, a slightly different entity has been
used in the survey analyzed in this report, named “non-
milk extrinsic sugars” (NMES), which corresponds to
sugars not contained within the cellular structure of a
food, except lactose in milk and milk products. The differ-
ence between NMES and free sugars is that non-milk ex-
trinsic sugars include 50% of the fruit sugars from stewed,
dried or canned fruit (assuming that processing changes
intrinsic sugars into extrinsic ones) but free sugars does
not take processing effects into account [20]. In this re-
view, data have been gathered on total sugars, added
sugars and NMES; only one survey reported intakes on
“free sugars” [21]. In some studies analyzed in this review,
the wording “soluble carbohydrates” can be found, and
this term was assumed to correspond to “sugars” [22].
Survey selection
Our purpose was to identify representative nation-wide
surveys, which have been systematically searched for on
Medline, using the key words [sugar AND (intake or diet
or survey)] associated to the name of each of the EU 28
countries, plus Switzerland and Norway. This retrieved
107 hits, with one of them only fitting to our criteria. A
hand search was thus undertaken on Google, and on the
websites of national Public Health Authorities or Agen-
cies in European countries. For the purpose of this re-
view only country-representative surveys carried out in
Europe and which reported exploitable data on sugar in-
takes were selected. Selection criteria and study eligibil-
ity were agreed among all authors. When several surveys
were identified in the same country, only the most re-
cent was analyzed and no survey older than 20 years was
retained since the aim was to present the most current
intakes. Eleven nation-wide surveys, providing reliable
data on total and/or added sugars or NMES have been
identified in 10 countries: Belgium [23], Denmark [24],
France [25], Hungary [26], Ireland [27, 28], Italy [22, 29],
the Netherlands [21, 30], Norway [31], Spain [32, 33],
and the UK [34] (Table 1). Information has been also
identified from representative surveys carried out in
Austria
[35],
Finland
[36]
and
Germany
[37,
38].
However, the Austrian and Finnish reports provided
sugar data for sucrose only, and the German survey
reported separately figures for monosaccharides and

 disaccharides. As these data were not in a format con-
sistent with those of the other surveys, they were not in-
cluded in the tables or figures, but were considered in
the results and discussion.
Survey designs
The identified surveys differed by several parameters,
such as the age range of the considered populations, the
dietary data collection methods or the year of the field
survey (Table 1). Random sampling was performed to
ensure the best possible representativeness of the popu-
lation of the country, using most often electoral registers
[39], census information or phone books, followed by
appropriate weighting for socio-demographic parame-
ters, such as in France, the Netherlands, the UK, and
Germany [25, 30, 34, 37], but not in Denmark [24].
While most surveys were reported as having been car-
ried out over the four seasons of the year and have re-
corded data on week and week-end days, statistical
adjustment for seasonality and week of the day have only
been performed in France and the Netherlands [25, 30].
Under-reporting or over-reporting subjects were identi-
fied in many surveys [23, 25–27, 30, 37, 40]. Extreme re-
porters were excluded in most cases, but not in Norway
[31], the Netherlands [30] or Italy [40] and, in Ireland,
only for adults but not children [27]. In Denmark and
Germany, exclusion of extreme reporters was not clearly
acknowledged [24, 37]. We had access to both the raw
dataset from the Dutch [30] and the French [25] dietary
surveys, which have been re-analyzed specifically for this
review when information was missing from the reports
or publications.
Dietary assessment
Dietary data collection was carried out with different
tools, developed specifically in each country, except in
the Netherlands and in Belgium, which both used the
EPIC-software [41]. As a consequence, the coding of the
recorded food items varies across countries, which re-
sulted in different classifications of foods within groups,
categories and subcategories. Harmonized food categor-
ies, i.e. containing similar food sub-groups, have been
elaborated by redistributing food sub-groups in a con-
sistent way, when possible and as shown in Table 2.
Only categories that contribute significantly to sugar in-
takes were considered. In the Irish surveys, contributions
of added sugars were given but these surveys omitted
some important categories, such as processed fruits or
dairy products; these data have not been included in ta-
bles and figures [27].
Assessment of added sugars and NMES
Also of relevance is the way the intake in added sugars
or in NMES has been estimated. To our knowledge, no
national food composition database currently contains
values for added or free sugars. The method used to

 estimate the content of added sugar was not clearly de-
tailed in Hungary and Norway [26, 31]. In France,
Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK [21, 25, 28, 34], the
added sugars content was approached using disaggregated
recipes, either as they existed in the national food com-
position database or defined from cookbook or manufac-
turer’s information, and/or using the ingredient list or
other piece of information from the labeling. Naturally oc-
curring sugars from fruits, vegetables and milk were not
included. In Denmark [24], the whole sugar in specific
food groups, such as sweets, cakes, soft drinks, desserts,
breakfast cereals were considered as added sugars.
Statistical analysis
Because of significant differences in the surveys’ method-
ologies, it would be inappropriate to comment on the dif-
ferences observed across countries, but some trends can
be identified, which have not been statistically treated.
When assessing the relationship between the educational
level and sugar intakes (Table 5), original data from the
French and the Dutch surveys were re-analyzed and the
educational levels were defined as follows: for the
Netherlands, ‘low’ was assigned to primary and lower vo-
cational education,
’intermediate’ to advanced elementary,
intermediate vocational and higher general secondary
education and ‘high’ to university or higher vocational
education; for France,‘low’ was assigned to mid-secondary
or below,‘intermediate’ to high school and ‘high’ to univer-
sity education. Total and added sugar intakes across levels
of education were calculated using general linear models.
Models were adjusted for age (years), sex, and energy
(kcal/day). A P-value for trend was calculated with a con-
trast statement.
Results
Intake in total sugars
Table 3 displays an overview of the intakes in total
sugars in adults and children, for both genders, in abso-
lute values (g/day) as well as a percentage of the daily
energy. In all countries and at all ages, women/girls had
a lower intake in sugars than men, when expressed in g/
day, but this difference disappeared when the sugar con-
tribution to the total energy intake was considered, likely
reflecting the higher energy intake of males. In adults,
sugar contributed more to women’s than to men’s energy
intake (8 to 17% more, except in the UK: +3.5%). This
result is confirmed in Germany, where the estimated en-
ergy contribution of sugar (sum of mono- and disaccha-
rides, data not shown) was 19.3 and 24.0% in men and
women respectively, aged 15 to 80 [37].
In children, this trend is much weaker and often does
not exist, which is consistent with the absence of a gender
difference in total energy intake in younger children. Of
relevance is also the higher intake and energy contribution
of sugars in children as compared with adults. This
was observed to a large extent in Belgium, where
sugar intakes were 30% higher in children, or in the
Netherlands (22% higher), but less so in the UK (8%
higher). In Belgium, 80.1% of the adult population and
94.6% of the child population was exceeding 15% of
energy provided by total sugars [23].
In all surveys, except those from France [25] and
Norway [31], data were also available on more detailed
age ranges, in addition to those displayed in Table 1.
Available data suggest that the contribution of sugar to
energy was slightly higher in younger children than in
older ones; in Ireland, this contribution is of 23.9 ± 5.3%
in children aged 5 to 12, vs 20.4 ± 5.0 in the 13 to 17 age
group [27] and similar observations can be made in the
UK ([34]; data not shown). In adults, there might be a
trend toward a slight decrease in the energy provided by
sugars with increasing age. In Belgium, total sugar is
19.9 ± 5.8% of the energy intake in the group aged 19 to
59, 19.1 ± 5.3% in people aged 60 to 74 and 18.7 ± 6.1%
in those above 75 [23]. However, this trend is not ob-
served in the older groups in other countries: in the UK
or in Spain, the elderly above 65 have respectively 1.8 or
1.6% more energy from sugar than the adults aged 19 to
64 [32, 34].
Intake in added sugars or NMES
Table 4 displays an overview of the intakes in added
sugars or NMES (UK) in adults and children, for both
genders, in absolute values (g/day) and as a percentage
of the daily energy. The same gender differences as for
total sugars were seen for added sugars, in each country,
with a higher intake in men (+14% in Hungary [26] and
up to +49% in the UK [34]). The contribution of added
sugars to the energy intake was not dependent on gen-
der, in adults or in children. Conversely, there is a strong
age effect: added sugar contributes at least 30% more to
total energy intake in children vs adults (from + 32% in
Ireland [28] up to + 50% in the Netherlands [30]).
Austrian and Finnish national surveys report data on
sucrose intakes only, which were in the same order of
magnitude as the added sugars. In Austria, adults aged 25
to 50 y received 9% of their energy intake from sucrose,
girls and boys aged 13–14 received respectively 11 and
10% [35]. In Finnish adults aged 24–64 y, men consumed
daily 53.5 ± 37.1 g of sucrose (9.7 ± 5.9% of energy) vs
42.9 ± 26.3 g (10.5 ± 5.1% of energy) in women [36].
In the Netherlands, 45 and 10% of the adults and chil-
dren, respectively, received less than 10% of their energy
as added sugars [21]. In the UK, the median intake of
NMES in adults is 10.6% of energy, indicating that half
of the adult population had a higher intake and that
many more were exceeding the 5% UK threshold for free
sugars. In children, the median NMES intake was above

 14%, suggesting that a larger proportion than in the
adults’ population was exceeding recommended thresh-
olds (data not shown) [34].
Educational level
In Table 5, intakes of total and added sugar are displayed
according to educational level in the Netherlands and
France, adjusted for age, sex, and energy intake. In the
Netherlands, total sugar intake did not differ greatly ac-
cording to educational level. Added sugar intake was sig-
nificantly lower with a higher educational level, both in
adolescents and adults. In France, total sugar intake was
lower in children and adolescents with a higher educa-
tional level vs a lower one, but the trend seems in the op-
posite direction for adults. However, for total as well as for
added sugar, no significant trend can be detected.
Contributors to intake of total sugars
Contributions of different food groups to intakes of total
sugars are displayed in Fig. 1 and Table 6. Sweet prod-
ucts (Table 2) were major contributors to the intake of
total sugars in all countries and across genders and ages.
The other important contributors were fruits and vege-
tables, beverages and dairy products, with a ranking
which may vary according to geographies and ages.
Fruits and vegetables were major contributors (more
than 20% of total sugar intakes) in Southern European
adults (Spain, Italy and France), but less so in the
Netherlands or Belgium (11 to 18%). In children, this
high level of contribution of fruits and vegetables to in-
take of total sugars remained in Italy only.
In all countries, beverages contributed more to intakes
of total sugars in children than in adults (+15 to +30% in
children vs adults) and in Italy sugars from beverages con-
tributed twice as much to children’s energy intake than to
adults’. Soft drinks provided more sugars than fruit juices
in most countries and most age ranges, especially in the
Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, whereas in Italy and
France, sugars intakes from beverages were lower and
came nearly equally from juices and soft drinks. Overall,
the dairy contribution to total sugar intakes was the lowest
in Italy and the highest in Spain and France. Milk and
dairy beverages were the major contributors within dairy
products, especially in children.
Contributors to intake in added sugars and NMES
Figure 2 and Table 7 display the available information re-
garding the food sources of added sugars or NMES. Sweet
products provided 47 to 61% of those in adults and 40 to
50% in children. Beverages were the second highest con-
tributor to added sugars, except in French adult women.
They provided 12 to 31% of those in adults and 20 to 37%
in children and most of this contribution came from soft
drinks, with 0 to 5% of added sugars coming from fruit
nectars (i.e. drinks which contain at least 55% of fruit
juices and to which sugar can be added). When NMES are
considered rather than added sugars, fruit juices became
significant contributors, which translated into a higher
overall contribution of beverages in the UK, compared

 with other countries. In adults, alcoholic beverages had
a small, but real contribution to adults’ intakes of added
sugars or NMES. Irish [27] and Danish [24] data, al-
though using a different definition of food categories
were, however, globally consistent with this picture,
with sweet products as first contributors, followed by
soft drinks (data not shown).
The contribution of dairy products to added sugars or
NMES was between 4 and 16% in adults and between 6
and 18% in children, the highest contribution being ob-
served in France. Dairy beverages provided 20% to a
third of dairy added sugars, except in France where dairy
beverages, consumed mostly at home by children are in-
cluded in the “hot beverages” section. Yoghurt and dairy
desserts contributed roughly equally.
Discussion
This review has focused on nation-wide representative
studies carried out in Europe where exploitable informa-
tion about total sugar intake was found for 13 countries,
i.e. Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands,
Norway, the UK, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany,

 Italy and Spain. Only the first seven of these surveys pro-
vided estimates on added sugar intake.
While differences in methodological surveys prevent
direct and statistical comparisons between countries,
some relevant conclusions can be deduced from the
data, which may inform initial policy steps by identifying
extent of excess in sugar intakes as well as the major
contributors in the concerned age ranges. Sugars have a
significant contribution to total energy intake in all
countries, genders and age groups, with approximate
ranges of 14.5 to 20.5% in adults and 15.6 to 25.6% in
children. This difference between adults and children
appears even larger when added sugars or NMES are
considered, which contribute 7.3 to 11.4% to energy in-
take in adults and 11.0% to almost 16.8% in children. A
higher sugar intake in children vs adults is not a recent
feature: in the first NHANES (National Health and Nu-
trition Survey) survey in the USA, in 1971–1975, total
sugar was already contributing 22% more to children’s
energy intake than to adult’s. This age difference was less
important (10%) 17 years later [42].
The ratio of added sugars or NMES over total sugar is
always higher in children than it is in adults, in the stud-
ies we have identified. This is especially clear in France,
where 49.8 and 64.4% of the sugars consumed by adults
and by children respectively are added sugars, but this
trend
can
be
also
seen
in
Ireland,
UK
and
the
Netherlands. A French survey, different from the one re-
ported in Table 7, found that 44.8% of children aged 3 to
17, but 73.9% of adults, received less than 12.5% of their
energy from sugars coming from sweet products, a
group that comprised honey, jam, chocolate and confec-
tionery, cakes, pastries, biscuits, desserts, fruit juices,
soft drinks, and breakfast cereals [43]. It is unclear if this
difference is due to a generational effect, with children
being more prone to sweet/sweetened products than
adults, or to a trend to consume more added sugars,
which might lead children to maintain high intakes
when they become adults. This difference might also be
cultural, as it is not observed in the USA, where added
sugars represent around 65% of total sugars in both age
ranges, with no changes between 1971 and 1988 [42].

 Age differences can also be noticed when address-
ing the food groups that contribute the most to in-
takes of total sugar or added sugars/NMES. Fruits
and vegetables contribute more and beverages con-
tribute less to adults’ intakes in total sugars relative
to those of children, in the four countries where age
comparisons are possible. Age appears to be less
strongly associated with contributors to added sugars
or NMES, although a trend might be identified that
adults obtain more of their added sugars from sweet
products than do children, with the opposite being
seen for beverages.
Globally, and independently of age, gender and coun-
tries, four food groups contribute to more than 85% of
intakes in total sugars, which are sweet products, bever-
ages, fruits and vegetables and dairy products. Sweet
products and beverages provide more than two-thirds of
added sugars or NMES, while dairy products contributes
to 11 to 14% of added sugars and to 5% of NMES. Of
relevance is the fact that products in these different food

 categories present different nutritional densities and thus
do not have the same role in the diet. For example, cakes,
pastries and sweets, and even more so soft drinks, usually
provide low amounts of minerals, vitamins and fiber, and
their favorable contribution to the supply in shortfall nu-
trients is limited, while dairy products are key contributors
to calcium intake, and pure fruit juices are significant con-
tributors to vitamin C intakes. In French children, for ex-
ample, the sweet products category contributes to 48% of
added sugar intakes and 16% of the intake of fiber, and
sweetened beverages provide 14.4% of added sugars with
no significant supply in any shortfall nutrient. By contrast,
fresh dairy products provide 11.4% of the calcium supply
and 8.3% of the added sugars (re-analyzed from [25]). In
the UK, pure fruit juices, which contain no added sugars,
but which are accounted for in the NMES estimate, con-
tribute to 18% of the vitamin C supply in children aged 11
to 18 and to 11% of their NMES intake [34]. This should
be taken into account when defining policy measures
intended to lower added sugar without lowering the diet-
ary intake of desired nutrients.
Re-analyzed data from the Netherlands and France
showed that a lower educational attainment was associ-
ated with a higher added sugar intake; however, this was
only statistically significant in Dutch adults. For total
sugar intake, no such trend was observed in either
France or the Netherlands. In a previous publication of
the Dutch Food Consumption Survey 2007–2010 also
only minor differences in consumption of total, free, and
added sugars across income levels were observed [21].
No other European studies were found studying the as-
sociation between sugar intake and measures of socio-
economic status. In the US., data from four surveys from
2003 to 2010 showed that adults with a lower income
consumed
more
added
sugars
than
higher-income
adults; no trend was observed in children [44]. Another
US study on data from the National Health Interview
Survey 2005 showed that a lower family income and
educational status were each independently associated
with a higher added sugar intake [45]. Furthermore, both
low-income adults and children had a higher intake of
sugar-sweetened
beverages

 counterparts [46]. Thus, previous findings from the US
show a clearer trend between added sugar intake and
socio-economic status than in Europe. This may be ex-
plained by the fact that in the US, energy-dense foods
that are high in added sugars, refined grains, and fats are
less costly than foods with a high nutrient density [47]
and these cost differences may be more pronounced
than in Europe.
Strengths of this review are its European focus and the
representativeness of the surveyed populations. It also ad-
dresses in detail the contribution of different food groups
to sugar intakes and the importance of educational levels,
two considerations of outmost importance when public
health policies are foreseen. Limitations also exist, that
should be taken into account when interpreting the re-
sults. It cannot be guaranteed that all existing studies have
been identified; it is possible that some surveys, available
only in national languages, have been missed and it is
likely that raw data from studies informing on total sugar
can be exploited further for added sugar intakes, but we
had no access to the original information.
Survey methodologies differ one from each other, on
important features and at most steps of the survey
process. These differences concern sampling procedures,
and thus representativeness, but also the dietary data
collection (dietary recall on 2, 3, 4 or 7 days and fre-
quency check in a single study) and its management
(softwares and grouping of foods, food composition ta-
bles, adjustment for confounding factors) as well as the
display of results which often consider different age or
gender groups and can be expressed with various units
(weight, % of daily energy, energy intake accounting or
not for alcohol, etc.). A significant weakness comes from
the lack of robustness when dealing with added sugars.
Although attempts are currently being made to find spe-
cific biomarkers [48], there is today no analytical means
to measure added sugars, which have to be estimated
through different methods. These methods are open to
interpretation, as they are subjective and require a num-
ber of assumptions to be made about the types and
sources of sugars present in the food. This is especially
true for composite and processed foods such as break-
fast cereals and many others. Of note also is the lack of
information pertaining to “free” sugar intake, despite the
fact that this item is concerned in the WHO or UK rec-
ommendation [1, 13].
The
development
of
systematic
methodology,
as
attempted in Australia [49], would be welcomed in
Europe. Indeed, the difference in the methods currently
used to estimate added sugars can lead to inappropriate
estimates. For example, in Denmark, all the sugar present
in cakes, desserts or breakfast cereals was considered as
added; this may have led to a slight overestimation of
added sugars (e.g. not considering lactose in a milk-
containing cake), when in other surveys, added sugar was
determined at the ingredient level, after disaggregation of
the recipe. These small differences should not be disre-
garded: the expected changes in added sugar intakes in
real life and at population levels may not be much higher,
especially during the initial steps of implementation of
policy measures.
As methodological differences across surveys make it
difficult to develop fact-based nutrition policies at the pan-
national level, the European Food Safety Agency is cur-
rently implementing and promoting among the European
Member States a common methodology for dietary surveys,
which includes recommendations about sampling proce-
dures, data collection and treatment as well as on overall
quality assessment [50]. Today, more than 16 European
countries have been undertaking surveys according to these
guidelines and the first set of data should be available
shortly. Although these harmonized procedures will bring a
very significant improvement, the question will remain of a
reliable and comparable way to consider added sugars and/
or free sugars and to estimate their amount in the diet.
Conclusion
The available information on intakes in total or added
sugars and NMES in Europe suggests that total sugars
contribute to 15 to 25% of energy supply in several
European countries, among which 7.5 to 17% are added
sugars or NMES, the highest figure always being for
children or teens. While there is no recommended
threshold of appropriate intake for total sugars, there are
recommendations pertaining to free sugars, set by WHO
at 10% and by the UK at 5% of the total energy intake
[1, 13]. From the available data, a large proportion of the
European population, especially, but not only children,
appears to exceed the 10% threshold. A recent survey in
1630 European teens from eight different towns found
that 94% of them obtained more than 10% of their daily
energy from NMES [51]. Although it can be argued that
there is currently no firm evidence that added sugar is
more harmful than excess calories from any other food
source [52], these findings justify that the EU, as are
many individual countries, is working on public health
policy measures intended to lower intakes of added
sugars or NMES.
Reformulation of products containing added sugars
can be seen as one of the most straightforward routes.
Nevertheless this measure should be designed thought-
fully and should rather target foods and food groups for
which a decrease in sugar content would efficiently di-
minish the sugar supply in the target population. Simu-
lations performed in the UK clearly show that reducing
by half the sugar content of soft drinks would reduce by
14.4% the sugar intake of teens aged 11 to 18, while a
similar decrease in yoghurt and dairy desserts would

Page 13 of 15
 reduce it by 1.2% only. Figures are different in children
aged 4 to 10, with a 7.9 and 3.1% decrease in sugar in-
takes due to soft drink and yoghurt reformulations, re-
spectively (see annex 5 of reference [13]). This points
out the importance of having reliable and detailed data
about current food and nutrient intakes, in order to en-
able tailored policies that fit the needs of the population.
This information should be available on sugars and
added sugars, as well as on other nutrients, to allow for
a global evaluation of the foreseen policy measures, after
a few years of implementation. Although our review has
identified data in countries accounting for a significant
proportion of the European population, information is
still missing for a large proportion of European coun-
tries. In addition, the analysis and interpretation of the
currently available surveys only provide a limited and
heterogeneous knowledge of sugar intakes in Europe,
which might hamper the implementation and monitor-
ing of efficient policy measures.
