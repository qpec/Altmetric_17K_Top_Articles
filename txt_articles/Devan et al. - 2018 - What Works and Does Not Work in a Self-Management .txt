What Works and Does Not Work in a  
Self-Management Intervention for 
People With Chronic Pain?  
Qualitative Systematic Review and 
Meta-Synthesis

Background. Self-management interventions fostering self-efficacy improve the 
well-being of people with chronic pain.
Purpose. The purpose of this study was to synthesize the enablers (what works) 
and barriers (what does not) of incorporating self-management strategies for people in 
 
everyday life after completion of a pain self-management intervention. 
Data Sources. Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, AMED, PsycINFO, Cochrane 
 
Library, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched from inception to 
July 2016.
Study Selection. Study selection included qualitative and mixed-method studies that 
explored the perceptions of individuals with chronic pain after completion of a self- 
management intervention.
Data Extraction. A thematic analysis approach was used to synthesize the review 
findings, and a Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CER-
Qual) Approach was used to assess the level of confidence.
Data Synthesis. Thirty-three studies with 512 participants were included. Enablers 
to self-management included self-discovery—the ability to distinguish self (ie, body, 
thoughts, and feelings) from pain; feeling empowered by incorporating self-management 
strategies into practice; and supportive ambience via collaborative relationships with clini-
cians and support from family and friends. Barriers to self-management included difficulty 
with sustaining motivation for pain self-management; distress experienced from ongoing 
pain, anxiety, and depression; and unsupportive relationships with clinicians, family, and 
friends.
Limitations. This review only included interventions that involved at least 4 self- 
management skills; thus, informative studies may have been missed. The follow-up period 
varied from immediately after the intervention to 72 months following the intervention; 
therefore, it is uncertain which of the key enablers and barriers were most influential long 
term. Only articles published in the English language were included; studies conducted in 
low- and middle-income countries could not be located.  
Conclusions. The sustained effort to self-manage chronic pain could be exhausting, 
and motivation could wane over time following intervention. Providing intermittent 
support in the form of booster sessions and peer support groups may be important. 
 
Person-centered care via shared decision making and guided problem solving is essential 
to facilitating ongoing self-management.

 Chronic Pain and Self-Management Review
382  Physical Therapy Volume 98 Number 5 
May 2018
C
hronic pain is the leading cause 
of disability worldwide.1,2 Inter-
ventions 
focusing 
exclusively 
on pharmacological approaches have 
produced only short-term effects.3 
However, behavioral approaches, such 
as self-management support, improve 
well-being in individuals with chron-
ic pain conditions (eg, low back pain, 
postsurgery, and trauma).4 The self- 
efficacy4,5 gained from pain self-man-
agement support, facilitates behavior 
change and enables individuals to 
better manage their symptoms.5 Self- 
efficacy is one’s belief of being capable 
of exerting control over one’s behavior 
to engage in a desired outcome.6
Multidisciplinary 
pain 
management 
interventions facilitate and support 
the development of individual self- 
management strategies via active and 
passive approaches.7,8 Although pas-
sive support approaches (eg, informa-
tion provision via leaflets) may increase 
knowledge, this does not necessarily 
translate in to increased self-efficacy 
and behavior change.9 For passive sup-
port approaches to be effective, tailored 
information provision is important.8 
Further, when factors such as health 
literacy are considered passive support 
may not be appropriate.10 Therefore, 
passive support alone is less likely to 
foster behavior change particularly for 
addressing fear avoidant behaviors.7 
Conversely, active support approach-
es (eg, cognitive and behavioral strat-
egies) develop self-management skills 
via self-reflection, active goal setting 
and problem solving, and fostering col-
laborative patient-clinician partnerships 
(ie, therapeutic alliance).8,11 Strong ev-
idence suggests that multidisciplinary, 
pain management teams that have 
an ethos of active support, improve 
pain-related disability and depression 
in people with chronic pain.7 Further, 
individuals participating in such active 
support approaches are more likely to 
adopt active approaches to self-manage 
their symptoms long term.7
Reviews demonstrating positive health 
outcomes for active self-management 
approaches are predominantly quan-
titative.4,5,7,12 Given the biopsychoso-
cial focus of most pain management 
interventions, qualitative exploration 
of patients’ perceptions toward active 
self-management approaches and their 
lived experiences of using promoted 
strategies is warranted.13 Understand-
ing patient perspectives will inform fu-
ture implementation strategies by iden-
tifying the practical challenges patients 
experience when contemplating and 
applying strategies learned from such 
interventions.
One integrative review14 found that a 
variety of personal, psychological and 
treatment-related factors could be both 
facilitators and barriers to ongoing 
self-management in people with chron-
ic pain. However, the review provided 
a limited description of participants’ 
experiences from 8 qualitative studies. 
Further, the definition and types of 
self-management approaches (active 
vs passive support approaches) were 
not clear, limiting the interpretation of 
these results. As active approaches to 
self-management positively influence 
clinical outcomes in people with chron-
ic pain,7 understanding experiences of 
individuals’ participating in such inter-
ventions is essential to  
optimize the de-
sign and delivery of self- 
management 
interventions. The primary purpose 
of this meta-synthesis was to syn-
thesize the perceptions of individu-
als with chronic pain on the enablers 
(what works) and barriers (what does 
not) of incorporating and maintaining 
self-management strategies after com-
pletion of a self-management interven-
tion.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
The review protocol was registered 
with PROSPERO database of system-
atic reviews.15 The review is reported 
in compliance with the requirements 
of PRISMA16 and ENTREQ statement 
for reporting reviews of qualitative 
 
meta-synthesis.17
The following major electronic data-
bases were searched since inception 
until the last week of July 2016: MED-
LINE, AMED, PsycINFO, Cochrane Li-
brary (via Ovid), PubMed, CINAHL (via 
 
EBSCO), Scopus and Google Scholar. A 
supplementary search from previous-
ly published systematic reviews and 
from the Google Scholar citations of 
the included articles was also made. 
The search  
strategy is described in eAp-
pendix 1 (available at https://academic.
oup.com/ptj).
The primary investigator (H.D.) con-
ducted the electronic search in the 
above-mentioned databases. All ref-
erences were exported to Endnote 
 
(Version X7; Thomson Reuters, New 
York, New York), and H.D. conducted 
a title screen. Next, M.A.P
. and H.D. 
 
independently screened the abstracts 
and full texts of included articles. If a 
decision could not be reached, L.H. was 
available to facilitate a consensus.
Study Selection Process
Participants. Studies involving adults 
(16 years old and older) with chronic 
pain were included. Chronic pain was 
defined as persistent or recurring pain 
for more than 3 months.18 Chronic 
pain disorders were defined as chronic 
primary 
pain, 
posttraumatic 
and 
postsurgical pain, neuropathic pain, 
malignant pain, headache and orofacial 
pain, visceral pain, and musculoskeletal 
pain (eg, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid 
arthritis).18 Chronic primary pain was 
defined as pain in 1 or more anatomic 
regions and includes common pain 
conditions of unknown etiology (eg, 
nonspecific back pain, fibromyalgia, 
and irritable bowel syndrome).
Intervention. Self-management 
was 
 
defined as the “individual’s ability to 
manage the symptoms, treatment, phy-
sical and psychosocial  
con 
sequences 
and lifestyle changes inherent in 
living with chronic pain.”4(p178) The 
self-management 
intervention 
must 
have comprised at least 4 of the 
following 8 essential self-management 
skills: 
self-efficacy 
building, 
self-
monitoring of symptoms, goal setting 
and action planning, shared decision-
making, problem solving, self-tailoring, 
partner 
ship between the views of 
patients 
and 
health 
professionals, 
and proactive follow-up.8,11,12 There 
were no restrictions concerning the 
implementation of self-management 
intervention (ie, setting, provider, mode, 
format, and duration).15

Design. We included qualitative studies 
 
exploring the perceptions of individuals 
with chronic pain participating in a 
self-management 
intervention 
using 
qualitative data collection methods (eg, 
focus groups and individual interviews) 
and qualitative data analysis methods 
(eg, phenomenology and grounded 
theory). Mixed-method studies with 
a 
qualitative 
component 
and/or 
qualitative studies conducted alongside 
or after a randomized control trial 
assessing the effectiveness of a self-
management support intervention were 
also included.
We excluded studies that were not fo-
cused on experiences of participating in 
a self-management intervention. Studies 
using a quantitative analysis approach 
for qualitative data were excluded. 
Non-English peer-reviewed articles and 
conference abstracts and proceedings 
were not included.
Quality Assessment
The Critical Appraisal Skills Program 
(CASP) guidelines19 was used to ap-
praise the methodological quality. H.D. 
and M.A.P
. independently assessed 
the quality of individual studies. If an 
agreement could not be reached, L.H. 
was available to reach a consensus de-
cision.
Data Extraction
On the basis of previously published 
systematic reviews of qualitative stud-
ies,20,21 a general summary of included 
studies was extracted by H.D. and veri-
fied by M.A.P
.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Thematic synthesis was used for data 
synthesis.22 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
approach, 
a 3-step analysis23 was undertaken us-
ing NVivo (Version 11; QSR Internation-
al, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia): First, 
a line-by-line coding of text segments 
specific to review objectives was made 
from results and discussion sections of 
the included articles. Second, the raw 
codes were labeled to form “descriptive 
themes.” Next, “analytical themes” were 
generated from “descriptive themes” 
that went beyond the  
synthesis of in-
cluded articles. The  
generation of an-
alytical themes were primarily driven 
by our review questions (ie, inductive) 
with clear implications for practitioners 
and policy makers.23 Analytical themes 
were presented as a “main theme” and 
contributing “subthemes” and a visual 
framework was created to illustrate 
their relationships. An example of the 
thematic synthesis approach is present-
ed in eAppendix 2 (available at https://
academic.oup.com/ptj).
H.D. coded all the included articles, 
and M.A.P. and L.H. coded 8 (25%) 
randomly chosen included articles, re-
spectively. When coding was complet-
ed, the whole research team discussed 
the synthesis of findings (descriptive 
themes) and examined the analytical 
themes from the analysis. An iterative 
approach was undertaken by moving 
between the raw data from the origi-
nal articles to extract analytical themes 
emerging from the synthesis. We used 
diagrams and mind maps to discuss, 
debate, and explain the analytical 
themes. The final analytical themes 
were derived by consensus among the 
research team.
On the basis of recommendations of 
Cochrane Collaboration, a Confidence 
in the Evidence from Reviews of Qual-
itative Research (CERQual) Approach24 
was used to assess the level of confi-
dence (high, moderate, low, and very 
low) for the main themes and sub-
themes from the meta-synthesis (eAp-
pendix 3, supplementary material, avail-
able at https://academic.oup.com/ptj). 
The level of confidence was graded on 
the basis of 4 major criteria: methodo-
logical limitations, relevance, adequacy 
of data, and coherence.24 Themes/sub-
themes were rated as “high” confidence 
if the contributing studies were scored 
with minor concerns related to meth-
odological limitations, but scored high 
in relevance, coherence, and adequacy. 
Themes/subthemes were rated as “low” 
confidence if the contributing studies 
were scored with major concerns relat-
ed to methodological limitations and/
or scored low in adequacy criterion. 
Themes/subthemes from studies with 
mixed scores for all the 4 major criteria 
were graded as “moderate” confidence. 
H.D. conducted the critical appraisal 
process of the review findings in an 
 
Excel spread sheet  
(Microsoft Corp, 
Redmond, Washington), which was 
 
verified by M.A.P
.
Results
Identification of Studies
Our electronic search yielded 3995 ar-
ticles. Following the removal of dupli-
cates, 2626 articles were retained for 
further screening. After title, abstract, 
and full-text screening, 33 articles from 
33 studies25–57 were included for final 
synthesis (Fig. 1).
Description of Included Studies
A summary of the included stud-
ies is presented in Table 1. In 
total, 
512 
 
participants 
of 
both 
sexes, with a variety of chron-
ic pain conditions (eg, primary 
pain,25–27,29,31–37,40–48,5–-57 musculoskel-
etal pain,28,39 orofacial pain,38 pro-
voked vestibulodynia,30 migraine49) 
were 
interviewed. 
Studies 
were 
 
predominantly conducted in high- 
income countries such as the United 
Kingdom (n = 12),35,36,38,39,41–45,49,55 
 
Europe (n = 9),25,31,32,37,40,50,52,53,57 Unit-
ed States of America (n = 4),27,34,46,47 
Australia (n = 4),26,32,48,56 and  
Canada 
(n = 3).29,30,51 Four studies used 
mixed-method design,28,36,39,44 the re-
maining 
used 
a 
qualitative 
design 
only. 
Two studies used focus groups27,53 and 
31 used individual interviews for data 
 
collection.
Description of Self-Management 
Interventions
Self-management interventions com-
prised a wide range of strategies, but 
predominantly 
focusing 
on 
active 
approaches (eg, pacing, relaxation, 
 
cognitive behavioral strategies, coun-
seling, and ergonomic advice), along 
with some passive approaches (eg, ed-
ucation). No study bar one29 provided 
additional support via booster sessions. 
For 3 studies,33,42,43 the interventions 
were ongoing (eg, patients attending 
a community choir,42 multidisciplinary 
clinics,43 and use of a self-management 
website33), so it was difficult to interpret 
the long-term effects. In the remaining 
30, data were collected between 0 and 
72 months after the completion of the 
intervention.

Quality Assessment
Results of the quality appraisal of 
included studies are presented in 
 
Table 2. The percentage agreement 
between H.D. and M.A.P
. was substan-
tial; the adjusted kappa statistic (κ) 
was 0.79 (95% CI = 0.69–0.88). Nine 
studies32,41,42,45,49–51,55,57 met all of the 
10 CASP appraisal items. Four stud-
ies28,39,53,54 failed to meet 4 or more 
of the CASP items. Except for 5 stud-
ies,32,46,50,55,57 the majority of studies 
did not explicitly state the relationship 
between the researcher’s influence on 
study design and data analysis and 
scored poorly for the reflexivity ques-
tion (CASP item 6).
Summary of Thematic Synthesis
Table 3 describes the key themes, sub-
themes and supporting quotes along with 
level of confidence based on CERQual 
assessment (see supplementary material) 
from the 33 studies. Figure 2 presents the 
visual framework of enablers and barri-
ers to self-management. The framework 
illustrated that the ability to self-man-
age chronic pain could be described as 
a continuum with individuals exhibiting 
varying levels of ability. Shifts in ability to 
self-manage were not necessarily gradu-
al along the continuum. These shifts en-
compassed changes at the personal (cog-
nitive and behavioral strategies) level, 
and were influenced by external inputs 
(ie, clinicians, family, friends, and work) 
and the systems in which individuals 
worked or lived (Fig. 2).
Enablers to Self-Management
Theme 1: self-discovery. Self-discovery 
or the ability to distinguish self (ie, body, 
thoughts, and feelings) from pain, was 
a key cognitive process perceived by 
participants to change their relationship 
from 
“struggling with pain” to 
“coping with 
pain.”25,26,28–33,35–37,39–42,44,45,47,48,51–53,55–57 
Understanding 
the 
biopsychosocial 
nature and mechanisms underpinning 
chronic pain via education and peer 
learning30–32,34,35,37,38,45,47,51,53–55,57 provided 
an explanation for their pain and was 
perceived to be critical for changing 
core beliefs about pain and provided 
stress relief.28,34,39–41,45,54 Their change 
in relationship to pain was reported 
as an ongoing “trial and error” process 
where 
strategies 
(eg, 
knowledge, 
pacing, cognitive techniques) learned 
from 
the 
intervention 
were 
tested 
and tried during and following the 
intervention.28–30,32,34,35,37,39–43,45–48,51,52,55,57 
Positive experiences from trying new 
strategies acted as a catalyst for individuals 
to consistently try those new strategies 
and acted as a positive reinforcement 
to 
further 
self-reflect 
and 
change 
their relationship with pain. The new 
awareness also enabled them to be “in 
the present,” which brought them a sense 
of calmness and integration between their 
mind and body.
Theme 2: feeling empowered. Feeling 
empowered was critical for applying the 
skills learned during the intervention 
in to practice and regaining a sense 
of 
control.25,28–37,39–46,48,49,52,53,55,57 
For 
example, 
the 
self-management 
strategies 
learned acted as “tools”43(p209) to self-
manage symptoms. Accepting pain as 
part of their self and acknowledging the 
fact that it was possible to live life despite 
pain was integral to regain control of 
their lives.28–30,32,34,35,37,38,40–42,45–48,53,55–57 
Level of acceptance was also a 
continuum with individuals shifting 
from “finding a complete fix or 
becoming pain free” to “accepting 
pain as part of self” on a momentary 
basis.58 Being physically present with 
similar others in a group setting was 
empowering, as it provided a sense of 
normality and helped individuals to feel 
less 
isolated.25,27–30,32–46,48,53,55,57 They 
acknowledged the shared learning, 
opportunities for being listened to 
in an empathetic environment, peer 
validation, and being motivated by 
others, fostering positive role modeling.
Theme 3: supportive ambience.  A 
supportive ambience from clinicians, 
family, friends, and work environment 
positively influenced “self-discovery” 
and made individuals “feel empower-
ed” to continue to use the strategies 
following 
the 
intervention.

May 2018
collaborative 
partnership 
with 
clinicians (ie, therapeutic alliance) 
was paramount for developing the 
ability 
to 
maintain 
ongoing 
self-
management.27,32,34,40,43,44,46,49,50,52,55 
A strong therapeutic alliance was 
achieved via open and nonjudgmental 
communication, being believed and 
listened to, valuing the person and 
person centeredness by means of 
shared decision making and guided 
problem 
solving. 
Being 
believed 
and understood by significant others 
(family and friends) was also crucial 
for maintaining self-management.30,38,40 
Active 
participation 
of 
significant 
others in the intervention fostered 
understanding 
and 
was 
perceived 
to be beneficial for continued self-
management in home.30 Furthermore, 
a supportive work environment (eg, 
symptom legitimization and work place 
modification) empowered individuals 
with chronic pain and facilitated 
ongoing self-management.43
Barriers to Self-Management
Theme 4: sustained motivation. As 
self-managing chronic pain occurs on a 
day-to day basis, the practical challenges 
such as the dedication of time, associated 
with cognitive behavioral techniques 
were perceived as barriers to self-
manage. Practicing not thinking about 
pain often resulted in mental conflict, 
which reportedly increased their focus 
on pain instead of helping them to cope; 
and this was particularly difficult during 
flare-ups of pain.48,49 For some, inability 
to practice self-management strategies 
made them feel guilty, which led to self-
criticism and self-dislike.30,35,36,48,55,57  In 
addition, accepting pain as part of “self” 
was perceived as an act of surrender, with 
pain being in control.26,27,30–32,35,36,41,48,55–57 
The term and action of “acceptance” 
seemed 
counterintuitive, 
especially 
for those who held fixed biomedical 
beliefs toward their pain; thus, these 
participants continued to battle against 
pain by focusing on fixing their pain 
(ie, pain reduction/resolution) and 
consequently perceived the intervention 
as “unhelpful.”30,44,46,48,49,51,52,56 For some, 
letting go of biomedical beliefs was a 
constant battle.32
Theme 
5: 
distress. The 
distress 
experienced from ongoing pain, stress, 
fatigue, anxiety, and depression nega-
tively influenced the self-management 
abilities of participants following the 
intervention.27,30,32,33,36,40,41,47–52,55 
The 
above psychological stressors, along 
with daily efforts to self-manage chronic 
pain, cumulatively influenced their pain 
experience, and ultimately exerted a 
negative impact on their ability to self-
manage (Fig. 2). For some, due to fear 
of pain and/or reinjury, they continued 
to be fear avoidant and perceived 
using the strategies learned from 
the intervention (eg, pacing) as not 
useful.27,32,51,55 A few studies reported 
participants saying that symptoms of 
depression influenced their problem-
solving 
abilities 
and 
compounded 
their sustained efforts to manage 
their chronic pain after intervention 
 
completion.27,31,48,50
Theme 6: unsupportive ambience. An 
unsupportive ambience could also act 
as a stressor and make the ongoing self-
management efforts overwhelming as 
well as undermine individuals’ ability to 
self-manage. In particular, conflict with 
clinicians was felt as a major barrier 
to engage in the self-management 
process.27,29,31,32,38,43,48,50,52,56 In addition, 
poor explanation for their symptoms, 
conflicting views provided by different 
clinicians, feeling like they were not 
being listened to, and that clinicians 
were skeptical of their symptoms 
created a poor relationship.

cMixed-methods study.
When self-management interventions 
were not flexible enough for individual 
tailoring, this was also perceived as a 
barrier.25,27,30,33,36,37,41,49,50,52,57  
Limited un-
derstanding of the context of  
individuals’ 
lives and a lack of collaborative environ-
ment impeded participation in the inter-
vention and negatively influenced  
clinical 
outcomes. In addition, individuals felt 
that it was difficult for significant others 
(family and friends) to acknowledge the 
 
ongoing struggle in self-managing pain, 
owing to the invisible nature of pain, and 
this acted as a barrier.27,30,57 Sometimes, 
well-intended advice from friends and 
family was not considered helpful, and 
could even be seen as blaming. This led 
to resentment and relationship conflict.
Discussion
The primary purpose of this me-
ta-synthesis was to explore the per-
ceptions of individuals with chronic 
pain toward enablers and barriers of

Enablers to Self-Management
Theme 1: self- 
discovery
“I still get depressed but I realize why now, and I know that if I don’t 
get myself motivated then I’m going into the pain cycle.” [Barlow 
et al28(p131)]
“I realised how stiff I moved … holding your breath, moaning as 
you did something ... totally unknown to myself.” [Bunzli et al32(p17)]
“I don’t have the negative tapes going on in my head that I’m a 
bad person as much anymore. So I think that has helped my posi-
tive outlook on myself. So yeah. my self-esteem, my self-awareness I 
think is better.” [Brotto et al30(p8)]
High
26 studies from 11 countries with minor 
to significant methodological limitations. 
Minor concerns in relevance due to dif-
ferences in study settings and time frame 
of data collection. High coherence. Thick 
data from studies conducted mainly in 
high-income countries (Europe, North 
America, and Oceania).
Understanding the 
 
biopsychosocial 
nature of pain 
 
(subtheme)
“I’m understanding what it [pain] is and it’s not damage, and when 
you don’t understand what something is you worry about it more 
….” [Mathias et al45(p286)]
When there is something going on in someone’s life you know it 
can manifest in any area … there is more to it than just the struc-
ture.” [Bunzli et al32(p14–15)]
Moderate
14 studies from 9 countries with minor 
to significant methodological limitations. 
Minor concerns in coherence across stud-
ies. Fairly thick data from studies con-
ducted mainly in high-income countries 
(Europe, North America, and Oceania).
Process of change: 
change in relationship 
with pain (subtheme)
“When I went on the course, I realized I might not be able to 
change the pain or the external reality of living with the pain. I 
could change how I related to the pain and the way that I thought 
about it.” [Doran35(p5)]
“At the beginning of the intervention, I realized that my pain was 
like a budget. I understood that I will always have the same amount 
of money but I will now manage it differently. This is really different. 
When you manage your pain, it is less present, less intense.” [Bour-
gault et al29(p19)]
High
20 studies from 8 countries with minor 
to significant methodological limitations. 
Thick data from studies conducted 
mainly in high-income countries (Europe, 
North America, and Oceania). High 
coherence.
Sense of integration 
of mind and body 
(subtheme)
“You know, the medicine and the exercises help, but there’s also 
that thing called your head. You know, sometimes you think the 
mind works but the body don’t. Well, sometimes you can train your 
mind … to train the body.’’ [Matthias et al47(p575)]
“It was only later on, coming to the course, that I actually felt this 
sense of integration between my body and my mind, and I was able 
to work on myself in a more holistic way.” [Doran35(p7)]
Low
6 studies from 4 countries with moderate 
to significant methodological limitations. 
Moderate concerns in relevance as the in-
terventions were poorly described or the 
focus was on a single intervention. High 
coherence. Fairly thick data but limited 
number of studies conducted mainly in 
high-income countries (Europe, North 
America, and Oceania).
Self-compassion 
 
(subtheme)
“I’m patting myself on the back for coping with it [pain] because 
I’d rather beat myself up and blame myself for things ….” [Mathias 
et al45(p229)]
“Before I used to think it was wrong that I couldn’t do it and that I 
should be able to do this. I did used to beat myself up quite a bit … 
but now I just take each day as it comes and I don’t beat myself up 
if what I did yesterday I can’t do today.” [Harrison41(p74)]
Moderate
7 studies from 4 countries with minimal 
to significant methodological limita-
tions. High coherence and relevance. 
Fairly thick data but limited number of 
studies conducted mainly in high-income 
countries (Europe, North America, and 
Oceania).
Theme 2: feeling 
empowered
“I think that we likened it to that they were giving you tools—as 
you went along—you were given a tool box and all these things 
that went into it were tools that I could take away at the end of the 
course.” [Howarth et al43(p209)]
“And I didn’t think, you know there was going to be much happi-
ness because I was dealing with this pain, and now it’s—I can see 
that there are tools that I can use to cope with it, that I can move 
on.” [Brotto et al30(p12)]
High
25 studies from 10 countries with minor 
to significant methodological limitations. 
Minor concerns in relevance due to dif-
ferences in study settings and time frame 
of data collection. High coherence. Thick 
data from studies conducted mainly in 
high-income countries (Europe, North 
America, and Oceania).
Accepting pain as part 
of “self” (subtheme)
“This is part of me but this isn’t as I’ve said, it’s not who defines me. 
It really isn’t. I’ve got this pain and I live alongside it. It’s not a sepa-
rate entity it’s within you and you have to accept it. Not as my best 
friend but it’s there and my body, you know I used to think ‘god my 
body’s awful’ because it’s not doing this and it’s not doing that but 
actually my body is trying its best and it heals itself.” [Harrison41(p73)]
“I realize now that pain’s something I’m gonna have to live with, 
probably the rest of my life, and it’s not gonna stop me from being 
an active member of my family and community. There’s things I 
can do. Before I was just sitting around discouraged, depressed.’’

incorporating self-management strate-
gies into daily life after completing a 
self-management intervention. The key 
enablers to self-management included 
self-discovery and feeling empowered 
by practicing learned strategies. While 
the barriers included the sustained 
motivation required to self-manage in 
the presence of distress from ongoing 
pain, stress, and depression. Having 
a collaborative partnership with clini-
cians and support from family, friends, 
and work environment acted as an en-
abler as well as a barrier to ongoing 
self-management.
Self-discovery or distinguishing self (ie, 
body, thoughts, and feelings) from pain 
was perceived as a critical cognitive 
process, which enabled  
participants to 
alter their relationship with pain, facil-
itate embodied awareness, and devel-
op self-compassion. A recent system-
atic review specifically investigating 
the changes in “self,” reported that the 
ability to decentralize and view “self” 
as distinct from pain was associated 
with improved emotional outcomes, 
 
including reduced depression in people 
with chronic pain.59 The ability to view

“self” in the context of pain is akin to 
the “contextual self” model of psycho-
logical flexibility.60 On the basis of this 
conceptual model, self-as-context is the 
perspective with which the individual 
can differentiate one’s “self” from psy-
chological experiences (eg, thoughts, 
emotions, and feelings).60 Preliminary 
work to measure self-as-context via the 
Self Experiences Questionnaire showed 
evidence for content and construct va-
lidity,61 suggesting the possibility to 
assess changes in “self” in people with 
chronic pain.
Feeling empowered by means of prac-
ticing core self-management skills (eg, 
guided problem solving, goal setting, 
and self-tailoring) in the described in-
terventions engendered confidence to 
manage pain as well as the ability to 
control one’s behavior (ie, self- 
efficacy). 
Self-efficacy beliefs act as a resilient 
belief system62 and are shown to be 
an important mediator to minimize 
pain-related physical and psychosocial 
disability63 as well as influence long-
term behavioral change in people with 
chronic pain.64 Furthermore, being with 
similar others in a supportive group 
environment during the intervention 
 
facilitated mutual sharing and learn-
ing from each other’s individual expe-
riences and enabled problem solving 
and self-efficacy to practice strategies 
learned from the intervention.
Accepting pain as part of “self” and 
continuing to practice self-management 
strategies despite pain is an ongoing 
process and critical for developing the 
ability to distinguish “self” from pain 
and develop self-efficacy. Cognitive be-
havioral interventions, such as Accept-
ance and Commitment Therapy have 
shown improved functional outcomes 
in people with chronic pain.65 Howev-
er, our results from this meta- 
synthesis 
suggest that acceptance is not a straight-
forward process in people with chron-
ic pain, and is akin to the experiences 
of people with other long-term health 
conditions.66,67 In other words, accept-
ing to live well with chronic pain, is an 
ongoing process and participants fluc-
tuated along a spectrum on a momen-
tary basis.68 Moreover, the degree of ac-
ceptance was interdependent on other 
cognitive processes such as the ability 
to view “self” in context, self-efficacy, 
and influences of daily stressors.69
Our results suggest a possible rela-
tionship between self-discovery, self- 
efficacy, and acceptance as drivers of 
optimal self-management. As illustrat-
ed in Figure 2, there is potential for 
a bidirectional relationship between 
one’s ability to view “self” in context 
(self-discovery) and the confidence to 
implement strategies learned from the 
intervention (self-efficacy) into daily 
life. Concurrently, these strategies may 
positively influence the degree of ac-
cepting the new “self” with pain and 
along with support from family, friends, 
and clinicians could positively influence 
the ability to self-manage and facilitate 
meaningful participation in life despite 
pain. Previous studies on people with 
chronic pain suggested that self-effi-
cacy was an important predictor for 
physical disability influencing function-
al outcomes, while acceptance was an

important predictor for emotional out-
comes such as depression.70 Further, 
people with primary musculoskeletal 
pain who had better pain acceptance 
also reported higher self-efficacy and 
continued to engage in valuable activi-
ties.71,72 The conceptual similarities and 
interrelationships of these psychologi-
cal constructs have been debated68 and 
due to the dynamic nature of these con-
structs, the ability to measure change 
presents a challenge; nevertheless, the 
results from our meta-synthesis high-
light the complex but overlapping in-
fluence of these processes in positively 
influencing self-management abilities.
Distress experienced from ongoing 
pain, depression, and stress associated 
with chronic pain was perceived as a 
major barrier to ongoing self-manage-
ment. There is high prevalence of de-
pression in people with chronic pain,73 
and people with chronic pain experi-
encing depression are less likely to en-
gage in active self-management strate-
gies, such as exercises.74 Furthermore, 1 
of the included studies from our review 
suggested that managing depression via 
antidepressants as part of self-manage-
ment intervention facilitated improved 
engagement in the self-management 
intervention by enabling participants’ 
to focus on practicing the strategies 
learned from the intervention.27 While 
the current review focused mainly on 
exploring active nonpharmacological 
approaches for self-managing chron-
ic pain, it is argued that medications 
could be an useful adjunct, when used 
judiciously, to support ongoing pain 
self-management.7
Supportive ambience in the form of a 
therapeutic alliance with clinicians act-
ed as an enabler as well as a barrier to 
ongoing self-management. Previous re-
views have consistently reported the ne-
cessity of a strong therapeutic alliance 
for gaining patient confidence and en-
abling self-management.14,75 Adopting 
self-management principles in clinical 
decision making appears to be a bidi-
rectional process between patients and 
clinicians. A previous meta-synthesis 
exploring clinicians’ views on adopting 
self-management principles in clinical 
practice suggests that acknowledging 
patients as knowledgeable and experts 
of their own health condition enabled 
shared decision making.75 However, in-
tegration of self-management principles 
in clinical practice was perceived as an 
ongoing process facilitated by regular 
training and support.75
Social support from families, friends, 
work colleagues, and significant oth-
ers of people with chronic pain can be 
an enabler as well as a barrier. A pre-
vious quantitative study reported that 
perceived social support enhanced 
psychological well-being, reduced pain 
intensity and elevated mood in people 
with chronic pain.76 Our results suggest 
that perceived social support may act as 
a protective buffer to mitigate the emo-
tional consequences of chronic pain, 
such as feelings of distress and loneli-
ness.77 Despite the insulating effects of 
social support, the invisible nature of 
chronic pain can make suffering incom-
prehensible to significant others and 
can lead to distrust, which was a barrier 
to ongoing self-management of chronic 
pain.78
Strengths and Limitations
We adapted a holistic definition for 
chronic pain including those with ma-
lignant pain and orofacial pain in an at-
tempt to explore a wide range of expe-
riences of people with chronic pain. We 
implemented a number of strategies to 
enhance the credibility and methodo-
logical rigor of our meta-synthesis. First, 
dependability was achieved by involv-
ing all the authors with clinical and re-
search experience in physical therapy. 
The authors synthesized the analytical 
themes from included articles and an 
iterative, inductive approach was used 
throughout the analysis process and the 
final analytical themes were derived by 
consensus. To ensure reflexivity, H.D. 
maintained an audit trail of major de-
cisions made during various stages of 
the data synthesis. Furthermore, the 
CERQual approach provided an explicit 
assessment and explanation to gauge 
the level of confidence from analytical 
themes in order to translate the qual-
itative evidence in a broader context 
for policy development and evidence- 
informed practice.24
Our review findings must be inter-
preted with caution owing to the 
 
following limitations. Qualitative meta- 
synthesis is often criticized, as it might 
undermine the richness of data from 
 
individual studies. Nevertheless, by 
following an inductive approach, the 
review findings have provided a new 
framework that goes beyond the results 
of individual studies (Fig. 2). We only 
included interventions that included at 
least 4 self-management skills; thus, we 
may have missed informative studies. 
 
Developing self-management skills is, 
however, a complex process requiring 
many different strategies, therefore, 
we believe that a minimum of 4 self- 
management skills in an intervention is 
appropriate. The follow-up period var-
ied from immediately after the interven-
tion to 72 months following the interven-
tion. Therefore, we were unsure which 
of the key enablers and barriers were 
most influential long term. Further, this 
review was unable to determine which 
of the components of self-management 
interventions (eg, cognitive-behavio-
ral therapy, relaxation, exercises) were 
most influential. Only articles published 
in the English language were included 
due to limited availability of translation 
services. Moreover, we were unable to 
locate studies conducted in low- and 
middle-income countries. Owing to 
differences in health care delivery and 
cultural health beliefs, future research 
is required to explore how such factors 
influence pain self-management from 
those countries.
Clinical Implications
As 
person-centered 
communication 
forms an integral aspect of person- 
centered care and shared decision mak-
ing, our review findings indicate the 
need for better communication across 
all stakeholders (ie, patients, clinicians, 
family, and friends) to positively sup-
port self-efficacy of self-management 
strategies.79 For patients, self-man-
agement interventions could focus on 
strategies to enhance communication 
skills enabling them to engage in pro-
ductive discussions with clinicians 
communicating their pain experiences, 
treatment preferences, and discussing 
management plans.80

For 
clinicians, 
upskilling 
person- 
centered practice and communication 
skills should be encouraged. Clinicians 
need to acknowledge the patient’s 
chronic efforts to manage symptoms, 
some of which might be erratic, and 
recognize the extraordinary struggle 
required for ongoing control. This ac-
knowledgement and empathy will 
help to foster trust and deepen the 
therapeutic  
alliance.47 Shared decision 
making to  
elicit patient preferences, 
beliefs, and attitudes81,82 as well as 
discussing the risks and benefits of 
proposed treatment plans83 using de-
cision aids83 would be worthwhile giv-
en the promising evidence to support 
person- 
centered communication, pa-
tient  
satisfaction, and improved health 
outcomes.84 Approaches such as the 
Four Habits approach to shared de-
cision making with emphasis on the 
entire clinical encounter,85 and motiva-
tional interviewing techniques by using 
strategies such as using open-ended 
questions, and providing motivation-
al statements, listening with empathy, 
and providing constructive feedback86 
are suggested to foster shared deci-
sion making and ultimately improve 
patient experience and care.86 Further, 
health service delivery approaches fo-
cusing on an interprofessional model 
of self-management support87 is impor-
tant for building a shared understand-
ing, consistency in communication, and 
integrating self-management support 
principles in clinical practice.
Conclusion
For self-management interventions to 
positively influence the lives of peo-
ple with chronic pain, fostering self- 
discovery was crucial to facilitating 
acceptance and improved self- 
efficacy. 
However, the sustained efforts to 
self-manage pain after the intervention 
can be exhausting and were perceived 
as a constant struggle. Providing inter-
mittent support in the form of boost-
er sessions and peer support groups 
may be important. Clinicians involved 
in the management of chronic pain 
need to be cognizant of the importance 
of  
person-centeredness by means of 
shared decision making and guided 
problem solving to facilitate ongoing 
self-management.
