Abstract
Objective
To identify the pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical significance of anosognosia for
cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment.
Methods
We stratified 468 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment into intact and impaired
awareness groups, determined by the discrepancy between the patient and the informant score
on the Everyday Cognition questionnaire. Voxel-based linear regression models evaluated the
associations between self-awareness status and baseline β-amyloid load, measured by [18F]
florbetapir, and the relationships between awareness status and regional brain glucose me-
tabolism measured by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose at baseline and at 24-month follow-up. Mul-
tivariate logistic regression tested the association of awareness status with conversion from
amnestic mild cognitive impairment to dementia.
Results
We found that participants with impaired awareness had lower [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake
and increased [18F]florbetapir uptake in the posterior cingulate cortex at baseline. In addition,
impaired awareness in mild cognitive impairment predicted [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose hypo-
metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex, left basal forebrain, bilateral medial temporal
lobes, and right lateral temporal lobe over 24 months. Furthermore, participants with impaired
awareness had a nearly 3-fold increase in likelihood of conversion to dementia within a 2-year
time frame.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that anosognosia is linked to Alzheimer disease pathophysiology in vul-
nerable structures, and predicts subsequent hypometabolism in the default mode network,
accompanied by an increased risk of progression to dementia. This highlights the importance of
assessing awareness of cognitive decline in the clinical evaluation and management of indi-
viduals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.

 Anosognosia, a syndrome characterized by a lack of awareness
of one’s illness, is commonly observed in Alzheimer disease
(AD).1 Patients with AD with anosognosia are unaware of
their cognitive deficits and the difficulties they face when
performing activities of daily living. Anosognosia is also cor-
related with dementia severity in AD.2 Hence, anosognosia
constitutes an important clinical characteristic of patients
with AD.
The relationship between anosognosia and AD pathophysi-
ology in the predementia phase of AD is poorly understood.
Because anosognosia occurs frequently in AD, further studies
focusing on the associations of anosognosia in mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and AD pathophysiology are of para-
mount importance, given that anosognosia in MCI may rep-
resent an important clinical syndrome that signals disease
progression.3
The present study aims to characterize the associations of
anosognosia and AD biomarkers based on the recently de-
scribed amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration construct4 in MCI,
using [18F]florbetapir, CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and
[18F]FDG, respectively. In addition, we examine the predictive
effect of anosognosia on disease progression and changes in
brain glucose metabolism at a 24-month follow-up. Because
anosognosia occurs frequently in the symptomatic phase of AD,
we also hypothesized that anosognosia is related to an increase
in neuropathologic features of AD at baseline, and corre-
spondingly to higher rates of diagnostic conversion at 24-month
follow-up. The finding of a significant relationship between
anosognosia, AD biomarkers, and disease progression would
support a framework where assessments of illness awareness
constitute an important role in the clinical management of MCI.
Methods
Participants
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from
the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in
2003 as a public–private partnership led by principal in-
vestigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of
ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other
biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological as-
sessment can be combined to measure the progression of
MCI and early AD.
In this study, we selected participants meeting criteria for
amnestic MCI who have both their baseline everyday cogni-
tion (ECog)5 as well as their study partner’s ECog scores.
Participants with MCI were defined as having (1) a subjective
memory concern as reported by the participant, study partner,
or clinician; (2) abnormal memory function documented by
scoring within education-adjusted ranges; (3) Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) score between 24 and 30; (4)
Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5 with a memory box
score of at least 0.5; and (5) general cognition and functional
performance sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of
AD cannot be made by the site physician at the time of the
screening visit. The ADNI inclusion and exclusion criteria can
be accessed at adni-info.org (accessed January 2017).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
The ADNI study was approved by the institutional review
boards of each participating institution. Informed written
consent was obtained from all participants enrolled in this
study.
Determining intact and impaired self-
awareness
We defined intact and impaired self-awareness of cognitive
deficits based on the difference between patient and in-
formant global ratings on the ECog questionnaire. Partic-
ipants with anosognosia are described as those with impaired
self-awareness. The ECog questionnaire measures global as
well as domain-specific cognitive functions, such as episodic
memory and planning, by asking participants to compare their
cognitive abilities currently and 10 years earlier. A study
partner, such as a spouse or caregiver, who spent a minimum
of 10 hours per week with the participant, also completed the
ECog questionnaire according to the participant’s cognitive
abilities. ECog is a useful measure for levels of awareness
along the AD spectrum because understanding awareness of
deficits in functioning requires the individual to consider
performance on everyday activities, where deficits can be
observed in MCI. The information provided by caregivers has
repeatedly been shown to be highly accurate.6-8
The cutoff for the threshold of impaired self-awareness was
calculated using the best operational point on a receiver op-
erating characteristic curve contrasting healthy controls (n =
290) and patients with AD (n = 150) from the ADNI cohort. A
cutoff of 0.5, determined by the threshold that optimized both

participants with MCI into intact and impaired self-awareness
groups. See figure 1 for a graphical representation of the de-
termination of intact and impaired awareness groups.
Cognitive assessments
Global cognitive abilities were evaluated using the MMSE and
the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale
(ADAS-Cog). Language abilities were evaluated used the
Animals section of the Category Fluency task. The Trail-
Making Test part A (TMT-A) was employed to assess psy-
chomotor speed processing, while part B (TMT-B) was used
to assess mental flexibility. Finally, the Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Task (RAVLT-IM) was used to assess immediate
recall memory and the 30-minute delayed recall (RAVLT-D)
was used to assess delayed recall.
CSF analyses
CSF β-amyloid (Aβ) and p-tau concentrations were measured
with the Luminex (Austin, TX) multiplex platform and
Innogenetics (Ghent, Belgium) INNO-BIAALZBio3 immu-
noassay reagents. CSF biomarker data were obtained from the
UPENNBIOMK5-8.csv files from ADNI. In the present
study, we employed the most recent measure of CSF Aβ1-42,
tau, and p-tau. Complete details of the methods for acquisi-
tion and measurement of CSF in ADNI can be found at adni.
info.org (accessed February 2017).
Neuroimaging methods
A schematic representation of the neuroimaging methods
employed is presented in figure e-1 (links.lww.com/WNL/
A235). T1-weighted MRI were acquired following the ADNI
acquisition protocols. For complete details of the ADNI
neuroimaging data acquisition protocol, see adni.loni.usc.
edu/methods/(accessed October 2017). Standardized uptake
value ratio (SUVR) maps were obtained for [18F]florbetapir
using cerebellar gray matter as the reference region and nor-
malizing for cortical white matter, and [18F]FDG using the
pons as the reference region. A global [18F]florbetapir and
[18F]FDG SUVR value for each participant was estimated as
the mean SUVR of a brain mask comprising the precuneus,
prefrontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior, and
posterior cingulate cortices. PET images were processed using
an established pipeline.9
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using the R Statistical Soft-
ware Package version 3.1.2 (r-project.org/; accessed February
2017). Analyses of neuroimaging data were conducted using the
RMINC library, a biomedical imaging package that permits
Medical Image NetCDF (MINC) files to be analyzed in the R
environment.
Baseline demographics were assessed using multiple t tests
and χ2 tests. To characterize intact and impaired awareness
groups on AD biomarkers and neurocognitive functioning, we
performed an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). To account
for disease severity, we repeated each ANCOVA model of
CSF pathology employing ADAS-Cog scores as an additional
covariate.
A voxel-based regression model was used to compare patterns
of brain metabolism measured by [18F]FDG PET between
groups. Furthermore, we employed a voxel-based regression
model to compare patterns of regional amyloid deposition as
determined by [18F]florbetapir PET. Of the 124 participants

 with amnestic MCI with caregiver and informant E-Cog data
with [18F]FDG PET assessments at both baseline and
24-month follow-up, we employed simple linear regression
models to evaluate the effect of awareness group on % change
in regional brain metabolism as assessed by [18F]FDG PET.
Age, sex, years of education, and APOE e4 status were employed
as covariates in all voxel-based regression analyses. Because
participants with MCI in the anosognosia group had higher
ADAS-Cog scores, we repeated each voxel-based regression
model employing ADAS-Cog scores as an additional covariate.
All voxel-based regression analyses were corrected for multiple
comparisons using random field theory10 at p < 0.001.
To determine if patterns of brain metabolism were abnormal,
we subsequently computed z scores for the mean SUVR from
the structures with lower [18F]FDG uptake in individuals with
MCI with impaired awareness at baseline and at follow-up. A
structure was defined as hypometabolic if the mean [18F]FDG
SUVR in the anosognosia group was significantly lower (95%
confidence interval [CI]) than that of the healthy individuals.
Defining abnormality based on 95% CIs from the healthy
population is a commonly employed approach.11,12
To evaluate whether anosognosia is an important risk factor
for progression from amnestic MCI to AD, we performed
a logistic regression analysis including other known factors
related to diagnostic conversion including age, sex, years of
education, and APOE e4 status as covariates. We also repeated
the logistic regression analysis employing ADAS-Cog scores
as an additional covariate to correct for cognitive impairment.
Odds ratios (ORs) with respective 95% CIs were calculated.
Results
Of 468 participants with amnestic MCI, 175 had impaired
self-awareness and 293 had intact self-awareness. Baseline
demographics are summarized in the table.
The impaired awareness group demonstrated lower scores on
the ADAS-Cog. Furthermore, participants with MCI in the
impaired awareness group also demonstrated a larger de-
ficiency on both the RAVLT-IM and RAVLT-D. No statisti-
cally significant differences were observed for MMSE,
Category Fluency, TMT-A, or TMT-B (figure e-2, links.lww.
com/WNL/A235).
ANCOVAs revealed that compared with individuals with
MCI with intact self-awareness, individuals with MCI with
impaired self-awareness had higher levels of CSF p-tau, CSF
total tau, and global [18F]florbetapir uptake. They also dem-
onstrated lower CSF Aβ (figure 2). Furthermore, significant
correlations between patient–caregiver discrepancy on the
ECog questionnaire and CSF Aβ (r = 0.14, p = 0.0045), global
[18F]florbetapir uptake (r = −0.15, p = 0.0017), CSF p-tau (r =
−0.19, p < 0.0001), and CSF total tau (r = −0.20, p < 0.0001)

 were observed. Because 0.5 was the threshold for determining
intact vs impaired awareness (with impaired awareness par-
ticipants having scores below 0.5), a negative correlation be-
tween AD biomarkers and patient–caregiver discrepancy is
expected.
A voxel-based regression model demonstrated that individuals
with amnestic MCI in the impaired self-awareness group had
higher [18F]florbetapir uptake in the posterior cingulate cor-
tex (PCC) and right lateral temporal and parietal cortices than
individuals with intact self-awareness (figure 3A). Results of
a voxel-based regression model revealed that individuals with
MCI with impaired awareness had decreased metabolism in
the PCC and precuneus (figure 3B). Voxel-based regression
model demonstrated that impaired self-awareness in MCI
predicts lower [18F]FDG uptake at 24-month follow-up in the
PCC, bilateral medial temporal lobes, right lateral temporal
lobe, and basal forebrain (figure 4).
A total of 28.15% of patients with amnestic MCI in the
anosognosia group converted to AD dementia, while only
12% in the intact awareness group converted. A multivariate
logistic regression analysis demonstrated that impaired
awareness of illness predicts diagnostic conversion over 2
years (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.6–5.25). Notably, the only other
factor more closely associated with diagnostic conversion at
24-month follow-up was APOE e4 status (OR 3.42, 95% CI
1.88–6.39). Anosognosia remained a significant predictor of
progression to dementia (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.44–5.7) when
ADAS-Cog scores were employed as a covariate. When each
CSF measure of pathology was included in the logistic re-
gression, anosognosia no longer significantly predicted clini-
cal progression (p = 0.09). For the participants with amnestic
MCI included in the present analysis, the overall progression
rate to probable AD in 2 years was 18.5%. In the intact
awareness group, progression to dementia was associated with
a significant decline in awareness of illness from baseline
(mean 22.27, SD 16.54) to 24-month follow-up (mean −4, SD
33.27, p = 0.0006).

 MCI. The results demonstrate that impaired awareness of
illness in MCI is accompanied by an increase in AD patho-
physiology as well as decreased metabolism in neural struc-
tures vulnerable in AD, independently of sex, education, age,
and APOE e4 status. The presence of anosognosia at baseline
predicted hypometabolism and clinical progression at 24-
month follow-up independently of disease severity. Together,
these findings highlight the importance of anosognosia as
a clinical feature in amnestic MCI.
While MCIs in both groups did not differ on MMSE score,
participants with MCI with impaired awareness of illness
demonstrated lower global cognitive ability from the ADAS-
Cog. This divergence may be attributable to the ADAS-Cog
being a more sensitive measure of cognitive dysfunction.13
Furthermore, the impaired awareness group performed worse
on verbal memory and delayed recall, consistent with a recent
meta-analysis of the neuropsychological correlates of impaired
awareness in MCI.14 Furthermore, because metacognitive
monitoring abilities are also diminished in dementia,15 impaired
awareness in MCI may be suggestive of incipient AD.
Our findings of participants with MCI with impaired self-
awareness having lower CSF Aβ, higher global Aβ deposition,
higher CSF p-tau, and higher CSF total tau supports a link
between anosognosia and AD pathophysiology according to
the A/T/N biomarker classification system.4 Specifically, in
participants with MCI with impaired self-awareness, we found
increased amyloid deposition in the PCC compared to indi-
viduals with intact self-awareness, a feature observed early in
the AD process.16 Higher global amyloid burden has also been
linked to decreased awareness of cognitive decline in MCI.17
Furthermore, results from a longitudinal study reported that
individuals with impaired awareness of memory decline
demonstrated increased tau pathology postmortem.18 While
these results suggest that anosognosia in MCI is a clinical
manifestation of AD pathophysiology, future work is needed
to elucidate the role of cognitive impairment in anosognosia.
Because relationships between lack of awareness of cognitive
impairment and CSF amyloid and CSF p-tau were no longer
significant when accounting for cognitive impairment, the
regional distribution of neuropathology likely plays a role in
the decline of illness awareness.
The association of anosognosia with decreased metabolism
and increased amyloid load in the PCC, a key node of the
default mode network (DMN), in MCI suggests a link be-
tween the PCC and the impairment of self-awareness. The
DMN is a large-scale network of brain structures comprising
the PCC/precuneus, medial temporal lobes, medial prefrontal
cortex, as well as the lateral parietal cortex and is shown to be
vulnerable in AD19 and MCI.20 Importantly, decreased me-
tabolism in the PCC is regarded as a key feature of the early
clinical stages of AD.21,22 While the pathologic features of AD
typically first appear in the medial temporal lobes,23 previous
work has suggested that the PCC is an area vulnerable to
metabolic decline in early AD.16,24
Although the precise mechanism of decreased metabolism in
the PCC leading to anosognosia in MCI is not known, mul-
tiple functional MRI studies have suggested that the PCC
plays a key role in mental processing related to oneself25–27
and is involved in the retrieval of autobiographical memo-
ries.28 Furthermore, previous research has shown that less
neuronal activity in the PCC is observed when patients with
MCI with impaired awareness of illness engaged in a self-
referential mental task compared to patients with MCI with
intact awareness.29 It is possible that patients’ decreased
mental activity relating to themselves may result in patients
failing to integrate information about their recent functional
difficulties and cognitive decline into their knowledge about
themselves.
Anosognosia in amnestic MCI predicted hypometabolism in
the PCC, bilateral medial temporal lobes, right lateral temporal
lobe, and basal forebrain at 2-year follow-up. AD and MCI are
characterized by significant loss of cholinergic neurons in the
basal forebrain.30,31 Our results are also in line with previous
results demonstrating that patients with AD with anosognosia
had decreased glucose metabolism in the PCC32 and medial
temporal lobes.33 Crucially, the PCC and medial and lateral
temporal lobes are DMN structures particularly vulnerable in
AD, suggesting that the presence of anosognosia in MCI may be
an important marker of incipient AD dementia. Correspond-
ingly, individuals with amnestic MCI with impaired awareness
of cognitive decline were 2.86 times more likely to progress to
AD within a 2-year time frame than those with intact awareness.
Our results are in agreement with previous research demon-
strating that lack of awareness of cognitive decline typically
appears 2–3 years before the onset of dementia.18
Awareness of cognitive decline is not incorporated into
screening procedures such as the Alzheimer’s Association
recommendations for operationalizing the detection of
cognitive impairment.34 If replicated, these findings dem-
onstrating an increase in AD pathophysiology indicate
that awareness assessments are a reasonable method to
clinically screen individuals for interventions targeting AD
pathophysiology in MCI. Indeed, anosognosia could
provide clinicians with insights regarding clinical pro-
gression to dementia, though future work is needed to
determine the methodology to most accurately assess
awareness of illness.
While multiple procedures exist for assessing the extent of
lack of awareness of cognitive decline,1 there is currently no
ubiquitously accepted gold standard. Currently, approaches
to quantifying lack of awareness of cognitive deficits fall into 3
main categories: (1) assessing the difference between sub-
jective ability and objective score on a neuropsychological
task, (2) assessment by a clinician, and (3) the discrepancy
between patient and caregiver ratings of cognitive impair-
ment. Because structured interviews with informants are al-
ready well-established in current clinical care (such as the
Clinical Dementia Rating35 and the Informant Questionnaire

e937
 on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly [IQCODE]36), clinicians
may be able to gain important prognostic information by
assessing a patient’s awareness of illness with an informant.
Some methodologic considerations make replication of these
findings highly desirable. The first is our operational measure
of anosognosia; ECog is a measure of activities of daily living
and not a measure of self-awareness in the strict sense. An-
other limitation of ECog is that it requires patients to recall
their memories of past cognitive functioning, a faculty im-
paired in the anosognosia group. Despite the novelty of using
the discrepancy of the ECog scores, the methodology of
subtracting patient from caregiver scores has wide empirical
support and is commonly employed in investigations of
anosognosia across the AD spectrum.2,32,33 Furthermore,
awareness of illness is not a binary phenomenon and future
work is needed to establish the most appropriate method of
determining the degree of awareness of illness across the AD
spectrum. Another limitation of this research is that ADNI
participants are self-selected, and thus may have been in-
terested in participating due to having noticed a decline their
cognitive
abilities.
Therefore,
replication
in
another
population-based cohort will strengthen confidence in these
findings. However, a unique advantage of the ADNI cohort is
that participants do not need to express a concern about their
cognitive decline in order to be enrolled in the cohort, thus
permitting the study of anosognosia for cognitive decline
in MCI.
The results of the present study demonstrated that anosog-
nosia in amnestic MCI is related to an increase in neuro-
pathologic features of AD and increased risk of clinical
progression to dementia. Overall, our findings highlight the
importance of including assessments of self-awareness in
medical diagnostic settings in order to provide additional
insights into disease severity and clinical management across
the AD spectrum.

Study question
What are the pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical significance
of anosognosia for cognitive decline in mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI)?
Summary answer
Anosognosia is linked to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology
in vulnerable structures and predicts hypometabolism in the de-
fault mode network alongside an increased risk of progression to
dementia.
What is known and what this paper adds
Anosognosia is commonly observed in AD, but its meaning in MCI is
poorly understood. This study provides evidence that anosognosia is
associated with AD pathophysiology in patients with MCI and predicts
disease progression.
Participants and setting
This study retrospectively examined 468 patients with amnestic MCI who
participated in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI),
which was launched in 2003.
Design, size, and duration
The participants were classified into intact and impaired awareness
groups based on discrepancies between patient and informant scores on
the Everyday Cognition questionnaire. Voxel-based linear regression
was used to evaluate how awareness status was related to amyloid-β load,
which was measured with 18F-florbetapir at baseline, and regional brain
glucose metabolism, which was measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
at baseline and after 24 months. Multivariate logistic regression was used
to evaluate how awareness status was related to dementia progression,
which was assessed with a battery of cognitive tests administered at
baseline and after 24 months.
Main results and the role of chance
Of the 468 participants, 175 (37%) had impaired awareness, and 293
(63%) had intact awareness. Impaired status was associated with
greater baseline amyloid-β loads in the posterior cingulate cortex and
glucose hypometabolism in areas representing the default mode net-
work over 24 months. The frequency of progression to AD dementia
was greater for the impaired awareness group (28% vs 12%; odds ratio,
2.86; 95% CI, 1.6–5.25).
Bias, confounding, and other reasons for caution
The Everyday Cognition questionnaire is an indirect measure of ano-
sognosia. Furthermore, anosognosia occurs across a spectrum, not as
a binary phenomenon.
Generalizability to other populations
The ADNI’s subjects were self-selected, and so might have been in-
terested in participating after noticing a decline in their cognitive abil-
ities. This may limit generalizability to the general population of
individuals with MCI.
Study funding/potential competing interests
This study was funded by Canadian government agencies and various
medical research foundations. The ADNI was funded by the NIH and the
US Department of Defense. Dr. Gauthier reports receiving honoraria for
serving on advisory boards for various pharmaceutical companies and
clinical trials related to AD. Go to Neurology.org/N for full disclosures.
