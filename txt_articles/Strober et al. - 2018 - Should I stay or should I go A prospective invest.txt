Abstract.
BACKGROUND: Rates of unemployment among individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) are as high as 80%. While several
factors for such high rates of unemployment have been identified, they do not account for the majority of the variance.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines person-specific factors such as personality and coping, which may better account for
individuals leaving the workforce.
METHOD: Forty individuals with MS (20 considering reducing work hours or leaving the workforce and 20 remaining
employed) were matched on age, gender, education, disease duration, and disease course, and administered a comprehensive
survey of factors purported to be related to employment status.
RESULTS: Based on multiple, logistic regression analyses certain disease factors and person-specific factors differentiate
those who are considering leaving work or reducing work hours and those staying employed. In particular, those expressing
the need to reduce work hours or leaving the workforce reported more fatigue, anxiety, depression, and use of behavioral
disengagement as a means of coping. In contrast, those staying employed reported greater levels of extraversion, self-efficacy,
and use of humor as a means of coping. Together, fatigue, use of humor, and use of behavioral disengagement as a means of
coping were the most significant factors, accounting for 44% of the variance.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that greater consideration be given to these factors and that interventions tailored to
address these factors may assist individuals with MS staying employed and/or making appropriate accommodations.

one cause of neurological disability among young
women and the second leading cause among young
men [1], affecting approximately 400,000 individu-
als in the United States [2]. Multiple sclerosis affects
women anywhere from two to three times as often as
men [3], with an age of diagnosis ranging from 20 to
50 years of age and a mean age of onset of 33 years of
age [4]. Given the age of onset, individuals with MS

L.B. Strober et al. / Factors impacting employment status in MS
are typically in the prime of their careers and mak-
ing important decisions regarding career and family.
However, it is well appreciated that MS has a sig-
nificant impact on individuals’ social, familial, and
occupational roles. In fact, the rate of unemployment
in MS ranges from 60% to 80%, with reports that
approximately only 30% to 45% of individuals with
MS are employed at any given time [5–9]. These rates
are in stark contrast to reports that approximately
90% to 96% of individuals with MS are gainfully
employed prior to their diagnosis [9, 10].
Numerous investigations that have examined the
factors associated with unemployment in MS have
found female gender, age, less education, and greater
disability to be significant predictors [11]. Individu-
als with a progressive course are also more likely to
be unemployed than those with a relapsing-remitting
course [9]. Other factors shown to influence rates
of unemployment include primary symptoms asso-
ciated with MS such as poor balance and difficulty
walking [12], bladder/bowel incontinence, and heat
sensitivity [8]. Symptoms such as fatigue [5, 13],
and cognitive difficulties [8, 14–16] are also reported
as significant contributors; with fatigue likely being
the greatest culprit. Cognitive impairment, particu-
larly deficits in information processing speed and
memory are also associated with leaving the work-
force or sustaining changes in work status [14,
17, 18]. A comprehensive review of the literature
from 2002–2011 confirm these findings, suggesting
that fatigue, mobility impairments, cognitive impair-
ment, lower education level, older age, and less
prestige in past work are most accountable for the
high rate of unemployment in MS [19].
While these symptoms of MS are certainly detri-
mental to one’s functioning and have a direct impact
on the individual, many have contended that they are
insufficient in accounting for the strikingly high rates
of unemployment in MS. In fact, in one of the earli-
est investigations, LaRocca and colleagues found that
disease variables and demographics only accounted
for 14% of the variance in predicting employment
status [11]. They suggested that premorbid person-
ality, coping style, characteristics of the workplace,
and social support systems were likely to make a
more significant contribution to the probability of an
individual with MS staying employed. Nearly two
decades later, Ratsep and colleagues asserted that
psychosocial disability remains unexplained solely
by disease severity or sociodemographic variables
and recommended that more attention be given to the
role that personality and coping has on the adjustment
to MS [20]. In general, it is well established that
personality, self-efficacy, and coping are intricately
intertwined and, together, are likely to contribute to
how one perceives and effectively manages a chronic
illness, such as MS [21, 22]. Consideration of such
factors is consistent with a biopsychosocial (BPS)
approach, which emphasizes the role of the psycho-
logical and social factors as well as the biological
in predicting health and outcomes. It has been argued
thatpractitionersneedtoconsiderthesefactorssimul-
taneously in order to fully appreciate the patient’s
subjective experience of their illness. Thus, while
much is known about the contribution of demograph-
ics and disease variables, much less is known about
the role personality has on MS, in general, but even
less on how personality and related factors (e.g., self-
efficacy, coping) may contribute to the high rates of
unemployment in MS.
In general, personality has frequently been sought
after as a determining factor of health and well-
being. In particular, It has long been shown that
neurotic-type personality characteristics or neuroti-
cism is a predictor of somatization in the medically-ill
and greater reports of pain [23] and cause of ear-
lier mortality in the general population as well as the
medically-ill [24]. Conscientiousness, on the other
hand, has been found to be linked with healthier
lifestyles and adherence to disease treatment and self-
management [25]. In working with cardiac patients,
Denollet observed certain personality characteristics
that seemed predictive of worse health status and out-
comes. He coined this the so called “Distressed” or
“Type D” Personality [26]. Individuals with Type D
Personality are characterized as having a synergis-
tic combination of higher levels of neuroticism and
lower levels of extraversion or greater social discom-
fort [27]. It has been shown that individuals with a
“Type D” personality have a worse prognosis, includ-
ing a greater likelihood of myocardial infarction and
mortality [27, 28]. These individuals also engage in
unhealthybehaviors,havelowerperceivedsocialsup-
port, and reduced quality of life [29]. This personality
profile is also related to higher levels of depression
and anxiety [30]. In MS, high levels of neuroticism
and low levels of extraversion has also been found to
be more predictive of reports of fatigue than physi-
cal impairment among individuals with MS [31]. Our
recent work has also shown that personality, namely
persistence or conscientiousness was a significant
predictor of employment status, above and beyond
disease severity and cognitive impairment [17]. How-
ever, this study and the remainder of investigations
 L.B. Strober et al. / Factors impacting employment status in MS

examining factors related to employment to date have
been retrospective in nature. There are no studies in
the existing literature that have examined the fac-
tors associated with leaving the workforce prior to
an individual actually being unemployed - that is,
what factors are at play as individuals are making
the decision to leave the workforce? This is particu-
larly important as it allows for a better determination
of what symptoms or factors account for individuals
feeling as if they have to reduce their hours or leave
entirely. Retrospective studies also render it difficult
to determine if the presence of identified factors asso-
ciated with unemployment (e.g., depression, fatigue)
were as great prior to leaving or are a consequence
of not working. For instance, while depression and
fatigue may predispose one to leave work, they may
also be a consequence of being unemployed. In fact,
increased depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance
are all known to occur among unemployed individu-
als in the general population [32]. Given the presence
of these symptoms in MS, it is imperative to delin-
eate whether or not these are the actual culprits that
account for individuals leaving the workforce or sim-
plyanartifactofbeingunemployed,orboth.Thus,the
present study is the first investigation aimed at exam-
ining the factors associated with one’s decision to
leave the workforce prior to doing so, making it a very
unique contribution to our understanding of employ-
ment challenges in persons with MS. Given the fact
that disease and demographic variables are purported
to be insufficient in accounting for such, the present
investigation aims to determine the contribution that
personality, self-efficacy, and coping have above and
beyond the disease itself when making employment
decisions.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
All participants (n = 109) were diagnosed with
clinically definite MS as verified by their neurologist
and had enrolled in an investigation examin-
ing disease and person-specific factors associated
with employment status in MS. Eligibility criteria
included age ranging from 20 to 64, absence of
other neurological disorders, and being presently
employed. At the onset of the study, individuals
reported whether or not they were considering reduc-
ing their hours or leaving the workforce altogether
in the near future (i.e., within the upcoming year)
due to their MS. Those individuals who were consid-
ering reducing their hours or leaving the workforce
altogether due to their MS constituted the “consid-
ering group.” Individuals who reported no intent to
leave in the foreseeable future made up the “stay-
ing” group. Of this initial sample, 20 were in the
“considering” group. Of the remaining 89 individuals
who anticipated no change in their work status (“stay-
ing” group), 20 individuals were identified that were
matched to the considering group on gender, age,
education, disease course, and disease duration for
comparison.Oftheconsideringgroup,18(90%)were
employed full-time and 2 were employed part-time.
Sixteen (80%) of the staying group were employed
full-time with 4 employed part-time (See Table 1).
All participants then completed an online survey
consisting of questionnaires assessing work sta-
tus and history, disease symptoms (e.g., fatigue),
psychological functioning, personality, coping, self-
efficacy, locus of control (LOC), and engagement
in health promoting behaviors. All study procedures
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Kessler Foundation. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
2.2. Measures
The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) was
utilized to assess fatigue. The MFIS is modified form
of the Fatigue Impact Scale [33] that is based on 21
items derived from interviews with MS patients con-
cerning how fatigue impacts their lives. It consists of
threesubscales:physical,cognitive,andpsychosocial
functioning.
Depression was assessed by the Chicago Mul-
tiscale
Depression
Inventory
(CMDI)
[34],
a
self-report measure that was specifically designed
to assess depression in MS and other medically-ill
groups. It consists of three subscales: Evaluative,
Mood, and Vegetative. Each subscale contains 14
items.
The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [35] was
used to assess state and trait anxiety. Individuals are
asked to rate how the feel at this moment (state anxi-
ety) as well as how they generally feel (trait anxiety)
on 20 items assessing symptoms of anxiety.
Personality was assessed with the NEO-Five Fac-
tor Inventory-3 (NEO-FFI-3) [36], which is based
on the five factor model of personality and includes
subscales of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraver-
sion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Individuals
rate on a five-point Likert scale the extent to

which an attribute or behavioral tendency applies

The COPE inventory [37] assesses different ways
individuals respond to stress. It consists of five scales
(of four items each) to measure problem-focused
coping (Active Coping, Planning, Suppression of
Competing Activities, Restraint Coping, Seeking of
Instrumental Social Support) and five scales to mea-
sure emotion-focused coping (Seeking of Emotional
Social Support, Positive Reinterpretation, Accep-
tance, Denial, Turning to Religion) and three less
adaptive coping styles (Focus on and Venting of
Emotions, Behavioral Disengagement, Mental Dis-
engagement). Three items also measure Alcohol and
Drug Use and four items assess use of Humor.
Self-efficacy was measured by the General Self-
Efficacy Scale (GSE) [38] as well as the Disability
Management Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSES) [39]. The
latter was developed specifically for use in MS and
assesses an individuals’ perceived self-efficacy with
regard to managing their MS and its interference on
their everyday activities and overall well-being.
Locus of Control was assessed by the International
Personality Item Pool Locus of Control scale (IPIP-
LOC) [40]. The IPIP-LOC assesses the degree to
which individuals perceive having an external versus
internal locus of control.
2.3. Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using
SPSS version 21.0. Initial comparisons of group
means (Independent Students’ t-test) and frequencies
(Chi-square) were made between those consider-
ing leaving or reducing work hours and those who
had no intent on changing their work status with
regard to demographic factors. All analyses were
conducted with raw scores of the measures. Based
on these findings, six separate logistic regression
analyses were then conducted with the follow-
ing as independent variables: (1) Fatigue (Physical
fatigue,Cognitivefatigue,Psychosocialfatigue,Total
fatigue); (2) Depression (Evaluative); (3) Anxiety
(Trait, State); (4) Self-efficacy and LOC (General
self-efficacy, MS-specific self-efficacy); (5) Per-
sonality (Neuroticism, Extraversion); (6) Coping
(Humor, Behavioral Disengagement). A subsequent
final, stepwise logistic regression was conducted only
with the variables found to be significant in these
regression analyses to determine which factors were
most predictive of individuals feeling as if they need
to reduce work hours or leave the workforce.
3. Results
As stated, the purpose of the present investigation
was to determine the contribution that person-specific
factors (e.g., personality, self-efficacy, coping) have
on employment decisions, above and beyond disease
variables. Consistent with the matching of partici-
pants, there were no differences between the groups
with regard to gender, age, education, disease course,
or disease duration (in years). There were also no
differences between the groups with regard to work
status (i.e., full versus part time employment) (See
Table 1).
Group demographics and differences (t-test and
effect size) on measures of fatigue, depression,
anxiety, self-efficacy, locus of control, coping, and
personality are provided in Table 2 for reference.
Please note that the effect sizes are only provided
for those factors that reached statistical significance
of p < 0.05.
Several regression analyses were conducted to
determine which factors best differentiate those
considering reducing work hours or leaving the
workforce from those staying employed. In the first
regression examining fatigue as an independent vari-
able, only the physical fatigue scale was found to
be a significant predictor. Among the psychological
variables, state anxiety reigned as the most signif-
icant variable and there was a trend for evaluative

symptoms of depression. The DMSES, a measure of
MS specific self-efficacy was found to be the most
significantpredictoramongtheself-efficacyandLOC
measures. With regard to personality, only extraver-
sion was included in the final model. Finally, of the
COPE variables, humor and behavioral disengage-
ment were found to differentiate those considering
leaving or reducing work hours from those staying
employed (See Table 3).
A final logistic regression was subsequently con-
ducted to determine the most salient predictors of
individuals considering leaving or cutting back when
compared to those staying employed. The variables
found to be significant in the preceding six regres-
sion analyses were included (i.e., physical fatigue,
evaluative symptoms, state anxiety, MS self-efficacy,
extraversion, and use of humor and behavioral dis-
engagement as a means of coping). In this final
model, the most significant predictors among these
six variables were humor and behavioral disengage-
ment as a coping mechanism and fatigue, accounting
for 44% of the variance (See Table 4).
4. Discussion
The present investigation aimed to examine factors
beyond demographics and disease variables that may
distinguish individuals with MS who are considering
reducing work hours or leaving the workforce from
those staying employed. It was found that fatigue,
depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-efficacy, person-
ality,andcopingstylesallplayaroleindifferentiating
these two groups. The greatest effect (d = 1.28) was
observed for physical fatigue, which has long been
purported to be a primary reason for individuals
reducing hours or stopping work. However, such indi-
viduals also reported experiencing greater anxiety

and more negative self-evaluative symptoms, as well
as reporting lower levels of general and MS-specific
self-efficacy, with effect sizes ranging from 0.67 to
1.08. The finding that such individuals are prone
to negative affect and feel as if they have less self-
efficacy or control over their illness, or in their lives
in general, is a significant finding. Self-efficacy has
been proven to be a significant predictor of various
outcomes in MS including health status [41], adher-
ence to treatment [42], disease management [43],
adjustment [44], physical and social functioning [45],
and physical activity and health-related quality of life
in MS [46]. Thus, it is possible that an individual’s
perceived self-efficacy may mediate the relation-
ship between disease factors and employment status,
beyond disease variables. Individuals with high self-
efficacy, regardless of disability level may feel that
they can manage and control the impact of their
MS and subsequent impact on day-to-day function-
ing such as employment. Such individuals may also
feel that they can tackle the challenges they face in
the workplace and find ways to manage expectations,

regarding the role of self-efficacy and employment

45
are also important given that there are several inves-
tigations that have shown that self-efficacy can be
improved. For example, wellness programs [47],
cognitive behavioral interventions [48], and fatigue
management programs [49] have all been shown to
result in improved levels of self-efficacy. Given the
findings of the present study, assessment of one’s self-
efficacy and potential intervention to improve it may
result in better employment outcomes.
The present findings also suggests that coping
style is an important factor, with individuals staying
employed utilizing humor more often and those con-
sidering cutting back or leaving describing greater
utilization of behavioral disengagement. The use of
negative or emotion-focused coping such as behav-
ioral disengagement has consistently been shown to
be related to poorer adjustment in MS [50], which
may account for individuals feeling they must reduce
hours or leave work completely. Research has shown
that the majority of adjustment takes place within
the first 10 years of diagnosis, with reports of lower
depression [51] and greater self-concept following
thiscriticalperiod[52].Whenlookingattheconsider-
ing group, it should be noted that the average disease
duration was approximately five years, a fairly early
tenure with MS in which many are likely still in the
process of adjusting to a variable and unpredictable
disease. It is even more noteworthy that while the
range of years of diagnosis of the considering group
was one to 22 years, 50% of the sample was diag-
nosed within the past three years and 70% within
the past five years. In fact, only three individuals in
the considering group were diagnosed more than 10
years ago (11, 17, and 22 years). This is in contrast
to the larger, employed group in this sample (prior to
matching procedures that reduced the group size from
89 to 20), which had a mean disease duration of nine
years with 55% of the sample having a disease dura-
tion greater than nine years. If simply comparing the
two groups, it is striking that 50% of the considering
group were within three years of diagnosis and 55%
of the staying employed group were diagnosed nine
or more years ago; a time at which they may have
adjusted to their diagnosis and disease. While it has
been shown that disease duration and a progressive
course are predictive of leaving the workforce, this
data argues against disease progression and greater
impairment as primary reasons for people leaving
the workforce. It may be that individuals with longer
disease duration have adjusted to their illness and per-
haps have more perceived certainty and associated
self-efficacy in dealing with their illness that allows
them to remain employed. Present findings suggest
that those considering reducing their hours/leaving
work in this sample are perhaps having a difficult
time adjusting to this illness as they are early in
the disease course, are more depressed and anxious,
and report having lower self-efficacy. Such findings
suggest that early intervention, as opposed to later,
may assist individuals with MS staying employed
when the factors accounting for the decision are more
related to person-specific factors such as coping and
less to do with the disease and associated impair-
ment, per se. This new conceptualization of when
and for who early intervention may be warranted is
the primary aim on the present investigation and it
is hoped that these findings highlight the importance
of assessing these factors when making employment
decisions with patients, particularly early on in the
disease process.
Finally, individuals who were considering cutting
back/leaving endorsed lower levels of extraversion
and this was found to be a significant predictor of
employment status. Individuals also reported higher
levels of neuroticism. As stated earlier, this syn-
ergistic combination of high neuroticism and low
extraversion has been described as the “Type D or
Distressed”personality.Thefindingthattheconsider-
ing group fits this pattern and report more depression
and anxiety raises concern that such individuals may
have significant health and social risks in addition to
being at risk for unemployment. The fact that they
are considering leaving work may be a red flag for
graver concerns and potentially poorer overall prog-
nosis. Moreover, given the impact unemployment can
have on health and overall quality of life, these indi-
viduals are vulnerable to further mental and physical
decline once out of work. It is thus imperative that
these factors be assessed when individuals are in the
process of making work determinations.
While these preliminary data are certainly com-
pelling, there are certain limitations that temper the
conclusions from this study. For one, a larger sam-
ple size is preferable. Given that this work is only
preliminary, we suspect that once a larger sample of
“considering” individuals are identified we will be
able to not only obtain larger effect sizes, but will
be able to model these factors in a more comprehen-
sive manner to derive odds ratios for these constructs.
Given the small sample at this time, we also do not
have variability in disease course. In fact, all 40 par-
ticipants have a relapsing-remitting course. Inclusion
of individuals with a progressive course would ren-
der study findings more generalizable. Related to this
 46
L.B. Strober et al. / Factors impacting employment status in MS
is the lack of a measure of disease severity such as
the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Given
that this was a national survey study, we have to rely
on patients’ neurologists to supply relevant medical
information. Many did not report doing an EDSS or
when done, may have been too far from the date of
study to be reliable. Finally, we do not have cognitive
test data on those individuals that we did not see in
person. Given the proven validity of the Symbol Digit
Modalities Test (SDMT) as the sole measure con-
sistently predicting employment status [18] we have
revised the study to now include an online version
of the SDMT and expect that such data will greatly
enhance this study.
In sum, the preliminary data of this study sheds
light on the fact that there are a multitude of fac-
tors that need to be taken into account when making
important decisions regarding employment in MS.
These factors are certainly not limited to demograph-
ics and disease variables, despite them being the most
studied to date. Further investigations should include
more person-specific factors – both for identifying
factors accountable for leaving as well as maintaining
employment. For instance, based on present find-
ings, the use of humor as a means of coping may be
serving as a buffer and helping people manage their
illness and stay employed. Thus, it may be beneficial
to incorporate the use of humor and similar positive
means of coping into therapeutic interventions. It is
also hoped that these study findings alert practitioners
totheimportanceofassessingthesefactorsinpractice
when making decisions with their patients regarding
work. Having an open dialogue regarding these fac-
tors and their potential contribution to work difficulty
seems just as necessary as discussing disease factors.
Effective communication of such may also result in
more appropriate interventions and in turn, mainte-
nance of employment and subsequent quality of life,
which is the ultimate goal.
