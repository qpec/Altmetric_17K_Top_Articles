IMPORTANCE Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reflects past glucose concentrations, but this
relationship may differ between those with sickle cell trait (SCT) and those without it.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between SCT and HbA1c for given levels of fasting
or 2-hour glucose levels among African Americans.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study using data collected
from 7938 participants in 2 community-based cohorts, the Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and the Jackson Heart Study (JHS).
From the CARDIA study, 2637 patients contributed a maximum of 2 visits (2005-2011);
from the JHS, 5301 participants contributed a maximum of 3 visits (2000-2013). All visits
were scheduled at approximately 5-year intervals. Participants without SCT data, those
without any concurrent HbA1c and glucose measurements, and those with hemoglobin
variants HbSS, HbCC, or HbAC were excluded. Analysis of the primary outcome was
conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the association of SCT
with HbA1c levels, controlling for fasting or 2-hour glucose measures.
EXPOSURES Presence of SCT.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hemoglobin A1c stratified by the presence or absence of
SCT was the primary outcome measure.
RESULTS The analytic sample included 4620 participants (mean age, 52.3 [SD, 11.8] years;
2835 women [61.3%]; 367 [7.9%] with SCT) with 9062 concurrent measures of fasting
glucose and HbA1c levels. In unadjusted GEE analyses, for a given fasting glucose, HbA1c
values were statistically significantly lower in those with (5.72%) vs those without (6.01%)
SCT (mean HbA1c difference, −0.29%; 95% CI, −0.35% to −0.23%). Findings were similar in
models adjusted for key risk factors and in analyses using 2001 concurrent measures of
2-hour glucose and HbA1c concentration for those with SCT (mean, 5.35%) vs those without
SCT (mean, 5.65%) for a mean HbA1c difference of −0.30% (95% CI, −0.39% to −0.21%).
The HbA1c difference by SCT was greater at higher fasting (P = .02 for interaction) and
2-hour (P = .03) glucose concentrations. The prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes
was statistically significantly lower among participants with SCT when defined using HbA1c
values (29.2% vs 48.6% for prediabetes and 3.8% vs 7.3% for diabetes in 572 observations
from participants with SCT and 6877 observations from participants without SCT; P<.001
for both comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among African Americans from 2 large, well-established
cohorts, participants with SCT had lower levels of HbA1c at any given concentration of fasting
or 2-hour glucose compared with participants without SCT. These findings suggest that HbA1c
may systematically underestimate past glycemia in black patients with SCT and may require
further evaluation.

H
emoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a practical measure of aver-
age glucose levels during the preceding 2 to 3
months.1-4 In 2009, after review of available evi-
dence, an International Expert Committee recommended
the use of HbA1c to diagnose diabetes.5 Extensive work has
been done by the NGSP (formerly, the National Glycohemo-
globin Standardization Program) to standardize methods for
measuring HbA1c and to identify methods that provide accu-
rate HbA1c measurement even in the presence of hemoglo-
bin variants.6
Sickle cell trait (SCT) is the most common hemoglobin
variant in the United States, with 8% to 10% of black people
affected by SCT compared with less than 1% of white
people.7,8 Red blood cells of individuals with normal hemo-
globin contain approximately 97% HbA, whereas red blood
cells of individuals with SCT contain approximately 60% to
70% HbA and 30% to 40% HbS.9 Although data are limited,
it is hypothesized that the presence of HbS results in a
shorter lifespan for red blood cells.9-12 This would result in
less available time for hemoglobin glycation, which in turn
may influence the interpretation of HbA1c in relationship to
the glucose values they intend to represent. Correct inter-
pretation of HbA1c values in individuals with SCT is impor-
tant because it directly affects efforts that use HbA1c for
screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of diabetes and pre-
diabetes. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to (1)
examine the association between HbA1c and SCT while con-
trolling for other measures of glucose (fasting and 2-hour
glucose) levels, (2) compare the prevalence of prediabetes
and diabetes by SCT status, and (3) determine if SCT modi-
fies the discriminative ability of HbA1c to identify individu-
als with prediabetes or diabetes.
Methods
Study Population
This retrospective study pooled data from participants who
self-identified as African American from 2 established
community-based cohorts, the Coronary Artery Risk Devel-
opment in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and the Jackson
Heart Study (JHS), to examine the association of SCT
with HbA1c, controlling for fasting glucose or 2-hour glucose
levels. Details regarding the design of each study have
been published.13,14 In brief, the CARDIA study enrolled,
from March 25, 1985 to June 7, 1986, a stratified sample of
2637 black people and 2478 white people (n = 5115) from
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; Birmingham,
Alabama; and Oakland, California. After their initial visit,
participants were followed up approximately 2, 5, 7, 10,
15, 20, and 25 years later (data collection, 1985-present).
The Jackson Heart Study, a single-site study in Jackson,
Mississippi, enrolled 5301 African Americans during the
years 2000 through 2004. Participants returned for 2
follow-up examinations approximately 5 and 10 years after
their initial visit (data collection, 2000-2013). The data used
for these analyses were from years 20 and 25 from the
CARDIA cohort and from baseline and years 5 and 10 from
the JHS cohort. All participants included in analyses pro-
vided written informed consent for genetic studies. Institu-
tional review board approval was obtained separately from
each participating institution.
Covariate Assessment
Details regarding data collection procedures for CARDIA15,16
and JHS17 have been published. Data on participants’sex,
self-reported race, date of birth, diet, physical activity,
smoking status, medical history, and medication use were
collected at each visit by trained interviewers. Physical
activity was classified as poor (0), intermediate (>0-<150),
or ideal (≥150) using minutes per week of moderate to vigor-
ous physical activity. Diet was classified as poor (0-1), inter-
mediate (2-3), or ideal (4-5) using the number of compo-
nents achieved from the following list: 4.5 or more cups of
fruits and vegetables daily; 198 g or more of fish weekly; less
than 1500 mg of sodium daily; less than 450 calories each
week of sugar-sweetened beverages; and 3 or more servings
daily of whole grains. Smoking was classified as poor (cur-
rent smoker), intermediate (quit <12 months ago) or ideal
(never smoked or quit ≥12 months ago). Height and weight
were measured by certified study personnel and used to cal-
culate body mass index (BMI), weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared. Estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) was calculated at years 20 and 25 in CARDIA
and at baseline and year 10 in JHS using the Chronic Kidney
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.18
Serum ferritin was measured at year 20 in CARDIA and at
baseline in JHS. Previous diabetes diagnosis was defined as
self-report of a physician’
s diagnosis. Current use of diabe-
tes medications was defined as use of diabetes medications
in the 2 weeks prior to the examination.
SCT Status
In CARDIA, SCT status was determined with available DNA
samples from the 10-year follow-up and afterwards using
single-gene, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) geno-
typing with TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Life Technolo-
gies). In JHS, genotype data for rs334 encoding the sickle
hemoglobin mutation (HBB p.Glu7Val) was obtained
through whole-exome sequencing using data from baseline.
Sickle cell trait was defined as the presence of 1 abnormal
allele for HbS.
Key Points
Question Does hemoglobin A1c reflect past glucose
concentrations in a similar manner in African Americans with
sickle cell trait as it does in those without sickle cell trait?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 4620 African
Americans, for any given fasting or 2-hour glucose concentration,
individuals with sickle cell trait had significantly lower hemoglobin
A1c values, 5.72% vs 6.01%, than those without sickle cell trait.
Meaning Among African Americans with sickle cell trait,
hemoglobin A1c concentration may systematically underestimate
past glycemia and should be further evaluated.

Plasma Glucose Measures
Plasma glucose was measured using the hexokinase method
at all visits in both studies except at baseline in JHS, at which
time the glucose oxidase method was used. Previous re-
search has shown these 2 methods of glucose measurement
to be highly correlated.19,20 Additionally, 2-hour glucose lev-
els were measured in CARDIA and obtained during a stan-
dard oral glucose tolerance test, using 75 g of glucose solu-
tion. The coefficient of variation for glucose measures ranged
from 1.6% to 3.8% (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
HbA1c Measures
Two NGSP-certified assays were used to measure HbA1c, both
using high-performance liquid chromatography. In JHS,
a Tosoh 2.2 was used at baseline and a Tosoh G7 (variant mode)
was used at the 5- and 10-year follow-ups. In CARDIA, a Tosoh
G7 (variant mode) was used at the 20- and 25-year follow-up.
According to the NGSP, neither Tosoh 2.2 nor Tosoh G7 (vari-
ant mode) has experienced clinically significant interference in
those with SCT.6 The coefficient of variation for HbA1c assays
ranged from 1.2% to 1.9% (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Main Outcome Measure
The main outcome measure, HbA1c, was assessed at multiple
time points and pooled cross-sectionally to examine the
association between HbA1c, modeled as a continuous vari-
able, and SCT, adjusting for fasting or 2-hour glucose mea-
sures. Prespecified secondary outcomes include prediabetes,
diabetes, and combined prediabetes or diabetes, which
were defined using the following measures based on cut-
points established by the American Diabetes Association21:
(1) fasting glucose levels (prediabetes, 100-<126 mg/dL;
diabetes, ≥126 mg/dL; and combined prediabetes or dia-
betes, ≥100 mg/dL), 2-hour glucose levels (prediabetes,
140-<200 mg/dL; diabetes, ≥200 mg/dL; and combined pre-
diabetes or diabetes, ≥140 mg/dL), and HbA1c levels (predia-
betes, 5.7%-<6.5%; diabetes, ≥6.5%; combined prediabetes or
diabetes, ≥5.7%). (To convert glucose from mg/dL to mmol/L,
multiply by 0.0555.)
Statistical Methods
Baseline characteristics of participants with and without SCT
were compared using χ2 tests and analysis of variance for dis-
creteandcontinuousvariables,respectively.Allvisitswithcon-
current measurement of HbA1c and fasting glucose or HbA1c
and 2-hour glucose levels were included in the analyses. Mean
HbA1c values were calculated by SCT status across a range of
glucose categories in 10-mg/dL increments for fasting glu-
cose (<80-≥150 mg/dL) and in 20-mg/dL increments for 2-hour
glucose levels (<80-≥200 mg/dL).
Generalized estimating equations (GEE) using random
effects at the participant level and an exchangeable correla-
tion matrix to account for correlation among repeated mea-
sures were used to assess the association of SCT with HbA1c
controlling for fasting glucose levels.22 A multistep approach
was used to examine the robustness of findings to model
specification. First, unadjusted GEE models were fit using
HbA1c as the outcome, SCT as the exposure, and glucose as
the primary covariate. Next, GEE analyses were adjusted for
the following potential confounders that were identified a
priori based on the literature: age, sex, BMI, ferritin levels,
eGFR, physician-diagnosed diabetes, use of diabetes medica-
tions, and study cohort.23-25 In addition, multiplicative
SCT × glucose interaction was tested in unadjusted and
adjusted models. Analyses were repeated using 2-hour glu-
cose measures in lieu of fasting glucose measures as the main
covariate. Model fit was compared using quasi-likelihood
under the independence-model criterion.26 Prespecified sub-
group analyses were conducted among participants not tak-
ing diabetes medications and in groups of participants strati-
fied by cohort. Interaction by cohort and HbA1c assay on the
association between SCT and HbA1c was tested.
Next, among a subset of participants with no previous
diabetes or current use of diabetes medications, GEE analy-
ses with a Poisson distribution and an identity link function
were used to estimate the unadjusted prevalence of predia-
betes and diabetes by SCT status.27
In the same subset of participants, GEE analyses with a
Poisson distribution and a log link function (sometimes called
a modified Poisson model) were used to generate predictive
probabilities that were then used in logistic regression
models to compare the discriminative ability of HbA1c levels
to identify the combined presence of prediabetes or dia-
betes.28 A combined outcome of prediabetes or diabetes
was used due to consideration of sample size. Area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves were cal-
culated for HbA1c levels in those with and without SCT.
Unpaired comparisons of the AUROC curves were conducted
to assess the discriminatory power of HbA1c by SCT status.29,30
Complete case analysis was performed for adjusted analyses
because data were more than 98% complete, with the excep-
tion of ferritin (7% missing). A 2-sided P value of ≤.05 was used
for level of significance. Analyses were performed using SAS
statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 7938 participants were enrolled at baseline, of
whom 2637 were in CARDIA and 5301 in JHS. One thousand
sixty-five CARDIA and 2253 JHS participants were excluded.
Of those excluded in CARDIA, 550 had no available SCT data;
3 had HbSS; 2, HbCC; 41, HbAC; and 469, no concurrent mea-
surements of HbA1c or fasting or 2-hour glucose measure-
ments. Of those excluded in JHS, 2079 had no available SCT
data; 2, HbSS; 80, HbAC; and 92, no concurrent measure-
ments of HbA1c and fasting or 2-hour glucose. A total of 4620
participants (58.2%) were included in these analyses—1572 in
CARDIA and 3048 in JHS. Other than having a lower mean
BMI, the 1019 CARDIA and 2171 JHS participants excluded
from the analyses because of missing data had comparable
baseline characteristics with those included in the analysis
(BMI, 29.4 vs 29.8; P = .01; eTable 2 in the Supplement).
The 367 participants (7.9%) with SCT were older (53.9
vs 52.2 years, P = .007) and had lower eGFR (92.5 vs

97.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < .001), and lower HbA1c values
(5.7% vs 5.9%, P = .001; Table 1) than did participants with-
out SCT. Additionally, participants with SCT were more likely
to report previously diagnosed diabetes (17.2% vs 14.7%,
P=.20) and current use of diabetes medications (15.0% vs
12.5%, P=.19), although these findings did not reach statisti-
cal significance.
Association of HbA1c With Glucose Measures
For all 4620 participants, each visit with concurrent HbA1c and
fasting glucose or HbA1c and 2-hour glucose measures was in-
cluded, resulting in 9062 concurrent measures of HbA1c and
fasting glucose (2583 from CARDIA; 6479 from JHS) from 4620
unique participants and 2001 concurrent measures of HbA1c
and 2-hour glucose measures (2001 from CARDIA) from 1323
unique participants (eFigure in the Supplement). The major-
ity of participants (74.6%) had HbA1c and glucose measured at
least twice. Using all available observations, the mean HbA1c
was 5.7% in those with SCT vs 6.0% in those without SCT, de-
spite similar mean fasting (103.0 vs 102.9 mg/dL; P=.88) and
2-hour glucose values (118.5 vs 113.0 mg/dL; P=.19) for those
with SCT vs those without SCT, respectively. Across all cat-
egories of fasting and 2-hour glucose measures, mean HbA1c
values were lower in those with vs without SCT (Table 2).
Unadjusted GEE analyses revealed that, at the same fast-
ing glucose concentration, HbA1c values were statistically

justed analyses, HbA1c values remained significantly lower in
those with SCT (mean HbA1c difference, −0.32%; 95% CI,
−0.38% to −0.26%; P < .001). The difference in HbA1c levels
by SCT status was greater at higher concentrations of fasting
glucose (P = .02 for interaction in unadjusted analyses,
Figure 1A; P = .01 in adjusted analyses, Figure 1B). Results were
similar in analyses stratified by study cohort and when ex-
cluding 1302 observations from participants taking diabetes

(P = .43forSCT × fastingglucose × HbA1cassay)orbystudyco-

Prevalence of Prediabetes and Diabetes
Among a subset of participants with no prior diagnosis of dia-
betes or current use of diabetes medications (7449 observa-
tions for fasting glucose and HbA1c; 1869 observations for
2-hour glucose and HbA1c), the prevalence of prediabetes and
diabetes was not significantly different among participants
with vs without SCT when defined using fasting glucose
(28.6% with vs 25.0% without SCT for prediabetes; P = .12;
2.5% with vs 3.6% without SCT for diabetes; P = .25) or
2-hour glucose values (15.9% with vs 12.9% without SCT for
prediabetes, P = .45; and 3.6% with vs 3.3% without SCT
for diabetes; P > .89; Figure 2). In contrast, the prevalence of
prediabetes and diabetes was statistically significantly lower
among participants with SCT when defined using HbA1c val-
ues (29.2% with vs 48.6% without SCT for prediabetes and
3.8% with vs 7.3% without SCT for diabetes; P < .001 for all
comparisons, Figure 2).
Discriminative Ability of HbA1c to Identify Prediabetes
or Diabetes
In the same subset of participants without diabetes or dia-
betes medication use, the discriminative ability of HbA1c to
identify the presence of prediabetes or diabetes was statisti-
cally significantly lower among participants with SCT
(AUROC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65-0.74) vs without SCT (AUROC,
0.77; 95% CI, 0.75-0.78; absolute difference, 0.07; 95% CI,
0.02-0.12) when using fasting glucose–defined prediabetes or
diabetes (P < .01, Figure 3A). The same held true among par-
ticipants with SCT (AUROC, 0.60; 10 95% CI, 0.47-0.72) vs
those without SCT (AUROC, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.78; absolute
difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.28) when using 2-hour
glucose-defined prediabetes or diabetes measures (P = .02,
Figure 3B).

Discussion
In this retrospective cohort study of African Americans par-
ticipating in 2 large US cohorts, we demonstrated that, at the
same fasting or 2-hour glucose concentration, HbA1c is statis-
tically significantly lower among participants with vs with-
out SCT. Moreover, differences in HbA1c concentration by SCT
statusweregreaterathigherglucoseconcentrations.Thesedif-
ferences are based on an HbA1c method reported to have no
clinically significant interference in individuals with SCT.6,31
Our findings stand in contrast to 2 previous studies. Bleyer
and colleagues32 investigated the HbA1c-glucose association in
385AfricanAmericaninpatients,themajorityofwhomhaddia-
betes and among whom there was an unusually high preva-
lence of SCT: 109 (28%) had SCT. Despite higher baseline HbA1c
values, the authors did not find that SCT significantly altered
therelationshipbetweenHbA1candserumglucose.Sumnerand
colleagues33 examined the sensitivity of HbA1c to detect im-
paired glucose tolerance in a cohort of 216 African immigrants
withoutdiabetes,46(21%)ofwhomhadeitherHbCtraitorSCT.
They found no significant difference in the sensitivity of HbA1c
by variant hemoglobin status in the detection of prediabetes;
however, this study combined participants with SCT and HbC
trait, which may have affected findings. Additionally, both of
these studies are potentially limited by their small sample size.

Scatterplot of observed data points alongside unadjusted and adjusted
regression lines examining the association between sickle cell trait (SCT) and
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), controlling for fasting or 2-hour glucose values was
obtained using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with an exchangeable
correlation matrix to account for correlation of repeated measures. All
continuous covariates are centered at the population mean. The solid blue lines
represent the regression line for those for who did not have SCT and the dashed
orange lines for those who had SCT. BMI indicates body mass index; CARDIA,

We consider 2 ways in which SCT could modify the ability
of HbA1c to accurately reflect past glycemia. First, the life-
span of the red blood cells in persons with SCT may be short-
ened compared with those with normal hemoglobin, result-
ing in less time available for glycation. However, the evidence
tosupportthishypothesisremainslimitedandconflicting.9-12
Second, the presence of HbS can result in assay interference
with common HbA1c measurement techniques. Current test-
ing on HbA1c laboratory methods uses a relative bias of plus or
minus 7.0% to classify clinically significant interference from
hemoglobin variants.6 Although the assays used in this study
reportnoclinicallysignificantinterferenceinindividualswith
SCT, the possibility of minor interference that could poten-
tially explain our findings cannot be ruled out.

0.75-0.78) among those without sickle cell trait (SCT) and 0.70 (95% CI,
0.65-0.74) among those with SCT. An unpaired comparison of the AUROC

Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c analyses included 7499 total observations
(6877 observations from participants without sickle cell trait [SCT] and 572
from participants with it). Analyses for 2-hour glucose concentrations were only
available from CARDIA participants and included 1869 total observations (1752
observations from participants without SCT and 117 from participants with SCT).
For the definition of prediabetes and diabetes by glucose measures, see the
Methods section. The prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes by fasting
glucose and 2-hour glucose concentration was similar in those with and without
SCT (P > .10 for all comparisons). However, the prevalence of prediabetes and
diabetes as defined by hemoglobin A1c was significantly higher among
participants with vs without SCT (P < .001 for both). Error bars indicate 95% CIs.

Irrespectiveofthemechanism,ourresultssuggestthatcur-
rently accepted clinical measures of HbA1c do not reflect re-
cent past glycemia in the same way in African Americans with
andwithoutSCT,asevidencedbysignificantlylowerHbA1cval-
ues at the same glucose concentration in those with vs with-
out SCT. These results could have clinically significant impli-
cations. As a screening tool, an HbA1c value that systematically
underestimateslong-termglucoselevelsmayresultinamissed
opportunity for intervention. In the present study, using stan-
dard clinical HbA1c criteria to identify prediabetes and diabe-
tes resulted in identifying 40% fewer cases of prediabetes and
48% fewer cases of diabetes among participants with SCT com-
paredwiththosewithoutSCT,whileglucose-basedmethodsre-
sultedinasimilarprevalenceregardlessofSCTstatus(Figure2).
ThediscriminativeabilityofHbA1cconcentrationtoidentifyin-
dividuals with prediabetes or diabetes was significantly lower
in those with vs those without SCT (Figure 3). These findings
raise the possibility of benefit from incorporating information
on hemoglobin variants into clinical guidelines for interpret-
ingHbA1cvaluesforscreeninganddiagnosisofprediabetesand
diabetes. Because black people typically have a higher preva-
lence of diabetes and experience a number of diabetic compli-
cations at higher rates than white people, the cost of inaccu-
rately assessing risk and treatment response is high.34-36
In our study, African Americans with and without SCT had
relatively high HbA1c levels with mean values greater than 5%.
This is possibly due to the higher values often found in black
people than in white people.37,38 Future studies that include
biracial populations should further investigate HbA1c differ-
ences by race in relation to hemoglobinopathies. We also noted
that individuals with SCT had a lower eGFR as was observed
previously by Naik and colleagues.39 Future studies should fo-
cus on whether a possible delay in the diagnosis and treat-
ment of prediabetes and diabetes in those with SCT could ex-
plain their lower kidney function.
Strengths of our study include the availability of detailed
information on demographics, medical history, and clinical
measures as well as the reproducibility of findings across 2 dif-
ferentversionsoftheTosohHbA1cassay(2.2andG7)andacross
2 different measures of glucose concentration (fasting and
2-hour glucose).
This study has a number of limitations. Despite pooling
data from 2 large cohorts, a relatively small number of partici-
pants had SCT (367 participants). Although, to our knowl-
edge, this is the largest study to date examining the associa-
tion between HbA1c, SCT, and other glucose measures, further
studies including biracial populations and other hemoglobin
variants are needed to confirm and complement our find-
ings. Second, validation of these findings with other HbA1c as-
says would help explain the potential mechanisms of the dis-
parate HbA1c-glycemia association between those with and
without SCT. Third, even though multiple measures of glu-
cose were available and findings were consistent with fasting
and2-hourglucosemeasures,thesemeasurescannotfullyrep-
resent average glycemia over the prior 2 to 3 months, which
might lower the precision of our estimates. However, our find-
ings were robust in analyses adjusted for potential confound-
ingvariablesandinvarioussensitivityanalysessuggestingthat
the likelihood of such bias is low. Fourth, a large number of par-
ticipants were excluded from analyses due to missing data on
SCT status, HbA1c measures, or glucose measures; however,
participants excluded were comparable with those in the ana-
lytic sample with the exception of a lower BMI at baseline
among those excluded. In addition, no clinical outcomes were
assessed in this study. Whether the findings in this study have
clinical implications is unclear.
Conclusions
Among African Americans from 2 large, well-established co-
horts, participants with SCT had lower levels of HbA1c at any
givenconcentrationoffastingor2-hourglucosecomparedwith
participants without SCT. These findings suggest that HbA1c
may systematically underestimate past glycemia in black pa-
tients with SCT and may require further evaluation.
