Microbial metabolites are known to modulate immune responses of the host. The main
metabolites derived from microbial fermentation of dietary fibers in the intestine, short-chain
fatty acids (SCFA), affect local and systemic immune functions. Here we show that SCFA are
regulators of osteoclast metabolism and bone mass in vivo. Treatment of mice with SCFA as
well as feeding with a high-fiber diet significantly increases bone mass and prevents post-
menopausal and inflammation-induced bone loss. The protective effects of SCFA on bone
mass are associated with inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in vitro
and in vivo, while bone formation is not affected. Mechanistically, propionate (C3) and
butyrate (C4) induce metabolic reprogramming of osteoclasts resulting in enhanced glyco-
lysis at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation, thereby downregulating essential osteo-
clast genes such as TRAF6 and NFATc1. In summary, these data identify SCFA as potent
regulators of osteoclast metabolism and bone homeostasis.

 S
everal reports highlighted the immunomodulatory capa-
cities of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)1. As immune acti-
vation is intimately linked to bone homeostasis2–4, we
hypothesized that SCFA may influence bone homeostasis thereby
providing a direct mechanistic link between the gut microbiota
and bone. In support of the clinical relevance of this concept,
recent studies suggested that presence or absence of specific
bacterial species influence the course of inflammatory bone dis-
eases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA)5–7 and ankylosing
spondylitis8. Furthermore, it was shown that fiber-rich diet, the
main fermentable
source for SCFA, can ameliorate
bone
destruction in RA9. These observations prompted us to investi-
gate the role of SCFA on bone during steady-state conditions as
well as in the case of pathological bone loss during menopause
and inflammation. Studies addressing the role of the gut micro-
biota on bone homeostasis by using germ-free (GF), antibiotic-
treated
or
mono-colonized
mice
reported
contradicting
findings10–15. These discrepancies may be explained by different
microbial exposure of the mice used for the experiments.
Therefore, we tested whether the secreted metabolites of the gut
microbiota rather than the microbiota per se may explain these
effects. To test this hypothesis, we used three independent
experimental approaches (direct supplementation of SCFA, high-
fiber diet (HFD), and bacterial transfer) and found consistent
beneficial effects on steady state and postmenopausal bone
metabolism highly related to SCFA levels. It should be also
mentioned that the source and biological function of SCFA is
essentially different from long-chain fatty acids, which influence
insulin metabolism and where effects on bone have been
suggested16.
Here we show that the SCFA C3 and C4 have a beneficial
impact on bone homeostasis and alleviated disease in two models
of inflammatory arthritis. At the molecular level, the direct
impact of SCFA on bone homeostasis is dependent on early
metabolic reprogramming of pre-osteoclasts. Moreover, immu-
nosuppressive mechanisms induced by SCFA also contribute to
the attenuation of inflammation by inducing regulatory T cells
(Tregs). Hence, our findings indicate a crucial role of SCFA in
bone metabolism and immune responses attenuating the severity
of arthritis.
Results
SCFA and HFD increase systemic bone density. To determine
whether SCFA affect bone metabolism, we analyzed bone mass in
C57BL/6J (wild-type (WT)) mice either fed with or without C2/
C3/C4 supplementation in the drinking water for 8 weeks. After
8 weeks, serum SCFA concentrations in treated mice were sig-
nificantly increased (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Micro-computed
tomography (µCT) analysis of tibial bone showed that SCFA
treatment significantly increased bone mass as shown by
increased bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV) and decreased
trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) (Fig. 1a–c). CTX-I serum level, a
marker for bone resorption, was significantly decreased (Fig. 1d),
and SCFA treatment led to a significant decrease of bone-
degrading osteoclasts as shown by histomorphometric analysis
(Fig. 1e). In contrast, markers for bone formation such as
osteoblast numbers, serum osteocalcin (OCN) levels (total and
decarboxylated) and mineral apposition rate and bone formation
rate per bone surface remained unchanged (Fig. 1f, g and Sup-
plementary Fig. 1b, c).
As SCFA were shown to act on immune cells, especially to
induce Tregs17–19, we analyzed Treg numbers in the spleens and
found increased numbers after SCFA treatment while serum
cytokine levels remained largely unchanged, except for C4
treatment that impacted on interleukin (IL)-10, interferon-γ
(IFNγ), transforming grotwh factor-β (TGFβ) as well as on tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNFα) levels (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e).
Increased Tregs may explain the bone effects of SCFA since Treg
were shown to suppress osteoclasts and increased bone mass20–22.
To exclude this possibility, we treated RAG1−/− mice with SCFAs
and also observed an increase in BV/TV along with decreased
trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) and osteoclast numbers (Fig. 1h–j).
Interestingly, osteoclast numbers were not decreased in RAG1−/−
mice after C2 treatment, pointing toward a different suppressive
mechanism. Although we cannot exclude other possible indirect
mechanisms on innate immune cells, we can clearly exclude the
impact of T and B cells with these experiments. Also, a 14-day
nutritional supplementation of sodium propionate (Propicum) in
healthy humans significantly decreased serum parameters for
bone resorption (Fig. 1k) while leaving OCN levels unchanged
(Supplementary Fig. 1f).
Next, we investigated whether diets rich in fermentable,
indigestible fibers, which increase SCFA levels in the cecum and
serum (Fig. 1l and Supplementary Fig. 1g), exert similar effects on
bone. In accordance with direct SCFA supplementation, an 8-
week exposure to fiber-rich diet (Supplementary Table 1) led to
an increased bone mass (Fig. 1m) and decreased trabecular
separation (Fig. 1n) associated with decreased osteoclast numbers
and CTX-I serum levels (Fig. 1o and Supplementary Fig. 1h). At
the same time, OCN serum levels and osteoblast numbers
remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 1i, j). Although Treg
numbers were also increased after HFD treatment, serum
cytokine levels did not show significant changes (Supplementary
Fig. 1k, l). Of note, no differences in weight gain were observed in
the feeding experiments, either with SCFA or HFD (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1m).
We next addressed whether the transfer of specific bacterial
species and respective changes of gut microbiota and its secreted
metabolites could also impact bone mass. Enhanced abundance of
Prevotella copri has been described in early RA7. We therefore
transferred three representative species from the genus Prevotella
separately into WT mice and analyzed systemic bone mass
8 weeks later. Transfer of all Prevotella spp. significantly increased
osteoclast numbers (Supplementary Fig. 1n) and the relative
abundance of Prevotella spp. durably for 8 weeks (Supplementary
Fig. 1o, p) but decreased SCFA levels (Fig. 1p) and systemic bone
mass in the recipient mice (Fig. 1q, r), thus highlighting the
impact of disease-relevant changes in the microbiome and
subsequently in SCFA levels on bone homeostasis. This change
in bone mass after bacterial transfer seems to be specific for
Prevotella spp. as transfer of representative bacteria from
taxonomically related families Bacteroidaceae and Muribacula-
ceae did not show similar effects (Supplementary Fig. 1q).
SCFA change the metabolic state of pre-osteoclasts. Our in vivo
data indicated that SCFA modulate bone metabolism, resulting in
significant decreased bone resorption. In vitro, osteoclast differ-
entiation assays showed that concentrations from 0.03 mM of C2
and 0.015 mM of C3/C4 suppressed osteoclast differentiation
(Fig. 2a, b), and this range of concentration was found in pooled
bone marrow fluids from two individual experiments after SCFA
feeding, namely, around 0.4 mM for C3 and 0.15 mM for C4 after
adjusting measured concentrations in flushed bone marrow
samples to what we experimentally found in the bone marrow
fluid volume from repeated measurements of 5.5 ± 1.34 µl (n = 5)
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). The suppressive capacity of C2/C3/C4
on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption was indepen-
dent of the free fatty acid surface receptors FFA3 (GPR41) and
FFA2 (GPR43) (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). Mechanistically, C3
and C4 significantly suppressed two essential osteoclastogenic

 signaling components, TRAF6 and NFATc1, at early time points
after receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)
stimulation (Fig. 2c–e). Previous in vitro studies using C4 as
HDAC inhibitor for influencing bone cells showed inhibition of
osteoclasts while results were inconsistent in osteoblasts23–26.
While our in vivo data showed no consistent effects of SCFA on
osteoblasts and bone formation, C3 and C4 strongly suppressed
osteoclast differentiation.
Cell metabolism governs different cell functions27 and during
osteoclast differentiation several sequential metabolic changes

 whereas bone resorption by mature osteoclasts depends on
glycolysis. Here we show that C3/C4 stimulation significantly
induced glycolysis in osteoclast precursors after 48 h but left
oxidative phosphorylation unchanged (Fig. 2f–i and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2e). In fact, increased glycolysis has already been
associated with downregulation of TRAF6 in other cells30. Of
note, these metabolic shifts were also observed in osteoclast assays
of single GPR41, GPR43, and GRP41/43 double knockout (KO)
mice, although SCFA receptors are expressed on osteoclasts
(Supplementary Fig. 2f, h). Western blot analysis to detect energy
stress after C3 and C4 treatment by investigating the activation of
AMPK reveals a higher pAMPK/AMPK ratio (Fig. 2j). Moreover,
specific blocking of glycolysis by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) only
during the first critical 48 h during osteoclastogenesis in the
presence of C3 or C4 prevented the suppressive effect of C3 and
C4 (Fig. 2k). Addition of C3 and C4 at later time points had no
significant effects on osteoclast differentiation (data not shown).
Together, these results demonstrate that treatment of osteoclast
precursors with C3 and C4 shifts their metabolism at early time
points (24–48 h) during osteoclast differentiation toward glyco-
lysis, causing cell stress and thereby preventing osteoclast
differentiation.
SCFA protect from postmenopausal bone loss. To test whether
these findings could be exploited as novel strategy in the treat-
ment of pathological bone loss, we investigated the impact of
SCFA on postmenopausal bone loss induced after ovariectomy
(OVX). Treatments with C3 and C4 effectively prevented OVX-
induced bone loss (Fig. 3a–c). At the cellular level, we observed a
complete rescue of OVX-induced osteoclast formation after C3
and C4 treatment (Fig. 3d). The OVX-induced increase in CTX-I
concentrations in the serum was also completely blocked
(Fig. 3e). In contrast, OCN levels remained unchanged (Fig. 3f
and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Serum SCFA concentrations were
significantly increased to the range observed for in vitro sup-
pressive capacities of osteoclast differentiation (Supplementary
Figs. 3b and 2a). Again, no significant changes in body weight or
serum cytokine levels were detected (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d).
Of note, no positive effects on BV/TV were observed after HFD
feeding experiments during the OVX mouse model (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3e).
SCFA mitigate arthritis and protect from bone loss. As early as
1979, it was shown that GF rats developed exacerbated arthritis31.
Later reports revealed that not all types of bacteria have reg-
ulatory effects on arthritis. Pro-arthritogenic effects of certain
bacterial strains were shown after mono-colonization of GF
mice32,33. Furthermore, studies performed in gnotobiotic mice
showed discrepant results with either antiarthritogenic34 or
pro-arthritogenic35 effects of defined intestinal microbes. There-
fore, we addressed the role of SCFA and HFD on inflammatory
bone loss in two experimental arthritis models. C3/C4 treatment
significantly attenuated the severity of inflammation in the
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model (Fig. 4a, b), and
systemic bone mass was increased after C3/C4 treatment (Fig. 4c).
Decreased osteoclast numbers in the affected paws and serum
CTX-I
levels
were
decreased,
whereas
osteoblast
numbers
and OCN serum levels remained unchanged (Fig. 4d, e). SCFA
serum
concentrations were significantly
increased, whereas
no effect on weight gain was observed (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b).
Furthermore, osteoclast-specific gene expression in the bones
was significantly downregulated after treatment with C3/C4
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Of note, the observed effects seem to
be largely independent of GPR43 as treatment with C3/C4
also maintained bone mass and suppressed osteoclast-specific
genes in GPR43−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4d–h). Similar
effects were observed in the CIA mouse model after HFD feeding
(Fig. 4h–j) and in the K/BxN serum-induced mouse (SIA)
model after SCFA supplementation in the drinking water
(Fig. 4k–m), which significantly increased serum SCFA con-
centrations (Supplementary Fig. 4i). Furthermore, HFD feeding
also protected from inflammatory bone loss during the SIA
mouse model (Fig. 4n–p). In all performed experimental arthritis
models, no change in weight gain was observed (Supplementary
Fig. 4j, k).
Discussion
In previous studies, we and others could show that microbiota, or
their
metabolites,
regulate
innate
and
adaptive
immune
responses36–38. Here we show a hitherto undiscovered role of
SCFA on bone homeostasis. Our data suggest that microbial
homeostasis in the gut associated with adequate production of
SCFA is an important regulatory element in determining bone
composition in mice. Hence, not necessarily the microbial species
per se but rather the composition of secreted microbial metabo-
lites,
in
particular
SCFA,
appear
to
link
gut
and
bone
homeostasis.
There are only few studies yet having addressed the role of the
gut microbiota on bone homeostasis studying GF, antibiotic-
treated or mono-colonized mice and reporting contradictory
findings10–15,39. These discrepancies may be explained by differ-
ent microbial reconstitution, exposure time, concentrations of
nutritional supplements, and mice strains used for the experi-
ments. Earlier reports discussed the possibility that SCFA might
be responsible for the observed beneficial effects on bone after
consumption of fiber-rich diets (inulin-type fructans40 and

 galactooligosaccharides41). Here we used three independent
experimental approaches (direct supplementation of SCFA, HFD,
and bacterial transfer) and found consistent beneficial effects on
steady state, postmenopausal, and inflammatory bone metabolism
highly correlated to increased SCFA levels.
Used concentrations in the in vitro experiments proved to be
physiological as they were in the range of the increased SCFA
concentrations in the serum and bone marrow samples after direct
supplementation of SCFA or HFD feeding. Interestingly, steady-
state SCFA concentrations in the bone marrow were higher than
the lowest dilution used in our in vitro osteoclast suppression assays
pointing toward a potential persistent suppressive capacity of SCFA
during steady-state conditions. But this clearly needs to be further
evaluated
as
our
in
vitro
assays
certainly
neglect
the
complex situation found in the bone marrow niche with its mul-
titude of factors impacting on the osteoclast differentiation. This is
why we argue here that the balance between pro-osteoclastic and
antiosteoclastic factors need to be taken into account. The mere
steady-state concentrations are not that revealing, but what makes
the difference is the increase over the steady-state concentrations.
In consequence, therapeutic supplementation of SCFA or diets
increasing the endogenous production of SCFA may provide a
powerful instrument to balance osteoclast activity and inhibit
bone resorption. Even more importantly, in case of inflammatory
bone loss the combination of anti-inflammatory immune-reg-
ulatory properties of SCFA together with the direct inhibition of
osteoclast activity may be particularly useful. In this context, the
benefits of the so-called Mediterranean-type diets, which are rich
in fibers causing elevated levels of SCFA42 in managing human
inflammatory arthritis, may be explained.
Methods
Mice and treatments. For all experiments, exept the OVX model, 8-week-old
female mice were used unless stated otherwise. Five-to-six-week-old WT C57BL/6
and DBA/1J female mice (Charles River) were acclimated for 1 week, followed by a
2-week co-housing period before the experiments started. WT C57BL/6J used in
the commensal transfer experiments were inbred WT C57BL/6N mice from the
Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany as indicated in
the respective methods section. GPR41/43 double KO mice were kindly provided
by Professor Stefan Offermanns (Max-Planck Institute, Bad Nauheim, Germany)
and Dr. Tobias Junt (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) provided the
GPR41 and GPR43 single KO mice. All mice were maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions at the Präklinisches Experimentelles Tierzentrum (PETZ)
Erlangen, Germany and approved by the local ethics authorities of the Regierung of
Unterfranken (#55.2-2532-2-424). Supplementation of SCFA (all Sigma Aldrich,
Germany) was done in the drinking water at a final concentration of 150 mM and
changed every 3 days; control mice received pH and sodium-matched water.
Specially adjusted fiber-rich diet (Supplementary Table 1) and control diet were
purchased from Ssniff (Ssniff Spezialdiäten GmbH; Germany) and were provided
ad libitum starting 2 weeks before the experiment and throughout the study.
Bacteria growth and mice colonization. Three novel Prevotella species (Prevotella
nov. P1, Prevotella nov. P2 and Prevotella nov. P3), Bacteroides sartorii, and
Muribaculum sp. nov. have been isolated from the intestinal content of mice (data
unpublished). All isolates were cultured anaerobically in Brain Heart Infusion
broth, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 g/l vitamin K, for 48 h at
37 °C. WT C57BL/6N mice devoid of Prevotella spp., Bacteroides sartorii, or
Muribaculum sp. nov. in their intestinal microbiota were bred and maintained in a
specific-pathogen-free facility at Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research. For
colonization experiments, 6–7-week-old female mice were colonized with one of
each isolates via oral gavage. After 6–8 weeks, cecum content and serum samples
were collected and stored at −80 °C until processing. Tibia and femurs were fixed in
4% formalin for 24 h and stored in 70% ethanol.

 rRNA gene sequencing, DNA was extracted according to established protocols
using a method combining mechanical disruption (bead-beating) and phenol/
chloroform-based purification43. Briefly, sample was suspended in a solution
containing 500 µl of extraction buffer (200 mM Tris, 20 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl,
pH 8.0), 200 µl of 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 500 µl of phenol:chloroform:
isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1), and 100 µl of 0.1 mm zirconia/silica. Samples were
homogenized twice with a bead beater (BioSpec) for 2 min. After precipitation of
DNA, crude DNA extracts were resuspended in TE Buffer with 100 µg/ml RNase
and column purified to remove PCR inhibitors (BioBasic). Amplification of the V4
region (F515/R806) of the 16S rRNA gene was done44. Samples were sequenced on
an Illuminia MiSeq platform (PE250). Sequence assembly, quality control, and
clustering were performed using the usearch8.1 software package (http://www.
drive5.com/usearch/). Reads were clustered into 97% ID operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) using UPARSE algorithm45 followed by taxonomy assignment using
the Silva database v12846 and the RDP Classifier47 with a bootstrap confidence
cutoff of 80%. The OTU absolute abundance table and mapping file were used for

 statistical analyses and data visualization in the R statistical programming envir-
onment package phyloseq48.
ELISA. CTX-I (IDS Immunodiagnostic Systems GmbH, Germany), OCN (Alfa
Aesar, Germany) and undercarboxylated OCN (BlueGene, Japan) serum levels
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Multiplex. IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFNγ, TGFβ, and TNFα serum levels were measured
by Multiplex using a LEGENDplex Multi-Analyte Flow Assay Kit (BioLegend),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Histology. Tibial bones were fixed in 4% formalin for 24 h and decalcified in
EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). Serial paraffin sections (2 μm) were stained for tartrate
resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using a Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase Kit
(Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Osteoclast numbers were
quantified using a microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a digital camera and an
image analysis system for performing histomorphometry (Osteomeasure; Osteo-
Metrics). For Calcein labeling, mice were injected with 30 mg/kg body weight of
green fluorescent Calcein (Sigma) 11 and 4 days before sacrifice. Undecalcified
bones were embedded in methacrylate and 5 mm sections were cut. Unstained
sections were used to measure fluorescent Calcein-labeled bone surfaces at a
wavelength of 495 nm. Toluidine Blue staining was performed for quantification of
osteoblasts and von Kossa staining for bone mineralization.
Micro-computed tomography. µCT imaging was performed using the cone-beam
Desktop Micro Computer Tomograph “µCT 40” by SCANCO Medical AG,
Bruettisellen, Switzerland. The settings were optimized for calcified tissue visuali-
zation at 55 kVp with a current of 145 µA and 200 ms integration time for 500
projections/180°. For the segmentation of 3D-volumes, an isotropic voxel size of
8.4 µm and an evaluation script with adjusted grayscale thresholds of the operating
system “Open VMS” by SCANCO Medical was used. Volume of interest tibia: The
analysis of the bone structure was performed in the proximal metaphysis of the
tibia, starting 0.43 mm from an anatomic landmark in the growth plate and
extending 1.720 mm (200 tomograms) distally.
Collagen-induced arthritis. CIA was induced in 8-week-old female C57BL/6J or
DBA/1J mice by subcutaneous injection at the base of the tail with 100 μl with
0.25 mg chicken type II collagen (Chondrex, Redmond, WA) in complete Freund
adjuvant (Difco Laboratory, Detroit, MI), containing 5 mg/ml killed Mycobacter-
ium tuberculosis (H37Ra). Mice were rechallenged after 21 days intradermal
immunization in the base of the tail with this emulsion. The paws were evaluated
for joint swelling and grip strength three times per week. Each paw was individually
scored using a 4-point scale: 0, normal paw; 1, minimal swelling or redness; 2,
redness and swelling involving the entire forepaw; 3, redness and swelling involving
the entire limp; 4, joint deformity or ankylosis or both. In addition, grip strength of
each paw was analyzed on a wire 3 mm in diameter, using a score from 0 to −4 (0,
normal grip strength; −1, mildly reduced grip strength; −2, moderately reduced
grip strength; −3, severely reduced grip strength; −4, no grip strength at all).
K/BxN serum-induced model. K/BxN SIA was induced by intraperitoneal
injection of 200 μl pooled K/BxN serum. The swelling of fore and hind paws were
measured three times per week. Development of arthritis was evaluated for each
paw using a semiquantitative scoring system (0–4 per paw; maximum score of 16).
Postmenopausal bone loss model. At 6 weeks of age, mice were either sham-
operated or ovariectomized. Surgically removed ovaries were examined histologi-
cally to verify successful ovariectomy. Mice were kept in identical housing condi-
tions controlling for the same environment, food, light, and temperature for
8–10 weeks. Then tibial bones was excised and subjected to histological assessment
or μCT imaging.
Isolation and culture of osteoclast precursors. Bone marrow was isolated from
8-week-old C57BL/6J mice by flushing femoral bones with complete media. Bone
marrow cells were plated in 96-well flat bottom plates (2 × 105/well) in aMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 30 ng/ml macrophages colony-stimulating
factor, and 50 ng/ml RANKL (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany).
Alternatively, osteoclast precursors were isolated from bone marrow-derived cell
suspensions using CD11b microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The purity of isolated precursors was assessed by flow
cytometric analysis using CD11b-FITC–labeled antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec).
CD11b+ monocytes were plated in 96-well flat bottom plates (2 × 105/well).
Medium was changed after 72 h. Osteoclast differentiation was evaluated by
staining fixed cells for TRAP using a Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase Kit (Sigma-
Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Bone resorption assays were made using an Osteo Assay Surface 96 Well (Corn-
ing), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
SCFA measurements. Four to five replicates of frozen cecal samples (100 mg) or
50 µl of serum were weighed into a 2 ml polypropylene tube. The tubes were kept in
a cool rack throughout the extraction. 33% HCl (50 µl for cecal contents or 5 µl for
serum) was added and samples were vortexed for 1 min. One milliliter of diethyl
ether was added, vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged for 3 min at 4 °C. The organic
phase was transferred into a 2 ml gas chromatography (GC) vial. For the calibra-
tion curve, 100 μl of SCFA calibration standards (Sigma) were dissolved in water to
concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mM and then subjected to the same extraction
procedure as the samples. For GC mass spectrometric (GCMS) analysis, 1 μl of the
sample (4–5 replicates) was injected with a split ratio of 20:1 on a Famewax,
30 m × 0.25 mm iD, 0.25 μm df capillary column (Restek, Bad Homburg). The GC-
MS system consisted of GCMS QP2010Plus gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
coupled with an AOC20S autosampler and an AOC20i auto injector (Shimadzu,
Kyoto, Japan). Injection temperature was 240 °C with the interface set at 230 °C
and the ion source at 200 °C. Helium was used as carrier gas with constant flow rate
of 1 ml/min. The column temperature program started with 40 °C and was ramped
to 150 °C at a rate of 7 °C/min and then to 230 °C at a rate of 9 °C/min and finally
held at 230 °C for 9 min. The total run time was 40 min. SCFA were identified
based on the retention time of standard compounds and with the assistance of the
NIST 08 mass spectral library. Full-scan mass spectra were recorded in the 25–150
m/z range (0.5 s/scan). Quantification was done by integration of the extracted ion
chromatogram peaks for the following ion species: m/z 45 for acetate eluted at
7.8 min, m/z 74 for propionate eluted at 9.6 min, and m/z 60 for butyrate eluted at
11.5 min. GCMS solution software was used for data processing.
Real-time PCR. Tissues were stored in RnaLater (Ambion) or directly transferred
to TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Gene expression results are expressed as arbitrary units relative to
expression of the house keeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). Primer sequences are as follows: TRAF6: 5′-AAAGCGAGA-
GATTCTTTCCCTG-3′ and 5′-ACTGGGGACAATTCACTAGAGC-3′; NFATc1:

Western blotting. Cultured cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline and subsequently lysed. Protein extracts were separated on 10% SDS-
polyacrylamide gel, transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane, and stained with
antibodies against TRAF6 (D-10, Santa Cruz, dilution 1:500), NFATc1 (7A6, Santa
Cruz, dilution 1:500), pAMK (40H9, CellSignal, dilution 1:1000), and AMPK (34.2,

in supplementary information (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
Extracellular flux assays. Bioenergetics of osteoclast precursors were determined
using the XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience/Agilent Tech-
nologies, North Billerica, MA). Cells were seeded in specialized cell culture
microplates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and cultured for 24 and 48 h. One day
prior to the measurement, a Seahorse XFe96 cartridge (Agilent/Seahorse
Bioscience) was loaded with 200 µl XF Calibrant solution (Agilent/Seahorse
Bioscience) per well and incubated overnight in a CO2-free atmosphere. One hour
before the measurement, cells were incubated at 37 °C also in a CO2-free atmo-
sphere. The ports of the Seahorse cartridge were loaded with glucose, oligomycin,
and 2DG for the glycolysis stress test and oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin A/
rotenone for the mitochondrial stress test. After sensor calibration assays were run
as detailed in the manufacturer’s manual recording extracellular acidification rate
and oxygen consumption rate over time. Metabolic parameters were derived from
the XF Wave software (Agilent/Seahorse Biosciences) and calculated with Micro-
soft Excel. All experiments were performed in pentaplicates. Raw values were
normalized to the total protein content for each well.
Flow cytometry. Spleens were smashed and filtered through a 40 μm gauze (BD
Biosciences). Single-cell suspensions were stained for flow cytometry with the
following antibodies and analyzed according to the gating strategy shown in
(Supplementary Fig. 5b): CD4 Pacific blue (clone GK1.5, Biolegend, dilution 1:800),
CD25 PE-cy7 (clone PC61, Biolegend, dilution 1:400), and FoxP3 AlexaFluor647
(clone MF-14, Biolegend, dilution 1:300) were used in combination with a
FoxP3 staining kit (eBioscience).
Effects of propionate on bone metabolism in humans. Healthy individuals (n =
7) received a daily oral supplementation of 1 mg/day proprionate (Propicum,
Flexopharm Brain, Germany) for a period of 14 days. All analyses of human
material were performed in full agreement with institutional guidelines and with
the approval of the Ethical committee of the University Hospital Erlangen (permit
# 148_16B). Informed consent and permission to use the obtained data for research
were obtained from all subjects. Serum was taken at baseline and after 14 days and
analyzed for C-terminal collagen type I cleavage products (CTX-1) as marker for
bone resorption and OCN as marker for bone formation by ELISA.
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± s.d unless otherwise indicated
in the figure legends. All relevant data are available from the authors. Analysis was
performed using Student’s t-test, single comparison, or analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test for multiple comparisons (one-way or two-way ANOVA followed
by Tukey’s or Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test, respectively). All experi-
ments were conducted at least two times. P-values of 0.05 were considered sig-
nificant and are shown as p<0.05 (*), p<0.01 (**), or p<0.001 (***). Graph
generation and statistical analyses were performed using the Prism version 4c
software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).
Data availability. All relevant data are available from the authors upon reasonable
request. 16S RNA sequencing data are deposited in publicly accessible database and
available under the following accession code: PRJNA419741.
