In Brief
Huang et al. show that the onset of
hyperlipidemia in mice caused by tumor-
enhanced VLDL production and tumor-
impaired VLDL/LDL turnover can be
attenuated by genetic ablation of Ces3/
TGH in mice, which results in diminished
tumor growth by a reduced supply of
cholesterol-rich lipoproteins to the tumor.

SUMMARY
The known link between obesity and cancer sug-
gests an important interaction between the host lipid
metabolism and tumorigenesis. Here, we used a
syngeneic tumor graft model to demonstrate that
tumor development influences the host lipid meta-
bolism. BCR-Abl-transformed precursor B cell tu-
mors induced hyperlipidemia by stimulating very
low-density
lipoprotein
(VLDL)
production
and
blunting VLDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
turnover. To assess whether tumor progression
was dependent on tumor-induced hyperlipidemia,
we utilized the VLDL production-deficient mouse
model, carboxylesterase3/triacylglycerol hydrolase
(Ces3/TGH) knockout mice. In Ces3/Tgh�/� tumor-
bearing mice, plasma triglyceride and cholesterol
levels were attenuated. Importantly tumor weight
was reduced in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice. Mechanistically,
reduced tumor growth in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice was
attributed to reversal of tumor-induced PCSK9-
mediated degradation of hepatic LDLR and decrease
of LDL turnover. Our data demonstrate that tumor-
induced hyperlipidemia encompasses a feed-for-
ward
loop
that
reprograms
hepatic
lipoprotein
homeostasis in part by providing LDL cholesterol to
support tumor growth.
INTRODUCTION
Dyslipidemia is tightly linked to obesity and is characterized by
high levels of triacylglycerol (TG) and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) as well as low levels of high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the bloodstream. Dyslipidimia is also
associated with increased human cancer mortality (Calle et al.,
2003). This has been functionally validated in experimental
models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) that showed poor cancer
outcomes (Alikhani et al., 2013; Zhuang et al., 2005). Weight
loss intervention has been suggested as an effective cancer pre-
vention strategy and is supported by reductions in cancer inci-
dence and mortality of patients who have had bariatric surgery
and dramatic weight loss (Sjo
¨ stro
¨ m et al., 2009). However,
whether nonsurgical weight loss interventions achieved by calo-
rie restriction, behavioral therapy, and/or pharmacotherapy
could also have a beneficial impact on cancer incidence is still
unclear. Mechanistic investigations into this relationship have
analyzed the potential roles of insulin, insulin-like growth factors
(IGFs), sex hormones, and adipokines (e.g., leptin, tumor necro-
sis factor alpha [TNF-a], and adiponectin). Plasma concentra-
tions of these are often abnormal in obesity (Al-Zoughbi et al.,
2014). Onset of insulin resistance and chronic inflammation re-
sulting from excess lipid supply and adipose expansion can
distort the normal balance between cell proliferation and differ-
entiation
and
apoptosis,
which
eventually
contribute
to
obesity-induced cancer incidence (Bianchini et al., 2002).
However, the precise cellular mechanisms that link obesity
with cancer incidence, recurrence, progression and death
remain largely unexplored. Furthermore, whether dyslipidemia
in normal-weight subjects is correlated to tumor incidence is
unknown.
Rapidly
proliferating
tumor
cells
generally
require
high
amounts of fatty acids (FAs) and cholesterol. Numerous studies
have confirmed hyperactivation of de novo lipogenesis in various
types of neoplasia. Targeting lipogenesis by inhibiting fatty acid
synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), ATP-cit-
rate lyase (ACLY) or sterol regulatory element-binding protein-
1 (SREBP1) was effective in tumor suppression (Currie et al.,
2013). Cancer cells can also rapidly convert exogenous FAs to
lipids
required
for
proliferation
and
pro-tumorigenic
lipid
signaling (Arana et al., 2010; Louie et al., 2013). Multiple studies
have also demonstrated elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
receptor (LDLR) expression and LDL uptake in a wide range of
tumors, including glioblastoma (Guo et al., 2011), leukemia (Vi-
tols et al., 1990), pancreatic tumors (Guillaumond et al., 2015),
and lung cancer (Vitols et al., 1992). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL),
which hydrolyzes TG within chylomicrons (CM) and very low-
density lipoprotein (VLDL), was found to be critical for cancer

 cells to acquire FA from culture medium (Kuemmerle et al.,
2011).
To elucidate a potential role of VLDL-derived lipids in tumori-
genesis in vivo, we studied tumor growth in a mouse model
with attenuated VLDL production: carboxylesterase 3/triacylgly-
cerol hydrolase (Ces3/TGH) deficient (�/�) mice. Ces3/TGH (an-
notated as carboxylesterase 1 [CES1] in humans) promotes
VLDL assembly and secretion (Dolinsky et al., 2004a, 2004b).
Mice lacking Ces3/TGH display reduced ApoB and TG in plasma
when fed chow or Western-type diets (Lian et al., 2012a, 2012b;
Wei et al., 2010).
In this study, we explored (1) whether BCR-Abl-transformed B
cell tumors modulate lipoprotein homeostasis and (2) how insuf-
ficient supply of circulating lipids influenced tumor growth in
mice. We demonstrate that Ces3/Tgh�/� mice are resistant to tu-
mor-induced downregulation of LDLR in liver, tumor-induced
hyperlipidemia and, consequently, have significantly reduced tu-
mor growth.
RESULTS
Lipoproteins Are Essential for Growth and Survival of
Transformed B Cells In Vitro
To investigate whether tumor cell growth depends on exogenous
lipid supply, we used tumorigenic, rapidly proliferating BCR-Abl-
transformed precursor B cells (TPBCs) as a tumor model (Huang
et al., 2013). Incubation of cells in medium containing lipopro-
tein-deficient serum (LPDS) resulted in significant growth inhibi-
tion and increased cell death. Supplementation of LPDS with
VLDL, LDL, or HDL partially restored the rapid growth rate of
TPBCs (Figures 1A and 1B) and prevented cell death in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure S1A). Protection against lipid-
depletion-induced cell death was achieved when tumor cells
were supplied with acetylated LDL, which requires scavenger
receptors, but not LDLR, for internalization (Figure S1B). Impor-
tantly, cholesterol addition alone was able to restore cell prolif-
eration and alleviate cell death (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A). The
increased apoptotic rate confirmed that severe cell damage
occurred upon lipid withdrawal, which could be reversed by
re-supplying lipoproteins or cholesterol. To further confirm the
role of cholesterol in tumor cell growth, we used three pharmaco-
logical approaches (Figure 1D) to prevent its utilization by tumor
cells (Figure 1C): (1) depletion of cell membrane cholesterol by
cyclodextrin (HPCD), (2) inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and
intake by blockage of the SREBP pathway using fatostatin,
and (3) abolishment of lysosomal hydrolysis of endocytosed
VLDL remnant/LDL cholesteryl esters (CEs) by NH4Cl. All condi-
tions significantly suppressed TPBC growth (Figures 1E–1G).
To investigate the mechanism by which tumor cells take up
lipids from lipoproteins, we examined quantitative transcriptional
expression of genes involved in TG hydrolysis and lipid transport.
Interestingly, mRNA expression of Ldlr was 50-fold higher than
VLDL receptor (Vldlr) (Figure 1H). Ldlrap1, which encodes a pro-
tein that is involved in internalization of LDL-bound LDLR, was
also substantially expressed. This finding suggests that LDLR
might play a major role in facilitating lipoprotein uptake by tumors
(schematic depiction in Figure 1D). Lipoprotein-receptor-related
proteins and scavenger receptors might also play a role in lipo-
protein uptake. Thus, we determined mRNA expression of
important candidates and found Lrp10 to be highly expressed
(Figure S1C). LRP10 is reportedly involved in ApoE-containing li-
poprotein uptake, whereas SR-B1 facilitates HDL uptake.
Regarding FA uptake, we found Fabp5 and Slc27a4 mRNA to
be highly abundant in tumors. Indeed, supplementation of
LPDS with oleate increased
growth of TPBCs in LPDS
(Figure S1D). Thus, TPBC-dependence on lipoproteins was
associated with elevated expression of genes involved in LDL
internalization, ApoE-specific lipoprotein uptake, and FA uptake.
Because it has been reported that LDLR is overexpressed in
several types of tumor, we were particularly interested to inves-
tigate the potential regulatory mechanism of LDLR expression in
cancer. In healthy cells, Ldlr mRNA expression is under the con-
trol of SREBPs. Here, we analyzed expression correlation based
on mRNA profiles obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas Proj-
ect (TCGA). We found that Ldlr mRNA levels are significantly
correlated to Srebp1 and 2 as well as their target genes in a
wide range of human cancer types, including diffuse large B
cell lymphoma (Table S1). These correlations imply that Ldlr is
transcriptionally regulated by both SREBPs and might share
similar expression patterns with other SREBPs target genes in
cancers.
TPBC Tumor Grafts Induce Hyperlipidemia by
Increasing VLDL Production and Decreasing CM/VLDL
Turnover
We next investigated whether tumor tissue altered lipid homeo-
stasis in C57BL6 mice injected with TPBC cells in the subcutane-
ous flank. Elevated plasma TG and TC concentrations and corre-
spondingly increased VLDL and LDL levels were detected in
tumor-bearing versus control WT mice (Figures 2A and S2A).
To specifically investigate the mechanism of enhanced VLDL
production, we repeated the experiment in Ldlr�/� mice, a hyper-
lipidemic mouse model deficient in LDL clearance. An even more
pronounced increase of VLDL and LDL was observed in these tu-
mor-bearing mice, suggesting that upregulation of VLDL pro-
duction was responsible for the increase in VLDL and LDL levels
(Figures 2A and S2A). Fasting plasma non-esterified FA (NEFA)
concentrations, representing adipose tissue TG catabolism
and FA supply for hepatic VLDL assembly, were similar in tu-
mor-bearing and control mice (Figure S2B), suggesting mecha-
nism other than substrate availability. We therefore investigated
the possible mechanisms for tumor-directed increased levels of
circulating VLDL by examining VLDL synthesis in the liver. In the
tumor-bearing group, however, hepatic TG and free cholesterol

 (FC) levels were decreased by 49.5% (Figure 2B) and 34.3%
(Figure S2C), respectively. Correspondingly, the number of cyto-
solic lipid droplets in hepatocytes was also reduced in the tumor-
bearing group (Figure 2C). Hepatic microsomal triglyceride
transfer protein (Mttp), ApoB, and ApoE were similar between
the tumor- and non-tumor-bearing groups (Figure S2D). These
results indicated that tumor growth stimulated VLDL secretion.
Because augmented hepatic de novo lipogenesis increases
VLDL secretion we investigated whether lipogenesis might be
affected by the tumor. Primary hepatocytes isolated from tu-
mor-bearing mice incorporated 2.4-fold and 1.8-fold more [3H]
acetate into FC and CEs, respectively (Figure 2D) and 1.3-fold
more [3H] oleate into TG (Figure 2E). The excess supply of intra-
cellular cholesterol resulted in 3.0-fold increased esterification
of [3H] oleate into CE in hepatocytes from tumor-bearing mice
(Figure 2E). Moreover, reduced intracellular labeling in de novo

synthesized FA suggests enhanced FA
channeling into CE and TG in livers of tu-
mor-bearing mice (Figures 2D and 2E). The
increased intracellular TG and cholesterol
pool may support increased secretion of
lipids
in
ApoB-containing
lipoproteins.
However, the observed enhanced secretion
of TG was normalized after withdrawal of
exogenous FA (Figure 2F), suggesting that
the tumor enhances secretion of newly syn-
thesized rather than preformed TG. Acid
soluble metabolites (ASMs) derived from
[3H] oleate via FA oxidation were decreased
in the tumor-bearing group (Figure S2E), which could provide an
alternative FA source for TG and CE synthesis.
Next, we performed a fat tolerance test (FTT), which revealed
that tumor-bearing mice accumulated 1.9-fold more CM-TG in
plasma (Figure 2G), indicating impaired turnover of TG-rich lipo-
proteins by the tumor. Interestingly, comparable amounts of
radioactivity were found in tumor and white adipose tissue
(WAT) (Figure S2F), suggesting rapid and substantial lipoprotein
lipase (LPL)-mediated uptake of CM-derived lipids by the tumor
in mice with increased availability of circulating CM due to
impaired TG turnover.
TPBC Tumors Decrease Hepatic LDLR Protein
Expression, but Not Its Transcription
Hepatic LDLR protein abundance inversely correlates with
plasma LDL concentrations. The amount of hepatic LDLR was
Cell Reports 15, 336–348, April 12, 2016
339
 significantly reduced in non-fasted tumor-bearing mice (Fig-
ure 3A), explaining in part the elevated LDL levels in these ani-
mals. To investigate the mechanism of this difference in LDLR
abundance, we examined the transcriptional expression and
processing of the upstream regulators SREBP1 and 2 between
control and tumor-bearing mice. In non-fasted mice, along with
decreased LDLR protein expression (�64.7%), the precursor
and mature SREBP1 were reduced by 49.1% and 53.8%,
respectively, whereas the SREBP2 precursor was unaffected
(Figure 3A). mRNA expression of Fbxw7, which catalyzes the
ubiquitination of ER-localized SREBPs and promotes their sub-
sequent degradation, was upregulated in tumor-bearing mice,
whereas mRNA expression of Insig2, Scap, and Mbtps1 encod-
ing proteins involved in SREBP processing was unchanged (Fig-
ure 3B). Unexpectedly, except for mRNA expression of Pcsk9,
which encodes a protein that is mainly synthesized and secreted
from liver and induces degradation of hepatic LDLR, expression
of other SREBP target genes, including Ldlr, was unchanged in
tumor-bearing mice (Figure 3C). In concert, protein levels of
FASN, acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase (ACC) 1
and 2, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA reductase (HMGCR)
were also unaltered (Figure 3D). The comparatively low levels of
LDLR in tumor-bearing mice persisted even during overnight
fasting (�59.1%; Figure 3E) and after refeeding (�41.5%; Fig-
ure 3F), regardless of the reported absence of mature SREBPs
during fasting (Horton et al., 1998). Further analyses of mRNA
expression resulted in expected pattern of expression of
SREBPs target genes except for Pcsk9 during fasting and
refeeding (Figure 3G). Accordingly, plasma PCSK9 concentra-
tions
were
dramatically
elevated
in
tumor-bearing
mice
(Figures 3H and 3I). These results suggest that the downregu-
lation of LDLR protein levels in TPBC tumor-bearing mice is in-
dependent of SREBP signaling but dependent on PCSK9. In
addition,
we
detected
similar
concentrations
of
plasma
PCSK9 in mice bearing lung carcinoma LLC (21 days) as those
in mice bearing TPBCs (14 days) (Figure 3H), which were asso-
ciated with a marked elevation of plasma VLDL, LDL (Figures
3J and S3A), and TC (Figure S3B) in LLC mice. In contrast,
the increase in plasma PCSK9 concentration was moderate
in mice bearing melanoma B16 (17 days) (Figure 3I) and was
accompanied by only a marginal increase of LDL, HDL (Figures
3K and S3C), and TC (Figure S3D). Interestingly, expression of
hepatic Pcsk9 and other SREBP target genes was downregu-
lated in both LLC and melanoma B16 groups (Figure S3E),
although
hepatic
LDLR
protein
remained
unchanged
(Figure S3F).
Unaltered Insulin Sensitivity in TPBC Tumor-Induced
Hyperlipidemia
Dyslipidemia is often associated with chronic inflammation and
insulin resistance (IR), which has been proposed as a mecha-
nistic link between cancer and obesity. Thus, we studied
whether TPBC tumor-induced hyperlipidemia could also induce
IR in our experimental model by measuring insulin sensitivity in
liver and skeletal muscle. Basal AKT phosphorylation in livers
of tumor-bearing mice was higher, whereas insulin-stimulated
AKT activation was comparable to control mice (Figure 4A).
Basal and stimulated AKT phosphorylation in muscle was un-
changed (Figure 4A). In line with similar insulin sensitivity be-
tween the two models, an oral glucose tolerant test (OGTT)
and insulin tolerant test (ITT) also revealed no changes between
tumor-bearing and control mice (Figures 4B and 4C). Indeed, the
tumorigenic cytokine IGF-1, the bioactivity of which is increased
during IR, failed to stimulate TPBC growth in vitro (Figure S4A).
Interestingly, blood glucose levels after overnight fasting and in
non-fasted conditions were significantly lower in tumor-bearing
mice (Figure S4B), which could be due to accelerated glucose
uptake by the tumor, but not to improved global insulin
sensitivity.
Attenuated TPBC Tumor-Induced Hyperlipidemia and
Tumor Growth in Ces3/Tgh�/� Mice
We hypothesized that TPBC tumor-induced hyperlipidemia
might provide excess amounts of cholesterol to stimulate tumor
cell growth. Therefore, we utilized the genetic hypolipidemic
mouse model—Ces3/TGH knockout mice (Ces3/Tgh�/�)—to
determine whether attenuated VLDL secretion could reverse
tumor-induced
hyperlipidemia
and
consequently
suppress
tumor growth. While food intake is similar in wild-type (WT)
and Ces3/Tgh�/� mice (Figure S5A), plasma TG concentrations
were decreased by 34.6% in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice (Figure 5A),
with concomitantly significantly reduced plasma ApoB100 (Fig-
ure 5C), a marker of VLDL and LDL. In tumor-bearing Ces3/
Tgh�/� mice, plasma TG levels remained reduced by 32.4%
(Figure 5A) and cholesterol was lower in VLDL and LDL frac-
tions (Figure 5B, right: FPLC), while plasma total cholesterol
(TC) concentrations were lower by 15% (Figure 5B) in Ces3/
Tgh�/� compared to WT, mice regardless of augmented
HDL-C. Plasma NEFA concentrations were reduced in Ces3/
Tgh�/� mice, but not in tumor-bearing Ces3/Tgh�/� mice (Fig-
ure S5B). The abundance of ApoB100 was profoundly lower in
tumor-bearing Ces3/Tgh�/� mice compared to tumor-bearing
WT mice (Figure 5C). Interestingly, tumor volume at 13 to
14 days post-inoculation and tumor weight 14 days after inoc-
ulation were reduced by 45.5% and 35.7% in Ces3/Tgh�/�
mice, respectively (Figures 5D and 5E). Similarly, carcass
body weight gain was also reduced in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice (Fig-
ure S5C). Attenuation of tumor-induced hyperlipidemia conse-
quently caused a reduction in tumor TG (74.1%), FC (23%),
and CE (22.9%) and a trend toward decreased tumor NEFA
concentrations (62.5%, p = 0.28) in Ces3/Tgh�/� versus WT
mice (Figures 5F–5H). Protein abundance of FASN and HMGCR
were unchanged in tumors of Ces3/Tgh�/� mice. Increased
expression of LDLR in tumors of Ces3/Tgh�/� mice, however,
might at least in part compensate for the reduced availability
of cholesterol (Figure 5I).
Consistent with enhanced TG secretion from primary hepato-
cytes of tumor-bearing mice (Figures 2E and 2F), VLDL secretion
(determined at day 14) was significantly increased in tumor-
bearing versus control WT mice (Figure 5J). Interestingly,
Ces3/TGH deficiency attenuated VLDL production in control
mice, but not in tumor-bearing mice (at least in the late stage
of the experimental period; Figure 5J). Similar to WT mice, pro-
tein levels of Mttp were also unchanged in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice
(Figure S5D). TG lipase (LPL plus hepatic lipase) activities were
examined in post-heparin plasma (PHP) to assess the impact

 of tumors on peripheral VLDL clearance. In agreement with the
FTT (Figure 2H), PHP TG lipase activities were significantly
reduced in tumor-bearing WT mice (Figure 5K). A similar reduc-
tion conferred by tumor was also observed in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice
(Figure 5K).
Restored Hepatic LDLR in Ces3/Tgh�/� Mice via
Attenuation of PCSK9 Activation
Despite TPBC tumor-induced reduction of hepatic LDLR pro-
tein expression in both WT and Ces3/Tgh�/� mice, LDLR
abundance was higher in tumor-bearing Ces3/Tgh�/� mice
than in tumor-bearing WT mice (Figure 6A) and was indepen-
dent of Ldlr transcription (Figure S6A). We therefore investi-
gated the mechanism whereby Ces3/TGH deficiency results
in
augmented
LDLR
levels.
In
both
genotypes,
tumors
increased plasma concentrations of PCSK9 (Figure 6B). How-
ever, plasma PCSK9 levels were significantly lower in Ces3/
Tgh�/� mice than WT mice in both tumor-bearing and non-tu-
mor conditions (Figure 6B). Concomitantly, we observed a
positive
correlation
between
tumor
weight
and
plasma
PCSK9 levels in WT mice, but not in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice
(Figure 6C). Hepatic Pcsk9 mRNA expression was increased
in tumor-bearing WT mice but unaltered in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice
(Figure 6D). Expression of mRNA encoding hepatic nuclear
factor a (Hnf1a), which is responsible for mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-regulated transcriptional
activation of the Pcsk9 promoter (Ai et al., 2012), was
increased in tumor-bearing WT mice, but not in Ces3/Tgh�/�
mice when compared with their non-tumor counterparts (Fig-
ure 6E). Indeed, tumor burden tended to decline the phosphor-
ylation of ribosomal protein S6, which reflects the activity of
mTOCR1, in livers of fasted WT mice (Figure S6B) and
serum-starved
primary
hepatocytes
from
non-fasted
WT
mice (Figure S6C). The activity of mTORC1 can be suppressed
by cellular stress such as energy deprivation. Correspondingly,
phosphorylation of the energy sensor 50 AMP-activated protein
kinase a (AMPKa) in liver was increased by 1.4-fold in tumor-
bearing WT mice, whereas remained unchanged in tumor-
bearing Ces3/Tgh�/� mice compared to respective non-tumor
controls (Figure 6F). These data suggest that the activation of
HNF1a/PCSK9 is responsible for reduced LDLR content in
liver, which might be initiated by AMPK-mediated mTORC1 in-
hibition. However, the functional link between these factors
still requires further confirmation.
Livers of tumor-bearing mice had an increased abundance of
F4/80-positive macrophages (Kupffer cells) that was accompa-
nied by increased proliferation rates of hepatocytes as deter-
mined by Ki67 staining (Figure 6G). Tumor-mediated liver
enlargement was attenuated in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice (Figure 6H).
This was also reflected by loss of the positive correlation be-
tween tumor and liver weight present in WT mice (Figure 6I).
mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory markers (Tnfa, Mcp1,
F4/80, and Socs3) in livers was markedly increased in tumor-
bearing mice of both genotypes, whereas differences between
genotypes were not significant (Figure S6D). Inflammatory stim-
uli (e.g., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) induce Pcsk9 expression
and consequently LDLR degradation in mouse liver (Feingold
et al., 2008). However, treatment of the immortalized hepato-
cyte cell line AML-12 with recombinant TNF-a, interleukin-6
(IL-6), and LPS failed to mimic the mRNA pattern of an induced
PCSK9-LDLR axis and SREBPs in tumor-bearing mice (Fig-
ure S6E), suggesting an indirect inflammatory regulation of he-
patic LDL clearance. Collectively, Ces3/TGH deficiency could
alleviate tumor-induced liver enlargement, which might be
ascribed to reduction of PCSK9-mediated degradation of
LDLR.

 DISCUSSION
Metabolic reprogramming of lipid metabolism present in a wide
range of cancers plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of
human malignancies and cancer-associated cachexia. TG and
cholesterol are hydrophobic molecules and must be transported
in the circulation in lipoproteins. Aberrant lipoprotein profiles are
often observed in cancer patients. Low plasma levels of TC and
LDL-C, as well as high TG concentrations, are generally corre-
lated with a high risk for various types of hematological and solid
tumors (Fiorenza et al., 2000; Naik et al., 2006; Patel et al., 2004).
In contrast, elevated plasma TC, LDL-C, and TG levels were
observed in patients with breast cancer (Fiorenza et al., 2000).
Despite the proposed association of cancer with low LDL-C,
its bidirectional causalities with tumor development and the
mechanisms involved are poorly understood and need further
investigation. A Mendelian randomization study showed that
cancer risk in a population with spontaneous decrease of LDL-
C resulting from polymorphisms in PCSK9, ABCG8, and ApoE
is comparable with that in healthy subjects, suggesting that
lower plasma LDL-C concentrations per se do not cause cancer
(Benn et al., 2011). Notably, in prostate cancer, the reduction of
plasma TC levels in patients with metastatic disease compared
to non-metastatic patients and healthy men is associated with
increased catabolism of LDL (Henriksson et al., 1989). Given
that enriched circulating cholesterol provokes growth of breast
and prostate tumor in mice (Alikhani et al., 2013; Zhuang et al.,
2005), the reduction of plasma LDL-C in cancer is partially attrib-
utable to enhanced cholesterol uptake by tumors via LDLR.
LDLR expression and its transcriptional regulation in tumors
are largely unexplored. Here, based on human cancer data
from TCGA, we found a robust correlation between Ldlr and
Srebp1 mRNA as well as Srebp1-regulated lipogenic enzymes
for
which
pro-tumorigenic
activities
have
been
recently
described (Arana et al., 2010; Currie et al., 2013; Lewis et al.,
2015). This finding implies that LDLR and other lipogenic en-
zymes (e.g., SCD1 and FASN) play an important role in tumori-
genesis. In support, supplementation of cells with VLDL and
LDL reversed the pro-apoptotic effect conferred by LPDS. Sup-
ply of cholesterol alone could also stimulate cell proliferation.
The tumor-supportive property of cholesterol might be due to
its role in the maintenance of fluidity and permeability of the
plasma membrane. Additionally, cholesterol is a major compo-
nent of lipid rafts that have been reported to play a role in tumor
signaling through recruitment of signaling components and initi-
ation of distinct downstream signaling (Alikhani et al., 2013).
Our results suggest that tumor-induced increase in plasma
VLDL concentration is partially due to enhanced secretion. FAs
required for VLDL-TG synthesis during fasting are obtained
from WAT lipolysis. TPBC tumors may influence systemic lipid
mobilization through production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(e.g., TNF-a and IL-6; Huang et al., 2013). Elevated plasma
TNF-a can drive FA efflux from WAT through enhanced lipolysis
(Zhang et al., 2002). Despite unaltered de novo FA synthesis in
liver, a substantial flow of FAs from WAT together with reduced
hepatic FA oxidation likely ensures adequate provision of FAs
for VLDL assembly in tumor-bearing mice. The observed
accelerated esterification of extracellular FAs into TG and CE
determined by a metabolic labeling assay might contribute to tu-
mor-increased VLDL production.
Despite tumor-mediated attenuation of LPL activity, circu-
lating LDL-C levels were increased due to reduced hepatic
LDLR protein. Hepatic Ldlr expression is primarily regulated by
SREBP2 in a cholesterol-dependent manner (Horton et al.,
2003). In certain conditions, LDLR expression might also be un-
der the control of SREBP1 (Sekar and Veldhuis, 2004; Streicher
et al., 1996). In our TPBC model, hepatic SREBP1, but not 2,
was reduced in tumor-bearing WT mice. However, downregula-
tion of SREBP1 failed to downregulate Ldlr transcripts in mice,
suggesting a potential post-translational regulation of LDLR
independent of SREBP signaling.
Our study for the first time reports that B cell tumor dramati-
cally induced expression of hepatic PCSK9 resulting in elevated
plasma PCSK9 concentrations and reduced hepatic LDLR
protein abundance. The tissue specificity of LDLR protein regu-
lation by PCSK9 renders the liver the most responsive organ (Luo
et al., 2009), eliminating adverse effects on tumor LDLR-medi-
ated VLDL remnant/LDL uptake and thus suppressing tumor
growth. The Pcsk9 proximal promoter contains a binding site
for HNF1a, a liver-enriched transcription factor that cooperates
with SREBP2 in the basal transcription of PCSK9 (Li et al.,
2009). In agreement, increased Hnf1a expression was detected
in tumor-bearing WT mice. mTORC1-mediated repression of
HNF1a and PCSK9 was reported to be involved in the mainte-
nance of hepatic LDLR abundance (Ai et al., 2012). We observed
a trend toward decreased mTORC1 activity in tumor-bearing
WT mice. mTORC1 activity is negatively regulated by TSC1/2.
Stress such as hypoxia, DNA damage, and energy deprivation
activate TSC1/2 and thus repress mTORC1 signaling (Laplante
and Sabatini, 2012). In livers of tumor-bearing mice, proliferation
of hepatocytes together with suppression of FA oxidation
conceptually results in energy deficit leading to activation of
AMPK. AMPK was activated in tumor-bearing WT mice, sup-
porting the involvement of tumor-mediated AMPK-mTORC1-
HNF1a-PCSK9-LDLR signaling axis. Importantly, as a central
regulator of cellular homeostasis and growth mTOR responds
to various nutrients and stress. For instance, mTOR mediates
insulin regulation of lipid metabolism, whereas it also impinges
insulin sensitivity under various pathological conditions such
as inflammation (Kim et al., 2008). It remains to be determined
how these integrated networks converging on mTOR affect
HNF1a-regulated expression of PCSK9 and LDLR in liver
in distinct physiological and pathological settings. Hepatic
PCSK9 expression can also be regulated by PPARa-mediated

 repression of Pcsk9 promoter activity concomitantly with promo-
tion of PCSK9 degradation (Kourimate et al., 2008). Suppressed
PPARa signaling in TPBC tumor-bearing mice (Huang et al.,
2013) might also have an influence on PCSK9 levels.
Interestingly, although hepatic Pcsk9 expression was dimin-
ished in mice with LLC or B16 tumors, plasma PCSK9 concentra-
tions were higher than in non-tumor controls. Increased plasma
PCSK9 concentration might be due to binding of PCSK9 to
LDL, which prevents clearance of circulating PCSK9 and degra-
dation of LDLR (Kosenko et al., 2013). This might explain the
observed unaltered hepatic LDLR protein abundance together
with elevated concentrations of both PCSK9 and LDL in LLC
and, to a lesser extent, in B16 tumor-bearing mice. PCSK9 bind-
ing to LDLR occurs either at the cell surface or in the trans-Golgi,
leading to lysosomal degradation of both proteins (Lagace,
2014). The observed enhanced hepatic Pcsk9 expression in
TPBCs might contribute to LDLR reduction in liver, which is not
observed in LLC or B16 tumor-bearing mice.
To further explore the cross-talk between lipids in the circula-
tion and tumor progression, we investigated TPBC tumor asso-
ciated effects in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice, a genetic hypolipidemic
mouse model with attenuated VLDL secretion. Interestingly,
tumor-mediated increase in circulating ApoB-containing lipo-
proteins and tumor growth were reduced in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice.
Surprisingly, no attenuation of tumor-induced VLDL secretion
in mice was observed on day 14 post-tumor inoculation,
leading to the assumption that the attenuation of hyperlipidemia
observed in tumor-bearing Ces3/Tgh�/� mice might be due to
multiple mechanisms not solely to altered VLDL production.
Nevertheless, it is conceivable that reduced VLDL secretion
persists in the initial period of tumor growth, which might exert
an inhibitory effect on proliferation and survival of TPBCs.
In addition to enhanced VLDL production, CM and VLDL clear-
ance was blunted in tumor-bearing mice, which also explains
increased plasma TG levels. However, Ces3/TGH-deficient
mice present with upregulated LDL turnover due to reduced
plasma PCSK9 concentrations in both non-tumor and tumor
conditions compared to WT mice. In line with decreased
PCSK9 activation, the upstream regulators AMPK and HNF1a
were inactivated in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice. Consequently, hepatic
LDLR is preserved in tumor-bearing Ces3/Tgh�/�, but not WT
mice. The alleviation of tumor-induced liver enlargement in tu-
mor-bearing Ces3/Tgh�/� suggests that Ces3/TGH deficiency
might protect mice against tumor-triggered liver dysfunction
and consequently aberrant lipoprotein homeostasis.
In summary, we report that the decreased LPL-mediated hy-
drolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins together with enhanced VLDL
production results in hypertriglyceridemia in tumor-bearing
mice. In livers of tumor-bearing WT mice, PCSK9-mediated
degradation of LDLR protein is mainly augmented by activation
of hepatic PCSK9 and HNF1a, resulting in hypercholesterolemia.
Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia in WT mice
presumably provide tumors with essential exogenous lipids to
support proliferation and protect against apoptosis. Diminish-
ment of tumor-induced hyperlipidemia in Ces3/Tgh�/� mice
leads to tumor suppression (Figure 7). Our experimental
data confirm the existence of a tumor-associated positive
feedback loop linking tumor progression and aberrant lipopro-
tein homeostasis in mice and offer supporting evidence for the
importance of the ‘‘tumor macroenvironment’’ in the pathogen-
esis of cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cells
Bcr/Abl-transformed precursor B cells (TPBCs) were generated as previously
reported (Huang et al., 2013). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
containing 10% FBS (Life Technologies) in a 37�C incubator with 5% CO2.
Cell number and viability was determined using CASY cell counter (Scha
¨ rfe
System).
mRNA Expression Analysis and RNA Sequencing
Total RNA was extracted by Trizol (Life Technologies). cDNA was synthesized
from 2 mg total RNA by the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen)
using oligo (dT)12–18 primers. Real-time qPCR was performed with the
Figure 7. Schematic Model of Tumor Impact
on Lipoprotein Homeostasis
(A) In WT mice, inhibition of TG-rich lipoprotein
turnover in peripheral organs (e.g., WAT), together
with stimulation of VLDL secretion from liver,
contributes to TPBC tumor-increased plasma
VLDL. Enhanced PCSK9-mediated LDLR degra-
dation in liver causes insufficient LDL turnover and
results in the elevation of plasma LDL. Hyperlip-
idemia thereby provides adequate amount of
tumorigenic lipids, especially cholesterol, for tu-
mor progression.
(B) In Ces3/Tgh�/� mice, despite lack of prevention
against tumor-reduced VLDL/CM turnover and
tumor-enhanced VLDL secretion, hypotriglycer-
idemia induced by Ces3/TGH deficiency-reduced
VLDL production at the initial time, together with
improvement of hepatic LDL uptake due to
downregulation
of
hepatic
Pcsk9
expression,
leading to reduced lipoprotein supply and sup-
pression of tumor growth.

 Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen) in the Rotor-Gene
3000 instrument (Montreal Biotech). Primers used in this study are listed in Ta-
ble S2. Gene expression profile in TPBCs was determined by a quantitative
RNA-sequencing analysis on the Ion Torrent platform (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed using total or fractionated protein extracts
(subcellular fractionation described in Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures) or plasma and probed with antibodies listed above. Immunoreactivity
was detected by ECL (Amersham-Pharmacia) or SuperSignal West Dura
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) to enhance the signal. Immunoblots were scanned
and quantified using G-Box (Syngene).
Animals
All animal experiments were approved by the University of Alberta Animal Care
and Use Committee and were performed in accordance with the guidelines of
the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Mice were maintained on 12-hr light:-
dark cycles and fed a standard chow diet. All wild-type and Ces3/Tgh�/�
mice were of C57BL/6J genetic background. Twelve to 15 week-old male
mice were randomly divided into groups. TPBCs (200,000 per mouse), LLC
(2,000,000), and B16 (1,500,000) were injected subcutaneously into mice in
the flank. Control treatment mice received vehicle (PBS). Three dimensions
of tumors were measured by caliper, and tumor volume was estimated based
on the formula ‘‘1/2 3 length 3 width 3 height.’’ Non-fasting, fasting, and re-
feeding regimens were applied. ‘‘Non-fasting’’ indicates withdrawal of food
during daytime (8 a.m. to 1 p.m.) with minimal dietary stress to mice. ‘‘Fasting’’
denotes 16-hr overnight removal of food (6 p.m. to 10 a.m.). ‘‘Refeeding’’ indi-
cates overnight fasting plus food supply with chow diet for the following 12 hr.
Mice were sacrificed under anesthesia with isoflurane, and blood was
collected by retrobulbar bleeding.
PHP TG Lipase Activity Assay
PHP was drawn 20 min after subcutaneous injection of sodium heparin
(500 U/kg body weight). Enzyme activities of LPL and hepatic lipase in PHP
were assayed as previously described (Zechner, 1990).
Hepatic VLDL Secretion
Mice were fasted overnight followed by subcutaneous injection with P-407
(1 mg/g body weight) to inhibit peripheral lipolysis. Plasma samples were
drawn right before P-407 injection as an initial time point and 1, 2, and 3 hr after
injection. Plasma TG concentration at each time point was determined.
Metabolic Labeling Studies in Primary Hepatocytes
Primary hepatocytes were isolated from non-fasted mice by perfusion with
0.8 mg/mL Collagenase Type I (Worthington Biochemical Group, NJ) through
the portal vein. Cells were incubated with DMEM containing 15% FBS for
4 hr for cell attachment as described previously (Wei et al., 2010). For incor-
poration of exogenous substrates into lipids, hepatocytes were washed
twice, and then incubated for 4 hr in 2 ml serum-free DMEM containing either
5 mCi [3H] oleate (combined with 400 mM oleate conjugated with 0.5% FA-
free BSA) or 5 mCi [3H] acetate (combined with 50 mM sodium acetate). Cells
and media (after washing with PBS to remove unabsorbed substrate) were
collected for analysis (pulse) or incubated with DMEM for further 12 hr
(chase). [3H]-labeled lipids were determined following lipid extraction and
thin-layer chromatography by liquid scintillation counting as described
above.
Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism5. Unpaired Student’s two-tailed t test and ANOVA followed
by Bonferroni posttest were used to determine significance of differences
between groups where appropriate. Correlation was studied by Pearson’s cor-
relation test or Spearman’s correlation as indicated. Values of p < 0.05 were
considered as significantly different.
