 Abstract
Objective—To determine prevalence of delirium in critically-ill children and explore associated 
risk factors.
Design—Multi-institutional point-prevalence study.
Setting—Twenty-five pediatric critical care units in the United States, the Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Australia, and Saudi Arabia.
Patients—All children admitted to the pediatric critical care units on designated study days 
(n=994).
Intervention—Children were screened for delirium using the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric 
Delirium (CAPD) by the bedside nurse. Demographic and treatment-related variables were 
collected.
Measurements and Main Results—Primary study outcome measure was prevalence of 
delirium. In 159 children, a final determination of mental status could not be ascertained. Of the 
835 remaining subjects, 25% screened positive for delirium, 13% were classified as comatose, and 
62% were delirium-free and coma-free. Delirium prevalence rates varied significantly with reason 
for ICU admission, with highest delirium rates found in children admitted with an infectious or 
inflammatory disorder. For children who were in the PICU for 6 or more days, delirium prevalence 
rate was 38%. In a multivariate model, risk factors independently associated with development of 
delirium included age < 2 years, mechanical ventilation, benzodiazepines, narcotics, use of 
physical restraints, and exposure to vasopressors and anti-epileptics.
Conclusions—Delirium is a prevalent complication of critical illness in children, with 
identifiable risk factors. Further multi-institutional, longitudinal studies are required to investigate 
effect of delirium on long-term outcomes, and possible preventive and treatment measures. 
Universal delirium screening is practical and can be implemented in pediatric critical care units.

INTRODUCTION
Delirium is acute neurologic dysfunction in the setting of serious illness. It is characterized 
by a fluctuating disturbance in cognition and awareness, and is a result of an underlying 
medical condition, and/or its treatment. Delirium is generally a temporary state, reversing as 
the underlying condition abates or when iatrogenic triggers are removed(1). Delirium in 
adults with critical illnesses is well characterized since it is associated with increased 
mortality, and significant morbidity(2–4). It is linked to in-hospital death, and long-term 
cognitive impairment in survivors(5–7). Delirium increases time to extubation, hospital 
length of stay (LOS), and medical costs(8–10).
Much less is known about pediatric delirium (PD), largely due to lack of widespread 
screening(11–13). Recent years have seen the advent of three validated screening tools for 
use in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU): the Pediatric Confusion Assessment Method

 for the ICU (pCAM-ICU), the Preschool Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU 
(psCAM-ICU), and the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD). The pCAM-ICU 
is an interactive, cognitively-oriented tool designed for children over age 5(14). Similarly, 
the psCAM-ICU is an interactive tool used in children 6 months to 5 years of age(15). 
Neither is validated for use in children with developmental delay. The CAPD is a strictly 
observational tool, designed for children of all ages and developmental abilities(16). All 
were developed for use by the bedside provider, allowing for rapid, real-time delirium 
screening in PICUs. A recent position statement by the European Society of Paediatric and 
Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) recommended use of CAPD as an instrument to assess 
paediatric delirium in critically ill infants and children (grade of recommendation =A) (17).
An emerging body of pediatric research indicates that delirium is a common complication of 
childhood illness, with a prevalence greater than 20 percent(12,16). PD has been associated 
with severity of illness, age less than 5 years, sedation, and mechanical ventilation (MV)
(18–20). PD has been linked to significant increase in hospital length of stay, and post-
traumatic stress symptoms and delusional memories in child survivors(18,21,22). However, 
most PD research has been limited by retrospective design, narrow inclusion criteria, small 
number of subjects, and single-center studies(11). To date, there has been no large-scale 
multi-institutional approach to defining the scope of PD. We hypothesized that delirium 
prevalence would be >20% overall, and would be more frequent in patients who had been in 
the ICU for a longer period of time (>3 days) (12,16). We hypothesized that risk factors 
associated with development of delirium would include mechanical ventilation, sedation 
(specifically narcotics and benzodiazepines), use of restraints, and younger age (less than 5 
years old) (18–20).
Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of PD in critically-ill children in diverse 
institutions, on 2 separate study dates, and determine demographic and treatment-related risk 
factors for the development of PD. A secondary objective was to establish the practicality of 
multi-institutional bedside screening for delirium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Subject Accrual
Each site received ethics approval from its local Institutional Review Board (IRB) and was 
granted waiver of informed consent for this observational, minimal risk study. Weill Cornell 
Medical College (WCMC) served as the data coordinating center (DCC). For the purpose of 
this study, the CAPD was chosen as the delirium screening tool (supplemental data file 1) 
because it is the only tool that has been validated across the entire pediatric age range and 
for application in children with developmental delay, and it can successfully discriminate 
between delirium and other causes of altered mental status in PICU patients(16). It consists 
of eight items, scored on a Likert scale, with a cutoff of at least nine(16). Site selection was 
made by inviting members of the Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group (PNCRG) to 
participate in the study. Participating site principal investigators and research coordinators 
each viewed a short on-line educational video and then were certified by completing a test 
on the relevant study procedures including use of the CAPD tool.

 On designated study days, every child physically admitted to the pediatric critical care unit 
at 8 am local time was included in analysis. Medical records were examined for 
demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), reason for admission, presence of physical 
restraints, respiratory support, and exposure to specific medications on the study day. Site 
personnel approached each child’s bedside nurse in the afternoon, after a minimum of 4 
hours into the nurse’s shift, and completed the CAPD based on the nurse’s clinical 
observations over the previous hours. To assist with providing a developmental framework 
for the youngest (i.e., pre-verbal) children, a developmental anchor point chart was available 
for use as a point-of-care reference when needed(23). Clinical care, including the depth of 
sedation, was not altered in conducting this study.
CAPD Scoring and Data Analysis
Consistent with other delirium research, children who were deeply sedated or 
pharmacologically paralyzed (no response to verbal stimulation) were categorized as 
“comatose” for this analysis(2, 9, 16); this is consistent with a Richmond Agitation Sedation 
Scale (RASS) score of -4 or -5. For all other developmentally typical children, a CAPD 
score ≥ 9 was considered a positive delirium screen and categorized as “delirious”. 
Developmentally delayed children were categorized as “delirious” if they had a CAPD score 
≥ 9 and the bedside nurse confirmed alteration from the child’s baseline mental status. If the 
nurse could not confirm alteration of consciousness, these children were categorized as 
“unknown delirium state”.
Data was collected by the site and uploaded to the DCC using REDCap electronic data 
capture system hosted at WCMC. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, 
web-based application providing an intuitive interface for validated data entry. No protected 
health information was shared between sites.
Statistical analysis
Variables were summarized with counts and percentages, or median and interquartile range. 
The description of subjects is based on the entire cohort. Delirium prevalence is based on the 
subjects that were comatose, delirious, or delirium/coma-free (excluding patients with 
unknown delirium state). Univariate and multivariate analyses compared those subjects who 
were delirious with those who were delirium/coma-free. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and 
Fisher’s exact test were used to determine univariate associations with delirium. For tables 
larger than 2 by 2, a Monte Carlo approximation to Fisher’s exact test was used. All tests 
used a two-sided alternative, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. 
Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess multivariate associations with delirium. A 
stepwise selection process with entry criteria of p = 0.05 was used to select variables that 
were independently associated with delirium. Variables included in the final multivariate 
model are presented with odds ratios and the associated 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS
Fifteen sites participated in the first study day – enrolling 416 children; 24 sites participated 
in the second study day – enrolling 578 children. In total, 25 different institutions and 994

 subjects were included (supplemental data file 2). The majority of the sites (n = 21, 84%) 
were in the United States with additional sites in the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia, 
and Saudi Arabia. Twenty-two PICUs were university-affiliated and three were in 
community hospitals. Number of PICU beds ranged from 10–81, with a median of 36 beds.
Preliminary analyses tested data from the two study days separately, but found no significant 
differences. Therefore, subsequent analyses represent combined data from the entire cohort. 
Subjects (n=994) are described in Table 1. A slight majority (n = 537, 54%) of children were 
male and the median length of PICU stay was 6 d [2 – 19 d]. A large proportion of children 
were admitted with a primary diagnosis involving respiratory disease (n = 415, 42%), 
followed by cardiac disease (n = 252, 25%) and neurologic disorders (n = 167, 17%). A 
significant portion of the children (n = 372, 38%) were identified as having developmental 
delay. Thirty-six percent (n = 355) were on MV and 43% (n = 427) received 
benzodiazepines on the study day.
Delirium status (delirium vs. comatose vs. delirium/coma-free) could be established in 84% 
of the children, as 159 children with developmental delay were excluded since the nurse 
could not confirm neurologic baseline to compare with current mental status in the limited 
time-frame available for the study. Other than presence of developmental delay, 
demographics of excluded subjects did not differ from the overall sample. Of the remaining 
835 children, 25% were delirious, 13% were comatose, and 62% were delirium-free and 
coma-free (Figure 1). Delirium prevalence rates varied significantly among institutions, with 
a median of 23.3% (IQR 20.0 – 35.4%; p=0.038).
In univariate analyses (table 2), children with delirium were more likely to be < 2 years old, 
mechanically ventilated, exposed to vasopressors and anti-seizure medications, as compared 
to the rest of the cohort. Potentially modifiable risk factors included use of physical 
restraints, narcotics, sedatives, and steroids. Children diagnosed with delirium had been in 
the PICU for a greater number of days at time of assessment (8 d [3, 21] vs. 4 d [2,14], p 
<0.001). Delirium prevalence varied significantly with reason for ICU admission, with 
highest delirium rates (42%) found in children admitted with an infectious or inflammatory 
disorder (Table 2). There was no association between delirium and gender, race, or ethnicity.
In a multivariate model, adjusted odds ratios showed an independent association between 
development of delirium and age < 2 y, physical restraints, MV, narcotics, benzodiazepines, 
anti-epileptics, and vasopressors. In this cohort, post-operative patients (those who had 
received general anesthesia for a surgical procedure within the preceding 24 hours) were less 
likely to be diagnosed with delirium (Table 3). Delirium prevalence rates increased 
dramatically after PICU day 5. For children in the ICU for < 6 days, delirium prevalence 
was 20%. For children who were in the ICU for 6 or more days, delirium prevalence was 
38% (p<0.001) (Figure 2).

 DISCUSSION
Delirium Prevalence
This large, multi-center study establishes that delirium is a frequent complication of critical 
illness in childhood, with a point prevalence of 25% across multiple institutions. Our 
findings are consistent with those of prior single-center studies which reported PD rates 
ranging from 10–30%(14,15,18,20,25). Children requiring MV (likely with an increased 
exposure to sedatives and higher severity of illness) had a delirium prevalence of 53%. 
Although alarmingly high, this is less than the 60–80% reported in adults on MV, perhaps 
suggesting that the pediatric brain is somewhat protected from delirium development(8,10). 
The varying prevalence rates of delirium among institutions may reflect different patient 
populations, varying severity of illness, heterogeneity in prescribing and sedation practices 
or other unknown factors. A number of these may be amenable to intervention, and could 
lead to a decrease in PD.
It is interesting to note that we found the highest prevalence of delirium in critically-ill 
children admitted with infectious/inflammatory disorders. This supports the hypothesis that 
inflammation plays a leading role in the development of delirium in children. The neuro-
inflammatory hypothesis, a prominent etiologic theory for delirium development, posits that 
systemic inflammation leads to cytokine release with subsequent effects within the central 
nervous system that are yet undescribed –leading to neuronal and synaptic dysfunction and 
ultimately clinical symptoms(26,27). Several studies in adults with delirium have shown 
increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines(28–30), yet a causal relationship in these 
observational studies has not been proven. It is possible that this finding may relate to 
perfusion status, rather than inflammation, as these children may have had periods of end-
organ hypoperfusion during their PICU stay. Additional work in understanding how the 
immune system may play a role in delirium pathogenesis – especially in children – appears 
warranted.
Risk Factors for Delirium
The risk factors for delirium outlined in our large cohort support previous work within the 
field. Numerous studies of delirium in adults have shown a strong association between 
development of delirium and both exposure to benzodiazepines and use of physical 
restraints(31–36). A recent prospective single-center study of PD demonstrated an 
association between delirium and age less than 5 years, severity of illness, need for MV, and 
pharmacologic sedation(18). In our study, we found that slightly lower age (< 2 y), MV, and 
exposure to vasopressor medications (likely a marker for severity of illness) and anti-
epileptics (correlating with underlying neurologic issues) were independently associated 
with increased risk of delirium. Moreover, we also found that benzodiazepines, narcotics, 
and physical restraints were also strongly associated with delirium. In fact, odds of delirium 
were four times higher for patients who were physically restrained even after controlling our 
analysis for MV and sedating medications. This may imply that physically restraining a 
child increases risk of delirium development, as it does in adults, or it may reflect the fact 
that children with delirium may require physical restraints in order to maintain necessary 
medical devices. We cannot assess temporality in this point-prevalence study design(10).

 Even with the progress we have made with observational delirium screening, 16% of 
children were unable to be quickly assessed for delirium. These were children with 
developmental disabilities, where the bedside caregiver could not clearly establish whether 
there was an alteration from the child’s baseline neurological examination (i.e.: whether the 
altered awareness and cognition represented acute delirium, or could better be explained by 
the pre-existing neurologic disorder) (1). A large number of these children may have been 
delirious, but require a more nuanced approach to tease out the complex interplay between 
static encephalopathy and delirium(37). This may have artificially lowered the delirium rate 
measured.
Timing of Delirium
This is the largest pediatric study to systematically determine the timing of delirium and we 
found that the prevalence of delirium increased with length of time in the PICU. We surmise 
that this may reflect an accumulation of modifiable iatrogenic risk factors over the course of 
the illness, and we doubt that it is related to non-modifiable demographic risk factors (such 
as age, recent surgery, diagnosis on admission, or presence of seizure disorder). However, it 
is also possible that this reflects those patients with highest severity of illness, whose length 
of stay is generally longer. As an example, we found decreased delirium rates in children 
who had received general anesthesia in the previous 24 hours. We believe that this reflects 
those patients who were recently admitted for recovery after an elective surgical procedure, 
with lower severity of illness and shorter time spent in the PICU when compared with the 
larger cohort. Only a longitudinal study to follow children throughout their ICU stay can 
fully explore how delirium may arise in children with critical illnesses(18). In critically-ill 
adults, delirium screening occurs in regular intervals based on local standards, usually 
several times each day. Implementing such a procedure in children – either in research 
protocols or as part of standard practice – would allow for monitoring of trends within an 
individual, rather than a one-time snapshot. In this point prevalence study, we were only able 
to include two time points overall, and only one per patient. We believe that a more 
comprehensive study may discern seasonal variation (based on disease patterns, or seasonal 
difference in sunlight) and day/night variation in delirium rates.
Feasibility of Delirium Screening
Importantly, this study demonstrates the practicality of bedside screening using the CAPD. 
Twenty-five institutions, with varied culture and practices, were all able to complete this tool 
on the vast majority of their patients without difficulty. The Society of Critical Care 
Medicine released clinical practice guidelines in January 2013, stating that “monitoring 
critically ill (adult) patients for delirium with valid and reliable delirium assessment tools 
enables clinicians to potentially detect and treat delirium sooner, and possibly improve 
outcomes”(10). We believe this is also true for critically ill children. With implementation of 
routine pediatric screening, clinicians will be able to detect delirium earlier, which may 
allow for timely intervention, and optimization of management.
This study has several strengths and important limitations. The multi-institutional nature of 
the study strongly suggests that delirium is widely prevalent in the overall population of 
children with critical illnesses. Moreover, the prevalence we observed was strikingly similar 
Traube et al.

 to single-center experiences, providing face validity for both this large study as well as those 
previously described within the literature. Our cohort represented children with a wide range 
of pathologies and severity of illness, allowing us to identify risk factors that have not been 
identified in other studies. Lastly, the study sites were able to determine a delirium status for 
84% of the 994 subjects.
With regard to limitations, the CAPD was originally designed to be scored by the nurse at 
the end of her/his shift – taking advantage of a prolonged observational period to assess the 
child’s neurological performance(16). In our study, the CAPD was administered by the 
bedside nurse at approximately mid-day so that all of the data could be collected by site 
coordinators. It is possible that a child may not have demonstrated the fluctuating symptoms 
of delirium during this time, but went on to develop delirium over the course of the next 
several hours, after the assessment was complete. Secondly, this study was performed during 
the day shift and did not account for children who showed signs of delirium at night. As 
such, we may have underestimated the true PD rate. In addition, although the CAPD detects 
all forms of delirium, it does not discriminate between them. Therefore, we did not capture 
delirium subtype (hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed) in this study; this is an important area 
for future research. Lastly, we collected a limited amount of data for this study. We believe 
that this is appropriate for our study design, yet other important covariates including 
sedation scores, severity of illness scores, and total drug exposure likely play a pivotal role 
in delirium prevalence and pathophysiology.
CONCLUSION
In this multi-institutional, multi-national point-prevalence study of 994 subjects, delirium 
screening by the bedside nurse was feasible in children of all ages. Pediatric delirium was a 
common complication of critical illness, with a prevalence of 25% and identifiable risk 
factors. Future large scale multi-institutional studies in this field, including longitudinal 
studies, are warranted to better determine the time course of delirium, understand its burden 
to childhood health, and its relationship with important clinical outcomes.

 Figure 1. Determination of mental status (n=835)
Delirium defined as CAPD score ≥9. Coma defined as subject unarousable to verbal 
stimulation. 159 children with developmental delay were excluded from this analysis as the 
bedside nurse could not establish alteration from neurologic baseline.

 Figure 2. Delirium rate by ICU day
Percentages are based on assessable subjects who were not comatose (n=723). Study days 
were collapsed to ensure that at least 50 subjects were in each group to prevent an arbitrary 
variation in delirium rate.
