Chronic stress induces signalling from the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and drives
cancer progression, although the pathways of tumour cell dissemination are unclear. Here we
show that chronic stress restructures lymphatic networks within and around tumours to
provide pathways for tumour cell escape. We show that VEGFC derived from tumour cells is
required for stress to induce lymphatic remodelling and that this depends on COX2
inflammatory signalling from macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of SNS signalling
blocks the effect of chronic stress on lymphatic remodelling in vivo and reduces lymphatic
metastasis in preclinical cancer models and in patients with breast cancer. These findings
reveal unanticipated communication between stress-induced neural signalling and inflam-
mation, which regulates tumour lymphatic architecture and lymphogenous tumour cell
dissemination. These findings suggest that limiting the effects of SNS signalling to prevent
tumour cell dissemination through lymphatic routes may provide a strategy to improve cancer
outcomes.

n everyday life, we encounter stressful experiences that pose a
threat to physiological homeostasis. These threats trigger stress
responses, including activation of the sympathetic nervous
system (SNS), which leads to elevated local and systemic levels of
catecholaminergic neurotransmitters that signal to cells1. Stress-
induced SNS signalling is important to enhance alertness and
physiological functions for rapid reaction to threat2. However,
chronic periods of stress can be detrimental to health by
increasing inflammation and promoting the progression of
diseases
including
cancer3–6.
Clinical
studies
have
linked
experience of stressful events to poor cancer survival7,8. This is
supported by preclinical studies that show chronic stress
promotes cancer progression3,4,6. These studies found that
stress recruits inflammatory cells to tumours and increases the
formation of blood vessels3,6, which may provide routes for
tumour cell dissemination. In addition to dissemination through
blood vessels, cancer cells also escape from tumours through
lymphatic vasculature9–11.
The lymphatic system plays an important role in immune
function and therefore can influence the trajectory of disease
progression. Under normal physiological conditions, the lym-
phatic system maintains homeostasis by directing cells and
solutes from the interstitial fluid of peripheral tissues through
lymphatic vessels and into lymph nodes, where they undergo
immune examination12,13. In addition, the lymphatic system aids
in the resolution of inflammation by transporting immune cells
away from sites of infection14. In cancer, the lymphatic system
contributes to disease progression by providing a pathway for
tumour cell escape while also being a rich source of chemokines
that can promote the invasive properties of tumour cells15.
Furthermore, tumour-draining lymph nodes and associated
lymphatic
endothelium
have
been
shown
to
develop
an
immunosuppressive
environment,
which
promotes
immune
tolerance to the cancer and facilitates tumour growth and
spread16–18. The importance of the lymphatic system in cancer
progression is supported by vast clinical data that show tumour-
associated lymphatic vessel density (LVD), tumour cell invasion
into lymphatic vasculature and the presence of tumour cells in
lymph nodes are each associated with increased clinical tumour
stage and reduced disease-free survival19–21.
The lymphatic system is innervated by fibres of the SNS22, and
acute SNS activity has been shown to increase lymphatic vessel
contraction23,24
and
lymphocyte
output
into
lymphatic
circulation25. However, little is known about whether stress-
induced SNS signalling affects tumour lymphatic vasculature and
the consequences this may have on cancer progression.
In this study, we show that chronic stress increases intra-
tumoural LVD while also inducing dilation and increasing flow in
lymphatic vessels that drain metastatic tumour cells into
lymphatic circulation. Inhibition of COX2 activity blocked the
effect of stress on lymphatic vascular remodelling, and showed a
key role for macrophage-mediated inflammation in the effects of
stress. In addition, we show a critical role for tumour cell-derived
VEGFC in the effects of stress on lymphatic vasculature. In both
clinical and preclinical studies we demonstrate that disrupting
SNS regulation of lymphatics, by blocking b-adrenoceptor
signalling, protects against lymphatic dissemination and cancer
progression. These findings identify stress signalling as a regulator
of lymphatic remodelling and provide evidence for the feasibility
of clinically targeting SNS regulation of lymphatics to prevent
tumour cell dissemination through lymphatic routes.
Results
Chronic
stress
remodels
tumour
lymphatic
vasculature.
Stress-related psychosocial factors have been linked to increased
cancer-related mortality8. This is supported by accumulating
preclinical data that show chronic stress acts through SNS
signalling to promote progression of multiple tumour types3,4,6,26.
However, the role of the lymphatic system in stress-induced
tumour cell dissemination is unknown. To examine the effect of
stress on tumour-associated lymphatics, we used an orthotopic
model of breast cancer in which primary tumours were developed
from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Mice were
subjected to a well-established chronic stress paradigm that
activates
SNS
signalling
whereby
inescapable
confinement
induces escape-avoidance behaviour (Fig. 1a). This paradigm
has been shown to elevate stress hormones without activating
motor-sensory
pain
pathways3.
To
examine
the
effect
of
stress
on
intratumoural
lymphatic
vasculature,
we
used
immunohistochemical analysis to quantify the expression of the
lymphatic endothelial cell marker LYVE-1 (ref. 27) within
primary tumour sections as a measure of tumour LVD.
Multiple fields of view were captured around the periphery of
the tumour margin (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Chronic stress
significantly increased tumour LYVE-1 staining compared with
control tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1b), demonstrating that
stress-induced
SNS
signalling
can
increase
the
lymphatic
network within primary tumours. Consistent with our previous
findings, chronic stress did not affect primary tumour growth
(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1B), confirming that the effect of
stress on LVD was independent of primary tumour size.
Stress similarly increased tumour LVD in immunocompetent
BALB/c
mice
with
66cl4
luminal
B
mammary
tumours
(Supplementary Fig. 1C) demonstrating that stress induces
lymphatic remodelling in a model with an intact immune system.
Our previous studies found that dilation of lymphatic vessels
that drain primary tumours increase metastasis to lymph node28.
We showed that lymph vessel dilation was dependent on
inflammatory signalling, but the physiological conditions in
which collector dilation increases metastasis remain unclear29.
Therefore, we sought to evaluate if, in addition to increasing
intratumoural LVD, chronic stress could also change the diameter
of lymphatic vessels that drain primary tumours. We used the
clinical lymph-tracing agent Patent Blue V dye30 to track lymph
drainage from the primary tumour and to quantify the diameter
of tumour-draining lymphatic vessels28. Comparisons between
the lymphatic vessels of control versus stressed mice revealed that
chronic stress caused significant dilation of the lymphatic vessel
that drains the primary tumour (Fig. 1d). This effect was
independent of changes in the diameter of the adjacent blood
vessel (Supplementary Fig. 1D) and was maintained even 2 weeks
after the cessation of stress, showing that stress induces stable
changes in tumour-associated lymphatic architecture. These data
demonstrate the ability of chronic stress signalling to not only
increase the density of lymphatic vessels within the primary
tumour but also to induce stable dilation of the lymphatic vessels
that drain primary tumours, suggesting an increased capacity for
tumour cell dissemination.
As the functionality of intratumoural lymphatics has been
debated31,32, we first examined if tumour-associated lymphatic
vessels
are
viable
routes
for
tumour
cell
dissemination.
Immunohistochemical analysis of primary mammary tumours
identified
cell
emboli
within
the lumen
of
intratumoural
lymphatic
vessels
that
stained
positive
for
LYVE-1
(Supplementary Fig. 1E). Furthermore, we show that the
tumour-associated
lymphatic
vasculature
in
this
model
is
functional as it drained Patent Blue V dye from the tumour
(Fig.
1d,e).
To
investigate
if

cells

vasculature, we developed methodology to directly visualize

 animals. MDA-MB-231 tumour cells were tagged with the
mCherry fluorescent marker and implanted into the fourth
mammary fat pad (Fig. 1e, left panel). Once tumours reached
150 mm3, fluorescently tagged nanospheres were injected into the
inguinal lymph node, and intravital multiphoton fluorescence
microscopy was used to visualize the nanospheres flowing
through the draining lymphatic vessel in situ (Fig. 1e, right

draining lymph node (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 1F and

route for spontaneous tumour cell dissemination in this model,

 we then sought to determine whether these stress-induced
alterations
in
lymphatic
architecture
were
associated
with
increased tumour cell dissemination to lymphatic organs. We
used MDA-MB-231 cells tagged with firefly luciferase for
longitudinal in vivo optical bioluminescence imaging to monitor
cancer progression (Fig. 1f). Consistent with tumour LVD and
lymphatic vessel dilation having a key role in lymphogenous
tumour cell dissemination28, stress-induced changes in lymphatic
architecture were associated with increased metastasis to lymph
nodes (Fig. 1g). Chronic stress also accelerated initial signs of
metastasis, which were observed as early as 11 days post tumour
cell injection (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1G). The presence
of tumour cells in the tumour-draining lymphatic vessel was
associated with increased lymph node metastasis (Fig. 1i), and
there was a shift to higher frequency of tumour-positive lymph
nodes with stress (Supplementary Fig. 1H and Supplementary
Table 2). Consistent with clinical observations that lymph node
involvement is prognostic for distant metastasis, tumour cell
dissemination to lymph nodes was associated with increased
distant metastasis to lung (Fig. 1g). Chronic stress similarly
increased
tumour
cell
dissemination
to
lymph
nodes
in
immunocompetent BALB/c mice with 66cl4 mouse mammary
tumours33 and in mouse mammary tumour virus-polyoma
middle T oncoprotein (MMTV-PyMT) transgenic mice that
spontaneously
develop
mammary
tumours
and
metastasis
(Fig.
1j,k)34.
These
findings
identify
chronic
stress
as
a
regulator of tumour-associated lymphatics and demonstrate that
stress-induced changes in lymphatic architecture are functional
and provide pathways for tumour cell dissemination to increase
lymph node metastasis. While these findings do not exclude that
stress also increases metastasis by promoting haematogenous
routes of dissemination3,6, they raise the possibility that targeting
stress signalling to modulate lymphatic vasculature may limit
lymphatic avenues of tumour cell dissemination.
SNS signalling can be leveraged to regulate lymph flow.
Innervation of the lymphatic system by fibres of the SNS provides
evidence for a direct link between the stress-activated SNS and
lymphatic function. This raises the possibility that SNS signalling
could increase lymph flow and facilitate tumour cell dissemina-
tion. Using multiphoton microscopy, we first confirmed that
lymph nodes are innervated with catecholaminergic TH þ fibres
of the SNS (Supplementary Fig. 2A). To investigate if the SNS
could be acutely targeted to modulate lymphatic function, we
examined the effect of neuraxial anaesthesia on lymph flow
in
a
clinical
setting.
Some
anaesthetic
agents,
such
as
neuraxial anaesthesia, inhibit nerve signalling, which results in
sympathectomy in the area of associated sensory blockade35.
Therefore, to investigate whether acute inhibition of sympathetic
signalling could reduce lymph flow, we conducted a proof-of-
concept study using nuclear lymphoscintigraphy to track the
effect of neuraxial anaesthesia on lymph flow in the lower limbs
of a consenting patient receiving brachytherapy for cervical
carcinoma. Unlike most patients receiving spinal anaesthesia,
patients
receiving
brachytherapy
have
no
surgery-induced
lower limb wound oedema that would otherwise confound
interpretation of the study’s findings. Regional sympathetic
blockade was induced by the administration of intrathecal
ropivicaine at L3/4. Nuclear lymphoscintigraphy was used to
track lymph drainage of a radiolabelled tracer (Technetium-99m
antimony sulphide colloid, 99mTc-ASC) from the injection site in
the feet through lymph vasculature to lymph nodes in the pelvis
(Fig. 2a). To minimize confounding of anatomical variation,
lymph flow was assessed before and after the implementation of
SNS blockade in the same individual. To minimize the potential
contribution of blood pressure, heart rate or muscle contraction
to changes in lymph drainage, the patient remained stationary in
a
supine
position
for
the
duration
of
the
study,
and
lymphoscintigraphy only commenced after blood pressure was
stabilized. Under baseline conditions, tracer activity at the site of
injection in the feet decreased over time and accumulated in
pelvic lymph nodes, indicating clearance of the tracer by
lymphatic flow (Fig. 2b,c). In contrast, sympathetic blockade
reduced outflow of the tracer from feet by 84% and inflow to
pelvic lymph nodes by 80% after 60 min, demonstrating that SNS
signalling is necessary for lymph flow and that clinical strategies
may be used to modulate SNS signalling and block lymph
function.
Having shown that acutely blocking SNS signalling blocks
lymph flow, we then investigated if conversely activating SNS
signalling was sufficient to increase lymph flow. Activation of the
SNS leads to the release of the endogenous neurotransmitter
norepinephrine from local SNS fibres1. To mimic the local
release
of
norepinephrine
from
tissue
nerve
endings,
norepinephrine was administered intravenously to directly
activate
SNS
signalling
pathways,
and
lymph
flow
was
measured using intravital multiphoton microscopy to track the
rate of transit of fluorescent nanospheres through lymphatic
vessels of anaesthetized mice. Nanospheres were injected into the
inguinal lymph node and the baseline rate of flow of nanospheres
through the draining efferent lymphatic vessel was quantified
after 3 min had elapsed to allow flow to stabilize. Recording from
lymphatic vessels was confirmed by the presence of occasional
valves (Fig. 2d). Treatment with a single dose of norepinephrine
significantly elevated the rate of lymph flow through collecting

 lymphatic vessels in mice (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Movie 2)
demonstrating the ability of acute SNS signalling to promote
lymphatic flow. The baseline rate of lymph flow in the absence of
norepinephrine treatment was observed to vary considerably
between animals (Supplementary Fig. 2B), consistent with
previous data36. Therefore, as with the clinical lymph flow
studies, measurements were taken in each mouse before and after
norepinephrine administration. Together, these findings indicate
that SNS signalling is a potent regulator of lymph flow and that
existing clinical strategies may be utilized to selectively alter
lymph function.
b-adrenergic signalling remodels tumour lymphatic vessels.
Norepinephrine is released from parenchymal nerve fibres in
response to stress, and binds b-adrenoceptors to modulate cell
function1. b-adrenoceptors are present on tumour cells and
stromal cell populations in the tumour microenvironment37,38,
including inflammatory cells6. Accumulating evidence from
preclinical studies suggests that chronic stress promotes cancer
progression
through
b-adrenoceptor
activation3,4,6,26,39.
To
investigate
if
b-adrenergic
signalling
is
required
for
the
effects of stress on intratumoural LVD, we treated mice
with propranolol, a non-selective b-adrenoceptor antagonist
(beta-blocker; BB) that is used clinically for the treatment of
hypertension. Treatment with propranolol during MDA-MB-231
tumour development blocked chronic stress from increasing
tumour LYVE-1 þ LVD and reduced metastasis to lymph nodes,
suggesting that reduced LVD had functional effects on tumour
cell
dissemination
(Fig.
3a
and
Supplementary
Table
1).
Conversely, systemic activation of b-adrenoceptors with the
b-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol was sufficient to increase
intratumoural LVD and increase lymph node metastasis (Fig. 3b
and Supplementary Fig. 3A) without affecting primary tumour
growth (Supplementary Fig. 3B). These findings demonstrate that
b-adrenoceptor signalling is sufficient to promote intratumoural
LVD and is necessary for the adverse effects of stress on
lymphatic vascular remodelling.

 changes in lymphatic vasculature, we used quantitative reverse
transcription–PCR (qRT–PCR) to profile the effect of stress on
the expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs).
VEGFA, VEGFC and VEGFD are central to lymphangiogenesis,
and their expression in tumours is associated with poor cancer
outcome21,40–42. Using species-specific probes (Supplementary
Fig. 4A), we found that chronic stress elevates the expression of
both tumour cell-derived and stromal cell-derived VEGFC in
MDA-MB-231 primary tumours (Fig. 4a). SNS regulation of
VEGFC expression was also confirmed in 66cl4 mammary
tumours
from
immunocompetent
mice
or
in
mammary
tumours from MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice (Fig. 4b). VEGFC
has been shown to promote tumour lymphangiogenesis and
metastasis to lymph nodes in preclinical cancer models43,44, and
is associated with increased lymph node metastasis and decreased
progression-free
survival
in
patients40.
Treatment
with
isoproterenol also elevated tumour cell and stromal cell VEGFC
expression (Supplementary Fig. 4B), while BB treatment blocked
the effect of stress on VEGFC expression (Fig. 4c), demon-
strating
the
importance
of
b-adrenoceptor
activation
in
stress-induced
expression
of
this
lymphangiogenic
factor.
VEGFC binds to its receptor VEGFR3 (FLT4) to drive tumour
lymphangiogenesis43,45–47. Chronic stress or treatment with
isoproterenol also increased stromal cell expression of Vegfr3
(Fig.
4d
and
Supplementary
Fig.
4C),
indicating
that
b-adrenoceptor signalling increases the capacity for VEGFC–
VEGFR3 signalling.
To investigate the contribution of tumour cell-derived
VEGFC in SNS-induced lymphatic remodelling, we used
short hairpin RNA to stably silence VEGFC in MDA-MB-231
tumour
cells
(Supplementary
Fig.
4D).
Knockdown
of
VEGFC blocked stress-induced LYVE-1 þ LVD in primary
tumours
(Supplementary

demonstrating
a
key
role for tumour cell VEGFC in stress-induced lymphatic
remodelling. VEGFC knockdown also blocked the ability of
stress
to
promote
lymphogenous
metastasis
and
distant
metastasis (Fig. 4e), consistent with a critical role for VEGFC-
dependent lymphangiogenesis in stress-enhanced tumour cell
dissemination. These data demonstrate that tumour cell-derived
VEGFC is necessary for stress-induced lymphatic remodelling
and metastasis.
To begin to investigate possible stromal sources of VEGFC,
we treated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and primary
macrophages—both
of
which
express

increased Vegfc expression in macrophages but not in LECs
(Fig. 4f). However, stress did not elevate Vegfc expression in
CD11b þF4/80 þ macrophages isolated from primary mammary
tumours (Fig. 4g), suggesting that there may be additional
stromal sources of stress-regulated VEGFC.

 Stress remodels tumour lymphatics via inflammation. While
chronic stress increased tumour cell VEGFC expression in
primary mammary tumours in vivo (Fig. 4a), direct treatment
of cultured tumour cells with the b-adrenoceptor agonist iso-
proterenol was insufficient to drive VEGFC expression in vitro
(Fig. 4f), suggesting that a mediating factor is required for the
effect of stress on tumour cell VEGFC expression in vivo. As
inflammation promotes VEGFC expression and drives lymphatic
remodelling15, we investigated if inflammatory pathways are
linked to stress regulation of lymphatic vasculature in vivo. We
first
looked
at
expression
of
the
inflammatory
marker
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2, or PTGS2). While tumour COX2
levels were low in control mice, stress or isoproterenol elevated
COX2 mRNA transcript levels (Fig. 5a and Supplementary
Fig. 5A), which were strongly associated with VEGFC mRNA
levels (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 5B). This is consistent with
findings in other solid cancers49–52, and extends observations that
inflammation

enhanced VEGFC expression and lymphogenous dissemination.
Clinical BB use is linked to reduced lymph node metastasis.
These findings suggest that targeting b-adrenergic stress-responsive
signalling may provide a clinical strategy to limit lymphogenous
tumour cell dissemination. Recent retrospective, epidemiological
studies have linked BB use to improved cancer outcomes57–60, but
it is unclear if lymphogenous dissemination was affected. We
therefore investigated the incidence of lymph node metastasis in a
cohort of 956 breast cancer patients during an average of 78
months after diagnosis (Table 1). Multivariate analysis revealed BB
use was significantly associated with reduced risk of lymph node
metastasis (Fig. 6a), after controlling for age, tumour stage,
peritumoural vascular invasion, tumour treatment and other
cardiac medications (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval,
0.02–0.97; P ¼ 0.04 by Cox regression analysis; Table 2). During
the follow-up period, 47 lymph node metastases were identified in
patients not taking BB (5.5% of patients) versus only 1 lymph node
metastasis in patients taking BB (1.1%, P ¼ 0.07 by Gray’s test;
Table 2). Consistent with our earlier analysis of a subset of these
patients60, BB use was also associated with decreased distant
metastasis (Fig. 6b). There was no association between BB use and
local recurrence (Fig. 6c), consistent with our in vivo studies that
found b-adrenoceptor signalling did not affect primary tumour size
or growth (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1B).

 Discussion
These findings identify chronic stress as a pathophysiological
regulator of lymphatic remodelling in cancer (Fig. 7). We
demonstrate that chronic stress induces stable changes in
intratumoural and peritumoural lymphatic architecture, and
increases lymphogenous tumour cell dissemination leading to
increased lymph node metastasis. These studies define a critical
role for neural-inflammatory signalling in the adverse effects of
stress on tumour lymphatic remodelling. Additionally, the
findings
show
that
stress-induced
vascular
remodelling
is
dependent on b-adrenergic signalling to inflammatory cells,
which increases tumour cell-derived VEGFC. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the translational potential of these findings by
showing that stress-induced SNS signalling may be blocked
pharmacologically to prevent lymph vascular remodelling, to
reduce lymph flow and to prevent tumour cell dissemination.
These findings expand our understanding of the role of
lymphogenous dissemination in metastasis by identifying chronic
stress as an external factor that drives lymphogenous spread.
Lymphatic dissemination has been described as a passive process
that presents the lowest barrier to tumour cell escape and
survival61. Rather than being passive, we show that lymphatic
dissemination
may
be
directed
by
external
(non-tumour)
influences. Specifically, we show that chronic stress drives SNS
signalling to form new lymphatic pathways of tumour cell escape.
We show that SNS signalling increases flow through lymphatic
vessels,
which
could
potentially
increase
tumour
cell
dissemination. In addition, it has been suggested that increased
lymph flow promotes immune tolerance of tumour antigens
through a VEGFC-centric mechanism62, suggesting an alternate
mechanism by which stress may promote metastatic escape by
modulating the immune system. The importance of lymphatic
dissemination in metastatic progression has been questioned due
to the ability of distant metastasis to form seemingly in the
absence of functional lymphatics32. Our studies using Patent
Blue V drainage and intravital microscopy provide evidence
for functional tumour-associated lymphatic vasculature and
spontaneous
tumour
cell
dissemination
from
orthotopic
mammary tumours.
It will be important to define stromal sources of VEGFC
(Fig. 4a). Macrophages are a known source of VEGFC43, and
treatment with isoproterenol increases Vegfc expression in
primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 4f). However,
we found no evidence that stress increased VEGFC expression by
TAMs (Fig. 4g). This suggests that while macrophages may act
through an autocrine mechanism to increase macrophage
VEGFC synthesis, this may not be the main source of stromal
VEGFC in tumours of stressed individuals. While it is also
plausible that LECs and fibroblasts may be additional sources of
prostaglandins56, we found that direct b-adrenergic signalling
to
LECs
did
not
modulate
PGE2
production
in
vitro
(or VEGFC expression) (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 5E). In
contrast, the data presented here suggest that PGE2 derived from
TAMs may contribute to stress regulation of tumour cell-derived
VEGFC. In addition, it will be important to define the direct effect
of stress on lymphatic vasculature function, as isolated lymphatic
vessels have been shown to respond to b-agonists63. Further
studies using strategies such as cell-specific knockout will be
required to assess the effect of b-adrenergic signalling on these
various
cell
populations
and
determine
their
respective
contributions to remodelling of lymphatic vasculature.
Our finding that BB treatment prevents lymphatic remodelling
and tumour cell dissemination, provides new mechanistic insight
to explain recent clinical observations that BB use is associated
with reduced metastasis and improved survival57–60. b-adrenergic
regulation of lymphogenous tumour cell dissemination—with no
effect on primary tumour growth—may explain why clinical BB
use was not associated with primary tumour recurrence. Our
finding that SNS signalling may be acutely leveraged to limit
lymph flow suggests that the perioperative period may be an
additional
opportunity
for
interventions
that
target
stress
signalling. Selective choice of anaesthetic agents that block SNS
signalling and lymph flow may help to limit dissemination of
tumour cells that become displaced from the tumour during
surgical
resection.
While
the
capacity
of
anaesthetic
sympathectomy
to
limit
tumour
cell
dissemination
or
perioperative inflammation is still unclear, the use of SNS-
blocking neuraxial anaesthesia has been associated with improved
cancer outcomes64.
These findings suggest that it may be important to identify
stressed individuals who may be particularly susceptible to
lymphogenous dissemination. One approach may be through
transcriptional profiling using a stress signature55. Alternatively,
as cancer is often a highly stressful experience, it is plausible that

 SNS intervention may be generally useful to improve cancer
outcome. In support of that contention, we found here that
clinical BB use was linked to a significant reduction in lymph
node metastasis (and reduced distant metastasis) in a cancer
cohort without prior evaluation of stress levels.
Stress regulation of lymphatic vasculature may have evolved to
promote survival during times of threat. Co-ordinated regulation
of the fight-or-flight stress response with increased lymphatic
function may have provided an evolutionary advantage by
enhancing immune surveillance and activating a rapid immune
response to physical threat. However, the findings presented here
demonstrate that SNS-regulated lymphatic function can have
adverse effects in the context of chronic diseases such as cancer.
Importantly, these findings identify multiple points of clinical
intervention to limit these adverse effects of stress.
Methods
Cells. A highly metastatic variant of the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast
adenocarcinoma cell line (MDA-MB-231HM, a kind gift from Dr Zhou Ou, Fudan
University Shanghai Cancer Center, China) was transduced with a lentiviral vector
containing codon-optimized firefly luciferase-eGFP or -mCherry under the control
of the ubiquitin-C promoter as previously described65, and was cultured in DMEM
medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 200 mM
glutamine. The identity of this cell line was confirmed by karyotyping (Cellbank,
Australia). Luminal B 66cl4 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (a kind gift from
Prof. Robin Anderson, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Australia) was transduced
with FUhlucW construct as previously described6, and cultured in a-MEM
medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS and 200 mM glutamine. Primary mouse
macrophages were derived from bone marrow of BALB/c nu/nu mice. Bone
marrow was isolated from mouse femurs and then cultured in RPMI medium
(Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, 200 nM glutamine and 100 ng ml � 1 of CSF-1
(Sigma) for 7 days for macrophage maturation. Human monocyte cell line U937
(American Type Culture Collection)66 was cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen)
containing 10% FBS and 200 nM glutamine. To induce differentiation into
macrophages, U937 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(200 nM, Sigma) for 24 h. Human lymphatic endothelial cells (human dermal
microvascular endothelial cells; HMVEC-D, catalogue #: CC-2812, Lonza) were
cultured in EGM-2MV BulletKit supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza). All cells were
maintained at 37 �C and 5% CO2. VEGFC was silenced in MDA-MB-231 cells by
stable expression of short hairpin RNA against VEGFC (TRCN0000058503,
Mission Viral Particles, Sigma). Cells were transduced with viral particles
(multiplicity of infection 2) for 5 h and selected with puromycin (8 mg ml � 1;
Invitrogen). Single-cell clones were established from GFP þ sorted cells, and
knockdown of mRNA and protein levels were confirmed by qRT–PCR and ELISA
(R&D Systems), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4D). All cells were confirmed
negative for mycoplasma contamination before use using the MycoAlert
Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).
Breast cancer models. For orthotopic tumour studies, 2 � 105 MDA-MB-231
cells or 1 � 105 66cl4 cells in 20 ml PBS (Invitrogen) were injected into the fourth
mammary fat pad of anaesthetized (3% isoflurane) 8-week-old, female BALB/c nu/
nu (University of Adelaide, Australia) or BALB/cJAsmu (Monash Animal Research
Platform, Australia) mice, respectively. Mice were housed under PC2 barrier
conditions on 12 h dark/light cycle. Primary tumours were measured by caliper,
and volume was calculated by the formula: (length � width2)/2. Metastasis was
tracked with bioluminescence using an IVIS Lumina II (Perkin Elmer) imaging
system by measuring luciferase activity (60-s exposure) after a tail-vein injection of
150 mg kg � 1 D-luciferin (CHOICE Analytical). After 22 (MDA-MB-231) or 29
(66cl4) days of tumour progression, mice were killed for evaluation. Tissue-specific
metastasis in lung, liver and lymph nodes were imaged ex vivo and frozen in
liquid nitrogen for immunohistochemistry and gene expression studies. For the
spontaneous metastasis model, 7-week-old female MMTV-PyMT-C57Bl/6 mice34
were used and metastasis evaluated by histology. CD11b þF4/80 þ TAMs were
isolated from 66cl4 mammary tumours by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Primary tumours were dissociated using collagenase type IV (Gibco) and stained
with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies against CD11b (BD Biosciences, clone M1/
70, 1:200) and F4/80 (eBioscience, Clone BM8, 1:200). Sample sizes were
determined using conservative sample size calculations under a mixed-effect

Figure 7 | Stress-induced lymphatic remodelling. Stress remodels
lymphatic vasculature through a tumour neural-inflammatory axis to
promote lymphogenous tumour cell dissemination and metastasis. Tumour
cell-derived VEGFC is necessary for stress-enhanced lymphatic remodelling
but is not directly activated by b-adrenoceptor signalling. Tumour-
associated macrophages respond to b-adrenoceptor signalling to produce
inflammatory molecules such as PGE2, which may then signal to tumour
cells to produce VEGFC required for lymphatic remodelling. These effects
may be clinically blocked using BBs, anti-VEGFC therapeutics (aVEGFC) or
COX2 inhibitors (COX2i). E, epinephrine; NE, norepinephrine; b-AR,

 longitudinal model with a power of 40.90 to detect a 5% change compared to
control at the 0.05 significance level. All procedures were carried out under
protocols approved by the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences Animal
Ethics Committee.
Chronic restraint stress. Female BALB/c nu/nu, BALB/cJAsmu or MMTV-
PyMT-C57Bl/6 mice at 8 weeks of age were randomly assigned to home cage
control conditions or chronic restraint stress (n ¼ 5 per experimental group). Mice
were restrained in a confined space that prevented them from moving freely
but did not press on them. These conditions increase tissue levels of the stress
neurotransmitter norepinephrine3. Mice were restrained for 2 h per day for 21 days
commencing 7 days before tumour cell inoculation or from 8 weeks of age for the
MMTV-PyMT model.
Pharmacologic studies. For b-agonist studies, 8-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu
mice received isoproterenol (Sigma; 5 mg kg � 1 day � 1) by daily subcutaneous
injections for a total of 21 days. For BB studies, mice received propranolol (Sigma;
5 mg kg � 1 day � 1) by mini-osmotic pump (Alzet, model 1004). For macrophage
inhibition studies, mice received GW2580 (R.I. Chemical; 160 mg kg � 1) as
previously described6. For COX2 inhibitor studies, mice received celecoxib
(Celebrex; Clifford Hallam; 25 mg kg � 1 day � 1) in drinking water. Mice were
treated with inhibitors for the duration of the study.
Lymphangiography. A volume of 20 ml of 0.25% (w/v) Patent Blue V dye (Sigma)
was injected intratumourally in anaesthetized 8-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu
mice for uptake into collecting lymphatic vessels as previously described28. A skin
flap preparation was conducted by making an incision along the central line
separating the peritoneum from the skin containing lymphatic collectors.
Draining-collecting lymphatic vessels were imaged using a dissecting microscope
fitted to an AxioCam ERc 5s camera (Zeiss). Average vessel diameter was
quantified across Z5 intervals using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ software (NIH)
by an investigator blinded to treatment conditions.
Immunohistochemistry. Following antigen retrieval with citrate buffer (0.01 M,
pH 6), 5 mm cryosections of primary tumours or lymph nodes were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and then incubated with one or more primary
antibodies for 16 h at 4 �C. Anti-LYVE-1 (Fitzgerald, catalogue #: 70R-LR003,
1:500) antibody was used to localize lymphatic vasculature followed by incubation
with corresponding Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen, cat-
alogue #: A31573, 1:500) and Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining (Sigma, catalogue #:
B2261, 1:1000). Immunostaining was visualized at � 40 magnification using an
Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon). LYVE-1 þ LVD was evaluated in Z5 digital
images per sample captured at random intervals around primary tumour margins32
by an investigator blinded to treatment conditions. Area of vessel density
(percentage of total tissue area) was quantified using ImageJ software.
In vivo lymph flow. Inert Fluoresbrite YG carboxylate nanospheres (50 nm;
Polysciences) at 0.025% in 10 ml PBS were injected into the left inguinal lymph
node of anaesthetized 8-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu mice. Visualization of
nanospheres was carried out using a Leica SP8 multiphoton as described
above. Emission was collected at 455/25 (second harmonic generation), 525/25
(nanospheres) and 585/20 nm (mCherry tumour cells). The baseline rate of flow of
nanospheres through the efferent lymphatic vessel was quantified after 3 min had
elapsed to allow flow to stabilize. To investigate stress signalling in anaesthetized
mice, stress neurotransmitter norepinephrine (Sigma; 1 mg kg � 1) was injected
intravenously and impact on lymph flow investigated. To avoid confounding of
anatomical variation, lymph flow readings were taken in each mouse before and
after norepinephrine administration. Quantification of lymphatic flow rate was
carried out by manually tracking individual particles using the Fiji distribution of
ImageJ over Z10 time points. The average velocity of each particle was then
calculated in mm s � 1.
Nuclear lymphoscintigraphy. This proof-of-concept study involved comparing
lower limb lymphatic drainage under resting conditions with that following sym-
pathetic blockade in a consenting patient receiving brachytherapy for cervical
carcinoma (Project Number 09/15, Human Research Ethics Committee Peter
MacCallum Cancer Centre; ACTRN12612001162808). Written, informed consent
was obtained from the study subject. Regional sympathetic blockade was induced
by intrathecal ropivicaine administered at the L3/4 interspace. Confirmation of
spinal anaesthesia was made before commencement of the lymphoscintigram using
ice testing to ensure a dermatome block higher than T9 (ref. 67). Unlike most
patients receiving spinal anaesthesia, patients receiving brachytherapy have no
surgery-induced lower limb wound oedema that would otherwise confound the
study’s results; patients with pre-existing alterations in lymphatic flow or
sympathetic tone, chronic regional pain syndrome, lymphoedema, surgery or
trauma to the lower limbs, obesity (body mass index 430 kg m � 2), diabetes
mellitus, patients receiving adrenergic receptor antagonists or anti-inflammatory
agents, and clinical pelvic or lower limb lymphadenopathy were excluded. To
minimize the confounding of anatomical variation, lymph flow was assessed before
and after the implementation of sympathetic blockade in the same individual. In
alliance with common anaesthesia practice, intravenous fluid resuscitation was
provided intraoperatively to the patient to achieve restoration of blood pressure
within 20% of starting blood pressure. 99mTc-ASC (0.25 ml), a colloid that migrates
through the lymphatic vessels and is retained in the sentinel lymph node for 24 h
until cleared, was injected sub-dermally in the first web-space of both feet, and
tracked from feet to inguinal lymph nodes using dynamic image acquisition over
60 min (two head gamma camera, Philips Skylight).
Secreted protein quantification. Cells were serum-starved overnight before
treatment with isoproterenol or PGE2 (Sigma). After 24 or 72 h conditioned
medium was centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m. for 5 min. Secreted levels of VEGFC or
PGE2 were quantified by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(R&D Systems).
Messenger RNA isolation and qRT–PCR. qRT–PCR using TaqMan probes was
used to quantify VEGF (VEGFA; Hs00900055_m1), VEGFC (Hs01099203_m1),
FIGF (VEGFD; forward, 50-GTATGGACTCTCGCTCAGCAT-30; reverse, 50-
AGGCTCTCTTCATTGCAACAG-30), Ptgs2 (Cox2; Mm00478374_m1), PTGS2
(COX2; Hs00153133_m1), Flt4 (Vegfr3; Mm01292604_m1), FLT4 (VEGFR3;
Hs01047677_m1), Rpl30 (Mm01611464_g1) and RPL30 (Hs00265497_m1). Total
RNA was isolated from 2 mm3 of mammary primary tumour tissue or 106 cultured
cells using RNeasy Mini Kit. A unit of 100 ng total RNA was assayed by qRT–PCR
reactions using standard PCR conditions through 60 PCR amplification cycles and
normalized to human or mouse RPL30 housekeeping gene.
Clinical beta-blockade. A detailed description of a cohort of 800 triple-negative
breast cancer patients diagnosed and operated at the European Institute of
Oncology in Milan between 1997 and 2008 has been previously described60. For
this present study we added 2 years of observation (156 patients operated in the
same Institute between 2009 and 2010) and updated the entire cohort follow-up.
Use of the data, retrieved from the European Institute of Oncology Breast Cancer
Institutional Database, was approved by the European Institute of Oncology
Review Board. At the time of admission to the hospital, all patients gave their
consent for the use of their data for research purposes. Patients with history of any
previous invasive cancer or with metastatic disease at diagnosis (stage IV) were
previously excluded. Patients were divided into two groups: the BB users group,
which included patients who were using any BB at the time of cancer diagnosis;
and the BB non-users group, which included all other patients. Association
between the occurrence of first metastatic events and BB use was evaluated in a
competing-risk survival analysis framework. Definition of events: local events are
recurrences in the ipsilateral breast. Lymph node events are events that involve the
axillary lymph nodes or the regional lymph nodes (that is, internal mammary chain
lymph nodes or supraclavicular lymph nodes). Distant events are metastases in
distant organs.
Statistical analysis. All bar graphs show sample means±s.e. Single comparisons
were performed using unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test without equal variance.
Multiple comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance or two-
way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s or Tukey’s correction for multiple
comparisons, respectively, and were confirmed using non-parametric Mann–
Whitney U-tests. Comparisons between Kaplan–Meier curves were performed
using log-rank test. Statistical significance was assumed where Po0.05. A
generalized linear model approach based on beta regression was used to model the
measured density of LYVE-1 immunostaining in primary tumour sections68. Since
the response measurements occur in the interval between 0 and 1, we model the
response measurements Yi by a beta distribution, beta(mi, Fi), where mi is the mean
response and mi(1 � mi)/Fi is the response variance. In our model both the mean
response and the dispersion parameter depend on a linear combination of the main
treatment effects, with the dispersion parameter capturing mouse heterogeneity.
Model parameters were fitted using maximum likelihood estimation. Results are
reported in Supplementary Table 1.
Association between categorical variables and BB use was evaluated by w2-test,
Fisher exact test or w2-test for trend, as appropriate. Differences in median age and
Ki-67 were tested using the non-parametric median two-sample test. Cumulative
incidences of breast cancer outcomes were compared across different patient
subgroups using the Gray test69. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models
were applied to adjust the effect of BB for age, tumour stage, peritumoural vascular
invasion, tumour treatment, other antihypertensives, antithrombotics and statins60.
Adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported. All analyses
were carried out with SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R software,
version 2.12.2 (ref. 70). All in vitro and in vivo experiments were repeated 2–4
times.
