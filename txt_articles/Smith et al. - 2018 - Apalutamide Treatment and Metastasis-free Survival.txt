BACKGROUND
Apalutamide, a competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor, is under development 
for the treatment of prostate cancer. We evaluated the efficacy of apalutamide in 
men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk 
for the development of metastasis.
METHODS
We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial involving men with 
nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen 
doubling time of 10 months or less. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 
to receive apalutamide (240 mg per day) or placebo. All the patients continued to 
receive androgen-deprivation therapy. The primary end point was metastasis-free 
survival, which was defined as the time from randomization to the first detection 
of distant metastasis on imaging or death.
RESULTS
A total of 1207 men underwent randomization (806 to the apalutamide group and 
401 to the placebo group). In the planned primary analysis, which was performed 
after 378 events had occurred, median metastasis-free survival was 40.5 months 
in the apalutamide group as compared with 16.2 months in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio for metastasis or death, 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 
0.35; P<0.001). Time to symptomatic progression was significantly longer with 
apalutamide than with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.63; P<0.001). 
The rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial regimen was 
10.6% in the apalutamide group and 7.0% in the placebo group. The following 
adverse events occurred at a higher rate with apalutamide than with placebo: rash 
(23.8% vs. 5.5%), hypothyroidism (8.1% vs. 2.0%), and fracture (11.7% vs. 6.5%).
CONCLUSIONS
Among men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastasis-
free survival and time to symptomatic progression were significantly longer with 
apalutamide than with placebo. (Funded by Janssen Research and Development;

Apalutamide Treatment in Prostate Cancer
M
etastases are a major cause of 
complications and death among men 
with prostate cancer. Nearly all men who 
die from prostate cancer have antecedent metas-
tases to bone or other sites, including the lymph 
nodes, lung, and liver.1 Bone metastases are associ-
ated with pain, pathologic fractures, and spinal 
cord compression.2 Prevention of metastases to 
bone and other sites represents an important treat-
ment goal.
Androgen-deprivation therapy — either bilat-
eral orchiectomy or treatment with a gonadotro-
pin-releasing hormone analogue agonist or an-
tagonist — is the mainstay of treatment for 
metastatic prostate cancer.3 Androgen-deprivation 
therapy is also an important part of care for many 
men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Although 
androgen-deprivation therapy is initially effective, 
castration-resistant disease eventually develops 
in almost all men with prostate cancer.4 Among 
men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant pros-
tate cancer, a shorter prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) doubling time (the estimated time required 
for the PSA level to double) is associated with a 
shorter time to metastasis or death.5,6
Apalutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen 
agent that is under development for the treatment 
of prostate cancer. Apalutamide binds directly to 
the ligand-binding domain of the androgen recep-
tor and prevents androgen-receptor translocation, 
DNA binding, and androgen-receptor–mediated 
transcription.7 In a phase 2 study involving men 
with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer who were at high risk for disease progres-
sion (with a PSA level of ≥8 ng per milliliter or a 
PSA doubling time of ≤10 months), apalutamide 
resulted in durable PSA responses.8 We conducted 
the international, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
phase 3 SPARTAN (Selective Prostate Androgen 
Receptor Targeting with ARN-509) trial to evalu-
ate the effect of apalutamide on metastasis-free 
survival in men with nonmetastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer and a PSA doubling time 
of 10 months or less.
Methods
Trial Design and Conduct
The trial was designed by two of the academic 
authors (the first and last authors) and represen-
tatives of the sponsor, Aragon Pharmaceuticals. 
The trial was conducted at 332 sites in 26 countries 
in North America, Europe, and the Asia–Pacific 
region. The review board at each participating 
institution approved the trial, which was conduct-
ed in accordance with the current International 
Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice and the principles of the Decla-
ration of Helsinki. All the patients provided writ-
ten informed consent. The sponsor commissioned 
an independent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee to review safety data on an ongoing basis 
and to review the results of the primary efficacy 
analysis before unblinding. Data were transcribed, 
by trial personnel at each clinical site, from 
source documents into electronic case-report 
forms prepared by the sponsor. All the authors 
assume responsibility for the completeness and 
accuracy of the data and analyses and for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org. All the 
authors had full access to the data, drafted the 
manuscript with input from the sponsor, reviewed 
and approved the manuscript before submission, 
and made the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication. The sponsor provided funding for 
editorial assistance. All the authors and participat-
ing institutions have agreements with the sponsor 
regarding data confidentiality.
Patients and Trial Regimen
Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older, had 
histologically or cytologically confirmed adeno-
carcinoma of the prostate that was castration-
resistant, and were at high risk for the develop-
ment of metastasis, which was defined as a PSA 
doubling time of 10 months or less during con-
tinuous androgen-deprivation therapy (bilateral or-
chiectomy or treatment with gonadotropin-releas-
ing hormone analogue agonists or antagonists). 
At screening, all the patients underwent a tech-
netium-99m bone scan and computed tomogra-
phy (CT) of the pelvis, abdomen, chest, and head. 
Patients in whom distant metastasis was detect-
ed, either on these imaging studies or with the 
use of other information sources, were excluded. 
Patients were required to have no local or regional 
nodal disease (classified as N0 on the tumor–
node–metastasis staging system) or to have ma-
lignant pelvic lymph nodes that measured less 
than 2 cm in the short axis (classified as N1) 
and were located below the aortic bifurcation.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Androgen-deprivation therapy was continued 
throughout the trial.
Patients were stratified according to PSA dou-
bling time (>6 months vs. ≤6 months), use of bone-
sparing agents (yes vs. no), and classification of 
local or regional nodal disease (N0 vs. N1) at the 
time of trial entry. Patients were randomly as-
signed, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive apalutamide 
(240 mg per day) or matched placebo, which was 
administered orally according to a continuous 
daily dosing regimen until protocol-defined pro-
gression, adverse events, or withdrawal of consent 
occurred. Interventions for the management of 
local or regional symptoms were allowed. After 
the first detection of distant metastasis, patients 
were eligible to receive treatment with sponsor-
provided abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. Af-
ter the trial regimen was discontinued, the admin-
istration of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or 
any treatment for metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer was at the discretion of the 
treating physician.
Assessments
At screening, the patients’ demographic charac-
teristics, relevant medical history, and other per-
tinent clinical conditions were recorded, and a 
physical examination was performed. Vital signs 
and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perfor-
mance-status scores (which range from 0 to 5, 
with higher scores indicating greater disability) 
were obtained at screening and at every sched-
uled visit during the double-blind period. The 
PSA level was measured at a central laboratory. 
The patients, trial staff, and sponsor representa-
tives were unaware of the patients’ PSA values 
and group assignments until unblinding occurred. 
Data on adverse events, including type, incidence, 
severity (according to the National Cancer Insti-
tute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4.0), timing, seriousness, and 
whether they were related to the trial regimen 
according to the assessment of the investigator, 
were recorded at each visit. Disease assessments, 
including technetium-99m bone scans and CT of 
the pelvis, abdomen, and chest, were performed 
every 16 weeks and at additional time points if 
distant metastasis was suspected. Evidence of dis-
tant metastasis on imaging was determined on the 
basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors, version 1.1.9 All imaging studies were 
assessed prospectively by means of blinded inde-
pendent central review. When a new bone lesion 
was detected on a bone scan, a second imaging 
study (CT or magnetic resonance imaging) was 
required in order to confirm metastasis.
End Points
The primary end point was metastasis-free sur-
vival, which was defined as the time from random-
ization to the first detection of distant metastasis 
on imaging (as assessed by means of blinded inde-
pendent central review) or death from any cause, 
whichever occurred first. Secondary end points 
were time to metastasis (defined as the time from 
randomization to the first detection of distant 
metastasis involving the bone or soft tissue on 
imaging, as assessed by means of blinded inde-
pendent central review), progression-free survival 
(defined as the time from randomization to the 
first detection of local or distant metastatic dis-
ease on imaging, as assessed by means of blinded 
independent central review, or death from any 
cause, whichever occurred first), time to symp-
tomatic progression (defined as the time from 
randomization to a skeletal-related event, pain 
progression, or worsening of disease-related symp-
toms leading to the initiation of a new systemic 
anticancer therapy or the time to the development 
of clinically significant symptoms due to local or 
regional tumor progression leading to surgery or 
radiation therapy), overall survival, and time to the 
initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Exploratory end points included time to PSA 
progression, PSA response rate, patient-reported 
outcomes, and second-progression–free survival. 
Time to PSA progression was defined as the time 
from randomization to PSA progression, accord-
ing to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) 
criteria (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org).10 PSA response rate was 
defined as the percentage of patients who had a 
decline from baseline in the PSA level of at least 
50%, according to PCWG2 criteria.10 Patient-report-
ed outcomes were assessed with the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Prostate (FACT-P) 
questionnaire and the three-level version of the 
European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) 
questionnaire. The FACT-P consists of 39 items 
that assess physical, functional, emotional, and 
social or family well-being, including concerns 
specific to prostate cancer; scores range from 0 to 
156, with higher scores indicating more favor-
able health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-3L

consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the 
EQ visual-analogue scale; scores on the EQ visual-
analogue scale range from 0 to 100, with 0 indi-
cating the worst health imaginable and 100 the 
best health imaginable. Second-progression–free 
survival was defined as the time from random-
ization to investigator-assessed disease progres-
sion (PSA progression, detection of metastatic 
disease on imaging, symptomatic progression, 
or any combination thereof) during the first sub-
sequent treatment for metastatic castration-resis-
tant disease or death from any cause.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that a sample of 1200 patients with 
372 primary end-point events would provide the 
trial with 90% power to detect a hazard ratio for 
metastasis or death in the apalutamide group 
versus the placebo group of 0.70, at a two-sided 
significance level of 0.05. A single, final analysis 
was planned for the primary end point of metas-
tasis-free survival and for the secondary end points 
of time to metastasis and progression-free survival. 
The secondary end points of time to symptomatic 
progression, overall survival, and time to the ini-
tiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy were assessed 
with the use of a hierarchical, adaptive, group-
sequential procedure, according to the prespeci-
fied Lan–DeMets alpha spending function with 
the O’Brien–Fleming efficacy boundary. The first 
interim analysis of overall survival and time to 
the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy occurred 
at the time of the final analysis of metastasis-free 
survival. Final analyses for overall survival and 
time to the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
are planned to occur after 427 events have been 
observed for each outcome. The Kaplan–Meier 
method was used to estimate medians for each 
trial group. The primary statistical method of 
comparison for time-to-event end points was a 
log-rank test with stratification according to the 
prespecified factors. Cox proportional-hazards 
models were used to estimate the hazard ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals.
Results
Patients
From October 14, 2013, to December 15, 2016, a 
total of 1207 patients underwent randomization: 
806 were assigned to the apalutamide group and 
401 to the placebo group (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Six patients (3 per group) un-
derwent randomization but never received apalu-
tamide or placebo. The clinical cutoff date for the 
primary analysis was May 19, 2017. At that time, 
the median follow-up was 20.3 months; 60.9% of 
the patients in the apalutamide group and 29.9% 
in the placebo group were still receiving the as-
signed regimen. Demographic and disease char-
acteristics were well balanced between the two 
groups (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The median PSA doubling time at 
baseline was less than 5 months in each group.
Primary End Point
The final analysis for metastasis-free survival was 
performed after distant metastasis or death had 
been observed in 378 patients: 184 (22.8%) in the 
apalutamide group and 194 (48.4%) in the place-
bo group. The median metastasis-free survival 
was 40.5 months in the apalutamide group as 
compared with 16.2 months in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio for metastasis or death, 0.28; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.35; P<0.001) 
(Fig. 1A). Of the patients who had metastases, 
60.5% in the apalutamide group and 54.4% in the 
placebo group had bone metastases. The treat-
ment effect of apalutamide was consistently fa-
vorable across prespecified subgroups (Fig. 1B). 
In July 2017, the independent data and safety 
monitoring committee concluded that the efficacy 
and safety data constituted compelling evidence of 
a clinical benefit in the apalutamide group, and the 
committee unanimously recommended that the 
trial be unblinded and that the patients in the pla-
cebo group be given the option to receive apalu-
tamide.
Secondary End Points
Apalutamide was associated with better results 
than placebo for all secondary end points (Table 2 
and Fig. 2, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Time to metastasis, progression-free sur-
vival, and time to symptomatic progression were 
significantly longer with apalutamide than with 
placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons).
Exploratory End Points
The median time to PSA progression was not 
reached in the apalutamide group as compared 
with 3.7 months in the placebo group (hazard ra-
tio, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.08) (Fig. 2). At 12 weeks 
after randomization, the median PSA level had

decreased by 89.7% in the apalutamide group and 
had increased by 40.2% in the placebo group. 
Patient-reported outcomes (FACT-P and EQ-5D-3L 
results) indicated that patients who received apalu-
tamide in addition to androgen-deprivation thera-
py maintained stable overall health-related quality 
of life over time, as did patients in the placebo 
group (Table 2).
Of the patients who discontinued the trial regi-
men, 52.5% in the apalutamide group and 77.8% 
in the placebo group received subsequent approved 
treatment for metastatic castration-resistant pros-
tate cancer (Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The most common subsequent treat-
ment was abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, 
which was administered in 75.8% of the patients 
in the apalutamide group and in 74.2% of those 
in the placebo group. The median time from the 
detection of distant metastasis to the initiation 
of subsequent therapy was 56 days in the apalu-
tamide group and 44 days in the placebo group. 
Second-progression–free survival was significant-
ly longer in the apalutamide group than the pla-
cebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 
0.49; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.66) (Fig. 2).

Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of metastasis‑
free survival in the apalutamide group and the placebo 
group. The dashed line indicates the median. The anal‑
ysis was performed with the use of a log‑rank test with 
stratification according to prostate‑specific antigen 
(PSA) doubling time (>6 months vs. ≤6 months), use 
of bone‑sparing agents (yes vs. no), and classification 
of local or regional nodal disease (N0 vs. N1) at the 
time of trial entry. Panel B shows subgroup analyses of 
metastasis‑free survival. In the forest plot, the size of 
the circle reflects the number of patients affected. The 
analysis of all patients and all subgroup analyses were 
unstratified. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance‑status score of 0 indicates as‑
ymptomatic, and a score of 1 indicates restricted in 
strenuous activity but ambulatory. Race was reported 
by the patient. NR denotes not reached.

was similar in the apalutamide group and the 
placebo group (24.8% and 23.1%, respectively). 
A total of 7.0% of the patients in the apalu-
tamide group and 10.6% of those in the placebo 
group withdrew consent from the trial. Adverse 
events were associated with death in 10 patients 
in the apalutamide group (with acute myocardial 
infarction, cardiorespiratory arrest, cerebral hem-
orrhage, myocardial infarction, multiple organ 
dysfunction, and pneumonia as the cause in 1 pa-
tient each and with prostate cancer and sepsis as 
the cause in 2 patients each) and in 1 patient in 
the placebo group (with cardiorespiratory arrest 
as the cause) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The following adverse events that were 
considered by the investigators to be related to the 
trial regimen occurred at a higher rate in the apalu-
tamide group than in the placebo group: fatigue 
(30.4% vs. 21.1%), rash (23.8% vs. 5.5%), falls 
(15.6% vs. 9.0%), fracture (11.7% vs. 6.5%), hypo-
thyroidism (8.1% vs. 2.0%), and seizure (0.2% vs. 
0%). Management strategies for rash, hypothyroid-
ism, and fracture are described in the Supplemen-
tal Results section in the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
In this international, placebo-controlled, random-
ized trial involving men with castration-resistant 
prostate cancer, the risk of metastasis or death 
was more than 70% lower with apalutamide than 
with placebo, and the median metastasis-free sur-
vival was more than 2 years longer (40.5 months 
vs. 16.2 months). The effect was observed across all 
subgroups, including patients in all age groups,

Apalutamide Treatment in Prostate Cancer
those with short PSA doubling times, and those 
with local or regional nodal disease at trial en-
try. Time to metastasis, progression-free surviv-
al, and time to symptomatic progression were 
significantly longer with apalutamide than with 
placebo. In addition, overall survival, time to the 
initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and second-
progression–free survival were longer with apalu-
tamide than with placebo; these findings support 
the clinical benefit of apalutamide.
This trial has several strengths. Imaging stud-
ies were performed every 16 weeks for the detec-
tion of metastatic disease. If bone metastasis was 
detected, confirmation on a second imaging study 
was required. All imaging studies were assessed 
by means of blinded independent central review. 
The trial design allowed patients who had meta-
static disease to receive standard treatment for 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. To 
improve access to subsequent approved treat-
ment, the trial provided abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone as a treatment option after the diag-
nosis of metastatic disease. Moreover, the trial 
included scheduled assessments after the diag-
nosis of metastatic disease to reliably determine 
other important clinical outcomes that might 
occur many months after the detection of meta-
static disease on imaging.

Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of the time to symptomatic progression (Panel A), overall survival (Panel B), second‑progression–free 
survival (Panel C), and time to PSA progression (Panel D) in the apalutamide group and the placebo group. The dashed lines indicate the 
medians. All analyses were performed with the use of a log‑rank test with stratification according to PSA doubling time (>6 months vs. 
≤6 months), use of bone‑sparing agents (yes vs. no), and classification of local or regional nodal disease (N0 vs. N1) at the time of trial 
entry. The analysis of second‑progression–free survival included patients who received any subsequent therapy (approved or nonapproved).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Approximately 80% of the patients in the 
placebo group received subsequent treatment for 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
Although subsequent approved treatment was 
administered at a high rate in the control group, 
apalutamide was associated with better results 
than placebo for secondary end points analyzed 
late during the trial, including time to symptom-
atic progression, time to the initiation of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, and overall survival. Apalutamide 
was also associated with longer second-progres-
sion–free survival than placebo.
Apalutamide was associated with higher rates 
of rash, fatigue, arthralgia, weight loss, falls, and 
fracture than placebo. The majority of adverse 
events were grade 1 or 2. The median duration of 
the trial regimen was substantially longer in the 
apalutamide group than in the placebo group. 
Disease progression was the most common rea-
son for discontinuation of the trial regimen in 
both groups. The rate of adverse events leading to 
discontinuation was less than 11% in both the 
apalutamide group and the placebo group. The

Apalutamide Treatment in Prostate Cancer
nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
should be weighed against the potential harms.
Treatment with apalutamide increased metas-
tasis-free survival and improved other clinical out-
comes in patients with castration-resistant prostate 
cancer who did not have evidence of metastasis 
on conventional imaging. Newer and more sen-
sitive imaging studies (e.g., prostate-specific mem-
brane antigen positron-emission tomography) have 
identified metastases in some patients with no 
evidence of metastases on conventional imag-
ing.11-13 The regulatory approvals of currently mar-
keted treatments for metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer were based on the results of clini-
cal trials involving men with metastases that 
were detected on conventional imaging, such as 
a bone scan or CT. It is possible that more sensi-
tive imaging tests could have identified metasta-
ses at baseline in many of the patients in our 
trial, particularly because of the requirement for 
a short PSA doubling time at trial entry. The con-
sistent increase in metastasis-free survival associ-
ated with apalutamide across all patient subgroups 
(including those with a high PSA level, a short PSA 
doubling time, or local or regional nodal disease 
at trial entry), however, suggests that the clinical 
benefits of apalutamide extend to patients with 
a high disease burden.
In conclusion, among men with nonmetastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastasis-free 
survival was significantly longer with apalutamide 
than with placebo. Consistent improvements in 
secondary and exploratory end points provide sup-
port for the veracity of our primary finding.
