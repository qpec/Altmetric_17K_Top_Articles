Bombali virus (genus Ebolavirus) was identified in organs 
and excreta of an Angolan free-tailed bat (Mops condylu-
rus) in Kenya. Complete genome analysis revealed 98% 
nucleotide sequence similarity to the prototype virus from 
Sierra Leone. No Ebola virus–specific RNA or antibodies 
were detected from febrile humans in the area who reported 
contact with bats.
T
he virus family Filoviridae is divided into 5 genera: 
Cuevavirus, Marburgvirus, Ebolavirus, Striavirus, 
and Thamnovirus (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy). 
Six distinct members of Ebolavirus have been described; 
4 are known to cause human disease (1,2). These include 
highly lethal pathogens capable of producing large out-
breaks, namely Bundibugyo, Sudan, and Zaire Ebola vi-
ruses, the last responsible for the devastating 2013–2016 
outbreak in West Africa and an ongoing extended out-
break in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1,3,4). 
Although the natural reservoirs of Ebola viruses remain 
unconfirmed, considerable evidence supports a role for 
bat species, particularly fruit bats, analogous to findings 
implicating Rousettus aegypticus fruit bats as a reservoir 
for Marburg virus (1,5,6).
The most recent Ebola virus to be identified is named 
Bombali virus (BOMV) and was reported in August 2018 in 
mouth and fecal swabs collected from free-tailed insectivo-
rous bat species (family Molossidae) Mops condylurus and 
Chaerephon pumilus in Sierra Leone (2). Although BOMV 
is not known to infect humans, its envelope glycoprotein 
shares the same NPC1 receptor as other filoviruses and is 
capable of mediating BOMV pseudotype virus entry into hu-
man cells (2). We describe the  presence of BOMV in tissues 
and excreta of an Angolan free-tailed bat (M. condylurus) 
captured near the Taita Hills in southeastern Kenya, the east-
ernmost distributional range of this bat species (7), >5,500 
km from the original BOMV identification site in Sierra Le-
one (Figure 1). We also screened human serum samples col-
lected from febrile patients in the Taita Hills area for markers 
of BOMV infection.
We identified BOMV in an adult female bat (B241) 
by reverse transcription PCR and next-generation se-
quencing. This bat was captured along with 15 others 
in mist nets in savannah habitat near a small river in 
May 2018; only this bat was BOMV positive (6% prev-
alence). Viral RNA was present in lung, spleen, liver, 
heart, intestine, mouth swab, and fecal samples but ab-
sent from the brain, kidney, urine, and a few fleas found 
on the bat; viral loads were especially high in the lung 
(Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/25/5/18-
1666-App1.pdf). These tissue-positive findings confirm 
that BOMV can infect M. condylurus and is not an ar-
tifact of its insect diet, which could not be discounted 
from the previous analysis on the basis of mouth and fe-
cal swabs (2). We also screened lung samples of sympat-
ric C. pumilus bats (n = 13) and other bat species (Ap-
pendix Table 2) captured from the same area in February 
2016 and May 2018; all were negative for BOMV RNA. 
Serologic analysis revealed antibodies against BOMV in 
the blood of the tissue-positive bat (Appendix Figure), 
but specific antibodies were not found in blood from the 
other bats (Appendix).
Our tissue-positive findings provide a strong host asso-
ciation between BOMV and M. condylurus bats; it is pos-
sible that BOMV–positive findings from other bat species 
result from local spillover or contamination. Moreover, 
phylogenetic analysis of the full BOMV genome from 
the bat lung revealed 98% nucleotide sequence similar-
ity with the prototype reported in Sierra Leone (GenBank 
accession no. MK340750) (Figure 2). Considering the 
high sequence similarity between the 2 locations and that 
M. condylurus bats, like most insectivorous bats, are be-
lieved to travel only short distances (8), BOMV is likely 
to be distributed throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa

(7). However, further monitoring of M. condylurus and 
 
C. pumilus bats and other sympatric species across Africa 
is required to support this hypothesis.
Because M. condylurus bats commonly roost in human 
structures, such as house roofs (8,9), human exposure to 
this species is more likely than for many other bat species. 
Therefore, we screened for markers of human infection 
 
with BOMV by studying serum samples collected from 
febrile patients who sought treatment at clinics in the 
Taita Hills area during April–August 2016. Clinics are 
located in the surrounding areas, all within 15 km of 
the BOMV–infected bat collection site (Figure 1). We 
screened patients for filovirus RNA (n = 81) and Ebola 
virus–specific IgG (n = 250) by an immunofluorescence 
assay using Zaire Ebola virus VP40–transfected VeroE6 
cells as antigen (Appendix). Many samples, including

sequences were retrieved from 
the Virus Pathogen Database 
and Analysis Resource and

Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
method, using a general time- 
reversible model of substitution

variation among sites allowing 
the presence of invariable sites.

Bombali Ebola Virus in Mops condylurus Bat, Kenya
all those screened for filovirus RNA, were from patients 
who reported contact with bats in the home or workplace. 
We found no evidence of filovirus infection by either 
screening method, providing no support that BOMV eas-
ily infects humans or is a common cause of febrile illness 
in the area. Ongoing surveillance is nonetheless necessary, 
and we cannot exclude the possibility that Bombali virus 
was a recent introduction to the Taita Hills area.
Our results markedly expand the distributional range 
of this new Ebola virus to eastern Africa and confirm the 
 
M. condylurus bat as a competent host. Like Goldstein et al. 
(2), we stress that the virus is not known to infect humans, 
a premise supported by our screening of febrile patients in 
the Taita Hills area. Potential efforts to eradicate bats are 
unwarranted and may jeopardize their crucial ecosystem 
roles and human health (10,11).
