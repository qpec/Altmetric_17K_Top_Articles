IMPORTANCE Maternal fish intake in pregnancy has been shown to influence fetal growth.
The extent to which fish intake affects childhood growth and obesity remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether fish intake in pregnancy is associated with offspring growth
and the risk of childhood overweight and obesity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, population-based birth cohort study of
singleton deliveries from 1996 to 2011 in Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Massachusetts. A total of 26 184 pregnant
women and their children were followed up at 2-year intervals until the age of 6 years.
EXPOSURES Consumption of fish during pregnancy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We estimated offspring body mass index percentile
trajectories from 3 months after birth to 6 years of age. We defined rapid infant growth as a
weight gain z score greater than 0.67 from birth to 2 years and childhood overweight/obesity
at 4 and 6 years as body mass index in the 85th percentile or higher for age and sex. We
calculated cohort-specific effect estimates and combined them by random-effects
meta-analysis.
RESULTS This multicenter, population-based birth cohort study included the 26 184 pregnant
women and their children. The median fish intake during pregnancy ranged from 0.5
times/week in Belgium to 4.45 times/week in Spain. Women who ate fish more than
3 times/week during pregnancy gave birth to offspring with higher body mass index values
from infancy through middle childhood compared with women with lower fish intake
(3 times/week or less). High fish intake during pregnancy (>3 times/week) was associated
with increased risk of rapid infant growth, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.22 (95% CI,
1.05-1.42) and increased risk of offspring overweight/obesity at 4 years (aOR, 1.14 [95% CI,
0.99-1.32]) and 6 years (aOR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01-1.47]) compared with an intake of once per
week or less. Interaction analysis showed that the effect of high fish intake during pregnancy
on rapid infant growth was greater among girls (aOR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.08-1.59]) than among
boys (aOR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.92-1.34]; P = .02 for interaction).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE High maternal fish intake during pregnancy was associated
with increased risk of rapid growth in infancy and childhood obesity. Our findings are in line
with the fish intake limit proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration and
Environmental Protection Agency.

E
arly life is a critical period of developmental plasticity.
A nutritional stressor or stimulus applied during criti-
cal periods of early development could permanently al-
ter body physiology and metabolism, the consequences of
which are often observed much later in life.1 Fish is the major
dietary source of ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
(LC-PUFAs), which are transferred across the placenta and may
not only benefit offspring neurodevelopment but also influ-
ence adipose tissue development.2 However, fish is also a com-
mon source of human exposure to persistent organic pollut-
ants, which may exert endocrine-disrupting properties and
contribute to obesity development.3,4
In June 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration and
Environmental Protection Agency updated their advice on fish
consumption for women of childbearing age,5 encouraging
women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or likely to become
pregnant to consume more fish, but no more than 3 servings/
week to limit fetal exposure to methyl-mercury. Fish adviso-
ries have focused on neurocognitive harms from methyl-
mercury exposure but, to our knowledge, have not considered
other childhood outcomes including growth and childhood
obesity, areas where evidence is limited.
Inalarge,Europe-widestudy(151 880mother-childpairs),6
we found that moderate fish intake during pregnancy was as-
sociated with a lower risk of preterm birth and a small but sig-
nificant increase in birth weight. Few birth cohort studies have
examinedtheassociationoffishintakeinpregnancywithchild-
hood adiposity and have yielded discrepant findings, with re-
ports of either beneficial (ie, lower obesity)7 or null8 associa-
tions. Likewise, trials have not found a clear and consistent
benefit of prenatal ω-3 LC-PUFAs on obesity-related out-
comes later in life.9 To our knowledge, there is no clear an-
swer about the optimal amount and type of fish intake during
pregnancy with regard to child growth and development.
In this study, we harmonized and pooled individual data

Methods
Study Population
European birth cohort studies participating in our previous
analysis on fish intake in pregnancy and birth outcomes6 were
invited to participate. From the 19 potentially eligible Euro-
pean cohorts, 14 cohorts provided relevant data for this analy-
sis. In addition, the Project Viva cohort from the United States
agreed to take part. All participating cohorts targeted the gen-
eral population and, altogether, covered singleton deliveries
from 1996 to 2011. All participating women provided written
informedconsentforthemselvesandtheirchildrenintheorigi-
nal cohort studies, and ethical approval was obtained from the
local authorized institutional review boards. The Amsterdam
Born Children and Their Development Study was approved by
the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Sub-
jects in The Netherlands, the medical ethics review commit-
tees of the participating hospitals, and the Registration Com-
mittee of the Municipality of Amsterdam. The Étude des
Déterminants Pré et Postnatals du Développement et de la
Santé de l’Enfant Study was approved by the Ethics Commit-
tee of Bicêtre Hospital and the National Commission on Data
Processing and Liberties. The Flemish Center of Expertise on
Environment and Health Study was approved by the Ethical
Committee of the University of Antwerp and the Ghent Uni-
versity. The Genetica e Ambiente: Studio Prospettico
dell'
Infanzia in Italia Study was approved by the Ethics Com-
mittee of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome. The
Generation R Study was approved by by the Medical Ethical
Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. The
Generation XXI Study was approved by the Portuguese Data
Protection Authority (Comissão Nacional de Protecção de
Dados). The Norwegian Human Milk Study was approved by
the Regional Ethics Committee for Medical Research in
Norway and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate. The Infancia y
Medio Ambiente Study was approved by the hospital ethics
committees of each participating Spanish region. The Kind,
Oudersengezondheid:AandachtvoorLeefstijlenAanlegStudy

Key Points
Question: What is the optimal amount and type of fish intake
during pregnancy with regard to child growth and development?
Findings: In this large, multicenter longitudinal study, we found
that high fish intake of more than 3 times/week in pregnancy was
associated with greater risk of rapid infant growth and childhood
overweight and obesity. The effect of fish intake during pregnancy
on rapid infant growth was greater among girls than boys.
Meaning: Fish contains important nutrients for developing fetuses
and its consumption should not be avoided; however, pregnant
women should adhere to fish consumption advisories.

the University of Crete for analysis. Characteristics of the par-
ticipating cohorts are shown in eTable 1 and eFigure 1 in the
Supplement.
Fish Intake During Pregnancy
The exposure of interest was the frequency (times per week)
of total fish, fatty fish, lean fish, and seafood (other than fish)
intakeduringpregnancy,derivedfromcohort-specificfoodfre-
quency questionnaires or questionnaires specifically de-
signed to assess fish intake during pregnancy (eMethods and
eTable 1 in the Supplement).
To align our analysis with the 2014 US Food and Drug
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency
advice on fish intake during pregnancy and examine a
potential dose-response relationship, we categorized total
fish intake into the following groups: low, 1 time/week or
less; moderate, greater than 1 but not more than 3 times/
week; and high, more than 3 times/week. Seven cohorts (the
Polish Mother and Child Cohort Study, Flemish Center of
Expertise on Environment and Health, Generation R Study,
Generation XXI, Lifeways Cross Generation, Prevention and
Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy, and the Mother Child
Cohort in Crete) had less than 5% or 50 participants in at
least 1 category and therefore were not included in the cat-
egorical dose-response analysis in an attempt to reduce the
likelihood of conducting a type II error.
Child Growth and Adiposity Measures
Cohorts provided information on child weight and height up
to a maximum follow-up of 6 years, obtained from clinical ex-
aminations, medical records, or parental-completed question-
naires. Permissible intervals around the nominal ages were
within 3 months for the first 2 years and within 6 months on-
wards. The time points of interest in childhood were the ages
of 2 years, 4 years, and 6 years to reflect different develop-
mental ages (toddler, preschooler, and school-aged child, re-
spectively).Threecohorts(InfanciayMedioAmbiente,Mother
Child Cohort in Crete, and the Polish Mother and Child Co-
hort Study) did not provide growth data at the age of 6 years
owing to their relatively recent recruitment period. For each
cohort,weconstructedsex-andage-specificweightandheight
growth curves using mixed-effects linear regression models
with fractional polynomials of age, including a random inter-
cept for child and random age slopes (eMethods in the Supple-
ment). Actual and predicted measurements were compared to
assess model fit, and high levels of agreement were found
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Predicted values were then used
to calculate sex- and age-specific BMI z scores and BMI per-
centile values based on the 2006 World Health Organization
child growth standards for children 5 years and younger10 and
2007 World Health Organization growth references for chil-
dren and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years (eMethods in the
Supplement).11
We defined rapid infant growth from birth to 2 years as a
z score change in weight of greater than 0.67 and used the
z score change of 0.67 or less as the comparison.12,13 We ana-
lyzed child BMI z score as a continuous outcome at 2 years,
4 years, and 6 years of age and in categories of overweight and
obese (BMI ≥85th percentile for age and sex) at 4 and 6 years,
compared with BMI below the 85th percentile.14
Covariates
Potential confounding variables were defined as similarly as
possible among the cohorts. Information on maternal prepreg-
nancy BMI (in weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared), maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes or no),
gestational weight gain (in kilograms), maternal age at deliv-
ery (in years), birth weight (in grams), and child sex (male
or female) was collected by means of interviews or self-
administered questionnaires, ad hoc measurements, birth rec-
ords, or medical registries. Information on breastfeeding du-
ration (in months) and maternal education (cohort-specific
definitions of low, medium, or high) was obtained through in-
terviews or self-administered questionnaires.
Statistical Analysis
Cohort-Specific Analyses
We used linear regression models to examine the association
of fish intake during pregnancy with BMI z scores in child-
hoodandlogisticregressionmodelsforrapidinfantgrowthand
childhood overweight/obesity. To select the confounders for
adjustment in multivariable models, we used a directed acy-
clic graph approach based on prior knowledge about parental
and child covariates that may be related to child adiposity
and/or fish intake in pregnancy.15 We constructed the graph
using DAGitty version 2.1 (DAGitty)16 to identify minimally suf-
ficientadjustmentsetsofcovariatesandchosethesetonwhich
we had the best available information (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment). We included the following variables in multivariable
models: maternal education, maternal prepregnancy BMI, ma-
ternalsmokingduringpregnancy,maternalageatdelivery,and
birth weight. For the Lifeways Cross Generation cohort, the
adjusted models did not include the full list of confounders
owing to missing information on prepregnancy BMI.
Meta-Analysis and Pooled Analysis
We combined cohort-specific effect estimates for each out-
come of interest using random-effects meta-analysis in which
the weight assigned to each study was based on both the
within- and between-study variability. Heterogeneity among
cohort-specific estimates was assessed with the χ2 test from
the Cochran Q and I2 statistic.17 To compare growth trajecto-
ries based on child BMI percentile values by category of ma-
ternal fish intake in pregnancy, we used a mixed-effects lin-
ear regression model fitted with random cohort and child
intercepts and a random slope for child age. To take into ac-
count the potential age-varying effect of maternal fish in-
take, we added an interaction term for child age and fish
intake as a fixed effect.
Sensitivity Analyses
We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we included
all cohorts in the categorical dose-response analysis to exam-
ine whether the exclusion of cohorts with less than 5% or 50
participants in at least 1 fish intake category influenced the re-
sults. Second, we made further adjustment for gestational

weight gain for cohorts with available information. Third, we
calculated pooled-effect estimates for child outcomes using
mixed-effects regression models with random intercepts for
cohort and geographical location according to the United Na-
tions’ classification (Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, West-
ern Europe, Northern Europe, and Northern America). Fourth,
we calculated pooled-effect estimates using mixed-effects re-
gression models with random intercepts for cohort and re-
cruitment period (recruitment before and after 2004-2005).
Fifth, we repeated analyses after removing birth weight from
all multivariable models. Sixth, we examined the associa-
tionsoffishintakevariableswithchildhoodobesity(BMI≥95th
percentile for age and sex). Finally, we assessed whether the
effect estimates for childhood outcomes varied by child sex
(boy vs girl), prepregnancy BMI (≥25 vs <25), maternal smok-
ing during pregnancy (yes vs no), timing of dietary assess-
ment (first, second, or third trimester in pregnancy), low birth
weight (<2500 vs ≥2500 g), and breastfeeding duration (>3 vs
≤3 months) by introducing interaction terms (one at a time).
We performed analyses with STATA version 13 (StataCorp) and
R version R3.1 (R Foundation).
Results
Characteristics of the Participants
The total study population consisted of 26 184 mothers and
their offspring with follow-up from birth to 6 years of age. Par-
ticipants’ characteristics are presented in the eTables 3 to 6 in
the Supplement. Mothers were predominantly older than 29
years, nonsmokers, had a normal prepregnancy BMI, and
breastfed their children for more than 3 months. The ratio of
boys to girls was 1.03 (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The median fish intake during pregnancy varied
between study areas and ranged from 0.5 times/week in Bel-
gium (Flemish Center of Expertise on Environment and
Health) to 4.45 times/week in Spain (Infancia y Medio Ambi-
ente) (Figure 1; eTable 4 in the Supplement). Compared with
low and moderate fish consumers (≤3 times/week), women
with high fish intake (>3 times/week) during pregnancy had
a higher age at delivery in most of the cohorts (6 of 8
cohorts) and were less likely to have smoked during preg-
nancy. We did not observe any other clear pattern of differ-
ence for other sociodemographic characteristics (eTable 5 in
the Supplement).
In total, 8215 children (31.0%) were rapid growers from
birth to 2 years of age, with the prevalence across cohorts
ranging from 17.3% (Norwegian Human Milk Study, Norway)
to 56.0% (Mother Child Cohort in Crete, Greece). Four thou-
sand nine hundred eighty-seven (19.4%) and 3476 children
(15.2%) were classified as overweight or obese at ages 4
and 6 years, respectively, while the cohort-specific preva-
lence ranged from 9.5% (Kind, Ouders, en Gezondheid: Aan-
dacht voor Leefstijl en Aanleg Birth Cohort Study, Nether-
lands) to 55.8% (Lifeways Cross Generation, Ireland) at ages
4 years and from 6.4% (Kind, Ouders, en Gezondheid:

Fish Intake During Pregnancy and Offspring BMI
Women who ate fish more than 3 times/week during preg-
nancy gave birth to offspring with higher BMI values at 2 years,
4 years, and 6 years of age compared with women who rarely
ate fish (≤1 time/week) (Table 1). High fish intake during preg-
nancy was also associated with an increased risk of rapid in-
fant growth from birth to 2 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],
1.22 [95% CI, 1.05-1.42]) and increased risk of offspring over-
weight/obesity at 4 years (aOR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.99-1.32]) and 6
years of age (aOR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01-1.47]) (Table 2 and
Figure 2). We did not find evidence for an association of mod-
erate fish intake (>1 but ≤3 times/week) or consumption of dif-
ferent types of fish with child BMI and the risk of rapid infant
growth and childhood overweight/obesity (Tables 1 and 2,
Figure 2). The effect estimates from the pooled analyses were
similar to those from random-effects meta-analyses (data not
shown).
Figure 3 depicts the modeled BMI percentile trajectories
of children up to 6 years according to different levels of ma-
ternalfishconsumptioninpregnancy.Childrenofmotherswith
high fish intake exhibited consistently higher values than did
those of mothers with low fish intake, and at 2.5 years on-
wards, the difference became more pronounced. Children of
mothers with moderate fish intake during pregnancy had a
similar trajectory to that of children whose mothers had low
fish intake, and both followed the typical pattern of BMI
growth, that is, a sharp increase in BMI during infancy fol-
lowed by a decrease later in childhood.
Sensitivity Analyses
Inclusion of all cohorts in the categorical dose-response analy-
sis did not materially change the reported effect estimates
(eTables 7 and 8 in the Supplement). The associations of high
fish intake with increased risk of childhood overweight and
obesity remained significant and of similar magnitude when
additional adjustment was made for gestational weight gain
when we took into account the geographical location or the
recruitment period of each cohort (data not shown). Addition-
ally, exclusion of birth weight from the multivariate models
did not materially change the effect estimates (eTables 9 and
10intheSupplement).Whenweexaminedonlychildhoodobe-
sity as an outcome, the association had the same direction as
when examining both overweight and obesity, but confi-
denceintervalswerewider,possiblybecauseofthesmallnum-
ber of obese children (eTable 11 in the Supplement).
The magnitude of the fish intake effect on rapid infant
growth and childhood overweight/obesity was greater in girls
thaninboys(eTable12andeFigure3intheSupplement).There
was no evidence of effect modification by prepregnancy BMI,
smoking during pregnancy, timing of dietary assessment, low
birth weight, and breastfeeding duration (P for interaction >.10
for all).

Discussion
We found that fish intake of more than 3 times/week in preg-
nancy was associated with higher offspring BMI and greater
risk of rapid infant growth and childhood overweight/
obesity. To our knowledge, this is the only multicenter study
on the long-term effect of maternal fish intake in pregnancy
on offspring growth and adiposity. The use of birth cohorts in
several locations in Europe and the United States with vary-
ing fish intake levels and the absence of heterogeneity be-
tween individual cohort effect estimates provide evidence to
support the robustness and generalizability of our findings.
Childhood overweight and obesity is considered a major
public health issue.18 Rapid weight gain in infancy has con-
sistently been associated with a subsequent elevated risk of
obesity in childhood and later in adulthood.12,19 Intrauterine
life is a sensitive period, during which the capacity for prolif-
eration of mesenchymal precursor cells and their differentia-

etarysourceofω-3LC-PUFAs.Theevidenceforaprogramming
effect of ω-3 fatty acids in fetal or early life on later body com-
position mainly stems from cell culture and animal studies.20
Reports from human trials have shown limited support for a
beneficialeffectofω-3LC-PUFAssupplementationduringearly
life on body composition later in life.9,21 Findings from longi-
tudinal birth cohort studies on fish or ω-3 LC-PUFAs during
pregnancy and childhood adiposity are also discrepant, with
reports of either beneficial (ie, lower adiposity)7 or null8,22-25
associations. These inconsistencies may be caused by inad-
equate sample sizes, exposure profile heterogeneity, or dif-
ferences in adjustment for confounding variables. Our find-
ings underscore scientific gaps in the experimental evidence,
specifically, the lack of studies involving healthy populations
and interventions targeting fish intake rather than supple-
ment use, which may exert different effects.
Contamination by environmental pollutants in fish could
provide an explanation for the observed association between
high fish intake in pregnancy and increased childhood adi-
posity. In humans, fish consumption is a major source of ex-
posuretoendocrine-disruptingchemicals.26,27Mixturesofper-
sistent organic pollutants found in fish have been shown to
increase fat storage in cultured adipocytes as well as weight
gaininanimals.28Ithasbeenproposedthatthesetoxicantsmay
perturb signaling of several nuclear receptors and, through al-
tered gene expression, influence adipocyte differentiation and
fat metabolism.3,4
Although we collected information on the consumption
of different fish types, we did not have enough data to distin-
guish between big and small species, cooking procedures, and
water source of fish (ie, river or sea), which would be relevant
with respect to toxicant exposure. Moreover, in the absence
of information regarding levels of persistent organic pollut-
ants across participating cohorts, our hypothesis that fish-
associated contaminant exposure may play a role in the ob-
served associations remains speculative. Further analyses

Rapid growth was defined as a weight gain z score greater than 0.67 based on
World Health Organization (WHO) growth curves. Overweight/obesity was
defined as body mass index in the 85th percentile or higher for age and sex
based on WHO growth curves. Odds ratios (95% CIs) by cohort were obtained
by using logistic regression models adjusted for maternal age, maternal
education, prepregnancy body mass index, smoking during pregnancy, and
birth weight. Reference category was fish intake 1 or more times/week.
Combined estimates were obtained by using a random-effects meta-analysis.
The names of the cohorts and the cohort-specific ORs (95% CIs) are shown on
the left, and weights of each study are shown on the right. The squares
represent the point estimate of each study, whereas the size of the square is
proportional to the weight assigned to each cohort based on both the
within- and between-study variability; horizontal lines denote 95% CIs; and
diamonds represent overall estimates. Cohort abbreviations: ABCD, Amsterdam

incorporating biomarker information on both the amounts of
fatty acids and environmental chemicals contained within fish
will be helpful for refining estimates of the influence of pre-
natal fish intake on child growth.
We observed that the effect of fish intake during preg-
nancy on offspring obesity outcomes was more pronounced in
girls than in boys. The placenta tissue carrying the fetal ge-
nome and sex appears as a promising candidate to be involved
inmediatingsex-specificfunctionsandprogrammingeffects.29
Animal studies suggest that maternal diet may induce sexu-
allydimorphicresponsivenessinplacentalgeneexpressionand
greater sensitivity of girls to the maternal environment, espe-
cially in the biological process of the cell cycle.30,31
Although we did not see strong evidence for sociodemo-
graphic confounding in this analysis, the possibility of unmea-
sured residual confounding may still remain. We had no data
available to adjust for energy intake or dietary patterns dur-
ing pregnancy; however, adjustment for gestational weight
gain, as a good proxy for total energy intake in pregnancy,32,33
did not appreciably change the effect estimates. Moreover, al-
thoughweexaminedbreastfeedingdurationasapotentialcon-
founderoreffectmodifier,otherdifferencesinchilddietorlife-
style factors (eg, physical activity patterns) might have
influenced the observed findings. The direction of confound-
ing was differentially distributed across participating co-
horts, reflecting that the study design by itself may control to
some extent for unmeasured confounding.
Strengths of our study include the large sample size, the
centralized data analysis following a consensus protocol,
the standardized exposure definition, and the harmonized in-
formation about child outcomes and potential confounders.
As in most studies assessing the health effects of diet, we
used self-reported dietary information; hence, some informa-
tion bias might have occurred. However, in most cohorts, fish
intake was assessed using detailed food frequency question-
naires that were developed and validated for use in preg-
nancy, and all data were collected before birth and before
growth patterns were known. We used BMI as our main out-
come,ameasurethatincorporatesbothleanandfatmass;how-
ever, a high BMI has been suggested as a sensitive marker for
excess adiposity.34 Further analyses using direct measure-
ments of fat mass and body fat distribution to assess the rela-
tionship between fish intake and childhood obesity are an im-
portant consideration for future studies.
Conclusions
This large, multicenter study indicates that fish intake of more
than 3 times/week in pregnancy is associated with increased
riskofrapidgrowthininfancyandincreasedadiposityinchild-
hood. Our findings are in line with the fish intake limit for preg-
nancy proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration and
Environmental Protection Agency.
