Abstract
Rationale—Epidemiologic evidence indicates that exposures to fine particulate matter air 
pollution (PM2.5) contribute to global burden of disease, primarily as a result of increased risk of 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, mechanisms by which PM2.5 exposure induces 
cardiovascular injury remain unclear. PM2.5-induced endothelial dysfunction and systemic 
inflammation have been implicated, but direct evidence is lacking.
Objective—To examine whether acute exposure to PM2.5 is associated with endothelial injury 
and systemic inflammation.
Methods and Results—Blood was collected from healthy, non-smoking, young adults over 
three study periods that included episodes of elevated PM2.5 levels. Microparticles and immune 
cells in blood were measured by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine/growth factors were 
measured using multiplexing laser beads. PM2.5 exposure was associated with elevated levels of 
endothelial microparticles (annexin V+/CD41−/CD31+) including subtypes expressing arterial-, 
venous-, and lung-specific markers, but not microparticles expressing CD62+. These changes were 
accompanied by suppressed circulating levels of pro-angiogenic growth factors (EGF, sCD40L, 
PDGF, RANTES, GROα, and VEGF), and an increase in the levels of anti-angiogenic (TNFα, 
IP-10) and proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α/β, IL-6, and IL-1β), and markers of 
endothelial adhesion (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1). PM2.5 exposure also was associated with an 
inflammatory response characterized by elevated levels of circulating CD14+, CD16+, CD4+, and 
CD8+, but not CD19+ cells.
Conclusions—Episodic PM2.5 exposures are associated with increased endothelial cell 
apoptosis, an anti-angiogenic plasma profile, and elevated levels of circulating monocytes, and T, 
but not B, lymphocytes. These changes could contribute to the pathogenic sequelae of 
atherogenesis and acute coronary events.

INTRODUCTION
Exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter, PM2.5) 
increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature cardiovascular 
mortality.1,2 Prospective cohort studies3–6 indicate that chronic exposure to PM2.5 may 
contribute to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and type 2 
diabetes,7 and is associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes,5,6,8,9 
resulting in reduced life expectancy.10 In addition, short-term exposures to PM2.5 are 
associated with increased daily mortality,11 acute coronary events12 and ischemic stroke,13 
especially in individuals with pre-existing atherosclerotic disease.14–16 A recent assessment 
of factors that contribute to global burden of disease estimates that ambient and household 
air pollution are among the top ten contributors to premature mortality worldwide—largely 
because of the estimated effect of PM2.5 on ischemic heart disease.17
Despite extensive investigations, it is unclear how inhaled PM2.5, a pulmonary insult, can 
initiate adverse cardiovascular responses. Studies investigating the underlying processes 
have implicated the generation or exacerbation of a dysfunctional endothelium due to 
systemic inflammation.1 The endothelium plays a key role in regulating blood pressure, 
atherogenesis, and thrombosis, and therefore endothelial dysfunction could, in part, 
contribute to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with PM2.5 exposure. 
However, previous data showing associations between ambient PM2.5 with endothelial 
dysfunction18,19 or systemic inflammation,20–22 are from individuals with moderate to high 
CVD risk,19,22 diabetes,18,20 or ischemic heart disease.21 As a result, it remains unclear 
whether endothelial dysfunction reflects direct PM2.5-induced injury or is secondary to 
disease exacerbation due to PM2.5 inhalation. Because endothelial dysfunction and systemic 
inflammation are strongly associated with atherosclerosis23,24 and diabetes,25,26 an increase 
in the severity of these diseases would affect both the immune system and the endothelial 
function, even if these processes were not direct targets of PM2.5. Therefore, it is difficult to 
conclude that inhaling PM2.5 leads to systemic inflammation or endothelial dysfunction or to 
determine how these changes may be related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesion 
formation and acute coronary events.
Hence, to determine whether PM2.5 directly affects the endothelium, we examined 
biomarkers of subtle endothelial injury and mild systemic inflammation in a cohort of young 
healthy individuals with very low CVD risk. It has been previously reported that acute 
inhalation of PM2.5 does not induce frank endothelial dysfunction in healthy individuals,18 
therefore, to identify subclinical, endothelial injury, we measured circulating levels of

 endothelium-derived microparticles. Microparticles are submicron vesicular structures that 
are shed from activated or apoptotic cells.27–29 Elevated circulating levels of such 
microparticles reflect endothelial damage.30,31 To evaluate systemic inflammatory 
responses, we measured changes in immune cells, cytokines, growth factors, and vascular 
adhesion molecules. We found robust evidence of endothelial injury and systemic 
inflammation upon exposure to increased PM2.5 levels even in young healthy individuals. 
These findings lend support to the view that PM2.5 causes endothelial injury, potentially by 
establishing a mild inflammatory state. Our results are also consistent with the possibility 
that aberrant immune responses and endothelial injury may be early causes of endothelial 
dysfunction and CVD attributable to PM2.5 exposure in susceptible individuals.
METHODS
Study population
Research subjects included three groups of 24 persons (Table 1) who were recruited for each 
of three consecutive winter/spring study periods, including January – March 2013, January – 
March 2014, and December 2014 – April 2015. All study participants were healthy, young 
adults recruited from Provo, Utah. All subjects were non-smokers without exposure to 
second-hand smoke at home, work, or school. Air pollution episodes in Utah Valley occur 
under predictable conditions that include a combination of snow cover, relatively high 
barometric pressure, and stagnant atmospheric conditions. For each of the study periods, 
subjects were further divided into two “draw groups” of 12. At prearranged times (between 
11:00 am and 12:00 noon on Tuesdays or Thursdays) and during times of variable air 
pollution, the subjects in each “draw group” had their blood drawn (see Figure 1) and 
completed a questionnaire regarding current health status, level of exercise, beginning date 
of last menstrual period and supplement use.
In the first study period, only males were enrolled, while in the other periods, both genders 
were enrolled. For the second and third study periods, subjects were provided with dietary 
supplements and asked to consume two 640 mg soft gel tablets in the morning and evening 
with food. Consumption of these supplements began 3 weeks prior to the first blood draw 
and continued until the final blood draw. Subjects were randomly (stratified by gender and 
group) assigned capsules of omega-3 fatty acids (a total daily consumption of 2,560 mg, 
within the upper range of recommended dose) or identically sized placebo capsules of 
soybean oil (Pro Omega softgel/lemon capsules and Placebo Soybean Oil softgel/lemon, 
Nordic Naturals, Inc., Watsonville, California). Informed consent was obtained from all 
research subjects. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human 
Subjects at Brigham Young University and procedures followed were in accordance with 
institutional guidelines.
Blood collection and processing
For the analysis of microparticles and immune cell populations, 8 ml of blood was collected 
in sodium citrate-containing cell preparation tubes (CPT Vacutainer; Becton Dickinson). 
These tubes were centrifuged at 1700xg for 30 min at room temperature and shipped 
overnight to the University of Louisville for analysis. Upon arrival, the tubes were

 centrifuged again and the upper layer containing mononuclear cells and plasma was 
collected. This material was diluted with an equal volume of PBS and centrifuged at 500xg 
for 10 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were used for analysis of microparticles while the 
cell pellet was washed once with PBS and centrifuged. The final cell pellet was resuspended 
in a volume of 300 μl PBS+2% FCS, 150 μl of which was used for analysis of immune cell 
populations.
For analysis of platelet-monocyte aggregates, 3ml of blood was collected in an acid-citrate 
dextrose tube (ACD Vacutainer; Becton-Dickinson), and then 1ml aliquots were diluted with 
3ml PBS and fixed with 1.3ml of 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min on ice. Red blood cells 
were lysed by addition of 24 ml of water, the samples centrifuged at 400xg for 10min and 
the cell pellet resuspended in 1 ml Tyrode’s buffer and shipped to University of Louisville as 
above.
Inflammatory cytokines were measured in frozen plasma aliquots by analytical services at 
Eve Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, Canada). An array of 42 human cytokines (Human 
Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 42-Plex, Discovery Assay®) and an array that included 
soluble ICAM-1 and soluble VCAM-1 (Human Neurodegenerative Disease Array 2-Plex, 
Discovery Assay®) were analyzed using multiplexing laser bead technology.
Flow cytometry
To measure microparticles, plasma aliquots were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000xg to pellet 
residual cells and debris. The supernatant was collected and then centrifuged for 45 min at 
17,000xg. The resulting microparticle pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 1% FCS 
and 2.5mM Ca+2 and incubated with Fc block for 10 min at 4°C. Then a cocktail of 
fluorescently conjugated antibodies including, Pacific blue-Annexin V (Life Technologies), 
APC-anti-CD34 (Becton Dickinson), PECy7-anti-CD41 (Becton Dickinson), PE-anti-CD31 
(eBioscience), PECy5.5-anti-CD62E (Becton Dickinson), FITC-anti-EphB4 (R&D 
Systems), and APC-anti CD143 (Biolegend) was added. In addition, one antibody (anti-
Ephrin B2; Santa Cruz) was labeled in the laboratory (Zenon Alexa 488 labeling kit; Life 
Technologies) and also added to the staining cocktail. After 30 min at room temperature, 
25,000 volumetric counting beads were added and 10,000 events collected on an LSR II 
flow cytometer. An identical sample with no antibodies was used as a gating control. 
Microparticle numbers were quantified in gated populations <1μm in size and positive for 
Annexin V staining using the FlowJo software package and normalized to the number of 
counting beads (volume) collected. Specific populations were defined by phenotype as 
documented in Table 2 and illustrated in Supplemental Figure I in the Online Data 
Supplement.
To quantify immune cell populations, resuspended cell pellets from above were incubated 
with Fc block (Miltneyi) for 10min at 4°C, followed by the addition of fluorescently tagged 
antibodies (eBioscience) recognizing CD14 (650NC), CD16 (FITC), CD19 (Alexa 700), 
CD8 (APC-e780), and CD4 (PECy7) for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were washed once, 
resuspended in 350ul PBS +2% FCS and 50,000 volumetric counting beads (Accucount 
Particles; Spherotech) were added prior to analysis. Samples were collected for 2 min on an

 LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Cell numbers were quantified using the FlowJo 
software package and normalized to the number of counting beads (volume) collected.
To quantify platelet-monocyte aggregates, cell pellets from above were washed once in 
Tyrode’s solution and then incubated with Fc block (Miltenyi) for 10 min on ice. The 
samples were then incubated with an FITC-conjugated anti-CD41 antibody (eBioscience) 
and an APC-conjugated anti-CD45 (eBioscience) antibody for 30 min on ice, washed, 
resuspended in Tyrode’s and 10,000 events collected on the LSR II flow cytometer. A 
sample with isotype control antibodies was used as a control. The percent of double positive 
events was determined using FloJo software.
Measurement of PM2.5 air pollution
Daily ambient concentrations of PM2.5 in Utah Valley were collected from three monitoring 
sites: Lindon (located at the northern part of the valley), North Provo (approximately 
centrally located), and Spanish Fork (located at southern end of valley). At the Lindon and 
North Provo sites, hourly concentrations of PM2.5, based on continuous ambient monitors, 
were also collected and used to estimate average PM2.5 concentrations for the 24-h period 
from noon to noon for each day—the approximate 24-h time period before each blood draw. 
These data were obtained from the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (Salt Lake 
City, Utah). During the last two study periods, supplemental continuous ambient monitoring 
of PM2.5 (using a Thermo Scientific™ tapered element oscillating microbalance TEOM™ 
monitor) was conducted outside of the building where the blood draws were conducted and 
indoor monitoring (using a Thermo Scientific™ portable DataRAM4™ monitor) was 
conducted inside the blood-draw room. Average PM2.5 concentrations for the 24-h period 
from noon to noon for each day were calculated. Monitored PM2.5 concentrations were 
nearly identical for all ambient monitors (Figure 1). The indoor measured concentrations of 
PM2.5 were much lower. PM2.5 concentrations from the North Provo monitor were used as 
the primary exposure measure.
Statistical analysis
Associations with PM2.5 exposures and microparticles and markers of inflammation were 
evaluated by estimating two similar regression approaches: fixed effects regression models 
controlling for subject-specific differences and a subject-mean adjusted regression that 
accounts for subject-specific differences by subtracting out subject-level means. The fixed 
effects model controls for subject-level differences by estimating subject-specific fixed 
effects as part of the model, whereas the subject-mean adjusted model controls for subject-
level differences by first subtracting out the subject-level means, and regressing deviations 
from these means on PM2.5. (See expanded statistical methods in the Online Data 
Supplement.)
Plots of subject-specific differences over pollution concentrations along with regression 
plots were generated. To explore the sensitivity of the results, models were estimated that 
excluded observations from participants who reported any acute illness at time of the blood 
draw, models that controlled for time exercised on the day of the draw and the day before the 
draw, models that controlled for menstruation (as indicated by blood-draw date being less

 than six days since beginning date of last menstrual period), and models that excluded 
observations for days with PM2.5 concentrations greater than 100 μg/m3. Additionally, rather 
than using PM2.5 concentrations 24 h prior to the blood draws, models that used PM2.5 
concentrations 12 h and 48 h prior to the blood draws, respectively, were estimated. Finally, 
using data for the final two winter/spring time periods, models that included interaction 
terms for sex and PM2.5, and fish oil (versus placebo) and PM2.5 were estimated to test for 
effect modification by sex and by fish oil supplement use.
For analysis of the multiple inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, we estimated 
the fixed effects and subject-means adjusted models. The percent change (and 95% CIs) for 
each analyte per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 relative to its mean value was calculated and 
plotted in order based on t-values. This approach comprehensively evaluates all measured 
analytes, allows for direct comparisons and evaluation of the strength of the statistical 
associations, and mitigates concerns regarding multiple testing and selective reporting. All 
statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North 
Carolina).
RESULTS
A summary of selected characteristics of research subjects is provided in Table 1. PM2.5 
concentrations and timing of blood draws for the three study periods are illustrated in Figure 
1.
PM2.5, microparticles and immune cells
Table 2 presents descriptions and summary statistics of microparticle and immune cell 
measurements and subject-mean adjusted regression results. Supplemental Table I in the 
Online Data Supplement compares regression results for the fixed-effects and subject-mean 
regressions. Delayed shipment of blood due to weather, broken blood collection tubes during 
centrifugation, and instrument malfunction during analysis resulted in some missing data. 
PM2.5 concentrations were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with elevated endothelial 
microparticles and all endothelial subgroups (venous, arterial, lung, non-lung, lung arterial, 
and lung venous). The associations were significant even after using a Bonferroni correction 
for multiple testing (p < 0.05/15). Microparticles derived from endothelial progenitor cells 
(EPC), platelets and activated endothelial cells (CD62+) were not positively associated with 
PM2.5. PM2.5 concentrations were also significantly associated with elevated immune cell 
levels, including monocytes, natural killer cells, helper T cells, and killer T cells. PM2.5 
concentrations were not associated with B cells, but were weakly associated with platelet-
monocyte aggregates.
The associations between PM2.5 and subject-mean adjusted values for endothelial 
microparticles and monocytes are illustrated in Figure 2, panels A and B. Associations for 
lung, non-lung, venous, lung venous, arterial, and lung arterial endothelial microparticles are 
similar to that illustrated in Figure 2, panel A. Indeed, relative effects of PM2.5 exposures 
were similar across all endothelial subgroups. Expressed as a percent increase relative to the 
mean level of microparticles, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 15% 
increase in all endothelial microparticles and a 15%, 14%, 10%, 9%, 19% and 19% increase

 in lung, non-lung, arterial, lung arterial, venous and lung venous endothelial microparticles, 
respectively. With regards to the immune cell responses, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was 
associated with a 4%, 4%, 3%, and 3% increase in levels of monocytes, natural killer cells, 
helper T cells, and killer T cells, respectively.
PM2.5, inflammatory cytokines, and adhesion molecules
Figure 3 presents the estimated associations between PM2.5 and all 42 measured growth 
factors and cytokines and 2 soluble adhesion molecules. The estimated associations are 
presented as percent change (and 95% CIs) in each analyte per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 
relative to the mean. Estimated associations are ordered from left to right based on t-values. 
PM2.5 was associated with changes in several circulating growth factors and cytokines 
involved in systemic inflammation including, TNFα, MCP-1, MIP-1α and MIP-1β, IP-10, 
IL-8, and IL-6, and IL-1β, as well as the soluble adhesion proteins sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1.
For TNFα, MCP-1, IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and IP-10 the associations were highly 
statistically significant with a 10 μg/m3 incremental increase in PM2.5 associated with a 1.25 
(SE=0.19, p < 0.0001), 5.22 (SE=1.09, p < 0.0001), 2.96 (SE=0.70, p < 0.0001), 0.86 
(SE=0.21, p < 0.0001), 1.65 (SE=0.52, p = 0.002), and 4.05 (SE=1.34, p = 0.003) pg/ml 
increase in each cytokine, respectively. The associations with TNFα, MCP-1, IL-8, MIP-1α, 
and sICAM-1 were statistically significant even when using the Bonferroni correction for 
multiple testing of 44 analytes (p < 0.05/44). For IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1β the associations 
were also observed but they were marginally statistically significant with a 10 μg/m3 
increase in PM2.5 associated with a 0.09 (SE=0.05, p = 0.05), 0.11 (SE=0.06, p = 0.05), and 
0.29 (SE=0.15, p = 0.06) pg/ml increase in each cytokine, respectively. Elevated PM2.5 
exposures were associated with significant reductions in the growth factors EGF (epidermal 
growth factor) and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), as well as sCD40L (CD40 
ligand), GROα (growth-regulated protein alpha), and RANTES (regulated on activation, 
normal T cell expressed and secreted) (Figure 3).
Elevated PM2.5 exposures were also significantly associated with the two soluble adhesion 
molecules, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, with a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 associated with a 
628.43 (SE=125.19, p < 0.0001) and 2,288.44 (SE=1,030.08, p = 0.03) pg/ml increase, 
respectively. The associations between subject-mean adjusted values for TNFα and 
sICAM-1 with PM2.5 concentrations are presented in Figure 2, panels C and D. Highly 
significant positive associations are observed, but this illustration also demonstrates that 
most of the variability remains unexplained by PM2.5.
Sensitivity analysis
Overall, the results were not highly sensitive to alternative modeling choices. Similar results 
were obtained for the fixed-effects and subject-mean adjusted regression models as well as 
models that treated all out-of-range cytokine/growth factor observations as missing 
observations (See Supplemental Tables I, II, and III in the Online Data Supplement). Also, 
similar results were obtained from models excluding draws from participants who reported 
illness, models controlling for concurrent and previous days’ time exercising; models 
controlling for menstruation, models that exclude days with PM2.5 concentrations greater

 than 100 μg/m3, and models that used PM2.5 concentrations 12 h and 48 h prior to blood 
draws (rather than 24 h). A formal comparison of effect estimates for these regression 
models for selected variables is presented in Supplemental Figure II in the Online Data 
Supplement. Furthermore, for the final two study periods, models that included sex and 
PM2.5, and fish oil (versus placebo) and PM2.5, interaction terms were estimated to test for 
effect modification. Overall there was no consistent evidence of effect modification by either 
sex or use of fish oil supplements.
DISCUSSION
The major findings of this study, as stylistically illustrated in Figure 4, are that episodic 
exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an increase in circulating microparticles indicative of 
endothelial apoptosis, and an inflammatory, anti-angiogenic blood profile associated with 
selective increases in T, rather than B, lymphocytes. Taken together, these findings reveal a 
characteristic signature of systemic injury inflicted by PM2.5 exposure and could provide 
new insights into potential mechanisms by which inhalation of PM2.5 increases CVD risk 
and severity, leading to premature cardiovascular mortality. Because plasmatic changes were 
observed in a young, healthy population with low CVD risk burden, these findings suggest 
that even in the absence of pre-existing disease, and un-confounded by significant disease 
progression, inhalation of PM2.5 induces endothelial injury and inflammation. Therefore, 
these changes are likely to be early signs of systemic injury, which if sustained, could 
contribute to the development or exacerbation of atherosclerotic disease as well as the 
precipitation of acute cardiovascular events in susceptible individuals.
Although previous epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to PM2.5 contributes to 
the development of cardiovascular disease,1–6,9,12,14–16 the mechanistic basis of this injury is 
not fully understood. One potential pathway is the release of pro-inflammatory mediators by 
alveolar macrophages or epithelial cells upon exposure to airborne particles. Indeed, 
exposure to concentrated PM results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as 
IL-6 or TNFα from alveolar32 or peritoneal33 macrophages. Similarly, human airway cells34 
or bronchial epithelial cells35 release TNFα, IL-6 or IL-8 upon incubation of ambient air 
particles. Our observation showing that circulating levels of TNFα, IL-8, and IL-6 are 
increased upon PM2.5 inhalation is consistent with the possibility that the release of 
cytokines in the lung could trigger and sustain a state of mild systemic inflammation.
Systemic inflammation due to PM2.5 inhalation, could by itself contribute to both an 
increase in the thrombotic propensity of the blood as well as pro-atherogenic changes in the 
vessel wall. Our observation of an association between increased platelet-monocyte 
aggregate levels in the peripheral blood and PM2.5 exposure (Table 2) suggests that PM2.5 
exposure does indeed establish an early pro-coagulation state, even in healthy adults, which 
might be an important contributor to CVD risk associated with PM2.5 exposure. While in 
humans it is difficult to directly measure pro-atherogenic changes in the vessel wall and 
atherosclerotic disease progression in young healthy humans, we did find clear signs of 
endothelial injury, reflected by an increase in circulating levels of endothelial microparticles, 
derived mostly from the venous endothelium. Notably, this location is just upstream of the 
coronary circulation putting these particles potentially at higher levels near susceptible

 coronary artery plaques in high-risk individuals. Thus, increased levels of endothelial 
microparticles in disease-free individuals is likely suggestive of injury that precedes the 
development of frank disease. Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which PM2.5 triggers the 
release of microparticles from the lung remain unclear. Exposure to inflammatory cytokines 
such as TNFα could stimulate the release of microparticles by activating the endothelium36 
and increased levels of activated (CD62+) endothelial microparticles are associated with 
states of high inflammation that accompany acute cardiovascular events.37 However, we 
found no association between CD62+ microparticles and PM2.5 exposure, suggesting that 
most endothelial microparticles released upon exposure to PM2.5 are derived from apoptosis, 
not cytokine-induced activation, of the endothelium. A similar increase in the plasma levels 
of apoptotic, not activated, endothelial ACE+ microparticles has been observed also in 
smokers with normal spirometry,38 suggesting that pathologic changes associated with 
smoking and PM2.5 exposure share overlapping mechanisms that involve early lung 
destruction, followed by subsequent cardiovascular injury.
Although elevated levels of specific cytokines such as TNFα cannot be linked to the 
generation of activated endothelial microparticles, the collective pattern of changes in 
plasma cytokines is indicative of an anti-angiogenic state. All the cytokines and growth 
factors that were suppressed with PM2.5 exposure—EGF, CD40L, PDGF-AA, GROα, 
RANTES and VEGF—have a key property in common. They are all potent angiogenic 
factors. The growth factor VEGF is required for in vivo angiogenesis and the growth of 
macrovascular endothelial cells,39 whereas EGF increases the growth and proliferation of 
microvascular endothelial cells, particularly in the presence of PDGF.40,41 EGF is also a 
strong trophic factor that prevents endothelial cells against TNFα-induced apoptosis42 and 
blockage of EGFR signaling in vivo induces endothelial apoptosis.43 RANTES is also a pro-
angiogenic factor. It promotes endothelial cell migration, spreading and neo-vessel 
formation, and RANTES-mediated angiogenesis depends at least partly on VEGF.44,45 The 
chemokine, GROα is essential for thrombin-induced angiogenesis and it increases VEGF 
production by endothelial cells.46 Down regulation or inhibition of GROα markedly 
decreases VEGF expression and the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells.47 Likewise, 
the interaction of sCD40L with CD40 on endothelial cells has been shown to increase the 
expression of VEGF and stimulate angiogenesis.48,49 Overall, the association of PM2.5 with 
lower circulating levels of sCD40L, FGF, PDGF, GROα, RANTES and VEGF suggests that 
loss of trophic, angiogenic factors could account for the increase in apoptosis of endothelial 
cells upon PM2.5 exposure.
The anti-angiogenic state established by the loss of angiogenic growth factors appears to be 
further exacerbated and reinforced by a corresponding increase in anti-angiogenic cytokines 
such as TNFα and IP-10. IP-10 is secreted by activated T cells, monocytes and endothelial 
cells and elevated levels of this cytokine has been linked to inflammatory disorders such as 
asthma.50 It inhibits the development of new vasculature and causes the regression of newly 
formed vessels51 and is strongly induced upon stimulation of monocytes with TNF-α.52 
Elevation in the circulating levels of TNFα and other cytokines such as MCP-1, IL-8, and 
MIP1α/β are indicative of a pro-inflammatory state associated with increased chemotaxis 
and atherogenesis. High circulating levels of MCP-153 and IL-854 are associated with 
increased risk of all-cause mortality in CVD patients. Interestingly, circulating levels of

 MIP-1β and TNFα correlate significantly with plaque levels of these cytokines,55 suggesting 
that PM2.5 associated increases in the plasma levels of these cytokine may be reflective of 
increased vascular inflammation.
The pattern of changes in plasma cytokine levels associated with PM2.5 exposure may also 
be linked with the observed increases in circulating lymphocytes. Cytokines such as 
MCP-156 and IP-1057 exert potent chemotactic activity towards monocytes and T 
lymphocytes, whereas IL-9 stimulates the proliferation of activated T cells. Hence, an 
increase in these cytokines may be linked to the increased levels of monocytes and T cells. 
Notably, no change in the levels of B cells was observed, suggesting a lack of an adaptive 
immune response. Because PM2.5 lacks proteins or other T-cell dependent antigens, as well 
as non-T cell dependent antigens such as foreign polysaccharides or DNA, it may be 
insufficient to induce a humoral response. Nevertheless, selective increase in T, but not B, 
cell populations may be indicative of increased cytokine production and/or the formation of 
auto-antigens generated by injured or dying endothelial cells.
Previous studies have shown that PM2.5 exposure of just a few hours or days is associated 
with both fatal and non-fatal ischemic stroke as well as acute coronary syndrome 
events.12–16 This evidence suggests that there are systemic responses to even short-term 
PM2.5 exposure that play a role in triggering acute cardiovascular events.1 Our observation 
that episodic increases in PM2.5 are associated with an increase in endothelial 
microparticles, lymphocytes and cytokines suggests a potential mechanism for the acute 
effects of PM2.5. While cause-and-effect relationships are not easily disentangled, our results 
are consistent with a scenario in which inhalation of PM2.5 triggers pro-inflammatory and 
anti-angiogenic cytokine profile which in turn induces endothelial cell apoptosis, leading to 
increased levels of circulating microparticles. These microparticles carry metalloproteases,58 
which can induce endothelial cell apoptosis28 or contribute to the disruption or erosion of 
unstable plaques in susceptible individuals. Notably, metalloproteases are responsible for 
cleavage and generation of soluble adhesion molecules including sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 
from the endothelium, both of which were increased in association with PM2.5 exposure. 
Thus, an increase in microparticles upon PM2.5 exposure could disseminate pro-
inflammatory mediators and spread inflammation beyond the lung to establish and sustain 
low-grade inflammation and aggravate the atherothrombotic process.29
The characteristic pattern of changes in cytokines, chemokines, endothelial microparticles, 
and blood lymphocytes reported here may be diagnostic of exposure to PM2.5 and may be 
useful in distinguishing PM2.5-induced injury from that induced by inhalation of other toxins 
such as tobacco smoke. While direct comparisons are not yet available, the pattern of 
changes we observed upon exposure to PM2.5 seems to differ from that observed with 
smoking. Although like PM2.5 exposure, smoking is also associated with endothelial 
apoptosis and a decrease in plasma levels of CD40L,59 EGF,60 and GROα61 it is generally 
associated with increased blood levels of VEGF,62 which due to stimulatory effect of 
nicotine on VEGF63 or because of hypoxia induced by CO in cigarette smoke. Also, unlike 
PM2.5 exposure, smoking is not usually associated with an increase in plasma TNFα or 
MCP-1 levels.64 Hence, while further research is clearly needed, direct future comparisons

 between the pattern of changes with PM2.5 and other inhaled toxic substances may help 
discern, and thereby more reliably attribute, cardiovascular injury due to PM2.5 exposure.
Strengths of this study are its size and design. The number of available observations over the 
three-year period, multiple observations per subject, and the ability to control for subject-
specific differences using fixed-effects models or models using subject-mean adjusted 
variables provided adequate power to test the primary hypotheses. This approach allows for 
matching and control for subject-specific differences such as age, gender, race, genetics, 
health, etc. In this study, there was minimal potential for confounding by active smoking or 
exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke. Another primary strength of our study is that we 
evaluated PM2.5 associations under real-world conditions with relevant exposures. Despite 
these strengths, the study also has limitations. Although pollution episodes were predictable, 
we could only control the timing of the blood draws. We were generally successful at getting 
observations during pollution episodes but, in the third year study period, no substantive 
pollution episode occurred.
In conclusion, episodic PM2.5 air pollution exposures were associated with increased levels 
of endothelial microparticles and systemic increase in anti-angiogenic cytokines and a 
suppression of angiogenic growth factors in young healthy adults. The effects are 
statistically significant and the pattern of results is coherent and consistent. Although these 
findings need validation with additional research, they suggest that inhalation of PM2.5 can 
instigate adverse cardiovascular responses through changes in cytokine and growth factor 
levels leading to endothelial injury and increased abundance of monocytes and T cell in the 
peripheral blood; responses that could potentially initiate and promote atherosclerotic 
lesions and trigger acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Nevertheless, we found 
that air pollution exposure explained only a small amount of the variability in endothelial 
microparticles and markers of inflammation, suggesting that exposure to air pollution is one 
of multiple factors that influences cardiovascular health.

 Novelty and Significance
What Is Known?
•
Exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) is associated with 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality and contributes 
substantially to global burden of disease.
•
Although PM2.5-induced systemic inflammation and endothelial 
dysfunction have been implicated, it remains unclear how inhaled 
PM2.5, a pulmonary insult, can induce cardiovascular injury and 
exacerbate cardiovascular disease.
What New Information Does This Article Contribute?
•
In healthy, non-smoking, young adults, episodic exposure to PM2.5 was 
associated with elevated circulating endothelial microparticles, 
indicative of endothelial cell apoptosis and endothelial injury.
•
PM2.5 exposure was associated with inflammatory responses including 
an increase in immune cells, a systemic increase in anti-angiogenic 
cytokines, and a suppression of pro-angiogenic growth factors.
•
Circulating levels of soluble adhesion molecules and platelet-monocyte 
aggregates were also elevated with PM2.5 exposure.
Extensive epidemiological evidence indicates that exposure to ambient PM2.5 contributes 
to cardiovascular disease and mortality, but it is unclear how exposure to PM2.5 causes 
cardiovascular injury. We collected blood from panels of healthy, non-smoking young 
adults who were environmentally exposed to episodes of elevated PM2.5 levels. Exposure 
to this pollution was positively associated with markers of endothelial injury and 
systemic inflammation. The evidence suggests that inhalation and pulmonary deposition 
of PM2.5 triggers inflammatory responses characterized by an increase in anti-angiogenic 
cytokines and suppression of pro-angiogenic growth factors, which could result in 
increased endothelial cell death and the generation of endothelial microparticles. In 
combination with observed elevated levels of soluble adhesion molecules and platelet-
monocyte aggregates, these responses could contribute to atherogenesis, and thrombosis, 
and thereby increase the risk of acute cardiovascular events.

 Figure 1. 
PM2.5 concentrations and blood-draw dates plotted over study periods. Line plots indicate 
ambient PM2.5 concentrations for various sites and methods where: “1-d FRM” indicates 
daily concentrations based on the Federal Reference Method and “24-h Real time” indicates 
24-hour average concentrations based on continuous monitors from the Department of 
Environmental Quality sites (Lindon, North Provo, and Spanish Fork). “FOB 24-h Real 
time” indicates 24-hr concentrations from monitor located adjacent to blood-draw building 
and “Blood draw room 24-h” indicates 24-hr concentrations from monitor inside the blood-
draw room. Dots indicate the times of and PM2.5 concentrations at blood draws for each 12-
subject blood-draw group.

 Figure 3. 
Associations between elevated PM2.5 exposures biomarkers of inflammation. The 
biomarkers include all 42 measured cytokines and 2 adhesion molecules. The results are 
presented as percent change (and 95% CIs) in each analyte per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 
relative to the mean. Estimates are derived from the subject-mean adjusted regressions and 
are ordered from left to right based on t-values—resulting in the most statistically significant 
positive associations being on the left and the most statistically significant negative 
associations being on the right.

 Figure 4. 
Schematic of the proposed mechanism by which PM2.5 induces vascular injury. Inhalation 
and deposition of PM2.5 in the lungs triggers inflammatory responses that lead to the release 
of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, MCP-1 and IL-8); the recruitment of immune cells 
(CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ natural killer cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells); suppression of 
growth/angiogenic factors (EGF, CD40L, PDGF-AA, RANTES, GROα); and an increase in 
anti-angiogenic factors (TNFα and IP-10), resulting in endothelial cell apoptosis and the 
generation of endothelial microparticles in blood. These events are associated with an 
increase in circulating levels of soluble adhesion molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1) and 
platelet-monocyte aggregates. Collectively, these responses contribute to the pathogenic 
sequelae of atherogenesis and may increase thrombotic potential increasing risk of acute 
cardiovascular events.
