Background
Administration of oral sucrose with and without non-nutritive sucking is the most frequently studied non-pharmacological intervention
for procedural pain relief in neonates.
Objectives
To determine the efficacy, effect of dose, method of administration and safety of sucrose for relieving procedural pain in neonates as
assessed by validated composite pain scores, physiological pain indicators (heart rate, respiratory rate, saturation of peripheral oxygen
in the blood, transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide (gas exchange measured across the skin - TcpO2, TcpCO2), near infrared
spectroscopy (NIRS), electroencephalogram (EEG), or behavioural pain indicators (cry duration, proportion of time crying, proportion
of time facial actions (e.g. grimace) are present), or a combination of these and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Search methods
We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal. We performed electronic and manual literature searches in February 2016
for published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane
Library, Issue 1, 2016), MEDLINE (1950 to 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 2016). We did not impose
language restrictions.
Selection criteria
RCTs in which term or preterm neonates (postnatal age maximum of 28 days after reaching 40 weeks’ postmenstrual age), or both,
received sucrose for procedural pain. Control interventions included no treatment, water, glucose, breast milk, breastfeeding, local
anaesthetic, pacifier, positioning/containing or acupuncture.

 Data collection and analysis
Our main outcome measures were composite pain scores (including a combination of behavioural, physiological and contextual
indicators). Secondary outcomes included separate physiological and behavioural pain indicators. We reported a mean difference (MD)
or weighted MD (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed-effect model for continuous outcome measures. For
categorical data we used risk ratio (RR) and risk difference. We assessed heterogeneity by the I2 test. We assessed the risk of bias of
included trials using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool, and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system.
Main results
Seventy-four studies enrolling 7049 infants were included. Results from only a few studies could be combined in meta-analyses and for
most analyses the GRADE assessments indicated low- or moderate-quality evidence. There was high-quality evidence for the beneficial
effect of sucrose (24%) with non-nutritive sucking (pacifier dipped in sucrose) or 0.5 mL of sucrose orally in preterm and term infants:
Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) 30 s after heel lance WMD -1.70 (95% CI -2.13 to -1.26; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity); 3 studies,
n = 278); PIPP 60 s after heel lance WMD -2.14 (95% CI -3.34 to -0.94; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity; 2 studies, n = 164). There was
high-quality evidence for the use of 2 mL 24% sucrose prior to venipuncture: PIPP during venipuncture WMD -2.79 (95% CI -3.76
to -1.83; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity; 2 groups in 1 study, n = 213); and intramuscular injections: PIPP during intramuscular injection
WMD -1.05 (95% CI -1.98 to -0.12; I2 = 0% (2 groups in 1 study, n = 232). Evidence from studies that could not be included in
RevMan-analyses supported these findings. Reported adverse effects were minor and similar in the sucrose and control groups. Sucrose
is not effective in reducing pain from circumcision. The effectiveness of sucrose for reducing pain/stress from other interventions such
as arterial puncture, subcutaneous injection, insertion of nasogastric or orogastric tubes, bladder catherization, eye examinations and
echocardiography examinations are inconclusive. Most trials indicated some benefit of sucrose use but that the evidence for other painful
procedures is of lower quality as it is based on few studies of small sample sizes. The effects of sucrose on long-term neurodevelopmental
outcomes are unknown.
Authors’ conclusions
Sucrose is effective for reducing procedural pain from single events such as heel lance, venipuncture and intramuscular injection in
both preterm and term infants. No serious side effects or harms have been documented with this intervention. We could not identify
an optimal dose due to inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage among studies. Further investigation of repeated administration of
sucrose in neonates is needed. There is some moderate-quality evidence that sucrose in combination with other non-pharmacological
interventions such as non-nutritive sucking is more effective than sucrose alone, but more research of this and sucrose in combination
with pharmacological interventions is needed. Sucrose use in extremely preterm, unstable, ventilated (or a combination of these)
neonates needs to be addressed. Additional research is needed to determine the minimally effective dose of sucrose during a single
painful procedure and the effect of repeated sucrose administration on immediate (pain intensity) and long-term (neurodevelopmental)
outcomes.

Sucrose for analgesia (pain relief) in newborn infants undergoing painful procedures
Review question
Cochrane reviewers investigated how well sucrose (table sugar) works as a reliever of pain in newborn babies who are having painful
procedures (e.g. an injection, or heel lance, or insertion of a needle to obtain a blood sample (venipuncture), or eye examinations). The
babies’ pain responses (e.g. crying, grimacing) were assessed by scoring systems for pain used by health care professionals to measure
the pain that babies are experiencing. In addition, the reviewers wanted to investigate whether the level of pain relief is related to the
dose of sucrose, or the method of delivery (e.g. as a solution squirted into the mouth, or on a pacifier (also called a soother or dummy),
and whether there are any safety concerns about using sucrose to relieve pain.
Background
Although there are ways to manage the pain of surgery, medical illness and major procedures, ways of preventing or reducing pain from
minor medical procedures (e.g. heel lance and venipuncture) have, until relatively recently, been lacking. Sucrose has been examined
for its calming effects in crying newborns and its pain-relieving effects for invasive procedures in full-term and premature newborns.
Study characteristics
2
Sucrose for analgesia in newborn infants undergoing painful procedures (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 We searched the medical literature widely up to February 2016 for studies that investigated the pain-relieving effect of sucrose for minor
medical procedures in newborn full-term and premature babies. We included randomised controlled trials only, as these provide the
most reliable medical evidence. We identified 74 studies that reported on a total of more than 7000 infants in this Cochrane Review.
Thirty-eight studies included full-term babies only, 31 included premature babies only, and five included both full-term and premature
babies. Heel lance was the painful procedure in 38 studies, and venipuncture in nine; the remaining studies investigated a wide variety
of other minor painful procedures.
The studies used a variety of delivery methods for the sucrose solution (oral syringe, dropper or sucrose-dipped pacifier), as well as
a range of concentrations and volumes of dose. Sucrose treatment was compared with giving the babies a similar volume of water, a
pacifier, routine care, breastfeeding, ’facilitated tucking’ (holding the infant in a flexed position with arms close to the body and hands
placed to promote sucking), laser acupuncture, swaddling, warmth, anaesthetic cream for the skin (EMLA), or a combination of these.
The studies used a range of pain assessment scales to measure their results.
Study funding sources
We did not identify any studies that received funding from the industry.
Key results
There was high-quality evidence that sucrose reduces different measures of newborn pain during heel lance, venipuncture and intramus-
cular injection. However, sucrose does not provide effective pain relief during circumcision. There is conflicting evidence for whether
sucrose reduces pain for other minor painful procedures and further research is needed to investigate these more thoroughly.
Twenty-nine studies reported on adverse events (harms of the sucrose and other treatments) and found that the number of minor adverse
events (e.g. choking or gagging) was very low, and was similar in the different groups (so not attributable to the sucrose treatment). No
major adverse events were reported.
Quality of evidence
Although sucrose has been widely studied as a pain reliever for newborn babies, most studies have included few babies and have used
many different measures of pain to assess its effectiveness. We identified high-quality evidence that sucrose reduces pain for heel lance,
venipuncture and intramuscular injection. The quality of evidence was low or moderate in favour for the use of sucrose for other painful
procedures.

Description of the condition
Infants hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)
undergo frequent painful tissue-breaking procedures for diagnos-
tic and therapeutic purposes. Epidemiological research from au-
dits in NICUs in high-income countries estimates that neonates
undergo an average of four to 16 painful exposures per day
(Carbajal 2008; Johnston 2011; Lago 2013; Roofthooft 2014;
Stevens 2011). Similarly, estimates of procedural pain in infants
in low- and middle-income countries - including those in South
America (Linhares 2011), Asia (Chen 2012; Jeong 2014), and
Africa (Kyololo 2014) - are equally high.
Treatment for prevention or relief of procedural pain for neonates
in the NICU varies widely in practice and is generally less than
optimal (Carbajal 2008; Johnston 2011). An audit of 3508 tissue-
damaging procedures performed on 582 infants across a one week
period in 14 Canadian NICUs indicated that only about 50%
were accompanied by any form of pharmacologic, behavioural or
physical pain-relieving intervention (Johnston 2011). Although
clinical practice guidelines outlining strategies to relieve pain from
surgery, medical illness, and major procedures exist (Lee 2014),
their quality is inconsistent.
Untreated pain in neonates, and particularly preterm infants, dur-
ing a critical time in brain development, has the potential to result
in significant immediate and long-term consequences (Grunau
2013; Walker 2013). These consequences include: (a) changes in
somatosensory processing and altered sensitivity to future painful
stimuli; (b) impaired neuro-anatomical development; and, (c)
behavioural, emotional and learning disabilities (Bartocci 2006;
Brummelte 2012; Grunau 2013; Holsti 2005; Slater 2006; Tu
2007; Vinall 2014a; Vinall 2014b Walker 2013; Zwicker 2013).
Description of the intervention
Administration of oral sucrose with or without non-nutritive suck-
ing (NNS) (e.g. pacifiers) and other sweet solutions (e.g. glu-
cose) prior to and during painful procedures have been the most
frequently studied interventions for relief of procedural pain in
neonates (Bueno 2013; Stevens 2013). Analgesic effects persist up
to approximately one year of age, although the robustness of the
effect may decline in older infants compared to neonates (Harrison
2013).
How the intervention might work
Analgesic, calming and stress reducing effects of sucrose were first
reported in infant rats (Blass 1989; Ren 1997; Shide 1989). These
effects occurred rapidly, persisted for several minutes and were
blockedbysystemicopioidreceptorantagonists.Theywere age de-
pendent and had differential maturational effects consistent with
changes in the endogenous analgesic mechanisms and the devel-
opment of the gustatory and pain pathways (Anseloni 2002). Re-
searchers contend that sucrose may act at, or be mediated at, the
level of the brainstem (Anseloni 2002; Anseloni 2005; Fitzgerald
2015), which has been shown to be a primary relay in the ascend-
ing gustatory pathway in animals (Anseloni 2005).
In human infants, the analgesic and calming effects of sweet-tast-
ing solutions are speculated to influence endogenous opioid path-
ways activated by the sweet taste (Blass1994). However, the under-
lying mechanisms for calming and pain may differ. These mech-
anisms may be additive or synergistic, but most likely depend on
normal functioning of central mechanisms. Further research has
demonstrated that the effects are associated with the potency of
sweet taste (sweeter, more concentrated solutions), rather than vol-
ume of solution administered; with sucrose being more analgesic
than glucose and fructose, and lactose not demonstrating any anal-
gesic effects (Blass 1994). In a systematic review/meta-analysis of
the efficacy of sucrose for procedural pain management in 13 trials
and 982 neonates, Stevens 1997a found that the proportion of
time crying decreased with 0.24 g to 0.48 g sucrose (i.e. 2 mL of
a 12% to 24% solution) administered orally two minutes prior to
a painful procedure (e.g. heel lance or venipuncture).
Despite advances through research on the potential mechanisms
of sucrose analgesia, further research is required to enhance our
understanding of the opioid pathways involved in the developing
infant, the effectiveness of sucrose when administered with con-
comitant opioids and/or other pain-relieving interventions, and
with repeated use for extended periods of time (Harrison 2012).
Why it is important to do this review
This systematic review is a substantive update of the original 1998
Cochrane Review (Stevens 1998), and the updates completed in
2001, 2004, 2010 and 2013 (Stevens 2001; Stevens 2004; Stevens
2010; Stevens 2013). The most recently updated version in 2013
included 57 studies - with 4730 term and preterm neonates -
demonstratedthatsingle dosesof sucrose were effective andsafe for
reducingpainassociatedwith several single painful proceduresper-
formed in stable full-term and preterm neonates (Stevens 2013).
Tissue-damaging procedures included heel lance, venipuncture,
eye examinations, circumcision, subcutaneous injections, bladder
catheterization, and nasogastric tube insertion. A meta-analysis of
four studies indicated that a range of sucrose doses (from a few
drops to 0.5 mL of 24% solution) significantly reduced composite
infant pain scores.
Repeated use, or use in extremely preterm and sick infants has
rarely been addressed (Harrison 2009). Johnston reported that
preterm infants of less than 31 weeks gestational age who were
exposed to more than 10 repeated doses of sucrose a day were
more prone to poorer attention and motor development in early
7

 life (Johnston 2002; Johnston 2007). Other studies have not re-
porteddifferencesbetweensucrose andnon-sucrose groups(Banga
2015; Gaspardo 2008; Stevens 2005b; Taddio 2009a). However,
comprehensive studies evaluating repeated dosing of sucrose for
all painful procedures during hospitalizations of the neonate have
not been undertaken. Concerns regarding the repeated use of su-
crose and cumulative volumes administered during painful proce-
dures in the developing brains of preterm infants have been raised
(Ranger 2014).
Although 24% or 25% sucrose solutions are the most widely used
concentrations for treatment of procedural pain in clinical prac-
tice, there is considerable variation in the volumes of sucrose re-
ported to be effective in diminishing pain, and a more than 20-
fold variation in doses used in clinical practice (Taddio 2009a).
There is currently no clear recommendation regarding the optimal
volume of sucrose for analgesia in infants, or for the use of su-
crose in the presence of opioid analgesia, despite frequent admin-
istration of opioids to infants during their NICU stay (Harrison
2009; Johnston 2011). Ideally the amount of sucrose (mg/kg body
weight) administered should be reported. A critical evaluation of
guidelines for incorporating sucrose as an intervention for pre-
venting or ameliorating procedural pain in infants indicates that
recommendations for practitioners are not clear (Lee 2014). These
knowledge gaps and lack of consistent strategies for effective ap-
plication of knowledge most likely contribute to the current sub-
optimal or non-standardized utilization of sucrose in NICUs.
O B J E C T I V E S
To determine the efficacy, effect of dose, method of administra-
tion and safety of sucrose for relieving procedural pain in neonates
as assessed by validated composite pain scores, physiological pain
indicators (heart rate, respiratory rate, saturation of peripheral
oxygen in the blood, transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide
(gas exchange measured across the skin - TcpO2, TcpCO2), near
infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), electroencephalogram (EEG), or
behavioural pain indicators (cry duration, proportion of time cry-
ing, proportion of time facial actions (e.g. grimace) are present), or
a combination of these and long-term neurodevelopmental out-
comes.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evalu-
ated the effect of sucrose analgesia in newborn infants undergoing
painful procedures. We did not include quasi-randomised trials.
We included only published studies and no abstracts were included
as we have identified discrepancies in numbers of infants enrolled
between abstracts and final publications (Walia 1999) (see Selec-
tion of studies). We did not impose language restrictions.
For the 2013 update, we broadened our inclusion criteria to in-
clude RCTsinwhich the efficacyof sucrose wasassessedduringany
minor painful procedure (i.e. other than heel lance and venipunc-
ture), as well as after repeated doses of sucrose. The same inclusion
criteria were used for this 2016 update.
Types of participants
We included studies that assessed term, preterm, or both term and
preterm neonates, with maximum postnatal age of 28 days after
reaching 40 weeks’ postmenstrual age (PMA).
Types of interventions
Interventions included administration of sucrose via oral syringe,
dropper or in addition to a pacifier for treatment of procedural
pain. For the 2013 update of the review we extended inclusion
criteria to all studies that used sucrose as an intervention for any
acute painful procedure including heel lance, venipuncture, sub-
cutaneous injection, intramuscular injection, arterial puncture,
circumcision, bladder catheterization, insertion of orogastric or
nasogastric tube, and eye examination for retinopathy of prema-
turity (ROP). Control group interventions included breastfeed-
ing, breast milk or milk formula, water (sterile, tap, distilled,
spring), local anaesthetics, pacifier, positioning/containing, facil-
itated tucking, warmth no treatment, and various concentrations
of glucose. For this 2016 update we added echocardiography as
a stressful intervention and laser acupuncture as a control group
intervention.
Types of outcome measures
For this 2016 update we reorganized the outcomes as follows:
Primary outcomes
• Composite pain score: A composite pain score includes
indicators of pain from multiple dimensions (e.g. behavioural
and physical - e.g.PIPP-R). Multidimensional behavioural pain
score: A multidimensional behavioural pain score includes
multiple indicators of pain but from one dimension (e.g.
NFCS). Validated pain scores in this review included the
Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP; Stevens 1996), Revised
PIPP (PIPP-R; Stevens 2014a), Douleur Aiguë du Nouveau-né
Scale (DAN; Carbajal 1997), Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS;
Lawrence 1993), Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS;
Grunau 1987), Neurobehavioural Assessment of Preterm Infants

 (NAPI; Snider 2005), Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation
Scale (N-PASS; Hummel 2010) and the Bernese Pain Scale for
Neonates (BPSN; Cignacco 2004). We did not include the
results for the COMFORTneo Scale in the ’Summary of
findings’ tables (van Dijk 2009), as it has not been fully
validated. We do report on the results from studies that used that
pain scale in the Results section.
• Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (assessed by a
standardized and validated assessment tool, a child
developmental specialist, or both) at 18 to 24 months, or at any
later age in childhood.
Secondary outcomes
Individual behavioural pain indicators:
• cry duration;
• proportion of time crying;
• proportion of time facial actions were present;
• facial actions.
Individual physiological pain indicators:
• heart rate;
• respiratory rate;
• oxygen saturation of the blood;
• TcpO2;
• TcpCO2;
• cortisol level;
• NIRS;
• EEG.
Any adverse effects reported.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We carried
out electronic searchesfor relevant RCTs in MEDLINE (PubMed;
1950 to February 2016), EMBASE (1980 to February 2016),
CINAHL (1982 to February 2016) and the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 1, 2016). Search
terms used in the PubMed search are shown in Appendix 1. Similar
search terms were used in the other databases. One author (AO)
selected the trials for inclusion or exclusion and one other author
(JY) confirmed the selections.
Searching other resources
We searched bibliographies and personal files (BS, JY AO). We
did not include unpublished studies as they have not been peer-
reviewed. We obtained additional information from published
studies if needed. We have listed identified abstracts under ex-
cluded studies. We did not apply any language restrictions. We
searched the ISRCTN database ( www.isrctn.com), the National
Institute of Health Clinical Trials database ( clinicaltrials.gov),
and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP) (
www.who.int/ictrp) in February 2016. One author (AO) selected
the ongoing trials for inclusion and exclusion and another author
(JY) confirmed the selections.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
We did not include abstracts as we have identified discrepancies in
numbers of infants enrolled between abstracts and final publica-
tions (Walia 1999). In the 2013 update and the current 2016 up-
date the types of participants were more clearly defined to include
maximum postnatal age of 28 days after reaching 40 weeks’ PMA.
As sucrose has become more widely evaluated as an analgesic for a
variety of different acute painful procedures, we no longer limited
our search to those studies evaluating pain due to heel lance and
venipuncture.
Data extraction and management
For this 2016 update three reviewers (AO, SH, AS) extracted data
separately using pre designed forms. We compared the data and
resolved differences. We had additional data provided by investi-
gators for four studies we had previously included (Allen 1996;
Harrison 2003; Johnston 1999; Stevens 1999).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Three reviewers (AO, SH, AS), who were not blinded to trial
authors or institutions, assessed the methodological quality of each
study independently. Three authors (BS, JY, AO) have published
trials that were included in this update of the review. For these
trials two authors (SH, AS) did the data abstraction and RoB
assessments.
For this update the following issues were evaluated and entered
into the ’Risk of bias’ tables.
1. Random sequence generation (selection bias): for each
included study, we categorized the risk of selection bias as:
i) low risk - adequate (any truly random process, e.g.
random number table; computer random number generator);
ii) high risk - inadequate (any non-random process, e.g.
odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);
iii) unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided.
2. Allocation concealment (selection bias): for each included
study, we categorized the risk of bias regarding allocation
concealment as:
i) low risk - adequate (e.g. telephone or central
randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque
envelopes);
9

 ii) high risk - inadequate (open random allocation;
unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);
iii) unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided.
3. Blinding (performance bias): for each included study, we
categorized the methods used to blind study personnel from
knowledge of which intervention a participant received. As our
study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded
to the study intervention:
i) low risk - adequate for personnel (a placebo that could
not be distinguished from the active drug was used in the control
group);
ii) high risk - inadequate, personnel aware of group
assignment;
iii) unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided.
4. Blinding (detection bias): for each included study, we
categorized the methods used to blind outcome assessors from
knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our
study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded
to the study intervention.) Blinding was assessed separately for
different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the
methods used with regard to detection bias as:
i) low risk - adequate follow-up was performed with
assessors blinded to group assignment;
ii) high risk - inadequate, assessors were aware of group
assignment at follow-up ;
iii) unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided.
5. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias): for each included
study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of
data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We
noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the
numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with
the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or
exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were
balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where
sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial
authors, we re included missing data in the analyses. We
categorized the methods with respect to the risk of attrition bias
as:
i) low risk - adequate (< 10% missing data);
ii) high risk - inadequate (> 10% missing data);
iii) unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided.
6. Selective reporting (reporting bias): for each included study,
we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome
reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:
i) low risk - adequate (where it was clear that all of the
study’s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of
interest to the review had been reported);
ii) high risk - inadequate (where not all the study’s
prespecified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported
primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest
were reported incompletely and so could not be used; or the
study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have
been expected to have been reported);
iii) unclear risk - no, or unclear, information provided
(the study protocol was not available).
7. Other bias: for each included study, we described any
important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias
(e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the
specific study design, or whether the trial was stopped early due
to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each
study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias
as:
i) low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;
ii) high risk - e.g. investigators were aware of results
before the end of the study; differences exist between abstracts
and final publications of papers concerning the number of
participants enrolled;
iii) unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of
bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors.
If necessary, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias
through undertaking sensitivity analyses.
Quality of evidence
For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) approach in order to assess the quality of the
body of evidence relating to the following primary outcomes for
each of the comparisons listed under Objectives (Guyatt 2011a;
Schünemann 2009):
1. composite pain score
2. long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes (assessed by a
standardized and validated assessment tool, a child
developmental specialist, or both) at 18 to 24 months, or at any
later age in childhood. No study reported on long-term
neurodevelopmental outcomes, and therefore this outcome
could not be included in the GRADE assessment.
We used the RevMan table editor (RevMan 2014), which is based
on GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro 2014), to create ’Summary of
findings’ tables. We produced a summary of the intervention effect
and a measure of quality for each of the main comparisons and
outcomes listed above (if reported) using the GRADE approach
(Guyatt 2011a). The GRADE approach uses five considerations
(study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness
and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence
for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from ’high
quality’ by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious)
limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness
of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates
or potential publication bias. The GRADE approach considers
evidence from RCTs as being of high quality, but this quality
rating may be downgraded on the basis of any of five areas: design
(risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence,
precision of estimates and presence of publication bias (Guyatt
10
Sucrose for analgesia in newborn infants undergoing painful procedures (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 2011a). The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the
quality of a body of evidence as one of four grades explained below.
1. High quality: we are very confident that the true effect lies
close to that of the estimate of the effect. Further research is very
unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
2. Moderate quality: we are moderately confident in the effect
estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the
effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Further research is likely to have an important impact on our
confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
3. Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The
true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the
effect. Further research is very likely to have and important
impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to
change the estimate.
4. Very low: we have very little confidence in the effect
estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from
the estimate of effect. We are very uncertain about the estimate
(Schünemann 2013).
The review authors independently assessed the quality of the ev-
idence found for outcomes identified as critical or important for
clinical decision making, namely: composite pain score. No study
reported on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
When we considered the risk of bias, the presence of inadequate
concealment of allocation or randomised assignment, incomplete
follow-up or unblinded outcome assessment reduced our confi-
dence in the effect estimates, and we downgraded the quality of
evidence accordingly (Guyatt 2011b). We evaluated consistency
by comparing the similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap
of confidence intervals and statistical criteria, including measure-
mentof heterogeneity(I2). We downgradedthe qualityof evidence
when inconsistency across study results was present, large and
unexplained (i.e. some studies suggested important benefit and
others no effect or harm without a clinical explanation) (Guyatt
2011c). We assessed precision according to the 95% confidence
interval around the pooled estimation (Guyatt 2011d). If trials
had been conducted in populations other than the target pop-
ulation, we would have downgraded the quality of evidence be-
cause of indirectness (Guyatt 2011e). Publication bias was not
applicable, as only three or fewer studies were included in each
analysis. We entered data (i.e. pooled estimates of the effects and
corresponding 95% confidence intervals) and made explicit judg-
ments for each of the above aspects assessed in the ’Summary of
findings’ tables. Because of the large number of comparisons (n =
37) and outcomes under each comparison we elected to include
only those comparisons that included outcomes for validated pain
scores (BPSN, DAN, NAPI, NFCS, NIPS, N-PASS, PIPP
, PIPP-
R). All judgements involving the assessment of the study charac-
teristics described above are explained in foot notes or comments
in the ’Summary of findings’ tables.
Measures of treatment effect
We performed statistical analyses using RevMan 5.3 (RevMan
2014). We analyzed categorical data using risk ratio (RR), risk
difference (RD) and the number needed to treat for an addi-
tional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or additional harmful outcome
(NNTH) if the RD was statistically significant. We analyzed con-
tinuous data using mean difference (MD). We reported the 95%
confidence interval (CI) on all estimates. Three authors (AO, SH
and AS) used the formulas reported in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Section 7.7.3.2) to convert
95% confidence intervals to standard deviations (SD) (Higgins
2011; RevMan 2014). Following advice from Dr Michael Bracken
(statistician of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group) we decided
not to convert medians and interquartile or full ranges to means
and SDs.
Unit of analysis issues
We did not identify any cluster randomised trials and so did not
encounter any unit of analysis issues.
Dealing with missing data
Many authors did not report means and SDs for the outcomes. We
transformed 95% CIs to SDs using the techniques described under
Measures of treatment effect. Many studies reported the results
in graph form only, and we could not incorporate the findings in
RevMan-analyses.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We report the I2 statistic for all analyses in which more than one
trial was included. We categorized the heterogeneity using the fol-
lowing labels and cut-offs for the results of the I2 test; less than
25%, no heterogeneity present; 25% to 49%, low heterogeneity;
50% to 74%, moderate heterogeneity; and 75% or more, high
heterogeneity. If we detected statistical heterogeneity, we explored
the possible causes (e.g. differences in study quality, participants
(term or preterm infants), intervention regimens or outcome as-
sessments) using post hoc subgroup analyses.
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned to construct forest plots if there were at least 10 studies
included in one meta-analysis that assessed the same outcome in
comparable trials of the same intervention in the same population,
however, no single meta-analysis fulfilled this criterion.
Data synthesis
We used the statistical package RevMan 5.3 provided by Cochrane
(RevMan 2014). For meta-analyses, we reported a weighted mean
difference (WMD) with 95% CI using a fixed-effect model for
continuous outcome measures if at least two studies were included
in the analysis, otherwise we reported the mean difference (MD).

 For categorical outcomes we reported the typical (if at least two
trials were included) risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and,
if the RD was statistically significant, we planned to report the
NNTB or NNTH. All values were reported with their 95% CIs.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We did not make separate subgroup comparisons for differ-
ent painful/stressful procedures (heel lance, venipuncture, arterial
puncture, subcutaneous injections, pain associated with IM injec-
tions (hepatitis B immunization and injection of vitamin K), blad-
der catheterization, insertion of nasogastric or orogastric tubes,
ROP eye examination, circumcision, and echocardiography exam)
or for multiple procedures.
Sensitivity analysis
Under each comparison for the outcomes we report the results in
the term and the preterm populations separately and combined
these whenever data were available.
R E S U L T S
Description of studies
Two authors (AO, JY) identified an additional 20 studies for inclu-
sion in this current 2016 update through the searches of the liter-
ature (Abbasoglu 2015; Al Qahtani 2014; Asmerom 2013; Banga
2015; Cignacco 2012; Dilli 2014; Gray 2012; Gray 2015; Leng
2013; Leng 2015; Liaw 2011; Liaw 2013; Marin Gabriel 2013;
Milazzo 2011; Pandey 2013; Potana 2015; Simonse 2012; Suhrabi
2014; Thakkar 2016; Tutag Lehr 2015). The flow chart for the
literature searches is shown in Figure 1. In this current update the
authors excluded the study by Scaramuzzo 2013 as it was a quasi-
randomised controlled trial. In addition two studies were classi-
fied as awaiting classification due to a need for translation (Moradi
2012b; Moradi 2012a). One newly identified study was excluded
after translation as the infants were older (mean 8.5 months) than
the accepted age for inclusion in this review (28 days) (Aziznejad
2013). We excluded the study by Fernandez 2003, which was
added at the 2013 update, as it assessed the effects of heel stroke.

 The authors excluded one study that had been included at the
previous 2013 update as they reclassified it as a quasi-randomised
trial (Ozdogan 2010), and excluded another that had previously
been awaiting classification, as the word ’random’ did not appear
anywhere in the text (Akman 2002). The authors identified several
papers as secondary publications to studies, and these are now
listedundertheirprimarystudyreferences, namely: the 2004paper
published by Boyer and co-workers is now listed under Johnston
2002; the Angeles 2015 paper is now listed under Asmerom 2013;
and the Yin 2015 paper is now listed under Liaw 2013. The study
by Singh 2001 is still awaiting classification as we have not been
able to obtain a reprint.
The authors identified a total of 18 ongoing studies for this
2016 update of the review, details are about these are pro-
vided in Characteristics of ongoing studies (Campbell-Yeo
2013; ISRCTN59514984; ISRCTN73259137; NCT02344368;

2014; Philip 2012; Roue 2013; Shah 2015; Stevens 2014).
For the 2013 and 2016 updates of this review, the inclusion criteria
were expanded to include any painful/stressful procedure (rather
than heel lance and venipuncture only), and included studies that
assessed the efficacy of repeated doses of sucrose.
No studies assessing long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes
were identified in the 2013 update nor in this current 2016 up-
date.
Included studies
A total of 74 studies (enrolling 7049 infants) are included in this
systematic review. Thirty-eight of these studies focused on term
infants (Abbasoglu 2015; Allen 1996; Al Qahtani 2014; Altun-
Köro lu 2010; Basnet 2010; Blass 1997; Blass 1999; Carbajal

Thakkar 2016; Tutag Lehr 2015; Unceta-Barranechea 2008;
Yilmaz 2010), while 31 included preterm infants only (Abad 1996;
Acharya 2004; Asmerom 2013; Biran 2011; Boyle 2006; Bucher
1995; Cignacco 2012; Dilli 2014; Elserafy 2009; Gal 2005;

1999; Rush 2005; Simonse 2012; Stevens 1999; Stevens 2005a;
Storm 2002), and five included both preterm and term infants
(Banga 2015; Gibbins 2002; Liaw 2013; Montoya 2009; Potana
2015). Details of each study are outlined in the Characteristics of
included studies table.
The studies were conducted in 22 different countries; USA (17),
Canada (9), UK (9), Turkey (7), India (5), France (3), Spain (3).
In China, Italy, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and Taiwan
two studies were conducted in each country and one study was
conducted in each of Australia, Brasil, Colombia, Denmark, Iran,
Ireland, Japan, Nepal, and the Netherlands.
Each included study is described in the Additional tables, which
are organized according to the type of painful procedure to which
the infants were exposed. As stated in the methods section for this
update, three authors (AO, SH, AS) transcribed 95% CIs to SDs
whenever possible. If authors reported data in such a way that we
could not include the results in RevMan-analyses, we reported the
findings according to the authors in the Additional tables. The
results of 35 studies could not be included in RevMan-analyses
(Abad 1996; Acharya 2004; Allen 1996; Altun-Köro lu 2010;
Blass 1997; Blass 1999; Bucher 1995; Carbajal 1999; Codipietro

Thakkar 2016; Yilmaz 2010).The results of those studies are sum-
marized after the analyses for each comparison.
Painful procedures
Heel lance was the most predominant painful procedure, and
was studied in 38 trials (Abbasoglu 2015; Altun-Köro lu
2010; Asmerom 2013; Blass 1997; Blass 1999; Bucher 1995;
Cignacco 2012; Codipietro 2008; Gibbins 2002; Gormally 2001;

Stevens 2005a; Storm 2002; Thakkar 2016; Tutag Lehr 2015;
Unceta-Barranechea 2008; Yilmaz 2010; Örs 1999) (Table 1). In
nine studies, infants were observed during venipuncture (Abad
1996; Acharya 2004; Basnet 2010; Biran 2011; Carbajal 1999;
Elserafy 2009; Gaspardo 2008; Montoya 2009; Taddio 2011)
(Table 2). One study assessed both heel lance and venipuncture
(Ogawa 2005) (Table 3), while another assessed arterial punc-
ture (Milazzo 2011) (Table 4). In two studies, infants were as-
sessed during subcutaneous injections (Allen 1996; Mucignat
2004) (Table 5), and in four studies during intramuscular injec-
tion (immunization for hepatitis B) (Gray 2012; Gray 2015; Liaw
14

 2011; Suhrabi 2014) (Table 6). One study assessed infants dur-
ing bladder catheterization (Rogers 2006) (Table 7), and three
studies assessed infants during nasogastric or orogastric tube in-
sertion (Kristoffersen 2011; McCullough 2008; Pandey 2013)
(Table 8). Seven studies assessed infants undergoing an examina-
tion for ROP (Boyle 2006; Dilli 2014; Gal 2005; Grabska 2005;
Mitchell 2004; O’Sullivan 2010; Rush 2005) (Table 9), while four
studies involved circumcision (Al Qahtani 2014; Herschel 1998;
Kaufman 2002; Stang 1997) (Table 10). Three studies assessed
multiple painful procedures (Banga 2015; Johnston 2002; Taddio
2008) (Table 11). One trial assessed stress during echocardiogra-
phy (Potana 2015) (Table 12).
Twenty-nine studies evaluated adverse effects.
Risk of bias in included studies
The studies we included enrolled between 15 and 671 infants.
Forty-eight studies (65%) enrolled < 100 infants. The largest study
enrolled 671 term infants, who were randomised to four groups
(Leng 2015); sucrose, sucrose + non-nutritive sucking (NNS),
sucrose + swaddling, and sucrose + NNS + swaddling. The second
largest study enrolled 560 infants (Leng 2013), but we could not
include data for sucrose versus sterile water for increase in heart
rate and decrease in oxygen saturation at three minutes after heel
lance in RevMan-analyses, as they were reported as means and full
ranges.
Few researchers provided a definition of pain or how it was con-
ceptualised in relation to the outcomes. There were differences
in study methods. Heel lance was studied as the pain stimulus in
the majority of studies, however, little detail about this procedure
(e.g. manual versus automated lance) was provided. Therefore, it
is impossible to know if the painful stimuli were comparable in in-
tensity, duration or frequency across studies. The length of infant
observation following the heel lance was infrequently reported,
and may have implications for the incidence of reported adverse
effects.
The delivery method of sucrose differed between studies (syringe,
dropper or sucrose-dipped pacifier), as did the concentrations of
sucrose and the volume used. Outcomes were reported inconsis-
tently; as means with SDs, standard errors (SE) or 95% CIs, or
medians with ranges and often in graphic form without reporting
of numerical data.
The risk of bias is reported in the ’Risk of bias’ graph (Figure 2)
and the ’Risk of bias’ summary (Figure 3).

 Allocation
Forty-three studies (58%) reported an adequately generated allo-
cation sequence, however, in the remaining 31 studies (42%) it
was unclear how the random sequence was generated. In 33 stud-
ies (45%) the allocation was adequately concealed. There was a
high risk of bias for allocation concealment in 19 studies (26%),
and an unclear risk of bias in 22 studies (30%).
Blinding
There was a low risk of performance bias in 42 studies (57%) and
a high risk in 22 studies (30%). There was an unclear risk of bias
in the remaining 10 studies (14%).
There was a low risk of detection bias in 49 studies (66%), a high
risk in 12 studies (16%), and an unclear risk in the remaining 13
studies (18%).
Incomplete outcome data
There was a low risk of attrition bias in 58 studies (78%), a high
risk in three studies (4%), and an unclear risk in the remaining 13
studies (18%).
Selective reporting
The protocols for eight studies (11%) were available to us, these
had a low risk of reporting bias. The risk of reporting bias was
unclear for the remaining 66 studies (89%).
Other potential sources of bias
Other potential bias was detected in one study (1%) in which
there wasunequal distributionof allocatedandreceivedtreatments
amongst injected infants (Mucignat 2004): NNS = 41, eutectic
mixture of local anaesthetic (EMLA; a topical mixture of lidocaine
(2.5%) and prilocaine (2.5%) cream) = 71, sucrose = 86, EMLA +
sucrose = 67. The risk of bias was unclear in three studies (4%), and
we did not detect other bias in the remaining 70 studies (95%).

icant difference in the PIPP scores between the sucrose and the
water groups; MD -1.42 (95% CI -2.86 to 0.01); I2 = 51 % (mod-
erate: Analysis 2.1). For term infants the PIPP score was signifi-
cantly lower in the sucrose group; MD -2.70 (95% CI -4.96 to -

Secondary outcomes
Duration of first cry (s) (Outcome 2.6)
One study reported on 32 term infants (Mathai 2006), and an-
other reported on 110 preterm infants (Harrison 2003). When
the two groups of infants (term and preterm) were combined (n =
142) there was no significant difference in duration of first cry (s)
in the sucrose group compared with the water group; MD -8.63
(-19.88 to 2.61); I2 = 46.0% (low heterogeneity; Analysis 2.6). In
the study performed in term infants (n = 32) there was no signif-
icant difference in the crying time (s) between the sucrose group
compared with the water group; MD -5.00 (95% CI -17.40 to
7.40). In preterm infants (n =110) there was no significant differ-
ence between the duration of first cry (s) between the sucrose and
the water groups; MD -25.41 (95% CI -52.06 to 1.24).

(s) in the sucrose group than the water group; MD -22.11 (95% CI
-32.52 to -11.70; Analysis 2.7). There was moderate heterogeneity
for this outcome; I2 = 59%.

pared with the water group; WMD 0.90 (95% CI -5.81 to 7.61;
Analysis 2.9). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome; I2 =
86%. The high heterogeneity could be explained by the very dif-
ferent results for the two studies; the Haouari 1995 study showed
a significant increase in percentage change in heart rate; MD 9.90
(95% CI 0.41 to 19.39), whereas the Isik 2000a study showed a

2016; Yilmaz 2010); for details see Table 1, though a brief sum-
mary is provided below.
In the Altun-Köro lu 2010 study there were no statistically sig-
nificant differences observed between the hind milk group and
the sucrose group for all measures. In Blass 1997 there was sig-
nificantly less crying time during blood collection in the sucrose
group than in the water group, and, in the later Blass 1999 study,
sucrose diminished cry duration compared to water. In Bucher
1995 cry duration was significantly reduced by sucrose compared
to water. In Codipietro 2008 the duration of first cry was shorter in
the breastfeeding group than the sucrose group, as were the PIPP
scores (two minutes after heel lance). Gormally 2001 reported a
significant effect of holding on pain concatenation scores for facial
activity, with no difference between infants who received sucrose
and those who did not. Johnston 1997 found a significant de-
crease in percentage facial action in the sucrose alone group and
the sucrose plus rocking group compared to the water group. In
the large study, Leng 2013, the average pain score three minutes
after the procedure was significantly lower in the sucrose groups
compared to the glucose groups. Liaw 2013 found that infants re-
ceiving NNS + oral sucrose + tucking or NNS + oral sucrose expe-
rienced more quiet sleep occurrences than those receiving routine
care. Marin Gabriel 2013 reported a significantly lower percentage
of crying with both the breast fed + skin-to-skin contact group and
also the sucrose + skin-to-skin contact group compared with the
skin-to-skin contact group. In Okan 2007 the sucrose and glucose
groups showed a shorter time for the duration of first cry and total
crying time than the water group. In Overgaard 1999 the NIPS
scores one minute after heel lance and one minute after blood
sampling were statistically significantly lower in the sucrose group

 than the water group. Ramenghi 1996a noted lower mean pain
scores in the group receiving sucrose at one and two minutes after
heel lance compared to the water group. In Ramenghi 1996b the
pain scores were significantly lower in the sucrose (25% and 50%)
groups and the Calpol group compared to the water group. In
the third study by the Ramenghi group (Ramenghi 1999), which
was a cross-over study (sucrose and water were given by naso-
gastric tube or intraorally, but the infant received either sucrose
or water both times), significant reductions in behavioural scores
were noted in the sucrose group compared with the water group.
It is notable that infants in the 25% sucrose group displayed a
significant reduction in behavioural score (P value 0.001) when
sucrose was given intraorally compared to via a nasogastric tube.
Rushforth 1993 used a low concentration of sucrose (7.5%) and
found no difference in median percentage crying time between the
sucrose group and the group that received water. In Stevens 2005a
66 infants were randomised to (1) standard of care (positioning
+ swaddling), (2) standard of care, sterile water via syringe and
pacifier or (3) standard of care, 24% sucrose via syringe and paci-
fier two minutes prior to painful interventions during the first 28
days of life. PIPP scores were recorded at day 7, 14, 21, and 28 at
routine heel lance. There was a significant main effect of group (P
= 0.03) with differences occurring between the sucrose + pacifier
group and standard care group at pain assessment at 60 s ( P value
0.01). Mean PIPP scores were generally higher in the standard care
group. Storm 2002 reported significantly less crying in infants in
the groups that received sucrose (25%) or sucrose (25%) + milk
compared to the groups that received a lower concentration of su-
crose (15%) or milk. Thakkar 2016 reported lower median PIPP
scores in the sucrose + NNS group compared to the sucrose only,
NNS only, or no intervention groups. Yilmaz 2010 reported that
the mean crying time in the sucrose group was lower than in the
groups where the infant was sitting on the mother’s lap, received
mother’s milk by syringe, or was given a pacifier. Örs 1999 noted
that there was a significant decrease in crying time for the sucrose
group compared to the human milk or sterile water groups, and
recovery time from crying was shorter in the sucrose group, as was

Results from five studies could not be included in RevMan-anal-
yses, but are described in a narrative here. Abad 1996 reported
shorter cry duration three minutes after venipuncture in the su-
crose (24%) group compared to the sucrose (12%) group and
the water group. In Acharya 2004 the duration of first cry was
shorter in infants who received sucrose, as was total duration of
crying. Mean change in heart rate from pre procedure to proce-
dure and post procedure was lower in the infants who received
sucrose. Changes in mean NFCS scores were significantly lower in

 the sucrose group than in the water group from pre procedure to
the procedure phase and the post procedure phase. Carbajal 1999
reported lower DAN scores in the groups that received glucose,
sucrose, pacifier, or sucrose + pacifier compared to water. There
was a trend towards lower pain scores for infants receiving sucrose
with a pacifier compared to a pacifier alone. In the Elserafy 2009
cross-over study every infant received each of six different regimens
during a maximum stay of 15 days. Sucrose + pacifier resulted in
the lowest pain (PIPP) scores. The sucrose groups had significantly
lower crying times compared to the other groups. Gaspardo 2008
(listed under additional table Table 11) studied different phases
of venipuncture on different days. All significant results favoured
the sucrose group. On day 2 the percentage of neonates crying
showed a significant difference between the sucrose and control
groups in the antisepsis phase and puncture phases. On day 3,
there was a significant difference between groups in the percent-
age of neonates crying in the dressing phase. On day 4, signifi-
cant differences existed between groups at the puncture phase. A
significant difference in the NFCS ≥ 3 was seen between sucrose
and control groups on day 2 at the puncture phase, and on day 3
a significant difference was observed at the antisepsis phase. There
was a significant difference in the percentage of neonates with ac-
tive behavioural state (ABS) score ≥ 4 between sucrose and con-
trol groups on day 2 at the puncture phase, and on day 4 at the
antisepsis phase.

Effectiveness of sucrose for subcutaneous injection
Two reports studied the effects of sucrose for subcutaneous injec-
tion (Allen 1996, Mucignat 2004). Neither of the studies reported
the results in a way that permitted the use of data in RevMan-

In the Allen 1996 study two-week old infants who received either
sterile water or sucrose solution cried significantly less than infants
who received no intervention (P < 0.005). Mucignat 2004 found
significant reductions in DAN and NFCS scores in the EMLA +
NNS, sucrose + NNS, and sucrose + EMLA + pacifier groups.

One study reported on 60 infants (Al Qahtani 2014). There was
a significantly higher N-PASS score (indicating more pain) in the
sucrose vs the EMLA group; MD 3.00 (95% CI 2.42 to 3.58;
Analysis 33.1).
N-PASS score after five minutes (Outcome 33.2)
One study reported on 60 infants (Al Qahtani 2014). There was
a significantly higher N-PASS score (indicating more pain) after
five minutes in the sucrose group compared to the EMLA group;
MD 1.20 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.91; Analysis 33.2).
Secondary outcomes
Heart rate (beats/minute) during circumcision (Outcome
33.3)
One study reported on 60 infants (Al Qahtani 2014). There was a
significantly higher heart rate (beats/minute) in the sucrose group
compared to the EMLA group; MD 12.00 (95% CI 06.62 to
17.38; Analysis 33.3).
Repiratory rate (breaths/minute) during circumcision
(Outcome 33.4) Analysis 33.4
One studyreportedon60infants(Al Qahtani 2014). There wasno
significant difference in respiratory rate (cycles/minute) between
the sucrose group and the EMLA group; MD 0.60 cycles/minute
(95% CI -1.77 to 2.97; Analysis 33.4).
Oxygen saturation (%) during circumcision (Outcome 33.5)
One study reported on 60 infants (Al Qahtani 2014). There was a
significantly lower percentage of oxygen saturation in the sucrose
group compared to the EMLA group; MD -3.40 (95% CI -4.39
to -2.41; Analysis 33.5).
Sucrose (50%) on a premature nipple, with a 2 x 2 cm sterile
gauze pad inside the nipple moistened by the fluid versus

Secondary outcomes
Change in heart rate (beats/minute) from baseline (Outcome
34.1)
One study reported on 79 infants (Herschel 1998). There was a
significantly greater change in heart (rate beats/minute) in the su-
crose group than in the DPNB group (favours the DPNB group);
MD 17.40 (95% CI 11.16 to 23.64; Analysis 34.1).

 Secondary outcomes
Mean plasma cortisol levels n mol/dL (Outcome 35.2)
One study reported on 40 infants (Stang 1997). There was no
significant difference in the mean plasma cortisol levels (n mol/
dL) in the sucrose + DPNB group compared with the water +
DPNB group; MD 68.90 (-53.93 to 191.73; Analysis 35.2).
Data from one study could not be used in RevMan-analyses
(Kaufman 2002); for details see Table 10. In this study the over-
all, mean crying time was significantly decreased in infants treated
with sucrose compared to infants treated with water (P value
0.0001). Infants in the Gomco clamp + sucrose group spent sig-
nificantly less time grimacing (P value 0.0001) compared to the
Gomco clamp +water group.
Effectiveness of sucrose for stress during
echocardiography
Sucrose (24%) versus no medication/placebo (Comparison
36)
Primary outcomes
PIPP score (Outcome 36.1) Analysis 36.1
One study reported on 104 infants (Potana 2015). The PIPP score
in the sucrose group was significantly lower compared with the
group that got no intervention or placebo; MD -2.15 (95% CI -
3.30 to -1.00; Analysis 36.1).
This was the only study we identified that used sucrose during
echocardiography.
Effectiveness of sucrose for potentially painful
procedures for seven days after enrolment
Sucrose (24%) versus water (Comparison 37)
Primary outcomes
Motor development and vigor (MDV) domain of the NAPI
tool at 40 weeks PMA (Outcome 37.1)
One study reported on 93 infants who had been given sucrose or
water for every potentially painful procedure for seven days after
enrolment in the study (Banga 2015). There was no significant
difference in the MDV domain of the NAPI tool between the
sucrose and the water groups; MD -1.83 (95% CI -8.59 to 4.93;
Analysis 37.1).
Alertness and orientation (AO) domain of the NAPI tool at 40
weeks PMA (Outcome 37.2)
One study reported on 93 infants who had been given sucrose or
water for every potentially painful procedure for seven days after
enrolment in the study (Banga 2015). There was no significant
difference in the AO domain of the NAPI tool between the sucrose
and the water groups; MD 3.09 (95% CI -6.49 to 12.67; Analysis
37.2).
The results from the Taddio 2008 study are included under the
heel lance and intramuscular injection sections.
The results of the Gaspardo 2008 and Johnston 2002 studies could
not be included in RevMan-analyses. See Table 11 for details.
In the Gaspardo 2008 study the neonates were evaluated dur-
ing blood collection each morning. The assessment was divided
into five phases: baseline, antisepsis, puncture, dressing, and recov-
ery. The neonates’ facial activity (NFCS), behavioural state, and
heart rate were evaluated. The data analysis used cut-off scores for
painful and distressed responses. Significantly fewer neonates in
the sucrose group than the control group exhibited facial actions
that signalled pain during the puncture phase and the antisep-
sis phase. Significantly fewer neonates in the sucrose group cried
during the antisepsis phase, the puncture phase, and the dressing
phase. There was no statistical difference between groups for phys-
iological response. The efficacy of sucrose was maintained for pain
relief in preterm neonates with no side effects.
Johnston 2002 reported that on the basis of analysis of covari-
ance with PMA at birth and the number of invasive procedures
as covariates, there were no group differences (between sucrose
and water) for any of the secondary outcomes of Neuro-Biological
Risk Scores (NBRS) at two weeks; postnatal age (P = 0.426) or at
discharge (P = 0.965). In the sucrose group only, higher number
of doses of sucrose predicted lower scores on motor development
and vigor, and alertness and orientation at 36 weeks’, lower mo-
tor development and vigor at 40 weeks’, and higher NBRS at 2
weeks’ postnatal age. Higher number of invasive procedures was
predictive of higher NBRS both times in the water group.
No significant differences found between the sucrose and wa-
ter groups for Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant
(NAPI).
Effects of sucrose on long-term neurodevelopmental
outcomes
We identified no studies that reported on long-term neurodevel-
opmental outcomes (assessed by a standardized and validated as-
sessment tool, a child developmental specialist, or both) at 18 to
24 months or at any later age in childhood.

 Adverse effects
Inthe previousupdate (Stevens 2013), 16studiesevaluatedadverse
effects of sucrose compared to placebo (Ramenghi 1996a; Carbajal
1999; Stevens 1999; Guala 2001; Gibbins 2002; Acharya 2004;
Gal 2005; Grabska 2005; Stevens 2005a; Rogers 2006; Codipietro
2008; McCullough 2008; Taddio 2008; O’Sullivan 2010; Biran
2011; Taddio 2011). Six of these studies observed minor side
effects in infants (Gibbins 2002; Grabska 2005; Stevens 2005a;
McCullough 2008; Taddio 2008; O’Sullivan2010). Gibbins 2002
described minor adverse effects in six infants, none of which oc-
curred in the sucrose + pacifier group. One neonate who received
water with pacifier choked when the water was administered but
stabilized within 10 s. Three infants randomised to the sucrose
group and two infants randomised to the water + pacifier groups
experienced oxygen desaturation when the study intervention (su-
crose or water) was administered. Each neonate recovered spon-
taneously with no medical intervention required. Grabska 2005
confirmed choking and oxygen desaturation as possible adverse
effects of administering sucrose for pain. McCullough 2008 re-
ported that there was no significant difference between the sucrose
and control groups with regard to adverse effects; the investigators
observed brief apnoea or self-limiting bradycardia in some infants,
but none required clinical intervention. Stevens 2005a reported
that the adverse events related to repeated use of sucrose over the
first 28 days of life were ’low’ and all immediate adverse events
resolved spontaneously. Taddio 2008 reported no significant dif-
ferences between groups in blood glucose levels monitored dur-
ing the study, as well as the incidence of spitting up the sucrose
solution. Lastly, O’Sullivan 2010 reported that four neonates in
the water group and one in the sucrose group experienced oxygen
desaturation or bradycardia.
In this current 2016 update we included 20 newly identified stud-
ies and evaluated adverse effects in 13 of them. Dilli 2014 did not
notice any choking episode or vomiting in any of the study infants.
Gray 2012 observed no adverse events or side effects from the brief
exposure to a heat source or change in the infants’ ambient temper-
ature, and did not mention any adverse effects related to sucrose.
The Tutag Lehr 2015 study assessed a number of adverse events
including gagging, choking, and vomiting and noted that only one
infant in the sucrose group experienced a mild episode of ’spitting
up’. Thakkar 2016 reported on a total of five episodes of adverse
events in all four groups. One neonate each in the sucrose group,
the NNS group and the sucrose + NNS group desaturated, while
twoneonatesdesaturatedinthe nointervention group. Leng 2015;
Marin Gabriel 2013, Milazzo 2011, Pandey 2013, and Simonse
2012 noted no adverse events in any infant. Potana 2015 reported
no episode of hyperglycaemia, necrotizing enterocolitis, or feed
intolerance after sucrose administration. Abbasoglu 2015 stated
that no child developed any clinically visible changes on the skin,
and that no side effects were observed in their comparison of laser
acupuncture with oral sucrose. Banga 2015 reported that there was
no significant difference in the frequency of adverse effects (fall
in heart rate or oxygen saturation) across the two groups (sucrose
and water).
Seven newly included studies did not report on adverse effects (Al
Qahtani 2014; Asmerom 2013; Cignacco 2012; Leng 2013; Liaw
2013; Suhrabi 2014; Gray 2015). In the current review, it would
appear that researchers are being much more vigilant in observing
and reporting adverse events. The proportion of minor adverse
events remains very low with no major adverse events reported.

Summary of main results
Below we report for each painful procedure the results from the
’Summary of findings’ tables. In those tables we included only
results from the most validated pain assessment scales (DAN,
NFCS, NIPS, N-PASS, domains of NAPI, PIPP
, PIPP-R and To-
tal Bernese Pain Scale for Neonates) and provide GRADE assess-
ments for the quality of the evidence. In brief paragraphs we sum-
marize the results from outcomes that could be included in anal-
yses in RevMan and provide short comments on the results from
studies that could not be included in the RevMan-analyses.
As shown in Figure 1, results from only 39 of the 74 included
studies could be included in RevMan-analyses, and the remaining
studies are included in narrative qualitative syntheses.
The largest study included in any analysis was Leng 2015, which
reported on 342 infants, and the two meta analyses with the largest
numbers of participants included 278 infants (3 studies) (Figure
4) and 232 infants (2 groups of infants from one study) (Figure
7).
Heel lance
Heel lance was the most common painful procedure and was in-
cluded in 38 studies. There was moderate quality evidence that
sucrose (20% to 30%) compared with water significantly reduced
NIPS scores during heel lance (indicating less pain with sucrose).
No significant differences were noted in PIPP scores at 30 s or 60
s after heel lance, or during heel lance. There was no difference
in DAN scores 30 s after heel lance (Summary of findings for the
main comparison).
Sucrose (24%) was a more effective analgesic than breastfeeding
(low quality evidence) (Summary of findings 2).
For sucrose (24%) + NNS compared with water + NNS, or pacifier
dipped in sucrose compared with pacifier dipped in water there
was high quality evidence that PIPP scores at 30 s (Figure 4) and
60 s (Figure 5) were significantly reduced (indicating less pain) and
that the NFCS score was non-significantly reduced (Summary of
findings 3).
Nosignificantdifference wasfoundbetweensucrose (24%)+ NNS
+ NIDCAP compared with breast milk (by breastfeeding or by
syringe) (low quality evidence) (Summary of findings 4; Summary
of findings 5).
There was low quality evidence that sucrose was more effective
than laser acupuncture in reducing heel lance-associated pain (
Summary of findings 6).
There was moderate quality evidence that sucrose (24%) + NNS or
sucrose (24%) + swaddling or sucrose (24%) + NNS + swaddling
were more effective than sucrose alone to reduce pain associated
with heel lance (Summary of findings 7; Summary of findings 8;
Summary of findings 9).
Many studies that could not be included in RevMan-analyses, or
reported on outcomes other than validated pain assessment scores
supported these findings (see summary in the results section).
Sucrosein concentrations of 20% to30% reduces compositeand multi-
dimensionalbehaviouralpain scores,as wellas individualbehavioural
and physiological pain indicators associated with heel lance. Other
pain reducing interventions such as NNS and swaddling in associa-
tion with sucrose provides further pain relief.
Venipuncture
Venipuncture was the painful intervention in nine studies. In addi-
tion one study assessed both heel lance and venipuncture (Ogawa
2005), but results were reported separately for the two interven-
tions and we present the results under the two different headings
(heel lance and venipuncture).
There was moderate quality evidence that sucrose (12% to 12.5%)
versus water had no significant effect on the NIPS score (Summary
of findings 12).
There was high quality evidence that the PIPP score was signifi-
cantly lower in the sucrose group (24% to 30%) than the sterile
water group during venipuncture (Summary of findings 13).
Comparison of sucrose (24% to 30%) versus sucrose (24% to
30%) + EMLA/liposomal lidocaine cream on the skin showed that
the DAN scores during venipuncture and the recovery period were
significantly higher (indicating more pain) in the sucrose group
(moderate quality evidence). There were no significant differences
in the PIPP scores at the same time points (Summary of findings
14).
The studies that could not be included in RevMan-analyses or re-
ported outcomes using other non-validated pain assessment scores
supported these findings (see summary in the results section) in-
cluding lower DAN scores, NFCS scores and shorter durations of
crying.
Sucrose (24% to 30%) reduces composite and multidimensional be-
havioural pain scores and cry variables associated with venipuncture.
Arterial puncture
Arterial puncture was the painful intervention in one trial that
reported on 47 infants (Milazzo 2011). There was no significant
difference between the groups in the physiological outcomes mea-
sured; heart rate (beats/minute) or oxygen saturation after needle
insertion, or one minute after the procedure. This one small study
might have lacked power to ascertain a true difference.
Currently there is lack of evidence for or against the use of sucrose for
arterial puncture.
Effectiveness of sucrose for pain during subcutaneous
injections
Subcutaneous injection was studied in two trials (Allen 1996;
Mucignat 2004). The results could not be included in RevMan-
81

 analyses. Allen 1996 found that sucrose decreased the percentage
of time that two-week-old infants spent crying. Mucignat 2004
found that crying time was significantly lower in the sucrose +
EMLA + pacifier group. There was a significant reduction in DAN
and NFCS scores in the EMLA + NNS, sucrose + NNS, and
sucrose + EMLA + pacifier groups compared to NNS alone.
There is not sufficient evidence to judge whether sucrose is beneficial
or not for reducing pain associated with subcutaneous injections.

There was low quality evidence that sucrose (20% to 25%) versus
water or no intervention significantly lowers NIPS scores during
the one to two minutes after immunization (Summary of findings
15).
There was high quality evidence that PIPP scores during intra-
muscular injections were significantly lower (indicating less pain)
in the sucrose group than the water group for infants born to both
non-diabetic and diabetic mothers (Summary of findings 15).
For sucrose (25%) versus glucose (25%) there was no significant
difference in the NIPS score one to two minutes after immuniza-
tion (low quality evidence) (Summary of findings 16).
Data from one trial could not be entered in RevMan-analyses.
Gray 2012 showed that providing warmth during immunization
for hepatitis B decreased crying and grimacing as much as sucrose
or a pacifier did, and in a similar study, Gray 2015, showed that
infants exposed to sucrose + warmth cried significantly less and
grimaced less compared to the infants who received sucrose only.
There is some high quality evidence that sucrose reduces pain associ-
ated with intramuscular injections. Adding a body warmer to admin-
istration of sucrose may provide further pain relief. Further research
is recommended for that co-intervention.
Bladder catheterization
The painful intervention of bladder catheterization was reported
in one study. There was a significantly smaller change in the DAN
score in the sucrose group than the water group, and the number
of infants crying at maximal catheter insertion was significantly
lower in the sucrose group (moderate quality evidence) (Summary
of findings 17).
Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of sucrose to reduce
pain during bladder catheterization.
Orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion
Orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion was studied in three trials.
Although the sample size wassmall,there washigh qualityevidence
from one trial of a significantly lower PIPP score 30 s after the
procedure in the sucrose (24%) group than in the water group, but
no difference in PIPP score during the procedure or one minute
after the procedure (Summary of findings 18).
Two studies of nasogastric tube insertion could not be included
in RevMan-analyses (Kristoffersen 2011; McCullough 2008).
Kristoffersen 2011 found that pacifier + 30% sucrose provided
the most effective pain reduction (P value < 0.001 versus no treat-
ment). The highest pain score was for infants in the sterile water
group. McCullough 2008 reported that the sucrose group had a
significant lower median NFCS score during NG tube insertion
compared with the water group.
Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of sucrose to reduce
pain during orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion.
ROP examination
ROP examinations were studied in seven trials.
There was no significant difference in the PIPP score between
groups for sucrose (24%) by syringe + swaddled + pacifier com-
pared with water by syringe + swaddled + pacifier (low quality
evidence) (Summary of findings 19).
The pooling of three studies revealed a significant reduction in
the PIPP score for the sucrose group when sucrose (24% to 33%;
sucrose ± NNS) was compared with water (water ± NNS). There
was a significant reduction in the crying time in the sucrose +
NNS group (moderate quality evidence) (Summary of findings
20) (Figure 8).
There is limited evidence that sucrose may confer some pain relief when
combined with other pain reducing interventions. Further research
on sucrose in combination with other pain reducing interventions is
required.
Circumcision
Circumcision was studied in four trials.
For sucrose (24%) versus EMLA there was a significantly higher
N-PASS score (indicating more pain for sucrose) during circum-
cision and 5 minutes after circumcision. The heart rate (beats/
minute) was significantly higher and the oxygen saturation was
significantly lower in the sucrose group during circumcision (low
quality evidence) (Summary of findings 21).
For sucrose (24%) versus EMLA + sucrose (24%) there were sig-
nificantly higher N-PASS scores in the sucrose only group during
circumcision and five minutes after circumcision (low quality evi-
dence) (Summary of findings 22). During circumcision the heart
rate (beats/minute) was significantly higher and the oxygen satu-
ration significantly lower in the sucrose only group.
Secondary outcomes
When a pacifier dipped in 24% sucrose + DPNB was compared
with a pacifier dipped in water + DNPB there was a significantly
lower behavioural score in the group that received sucrose. There
82

 was no significant difference in the mean plasma cortisol levels
between the groups.
When sucrose (50%) solution on a premature nipple, with a 2 x 2
cm gauze pad inside the nipple moistened by fluid was compared
with DPNB there was an increase (indicating more pain) in heart
rate (beats/minute) in the sucrose group.
Based on low quality of evidence the use of sucrose alone is insufficient
for pain relief from circumcision.
Echocardiography
The stress/painassociatedwith echocardiographyexamination was
reported in one low-quality evidence study. The mean PIPP score
was significantly lower in the sucrose group compared with the no
intervention group (Summary of findings 23).
The use of sucrose during echocardiography deserves further study.
Potentially painful procedures for seven days after
study entry
One high-quality evidence study reported on two domains of the
NAPI score; motor development and vigor (MDV) and alert-
ness and orientation (AO). The potentially painful procedures in-
cluded; venipuncture, heel lance, peripheral venous catheteriza-
tion, orogastric or nasogastric tube insertion, intramuscular injec-
tion, suprapubic bladder tap, ROP examination and removal of
adhesive tapes.
There were no significant differences in these two domains be-
tween the sucrose (24%) and water groups at 40 weeks PMA.
Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes
Long-termneurodevelopmental outcomeswere notassessedinany
of the included studies.
Adverse effects
Adverse effects were evaluated in 29 studies and in most no side
effects were reported. Minor, rare and untoward events included
’spitting up’, oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, choking, and brief
apnoea. Most of these occurred in both the sucrose and the control
groups and were self-resolved. One study that measured blood
glucose levels did not find any significant difference between the
sucrose and the water group (Taddio 2008).
Adverse effects following the short term use of sucrose are currently not
a concern.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Although sucrose has been studied in 74 trials that included 7049
infants, the large variation in painful procedures, dose of sucrose
(concentration and volume), co-interventions in the comparison
groups, assessment tools used and differences in the population
(term or preterm infants) resulted in a large number of RevMan-
analyses that include one or few trials. There were few infants
included for each comparison and each outcome, which weakens
our ability to draw firm conclusions. However, if the effectiveness
of sucrose for a specific intervention were measured by a variety
of instruments, and the results showed a similar reduction, this
would strengthen the results and the conclusions.
To date, the best studied use of sucrose is for heel lance, venipuncture
and intramuscular injections and for these interventions sucrose ap-
pears to offer pain relief.
Sucrose does not seem to relieve the pain associated circumcision ade-
quately and there is no strong indication that further studies are in-
dicated. For pain/stress associate with arterial puncture, subcutaneous
injection, bladder catheterization, orogastric or nasogastric tube in-
sertion, ROP examination and echocardiography examination fur-
ther research is warranted. For these procedures, we would recommend
that if trials are done, a rescue dose should be available for infants in
obvious distress, where the sucrose alone does not seem to be effective
in preventing moderate to severe pain.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence varied from low to high and for
each of the painful interventions and comparisons the quality of
the evidence is reported in separate ’Summary of findings’ tables
(Summary of findings for the main comparison to Summary of
findings 24). We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials re-
ported in abstract form only. We could include only a few studies
for most comparisons and outcomes. For most outcomes we in-
cluded the results of a single study only, and so tests for hetero-
geneity were not applicable. The main reasons for our inability
to include study results in RevMan-analyses were that the results
were not presented as means and SDs or were presented in graph
form only.
By early February 2016, we had identified 74 RCTs that tested
the effectiveness of sucrose in reducing stress or pain associated
with common, potentially painful procedures in neonates. These
studies reported on 7049 neonates. Most studies had a small sam-
ple size: the sample sizes ranged from 15 to 671 infants, and 48
studies reported on fewer than 100 infants.
Potential biases in the review process
We are not aware of any biases in the review process. Two authors
(AO, JY) selected the trials from the literature searches and there
was complete agreement. One author (AO) abstracted data and
filled in pre designed forms for ’Risk of bias’ assessments and data
abstraction, transformed 95% CIs to SDs and two authors (SH,
AS) checked the data abstraction and transformation of data. Any
discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus. Three

 authors (BS, JY, AO) are coauthors of some included trials. For
these trials two authors (SH, AS) did the data abstraction and RoB
assessments. One author (BS) is the developer of the PIPP and
PIPP-R measure.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
In our previous versions of this review (Stevens 2001; Stevens
2004; Stevens 2010; Stevens 2013), we reported inconsistency in
effective sucrose dosage, although we identified studies in which
the dose ranged from 0.012 g to 0.12 g. Johnston 1997 and Stevens
1999 identified that very small volumes of 24% sucrose (estimated
at 0.01 g to 0.02 g) significantly reduced pain. However, the meta-
analyses in Stevens 1997a showed 0.18 g sucrose was ineffective
in reducing crying and did not differ from the control solution
(water). Doses of 0.24 g or more were more effective; there was
some additional benefit of administering 0.48 g to 0.50 g sucrose,
but effectiveness did not increase when sucrose doses greater than
0.50 g were administered. In this updated review, a significant
reduction in PIPP scores was demonstrated with sucrose doses
between 0.012 g to 0.12 g (0.05 mL to 0.5 mL of 24% sucrose
solution) at 30 and 60 seconds after heel lance and 0.12 g (0.5
mL) prior to ROP examinations. In these studies, there was a one-
to two-point reduction in the PIPP score. Shah 2004 reported
that clinicians and researchers consider a 20% reduction in pain
to be the minimal clinically important difference, although other
researchers suggest a 10% reduction may suffice (Powell 2001).
Lemyre 2006 used a three-point reduction on the PIPP scale as
being clinically meaningful; however, a rationale for this decision
was not reported. Determining the level of clinical improvement
is challenging in infants, given their inability to self-report their
pain and the level of improvement that could make significant
differences either in treatment strategy or the affective component
of pain (i.e. how bad pain makes you feel).
The greatest analgesic effect occurs when sucrose is administered
approximately two minutes before the painful stimulus. This in-
terval isthoughttocoincide with the release of endogenous opioids
(Blass 1994). Johnston 1999 reported increased analgesia when
sucrose solution was repeatedly administered in small aliquots (i.e.
0.05 mL of 24% sucrose) at two-minute intervals throughout the
painful procedure. The peak effect appears to last about four min-
utes; therefore, the analgesic effect may wear off if procedures are
prolonged. The infant’s postnatal age may influence the effective-
ness of sucrose (Taddio 2008).
Adverse effects following the short-term use of sucrose are cur-
rently not a concern. We reported the possible adverse effects in
the Effects of interventions. Adverse effects would be more likely
to occur when multiple doses of are used. Stevens 2005a found
no significant differences in incidence rates for necrotizing ente-
rocolitis between infants who received repeated doses of sucrose
over 28 days of life compared to control groups. Johnston 2002
studied 107 preterm infants of less than 31 weeks’ postmenstrual
age where 1 mL of 24% sucrose or sterile water was administered
up to three times, two minutes apart, for all painful procedures
over a seven-day period. Johnston indicated that higher frequency
of sucrose doses was predictive of lower awareness, orientation
(AO), motor development and vigour (MDV) on the NAPI scale
at 36 weeks, and lower (MDV) at 40 weeks. At two weeks’ post-
natal age, a higher number of doses of sucrose were predictive
of higher Neuro-Biological Risk Score (NBRS) scores. Proposed
explanations were that: (a) low neurodevelopmental scores could
be related to infants receiving sucrose during the one-week study
period only, and ongoing exposure to painful procedures might
have resulted in heightened sensitivity to pain; or (b) the sample
size was inadequate to identify other explanatory variables. Fur-
ther analysis revealed that 10 or fewer doses of sucrose over a 24-
hour period were unlikely to be related to poorer neurodevelop-
mental scores (Johnston 2007). Banga 2015 reported that 93 in-
fants randomised to either repeated doses of sucrose or water for
painful procedures for seven consecutive days showed no signifi-
cant differences in MDV or AO scales of the NAPI scale or adverse
events. Stevens 2005a reported no statistically significant differ-
ences between sucrose + pacifier, water + pacifier, or the standard
care group on neurobiological risk status outcomes
Generally, infants in this review were healthy term and preterm
neonates and very few were under 27 weeks’ PMA at birth. Al-
though the preterm infant’s pain response is generally consistent
with that of the term infant, it is often more subtle, less sustained
and affected by the infant’s behavioural state and severity of illness
(Gibbins 2008). There was no significant difference in this review
between crying in term and preterm infants; however, the inci-
dence of crying following painful stimuli is reported to be 50%
less in preterm infants compared to term infants (Stevens 1994);
therefore, crying alone may not be a reliable indicator of pain in
the preterm infant population and is precluded as an indicator in
many validated infant pain measures.
Few researchers provided a definition or conceptualisation of pain
as an outcome. If the reported outcomes reflect the investigators’
concept of pain, then we can assume that most investigators con-
sidered proportion, percentage or duration of time crying to be
the most valid indicator of pain in neonates. Although research on
infant crying has delineated certain crying characteristics, such as
pitch, intensity, melody and harmonics, as being good indicators
of pain, these were not assessed in the sucrose studies reviewed.
Cry duration may give some indication of distress. However, cry
duration does not necessarily confirm or deny that the infant is
in pain. For unstable ventilated infants who often do not cry fol-
lowing painful procedures, any cry characteristic would be an in-
appropriate outcome. Attempts at cry or a silent cry in ventilated
infants may be reasonable to consider. A multivariate approach
looking at multiple indicators or a composite pain score may be a
more comprehensive approach.
The majority of researchers studied heel lance as the painful pro-
84

 cedure. However, they provided little detail about this procedure
(e.g. type of lancet used, number of attempts, number of squeezes,
duration of the procedure). Therefore, it was impossible to deter-
mine if the painful stimuli (or painful procedures) were compara-
ble in intensity, duration or frequency between studies. Similarly,
details about other procedures (e.g. subcutaneous injection, ROP
examination, bladder catheterization and circumcision) and co-
interventions such as skin-to-skin (kangaroo care), breastfeeding
or comforting strategies (e.g. containment, bundling, tucking or
positioning) that may enhance the effect of sucrose would be desir-
able. The length of observation and return to baseline parameters
(e.g. heart rate) of infants following procedures was not reported
frequently.
The delivery of sucrose (by syringe, dropper or dipping pacifier)
varied among studies. The pacifier promotes NNS and calming
that may contribute to reducing pain-elicited distress (Campos
1994). Blass 1994 suggests that sucking exerts a profound be-
havioural effect and induces feelings of calm. Other researchers
have found that NNS reduces heart rate and metabolic rate, causes
infants to self-soothe and elevates the pain threshold. NNS has
not been shown to affect cortisol response, vagal tone or oxygen
saturation of blood (DiPietro 1994; Gunnar 1992). The calming
effects are not sustained following cessation of the NNS alone.
This is in contrast to NNS + sucrose administration, where the
effects persist for several minutes beyond the cessation of contact.
Results from this 2016 update indicate that the use of sucrose
with NNS appears to have synergistic effect with both single and
repeated doses of sucrose.
Codipietro 2008 concluded that breastfeeding was more effective
than sucrose for reducing pain from heel lance in term neonates.
Shah 2006 recommended that breastfeeding, when available,
should be used to reduce procedural pain in neonates who are
exposed to single painful procedures; breast milk alone in small
volumes is shown to be as effective as water for the relief of pro-
cedural pain (much less so than sucrose), and its effectiveness for
repeated painful procedures has not yet been established.
Harrison 2010 conducted a systematic review of 14 RCTs with
1674 injections to compare the efficacy of oral sweet solutions to
water or no treatment in infants aged one to 12 months. Infants
who received sucrose or glucose before immunisation had mod-
erately reduced incidence and duration of crying. Pillai Riddell
2015 in a systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions
found that the most established evidence for managing procedu-
ral pain in preterm and term neonates and older infants was for
NNS, swaddling, facilitated tucking, and rocking/holding. Bueno
2013 in a systematic review demonstrate that 20% to 30% glu-
cose reduces pain scores and crying during single heel lances and
venipunctures and can be recommended as an alternative to su-
crose for procedural pain reduction in healthy term and preterm
neonates.
Slater 2010 demonstrated no significant differences in the noci-
ceptive brain activity measured with neonatal EEG or magnitude
or latency of the spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal measured
with EMG between neonates given sucrose and those given sterile
water; however, the PIPP scores were significantly lower in the in-
fants given sucrose. The authors suggested that oral sucrose does
not affect activity in the neonatal brain or spinal cord and many
not be an effective analgesic. The small sample size, moderate at-
trition rates and methods used to measure and analyse EEG and
EMG recordings limit the generalization of these findings.
This evidence has been integrated into evidence-based sucrose
consensus protocols and guidelines (Dunbar 2006; Lefrak 2006;
Sharek 2006). However, in an evaluation of infant pain guidelines
(Lee 2014), recommendations were not sufficient, clear or con-
sistent to guide clinical practice. Furthermore, in a cross-sectional
survey of painful procedures in NICUs, procedural pain was man-
aged using sweet solutions only 3.5% of the time (Carbajal 2008).
We still have significant gaps in our understanding of how pain
is processed in the developing brain and optimal assessment and
treatment approaches (Fitzgerald 2015). Methodological and pain
treatment issues need to be addressed, and new evidence generated
in light of the existing evidence. A comprehensive approach to
validating various measures to evaluate pain in neonates and a
standardized approach to measuring outcomes is critical, especially
when evaluating pain-relieving interventions that form the basis
for clinical decision making.
There is a need to assess the long-term effects of sucrose admin-
istration to neonates. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes
should be assessed by a standardized and validated assessment tool,
a child developmental specialist, or both at 18 to 24 months or at
any later age in childhood.

Implications for practice
We included 74 studies in this review, 38 of which examined
pain associated with heel lancing. The results from these stud-
ies provide further evidence to support the efficacy of sucrose for
reducing pain from single and, to a lesser extent, repeated heel
lances. The included studies reported on the use of sucrose for
venipuncture, intramuscular injection, arterial puncture, subcu-
taneous injections, nasogastric or orogastric tube insertion, blad-
der catheterization, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) examina-
tions, circumcision, and echocardiography exam in hospitalized
neonates. However, except for venipuncture and intramuscular
injection for which there was high-quality evidence for the use
of sucrose, further studies of these other painful procedures are
required due to conflicting evidence on the effect of sucrose in
reducing pain. Sucrose reduces procedural pain with minimal to
no reported adverse effects. Small doses of 24% sucrose (0.01 g to
0.02 g) are efficacious in preterm infants, while larger doses (0.24
g to 0.50 g) reduce the proportion of time term infants spend

 crying.There is some moderate-quality evidence that sucrose in
combination with other non-pharmacological interventions such
as non-nutritive sucking is more effective than sucrose alone.
Implications for research
The optimal dose of sucrose for pain relief in term and preterm
infants has not yet been established. Researchers should consider
establishing more precise and tailored doses based on the infant
(e.g. postmenstrual age, severity of illness) and context in which it
is to be used. Optimal sucrose doses could be assessed furtherusing
sensitivity/meta-regression techniques. More research is needed to
address the analgesic and calming effects of sucrose and its inter-
action with other behavioural (e.g. facilitated tucking, kangaroo
care), and pharmacological (e.g. morphine, fentanyl), interven-
tions for more invasive procedures such as ROP exam and circum-
cision. Strategies need to be initiated to increase understanding of
the underlying mechanisms of pain and sucrose for pain relief in
infants. The use of repeated administrations of sucrose in neonates
needs to be investigated further in terms of clinical, developmental
and economic outcomes.
Investigators should be cautious when utilising existing evidence
to answer questions on efficacy in other painful procedures that
have been minimally addressed to date (e.g. lumbar punctures,
peripherally inserted central catheter insertions, endotracheal in-
tubation, chest tube insertions). Strengthened study design and
methods with particular attention to the adequacy of sample size,
acknowledgment of conceptualisation of pain, use of validated
pain measures to determine outcomes, and context are required.
Use of sucrose in neonates that are of extremely low birthweight,
unstable, ventilated, or a combination of these factors needs to be
addressed.
Replication of existing studies of high methodological quality, us-
ing a valid pain assessment measure and standard set of validated
outcomes would allow for further combination of results in meta-
analyses. Researchers should report on means and standard devi-
ations (SD) in addition to medians and ranges, if the data are not
normally distributed, to allow for the use of meta-analytic tech-
niques. If researchers choose to present data in graph form, they
should include the means and SDs in the text (or additional ap-
pendices). Preferably the amount of sucrose administered should
be reported in g/kg body weight. Future research should focus on
long-term effects of repeated sucrose administration with other
behavioural and pharmacological interventions in sick and very-
preterm neonates. Results should be presented for individual in-
dicators and any composite pain scores constructed from these in-
dicators. The relationship between pain measures and individual
physiological and cognitive indicators of nociceptive brain activity
should be explored further.
Additional research is urgently needed regarding the understand-
ing of the neurophysiological basis of pain, as well as addressing
the pressing clinical need by determining the minimally effective
dose of sucrose during a single painful procedure, and the effect
of repeated sucrose administration on immediate (pain intensity)
and long-term (neurodevelopmental) outcomes.
Effective knowledge translation strategies are required to translate
research evidence on sucrose into practice effectively (Stevens
2014b). For healthcare providers these strategies could include the
use of reminders, interactive education and educational outreach
and regular audit and feedback sessions.

Methods
Double-blind, RCT
Painful intervention: venipuncture
Study location: Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, La Laguna, Tenerife,
Spain
Study period: not stated
Participants
28 (29 to 36 weeks’ GA) healthy infants, PNA age 1 to 26 days
Interventions
2 mL 12% sucrose via syringe (n = 8) 2 min prior to venipuncture
2 mL 24% sucrose via syringe (n = 8) 2 min prior to venipuncture
2 mL spring water via syringe (n = 12) 2 min prior to venipuncture
Outcomes
Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, HR (just before and just after administering the
solution and 5 min after venipuncture), time spent in audible crying for 3 min following
venipuncture
Notes
1-way and 2-way ANOVA used to evaluate outcomes
Data were reported as means and SDs for the 3 physiological outcomes and as medians
and IQRs for cry duration (in graph form only). Data were collected at 3 time points;
just before the administration of the solution, just after administration of the solution
and 5 min after venipuncture
Adverse effects were not evaluated
Data for oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and HR were reported at 5 min after
venipuncture and were not included in meta-analyses

Methods
RCT
Painful intervention: circumcision
Study location: Day Care Surgery Department of Maternity and Children Hospital,
Dammam City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Study period: January 2011 and April 2011
Participants
90 full-term newborn males who underwent circumcision
GA of 38 weeks or beyond, 5 min Apgar score of 8 or higher, PNA of 12 h or older and
birthweight > 2500 g, and to be free from jaundice, anomalies of the penis, and analgesia
or sedation in the previous 48 h
Interventions
2 mL oral sucrose (24% w/v) given through a dropper onto the tongue 2 min before the
procedure (n = 30)
EMLA cream: applied to the shaft of the penis with an occlusive dressing 1 h before the
procedure (n = 30)
Combination of EMLA cream + oral sucrose (n = 30): 1 g EMLA cream applied to the
shaft of the penis with an occlusive dressing 1 h before the procedure + 2 mL oral sucrose
(24% w/v) given through a dropper onto the tongue 2 min before the procedure
Outcomes
N-PASS used to assess the severity of pain and neonatal response to pain, 5 min before,
during and 5 min after the circumcision for all newborns. The scale measures both phys-
iologic responses (HR, respiratory rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation) and be-
havioural responses (crying irritability, behaviour state, facial expression and extremities
tone) to pain

 Cignacco 2012
Methods
RCT
Painful intervention: repeated heel lances
Study location: 3 NICUs in Switzerland
Study period: 12 January to 31 December 2009
Participants
71 preterm infants between 24 and 32 weeks PMA
Interventions
Sucrose group (n = 24): sucrose 20% (0.2 mL/kg), administered orally 2 min before
the heel lance. If the infant seemed to be in pain during the heel lance phase, up to 2
additional doses of sucrose were administered and noted in the study chart
Sucrose + facilitated tucking (FT) (n = 23): combination of sucrose and facilitated
tucking; the FT was started at the beginning of the baseline phase and sucrose was given
2 min before the heel lance
FT (n = 24): FT was started at the beginning of the baseline phase, and the infant was
’tucked’ through all 3 phases
Outcomes
BPSN: data collection occurred: at baseline (before any manipulation); at heel lance (skin
preparation, heel stick, and haemostasis after blood was drawn); and during recovery (3
min after the heel lance)
The BPSN contains 9 items: 3 are physiological (HR, respiratory rate, and oxygen
saturation) and 6 are behavioural (grimacing, body movements, crying, skin colour,
sleeping patterns, consolation)

Study period: not stated
Participants
20 preterm infants, mean PMA 30 weeks
Sucrose group: mean PNA 23 days
Water group: mean PNA 27 days
Interventions
Total of 51 NG tube insertions. Each infant was randomised to either the water or sucrose
group prior to each insertion. This was not a cross-over study. In each instance where NG
tube insertion was required, the infant was randomised separately and independently of
any previous allocation to receive either placebo (sterile water) or 24% sucrose solution
0.5 mL to 2 mL 24% sucrose (n = 26)
0.5 mL to 2 mL sterile water (n = 25)
Outcomes
Incidence of crying, HR, oxygen saturation, NFCS (median)
Notes
Incidence of crying reported as percentage of neonates who cried. HR and oxygen
saturation measured as change (in beats/min and percentage saturation, respectively)
from baseline
Adverse events were evaluated; brief apnoea and self-limiting bradycardia reported in a
few neonates, but no clinical intervention needed. No statistically significant differences

signed to the sucrose solution treatment
group were then given a 0.5 mL solution of
oral sucrose in a 1-mL syringe by the nurse
caring for the infant. Infants assigned to the
placebo group did not receive any oral so-
lution
The investigator was then called back to
the infant’s bedside, remaining blinded to
treatment group assignment, and obtained
baseline study data (NIPS; HR; oxygen
saturation) immediately after the arterial
puncture needle was inserted and again 1
min after the arterial puncture procedure
was completed
For infants assigned to the sucrose treat-

labelled as Study Solution 1 and 2. The
research nurses (who performed the heel
lance and administered each intervention)
drew up the solution specified in the in-
tervention sequence from a dark coloured
bottle, so were blind to which solution (e.
g. water or 24% sucrose) was used. Nurses
were not blind to the prone positioning or
control

The study nurse collected all of the data (e.
g. videotaped facial expressions, recorded
cry) and was blind to study solutions; the
data coders were also blinded to which
study solution was used - but NOT to the
prone positioning or control, as they could
visualize this on the videotapes. The data

Notes
Student’s t-test used to compare average PIPP scores between groups. Post hoc analyses
were performed after adjusting for baseline characteristics by use of a general linear
model for IM injection and venipuncture and linear mixed-model analysis for heel lances.
Adverse events were analyzed using the Chi2 test or the Student t-test
Adverse effects were reported - no significant differences between groups in the incidence
of adverse events, which included spitting up and blood glucose levels

New search has been performed
This review was updated in 2016. An additional 20
studies were accepted for inclusion for a total of 74
studies. The total number of infants included in the re-
view is now 7049. We converted 95% confidence inter-
vals to standard deviations. We performed the compar-
isons based on the different concentrations of sucrose
used and on the different control interventions. This re-
sulted in a large number of comparisons and RevMan-
analyses. Most comparisons and outcomes included a
limited number of studies and infants
Although we included a total of 37 comparisons, we
include ’Summary of findings’ tables for primary out-
comes (validated pain scales) and GRADE assessments
based on the GRADE assessment tables that are avail-
able in RevMan

For the update of the review in 2013, inclusion criteria were extended to all studies that used sucrose as an intervention for any acute
painful procedure, including subcutaneous injections, circumcision, bladder catheterizations and eye examinations for retinopathy of
prematurity, as well as repeated doses of sucrose. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were added for that update. For this update
in 2016 echocardiographic exam was added as a potentially stressful intervention.
