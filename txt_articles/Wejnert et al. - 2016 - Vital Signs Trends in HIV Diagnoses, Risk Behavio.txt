Abstract
Background: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk for poor health outcomes and bloodborne infections, 
including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus infections. Although substantial 
progress has been made in reducing HIV infections among PWID, recent changes in drug use could challenge this success.
Methods: CDC used National HIV Surveillance System data to analyze trends in HIV diagnoses. Further, National HIV 
Behavioral Surveillance interviews of PWID in 22 cities were analyzed to describe risk behaviors and use of prevention 
services among all PWID and among PWID who first injected drugs during the 5 years before their interview (new PWID).
Results: During 2008–2014, HIV diagnoses among PWID declined in urban and nonurban areas, but have leveled off 
in recent years. Among PWID in 22 cities, during 2005–2015, syringe sharing decreased by 34% among blacks/African 
Americans (blacks) and by 12% among Hispanics/Latinos (Hispanics), but remained unchanged among whites. The racial 
composition of new PWID changed during 2005–2015: the percentage who were black decreased from 38% to 19%, 
the percentage who were white increased from 38% to 54%, and the percentage who were Hispanic remained stable. 
Among new PWID interviewed in 2015, whites engaged in riskier injection behaviors than blacks.
Conclusions: Decreases in HIV diagnoses among PWID indicate success in HIV prevention. However, emerging 
behavioral and demographic trends could reverse this success.
Implications for public health practice: Access to comprehensive prevention services is essential for all PWID. Syringe 
services programs reduce syringe sharing and can help PWID access prevention and treatment services for HIV and other 
bloodborne diseases, such as hepatitis C and hepatitis B.
Introduction
Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at higher risk for 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnoses 
among PWID have decreased approximately 90% since their 
peak in 1993 (1), and only an estimated 0.3% of the U.S. 
population has injected drugs in the past 12 months (2), 
approximately 9% of HIV infections diagnosed in recent 
years are among PWID (3). Although HIV diagnoses among 
PWID have decreased over time (3), recent increases in acute 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (4), which are frequently 
associated with injection drug use, suggest this progress could 
be negatively affected by increases in opioid (5) and heroin (6) 
use. The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy* identifies PWID 
as a priority population for HIV prevention. Surveillance 
data were analyzed to determine recent trends in annual HIV 
diagnoses and characteristics and behaviors of PWID to better 
understand emerging opportunities and challenges in HIV 
prevention among PWID.
Methods
CDC’s National HIV Surveillance System data reported through 
June 2016 from 50 states and the District of Columbia were used 
to obtain the number of PWID with HIV diagnosed† during 
2008–2014. Data were statistically adjusted for missing transmission 
categories by multiple imputation (7). National HIV Behavioral 
Surveillance (8) (NHBS) data include PWID who injected drugs 
during the 12 months before their NHBS interview in 22 U.S. cities

during 2005–2015.§ Among all PWID, trend analyses¶ of receipt 
of syringes** and syringe sharing†† were conducted to understand 
changes in HIV-associated injection behaviors. Additional analyses 
were limited to PWID who injected drugs for the first time during 
the 5 years before interview§§ (new PWID) for 1) trends since 2005 
in racial/ethnic composition¶¶ of new PWID, and 2) comparisons 
of demographic characteristics, HIV and HCV testing, injection 
behaviors, and HIV*** and self-reported HCV prevalence, by race/
ethnicity††† among new PWID interviewed in 2015.
Results
During 2008–2014, HIV diagnoses among PWID in the 
United States decreased by 48% (from 6,604 to 3,461). During 
this same period, diagnoses among black/African American 
(black) and Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) PWID decreased by 
approximately 50% in both urban (from 2,452 to 950 among 
blacks; from 1,185 to 639 among Hispanics) and nonurban 
(from 523 to 222 among blacks; from 197 to 95 among 
Hispanics) areas,§§§ with a slower decrease observed in the 
more recent years (Figure 1). Diagnoses among white PWID 
in urban areas decreased by 28% (from 1,350 to 977) during 
2008–2012, but remained stable past 2012. In nonurban 
areas, diagnoses among white PWID decreased by 28% (from 
481 to 345) during 2008–2010, but remained stable during 
2010–2014. The majority of HIV diagnoses (79%) among 
PWID occurred in urban areas.
NHBS data¶¶¶ indicate that, although the percentage of 
PWID in 22 cities who received syringes from a syringe services 
program (SSP)**** (9) increased during 2005–2015 for all 
racial/ethnic groups (p<0.001), less than one third of PWID 
received all their syringes from sterile sources (Figure 2). During 
2005–2015, the percentage of black PWID who received all 
their syringes from sterile sources increased by 48% (p<0.001). 
During the same period, the percentages of Hispanic PWID 
and white PWID who received all their syringes from sterile 
sources did not change (Hispanics, p = 0.16, whites, p = 0.72). 
Hispanic PWID had the largest percentage of persons receiv-
ing all their syringes from sterile sources in each year. In 
2015, overall 25% of PWID interviewed received all their 
syringes from sterile sources (blacks = 28%; Hispanics = 29%; 
whites = 22%) (Figure 2).
During 2005–2015, the percentages of black and Hispanic 
PWID in 22 cities who shared syringes decreased (blacks, 
p<0.001; Hispanics, p = 0.005) (Figure 2). The largest decrease, 
34%, was among black PWID, followed by Hispanic PWID 
(12%). During 2005–2015, the percentage of white PWID 
who shared syringes did not change (p = 0.14). In 2015, the 
highest percentage of PWID interviewed who shared syringes 
were white (43%), followed by Hispanic (33%) and black 
(21%). Across all years, 31% of PWID who received at least 
one syringe from SSPs had shared syringes, compared with 
38% who had not received any syringes from SSPs. Among 
PWID who received all their syringes from sterile sources,†††† 
13% had shared syringes in the past year; 41% of PWID who 
did not receive all their syringes from sterile sources§§§§ had 
shared syringes in the previous year.
 
§ National HIV Behavioral Surveillance data include PWID recruited using 
respondent-driven sampling in 22 U.S. cities during 2005–2006, 2009, 
2012, and 2015. The target sample size in each city each year was 500 PWID. 
The number of cities included each year varied; 2005: 22 cities; 2009, 2012, 
and 2015: 19 cities. The following cities were included in all years: Atlanta, 
Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; 
Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Houston, Texas; Los 
Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Nassau–Suffolk, New York; New York 
City, New York; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Diego, 
California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington. Additional cities 
were included as follows: in 2005, Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Las Vegas, 
Nevada; Norfolk-Portsmouth, Virginia; St. Louis, Missouri; in 2009, 2012, 
2015, New Orleans, Louisiana; Washington, D.C.
 
¶ Separate Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations 
(GEE) clustered on recruitment chain were used to examine trends overall 
and stratified by race/ethnicity. Interview year was included in the models 
as an ordinal variable to examine changes over time. Models were adjusted 
for continuous age to account for changing demographics over time. A single 
model utilizing interactions by race yielded similar results.
 ** A person was considered to have received a syringe from a syringe services 
program (SSP) if he or she reported receiving a sterile syringe or needle, at 
least once, from an SSP or syringe/needle exchange program during the 
12 months before interview. A person was considered to have received syringes 
only from sterile sources if he or she reported receiving syringes from at least 
one of the following: SSP
, pharmacy, or healthcare provider and NOT any 
other source during the 12 months before interview.
 †† A person was considered to have shared a syringe during the 12 months 
before interview if he or she reported using a syringe to inject drugs that had 
previously been used for drug injection by someone else.
 §§ Calculated based on age at first injection and year of interview.
 ¶¶ T
o assess trends in the racial composition of new PWID, we defined three dummy 
variables representing blacks/African Americans (blacks), Hispanics/Latinos 
(Hispanics), and whites, and conducted Poisson regression models with GEE 
clustered on recruitment chain. For each racial/ethnic group, the corresponding 
dummy variable was included in the model as a dependent variable, year as an 
ordinal variable, and continuous age as a covariate.
 *** Determined by HIV test administered immediately after the interview.
 ††† P-values comparing blacks to whites and Hispanics to whites were calculated 
using GEE regression clustered on recruitment chain, with race/ethnicity as 
the covariate. All models were adjusted for continuous age, except for analysis 
of age and age at first injection.
 §§§ Urban areas include metropolitan statistical areas with populations of ≥500,000 
persons; areas with populations <500,000 persons were considered nonurban.
 ¶¶¶ NHBS data are limited to PWID in urban areas who likely have greater 
access to SSPs and other resources than PWID outside of urban centers.
 **** SSPs and syringe/needle exchange programs allow PWID to exchange used 
syringes or needles for new, sterile syringes. SSPs provide comprehensive services 
such as HIV or HCV testing, linkage to care, and medication-assisted treatment. 
NHBS does not collect information on what services are offered at SSPs.
 †††† Sterile sources include SSPs, pharmacies, and health care providers.
 §§§§ Includes PWID who only received syringes from nonsterile sources and 
PWID who received syringes from both sterile and nonsterile sources. 
Among PWID who only received syringes from nonsterile sources, 41% 
shared syringes; among PWID who received syringes from both sterile and 
nonsterile sources 42% shared syringes in the past 12 months.

During 2005–2015, the racial/ethnic distribution of new 
PWID changed (Figure 3). The percentage of new PWID who 
were black decreased by 51%, from 38% in 2005 to 19% in 
2015 (p<0.001). The percentage who were Hispanic remained 
stable at approximately 21% (p = 0.72). The percentage who 
were white increased by 40% from 38% in 2005 to 54% in 
2015 (p = 0.002).
In 2015, 54% of new PWID were white, 21% were 
Hispanic, and 19% were black (Table). (In 2015, among 
PWID who had been injecting for ≥5 years, 37% were white, 
18% were Hispanic, and 40% were black.) Overall, 48% of 
new PWID were aged 18–29 years; however, variations by 
race/ethnicity were observed: 21% of black, 49% of Hispanic, 
and 56% of white new PWID were aged 18–29 years. Syringe 
sharing was most commonly reported among whites (46%), 
followed by Hispanics (32%) and blacks (28%). Regardless of 
race/ethnicity, most new PWID injected at least one time per 
day (83%) and primarily injected heroin (27%) or heroin and 
other drugs (61%) during the 12 months before their interview. 
Among new PWID, prescription opioid misuse during the past 
12 months was most common among whites (27% injection; 
46% noninjection), followed by Hispanics (21% injection; 
37% noninjection) and blacks (10% injection; 30% nonin-
jection). HIV testing in the 12 months before the interview 
was most commonly reported among blacks (65%), followed 
by Hispanics (58%) and whites (57%). HIV prevalence was 
highest among blacks (9%), followed by Hispanics (4%) and 
whites (2%). Having ever been tested for HCV was most 
common among whites (72%), followed by blacks (69%) and 
Hispanics (64%). Self-reported HCV prevalence, among new 
PWID who had previously been tested, was highest among 
whites (22%), followed by Hispanics (19%) and blacks (13%). 
New PWID who received syringes from SSPs were more likely 
to dispose of all their syringes safely (37%) than those who 
had not received syringes from SSPs (7%).
Conclusions and Comments
Trends in protective behavior might explain why HIV 
diagnoses have declined more among black PWID than 
among white PWID. Fewer blacks are injecting drugs now 
than before (10) and the percentage of new PWID who are 
black decreased by 51% during 2005–2015. Further, during 
that time, the percentage of black PWID who shared syringes 
decreased by 34%. During 2005–2015, the percentage of new 
white PWID increased by 40%; syringe sharing among white 
PWID remained high, at approximately 43%.
Black PWID currently account for <20% of new PWID. 
This decrease might be partially explained by changes in social 
norms regarding drug injection in black communities (10), 
as well as increases in injection drug use among whites (11). 
Black PWID tend to be older, and fewer report sharing syringes 
than do Hispanics or whites (12). Encouraging trends in use of 
SSPs and receipt of all syringes from sterile sources contribute 
to reducing the risk for HIV among black PWID. However, 
blacks remain at increased risk for HIV because of the high 
prevalence of HIV in their communities (3).
HIV diagnoses also decreased among Hispanic PWID. 
Although the data do not suggest that fewer Hispanics inject 
drugs now than previously, behavioral surveillance data suggest 
a trend of reduced syringe sharing, which is potentially related 
to increased access to SSPs and relatively high, steady rates of 
receiving all syringes from sterile sources.
Although HIV diagnoses among white PWID have decreased 
since 2008, recent trends suggest heroin use and injection drug 
use among whites are increasing (10,11) and, coupled with 
high rates of syringe sharing, might challenge the decades of 
progress in HIV prevention among PWID. For the first time, 
in 2014, a larger number of white PWID received an HIV

diagnosis than PWID from any other racial/ethnic population 
in the United States. This analysis indicates that white PWID, 
who tend to begin injecting at younger ages than blacks or 
Hispanics (12), accounted for >50% of new PWID in 2015. 
Further, although white PWID in 22 cities reported increases in 
receipt of sterile syringes from SSPs similar to increases reported 
among blacks and Hispanics, they were least likely to receive 
all their syringes from sterile sources and most likely to have 
shared syringes. Rural areas, which are predominately white, 
include some of the most vulnerable populations for injection 
drug use and injection drug use–related HIV outbreaks and 
might have the greatest unmet need for risk reduction services 
provided by SSPs (9,13,14).
SSPs reduce syringe sharing and are widely considered to 
be an effective means for reducing HIV transmission.¶¶¶¶ 
Reducing syringe sharing through improved access to SSPs 
is a critical component of HIV prevention among PWID. 
Although access to syringes from SSPs has increased, the supply 
of sterile syringes available to most PWID is likely to be insuf-
ficient to meet their needs, and barriers remain to accessing 
SSPs, including lack of SSPs in rural areas (9) and absence of 
legal support in many states (15).***** NHBS data indicate 
that 83% of new PWID interviewed injected one or more times 
per day; comparing estimates of PWID population size (2) with 
the estimated number of syringes distributed by SSPs in 2013

(9) and the low percentage (25%) of PWID in 22 cities who 
received all their syringes from sterile sources suggests that the 
U.S. syringe supply falls short. In addition to providing PWID 
with sterile syringes and equipment, SSPs serve as a bridge to 
access condoms; risk-reduction education; testing for HIV 
and HCV; referrals to health services, such as treatment for 
HIV, HCV, or substance use disorder, including medication-
assisted treatment (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine); 
pre-exposure prophylaxis (i.e., PrEP); and safe syringe disposal 
(9). SSPs are an effective tool for reducing substance misuse 
and risk for HIV infection. Recent changes in federal law††††† 
afford an opportunity to improve provision of comprehensive 
prevention services to all PWID through SSPs. It is important 
for jurisdictions to understand patterns of substance use in their 
communities, assess their SSP needs, and ensure services are 
provided to PWID (13).

The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, National HIV Surveillance System data are 
subject to reporting delays, and not all cases might have been 
reported at this time. This report presents trends in HIV diag-
noses through 2014; preliminary 2015 data are not reliable for 
trend analysis (3). Second, NHBS data are limited to PWID 
recruited in large U.S. cities with high HIV prevalences using 
respondent-driven sampling and might not be generalizable 
to all PWID; recruitment in urban areas might not reflect 
the demographics and syringe use patterns of PWID living in 
rural areas. Finally, behavioral data and HCV prevalence are 
self-reported and subject to social desirability bias.
Key Points
• Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk 
for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C 
virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, and other negative 
health outcomes. In 2014, 9% of HIV diagnoses were 
among PWID. Although substantial progress has been 
made in reducing HIV infections among PWID, recent 
changes in drug use could challenge this success.
• HIV diagnoses among black/African American (black) 
and Hispanic/Latino PWID decreased about 50% 
during 2008–2014. Blacks now make up 19% of new 
PWID in 22 cities, down from 38% in 2005. Syringe 
sharing decreased among black and Hispanic/Latino 
PWID in 22 cities.
• Diagnoses among urban white PWID decreased 28%, 
but the decline stopped in 2012. Whites continue to 
have the highest rate of syringe sharing and now make 
up over 50% of new PWID.
• Among PWID who received all their syringes from 
sterile sources in the past year, 13% shared syringes; 
41% of PWID who did not receive all their syringes 
from sterile sources shared syringes.
• Strategies that reduce HIV infections and syringe 
sharing among PWID should be used to meet emerging 
challenges in changing PWID populations. Syringe 
services programs reduce syringe sharing and serve as 
a bridge to other health services including HIV and 
HCV diagnosis and treatment and medication-assisted 
treatment for substance use disorder.

MMWR / December 2, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 47
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The most effective way for persons to avoid acquiring HIV 
and other negative health outcomes associated with injection 
drug use, including HCV, hepatitis B virus, abscesses, bacterial 
endocarditis, skin and soft tissue infections, and overdose, is 
not to inject drugs. For those who do inject, provision of sterile 
syringes and services through SSPs can decrease risk for HIV 
transmission and other negative health outcomes. A need to 
address injection drug use and associated risk behaviors exists 
because of several factors, including recent increases in heroin 
addiction and overdose (6); the HIV outbreak in Scott County, 
Indiana, which saw an increase in diagnoses from five in 5 years 
to 181 in 1 year (14); and the recent 364% increase of HCV 
transmission in rural areas (16), largely fueled by the current 
U.S. opioid epidemic (11). The window of opportunity for 
implementing SSPs that provide comprehensive services to 
prevent, rather than respond to, HIV outbreaks might be clos-
ing. Swift action can lead to further decreases in HIV diagnoses 
and prevent new outbreaks among PWID.
