Abstract
Background: Cholesterol has been associated as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recently, however, there is
growing evidence about crucial requirement of neuron membrane cholesterol in the organization and function of
the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor. For this, low cholesterol level has been reported to be associated with depression
and suicidality. However there have been inconsistent reports about this finding and the exact relationship
between these factors remains controversial. Therefore, we investigated the link between serum cholesterol and its
fractions with depression disorder and suicide attempt in 467 adult subjects in Mexican mestizo population.
Methods: Plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and low
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) were determined in 261 MDD patients meeting the DSM-5 criteria for major
depressive disorder (MDD), 59 of whom had undergone an episode of suicide attempt, and 206 healthy controls.
Results: A significant decrease in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels
was observed in the groups of MDD patients and suicide attempt compared to those without suicidal behavior
(p < 0.05). After adjusting for covariates, lower cholesterol levels were significantly associated with MDD (OR 4.229
CI 95% 2.555 – 7.000, p<.001) and suicide attempt (OR 5.540 CI 95% 2.825 – 10.866, p<.001)
Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that lower levels of cholesterol are associated with mood
disorders like MDD and suicidal behavior. More mechanistic studies are needed to further explain this association.
Keywords: Suicide attempt, depression, cholesterol
Background
Suicide is one of the most disastrous outcomes of psychi-
atric disorders [1]. It is a significant public health problem
and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide [2–4].
In Mexico the rate of suicide is a current health problem
that is accentuated by the fact that it is a country with an
emerging market economy. In recent years, Mexico has
presented an increase in its suicide rate. For example, be-
tween 2000 and 2014 there was an increase in the suicide
rate from 3.5 to 5.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (http://
bibliodigitalibd.senado.gob.mx/handle/123456789/3181) [5].
Suicidal behavior includes a wide spectrum of behaviors,
such as completed suicides, high-lethality suicide at-
tempts, and low-lethality suicide attempts [6, 7]. Although
roughly 60% of all suicides occur in the context of depres-
sive disorders [7, 8] it is still challenging for clinicians to
predict suicide risk in patients with depression. For this
reason, increased attention has been paid to potential
biomarkers for suicide in patients with major depressive
disorder (MDD) and suicidal behavior [1, 9].

 Many studies have confirmed that biological markers
might be linked to suicidality, among which serum lipid
levels might play an important role [2, 10–12]. However,
there has been considerable controversy about the asso-
ciation between serum lipid levels and suicidality. Some
human studies showed that suicide attempters had lower
cholesterol levels [2, 11, 13, 14]others reported positive
associations between cholesterol and completed sui-
cide[2, 15–17]and some others indicated that there was
no evidence for an association between serum choles-
terol and suicidality [18, 19].Although the mechanism
behind hypocholesterolemia and suicide has not been
clearly defined, previous studies have suggested that al-
tered cholesterol at synaptic lipid rafts may cause a re-
duction in serotonin communication [2].
In the Mexican population, very few studies have ex-
amined the association between serum lipid levels and
the presence of depression and suicide attempt, and
none have reported the frequency of hypocholesterole-
mia in depressed patients and suicide attempters. Here,
we hypothesized that: 1) serum lipid levels are reduced
in subjects with depression and suicide attempt; 2)
Hypocholesterolemia is a risk factor associated with de-
pression and suicide attempt.
Methods
Study population
After the approval of protocol by Research and Ethics
Committee of the General Hospital 450 (No. 12/0306-
2015), a case-control study was conducted with 261
MDD adult patients, 59 of these also had a recent epi-
sode of suicide attempt and 206 healthy adult volunteer
controls of both genders; all subjects provided informed
consent. Study subjects were recruited from the Mental
Health Hospital “Dr. Miguel Valle Bueno” (Secretary of
Health) and psychiatry service of the General Hospital
450 (Secretary of Health) and General Hospital “Dr.
Santiago Ramón y Cajal” (ISSSTE), in Durango City,
Mexico, from June2015to December 2016.
MDD diagnosis was made by trained psychiatrists ac-
cording to DSM-5 criteria. We defined suicide attempt as
"a non-fatal, self-directed, potentially injurious behavior
with an intent to die as a result of the behavior" as defined
by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (https://
www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/definitions.html)
[20]. For our recruitment, we considered only participants
that required hospitalization.Subjects in the case group
were matched with subjects in the control group based on
age, sex and body mass index (BMI).The latter, in order to
exclude nutritional state as a confounding factor and due
to previous association between BMI and cholesterol
levels. [21]. Control subjects were apparently healthy per-
sons without any symptoms or signs of MDD based on a
clinical examination at inclusion. Use of lipid lowering
drugs, such as statins was considered a confounding factor
due to the diverse effects it may have on cellular
mediation of inflammation and immunity [22] in conjunc-
tion with its known effect on depression [23] and was,
therefore, an exclusion criterion. Lastly, we excluded those
with chronic diseases (hepatic disorders, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, cardiovascular disease) due to their associ-
ation with dyslipidemia. [24, 25]
Lipid profile
Blood samples were obtained by venous puncture of all par-
ticipants after an overnight fasting period. The lipid profiles
were determined using the A15 Clinical Chemistry and
Turbidimetry Systems (BioSystems) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. The level of serum lipids was evalu-
ated
based
on
total
cholesterol
(TC),
high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG).Hypocholester-
olemia was defined as a total cholesterol concentration of
less than 150 mg/dl.
Statistical Analyses
Numerical data were presented as mean±standard devi-
ation (SD). Categorical variables were presented as propor-
tions. Differences between the two case groups (MDD and
MDD associated with suicide attempt) and control group
(healthy subjects) were estimated using ANOVA (Kruskall
Wallis test for skewed data) for numerical variables with an
additional Bonferroni post-hoc test, and the chi-squared
test for categorical variables. Additionally, our analysis was
stratified by sex and logistic regression analysis was
performed to determine the association between hypocho-
lesterolemia (independent variable) and the presence of
depression and suicide attempt (dependent variables).
Values of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for
Windows version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for
data management and statistical analysis. Odds ratio (OR)
and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were determined,
while p value <0.05 defined the statistical significance.
Results
Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of the 467
enrolled subjects are shown in Table 1. The comparative
analysis of the serum lipid levels between the study groups
showed significant differences in the total cholesterol, LDL-
cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides serum levels and,
hypocholesterolemia
frequency
(p<0.05).
No
significant
difference in HDL levels were observed between groups.
Post-hoc analysis between the two groups comprised of
patients with MDD with suicide attempt (p<0.001) and
MDD only (p<0.001) showed significantly lower total chol-
esterol levels compared to the control group. Also, patients
with MDD who were associated with suicide attempt had

 significantly lower total cholesterol levels compared with
MDD only (p 0.016).
LDL levels were lower in the MDD associated with suicide
attempt group with respect to the control group (p 0.013).
Subjects with depression presented higher VLDL (p<0.001)
and triglyceride levels (p<0.001) compared with healthy con-
trols. Similarly, subjects with depression presented higher
VLDL (p 0.043) and triglyceride levels (p 0.039) compared
with MDD with suicide attempt. The frequency of hypocho-
lesterolemia was significantly higher in the MDD and MDD
with suicide attempt groups compared with the control
group (p<0.001).
A subgroup analysis by gender was performed in order to
separately assess the magnitude of the association between
lipid serum levels in men and women with MDD and
suicide attempt (Table 2). Both, men and women showed
significantly lower total cholesterol levels in subjects with
MDD associated with suicide attempt compared with the
control group (p<0.05). However, only in women, did we
observe a significant difference between the MDD-only

 group versus the control group. No such relationship was
seen in males. The comparative analysis of the hypocholes-
terolemia frequency between the study groups showed sig-
nificant differences in both genders (p<0.05).
A bivariate logistic regression using data matched on
age, sex, and BMI showed a statistically significant associ-
ation between hypocholesterolemia and MDD (OR 4.229
CI 95% 2.555 – 7.000, p< 0.001). In the same way, a statis-
tically significant association between hypocholesterolemia
and suicide attempt was observed (OR 5.540 CI 95% 2.825
– 10.866, p<0.001). Additionally, triglycerides were ana-
lyzed and we found the following Odds Ratios and 95%
Confidence Intervals: for hypertriglyceridemia in MDD
[3.528 (2.326-5.352); p<0.001]; for hypertriglyceridemia in
MDD with suicide attempt [2.626 (1.411-4.885); p=0.002].
Upon further analysis, no significant association in the
other variables.
Discussion
Here, we show that lower serum cholesterol levels are linked
with MDD and suicide attempt. Age and sex-adjusted ana-
lyses showed a clear association between serum cholesterol
levels and the risk of depression and suicide attempt.
Previously, some studies have also shown an associ-
ation between low cholesterol and increased risk of
death due to injuries or suicide [2, 9, 26–29], but not in
other reports [1, 30–33], even elevated cholesterol levels
have been associated with suicide mortality in other
studies [15, 33].
In Mexican subjects, there is only one research paper
that has examined the possible link with hypocholestero-
lemia and suicide attempt in subjects with depression
[34]. This study found no difference in lipid profiles be-
tween patients who had attempted suicide and those
who had not. However, these authors studied only 33 pa-
tients with a major depressive episode (moderate to se-
vere) comparing 18 subjects who had attempted suicide
versus subjects who had never attempted suicide.
Although there is evidence of a link between low
serum cholesterol levels and suicide in patients with de-
pression [35, 36], the mechanism that may link serum
lipids with suicidality is still unclear. It has been estab-
lished that nearly all brain cholesterol is produced in situ
through de novo synthesis and that adequate prevention
of its uptake from the bloodstream is provided by select-
ivity of the blood-brain barrier [37–39]. Nonetheless, it
is viable that decreased peripheral cholesterol in those
individuals with psychiatric disorders occurs concur-
rently with cholesterol modifications that take place in
distinct synaptic lipid rafts in neurons (by a common
regulatory mechanism). This could produce the mini-
mized activity of serotonergic communication and, con-
sequently, give rise to instinctive responses and violent
suicidal behavior [2, 40].
Cholesterol is the paramount constituent of cellular
membranes in higher eukaryotes and is essential in mem-
brane function and organization as well as dynamics and
sorting. It is commonly found dispersed in a non-random
form in specific areas (domains) in both biological and
model membranes [41–43]. These areas, often denomi-
nated as ‘lipid rafts’ [43, 44], are thought to be fundamen-
tal in the preservation of the structure and function of the
membrane. However, describing the spatiotemporal reso-
lution of these domains has turned out to be a difficult
task [43, 45]. It has been suggested that these formations
be membrane domains in which signaling from a neuro-
transmitter may arise via a group of receptors, such as
serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor [46].
Previous studies demonstrated the imperative necessity
of membrane cholesterol in the function and organization
of the 5-HT1A receptor [45, 47–52]. Results from additional
studies showed that the fluidity of lipids considerably regu-
lates the binding of serotonin (5-HT) in murine brain
membranes. It is therefore expected that decreased levels of
cholesterol would increase the fluidity of the cellular mem-
brane. While, at the same time, minimal exposure of the 5-
HT receptors would be found in the synaptic cleft [2, 53].
Reportedly, disturbance of rafts by cholesterol deficiency
notably lowers agonist binding and coupling of G protein
to 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) serotonin receptors
in bovine hippocampal membranes [46, 47]. Serotonin1A
receptors typify one of the most formidable, evolutionarily
primitive, yet largely conserved families of seven trans-
membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that
span the membrane [45, 54]. Also, serotonergic signaling
constitutes an important part in the formation and regula-
tion of a multitude of functions such as behavioral, cogni-
tive, and developmental [45]. Moreover, studies have
demonstrated that there is an association between de-
creased 5-HT activity and suicide [2, 55].
It is noteworthy to mention that recent studies de-
scribed crystal structures of GPCRs, including serotonin1A
receptor, that demonstrated structural proof of cholesterol
binding sites [45, 56, 57].Currently, two conceivable path-
ways have been proposed by which membrane cholesterol
could affect the structure and function of GPCRs: (i) by
way of a direct/specific interaction with GPCRs, or (ii) via
an indirect pathway by modifying the physical properties
of the membrane in which the receptor is inserted, or as a
result of an integration of both [45, 58].
About cholesterol levels and their relation to gender, our
study showed that the decrease in total cholesterol levels
occurred in both men and women. Other authors have
reported a relationship between reduced cholesterol and
suicidal tendencies only in males [13, 59–62]. However, it is
worth noting that additional studies on the association
between
gender
and
serum
cholesterol
have
been
unconvincing.
Segoviano-Mendoza et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:7 
Page 4 of 7
 A lack of consistency between different published re-
ports coupled with the fact that, to date, it has not been
possible to identify a cholesterol threshold level capable of
precipitating a psychiatric disorder, suggests the presence
of a non-linear relationship.
The existence of reports in which depression has been
associated with increased cholesterol levels would support
this hypothesis. A possible explanation for this, proposed
the involvement of monoamine oxidase (MAO). The
aforementioned model studies associated hypercholester-
olemia with depression in hypercholesterolemic mice via
monoaminergic metabolism. Specifically, they reported in-
creased monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B activity in
the hippocampus of mice [63, 64]. Thus providing one
possible reason why elevated levels of cholesterol are able
to produce depression much like decreased levels are able
to, but via independent mechanisms.
Besides total cholesterol, other studies that investi-
gated the link between triglycerides, HDL cholesterol
and LDL cholesterol, observed contrasting results be-
tween different populations. Our results showed higher
levels of triglycerides in subjects with MDD and MDD
associated with suicide attempt. These findings do not
coincide with data previously reported in 2015 that ob-
served decreased levels of triglycerides in subjects with
suicidal attempts [65]. However, other authors report
conflicting findings, even suggesting a positive associ-
ation between triglyceride levels and the risk of suicidal
behavior [15]. Considering LDL cholesterol levels, our
results coincide with the conclusions of a meta-analysis
published in 2016, which included a total of 36 different
studies and found overall association between lower
LDL levels and depression [66]. With respect to VLDL
levels, which were significantly higher in MDD versus
healthy controls, it is worth noting that few studies re-
port VLDL levels. Taking this into consideration, our re-
sult is different from the result reported in a previous
study [67] that showed significantly lower levels while
our results demonstrate higher levels. With respect to
HDL cholesterol levels, our results did not demonstrate
significant differences when comparing subjects with
MDD, subjects with MDD associated with suicide at-
tempt and the control group. This fact contrasts with
previous studies in which significant differences in HDL
cholesterol between subjects with attempted suicide and
healthy controls were shown [59, 68].
Lastly, we found a significant association between ele-
vated triglyceride levels versus MDD and MDD with sui-
cide attempt. Our finding coincides with a previous
study which found a correlation between depressive
symptoms and triglyceride levels [69] and suggestions by
others which postulate that high triglyceride levels are
associated with Type A personality traits, such as hostil-
ity, anger and domineering attitudes [70].
Several limitations of this study deserve to be mentioned.
First, because our study is based on a case-control design,
temporality could be not inferred with certainty. Whether
hypocholesterolemia is a risk factor for developing depression
and suicide attempt or merely an associated epiphenomenon
can not be assured with certainty; second, we did not meas-
ure 24 S-hydroxycholesterol levels, which is a peripheral bio-
marker of brain cholesterol metabolism. However, it is
expected that reduction of total cholesterol would reduce 24
S-hydroxycholesterol [71]. Besides, we did not evaluate diet-
ary intake; however, because subjects in the groups of the
study were enrolled from the same socio-cultural and eco-
nomic background, it is expected that customary diets were
similarly distributed. Finally, an additional limitation of our
study is that we did not analyze the cardiovascular risk asso-
ciated with serum cholesterol concentrations. In the future, it
will be important to profoundly analyze the contradictory re-
sults reported with regard to cholesterol's role in depression.
[63, 64]. This would help to verify if cholesterol is, in fact, a
viable biomarker for neuropsychiatric disorders. It is evident
that these results may be extrapolated only to a population
that is similar to our own with similar exclusion criteria.
Strengths of our study include the inclusion of incident cases
of suicide attempt, which is a recognized tool to minimize
analysis bias in the cross-sectional studies; also, the exclusion
of individuals with lipid-lowering drugs allows us to control
the potential source of bias.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results show that hypocholesterolemia is
independently associated with depression and suicide at-
tempt in adults of the Mexican population .This finding, if
consistent in more studies in our population, could influ-
ence public health policies focused in the prevention of
mental health disorders. Measuring cholesterol levels could
be a minimally invasive, inexpensive and simple way to pre-
dict suicide risk in our population. The use of cholesterol
levels as a biomarker would permit clinicians to efficiently
obtain a laboratory result that, once combined with clinical
evaluations and symptoms, could permit a more timely
diagnosis. Additionally, it would be necessary to calculate
the sensibility and specificity of this test in our population.
