Key Points
• First-in-human, phase 1 study,
recombinant ADAMTS-13 was
safe, nonimmunogenic, and
tolerated in congenital
thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura.
• Recombinant ADAMTS-13
pharmacokinetic profile was
comparable to plasma
infusion studies, with
evidence of pharmacodynamic
activity.
Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of recombinant ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin and
metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13; BAX 930; SHP655)
were investigated in 15 patients diagnosed with severe congenital ADAMTS-13 deficiency
(plasma ADAMTS-13 activity <6%) in a prospective phase 1, first-in-human, multicenter
dose escalation study. BAX 930 was well tolerated, no serious adverse events occurred,
and no anti-ADAMTS-13 antibodies were observed. After single-dose administration of
BAX 930 at 5, 20, or 40 U/kg body weight to adolescents and adults, there was approximate
dose proportionality with respect to maximum plasma concentration (Cmax [U/mL]) and
area under the concentration–time curve (AUC [h∙U/mL]). Dose-related increases of
individual ADAMTS-13:Ag and activity were observed and reached a maximum within
1 hour. With escalating BAX 930 doses administered, a dose-dependent persistence of
ADAMTS-13-mediated von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleavage products and reduced VWF
multimeric size were observed. This study demonstrated that pharmacokinetic param-
eters of BAX 930 were comparable to those estimated in previous plasma infusion studies
and provided evidence of pharmacodynamic activity. This study was registered at www.
clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02216084. (Blood. 2017;130(19):2055-2063)
Introduction
The plasma metalloprotease ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin and metal-
loproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) is a
constitutively active enzymethat cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF)
at the Tyr1605–Met1606 bond in the A2 domain, an otherwise cryptic
site rendered susceptible, by the application of shear stress, to regu-
late the size of VWF multimers.1 VWF is a multimeric glycoprotein
synthesized principally by vascular endothelial cells.2 The inability to
cleave ultralarge (UL) VWF multimers into smaller forms as a result of
congenital or acquired ADAMTS-13 deficiency results in thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare potentially fatal disorder of the
microcirculation caused by increased binding of platelets to UL VWF.3
The congenital form of TTP (cTTP, previously termed hereditary
TTP or Upshaw-Schulman syndrome) is an ultrarare, although likely
underestimated, condition with a prevalence of approximately 1 case
per million.4,5 It exhibits an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance
caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
both ADAMTS-13 alleles on chromosome 9.6 The nature of the
mutations is diverse and includes single amino acid missense sub-
stitution (approximately 60%), as well as nonsense, frame-shift,
splice site mutations and deletions and insertions (collectively,
approximately 40%).1,7-9
The principal pathophysiology arises from platelet aggregates in
the microcirculation affecting critical organs, including the brain, heart,
and kidneys. TTP crises are associated with cerebral vascular inci-
dents in at least 30% of patients, with a risk for neurologic sequelae in
approximately 20% of patients.10 Acute renal failure has been reported
in 11% of patients with severe cTTP,11 and chronic, possibly progressive,
renal involvement is often seen. Sudden cardiac death resulting from
myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmia has also been
reported.12
Although considered a monogenetic disorder, the clinical pre-
sentation of cTTP is variable. Symptoms develop soon after birth
in some patients, whereas others remain asymptomatic until the
second or third decade of life. This phenotypic variability is thought

From 
 to be related to the causative mutations and the level of plasma
ADAMTS-13 activity.13,14 In the newborn, cTTP typically pre-
sents as neonatal jaundice and thrombocytopenia,3 whereas in early
childhood, symptomatic episodes are often associated with in-
tercurrent infections or vaccinations. Among patients with cTTP
presenting with a first TTP episode later in life, pregnancy is often
the inciting event.15 Intrauterine fetal death is common in patients
with cTTP who do not receive regular plasma therapy throughout
pregnancy.16,17 Other precipitants associated with increased VWF
levels, such as infection, surgery, and alcohol binge drinking,
provide additional triggers for acute TTP events.18-22 Despite the
wide range of ages of the first TTP event, most patients with cTTP
subsequently demonstrate a chronic, relapsing course and require
prophylactic treatment to prevent long-term neurological, renal,
and other sequelae.
There are no drugs currently approved for the specific treatment
of cTTP. Acute TTP episodes are generally treated with infusions
of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or solvent/detergent-treated plasma,
typically 10 to 20 mL/kg body weight (BW). Some intermediate-
purity FVIII:VWF concentrates have been shown to contain low
levels of ADAMTS-13 and have been used as an alternative
treatment in select patient populations.23 Although the half-life of
infused plasma ADAMTS-13 was found to be 2 to 4 days,24
prophylaxis with 10 to 15 mL plasma /kg BW every 2 to 3 weeks
has been shown to be effective in preventing acute episodes in the
majority of patients with TTP.6,25,26
Although the treatment of TTP via plasma infusions is generally
effective, the therapy is frequently complicated by allergic and
anaphylactic reactions or volume overload.27 Plasma infusions also
carry risks for infection as a result of bloodborne pathogens. In
addition, plasma infusions carried out in the hospital or outpatient
settings are burdensome and time-consuming, and can be stressful
for younger patients. As such, the development of a recombinant
ADAMTS-13 (BAX 930; SHP 655; rADAMTS-13) represents
a potential new therapeutic option to improve the current standard
of care.
In this phase 1, first-in-human study, we investigated the safety,
including immunogenicity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
(PKs), of rADAMTS-13 in patients diagnosed with severe con-
genital ADAMTS-13 deficiency to establish dosing for future
studies.
Methods
Design
This was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, first-in-human dose
escalation study on safety, immunogenicity, tolerability and PKs of BAX
930 in patients diagnosed with cTTP assigned to 1 of 3 dose cohorts,
receiving a single dose of BAX 930 at 5, 20, or 40 U/kg BW, where 1 unit is
approximately equivalent to the ADAMTS-13 activity in 1 mL plasma.
The study comprised 2 dose-escalation steps. Fifteen patients were enrolled
(of 16 screened; 1 was unable to participate because of a scheduling conflict)
and dosed sequentially. Participants were recruited to the next higher
dose level only after short-term safety had been demonstrated and
reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee at the
preceding dose level. The study was approved by the responsible ethics
committees or institutional review boards and regulatory authorities. The
study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02216084. All
participants gave written informed consent. Data were analyzed by
biostatisticians at Shire and Quintiles; all authors had access to primary
clinical trial data.
Patients
The principal inclusion criteria consisted of a documented diagnosis of
severe congenital ADAMTS-13 deficiency (baseline plasma ADAMTS-13
activity , 6%) confirmed by genetic testing, ages 12 to 65 years, and the
absence of severe TTP symptoms at the time of screening. This included
stable laboratory parameters (platelet count, .100 3 109/L; lactate
dehydrogenase [LDH] ,3 times the upper limit of normal). Evidence of
end organ damage such as stroke, heart, renal disease, or abnormal liver
function tests were further exclusions to study enrollment. Patients with a
medical history or presence of functional neutralizing ADAMTS-13
inhibitor at screening, a medical history of immunological or autoimmune
disorders, or significant neurological events were excluded. A sample size
of 14 was selected on the basis of feasibility.
Study drug and treatments
BAX 930 is a fully glycosylated recombinant human ADAMTS-13 protein
produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system in a
plasma protein-freemilieu. The cellculture andpurificationprocessesusedin the
manufacture of BAX 930 do not employ additives of human or animal ori-
gin. The purification process of BAX 930 is based on chromatography using
conventionally available resins, including anion exchange, hydroxyapatite,
mixed mode (hydrophobic interaction), and cation exchange. In addition, BAX
930 undergoes 2 dedicated virus reduction steps: solvent/detergent treatment and
nanofiltration. The final product is lyophilized for intravenous injection. The
sterile,lyophilizedBAX930wasstoredin10-mLvials,whichwerereconstituted
with 5 mL sterile water, giving the solution a nominal strength of 300 U/mL that
is stable for 3 hours at room temperature after reconstitution. BAX 930 was
infused at a rate of 2 to 4 mL/minute. In patients receiving regular prophylaxis,
there was at least a 10-day window between their last prophylactic treatment and
their BAX 930 dose.
Safety assessments
Patients were hospitalized for at least 96 hours after investigational product
infusion for safety observation and PK assessments. Follow-up visits were
scheduled 12 days and 30 days (or 6, 9, and 12 days for the 2 participating
adolescents) postinfusion. Safety was evaluated through clinical assessment,
hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation tests, antibodies against
ADAMTS-13 or CHO cell protein, viral serology, cardiac troponin, D-dimers,
and seromarkers for brain or renal impairment. Adverse events (AEs) were
recordedthroughoutthestudy,butspecificallybythepatientinadiary,beginning
96 hours postinfusion until the study completion visit.
ADAMTS-13 and VWF assays
ADAMTS-13 activity was calculated by analysis of fluorescence over time,
using the synthetic fluorogenic VWF73 peptide substrate (FRETS-VWF73) and
a commercially available, chromogenic GST-VWF73-based ADAMTS-13-
activity ELISA (Technozym� ADAMTS-13 Activity ELISA).28,29 ADAMTS-13
antigen was measured using a validated sandwich ELISA employing anti-
human-ADAMTS-13 antibodies.30-32 VWF:RCo and VWF:Ag were determined
as previously described.33,34
Analysis of VWF multimers was performed using sodium dodecyl
sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by western blotting and
sensitive luminescence detection.4,35 VWF degradation products generated
by ADAMTS-13-mediated cleavage were assessed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed
by western blotting and immunostaining with a horseradish peroxidase‐labeled
polyclonal rabbit antihuman VWF antibody with enhanced chemiluminescence
detection.4,35,36
Immunogenicity assessments
Total binding antibodies to ADAMTS-13 were measured by ELISA-based
assays, detecting total immunoglobin (IgG, IgA, IgM). Neutralizing
antibodies to ADAMTS-13 were measured using a Bethesda-like approach
with the ADAMTS-13 activity assay.37

 Pharmacokinetic assessments
PK parameters, including area under the concentration-time curve (AUC
[h∙U/mL]), plasma half-life (t1/2 [hours]), clearance (Cl [mL/kg/hours]), mean
residence time (MRT [hours]), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss
[mL/kg]), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax [U/mL]), and incremental
recovery(IR [U/mL]) were assessedforADAMTS-13 activityand ADAMTS-13
antigen (ADAMTS-13:Ag). Concentrations were measured at standardized time
points: within 60 minutes preinfusion and 15, 30, 60 minutes and 3, 6, 9, 12, 24,
48, 96, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, and 288 hours postinfusion in adults. The
2adolescentsubjects(16and17yearsofage)hadsparsesamplingpreinfusionand
at 6, 48, 144, 216, and 288 hours postinfusion. The hematology and clinical
chemistry assessments, conducted as part of the safety assessments (see earlier),
wereperformedonEDTAanticoagulatedwholebloodandserum,respectively,at
the screening visit, just before investigational product infusion, and at regular
increments up to 288 hours postinfusion. The hematology panel included platelet
counts, and the clinical chemistry panel included serum LDH, both of which were
used for assessing the pharmacodynamic effects of BAX 930.
Statistical analysis
ADAMTS-13 concentration data were analyzed using a noncompartmental
approach, and individual PK parameter estimates were derived. Total AUC0‐
‘ was calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule up to the last quantifiable
concentration with a tail area correction. Terminal plasma half-life was
determined from the terminal rate constant obtained by log-linear fitting of a
regression line by the least squares deviation method to the last 5 quantifiable
concentrations that were above preinfusion levels. MRT was calculated as
total area under the moment curve divided by the total area under the curve
corrected for the duration of the infusion. Systemic clearance (Cl) was
calculated as dose per body mass (kg) divided by AUC0‐‘. IR was calculated
as Cmax divided by dose per body mass.
To better address the variability in baseline ADAMTS-13 levels, a
population PK model was also developed. A 2-compartment model with first-
order elimination and constant rate infusion was selected iteratively among
different structural and stochastic candidates and provided population PK
parameter estimates. Individual PK parameters from a noncompartmental
approach and from the population PK model were similar.

Results
Fifteen patients received study drug: 3 each in the 5 and 20 U/kg dose
cohorts, and 9 in the 40 U/kg dose cohort (Figure 1; Table 1); 2 patients
in the 40 U/kg cohort were adolescents. All patients completed the
study. Doses administered were within 0.3 U/kg of the planned doses,
with the exception of 1 patient who received 47.5 U/kg instead of the
planned 40 U/kg.

From 
 ADAMTS-13 activity
After the single infusion of BAX 930, dose-related increases in
ADAMTS-13 FRETS-VWF73 concentrations were observed (data
from the 40 U/kg cohort shown in Figure 2). ADAMTS-13 activity
remainedquantifiablefor24hoursinthe5U/kgcohort,for240hoursin
the20U/kgcohort,andforthefull288-hourstudyperiodinthe40U/kg
cohort. ADAMTS-13 activities measured by FRETS-VWF73 and
chromogenic assay methods were highly comparable (Table 2).
In the 40 U/kg cohort, the geometric mean of IR was
0.0232 (U/mL∙kg/U), mean terminal half-life was 59.2 hours, and
initial half-life was 17.0 hours for ADAMTS-13 activity (FRETS-
VWF73). ADAMTS-13 activity, Cmax, and total exposures increased
approximately in proportion to the dose escalations. The geometric
mean Cmax was 0.398 U/mL after 20 U/kg infusion and 0.948 U/mL
after 40U/kg infusion;the geometric mean AUC(0-inf) was 19.1 U∙h/mL
after 20 U/kg infusion and 53.1 U∙h/mL after 40 U/kg infusion.
With the more sensitive chromogenic ELISA assay (lower limit of
quantitation [LLOQ]: 0.0073 U/mL compared with 0.05 U/mL for
FRETS-VWF73), low levels of ADAMTS-13 activity were measur-
able at the preinfusion time in all patients except 1 adult and both
adolescents.
Despite the differences in the LLOQ, activity measurements by
FRETS-VWF73 and chromogenic assay methods were otherwise
similar (Table 2).
ADAMTS-13 antigen
ADAMTS-13 antigen (ADAMTS-13:Ag) concentrations at pre-
dose (baseline) were low, ranging from 0.003 to 0.031 U/mL, but
quantifiable in all but 2 patients (1 patient each in the 5 and 40 U/kg
dose cohorts). Individual postdose ADAMTS-13:Ag levels remained
quantifiable in all samples up to the last collection at 288 hours
postdose and were higher than baseline (predose) values.
The geometric mean of ADAMTS-13:Ag Cl was 61.5 mL/h, and of
Vss was 5300 mL (at 40 U/kg dose level), suggesting the protein
distributed primarily within the intravascular compartment.38 There
was approximate dose proportionality with respect to Cmax (geometric
means of 0.323 mg/mL after 20 U/kg infusion and 0.672 mg/mL after
40 U/kg infusion) and AUC(0-inf) (geometric means of 18.3 mg∙h/mL
after 20 U/kg infusion and 36.0 mg∙h/mL after 40 U/kg infusion).
The PK parameter estimates for ADAMTS-13:Ag were compa-
rable to ADAMTS-13 activity. Above the 5 to 40 U/kg dose range,
ADAMTS-13:Ag geometric mean Cmax increased 5-fold between
5 and 20 U/kg, and approximately proportional to the dose between
20 and 40 U/kg (2.1-fold) (Table 2). The fold increases in geometric
mean total exposures (AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-inf)) were approximately
proportional to the dose increase for both dose level comparisons.
ADAMTS-13 activity and ADAMTS-13 antigen in adolescents
The available concentration data for both ADAMTS-13 activity and
ADAMTS-13:Ag, did not suggest any major differences between
adolescents and adults. Despite the low number of adolescents in the
study (n 5 2) and reduced sampling per protocol, ADAMTS-13
activity, IR, t1/2, and AUC were generally within the data ranges for
adults treated at the same dose level (40 U/kg). The estimated
clearances for the 2 adolescent subjects were 64.9 and 54.5 mL/h,
respectively, which were within the range observed for adult subjects
(n 5 7; range, 44.4-115 mL/h).
Pharmacodynamic effects
In addition to the small, intermediate, and large multimeric sizes typically
present in normal plasma, UL VWF multimers were observed in the
samples collected before dosing, at screening or predose, in all patients,
and at most points postdose. The trend for decreasing large multimers,
includingULmultimers,andincreasinglevelsoftheintermediatefraction
was observed during the first 12 to 24 hours postinfusion in individual
profiles at BAX 930 doses of 20 or 40 U/kg before slowly returning to
preinfusion levels during a 288-hour period (Figure 3B).
Likewise, an apparent dose-dependent effect was seen with the
detection of ADAMTS-13-mediated VWF cleavage products. In the
5 U/kg dose cohort, ADAMTS-13-mediated VWF cleavage products
were present up to 3 hours postdose in all patients (100%) and up to
6 hours postdose in 1 patient (33.3%), and no longer detectable

From 
 thereafter (Figure 3A). ADAMTS-13-mediated VWF cleavage products
were observed during a longer period of time at higher dose levels: for
20 U/kg, up to 24 hours postdose in all patients and up to 48 hours in
2patients(66.7%);for40U/kg,upto48hourspostdoseinallpatientsand
as long as 264 hours in 1 patient (14.3%) (Figure 3C).
In addition, the function of VWF to bind platelet GPIb, as measured
by the VWF:RCo assay, was lower than mean baseline levels at
most points across the 3 dose levels and decreased by approximately
30% within the first 9 hours. A modest decrease in LDH of 5% to 10%
relative tobaseline was also observedinthe first 48 hours postinfusion.
Inaddition, althoughsubjectsinthisstudy werenot experiencing acute
manifestations of cTTP, there was an increasing trend in the platelet
count up to 6 days after infusion in all dosing cohorts (Figure 4).
Safety
BAX 930 was well tolerated in all 15 patients, and no patient exhibited
anaphylaxis or other allergic manifestations. No serious AEs, AEs
leading to discontinuation from the study, or breakthrough TTP
events were seen in the study after treatment. Overall, 12 of 15 pa-
tients (80.0%) reported at least 1 temporally emergent AE (TEAE;
supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site). Three
subjects, all in the 40 U/kg BAX 930 cohort (40 U/kg: 3/9 subjects,
33.3%; overall: 3/15 subjects, 20.0%) reported a total of 5 TEAEs
considered by the investigators to be temporally associated with BAX
930 infusion: decrease in VWF antigen and VWF activity at 30
minutes postinfusion, returning to normal activity levels at 1 hour
postinfusion (n 5 1), flatulence (n 5 1), or nausea on 2 separate days
(n 5 1). No trends were observed over time or among the 3 dose cohorts
in the laboratory parameters, vital sign assessments, electrocardiogram
measurements, or physical examination.
Immunogenicity evaluation
All anti-ADAMTS-13 neutralizing antibody results were less than
0.6 BU/mL across the 3 dose cohorts and at all 3 scheduled times; that
is, screening, infusion predose, and study completion, day 28 63 days.
None of the 15 patients who received BAX 930 exhibited anti-
ADAMTS-13 binding antibodies at any time in the study. Similarly, all
patients tested negative for anti-CHO protein antibodies at all times.
Discussion
Recombinant ADAMTS-13 potentially offers a novel option for the
treatment of cTTP, eliminating many of the risks associated with
products derived from human plasma and facilitating the introduction
of more precise and individualized dosing regimens.24,39-43 In our
prospective, dose-escalating clinical trial, we investigated the safety,
tolerability, and PK of BAX 930 infused for the first time in humans.

From 
 BAX 930 was expected to behave in the same way as endogenous
ADAMTS-13, as demonstrated in several nonclinical in vitro and in
vivo studies. In current clinical practice, infusions of 10 to 20 mL/kg
FFP are recommended for treating acute episodes or prophylaxis
of cTTP.44-46 As such, a low dose of 5 U/kg, an intermediate dose of
20 U/kg, and a high dose of 40 U/kg BAX 930 were chosen for this
study. The 40 U/kg dose has been calculated to correspond to doses of
ADAMTS-13 typically administered during single-volume plasma
exchange sessions.47
As would be expected in this population of patients with cTTP,
predosebaseline levels of ADAMTS-13:Ag and ADAMTS-13 activity
(assessed by both FRETS-VWF73 and chromogenic ELISA assays)
were very low or below the LLOQ. Immediately after infusion of all
doses, of BAX 930 there was an increase in individual ADAMTS-
13:Ag and activity observed, reaching a maximum within 1 hour
postinfusion. Similar ADAMTS-13:Ag, ADAMTS-13 FRETS-
VWF73, and ADAMTS-13 activity ELISA profiles suggest good
correlation between protein concentrations and activity. No apparent
differences were observed for ADAMTS-13 activity and ADAMTS-
13:Ag between adolescents (n 5 2) and adults (n 5 7), treated with
the same BAX 930 doses.
Overall, there was evidence suggesting dose proportionality with
respect to AUC(0-inf) and Cmax (Table 2; Figure 5). The change in the
geometric mean Cmax for 5 to 20 U/kg was approximately 5-fold, and
was approximately 2.4-fold for 20 to 40 U/kg. Greater increases were
observed for geometric mean AUC(0-inf) (47-fold for 5 to 20 U/kg
and 3.1-fold for 20 to 40 U/kg), which could be attributable to
concentrations falling below the LLOQ at lower doses. Available data
for AUC(0-inf) showed an approximately 2.8-fold increase in exposure
for dose increases from 20 to 40 U/kg. Available data at the 20 and
40 U/kg dose levels show no major changes in Cl, Vss, t1/2, and
MRT(0-inf) with increasing dose.
PK parameters derived from the noncompartmental and
population PK approaches were consistent. In the population
PK model, a shorter initial half-life was observed followed
by a longer terminal half-life. Whether the initial phase is a
result of VWF binding, consumption of ADAMTS-13 activity,
or distribution to another physiologic compartment remains to
be determined.
In addition tothe PK results, evidence of pharmacodynamicactivity
was observed. With escalating BAX 930 doses, prolonged detectable
ADAMTS-13-mediated VWF cleavage products were present, in line
with dose-related increases of ADAMTS-13:Ag and activity. Specif-
ically, detectable ADAMTS-13-mediated VWF cleavage products
were present in all patients (100%) and up to 48 hours after the highest
dose, 40 U/kg. Patients with cTTP typically exhibit UL molecular
weight forms of VWF at baseline consistent with the severe reduction in
ADAMTS-13activity.Atrendfordecreasinglargemultimers,afraction
of which also included UL multimers, and increasing levels of
the intermediate fraction was observed during the first 24 hours
postinfusion in individual profiles at BAX 930 doses of 20 or 40 U/kg.
In addition, during the first 9 hours, the mean postdose VWF:RCo
levels decreased by approximately 30%. There was also an increase
in the platelet count in all dosing groups. Taken together, these
findings provide evidence of in vivo ADAMTS-13 activity after
BAX 930 administration.

From 
 This study demonstrated that the protein antigen and activity PK
parameters of BAX 930 were comparable to those estimated from
previousstudiesofADAMTS-13administeredtopatientswithcTTPas
a constituent of FFP. Furlan et al24 reported limited PK data in patients
treated with FFP and demonstrated that the recovery was nearly 100%
and the half-life was 2.1 to 3.3 days. Similar results were reported by
Fujimuraetal.43The comparabilityofplasma-derivedandrecombinant
ADAMTS-13 PKs suggests dosing regimens in future studies of
the long-term safety and efficacy of BAX930 can be modeled on
the clinical experiences with plasma-based regimens. No patients
developed an inhibitor to ADAMTS-13 during this single-dose study.
The lack of an apparent immune response will need to be confirmed in
the upcoming pivotal study in which patients will be repeatedly
exposed to BAX 930 for approximately 1 year.
In conclusion, BAX 930 appeared to be safe and well-tolerated over
a dose range of 5 to 40 U/kg in patients with cTTP, and there was no
evidence of an immune response to BAX 930 after a single infusion.
The activity PK parameters were comparable to those estimated from
FFP studies and demonstrated approximate dose proportionality with
respect to Cmax and AUC. Finally, there was evidence for BAX 930
