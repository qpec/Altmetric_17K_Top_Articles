ABSTRACT
Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disease that causes cognitive impairment
and dementia. Within the US, AD is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, affecting 1 in 10
people over the age of 65. Sleep disturbance has been called a “public health epidemic” and, like depression,
is a prodromal symptom of AD but may also contribute to the risk of developing AD. It was hypothesized that
sleep disturbance, depression, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype increase the likelihood of AD.
Methods: Utilizing data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, information from evaluations
of 11,453 cognitively asymptomatic participants was analyzed. Survival analysis was used to explore the
independent relationships between depression, sleep disturbance, and APOE genotypes with eventual AD
diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to explore the main effects and synergistic effects of
psychosocial factors as moderated by APOE genotypes.
Results: This study reinforced the association between APOE and AD. The hazard of developing AD was
eight times higher for those with recent depression and the Ɛ4 homozygote (HR = 8.15 [3.70–17.95]). Among
Ɛ4 carriers with clinician-verified depression, the hazard was ten times that of the reference group (HR =
10.11 [4.43–23.09]). The hazard for Ɛ4 carriers reporting sleep disturbance was almost 7 times greater than
the reference group (HR = 6.79 [2.38–19.37]).
Conclusion: Findings suggest that sleep disturbance, depression, and APOE Ɛ4 genotype are associated with
AD during follow-up evaluations among a group of initially cognitively asymptomatic participants. This study
contributes to the literature base exploring an increased hazard or risk of AD due to potential modifiable risk
factors as well as genetic biomarkers, such as APOE.

AD dementia is a neurodegenerative brain disease
that causes cognitive impairment and dementia.
The neurodegeneration in the brain eventually
manifests as clinically evident deficits in memory,
thinking, and behavior (Meng and D’Arcy, 2013).
While clinical symptoms may become apparent
as the disease progresses, research indicates that
AD lacks a clear time of onset; it is therefore
conceptualized more aptly as a “pathophysiological

pathophysiological features of AD as much as 20
years before cognitive symptom onset (Bateman
et al., 2012). Additionally, many who are eventually
diagnosed with AD dementia encounter a stage of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prior to receiving
a diagnosis of dementia due to AD pathology
(McKhann et al., 2011).
AD dementia currently affects more than 39.9
million people worldwide. In 2015, it is expected
that 473,000 people will be diagnosed with AD
in the US (Alzheimer’s Association, 2015); that
number is expected to triple over the next 40 years
(Barnes and Yaffe, 2011). In the US, there were

5.4 million cases of AD in 2013, and 10% of those
cases were in people over the age of 65 (Donix et al.,
2012). In addition, 32% of Americans 85 and older
are diagnosed with AD dementia (CDC, 2013).
Currently, there is no cure for AD, and while the
mortality rates in other disease groups from 2000
to 2010 have decreased, such as heart disease by
16%, stroke by 23%, and prostate cancer by 8%, AD
mortality has increased by 68% (Thies and Bleiler,
2013).
Age is the strongest predictor of AD dementia,
irrespective of one’s ethnic background (Fortune
et al., 2013). Similarly, there are differences in
prevalence based on ethnic background: non-
Hispanic Whites have higher mortality rates than
non-Hispanic African Americans and those of
Hispanic descent (CDC, 2013). A predisposition
to vascular disease has been posited as one possible
explanation of the disparity by race. Vascular risk
factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
and high cholesterol have been hypothesized to act
as independent and aggregate risk factors for AD
dementia in epidemiologic studies (Qiu et al., 2010;
Reitz et al., 2010). Accounts regarding the exact
vascular risk for AD development in the literature
remain conflicted (Chui et al., 2012). Lifetime risk
of AD due to dementia is also strongly predicted by
sex; women have a 30% higher risk of dying from
AD than men, owing in part to the longer life span
of women (CDC, 2013).
Investigations are ongoing regarding the role
of depression in AD development. Depression
is a neuropsychiatric disorder; with symptoms
including depressed mood, loss of pleasure in usual
activities, weight and appetite fluctuations, sleep
disturbance, psychomotor changes, and fatigue
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). In the
search for a genetic basis for depression, López-
León et al. (2008) discovered that APOE Ɛ2 was
the most strongly correlated with depression out of
the genes explored in their meta-analysis. Although
APOE Ɛ2 is associated with depression (López-León
et al., 2008), this gene is considered to be protective
with respect to AD (Talbot et al., 1994). The
relationship between depression and AD dementia
is complicated by questions of reverse causation.
It remains unclear whether depression is an early
expression of AD pathology or whether depression
beginning early in adult life is a risk factor for AD
pathology (Marques et al., 2010).
Like
depression,
the
contribution
of
sleep
disturbance
to
AD
risk
is
continuing.
Sleep
disturbance is a hallmark symptom of depression
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013), but sleep
issues also increase one’s risk for depression (Kumar
and Chanana, 2014). Correlations between mild,
moderate, and major depressive disorder and
insomnia have been found with regard to AD risk
(Pistacchi et al., 2014). Recent sleep research has
shown that the sleep process removes neurotoxins
from the brain by flushing out interstitial proteins.
One such interstitial protein is β-amyloid, a peptide
derived from the amyloid precursor protein and a
main factor in the deposits found in the brains of
those diagnosed with AD (Mendelsohn and Larrick,
2013). In mice, β-amyloid cleared twice as fast in
sleeping mice compared to those that were awake
(Xie et al., 2013). Disrupted sleep has been related
to increased levels of β-amyloid in the brains of
older adults. Though the direction of causation
is still unresolved, empirical studies indicate that
sleep
disturbance
may
subsequently
result
in
neurodegeneration. One investigation found that
mice subjected to sleep deprivation possessed
an increase in β-amyloid plaques (compared to
controls), indicating that the disruption of circadian
rhythms may increase risk of AD (Kumar and
Chanana, 2014). Conversely, in APOE Ɛ4 carriers,
sleeping without disruption may decrease the risk of
developing AD (Lim et al., 2013).
Sleep
disturbance
may
be
an
issue
for
those
diagnosed
with
AD
(Yesavage
et
al.,
2004), especially sleep fragmentation (Kumar and
Chanana, 2014). At least half of community-
dwelling adults over the age of 65 report a sleep
problem. Among those with dementia, 25% to
50% suffer from sundowning or chronic nighttime
unsettled sleep (Anderson and Bradley, 2013).
Of those diagnosed with AD, 25% experience a
circadian disturbance: a disorder in the 24-hour
sleep cycle (Weldemichael and Grossberg, 2010).
Extended sleep length has been noted to be
significant risk factor for AD. Those who slept less
than seven hours a day or more than eight hours a
day at baseline had lower scores on two measures of
cognitive function compared to subjects who slept
between seven and eight hours a day (Virta et al.,
2013).
A focus on neurodegenerative disease develop-
ment requires attention to both the psychosocial
factors
aforementioned,
as
well
as
hereditary
and genetic factors. First-degree relatives have a
considerably increased risk of developing AD. Twin
studies suggest that heritability may reach or exceed
70%, indicating that genetic transmission accounts
for a large portion of the variance associated with
AD. Due to the role of genetic and environmental
effects, family history has been referred to as a
“composite factor” (Donix et al., 2012, p. 299)
because this variable may include risks related to
heritability, apolipoprotein (APOE) Ɛ4, and lifestyle
or
environmental
factors
that
are
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
(Donix
et
al.,
2012).

Researchers continue to hypothesize about the
role of genetic factors in AD development.
Gene–environment interaction
Gene–environment interaction (Belsky et al., 2013)
offers a framework from which an examination of
susceptibility genes and environmental influences
can be situated. This model posits that different
genotypes may produce differing responses to
environmental factors, resulting in the possibility for
greater disease risk in some people versus others.
Major susceptibility genes have been identified,
such as APOE, which has been associated with
sporadic
late-onset
AD
cases
(Corder
et
al.,
1993; Saunders et al., 1993; Farrer et al., 1997).
This study describes the association of sleep
disturbance, depression, and APOE genotypes
among
cognitively
asymptomatic
older
adults
with a subsequent diagnosis of AD dementia.
Psychological conditions are investigated as a
product of environment and their influence on
eventual AD dementia development is investigated
independently and in interaction with genetic
factors. It is theorized that psychological factors
increase risk and certain apolipoprotein genotypes
can
moderate
that
risk,
either
increasing
or
decreasing the risk of AD development.
There are three forms of APOE: Ɛ2, Ɛ3, and
Ɛ4 (Schipper, 2011). The possible combinations
of APOE in humans are Ɛ2, Ɛ2; Ɛ2, Ɛ3; Ɛ2, Ɛ4;
Ɛ3,
Ɛ3;
Ɛ3,
Ɛ4; and
Ɛ4,
Ɛ4. The presence of
Ɛ2
is considered to be neuroprotective with respect
to developing AD (Talbot et al., 1994), while
the presence of
Ɛ3 and
Ɛ4 confer greater risks
(Schipper, 2011). Some have argued that Ɛ3 may be
neuroprotective relative to Ɛ4 (Aboud et al., 2012).
Compared to non-APOE Ɛ4 carriers, the risk is two
to four times greater in those with one Ɛ4 allele
and 12 times greater in those with two Ɛ4 alleles
(Hollingworth et al., 2011). The debate on the exact
mechanism of APOE Ɛ4 influence continues. One
study found APOE to be significantly associated
with late-onset AD (Ghebranious et al., 2011).
APOE Ɛ4 has been associated with earlier onset of
AD than non-carriers (de Oliveira et al., 2014). Two
studies (Brainerd et al., 2011; Brainerd et al., 2013)
confirmed the role of APOE Ɛ4 in leading to MCI
for those with normal cognition at baseline, but did
not support the theory that APOE is associated
with a transition to AD dementia development
among those with MCI or other types of cognitive
impairment.
This study focused on three hypotheses. First,
it was hypothesized that the presence of sleep
disturbance,
depression,
and
APOE
genotype,
as individual factors, increase the likelihood of
meeting
the
criteria
for
diagnosis
with
AD.
Second, it was hypothesized that the additive
effect of the psychosocial factors in the study in
concert with APOE genotype, especially genotypes
containing ɛ4, will increase the hazard of AD
development. Third, APOE is expected to moderate
the multiplicative effect of some psychosocial
conditions.
Methods
This study examined risk factors for sporadic, late-
onset AD through a secondary data analysis of
the NACC UDS. A prospective cohort design
was utilized with individuals who were cognitively
asymptomatic at the time of their initial visit
(n = 11,453). The analysis sought to determine
who among those initially unaffected demonstrated
clinical signs of AD dementia by their last visit.
Participants
The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center
began in 1999 as a repository for the standardized
longitudinal clinical evaluations that are collected
in
the
Alzheimer’s
Disease
Centers
(ADCs)
program. The original goal of the program was
to study the spectrum from normal cognition
(controls), MCI to AD dementia. NACC has
now expanded to include subtypes of dementia
beyond AD. Containing the evaluations of over
33,000 participants as of September 2015, the UDS
specifically captures prospective and longitudinal
assessment
information.
Participants
generally
present to an ADC yearly and provide information
on a total of 918 variables (Weintraub et al., 2009).
The sample in the current study was drawn from
the UDS (September 2014; n = 29,765). The
data used for this analysis was collected from 34
ADCs from visits conducted between September
2005 and September 2014. Subjects with dementia,
MCI, and cognitively intact subjects were recruited
by individual ADCs throughout the US. Though
it remains the largest sample of its kind in the
US, the UDS is not a nationally representative
sample of the US population with respect to AD
and dementia, as these subjects voluntarily present
for an examination at one of the participating
NIH/NIA sponsored ADCs. Participants may be
required by individual ADCs to agree to an autopsy
before acceptance as a research participant. Written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects
and designated informants.
Participants

for
this
study
were
cognitively asymptomatic at visit one (n = 11,453).

13.2% were African American, and 5.9% were from
other ethnic groups. Six percent of the sample
reported Hispanic origin. Almost 35% of subjects
reported that their mother had been diagnosed with
dementia, while 16.3% reported that their father
had been diagnosed with dementia. Almost 18%
of subjects reported depression in the last two

subjects or provided by a chosen close friend, family
member, neighbor, or caregiver. These interviews
acquire demographic information; family history;
medications used; health history; a physical; and
imaging and labs. Dementia status of parents and
siblings was obtained through self or informant
report. Participants respond to several rating scales
encompassing cognitive, physical, psychological,
and neuropsychological measures and a diagnosis
regarding dementia status is determined. Diagnoses
arising from these interviews are assigned either
by a consensus team or the examining physician
(NACC, 2010).
The variables utilized for this study include nor-
mal cognition, probable AD, self-report depression
in the last two years, other episodes of depression,
clinician-verified depression, sleep disturbance, and
APOE genotype. Sporadic late-onset AD (probable
AD) is the outcome of interest. Probable AD
was diagnosed within the UDS using criteria set
forth by the National Institute of Neurological and
Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the AD
and Related Disorders Association (McKhann et al.,
1984; McKhann et al., 2011).
Depression was measured in three different
ways in this study. The first variable included
depression
self-reported
by
the
participant
to
be active in the last two years. This includes
depressive disorders for which a clinician was
consulted, even if treatment or medication was
not received. Depression includes major depressive
disorder, situational depression, bipolar disorders,
dysthymic disorders, and other mood disorders.
The second variable, depression: other episodes,
includes self-reported depression episodes prior
to the last two years. For the purpose of this
study, depression: other episodes is considered to
be the measure of lifetime depression. The third
depression variable is the clinician’s judgment of
symptoms and measures the presence or absence of
depression. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association,
1994)
informed
the
clinician’s
diagnosis
of
depression.
Sleep disturbance is measured by a variable
recording the presence or absence of nighttime
behaviors. These behaviors include awakening
during the night, rising too early in the morning,
or taking excessive naps during the day. Issues with
sleep were measured utilizing the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), which measures
the presence or absence of psychiatric symptoms,
including sleep disturbance (Cummings, 1977).
The NPI-Q has demonstrated adequate test-retest
reliability and convergent validity for the individual
symptomology, with which the current study is
concerned (Kaufer et al., 2000).
APOE genotypes were collected for 8,378 out of
11,453 subjects with normal cognition at visit one.
The six possible genotypes (specified previously)
were collapsed for this analysis into
Ɛ3,
Ɛ3;
Ɛ3,
Ɛ4; and Ɛ4, Ɛ4 and an additional category, contains
Ɛ2 (Ɛ2,
Ɛ2;
Ɛ2,
Ɛ3;
Ɛ2,
Ɛ4). For the analysis,
Ɛ3,
Ɛ3 was used as the reference group, which
is the standard reference group utilized in the
literature (Multhammer et al., 2014; Luciano et al.,
2015) given its neutral properties with relation to
disease risk (de-Almada et al., 2012). APOE was
collected from participants by either buccal swab or
blood draw. APOE was also obtained at autopsy.
The methods of APOE obtainment varied by
ADC.
Survival analysis was used to estimate and
interpret hazard functions (Kleinbaum and Klein,
2012). Survival analysis is often used in instances
where researchers are concerned with time to event,

time until the onset of a disease, relapse from
a previous remission or recovery and return to
work for those who have benefitted from short-
and long-term disability, for example (Kleinbaum
and Klein, 2012). Survival analysis is the optimal
and most appropriate statistical analysis for time
to event data. This is especially true in cases of
staggered entry, such as is found in this dataset.
While Ordinary Least Squares or logistic regression
is used to estimate risk, survival analysis is touted
for its efficiency in using all available information
within a dataset (Kleinbaum and Klein, 2012). In
addition, one of the strengths of the longitudinal
design is that it allows each subject to serve as his/her
own control (Portney and Watkins, 2009).The
primary goal was to assess the relationship of
predictor variables with the eventual diagnosis of
AD dementia. The outcome variable was defined as
a diagnosis of probable AD, which then constituted
the failure point. Right censoring (Kleinbaum and
Klein, 2012) was utilized to account for the fact that
a subject was not necessarily diagnosed with AD
prior to their last observation. True survival time is
unobserved unless a subject’s diagnosis converts to
AD by their last observation. Time zero was equal to
the subject’s first observation (visit number 1). Sub-
jects had differing observation intervals, with visits
ranging from one to ten visits. Of the original 11,453
participants with normal cognition, 76% followed
up to the second visit, 58.5% followed up to the
third visit, 45% presented for a fourth visit, 34.5%
followed up to the fifth visit, and 25.5% presented
for the sixth visit. This number drops to 17.4% of
the original group for the seventh visit, 8.5% for
the eighth visit, and just over 2% for the ninth
visit. Observation intervals were measured in days.
Omitted responses were mapped to missing in order
to exclude the value from the analysis but retain all
other information from a participant’s visit.
A descriptive analysis of the baseline sample
was conducted and included distributions across
predictor variables, such as percentages, means,
and standard deviations, where applicable. Baseline
survival function was determined prior to the
addition of predictors and covariates (age, race,
maternal dementia, paternal dementia) in the
model. Log-rank tests for equality were used to
test for significant differences in survival curves
between the various response categories within each
predictor variable (such as: those reporting “yes”
to depression in the last two years versus those
reporting “no” to the same question).
The statistical software, STATA (StataCorp,
Release 14, 2015), was utilized for the analyses,
and a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant for the analysis, though p values of <
0.001 were also reported.
Four models were developed to explore the
main effects of the predictor variables. In the first
model, unadjusted main effects of each individual
predictor were examined. In the second model,
covariates such as sex, age, race, and dementia
status of parents were controlled. In the third model,
the primary predictor of interest was examined
in relation to the previous confounders with the
addition of APOE genotypes. In the final model,
all previous covariates were controlled as well as the
presence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
A similar structure was applied to the exploration
of interaction effects. The APOE genotype
Ɛ3,
Ɛ3
was
used
as
the
reference
group
for
all
analyses. The proportional hazards assumption was
tested for all main effects, additive models, and
interactions models. There was no evidence that
the proportional hazards assumption was violated.
The relationships of certain predictor variables
were examined relative to the outcome variable
using the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox,
1972). Regression modeling included simultaneous
control
of
multiple
predictors
and
covariates.
The main effects were examined, and covariates
such as sex, age, race, and dementia status of
parents were controlled. The effect modification
of primary predictors was tested, and the Efron
approximation was used as a method for handling
ties (Efron, 1977). Additive and multiplicative
effects were adjusted for demographic variables,
although parental dementia status was dropped as
a confounder due to a diminished sample size.
Both additive and multiplicative interactions were
tested given their differing underlying assumptions
about mortality and survival (Buckley, 1984).
While multiplicative interactions are often solely
reported, Buckley (1984) has noted that they may
be “biologically suspect they postulate that the force
of mortality attributable to the disease . . . is related
to the mortality rates for all other diseases” (p.
53). Additive effects or interactions are utilized
“when the effects of two or more identifiable and
independently acting causes of death are under
consideration” (p. 54). Though mortality is not
the outcome of interest here, additive effects are
desired as we examine two independently acting
causes of neurodegeneration. The assumption of
proportionality was examined in order to determine
whether the proportional hazards assumption had
been met.
Results
The minimum amount of time under observation
was 286 days until the first occasion that AD
diagnosis occurred, and the maximum was 3,229

days (M = 1,469.37; Mdn: 1,350.5 days). The
mean number of visits for those with normal
cognition was three (SD: 1.94), with a range of
one to ten visits. There were 330 diagnoses of AD
dementia (failures) by the end of the observation
period among older adults who had at least an initial
visit as well as a follow-up visit.
Preliminary
log-rank
tests
for
equality
of
survivor functions revealed that those who reported
depression
in
the
last
two
years,
clinician
verified depression, and sleep disturbance expressed
statistically significant (p < 0.001) different survival
curves than those who did not. The same was
true for those reporting lifetime depression versus
those who did not (p < 0.05). Visual inspection
of Kaplan–Meier plots were consistent with log-
rank tests. χ2 statistical analyses and t-tests were
performed to examine the relationships between
the psychosocial predictor variables and important
demographic covariates. The results of this analysis
are displayed in Table 3.
There was a significant association (p < 0.001)
between individuals reporting depression in the last
two years and the occurrence (diagnosis) of AD.
Specifically, in model one, those who self-reported
depression in the last two years experienced a
significantly higher risk of AD dementia diagnosis
(HR = 2.35 [95% CI, 1.88–2.94]) compared to
those who had not. When adjusted for age, sex, race,
and parental dementia in model two, the effect of
those who had self-reported depression symptoms
in the last two years was stronger compared to those
who had not (HR = 5.66 [3.34–9.60]). Adjusting
further for APOE genotype, the third model
remained significant (HR = 5.75 [3.28–10.07]).
The main effect of lifetime depression symptoms,
occurring more than two years earlier, presented a
significant risk of AD diagnosis within the follow-up
period compared to those who did not (HR = 1.35
[1.06–1.73]). When confounding covariates were
added to the second model, the significance was
much stronger (HR = 3.05 [1.75–5.23]). When the
APOE genotype was controlled, the hazard for those
who reported lifetime depression was similar (HR =
3.20 [1.78–5.73]).
Depression verified by a clinician was signific-
antly associated with the diagnosis of AD dementia
during the follow-up period as compared to those
without depression symptoms in model one (HR =
2.82 [2.21–3.59]). When adjusted for sex, age,
race, and parental dementia in the second model,
the hazard increased two-fold and presented a
stronger association (HR = 4.81 [2.79–8.30]).
When adjusted further for the effect of APOE
genotype as well as previous confounders, the
hazard rose again and remained significant in the
third model (HR = 5.50 [3.09–9.80]).
The presence of sleep disturbance was also
significantly associated with the eventual diagnosis
of AD dementia. In the first model, the hazard
was similar to that of self-reported depression
symptoms in the last two years, as well as clinician-
verified depression (HR = 2.72 [2.11–3.50]). When
adjusted for demographic confounders, the hazard
rose, and a stronger association between sleep dis-
turbance and AD diagnosis was discovered (HR =
3.39 [1.88–6.12]). After adjusting for the APOE
genotype, the hazard rose further and resulted in the
strongest association between sleep disturbance and
diagnosis of AD dementia in the period of follow-up
evaluation (HR = 4.08 [2.19–7.61]).
When
the
effect
of
APOE
genotype
was
considered as a main effect, those with two APOE Ɛ4
alleles experienced the highest hazard (HR = 3.22
[1.91–5.40]) compared to those with Ɛ3, Ɛ3. APOE
Ɛ3, Ɛ4 was also significant (p < 0.001), although
the hazard was significantly decreased (HR = 1.78
[1.37–2.31]). The main effect genotypes containing
Ɛ2 did not produce a significant result (HR =
0.935 [0.641–1.36]) as compared to the reference
group. When the main effect of APOE genotype
was adjusted for covariates, a considerably stronger
hazard was demonstrated for Ɛ4, Ɛ4 carriers and
with respect to eventual diagnosis of AD dementia
(HR = 5.95 [1.68–21.07], p < 0.05). Main effects
for all primary predictors are displayed in Table 4.
Additive interactions
In the additive effects models, the hazard of
developing AD was nine times higher for Ɛ4, Ɛ4
carriers with recent depression (HR = 8.15 [3.70–
17.95]) than for those without depression and with
two Ɛ3 alleles (reference group). Most remarkably,
when adjusted for demographic factors, the
Ɛ4,
Ɛ4 group with depression in the last two years
experienced a hazard almost 18 times that of
the reference group (HR = 17.71 [7.93–39.53]).
Interestingly, carriers with genotypes containing
Ɛ2 who also reported depression symptoms in the
last two years experienced a statistically significant
hazard of eventual AD development (HR = 2.28
[1.43–3.63]), even though the main effects model
for Ɛ2 did not demonstrate significance.
When exploring the additive effect of lifetime
depression and APOE genotype, only the Ɛ3, Ɛ4
(HR = 2.07 [1.19–3.57]) carriers exhibited a
significant association (p < 0.05) with AD diagnosis
during follow-up compared to the reference group.
When the additive effect of clinician-verified
depression and APOE genotype was analyzed, the
hazard for Ɛ3, Ɛ4 and Ɛ3, Ɛ4 was similar to previous
models (HR = 3.58 [2.02–6.32]), while the hazard
for Ɛ4, Ɛ4 carriers was ten times that of the reference

group (HR = 10.11 [4.43–23.09]). Remarkably, the
hazard of those with Ɛ4, Ɛ4 almost doubled when
adjusted for covariates, with hazards 20 times that
of the reference group (HR = 20.26 [8.76–46.69]).
For participants reporting sleep disturbance
hazards for all allele combinations were significant
as compared to the reference group. Additive effects
for predictors are displayed in Table 5.
Multiplicative interactions
In the multiplicative effects models, unexpected
trends emerged. The hazard of developing AD was
statistically significant for Ɛ2 carriers with recent
depression (HR = 2.77 [1.07–7.17]) as compared
to the reference group. Interactions with other
alleles were not significant. None of the interactions
between lifetime depression and the APOE isoforms
were significant when compared to the reference
group.
When the interaction between clinician-verified
depression and APOE genotype was analyzed, a
statistically significant hazard was demonstrated for
Ɛ2 carriers with reporting sleep disturbance. The
interaction effects are displayed in Table 6.
Discussion
This
study
described
the
presence
of
sleep
disturbance, depression, and APOE genotypes
among cognitively asymptomatic subjects and the
association
with
subsequent
diagnosis
of
AD
dementia. The findings support the hypothesis that
the presence of sleep disturbance, depression, and
APOE genotype increase the likelihood of meeting
the criteria for AD dementia diagnosis during
follow-up visits among a group of cognitively intact
participants at baseline.
The results relative to the main effects of APOE
were consistent with previous research (Schipper,
2011).
This
study
reinforced
the
association
between APOE and AD, especially for Ɛ4 carriers.
A surprising result was the interaction between
some of the psychosocial factors and genotypes
containing Ɛ2. The literature has previously shown
that participants with genotypes containing
Ɛ2
may be at a higher risk for depression symptoms
(Ballard et al., 1997), while other researchers have
speculated that Ɛ2 may be a susceptibility gene for
depression (López-León et al., 2008). Additionally,
Ɛ2 is commonly thought to provide neuroprotective
benefits with regard to AD and may even delay
its onset (Corder et al., 1994). A novel finding
in this study was the additive effect of lifetime
depression and APOE genotype. Previous research
in this area produced heterogeneous results. Based
on the literature, one would expect the genotypes
containing
Ɛ4
to
produce
significant
hazards.
However, Ɛ4 did not produce any significant effects
in unadjusted models except among those with
Ɛ3,
Ɛ4 (p < 0.05) when additive effects with
lifetime depression were tested. Significance was not
achieved in any of the interaction models targeting
life depression and APOE. The Ɛ3 genotype has
often been thought to have no consequence and
buffer patients with certain comorbid disorders
from the development of AD (Aboud et al.,
2012). By contrast, the results of this study
indicate that
Ɛ3 may present a greater hazard
among those with the psychosocial risk factors
described.
For
Ɛ4,
Ɛ4 carriers with self-reported recent
depression or clinician-verified depression, the

 Behavioral factors and APOE
1421
additive effects produced a stronger hazard than the
main effects of depression or the Ɛ4 isoform alone.
This result is contrary to previously reported results
in the literature, which suggested that Ɛ4 may serve
as a protective mechanism with regard to those with
depression (Ballard et al., 1997) or other studies that
simply reported no association between depression
and Ɛ4 in relation to AD (Cantillon et al., 1996;
Harwood et al., 2004; Hollingworth et al., 2006).
The findings in this study provide support for the
association between depression, APOE Ɛ3 and Ɛ4,
and AD.
The effect of sleep disturbance combined with
specific APOE genotypes is often overlooked in the
literature, except when sleep disturbance is defined
as obstructive sleep apnea (Nikodemova et al., 2013;
Osorio et al., 2014).
Three recent studies (Lim et al., 2013; Spira
et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2013) explored the link
between sleep disorders and AD and also included
an analysis of the role of APOE. The results of
this study provide evidence for the increased hazard
experienced by those with combinations of APOE
Ɛ3 and Ɛ4 as well those with sleep disturbance as
compared to those without sleep disturbance and
genotypes containing Ɛ2. Contrary to the results
presented by Lim et al. (2013), an increased hazard
was associated with Ɛ3, Ɛ4 and Ɛ4, Ɛ4 in both the
additive and multiplicative models. An expansion
of the types of “reversible sleep disorders” under
investigation in relation to AD may be one avenue
for addressing earlier phases of AD (Segal, 2013).
Previous research has attempted to explain the
effect of psychosocial factors such as depression
and sleep disturbance in relation to AD. Some
studies have suggested that depression and sleep
disturbance may be prodromal symptoms of AD
(Lyketsos and Olin, 2002; Caraci et al., 2010).
Other studies have speculated that depression,
especially symptoms occurring later in life, may
be
causally
related
to
AD
as
a
result
of
hippocampal insult or atrophy (Sheline et al., 2003;
Arnone et al., 2013). Associations between the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, APOE Ɛ4, and
damaging cortisol levels have also been suggested
as mechanisms responsible for increased AD risk
(Peavy et al., 2007). The exact causal pattern
remains under debate (Gil-Bea et al., 2010).
This
study
has
several
strengths.
Multiple
measures of depression allow for higher confidence
in the reliability of the concept. Deviations in the
participant’s conceptualization of a psychological
variable or its importance may affect responses
for a self-report measure (Lee and Dugan, 2015).
The addition of clinician-verified depression was
provided for additional certainty beyond self-report
alone. Given that depression may be an early
symptom of AD, a lifetime depression measure
was added to include and account for those cases
where depression may have occurred more than two
years prior. The longitudinal nature of this dataset
allowed for multiple measures for each subject over
time and allowed for each participant to act as
his or her own control. Several limitations to this
study also exist. Forward causal inferences cannot
be made in the NACC UDS. Additionally, reverse
causation is a possibility, making it difficult to
determine whether a predictor is an early symptom
of AD or a risk factor. The UDS is not a nationally
representative sample of the US population with
regard to dementia, ethnicity, and race (Morris
et al., 2006). Care should be taken not to derive
associations between the role or the impact of
race or ethnicity from this analysis. The sample
selected for analysis included participants deemed
to be cognitively asymptomatic using standard
guidelines. Nevertheless, it is accepted theory that
the pathophysiological process leading to observable
signs of AD dementia may begin up to 25 years
before observable clinical signs (Bateman et al.,
2012). Small sample sizes occurred when variables
were combined in the analysis. This was the case,
specifically for ɛ4, ɛ4 carriers with clinician-verified
depression, as well as ɛ4, ɛ4 carriers reporting sleep
disturbance. In some cases, confidence intervals for
statistically significant hazard ratios were extremely
wide, calling into question the exact precision of the
estimate, though the hazard was within a favorable
margin of error.
This
study
sought
to
identify
modifiable
psychosocial variables that, on their own or in
concert with APOE, may present an increased risk
of developing AD. Identification of variables that
may respond to treatments already available is a
potential avenue for delaying the onset or decreasing
the risk of AD. While some APOE e genotypes
continue to present a risk, research continues to
explore how such a hazard might be mitigated
based on behavioral and lifestyle changes. Barnes
and Yaffe (2011) reviewed risk factors for AD,
including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity,
smoking,
cognitive
inactivity,
and
depression,
through Cochrane Reviews and PubMed. It was
estimated that these risk factors contribute to half
of AD cases globally and in the US. Projections
estimate that a reduction of these factors at their
current levels found in the population by 10% may
result in a 1.1 million case decrease globally, while a
decline by 25% would further result in a reduction
of three million cases globally (Barnes and Yaffe,
2011).
Social workers are uniquely positioned to assist
clients in modifying behavioral patterns that are
associated with a neurodegenerative brain disease

with no current cure and few efficacious treatments.
Although modification of the APOE genotype is
not yet possible, behavioral changes such as the
alleviation of depression and sleep disturbance
may
greatly
decrease
a
person’s
risk
profile,
despite the presence of APOE
Ɛ4. Given that
the pathophysiological process may begin more
than two decades earlier than any observable
clinical signs of AD (Bateman et al., 2012), it is
crucial that behavioral risk factors are identified
early and addressed. The role of frontline social
workers in this intervention process is similar to
the work they are often charged with at present,
including accurately identifying behavioral and
psychological conditions. Population interventions
geared toward education about the increase in long-
term physiological risks derived from psychological
processes, especially in concert with one’s specific
genetic profile, are increasingly important and
needed.
Continued
research
is
necessary
to
determine the exact mechanisms facilitating AD
risk, as well as public health campaigns and
individual-level interventions which may decrease
mental health symptomology and risk of AD.
