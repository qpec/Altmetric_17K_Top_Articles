Abstract
Background: Type II diabetes is associated with breast cancer in
epidemiologic studies. Pregnancy also modifies breast cancer risk.
We hypothesized that women with a history of gestational dia-
betes mellitus (GDM), which shares pathogenesis and risk factors
with type II diabetes, would have greater invasive breast cancer
risk than parous women without a history of GDM.
Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis among parous
women in the Nurses' Health Study II, with mean age 35 years in
1989. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to
compare risks of incident invasive breast cancer in women with
and without a history of GDM.
Results: Among 86,972 women studied, 5,188 women
reported a history of GDM and 2,377 developed invasive
breast cancer (100 with history of GDM, 2,277 without GDM)
over 22 years of prospective follow-up. History of GDM was
inversely associated with incident invasive breast cancer [HR,
0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55–0.84; P ¼ 0.0004],
compared with no history of GDM, after adjustment for body
mass index, reproductive history, and other breast cancer risk
factors. Findings were similar by menopausal status, although
observed person-time was predominantly premenopausal
(premenopausal: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56–0.96; P ¼ 0.03;
postmenopausal: HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43–0.92; P ¼ 0.02).
Restricting to women undergoing mammography screening
modestly attenuated the relationship (HR, 0.74; 95% CI,
0.57–0.96; P ¼ 0.02).
Conclusions: Among a large cohort of U.S. women, history of
GDM was not associated with an elevated risk of subsequent
invasive breast cancer.
Impact: Our findings highlight the need to further investigate
GDM's role in breast cancer development. Cancer Epidemiol Biomar-

Introduction
The risk of breast cancer has long been linked to reproductive
risk factors, including age at menarche, age at first birth, and age at
menopause (1). Pregnancy has bidirectional effects on breast
cancer risk: It increases risk over the short term, but in women
with a young age at first birth, it is protective over the long
term (1, 2). Hormonal changes in pregnancy are thought to
induce proliferation and differentiation of the breast epithelial
cells, modifying the risk of future malignancy (3–5). Identifying
pregnancy-specific characteristics that modulate breast cancer
risk could inform screening and prevention practices.
Type II diabetes was associated with a 27% greater overall risk
of breast cancer in a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies,
although significant between-study heterogeneity suggested
potential differences by menopausal status, adjustment for body
mass index (BMI), or study design (prospective vs. retrospective;
ref. 6). For example, no positive relationship was observed for
diabetes and breast cancer among premenopausal women. Ges-
tational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs in approximately 6% of
pregnancies in the United States and confers a high risk of future
type II diabetes (7–9). During pregnancy, women with GDM have
higher glucose and C-reactive protein levels, lower sex hormone–
binding globulin levels, and may be hyperinsulinemic, as

 compared with pregnant women without GDM (10, 11). These
findings suggest an altered metabolic milieu, which may have
biological effects on breast tissue during a critical period of
differentiation (3–5). It is unclear whether GDM is associated
with increased breast cancer risk, with mixed results in past studies
(12–16).
We hypothesized that a history of GDM would be associated
with a greater invasive breast cancer risk among parous partici-
pants in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II), a large prospective
cohort of U.S. female nurses.
Materials and Methods
Study population
This analysis was conducted in the NHS II longitudinal pro-
spective cohort. NHS II began in 1989 with the enrollment of
116,430 female nurses, ages 25 to 42. Questionnaires are distrib-
uted every 2 years to update information on a variety of lifestyle
and health-related characteristics, with follow-up >90% of total
potential person-years. This study has been approved by the
Brigham and Women's Hospital Institutional Review Board, with
participants' consent implied by the return of the questionnaires.
This analysis included participants reporting a previous birth
on the baseline questionnaire (1989) or an incident first birth
during follow-up, through 2001. Nulliparous women were
excluded. The 2001 questionnaire cycle is the last in which
pregnancy history was prospectively ascertained, as the majority
of NHS II participants had passed reproductive age. Exclusion
criteria were any history of cancer at baseline or prior to first birth,
a prior multiple gestation pregnancy (i.e., twins or higher), and
age at first birth <18 years of age. Women were censored during
follow-up upon death, cancer diagnosis, reporting of a multiple
gestation pregnancy, or being lost to follow-up. Follow-up con-
tinued through the diagnosis of breast cancer or May 31, 2013,
whichever occurred first.
Ascertainment of GDM history
History of GDM was captured on the baseline questionnaire
and updated every 2 years through 2001 by self-report of a
physician's diagnosis. Self-reported GDM was previously validat-
ed against medical records in a subgroup of NHS II participants,
with 94% of cases confirmed (17).
Ascertainment of incident breast cancer cases
Invasive breast cancer cases were identified on biennial follow-
up questionnaires from baseline through the 2011 questionnaire.
Medical records were obtained from willing participants to con-
firm the diagnosis (with >98% accuracy) as well as to capture
estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status (18).
ER and PR status (positive/negative) was determined from med-
ical records for 92% and 91% of our confirmed cases, respectively.
Reasons for undetermined ER/PR status included missing infor-
mation (5%), test not performed (�2%), and borderline status
(�1%). Deaths were identified by the postal service, next of kin, or
National Death Index, with medical records or death certificates
used for additional documentation of breast cancer.
Covariate assessment
Detailed health, reproductive, and lifestyle histories were cap-
tured at baseline and updated every 2 years. Participants reporting
a diagnosis of type II diabetes received a previously validated
supplemental questionnaire (19), from which confirmation of
diagnosis was made in accordance with the National Diabetes
Data Group criteria through 1998 (20) and the American Diabetes
Association criteria for cases thereafter (21). A family history of
breast cancer in a mother or sister and family history of diabetes in
a parent or sibling was updated approximately every 4 years.
Participants indicated the number of years since the most recent
mammogram at baseline and on follow-up questionnaires
answered whether they had a mammogram in the past 2 years.
Current body weight was self-reported and was highly correlated
with technician-measured weight in a previous validation study
(22). A validated physical activity questionnaire was distributed
approximately every 4 years (23), asking participants the frequen-
cy in which they usually engaged in common recreational activ-
ities, from which we derived total metabolic equivalent task hours
per week (MET-hours/week). Usual diet was ascertained every 4
years via a validated semiquantitative food frequency question-
naire, from which we estimated intake of fruits and vegetables
(servings/day) and alcohol (grams/day). The birth index, which
takes into account parity and the age at each birth, is inversely
associated with breast cancer risk and was calculated on the basis
of participants' reproductive histories (1).
Statistical analysis
Participants' person-time was calculated from age at first birth
through date of breast cancer diagnosis, lost-to-follow-up, death,
or return of the 2011 questionnaire, whichever occurred first. A
history of GDM was determined at baseline and updated every 2
years.A participant was considered exposed from her first report of
GDM through the remainder of follow-up. Women reporting a
diagnosis of type II diabetes prior to a GDM pregnancy were
considered not exposed to GDM.
We used age- and multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional
hazards models, stratified by time since first birth and age, to
estimate the HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the
association between a history of GDM (ever vs. never) and risk of
incident invasive breast cancer. Time-varying covariates were
updated every questionnaire cycle. The proportional hazards
assumption was met with P > 0.05 for the interaction of fol-
low-up time (years) with exposure on breast cancer risk.
Our primary endpoint was invasive breast cancer. We also
conducted analyses by breast cancer subgroup, including meno-
pausal status at diagnosis and hormone receptor status. Cox
proportional hazards competing risk analysis, as described by
Lunn and colleagues was used to assess heterogeneity by molec-
ular subtype (any positive receptors ERþ or PRþ vs. both negative
receptors ER�/PR�; ref. 24). Briefly, data duplication methods
were used, allowing the exposure variable and covariates with
heterogeneity across subtypes to vary, keeping other covariate
estimates constant. A likelihood ratio test is used to compare
models with and without this approach to evaluate heterogeneity
across subtype. We considered potential confounders in the
multivariable model, including BMI (kg/m2) at age 18 (contin-
uous), weight gain since age 18 (continuous), height (continu-
ous), total physical activity (MET-hours/week, quintiles), age at
menarche (�10 years old, 11–12, 13–14, �15), birth index
(continuous; ref. 1), total lifetime breastfeeding (none, <6
months, �6 months), menopausal status (premenopausal, post-
menopausal, unknown), hormone therapy use (never, ever use of
estrogen plus progesterone, past: estrogen only or other, current:
estrogen only or other), family history of breast cancer in mother

and mammography for screening, �40 and mammography for

Additional
supplemental
models
adjusted for self-reported pregnancy-associated hypertension
and use of diabetes therapies (with separate terms for insulin
and oral therapies). Missing covariate data for an individual
were carried forward from a previous questionnaire, if avail-
able. A missing indicator category was created for categorical
covariates if necessary.
In addition, we evaluated a secondary exposure definition,
taking into account progression from GDM to type II diabetes,
classifying women as (i) no diabetes; (ii) GDM only, without
subsequent type II diabetes; (iii) type II diabetes only; or (iv) both
GDM and subsequent type II diabetes. We updated participants'
status prospectively over follow-up; women without either GDM
or type II diabetes served as the reference group.
We next conducted stratified analyses to evaluate whether
the relationship between GDM and breast cancer differed by
established diabetes and breast cancer risk factors, including
menopausal status (pre- vs. postmenopausal), current BMI clas-
sification (normal <25.0, overweight 25.0–29.0, and obese �30.0
kg/m2), age at first birth (<30 vs. �30 years old), family history of
breast cancer in a sister or mother (yes vs. no), family history of
diabetes in a parent or sibling (yes vs. no), physical activity
(quintile 1–3 vs. quintile 4–5), prepregnancy menstrual cycle
regularity at ages 18 to 22 (regular to mostly regular vs. usual or
always irregular), and total lifetime breastfeeding history (<6
months vs. � 6 months). We hypothesized that differences in
underlying risk factors, such as insulin resistance and sex steroid
hormones, may modify the relationship between GDM and
subsequent breast cancer risk. We calculated P values for interac-
tion from a multiplicative interaction term between the exposure
and modifier in the main effects model.
We assessed bias due to differences in screening practices
between women with and without a history of GDM by restricting
to person-time among women �40 years of age with mammog-
raphy screening in the past 2 years. We also modeled BMI at
various time points, including current BMI, BMI at age 18, or both
in the multivariable model. All analyses were run on SAS Version
9.3, with a <0.05 as the level of significance.
Results
The study population consisted of 81,784 parous women
without a history of GDM and 5,188 with a history of GDM.
The mean (SD) age at GDM diagnosis was 33.1 (5.5) years.
Overall, 63% of the 982,078 person-years was accrued prior to
menopause. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Women
with a history of GDM were less physically active, less likely to be
white, more likely to be overweight or obese, and to have a family
history of diabetes, compared with women without a history of
GDM. Women with a history of GDM also had an older age at first
birth, were more likely to have a history of pregnancy-induced
hypertension, and were lesslikely to have breastfed for �6 months
total in their lifetime. Over follow-up, women �40 years old with
a history of GDM were slightly less likely than those without a
history of GDM to report mammography screening in the past 2
years (GDM 65.5% vs. no GDM 68.1% person-years).

 Over 22 years of prospective follow-up, there were 2,377
incident cases of invasive breast cancer, with 100 occurring among
women with a history of GDM. The mean (SD) age at breast cancer
diagnosis was 49.5 (6.6) years. Women with a history of GDM
were significantly less likely to develop invasive breast cancer
(Table 2) in both the age-adjusted (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55–0.84;
P ¼ 0.0003) and multivariable-adjusted models (HR, 0.68; 95%
CI, 0.55–0.84; P ¼ 0.0004). Adjusting for oral contraceptive use,
history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, and smoking status
did not impact results. Similarly, inclusion of women who
reported multiple gestation pregnancies in the analysis did not
affect the results. Results were similar by menopausal status
(premenopausal, n ¼ 1,377 events: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56–
0.96; P ¼ 0.03; postmenopausal, n ¼ 916 events: HR, 0.63; 95%
CI, 0.43–0.92; P ¼ 0.02). There was an inverse association
between history of GDM and hormone receptor–positive breast
cancer (either ERþ or PRþ, n ¼ 71 GDM events, n ¼ 1,690 non-
GDM events; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.84; P ¼ 0.0009), but not
for hormone receptor–negative cancers (both ER� and PR�, n ¼
23 GDM events, n ¼ 393 non-GDM events; HR, 0.96; 95% CI,
0.60–1.52; P ¼ 0.9); however, test for heterogeneity was not
statistically significant (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.16).
Table 3 gives results stratified by established diabetes or breast
cancer risk factors. Significant effect modification was observed for
BMI (Pinteraction ¼ 0.04) and total physical activity (Pinteraction ¼
0.04), indicating an inverse relationship between GDM history
and breast cancer among overweight, obese, and less physically
active participants (below median MET-hours/week), with no
association among normal weight or more physically active
women (Table 3). There was a trend toward stronger inverse
relationship between history of GDM and invasive breast
cancer among women with <6 months total lifetime breastfeed-
ing, as compared with their longer breastfeeding counterparts
(Pinteraction ¼ 0.08). Findings did not differ by age at first birth,
family history of breast cancer, regularity of menstrual cycles, or
family history of diabetes (all Pinteractions > 0.05).
Table 4 shows the risk of GDM with invasive breast cancer
accounting for type II diabetes. There was a significant inverse
relationship between GDM and breast cancer versus no diabetes,
regardless of progression to type II diabetes (GDM only: HR, 0.72;
95% CI, 0.58–0.89; P ¼ 0.003; GDM and subsequent type II
diabetes: HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10–0.68; P ¼ 0.006). Type II
diabetes only without a prior history of GDM, compared with
no diabetes, was not significantly associated with breast cancer
(HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.40–1.18; P ¼ 0.2). Additional adjustment

 for use of diabetes therapies (insulin and oral therapies) did not
modify the estimate (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.0.55–0.85; P ¼ 0.0005).
When we restricted to follow-up among participants �40 years
of age reporting mammography screening in the past 2 years,
results were similar to the overall cohort (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57–
0.96; P ¼ 0.02; Supplementary Table S1). Results did not change
when we adjusted for current BMI instead of BMI at age 18.
Discussion
In this large prospective study of parous women in the United
States with >20 years of follow-up, we did not observe a greater
invasive breast cancer risk among women with a history of GDM.
In fact, women with history of GDM experienced a lower incident
breast cancer risk. This inverse relationship was independent of
intermediate progression to type II diabetes and was stronger
among women who were overweight, obese, or less physically
active. Our analyses also suggested that the inverse relationship
may be particularly strong for hormone receptor–positive breast
cancers (ERþ or PRþ).
Results of previous studies examining GDM and breast cancer
are mixed, and study populations, design, and control for poten-
tial confounders varied widely (12–16, 25). Two prior studies
observed inverse relationships between GDM and breast cancer
risk (15, 16). One retrospective population-based study with a
median follow-up of 8 years postpartum found a lower risk of
premenopausal breast cancer among women with a history of
GDM (OR ¼ 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98; ref. 16). Similarly, a
retrospective U.S.-based case–control study indicated an inverse
relationship between GDM and postmenopausal breast cancer
(OR ¼ 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37–0.79; ref. 15). In contrast, there was a
positive relationship between a history of GDM and breast cancer
risk in a retrospective cohort of live births in 1964 to 1976, limited
to women �50 years of age (OR ¼ 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5; ref. 12). A
positive association was also observed between measures of
glucose intolerance in a pregnancy cohort with long-term breast
cancer (13), Three additional studies observed null associations
for GDM with breast cancer risk (14, 25, 26). In the current study,
we did not observe a positive association between GDM and
postmenopausal breast cancer. We were able to address several
limitations of prior studies with the prospective design, large
sample size, and adjustment for many possible sources of bias,
including lifestyle and mammography screening practices.
There are several potential explanations for our unexpected
observation of lower breast cancer risk among women with prior
GDM. It is possible that the altered hormonal milieu of a GDM
complicated pregnancy confers protection on breast tissue. Preg-
nancy is known to induce proliferation and functional differen-
tiation of breast lobules and ducts, thought to mediate the
epidemiologic association between pregnancy history and breast
cancer risk (3–5). It follows that differences in circulating growth
factors or hormones in GDM-affected pregnancies may impact
these processes and the future risk for breast cancer. Preeclampsia
is a pregnancy-associated condition linked with GDM that may be
associated with lower breast cancer risk (27, 28). However,
adjusting for a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension did
not impact our findings.
Beyond pregnancy, GDM may be a manifestation of chronic
subclinical abnormal glucose metabolism. We hypothesized,
based on epidemiologic literature and rodent models, that a
history of abnormal glucose metabolism in pregnancy would be
associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. However, obesity
(itself strongly associated with type II diabetes and abnormal
glucose metabolism) is known to be inversely associated with the
risk of premenopausal breastcancer (29, 30). Consistent with this,
a trend toward an inverse association between midlife fasting
insulin levels (a marker of insulin resistance) and premenopausal
breast cancer risk was observed in the NHS II (31), in contrast to a
previously observed positive relationship between fasting insulin
levels and postmenopausal breast cancer risk (29, 30). It is
possible that GDM reflects an underlying metabolic state that
specifically impacts premenopausal breast cancer risk, which
accounted for the majority of the cases in this study. Notably,
the magnitude of the reduction in breast cancer risk associated
with a history of GDM appeared to be greatest among women
with additional diabetes risk factors: low physical activity, over-
weight/obesity, and less lifetime breastfeeding (32). Previous
studies suggest that the physiology underlying GDM differs in
obese versus lean women; thus, different subtypes of GDM may
have different associations with breast cancer (33, 34).
Alternate explanations for our observations include residual or
unmeasured confounding and screening bias. Unmeasured fac-
tors underlying the inverse relationship between obesity and
premenopausal breast cancer risk may partially explain our find-
ings. Some oral diabetes therapies have been associated with a
lower cancer risk (35), but adjusting for this factor did not account
for our findings. A recent analysis identified three type II diabetes
genetic risk variants as inversely related to breast cancer risk,
although the overall diabetes genetic risk score was null; this
suggests there may be some potential for shared pathways
between diabetes and lower breast cancer risk that were uncon-
trolled for in our analysis (36). We explored the potential for

 screening bias in sensitivity analyses. Women with GDM were
slightly less likely to have been recently screened for breast cancer,
which might lead to fewer diagnoses. However, mammography
screening was included in our multivariate model. Furthermore,
when restricting to women �40 years old reporting mammogra-
phy screening in the past 2 years, breast cancer risk remained lower
among women with a history of GDM, suggesting that differences
in screening did not account for our findings.
Strengths of the current study include its large sample size,
prospective nature, and rigorous ascertainment of exposures and
outcomes. We also captured information on numerous potential
confounders. Analyses of breast cancer subtypes and subgroup
stratification were limited in statistical power by the number of
events; thus, we must interpret these with caution. Another
limitation to note is the potential for misclassification of GDM
exposure status, given that of the women deemed "probable
GMD," 21% had medical records indicating a physician's diag-
nosis, but no oral glucose tolerance test values to verify the
diagnosis. Finally, because <5% of the participants in this study
were from ethnic/racial minority groups, generalizability to non-
white populations may be limited.
In summary, in contrast to our hypothesis, we found that a
history of GDM was not associated with greater breast cancer
risk among a large cohort of U.S. women, followed prospec-
tively for >20 years. In fact, GDM appeared inversely associated
with breast cancer risk, even after adjustment for the many
known breast cancer risk factors. It is possible that the hor-
monal milieu of a GDM pregnancy protects the breast from
future malignancy or that GDM is representative of an under-
lying metabolic state (including obesity), which is protective
against premenopausal breast cancer. Further research is need-
ed to validate our unexpected findings in other large prospec-
tive cohorts.
