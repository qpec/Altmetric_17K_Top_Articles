SUMMARY
Background
Liver cirrhosis is a large burden on global health, causing over one million
deaths per year. Observational studies have reported an inverse association
between coffee and cirrhosis.
Aims
To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterise the rela-
tionship between coffee consumption and cirrhosis.
Methods
We searched for studies published until July 2015 that reported odds ratios,
relative risks (RR) or hazard ratios for cirrhosis stratified by coffee con-
sumption. We calculated RRs of cirrhosis for an increase in daily coffee
consumption of two cups for each study and overall. We performed analy-
ses by study design, type of cirrhosis and mortality. We assessed the risk of
bias in each study and the overall quality of evidence for the effect of coffee
on cirrhosis.
Results
We identified five cohort studies and four case–control studies involving
1990 cases and 432 133 participants. We observed a dose–response in most
studies and overall. The pooled RR of cirrhosis for a daily increase in coffee
consumption of two cups was 0.56 (95% CI 0.44–0.68; I2 83.3%). The RR
pooled from cohort studies for a daily increase of two cups was 0.58 (95%
CI 0.41–0.76; I2 91.1%) and from case–control studies it was 0.52 (95% CI
0.40–0.63; I2 0.0%). The pooled RR of alcoholic cirrhosis for a daily
increase of two cups was 0.62 (95% CI 0.51–0.73; I2 0%) and of death from
cirrhosis it was 0.55 (95% CI 0.35–0.74; I2 90.3%).
Conclusion
This meta-analysis suggests that increasing coffee consumption may sub-
stantially reduce the risk of cirrhosis.

 INTRODUCTION
Liver cirrhosis is a significant burden on global health.
Between 1980 and 2010, the number of deaths world-
wide from cirrhosis increased from around 676 000
(1.54% of total) to over one million (1.95% of total).1
Cirrhosis is also an important cause of disability and
morbidity, and in 2010 was responsible for 31 million
disability-adjusted
life
years
(1.2%
of
the
total).
Although the absolute number of deaths from cirrhosis
has increased, the global age-adjusted mortality rate
decreased by 22% between 1980 and 2010. Trends in
mortality rates vary markedly between countries, how-
ever, due to varying exposure to risk factors and the
availability of vaccinations and treatments. In some
countries, such as India and the UK, mortality rates
are increasing.1 The risk factors and aetiologies of cir-
rhosis are diverse, but those traditionally considered as
important
include
alcohol-related
liver
disease
and
chronic viral hepatitis. More recently, and as a result
of increases in obesity and diabetes mellitus, non-alco-
holic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has also emerged as
a significant aetiological factor.2, 3 Irrespective of aetiol-
ogy,
cirrhosis
develops
by
a
common
mechanistic
pathway involving chronic inflammation of the liver,
followed by fibrosis, leading to end-stage liver disease
(cirrhosis), which can be fatal either due to complica-
tions related to portal hypertension (decompensation)
or to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Coffee is ubiquitous in most societies. Coffee com-
prises over a thousand compounds, many of which are
biologically active and may affect human health. These
include caffeine, chlorogenic acid, melanoids and the
pentacyclic diterpenes, kahweol and cafestol.4 The bio-
logical effects of coffee include stimulation of the cen-
tral
nervous
system,
primarily
by
caffeine,
the
attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, and
anti-carcinogenesis.5 Due to its widespread consump-
tion, coffee and its effects on health have been studied
extensively.
In
the
context
of
liver
disease,
coffee
appears to confer a number of protective effects. Ani-
mal studies and human observational studies suggest
that
coffee
consumption
reduces
the
frequency
of
abnormal liver function tests, fibrosis, cirrhosis and
HCC.6–10
In
addition,
a
randomised-controlled
trial
(RCT)
showed
that
patients
with
hepatitis
C
who
drank more coffee had lower serum levels of liver
enzymes.11 The aim of this meta-analysis was to sum-
marise the evidence from studies on the effect of coffee
on cirrhosis.
METHODS
We followed the Prisma guidelines; a protocol is shown
in Table S1.
Study searches and selection
We searched for titles of articles in PubMed, Embase
(using Ovid) and Web of Science using the term: (coffee
OR caffeine) AND (*liver* OR *hepat* OR *cirrh* OR
*fibro*). We performed the search in July 2015 and did
not restrict publication date. We also performed manual
searches of reference lists of relevant studies returned by
the initial search.
We included studies in this meta-analysis if they: (i)
involved a case–control study, cohort study or RCT; and
(ii) provided relative risks (RRs), odds ratios (ORs) or
hazard ratios (HRs), including 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs), for cirrhosis stratified by coffee consumption
in adults aged 18 or older. We excluded studies if they
did not provide a summary dose–effect size or allow one
to be calculated, which required individual effect sizes
for three or more consumption categories. We also
excluded studies if they were not in English. We
assumed a diagnosis of cirrhosis where studies reported
hospitalisation for chronic liver disease (CLD) or death
from CLD but without a diagnosis of HCC. If two or
more studies reported the same data, we used the most
recent study. OJK screened titles and abstracts to remove
duplicates. OJK and RB independently reviewed the
remaining studies.
Data extraction and quality assessment
The data extraction was performed by OJK and checked
by RB. The following data were extracted from each
study in a standardised manner: (i) the publication date,
the first author’s surname and the country of origin; (ii)
the study characteristics, including the design, the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria, the sample size, the measure-
ment of coffee consumption, the outcome measures, and
the adjustments for confounding variables and (iii) the
number of events (or cases) and non-events (or controls)
and the corresponding effect size and 95% CIs for differ-
ent categories of coffee consumption. For cohorts, we
also extracted information concerning whether CLD was
excluded at baseline, the follow-up time and the loss to
follow-up. Where studies provided multiple effect sizes
for a single category of coffee consumption, we extracted
the effect size most comprehensively adjusted for con-
founders. Where studies reported effect sizes for caf-
feinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption separately,

Systematic review with meta-analysis: coffee and risk of cirrhosis
 but not total coffee consumption, we extracted the effect
sizes for caffeinated coffee. The case–control studies
reported ORs, while the cohort studies reported either
RRs 9, 12, 13 or HRs.8, 14 As the incidence rate of cirrho-
sis was low, we assumed the ORs, RRs, HRs were equiv-
alent, and from herein we refer to all three as RR for
simplicity. We worked form published data only and
without contacting study authors.
We assessed the risk of bias in individual studies using
the Cochrane Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-
Randomized
Studies
of
Interventions
(ACROBAT-
NRSI),15 as has been used previously.16 We included the
following domains of bias: confounding, selection, mea-
surement of exposure at baseline, changing exposure
during follow-up, missing data (including loss to follow-
up), outcome measurement and selective reporting. In
accordance with the Cochrane tool, we judged each
domain of bias as ‘low’, ‘high’ or ‘unknown’ risk. We
made a single judgement for the risk of bias from ‘mea-
surement of exposure’, which combined the domains
‘measurement of exposure at baseline’ and ‘changing
exposure during follow-up’. We made an overall judge-
ment of the risk of bias for each study. We judged there
to be a ‘high’ overall risk of bias where there was plausi-
bility that individual domain bias would lead to bias in
the reported effect estimates. We determined the overall
quality of evidence supporting the effect of coffee on cir-
rhosis using the Grading of Recommendations Assess-
ment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).17 OJK
and PJR performed the risk of bias analysis and overall
quality of evidence assessment separately and then dis-
cussed the results for consensus.
Statistical analysis
Eight studies reported RRs and 95% CIs for cirrhosis.
The other, Klatsky et al., reported RRs and 95% CIs for
alcoholic and non-alcoholic cirrhosis separately, but not
total cirrhosis. For this study, we calculated a RR and
95% CI for total cirrhosis using the method described by
Hamling et al.18
We consider the RRs as reported in the different stud-
ies below. However, because the reported categories of
coffee consumption varied between the studies, a direct
comparison was not initially possible. Thus, we calcu-
lated for each study a summary RR and 95% CI for an
increase in coffee consumption of two cups per day. For
each study, this involved estimating the median coffee
consumption in each of the reported categories. Where
the consumption category was an integer (e.g. one cup
per day), we used the integer as the median. Where the
category was a closed range, (e.g. one to three cups per
day), we used the mid-point as the median. For the
highest ranges, which were open-ended (e.g. >two cups
per day), we used the lower end of the range plus the
width of the preceding closed range for the median. If
there was no preceding closed range, we used the lower
end of the open-ended range plus the difference between
the two preceding integers. This method was similar to
those used for estimating median exposure in ranges in
other meta-analyses.19, 20 After calculating median con-
sumptions, we performed a summary dose–response
analysis following the method of Greenland and Long-
necker.21 We tested for nonlinearity of the dose–response
across the range of consumption reported in the studies
(from 0 to four and above cups per day) using a
restricted cubic spline model.22 This used data from
eight studies that provided RRs for different categories of
coffee consumption (Tverdal and Skurtveit did not
report category-specific RRs). The P-value for nonlinear-
ity was 0.34. We also used the cubic spline model to cal-
culate RRs of cirrhosis for one to four cups per day
compared to none.
Using the RRs and 95% CIs for an increase of two
cups of coffee per day, we calculated a pooled RR and
95% CI of cirrhosis. We used a random effects model to
incorporate between study heterogeneity, assuming the
biological effects of coffee in different populations would
vary randomly, at least by type, processing and measure-
ment of coffee.23 We examined statistical heterogeneity
by performing Cochran’s Q and I2 tests. In accordance
with the Cochrane Handbook,24 Chapter 9.5.2, we used a
P-value of <0.1 to signify statistically significant hetero-
geneity and we interpreted the I2 values as follows: ‘0–
40% heterogeneity might not be important; 30–60% may
represent moderate heterogeneity; 50–90% may represent
substantial heterogeneity; 75–100%: considerable hetero-
geneity’. We also examined heterogeneity by performing
a sensitivity analysis, in which we calculated pooled RRs
and 95% CIs while excluding studies one at a time from
the analysis.25 To examine potential publication bias, we
used Egger’s regression test. We did not test funnel plot
symmetry to assess for publication bias due to the low
power of that test when less than ten studies are avail-
able.26 We
performed sub-analyses
to calculate
the
pooled RRs for cohort studies and case–control studies
separately, the RR of alcoholic cirrhosis and the RR of
death (i.e. with a diagnosis of cirrhosis or CLD). In order
to assess confounding and the direction and magnitude
of overall adjustment, we meta-analysed the crude effect
sizes and compared them with the adjusted values.

 For this purpose, we used the reported crude effect sizes
or, where not reported, we calculated crude effect sizes
from the published data. We used STATA (Release 13, Sta-
taCorp LP, College Station, TX) and Mathematica (Ver-
sion 10, Wolfram Research, Inc., Champaign, IL) to
perform the analyses, and we used a two-sided P > 0.05
for statistical significance.
RESULTS
Details of the study selection process and the
included studies
Figure 1 illustrates the process for selecting the studies
for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The searches returned
2023 studies. After OJK first excluded 1290 duplicates,
OJK and RB separately reviewed titles and abstracts and
excluded 646 irrelevant studies. OJK and RB then exam-
ined the full text of the remaining studies and excluded
a further 78 studies for not meeting the eligibility criteria
described above. Nine studies remained and we included
all in this meta-analysis.7–9, 12–14, 27–29
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the nine
included studies, which included eight journal articles and
one conference abstract.27 The studies were published
between 1994 and 2015 and involved 1990 cases and
432 133 participants. Five were cohort studies, involving
1364 cases and 429 202 participants, and four were case–
control studies, involving 626 cases and 2305 controls
(2931 participants in total). Two of the studies were in the
USA, six in Europe and one in Singapore. Seven studies
included men and women. One case–control study
included males only.27 One cohort study included only
male smokers without a history of malignancy, alcoholism
or major health problems.13 The other cohort studies all
involved men and women recruited as summarised in
Table 1. The cohort studies measured outcomes using
death and/or hospitalisation records and, thus, lost few
participants to follow-up. Participants in the case–control
studies were recruited from hospital records (i.e. both
cases and controls). The studies adjusted for a variable
mix of relevant confounders, but all adjusted for alcohol
(the exact adjustments used in the conference abstract
were unclear27). All the studies measured coffee consump-
tion by means of a self-completion questionnaire or inter-
view, in which participants selected a pre-defined category
of consumption. All measurements were in cups. One
study asked about the type of coffee preparation (e.g.
boiled, filtered, etc.) and cup size.13 Another study asked
whether the coffee was caffeinated or decaffeinated.8 For
that study, we used the RRs for caffeinated coffee con-
sumption in our analysis, whereas for the other studies we
used the RRs for total coffee consumption.
Figure S1 illustrates the results of the risk of bias
assessment for the individual studies. In summary, we
found a high risk of bias for the following domains: con-
founding, selection and outcome measurement. We per-
formed an assessment of the overall quality of evidence
for the effect of coffee on cirrhosis using the GRADE
system. We rated the quality of evidence based on risk
of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publica-

dence. We rated the quality of evidence as low, as indi-
cated in the Table S2.
To understand better the magnitude and direction of
overall confounding across all studies, we compared the
pooled adjusted and unadjusted RRs of cirrhosis for an
increase in coffee consumption of two cups per day.
After adjustment, the pooled RR decreased from 0.66
(95% CI 0.47–0.85) to 0.56 (95% CI 0.44–0.68), indicat-

In determining the overall risk of bias in the individ-
ual studies, we found a high risk in all the case–control

 choosing cases and controls and for recall bias in deter-
mining exposure to confounders. We found an unclear
overall risk of bias in the cohort studies. We did not
assign a ‘low’ risk of overall bias to any study even if
there was no obvious source of bias that would have
affected the results. This was in accordance with the
ACROBAT-NRSI, which indicates that only randomised
trials should be considered ‘low’ overall risk of bias.

Systematic review with meta-analysis: coffee and risk of cirrhosis
 rhosis for an increase in coffee consumption of two cups
per day for each study and overall. In eight studies,
increasing coffee consumption by two cups per day was
associated with a statistically significant reduction in the
risk of cirrhosis. In the other study, Goh et al., the corre-
sponding RR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.55–1.02). The pooled
RR across all studies was 0.56 (95% CI 0.44–0.68). In all
but one study, Goh et al., there was evidence of a dose-
dependent relationship, with generally lower RRs for
higher consumption categories. The data as reported by
the studies are illustrated as a semi-log plot in Figure 3.
We calculated that compared to no consumption the
pooled RRs of cirrhosis were 0.78 (95% CI 0.68–0.90),
0.57 (95% CI 0.50–0.65), 0.43 (95% CI 0.37–0.50) and
0.35 (95% CI 0.30–0.41) for one to four cups of coffee
per day respectively.
Egger’s regression test gave no indication of statisti-
cally significant publication bias (P > 0.05). Cochran’s Q
and I2 were 48 (P = 0.0) and 83.3%, respectively, and
showed statistically significant heterogeneity between the

 studies. We further investigated this heterogeneity by
means of a sensitivity analysis, in which we calculated
pooled RRs while excluding the studies one at a time.
The pooled RRs in the sensitivity analysis and the Q and
I2 varied most substantially when Lai et al. was excluded.
Without Lai et al., the pooled RR for an increase in cof-
fee consumption of two cups per day was 0.61 (95% CI
0.53–0.68). The corresponding Q and I2 values were 11
(P = 0.14) and 36.1%, showing markedly reduced hetero-
geneity compared to when Lai et al. was included. The
pooled RR of cirrhosis for an increase of two cups per
day in cohort studies was 0.58 (95% CI 0.41–0.76; I2
91.1%) and in case–control studies it was 0.52 (95% CI
0.40–0.63; I2 0.0%). The RRs of alcoholic cirrhosis, calcu-
lated from two studies,9, 12 and death from liver disease,
calculated from four studies,8, 12–14 for an increase in
coffee consumption of two cups per day were 0.62 (95%
CI 0.51–0.73; I2 0.0%) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.35–0.74; I2
90.3%) respectively.
DISCUSSION
Earlier meta-analyses have reported an inverse association
between coffee consumption and liver cancer.10, 30, 31
Studies have also reported protective effects of coffee in ani-
mals with liver disease and in humans where the outcomes
were less severe CLD including abnormal LFTs.9, 32, 33
However, this is the first meta-analysis to show a protective
effect of coffee against cirrhosis. The analysis of five cohort
and four case–control studies has shown that increasing
daily coffee consumption by two cups is associated with a
near halving of the risk of cirrhosis. While statistically sig-
nificant heterogeneity existed across the studies, this was
explained by the effect of one study, and the association was
consistent through the sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity anal-
yses showed that increasing daily coffee consumption by
two cups is also associated with reduced RRs of alcoholic
cirrhosis and death from cirrhosis.
One of the strengths of this meta-analysis was the
inclusion of studies that reported a summary dose RR or
RRs for three or more categories of coffee consumption
only. This allowed the estimation of a clinically relevant
dose–response between coffee and cirrhosis. We excluded
four studies, including one conference abstract, which
reported RRs for less than three categories of coffee con-
sumption.34–37 Those studies reported inverse associa-
tions
between
coffee
and
cirrhosis,
which
were
statistically significant in three studies, and thus support
the findings of this meta-analysis. There are also limita-
tions. First, the studies included were observational
which, by design, do not infer causation and are gener-
ally more susceptible to bias and confounding than ran-
domised studies. In the risk of bias assessment, the case–
control studies were at high risk of selection bias in
choosing cases and controls and to recall bias in the esti-
mation of coffee and alcohol consumption years previ-
ously. Despite the risk of bias, the case–control studies
agreed broadly with the cohort studies. We found that
overall adjustment (including for body mass index, dia-
betes, alcohol and viral hepatitis) increased the effect size
away from null, which suggests that coffee drinkers had
greater overall exposure to the known risk factors of cir-
rhosis compared to noncoffee drinkers. However, resid-

Systematic review with meta-analysis: coffee and risk of cirrhosis
 ual confounding may have existed in all studies due to
confounding variables that were not measured accurately
or not adjusted for. While all the studies adjusted for
alcohol consumption (we were unclear as to what adjust-
ments were made in the conference abstract27), which is
the most critical confounder, only six studies adjusted
for age, six for body mass index and gender, and four
for diabetes. The cohort studies did not adjust for viral
hepatitis status but prevalence was likely to be low in the
populations studied. One particular concern is the poten-
tial for confounding from hidden nutritional and lifestyle
factors not measured and adjusted for in the studies. If
such factors were associated with coffee consumption
and influenced the risk of cirrhosis, this would introduce
bias into our findings. Another potential confounder is
that people with pre-existing liver disease metabolise caf-
feine more slowly38, 39 and, as a result, may drink less
coffee. This may have been important in the case–con-
trol studies, in which participants estimated previous cof-
fee consumption over a time when they probably already
had reduced liver function. The corresponding effect
would be diluted in the cohort studies due to the long
follow-up (all were longer than 14 years) and the exclu-
sion of pre-existing liver disease at baseline in two of the
studies.9, 13 Some of the cohort studies investigated con-
founding by pre-existing liver disease in sensitivity analy-
ses. In one such analysis, Setiawan et al. found that the
RR of CLD death for ≥ two cups of coffee daily com-
pared to none remained comparable in magnitude and
statistically significant (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42–0.69) when
deaths in the first 2 years were excluded. Lai et al. found
that the RR of CLD death for an extra cup of coffee
per day was 0.53 (95% CI 0.44–0.64) in the first 10 years
of the trial and 0.57 (95% CI 0.48–0.69) in the last
10 years. As such, drinking coffee appeared to protect
against cirrhosis in participants who would have had
varying levels of undiagnosed liver disease at baseline.
We investigated the overall effect of confounding by
comparing the adjusted and unadjusted RRs across all tri-
als. We found that adjustment for confounding increased
the pooled RR away from null. In accordance with the
GRADE system, this added to the overall quality of evi-
dence for the protective effect of coffee against cirrhosis.
We
found
statistically
significant
heterogeneity
between the studies, which may indicate important dif-
ferences in the populations studied and in the study
methods. The ages, countries and regions of origin, and
proportions of men and women varied. In addition, and
as noted above, participants with evidence of CLD at
baseline were excluded from two cohort studies, while in
the other cohort studies CLD was not looked for system-
atically at baseline and, thus, was not excluded. Between
the cohort studies, the most significant difference in the
populations was that in Lai et al. the participants were
all Finnish male smokers recruited from an earlier study
into lung cancer, while in the others participants were
men and women recruited from databases more repre-
sentative of the general population (see Table 1). When
the study of Lai et al. was excluded during the sensitivity
analysis, heterogeneity became statistically insignificant,
whereas the pooled RR varied by 5% only.
Heterogeneity may also exist in the measurement of
coffee consumption. In all studies, participants estimated
the usual daily intake of coffee or the daily average over
a specified preceding period (e.g. 1 year). Participants’
responses may have been influenced if they knew they
were in a study investigating nutrition, leading to overes-
timation or underestimation of consumption. This may
be more significant for the case–control studies because
participants recalled coffee consumption over longer
periods and because cases may recall their diet differ-
ently to controls leading to differential misclassification
of exposure. CLD in cases may have reduced consump-
tion and hence overestimated the apparent protective
effect. Differences in cup sizes, the methods of prepara-
tion (e.g. filtered vs. boiled) and the types of coffee (e.g.
decaffeinated vs. caffeinated) might also be important.
For example, one study13 found that the RR of cirrhosis
for an additional cup per day was 0.50 (95% CI 0.40–
0.63) for filtered coffee and 0.62 (95% 0.43–0.88) for
boiled coffee. Another study8 found that the RR of CLD
death for ≥ two daily cups of decaffeinated coffee was
0.54 (95% CI 0.35–0.85), although this was broadly simi-
lar to that for caffeinated coffee.
Heterogeneity might have arisen due to the different
outcome measures. First, four studies identified outcomes
using death records only, four studies used hospital
records only, and one study used both. The importance of
these differences is unclear as the pooled RR of death, cal-
culated from studies using death records only, was similar
to the RR pooled from the case–control studies, which
used hospital records only. Secondly, studies identified
cases differently, for example, by histology, a compelling
clinical picture or by searching death and hospital records
for Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, for example,
9th edition code 571: ‘Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis’.
Histology is the reference standard, and ideally would have
been used to confirm all cases, but the clinical picture of
cirrhosis is specific (e.g. oesophageal varices or sponta-
neous bacterial peritonitis) and patients who die from
570

O. J. Kennedy et al.
 CLD (i.e. ICD 571) but do not have HCC are highly likely
to have cirrhosis. However, there was one study8 which
appeared to include ICD codes relating to acute liver dis-
ease in the total count of CLD deaths. We were uncertain
how differences in outcome measurements affected our
pooled RR, which did not vary substantially during the
sensitivity analysis and remained statistically significant.
The use of biopsy in some studies 9, 27, 29 may have
introduced ascertainment bias if there were differential
biopsy use according to baseline coffee consumption or
to other correlated risk factors. Bias may also have been
introduced if there were undetected cases of compen-
sated cirrhosis on account of the included studies using
hospital and/or death records only to identify cases.
Some compensated cases might have been detected if
biopsies were performed on asymptomatic participants
in hospital (e.g. for a reason other than cirrhosis), but
undiagnosed
compensated
cases
in
the
community
would have been missed. The risk of bias from these
undetected cases is uncertain because the pathological
pro-fibrotic mechanism which causes the initial estab-
lishment of cirrhosis is the same irrespective of aetiol-
ogy or subsequent clinical sequelae (i.e. whether the
individual
remains
asymptomatic,
is
hospitalised
or
dies). Thus, it is logical to expect that the alleged pro-
tective effect of coffee, which likely begins long before
cirrhosis is established, would apply equally to cases
detected by the included studies and those that were
not. However, the uncertainty highlights the need for
randomised trials.
We could only partially examine the influence of aeti-
ology on the inverse association between coffee con-
sumption and cirrhosis. We found that the pooled RR
for alcoholic cirrhosis was similar to the overall estimate.
However, there was insufficient data to calculate esti-
mates for other important aetiologies of cirrhosis, such
as viral hepatitis and NAFLD. While the potential influ-
ence of aetiology is unclear since the underlying patho-
logical process leading to cirrhosis is the same, this issue
should be considered further in new studies.
There also exists the possibility of language bias since
we included English language studies only. However, most
studies are published in English, and studies investigating
the effect of language bias in meta-analyses generally
report limited evidence of an effect.40 There is also some
evidence that non-English language trials tend to be of
lower quality and report larger effect sizes,41 and so the
inclusion of English language studies only is unlikely to
lead to significant bias in our findings. Finally, there also
exists the potential of publication bias. While Egger’s
regression test detected no statistically significant publica-
tion bias, we were unable to rule out publication bias
completely. First, the relatively small number of studies
provided limited statistical power and, secondly, studies
with statistically significant results are more likely to be
published compared to those with null results.42 As such,
the pooled RR reported in this study may be exaggerated
compared to the true value.
It is biologically plausible that coffee protects the liver
against the inflammatory and fibrotic process leading to
cirrhosis. Caffeine is thought to be important, and ani-
mal studies show that caffeine not from coffee protects
against toxin-induced liver fibrosis.33, 43 Caffeine’s pro-
tective mechanism of action may be through antagonism
of the adenosine receptor A2aAR.44 Hepatic stellate cells
(HSCs) are the primary effector cells mediating fibrogen-
esis in the liver and express A2aAR. Activation of
A2aAR
markedly
up-regulates
collagen
synthesis
in
HSCs,45, 46 whereas mice lacking expression of A2aAR
are protected from toxin-induced fibrosis.47 Caffeine
might also attenuate fibrosis by suppression of inflamma-
tion and oxidative stress. Caffeine inhibits tumour necro-
sis factor-a, a pro-inflammatory cytokine and reactive
oxygen species production by Kupffer cells.48 While caf-
feine might be important, there is evidence that other
noncaffeine-mediated mechanisms also contribute to the
protective effect seen. First, adjusting for coffee con-
sumption pushes the association between caffeine and
cirrhosis towards null, and some studies report no asso-
ciation between cirrhosis and noncoffee sources of caf-
feine.7, 8 Secondly, and as is mentioned above, there is
some epidemiological evidence that decaffeinated coffee
protects against cirrhosis and abnormal liver function
tests.8, 49 Decaffeinated coffee also protects against toxin-
induced fibrosis in animal studies.43 The evidence for
decaffeinated coffee protecting against cirrhosis is weaker
overall than for regular coffee, but there is still biological
plausibility. Coffee contains a range of biologically active
ingredients beyond caffeine, including anti-oxidative and
anti-inflammatory agents, such as chlorogenic acid, kah-
weol and cafestol, and there is evidence that these may
confer protection against liver fibrosis.43
The protective effect of coffee against cirrhosis may also
involve indirect mechanisms that modify risk factors. Lab-
oratory studies have shown that various constituents of
coffee inhibit the activities of hepatitis B and C viruses.50–
52 In addition, and of even greater significance to public
health, is the inverse association between coffee (both caf-
feinated and decaffeinated) and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM). A recent meta-analysis calculated that the RR of
Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2016; 43: 562–574

 T2DM for an increase in consumption of one cup per day
was 0.91 (95% CI 0.89–0.94) for regular coffee and 0.94
(95% CI 0.91–0.98) for decaffeinated coffee.53 The mecha-
nism of action of coffee on T2DM is unclear, but caffeine
is unlikely to be the sole mediator. Caffeine causes a short-
term reduction in insulin sensitivity54 and generally stud-
ies do not show a protective effect of caffeine against
T2DM after adjustment for coffee and tea intake.55, 56
Chlorogenic acid in coffee is likely important; it has been
shown to inhibit glucose absorption in the gut. It also inhi-
bits hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate, which is the final
step
of glucose
production
by gluconeogenesis and
glycogenolysis.57 Other constituents in coffee that may
improve glucose metabolism and partly explain the rela-
tionship between coffee and T2DM include magnesium,
trigonelle, lignans and quindes.58–61 The favourable meta-
bolic effects of coffee would be expected to protect against
NAFLD and the related inflammation (NASH) which can
lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis is by far the most important risk factor for
HCC. Accordingly, the findings of this meta-analysis
may in part explain observational studies showing an
inverse association between coffee and HCC. However,
while it is logical to suggest that preventing cirrhosis
would reduce HCC, other mechanisms involving a direct
anti-carcinogenic effect of coffee may exist. Caffeine is
thought to directly inhibit the proliferation of HCC
cells.62 In addition, cafestol and kahweol upregulate
phase II enzymes in the liver, which may increase clear-
ance of potentially carcinogenic toxic insults,63, 64 and
the anti-oxidative effects of coffee may reduce DNA
damage from reactive oxygen species. Observational
studies do not show a consistent association between
HCC and decaffeinated coffee,8, 65 which indicates that
caffeine may be the primary agent. This is supported by
a recent meta-analysis which showed an inverse associa-
tion between HCC and green tea, a noncoffee source of
caffeine.66
Before recommending an increase in coffee consump-
tion to those at risk of cirrhosis, consideration is
required of the wider effects of coffee. There is evidence
of an association of coffee with lung and bladder cancer
and with bone fractures.19, 67, 68 However, there are also
benefits of coffee beyond those on the liver. Coffee has
been inversely associated with all-cause mortality,69 neu-
rological diseases 70 and a number of different cancers.71
Coffee may also protect against stroke,72 although there
is a need for further work to understand fully the effects
of coffee on the cardiovascular system. This is especially
important at higher levels of consumption, where there
is less evidence concerning the beneficial effects of coffee
as well as the potential harms.
In
conclusion,
this
meta-analysis
shows
that
an
increase in daily coffee consumption of two cups is asso-
ciated with a near halving of the risk of cirrhosis. This is
a large effect compared to many medications used for
the prevention of disease. For example, statin therapy
reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by 25%.73 Fur-
thermore, unlike many medications, coffee is generally
well tolerated and has an excellent safety profile. The
findings of this meta-analysis are important given the
high incidence of severe liver disease, the positive inter-
action between alcohol and obesity for liver disease risk
and the lack of specific treatments to prevent liver dis-
ease due to these factors. The next steps should be to
develop interventions that support patients at risk of or
with mild–moderate CLD, to increase their coffee con-
sumption, even in existing coffee drinkers given the
dose–response relationship, and then to evaluate the
effect of increasing consumption on robust markers of
CLD in well-designed randomised studies. However,
such studies would be challenging (e.g. blinding would
not be possible) and would require careful consideration
of patient selection/stratification, trial methodology and
the availability of suitable surrogate endpoints, given that
hard clinical endpoints would take years to occur.
