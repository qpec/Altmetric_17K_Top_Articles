BACKGROUND: The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour 
algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial 
infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective 
of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present 
with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance 
of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.
METHODS: In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected 
patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to 
the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European 
Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with 
RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 
compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally 
adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including 
cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as 
the specificity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort 
assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.
RESULTS: Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The 
prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially 
higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% 
versus 13%, P<0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of 
rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 
97.6–99.8]; P=0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 
96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; P<0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, 
P<0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out 
(18% versus 68%, P<0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. 
Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% 
CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; P=1.0), lower specificity of rule-in 
(84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; P<0.001), and 
lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, P<0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 
58%, P<0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of 
Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but specificity of rule-in and overall efficacy are 
decreased. Modifications of the rule-in and rule-out thresholds did not improve the 
safety or overall efficacy of the 0/1-hour algorithm.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
A
cute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major 
cause of death and disability worldwide. Its 
rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for the 
initiation of effective evidence-based medical manage-
ment and treatment.1–3 In addition, its rapid and reliable 
rule-out has the potential to reduce the time spent in 
the emergency department (ED), accelerate the identifi-
cation and treatment of the actual cause of chest pain, 
reduce patients’ anxiety, and avoid substantial costs for 
the healthcare system.4,5
For several reasons, patients with renal dysfunc-
tion merit particular attention.6,7 First, the incidence 
of AMI is increased in this vulnerable subgroup.8–10 
Second, atypical clinical presentation of AMI may be 
more frequent.11,12 Third, left ventricular hypertrophy 
is common and often results in ECG changes that may 
mimic or obscure AMI. Fourth, patients with renal dys-
function are more prone to adverse events related to 
cardiovascular medication (eg, anticoagulation) as well 
as cardiovascular procedures, including coronary an-
giography and coronary intervention.1,2 Fifth, levels of 
cardiac troponin (cTn) are frequently chronically elevat-
ed even in the absence of AMI.6,10,13 Recently, sensitive 
and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays (hs-cTn) 
were demonstrated to be accurate tools in diagnos-
ing AMI in patients with renal dysfunction, particularly 
when adjusted slightly higher cutoff levels are used for 
clinical decision making.10
The latest guidelines of the European Society of Car-
diology (ESC) for the management of acute coronary 
syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-
segment elevation recommend the use of a 0/1-hour al-
gorithm to rapidly rule out and rule in non–ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) based on hs-
cTn concentrations at presentation and their absolute 
1-hour changes.1 Assay-specific cutoff values are rec-
ommended for uniform application irrespective of re-
nal function. High safety and efficacy of the 0/1-hour 
algorithm were demonstrated in unselected patients, of 
which the vast majority had normal renal function. It is 
unknown whether these results also apply to patients 
with renal dysfunction (RD).1,14–19 Because patients with 
RD frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentra-
tions even in the absence of NSTEMI, concern has been 
raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algo-
rithm in RD.10 
 We therefore aimed to assess the diagnostic perfor-
mance of the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm in patients with 
RD in a large prospective multicenter diagnostic study.
METHODS
Study Design and Population
APACE (Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary 
Syndrome Evaluation) is an ongoing prospective international 
multicenter diagnostic study with 12 centers in 5 European 
countries aiming to advance the early diagnosis of AMI 
(ClinicalTrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00470587).10,15–
17,20,21 Adult patients presenting to the ED with symptoms 
suggestive of AMI (eg, acute chest discomfort and angina 
pectoris) with an onset or peak within the last 12 hours 
were recruited. Enrollment was independent of renal func-
tion, whereas patients with terminal kidney failure on 
chronic dialysis were excluded. For this analysis, patients 
with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, patients 
with missing creatinine measurement, patients in whom the 
final diagnosis remained unclear even after central adjudica-
tion and ≥1 elevated hs-cTnT concentration possibly indicat-
ing AMI, as well as patients with no available hs-cTnT (for 
dataset A) or hs-cTnI (for dataset B) concentrations deter-
mined on presentation to the ED and after 1 hour were also 
excluded. Dataset B represents a subset of dataset A. The 
most common reasons for misvsing samples after 1 hour 
were early transfer to the catheter laboratory or coronary 
care unit and diagnostic procedures around the 1-hour win-
dow that precluded blood draw at 1 hour.
The study was carried out according to the principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local eth-
ics committees. Written informed consent was obtained 
from all patients. The authors designed the study, gathered 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The 0/1-hour algorithms using high-sensitivity car-
diac troponin for rapid triage of patients with sus-
pected myocardial infarction are increasingly used 
in clinical practice worldwide.
• Although their high safety and efficacy could be 
shown in the general, mixed setting of emergency 
departments, their utility in patients with renal dys-
function, presenting with elevated high-sensitivity 
cardiac troponin levels often in the absence of 
acute myocardial ischemia, has been questioned.
• For the first time, we demonstrated the excellent 
safety of the 0/1-hour algorithms using high-sensi-
tivity cardiac troponin T and high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin I also in patients with renal dysfunction, 
whereas overall efficacy and rule-in specificity were 
reduced compared with patients with normal renal 
function.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The investigated 0/1-hour algorithms for rapid tri-
age of patients with suspected myocardial infarc-
tion provide high safety irrespective of renal 
function and do not seem to require adjustment 
for renal function.
• However, the proportion of patients eligible for 
rule-out is reduced in patients with renal dysfunc-
tion compared with patients with normal renal 
function (≈ factor 3) because of the substantially 
higher prevalence of myocardial infarction in 
patients with renal dysfunction (≈ factor 3).

and analyzed the data, vouched for the data and analysis, 
wrote the paper, and decided to publish. The STARD Checklist 
(Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) can 
be found in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement.22 The 
data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made 
available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the 
results or replicating the procedure.
Routine Clinical Assessment
Patients underwent clinical assessment that included medi-
cal history, physical examination, and standard blood tests 
including serial measurements of local hs-cTn, 12-lead ECG, 
chest radiography, continuous ECG rhythm monitoring, and 
pulse oximetry. Management of patients was left to the dis-
cretion of the attending physician.
Adjudicated Final Diagnosis
Adjudication of the final diagnosis was performed by 2 inde-
pendent cardiologists at the core laboratory (University Hospital 
Basel) applying the universal definition of AMI using 2 data-
sets: (1) all available medical records obtained during clinical 
care, including history, physical examination, results of labora-
tory testing including serial clinical hs-cTn levels (according to 
onsite used hs-cTn assay obtained from clinical blood samples), 
radiological testing, ECG, echocardiography, cardiac exercise 
test, lesion severity, and morphology in coronary angiography 
pertaining to the patient from the time of ED presentation to 
90-day follow-up; and (2) study-specific assessments, including 
detailed chest pain characteristics using 34 predefined criteria, 
serial hs-cTnT blood concentrations obtained from study sam-
ples, and clinical follow-up by telephone or mail. In situations 
of disagreement about the diagnosis, cases were reviewed and 
adjudicated in conjunction with a third cardiologist.
AMI was defined and hs-cTn interpreted as recom-
mended in the current guidelines.1–3,14 In brief, myocardial 
infarction was diagnosed when there was evidence of myo-
cardial necrosis in association with a clinical setting con-
sistent with myocardial ischemia. Myocardial necrosis was 
diagnosed by ≥1 cTn value >99th percentile together with 
a significant rising or falling. The criteria used to define a 
rise or fall in conventional cTn and hs-cTnT are described 
in detail in the Methods section in the online-only Data 
Supplement. All other patients were classified in the cat-
egories of unstable angina, noncardiac chest pain, cardiac 
but noncoronary disease (eg, tachyarrhythmias, perimyo-
carditis), and symptoms of unknown origin with normal 
levels of hs-cTnT.
Assessment of Renal Function
Renal function was quantified by estimating glomerular filtra-
tion rate (eGFR) with the use of the chronic kidney disease 
epidemiology collaboration formula based on plasma creati-
nine level obtained at presentation to the ED, age, sex, and 
ethnicity.23 For this analysis, RD was defined as an eGFR of 
<60 mL/min/1.73 m.2 Creatinine measurements were per-
formed on a Roche Modular P1 analyzer with the enzymatic 
creatinine-peroxidase-antiperoxidase PAP method for quan-
tification (Roche Diagnostics). Serum creatinine can be con-
verted from micromoles per liter to milligrams per deciliter 
by dividing by 88.4. Preexisting kidney dysfunction was doc-
umented based on previous hospital records and detailed 
patient history at the time of ED presentation.
Investigational hs-cTn Measurements
Blood samples for determination of hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI were 
collected into tubes containing potassium EDTA (as an anti-
coagulant) or serum gel (as a clot activator) at presentation 
to the ED and serially thereafter. Serial sampling was dis-
continued when a patient was discharged or transferred to 
the catheter laboratory for treatment. After centrifugation, 
samples were either analyzed directly or frozen at ‒80°C until 
they were assayed in a blinded fashion in a dedicated core 
laboratory.
According to the manufacturer, the hs-cTnT assay (Elecsys 
2010 high-sensitivity troponin T, Roche Diagnostics) has a 
99th percentile concentration of 14 ng/L with a correspond-
ing coefficient of variation of 10% at 13 ng/L.24 Limit of blank 
and limit of detection have been determined to be 3 ng/L and 
5 ng/L. None of the hs-cTnT measurements in this analysis 
were affected by the 2010 to 2012 calibration shift.25–28
The hs-cTnI assay (ARCHITECT High Sensitive STAT 
Troponin I, Abbott Laboratories) has a 99th percentile con-
centration of 26.2 ng/L with a corresponding coefficient of 
variation of <5% and a limit of detection of 1.9 ng/L.29–31
 Distributions of the latest study blood samples accord-
ing to time since ED presentation and time since chest pain 
onset are listed in Tables II and III in the online-only Data 
Supplement.
ESC hs-cTn 0/1-Hour Algorithm
Recent studies have highlighted fundamental differences 
in mortality risk, pathophysiology, and benefit from early 
coronary angiography and intense dual-antiplatelet therapy 
between patients with NSTEMI and patients with true unsta-
ble angina (not including patients with small NSTEMIs missed 
by conventional cTn assays).1,32 Accordingly, the immediate 
task in the ED is to detect NSTEMI. Thus, the ESC 0/1-hour 
algorithm was designed to detect NSTEMI. The diagnosis of 
unstable angina is based on clinical assessment, ECG, and 
rule-out of NSTEMI in the ED, as well as cardiac imaging per-
formed either in-hospital or on an outpatient basis.1,32
The ESC hs-cTn 0/1-hour algorithm, which should always 
be used in conjunction with all clinical information available, 
including the ECG, triages patients presenting with suspected 
NSTEMI toward rule-out, observe, and rule-in based on assay-
specific levels of hs-cTn obtained at presentation and after 
1 hour (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement).1 The 
assay-specific cutoff levels were derived in diagnostic stud-
ies enrolling unselected patients with mostly normal renal 
function.1,14–19
Main Outcome Measures
The coprimary outcome measures were safety of rule-out, 
accuracy of rule-in, and overall efficacy of the ESC 0/1-hour 
algorithm in patients with RD. Safety was quantified as sen-
sitivity for NSTEMI in the rule-out group, accuracy as specific-
ity for NSTEMI in the rule-in group, and overall efficacy as 
the proportion of patients triaged to either rule-out or rule-in

based on the 0- and 1-hour sample. Because prevalence of 
NSTEMI differs between patients with RD and patients with 
normal renal function,10 the negative predictive value (NPV) 
for NSTEMI in the rule-out group and the positive predictive 
value (PPV) in the rule-in group, which both depend on prev-
alence, were considered as secondary outcome measures. 
Additional secondary outcome measures included the propor-
tion of patients assigned directly to rule-out or rule-in based 
on the single hs-cTn concentration measured at presentation.
Subgroup analyses assessing the diagnostic performance 
of the 0/1-hour algorithm were performed in early presenters 
(≤2 hours after chest pain onset), in patients with preexisting 
and new onset of RD, in women and men, and in the dataset 
after exclusion of patients who were part of the initial deriva-
tion cohort of the 1-hour algorithms.
To extend and corroborate the concept of the ESC 0/1-
hour algorithm in patients with RD, diagnostic performance 
was further assessed using stepwise modified cutoff criteria 
optimized for patients with RD using hs-cTn concentrations at 
presentation or absolute changes within the first hour.
Follow-Up and Clinical End Points
Patients were contacted 3, 12, and 24 months after discharge 
by telephone calls or in written form. Information regarding 
death during follow-up was furthermore obtained from the 
patient’s hospital notes, the family physician’s records, and 
the national registry on mortality. The coprimary prognostic 
end points were overall survival after 30 days and 2 years. The 
secondary prognostic end point was major adverse cardiac 
events (MACEs), defined as the composite of all-cause mor-
tality, AMI (including index event), cardiogenic shock, ventric-
ular tachyarrhythmias, or higher degree atrioventricular block 
at 30 days.
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as medians (1st quartile, 3rd quartile) 
for continuous variables and for categorical variables as num-
bers and percentages. Continuous variables were compared 
with the Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables 
using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. 
Receiver operating characteristics curves were constructed 
to assess the discriminative performance throughout hs-cTn 
concentrations at presentation and their absolute changes in 
≤1 hour to diagnose NSTEMI. The comparison of independent 
areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 
performed as recommended by Hanley and McNeil.33
We used the cross tables derived by the application of 
the official ESC assay-specific cutoff criteria for rule-out or 
rule-in to calculate diagnostic performance parameters and 
their 95% confidence intervals (CI).34 To compare sensitivity, 
specificity, NPV, PPV, and efficacy, we used a chi-square or 
Fisher exact test for unpaired samples and the McNemar test 
or the method described by Moskowitz and Pepe35 for paired 
samples, as appropriate. Correlations between renal function 
and concentrations/changes of hs-cTn were determined with 
the use of the Spearman rank correlation based on log-trans-
formed hs-cTn values. 
Overall survival and MACE-free survival during follow-up 
according to the classification provided by the respective 0/1-
hour algorithm were plotted in Kaplan-Meier curves, and a 
log-rank test was used to assess differences in survival among 
groups.
Unless stated otherwise, results are reported based on 
dataset A. All hypothesis testing was 2-tailed, and P values 
of <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance 
without adjustments for multiple testing. All statistical analy-
ses were performed with the use of IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows, version 23.0 (SPSS Inc), R statistical software ver-
sion 3.4.1 (www.R-project.org, R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing), and MedCalc Statistical Software, version 17.8 
(MedCalc Software bvba).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From 4323 consecutively recruited patients, serial hs-
cTnT measurements at presentation and after 1 hour 
were available in 3254 patients (dataset A, 100%) and 
serial hs-cTnI measurements in 2949 patients (dataset 
B) (Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). Base-
line characteristics are depicted in the Table 1 and Table 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement. Dataset B rep-
resented a subset of dataset A (overlap, 91%) (Table V 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Prevalence of RD 
was 15% (487/3254 in dataset A, 445/2949 in dataset 
B) with a median eGFR of 48 (37, 55) ml/min/1.73 m2 as 
compared with 93 (81, 104) ml/min/1.73 m2 in patients 
with normal renal function. Patients with RD differed 
from patients with normal renal function in multiple 
baseline characteristics, including higher prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors, previous myocardial infarc-
tion, and ECG abnormalities.
Adjudicated Final Diagnosis
NSTEMI was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 515 of 
3254 (16%) patients. In patients with RD, prevalence 
of NSTEMI was 31% compared with 13% in patients 
with normal renal function (P<0.001). The prevalence 
of NSTEMI was significantly higher in those patients 
with RD who had preexisting kidney disease (37% ver-
sus 24%, P=0.002). Among all NSTEMIs, type 2 NSTEMI 
was more frequent in patients with RD compared with 
patients with normal renal function (22% versus 10%, 
P<0.001) (Table VI in the online-only Data Supple-
ment), resulting in an overall type 2 NSTEMI prevalence 
of 6.8% (33/487) in patients with RD compared with 
1.3% (35/2767) in patients with normal renal function. 
Also, cardiac causes other than coronary artery disease 
were more common in patients with RD and noncar-
diac causes less common compared with patients with 
normal renal function. Disagreement between the 2 
independent cardiologists adjudicating the final diag-
nosis was more common in patients with RD compared 
with patients with normal renal function (13.1% versus 
9.1%, P=0.006).

Hs-cTn Concentrations at Presentation 
and 1-Hour Changes According to Renal 
Function and Final Diagnosis
In patients with RD and patients with normal renal 
function, hs-cTn concentrations at presentation as well 
as absolute 1-hour changes were significantly higher in 
NSTEMI compared with other final diagnoses (P<0.001 
for all comparisons, data not shown).
In patients with final diagnoses other than NSTEMI, 
hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI concentrations at presentation as 
well as absolute 1-hour changes showed a strong, in-
verse correlation with eGFR, which was not observed in 
NSTEMI (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).

The diagnostic accuracy of hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI concen-
trations at presentation for NSTEMI, as quantified by 
the areas under the receiver operating characteristics 
curve, was high among patients with RD (for hs-cTnT, 
0.87 [95% CI, 0.84–0.90]; for hs-cTnI, 0.86 [95% CI, 
0.83–0.90]) but even significantly higher in patients 
with normal renal function (for hs-cTnT, 0.94 [95% CI, 
0.93–0.95]; for hs-cTnI, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.92–0.95]) (Fig-
ure IV in the online-only Data Supplement). Smaller dif-
ferences were observed for the diagnostic accuracy of

were part of the original derivation cohorts of the 2 
investigated 0/1-hour algorithms. Details on the diag-

the various subgroups are listed in Tables IX‒XII in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
Modifications of the 0/1-Hour Algorithm 
to Optimize Rule-Out Efficacy and Rule-In 
Specificity in Patients With RD
Stepwise increase of the official ESC assay-specific 
cutoff criteria for rule-out of NSTEMI resulted in in-
creasing rule-out efficacy, however at the cost of rule-
out safety. Stepwise increase of the official ESC assay-
specific cutoff criteria for rule-in of NSTEMI resulted in 
increasing specificity of rule-in, however at the cost of 
rule-in efficacy (Tables XIII and XIV in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Among the numerous possible 
cutoff criteria combinations, 1 specific cutoff value 
combination for rule-out, preserving the same sensi-
tivity as the official ESC cutoff value combination, as 
well as 1 specific cutoff value combination for rule-
in, was chosen for each hs-cTn assay to compare its 
performance with the official ESC 0/1-hour algorithm 
(Table XV and Figures V and VI in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Cutoff concentrations optimized for RD 
increased rule-out efficacy and rule-in specificity by 
4.5% (P<0.001) and 3.9% (P<0.001), respectively, for 
hs-cTnT and by 4.7% (P<0.001) and 3.7%, (P=0.001) 
respectively, for hs-cTnI. However, because improved

rule-in specificity was obtained at the cost of rule-in 
efficacy, overall efficacy could not be optimized with 
the modified 0/1-hour algorithm (for hs-cTnT, ‒1.0%, 
P=0.568; for hs-cTnI, +1.1%, P=0.500).
Prognostic Performance of the ESC 0/1-
Hour Algorithm
Median follow-up time was 749 days (418, 847). Es-
timated overall-survival was 99.2% at 30 days and 
94.3% at 2 years. Particularly in patients with RD, the 
ESC 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI al-
lowed a powerful discrimination between high versus 
moderate and low probability of short-term (30 days) 
and midterm (2 years) overall survival and short-term 
(30 days) MACE-free survival in the respective rule-
out, observe, and rule-in groups (all log-rank P values 
<0.001) (Figure 5 and Figure VII in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
DISCUSSION
This prospective, multicenter diagnostic study enrolling 
unselected patients presenting with acute chest dis-
comfort to the ED used central adjudication to assess 
the performance of the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm in pa-
tients with RD. We report 8 major findings.
 First, patients with RD presenting with acute chest 
discomfort to the ED had NSTEMI >2 times as often and 
type 2 NSTEMI even >5 times as often as patients with 
normal renal function. This observation extends and 
corroborates previous studies indicating that RD is not 
only commonly associated with coronary artery disease 
but also hypertensive heart disease and other structural 
cardiac disorders prone to developing the triggers of 
type 2 myocardial infarction, such as tachyarrhythmias, 
hypertension, and anemia.8–10,36,37
Second, hs-cTn concentrations at presentation and 
their absolute 1-hour changes correlated strongly and 
inversely with eGFR in patients with diagnoses other 
than NSTEMI but not NSTEMI. Third, in patients with 
RD, the diagnostic performance of hs-cTn concentra-
tions at presentation was high (areas under the re-
ceiver operating characteristics curve, 0.86–0.87) and 
further increased on using absolute 1-hour hs-cTn 
changes (areas under the receiver operating charac-
teristics curve, 0.88–0.92). 
Fourth, and likely of utmost importance, the safe-
ty of the official ESC 0/1-hour algorithm was high in 
patients with RD (sensitivity, 98.6‒100) and compara-
ble to patients with normal renal function (sensitivity, 
98.5–99.2) irrespective of whether hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI 
was used. However, the efficacy of rule-out was sub-
stantially reduced in patients with RD and allowed the 
early rule-out in 18% of patients only. 
Fifth, because of the higher proportions of patients 
with elevated levels of hs-cTn even in the absence of 
NSTEMI, specificity of rule-in was lower in patients with 
RD (84.4–88.7) compared with patients with normal renal 
function (91.7–96.5). However, the higher prevalence of 
NSTEMI in patients with RD also increased rule-in efficacy 
while maintaining high PPV of rule-in. The performance 
measures (mainly the PPV) of the ESC hs-cTnT 0/1-hour al-
gorithm and the ESC hs-cTnI 0/1-hour algorithm showed 
subtle but consistent differences to the advantage of hs-
cTnT. These differences are at least in part caused by the 
fact that serial measurements of hs-cTnT but not hs-cTnI 
were part of the extensive clinical information available 
for the adjudication of the final diagnosis in all patients. 
Accordingly, our methodology provided the most accu-
rate and valid estimates for the ESC hs-cTnT 0/1-hour 
algorithm but possibly slightly underestimated the true 
performance of the ESC hs-cTnI 0/1-hour algorithm. 
Sixth, overall efficacy allowing triage toward rule-out 
or rule-in based on the 0/1-hour samples was substan-
tially reduced in patients with RD (51.3–53.5) compared 
with patients with normal renal function (76.1–81.2). 
This difference was driven by the substantial reduc-
tion in rule-out efficacy that could only partly be com-
pensated for by the increase of rule-in efficacy. As a 
consequence, the percentage of patients remaining in 
the observe zone and usually requiring additional di-
agnostic tests including a 3-hour sample of hs-cTn and 
cardiac imaging is nearly twice as high in patients with 
RD compared with patients with normal renal function. 
Seventh, using slightly higher cutoff concentrations 
of hs-cTn as an attempt to increase rule-out efficacy and 
rule-in specificity only partly helped to overcome the 
challenges posed by RD. The high pretest probability for 
NSTEMI in patients with RD challenges the derivation of 
an alternative 0/1-hour algorithm that would balance 
rule-out efficacy and rule-in specificity substantially better 
than the official ESC 0/1-hour algorithm without losing 
safety. It is a matter of debate how much increase of rule-
out efficacy at the cost of rule-out safety or how much 
increase of rule-in specificity at the cost of rule-in efficacy 
would be acceptable. The use of alternative cutoff crite-
ria combinations yielded rather small improvements even 
though they were tested in a derivation setting unblinded 
to the outcome NSTEMI. Accordingly, the observed small 
improvements in efficacy when using alternative cutoffs 
are associated with a potential systematic bias toward 
overestimating the real improvements, which might be 
even smaller in subsequent external validation in an in-
dependent study. Therefore, and because safety and 
simplicity are the most important characteristics of any 
diagnostic algorithm, the findings of this study recom-
mend the use of the official ESC 0/1-hour algorithm in 
patients with RD until information technology-based de-
cision tools integrating all available information (eg, age, 
sex, serial hs-cTn measurements, renal function) become

available in clinical routine. The PPV for NSTEMI in pa-
tients assigned toward rule-in and thereby early coronary 
angiography would still be considered high enough by 
most experts, particularly given the difficulty of obtain-
ing similar diagnostic certainty in patients with moderate 
elevations in cTn without coronary angiography.
Eighth, the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm allowed a pow-
erful discrimination between high versus moderate 
and lower probability of short- and midterm overall 
survival as well as short-term MACE-free survival in the 
respective rule-out, observe, and rule-in groups also 
in patients with RD. The rather high rate of all-cause 
mortality during follow-up and MACE within 30 days 
of patients in the observe zone can be explained by the 
high incidence of chronic diseases in those patients, 
such as chronic heart failure, which are associated with 
high rates of both overall mortality and MACE within 
30 days. These findings extend and corroborate previ-
ous studies addressing the multitude of major unmet 
clinical needs in the often elderly patients with RD.8–10,38
Many of these challenges are related to the high 
prevalence of common yet undiagnosed cardiac co-
morbidities including hypertensive heart disease and 
diabetic cardiomyopathy associated with chronic cardio-
myocyte injury and therefore increases in hs-cTn plasma 
concentrations and an increased prevalence of ECG 
abnormalities in patients with RD. The exact underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms are incompletely un-
derstood. The contribution of cardiomyocyte injury to 
elevated plasma concentrations of hs-cTn in RD seems 
to be far greater than that of impaired renal clearance, 
particularly because the molecular size of the intact mol-
ecule is too large to be filtrated by glomeruli.36,37,39–41 
Although cTn molecules may be degraded into smaller 
fragments that are small enough to be filtered by the 
kidney,42 the renal elimination and half-life of these cTn 
fragments seem to be similar in patients with RD and 
patients with normal renal function.43 In addition, in 
patients with end-stage renal disease and only minimal 
remaining endogenous renal function, successful renal 
transplantation leads to a substantial reduction and of-
ten normalization of serum creatinine but no relevant 
change in plasma concentrations of cTnI.39 It has been 
hypothesized that the underlying mechanism of chronic 
cTn release is associated with a cardiorenal syndrome 
triggered by some inflammatory processes leading to 
chronic cardiomyocyte injury and cTn release in RD.44,45
Initial pilot studies evaluating the use of single cut-
off concentrations suggested that in patients with RD, 
adjusted higher hs-cTn concentrations might provide a 
better balance between sensitivity and specificity com-
pared with the 99th percentiles or the optimal single-
cutoff concentration derived in patients with normal 
renal function.10 Meanwhile, the clinical use of hs-cTn 
has advanced, and current guidelines recommend the 
integrated use of baseline hs-cTn concentrations and 
their absolute changes during serial sampling, as incor-
porated in the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm.1 In contrast to 
a single cutoff strategy, the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm tri-
ages patients toward 1 of 3 strata: rule-out, observe, or 
rule-in. Assessing the possible use of adjusted higher 
hs-cTn concentrations within this state-of-the-art con-
cept in patients with RD revealed pros and cons.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study 
investigating in detail the diagnostic performance of the 
ESC 0/1-hour algorithm in the vulnerable patient popu-
lation with RD, extending the excellent performance 
characteristics observed in patients with overwhelm-
ingly normal renal function.16–21 We cannot generalize 
our findings to patients with terminal kidney failure on 
chronic dialysis because they were excluded from this 
study. Additionally, our study was conducted in patients 
at the ED with symptoms suggestive of AMI. Further 
studies are required to quantify the utility of the ESC 
0/1-hour algorithm in patients with either higher (eg, in 
a coronary care unit setting) or lower (eg, in a general 
practitioner setting) pretest probability for AMI.
Some limitations merit consideration when interpret-
ing these findings. First, although we used the most strin-
gent methodology to adjudicate the presence or absence 
of NSTEMI, including central adjudication by experienced 
cardiologists, imaging, and serial measurements of hs-
cTn, we still may have misclassified a small number of 
patients.3,14 Second, to reflect the clinical information 
available to the ED physician when interpreting hs-cTn 
concentrations, we classified RD according to eGFR based 
on the serum creatinine concentrations obtained at ED 
presentation. Accordingly, this classification differs from 
the definition of chronic kidney disease, which would re-
quire RD to be present for 3 months.46 Third, the chronic 
kidney disease epidemiology collaboration formula was 
used to estimate GFR irrespective of age. However, the 
chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration for-
mula was primarily validated in patients <70 years of age.
In conclusion, in patients with RD, the safety of the 
ESC 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but the specificity of 
rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased. Modifications 
of cutoffs can only partly overcome the challenges of RD.
