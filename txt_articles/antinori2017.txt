Openness to experience is characterised by flexible and inclusive cognition. Here we investigated
whether this extends to basic visual perception, such that open people combine information more flex-
ibly, even at low-levels of perceptual processing. We used binocular rivalry, where the brain alternates
between perceptual solutions and times where neither solution is fully suppressed, mixed percept.
Study 1 showed that openness is positively associated with duration of mixed percept and ruled out
the possibility of response bias. Study 2 showed that mixed percept increased following a positive mood
induction particularly for open people. Overall, the results showed that openness is linked to differences
in low-level visual perceptual experience. Further studies should investigate whether this may be driven
by common neural processes.

1. Introducion
Trait openness to Experience (hereafter, openness) represents a
scientific frontier in personality psychology —it was the last of
the five major personality domains to gain acceptance, and is still
the least well understood (for a recent review see DeYoung,
2014). A common theme linking the various characteristics
described by Openness is flexible and inclusive cognition: Open
people are more curious, creative (Kaufman et al., 2016; Silvia
et al., 2008) and motivated to explore the world and engage with
possibilities (DeYoung, 2014; McCrae & Costa, 1997). People high
in openness may even experience the world differently to the aver-
age person as a result of their ‘‘breadth, depth, and permeability of
consciousness, and . . .[their]. . . recurrent need to enlarge and
examine experience” (McCrae & Costa, 1997, p. 826). In this paper,
we ask whether this tendency toward inclusive cognition — which
we could think of as increased flexibility in binding of different
representational elements in the brain — extends to basic visual
perception. This objective is in line with recent research showing
that stable difference in personality mirror differences in structural
and functional properties of the brain (Passamonti et al., 2015). Our
interest here is to determine whether similar relations between
personality and visual perceptual processing exist.
Several previous studies indirectly suggest that open people
experience things differently: For instance, openness predicts per-
formance on divergent thinking tasks (Kaufman et al., 2016; Silvia
et al., 2008), which require one to identify multiple diverse uses for
ordinary objects. For open people this seems to happen effortlessly,
suggesting a more flexible way of combining information, perhaps
even at low-levels of perceptual processing. For example, people
high in openness display reductions in latent inhibition (i.e.,
attenuated attentional processing following repeated stimulus
exposure) suggesting individual differences in pre-conscious atten-
tional mechanisms (Peterson & Carson, 1999; Peterson, Smith, &
Carson, 2002). Latent inhibition reflects an adaptive attentional
‘gating’ system for screening out irrelevant information, but for
open people this system appears to be more flexible, resulting in
continued processing of stimuli from which the average individual
has disengaged. However, we are aware of no previous research
examining whether openness relates to how people actually see
visual stimuli.
To address this question, we examined how openness relates to
the well-known perceptual phenomenon called binocular rivalry,
where contrasting stimuli are presented simultaneously to each
eye (for a review see Tong, Meng, & Blake, 2006). When faced with
this incompatible visual information, observers typically report
alternation or ‘flipping’ between these two continuously presented
stimuli every few seconds. Interestingly, another perceptual expe-
rience called ‘mixed percept’ occasionally occurs between these
serial alternations. In these cases the two stimuli appear fused into
one, and complete suppression of either stimulus is inhibited

 (Yang, Rose, & Blake, 1992). The processes underlying mixed per-
cept remain unclear, with some authors suggesting a role of neural
plasticity (Klink, Brascamp, Blake, & van Wezel, 2010) and others
emphasizing an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neural
activity (Said, Egan, Minshew, Behrmann, & Heeger, 2013). One
interesting feature of mixed percept, however, is that it shows
between-person variability and within-person stability over time
(Miller et al., 2010), suggesting a possible relation with personality.
In this paper, we hypothesised that the susceptibility to the
mixed percept experience may be related to openness. Because
openness reflects the tendency to actively explore information
and engage with complex possibilities (DeYoung, 2014), people
high in openness may also be more likely to experience creative
solutions to the incompatible rivalry stimuli. Furthermore, the sus-
tained processing of non-instrumental stimuli by open people dur-
ing latent inhibition (Peterson & Carson, 1999; Peterson et al.,
2002), may also occur during rivalry, thereby impeding the com-
plete suppression of either percept. If openness does indeed predict
mixed percept, it would constitute the first empirical evidence that
open people may have different visual experiences to the average
individual.
To investigate this in study 1 we conducted two experiments. In
the first experiment we presented individuals with a simple binoc-
ular rivalry task (red and green orthogonal gratings to alternate
eyes)
and
administered
the Big
Five Aspects
Scales (BFAS;
DeYoung, Quilty, & Peterson, 2007) which includes a measure of
Openness/Intellect (O/I). This compound label reflects an early
debate about how to best conceptualise the fifth personality
domain (see Saucier, 1992), and the full scale can be divided into
separate openness and intellect sub-scales. While intellect is con-
ceptualised as engagement with semantic or abstract information,
openness is conceptualised as engagement with aesthetic or per-
ceptual information (DeYoung, 2013, 2014). In line with this, intel-
lect (but not openness) predicts working memory performance
(DeYoung, Shamosh, Green, Braver, & Gray, 2009) while openness
(but not intellect) predicts implicit learning of patterned sequences
(Kaufman et al., 2010). Given the inherently perceptual nature of
the mixed percept phenomenon, we therefore hypothesised open-
ness more so than intellect would be associated with mixed
percept.
In the second experiment (study 1b) we sought to rule out the
possibility that open people report more incidence of mixed per-
cept simply because they have a more lenient response threshold
for reporting more mixed. To do so, we manipulated the size of
the visual stimuli. The incidence of mixed percept reported during
a ‘typical’ rivalry task is characterised by individual differences
(Miller et al., 2010). However, the absolute duration of mixed per-
cept is also sensitive to the stimulus characteristics. Specifically,
the overall incidence of mixed percept increases with larger stim-
ulus size, reflecting physiological properties of the visual cortex
(for a more detailed description of the phenomenon see Blake,
O’Shea, & Mueller, 1992). Thus, by using larger stimuli we pre-
dicted that the increased contribution of low-level properties of
the visual cortex would lead to a reduction of the influence of per-
sonality on one’s perceptual experience when viewing the task.
In study 2, we administered the same rivalry task following a
positive mood induction procedure involving perceptually and aes-
thetically pleasing imagery, to which open people appear particu-
larly responsive (Fayn, MacCann, Tiliopoulos, & Silvia, 2015;
McCrae, 2007; Silvia & Nusbaum, 2011). This served the purpose
of exploring whether differences in one’s perceptual experience
may be influenced not only by stable factors (personality) but also
by transient states (mood). With respect to the effects of mood on
perceptual rivalry, a number of studies have shown that mood can
alter the competition for visual awareness by favouring the stimu-
lus congruent to one’s mood (Anderson, Siegel, & Barrett, 2011). In
addition, positive mood tends to specifically decrease observers’
inhibitory control in filtering unattended information, favouring
more inclusive processing (Rowe, Hirsh, & Anderson, 2007). Finally,
contextualised perspectives on personality (e.g., DeYoung, 2015;
Tett & Guterman, 2000) suggest that effects of personality will be
most pronounced in the context of trait-relevant stimuli or situa-
tions. In the case of the current study we were interested in
whether one mood condition in particular would act as a trait-
relevant cue especially for open people. This would be expected
to increase the relative impact of factors associated with openness
on perceptual processing and lead to an increased susceptibility to
experiencing the mixed percept for open people.
2. Study 1
2.1. Method
2.1.1. Participants
We recruited 134 University of Melbourne undergraduate stu-
dents, who participated in the research for course credit. All partic-
ipants had normal or corrected to normal vision. We excluded 11
participants prior to analysis: 5 because they did not report alter-
nating stimuli, indicating that rivalry did not occur, and 6 because
they responded for less than 50% of the total duration of the trial.
There was therefore a final N of 123 participants (30% Male, aged
M = 19.49, SD = 2.92). This sample provides 80% power to detect
the average effect size in personality psychology (i.e., r � 0.25;
Fraley & Marks, 2007). All studies were approved by the University
of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee, in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
2.1.2. Personality questionnaire
The Big Five Aspects Scales (BFAS) DeYoung et al. (2007) is a
100-item measure of the Five Factor Model (McCrae & Costa,
1987). It provides assessment of each of the five domains
(Extraversion,
Neuroticism,
Agreeableness,
Conscientiousness,
and O/I) along with each of their two lower level aspects
(DeYoung et al., 2007). Respondents indicate the extent to which
they agree or disagree with each of the items on a 5-point rating
scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) through 3 (neutral) to 5
(strongly agree). Cronbach’s alpha for each trait domain and its
component was acceptable (see Table 2).
2.1.3. Binocular rivalry
2.1.3.1. Apparatus and stimuli. The rival targets were stationary
green and red gratings (stimulus sizes 1.4�, with a spatial fre-
quency of 4 cpd) oriented ±45� from vertical, within a circular
frame. Stimuli were generated in MatlabTM using the Psychophysics
Toolbox extension (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997), displayed on an
Apple computer monitor (23-in. monitor, 60 Hz frame rate,
1280x800pixel resolution), and viewed through a mirror stereo-
scope (viewing distance 33 cm).
2.1.3.2. Instructions. Participants were instructed to continuously
report what they were experiencing via key press. When perceiv-
ing the red or green grating they had to press and hold down the
left or right arrow key, respectively. Participants were instructed
to report any instances of mixed percept (time where the two stim-
uli appeared as a grid or patchwork combination of the two per-
cepts) by holding down both the left and right arrow keys
simultaneously.

were
recorded
continuously
throughout a single 120 s trial. While some rivalry studies use mul-
tiple short (e.g., 10–20 s) trials, we opted for a single 120 s trial to
16

 reduce the impact of stimulus onset, which is often associated with
an initial period of fusion (Wolfe, 1983) or strong biases in percep-
tual state that are distinct from sustained viewing conditions
(Carter & Cavanagh, 2007; Stanley, Forte, & Cavanagh, 2011). Prior
to the experimental task, participants underwent a 60 s training
session to ensure they understood the instructions. Mixed percept
was calculated as the total duration that participants pressed both
the left and right arrow keys simultaneously for at least 220 ms
(this threshold was chosen as a consequence of the response sam-
pling rate and the desire to exclude the very brief periods of dual
button response during transitions between left and right arrow
presses). The calculated duration was then expressed as a percent-
age of the trial duration (% Mixed).
2.2. Results
As reports of mixed percept were severely skewed, Spearman’s
rank-order correlation was used to examine the association
between mixed percept (M = 0.11; SD = 0.09) and personality.
Mixed percept was positively correlated with O/I and extraversion,
and negatively correlated with neuroticism (see Table 1; for full
correlation matrix see Supplementary material Table 1). These cor-
relations are unlikely to be independent, and are consistent with
the existence of higher order traits located ‘above’ the Big Five
(DeYoung et al., 2007). Indeed, after accounting for the relation
between O/I and mixed percept within a hierarchical regression,
F(1,122) = 5.15, p = 0.025, the remaining Big Five domains did not
account for significant incremental variance, Fch(4,117) = 2.13,
p = 0.081, nor contribute uniquely to prediction (all ps > 0.05; see
Table 2).
In the current study we focused on mixed percept. Findings pre-
viously published by our group provide a more detailed account of
the impact of personality and mood on switch rate (Antinori,
Smillie, & Carter, 2017). Of most relevance to the current studies
is the finding that people reporting more mixed percept are also
characterised by shorter mean percept durations so it is not the
case that people report longer periods of mixed percept because
they generally switch more slowly between states and end up with
a higher proportion of mixed percept reported overall. There was
no significant relation between openness /intellect and mean per-
cept duration (a significant correlation was seen with industrious-
ness) or mood manipulation (Antinori et al., 2017).
3. Study 1b (Control and Replication)
3.1. Method
3.1.1. Participants
A new sample was recruited consisting of 79 University of Mel-
bourne undergraduates who participated in exchange for course
credit (19% Male, aged M = 19.47, SD = 3.48). All participants had
normal or corrected to normal vision.
3.1.2. Binocular rivalry
3.1.2.1. Apparatus and stimuli. Two different stimulus sizes were
used: small (1.4�) —identical to study 1 — and large (2.3�). The
two stimuli sizes were presented twice to all participants in blocks
of 60 s in random order (i.e., 240 s total). Personality measures
were identical to study 1(alpha values provided Table 2). All other
apparatus, instructions and stimuli characteristics were identical
to the first experiment in study 1.
3.2. Results
As expected, when using larger stimuli there was no relation
between mixed percept and any BFAS personality traits, including
near-zero correlations with I/O and its two subscales. Conversely,
when using the smaller stimuli, identical to that used in study
1a, the previously observed correlation with O/I was replicated
(see Table 1, the full correlation matrix for this analysis is available
in Supplementary material Table 2). With respect to the impact of
stimulus size on mixed percept, an increase in mixed percept was
observed only when comparing study 1 (M = 0.11, SD = 0.12) to the
bigger stimuli used in study 1b (bigger stimuli M = 0.28, SD = 0.16).

 On the other hand, no significant effect of stimulus size on mixed
percept was seen within study 1 (M = 0.27; SD = 0.12).
To probe these results further, we ran a further analysis to
investigate whether open people not only perceive a greater dura-
tion of mixed percept, but also perceive it more frequently. How-
ever, in neither study 1 nor study 1b did openness, or its two
lower-order aspects correlate with the number of mixed percept
responses. With respect to the relation of the number of mixed
percept responses and other personality traits, in study 1 the there
was a (negative) correlation only with neuroticism r(128) = �18,
p = 0.04, while in study 1b no traits were correlated with the num-
ber of mixed percept responses (p > 0.05).
In summary, the relation between O/I and mixed percept was
successfully replicated in a new sample of participants when using
the original stimulus size. However, when a larger stimulus is used
(increasing the relative contribution of neurophysiological proper-
ties of early visual cortex) the relation with personality was no
longer maintained. This finding is important as it gives us confi-
dence that the effect is a true impact of personality on perception
rather than an artefact reflecting a response bias of open individu-
als having a lower criteria threshold for reporting mixed percept.
This is because any influence of response bias should be insensitive
to stimulus size.
4. Study 2
4.1. Method
4.1.1. Participants
A third sample was recruited consisting of 91 University of Mel-
bourne undergraduates who participated in exchange for course
credit (28% Male, aged M = 19.06, SD = 2.50). The number of partic-
ipants was informed by previous research using this paradigm
(e.g., Smillie, Cooper, Wilt, & Revelle, 2012). Each subject was ran-
domly assigned to either one of the three experimental conditions:
Neutral
(n = 33),
Pleasant
(n = 29),
and
Appetitive
(n = 29),
described below.
4.1.2. Apparatus and stimuli
All rivalry stimuli/instructions and personality scales were
described in study 1a (alpha values provided in Table 3).
4.1.3. Guided imagination procedure
Participants were tested individually in a dimly lit testing
booth. The guided imagination task presents short vignettes via a
computerized slideshow and accompanying music via headphones,
and has been used previously for inducing mood states (see Smillie
et al., 2012). Each vignette (3 per condition) described a different
scenario and remained on the screen for 2 min. Scenarios in the
Pleasant condition involved vivid descriptions of aesthetically
pleasing imagery (e.g., ‘‘You are walking peacefully through a quiet
and picturesque forest”). As a control condition, three neutral sce-
narios described daily mundane situations, Neutral condition
(e.g., ‘‘You are putting a few things away in the kitchen on a weekend
afternoon”). As a second control condition, three appetitive scenar-
ios described positive, rewarding events that had no salient aes-
thetic or perceptual features (e.g., You buy a lottery ticket and win
$10,000 instantly). Participants were instructed to imagine how
they would feel and what they would think in each different sce-
nario. The music used for each mood condition was: Venus from
‘‘The Planets” by Holst for the Pleasant condition; Waltz of the
Flowers from the ‘‘Nutcracker Suite” by Tchaikovsky for the Appet-
itive condition; the Largo movement from ‘‘The New World Sym-
phony” by Dvorak for the Neutral condition.
4.1.4. State affect
To test the impact of the guided imagery procedure on mood,
participants were asked to rate on a 4-point Likert scale ranging
from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Very well’ how much their current feelings
(‘‘right now”) matched a list of four items drawn from the 12-
Point Affect Circumplex Questionnaire (12-PAC; Yik, Russell, &
Steiger, 2011). It was expected that the Pleasant condition would
elicit positive pleasant mood (items: relaxed, content) while the
Appetitive condition would elicit activated positive mood (items:
excited, lively).
4.2. Procedure
Participants firstly completed a baseline measure of state affect.
They then underwent the mood induction procedure they were
assigned to. At the end of the mood induction participants filled
the post-mood induction state affect, before then performing the
binocular rivalry task. While performing the binocular rivalry task,
participants continued to listen to the music that had accompanied
the mood induction procedure. Finally, participants completed the
BFAS questionnaire.
4.3. Results
4.3.1. Preliminary statistics
A One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for independent
groups confirmed that experimental groups did not differ signifi-
cantly in any of the personality traits or baseline affect measures
(see Table 3).
4.3.2. Mood induction
To confirm that the mood induction procedure had its intended
effect, we conducted a mixed ANOVA 2 (pre/post) � 2 (activated/
pleasant positive) � 3 (mood condition). This resulted in a signifi-
cant three-way interaction, F(2,88) = 39.47, p < 0.001, gp
2 = 0.47,
indicating that the pre-post change in affect was influenced both
by mood conditions and affect type. As expected, pleasant positive
affect significantly increased in the Pleasant condition t(28)
= �4.22, p < 0.001, g2 = 0.40 and decreased in the Appetitive condi-
tion t(28) = 3.58, p < 0.001, g2 = 0.32 but did not change in the
Neutral condition t(32) = �1.79, p = 0.08. Moreover, activated pos-
itive affect significantly increased in the Appetitive condition, t
(28) = �4.40, p < 0.001, g2 = 0.42, and decreased in the Pleasant
condition t(28) = 3.92, p < 0.001, g2 = 0.36, but did not change in
the Neutral condition t(32) = 1.49, p = 0.15.
4.3.3. Pleasant, aesthetic imagery and mixed percept
We then examined whether the vivid aesthetic imagery in the
Pleasant condition resulted in increased mixed percept, compared
to the two control conditions. As the homogeneity of variance
assumption was violated (p = 0.001), Brown-Forsythe F tests was
performed, revealing a significant effect of mood condition on per-
centage of mixed percept, F(2,66.101) = 3.78, p = 0.03, g2 = 0.80.
Moreover, planned contrasts confirmed that those in the Pleasant
condition reported a marginally greater duration of mixed percept
(M = 0.17, SD = 0.12) compared to those in the other two conditions
(Neutral M = 0.14, SD = 0.09; Appetitive M = 0.10, SD = 0.06), t
(38.162) = 2.01, p = 0.05 Cohen’s d = 0.65 (see Fig. 1). Unexpectedly,
however, this difference was significant relative only to the appet-
itive (p = 0.02) but not the neutral condition (p = 0.40).
We then used moderated regression to examine whether the
effect of our pleasant mood induction on mixed percept was more
pronounced for open individuals. This showed that the relation
between openness and mixed percept differed between the neutral
and pleasant conditions, b = 0.11, 95% CI [0.014, 0.204], t = 2.31,
p = 0.02, and between the pleasant and appetitive conditions,
18

 b = 0.10, 95% CI [0.028, 0.171], t = 2.79, p = 0.01. This interaction is
depicted in Fig. 2. In contrast to these findings, the relation
between intellect (i.e., the other aspect of O/I) and mixed percept
did

condition
b = 0.05, 95% CI [�0.045, 0.147], t = 1.06, p = 0.29, nor between
the pleasant and appetitive conditions b = 0.05, 95% CI [�0.039,
0.142], t = 1.14, p = 0.26. The full correlation matrix of BFAS and
Mixed percept for each mood condition is available in Supplemen-
tary material (See Supplement material Tables 3–5).
5. Discussion
Openness to experience has long been associated with flexible
and inclusive cognition, as shown by its links with liberal values
(Xu, Mar, & Peterson, 2013) and creativity (Kaufman et al., 2016;
Silvia et al., 2008). Studies also demonstrated that open people
flexibly engage with the environment by processing stimuli that
others tend to ignore (Peterson et al., 2002). Building on this liter-
ature, our three studies show this flexibility extends to basic, low-

 level visual perceptual experience: Just as open people are often
described as being able to ‘see’ more opportunities when presented
with familiar objects (Silvia et al., 2008), we provide the first evi-
dence that they may literally also ‘see’ more possibilities, in that
they identify more flexible ways of combining information within
basic visual stimuli.
Our findings used the classic binocular rivalry paradigm, during
which perceptual experience typically alternates between two
stimuli presented to each eye, but occasionally comprises a percep-
tual solution encompassing aspects of each stimulus (i.e., mixed
percept). Our first study confirmed our hypothesis that open peo-
ple are more susceptible to this inclusive perceptual experience
than their less open counterparts—a result replicated in the control
experiment of study 1b. In line with current theory and research
linking openness with perceptual processing and intellect with
semantic processing (DeYoung, 2013, 2014), we predicted mixed
percept would be related only to the openness aspect of O/I. How-
ever, this pattern of divergence did not emerge, with the intellect
aspect of the scale (vs. openness) contributing more strongly to
the relation with mixed percept in both samples. This suggests that
the roles of openness and intellect in perceptual processing may be
less distinct than first thought. A similar interpretation might be
reached from the observation by Fayn et al. (2015) that both open-
ness and intellect predicted reactivity to novelty in visual art stim-
uli. Also unexpected were the correlations between mixed percept
and other traits of the Big Five (e.g., with extraversion in study 1,
and agreeableness in study 1b). However these associations disap-
peared after controlling for O/I, and were not replicated across our
studies. In contrast, the relation between O/I and mixed percept
was robust across our three samples. Our follow-up study 1b was
jointly motivated to assess the reproducibility of the results
obtained in study 1 while also ruling out response bias toward
reporting mixed percept. Our data showed that under identical
stimulus conditions, the relation between openness and mixed
percept was replicated in an independent sample. Critically, how-
ever, this association disappeared with larger rivalry stimuli. If the
increased reports of mixed percept resulted from an increased ten-
dency for open individuals to simply report their percept as mixed,
then this pattern should have been seen with both sets of stimuli.
However, as the contribution of low-level cortical properties on
mixed percept is thought to be greater when using larger stimuli
(Blake, O’Shea, & Mueller, 1992), we predicted and found that the
impact of personality was reduced. Thus, providing strong evi-
dence of genuine differences in the visual experience of open
people.
The lack of relationship found in the current paper between
mixed percept and any personality traits, when using bigger stim-
uli, is interesting in its own right. To date, relatively few studies
have specifically investigated mixed percept. Although it is well
accepted that the competition between rivalrous images occur at
multiple stages in the visual hierarchy, where mixed percept
occurs remains unclear. However, when using larger stimuli our
data together with Blake et al.’s study (1992), suggests that mixed
percept may be influenced more by low-level visual processes,
rather than higher factors.
In study 2 we explored the effect of guided imagination of per-
ceptual and aesthetic stimuli on mixed percept. In line with the
activation theory (Tett & Guterman, 2000, see also DeYoung,
2015), which states that trait-relevant cues and stimuli activate
trait-relevant processes, we predicted that the aesthetic stimuli
in our guided imagination procedure would increase the suscepti-
bility of open people to experiencing the mixed percept. Results
provided support for this hypothesis with open people reporting
more mixed percept following imagination of pleasant aesthetic
imagery. This finding is consistent with the idea that particularly
the openness subfactor is characterised by the engagement with
the perceptual/aesthetic information. This also shows that a ‘tran-
sient’ manipulation of an internal state can have a clear effect on
one’s visual experience and that rivalry is sensitive not only to
‘stable’ variables, such as personality, but also to ‘transitory’ ones,
such as mood.
Results from our guided imagination procedure were only
partly in line with our predictions, with mixed percept increasing
in the Pleasant condition only compared to one control condition
(Appetitive), but not the other one (Neutral). This may suggest
Neutral vignettes were more perceptually salient than we antici-
pated. For instance, one vignette describes driving along a long
straight road, which may have triggered imagination of expansive
(if affectively muted) landscapes. Despite this, our primary predic-
tion was supported, as the impact of the Pleasant condition on
mixed percept was indeed strongest for people high in openness.
With respect to the potential underlying mechanisms that may
connect mixed percept and O/I, we speculate a common or over-
lapping neurochemical basis. For instance, Openness/Intellect has
been linked with both dopamine (DeYoung, 2013) and serotonin
(Kalbitzer et al., 2009). Similarly, rivalry alternations have been
linked with a number of neurotransmitters, including serotonin
(Carter et al., 2005, 2007), noradrenaline (Einhäuser, Stout, Koch,
& Carter, 2008), and GABA (van Loon et al., 2013).
Little research has specifically investigated the mixed percept
state, however, one recent study (Cao, Zhuang, Kang, & Hong,
Fig. 1. Mix% for different mood manipulation. *p < 0.05. Error bars represent SEM.
Fig. 2. Relation between openness and mix percept following different mood
manipulations (Pleasant, Neutral, Appetitive). To note the increase of mix in the

A. Antinori et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 68 (2017) 15–22
 2016) found that acute alcohol administration lead to an increase
of mixed percept. Interestingly psylocibin— an hallucinogenic
compound structurally similar to serotonin—has also been shown
to increase instances of mixed percept (Carter et al., 2007) and is
known to have has selective, long-lasting effects on trait openness
(MacLean, Johnson, & Griffiths, 2011). Out of curiosity we com-
pared effect sizes reported here with the previously reported
effects of psilocybin on mixed percept (215 mg dose; Carter
et al., 2007). The effect of psilocybin was equivalent to a Cohen’s
d of 0.93 and approximately twice as large as the effects reported
in the current study (i.e., a correlation of r = 0.21 equates to a
Cohens’ d of 0.45). Assuming these effect sizes are reliably esti-
mated, they potentially suggest that the impact of being two stan-
dard deviations above the mean on openness — a normally
distributed personality trait — may be comparable to that of a
direct pharmacological manipulation, with respect to the experi-
ence of mixed percept.
Future research investigating such mechanisms may clarify the
processes underlying both binocular rivalry and openness to expe-
rience. Furthermore, another way future studies may build upon
the current findings is to investigate the relation between open-
ness and mixed percept across multiple rivalry sessions within
each participant. Although rivalry is reported to show high test-
retest stability (Miller et al., 2010), using multiple extended
response trials may help to reduce any impact of noise in the data
and allow for within-subject replication of the present findings,
adding further support to our conclusions. While the primary find-
ings were replicated in a different sample we suspect that the rela-
tions emerged between openness and mixed percept would be
even stronger with rivalry tested in multiple sessions. Future stud-
ies would also benefit from testing more participants, however it is
important to note that the effect sizes reported in the current
paper were close to the average effect size within personality
research for variables not sharing method variance (Richard,
Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003) and within the middle third of effect
sizes in the whole of psychology (Hemphill, 2003).
In conclusion, we provided the first evidence that individuals
reporting greater openness to experience may also have character-
istically different low-level visual perceptual experiences. Given
the apparent similarity between the higher cognitive features of
openness (e.g., divergent thinking) and the lower-level features
revealed in the present research (i.e., mixed percept), it is possible
that common neural processes may be involved.
