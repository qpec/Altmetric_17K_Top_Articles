Abstract
Hypoxia is a poor-prognosis microenvironmental hallmark of solid tumours, but it is unclear how 
it influences the fate of disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in target organs. Here we report that 
hypoxic HNSCC and breast primary tumour microenvironments displayed upregulation of key 
dormancy (NR2F1, DEC2, p27) and hypoxia (GLUT1, HIF1α) genes. Analysis of solitary DTCs 
in PDX and transgenic mice revealed that post-hypoxic DTCs were frequently NR2F1hi/
DEC2hi/p27hi/TGFβ2hi and dormant. NR2F1 and HIF1α were required for p27 induction in post-

 hypoxic dormant DTCs, but these DTCs did not display GLUT1hi expression. Post-hypoxic DTCs 
evaded chemotherapy and, unlike ER− breast cancer cells, post-hypoxic ER+ breast cancer cells 
were more prone to enter NR2F1-dependent dormancy. We propose that primary tumour hypoxic 
microenvironments give rise to a subpopulation of dormant DTCs that evade therapy. These post-
hypoxic dormant DTCs may be the source of disease relapse and poor prognosis associated with 
hypoxia.
Tumour cell heterogeneity is thought to play an important role in the design of successful 
therapies1,2. Primary tumours (PTs) contain proliferating, slow-cycling, quiescent or 
necrotic/apoptotic tumour cells, as well as fast- versus slow-migrating tumour cell 
populations3–6. Genetic and expression profiling has also revealed genetic heterogeneity in 
solitary disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) and metastasis7–9.
PT microenvironments are also heterogeneous in composition10,11, but how DTC phenotypic 
heterogeneity is influenced by PT microenvironments is least understood12. Gene signatures 
obtained from PTs predict for shorter or longer times to metastasis in patient cohorts13,14. 
This suggests that PT gene programs, and possibly influenced by the microenvironment, 
provide information on distinct long-term post-dissemination behaviour (that is, rate of 
relapse). Some PT gene signatures have been linked to late relapse (>5 years) and these were 
associated with EMT or dormancy14,15. We found that breast tumours that are enriched for a 
dormancy signature display longer metastasis-free periods compared with those lacking the 
signature14. Also DTCs from prostate cancer patients in clinical dormancy for 7–18 years 
were enriched for the dormancy signature9, which was also present in a subpopulation of 
prostate cancer DTCs from patients with metastases. Thus, proliferative DTCs and 
metastases can coexist with dormant DTCs9.
Analysis of the dormancy signature9,14,16 revealed genes differentially regulated by 
hypoxia10,17–23, an important solid PT microenvironmental feature, which can induce a 
strong growth arrest24,25. Further, dormant tumour cells were found to upregulate the 
unfolded protein response26–29, which is also activated by hypoxia30–33. We hypothesized 
that if hypoxic PT microenvironments spawn subpopulations of DTCs that were imprinted to 
become dormant, these might escape therapies and fuel incurable metastasis.
Here we show that PT tumour cells exposed to either natural hypoxic microenvironments or 
those induced using hypoxia-induction nanointravital devices (Hi-NANIVIDs) upregulate 
both hypoxia and dormancy genes in a reversible manner. Hypoxia-imprinted DTCs that 
lodged in lungs were more prone to enter an NR2F1-dependent dormant state and evaded 
chemotherapy. Interestingly, post-hypoxic dormant DTCs did not maintain high expression 
of hypoxia markers, arguing for a HIF1α-independent maintenance of the dormant 
phenotype. Further, we found that post-hypoxic ER+ luminal breast cancer cells are more 
prone to enter dormancy than post-hypoxic TNBC cells. Our work uncovers a previously 
unrecognized phenotypic diversity initiated in the primary site by hypoxia and carried over 
by DTCs in target organs. These studies might help explain how hypoxia might contribute to 
therapy resistance through the unanticipated generation of dormant or slow-cycling DTCs.

 RESULTS
Endogenous tumour hypoxia upregulates dormancy markers
We first tested whether dormancy and hypoxia markers were co-expressed in PTs. To 
measure endogenous hypoxia and HIF1α activity we engineered MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells 
to express mCherry fused to the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF1α 
under the control of five HIF response elements (HRE) and a constitutively expressed GFP 
(MDA-MB-231-5HRE-ODD-mCherry/GFP, henceforth MDA-231-HIF reporter cells)34 
(Fig. 1a–c). The MDA-231-HIF reporter cells (RED) showed areas where cells had been 
exposed to hypoxia. In contrast, cells that had not been exposed to significant hypoxia 
expressed only GFP. ODD-mCherry co-localization with GLUT1 in these 
microenvironments further supported that MDA-231-HIF reporter cells had sensed hypoxia 
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1A). Interestingly, DEC2 and NR2F1 (dormancy genes) 
were also significantly upregulated in hypoxic areas of the MDA-231-HIF tumours (Fig. 
1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 1B,C). Quiescent tumour cells were found in naturally 
occurring hypoxic microenvironments because we found that doxycycline (Dox)-treated Tet-
On H2B-GFP T-HEp3 tumours grown in vivo on CAMs for five days displayed 
accumulation of pimonidazole adducts, which occur only in hypoxic cells35,36 (Fig. 1d–f 
and Supplementary Fig. 1D). Analysis of 20 human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) patient samples revealed that within hypoxic, GLUT1high microenvironments 
NR2F1 was more frequently upregulated (Fig. 1g,h). We conclude that tumour cells in 
naturally occurring hypoxic microenvironments upregulate dormancy markers and are slow 
cycling or quiescent.
Nano-device induced hypoxic microenvironments upregulate dormancy markers
Unlike the in vivo results (Fig. 1), experiments in vitro revealed poor correlation between 
DEC2 and NR2F1 messenger RNA expression and varying hypoxia levels (Supplementary 
Fig. 1E). Only NR2F1 expression in breast cancer cell lines showed an upregulation trend in 
two-dimensional cultures in 1% O2, but not in 5% and 10% O2 versus 21%. Thus, 5–10% 
O2 levels do not induce hypoxia or dormancy genes suggesting that an in vivo approach is 
needed to analyse the proposed hypothesis. To this end, we took advantage of the induction 
NANIVID (iNANIVID) (Fig. 2a,b)37. These microfabricated devices consist of two 3 mm × 
1.3 mm glass halves with a lithographically etched chamber that can be loaded with 
hydrogel solutions containing different cargos37. After insertion into tumours, a 150-μm-
wide opening at the side allows a steady flow of compounds from the device, avoiding 
problems associated with pulsatile systemic or local drug delivery38 (Fig. 2a,b). iNANIVIDs 
were loaded with Dox, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or hypoxia-mimetic agent 
desferrioxamine (DFOM) and then implanted in T-HEp3 tumours grown on the chicken 
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model37,39 (Fig. 2b).
We implanted the devices within Tet-On-H2B-GFP-expressing T-HEp3 HNSCC tumours, 
where the H2B-GFP fusion protein is induced by Dox16. This construct provides a marker 
for quiescence due to the extremely slow turnover of the H2B-GFP fusion protein in non-
proliferative cells40. After three days in vivo, only the Dox-iNANIVID tumours showed 
H2B-GFP induction proximal (micrometre range Fig. 2cb) and distal (millimetre range Fig.

 2cc) to the iNANIVID opening (Fig. 2ca and Supplementary Fig. 1F)37. Thus, the device 
supports the efficient release of small molecules and diffusion into the tumour tissue in the 
millimetre range (Fig. 2cc).
We used iNANIVIDs37 loaded with DFOM (1 mM) (refs 41–43) (henceforth Hi-NANIVID) 
to mimic hypoxic microenvironments. Within 4.5 h a gradient is established when using 
EGF or hypoxia-mimetic drugs and chemoattractants37. When T-HEp3 and MDA-231-HIF 
reporter tumours were implanted with Hi- or PBS-NANVIDs (control) (Supplementary Fig. 
2A–D) we found that after three days the gradient is stabilized and that Hi-NANIVID but 
not PBS-NANIVID regions strongly induced the hypoxia biosensor (Fig. 1 and 
Supplementary Fig. 2A–D). Further, the dormancy markers NR2F1 and p27 (ref. 16) and the 
hypoxia genes HIF1α and GLUT1 (ref. 44) were induced in tumours with Hi-NANIVID 
microenvironments (Fig. 2d). Because the device empties within the first 4.5 h (ref. 37), 
gene and protein upregulation were reversible (Fig. 2d) and by day 6 they returned to basal 
levels (Supplementary Fig. 2E–G). While DEC2 mRNA was not elevated in Hi-NANIVID 
microenvironments (Fig. 2d), immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (IF) 
revealed a significant upregulation of DEC2, NR2F1, HIF1α and GLUT1 protein at three 
days (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Fig. 2E). GLUT1 showed membrane localization, while 
HIF1α, NR2F1 and DEC2 showed nucleocytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 2e,f and 
Supplementary Fig. 2E). After six days, no differences in DEC2, NR2F1, HIF1α and 
GLUT1 protein expression were obvious between the DFOM and PBS groups 
(Supplementary Fig. 2D–G), which is probably due to the absence of DFOM and an 
extinction of the hypoxic response. Supplementary Fig. 2H supports this conclusion because 
cells obtained from DFOM Hi-NANIVID microenvironments after six days had 
downregulated the hypoxic response (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2E–G), but restored 
hypoxia gene expression if re-exposed to DFOM (Supplementary Fig. 2H).
Consistent with the induction of the dormancy genes NR2F1, DEC2 and p27, tumour cells 
in Hi-NANIVID microenvironments showed reduced phosphorylation of retinoblastoma 
protein (phospho-Rb, pRb) indicating a G0–G1 arrest16 (Supplementary Fig. 2I). As 
reported previously37,45, the devices and/or their content were not toxic because histologic 
analysis and cleaved caspase-3 (CCL-3—apoptosis marker) levels were very low and similar 
in both PBS and Hi-NANIVID microenvironments (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Figs 2I and 
3A).
Hypoxia and dormancy markers are co-expressed in quiescent tumour cells
We found no upregulation of p27, NR2F1, DEC2 or GLUT1 expression in PBS-NANIVID 
microenvironments (Fig. 3a–c). However, Hi-NANIVID microenvironments displayed 
tumour cells with upregulation of these markers (Figs 2f and 3a–d and Supplementary Fig. 
3B–E). These were also co-expressed in the same tumour cells as significant correlation (r2 
0.70–0.98) was found for upregulation of HIF1α and p27 (Supplementary Fig. 3B–E), 
supporting also that GLUT1high/HIF1αhigh cells are growth arrested. Tumour cells in Hi-
NANIVID microenvironments were also pRblow compared with PBS-NANIVID 
microenvironments (Fig. 3a). Regardless of the microenvironment, DEC2high tumour cells 
were negative for pRb (Fig. 3a,b). Thus, the dormancy markers NR2F1, DEC2 and p27 are

 more commonly upregulated in GLUT1high/HIF1αhigh tumour cells. NR2F1 was shown to 
induce a repressive chromatin state where H3K27me3 marks accumulated in the nucleus of 
dormant NR2F1high cells16. We found that H3K27me3 levels were significantly enriched in 
hypoxic, GLUT1high, but not in normoxic, GLUT1low microenvironments (Fig. 3e,f). 
H3K4me3 levels did not change between GLUT1-positive or -negative cells (Supplementary 
Fig. 3F). Thus, the hypoxic microenvironment induces changes in specific genes and global 
chromatin reorganization. Upregulation of p27 was dependent on NR2F1 and HIF1α 
expression because it was significantly reduced following NR2F1 and HIF1α knockdown 
(Fig. 3g–i and Supplementary Fig. 3G–J). Thus, both NR2F1 and HIF1α may contribute to 
the induction of p27 expression and growth arrest of tumour cells in hypoxic 
microenvironments.
Hypoxia does not affect intravasation or extravasation
We tested the ability of hypoxic cells to intravasate in vivo, using the CAM assay (Fig. 4a–
c)46,47. MDA-231-HIF reporter cells were incubated in 1% or 21% O2 for 72 h prior to 
inoculation on CAMs48 and T-HEp3-GFP cells cultured in 21% O2 served as a positive 
intravasation control39,46 (see Methods). Intravasated T-HEp3-GFP and MDA-231-HIF 
reporter cells were readily detected in the lower CAM (Fig. 4c). Exposure to 1% O2 for three 
days did not significantly change the ability of these cells to intravasate (Fig. 4c). To test 
extravasation potential, T-HEp3-GFP cells were exposed to 21% or 1% O2 for three days 
and then injected i.v. into nude mice. After 24 h lungs were perfused to eliminate the blood 
and circulating tumour cells that did not extravasate and the lung-lodged GFP-positive cells 
were quantified (see Methods for details). The T-HEp3-GFP DTCs overall extravasation 
efficiency was ~0.4% and extravasation efficiency did not differ between post-hypoxic or -
normoxic cells (Fig. 4d).
PT hypoxia increases the frequency of dormant DTCs
We next tested the fate of post-hypoxic DTCs in lungs by using tumour cells isolated from 
Tet-On H2B-GFP T-HEp3 PTs influenced by PBS-or Hi-NANIVID microenvironments and 
treated with Dox to generate H2B-GFP+ nucleosomes. Three-day-old tumours were digested 
and cells were tail vein injected into nude mice that did not receive any Dox, allowing us to 
track the H2B-GFP label-retaining (quiescent) DTCs (Fig. 5a).
Enzymatically digested lungs were used to quantify the number of label-retaining T-HEp3-
H2B-GFP cells (LRCs) (Fig. 5a,b) and then the cell suspensions were cultured with Dox to 
re-induce H2B-GFP and quantify total tumour cells (Fig. 5a–c). The total number of T-HEp3 
cells in lungs five days after injection was similar, regardless of whether they originated 
from a PBS- or Hi-NANIVID microenvironment (Fig. 5c). Post-hypoxic DTCs displayed a 
non-statistically significant trend to increased quiescence at five days post-injection, versus 
DTCs from PBS-NANIVID microenvironments (Fig. 5d). At ten days, cells from PBS-
NANIVID tumours had diluted the label entirely, while label retention in Hi-NANIVID 
DTCs persisted at levels similar to five days (Fig. 5d), suggesting a dormant-like state.
The total number of post-hypoxic lung DTCs was greater at ten days than in the post-
normoxic group (Fig. 5c). However, the number of total post-normoxic cells decreased

 compared with day 5, suggesting some overall attrition of tumour cells that does not occur if 
cells were post-hypoxic (Fig. 5c). That more DTCs were counted in mice that were injected 
with post-hypoxic tumour cells, suggests that the cells that did not enter dormancy, survive, 
colonize more efficiently and/or grow more aggressively (Fig. 5c). The tools we use allowed 
detection of LRCs, but the dynamics of different DTC subpopulations is difficult to estimate. 
Nevertheless, these data suggest that PT hypoxia might induce a heterogeneous population 
of both dormant-like cells and also more efficiently surviving and growing cells.
To further test the connection between hypoxia and DTC quiescence, we used MDA-
MB-231 cells stably expressing an H2B-Dendra2 fluorescent protein (231-H2B-Dendra2). 
The excitation emission of Dendra2 is similar to that of GFP, but following irradiation with 
405 nm light, Dendra2 is stably photoconverted to emit in the red fluorescence wavelength. 
The fusion to H2B allowed for long-term tracking of LRCs. 231-H2B-Dendra2 cells 
cultured in hypoxic and normoxic conditions for three days were photoconverted generating 
>95% of the cells H2B-Dendra2 red (Fig. 5e). These cells were tail vein injected and later 
the lungs were retrieved, digested and the number of green/red or only green LRCs was 
counted (Fig. 5f). The total number of 231-H2B-Dendra2 cells at day 8 post-injection was 
not significantly different between the two groups, although post-hypoxic DTCs trended 
towards less proliferation (Fig. 5g). Nevertheless, already at this time point it was evident 
that hypoxia had induced LRCs, as evidenced by ~80% of post-hypoxic 231-H2B-Dendra2 
cells retaining red H2B-Dendra2 (Fig. 5h). At day 16, we observed a significantly lower 
number of post-hypoxic 231-H2B-Dendra2 cells, compared with post-normoxic DTCs (Fig. 
5g) and ~70% of the former cells at day 16 retained varying levels of H2B-Dendra2-red 
protein (Fig. 5h). Further, post-hypoxic solitary DTCs in lungs one month after i.v. injection 
were more frequently high for p27 expression than post-normoxic DTCs (Fig. 5i,j), 
suggesting that post-hypoxic DTCs are able to maintain a long-lived quiescent phenotype.
Post-hypoxic T-HEp3 cells displayed increased plating efficiency followed by re-
oxygenation, while the MDA-MB-231 cells displayed a slightly lower plating efficiency 
(Supplementary Fig. 3I). While this assay does not account for quiescence, it reliably 
informs on survival and proliferation phenotypes. Our results suggest that hypoxia can 
induce dormancy in a subpopulation of tumour cells that after dissemination may become 
quiescent in target organs (Fig. 5a–j). This correlated with their reduced efficiency in vitro to 
form colonies after hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. 3I). In contrast, T-HEp3 cells displayed a 
heterogeneous response in vivo with a mixture of faster-growing cells and quiescent cells in 
the same target organ (Fig. 5a–d). The enhanced metastatic capacity of post-hypoxic T-HEp3 
cells compared with post-normoxic cells (Fig. 5a–d) may be due to enhanced survival 
detected in plating efficiency experiments in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 3I).
Dormancy phenotypes in post-hypoxic ER+ and ER− breast cancer cells
ER+ luminal breast cancer shows late metastatic relapse14,49. Thus, we tested whether post-
hypoxic ZR-75-1 ER+ luminal breast cancer cells would be more prone to enter a dormancy-
like phenotype than TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells by virtue of carrying a ‘pre-encoded’ 
dormancy signature not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells14. 231-H2B-Dendra2 or ZR-75-1-
H2B-Dendra2 (75-1-H2B-Dendra2) cells grown in either 21% O2 or 1% O2 for three days

 were photoconverted and embedded in 3D Matrigel at low density (150 75-1-H2B-Dendra2 
and 15 231-H2B-Dendra2 cells mm−2) to mimic solitary DTC behaviour and cultured in 
21% O2 for up to 21 days (Fig. 6a). Unlike in vivo, 231-H2B-Dendra2 cells exposed to 
hypoxia or normoxia in vitro were indistinguishable in their ability to generate LRCs (Fig. 
6b). Thus, the in vivo lung microenvironment contributes factors that make this tissue more 
restrictive for post-hypoxic DTCs and reveals a phenotype not detected in vitro (Figs 5f–j 
and 6b). In contrast, post-hypoxic 75-1-H2B-Dendra2 cells showed a significantly higher 
number of LRCs from day 12 that persisted for at least 21 days (Fig. 6c). Following NR2F1 
knockdown, post-hypoxic 75-1-H2B-Dendra2 cells showed a significant loss in label 
retention at day 10, compared with controls (Fig. 6m and Supplementary Fig. 3J). Plating 
efficiency of ZR-75-1 cells after hypoxia was also increased (Supplementary Fig. 3I) 
suggesting that hypoxia-induced quiescence might be coupled to enhanced survival in ER+ 
cells. These data suggest that post-hypoxic ER+ luminal cells might be more prone than ER− 
cells to enter quiescence in an NR2F1-dependent manner. However, in vivo, post-hypoxic 
MDA-MB-231 cells can also enter a dormant-like phenotype in the lungs.
Post-hypoxic DTCs express dormancy but not hypoxia markers and resist chemotherapy
We wondered whether the post-hypoxic dormant-like phenotype depended on active hypoxic 
and/or dormancy programs. T-HEp3 cells originating from PBS or Hi-NANIVID 
microenvironments were delivered i.v. into nude mice. Later the lungs were excised and 
prepared for IF analysis (Fig. 7a). Using IF for human-specific vimentin and dormancy 
markers we tested the expression of NR2F1, DEC2, p27 or GLUT1 in T-HEp3 DTCs in the 
lung (Fig. 7a–f and Supplementary Fig. 4A). Scoring of ~2,000 lung DTCs per antigen 
combination revealed that: solitary post-normoxic DTCs contained a higher proportion of 
NR2F1-, DEC2- and p27-positive cells compared with the PBS-NANIVID PTs (Fig. 7c–f); 
solitary post-hypoxic DTCs and Hi-NANIVID PTs showed a similar percentage of marker-
positive cells (Figs 1f and 7c–f); post-hypoxic DTCs at day 5 contained a large percentage of 
NR2F1-, p27- and DEC2-positive DTCs compared with post-normoxic DTCs (Fig. 7c–e); 
this difference persisted for NR2F1 and p27 at day 10, but was only statistically significant 
for p27 (Fig. 7c,d). The post-normoxic DTCs maintained the same level of GLUT1 
expression as the PTs, while the percentage of GLUT1-positive Hi-NANIVID-primed DTCs 
was slightly reduced compared with the PT levels (Figs 2f and 7f). GLUT1 expression was 
low and not different between Hi- or PBS-NANIVID-primed DTCs, arguing for an 
attenuated hypoxic response.
Interestingly, micrometastases (>5-cell clusters) were detectable only in the post-hypoxic 
group at 10 days after injection (Fig. 7b). Micrometastases had a lower percentage of 
NR2F1-positive cells than post-hypoxic DTCs in the same lung, while not differing 
significantly from post-normoxic DTCs (Fig. 7c). The micrometastases were also less 
positive for p27, except when comparing with post-normoxic DTCs at five days (Fig. 7d). 
The most striking difference was GLUT1 expression (Fig. 7b,f). Only ~30% of solitary 
DTCs expressed GLUT1, independent of their post-normoxic or -hypoxic origin and time in 
lungs, while ~85% of the cells in the micrometastases were GLUT1hi (Fig. 7f), a percentage 
that is even higher than in Hi-NANIVID PTs (Fig. 2f). Only DEC2 expression was equally

 low in percentage of micrometastatic cells and DTCs, both in the PBS- and DFOM-treated 
groups at day 10 (Fig. 7e).
When we tested the levels of the dormancy-inducing cytokine TGFβ2 (ref. 50) in the T-
HEp3 lung DTCs and metastases, we found that DTCs, regardless of their hypoxic state, 
were more frequently positive for intracellular TGFβ2 versus metastases that dramatically 
reduced all detectable TGFβ2 in tumour cells or stroma (Fig. 7g,h). Importantly, Hi-
NANIVID DTCs were more frequently positive for TGFβ2 (Fig. 7g,h).
We next asked whether solitary dormant DTCs could survive chemotherapy. The experiment 
was conducted as in Fig. 5a for ten days post-injection, when we find mostly dormancy-
marker-expressing solitary DTCs in lungs (Figs 5 and 7). However, after seeding in the lung 
mice were treated with vehicle (NaCl 0.9%) or cisplatin at 3.5 mg kg−1 (standard 
chemotherapy for HNSCC) for the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 8a–d). In agreement 
with their non-proliferative state (Figs 5 and 7) we found more single DTCs when these 
were post-hypoxic (Fig. 8b). These DTCs were p27hi (Fig. 7b,d) and non-proliferative, as 
confirmed by the lower frequency of pRb+ DTCs (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Cisplatin caused, 
over this short treatment period, a moderate but still significant reduction in the numbers of 
post-normoxic single DTCs (Fig. 8b), probably because a subpopulation of these cells (45–
50%, see Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 4B) are proliferating. This decrease in single DTC 
numbers was correlated with increased apoptosis (TUNEL staining) after cisplatin treatment 
(Fig. 8c,d). In contrast, post-hypoxic DTCs (from Hi-NANIVID tumours) were unaffected 
by cisplatin (Fig. 8d) and this correlated with lower frequency of pRb+ cells (Supplementary 
Fig. 4B), more p27+ cells (~80%, see Fig. 7d) and no changes in apoptosis (Fig. 8c,d). We 
conclude that non-proliferative DTCs can evade chemotherapy and this escape is more 
pronounced for post-hypoxic DTCs.
Spontaneous non-proliferative lung DTCs display an NR2F1high profile
We next tested whether spontaneously occurring DTCs could upregulate dormancy markers 
with the same kinetics as i.v.-delivered cells. We used the MMTV-PyMT-Dendra2 immune-
competent model (Supplementary Fig. 4C) where tumours developed by injecting PyMT-
Dendra2 cells in the mammary fat pad were photoconverted in vivo (Fig. 8e). This strategy, 
which allowed testing the fate of spontaneously spread tumour cells, revealed that after one 
week the DTCs (CD45negative ruling out phagocytosis of DTCs) showed Dendra2-green 
protein in large intracellular cytosolic bodies (Fig. 8g,h and Supplementary Fig. 4D). We 
confirmed the identity of Dendra2 green or doubly labelled green/red-label-retaining PyMT-
Dendra2 DTCs by photoconversion and ~90% of the DTCs were photoconvertible 
(Supplementary Fig. 4E); in 10% of DTCs, Dendra2 levels were very low hampering 
photoconversion. We found that seven days after photoconversion in the PT, 55% of the lung 
DTCs were red at different degrees, suggesting heterogeneous cycling rates (Fig. 8f,g). The 
dormancy regulator NR2F1 (ref. 16) was downregulated in the PyMT PTs (<1% NR2F1-
positive cells, Supplementary Fig. 4F). However, NR2F1 detection via IF was positive in 
37% of the spontaneous DTCs (Fig. 8f) and in 67% of PyMT-Dendra2 red DTCs, while 33% 
of label-retaining cells were negative for NR2F1 (Fig. 8i). A small proportion of DTCs 
(<1%) did not retain Dendra2 red label but were NR2F1+ and majority of green-only DTCs

 were NR2F1negative (Fig. 8i). NR2F1 expression was more frequent (37%) in DTCs than in 
PT cells (<1%) arguing that NR2F1 is upregulated after dissemination. We conclude that 
spontaneous DTCs can remain in, or quickly enter, an NR2F1high non-proliferative state as 
DTCs in lungs.
DISCUSSION
Our work reveals that hypoxic microenvironments in primary lesions contain subpopulations 
of tumour cells that not only activate a hypoxic response, but also a long-term dormancy-like 
program29 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Once cells disseminated, the expression of dormancy 
markers persisted, but the hypoxic response did not (Supplementary Fig. 5). This suggests 
that the dormancy-like response is more long-lived than the hypoxic program or that another 
hypoxia-responsive pathway not linked to GLUT1 expression is activated concomitantly 
with the dormancy program. The identity of this pathway is unknown, but hypoxia-activated 
p38 (ref. 51) is a likely candidate, as p38 can induce NR2F1 (ref. 16) and HIF1α (ref. 51). 
The dormancy markers NR2F1 and p27 had the longest half-life and p27 was detected as 
long as one month in post-hypoxic DTCs, the equivalent of ~3 years in humans. DEC2 was 
also induced by hypoxia, possibly post-transcriptionally18, but it was marginally expressed 
or absent in proliferative DTCs or tumours, suggesting that it may be an early executor of 
hypoxia-induced dormancy. We also confirmed in immune-competent PyMT-Dendra2 
mice52 that NR2F1+ quiescent DTCs emerge rapidly in lungs. Thus, both PT stress 
microenvironments and the target organ might cooperate to induce a dormant phenotype, as 
previously proposed11 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Post-extravasation DTC dormancy, rather than intravasation and extravasation, was 
significantly induced by hypoxia. We also found post-hypoxic T-HEp3 cells to be more 
frequently TGFβ2high, while growing metastases silenced the TGFβ2 signal (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). TGFβ2 expression is detectable in the lung, a site permissive for metastasis, but that 
also harbours dormant DTCs50. Here, we found TGFβ2 upregulated in specific lung niches 
harbouring dormant DTCs. While additional testing of TGFβ2high niches’ function in the 
lung is needed, awakening of numerous dormant DTCs (TGFβ2high/NR2F1high/p27high) 
might explain why p38α/β (activated by TGFβ2) and TGFβRI inhibitors enhance lung 
metastasis50. It is also possible that dormant DTCs orchestrated TGFβ2hi niches that may 
help drive and maintain dormancy, or that post-hypoxic DTCs may actively home to 
TGFβ2hi niches or fail to disrupt these niches.
NR2F1 holds DTCs in lungs in a dormant state16 and we now show that hypoxia in PTs 
might initiate an NR2F1-, HIF1α- and p27-induced dormancy program. This was also true 
for ER+ breast cancer cells, which show an enrichment for a dormancy signature strongly 
associated with longer time to metastasis14. In malignant cells upregulation of NR2F1 can 
induce remodelling of chromatin into a repressive state16. Our data show that a similar 
reprogramming might be occurring in PT hypoxic microenvironments, as cells that were 
GLUT1high also accumulated abundant H3K27me3 repressive marks in areas of growth 
arrest where HIF1α and p27 were usually co-upregulated (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, the 
PT hypoxia-induced reprogramming might precede and allow for the long-lived nature of 
the dormancy program in DTCs. Our data further suggest that PT hypoxic

 microenvironments induce, even in metastasis-permissive sites such as the lung, a dormancy 
program16,50. The duration of dormancy may be more variable in the lung, given that 
proliferative micro- and macrometastasis lesions appear to coexist with dormant DTCs. 
These data are important because hypoxia-induced dormant-like DTCs survive 
chemotherapy by evading apoptosis, potentially allowing dormant DTCs to reactivate and 
contribute to relapse. Our data are not in disagreement with the findings that hypoxia fuels 
metastasis10,53–55, but rather reveal that hypoxia spawns an additional phenotype where a 
large subpopulation of DTCs may enter dormancy and fuel recurrences by evading therapy.
Using previously unavailable technological advancements, namely the Hi-NANIVID37,38 
and a hypoxia biosensor34, we could induce and monitor spatially defined hypoxic stress 
microenvironments in vivo. The potential of the NANIVID is not limited only to its 
applications in this study. For example, it can be used for direct intravital imaging while the 
tumour area is influenced37. A caveat is that once the device is implanted the experiment 
starts and pulse-chase-like experiments cannot be performed in the same tumour area. 
However, this device is being upgraded to include regulated release systems and its direct 
integration in imaging windows, which will allow monitoring single-cell biology events in 
real time in a reversible manner in the same tumour area37.
Our study shows how hypoxia in PT microenvironments can have a long-lasting influence 
on the fate of DTCs. This suggests that therapies that target such dormancy mechanisms 
might be useful to eliminate quiescent tumour cells during minimal residual disease56, or in 
combination with anti-proliferative therapies, to concomitantly target proliferative and 
quiescent or slow-cycling cells and thus therapeutically address the full heterogeneity of 
disseminated disease.
METHODS
Cell lines
The tumorigenic HEp3 (T-HEp3) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) PDX 
line was derived form a lymph node metastasis of a HNSCC patient, and maintained as 
described previously57. The triple-negative, basal-like MDA-MB-231 and the ER+ luminal-
like ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines were described previously58,59 and acquired from 
ATCC. Cell were routinely checked to exclude mycoplasma contamination. No cell lines 
used in this study were found in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines that is 
maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample. The cell lines were not further authenticated 
after purchase from ATCC. Using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions, these cell lines were stably transfected with different 
reporter proteins (see Supplementary Table 1).
We generated T-HEp3 cells expressing a Histone 2B (H2B)-GFP fusion protein under the 
control of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (Tet-On) system (Tet-On H2B-GFP T-
HEp3). These cells produce the nuclear H2B-GFP tag when in the presence of doxycycline, 
a more stable tetracycline analogue, and are unable to produce this tagged fusion protein in 
the absence of it. Due to the slow turnover of the Histone 2B protein, the GFP tag stays with

 cells for extended time, even if doxycycline is withdrawn; yet any cell division will quickly 
dilute the label down.
We also generated MDA-MB-231 cells expressing both a permanently active GFP and, 
under the control of five hypoxic response elements and an oxygen-dependent degradation 
domain (5HRE-ODD), a red mCherry fluorescent protein (MDA-MB-231-5HRE-ODD-
mCherry-GFP)34. These cells always express the GFP and only in hypoxic conditions also 
express the red mCherry protein, which allows for detection of different oxygenation status.
The MDA-MB-231-H2B-Dendra2 and ZR-75-1-H2B-Dendra2 cells express a fusion protein 
of Histone 2B and the photoswitchable fluorescent protein Dendra2, which can be 
irreversibly switched from green to a highly photostable red emission by near-UV light 
(400–405 nm). We also utilized cell suspensions from the Dendra2 tag in the MMTV 
polyoma middle T (MMTV-PyMT)-driven spontaneous breast cancer model in 
immunocompetent mice. These MMTV-PyMT-Dendra2 tumours express the soluble 
Dendra2 tag in the cytoplasm52. All plasmids also included the KanMX cassette that confers 
kanamycin resistance for clonal selection. Selection of successfully transfected clones 
through addition of G418 to culture medium was started 48 h after transfection.
iNANIVID
The novel induction nano-intravital device (iNANIVID) consists of two microfabricated 
glass halves with an etched chamber that can be loaded with hydrogel solutions containing 
different chemical compounds, which are released over time37. The iNANIVIDs can be used 
in the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to influence the tumour 
microenvironment. We used iNANIVIDs loaded with 10 mM doxycycline (Dox), 1 mM 
desferrioxamine (DFOM, Hi-NANIVID) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, PBS-
NANIVID). DFOM is an iron chelator and has previously been used extensively to mimic 
hypoxia. Iron is needed in the PHD-mediated selective hydroxylation of HIF1α proline 
residues, which initiates proteosomal degradation. By blocking the degradation, DFOM 
leads to HIF1α accumulation within normoxic cells.
Photoconversion
A custom-built 405 nm LED-Array (3A/20V) was constructed for photoconversion of the 
Dendra2-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. Photoconversion of plated cells was carried 
out for 90–120 s, depending on the cell density and visually controlled for >95% 
photoconversion (Figs 5e–h and 6a–c). For the spontaneously disseminated PyMT-Dendra2 
experiment, the skin covering the tumour was incised and temporarily retracted to expose 
the tumour, which was photoconverted for 5 min in vivo (Fig. 8e). On the lung slides, the 
Dendra2-green signal was used to identify the DTCs. Using a Leica DM 5500 B microscope 
(Leica), the cells were imaged before and after 60 s irradiation with the DAPI channel (405 
nm), to photoconvert additional Dendra2-green protein to Dendra2 red (Fig. 8h and 
Supplementary Fig. 4C–E). The change in pixel intensity was measured using the 
Metamorph software (Supplementary Fig. 4C). For red-label-retaining cells, the red pixel 
intensity in arbitrary units after photoconversion was normalized to the value before

 photoconversion. For non-label-retaining cells the absolute value for red pixel intensity in 
arbitrary units is used.
Chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model
The chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model and the serial inoculation of T-HEp3 
tumours have been previously described57. For the CAM xenografts we used premium 
specific pathogen-free (SPF), fertile, 8-day-incubated embryonated chicken eggs supplied by 
Charles River Laboratories. For the Tet-On H2B-GFP T-HEp3 label chase experiment (Fig. 
1d–f), the cells were incubated with 1 μg ml−1 Dox in normal tissue culture conditions. Cells 
(5 × 105) were seeded on CAMs and tumours were grown for five days, without Dox 
treatment. At day 5, 50 μl of pimonidazole (40 mg ml−1, HP1-100Kit, Hypoxyprobe) was 
injected into the embryos and incubated for 4 h. The tumours were excised and immediately 
collagenased. The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and cytospins were prepared and 
stained for pimonidazole adducts (see Supplementary Table 2).
For all iNANIVID inoculation experiments, a layer of minced T-HEp3 tumour was seeded 
inside a sterile Teflon ring on the chorioallantoic membrane. In this ring, on the first layer of 
tumour cells, the iNANIVID was inoculated, as shown in Fig. 2b. Then a second layer of 
minced T-HEp3 tumour was added to cover the iNANIVID completely. The ring kept the 
mass of minced tumour together. Following tumour implantation, the CAMs were incubated 
for 3 and 6 days at 37 °C before the tumour was recovered and the upper left quadrant was 
harvested for further analysis (area of influence, Fig. 2b). The stereoscopic images in Fig. 2c 
and Supplementary Fig. 1F were taken with a Zeiss Lumar V12.0. The intravasation 
experiment has been described previously46. For the experiment (Fig. 4b,c), 106 T-HEp3 
Tet-On-H2B-GFP or MDA-MB-231-5HRE-ODD-mCherry-GFP cells were inoculated on 
the CAM. The CAMs carrying T-HEp3 Tet-On-H2B-GFP cells were treated with 5 μg ml−1 
doxycycline daily to sustain the H2B-GFP expression. Prior to inoculation the MDA-
MB-231-HIF reporter cells were incubated for 72 h in either normoxic (only GFP expressed) 
or hypoxic conditions (to activate the 5HRE-ODD-mCherry red fluorescing protein). After 
48 h, the egg membranes perpendicular opposite to the implantation site (lower CAM) were 
recovered and intravasated cells in the vasculature were detected and quantified. For the 
DFOM diffusion experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2A–D), 5 × 105 MDA-231-HIF reporter 
cells were seeded on recipient CAMs and resulting tumour nodules were harvested 7 days 
later, minced and re-seeded in Teflon rings and implanted with NANIVIDs. After 3 days, 
whole CAMs with tumours were removed from the eggs and mCherry and GFP signals were 
imaged using a LSM 880 Zeiss confocal microscope.
Mouse xenograft models
For tail vein and mammary fat pad injections we used female, 8–10-week-old athymic 
Foxn1 nu/nu mice acquired from Harlan Sprague Dawley. The MMTV-PyMT immune-
competent transgenic mice were female, 10–12 week old and the mouse model as a robust 
model for breast cancer was described previously52. All mouse experiments were conducted 
according to institutionally approved animal protocols (IACUC MSSM: LA11-00017, 
11-0032; Einstein: 20130909). No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size;

 we used empirical methods from past studies. The experiments were not randomized and the 
investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
In the MDA-MB-231-5HRE-ODD-mCherry-GFP xenograft experiments (Fig. 1a–c and 
Supplementary Fig. 1A–C), 2 × 106 cells were subcutaneously injected in the inguinal 
mammary fat pad of athymic Foxn1 nu/nu mice and tumours were harvested at 1.5–2 cm 
diameter and immediately snap frozen for IF staining. For the in vivo extravasation 
experiment (Fig. 4d), stably GFP-expressing T-HEp3 cells were grown in monolayer in 
normoxia (21%O2) or hypoxia (1%O2) for 72 h. Then, 3 × 105 cells in 50 μl PBS were tail 
vein injected in Foxn1 nu/nu mice. Twenty-four hours later mice were euthanized and the 
lungs were flushed with 3 ml ice-cold PBS to exclude blood from the analysis and dissected 
from the animals. Then, one lung of each animal was minced and collagenased for 30 min at 
37 °C. The total lung cell suspension (1 ml) was manually screened for GFP+ cells using a 
direct fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S equipped with an EXFO X-Cite 120 
fluorescence illumination system) and the total cell number per animal was calculated. For 
all tail vein injection experiments, the indicated amounts of pretreated cells suspended in 50 
μl PBS were injected in Foxn1 nu/nu mice and the animals were euthanized using CO2 at the 
designated time points (Figs 5, 7 and 8).
For the in vivo label-retention assays (Fig. 5), the lungs of the mice were flushed with 3 ml 
PBS and one lung was immediately mounted in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura 
Finetek USA), snap frozen and stored it −80 °C until further use. The other lung was minced 
and digested using collagenase-IA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C.
In case of the TET-ON-H2B-GFP T-HEp3 label-retention experiment (Fig. 5a–d), the 
resulting cell suspension was diluted to 10 ml volume and the amount of tagged tumour cells 
(H2B-GFP, Dendra2 green/red) in three 100 μl samples of each animal was manually 
counted using a fluorescence microscope (see above). Using the total number of lung-lodged 
T-HEp3 cells (obtained by re-inducing the TET-ON-H2B-GFP by culturing the total lung 
cell suspension with doxycycline for 16 h) (Fig. 5c), the percentage of label-retaining cells 
was calculated (Fig. 5d).
For the 231-H2B-Dendra2 tail vein experiment (Fig. 5e–h), the lungs were treated as above. 
Following digestion of the lungs, the amount of Dendra2-green cells was counted manually 
as above, followed by assessment of Dendra2-red expression. Using these results, the total 
number of lung-lodged 231-H2B-Dendra2 cells (Dendra2 green, Fig. 5g) and the percentage 
of red-label-retaining cells (Dendra2 green and red, Fig. 5h) were calculated per mouse.
In the chemotherapy experiment (Fig. 8a–d and Supplementary Fig. 4B) we used 3.5 mg 
kg−1 body weight cisplatin (NDC 63323-103-65, Fresenius Kabi) or an equal volume of 
sterile, injection-grade 0.9% NaCl solution for i.p. injection. Mice were weighed every other 
day before injection to account for possible weight loss due to therapy.
For the spontaneous lung DTC experiments we used MMTV-PyMT-Dendra2 mice (Fig. 8e–i 
and Supplementary Fig. 4C–E). The spontaneous, luminal-like mammary tumours carry the 
photoswitchable Dendra2 protein. When the tumours were palpable in the fat pad, they were 
excised, minced and injected in the inguinal mammary fat pad of non-tumour-bearing FVB

 mice, to eliminate the effect of multiple simultaneous tumours. After about 8 weeks, when 
the tumours were 1.5–2 cm in diameter, the whole tumour was photoconverted in vivo for 5 
min using a custom-built 405 nm light-emitting, low-heat diode. This method caused no 
thermal damage to the tissue and the wound was closed over the tumour. Seven days later 
the animals were euthanized and the lungs were snap frozen in O.C.T. for further analysis.
Human samples
All human tumour samples were de-identified and written informed consent was obtained 
from all patients prior to operation. Approval was granted under IRB number HSM no. 
12-00145/GCO no. 12-0366.
Tissue culture experiments
All cells, if not indicated otherwise, were cultured in normoxic (21%O2) or hypoxic (1%O2) 
cell culture conditions. The T-HEp3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM 
medium (Corning Cellgro) with 10% FBS (Sigma, for T-HEp3 and Atlanta Biologicals, for 
MDA-MB-231) and 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco). ZR-75-1 cells were grown in RPMI medium 
(Corning Cellgro) with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep (both the same as for MDA-MB-231). 
The medium of Dendra2-transfected cells was supplemented with G418 (InvivoGen) for 
selection maintenance (MDA-MB-231: 1.0 mg ml−1; ZR-75-1: 0.5 mg ml−1; T-HEp3: 0.4 
mg ml−1).
For the re-exposure to DFOM in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 2H), T-HEp3 cells derived from 
the Hi-NANIVID CAM tumours at day 6 were plated on 8-well chamber slides (20,000 cells 
per well), allowed to attach for 24 h and then treated with PBS or DFOM (90 μM, Sigma-
Aldrich) for 24 h before fixation and staining for GLUT1.
For the plating efficiency assay, MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1 and T-HEp3 cells were cultured 
for 24 h in normoxia or for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h in hypoxia, followed by plating (1,000 cells 
per well) and culture in standard TC conditions. Colonies (clusters of >5 cells) were counted 
at day 8 (see Supplementary Fig. 3I).
Knockdown experiments
The knockdown experiments (Figs 3h,i and 6c and Supplementary Fig. 3G,H,J) were 
conducted in antibiotic-free medium for 24 h, using iPORT NeoFX Transfection Agent 
(Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. NR2F1 (50 nM) and HIF1α 
(20 nM) siRNA, as well as equal amounts of scrambled control siRNA were used, as in our 
previous publication16 and in this paper. See Supplementary Table 4 for further information 
on siRNA.
Matrigel assay
231-H2B-Dendra2, ZR-75-1 H2B-Dendra2 and ZR-75-1 H2B-Dendra2 NR2F1 knockdown 
cells were seeded in Matrigel-coated (50 μl per well) 8-well chamber slides (Fig. 6a–c). 
Medium containing 5% FBS and 2% Matrigel was changed every other day. The fluorescent 
cells in the Matrigel were imaged and scored using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope on the 
indicated days.

 TUNEL assay
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit 
(Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, following slide dewaxation 
and rehydration in xylene and a graded alcohol series, slides were microwaved in 10 mM 
citrate buffer, pH 6.0 for 12 min. TUNEL reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min and 
stopped by washing the slides with 0.3 M NaCl 0.03M Na2C6H6O7. Vimentin staining was 
performed as described above.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Whole RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Following reverse transcription using MMuLV RT (NEB), quantitative qPCR 
for GLUT1, DEC2, NR2F1, p27 and HIF1α was performed as described previously16 using 
Taq DNA polymerase (NEB) in the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-
Rad). GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene. All primers were purchased from IDT. For 
the specific primer sequences see Supplementary Table 3.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) assays
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained using the Vectastain ABC-kit (Vector 
Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. See Supplementary Table 2 for 
complete list of antibodies. Briefly, following slide hydration in xylene and a graded alcohol 
series, slides were microwaved in 10 mM citrate buffer for 12 min for antigen retrieval. 
Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by 3% H2O2. Binding of the primary 
antibody was carried out at 4 ° C overnight, with detection by secondary antibodies at room 
temperature for 1 h. Liquid DAB was used as chromogen (Vector Laboratories).
For IF stainings, paraffin-embedded sections were first de-paraffinized and rehydrated and 
antigen retrieval was conducted as described above; frozen sections were thawed to room 
temperature while covered with PBS. Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton 
X in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Sections were blocked with 3% normal goat serum 
(NGS) in PBS for 60 min at room temperature prior to the first antibody incubation. 
Antibody binding was carried out at 4 °C overnight, followed by washing with PBS (3 × 5 
min) and blocking for 60 min at room temperature. A secondary, fluorescent antibody 
reacting to the primary was applied for 1 h in the dark at room temperature (all: Invitrogen). 
Slides were mounted with Pro-Long Gold with DAPI (Life Technologies). The IF and IHC 
stainings were evaluated using a Leica DM 5500 B microscope with DAPI, GFP, Cy-3 and 
Y5 filter cubes or a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal Laser-microscope (Leica). If not otherwise 
indicated, slides were scored manually by bright-field (IHC) or fluorescence microscopy 
(IF). Total cell numbers per high-power field (40×, 100×, see legend) were counted and the 
percentages of positive or negative cells were calculated.
Scoring using ImageJ and MetaMorph software
The positive area in the MDA-MB-231-HIF reporter xenografts was evaluated using the 
open-source processing software Fiji (ImageJ) (Fig. 1a–c and Supplementary Figs 1A–C, 
2A–D and 3B). The pictures were duplicated; one picture was thresholded to the staining 
appropriate intensities and a binary image was created. The area covered by positive staining

 was quantified in the original file using the binary image as a template. In the xenografts, the 
area covered by the specific antigen was normalized to the expression of mCherry for 
hypoxic areas and GFP for normoxic areas. The histograms were created using Fiji 
(ImageJ). For the diffusion analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2A–D), pixel intensity of the red 
channel in >60 cell clusters was measured at indicated distances from the iNANIVID, as 
indicated above. For the xenografts, 20 high-power fields were scored.
For the scoring of nuclear HIF1α and nuclear p27 in CAM tumour sections (Supplementary 
Fig. 3C–E), the nuclei of T-HEp3 cells in 5–6 different fields per tumour were outlined and 
the integrated fluorescence intensities of the red channel (HIF1α) and from the green 
channel (p27) were quantified using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). For 
HIF1αhigh and p27high nuclear levels we considered values >1.5× the negative control. The 
GLUT1 integrated fluorescence intensity in individual cells on stained CAM tumour 
sections or in tissue culture (Supplementary Fig. 2E,H) was measured using MetaMorph 
software.
Statistics and reproducibility
All statistical analysis was carried out using the GraphPad Prism software version 5.0d. 
Non-parametric Mann–Whitney test or Student’s t-test was used to calculate the significance 
in differences between two groups, Kruskal–Wallis test was used to calculate the difference 
between more than three groups, and Pearson’s correlation was used to correlate staining in 
single cells, as indicated in the figure legends; a P value of <0.05 was considered significant. 
All in vivo (both mouse and CAM) and in vitro experiments were independently repeated 
and included at least three biologically independent samples, as indicated in the legends. All 
IF or IHC stainings were performed in duplicate and accompanied by appropriate isotype 
and negative controls.

days in 21% O2 (normoxia, ‘N’ in j) or 1% O2 (hypoxia, ‘H’ in j) and then tail vein injected. 
After 30 days, lungs were co-stained for p27 and human vimentin (see Supplementary Fig. 
4A). Positive: double positive cells for vimentin (red) and p27 (green); negative: vimentin 
positive cells that were negative for p27. DAPI was used to detect nuclear DNA in all cells. 
Scale bars, 10 μm, n= 3 mice were assessed, representative images are shown. (j) 
Quantification of 30-day MDA-MB-231 DTCs stained for p27 and human vimentin (see Fig. 
5i). Bars show mean ± s.e.m.; n= 3 mice; >100 cells scored per mouse; Mann–Whitney test.

Post-hypoxic breast cancer cells become quiescent in vitro. (a) Illustration of the 
experiment. Triple-negative 231-H2B-Dendra2 and ER+ 75-1-H2B-Dendra2 cells were 
grown as a monolayer for 72 h in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Cells were 
photoconverted (PC), seeded in 8-well chamber slides coated with Matrigel at low densities 
and cultured in normoxia. The green/red label was chased for 21 days. 75-1-H2B-Dendra2 
were also transfected with 50 nM NR2F1 or control siRNA for 24 h during the hypoxia or 
normoxia incubation and followed for 10 days in Matrigel. See Supplementary Fig. 3J for 
knockdown efficiency at 72 h. (b,c) Quantification of red-label-retaining 231-H2B-Dendra2 
and 75-1-H2B-Dendra2 cells, respectively. Bars show mean + s.d. at the indicated days after 
seeding. n = 8 (231-H2B-Dendra2), n = 6 (75-1-H2B-Dendra2), n= 4 (75-1-H2B-Dendra2 
knockdown NR2F1) independent experiments; one-tailed Student’s t-test.

Post-hypoxic DTCs upregulate a dormancy signature. (a) Schematic of the experiment. PBS- 
or Hi-NANIVID T-HEp3 CAM tumours were collagenased after 72 h. Cells (5 × 105) were 
injected in the tail vein of nude mice. After 5 and 10 days, the lungs were retrieved and snap 
frozen for IF staining. (b) Positive and negative single lung DTCs and micrometastatic cells 
stained for human vimentin (red) and NR2F1, p27, DEC2 or GLUT1 (all: green), DAPI 
(blue). Scale bars, 10 μm; n= 12 mice were assessed; representative images are shown. (c–f) 
Quantification of the NR2F1, p27, DEC2 or GLUT1 staining of single DTCs. Blue bars 
indicate cells pretreated with PBS-iNANIVID on the CAM, red bars indicate Hi-NANIVID-

group. Grey bar: cells in PBS-iNANIVID PTs (see Fig. 2e,f). Whiskers: 5th–95th percentile; 
bars: median. n = 2,000 cells pooled form 3 mice per treatment and time point; Mann–
Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis test. (g) TGFβ2-positive and -negative DTCs and periphery 
and centre of a lung micrometastasis. Asterisk: extracellular TGFβ2; arrow: TGFβ2 positive 
DTC. The experimental conditions were the same as in a. Scale bars, 10 μm and 25 μm, 
respectively; n = 12 mice were assessed; representative images are shown. (h) Quantification 
of TGFβ2 staining. Whiskers: 5th–95th percentile; bars show mean. n = 2,000 cells pooled 
from 3 mice per treatment and time point. Kruskal–Wallis and two-tailed Student’s t-test.

Evasion of chemotherapy by post-hypoxic DTCs and NR2F1 induction in spontaneously 
seeded PyMT DTCs. (a) T-HEp3 tumours grew for 3 days on the CAM with PBS- or Hi-
NANIVIDs, as in Fig. 7. Five days after tail vein injection, mice were i.p. injected every 
other day with 3.5 mg kg−1 cisplatin or 0.9% NaCl solution. At ten days post-injection, the 
lungs were collected. (b) Quantification of single DTCs positive for human vimentin per 
HPF (×40) in the lungs of cisplatin- and control-treated nude mice at day 10. Bars: mean + 
s.e.m.; n = 21 HPFs pooled from 3 (PBS ctrl) or 4 (all other) mice; one-tailed Student’s t-
test. (c) T-HEp3 DTCs in cisplatin-treated mouse lungs at day 10, stained for TUNEL 
(green), human vimentin (red) and DAPI (blue). Arrows: negative and positive cell for 
TUNEL. Scale bars, 10 μm, n= 12 mice were assessed; representative images are shown. (d) 
Quantification of TUNEL staining. Bars: mean + s.e.m., n = 3 mice per treatment, 50 DTCs 
scored per mouse; one-tailed Student’s t-test. See Supplementary Fig. 4B for pRb staining of 
single DTCs. (e) Non-tumour bearing FVB mice were injected in the mammary fat with 
cells from spontaneous MMTV-PyMT-Dendra2 transgenic primary tumours. Tumours were 
photoconverted in vivo for 5 min. Lungs were retrieved 7 days later. See also Supplementary 
Fig. 4C,D. (f) Dendra2-green signal identified spontaneous DTCs in the lungs. Fifty-five per 
cent of the DTCs were label-retaining cells (LRCs) and 37% were positive for NR2F1. n = 
187 spontaneous DTCs pooled from 3 mice. Bars, mean + s.d. (g) NR2F1 staining of PyMT-
