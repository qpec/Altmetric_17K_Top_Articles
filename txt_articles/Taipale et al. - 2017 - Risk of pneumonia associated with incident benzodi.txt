A
lzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia, 
accounting for 60%–70% of all cases.1,2 In 2011, there 
were 35.6 million people with dementia globally, and the 
number is estimated to double every 20 years. Aging is the major 
risk factor for Alzheimer disease; thus, population aging is leading 
to major public health challenges related to dementia disorders. 
Dementia and Alzheimer disease result in frequent health care 
service utilization and substantial health care costs.3 Current drug 
therapy for Alzheimer disease has only modest efficacy.4 Behav-
ioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are frequent5,6 
and often treated with psychotropic drugs,7 although these symp-
toms are not approved indications for most of these drugs. Use of 
benzodiazepines and similarly acting non-benzodiazepines (Z-drugs) 
is frequent among those with Alzheimer disease, and many patients 
use these drugs long term,8 although clinical care guidelines recom-
mend only short-term use.5,6
Incidence of pneumonia increases with age.9 Pneumonia is fre-
quent and one of the leading causes of admission to hospital among 
adults with Alzheimer disease.10 Other risk factors include female 
sex, smoking, alcohol abuse, respiratory diseases and many other

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Knowledge regarding 
whether benzodiazepines and similarly 
acting non-benzodiazepines (Z-drugs) 
are associated with an increased risk of 
pneumonia among older adults is lack-
ing. We sought to investigate this associ-
ation among community-dwelling 
adults with Alzheimer disease, a condi-
tion in which both sedative/hypnotic 
use and pneumonia are common.
METHODS: We obtained data on all com-
munity-dwelling adults with a recent 
diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in Fin-
land (2005–2011) from the Medication 
use and Alzheimer disease (MEDALZ) 
cohort, which incorporates national reg-
istry data on prescriptions, reimburse-
ment, hospital discharges and causes of 
death. Incident users of benzodiazepines 
and Z-drugs were identified using a 
1-year washout period and matched 
with nonusers using propensity scores. 
The association with hospital admission 
or death due to pneumonia was ana-
lyzed with the Cox proportional hazards 
model and adjusted for use of other psy-
chotropic drugs in a time-dependent 
manner.
RESULTS: Among 49 484 eligible partici-
pants with Alzheimer disease, 5232 tak-
ing benzodiazepines and 3269 taking 
Z-drugs were matched 1:1 with those 
not taking these drugs. Collectively, use 
of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs was 
associated with an increased risk of 
pneumonia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 
1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–
1.42). When analyzed separately, benzo-
diazepine use was significantly associ-
ated with an increased risk of 
pneumonia (adjusted HR 1.28, 95% CI 
1.07–1.54), whereas Z-drug use was not 
(adjusted HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.84–1.44). 
The risk of pneumonia was greatest 
within the first 30 days of benzodiaze-
pine use (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.26–3.48).
INTERPRETATION: Benzodiazepine use 
was associated with an increased risk of 
pneumonia among patients with 
Alzheimer disease. Risk of pneumonia 
should be considered when weighing 
the benefits and risks of benzodiaze-
pines in this population.

comorbidities.11 Dementia is also a risk factor for pneumonia-related 
death.12,13 Thus, it is important to recognize factors that increase the 
risk of pneumonia. Benzodiazepines are known to induce sedation, 
and more pronounced sedative effects are noticed among older 
adults because of pharmacodynamic changes.14 Sedation may lead 
to pneumonia by increased risk of aspiration.15
A nested case–control study in the United Kingdom evaluated 
benzodiazepine use and occurrence of pneumonia in people of 
all ages and found a 50% increased risk of pneumonia.16 How-
ever, another case–control study in the United States among 
older adults did not find an association between benzodiazepine 
use and pneumonia but reported an increased risk for opioid 
use.17 A recent population-based cohort study on benzodiaze-
pine use found that it also was associated with adverse respira-
tory outcomes among older adults with chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD).18
Our objective was to investigate whether benzodiazepine and 
Z-drug use is associated with risk of pneumonia among commu-
nity-dwelling adults with a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.
Methods
Setting
The Medication use and Alzheimer disease (MEDALZ) cohort 
included all community-dwelling adults with a diagnosis of 
Alzheimer disease (n = 70 718) between 2005 and 2011 in Fin-
land.19 These participants were identified from the Special Reim-
bursement Register (maintained by the Social Insurance Institu-
tion of Finland) that includes people with a diagnosis of chronic 
disease according to a predefined protocol. The protocol for 
Alzheimer disease includes a computed tomography or magnetic 
resonance imaging scan and confirmation of the diagnosis by a 
neurologist or geriatrician. The Social Insurance Institution of 
Finland, which grants special reimbursement, ensures that diag-
nostic criteria are met. Diagnosis was based on criteria from the 
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders 
and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders 
Association (NINCDS-ADRDA)20 and DSM-IV (Diagnostic and statis-
tical manual of mental disorders. 4th ed. Washington: American 
Psychiatric Association; 1994).
Data sources
Data for the cohort were collected from several nationwide regis-
ters in Finland: Prescription Register (for drug use, 1995–2012), 
Special Reimbursement Register (for comorbidities, 1972–2012) 
and Hospital Discharge Register (for pneumonia diagnoses and 
comorbidities, 1972–2012); and socioeconomic data since 1970 
and causes of death (2005–2012) from Statistics Finland. The Pre-
scription Register includes information on purchases of reim-
bursed drugs that are classified according to the Anatomic Ther-
apeutic Chemical classification system.21 Some small packages 
(i.e., 10–30 tablets) of benzodiazepines and related drugs are not 
reimbursed; therefore, they are not captured in the database.
However, reimbursement status is a strong driver of prescribing, 
because drugs without reimbursement status are more expen-
sive. Data on drug use were restricted to community-dwelling 
patients; drugs used during stays in hospital and public nursing 
homes are not recorded in the register.
Study design and participants
We modelled when drug use started and ended (i.e., drug use 
period) with a previously used method (Prescriptions to drug use 
periods, PRE2DUP).8,22 We based our model on sliding averages of 
daily dose, and we modelled each Anatomic Therapeutic Chemi-
cal classification system code separately for each participant 
according to purchase regularity, taking into account admissions 
to hospital, stockpiling of drugs and changing dose as described 
previously.8,22
We defined use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs by the follow-
ing Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical classification system codes: 
N05BA and N05CD for benzodiazepines and N05CF for Z-drugs. 
Benzodiazepines prescribed in this study included diazepam, 
nitrazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, oxazepam, alprazolam, 
lorazepam and temazepam, whereas Z-drugs included zopiclone 
and zolpidem. We modelled use of benzodiazepine and Z-drugs 
as “use of any of these drugs” by combining overlapping use 
periods of different drugs. Thus, patients were allowed to change 
from one drug to another if there were no breaks in drug avail-
ability. Similarly, we combined overlapping drug use periods 
when we modelled use of “any benzodiazepine” or “any Z-drug.”
We identified diagnoses of pneumonia from the Hospital Dis-
charge and Causes of Death Registers, which represent hospital-
treated pneumonia and pneumonia as a direct or underlying 
cause of death but excludes community-treated cases (not 
included in register-based data). We used the following ICD-10 
(International Classifications of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, 10th rev, World Health Organization, 1992) codes to 
define a diagnosis of pneumonia: J100, J110, J12, J13, J14, J15, 
J16, J18 and J690. Only the first recorded outcome (hospitaliza-
tion or death due to pneumonia) for each person was considered 
after the date of the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.
We excluded participants who were taking benzodiazepines 
or Z-drugs during the 1-year washout period before the date of 
diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, those who had more than 182 
cumulative days in hospital and those who were in hospital for 
more than 90 days at the end of the washout period from all 
analyses. We also excluded participants who were in hospital or 
an institution during the entire follow-up period (Figure 1).
Statistical analysis
We conducted propensity score–matched analyses to compare 
participants who used benzodiazepines and Z-drugs with those 
who did not. Time since diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is a key 
factor that affects initiation of both benzodiazepines and 
Z-drugs, and risk of pneumonia. For this reason, we divided the 
follow-up time for the initiation of drug use into 3 sets by time 
passed since diagnosis: 0 to less than 1 year, 1 to less than 
2 years and 2 or more years. We used logistic regression to derive 
1 propensity score to predict initiation of benzodiazepine and 
another score to predict initiation of Z-drug within the prespeci-
fied time sets because initiators of these drugs may differ from 
each other in baseline covariates (Figure 2). Participants not tak-

ing these drugs were included in all time sets if censoring or an 
outcome event had not occurred before the start of the time set. 
More than 40 covariates (e.g., factors related to mental health 
that were strongly associated with use of benzodiazepines and 
Z-drugs, and markers of exacerbations of respiratory diseases) 
were included in the scores and measured before or at the start 
of the time sets. Descriptions of covariates are listed in Table 1, 
Table 2 and Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160126/-/DC1). 
Based on the estimated propensity scores, we conducted 1:1 
nearest neighbour matching without replacement using 0.2 as a 
caliper width within the time sets, starting with those partici-
pants initiating use 2 or more years since the date of diagnosis.23 
We obtained 6 sets of matches that were merged together to 
form the matched study population, which excluded 44 partici-
pants who started benzodiazepines and 43 participants who 
started Z-drugs because they did not have a match. We evalu-
ated similarity of matched patients taking these drugs and those

not taking them using standardized difference, and we consid-
ered values greater than 10% to indicate meaningful imbalance 
between the groups.24
We defined the index date as the start date of the time set 
when participants were matched with those not using the drugs 
(i.e., date of diagnosis, 1 yr after diagnosis or 2 yr after diagnosis). 
Follow-up for outcome events started at the index date for par-
ticipants not using the drugs and at the initiation of use for those 
using the drugs. The follow-up ended when the participant was 
admitted to hospital or an institution for more than 90 days, 
upon death, discontinuation of use of benzodiazepines and 
Z-drugs, upon a switch between or concomitant use of benzodi-
azepines and Z-drugs, outcome of interest (pneumonia) or the 
end of study follow-up (Dec. 31, 2012), whichever occurred first. 
We evaluated the effect of incident benzodiazepine use on 
risk of pneumonia using a Cox proportional hazards model, tak-
ing into account matching between those participants taking 
benzodiazepines and those not taking them. We also analyzed 
how the risk of pneumonia varied by length of benzodiazepine 
and Z-drug use by using a time-dependent classification of dura-
tion of use — 30 days or less, 31 to 180 days, 181 to 365 days, 366 
to 1095 days and more than 1095 days of use — and adding it as a 
time-dependent covariate in the main model. 
To minimize the impact of other psychotropic drugs (antipsychot-
ics, antidepressants and opioids) on the risk of pneumonia, we con-
structed a model with use of psychotropic drugs as a time-depen-
dent covariate (instead of use at the index date). We conducted 
drug-substance–specific and higher versus lower dose analyses 
among those participants who initiated with monotherapy (n = 8382). 
We performed secondary analyses by treating death due to 
causes other than pneumonia and a hospital stay of more than 
90 days as competing risks for pneumonia in cause-specific haz-
ards models.25 In this method, we considered competing risks 
that prevent occurrence of pneumonia as censoring events.

Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) for both pneumonia and com-
peting events were modelled separately, by applying the main 
Cox model for the event of interest and censoring all other 
observations. Proportional hazards assumptions were met for 
all the models. All the analyses were restricted to the first 
1500 days of follow-up because of sparse data.
We performed all statistical analyses using SAS statistical soft-
ware, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.).
Data were de-identified before submission to the research 
team and, by Finnish law, no ethics committee approval was 
required.
Results
After applying exclusion criteria, we included 49 484 participants 
(mean age 80 [SD 7] yr, 62.7% were women; Figure 1) in our 
study cohort. From this cohort, we matched 5232 participants 
taking benzodiazepines (Table 1) and 3269 taking Z-drugs 
(Table 2) with those not taking these drugs. After propensity 
score matching, we found no significant differences for those 
taking the drugs and those who were not in terms of comorbidi-
ties included. The median follow-up time for participants taking 
benzodiazepines was 134 (interquartile range [IQR] 
85–422) days and 638 (IQR 306–1095) days for those not taking 
benzodiazepines. Corresponding values for participants taking 
or not taking Z-drugs were 100 (IQR 39–295) and 683 (IQR 366–
1145) days, respectively.
During the period of benzodiazepine and Z-drug use, 8.10 
pneumonias per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 
8.03–8.16) were diagnosed (Table 3). Use of benzodiazepines and 
Z-drugs was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia 
among participants with Alzheimer disease (adjusted HR 1.22, 
95% CI 1.05–1.42) (Table 3). Benzodiazepine use was associated 
with a increased risk of pneumonia (adjusted HR 1.28, 95% CI 
1.07–1.54), whereas use of Z-drugs was not (adjusted HR 1.10, 
95% CI 0.84–1.44).

We found results similar to the main analysis for time-dependent 
adjustment of other psychotropic drugs (Table 3). Among those par-
ticpants taking benzodiazepines, the increased risk was only 
observed at the start of use (first 30 d, HR 2.09 [95% CI 1.26–3.48]). 
To further explore possible prevalent user bias, we conducted addi-
tional analyses separately categorizing those participants with the 
shortest duration of use (≤ 7 d). We found that the risk of pneumonia 
among participants taking benzodiazepines was attenuated and no 
longer statistically significant for the first 7 days of use (adjusted HR 
1.83, 95% CI 0.68–4.96) but was still significant between 8 and 
30 days of use (adjusted HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.14–3.75). Risk of pneumo-
nia was not affected by type of drug, and higher doses were associ-
ated with a larger HR than lower doses; however, in both cases, CIs 
were wide, which limited our conclusions (Appendix 2, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160126/-/DC1).
In the secondary analyses, participants taking benzodiaze-
pine and Z-drugs had an increased risk of death due to other 
causes and stays in hospital of more than 90 days (HR 1.13, 95% 
CI 1.03–1.25) (Table 4).
Interpretation
Use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs was associated with an 
increased risk of pneumonia among patients with Alzheimer dis-
ease. The risk was highest at the start of treatment, and benzodiaz-
epine use was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia, 
whereas the association with Z-drug use did not reach significance. 
However, the results are not sufficient to support a conclusion that 
Z-drugs would be safer than benzodiazepines for patients with 
Alzheimer disease, because our study was not designed for a direct

comparison of the these groups. Furthermore, differing physician 
attitudes toward benzodiazepine and Z-drug prescribing26 would 
complicate comparisons between drug groups. Both drugs have 
similar mechanisms of action and adverse effects,27 which often are 
pronounced in older patients because of age-related changes in 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.14,28,29 Benzodiazepines 
and Z-drugs have prolonged elimination half-lives in older patients, 
which may lead to accumulation of the drug. 
One possible explanation for the increased risk of pneumonia 
associated with benzodiazepine use may be related to the more 
pronounced sedative effects of these drugs in this population. 
Sedation may increase risk of aspiration,15 which may lead to 
pneumonia. In addition, sedation is more pronounced at the 
start of use before tolerance develops. This supports the results 
of duration of use indicating that the higher risk is only at the 
start of drug use.
An increased risk of pneumonia is an important finding to con-
sider in treatment of patients with Alzheimer disease. Benzodiaze-
pines and Z-drugs are frequently prescribed for this population, and 
long-term use is typical.8,30 Pneumonia often leads to admission to 
hospital,10 and patients with dementia are at increased risk of death 
related to pneumonia.12,13 Although our findings need further 
research and confirmation, the increased risk of pneumonia should 
be considered when benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are prescribed to 
older adults with Alzheimer disease.
Our results concur with a large case–control study on benzo-
diazepine use and pneumonia in the United Kingdom that 
reported a 50% increase in the risk among patients of all ages.16 
In our study, benzodiazepine use was associated with a 30% 
increased risk of pneumonia. Another smaller case–control study 
found no association between benzodiazepine use and pneumo-
nia among older adults, which may have been related to the 
small sample size for this study.17
Some researchers have suggested that benzodiazepines and 
Z-drugs may suppress the immune system and consequently 
induce adverse respiratory effects.17,31 In 2014, a population-
based cohort study in Ontario reported that benzodiazepine 
use was associated with respiratory exacerbations and visits to

the emergency department for COPD or pneumonia among 
older adults with COPD.18 A study involving a cohort of patients 
with asthma in the UK showed increased odds of exacerbations 
and death among those patients taking benzodiazepines.31
Limitations
We investigated the association of benzodiazepine and Z-drug 
use with a diagnosis of pneumonia in a large nationwide cohort 
that included patients with a clinically verified diagnosis of 
Alzheimer disease. For this reason, our results are generalizable 
to community-dwelling older adults with Alzheimer disease. We 
restricted analyses to incident use because prevalent users are 
more likely to have developed tolerance to drug effects. We also 
restricted the analyses to incident pneumonia cases to exclude 
the possibility of multiple admissions to hospital because of the 
same occurrence of pneumonia. With propensity-score matched 
design and by taking into account time-since-diagnosis, we were 
able to control for the main measured confounders. However, as 
in all observational studies, unmeasured confounders may still 
exist. For example, register-based data lack information on 
smoking, which is a predictor of pneumonia.32 The covariates we 
selected (e.g., psychotropic drug use, asthma/COPD, previous 
pneumonia, lower socioeconomic status and history of sub-
stance abuse) likely captured some of the variation in smoking 
status. We also conducted analyses to reduce the impact of other 
psychotropic drugs on risk of pneumonia by adjusting for their 
time-dependent use.
The participants in our study were either admitted to hospital 
with pneumonia or died of pneumonia. We did not include cases of 
pneumonia treated through home care. Therefore, our results rep-
resent the most severe infections. The limitations also include lack 
of information on indications for drug use (including presence and 
severity of behavioural symptoms) and severity of Alzheimer dis-
ease, both of which may affect the start of drug use and incidence 
of pneumonia. We controlled for time-since-diagnosis as a crude 
measure of severity.
Drug use was based on data recorded in the Prescription Reg-
ister in Finland. Benzodiazepine use based on data from the Pre-
scription Register was previously validated in a population-
based intervention study.33 Our study may underestimate 
benzodiazepine use, because smaller packages of these drugs 
were not reimbursed. We used a mathematical modelling 
method (PRE2DUP) to construct drug-use periods.22 This allowed 
us to use time-dependent exposure in our analyses.
Conclusion
Benzodiazepine use was associated with a 30% increase in the rela-
tive risk of pneumonia among patients with Alzheimer disease com-
pared with patients not using the drug. Benefits and risks of the use 
of benzodiazepines should be carefully considered for patients with 
Alzheimer disease and include risk of pneumonia. Accumulating evi-
dence that use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs is associated 
with respiratory adverse effects suggests that future studies 
examine the possible pharmacologic mechanisms.
