Background: Patients successfully resuscitated by paramedics 
from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest often have severe neurologic injury. 
Laboratory and observational clinical reports have suggested that induction 
of therapeutic hypothermia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
may improve neurologic outcomes. One technique for induction of mild 
therapeutic hypothermia during CPR is a rapid infusion of large-volume cold 
crystalloid fluid.
Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial we assigned 
adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest undergoing CPR to either a rapid 
intravenous infusion of up to 2 L of cold saline or standard care. The 
primary outcome measure was survival at hospital discharge; secondary 
end points included return of a spontaneous circulation. The trial was 
closed early (at 48% recruitment target) due to changes in temperature 
management at major receiving hospitals.
results: A total of 1198 patients were assigned to either therapeutic 
hypothermia during CPR (618 patients) or standard prehospital care 
(580 patients). Patients allocated to therapeutic hypothermia received 
a mean (SD) of 1193 (647)  mL cold saline. For patients with an initial 
shockable cardiac rhythm, there was a decrease in the rate of return of 
a spontaneous circulation in patients who received cold saline compared 
with standard care (41.2% compared with 50.6%, P=0.03). Overall 10.2% 
of patients allocated to therapeutic hypothermia during CPR were alive 
at hospital discharge compared with 11.4% who received standard care 
(P=0.71).
conclusions: In adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, induction 
of mild therapeutic hypothermia using a rapid infusion of large-volume, 
intravenous cold saline during CPR may decrease the rate of return of a 
spontaneous circulation in patients with an initial shockable rhythm and 
produced no trend toward improved outcomes at hospital discharge.

s
udden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a 
common public health problem that affects ap-
proximately 360 
000 patients per year in the Unit-
ed States.1 Although approximately half of patients re-
ceive an attempted resuscitation, only one-third of these 
achieve a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)2 and 
survival with good neurologic recovery is poor (≈6%).3 A 
major contributing cause of death or prolonged disability 
is hypoxic-ischemic neurologic injury.4
One treatment for the neurologic injury in OHCA pa-
tients is therapeutic hypothermia.5 This is based on the 
findings of 2 clinical trials in which a temperature of 32°C 
to 34°C induced after hospital admission and maintained 
for 12 to 24 hours was compared with no temperature 
control.6,7 More recently, a study comparing induction 
of therapeutic hypothermia (33°C) with temperature con-
trolled at 36°C for the first 24 hours after intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission found no difference in outcomes.8 
Other studies examining the efficacy of earlier induction 
of therapeutic hypothermia using bolus, large volume, 
cold saline during transport to hospital also did not show 
improved outcomes.9–11
However, laboratory and preliminary clinical studies 
have suggested that therapeutic hypothermia may be 
most effective when induced during cardiopulmonary re-
suscitation (CPR) rather than delayed until after ROSC.12 
Intra-arrest induction of therapeutic hypothermia by para-
medics is feasible using a rapid intravenous (IV) infusion 
of large-volume (30mL/kg), cold saline during CPR.13–16 
We therefore conducted a multicenter, randomized, con-
trolled trial in which induction of therapeutic hypothermia 
during CPR in OHCA patients using a rapid IV infusion 
of large-volume (30mL/kg), cold saline was compared 
with standard care to assess whether this treatment im-
proved outcomes. All treatments, including temperature 
management, after hospital arrival were at the discretion 
of the treating physicians.
MethODs
study setting
The study was conducted by the emergency medical ser-
vices (EMS) of 3 cities in Australia (Melbourne, Adelaide, 
and Perth). The total population served by these EMS is 
approximately 7 million. These EMS have clinical practice 
guidelines that follow the recommendations of the Australian 
Resuscitation Council for the treatment of OHCA patients 
(available at www.resus.org.au). In Melbourne and Adelaide, 
the EMS is 2-tier with advanced-life support paramedics able 
to defibrillate, insert a laryngeal mask airway, and administer 
intravenous epinephrine. In addition, there are intensive care 
paramedics who are authorized to insert an endotracheal 
tube, administer intravenous (IV) amiodarone for ventricular 
fibrillation/tachycardia that is refractory to defibrillation, and 
administer an IV infusion of epinephrine for post-ROSC hypo-
tension. In Melbourne, defibrillation also may be undertaken 
by firefighter first responders who are dispatched with EMS. 
Intensive care paramedics in Melbourne also have clinical 
practice guidelines for the administration of IV furosemide 
for the treatment of suspected pulmonary edema, and the 
administration of IV sedation and a muscle relaxant to main-
tain endotracheal intubation. In Perth, the EMS is single tier, 
with all paramedics able to defibrillate, insert an laryngeal 
mask airway, intubate, and administer IV epinephrine and 
amiodarone during CPR.
For this study, paramedics carried 2 L of normal saline 
in an insulated container that maintained the temperature of 
the saline at approximately 3°C using a chilled ice block that 
was changed every 12 hours or in a refrigerator fitted to the 
vehicle.
study Patients
The trial protocol has been published previously.17 Patients 
in OHCA initially were evaluated by paramedics for signs 
of obvious death in which case resuscitation was withheld. 
Patients who had resuscitation commenced were eligible for 
enrollment in the study if they were adults (≥18 years of 
age), were in cardiac arrest on EMS arrival, had IV access 
established, and were still in cardiac arrest after the initial 
resuscitation treatments. Patients were excluded if they 
were in cardiac arrest as a result of trauma (including hang-
ing), suspected of intracranial bleeding, females who were 
known or suspected to be pregnant, already hypothermic 
(<34.5°C), or inpatients in a hospital. Patients with known 
advanced directives documenting limitations in resuscitation 
also were excluded.
randomization and intervention
All patients had routine initial resuscitation treatment, 
including 
defibrillation 
for 
shockable 
rhythm, 
intrave-
nous cannulation, administration of an initial dose of epi-
nephrine and ventilation with 100% oxygen. If the patient 
remained in cardiac arrest after these procedures were 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• In patients allocated to induction of therapeutic 
hypothermia using bolus large-volume, intravenous 
cold saline during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 
we found a decrease in the rate of return of sponta-
neous circulation in patients with an initial shockable 
rhythm.
• Overall, we found no difference in outcomes at hos-
pital discharge.
What are the clinical implications?
• Although the trial was stopped early, our data sug-
gest induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia 
using a rapid infusion of large-volume intravenous 
cold saline during cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
may cause harm in the subset of out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest patients who present with shockable 
rhythm.

undertaken, an opaque envelope containing computer-
generated random treatment allocation was opened. 
Patients then received either a rapid infusion of 30mL/kg 
 
cold saline (maximum 2 L) via a peripheral intravenous can-
nula, or continued standard care. The cold saline infusion was 
ceased if the tympanic temperature reached 33°C or if pulmo-
nary edema was suspected (as indicated by the appearance 
of froth in the endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway).
Patients without shockable rhythm at any time who were 
in asystole after 30 minutes of resuscitation had cessation of 
resuscitation attempts and were not transported to the hospi-
tal. In some patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation or 
pulseless electric activity, transport to the hospital with CPR in 
progress was undertaken.
Patients with ROSC were transported to the nearest hos-
pital with an emergency department and an ICU. At the time 
of commencement of the study, the standard care at most 
receiving hospitals for post cardiac arrest patients included 
thrombolysis or cardiac catheterization for ST-elevation myo-
cardial infarction and a targeted temperature of 33°C in the 
ICU for the first 24 hours.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was survival at hospital dis-
charge. Secondary outcome measures were the proportion of 
patients in shockable and nonshockable rhythms with ROSC, 
tympanic temperature in patients who arrived with ROSC at 
hospital, and discharge direction from hospital (directly to 
home, to a rehabilitation facility, to a nursing care facility, or 
deceased at hospital discharge).
statistical analysis
The target sample size was calculated using data from the 
Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR).2 This 
Registry has data showing that patients who are in shockable 
rhythm on arrival of paramedics have a 40% rate of ROSC, and 
of these, 50% survive to hospital discharge, giving an overall 
survival rate of 20%. It was proposed that a rapid infusion of 
large-volume, cold IV saline would increase the rate of ROSC 
from 40% to 45%, and that very early therapeutic hypothermia 
would decrease neurologic injury and increase survival post 
ROSC from 50% to 60%, giving an overall survival rate of 27%.

With 80% power and a type 1 error of 0.05, the study required 
a sample size of 603 patients with an initial shockable rhythm 
in each arm (1206 in total).
Data from the VACAR also suggested that patients with 
an initial nonshockable rhythm represent 50% of patients 
with OHCA in whom resuscitation is commenced. These 
patients have a ROSC rate of 20% and, of these, 10% sur-
vive to hospital discharge, giving an overall survival rate of 
2%. To demonstrate improved outcomes to 5% (an absolute 
difference of 3%) required 653 per group, a total of 1306 
patients. Overall, the sample size of this study was planned 
to be 2512 patients. Data analysis was performed indepen-
dently by a statistician who was blinded to the treatment allo-
cation. Analysis of the primary outcome of survival to hospital 
discharge was performed using the χ2 test. Additional bino-
mial variables were expressed as proportions and 95% con-
fidence intervals and groups compared by χ2 tests or Fisher 
exact test. Variables that approximate a normal distribution 
were summarized as mean±standard deviation, and groups 
compared using t tests. Other continuous or ordinally scaled 
variables were summarized as median±interquartile range, 
and groups compared using Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests. 
In a post hoc analysis of patients with a shockable rhythm, 
the impact of total fluid volume was examined using logistic 
regression. A standard score was calculated as the differ-
ence between the observed fluid volume and the mean fluid 
volume received divided by the standard deviation such that 
a 1 U increase corresponded to an increase in fluid volume 
of 1 standard deviation. All reported P values were 2-sided. 
The statistical software used was STATA (version 13.0, Stata 
Corporation, College Station, TX). The study analysis followed 
intention-to-treat methodology.
The study was stopped prior to the first planned interim 
analysis by the RINSE study (Rapid Infusion of Cold Normal 
Saline) Management Committee because a number of the 
receiving hospitals were changing their temperature manage-
ment target in post cardiac arrest patients from 33°C to 36°C 
after publication of the Targeted Temperature Management 
trial.8
ethics
The study was approved in each city by a Human Research 
Ethics Committee that provides oversight of the EMS and 
included waiver of informed consent. This approach is con-
sistent with Australian National Health and Medical Research 
Council National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human 
Research (2007; see https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-
publications/e72). Information concerning the study was pro-
vided to surviving patients or next-of-kin by mail about 3 months 
after enrollment. Surviving patients or their next-of-kin could 
request that the patient’s data not be included in the study.
resUlts
Patients and interventions
The study was conducted between December 2010 
and December 2014. The overall numbers of patients 
in cardiac arrest and who had resuscitation commenced 
by the 3 EMS during the study period are shown in Fig-
ure 1. There were 22 
775 patients in cardiac arrest on 
arrival of EMS of whom 11 
476 had resuscitation com-
menced. Of these, 1324 patients were randomized with 
122 subsequently excluded from analysis due to meeting 
exclusion criteria. An additional 4 patients or their families 
requested patients data not be included in the study, leav-

end point with 618 allocated to intra-arrest therapeutic 
hypothermia and 580 allocated to standard prehospital 
resuscitation care.
The baseline characteristics of the eligible patients 
are shown in Table 1.
This shows that the characteristics that are known 
to be associated with outcome such as EMS response 
time, performance of bystander CPR, age, sex, and ini-
tial cardiac rhythm were similar between the groups with 
P>0.05 for all comparisons.
The treatments of the patients after allocation are 
shown in Table 2. Very few patients allocated to stan-
dard care received cold saline outside trial protocol. 
Patients allocated to intra-arrest cooling received larg-
er total volumes of intravenous fluid, this also was seen 
when stratified by first monitored rhythm (nonshock-
able: 1213 mL±746 versus 918 mL±760, P<0.001; 
shockable: 1568 mL±760 versus 1143 mL±725, 
P<0.001). Patients allocated to intra-arrest cooling 
also required a longer duration of CPR and additional 
epinephrine.
As seen in Table 3, there was a significant decrease in 
the numbers of patients with an initial shockable rhythm 
allocated to intra-arrest cold fluid who had ROSC at the 
scene (41.2% compared with 50.6%, P=0.031). We con-
ducted a post hoc investigation of this latter finding, par-
ticularly to understand whether it could be explained by 
the treatment-induced disparity in fluid infusion volume. 
The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of transport with ROSC for 
intra-arrest cooling versus standard care was 0.69 (95% 
CI, 0.49–0.96, P=0.03), and the corresponding OR for dy-
ing at the scene was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.09–2.17, P=0.01). 
Increasing total fluid volume received was associated with 
more frequent transport with ROSC (OR 1.46 per SD [773 
mL]; 95% CI, 1.22–1.75, P<0.001). Adjustment for to-
tal fluid volume did not change the associations of intra-
arrest cooling with transport with ROSC (OR 0.55; 95% 
CI, 0.38–0.79, P=0.001) or death at the scene substan-
tially (OR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.00–2.04, P=0.05).
For patients with ROSC, the temperature was lower 
in the intra-arrest cooled group compared with the stan-
dard care group on arrival at hospital (34.7°C compared

with 35.4°C, P<0.001). The patients allocated to intra-
arrest cold fluid also had a higher rate of suspected pul-
monary edema before or at arrival at hospital (10.0% 
compared with 4.5%, P<0.001).
Patient Outcomes
The outcomes at hospital discharge are shown 
in Table 4. Overall, there was no difference in out-
comes between the groups. Of note, very few (3 out 
of 1198) patients were discharged to a nursing care 
facility. Figure 2 shows the outcomes in prespecified 
subgroups, and there were no significant differences 
in outcomes in any of these groups. In particular, de-
spite the significant decrease in the rate of ROSC in 
patients with an initial shockable rhythm allocated to 
intra-arrest therapeutic hypothermia, there was no 
difference in overall outcomes in this subgroup at 
hospital discharge.
DiscUssiOn
This large, multicenter study found that induction of 
mild therapeutic hypothermia using bolus large-vol-
ume, cold saline during CPR in patients with OHCA 
does not improve survival at hospital discharge when 
compared with standard prehospital care. Analysis 
of prespecified subgroups did not reveal any patient 
cohort that might benefit from intra-arrest cooling. An 
unexpected finding was a reduction in the rate of ROSC 
for patients with an initial shockable rhythm. An expla-
nation for this may be that a rapid fluid administration 
leads to an increase in right atrial pressure that might 
decrease coronary artery perfusion pressure, and thus

decrease myocardial perfusion. The fluid volume also 
may cause pulmonary edema that may not be appar-
ent during CPR, but was seen in more patients allo-
cated to intra-arrest cooling on arrival at hospital. It 
also is possible that ventricular fibrillation becomes 
less responsive to countershocks at a lower myocar-
dial temperature; however, this is in contrast to a labo-
ratory study that suggested that a lower myocardial 
temperature increased rather than decreased the rate 
of successful defibrillation.18 Our post hoc analysis of 
patients with an initial shockable rhythm that adjusted 
for total fluid volume suggests that the decrease in 
the rate of ROSC was due to peri-arrest cooling rather 
than the volume of fluid infused. However, given that 
this analysis was not prespecified, this data should be 
interpreted with caution. Another possible explanation 
for the decrease in ROSC rate in patients allocated to 
cold-saline infusion was that this intervention delayed 
other treatment, including subsequent defibrillation. 
This may be reflected in the longer time to ROSC in the 
intra-arrest cooling group.
Our finding that a bolus of cold saline is associated 
with a decrease in the rate of ROSC in patients with 
shockable rhythm is in contrast to a study by Garrett 
 
et al,15 in which 208 OHCA patients received 2 L of 
cold saline during CPR as soon as possible after ob-
taining IV or intraosseous access. In that before and 
after study, there was an increased rate of ROSC in 
the intra-arrest cooled patients compared with 334 
patients during the previous 6 months who did not 
receive intra-arrest cold saline (36.5% versus 26.9%; 
OR 1.83; 95% CI, 1.19–2.81); however, outcomes at 
hospital discharge in that study were similar. A more 
recent study by Debaty et al14 prospectively allocated 
245 OHCA patients to either an infusion of large-vol-
ume cold saline plus surface cooling during CPR or 
standard care. The primary outcome measure in their 
study was serum neuron-specific enolase concentra-
tion at 24 hours. The rate of patients admitted alive 
to hospital was similar between the intra-arrest cooled 
patients (33%) compared with hospital cooled patients 
(30%). In the intra-arrest cooled group, the time to 
reach a temperature ≤ 34°C was decreased by 75 
minutes (95% CI, 4; 269), but there was no difference 
between the groups in the levels of neuron-specific 
enolase, or in survival at one month post resuscitation.
Our study did find that a rapid infusion of cold saline 
decreased tympanic temperature in patients with ROSC; 
however, this decrease was modest (mean 0.7°C) and it 
is uncertain whether such a small decrease in tempera-

ture would improve neurologic outcomes. Our study also 
found that bolus, large-volume cold saline increased the 
rate of pulmonary edema which also was seen in the 
study of post-ROSC cold fluid by Kim et al.9 In contrast 
to that study, we did not see an increase in the rate of 
rearrest prior to hospital arrival.
Our study was stopped early as many receiving hospi-
tals advised that they were changing the target temper-
ature in OHCA patients from 33°C to 36°C based on the 
findings from the Targeted Temperature Management 
trial.8 Given that there is laboratory evidence that rapid 
rewarming from therapeutic hypothermic levels may 
have an adverse effect on outcome,19 it was considered 
that such a major change in hospital practice during our 
study would make interpretation of the results in our 
study uncertain had it continued to enroll to the target 
number. Although it is possible that continuation of the 
trial to the target number might have shown a difference 
in outcomes at hospital discharge between the groups, 
it is highly unlikely that intra-arrest cooling using a rapid 
IV infusion of large-volume, cold saline would have been 
found to be beneficial with larger patient numbers given 
the significant decrease in the rate of ROSC that we 
observed in patients with an initial shockable rhythm.
Nevertheless, given the laboratory data supporting 
the efficacy of intra-arrest therapeutic hypothermia in 
the prevention of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, clinical 
trials of other techniques of cooling in the prehospital 
setting should be considered including intranasal cooling 
using chilled gas,20 insertion of a cooled laryngeal mask 
airway,21 and surface cooling.22
This trial has a number of limitations. First, paramed-
ics and hospital staff were not blinded to the treatment 
allocation, and this could have resulted in bias in the 
making of treatment decisions.
Because our study did not collect data on interventions 
after hospital arrival, it is possible that patients in each 
group received different treatments during their inpatient 
stay. Second, tympanic temperature measurement may 
not reflect core temperature accurately; however, other 
more accurate techniques for core temperature mea-
surement such as esophageal temperature generally are 
not available in road based EMS in Australia. Third, this 
trial enrolled only approximately 10% of all OHCA patients 
undergoing CPR. It was not feasible in this study to col-
lect data on the reasons that patients in cardiac arrest 
were not eligible for enrollment or why those who may 
have been eligible for the study were not enrolled. Finally, 
the primary outcome measure of this trial was survival to 
hospital discharge and longer term functional outcomes 
may be a more robust measure of any treatment effect.23
This trial has several strengths. It was a randomized, 
multicenter trial with allocation concealment, involving a 
substantial numbers of patients. Most patients allocated 
to cold-saline infusion received that treatment and very 
few patients allocated to standard care received cold 
saline. Patients were well matched at baseline and all 
enrolled patients were followed to the primary end point.
In summary, the results of this trial do not support the 
hypothesis that outcomes at hospital discharge of patients 
with OHCA can be improved by induction of mild therapeu-
tic hypothermia during CPR using an intravenous bolus of 
large-volume, cold saline. Furthermore, our results suggest 
that this treatment decreases the rate of ROSC in patients 
with an initial shockable cardiac rhythm, although overall 
survival in that group was similar at hospital discharge. 
Given the compelling laboratory evidence that induction of 
mild therapeutic hypothermia during CPR is neuroprotec-
tive, additional studies of intra-arrest cooling will need to 
investigate alternate techniques other than bolus cold sa-
line for induction of therapeutic hypothermia during CPR.
