ABSTRACT
Context: Policy and legislative efforts to improve the biomedical innovation process must rely on a
detailed and thorough analysis of drug development and industry output.
Objective: As part of our efforts to build a publicly-available database on the characteristics of drug devel-
opment, we present work undertaken to test methods for compiling data from public sources. These initial
steps are designed to explore challenges in data extraction, completeness and reliability. Specifically, filing
dates for Investigational New Drugs (IND) applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
were chosen as the initial objective data element to be collected.
Materials and methods: FDA’s Drugs@FDA database and the Federal Register (FR) were used to collect
IND dates for the 587 New Molecular Entities (NMEs) approved between 1994 and 2014. When available,
the following data were captured: approval date, IND number, IND date and source of information.
Results: At least one IND date was available for 445 (75.8%) of the 587 NMEs. The Drugs@FDA database
provided IND dates for 303 (51.6%) NMEs and the FR contributed with 297 (50.6%) IND dates. Out of the
445 NMEs for which an IND date was obtained, 274 (61.6%) had more than one date reported.
Discussion: Key finding of this paper is a considerable inconsistency in reliably available or reported data
elements, in this particular case, IND application filing dates as assembled from publicly-available sources.
Conclusion: Our team will continue to focus on finding ways to collect relevant information to measure
impact of drug innovation.

Introduction
The last year has seen a number of high-profile policy and legisla-
tive efforts in the United States aimed at improving the drug
development process1–3. They have been crafted to tackle underly-
ing issues related to the outsize time, cost and inefficiencies asso-
ciated with the traditional drug development process. To realize
their full potential, these well-intentioned efforts would benefit
from a deeper understanding of opportunities for improvement
throughout this process, as well as from more research on the
impact of reforms intended to influence how drugs are developed
and approved. But such research is hampered by the limited avail-
ability of standard, consistent and routinely collected measures of
progress in pharmaceutical innovation.
While new drugs and biologics have made a tremendous
impact on the treatment of many diseases in the past several dec-
ades, research and development spending by the pharmaceutical
industry has grown many-fold. At the same time, the annual num-
ber of new drugs approved year-to-year have shown variability
but not a concomitant rise in keeping with steady growth of R&D
spending4. Many analysts have attempted to explain this apparent
decline in productivity of pharmaceutical research and develop-
ment, but a significant challenge facing such analyses has been
the paucity of metrics available to assess the health of different
aspects of the complex ecosystem that propels pharmaceutical
innovation5–10.
Gathering real data to measure progress in reducing the time,
cost and inefficiency of development, as well as interpreting those
metrics, poses many challenges. To better understand the impact
that policies have had or are having on the productivity of the
innovation enterprise, we argue that more comprehensive histor-
ical data and trend analysis will be required.
In a previous article, our research teams proposed a publicly-
available database designed to help address these important
issues and enable better analyses of biomedical innovation11. We
outlined a database that centralizes data elements related to
approved New Molecular Entities (NMEs), their development and
downstream impact on patient care; this database can eventually
be extended to incorporate data on drug candidates that do not
successfully navigate the development and approval process. By
building a more comprehensive set of data and measures related
to these characteristics, analyses could move beyond more trad-
itional approaches that tend to focus on only a few aspects of
drug development and associated trends (e.g. tracking annual
approvals, changes in research and development spending, etc.).
In short, we hope to shed better light on the factors that enable
and contribute to successful product development and on the
underlying drivers of innovation.
For initial database development, and as a way to test
approaches to collecting data from public sources, we decided to
explore and better characterize trends in development timelines
to uncover the factors and policies that hamper timely approval
and patient access. A clearer picture of variability in development
timelines may help to identify common bottlenecks or barriers to
a more efficient process, and in turn inform policy making to over-
come these challenges. Creating this picture will require collection
of key dates associated with early compound development, initi-
ation of clinical trial phases, and milestone dates during regulatory
review. While the development ecosystem is increasingly global,

 for the purposes of this initial round of data development our
focus has been on identifying and collecting data elements for
drugs
successfully
approved
by
the
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration (FDA).
In an ideal scenario, we would be able to access dates from
initiation
of
first-in-human
testing
all
the
way
through
to
approval for each NME in the database. For purposes of assess-
ing the immediate availability of relevant data, however, we
decided to focus first on one objective data element – date of
Investigational New Drug (IND) submission in the US. While this
is far from conclusive in establishing the start date of clinical
development, the IND date provides an initial reasonable proxy
for the start of a clinical development program in the US and is
an important first step in collecting broader data on develop-
ment timelines.
It should be noted that there are some potential challenges to
using IND dates for timeline analysis purposes given that they
may not be indicative of previous international development
efforts or may not be inclusive of other modes of early develop-
ment (e.g. expanded access programs). Still, using IND dates for
initial research will enable us to troubleshoot data collection activ-
ities and explore additional data elements that, used in conjunc-
tion with INDs, could create composite measures for tracking
development timelines. Our hope was that IND dates would be
accurately and reliably captured and reported, given their associ-
ation with a Federal agency and approved (i.e. nonproprietary,
non-failure) products.
The process described in this paper not only contributes to
building our database in earnest, but also provides guideposts for
a number of questions related to database development. First,
how easy will it be to extract key information related to drug
development from public sources? Second, how will we identify
and overcome gaps in that data? And third, how reliable will the
publicly-available data turn out to be? Below, we walk through
our findings and outline the challenges to finding adequate and
accurate data from public resources.
Methods
List of NMEs
The first step in building this database was to list the NMEs
approved by the FDA since 1994. For this purpose, we used lists
of NMEs available in various published papers for the years
1994–2011, and the list of approved NMEs published on the FDA’s
website for the years 2012–20147,9,12. Following Lanthier’s meth-
odology, we focused on novel therapeutic products and excluded
diagnostic drugs, drugs approved under an abbreviated regulatory
pathway, and products intended for use solely by US military per-
sonnel. Our final data set consisted of 587 NME approvals.
Sources for IND dates
IND dates were extracted from two sources: FDA’s Drugs@FDA
database and the Federal Register (FR). The methodology to
extract IND dates from the Drugs@FDA database was as follows:
we downloaded all documents available in the database for each
NME. After conversion into searchable documents, we performed a
search in each document for the word “IND” and collected the
date as well as the IND number, when these data points were pre-
sent. Data were collected as shown in the relevant document.
Information about whether it was the submission date, receipt
date or safe to proceed date was not collected because it was not
systematically mentioned next to the IND date. For those NMEs
that had more than one IND date, we collected all the dates we
could find. To search for IND dates on the FR website, we first
downloaded the list of links corresponding to all drugs for which
a company requested a patent extension using “Determination of
Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension” as the
search term; the IND date is systematically collected in the FR for
the extension process. We accessed the patent extension request
and identified the IND date and number. As with the Drugs@FDA
database, the FR contained more than one IND date for some
NMEs, in which cases we collected all dates.
Data analysis
Data were compiled in an Excel database. The following informa-
tion was captured, when available: approval date, IND number,
IND date, source of information (FR versus Drugs@FDA database).
Analysis was done as a count of IND dates obtained for each NME
and per data source. When more than one IND date was found,
the time difference between these dates was calculated.
Limitations
It should be noted that this work presents a number of limitations.
First of all, IND submission represents the opening of clinical
development in the US. A proportion of drug development occurs
outside of the US, and will not be captured by the IND date.
Another example is situations where a drug’s sponsor changes, a
new IND could be submitted. Keeping this limitation in mind, we
still decided to proceed with collecting IND dates because they
represent an objective and highly relevant data point in the US.
Secondly, we did not collect information regarding the type of
IND date, which depending on reporting could represent the date
application sponsor submitted the application, the date FDA
acknowledges receipt of the application, or the date FDA allows
the IND to proceed. The search tool we used was designed to
retrieve the IND number and the IND date only. The tool allowed
us to collect all dates associated with an IND, regardless of the
context for this date. This is why more than one date has been
retrieved for some drugs. Thirdly, our effort concentrated on col-
lecting IND dates that correspond to the IND submitted for the
NME’s specific indication and dosage form/route of administration.
In some instances however, several IND numbers and/or dates
where available in the documents associated with a single NME.
Some of these IND dates corresponded to the earliest IND submit-
ted for the compound for any indication. As the purpose of the
work was to determine what type of information was accessible in
publicly-available sources, we collected any IND date we found in
documents associated with a NME, regardless of whether it was
for the NME’s specific indication or for some earlier development.
This aspect is discussed further below.
Results
IND date availability
At least one IND date was available for 445 (75.8%) of the 587
NMEs. As was expected, as we went back in time, a lower percent-
age of IND dates were recovered (Figure 1). For the 142 (24.2%)
NMEs for which IND dates could not be found, there was either
no mention of the IND date in the documents reviewed, or the
date was redacted. We were unable to identify any consistent pat-
tern in the redaction of IND dates.

 IND date per data source
The Drugs@FDA database provided IND dates for 303 (51.6%)
NMEs and the FR contributed with 297 (50.6%) IND dates. Looking
at the overlap between the two data sources, 26.4% of IND dates
came from both Drugs@FDA database and the FR, 25.2% from
Drugs@FDA database only and 24.2% from the FR only, with no
IND date identified for the remaining 24.2% (Figure 2).
Access to data
IND dates were not referenced in a systematic way in the
Drugs@FDA database documents. IND dates were found either in
the medical review, correspondence review, pharmacology review,
chemistry review, risk review or other areas. As a result, a
resource-intensive process was required to locate the desired
information. The information was more systematically captured in
the FR and was easy to locate.
Multiple IND dates
Out of the 445 NMEs for which an IND date was obtained, 274
(61.6%) had more than one date reported. The split per data
source is as follows: out of the 148 NMEs whose IND dates were
found in the Drugs@FDA database only, 15% had more than one
date. Out of the 142 NMEs whose IND dates were found only in
the FR, 68% had more than one date. Regarding the NMEs with
IND dates found in both the Drugs@FDA database and the FR, by
definition all of them had more than one date reported. Table 1
shows the number of IND dates per data source.
Time gap between IND dates
For NMEs with multiple IND dates reported, we calculated the
time difference between the most extreme dates and grouped
them in six categories, from exact match to over 10 years difference.
Figure 2. IND date availability per data source. Notes: IND dates were identified and collected from two primary public sources: the Drugs@FDA database and the
Federal Register. The availability of dates varied over time, both by total availability of IND dates year-to-year and availability by source.

 As shown in Table 2, dates were identical for 8% of NMEs with
multiple INDs, and 45% of NMEs had dates with no more than
one
month
gap.
This
most
likely
represents
the
difference
between when the IND application was submitted and when it
was allowed to proceed. The remaining 47% of NMEs had gaps of
greater than one month, up to as long as 12 years. As shown in
Table 2, the exact match between two dates was mainly seen in
dates obtained through the FR. The frequency of drugs having
over five year difference between available IND date was seen
when the IND dates were sourced from both the Drugs@FDA
database and the FR.
Discussion
Our rationale in selecting IND dates for this initial exercise in data-
base development was to select an objective data element that
would
present
minimal
methodologic
issues
and
could
be
obtained from public-domain sources. This exercise revealed, how-
ever, that IND dates are not systematically documented in the
Drugs@FDA database, are sometimes redacted for reasons that do
not appear to be clear or consistent, and sometimes present sig-
nificant discrepancies. The FR provided more consistent IND data,
but only on drugs with patent extension requests. Though more
readily available for recent years, the process of identifying and
assembling dates from various sources and subsections within
those sources proves time consuming and resource intensive,
potentially indicating additional challenges to accessing other data
that is arguable public and nonproprietary moving forward.
Reconciling multiple IND dates for individual NMEs is another
potential data collection challenge. In the 53% of cases where
gaps in data are less than one month, we assume the gap is due
to administrative reasons. Wider discrepancies in IND dates may
potentially relate to IND transfers from one organization to
another or initiation of development in a different indication,
among other potential factors.
Lomitapide is a good illustration of this situation, with two dif-
ferent INDs (IND 50820 and IND 77775) and two dates (18 June
1996 and 16 May 2007) identified. Information compiled in the
FDA’s Administrative and Correspondence documents clarify the
history of the drug and lists the various owners of the molecule
(Bristol-Myers Squibb; Daniel Rader, University of Pennsylvania;
and
Aegerion)
and
registration
for
various
indications
(Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and HoFH).
Such explanations allow a better understanding of the regulatory
history of lomitapide’s development, and are helpful in deciding
which IND date to use. Unfortunately, the existence of such a clear
explanation is the exception, not the rule. In most cases where
multiple IND dates were found, the explanation is either absent or
redacted. In those cases, thorough desk research and discussions
with experts will be necessary to understand development history
and determine which date to use.
This exercise is also useful in establishing methods for the data
mining and extraction that will have to be done on a large scale
to continue populating a database on drug development. As we
intend to broaden this database beyond successfully approved
NMEs and to unapproved products, having a means by which we
can easily and quickly gather reliable data will be key. Work
related to populating IND dates, however, demonstrates that a
high proportion of discrepancies between data elements pulled
from multiple sources will necessitate rigorous data review proc-
esses for ensuring accuracy.
Initial work also further underscores the need for a constella-
tion approach to innovation metrics. In many cases, it may not be
possible to rely on a single data element such as IND date to
adequately characterize the metric of interest, such as develop-
ment time in this instance.
Given ongoing policy efforts to improve drug development,
there remains a real need for systematically available data that
can better contribute to such composites, characterize the innov-
ation process and measure whether policies are having their
intended effect. While retrospective data collection and analysis
like we have proposed can eventually mine and compile such
data from an assortment of public and private sources, policy
makers themselves could begin to address the dearth of such
detailed information by identifying new opportunities for centraliz-
ing and reporting data moving forward. The internal practices at
FDA that lead to some of the inconsistencies in reporting
described above could be addressed through more systematic and
prospective data collection, more standardized review documents
or new data fields populated by front-line review staff. This should
be done in a way that does not divert internal resources or create
additional workflow burden, but rather through more routine cap-
ture of data elements as part of already-established processes.
Tackling these issues through FDA reporting may require
changes to underlying regulations. Ongoing PDUFA VI negotia-
tions could serve as a vehicle for potential reporting requirements
tied not to typical Agency performance measures, but instead the
development characteristics of the products themselves. Similarly,
many public reporting challenges would be most easily remedied
by better, more consistent disclosure of basic information related
to drug development from manufacturers themselves. Moving for-
ward, we strongly propose that critical and objective information
related to drug development, such as the IND dates we discuss

aThe Drugs@FDA database only mentioned the year the IND was filed. In the
absence of a date and month, it was not possible to calculate the gap between
the various dates.
For the 274 NMEs with multiple IND dates reported, there is a considerable vari-
ation in the gap between the most extreme possible dates. This variability
ranged from a difference between dates of no more than one month and a dif-
ference of over 10 years.

For 274 NMEs, more than one IND date was reported between the Drugs@FDA
database and the Federal Register. The majority of NMEs with multiple IND dates
were found in the Federal Register only (97 NMEs) or due to three different
dates reported between both sources (108 NMEs).

Conclusion
As our teams continue work on the development of a comprehen-
sive, publicly-available data resource on drug development and
innovation, we look forward to finding novel ways for tackling
these and other data challenges as they arise.
