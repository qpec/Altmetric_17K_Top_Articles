Abstract: Epinephrine is the only effective treatment for anaphylaxis but studies routinely 
show underutilization. This is especially troubling given the fact that fatal anaphylaxis has 
been associated with delayed administration of epinephrine. Many potential barriers exist to the 
proper use of epinephrine during an anaphylactic reaction. This article will explore both patient- 
and physician-related factors, as well as misconceptions that all contribute to the underuse of 
epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis.
Keywords: anaphylaxis, epinephrine, emergency department, food allergy
Introduction
Although epinephrine is the only effective treatment to prevent progression of an 
anaphylactic reaction,1 its underuse has been reported in many studies.2–7 Fleischer et 
al found that only 30% of severe allergic reactions were treated with epinephrine in a 
cohort of preschool children with known food allergy.7 Robins et al found that almost 
two-thirds of patients presenting to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department 
(ED) had not received epinephrine prior to arrival at the ED.5 This pattern is concern-
ing given that most cases of reported deaths from anaphylaxis have been associated 
with delayed administration of epinephrine.8,9 Many potential barriers surround the 
proper use of epinephrine during an anaphylactic reaction. This article will explore both 
patient- and physician-related factors, as well as misconceptions that can all contribute 
to the underuse of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis.
Patient barriers
High cost of epinephrine prescriptions
Recently, much attention has been given to the increasing cost of epinephrine auto-
injectors (EAIs). In 2016, the average wholesale price of 2 EpiPens exceeded $700, 
an increase of 545% from 2007.10 Similarly, another article reported the price for an 
EpiPen to be >$600 in 2016.11 EAIs may be prohibitively expensive for many patients 
without health insurance/prescription coverage or for patients with high deductible 
insurance plans.
Patient assistance programs have been put in place to attempt to reduce the burden of 
purchasing injectable epinephrine, but cost still remains a significant concern for many 
patients. The high cost has resulted in consideration of sub-optimal modes of epinephrine 
delivery, such as the use of pre-filled syringes or expired autoinjectors. Although both of 
these approaches are better than not delivering any epinephrine, they raise concerns.10,12

Prince et al
Pre-filled syringes require more training, are more likely to be 
associated with handling or dosing errors, are more sensitive 
to ultraviolet light and temperature extremes, and must be 
replaced every 2–3 months.10 Expired EAIs have been shown 
to deliver a lower dose of epinephrine. However, the exact 
amount of viable epinephrine remaining in expired devises 
ranges from 51–90%, depending upon time since expiration 
and study methodology used.12–14
Lack of epinephrine availability among 
patients
Many studies have demonstrated that patients, even when 
prescribed epinephrine, do not have it available to use during 
anaphylaxis. Curtis et al found that <60% of patients presenting 
to an allergy clinic for food allergy follow-up visit had their 
personal epinephrine device available.15 This is concerning, 
as this group of patients receiving subspecialty care should 
presumably have more education and awareness of food allergy 
management. Brooks et al reviewed the electronic record of all 
food allergy reactions presenting to a pediatric tertiary care ED 
and found that less than half of the patients with a known food 
allergy had epinephrine present at the time of the reaction.6
Lack of epinephrine availability in schools 
and camps
Most people do not know of their food allergy until they expe-
rience their first allergic reaction. Up to 25% of food allergic 
reactions within schools occur in children with no previous 
food allergy.4 In addition, even when patients do know about 
their food allergy, many fail to bring their EAIs with them 
to school.16 Given the vast amount of time children spend 
at school, epinephrine availability within schools has been 
a high priority for food allergy advocacy organizations and 
parents of food allergic children. Recent legislative efforts 
have led to passage of laws throughout the USA that allow 
for voluntary stocking and use of EAIs within schools, but 
only 12 states mandate procurement.17 Current implemen-
tation of this legislation has not been studied or evaluated 
on a widespread basis. The lack of EAIs may be even more 
problematic in the camp setting. One study found that less 
than half of students with reported food allergies attending a 
summer camp brought their EAI with them to camp.18
Lack of epinephrine use, even when 
available
In addition to lack of availability, many patients may not use 
their EAI, even when it is available during an anaphylactic 
reaction. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including 
lack of the following: recognition of anaphylaxis, knowledge 
with regard to indications for use of epinephrine, or comfort 
using epinephrine. The training that each patient receives 
with regard to recognition of anaphylaxis will be variable and 
dependent upon the information provided by their personal 
clinician, their own online searches, or discussion with other 
patients and families. Hence, it is easy to recognize the vari-
ability in the amount and reliability of information received 
by each individual patient. In a national registry of patients 
with peanut and tree nut allergy, a consistent inability to 
recognize anaphylactic symptoms was found.19 Sheikh et al 
also demonstrated that even when patients with a reported 
episode of anaphylaxis carried an EAI, many did not use it 
at the time of their reaction.20 Robinson et al reported more 
encouraging data and found that when available, 86% of 
children received epinephrine prior to arrival at the ED and 
those patients with multiple food allergies were more likely 
to use their epinephrine.5 Brooks et al, however, found that 
when epinephrine was available, only about two-thirds of 
patients used it to treat an anaphylactic reaction.6 Reasons for 
not using their epinephrine included as follows: not thinking 
it was necessary, fear of using it, or having an expired device.
Incorrect technique
An additional barrier to the proper use of epinephrine is lack 
of proper training with regard to correct technique. Bonds 
et al found that 84% of patients with previous prescriptions 
for EAIs could not demonstrate accurate technique.21 Ridolo 
et al also identified a low rate of proper demonstration of 
epinephrine technique at follow-up visits, with only 39% of 
patients demonstrating proper technique.22 Training in proper 
technique is the responsibility of the prescribing clinician. 
This should entail a careful review of how each device oper-
ates, hands-on instructions, and time during the office visit to 
practice with a training device, including feedback on patient 
performance. Proper technique should be reviewed with a 
training device at every subsequent office visit and patient 
errors should be addressed. With limited time during office 
visits, physicians may not be able to perform this training, but 
ancillary staff, including nurses, can be a valuable resource in 
this realm. Clinicians can also direct patients toward online 
resources that have been vetted for accuracy.
Epinephrine is a life-saving medication and proper use 
during an anaphylactic reaction is of paramount importance. 
However, as described previously, there are many potential 
barriers to correct administration of epinephrine by patients – 
they must receive a prescription for the medication, must 
be able to purchase (afford) the medication, must have the

Underuse of epinephrine for anaphylaxis is common and complicated
medication available, must recognize when to use the medica-
tion, and must be able to use the device appropriately. Each of 
these steps represents an area of much-needed improvement.
Physician barriers
When evaluating physician prescribing habits and use of 
epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis, it is clear that 
there is a need for improvement in this area as well. As pre-
viously mentioned, delayed administration of epinephrine 
in the treatment of anaphylaxis is associated with increased 
mortality,9 and consensus guidelines recommend epinephrine 
as first-line therapy.1,23,24 Despite this, antihistamines and 
corticosteroids are often the first medications administered by 
physicians to patients presenting with anaphylaxis.25–27 Even 
more concerning is that several recent studies demonstrate 
that approximately half of patients presenting to the ED with 
anaphylaxis never receive epinephrine.26,28–31 Please see Box 1 
for a summary of several relevant articles and key Fast Facts 
surrounding physician barriers to proper treatment.
Complexity of diagnosing anaphylaxis
One potential physician barrier for the appropriate use of 
epinephrine is the complexity involved in establishing the 
diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis 
with no confirmatory diagnostic tests available. While a 
serum tryptase obtained within 1–6 hours of symptom onset 
can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, 
it has a low sensitivity, particularly in food-induced ana-
phylaxis.24 Furthermore, given the rapidly progressing and 
severe nature of anaphylaxis, waiting for laboratory results, 
particularly a serum tryptase level, will delay necessary 
treatment.
In order to simplify the diagnosis, the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and the Food 
Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) assembled an 
international and multidisciplinary panel in 2006 to establish 
clinically relevant criteria to more clearly define anaphylaxis.1 
This panel defined 3 separate clinical scenarios in which 
criteria for making the diagnosis vary depending on the 
likelihood of a patient’s exposure to a potential allergen, Box 
2. The NIAID/FAAN criteria were subsequently validated 
in the ED setting and were shown to have a sensitivity and 
specificity of 96.7% and 82.4%, respectively.32 While these 
criteria are widely accepted among consensus guidelines, a 
recent survey of 207 ED providers in the USA reported that 
only 9% of providers used agreed-upon clinical criteria to 
diagnose anaphylaxis.33 Moreover, while the NIAID/FAAN 
criteria are helpful in research and education, there is some 
concern that their low positive predictive value of 69% makes 
them less useful for ED physicians who have to maintain 
a broad differential diagnosis.34 Nevertheless, the NIAID/
FAAN criteria appear to have improved the diagnosis and 
management of anaphylaxis among at least some ED physi-
cians with 1 study demonstrating an increase of intramuscular 
(IM) epinephrine administration by 40% after the criteria 
was established.28
Box 1 Fast facts
• Only 8% of patients diagnosed with drug-induced anaphylaxis in the ED were given epinephrine and only 18% of this population were evaluated 
by an allergist/immunologist in the 1 year following their reaction.31
• Implementation of an anaphylaxis order set increased the rate of epinephrine administration in the ED by ~20%.45
• The NIAID 2006 guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis have improved the treatment of management of anaphylaxis with one pediatric 
ED showing a significant increase in the rate of epinephrine use via the IM route from 6% to 46%. However, only 61% of patients received EAIs 
upon discharge with no significant change with implementation of the guidelines. There was a significant increase in allergy referrals; however, 
still, only 48% of patients received referrals post guideline.28
• In adult patients seen in the ED, drugs are the most common cause of anaphylaxis and several studies demonstrate that less than half of patients 
diagnosed with anaphylaxis receive epinephrine.29
• A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients diagnosed with anaphylaxis in the ED showed that only 56% of patients received IM 
epinephrine and 63% of these patients received a prescription for an EAI. Referral to an allergist was made in only 33% of cases.33
• While physicians might assume that epinephrine injection is a cause for increased patient stress, a recent study demonstrated that in patients 
experiencing anaphylaxis, epinephrine use was actually associated with an increased quality of life.40
• While there is no one specific diagnostic test to identify anaphylaxis, The NIAID/FAAN criteria were validated in the ED to have a sensitivity of 
96.7% and a specificity of 82.4%.32
• Only 38% of patients suspected of having anaphylaxis in the ED had documented follow-up by an allergist, and 35% of these patients had an 
alteration in the diagnosis and/or trigger of anaphylaxis.49

Lack of knowledge about epinephrine 
administration
Another potential physician barrier for the appropriate use of 
epinephrine in the management of anaphylaxis is the lack of 
knowledge of how to administer epinephrine and use EAIs. 
There is clear evidence that IM administration of epinephrine 
in the anterolateral thigh achieves faster and higher peak 
plasma concentrations compared with administration via 
the subcutaneous route.35,36 Despite this, many physicians 
choose either a subcutaneous or intravenous (IV) route of 
delivery.28,37,38 In addition to decreased efficacy, administra-
tion of epinephrine via the incorrect route is associated with 
an increased likelihood of overdose and subsequent cardio-
vascular complications.38,39 Confusion also likely arises from 
the variety of autoinjectors available, each of which have a 
different technique, as well as different concentrations of 
liquid epinephrine available for use in the hospital setting. 
Misconceptions about epinephrine safety, which will be more 
extensively discussed later in this article, may also contribute 
to physician underuse. Interestingly, while physicians might 
assume that an epinephrine injection may cause increased 
patient stress, a recent study demonstrated that in patients 
experiencing anaphylaxis, epinephrine use was associated 
with increased patient quality of life.40 
The use of EAIs in the treatment of anaphylaxis has 
helped in decreasing some of the adverse outcomes associ-
ated with improper administration of epinephrine, yet stud-
ies have demonstrated that not all physicians know how to 
correctly use EAIs.41,42 Furthermore, the lack of physician 
familiarity of EAIs along with inadequate patient instruc-
tion appears to be associated with improper patient use of 
EIAs.42–44 The advent of new EAIs that have attempted to 
simplify their use with audible instruction, may help to 
improve correct administration; however, formularies may 
limit which EAIs are available for patients to obtain through 
their insurance provider. Implementation and emphasis of 
EAI education as a part of physician training programs has 
likely increased familiarity among providers; however, more 
recent studies need to be performed to confirm this. One pos-
sible  
intervention that may help in improving the appropriate 
use of epinephrine in patients diagnosed with anaphylaxis 
within the emergency setting is the use of electronic order 
sets. For instance, Manivannan et al demonstrated that the 
implementation of an anaphylactic order set significantly 
increased the rate of appropriate epinephrine administra-
tion by 18%.45
Low EAI prescription rates for patients at 
high risk for future anaphylaxis
The low rate of EAI prescriptions given to patients who 
are at high risk of future anaphylaxis is another physician 
barrier that warrants improvement. Since most episodes of 
fatal anaphylaxis occur outside the hospital setting, current 
guidelines recommend that patients who are at high risk 
for future episodes of anaphylaxis be prescribed EAIs and 
instructed on their use.23,24 Despite this recommendation, mul-
tiple studies have demonstrated that most patients diagnosed 
with anaphylaxis in the ED do not receive EAI prescriptions, 
with actual percentages of patients receiving prescriptions 
ranging from 8% to 63%.26,28,29,46,47 This is a significant barrier 
when considering that Pourang et al reported that when an 
EAI prescription was provided, it was dispensed 95.9% of the 
time, independent of copay amount.47 To further complicate 
this issue, some patients who would benefit from having an 
Box 2 Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is very likely when any one of these 3 criteria are met: 
Acute onset (within minutes to 3 hours) of rapidly progressive symptoms involving the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (examples include: 
generalized hives, pruritus, flushing, swollen lips or tongue) and at least one of the following:
• Respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, stridor)
• Hypotension or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (syncope, collapse)
Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after likely exposure to an allergen (within minutes to 3 hours):
• Skin-mucosal involvement (generalized hives, pruritis, flushing, swollen lips or tongue)
• Respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, stridor)
• Hypotension or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (syncope, collapse)
• Gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, crampy abdominal pain)
Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (within minutes to 3 hours)
• This scenario most often involves a patient with known environmental allergies who received an allergen immunotherapy subcutaneous 
injection immediately prior

Underuse of epinephrine for anaphylaxis is common and complicated
EAI prescription are not diagnosed with anaphylaxis initially. 
This is commonly observed in patients presenting with iso-
lated cutaneous symptoms secondary to an immunoglobulin 
E-mediated food allergy. Given the risk of accidental expo-
sure and potential for severe anaphylaxis, many experts have 
recommended prescribing EAIs for these patients in addition 
to those presenting with more apparent anaphylaxis.48 Finally, 
unless a prescription for an EAI is labeled “Dispense as Writ-
ten”, individual states may allow pharmacies to substitute 
one device for another, without any confirmation from the 
prescribing clinician. Substitutes are typically chosen accord-
ing to insurance formularies and medication coverage. Given 
the differences in technique with each device, such changes 
could result in errors in administration if proper technique 
is not reviewed at the time of substitution.
Low rates of allergy referrals for patients 
at high risk for future anaphylaxis
A final physician barrier for the appropriate use of epineph-
rine in the management of anaphylaxis is the low rate of 
referral to an allergist/immunologist. While a referral for 
further evaluation will not directly impact the acute manage-
ment of anaphylaxis, it can have significant implications on 
the long-term management of patients at high risk of future 
anaphylaxis. One recent study demonstrated that 35% of 
patients referred to allergy/immunology had an alteration 
in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis or the eliciting trigger of 
the patient’s prior reaction.49 Effective prevention of future 
anaphylaxis relies upon avoidance of known triggers, thus 
proper identification of relevant allergens is paramount to 
successful patient care.
Studies have also demonstrated that patients who received 
consultation with an allergist were 6 times more competent in 
demonstrating how to appropriately use an EAI,4 but unfor-
tunately, patients with a history of severe anaphylaxis were 
less likely to have been evaluated by an allergist.50 Despite the 
clear benefits of an allergy referral, the majority of patients 
diagnosed with anaphylaxis in the ED are never evaluated 
by an allergist/immunologist.26,28,31,46,49
Misconceptions surrounding 
epinephrine
As discussed earlier in this article, there are many variables 
that contribute to whether epinephrine is used in the treat-
ment of anaphylaxis. In addition to physician prescribing 
habits, lack of proper education and training of patients, and 
lack of availability of devices due to financial constraints or 
nonadherence, there are several misconceptions that may also 
contribute to underuse of epinephrine. The origins of these 
misconceptions are either unknown or multifaceted, and the 
pervasiveness is not fully understood. However, both patients 
and health care providers are subject to both receiving and 
disseminating misinformation. This section will discuss 
common misconceptions as well as the surrounding evidence 
that refutes them.
Misconception #1: epinephrine should 
not be used in anyone with a history of 
cardiovascular disease
Epinephrine is a nonselective agonist of all adrenergic 
receptors, which can induce several cardiovascular effects, 
including increased peripheral resistance (vasoconstriction) 
via α1 receptors and increased cardiac output via β1 receptors. 
Epinephrine has important cardiac inotropic and chronotropic 
effects that help in reversing the symptoms of anaphylaxis.48 
In addition, the package insert for epinephrine indicates many 
potential adverse effects, including angina, arrhythmias, 
and rapid rise in blood pressure, with potential for cerebral 
hemorrhage. It is readily apparent why health care profes-
sionals and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease 
may approach to use epinephrine with caution.
Recent evidence demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular 
events associated with epinephrine use during anaphylaxis are 
relatively rare and almost always associated with improper 
dosage or administration. A review of 301 patients who 
received at least 1 dose of epinephrine for anaphylaxis at a 
large tertiary care ED demonstrated a total of 4 overdoses 
and 8 adverse cardiovascular events.38 All 4 overdoses and 
50% of the adverse effects occurred after IV bolus dosing of 
epinephrine. Among 245 patients who received epinephrine 
through IM autoinjector use, 1 had angina and 2 experienced 
hypertension. The authors identified a significantly higher 
risk of adverse events (odds ratio [OR] 7.5 [95% CI, 1.6 
to 35.3]) and overdose (OR 53.4 [95% CI, 6.5 to infinity]) 
when epinephrine was administered by IV compared with 
IM administration.
A similar retrospective review of 492 patients found that 
risk of adverse event from epinephrine administration almost 
exclusively occurred in adult patients who received IV dos-
ing (OR 99.6 [95% CI, 7.4 to infinity]).39 Among patients 
in this cohort who received IM epinephrine, 3.5% of older 
patients experienced cardiovascular complications compared 
with 0.5% of younger patients (OR 1.09 [95% CI, 0.65 to 
infinity]). Collectively, these data demonstrate relatively 
low risk for cardiovascular complications from IM use of 
epinephrine in preloaded autoinjectors. It also demonstrates

Prince et al
inappropriate use of IV epinephrine in the hospital setting, 
which dramatically increases risk for side effects. Published 
guidelines on management of anaphylaxis support use of IV 
bolus epinephrine only when a patient has ongoing hypoten-
sion despite multiple doses of IM epinephrine and IV fluid 
resuscitation, or if they are in cardiovascular arrest.23 Thus, 
the misconception with regard to cardiovascular complica-
tions from epinephrine appears to originate from complica-
tions arising from IV administration, and not from the use 
of autoinjectors.
Interestingly, cardiac complications can rarely arise dur-
ing the pathophysiologic process of anaphylaxis, which are 
separate from epinephrine. Kounis syndrome is a rare condi-
tion that manifests as acute vasospastic coronary syndrome 
secondary to the inflammatory mediators released during an 
acute allergic reaction.51 Kounis syndrome has been reported 
in individuals with and without underlying coronary artery 
disease.
Misconception #2: EAIs cannot be used 
in infants
Currently, there are only 2 premeasured doses of epinephrine, 
0.15 and 0.3 mg, in autoinjectors available in the USA and 
Canada.48 Manufacturers recommend use of the 0.15 mg 
dose for patients weighing 15–30 kg and the 0.3 mg dose for 
anyone weighing ≥30 kg. However, expert consensus suggests 
switching most children from the 0.15 mg to the 0.3 mg dose 
when they reach a body weight of 25 kg.52
Two issues arise in infants weighing <15 kg: proper dos-
ing and needle length. The 0.15 mg dose is 2-fold higher than 
recommended for infants ≤7.5 kg.53 However, no alternatives 
are available other than drawing up 0.1 mg of epinephrine 
in a vial and having caregivers administer this in place of 
the autoinjector. The risk of dosing error, inappropriate 
administration, and degradation within a few months due 
to air exposure54 likely outweighs the risk of using the 0.15 
mg preloaded autoinjector, hence most experts agree with 
the latter approach.
A recent study raised concern about potential for intraos-
seous injection of epinephrine in young children weighing 
15–30 kg due to needle length.55 The authors used ultrasound 
to measure the distance from skin to muscle and bone on 
the anterolateral thigh in 102 children weighing 15–30 kg. 
They found that use of high pressure 0.15 mg autoinjectors 
was associated with 11% risk of intraosseous injection for 
Epipen Jr and Auvi-Q/Allerject (Canadian version of Auvi-Q) 
devices and 38% risk through use of Jext (European version 
of Adrenaclick). A similar study using ultrasound to measure 
depth on the anterolateral thigh evaluated infants weighing 
<15 kg.56 This study identified 19% of infants 10–14.9 kg 
and 60% of infants <10 kg at risk for intraosseous injection 
of 0.15 mg Epipen Jr and Allerject.
Epinephrine is the only effective and first-line treatment 
for anaphylaxis. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion granted priority review and approval for the production of 
a 0.1 mg autoinjector, but until this is more widely available, 
the only commercial option for infants weighing ≤15 kg is a 
0.15 mg dose. Given the importance of prompt administration 
of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis, all infants at 
risk for anaphylaxis should have an autoinjector prescribed. 
However, parents and caregivers should be counseled on 
potential risks involved with dosing and needle length, within 
the context of providing effective therapy for a potentially 
life-threatening reaction.
Misconception #3: EAIs are harmful
Many parents fear using EAIs on their children as they are 
afraid it may cause injury or harm them.7,57 A review of 
voluntary self-report to the USA Poison Control Centers 
identified 15,190 unintentional injections from EAIs between 
1994 and 2007.58 Among those injured, 57% were aged <18 
years, including 18% aged ≤5 years. Only 15.2% of reported 
injuries were moderate or severe, indicating need for treat-
ment, and 75% of all reported injections resulted in very 
minor symptoms that self-resolved. Of note, only 40% of 
unintentional injections occurred when the person was try-
ing to inject themselves or another person during an allergic 
reaction. Other occurrences were during: inspection of the 
device (13%), disposal of the device (11%), a training ses-
sion (8%), or when reaching into an enclosed space such as 
a purse or bag (7%).
A recent retrospective case series reported 22 cases of 
EAI-related injury among children, all from the Epipen Jr 
or Epipen devices.59 Requests for cases were queried from 
email discussion lists and social media groups, thus the 
incidence of such injuries could not be determined. Sev-
enteen (77%) of the injuries involved leg lacerations and 
4 (18%) involved retained needles. Ages of the children 
involved ranged from 1 to11 years (mean=4.6 years). All 
17-reported lacerations occurred on the lateral thigh and 
ranged in length from 1.5 to 8 inches. Among these, only

Underuse of epinephrine for anaphylaxis is common and complicated
with the goal of reducing risk from injury due to children 
moving their legs.
Most health care providers who have prescribed EAIs 
have anecdotal reports of unintentional injection of them-
selves, colleagues, or their patients. Limited published data 
support that this likely does occur to some extent, but the true 
incidence is unknown. However, evidence suggests that any 
harm from unintentional injection is likely minimal and can 
be avoided through proper training and supervised practice 
with a medical provider. The misconception that autoinjectors 
are harmful likely stems from anecdotal reports and parental 
concerns, which should not preclude use, when indicated.
Misconception #4: epinephrine is 
dangerous, so if you use it, you need to 
go to the ED
This section has already addressed common misconceptions 
surrounding adverse effects and injury from EAIs. However, 
many parents or patients may be reluctant to administer 
epinephrine given the recommendation to always call 911 
or seek emergency medical care. This can be viewed as 
unnecessary and inconvenient by some. Others may miscon-
strue the necessity of emergency room evaluation due to the 
dangers of the medication itself, as opposed to the need for 
monitoring and potential need for additional treatment due 
to the allergic reaction.
All published guidelines on the management of anaphy-
laxis recommend assessment at an ED after treatment with 
epinephrine in the community setting.23,52,60 This recom-
mendation stems from concern that symptoms may continue 
to progress and require additional therapy, or due to risk of 
biphasic anaphylaxis.
Very few patients who experience anaphylaxis require 
hospitalization due to ongoing treatment or monitoring. 
The decision to admit after emergency room evaluation is 
individualized and consideration should be given to any 
patient who requires more than 1 dose of epinephrine and/or 
IV fluids due to hypovolemic shock, experiences laryngeal 
edema, has a history of severe or poorly controlled asthma, 
or biphasic anaphylaxis.61 These factors will often present 
during a 4–6 hours observational period in the emergency 
room (or prior to arrival), thus the recommendation for 
transport and observation.
Biphasic anaphylaxis is a recurrence of anaphylactic 
symptoms after initial resolution despite no additional expo-
sure to the trigger. Previous reports suggested that this occurs 
in roughly 20% of anaphylactic episodes. However, a recent 
meta-analysis reveals that this likely occurs in ~5% of cases 
of anaphylaxis and is more likely to occur with initial severe 
symptoms or when anaphylaxis is not treated with epineph-
rine in a timely manner.62 It is well documented that patients, 
emergency responders, and even emergency room physicians 
do not always treat anaphylaxis with epinephrine, instead 
using antihistamines and/or corticosteroids.61 Unfortunately, 
these medications are not effective in treating anaphylaxis 
and should never be used in place of epinephrine.
Patients who may have the misconception that ED evalu-
ation is necessary due to the side effects from epinephrine, 
should be counseled about the need for monitoring and 
potential for progression of symptoms
Conclusion
Multiple studies across a variety of perspectives have dem-
onstrated a universal theme: Epinephrine is underused in the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Now that there is a solid basis of 
research demonstrating the need for improvement, we need 
interventional studies and quality improvement approaches 
to drive change. There are many areas in need of improve-
ment and it will take an ongoing concerted effort to see any 
positive changes. Improvement in these areas begins with 
increasing awareness among health care providers, patients, 
and the general public as well.
