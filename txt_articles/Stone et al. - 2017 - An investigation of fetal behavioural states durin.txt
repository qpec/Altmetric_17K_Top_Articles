Key points
r Fetal behavioural state in healthy late gestation pregnancy is significantly affected by maternal
position overnight.
r Maternal left lateral position is the one most frequently adopted at sleep onset.
r The maternal position at sleep onset is maintained the longest overnight.
r Fetal state 1F is more common in maternal supine positions overnight.
r Fetal state 4F is less common in maternal supine sleep positions.
r Fetal state and maternal sleep position are independently associated with fetal heart rate
variability.
r Maternal sleep position significantly affects fetal heart rate and heart rate variability and affects
circadian fetal heart rate patterns.
Abstract Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal wellbeing. Maternal position affects
FBS with supine position being associated with an increased likelihood of fetal quiescence
consistent with the human fetus adapting to a lower oxygen consuming state. Several studies
have now confirmed the association between sleep position and risk of late intrauterine death.
We designed this study to observe the effects of maternal sleep positions overnight in healthy late
gestationpregnancy.Twenty-ninehealthywomenhadcontinuousfetalECGrecordingsovernight.
Two blinded observers assigned fetal states in 5 min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate variability
(FHRV) were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Maternal position was determined from
infrared video recording. Compared to state 2F (active sleep), 4F (active awake-high activity)
occurred almost exclusively when the mother was in a left or right lateral position. State 1F (quiet
sleep) was more common when the mother was supine [odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.11–1.52] and less common on the maternal right side with the left being the
referent position (OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.70–0.93). State 4F was more common between 21.00 and
01.00 h than between 01.00 and 07.00 h (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.32–3.47). In each fetal state, maternal
position had significant effects on fetal heart rate and measures of FHRV. In healthy late gestation
pregnancy, maternal sleep position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are probably
fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.

Introduction
Maternal sleep position in late pregnancy is now
recognised as an important risk factor for stillbirth (Stacey
et al. 2011; Owusu et al. 2013; Gordon et al. 2015;
McCowan et al. 2017). Compared with commencing sleep
on the left side, the supine sleep position was found
to have an increased risk of stillbirth [adjusted odds
ratio (aOR) 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–6.18]
(Stacey et al. 2011). The mechanisms by which maternal
position could influence fetal outcome were unclear. A
hypothetical framework for late pregnancy stillbirth has
been proposed (Warland & Mitchell, 2014), in which
maternal sleep position acts as a stressor in an already
compromised situation with adverse feto-placental and
maternal factors. Although the reasons by which maternal
position may affect fetal outcome remain unclear, the
supine position may reduce maternal cardiac output
(Kinsella & Lohmann, 1994) and uteroplacental perfusion
(Pirhonen & Errkola, 1990; Jeffreys et al. 2006) and result
in a hypoxic stress for the fetus.
Recently we reported the results of a study designed
to assess the effects of different maternal positions on
fetal behavioural states (FBS) in healthy late gestation pre-
gnancies when the mother was awake under controlled
conditions (Stone et al. 2017). FBS are a marker of fetal
wellbeing (Romani & Rizzo, 1995; Martin, 2008) and the
development of autonomic nervous control of heart rate
(Brandle et al. 2015). FBS are patterns of physiological
and behavioural variables which are repetitive over time
and have clear changes from one state to another. FBS
may be defined as combinations of particular physio-
logical variables that are stable over a period of time and
recur (Martin, 2008). In the fetus at least three distinct
behavioural or activity states have been identified and
correspond to the early neonatal behavioural states 1
(quiet sleep – in the fetus termed 1F), 2 (active sleep
– fetal 2F), 3 (quiet awake 3F – in the fetus this is
very infrequent or not seen) and 4 (active awake 4F –
in the fetus a period of considerable fetal activity with
rapid heart rate and varying baseline fetal heart rate)
(Nijhuis et al. 1982). These become stable and consistent
by 36 weeks of gestation in healthy fetuses (Nijhuis et al.
1982; Nijhuis, 2003). Fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns have
been used to deduce the fetal state (Timor-Tritsch et al.
1978; Pillai & James, 1990a), which is reliably determined
by examination of the characteristics of the baseline FHR
patterns alone (Pillai & James, 1990b).
In our previous study in which the women were awake,
clear effects of maternal position on FBS were found, such
that compared to state 2F (the most frequently observed
state), state 4F (fetal activity with rapid heart rate and
varyingbaselineFHR)waslesslikelytooccurwhenwomen
were semi-recumbent or supine while state 1F (quiet sleep
with stable baseline FHR) was more common (Stone et al.
2017). Changes in FHR variability (FHRV) were also seen
when maternal position changed.
FHRV is a measure of cardiac autonomic control
and in the fetus it is made up of sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system activity as well as
intrinsic pacemaker rhythms of the sino-atrial node
(Jensen et al. 2009; Papaioannou et al. 2013). Sympathetic
activity is important in the maintenance of fetal blood
pressure, for example in periods of repeated asphyxia
(Galinsky et al. 2014; Lear et al. 2016). FHRV was assessed
as the standard deviation of the R-R interval (SDNN)
and the root mean square of successive differences (in
the R-R interval) (RMSSD). The SDNN is a measure of
total HRV, assessing all oscillations within the epoch inter-
rogated. The RMSSD is primarily sensitive to the total
magnitude of FHRV, but is sensitive to high-frequency
oscillations (Task Force of the European Society of Cardio-
logy and the North American Society of Pacing and
Electrophysiology, 1996; Lear et al. 2016). In the awake
studies, we limited the period of time the women were
supine to 30 min. We suggested that the observed changes
in FBS and FHRV, in particular in the supine position,
reflected appropriate fetal adaptation to adopt a lower
oxygen-consuming state in response to a mild change in
fetal oxygen tension. In contrast, moderate to severe hypo-
xia/asphyxia is associated with an autonomic adaptive
response and an initial increase in FHRV, which we did
not observe (Thaler et al. 1985). In overnight sleep studies,
which are the subject of this current study, maternal
position is determined spontaneously by the woman,
and not influenced by the investigator, so there was the
opportunity to investigate fetal responses as would occur
in maternal sleep in late pregnancy.
In this study, we aimed to assess the effects on fetal
behaviour of maternal sleep positions that occur during
sleep in late pregnancy. We then determined how both
maternal position and fetal state relate together with
respect to FHRV.

written informed consent. All studies approved by the
Northern Regional Human Ethics Committee conform to
the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was not registered
in a database.
Thirty healthy women aged �18 years with a
normal singleton pregnancy, late in the third trimester
(36–38 weeks of gestation), were recruited from low
risk midwifery care at the National Women’s Hospital,
Auckland, New Zealand. The fetal measurements failed in
one subject leaving 29 available for analysis.
Maternal exclusion criteria included: current smoking
or alcohol use, early pregnancy body mass index
(BMI) >30, any medical or obstetric complications
(e.g. pre-eclampsia, any known cardiovascular disorder,
including
hypertension
or
use
of
antihypertensive
treatments, respiratory or renal disorders, and all forms
of diabetes), not regularly attending scheduled obstetric
appointments,
any
orthopaedic
or
musculoskeletal
conditions which would make adopting different maternal
positions difficult and inadequate English language to
give informed consent. Fetal exclusion criteria included:
abnormal biometry for the gestation, reduced amniotic
fluid volume, abnormal umbilical arterial Doppler
measurements and multiple pregnancy. Birth outcome
data were collected to confirm the health status of the
mother and neonate.
Procedures
Participants were studied in their homes where researchers
set up the recording equipment. Participants were
instructed to sleep as normal with regards to bed time
and wake time, number of pillows and lighting.
A continuous fetal ECG, electrohysterogram and
maternal heart rate were recorded using the Monica AN24
ambulatory transabdominal fetal ECG device (Monica
Healthcare,Nottingham,UK).Skin preparation,electrode
placement and impedance testing were performed as per
the manufacturer’s instructions. The device recorded a
fetal ECG with true beat to beat intervals being recorded
in 1 min epochs without autocorrelation as used in
commercial cardiotocography (CTG) machines.
To confirm maternal position, video footage was
collected with a camcorder on a tripod (HDR-SR12E
Camcorder, Sony, Tokyo, Japan) with an external infrared
light (Sony HVL-IRM). Sleep onset was defined as
the first 3 min period with no movements, similar to
that used previously in an accelerometry study (Wrzus
et al. 2012). Position changes were therefore counted as
positions lasting 3 min or longer, with shorter duration
positions considered to be part of a transition between
sleep positions. Recording of fetal and maternal data
commenced as soon as the equipment was set up and
continued overnight until the participants or research
assistant removed it the following morning.
Data processing
The data from the Monica device were uploaded to a
PC with the Monica (VS) analysis software. The Monica
VS software uses beat to beat data to construct a fetal
cardiograph, which when combined with the hysterogram
produced a printout analogous to a standard CTG suitable
for interpreting FBS. The device records from three
channels and the interpolated sampling rate is 2.2 kHz
(Monica Healthcare).
The Monica has a built in proprietary algorithm to deal
with signal loss (any epoch with >30 s signal loss in the
1 min epochs used for the analysis of the raw ECG signal
is disregarded and no result is given for that epoch). The
manufacturer’s analysis program (Monica DK v1.9) was
used to calculate FHRV. The mean FHR was assessed for
each minute analysed from the time of sleep onset until
wakening. Each epoch was quantified by the mean FHR,
the SDNN and the RMSSD. Sleep position throughout
the night was categorised as left lateral, right lateral or
supine and determined from the video recording. The left
lateral position was used as the referent to which the other
positions were compared.
Fetal state was based on the classic features of the CTG as
described by Pillai & James (1990a). Briefly, the CTGs were
scored independently by two obstetricians (PS, WB), blind
to maternal position. Each block was scored for fetal state
as either 1F, 2F, 4F, transition or indeterminate using the
methods of Pillai and James. Consistent heart rate patterns
were defined as a state when the duration was at least
3 min. Our previous study (Stone et al. 2017) had shown
a high level of agreement between scorers. For this study,
the two obstetricians scored the CTGs independently. For
observations where there was disagreement, the scorers
reviewed the observations together, blind to the original
scoring, and where possible reached a consensus view.
These observations are those used in the analysis.
To assess the effect of time of night on FHR, we initially
assessed the plots of continuous data from the CTG, and
were unable to detect any circadian pattern. We then
calculated the mean heart rate per hour for each fetus
and calculated the difference between this and the average
for the whole sleep period from maternal sleep onset
until awakening. These were plotted against the time from
sleep onset with a smoothed spline curve fitted for each
individual as reported in previous studies (Visser et al.
1982; Lunshof et al. 1998).
Statistical analyses
Univariable analysis of the relationship between maternal
position and fetal state was assessed using a chi-square
statistic. Odds ratios to estimate the relationships between
maternal position and fetal state were assessed and were
consistent using simple logistic regression and binary

Logistic regression was carried out using Proc Logistic
and repeated measures using Proc GLIMMIX using a
random effect for the intercept and time was fitted with
an autoregressive [AR(1)] correlation structure.
Analysis of differences in measures of FHRV were
carried out using generalised linear models (Proc
GLIMMIX) to test for differences in measures between
fetal state and maternal position, and then to test for
differences in measures by maternal position stratified by
fetal state.
All analyses were carried out in SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Thirty healthy pregnant women at a median of 37 weeks
of gestation (range 36–38 weeks) participated in the study
and there were data suitable for analysis from 29 sub-
jects. Characteristics of the subjects and birth outcomes
are shown in Table 1. On the night of the study in 14 of
the 30 subjects, the bed partners did not participate and
slept in a different room.
At the 6 week postnatal check all babies were healthy.
There were no recognised congenital anomalies.
Maternal sleep and sleep position data
The time of sleep onset had a median of 22.21 h in
the evening [interquartile range (IQR) 22.57, 22.43). The
median wake time was 07.01 h (IQR 06.34, 07.15). The
median sleep duration was 8 h and 14 min (IQR 7:28,
8:50). The timing of rising to go to the toilet was spread
widely throughout the night.
A description of maternal sleep characteristics is shown
in Table 2.
The left lateral position was most frequently adopted
at sleep onset and most women spent more than half the
night in the left lateral position. The position adopted
at commencement of sleep was maintained the longest

Risks are estimated from a repeated measures analysis with a

confidence intervals.
Taking into account within-subject effects, Table 4
shows the results of repeated measures analyses. These
confirmed that 1F was more common when the mother
was in the supine position (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11–1.52)
and less common on the right side (OR 0.81, 95% CI
0.70–0.93), with the left side being the referent position,
as shown in Table 4. 4F was increased on the right side and
much less common in the supine position.
Effect of time of night on fetal behavioural state
Fetal activity has been reported to be greatest in the
evening (Patrick et al. 1982b; Ehrstrom, 1984), and the
effect of time of night on FBS was investigated. Of
the time spent in 4F, the majority of it (56.6%) occurred
in the time from 21.00 to 01.00 h. When time from sleep
onset (as a continuous variable) was added to the above
model there was no significant effect, although adding
time as a categorical variable showed that compared to
2F, 4F remained more likely in the early part of the night
(OR = 2.83, 95% CI 2.32, 3.47). State 1F was slightly less
likely to occur in the early part of the night compared to
2F (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.67, 0.87).
Effect of fetal state on measures of FHR and heart
rate variability
Theeffectsoffetalstateandmaternalpositiononmeasures
of FHR and variability in univariable analysis are shown in
Table 5. Compared with state 2F (the referent state), FHR
was lower in 1F and higher in 4F. SDNN was significantly
reduced in 1F (45% decrease) and to a lesser extent in 4F
(17%) compared with 2F. RMSSD was also decreased in
both1F(9%)andtoagreaterextentin4F(29%)compared
to 2F.
When the effect of maternal position was analysed,
compared with the left side, supine was associated with
a small but statistically significant increase in FHR. Both
right and supine were associated with reductions in SDNN
and for supine a decrease in RMSSD. In a multivariable
model containing both fetal state and maternal position,
both remained significant, thus suggesting that they are
independently associated with FHRV.
Interactions between maternal position and fetal state
were tested for each of the outcomes: FHR (P = 0.0054),
SDNN (P = 0.0001) and RMSSD (P = 0.06), suggesting
that the effects of fetal state on measures of variability are
modified by maternal position.
The results of this analysis of the combined effects of
state and position are shown in Table 6.
Table 6 shows that in each state, maternal position had a
statistically significant effect on FHR. Compared with the
left side (as referent) the supine position was associated
with increases in FHR in all states, but these increases were
larger in 4F and 1F. The effect on SDNN was particularly
seen when the mother was in the right in 1F and supine
in 2F. The effects of maternal position on RMSSD show
decreases in RMSSD in 1F and 2F when supine, and in 1F
on the right. Power was limited to detect differences in 4F
due to the small amount of time in this state.
Plots of mean FHR per hour overnight did not show
a consistent pattern across subjects. For illustrative
purposes, the heart rate overnight from sleep onset,
maternal position and FBS are shown together in Fig. 1.
This fetus had only a short period in 4F after sleep onset.
The woman underwent a number of position changes
and spent more time supine than most other women in
this study. Most of the 1F occurred when the woman was
supine.
Discussion
In this study of healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal
position overnight had a significant effect on fetal
behavioural state. In late pregnancy, the women in this
study were most likely to commence sleep in a lateral
position and maintain this position for the longest time,
both initially and throughout the night. This initial period
also corresponds to the period of most activity in the fetus.
State 4F occurred almost exclusively in maternal lateral
positions and also in the early part of the night, which is
also the time when sleep position was most stable. After
01.00 h, 4F was infrequent. 4F was rarely observed in the
supine position, with 1F being more likely.
Our results have shown that time of night significantly
influenced the likelihood of the fetus being in a particular
state, with 4F being more likely in the early part of the
night and 1F less likely then and more likely later after
sleep onset. This may be due in part to the maternal
position effects where position change, most often from
non-supine to supine sleep, occurred after the period of
most stable sleep. We also found that the effects of fetal
state on measures of FHRV were modified by maternal
position, probably mediated through autonomic nervous
system activity. This further supports the concept that
maternal position is an important modulator of circadian
effects on FHR. It would appear probable that the position
effects seen in our previous studies (Stone et al. 2017)

are also occurring overnight during maternal sleep. We
suggest that maternal position change may affect the
circadian pattern of FHR overnight.
We initially expected that any changes in FHRV would
be mediated by altered behavioural state. However, our
multivariate analysis showed that both maternal position
and fetal sleep state independently influenced FHRV, and
our hypothesis was therefore too simplistic. What this
highlights is that FBS are not uniform, but instead that the
degree of activity in each state can be influenced by outside
influences. Our findings therefore probably reflect that in

A study of subjective recording of fetal movements
in two groups of women, one group recording during
daytimeandtheotheratnight(Ehrstrom,1984),described
a pattern of nocturnal fetal activity which was consistent
with our findings and also showed more variation
in hourly frequency during the day, which suggested
that maternal activity or exogenous stimuli influenced
fetal movements or at least their perception. We would
speculate therefore that the maternal position effects we
have seen could be considered an exogenous stimulus that
may modify endogenous rhythms by creating a mild hypo-
xia stress secondary to changes in uteroplacental perfusion
when the woman is supine.
Our observations in this in-home sleep study are
consistent with findings from our experimental laboratory
study recently reported (Stone et al. 2017) in which
maternal position was controlled and randomly allocated
between the supine, semi-recumbent, right and left lateral.
In that study, whilst the subjects were awake, maternal
supine position was associated with an increased time in
1F, almost no time in 4F, and increased likelihood of fetal
state change when compared with the referent left lateral
position. This overnight study reflects the fetal response
to spontaneously adopted maternal position.
With the exception of one fetus, the FHR changes
over night did not appear to show a clear circadian
pattern. A study of 26 healthy pregnancies from 26 to

Fetal behavioural states during maternal sleep in late pregnancy

38 weeks of gestation under laboratory conditions found
that circadian rhythms in basal FHR were present in
73% of fetuses whereas only 30–50% of fetuses showed
circadian patterns of FHRV and activity (Lunshof et al.
1998). Ultradian rest activity cycles may well dominate
an immature fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (the circadian
oscillator) and be the reason why diurnal rhythms in
FHR parameters are not seen in all fetuses (Lunshof et al.
1998). In a longitudinal study of fetal body movements
performed at a consistent time of the day, Ten Hof et al.
(2002) found that there was intrafetal consistency with
fetal behaviours over advancing gestation but very large
interfetal differences such that the authors concluded that
interpretations of changes needed to be individualised to
each fetus.
Wedonotknowwhethertheeffectsofmaternalposition
would override circadian effects of maternal physiology
including heart rate variability and perhaps temperature
on fetal physiology. It is not possible to record fetal
circadian rhythms in the absence of maternal influences,
but it may be possible to examine the results of maternal
sleep behaviours on fetal physiology. Disturbed sleep in
late pregnancy with awakening and rising to micturate
or due to discomfort may well affect maternal circadian
rhythms and those of the fetus (Sadeh, 1997; Seron-Ferre
etal.2007).Ourdatafailedtoshowanovernightreduction
in FHR as part of a circadian pattern in heart rate or heart
rate variability parameters. The examination of individual
FHR patterns revealed no recognisably consistent changes
during the night when a nadir in FHR had been reported
(Patrick et al. 1982a; Lunshof et al. 1998). In the one fetus
in our study which did show a pattern which could be
consistent with a circadian one, the magnitude of heart
rate changes over the night was similar to that seen by
Lunshof et al. (1998). A study of 10 healthy near term pre-
gnant women suggested a diurnal variation in FHR with
large changes in high pulse variation in the beat to beat
heart rate interval in the late evening around midnight
(Visser et al. 1982). An examination of the FHR patterns
from that report would be consistent with the behavioural
state patterns that we have seen, although the authors did
not define the patterns as fetal states.
There does not appear to be an clear explanation for
the differences between those studies and our own, but
we speculate that in late pregnancy, women’s sleep is
disrupted, especially in the early hours of the morning
whengettinguptopassurineiscommon.Suchnon-photic
influences are likely to have at least some effect on
circadian rhythms in the mother (Mistlberger & Skene,
2004) and possibly also the fetus. All other aspects
including normality of the pregnancies, gestational age
at assessment, and times of going to sleep and awakening
would appear to have been similar to the studies quoted.
Whilst we did not measure maternal plasma adreno-
corticosteroid or melatonin levels, we have no reason to
believe that these would not be normal in our subjects.
Consistent with the ultrasound studies of Patrick et al.
(1982b), we did find that there was more fetal activity and
state 4F during the later evening with little or no 4F from
around 01.00 h. In a study including gestations from 28 to
39 weeks, Roberts et al. (1979) observed a well-defined
circadian variation in fetal activity with FBM peaking

between 19.00 and 22.00 h, and fetal trunk movements
between 22.00 and 01.00 h. This is consistent with the
findings of Patrick et al. (1982b) and suggest that our
study encompassed times where the fetus would have had
most gross body movement.
The findings in our study of healthy late gestation preg-
nancy are consistent with the concept that state changes
can occur as an adaptive response and shift the
fetus to a lower oxygen-consuming state. Decreased
fetal movements are associated with adverse pregnancy
outcomes including hypoxia at birth or stillbirth (Heazell
&Froen,2008).Ithasbeenfurthersuggestedthatplacentae
from pregnancies affected by reduced fetal movements
are associated with abnormal placental structure and
impaired placental function (Warrander et al. 2011).
Maternal perception of fetal movements is widely used
as a marker of fetal viability and wellbeing. Whilst none
of the women in our study reported changes in fetal
movements, the FBS was affected by maternal position
with fetal quiescence being more likely when the mother
was supine. We suggest that this is due to reduced placental
perfusion leading to short-term or mild fetal hypoxia,
whichinacompromisedfetussuchasingrowthrestriction
(Staceyetal.2012)orinthepresenceofstructuralplacental
abnormality (Man et al. 2016) may lead to intrauterine
demise. Our observational study of healthy low-risk pre-
gnant women close to term suggests that a healthy fetus
appears able to change to 1F to cope with a mildly hypoxic
stress.
Given our results and those of case controlled
epidemiological studies reporting the effect of sleep
position in risk of stillbirth (Stacey et al. 2011; Owusu et al.
2013;Gordonetal.2015;McCowanetal.2017),wesuggest
that trials of interventions to reduce supine sleeping in the
third trimester of pregnancy are warranted. Our findings
suggest that a supine sleep position is disadvantageous
even to the healthy late gestation fetus, but whether left
or right lateral positions have significantly different effects
on fetal behaviour is unclear and is the subject of further
research by this group.

Translational perspective
Late stillbirth is independently related to the position women adopt during sleep. We hypothesised
that fetal behavioural state as an indicator of fetal welfare would be affected by maternal position. We
studied 29 healthy normal singleton pregnancies overnight between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation and
examined the effects of spontaneously adopted maternal positions of fetal behavioural state, which was
determined by blinded assessment of fetal heart rate patterns. The results show that in normal healthy
third trimester pregnancy, maternal position influences the behavioural state of the fetus. Changes
were also seen in measures of fetal heart rate variability, a marker of autonomic responsiveness.
Compared with being in state 2F in the left lateral position, there was a 30% increased chance of the
fetus being in 1F and over a 60% reduction in 4F during supine sleep. A switch to state 1F or fetal
quiescence when the mother is supine suggests the fetus is adopting a low oxygen-consuming state.
The results offer insights into fetal activity overnight and the physiological mechanisms that the fetus
may utilise to adapt to the effects of maternal sleep position. We speculate that the findings may be due
to reduced uterine perfusion and that vulnerable fetuses, which may already be hypoxic, are unable
to adapt to the stressor of maternal supine position. We suggest that trials of interventions to reduce
supine sleeping in the third trimester of pregnancy are warranted.
