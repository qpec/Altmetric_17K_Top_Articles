The design of precision, preclinical therapeutics from sequence is
difficult, but advances in this area, particularly those focused on
rational design, could quickly transform the sequence of disease-
causing gene products into lead modalities. Herein, we describe
the use of Inforna, a computational approach that enables the
rational design of small molecules targeting RNA to quickly provide
a potent modulator of oncogenic microRNA-96 (miR-96). We mined
the secondary structure of primary microRNA-96 (pri-miR-96) hairpin
precursor against a database of RNA motif–small molecule interac-
tions, which identified modules that bound RNA motifs nearby and in
the Drosha processing site. Precise linking of these modules together
provided Targaprimir-96 (3), which selectively modulates miR-96 pro-
duction in cancer cells and triggers apoptosis. Importantly, the com-
pound is ineffective on healthy breast cells, and exogenous
overexpression of pri-miR-96 reduced compound potency in breast
cancer cells. Chemical Cross-Linking and Isolation by Pull-Down
(Chem-CLIP), a small-molecule RNA target validation approach,
shows that 3 directly engages pri-miR-96 in breast cancer cells. In
vivo, 3 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and decreases tu-
mor burden in a mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer.
Thus, rational design can quickly produce precision, in vivo bio-
active lead small molecules against hard-to-treat cancers by target-
ing oncogenic noncoding RNAs, advancing a disease-to-gene-to-
drug paradigm.

any disease association studies have identified biomolecules
that, if targeted selectively, could be exploited to provide
precision lead therapeutics. Generally, drug-like compounds are
screened to discover modulators of the protein products of genes,
particularly enzymes (1). However, evidence is emerging that
RNA is an attractive and unexploited target for precise medicine
strategies. One major implication of the Encyclopedia Of DNA
Elements (ENCODE) project was that noncoding RNAs play
major roles in human biology, including disease biology (2). Fur-
thermore, sequencing techniques that directly report the identity
and abundance of RNAs (3, 4) have revealed many potentially
druggable RNAs that are differentially expressed in healthy and
disease-affected tissue, for which a precision medicine approach
could be ideal.
Outside of the bacterial ribosome, however, RNA is considered
undruggable with small molecules because of the difficulty in
identifying high-affinity, selective compounds. Despite this chal-
lenge, there are many advantages of targeting RNA with small
molecules. For example, RNA secondary structure can be rapidly
annotated from sequence (5–9), thereby identifying functional re-
gions that could be inactivated by small molecule binding. We
reasoned that gene expression data could be quickly converted into
precise, lead therapeutic modalities by combining these methods
with rational design strategies.
As part of a program to rationally drug RNAs from sequence,
we established a database of RNA motif–small molecule binding
partners (10). The database is comprised of privileged interactions
identified by a library vs. library screen named 2D combinatorial
screening (2DCS) (11, 12). In 2DCS, a library of array-immobilized
small molecules is probed for binding to a library of small RNA
motifs that are likely to be present in biological RNAs (11, 12).
These interactions are then mined against genomic RNAs to
provide lead therapeutics in a target agnostic manner by Inforna
(10), a computational approach developed in our laboratory. That
is, Inforna parses RNA secondary structures, regardless of whether
they are determined by phylogeny, structural methods, or compu-
tation, and compares them with the RNA motif–small molecule
database. Overlap provides lead compounds. Previously, Inforna
identified the lead benzimidazole 1, which avidly bound to the
RNA motif present in a Drosha nuclease-processing site in the
microRNA-96 (miR-96) hairpin precursor (10), an oncogenic
microRNA (miRNA) implicated in breast cancer (13). This
miRNA suppresses the production of proapoptotic forkhead box
O1 (FOXO1) protein in cancer cells. Targeting the miRNA with
an oligonucleotide (an antagomir) or compound 1 selectively in-
hibits production of mature miR-96 and triggers apoptosis in breast
cancer cells at micromolar concentrations (10, 13).
Herein, we used Inforna for the facile lead optimization of 1,
providing highly potent compounds that impede tumorigenesis
in vivo. Inforna identified that a bis-benzimidazole (2) bound to a
1 nt × 1 nt internal loop adjacent to the Drosha site bound by
1 (Fig. 1). The optimal dimeric compound that targets both sites,
Targaprimir-96 (3), binds primary microRNA-96 (pri-miR-96)
with low nanomolar affinity (>40-fold more avidly than 1) and is
>400-fold more potent than 1 for inhibiting miR-96 biogenesis in
breast cancer cells. The effect of 3 is specific to breast cancer cells,
because nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells are unaffected.
Furthermore, target validation studies using Chemical Cross-
Linking and Isolation by Pull-Down (Chem-CLIP) (14, 15)
Significance
The goal of precision medicine is to identify selective drugs that
modulate disease-causing biomolecules. This slow process often
involves developing a high-throughput screen to test millions of
potential drugs to find a few that affect the biomolecule. Here,
we describe a facile approach using a disease-causing biomole-
cule’s sequence to enable design of specific drugs, eliminating
arduous and time-consuming screens. By using the sequence of a
non–protein-coding, oncogenic RNA, we designed a drug spe-
cifically targeting the RNA’s folded structure. In cells and ani-
mals, the drug inhibits its target, killing cancer cells while leaving
healthy cells unaffected. Thus, a preclinical anticancer drug
candidate can be quickly designed from sequence.

 demonstrate that 3 engages pri-miR-96 in cells, and rescue ex-
periments are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action
of 3. Compound 3 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in
mice, and thus we studied the effect of the compound on tumor
growth in an in vivo preclinical model of triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC). Indeed, 3 inhibited tumor growth, showing that it
is possible to target oncogenic noncoding RNAs through small
molecules as a potential treatment for breast cancer.
Results and Discussion
Rational Design of a Dimeric Compound That Targets pri-miR-96.
Previously, 1 was found to precisely target the Drosha site in the
miR-96 hairpin precursor (Fig. 1 A and B), inhibiting its bio-
genesis, derepressing downstream targets, and triggering apoptosis
in breast cancer cells (10). However, this compound had micro-
molar activity, limiting its applicability in vivo. To optimize 1 to
provide a more potent modulator of miRNA dysfunction, we used
Inforna to mine the pri-miRNA’s secondary structure in an at-
tempt to identify small molecule “modules” that are predicted to
bind motifs nearby the Drosha processing site where 1 binds (Fig.
1A). Indeed, Inforna predicted that compound 2, a bis-benzimid-
azole, binds to the 1 × 1 GG internal loop adjacent to the Drosha
site (Fig. 1 A and B). Thus, we used 1 and 2 as modules to design a
dimeric compound that would enhance the avidity of the com-
pounds for pri-miR-96 and hence, its potency (Fig. 1C).
Previously, we have shown that dimeric compounds can be
designed to bind adjacent motifs simultaneously in an RNA by
using spacing rules to span different distances (16). Such a
multivalent approach has been shown to improve avidity and
potency to study and manipulate biology in many systems (17–23).
For example, a modular approach has been transformationally
applied to target the DNA minor groove with polyamides by using
eponymous Dervan rules (24). An analogous modular approach
for small molecules targeting RNA is emerging and has provided a
rapid enhancement of affinity and selectivity, because molecular
recognition depends on the identity of the RNA-binding modules,
their RNA-binding preferences, and the spacing between the
modules (20).
We, therefore, designed a small library of dimers in which the
distance between 1 and 2 was varied. Previous studies on spacing
rules for targeting RNA internal loops separated by different
distances showed that two to four propylamine spacing modules
spanned the distance between two internal loops separated by
2 bp (16, 20), the same distance separating the 1 × 1 GG internal
loop targeted by 2 and the Drosha site targeted by 1. We screened
the library of dimers for their ability to inhibit biogenesis of miR-
96 in MDA-MB-231 cells, a model of TNBC (Fig. 2). As antici-
pated, these studies showed that two propylamine spacers between
the RNA-binding modules provided the most potent compound,
which we named Targaprimir-96 (3; indicating that the compound
targets a pri-miRNA and pri-miR-96 in particular).
We next performed a dose–response of 3 by assessing the
reduction of mature miR-96 levels and determined an IC50 of
∼50 nM (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Because 3 was designed to inhibit
Drosha processing, we also studied the effect of the compound
on pri- and precursor microRNA-96 (pre-miR-96) levels. As
expected, treatment of TNBC with 3 boosted the amount of the
pri-miRNA and decreased the levels of the pre-miRNA and
mature miRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and SI
Appendix, Fig. S1). We further assessed inhibition of pri-miR-96
processing by 3 in vitro. Using a radioactively labeled model of pri-
miR-96 and cell extracts in which Drosha was overexpressed, 3
inhibited cleavage of pri-miR-96 at low-nanomolar concentrations
(Fig. 2B), thus validating that the compound binds the desired
sites in the miRNA precursor. Furthermore, nanomolar concen-
trations of 3 protected the predicted binding site from cleavage by
S1 nuclease, which supports the observed in vitro activity and es-
tablishes the binding site of 3 (Fig. 2C).
The binding affinities of 3 for various RNAs and DNAs were
measured to assess the bonus in avidity that the dimeric com-
pound provides over monomers 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
These studies showed that 1 bound to the motif in miR-96’s
Drosha processing site (RNA1) (Fig. 3) with a Kd of 1,300 nM.
Mutation of the UU loop to an AU pair (RNAC) eliminates binding.
Likewise, our binding studies show that 2 binds the desired 1 × 1
GG loop (RNA2) with a Kd of 1,500 nM but does not bind to
RNA1 or control RNAC. We also measured the affinities of 1 and
2 to a model RNA that contains both the Drosha target site for
1 and the adjacent target site for 2 (RNA3) (Fig. 3), affording Kd
values of 3,400 and 2,700 nM, respectively.
Dimeric 3 binds RNA3 with a Kd of 85 nM, an increase of ∼40-
fold relative to monomer 1 and ∼30-fold relative to 2. As expected,
3 forms a 1:1 complex with RNA3 as assessed by a Jobs plot (25),
indicating that the compound binds both internal loops simulta-
neously (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Mutation of the GG or UU loop
to a base pair reduces binding affinity to afford Kd values of
Fig. 1.
Inforna enabled a structure-based approach to rationally design a
high-affinity, dimeric small molecule that targets the oncogenic miR-96 hairpin
precursor. (A) Structure of the miR-96 hairpin precursor. The mature miRNA is

most potent inhibitor of miR-96 processing.

 ∼1,200 nM (GG to GC mutation; RNA4) and ∼1,500 nM (UU to
UA mutation; RNA5), similar to the affinities of the respective
monomers. The cellular environment is best mimicked by using
molecular crowding agents, and addition of these agents can
affect the binding of ligands to RNA (26). Thus, binding of 3 to
RNA3 was measured in the presence of PEG 8000, which
afforded a Kd of 20 nM or a fourfold enhancement.
Because selective binding of small molecules to RNA over
DNA is an important consideration, we measured the affinities of
1, 2, and 3 for an AT-rich DNA hairpin (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
Although 3 does not bind to the DNA hairpin (Kd > 50,000 nM),
2 binds to this DNA with a Kd of 200 nM. Thus, appendage of 2 to
1, a molecule that does not bind DNA because it has bulky t-butyl
groups (12, 27), ablates the binding of 3 to DNA. Taken together,
control of target binding in multivalent ligands depends on the
identity of the modules individually and collectively and the dis-
tance between them, which has been previously observed (20, 28).
Collectively, these rigorous binding analyses show that 3 is
highly RNA-selective and recognizes both the 1 × 1 nt GG and 1 ×
1 nt UU loops to provide high affinity, effectively discriminating
against a variety of related targets.
Targaprimir-96 Triggers Apoptosis in TNBC. Various experiments
were completed to assess the biological impact of 3. In MDA-MB-
231 TNBC cells, 50 nM compound selectively inhibited biogenesis
of the miR-96 hairpin precursor (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig.
S1). Previously, it was shown that miR-96 contributes to cancer by
silencing FOXO1 mRNA’s translation (13). Thus, the effect of the
compound on FOXO1 protein expression was assessed. These
studies showed that treatment with 50 nM 3 boosted expression of
FOXO1 by approximately twofold (Fig. 4A). Additionally, 3 trig-
gered early apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells as assessed by Annexin
V staining but had no significant effect on a nontumorigenic mam-
mary epithelial cell line (MCF 10A) (Fig. 4B).
The selectivity of 3 for triggering apoptosis through the miR-
96 circuit was assessed in two ways: (i) by forced overexpression
of the target followed by compound treatment and (ii) by profiling of
other miRNAs predicted to regulate FOXO1 expression. The
amount of apoptosis triggered by 3 in cells that overexpressed pri-
miR-96 was significantly diminished (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the
compound triggers apoptosis by inhibiting miR-96 biogenesis.
Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we profiled the
effect of 3 (50 nM) on the levels of miRNAs that have potential
to modulate FOXO1 mRNA (n = 16), including miR-27a and
miR-182 (transcribed as a cluster with miR-96), which were
previously shown to silence FOXO1 expression in breast cancer
cells (13). Among these miRNAs, only miR-96 expression was
affected (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that down-regulation of
miR-96 is sufficient to increase FOXO1 expression and induce
apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, 3 can counteract the effects
of a single miRNA to promote cancer cell death.
We next studied the potency of 3 in breast cancer cell line 4175
derived from MDA-MB-231, which has been selected to me-
tastasize to the lung (Fig. 5) (29). In agreement with our studies
in MDA-MB-231, 3 (50 nM) inhibits biogenesis of miR-96 as
determined by measurement of mature (decreased), pre-miR-96
(decreased), and pri-miR-96 (increased) levels (Fig. 5A). Fur-
thermore, treatment with 3 increases FOXO1 levels (Fig. 5B)
and triggers apoptosis (Fig. 5C), whereas forced expression of
pri-miR-96 decreases the ability of 3 to induce apoptosis (Fig.
5C). As observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, among 16 miRNAs with
potential to regulate FOXO1 levels, only miR-96 is affected
(Fig. 5D).
Target Engagement in Cells by Chem-CLIP and Competitive Chem-CLIP.
To determine if pri-miR-96 is a direct cellular target of 3, we used
Chem-CLIP and Competitive Chem-CLIP (C-Chem-CLIP). In
these approaches, small molecules that target RNA are appended
with a nucleic acid reactive module that allows small molecules to
be conjugated to their cellular RNA targets. Additionally, the
compound is appended with a biotin module that allows for iso-
lation of biotinylated products. Thus, Chem-CLIP is a steady-state
experiment, whereby cross-linking could trap the intended and
other transient interactions, because the products are stable once
cross-linked. To enable these approaches, Targaprimir-96-CA-
Biotin (4) was synthesized (Fig. 6A). Indeed, 4 selectively reacts
with pri-miR-96 in vitro (Fig. 6B). A control compound, in which
the RNA-binding modules are removed [2p-CA-Biotin (5)] (Fig.
6A) does not react with pri-miR-96 (Fig. 6B). Application of
50 nM 4 to MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and quantification
of the isolated targets showed an approximately fivefold enrich-
ment of pri-miR-96 (Fig. 6C).
In C-Chem-CLIP, cells are cotreated with the Chem-CLIP
probe and the unreactive parent compound. Cellular targets that
are bound selectively by the parent compound are depleted in
the pull-down. That is, C-Chem-CLIP accounts for nonselective
effects due to the cross-linking and purification modules. As
expected, 3 reduces the amount of pri-miR-96 pulled down by
4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C).
Pharmacological Testing of 3. Because we were interested in the
in vivo application of 3, its mutagenicity was measured by an Ames
test (30, 31). There is potential for any compound that binds

RNAC is a control RNA that does not contain target sites for 1 or 2 and has a
single-nucleotide change relative to RNA1. RNA1 contains the motif present
in the Drosha processing site of pri-miR-96. RNA2 contains the 1 × 1 nt GG
internal loop that is adjacent to the Drosha site. RNA3 contains both the
Drosha site and the adjacent 1 × 1 nt GG internal loop. RNA4 contains the
UU internal loop present in the Drosha site and a single-nucleotide change
to mutate the 1 × 1 nt GG internal loop to a GC pair. RNA5 contains the GG
internal loop, but the UU loop has been mutated to an AU pair.

 nucleic acids to be mutagenic, which would limit therapeutic po-
tential. Fortuitously, 3 was negative throughout the Ames test and
is thus not mutagenic under the conditions and strains evaluated
(Fig. 7A).
Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics Analysis of 3. Compound 3
is a dimeric compound that has a greater molecular weight than
small molecules that obey the guidelines by Lipinski et al. (32) for
small molecule drug development. Because of this potential lia-
bility, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) studies
were completed in vivo. Mice were treated with different con-
centrations of compound (2 or 7 mg/kg) by i.p. injection, and the
amount of intact compound in blood plasma was measured as a
function of time. For both doses, the amount of intact compound
in plasma peaks at ∼4 h (Fig. 7B). Importantly, even 48 h post-
injection, the concentration of 3 remaining in plasma is much
greater than the 50 nM cellular concentration that triggered ap-
optosis: 1.6 μM for the 2 mg/kg dosage and 1.9 μM for the 7 mg/kg
dosage (Figs. 4B and 7B). Thus, 3 has great potential to be bio-
active in vivo.
Targaprimir-96 (3) Inhibits Tumor Growth in a Mouse Model of TNBC.
Collectively, our cellular and DMPK data indicate that 3 has
potential to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Nod/SCID mice were
injected with a variant of MDA-MB-231 that expresses lucifer-
ase, or MDA-MB-231-luc, and allowed to develop tumors. After
tumor development, mice were treated with 3 (10 mg/kg) every
other day over the course of 21 d. Indeed, 3 significantly decreased
tumor growth as assessed by both luciferase measurements and
the size and weight of the excised tumor (Fig. 8 A and B). In
agreement with cellular assays (Figs. 2A and 4A), profiling of the
tumors showed that addition of 3 decreased levels of mature miR-
96 by ∼50% and increased levels of pri-miR-96 (Fig. 8C), with a
concomitant increase of FOXO1 (Fig. 8C). Furthermore, no
toxicity was observed. These studies suggest that small molecules
that target miRNAs in vivo have promise not only as chemical
probes of RNA function, but also as future anticancer therapeutics.
Conclusions and Outlook. One goal of precision medicine is to
assess the gene expression profile of disease-affected tissues and
tailor patient treatment accordingly. Gene expression studies on
tumor biopsies can quickly provide accurate information on genes
that are up-regulated by measuring RNA levels. The most com-
mon way to directly target disease-associated RNAs is with oli-
gonucleotide-based therapeutics that recognize RNAs by using
Watson–Crick base pairing (33–35). Recognition of RNA targets
by using sequence complementarity is a powerful technology, but
one that still has obstacles to overcome. Herein, we present a
complementary strategy, in which RNA structures are targeted
with designer small molecules.
By using Inforna to identify multiple sites in a target that can be
bound by small molecules and multivalency to design precision
compounds that accommodate these sites simultaneously, an in vivo
active compound targeting an oncogenic miRNA was identified.
The observation that designer approaches can allow the rapid
identification and subsequent lead optimization of bioactive com-
pounds bodes well for the approach having broad utility for many
other disease-associated RNAs that have a folded structure re-
quired for biological activity. Importantly, these studies also advance
a paradigm, in which a disease-associated RNA is validated and its
structure is used to design and optimize small molecules in rapid
fashion. The applicability of this approach to other targets is likely to
be enhanced as more information on the RNA motifs that bind small
molecules is acquired, which could be enabled by 2DCS (11, 36).

 Materials and Methods
General Methods. General experimental procedures are given in the
SI Appendix.
RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR of miRs. Total RNA was extracted from cells that
were cultured in either 6- or 12-well plates using a Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit
(Zymo Research) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Approximately 200 ng of total
RNA was used in reverse transcription (RT) reactions, which were completed
using a miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR was
performed on a 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem) using
Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). All primer sets were pur-
chased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) or Eurofins (SI Appendix, Table
S1). The expression levels of mature miRNAs, pre-miR-96, and pri-miR-96 were
normalized to U6 small nuclear RNA.
Chem-CLIP and C-Chem-CLIP. Cells were cultured as described above in a
100-mm dish and treated with either 50 nM 4 (Chem-CLIP) or 50 nM 4 and 1 or
5 μM 3 (C-Chem-CLIP) for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Ambion) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Approximately 30 μg of total
RNA was used for pull-down by incubating with 50 μL of high-capacity
streptavidin agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) in 1× phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl,
pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the su-
pernatant was removed, and the resin was washed with 1× PBS twice. RNA
was eluted from the streptavidin beads by incubation with 100 μL of 1×
Elution Buffer [10 mM EDTA, and 95% (vol/vol) formamide] at 65 °C for
20 min. The eluted RNA was cleaned up using the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit
per the manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR was completed simultaneously for
pri-miR-96 and 18S rRNA as described above using 50 ng of total RNA in the
RT reaction. Expression levels of pri-miR-96 were normalized to 18S rRNA
before and after pull-down by using the ΔΔCt (cycle threshold) method, and
the ratio of their expression levels afforded enrichment.
Reaction of 4 and 5. To determine if 4 or 5 reacts with the miR-96 hairpin
precursor in vitro, 5 μL of 32P-labeled miR-96 hairpin precursor (∼50,000 cpm)
was diluted in a total volume of 300 μL 1× PBS. The RNA was folded by
heating at 60 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. Com-
pound was then added at various concentrations, and the solutions were
incubated for at least 4 h at room temperature. Next, 10 μL of streptavidin
resin was added to the samples, which were incubated for an additional
30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
removed, and the resin was washed with 1× PBS supplemented with 0.1%
(vol/vol) Tween 20. The amount of radioactivity in the supernatant and wash
and associated with the beads was measured using a Beckman Coulter
LS6500 Liquid Scintillation Counter.
Ames Test. Mutagenicity was evaluated using the MUTA-ChromoPlate Kit
(Environmental Bio-Detection Products Inc.) according to manufacturer’s
suggested protocol. Two strains of Salmonella typhimurium were used to
detect frameshift mutations (TA98) and base pair substitutions (TA100). Mu-
tagenic potential was studied in the presence (+S9) and absence (−S9) of rat
liver extract S9. Nitrofluorene, amino anthracene, and sodium azide were used

Pharmacological profiling of 3 for mutational liability and stability.
(A) Results of the Ames test, which measures the mutagenicity of a compound
and thus, its potential to cause cancer. TA98 and TA100 are two strains of
S. typhimurium; +S9 and −S9 indicate the presence and absence of rat liver
extract S9, respectively. Nitrofluorene, amino anthracene, and sodium azide
were used as positive controls. (B) Amount of 3 in mouse plasma as a function
of time after i.p. injection of 2 and 7 mg/kg compound.

(C) Chem-CLIP and C-Chem-CLIP profiling in MDA-MB-231 cells and quantifi-
cation by qRT-PCR showing that 4 enriches the pri-miR-96 target in the pull-
down. Coaddition of 3 (1,000 or 5,000 nM) and 4 (50 nM) depleted the amount
of pri-miR-96 in the pull-down. Error bars are the SDs in the measurements.

 as positive controls. Mutagenicity was evaluated after 5 d of 3 exposure, which
was tested at 10, 2, 0.4, 0.08, 0.02, 0.003, and 0.006 μM (n = 6 each).
DMPK Studies. A six-mouse mini-pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment was used
to determine the PK profile of 3. FVB/n mice were dosed i.p. with 3 at 2 or 7
mg/kg with 25-μL blood draws at indicated time points. Drug levels were
determined by liquid chromotography/MS-MS using an ABSciex 5500.
Assessing Potency of 3 in Mouse Xenograft Model of TNBC. NOD/Scid mice (B6.
CB17-Prkdcscid/Sz; Jackson Labs) were housed in the Scripps Florida vivarium,
and all experiments using live animals were approved by the Scripps Florida
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female mice (n = 10; 5–7 wk
old) were used for xenograft studies.
MDA-MB-231-luc cells (2 million) were suspended in 1× Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) supplemented with 0.9 mg/mL matrigel
and injected s.c. into mice mammary fat pads. Tumor growth was moni-
tored by injecting 100 μL of 30 mg/mL D-luciferin i.p. Imaging was com-
pleted over 2–5 min using a Xenogen IVIS 2000 Live Imaging System.
Luminescence signals were quantified using IVIS analysis software by
drawing a circular/oval region of interest around the luminescent signal.
Mice were administered 10 mg/kg 3 by i.p. injection every 48 h after the
tumor was detectable (at least 100,000 photons per second) by lumines-
cence imaging. Tumors were monitored weekly by luminescent imaging.
qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed on mice 3 wk post-
visualization of the tumor by luciferase imaging.
