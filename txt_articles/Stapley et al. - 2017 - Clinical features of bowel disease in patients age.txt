 INTRODUCTION
Symptoms 
referable 
to 
the 
lower 
gastrointestinal 
tract 
are 
common, 
accounting for 1 in 12 GP consultations.1 
Lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms in 
younger patients, defined as aged <50 years, 
are difficult to diagnose, even after a full 
clinical examination. Often symptoms are 
attributed to non-serious conditions, such as 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and clinical 
guidelines usually favour non-interventional 
management.2 However, there are more 
than 2300 new diagnoses of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) annually in the UK in patients 
aged <50 years.3 These patients are more 
likely than older patients to be diagnosed 
following an emergency presentation4 
and have worse 5-year survival.5 It is 
unclear whether delays in diagnosis, more 
aggressive tumour biology, or both, are 
contributory factors. Furthermore, the 
annual incidence of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) in the UK is approximately 
13 000.6 A large proportion of these 
diagnoses are in patients aged <50 years, 
who often have several consultations before 
specialist referral.
Timely 
diagnosis 
of 
CRC 
requires 
clinicians 
to recognise the symptoms of serious 
bowel disease, and to investigate when 
appropriate. The latest National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
guidelines for suspected cancer contain 
recommendations for referral of younger 
patients aged <50 years, whereas most 
recommendations use an age threshold 
of 60 years.2 These recommendations for 
younger patients were largely based on 
consensus, assuming that symptoms of 
CRC in younger patients are similar to 
those in older patients. Few studies of 
the clinical features of CRC have included 
younger patients7–11 and none has reported 
features separately.
Inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily 
ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, 
share several symptoms with CRC, notably, 
rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
weight loss, and anaemia. Furthermore, 
IBD and CRC in younger patients have 
similar ages of onset. A systematic review 
in North America reported the mean age at 
diagnosis of Crohn’s disease to range from 
33.4 years to 45 years.12 Mean and median 
ages at diagnosis of ulcerative colitis are 
generally 5–10 years later than those for 
Crohn’s disease.13 Annual incidence rates in 
the UK are 13.9 out of 100 000 for ulcerative 
colitis and 8.3 out of 100 000 for Crohn’s 
disease; thus the incidence of IBD is five 
to six times that of CRC.6 Colonoscopy and 
biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of 
both diseases, although calprotectin and 
testing for occult blood in faeces may be 
employed as triage tests.
For younger patients, delayed diagnosis

Abstract
Background
Incidences of colorectal cancer (CRC) and 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are 
increasing in those aged <50 years.
Aim
To identify and quantify clinical features 
in primary care of CRC/IBD in those aged 
<50 years. This study considered the two 
conditions together and aimed to determine 
which younger patients, presenting in primary 
care with symptoms, would benefit from 
investigation for potentially serious colorectal 
disease.
Design and setting
Matched case-control study using primary care 
records from the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink, UK.
Method
Incident cases (aged <50 years) of CRC (n = 1661) 
and IBD (n = 9578) diagnosed between 2000 and 
2013 were each matched with up to three controls 
(n = 3979 CRC; n = 22 947 IBD). Odds ratios 
(OR) and positive predictive values (PPV) were 
estimated for features of CRC/IBD in the year 
before diagnosis.
Results
Ten features were independently associated 
with CRC/IBD (all P<0.001): rectal bleeding, 
change in bowel habit, diarrhoea, raised 
inflammatory markers, thrombocytosis, 
abdominal pain, low mean cell volume 
(MCV), low haemoglobin, raised white cell 
count, and raised hepatic enzymes. PPVs 
were >3% for rectal bleeding with diarrhoea, 
thrombocytosis, low MCV, low haemoglobin 
or raised inflammatory markers; for change 
in bowel habit with low MCV, thrombocytosis 
or low haemoglobin; and for diarrhoea with 
thrombocytosis.
Conclusion 
This study quantified the risk of serious 
bowel disease in symptomatic patients aged 
<50 years in primary care. Rectal bleeding and 
change in bowel habit are strongly predictive 
of CRC/IBD when combined with abnormal 
haematology. The present findings help 
prioritise patients for colonoscopy where the 
diagnosis is not immediately apparent.

Clinical features of bowel disease in 
patients aged <50 years in primary care: 
a large case-control study
e336  British Journal of General Practice, May 2017
 is common for both CRC and IBD. A recent 
survey of 401 UK patients aged <50 years 
diagnosed with CRC reported that 20% 
presented to primary care five or more 
times before referral.14 The survey also 
found a strong sex divide, with 54% of males 
referred to a specialist after fewer than 
three primary care consultations compared 
with only 35% of females. 
A cohort study of 1591 Swiss patients 
diagnosed 
with 
IBD 
reported 
the 
median diagnostic interval (time from 
first 
presentation 
of 
symptoms 
to 
definitive diagnosis) for Crohn’s disease 
to be 9 months and for ulcerative colitis, 
4 months.15
Timely investigation is important in 
both conditions. In CRC, there is a clear 
relationship between diagnostic delay and 
more advanced disease, complications, 
and emergency presentation, and with 
mortality.16 Delayed diagnosis of IBD 
reduces treatment options, increases 
the risk of disease progression,17 and is 
psychologically detrimental.
One solution to improving the diagnosis 
of serious organic bowel disease in younger 
patients is to consider the possibility of CRC 
and IBD together, and to ask the clinical 
question, ‘Which younger patients with 
symptoms would benefit from investigation 
for potentially serious colorectal disease?’
METHOD
This was an observational study using data 
collected prospectively from the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). 
The CPRD maintains records from nearly 
700 participating practices in the UK.
Identification of cases and controls
Incident cases in the CPRD between 
January 2000 and December 2013 were 
identified using a list of diagnostic medical 
codes (medcodes) (39 for CRC and 35 for 
IBD, available from the authors on request). 
Patients were aged between 18 and 
49 years at diagnosis and had at least 1 year 
of data prior to diagnosis. For the small 
number of patients with both conditions, 
the earliest condition was taken to be the 
index diagnosis. For each case (CRC/IBD) 
the CPRD randomly selected three controls 
matched by birth year, sex, and practice. The 
initial medcode for CRC/IBD was deemed to 
be the diagnosis date, hereafter called the 
index date. Controls were assigned the 
index date of their matched case. 
Cases and controls with no consultations 
in the year before the index date were 
excluded. Controls were excluded if they 
had a previous diagnostic code of CRC/IBD.
Selection of possible features of CRC/IBD
All symptoms, signs, and investigations 
(hereafter called ‘features’) that had 
previously been reported as associated with 
CRC/IBD were studied. These features were 
identified from literature reviews, clinical 
knowledge, patient feedback, charities, and 
websites. The CPRD database contains 
>100 000 medcodes, including several 
synonyms for the same symptom. These 
were collated into symptom ‘libraries’ and 
occurrences in the year before diagnosis 
of the case identified both for cases and 
controls. 
Features were retained if they were 
reported in at least 5% of cases or controls 
(invariably this was in cases). Searches 
were conducted for abnormal laboratory 
investigations in the year before the index 
date using the local laboratory’s normal 
range supplied with the data.
Patients without a reported investigation 
were considered to be equivalent to those 
with a normal result. A variable ‘raised 
inflammatory markers’ equated to any of 
an abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate, C-reactive protein, or plasma viscosity. 
‘Abnormal liver function’ encompassed 
raised levels of any of the hepatic enzymes 
included in liver function testing. 
Records of varicose veins were identified 
to test for recording bias, assuming 
approximately equal prevalence in cases 
and controls. Calprotectin and faecal occult 
blood results were also sought.
Analysis
The primary analysis used conditional 
logistic regression to assess the strength 
of association between clinical features and 
the combined outcome of either CRC or 
IBD. Features with P<0.1 in univariable 
analysis entered multivariable analysis. 
The final model was derived from all 
features that survived the earlier staged 
How this fits in
It is difficult for GPs to determine whether 
bowel symptoms in patients aged <50 years 
require further investigation. Delay in 
diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
in patients aged <50 years is common 
and causes harm. Rectal bleeding and a 
change in bowel habit are both strongly 
predictive of CRC or IBD when combined 
with abnormal haematology. The CRC/IBD 
risk assessment tool may help to reduce 
diagnostic delay.
British Journal of General Practice, May 2017  e337
 regressions and used a P<0.01. 
All analyses were performed using Stata 
(version 13.1).
Power calculation and calculation of 
positive predictive values (PPVs)
The CPRD estimated that 12 000 cases 
and 36 000 controls would be provided for 
analysis; therefore, power, rather than 
sample size, calculations were performed. 
PPVs were derived using Bayes’ theorem, 
using national incidence data to estimate 
prior odds. These calculations are available 
from the authors on request.
RESULTS
The CPRD initially supplied 45 052 patients: 
11 263 cases (n = 1680 CRC, n = 9583 IBD) 
and 33 789 matched controls. Exclusion 
criteria were applied (Figure 1), leading 
to the exclusion of one case with colonic 
metastatic cancer, and 23 cases with both 
CRC and IBD, along with their matched 
controls (n = 62). A further 722 patients 
(1.6%) were excluded for administrative 
reasons: 
721 
controls 
inadvertently 
reselected from the pool of cases by the 
CPRD, and one patient with indecipherable 
data. Of the remaining 44 244 patients 
(11 239 cases; 33 005 controls), 6079 
(18.4%) controls had no consultations in 
the year before the index date, and were 
excluded. There were no cases that did not 
consult in the year before diagnosis. The 
demographic features and the consultation 
patterns of patients are shown in Table 1. 
Cases with CRC or IBD consulted more 
often than their matched controls in both 
the year and the 6 months before the index 
date (Mann–Whitney test: P<0.001).
Associations between CRC/IBD and 
clinical features
Table 2 shows the frequencies of clinical 
features in the combined dataset, plus their 
likelihood ratios and positive predictive 
values (PPVs). All PPVs of individual 
features for CRC/IBD were <1%, apart 
from those for change in bowel habit 
(1%, 95% CI = 0.8% to 1.3%) and rectal 
bleeding (1.2%, 95% CI = 1.1% to 1.4%). In 
multivariable analysis, rectal bleeding (OR 
42, 95% CI = 33 to 55) and change in bowel 
habit (OR 27, 95% CI = 19 to 38) were most 
strongly associated with CRC/IBD. Although 
constipation, nausea/vomiting, and rectal 
mass were independently associated with 
CRC (OR reported in Table 2), they occurred 
too infrequently (below the 5% threshold) 
for inclusion in the combined dataset; 
therefore, their positive likelihood and PPVs 
are not reported. Estimation of sex-specific 
PPVs is hampered by the IBD incidence 
reports often not giving separate figures. 
Likelihood ratios for abdominal pain, change 
in bowel habit, and anaemia were higher in 
males. The reporting of varicose veins was 
similar in cases (46, 0.41%) and controls 
(129, 0.48%) (χ2 test P = 0.354). Of 11 239 
cases, 8479 (75.4%) had at least one of the 
features present in the final model.
No calprotectin results were identified. 
For faecal occult blood testing, there were 
3026 possible entries; however, 2641 were 
blank, 111 positive/abnormal, and 274 
normal/negative.
All associations in Table 2 had a P-value 
of <0.001. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show PPVs for 
CRC/IBD for selected features in Table 2, 
and for CRC and IBD alone.

 DISCUSSION
Summary
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first 
study to examine the pre-diagnostic clinical 
features of CRC/IBD specifically in young-
age patients. The diseases share several 
clinical features and a common definitive 
test; therefore, the primary analysis kept 
them together, although findings for the 
two diseases are also reported separately. 
For individual symptoms or abnormal 
laboratory findings, the risks of either IBD 
or CRC were below 1%, apart from change 
in bowel habit and unexplained rectal 
bleeding. 
Pairs of symptoms, or individual 
symptoms accompanied by abnormal tests, 
however, often had risks above 1%.
Strengths and limitations

 in primary care, in which the diagnostic 
challenge exists. CPRD data are regarded 
as high quality in terms of accuracy, 
completeness, and validity of diagnoses, 
and are representative of the UK as a 
whole. The identification of symptoms and 
diagnoses depended, however, on accurate 
primary care recording. Although there 
was no access to secondary care data, in 
particular histology, for external validation of 
diagnoses, cancer recording in the CPRD is 
deemed to be excellent.18 Furthermore, case 
ascertainment and year of diagnosis for IBD 
have both been validated in the CPRD.19
No studies have reported from primary 
care: unfortunately, in this study no 
calprotectin 
results 
and 
insufficient 
faecal occult blood results were found to 
allow reliable analysis. Some symptom 
occurrences will have been missed, 
because the GP either omitted to record 
them, or recorded them in the uncoded 
section of the notes. The present measures 
of association would only be altered 
materially if recording practice differed 
between cases and controls. Variation in 
recording also pertains to the three main 
symptoms of bowel transit: diarrhoea, 
constipation, and ‘change in bowel habit’.

Figure 2. PPVs (95% CI) for colorectal cancer (CRC) 
or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in males and 
females aged 18–49 years for individual risk markers 
and for pairs of risk markers in combination.  The 
top figure in each cell is the PPV (95% CI) when both 
features are present. CI have not been calculated 
when any cell in the 2 × 2 table was <5 (invariably, 
this was because too few controls had both features). 
The yellow shading is for features with a PPV >1%; 
and the red for PPV >3% (see Discussion for 
reasoning). The cells along the diagonal relate to the 
PPV when the same feature has been reported twice. 
Thus, the abdominal pain/abdominal pain intersect 
is the PPV for CRC/IBD when a patient has attended 
at least twice with abdominal pain. PPV = positive 
predictive value.

 first two of these and the last. It was chosen 
not to merge these into one variable, as it 
would have obscured differences between 
constipation and diarrhoea.
The present methodology is well accepted, 
in particular the derivation of likelihood 
ratios within the study, accompanied by the 
use of external incidence data to estimate 
the PPVs.20 The prior odds part of the PPV 
calculation requires accurate incidence 
figures: this was simple for colorectal cancer, 
with high-quality national figures being 
published annually, but less so for IBD. The 
present choice of a median incidence figure 
from recent studies from Northern Europe 
sought to match the present dataset, but 
should the true UK incidence of IBD in this 
age group be higher (or lower) than the 
22 out of 100 000 (IQR 15.25–28) used, the 
PPVs would be commensurately higher or 
lower too.
Finally, the study design matched 
the clinical problem: namely, which 
symptomatic patients in primary care 
warrant investigation? The coupling of the 
two diseases analytically is therefore a 
strength rather than a limitation.

 study has considered the two diseases 
together for the purpose of clinical decision 
making; furthermore, very little literature 
describes the primary care symptomology 
of either disease in this age group. 
Studies from secondary care are generally 
unhelpful because they report on a referred 
population: in general, such studies report 
much higher PPVs for symptoms of cancer 
(and presumably would do for IBD) than do 
those from the primary care population.21
Implications for research and practice 
Younger patients with lower gastrointestinal 
tract symptoms represent a difficult 
diagnostic problem for GPs, even after 
a full clinical examination. Most will 
have functional or non-serious organic 
disease, and most of those who undergo 
colonoscopy have no relevant abnormality.22 
Consequently, less invasive symptom 
assessment strategies to differentiate 
functional from organic disease are 
preferred.23,24 Faecal calprotectin has a 
diagnostic role in differentiating between 
inflammatory 
and 
non-inflammatory 
bowel conditions such as IBS. In a recent 
systematic review, using a cut-off of 50 µg/g, 
the pooled sensitivity and specificity of faecal 
calprotectin for IBD were 93% and 94%,

Figure 4. PPVs (95% CI) for inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) in males and females aged 18–49 years

 respectively.25 Faecal calprotectin is not 
recommended, however, for discriminating 
between functional gut disease (such as 
IBS) and CRC. A recent report using 654 
patients referred for possible CRC reported 
that calprotectin had a negative predictive 
value of 98.6% for cancer, or 97.2% when 
polyps ≥10 mm were included.26 Future 
studies incorporating a calprotectin test 
result would be valuable to examine what 
predictive power they add to the present 
PPVs.
The present results support a diagnostic 
strategy in primary care outlined in 
NICE CG61.23 It is predicated on an initial 
physical examination, including rectal 
examination, and baseline full blood 
count and inflammatory marker level in 
patients aged <50 years presenting with 
symptoms referable to the large bowel. For 
those whose diagnosis is not immediately 
apparent, the CRC/IBD risk assessment 
tool (Figure 2) guides subsequent action. 
It is considered that those with a risk of 
CRC/IBD >3% warrant referral for urgent 
colonoscopy or specialist assessment, an 
action compatible with both NICE NG12 and 
the NICE Quality Standard for IBD (QS81).2,27 
Patients with a risk of 1–3% should have 
their calprotectin level estimated, as IBD 
is the more likely of the two diagnoses and 
can be excluded by a normal calprotectin 
level. Those with a risk below 1% can 
be managed expectantly. In the latter two 
scenarios, it is important that the patient’s 
progress is monitored (safety-netting) and 
that referral is made if clinical progress is 
not as expected. Use of the risk assessment 
tool also allows a more nuanced decision 
on referral of patients in this age group who 
present with unexplained rectal bleeding, 
going beyond the blanket recommendation 
of referral in NICE CG61.23 The tool has been 
colour-coded to mirror these suggestions. 
The present risk assessment tool is 
limited to risk of CRC/IBD. For females 
whose symptoms could represent ovarian 
cancer, the risk assessment tool for that 
cancer site should also be employed.28 
For those patients whose symptoms could 
represent coeliac disease, the British 
Society of Gastroenterology guidance on 
diagnostic assessment should be followed.29
This strategy should increase the 
proportion of younger patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal 
cancer to be diagnosed without delay. 
It seeks to do so without inordinately 
increasing work for colonoscopy providers, 
who are already experiencing considerable 
increases in workload.30 What is missing 
is a health-economic perspective. It is 
possible to estimate the costs of increased 
colonoscopies but much more difficult 
to estimate cost-effectiveness. Until this 
economic analysis is complete, investigation 
strategies are limited to being based 
on likely clinical benefits; which include 
avoiding colonoscopy in those with the least 
to benefit as well as offering it for those with 
the most to benefit.
