IMPORTANCE Research indicates that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use (vaping) among
adolescents is associated with the initiation and progression of combustible cigarette
smoking. The reasons for this association are unknown.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether use of e-cigarettes with higher nicotine concentrations is
associated with subsequent increases in the frequency and intensity of combustible cigarette
smoking and vaping.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prospective cohort study involving students from
10 high schools in the Los Angeles, California, metropolitan area, surveys were administered
during 10th grade in the spring (baseline) and 11th grade in the fall (6-month follow-up) of
2015 to students who reported using e-cigarettes within the past 30 days and the nicotine
concentration level they used at baseline.
EXPOSURES Self-report of baseline e-cigarette nicotine concentration of none (0 mg/mL),
low (1-5 mg/mL), medium (6-17 mg/mL), or high (�18 mg/mL) typically used during the past
30 days.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of combustible cigarette smoking and
e-cigarette use within the past 30 days (0 days [none], 1-2 days [infrequent], or �3 days
[frequent]) and daily intensity of smoking and vaping (number of cigarettes smoked per day,
number of vaping episodes per day, and number of puffs per vaping episode) at the 6-month
follow-up.
RESULTS The analytic sample included 181 students (96 boys [53.0%] and 85 girls [47.0%];
mean [SD] age, 16.1 [0.4] years). Each successive increase in nicotine concentration (none
to low, low to medium, and medium to high) vaped was associated with a 2.26 (95% CI,
1.28-3.98) increase in the odds of frequent (vs no) smoking and a 1.65 (95% CI, 1.09-2.51)
increase in the odds of frequent (vs no) vaping at follow-up after adjustment for baseline
frequency of smoking and vaping and other relevant covariates. Use of e-cigarettes with high
(vs no) nicotine concentration was associated with a greater number of cigarettes smoked
per day at follow-up (adjusted rate ratio [RR], 7.03; 95% CI, 6.11-7.95). An association with a
significantly greater number of vaping episodes per day was found with use of low (adjusted
RR, 3.32; 95% CI, 2.61-4.03), medium (adjusted RR, 3.32; 95% CI, 2.54-4.10), and high
(adjusted RR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.63-3.24) nicotine concentrations (vs no nicotine) at baseline.
Similar results were found for the number of puffs per vaping episode for low (adjusted RR,
2.05; 95% CI, 1.41-2.70), medium (adjusted RR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.66-4.11), and high (adjusted
RR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.42-3.03) nicotine concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study provide preliminary evidence that
use of e-cigarettes with higher nicotine concentrations by youths may increase subsequent
frequency and intensity of smoking and vaping.

n 2016, 11% of US 10th grade students reported using (vap-
ing) electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in the past 30 days.1
Prospective data demonstrate that youths who vape are
more likely to initiate2-6 and progress7 to more frequent and
heavy smoking. However, the reasons for these associations
remain largely unknown. Identifying factors that underlie the
progression of smoking and vaping among adolescents is criti-
cal for understanding, estimating, and preventing adverse
health consequences of e-cigarette use among youths.
Nicotine is the principal constituent of combustible ciga-
rettes that maintains smoking dependence, particularly dur-
ing early adolescence, a critical developmental period in which
the brain is especially vulnerable to the addictive properties
of nicotine.8 e-Cigarettes are available with a wide variety of
nicotine concentrations, ranging from 0 mg/mL (ie, no nico-
tine) to more than 25 mg/mL,9 and use of e-cigarettes with
higher nicotine concentrations has been shown to increase
nicotine delivery to the bloodstream and may enhance the re-
wardingeffectsofvaping.10,11Accordingly,adolescentswhouse
e-cigaretteswithhigherlevelsofnicotinemaybeatgreaterrisk
for developing a tolerance to and dependence on nicotine that
could contribute to the persistence and progression of vaping
as well as use of combustible tobacco products.
Recent cross-sectional studies suggest that considerable
variation exists in the nicotine concentrations used by ado-
lescentswhovape12-14andthatuseofe-cigaretteswith(vswith-
out) nicotine is associated with a greater likelihood of ciga-
rette smoking and heavier e-cigarette use.14 However, whether
gradations in nicotine concentrations are longitudinally asso-
ciated with subsequent progression to higher levels of smok-
ing and vaping remains unknown. Because e-cigarette solu-
tions containing nicotine were recently deemed to be tobacco
products and fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the US
Food and Drug Administration,15 assessing associations of
e-cigarette nicotine concentration with use of tobacco prod-
ucts can inform regulatory policy addressing nicotine concen-
tration in e-cigarette products. In the present study, we ex-
amined associations between the baseline e-cigarette nicotine
concentration vaped and the subsequent frequency and in-
tensity of combustible cigarette smoking and e-cigarette vap-
ing at a 6-month follow-up among a sample of adolescent
users of e-cigarettes.
Methods
Participants
Participantsincluded10thgradestudentsfrom10highschools
in the Los Angeles, California, metropolitan area followed up
as part of a longitudinal survey of substance use and mental
health.2 Data were collected and processed at 5 semiannual as-
sessments beginning in the fall of 2013, when the cohort was
beginning 9th grade, through the fall of 2015. The e-cigarette
nicotine concentration used by adolescent vapers was first as-
sessed when the cohort was in 10th grade during the spring
of 2015 (baseline for this report). We included data from all re-
spondents who used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days, who re-
ported the nicotine concentration that they vaped at base-
line, and who completed past 30-day smoking and vaping
frequency measures at the 6-month follow-up during the fall
semester of 11th grade (N = 181). All data were collected using
paper questionnaires at the participants’high schools; par-
ticipants who were not available on the day that the data were
collected completed telephone or internet surveys. Indi-
vidual participants were not monetarily compensated; how-
ever, each participating high school’
s general fund was remu-
nerated for staff time. The study was approved by the
institutional review board of University of Southern Califor-
nia. Parents provided written informed consent, and youths
assented to participation.
Measures
e-Cigarette Nicotine Concentration
e-Cigarette nicotine concentration levels typically vaped dur-
ing the past 30 days at baseline were assessed with the ques-
tion, “What level of nicotine (strength of e-liquid or juice) did
you usually use in your e-cigarette?” The response options in-
cluded none (0 mg/mL), low (1-5 mg/mL), medium (6-17 mg/
mL), high (≥18 mg/mL), and “I don’
t know.
”16 Participants who
did not know the nicotine concentration that they typically
vaped were excluded (n = 28).
Past 30-Day Frequency of Combustible Cigarette
and e-Cigarette Use
At baseline and follow-up, participants completed 2 survey
questions assessing the number of days that they had smoked
cigarettes and the number of days that they had vaped e-
cigarettes within the past 30 days (response options: 1-2, 3-5,
6-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, and all 30 days).1 Responses
were collapsed into a 3-level variable for smoking and vaping
frequency within the past 30 days consisting of (1) no use
(0 days), (2) infrequent use (1-2 days), and (3) frequent use
(≥3 days) as in previous research owing to lower frequency
counts in categories of greater use (eFigures 1 and 2 in the
Supplement).7
Intensity of Combustible Cigarette and e-Cigarette Use
Participantsreportedthenumberofcombustiblecigarettesthat
they smoked on each smoking day (0, 1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-

Key Points
Question Is the use of electronic cigarettes with higher nicotine
concentrations prospectively associated with greater frequency
and intensity of combustible cigarette smoking and vaping in
adolescents?
Findings In this cohort study of 181 adolescent electronic
cigarette users, use of electronic cigarettes with higher nicotine
concentrations at baseline was associated with greater levels of
combustible cigarette and electronic cigarette use in the past
30 days at the 6-month follow-up and greater intensity of daily
use after controlling for baseline use.
Meaning Use of electronic cigarettes with higher nicotine
concentrations may contribute to the progression to smoking and
vaping at higher levels of frequency and intensity among youths.

 tions to characterize vaping intensity. First, the number of vap-
ing episodes per day was assessed with the question, “On the
days you vaped, how many times did you usually pick up your
e-cigarette device to vape?” (response options: 1, 2, 3-5, 6-9,
10-14, 15-20, or ≥20 times). Second, the number of puffs taken
during each vaping episode was assessed with the question,
“Each time you picked up your e-cigarette to vape, how many
puffs did you usually take before putting it away?” (response
options: 0, 1, 2, 3-5, 6-9, 10-14, 15-20, or ≥20 puffs).17,18 These
response categories were recoded into quantitative count vari-
ables by taking the lowest value of each ordinal smoking
(ie, 0, 1, 2, 6, 11, 16, or 20 cigarettes per d) and vaping (ie, 0, 1,
2, 3, 6, 10, 15, or 20 puffs or episodes) category for use in the
intensity analyses.
Covariates
Interpersonal, intrapersonal, and demographic factors mea-
sured at baseline that have previously been shown to be as-
sociated with tobacco product use were included as a priori co-
variates to address possible confounding of associations.19
Demographic characteristics such as sex, age, race/ethnicity
(Hispanic, white, Asian, and other race), and the highest level
of parental education (college degree or greater vs other) were
assessed with self-report measures. Interpersonal character-
istics included peer vaping and smoking behavior (assessed
with the questions, “In the last 30 days, how many of your 5
closest friends have smoked/vaped?” [response options, none
vs ≥1 friend]), which were classified into a composite peer
tobacco product use variable (yes or no). A variable was also
created for lifetime use of tobacco products other than
e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes (eg, cigars, hookah) at
baseline (yes or no). Intrapersonal characteristics included de-
pressive symptoms, delinquent behavior, and sensation seek-
ing. Depressive symptoms were measured during fall of ninth
grade using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale,20 a well-validated 20-item measure of past week fre-
quency of experiencing depressive symptoms (possible scores
range from 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater sever-
ity of depressive symptoms; internal consistency estimate,
α = .88). Delinquent behavior in the past 6 months was as-
sessed during fall of ninth grade with an 11-item measure sum-
ming the reported frequency of engaging in deviant behav-
iors(eg,stealing,destroyingproperty,lyingtoparents,running
away, physically fighting; scores range from 1 [never] to 6 [≥10
times];internalconsistencyestimate,α = .93).21Sensationseek-
ing was measured with the sum score of the 12-item subscale
of the UPPS (urgency, perseverance, premeditation, and sen-
sationseeking)ImpulsiveBehaviorScale(eg,“Iquiteenjoytak-
ing risks” and “I generally seek new and exciting experiences
and sensations”) (scores range from 0-48, with higher scores
indicating greater impulsivity and sensation seeking; inter-
nal consistency estimate, α = .93).22
Statistical Analysis
Preliminary analyses involved calculating descriptive statis-
tics and distributional properties (ie, skewness and kurtosis)
for all tobacco product outcomes and covariates, stratified by
baseline nicotine concentration. We used χ2 and 1-way analy-
sis of variance tests to assess differences in covariates by base-
line nicotine concentration. Primary analyses used general-
ized linear mixed models with a random intercept to account
for the clustering of students within their respective high
schools.
Frequency Outcomes | Polytomous (multinomial) regression
models were used to test associations between baseline
e-cigarette nicotine concentration (ie, none, low, medium, or
high) and frequency of use in the past 30 days (ie, 0, 1-2, or
≥3 days) at follow-up. Nicotine concentration was treated as a
continuous variable (ie, grouped linear term [0 indicates none;
1, low; 2, medium; and 3, high]). Combustible cigarette and
e-cigarette use outcomes were evaluated in separate models
with no use of each product in the past 30 days at follow-up
as the reference groups. Models were first tested as unad-
justed without covariates and were then adjusted for base-
line smoking frequency and vaping frequency in the past 30
days and all aforementioned interpersonal, intrapersonal, and
demographic covariates. One participant was excluded from
the adjusted model of associations with smoking frequency
owing to missing baseline smoking frequency covariate data
(N = 180).
Intensity Outcomes | Because the daily intensity outcome vari-
ables (ie, cigarettes per day, vaping episodes per day, and puffs
per vaping episodes) were not normally distributed (ie, overd-
ispersed),negativebinomialregressionmodelswereusedtoas-
sess associations with baseline nicotine concentration.23 Base-
linenicotineconcentrationwastreatedfirstasacontinuousand
then as a categorical variable, with no nicotine serving as the
reference category. The negative binomial regression coeffi-
cientswereexponentiatedtoobtainrateratios(RRs).Aftertest-
ing unadjusted models, adjusted models controlling for all
demographic,interpersonal,andintrapersonalcovariatesaswell
as frequency of use of the alternate product in the past 30 days
(eg, for the smoking outcome, past 30-day use of e-cigarettes
was adjusted for) and the respective baseline intensity mea-
surematchingtheoutcome(ie,cigarettesperday,puffspervap-
ing episode, or vaping episodes per day) were tested. Only ob-
servationswithcompletedataonrespectivevapingandsmoking
variables were used, resulting in samples ranging from 168 to
181 participants. To address missing covariate data in the ad-
justed models, 5 multiply imputed data sets were generated
using the Markov-chain Monte Carlo method with available
covariate data.24 The variable estimates (odds ratio [OR] or RR)
from the polytomous and negative binomial regression mod-
els in each imputed data set were pooled and presented as a
single estimate. We used SPSS software (version 24; IBM Corp)
and SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) for analyses; sig-
nificance was set to .05, and all tests were 2-tailed.

 obtained from 3396, 3252 of whom completed the spring 10th
gradeassessment(baselineforthisreport).Atbaseline,235stu-
dents (7.2%) reported vaping in the past 30 days; 54 total par-
ticipants were excluded from the analytic sample: 18 did not
answer the nicotine concentration question, 28 responded,
“I don’
t know,” and 8 were excluded for an absence of data at
follow-up(Figure).Studentswhovapedinthepast30daysand
were excluded from the analytic sample did not significantly
differ from those included on any covariates or smoking and
vaping variables.
The analytic sample of 181 students was relatively evenly
distributed between boys (96 [53.0%]) and girls (85 [47.0%])
(mean [SD] age, 16.1 [0.4] years). Among participants with data
available, most were Hispanic (88 [49.7%]) and did not have
parents who graduated college (87 [56.5%]). Sixty-three par-
ticipants (35.0%) had used cigarettes within the past 30 days
(ie, dual users) at baseline (Table 1). At baseline, 108 partici-
pants (59.7%) reported vaping a solution with nicotine dur-
ing the past 30 days. Of these, 52 participants (28.7%) vaped
a low nicotine concentration; 35 (19.3%), a medium nicotine
concentration; and 21 (11.6%), a high nicotine concentration
(Table 1).
Associations of Baseline Nicotine Concentration
With Smoking and Vaping Frequency at Follow-up
The prevalence of smoking and vaping frequency at fol-
low-up by baseline nicotine concentration level is reported in
independentmodels(Table2).Foreach1-levelincreaseinbase-
line nicotine concentration (ie, none to low, low to medium,
and medium to high), the odds of participants reporting fre-
quent smoking in the past 30 days (vs no smoking) at fol-
low-up were 2.43 times greater (95% CI, 1.58-3.76). This asso-
ciation remained significant after adjustment for covariates
(OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.28-3.98). Use of higher e-cigarette nico-
tine concentrations at baseline was not associated with in-
creased odds of infrequent (vs no) smoking in the past 30 days
in the unadjusted (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.72-1.98) or adjusted (OR,
1.01; 95% CI, 0.54-1.89) models (Table 2).
For each 1-level increase in baseline nicotine concentra-
tion,theoddsoffrequentvapinginthepast30days(ie,≥3days)
compared with no e-cigarette use at follow-up were 1.73 times
greater (95% CI, 1.24-2.41). This association remained signifi-
cant after adjustment for covariates (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09-
2.51). In unadjusted (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.69-1.59) and ad-
justed (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.59-1.60) models, e-cigarette
nicotineconcentrationusedatbaselinewasnotassociatedwith
infrequent vaping (Table 2).
Associations of Baseline Nicotine Concentration
With Smoking and Vaping Intensity at Follow-up
We found no significant differences in daily smoking quan-
tity between youths who did not vape nicotine and youths
who vaped low or medium nicotine concentrations at base-
line in adjusted models (Table 2). Compared with youths
who did not vape nicotine at baseline, those who vaped high
nicotine concentrations smoked 14.17 times as many ciga-
rettes per day (95% CI, 13.00-15.33), and this association
remained significant after adjustment for covariates (RR,
7.03; 95% CI, 6.11-7.95).
Relative to adolescents who did not vape nicotine at
baseline, youths who vaped low-nicotine concentrations
vaped approximately 2.4 times as many puffs per vaping
episode (RR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.65-3.18); those who vaped
medium nicotine concentrations, approximately 4.9 times as
many puffs per vaping episode (RR, 4.90; 95% CI, 4.16-5.65);
and those who vaped high nicotine concentrations, approxi-
mately 3.7 as many puffs per vaping episode (RR, 3.67; 95%
CI, 2.77-4.57). These findings demonstrated a positive linear
trend (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18-2.08). Similarly, relative to ado-
lescents who did not vape nicotine at baseline, youths who
vaped low nicotine concentrations had approximately 2.5
times as many vaping episodes per day (RR, 2.46; 95% CI,
1.62-3.30); those who vaped medium nicotine concentra-
tions, approximately 2.8 times as many vaping episodes per
day (RR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.89-3.66); and those who vaped high
nicotine concentrations, 3.9 times as many vaping episodes
per day (RR, 3.90; 95% CI, 2.94-4.86). These findings also
demonstrated a positive linear trend (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.33-
2.33). All associations between baseline nicotine concentra-
tion vaped and vaping intensity outcomes remained signifi-
cant after adjustment for covariates (Table 2).
Discussion
Youths who vaped e-cigarettes with higher nicotine concen-
trations at baseline were more likely to progress to higher fre-
quency and intensity levels of vaping and smoking at 6-month

 follow-up after adjusting for baseline e-cigarette and combus-
tible cigarette use. Although previous studies have examined
cross-sectional associations of e-cigarette nicotine concentra-
tions used by youth and patterns of smoking and vaping,12-14
to our knowledge this is the first prospective study to evalu-
ate the association of varying e-cigarette nicotine concentra-
tions with future smoking and vaping behavior. In the con-
text of research demonstrating that youth who use e-cigarettes
are more likely to initiate2-6 and progress7 to higher levels of
combustible cigarette use, the present findings suggest that
the overrepresentation of frequent and high-intensity smok-
ing among youths who vape may be accounted for by nico-
tine concentration in e-cigarettes.

is associated with increased nicotine dependence later in
life.25,26 Exposure to higher levels of nicotine during early
adolescence increases the risk for nicotine dependence27
and adversely affects attentional processes,28-30 executive
functioning,31 and inhibitory control.32 Youths in this study
whovapedhighernicotineconcentrationsatbaselinemayhave
developed a tolerance to and dependence on nicotine and thus
increased their levels of vaping and smoking to accommo-
date nicotine-induced adaptations resulting from e-cigarette–
related nicotine exposure. Because of the potential neurocog-
nitive effects of nicotine exposure in the adolescent brain,33,34
teenagers who vape higher nicotine concentrations may also
be prone to poor decision making and risk-taking behaviors,
including increased vaping and smoking. Although biologi-
cally plausible, whether nicotine-induced tolerance, depen-
dence, neural dysregulation, or other cognitive (eg, expectan-
cies) and social (eg, peer affiliations) factors explain the
observed associations warrants further investigation.
Shared unmeasured risk factors may also explain the as-
sociation between use of e-cigarettes with higher nicotine con-
centrations and trajectories of accelerated vaping and smok-
ing. Although we cannot exclude this possibility, we attempted
to address this issue analytically by adjusting for demo-
graphic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal risk factors for vap-
ing and smoking, including baseline vaping and smoking lev-
els. Adjusted ORs and RRs did not meaningfully differ from the
unadjusted estimates, suggesting that the available covari-
ates are unlikely to confound the associations demonstrated
herein.
Among 10th grade students in the 2015 US Monitoring
the Future Study,13 27% of the 704 participants who had
vaped in the past 30 days and 41% of the 268 participants
who vaped 6 or more times in the past 30 days reported that
e-cigarettes used in their most recent vaping episode con-
tained nicotine. In this study, the prevalence of nicotine vap-
ing among all participants who vaped within the past 30
days (including in the denominator those who did not know
whether the e-cigarette they typically used contained nico-
tine) was 108 of 209 (51.7%). One reason why nicotine vap-
ing may have been more common in the present sample is
that participants in this study vaped within the past 30 days
and were asked what nicotine concentration they typically
vaped during that period, whereas the 2015 US Monitoring
the Future Study assessed the substance vaped in the most
recent episode.13 Because youths may alternate use of differ-
ent liquids that may or may not contain nicotine, youths
who vape nicotine may not necessarily have used an
e-cigarette containing nicotine during their most recent vap-
ing occasion, which would result in lower nicotine vaping
prevalence estimates than would result when assessing the

 substance typically vaped. Alternatively, the participants in
this study were all from California, and California adolescent
e-cigarette users may vape nicotine at higher rates than
national samples.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of the study include the demographically diverse
sample, high rate of retention, and detailed assessment of
smoking and vaping intensity. Limitations include the rela-
tively small sample, reliance on self-report data, and lack of
biochemical verification of reported e-cigarette nicotine con-
centrations vaped by youths. Evidence suggests that nicotine
concentrations in vaping liquid can be mislabeled, however,
because chemically verified nicotine concentrations have typi-
cally been found to be higher than mislabeled concentra-
tions, our estimates may be conservative.35 The observa-
tional period in this study captures an important, but brief,
window in adolescent development, and extension to longer
periods of follow-up is warranted. The study did not assess or
account for nicotine dependence or other e-cigarette device
variables (eg, device generation, wattage, and machinery ef-
ficiency) that may affect nicotine absorption into the
bloodstream.36,37 Further research with larger samples is
needed to elucidate whether nicotine concentration per se
exerts a causal effect on smoking and vaping and subsequent
nicotine dependence among youth.
Conclusions
Among the adolescent e-cigarette users in this study, use of
e-cigarettes with higher nicotine concentrations at baseline
was associated with progression of smoking and vaping
frequency and intensity at 6-month follow-up. Given the
US Food and Drug Administration’
s 2016 Deeming Rule,
the results of this study provide preliminary evidence that
regulatory policies addressing nicotine concentration
levels in e-cigarette products used by adolescents may affect
progression of combustible cigarette and e-cigarette use
among youths.
