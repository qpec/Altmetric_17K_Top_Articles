Abstract
Chronic failure to suppress intake during states of positive energy balance leads to weight gain and 
obesity. The ability to use context – including interoceptive satiety states – to inhibit responding to 
previously rewarded cues appears to depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus. 
Recent evidence implicates energy dense Western diets in several types of hippocampal 
dysfunction, including reduced expression of neurotrophins and nutrient transporters, increased 
inflammation, microglial activation, and blood brain barrier permeability. The functional 
consequences of such insults include impairments in an animal’s ability to modulate responding to 
a previously reinforced cues. We propose that such deficits promote overeating, which can further 
exacerbate hippocampal dysfunction and thus initiate a vicious cycle of both obesity and 
progressive cognitive decline.
Introduction
There is mounting neuroanatomical and behavioral evidence that the hippocampus is a 
primary brain substrate for the control of food intake (for reviews see [1, 2]). For example, 
the hippocampus receives neural input from brain areas involved with the detection of 
metabolic signals, the perception of internal cues, taste, and reward. It is also the site of 
receptors for a multitude of neurochemical signals (e.g., cholecystokinin, leptin, insulin, 
glucose, ghrelin) that are known to contribute to energy intake and body weight regulation. 
In addition, hippocampal neurons project to multiple brain areas that are important 
substrates for energy balance and ingestive behavior [3, 4]. Furthermore, the hippocampus is

 critically involved with cognitive processes (e.g., memory, decision-making) that animals 
may use to determine when to eat [5, 6]. Accordingly, it should not be surprising that 
interference with hippocampal functioning would have adverse consequences for the control 
of eating and appetitive behavior.
Recent evidence shows that consuming energy dense “western” diets has harmful effects on 
the hippocampus [7–9]. We and others have proposed that intake of such diets could invoke 
a vicious cycle (see F.1) of hippocampal dysfunction and impaired inhibitory cognitive 
control of responding to environmental food cues, resulting in excess intake, obesity, and 
further hippocampal dysfunction [2, 10–12]. In this review we describe the associative 
underpinnings of this vicious cycle and highlight recent findings pointing to the 
neurobehavioral mechanisms that may initiate and perpetuate it.
The Model
Functions of the hippocampus
The hippocampus is recognized as an important substrate for the encoding and retrieval of 
both spatial and several nonspatial forms of memory [13]. Recent data indicate that the 
hippocampus is also needed for decision-making processes, especially those involved with 
response selection in the face of conflicting or ambiguous information [14]. For example, 
the hippocampus has been implicated in resolving approach-avoidance discrepancies in 
situations in which two opposing response tendencies are experienced simultaneously [15, 
16]. Other findings suggest adaptive response selection is based on the contribution of the 
hippocampus to the context-dependent inhibition of approach tendencies [14, 17, 18]. The 
retrieval of situationally-appropriate memories by contextual cues and the reduction of 
interference by memories formed in other contexts are also considered functions of the 
hippocampus [19, 20].
Contextual control of conflict resolution in ingestive behavior
The model diagrammed in F.2 (adapted from [11]) shows how interoceptive “satiety” states 
may serve as contextual stimuli that animals can use to resolve ambiguities associated with 
whether or not to perform appetitive responses. Specifically, that diagram indicates that food 
and food-associated environmental stimuli are embedded concurrently in two conflicting 
associations. The excitatory association enables food cues to retrieve the memory (formed 
when animals eat food when they are not food sated) of hedonically-positive post-ingestive 
consequences. The retrieval of this memory promotes appetitive responding to food-related 
external cues.
However, food cues do not always signal that the post-ingestive consequences of intake will 
be positive. For example, when an animal’s energy needs have been satisfied (i.e., they are 
food sated), the post-ingestive consequences may be neutral, or even aversive. This 
circumstance results in the formation of an inhibitory association that opposes the capacity 
of the excitatory association to excite the memory of the post-ingestive reward. Thus, when 
encountering external food cues animals must resolve the ambiguity produced by these 
conflicting associations to determine whether or not to engage in appetitive behavior. 
According to F.2, animals can solve this problem because their satiety signals act as

 contextual stimuli [21] that retrieve the memory of the inhibitory association, thereby 
antagonizing the ability of the excitatory association to retrieve the reward memory. The 
conflict is thus resolved in favor of refraining from engaging in appetitive and 
consummatory behaviors. As discussed above, this role for satiety signals describes a 
hippocampal-dependent function.
Supporting data
Hippocampal insult disrupts the inhibitory control of feeding
The case of Henry Moliason (a.k.a. H.M.) provided early evidence for hippocampal 
involvement in the control of intake [22] Following bilateral medial temporal lobectomy that 
damaged his hippocampus, H.M. not only exhibited anterograde amnesia so severe that he 
was unable to recall a meal he consumed a few minutes earlier, he would consume a second 
full meal minutes later and rate himself no more satiated after, compared to before, eating. 
Subsequent studies showed that rats with hippocampal damage more selective than H.M.’s 
increase their meal frequency [23], exhibit greater response perseveration on progressive 
ratio schedules [24] and show impairments in their ability to discriminate among their 
deprivation states [25, 26].
Recent findings also substantiate hippocampal involvement in feeding behavior. For 
example, temporary inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus in rats decreases intermeal 
intervals [27], suggesting a diminished capacity for satiety signals to inhibit intake during 
the period following a meal. Furthermore, the conversion of circulating triglycerides to fatty 
acids increases following food intake, providing a source of satiety signals detectable in the 
brain [28]. Interference with this conversion in the dorsal hippocampus increases weight 
gain in rodents [29]. In the ventral hippocampus, activation of receptors for the anorectic 
peptides leptin and GLP-1 decreases food intake and appetitive behavior based on food 
rewards [30, 31], whereas direct administration of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin (which 
presumably antagonizes satiety signaling) increases meal frequency and the ability of 
environmental food-related cues to stimulate eating [32]. These results suggest that 
interference with the hippocampal processing of either anorectic or orexigenic promotes 
positive energy balance.
Imaging studies in humans also provide evidence that the hippocampus is included among a 
group of feeding-related brain substrates that are influenced by both interoceptive satiety 
signals and external food cues. For example, consistent with the rodent findings noted 
above, a recent fMRI study with humans showed that the effect of satiation on the 
hippocampal response to palatable and energy-dense food was specifically associated with 
the meal’s ability to increase triglyceride, and reduce ghrelin, levels [33]. Hippocampal 
activation is also modulated as a function of obesity and feeding state by interoceptive 
signals of gastric distension [34] and by visual images of foods [35].
Such findings supports the associative model depicted in F.2, by providing evidence that (a) 
the hippocampus is sensitive to physiological signals that are informative about energy state; 
(b) appetitive behavior is altered by manipulations that influence the detection of those 
signals hippocampal receptors; (c) that hippocampal activation in responses to food-related

 cues is modulated by those signals; and (d) that disruption of hippocampal function has 
adverse effects on the ability to detect or use energy state cues to control the power of food 
cues to evoke eating and appetitive behavior after energy homeostasis has been achieved.
Links between diet, obesity and hippocampal dysfunction
Saturated fat and simple sugar intake is strongly associated with weight gain, and diets high 
in these macronutrients are common throughout the United States [36, see F.3], Europe [37], 
and other Western and Westernized societies with high obesity rates. There is increasing 
evidence that consumption of these “Western Diets” (WD) can induce cognitive deficits and 
perturb hippocampal function. Recent evidence indicates that even relatively short-term 
consumption of a WD is associated with signs of hippocampal pathology. For example, 10 
days maintenance on a WD led to reduced hippocampal and hypothalamic mRNA 
expression of GLUT1 and MCT1, genes involved in the transport of glucose and 
monocarboxylates (e.g., ketones, lactate, pyruvate), respectively [38]. Elevated levels of cell 
death in the hippocampus have also been reported after three days of WD exposure [39].
Extended maintenance on a WD leads to more pronounced neurological consequences. It 
has been known for some time that WD can lead to neuroinflammation [40–45] and reduced 
hippocampal and hypothalamic levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [46–48], 
a protein that serves to promote neurogenesis, synaptic transmission, and memory 
performance [46, 49–51]. Current research has demonstrated that sustained WD access can 
also impair long-term potentiation (a potential cellular mechanism for learning and memory) 
in the hippocampus and greater hippocampal formation [52, 53]. Further, WD consumption 
induces microglial activation in the hippocampus, which is improved following roux-en-y 
gastric bypass surgery and caloric restriction [54, 55]. Contemporary research by our 
laboratory has established that WD maintenance can alter the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a 
critical interface between the cirulatory and nervous systems. This BBB damage is indicated 
by reduced expression of the tight-junction proteins that comprise the BBB [56], and 
increases in BBB permeability to molecular tracers such as sodium fluorescein. These 
pathologies are most pronounced in the hippocampal formation [56, 57], which is believed 
to be especially vulnerable to insult as a result of its high nutrient demands and pronounced 
cellular plasticity [58].
It is currently unclear whether these pathological events influence each other, or occur 
independently. Neuroinflammation, for instance, has been shown to induce 
neurodegeneration [41, 59, 60] and BBB remodelling [61–63] under some circumstances. 
However, BBB damage (and the subsequent infiltration of blood-borne toxins) can also 
promote inflammation, microglial activation, and cell death; for this reason, BBB 
breakdown is hypothesized to contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative conditions 
such as Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis [64].
Maintenance on a WD impairs performance on hippocampal-dependent tasks
Consistent with evidence of hippocampal injury, WD-fed rodents are selectively impaired at 
numerous hippocampal-dependent tasks. The earliest of these reports indicated that diet 
could alter spatial performance in the Morris Water Maze [47, 65]. Subsequent reports

 confirmed and expanded these findings, first indicating that WD maintenance led to 
increased spatial reference and working memory errors on a radial-arm maze [66] and more 
recently demonstrating delayed acquisition and a bias toward a non-spatial “response” 
strategy on a two-arm choice task [67].
Another recent study showed that WD-fed rats that become obese, exhibit elevated 
hippocampal expression of the cytokine IL-1β, and show impairments on tasks of contextual 
fear conditioning. This behavioral effect was normalized after maintenance on standard 
laboratory chow or antagonism of the IL-1 receptor, indicating cytokines may influence 
hippocampal-dependent cognition, though the mechanism behind this effect is not yet 
known [42]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that performance on hippocampal-
dependent relational memory was perturbed in children with high levels of abdominal 
adiposity [68], or high saturated fatty acid intake [69], indicating these effects translate to 
humans and may impact individuals even at a young age.
We have also observed impairments in hippocampal-dependent serial feature negative (sFN) 
discrimination performance [see 70] after WD exposure [56]. This finding is of special 
interest because sFN perforamnce appears to require rats to learn a set of associative 
relations analogous to that shown in F.2, except that external cues are substituted for satiety 
signals [11]. Performance of the same rats on a hippocampal-independent simple 
discrimination problem involving the same reinforcer and response requirements was not 
impaired by WD, indicating that motivational or physical deficits did not underlie impaired 
sFN performance. Recent evidence suggests WD intake is associated with a distinct 
temporal pattern of sFN deficits. Performance is temporarily impaired after short-term (10 
day) access, remits, then returns again after a more extended (e.g., 90 day) period [57]. 
These deficits often correlate with the pernicous brain changes associated with WD intake 
and obesity [56, 57, 71]. Our research program has observed the greatest degree of 
pathology (e.g., BBB permeability) in rodents that also showed hippocampal-dependent 
cognitive dysfunction and excess weight gain [57, 67, 72]. This suggests that these diets 
promote weight gain as a result of their ability to disrupt hippocampal function, and 
therefore the inhibitory control of food intake.
Further, WD-fed animals are less adept at using interoceptive food cues to exert 
discriminative control over appetitive behavior. In a recent example [73], rats were 
simultaneously trained to use interoceptive (deprivation state) and exteroceptive (tone, white 
noise) cues to predict the presence of a sucrose reward. Rats were then either maintained on 
chow or switched to the WD, the latter of which weakened the ability of deprivation state to 
modulate food intake. WD-fed rats maintained the ability to utilize exteroceptive cues to 
predict reward, suggesting that a WD dimishes the discriminatory power of internal cues, 
relative to external stimuli.
The “outward” spiral
Here, we have described a vicious cycle in which high-energy diets harm the hippocampus 
(see F.1). This progressively weakens the ability of satiety signals to inhibit the capacity of 
environmental food-related stimuli to elicit appetitive behaviors, and results in positive

 energy balance, weight gain, and further harm to the hippocampus. We have described how 
this cycle may be initiated by WD consumption or the obesity that results from WD 
maintenance. However, it could commence with hippocampal injury resulting from disease, 
trauma, exposure to environmental toxins, or other factors. Rather than damaging the 
hippocampus directly, the effects of a WD, toxic substances, or illnesses could also alter 
hippocampal function indirectly by compromising the integrity of the BBB.
This model does not deny the possibility that, in addition to the dampening of inhibitory 
controls, external cues have become more powerful and prevalent elicitors of appetitive 
behavior. So-called obesogenic environments, which are rife with cheap, palatable, energy-
dense foods, are common throughout the industrialized world. Residents of these 
communities are bombarded with advertising and marketing materials that serve as almost 
constant reminders to eat [74–77]. However, we suggest that at least part of the rise in the 
power of environmental stimuli to evoke intake is a reduced ability of interoceptive satiety 
signals to offset that power.
In addition to obesogenic environmental stimuli, western and westernized societies contain 
numerous external cues designed to inhibit intake, such as nutritional information labels, 
public service announcements describing the health risks associated with obesity, frequent 
advertisements for dietary interventions, and widespread cultural penchants for slimness. 
Given the continuing obesity pandemic, the effectiveness of these “obesolytic” cues can also 
be questioned [but see 75, 78]. It may be that, like external cues in sFN discrimination 
problems, WD intake also reduces the ability of obesolytic environmental stimuli to 
antagonize the eating evoked by obesogenic environmental cues. This speculation suggests 
that interference with hippocampal-dependent mechanisms may diminish the potential for 
both interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli to inhibit appetitive and consummatory 
behaviors.
Regardless of its etiology, new findings summarized here indicate that the “outward spiral” 
may arise based, at least in part, on WD-induced pathologies that interfere with hippocampal 
function. In rats, this interference can be observed after relatively brief exposure (90 days or 
less) to a WD and may be manifested in the form of reduced ability to use interoceptive 
satiety signals to counter the power of food-related environmental stimuli to evoke 
appetitive and eating behaviors.

 discriminative control over conditioned responding to that of discrete auditory cues. After 
maintenance on Western diet, rats were unable to use deprivation state to predict reinforcement in 
the appetitive task above, but retained the ability to use discrete auditory cues. This indicates that 
Western diet and obesity diminish the potency of interoceptive, relative to external, cues to elicit 
behavior.

 Highlights
•
The hippocampus is a substrate for the contextual stimulus control of behavior.
•
Satiety signals are contextual cues that underlie the inhibitory control of eating.
•
The Western diet (WD) is associated with hippocampal pathology and 
dysfunction.
•
Both hippocampal damage and WD impair discriminative control by satiety 
cues.
•
WD may induce a vicious cycle of overeating and hippocampal-based memory 
decline.
