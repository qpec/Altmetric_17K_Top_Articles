USTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
U
UBACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that multi-
modal interventions that include exercise therapy 
may be effective for patellofemoral pain (PFP); 
however, no study has investigated the effects of 
trigger point (TrP) dry needling (DN) in people 
with PFP
.
U
UOBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of adding 
T
rP DN to a manual therapy and exercise program on 
pain, function, and disability in individuals with PFP
.
U
UMETHODS: Individuals with PFP (n = 60) 
recruited from a public hospital in Valencia, Spain 
were randomly allocated to manual therapy and 
exercises (n = 30) or manual therapy and exercise 
plus TrP DN (n = 30). Both groups received the 
same manual therapy and strengthening exercise 
program for 3 sessions (once a week for 3 weeks), 
and 1 group also received TrP DN to active TrPs 
within the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis 
muscles. The pain subscale of the Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS; 0-100 scale) 
was used as the primary outcome. Secondary 
outcomes included other subscales of the KOOS, 
the Knee Society Score, the International Knee 
Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evalu-
ation Form (IKDC), and the numeric pain-rating 
scale. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 
15-day (posttreatment) and 3-month follow-ups.
Analysis was conducted with mixed analyses of 
covariance, adjusted for baseline scores.
U
URESULTS: At 3 months, 58 subjects (97%) com-
pleted the follow-up. No significant between-group 
differences (all, P>.391) were observed for any 
outcome: KOOS pain subscale mean difference, 
–2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: –4.6, 0.4); IKDC 
mean difference, 2.3 (95% CI: –0.1, 4.7); knee pain 
intensity mean difference, 0.3 (95% CI: –0.2, 0.8). 
Both groups experienced similar moderate-to-large 
within-group improvements in all outcomes (stan-
dardized mean differences of 0.6 to 1.1); however, 
only the KOOS function in sport and recreation 
subscale surpassed the prespecified minimum 
important change.
U
UCONCLUSION: The current clinical trial sug-
gests that the inclusion of 3 sessions of TrP DN in 
a manual therapy and exercise program did not 
result in improved outcomes for pain and disability 
in individuals with PFP at 3-month follow-up.

P
atellofemoral pain (PFP) 
is one of the most com-
mon conditions in sports 
medicine, ranging from 
25% to 40% of knee complaints 
and affecting 25% of the general 
population,32,35 although there are limit-
ed epidemiological data. Patellofemoral 
pain is mainly characterized by diffuse 
retropatellar and peripatellar pain that 
is aggravated with squatting, prolonged 
sitting, and stair activities. Patellofemo-
ral pain often lacks a clear medical diag-
nosis and is diagnosed in the absence of 
other pathologies, for example, patellar 
tendinopathy, chondral defects, or knee 
osteoarthritis.32
Individuals suffering from PFP often 
seek physical therapy for the manage-
ment of their symptoms. Clinical practice

TrP DN. The primary outcome was knee 
pain intensity, assessed with the Knee 
injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score 
(KOOS) pain subscale, and the second-
ary outcomes were function, disability, 
and symptom severity, assessed with the 
KOOS, the Knee Society Score (KSS), and 
the International Knee Documentation 
Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation 
Form (IKDC), respectively. The current 
clinical trial was conducted following 
the CONSORT extension for pragmatic 
clinical trials.43 The study was approved 
by the Institutional Ethical Commit-
tee Board of the University of Valencia 
(Spain) (H1419939990178), and the trial 
was prospectively registered (www.clini-
caltrials.gov; NCT02514005). It should 
be noted that small changes were made 
after registration. These are described in 
detail below. These changes mainly affect 
the description of inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, clarification of the inclusion of 
strengthening exercises in both groups, 
and the inclusion of knee pain intensity 
as a secondary outcome.
Participants
Consecutive individuals with knee pain 
from a local regional hospital (Valencia, 
Spain) were screened for eligibility crite-
ria. Participants were invited to partici-
pate in the trial during a routine medical 
visit. To be included in the trial, potential 
participants had to have anterior knee or 
retropatellar pain of insidious onset for 
at least 6 months, provoked or associated 
with at least 2 of the following: prolonged 
sitting, prolonged kneeling, squatting, 
running, hopping, or stair walking. In 
addition, they also had to (1) be between 
19 and 60 years of age, (2) have a posi-
tive sign on the patellofemoral gliding 
test, (3) have a negative McMurray test, 
and (4) have full knee range of motion. 
They were excluded if they exhibited (1) 
radiological findings suggesting knee os-
teoarthritis; (2) a history of knee injury, 
including ligament sprain or meniscus 
tear; (3) a history of knee fracture; (4) a 
history of patellar dislocation; (5) lower 
extremity surgery; (6) knee joint effusion; 
their treatment, but there is no clinical 
trial investigating this topic.
Several therapeutic approaches are 
proposed for the management of TrPs, 
with manual therapies and dry needling 
(DN) being the most commonly used.8,9 
The only study that has investigated the 
effects of TrP manual therapy on PFP 
showed that application of manual com-
pression to TrPs surrounding the knee 
area reduced symptoms in the short and 
medium term.13 However, this study did 
not include any other intervention for 
PFP, such as exercise. Dry needling is 
defined as a “skilled intervention using 
a thin filiform needle to penetrate the 
skin that stimulates TrPs, muscle and 
connective tissue for the management of 
musculoskeletal pain disorders.”1 There 
is evidence suggesting that TrP DN may 
be effective for upper-quadrant pain im-
mediately after treatment and at medi-
um-term follow-up.22 Similarly, a recent 
review concluded that TrP DN was effec-
tive for lower-quarter pain syndromes 
in the short term; however, its effects on 
function have been questioned.29 Some 
studies included in this review support 
the use of TrP DN of the knee muscu-
lature for knee osteoarthritis19 or after 
knee replacement28; however, no study 
has previously investigated the effect of 
TrP DN in patients with PFP. Therefore, 
the objective of this study was to compare 
the effects of adding TrP DN to a manual 
therapy and exercise program on pain, 
function, and disability in people with 
PFP. We hypothesized that individuals 
receiving TrP DN combined with man-
ual therapy and exercises would exhibit 
greater improvements in pain, function, 
and disability than those receiving only 
manual therapy and exercises.
METHODS
Study Design
T
his randomized, parallel-group 
clinical trial compared 2 treatment 
protocols for the management of 
PFP: manual therapy and exercise ver-
sus manual therapy and exercise plus 
guidelines for management of patients 
with PFP recommend multimodal inter-
vention programs, including strength-
ening exercises of the hip and knee 
musculature, patellar taping, patient ed-
ucation, and activity modification.2 There 
is strong evidence supporting the use of 
exercise programs, with or without other 
conservative interventions, for manage-
ment of individuals with PFP to reduce 
pain and improve function.5,23,24 Yet, there 
is insufficient evidence to determine the 
most optimal form of exercises.40
It appears that knee and hip muscula-
ture plays a relevant role in PFP; there-
fore, soft tissue interventions targeting 
muscles, in combination with exercises, 
may be effective for the management of 
this condition. One potential rationale 
for soft tissue interventions is related to 
the hypothesis that trigger points (TrPs) 
can be involved in the production of pain 
in patients with PFP.38 Trigger points are 
defined as hypersensitive spots within 
taut bands of a skeletal muscle that are 
painful on palpation and usually elicit 
referred pain.38 Trigger points are clini-
cally classified as active or latent. If they 
are active, TrPs cause spontaneous pain, 
and the elicited referred pain reproduces 
the patient’s symptoms. If they are latent, 
TrPs do not reproduce any symptoms.38 
Torres-Chica et al39 observed that the 
referred pain elicited by active TrPs re-
produced symptoms in individuals with 
postmeniscectomy knee pain. Simons 
et al38 suggested that active TrPs in the 
knee muscles, particularly the vastus 
medialis and lateralis, may contribute to 
pain experienced by patients with PFP; 
however, no epidemiological data on the 
prevalence of TrPs in the knee muscles 
in patients with PFP are currently avail-
able. The only study that has investigated 
the presence of TrPs in this population 
reported that individuals with PFP ex-
hibited a higher prevalence of TrPs in the 
gluteus medius and quadratus lumborum 
muscles in association with a reduction 
in hip abduction strength.33 A potential 
role of active TrPs in patients with PFP 
may be related to better outcomes after

of clinical experience in this therapeu-
tic approach. Patients allocated to this 
group received the same manual therapy 
interventions and exercise program in-
struction in the first session, and TrP DN 
during the 3 treatment sessions. They also 
performed the exercise program and were 
monitored by the clinician. As the vas-
tus medialis and vastus lateralis are the 
most relevant muscles for neuromuscular 
control of the knee, TrP DN was applied 
to these muscles using a pragmatic ap-
proach. If multiple active TrPs were found 
in the same muscle, the clinician selected 
the most painful for applying the TrP DN 
procedure. The TrP DN intervention was 
performed with 0.32 × 40-mm dispos-
able stainless-steel needles (Novasan, SA, 
Madrid, Spain) inserted into the skin over 
the TrP. In the current trial, the fast-in and 
fast-out technique described by Hong15 
was applied. Once the active TrP was lo-
cated, the overlying skin was cleaned with 
alcohol. The needle was inserted into the 
skin at the TrP area until the first local 
twitch response was obtained. The depth 
of the needle depended on the muscle and 
ranged from 15 to 20 mm for the vastus 
medialis to 30 to 35 mm for the vastus 
lateralis muscle (APPENDIX A). Once the 
first local twitch response was obtained, 
the needle was moved up and down (3- to 
5-mm vertical motions with no rotations) 
at approximately 1 Hz until no more local 
twitch responses were elicited.
Outcome Measures
Clinical records of all participants in-
cluded questions regarding the location 
of the symptoms, aggravating and reliev-
ing factors, intensity, duration, and previ-
ous treatments. Outcomes were assessed 
at baseline, 15 days (postintervention), 
and 3 months after the end of therapy 
(follow-up) by assessors blinded to the 
treatment allocation of the subjects.
The primary outcome of the cur-
rent trial was pain severity, as assessed 
with the pain subscale of the KOOS.34 
Secondary outcomes, including disabil-
ity and symptoms associated with knee 
pain, were assessed with the most com-
manual therapy techniques. All patients 
received the following interventions at all 
treatment sessions: lumbopelvic thrust 
manipulation, 
anterior-to-posterior 
nonthrust manipulation of the hip, lat-
eral-to-medial nonthrust manipulation 
of the knee, proximal tibiofibular joint 
posterior-to-anterior nonthrust manipu-
lation, and rearfoot distraction thrust 
manipulation. For each thrust manipula-
tion technique, a maximum of 2 attempts 
was permitted to achieve cavitation or the 
audible pop, as perceived by the therapist 
and/or the patient. In addition, soft tissue 
interventions included 3 repetitions of 30 
seconds of stretching of the hip external 
rotator muscles, and 5 minutes of fascial 
manipulation on the patellofemoral re-
gion.30 These techniques are described 
in detail in APPENDIX A (available at www.
jospt.org).
There is no consensus on what exer-
cises should be prescribed to patients 
with PFP; however, strengthening of the 
quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteus me-
dius muscles  is indicated.5,24 Therefore, 
the exercise program consisted of the 4 
following exercises: mini-squats, seated 
knee extensions, lunges, and lateral 
steps. Each exercise was conducted in 3 
sets of 15 repetitions.23 Each repetition 
began with the concentric phase and 
was followed by the eccentric phase of 
the exercise. The exercise program was 
taught to the patient by an experienced 
physical therapist in the first treatment 
session and monitored in the subse-
quent 2 sessions (once a week) during 
the treatment period (3 weeks). Specific 
details regarding the exercise program 
are provided in APPENDIX B (available at 
www.jospt.org). Patients were asked 
to perform the exercise program on an 
individual basis twice per day for the 
3-week duration of the treatment pro-
gram. No specific progression in exercise 
load was established.
Patients allocated to the needling 
group also received TrP DN to active TrPs 
in the quadriceps muscle, whose referred 
pain reproduced pain symptoms, from a 
second physical therapist with 10 years 
or (7) use of physical therapy for treat-
ing knee pain within the previous year. 
As a modification of the trial registration, 
because 20% to 25% of subjects attend-
ing general medical practice may have a 
fear of needles,42 patients with a fear of 
needles or a coagulation disorder were 
excluded to avoid potential risk in the 
needling group. All participants signed 
an informed-consent form prior to their 
participation in the study.
Randomization and Blinding
Patients were randomly assigned to re-
ceive manual therapy and exercise alone 
or in combination with TrP DN. Con-
cealed allocation was conducted using a 
computer-generated randomized table 
of numbers, created by a statistician who 
was not otherwise involved in the trial 
and who did not participate in analysis 
or interpretation of the results. Indi-
vidual and sequentially numbered index 
cards with the random assignment were 
prepared. The index cards were folded 
and placed in sealed opaque envelopes. 
A different researcher opened the enve-
lope and proceeded with treatment al-
location. Outcomes were assessed by a 
clinician blinded to the treatment alloca-
tion group.
Interventions
All participants received 3 sessions, once 
per week, during the treatment period of 
the study (3 weeks). Each session lasted 
approximately 30 to 40 minutes (15 to 
20 minutes for manual therapy, 10 to 15 
minutes for exercises, and 2 to 5 minutes 
for TrP DN).
Both groups received the same man-
ual therapy and strengthening exercise 
program from a manual physical thera-
pist who had 15 years of experience in 
manual therapy interventions and was 
blinded to the treatment allocation. Be-
cause there is a relationship between the 
biomechanics of the lower extremity and 
PFP,31,41 the manual therapy component 
consisted of a comprehensive thrust and 
nonthrust manipulation protocol, includ-
ing lumbopelvic, hip, knee, and ankle

dropout percentage of 15% was expect-
ed, so 30 patients were included in each 
group.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using 
SPSS software (Version 21.0; IBM Corpo-
ration, Armonk, NY) and was conducted 
according to intention-to-treat analysis 
for patients in the group to which they 
were allocated. When any data were 
missing, the multiple-imputation meth-
od was used.36 The mean, standard de-
viation, and 95% confidence interval 
were calculated for each variable. The 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed a nor-
mal distribution of the variables (P>.05). 
Baseline demographic and clinical vari-
ables were compared between both 
groups using independent Student t tests 
for continuous data and chi-square tests 
of independence for categorical data. 
Data analysis included 3-by-2 repeated-
measures analyses of covariance, with 
time (baseline, 15 days postintervention, 
3 months postintervention) as the with-
in-subject factor, group (manual therapy 
and exercise versus manual therapy and 
exercise plus TrP DN) as the between-
subject factor, and adjusted for base-
line data for evaluating between-group 
differences in the outcomes. The main 
hypothesis of interest was the group-by-
time interaction, with a Bonferroni-cor-
rected alpha of .017 (3 time points). To 
enable comparison of between-group ef-
fect sizes, standardized mean differences 
were calculated by dividing mean score 
differences between groups by the pooled 
standard deviation.
RESULTS
B
etween July 2015 and March 
2016, 80 consecutive patients with 
knee pain were screened for eligi-
bility. Sixty (75%) satisfied the inclusion 
criteria, agreed to participate, and were 
randomly allocated into the manual 
therapy and exercise group (n = 30) or 
the manual therapy and exercise-plus-
TrP DN group (n = 30). Randomization 
ities (9 items); and (3) current knee func-
tion (1 item). The response to each item 
(which will differ slightly, depending on 
the item) is scored and summed to give a 
total score ranging from 0 to 100, where 
higher scores represent better function, 
that is, less limitation in daily or sporting 
activities and the absence of symptoms.18 
The IKDC has shown excellent reliability 
and validity, with a minimal detectable 
change of 8.8 to 15.6 points in subjects 
with knee problems.14 A more recent 
study has reported that the IKDC pre-
sents excellent test-retest reliability and 
a minimal detectable change of 8.5% in 
individuals with PFP.10
As a modification of the trial registra-
tion, we included the intensity of knee 
pain as a secondary outcome. Therefore, 
an 11-point numeric pain-rating scale21 
(0, no pain; 10, maximum pain) was 
used to assess the patient’s current level 
of knee pain during daily life activities. 
As no MIC has yet been established for 
knee-related pain, a change of 2 points 
or a 30% decrease in pain from baseline 
can be considered the MIC in individuals 
with chronic musculoskeletal pain.11,37
Treatment Side Effects
Patients were asked to report any adverse 
event that they experienced during any 
part of the study. In the current study, an 
adverse event was defined as sequelae of 1 
week in duration with any symptom per-
ceived as distressing and unacceptable 
to the patient and that required further 
treatment.4 Particular attention was giv-
en to the presence of post-DN soreness 
within the group receiving TrP DN. Pa-
tients were advised to report any increase 
in their symptoms after any session.
Sample-Size Determination
The sample-size calculations were based 
on detecting treatment differences of 16.7 
units on the KOOS pain subscale,7,34 as-
suming a standard deviation of 17.5, a 
2-tailed test, an alpha level of .05, and 
a desired power (beta) of 90%. The esti-
mated desired sample size was calculated 
to be at least 25 subjects per group. A 
mon questionnaires used in the litera-
ture.6 The KOOS is a 42-item self-report 
questionnaire that assesses patients’ 
opinions about their knee and associ-
ated problems.34 All items are rated on 
a 5-point Likert scale (0-4), and their 
scores are transformed to a 0-to-100 
scale (0, extreme knee problems; 100, no 
knee problems). The following domains 
are included in the KOOS: (1) pain fre-
quency and severity during functional 
activities (9 items); (2) symptoms such 
as the severity of knee stiffness and the 
presence of swelling, grinding/clicking, 
catching, and range-of-motion restric-
tion (7 items); (3) difficulty experienced 
during daily life activity (17 items); (4) 
difficulty experienced with sport and/
or recreational activities (5 items); and 
(5) knee-related quality of life (4 items). 
Each dimension is scored separately as 
the sum of all corresponding items. A re-
cent meta-analysis found that the KOOS 
exhibits adequate content validity, in-
ternal consistency, test-retest reliability, 
construct validity, and responsiveness 
for all subscales.7 Minimum important 
change (MIC) values for the KOOS sub-
scales have been reported: pain, 16.7; 
symptoms, 10.7; function in daily living, 
18.4; function in sport and recreation, 
12.5; and knee-related quality of life, 15.6 
points, respectively.7
The KSS evaluates pain and related 
function in 2 sections: pain and function 
scores.17 The pain score uses pain, stability, 
and range of motion as the main param-
eters, whereas the functional score utilizes 
walking distance and stair climbing as the 
main parameters. Each score is graded 
from 0 to 100 points, where higher values 
represent better function or lower pain.17 
The KSS has demonstrated substantial 
reliability.25,27 There are no available data 
related to the MIC of the KSS.
The IKDC is a self-questionnaire de-
signed to detect changes in symptoms, 
function, and sports activities due to knee 
pain.18 It includes 3 domains: (1) symp-
toms, including pain, stiffness, swell-
ing, locking/catching, and giving way (7 
items); (2) sports (1 item) and daily activ-

strengthening exercises, patient educa-
tion, and activity modification for the 
management of PFP.2,5,23,24,40 Those recom-
mendations do not identify manual thera-
py and/or TrP DN as potentially effective 
interventions, not because there is scien-
tific evidence against these approaches, 
but because there is a lack of studies per-
formed examining these 2 interventions. 
The current trial is the first to integrate 
manual therapy interventions and a 
strengthening exercise program in people 
with PFP. The results demonstrated that 
both groups, regardless of the application 
of TrP DN, exhibited positive outcomes 
in pain and function, which supports the 
notion that the combination of manual 
therapy and strengthening exercises may 
be effective for this population. Neverthe-
less, we should recognize that the stan-
dardized manual therapy protocol used in 
strengthening exercise program did not 
result in improved outcomes in individu-
als with PFP immediately after treatment 
and at 3-month follow-up. While both 
groups achieved similar and significant 
improvements from baseline to both 
follow-up periods, we cannot confirm the 
clinical relevance of these results because 
changes in the main outcome, pain severi-
ty (KOOS pain subscale), and the remain-
ing secondary outcomes did not exceed 
their respective MIC values. Further, we 
cannot be certain whether changes were 
the result of the interventions or simply 
due to the passage of time, because we 
did not include a control group, although 
this would have been unlikely due to the 
chronicity of the symptoms.
Current evidence and clinical guide-
lines recommend the use of multimodal 
intervention programs consisting of 
resulted in similar baseline characteris-
tics for all variables (TABLE 1). One patient 
was lost at 3-month follow-up in each 
group for personal reasons. The rea-
sons for ineligibility are found in FIGURE 
1, which provides a flow diagram of pa-
tient recruitment and retention. None of 
the participants in either group reported 
receiving other interventions during the 
study, excluding the use of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs on an as-need-
ed but sporadic basis. Twelve patients 
assigned to the manual therapy and 
exercise-plus-TrP DN group (40%) ex-
perienced muscle soreness after TrP DN, 
which resolved spontaneously within 36 
to 48 hours. No other adverse events were 
reported by the participants.
Adjusting for baseline outcomes, the 
mixed-model analysis of covariance did 
not reveal significant group-by-time 
interactions for the primary outcome 
(KOOS pain subscale: F = 0.253, P = 
.555) or any of the secondary outcomes 
(knee pain: F = 0.284, P = .596; IKDC: F 
= 0.616, P = .436; KOOS symptoms sub-
scale: F = 0.049, P = .825; KOOS func-
tion in daily living subscale: F = 0.585, 
P = .448; KOOS function in sport and 
recreation subscale: F = 0.218, P = .642; 
KOOS knee-related quality of life sub-
scale: F = 0.748, P = .391; KSS pain sub-
scale: F = 0.217, P = .805; KSS function 
subscale: F = 0.526, P = .592). There was 
a main effect for time for all outcomes 
(all, P<.001), showing that both groups 
exhibited similar changes in pain intensi-
ty (FIGURE 2), function, and disability at all 
follow-up periods (TABLES 2 and 3). Both 
groups exhibited moderate-to-large with-

the present study was not associated with 
the presence or absence of impairments in 
the lumbopelvic, hip, knee, or ankle areas 
in all patients. As patients with PFP rep-
resent a heterogeneous population, future 
studies should consider the application of 
manual therapy interventions after a clin-
ical examination of the patients.
Clinical reasoning for the application 
of TrP DN in PFP is based on the hy-
pothesis that TrPs induce motor control 
disturbances,26 accelerated muscle fatiga-
bility,12 and increased motor activation16 
in the affected and related muscles. As 
mechanical (ie, disruption of the contrac-
tion knot or increase of sarcomere length) 
and neurophysiological (ie, decrease of 
peripheral inputs and activation of cen-
tral pain pathways) mechanisms are re-
ceptive to TrP DN,3,11 we hypothesized 
that the mechanical stimulus exerted 
by the needle into the knee musculature 
would be able to increase the effective-
ness of the strengthening exercise pro-
gram and that, therefore, patients would 
potentially achieve better pain and func-
tional outcomes. However, the results 
of this clinical trial did not confirm that 
hypothesis. One possible explanation for 
this may be that subjects allocated to the 
TrP DN group received 3 sessions, based 
on the authors’ clinical experience, as no 
current scientific data exist on the ad-
equate frequency and dose of needling. 
We do not know if a greater number of 
TrP DN sessions would have resulted in 
between-group differences. Further, TrP 
DN was only applied on active TrPs in the 
vastus medialis and lateralis muscles; it is 
possible that other muscles, such as the 
rectus femoris, hamstring, or gastroc-
nemius, could also exhibit active TrPs 
and, therefore, should potentially also be 
treated with TrP DN.
The results of this trial should be con-
sidered according to some potential limi-
tations. First, we recruited patients from 
a single hospital, which may decrease the 
generalization of our results. Multicenter 
studies controlling for site and clinician 
effects (cluster effects) might enhance 
the generalizability of the results. Second,

not include a sham needling technique, 
so blinding patients was not possible. Fi-
nally, it is possible that subgroups of in-
dividuals with PFP who will benefit from 
TrP DN exist and should be identified.20
CONCLUSION
T
he current study indicates that 
the inclusion of TrP DN in a mul-
timodal 
manual 
therapy 
and 
strengthening exercises program did not 
result in better outcomes for pain and 
cise program did not progress in load or 
repetitions during the treatment period. 
Similarly, adherence to the exercise pro-
gram was not strictly tracked. These fac-
tors may have limited the benefits of the 
exercise program in the current trial. In 
fact, the limited clinical effect considered 
in this clinical trial was based on pub-
lished pooled data7; it is possible that the 
specific MIC for patients with PFP would 
be smaller than the MIC considered in 
our trial, but no available data exist for 
this specific population. Fifth, we did 
we only included a follow-up period of 3 
months, so we do not know whether long-
term evolution of the patients would ex-
hibit the same results. Third, because we 
did not include a no-intervention control 
group, we cannot be sure that the ob-
served improvements are due to the natu-
ral history of the condition, although this 
is unlikely. Fourth, we applied a treatment 
period of 3 weeks. It is possible that more 
sessions of manual therapy and exercise 
would lead to better outcomes. Addition-
ally, it should be considered that the exer-

(30-40 minutes) intervention sessions 
were provided, and the follow-up period 
was only 3 months. Additionally, there 
was no control group, so we cannot be 
certain whether the within-group chang-
es were the result of the treatments deliv-
ered or simply the passage of time.
at the vastus medialis and lateralis mus-
cles, in addition to manual therapy and 
exercise, did not result in superior out-
comes over manual therapy and exercise 
alone. Changes were observed in all 
primary and secondary outcomes; how-
ever, only 1 secondary outcome (Knee 
injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score function in sport and recreation 
subscale) exceeded the minimal impor-
tant change. It is not known whether 
additional sessions or targeting other 
knee muscles would have changed the 
outcome. Future studies are warranted 
to investigate this.
CAUTION: The generalizability of the re-
sults may be limited, as we only recruited 
patients from a single hospital, only 3 
disability in individuals with PFP imme-
diately after treatment and at 3-month 
follow-up. Both groups achieved similar 
improvements in pain and function, sug-
gesting that the application of manual 
therapy and strengthening exercises may 
be effective for individuals with PFP, but 
this requires further investigation.UU
KEY POINTS
FINDINGS: The addition of trigger point 
(TrP) dry needling (DN) to a manual 
therapy and exercise program for pa-
tients with patellofemoral pain did not 
provide additional benefits compared 
with manual therapy and exercise alone.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides evi-
dence that 3 sessions of TrP DN directed

APPENDIX A
DESCRIPTION OF MANUAL THERAPY INTERVENTIONS
Technique: lumbopelvic thrust manipulation 
applied on the right side
Description: the technique is performed with 
the patient supine. The therapist stands on the 
side opposite of that to be manipulated. The 
patient is passively moved into side bending 
toward the side to be manipulated. The patient 
crosses his or her arms over the chest. The 
therapist passively rotates the patient, and then 
delivers a high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust to 
the anterior superior iliac spine in a posterior 
and inferior direction
Technique: proximal tibiofibular joint posterior-
to-anterior nonthrust manipulation
Description: the patient is supine with the knee 
flexed at 90° and the feet over the table. The 
clinician grasps the patient’s fibular head and 
uses the opposite hand to stabilize the contra-
lateral side of the knee. Posterior-to-anterior 
forces are applied over the fibular head
Technique: anterior-to-posterior nonthrust  
manipulation of the hip
Description: the technique is performed with 
the patient supine. The therapist stands on 
the same side as that to be mobilized. The 
therapist holds the anterior and posterior parts 
of the hip and then performs an anterior-to-
posterior mobilization of the femur on the 
acetabulum
Technique: rearfoot distraction thrust 
manipulation
Description: the patient is supine, with the 
ankle off the treatment table. The clinician 
grasps the patient’s ankle/foot, with the fingers 
interlaced around the dorsum of the foot and 
thumbs on the plantar aspect. The clinician 
induces pronation and slight dorsiflexion of the 
foot, induces a “slack” in a caudal/distraction 
direction, and applies a high-velocity, low-
amplitude force in a caudal direction
Technique: lateral-to-medial nonthrust 
manipulation of the knee
Description: the patient is supine, near the 
edge of the table, with the leg to be treated off 
the edge of the table. The clinician places the 
patient’s leg between the knees and holds the 
treated knee at the joint line with both hands 
in slight flexion (around 10°). Lateral-to-medial 
glides (varus-to-valgus force) are added
Technique: stretching of the hip external rotator 
muscles
Description: the patient is supine, with the hip 
and knee flexed to 90° and neutral abduction/
adduction. The cephalic hand of the clinician is 
placed on the lateral part of the knee, whereas 
the caudal hand grasps the ankle. The hip is 
placed in internal rotation until the barrier is 
reached. This position is maintained for 30 
seconds

APPENDIX A
Technique: fascial manipulation on the 
patellofemoral region
Description: the patient lies supine, with the 
lower extremity over the table. The therapist 
places the elbow over the anterior distal part 
of the rectus femoris and applies a longitudinal 
stroke distally to the knee. A total of 8 to 10 
strokes are applied for 5 minutes
Technique: dry needling on active trigger points 
in the vastus medialis muscle
Description: with the patient supine, the needle 
is inserted perpendicular to the muscle surface 
directly into the trigger point, as identified by 
flat palpation
Technique: dry needling on active trigger points 
in the vastus lateralis muscle
Description: with the patient supine, the needle 
is inserted perpendicular to the muscle surface 
directly into the trigger point, as identified by 
flat palpation

APPENDIX B
GUIDELINE FOR STRENGTHENING EXERCISES
Exercise: mini-squats
Description: the patient stands in an upright posi-
tion. From that position, he or she performs a squat 
to approximately 90° of knee flexion while maintain-
ing the knee behind the toes, and then returns to 
the initial upright position
Exercise: front lunges
Description: from an upright standing position, the 
patient performs a lunge, leading with the involved 
lower extremity while maintaining the knee behind 
the toes
Exercise: seated knee extension
Description: from a seated position, the patient 
performs a long-arc quad from 90° of knee flexion 
to complete extension
Exercise: lateral step (lunge)
Description: from an upright standing position, the patient performs a lateral lunge, leading 
with the involved lower extremity while maintaining the knee behind the toes, and then returns 
to the initial upright position. The exercise is repeated to both sides
