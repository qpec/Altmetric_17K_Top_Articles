ABSTRACT 
There is an unmet need for effective treatment strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in 
patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Until recently, attention 
in patients with HFpEF was almost exclusively focused on the left side. However, it is now 
increasingly recognized that right heart dysfunction is common and contributes importantly to 
poor prognosis in HFpEF. More insights into the development of right heart dysfunction in 
HFpEF may aid to our knowledge about this complex disease and may eventually lead to 
better treatments to improve outcomes in these patients. In this recommendation paper from 
the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, the Committee on Heart 
Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction reviews the prevalence, diagnosis and 
pathophysiology of right heart dysfunction and failure in patients with HFpEF. Finally, 
potential treatment strategies, important knowledge gaps and future directions regarding the 
right side in HFpEF are discussed.

INTRODUCTION 
For many years, the right ventricle (RV) was largely neglected in the consideration of left-
sided heart failure. In the last two decades however, several studies have clearly demonstrated 
that RV dysfunction (RVD) is not only common in left heart failure, its presence also strongly 
contributes to increased morbidity and mortality.(1,2) The mechanisms behind the 
development of RVD in patients with left heart failure have been well established, but these 
data were, until recently, almost exclusively obtained in patients suffering from heart failure 
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).(3) 
It is now evident that RVD is highly prevalent and contributes to poor prognosis in patients 
with left-sided heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).(4-7) However, the 
underlying pathways that lead to RVD in HFpEF are less clear. In addition, patients with 
idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or pulmonary fibrosis, and patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also present with signs and symptoms of heart 
failure with a preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Better insight into the 
mechanisms causing the development of RVD and its clinical role in HFpEF may aid to 1) 
our understanding of this complex disease and 2) develop novel treatment strategies to 
improve outcomes. The present recommendation paper reviews the pathophysiology, potential 
treatment strategies, knowledge gaps and future directions regarding the right-side of the heart 
in HFpEF. 
 
PREVALENCE  
One of the first studies that investigated RV function in HFpEF was conducted by Puwanant 
et al. in 2009.(8) This prospective study included 51 patients with HFpEF and demonstrated a 
prevalence of 33%, 40% and 50% for RVD, as categorized by abnormalities in RV fractional 
area change (FAC), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid annular 
 6 
 
systolic velocity (RV S’), respectively.(8) Since then, several other studies have been 
published, examining RVD in HFpEF.(4,5,9-11) Determining exact prevalence data for RVD 
is challenging, because HFpEF severity across different studies has varied, as well as the 
echocardiographic methods, criteria and cut-off values employed for the assessment of RVD. 
Some of these cut-off values for RVD are less well established or have also changed over 
time.(12-14) Aschauer et al. used cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for the 
detection of RVD in 171 patients with HFpEF, and RVD (defined as RV ejection fraction 
<45%) was present in 19% of the patients,(10) whereas Melenovsky et al. reported a 
prevalence of 33% for RVD (defined as RV FAC <35%) in 96 patients.(4) 
It is important to keep in mind that the prevalence of RVD may also be influenced by 
inclusion criteria that are applied to define HFpEF. The classic signs of left- and right-sided 
heart failure are not mutually exclusive. For instance, the often used Framingham criteria for 
the diagnosis of HFpEF include signs consistent with right-sided decompensation, such as 
hepatomegaly and peripheral oedema. Furthermore, the inclusion of patients with 
(concomitant) pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) caused by other mechanisms other than left 
heart failure (e.g. severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension) may result in the overrepresentation of RVD unrelated to concomitant left-sided 
HF.(15,16) Furthermore, the application of different exclusion criteria among individual 
studies may also affect the prevalence rate of RVD. For instance, renal dysfunction is strongly 
associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and RVD.(17) The prevalence of RVD may 
therefore be relatively higher in community-based studies compared to clinical trials, because 
(severe) renal dysfunction is often an exclusion criterion in the latter. In addition, because 
signs suggestive of RVD are used to diagnose heart failure in community studies, there may 
be a relatively higher identification of HFpEF patients with RVD compared to HFpEF 
 7 
 
patients without RVD in these studies compared to clinical trials in which more often 
stringent HFpEF criteria are used. 
Finally, it is challenging to define the prevalence of RVD considering the small number of 
patients among individual studies. In a recent meta-analysis, in which pooled data of RV 
function in HFpEF was summarized from multiple studies that used HFpEF criteria according 
to the 2016 European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Management Guidelines, the 
prevalence of RVD was 18%, 28% and 21% using RV FAC, TAPSE and RV S’, 
respectively.(7) Thus despite variable reports, methods and criteria, the best available current 
data indicate that RVD is present in at least one-fifth and potentially up to 30-50% of patients 
with HFpEF. 
Given the heterogeneity of previous studies investigating the right heart in HFpEF, we 
recommend for future studies that HFpEF should be stringently defined according to the 
current criteria for the diagnosis of HFpEF.(18)  
 
PROGNOSIS 
The annual mortality rate in HFpEF ranges from ~10% in clinical trials up to almost 30% in 
several population-based studies, of which cardiovascular deaths comprise 51-60% in 
epidemiological studies and ~70% in clinical trials.(19) Most cardiovascular deaths in HFpEF 
can be attributed to end-stage circulatory failure.(19) It is now increasingly evident that RVD 
is also a major predictor of the clinical course of HFpEF.(7) Melenovsky et al. reported a 2.2-
fold increased risk for all-cause mortality per 7% decrease in FAC, after adjustment for 
pulmonary pressures.(4) In the study by Aschauer et al., the hazard ratio for the composite 
endpoint of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalisation was 4.9 for patients with RV ejection 
fraction <45% on CMR, after adjustment for e.g. diabetes mellitus and pulmonary 
pressures.(10) Pooled data from individual studies recently showed that the risk of mortality 
 8 
 
increases with ~26% per 5 mm decrease in TAPSE and with ~16% per 5% decrease in 
FAC.(7) 
In a recent prospective study in 230 patients with HFpEF, 38 (16.5%) patients died during a 
mean follow-up of 30 months. Of these, 55% died with the presence of end-stage RV failure, 
defined as 1) echocardiographic evidence of RVD and 2) clinical signs of right-sided 
decompensation such as ascites, liver enzyme elevation, peripheral oedema and jugular 
distension.(20)  
 
DIAGNOSIS 
Right heart dysfunction versus failure 
The distinction between RVD and right heart failure may be likened to that between LV 
systolic dysfunction and left heart failure, in that the former is defined by abnormal values of 
functional parameters, whereas the latter is defined by haemodynamic decompensation with 
typical clinical signs and symptoms. 
Right heart dysfunction is present when a measure of RV function falls outside the 
recommended range of normal (Table 1).(13) In the absence of clear normal values, the range 
that is published varies and hinges on agreement to what defines normal and abnormal. Right 
ventricular dysfunction may be asymptomatic, but there may be evidence of adaptive RV 
remodelling in response to increased afterload such as RV hypertrophy, which seems present 
in ~22% of patients with HFpEF and ~45% of patients with PH-HFpEF.(21) Preliminary 
evidence suggests that there may be increased reliance on a contraction pattern more suited 
for increased afterload to preserve global systolic function (e.g. reduced longitudinal 
shortening but enhanced transverse contraction), analogue to the LV.(22) Hence, multiple 
measurements that reflect RV systolic function are preferably used. We herein propose that 
RV systolic dysfunction is present in HFpEF if 1) at least two echocardiographic parameters 
 9 
 
for RV systolic function are below their recommended cut-off value (Table 1), or 2) if RV 
ejection fraction measured with CMR is <45%. Still, it must be noted that the majority of data 
regarding RVD is obtained from patients with HFrEF instead of HFpEF. 
Right heart failure is a clinical diagnosis with signs and symptoms of systemic congestion in 
combination with structural and/or functional abnormalities of the right heart.(23) Right heart 
failure may be caused by RVD itself, RV remodelling including annular dilation causing 
tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dysfunction or occasionally by pulmonary valve 
disease. These changes ultimately cause symptoms of exertional dyspnoea and reduced 
exercise capacity, and/or signs of right-sided decompensation such as jugular venous 
distension, hepatomegaly, ascites and peripheral oedema (Table 1).(23) Ultimately after 
longstanding right-sided pressure and/or volume overload, the right heart is unable to provide 
adequate blood flow through the pulmonary circulation at a normal central venous pressure 
and cardiac output decreases which ultimately leads to death, if not treated adequately.(23)  
It is important to acknowledge that staging phases of RVD and right heart failure vary of time 
and some patients may not have RVD at rest, but rather during exercise. In contrast to left-
sided heart failure, there is currently no clear staging of right heart failure, although attempts 
have been made to develop a staging system.(3) For right heart failure in the setting of 
HFpEF, we herein propose a staging system of RVD and right heart failure (Table 2). Of 
note, although lower extremity oedema is a classic sign of chronic right-sided congestion, in 
the acute setting the causes of lower extremity oedema are more complex, seem not entirely 
associated with HF severity and central venous pressure, and can mislead clinicians, at least in 
patients hospitalized for acute heart failure.(24) 
 
Echocardiography 
 10 
 
Right ventricular function can be assessed using several methods. Echocardiography is 
generally the first-line tool for this purpose. TAPSE is most frequently used and has an 
independent prognostic value in HFpEF.(5,10,25-27) The currently recommended lower limit 
cut-off for TAPSE is <17mm,(14) although prior studies frequently used <16 mm. Fractional 
area change (with a lower limit of normal <35%(14)) is also commonly used, and is predictive 
of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisations in HFpEF.(4,10,26,28). In a recent 
meta-analysis, both TAPSE (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.26/5 mm decrease [95% CI 1.16-
1.38], p<0.0001) and FAC (HR 1.16/5% decrease [95% CI 1.08-1.24], p<0.0001) were shown 
to be associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in HFpEF.(7) 
Thus, for TAPSE and FAC there is the most available evidence in relation to prognosis in 
patients with HFpEF. Consequently, these two measures should preferably be assessed, if 
possible, in all patients with HFpEF. Other echocardiographic indices related to RVD used in 
HFpEF include RV S’ (<9.5 cm/s(14))(4,8,9,29-31) and RV longitudinal strain (>-
20%(14)).(9,31) The latter has advantages because it is angle-independent and has the 
potential ability to detect subtle, regional myocardial changes in HFpEF, when conventional 
echocardiographic parameters remain within the normal range.(31) In addition, TAPSE and 
RV S’ are sometimes falsely elevated when the LV is hyper-dynamic, due to tethering effects 
of the LV secondary to both ventricles sharing myocardial muscle fibres.(32) RV strain may 
be lesser influenced by these tethering effects in this context. The association between RV 
strain and prognosis has been described in patients with HFpEF,(28) but further evidence 
from other prospective HFpEF cohorts, using dedicated RV-focused strain imaging, is still 
needed. Furthermore, the RV index of myocardial performance (RIMP) or RV Tei-index is an 
index of global RV function. Higher values of RIMP indicate impaired myocardial 
performance, with upper limit of normal >0.43 (when using pulsed Doppler) and >0.54 (when 
using tissue Doppler).(14) 
 11 
 
Assessment of pulsed-wave Doppler for tricuspid inflow (i.e. tricuspid E/A ratio) or hepatic 
vein diastolic flow, tissue Doppler for lateral tricuspid annular diastolic velocity, and right 
atrial size, may all be useful to measure RV diastolic function.(33) However, these diastolic 
indices are influenced by age, respiration, heart rate, pulmonary pressures and other 
covariates.(33) Right ventricular diastolic function is not routinely assessed in clinical 
practice but dysfunction is present, at least during exercise, early in the course of HFpEF and 
in parallel with LV diastolic dysfunction, probably due to combined myocardial processes that 
affect both ventricles simultaneously.(34) 
Echocardiography is also the first-line tool for the evaluation of increased right-sided 
pressures and its effect on the RV in the setting of PVD.(13,35) Given the high prevalence of 
PH in HFpEF, it is recommended to asses direct and indirect echocardiographic signs related 
to increased pulmonary pressures in all patients with HFpEF. This assessment includes 
several conventional measures, such as estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
(PASP in mmHg) using the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet velocity and estimated central 
venous pressure, RV basal end-diastolic diameter (>41 mm), RV hypertrophy (wall thickness 
>5 mm), right atrial dilatation (right atrial end-systolic area >18 cm2) and inferior vena cava 
size and collapsibility for the estimation of right atrial pressure.(13,35) More specific 
measures that can be obtained for a non-invasive estimation of pulmonary vascular resistance 
(PVR) include RV outflow tract (RVOT) notching on the pulse-wave Doppler profiles, and 
the peak TR velocity/RVOT velocity-time integral.(35) For the latter, a value <0.18 suggests 
elevated PVR to be unlikely.(35) Echocardiography can also be used to differentiate between 
PAH and PVD-HFpEF, using left and right atrial size ratio and interatrial and interventricular 
septal bowing.(35) In patients with PH-HFpEF, interventricular septal bowing may be less 
pronounced than in PAH due to typically higher left-sided systolic pressures in HFpEF 
compared to patients with PAH. 
 12 
 
 
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 
The assessment of the right heart using echocardiography may be challenging, due to its 
complex geometry, limited echocardiographic windows and high prevalence of obesity and  
COPD in HFpEF that make imaging and interpretation challenging. Therefore, CMR is 
increasingly being used and is currently recommended in patients with suspected or 
established heart failure (Class IC recommendation) for the assessment of myocardial 
structure and function (including the right heart), in subjects with poor acoustic window 
(taken account for cautions/contra-indications to CMR).(18) Reduced RV ejection fraction on 
CMR is associated with worse prognosis in HFpEF,(10,36) and <45% is most commonly used 
as cut-off for RVD.(37) CMR is also reliable in measuring RV volume and hypertrophy, 
which may be useful in the setting of PVD-HFpEF. In addition, the pulmonary artery to aorta 
diameter ratio seems useful as non-invasive indicator of the presence of PH in HFpEF.(38)  
Quantification of focal and diffuse myocardial fibrosis is also feasible by CMR, using late 
gadolinium enhancement, T1 time and extracellular matrix fraction.(38,39) Lower LV 
myocardial post contrast T1 time is associated with higher extracellular matrix and collagen 
content, and predicts poor prognosis in HFpEF.(39) Late gadolinium enhancement can 
typically be observed near the septal insertion points of the RV, and this finding is reported in 
patients with PH(40) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,(41) as well as in patients with various 
aetiologies of HFpEF.(10) As for the RV itself, the myocardial wall is often too thin for 
reliable quantitative assessment of T1 time using the standard modified look-locker 
sequences. However, high-resolution look-locker images have higher pixel density and may 
be reliable for the estimation of extracellular volume content in the thin-walled RV 
myocardium.(42) 
 
 13 
 
Right ventricular-pulmonary artery coupling 
The RV is exquisitely sensitive to changes in afterload,(43) and this heightened afterload-
dependence is exaggerated in patients with HFpEF.(4) In view of the frequent presence of 
PVD and increased RV afterload in HFpEF, consideration of RV-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) 
coupling is important. This was recently demonstrated in a trial of dobutamine in HFpEF, 
where greater pulmonary vasodilator response in HFpEF (compared to non-heart failure 
controls) resulted in improved RV-PA coupling.(29) 
The gold standard assessment of RV-PA coupling involves invasive pressure-volume loops, 
but this method is cumbersome and not without risk.(43) Recent studies have examined RV-
PA coupling non-invasively in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH).(44-46) Guazzi et 
al. proposed an echocardiographic estimate of RV-PA coupling in heart failure, using both 
TAPSE and PASP.(47) Reduced TAPSE/PASP ratio was associated with worse prognosis, 
both in HFrEF and in HFpEF,(11,47-49) and a prognostic cut-off of this ratio was identified: 
<0.36.(11,47,49) In a study with parallel invasive pulmonary haemodynamic assessment, the 
TAPSE/PASP ratio was gradually reduced across the PA resistance-compliance hyperbolic 
relationship, which suggests that this simple, non-invasive marker could reflect the ‘operating 
load’ the RV has to work against and this ratio may already been reduced when cardiac output 
is still preserved.(48) Reduced TAPSE/PASP ratio also seems to be a reliable non-invasive 
parameter to identify HFpEF patients with a high likelihood of having additional pre-capillary 
PH.(49) 
Finally, RV stroke work index can be estimated non-invasively in patients with heart failure, 
by calculating the RV contraction pressure index as the product of TAPSE and the 
transtricuspid systolic pressure gradient.(50,51) 
 
Right ventricular function during exercise 
 14 
 
Evaluation of right-sided filling pressures, RV-PA coupling and RV systolic and diastolic 
function during exercise has the potential to enhance haemodynamic assessment at different 
stages of HFpEF.(34) Patients with advanced HFpEF and concomitant PVD may have normal 
RV functions at rest, but RVD may be present during exercise, if the ability of the pulmonary 
vasculature to dilate in response to increased cardiac output is lost. RV free wall strain may be 
a sensitive indicator for this phenomenon. On the contrary, impaired RV function at rest may 
not necessarily also imply a worse adaptive contractile response during exercise in patients 
with heart failure.(52) An additive role for cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with 
PAH is recently highlighted in the 2016 European Society Guidelines on the Diagnosis and 
Management of PH,(53) and may also be useful to explore the various phenotypes and 
different levels of risk in patients with heart failure.(52,54) 
Remarkably, studies by Borlaug et al. have shown that RV-PA uncoupling occurs during 
exercise, even in the earlier stages of HFpEF.(34) Elevation in left atrial pressure and 
impaired left atria strain response during exercise (despite preserved LV ejection fraction) is 
pathognomonic for HFpEF,(55,56) and this acutely shifts the PA resistance-compliance 
relationship leftward, causing an increase in pulsatile RV load.(56,57) Assessment of PA 
pressure-flow relationships with exercise has been proposed as a useful and prognostically 
relevant metric to evaluate vascular reserve in HFpEF,(58) and some HFpEF phenotypes, 
such as those with obesity-related HFpEF, may display greater abnormalities in RV-PA 
coupling during exercise that potentially move forward towards therapeutic implications.(59)  
 
AETIOLOGY 
Pulmonary hypertension 
The most important mechanism of RVD in HFpEF is contractile impairment and afterload 
mismatch in the setting of PH-HFpEF (Figure 1).(4,5) Pulmonary hypertension, which 
 15 
 
includes both isolated post-capillary and combined post- and pre-capillary PH, is a common 
finding in patients with HFpEF and is associated with worse symptoms, reduced exercise 
capacity, higher natriuretic peptide levels and increased hospitalisation rates and 
mortality.(49,60,61) In response to increased vascular load, the RV adapts by increased 
myocardial contractility and wall thickness (“coupling”).(43) In the next stage, the RV dilates 
and heart rate increases to maintain sufficient cardiac output, which will lead to increased wall 
stress and oxygen demand.(43) Ultimately after longstanding high metabolic demand, the RV 
is unable to maintain cardiac output (“uncoupling”), which is accompanied by signs and 
symptoms of severe right heart failure.(43)  
In a population-based study from Lam et al., up to 83% of all-comers with HFpEF had non-
invasive evidence of PH (as defined by echocardiography-derived PASP >35 mmHg).(62) In 
a later invasive study by Melenovsky et al. in 96 patients with HFpEF (on the basis of 
Framingham criteria, LV ejection fraction ≥50% and increased LV filling pressures), 81% of 
the patients had PH (defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mmHg).(4) On the 
contrary, Leung et al. previously reported PH to be present in 53% in their invasive study, 
although they only included patients with high LV end-diastolic pressure, and ~22% of 
patients were diagnosed with left heart failure.(63) Data from the large TOPCAT clinical trial 
revealed a much lower PH prevalence rate of 36%, based on tricuspid jet velocity >2.9 
m/s.(64) The presence of PH may thus vary considerably among different HFpEF populations 
and may be influenced by the different stages of HFpEF severity enrolled in the different 
studies (e.g. clinical trials versus community-based studies), as well as the frequent exclusion 
of comorbidities in most clinical trials that are strongly associated with PH, such as severe 
renal dysfunction and significant pulmonary disease.(7,65) If pulmonary haemodynamics are 
not invasively assessed, it remains unclear which amount of included patients with heart 
 16 
 
failure and a preserved LV ejection fraction have PH due to (concomitant) pulmonary arterial 
hypertension/fibrosis, COPD or other systemic diseases. 
 
Ventricular interdependence 
One of the key features in HFpEF is LV diastolic dysfunction. Although, global LV ejection 
fraction is by definition preserved in HFpEF, there is evidence of LV contractile 
dysfunction.(66) Because both ventricles share myocardial muscle fibres and the 
interventricular septum, approximately 20 to 40% of RV systolic performance can be 
attributed to LV contraction.(32) This concept of systolic ventricular interdependence might 
be the mechanism behind the previously reported associations between subtly reduced LV 
systolic function and the higher prevalence of RVD in HFpEF.(4,5,10) In the setting of 
regional LV contractile dysfunction despite preserved global LV ejection fraction in HFpEF, 
the direct contribution of LV contraction to RV systolic function is also reduced. This left-to-
right ventricular contribution is also lost in the setting of RV-pacing in HFpEF. 
Diastolic ventricular interdependence (DVI) is also important in HFpEF. Approximately 30 to 
40% of LV diastolic pressures is related to extrinsic forces including right heart pressure and 
pericardial restraint.(67) Even slight increase in pulmonary pressure already leads to a 
leftward septal shift and impaired LV diastolic compliance induced by DVI in the absence of 
prior intrinsic LV disease.(68) This effect is already present in patients with even mild to 
moderate PH, and may aggravate clinical manifestation of (exertional) dyspnoea.(68) 
Diastolic ventricular interdependence with inhomogeneous septal movement can be assessed 
using 2-D speckle tracking echocardiographic strain (Figure 2). Diastolic ventricular 
interdependence might also belong to the mechanisms that contribute to septal mechanical 
delay and asynchronicity, which can be found in ~20% of the patients with HFpEF.(69) 
Haemodynamic changes induced by DVI are also accompanied by neurohormonal 
 17 
 
activation.(68) Recent data have shown that DVI is increased in HFpEF patients with obesity, 
coupled with increases in right heart remodelling and dysfunction.(59) Intriguingly, the 
degree of DVI is synergistically enhanced as PA pressure increased in these patients. An 
important repercussion of this phenomenon is that higher pulmonary venous pressure is 
required to achieve a given LV transmural distending pressure, which is then transmitted back 
to further increase of RV afterload.(59) 
Finally, aortic stiffness, reduced systemic compliance and ventricular-arterial coupling, 
especially in the hypertensive patient, contribute importantly to the diagnosis and clinical 
syndrome of HFpEF.(70,71) Both the main pulmonary artery and the aortic root are situated 
close to each other (Figure 3C). In children with PAH, severe dilation of the pulmonary 
artery was recently reported to be associated with limited aortic expansion during systole, 
which may have impact on LV performance and left-sided haemodynamics.(72) Whether 
there is existence of such “vascular interdependence” in patients with PVD-HFpEF and severe 
PA dilatation, needs further study.  
 
Atrial fibrillation 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is also common in HFpEF, with a prevalence that ranges between 21 
to 54% in individual registries and trials,(73,74) and approaches 67% when considering the 
entire lifetime of a patient.(75) Atrial fibrillation is independently associated with exercise 
intolerance and poor prognosis, and is in part a reflection of worsening HFpEF.(76) Several 
studies have indicated a link between AF and the presence of RVD in HFpEF.(4,5,11,76) 
Both may relate to HFpEF, in which increased LV filling pressures leads to left atrial stretch 
and remodelling on the one hand;(74) and furthermore to increased pulmonary pressures and 
RV afterload. Indeed, HFpEF patients with AF have higher pulmonary capillary wedge 
 18 
 
pressure (PCWP) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), compared to HFpEF patients in 
sinus rhythm.(76)  
Left atrial function and adverse remodelling is important in the context of heart failure.(77) 
As left atrial function deteriorates, particularly with development of AF, there is more 
profound pulmonary vascular dysfunction and consequent impairment in RV function in 
patients with HFpEF.(78) However, it is not just afterload mismatch, as RV shortening is 
worse in HFpEF patients with AF for any given PA pressure load.(4) Possible mechanisms 
might be related to decreased RV longitudinal contraction and rhythm irregularity with 
negative inotropic effects in the setting of AF,(79,80) although we lack prospective studies 
that addressed such hypotheses in HFpEF. Conversely, RVD is also a strong predictor of the 
occurrence of AF after acute decompensated heart failure.(81)  
Atrial fibrillation is also prevalent patients with PH without left heart failure (~20 to 
23%),(82,83) and its presence is also associated with more right atrial dilation and higher 
right atrial pressures, compared to PH patients without AF.(83) Reduced TAPSE and right 
atrial dilatation was previously linked to both history and development of AF in patients with 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.(84) To what extent right atrial overload beyond left atrial 
overload may facilitate the onset or progression of AF, in patients with PVD-HFpEF, needs to 
be evaluated. 
 
Coronary artery disease 
Coronary artery disease is associated with more advanced impairment of RV function in both 
HFpEF and HFrEF.(4,5,11) Although patients with large myocardial infarctions do not 
typically present as HFpEF, coronary artery disease is also common in HFpEF, up to 50-
66%.(85) Although, the RV has the ability to recover from an acute ischaemic insult and 
isolated RV infarction is rare,(86,87) single occlusion of proximal right coronary artery or of 
 19 
 
dominant circumflex coronary artery may result in RV systolic dysfunction while global LV 
systolic function is preserved. Furthermore, approximately one-third of HFpEF patients with 
coronary artery disease had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting.(85) In 
patients undergoing such major cardiac surgery and/or valve replacement, TAPSE may be 
considerably reduced, even up to one year after surgery.(88-90) Reduction in RV filling and 
contraction after cardiac surgery seems independent of cardiopulmonary bypass and is not 
seen in patients receiving percutaneous interventions.(91) The significant reduction in TAPSE 
may therefore be mediated by pericardial adhesions following pericardiectomy.(91) Potential 
other mechanisms have also been described, such as cytokine release, RV infarction due to 
ischemia or air emboli, and inflammation or effusion post-surgery.(91)  
Besides the contribution of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, coronary 
microvascular dysfunction is also reported in patients with HFpEF without history of 
obstructive coronary artery disease.(92) Microvascular dysfunction might be an early but 
important stage in the pathogenesis in HFpEF, and may be equally important for both 
ventricles. Further research regarding the importance of myocardial flow reserve and 
microvascular dysfunction is clearly warranted.(93) 
 
Non-cardiac comorbidities 
Several non-cardiac comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, 
COPD and hypertension are known to adversely impact myocardial function and remodelling 
via systemic pathways, including inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The adverse 
impact of these processes in HFpEF has traditionally been focused on the LV.(94) However, 
given that these involve systemically circulating factors, there may plausibly be simultaneous 
involvement of the RV, resulting in RV remodelling and dysfunction. Co-existence of LV and 
RV remodelling in HFpEF has been described by Borlaug et al. Patients with HFpEF had 
 20 
 
impaired RV reserve and high filling pressures with exercise, even in the early stages of the 
disease, and similar to changes observed in the LV.(34) 
In subjects without cardiovascular disease, obesity may also be related to changes in RV 
structure and function.(95,96) Among the different comorbidities, obesity has recently been 
shown to be associated with more profound abnormalities in RV-PA coupling.(59) As 
compared to HFpEF patients without obesity, patients with obesity display more RV 
remodelling, greater plasma volume expansion, more ventricular interdependence and 
pericardial restraint, higher filling pressures, and greater pulmonary vascular dysfunction 
during exercise. Right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction in obesity may be related in part 
to excessive volume loading, which is typical of obesity-related HFpEF.(59) This hypothesis 
is supported by recent data revealing the development of RV dilatation and dysfunction 
following creation of arteriovenous fistula for dialysis access.(97)  
Several HFpEF-associated comorbidities such as COPD may contribute to increased RV 
afterload via direct pulmonary vascular effects (Figure 3),(98) or impact RV remodelling by 
load-independent pathways.(99) Long standing systemic hypertension leads to LV 
hypertrophy and stiffening, but may also result in RV remodelling, independent of pulmonary 
pressures.(100,101) This phenomenon has been explained by circulating or paracrine 
vasoactive and trophic factors, targeting both ventricles,(102) and pressure-driven septal 
remodelling which in turn influences RV performance.(101,103) 
Furthermore, systemic hypertension often interacts with obesity and diabetes mellitus in the 
development of RV remodelling and dysfunction in patients with the metabolic 
syndrome.(104-106) In the diabetic heart, early signs of RV diastolic dysfunction may be 
observed, even prior to development of RV systolic dysfunction.(107)  
Renal dysfunction and HFpEF often co-exist, and each condition may contribute to 
progression of the other in a vicious cycle via inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.(108) 
 21 
 
In left-sided heart failure, RVD is also strongly associated with renal dysfunction, mainly due 
to venous congestion resulting from chronic backward failure.(109) In a large cohort of 299 
patients with HFpEF, renal dysfunction was also reported to be independently associated with 
higher PA pressures and lower RV free wall strain.(17) In addition, renal dysfunction strongly 
facilitates hypervolemia, which is a major factor of right-sided decompensation, even in mild 
stages of right heart dysfunction.(110) 
In some patients, wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is an unrecognized cause of 
HFpEF.(111) The RV may also be involved in advanced ATTRwt (Figure 4), although its 
clinical relevance is currently unknown. 
 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY 
In left-sided heart failure, the RV myocardium may be subject to several stressors, where 
pressure overload in the setting of pulmonary vascular disease is most prominent. Chronic 
pulmonary congestion in left-sided heart failure leads to morphological changes of the 
pulmonary vasculature, including muscularization of pulmonary venules, haemangiomatosis-
like endothelial cell proliferation in pulmonary capillaries and pulmonary arterial remodelling 
with intimal hypertrophy.(60) Pulmonary vascular remodelling in left-sided heart failure is 
different and seems more reversible than the remodelling patterns seen in patients with 
idiopathic PAH, in which there are more irreversible neointimal lesions such as concentric 
laminar intimal fibrosis and plexiform lesions.(112) The reversibility of severe PVD in 
patients with left-sided heart failure was previously demonstrated in a small group of patients 
with end-stage left-sided heart failure and presumably fixed high PVR. After implantation of 
LV assist device support, a progressive decrease of PVR and normalization of pulmonary 
pressures was observed.(113) 
 22 
 
When the RV myocardium is exposed to increased afterload, several neurohormonal and 
molecular pathways are activated, such as cytokine release, activation of the endothelin 
system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the autonomic nervous system, 
and release of natriuretic peptides (Figure 5).(3) The myocardial wall of the normally 
unstressed RV thickens in order to maintain cardiac output. This remodelling pattern 
eventually leads to an increased mismatch between myocardial blood supply and oxygen 
demand, resulting in myocardial ischemia and downstream effects such as collagen formation 
and fibrosis.(114) Oxidative stress triggers the production of reactive oxygen species, limits 
the availability of nitric oxide (NO) and significantly contributes to cell necrosis and 
apoptosis through release of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, 
interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Oxidative stress and cytokine release degrade the extracellular 
matrix and myofibrils, and enhance collage formation, resulting in RV dilatation and 
myocardial fibrosis. The activation of the endothelin system is important in the setting of 
PVD and resultant RV failure.(3) Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor and has pro-
inflammatory and proliferative properties. Enhanced expression of endothelin-1 and 
endothelin receptors is seen in experimental pulmonary artery banding models.(115) Elevated 
levels of catecholamines and overstimulation of the β-adrenergic receptors in the setting of 
RV failure, further stimulates maladaptive myocardial remodelling. For instance, in the 
presence of RV failure due to pulmonary artery banding, decreased expression of β-adrenergic 
receptors in the RV was observed.(116)  
Apelin is an endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor that is present on endothelial cells, 
vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes.(117,118) The apelin-APJ signalling 
pathway is a modulator of smooth muscle tone and myocardial contractility and can be 
regarded as a cardio-protective neurohormonal system.(119,120) Disruption of apelin-APJ 
signalling seems to play an important role in vascular remodelling and hyperproliferation of 
 23 
 
pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells in PVD.(121) The apelin-APJ system is 
also down-regulated in patients with systolic left-sided heart failure and may therefore be a 
potential therapeutic target in this context.(122,123) 
Besides these cellular and molecular pathways involved in response to increased afterload, the 
changes in the pulmonary vasculature itself also leads to impaired pulmonary function and gas 
exchange.(60) Reduced diffusion capacity of the lung in patients with PVD-HFpEF is 
strongly associated with exercise intolerance and increased mortality.(124,125) 
Finally, several of these pathways may also be activated in HFpEF – independent of PVD – 
and may be due to direct effects of comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes 
mellitus, which activate the release of reactive oxygen species via inflammatory cytokines and 
induce endothelial dysfunction and adverse remodelling of cardiomyocytes.(94) However, in 
patients with HFpEF, the LV displays more concentric myocardial remodelling, stiffening and 
diastolic dysfunction, while the RV shows more eccentric remodelling with hypertrophy, 
dilatation and systolic failure as a result of predominant increased afterload (Figure 5). 
 
TREATMENT 
The high prevalence of RVD and its potent prognostic consequences in HFpEF support the 
development of treatment strategies targeting the right side in HFpEF. The primary strategies 
of interest are 1) the reduction of pulmonary pressures in patients with PH-HFpEF using 
diuretics for congestion, and potentially novel vasoactive drugs targeting the cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate and endothelin pathways, and 2) to directly target RV myocardial tissue. 
Until now, many previous attempts have demonstrated neutral results.(60) There is even 
concern that several PH-targeted therapies could rather have detrimental effects in HFpEF, 
due to rapid increases of LV filling pressures and resulting acute pulmonary oedema.(126) As 
a consequence, there are currently no established strategies to treat PVD and RVD in HFpEF, 
 24 
 
and the current European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the Management of 
Pulmonary Hypertension therefore provides a class III recommendation for PAH-approved 
treatment for patients with PH due to left heart disease (group 2 PH).(53) Potential treatment 
strategies are summarized in Table 3. The majority of these therapies target the different 
pathways described above. 
There is currently an unmet need for further study into the development of PVD in patients 
with HFpEF. It is important to acknowledge that the presence of PVD in patients with a 
preserved LV ejection fraction is a wide spectrum.(16,127) On the one side of this spectrum 
patients may present with “pure PVD” with high PVR and normal pulmonary capillary wedge 
pressure (both at rest and with exercise), and on the opposite side of this spectrum patients 
may have “pure HFpEF” with increased pulmonary wedge pressure and normal PVR.(127) 
The former group of patients responses well to PAH-targeted therapies while this response to 
these specific therapies gradually decreases along this spectrum towards patients with pure 
HFpEF.(16) It may therefore be recommended to invasively measure pulmonary 
haemodynamics in HFpEF patients with suspected PH and to evaluate the position of each 
patient on this spectrum and select for specific treatment options. Furthermore, a 
multidisciplinary strategy with cooperation of a pulmonologist may be recommended. Of 
note, drugs approved for PAH are also not recommended in patients with PH due to lung 
diseases (class IIIC recommendation).(53)  
In clinical practice, in many patients with RVD in HFpEF, diuretics are not given in 
sufficiently high dosages to ensure decongestion/euvolemia. Hypervolemia is a major driver 
of decompensation in left-heart failure and early identification of patients who are at risk for 
diuretic resistance is important.(51,128) In addition, patients should be counselled to avoid 
excessive fluid and salt intake, and especially obese older patients with stable HFpEF benefit 
from caloric restriction and aerobic exercise training.(129) It is now recommended to 
 25 
 
encourage regular aerobic exercise training in all patients with heart failure, to improve their 
functional capacity and symptoms (class IA recommendation).(18)  
 
Cyclic guanosine monophosphate and nitric oxide pathway 
Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and its target protein kinase G (PKG) are 
regulators of ion channel conductance and cellular apoptosis, and have an effect on vascular 
smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilatation and increased blood flow.(130) Phosphodiesterase 
(PDE) inhibitors prevent the breakdown of cGMP and thereby enhance the vasodilator effects 
of cGMP.(130)  
The PDE type 5 inhibitor sildenafil is an established drug for patients with World Health 
Organization Group 1 PAH.(53) Sildenafil has also been tested in HFpEF, yet with mixed 
results.(131-133) In a recent post-hoc analysis from a Dutch trial, conducted in 52 HFpEF 
patients mean PAP ≥25 mmHg and PCWP ≥15 mmHg, sildenafil did not improve TAPSE and 
RV S’ compared with placebo.(134) In a sub analysis from the RELAX trial in HFpEF 
patients with and without PH, sildenafil also did not improve TAPSE. An earlier Italian trial, 
in patients with HFpEF and predominant combined post- and pre-capillary PH, did show 
improvement in TAPSE and invasively assessed RV contractile state in the sildenafil 
treatment group.(131) The findings of a partial functional recovery in advanced RV failure 
associated with HFpEF by sildenafil were paralleled by a study providing mechanistic 
insights (i.e. restoration of cGMP pulmonary vascular concentration) on reported benefits. 
Although sildenafil will not be beneficial in all patients with HFpEF, it remains to be 
evaluated whether selected HFpEF patients with high PVR will benefit from PDE type 5 
inhibition. Very recently, the PDE type 5A inhibitor vardenafil was tested in an animal model 
with Zucker diabetic fatty rats. It was reported that the development of HFpEF (defined as 
myocardial stiffness and diastolic dysfunction) was prevented and the activity of the cGMP-
 26 
 
PKG axis was restored in this experimental diabetes mellitus-associated HFpEF model.(135) 
Whether early treatment with PDE type 5 inhibition may prevent worsening heart failure in 
humans with diabetes mellitus-associated HFpEF is unknown.(136) 
PDE type 9A regulates natriuretic peptide-stimulated rather than NO-stimulated cGMP. PDE 
type 9A is expressed in human myocytes, is upregulated in the setting of myocardial 
hypertrophy and heart failure, and has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target in 
stress-induced heart disease.(137) Its potential as a target in patients with HFpEF and 
predominant RV failure is currently unknown. 
Riociguat is a soluble guanylate-cyclase stimulator, that induces vasodilatation, has 
antifibrotic, antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory properties, and is effective in patients with 
PVR.(53) In the small DILATE-1 trial, riociguat did not improve mean PAP in patients with 
PH-HFpEF, but did increase stroke volume and cardiac index.(138) In addition, riociguat 
significantly decreased systolic blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance and RV end-
diastolic area, without changing PCWP or PVR.(138) Riociguat is currently being tested in 
another phase 2 trial for its effect on pulmonary haemodynamics as well as RV size and 
function on cardiac MRI, in patients with PH-HFpEF (NCT02744339). 
Another phase 2 with the soluble guanylate-cyclase stimulator vericiguat in HFpEF 
(SOCRATES-PRESERVED, NCT01951638) has recently been completed. Vericiguat was 
well tolerated, did not change NT-proBNP and left atrial volume at 12 weeks compared with 
placebo, but was associated with improvement in quality of life.(139) RV-related endpoints 
were not included in the initial study protocol.(140)  
Recent data from the Swedish Heart Failure Registry in an unselected HFpEF population 
demonstrated that the use of conventional nitrates was not associated with improvements in 
all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalizations.(141) In the NEAT-HFpEF randomized 
controlled trial, the patients with HFpEF who received isosorbide mononitrate were less 
 27 
 
active, and did not have better quality of life or submaximal exercise capacity compared to 
patients who received placebo.(142) 
Inorganic nitrite administration represents a promising new therapy being tested in HFpEF. 
Nitrate and nitrite were formerly considered as inert by-products of NO metabolism, but it is 
now clear that these anions function as an important in vivo reservoir to generate NO under 
hypoxic circumstances in a NO synthase-independent fashion. Nitrite is reduced to NO by a 
variety of proteins including haemoglobin and myoglobin. This reaction is enhanced in the 
setting of hypoxia and acidosis, as develops in the tissues and veins during exercise. 
Intravenous nitrite was shown to reduce PA pressure and biventricular filling pressures in 
patients with HFpEF, with greater effect during exercise.(143) Cardiac output reserve was 
also enhanced. Inhaled, nebulized sodium nitrite has also been shown to reduce PA pressures 
and lower filling pressures at rest and during exercise, with improvements in PA 
compliance.(144,145) While acute administration of nitrite did not reduce PVR in the entire 
group of patients with HFpEF, it did lower PVR in those patients with higher PVR.(144) 
Nitrite is currently being tested in a National Institute of Health sponsored trial: Inorganic 
Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in HFpEF (INDIE-HFpEF, NCT02742129).  
In conclusion, impairment of the NO-cGMP signalling pathway contributes to increased 
pulmonary pressures in patients with HFpEF. Currently, no therapies that specifically act on 
the NO-cGMP pathway have clearly proven to be beneficial in patients with HFpEF. 
However, there is minor evidence that some patients with HFpEF, especially those with 
advanced PVD and additional pre-capillary PH, might benefit from such therapies and several 
clinical trials are currently underway (Table 3).  
 
Endothelin pathway 
 28 
 
Endothelin receptor antagonists such as Bosentan are effective in World Health Organization 
Group 1 PAH.(53) On the contrary, Bosentan exerts rather detrimental effects in patients with 
PH-HFpEF due to acute pulmonary oedema.(126) Sitaxsentan, a selective endothelin type A 
(ETA) receptor antagonist, was shown to improve treadmill exercise time in patients with 
HFpEF treated for 24 weeks.(146) 
Recently, it was demonstrated that endothelin-1 levels were elevated in humans with chronic 
stable HFpEF and these patients had increased myocardial hypertrophy.(147) In the same 
translational study, the endothelin-1 receptor antagonist macitentan reduced myocardial 
hypertrophy and stiffening via antihypertrophic mechanisms in a murine HFpEF model.(147) 
Endotelin-1 levels were also reported to be higher in HFpEF patients with diabetes mellitus, 
compared to patients without diabetes mellitus.(148) Whether there is a link between 
endothelin-1 levels, diabetes mellitus and RV hypertrophy and dysfunction in HFpEF, 
remains unknown. The effects of macitentan on RV performance in HFpEF also require 
further study. Macitentan was recently under study in patients with combined post- and pre-
capillary PH due to LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction (MELODY-1, NCT02070991) and 
the primary results were presented at the 2017 Congress of the American College of 
Cardiology.(149) The macitentan group showed no change in PVR during 12 weeks. 
Moreover, this group was more likely to experience the primary composite endpoint of 
significant fluid retention or worsening functional class.(149) 
 
Prostacyclin pathway 
Prostacyclin is produced by endothelial cells and induce vasodilatation, inhibits platelet 
aggregation and has anti-proliferative effects.(53) Prostacycline analogues such as 
epoprostenol and iloprost are established treatments for patients with PAH.(53) Chronic 
intravenous epoprostenol is associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with 
 29 
 
HFrEF, although the exact mechanisms are unclear.(150) In a small pilot study in patients 
with PH-HFpEF, acute inhalation of iloprost resulted in a significant reduction in PAP and 
PVR after 15 minutes.(151) No data regarding any effect of iloprost on RV performance in 
HFpEF are currently available. Treprostinil is another prostacyclin analogue that is indicated 
for the treatment of PAH,(53) and will be tested in patients with PH-HFpEF for its effect on 
6-minute walk distance, functional class and NT-proBNP levels (NCT03037580). 
 
Neurohormonal inhibition 
Chronic increased afterload of the RV activates the autonomic nervous system and the RAAS 
system. However, there is insufficient evidence whether neurohormonal inhibition is 
beneficial in the setting of RV failure.  
Nebivolol is a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist with vasodilator properties. Nebivolol is 
reported to be favourable in patients with PAH.(152) The role of beta-blockade in HFpEF is 
uncertain. Data from the SENIORS trial suggest that nebivolol might be as useful in patients 
with HFpEF as it was for patients with HFrEF,(153) and observational data from the Swedish 
Heart Failure Registry also suggests that beta-blockers may be beneficial in HFpEF.(154) 
However, the ELANDD trial did not show improvement by nebivolol in 6-minute walking 
distance in 116 patients with HFpEF, but no subgroup analyses for patients with RVD are 
available.(155) Hence, there is clearly insufficient evidence for the use of nebivolol in HFpEF 
to give it a place in the current guidelines, and more adequately powered studies are needed. 
Nebivolol is currently being tested in a phase 4 trial for its potential effect on PVR and 6-
minute walk distance in patients with PH-HFpEF (NCT02053246).  
Carvedilol is a β1/β2/α1-blocker, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and might 
prevent pulmonary vascular remodelling.(156) Previously, carvedilol resulted in significant 
improvement in E/A ratio in patients with HFpEF from the SWEDIC trial.(157) Carvedilol 
 30 
 
has also been demonstrated to improve RV systolic function in patients with HFrEF,(158) yet 
any effect on the RV in HFpEF is currently unknown. 
Several randomized controlled trials that investigated RAAS inhibition in HFpEF have not 
demonstrated improvement in outcome, and thus RAAS inhibition has no recommendation in 
the guidelines for the treatment of HFpEF.(18,159-161) However, observational data suggests 
that RAAS inhibition may be beneficial in heart failure with LV ejection fraction ≥40%.(162) 
RAAS inhibition was beneficial in several animal models with PVR, since it was reported to 
prevent 
RV 
hypertrophy, 
dysfunction 
and 
fibrosis, 
but 
published 
results 
are 
conflicting.(156,163,164) In an earlier trial, captopril was tested in 14 male patients with 
HFrEF in combination with reduced RV ejection fraction, and captopril was demonstrated to 
improve RV function and filling pressures.(165) Furthermore, it was also reported in another 
small study in 40 patients with systemic hypertension, that RAAS inhibition resulted in 
improvement in RV global function, independent of changes in systemic blood pressure.(166)  
The TOPCAT trial investigated the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone in patients with 
HFpEF and demonstrated no reduction in the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular 
death, aborted cardiac arrest or hospitalization for heart failure.(167) However, spironolactone 
slightly reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalizations compared with placebo. In addition, 
subgroup analysis demonstrated that the primary outcome was met in the patients with 
elevated natriuretic peptides at baseline.(167) In the mechanistic Aldo-DHF trial in patients 
with HFpEF, spironolactone reduced E/e’, an estimate of LV filling pressures and leaded to 
improvements in cardiac structure (i.e. reduction in LV mass index) and reduction in NT-
proBNP levels, but failed to improve symptoms or exercise capacity.(168) Aldosterone 
antagonists should be considered in the setting of fluid overload in patients with PAH.(53) It 
was reported in an animal model of PAH that spironolactone and eplerenone improved 
pulmonary haemodynamics.(169) In a sub study from the TOPCAT trial in 239 patients with 
 31 
 
serial echocardiographic assessment, randomization to spironolactone was not associated with 
significant changes in RV function and pulmonary pressures.(170) 
Based upon the observation that beta-adrenergic stimulation improves pulmonary vascular 
function in HFpEF patients more than controls,(29) the Inhaled Beta-adrenergic Agonists to 
Treat Pulmonary Vascular Disease in Heart Failure With Preserved EF (BEAT-HFpEF, 
NCT0288563) is a randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the inhalation of the 
β2-adrenergic agonist albuterol on changes in PVR in patients with HFpEF, with resting 
PCWP >15 mmHg or PCWP ≥25 mmHg with exercise. 
 
Other drugs and experimental treatments 
Ranolazine is an inhibitor of the late sodium channel current and is approved for the treatment 
of chronic stable angina. In a small open-label pilot study in 11 patients with symptomatic 
PAH, ranolazine (1,000 mg twice daily) was administered for three months and was 
demonstrated to be safe and associated with improvement in functional class, reduction in RV 
size and improvement in RV strain during exercise.(171) In another non-randomized pilot 
study in 10 patients with HFpEF and isolated post-capillary PH, mean PAP and PCWP 
significantly decreased, PVR remained unchanged, and 6-minute walking distance increased, 
during six months treatment with ranolazine (1,000 mg daily).(172) Clearly, further evidence 
in adequately powered, prospective studies is needed to investigate the effects of ranolazine 
on prognostic endpoints in PH-HFpEF. 
Milrinone is a PDE type 3 inhibitor that has been studied for reduction of RV afterload in 
patients undergoing LV assist device implantation,(173) in an experimental dog model with 
pulmonary artery banding and RV failure,(174) and in infants with PH.(175) Recently in a 
small study, Kaye et al. investigated the use of intravenous milrinone in 20 patients with 
HFpEF and demonstrated improvement in pulmonary haemodynamics during exercise.(176) 
 32 
 
Recent recommendation suggests that levosimendan may be preferentially indicated over 
dobutamine in patients with pulmonary hypertension caused by left heart disease.(110) 
Sacubitril/valsartan is an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor that has been proven to 
improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF.(177) Sacubitril/valsartan has previously also been 
tested in a phase II trial in 301 patients with HFpEF, but did not result in a reduction of TR 
velocity during 36 weeks treatment, compared with placebo.(178) 
Although the evidence is limited, calcium channel blockers may be effective for the treatment 
of systemic hypertension in HFpEF. Verapamil might have a beneficial effect on symptoms 
and diastolic dysfunction in patients with congestive heart failure and normal LV systolic 
function.(179) Calcium channel blockers are recommended in specific patients with PAH who 
demonstrate a favourable response to acute vasodilator testing, but close follow-up is 
warranted.(53) 
Digoxin has no recommendation in the guidelines for the treatment of HFpEF.(18,180) There 
is also no convincing data available for the use of digoxin in the setting of PH.(53) In a small, 
non-randomized prospective study in 17 patients with PAH in combination with RV failure 
and normal LV function, treatment with digoxin modestly increased cardiac output.(181)  
It was previously reported from a small randomized trial in 20 patients with PAH that 
systemic infusion of apelin (10-100 nmol/min) resulted in increased cardiac output and stroke 
volume and in a reduction of PVR.(182) In two other small trials with respectively eight and 
twelve subjects, administration of apelin infusion was also demonstrated to have a positive 
effect on cardiac output, systemic blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance in patients 
with chronic left-sided heart failure.(118,183) Apelin agonism is currently not under 
investigation in patients with HFpEF. 
 
Device therapies 
 33 
 
The REDUCe Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients with Heart Failure (REDUCE LAP-
HF) study was an open-label, single-arm, phase 1 study to assess the performance and safety 
of a transcatheter interatrial shunt device in HFpEF patients >40 years who remain 
symptomatic despite maximum pharmacological therapy. The use of this device was safe and 
reduced left atrial pressures during exercise and thus demonstrated its potential efficacy in 
patients with HFpEF.(184) The REDUCE LAP-HF study excluded patients with more than 
mild RVD as estimated by echocardiography, or TAPSE <14 mm, or RV size ≥ LV size, or 
RV FAC <35%, and with resting central venous pressure >14 mmHg and with evidence of PH 
with PVR >4 Woods units. During six months following the procedure, right atrial pressure 
and dimension, as well as RV end-diastolic volume, increased significantly. Whether the 
observed haemodynamic effects, and the sudden change from pressure to volume overload of 
the right heart, will be beneficial during longer follow-up in patients with HFpEF remains to 
be evaluated. The intraatrial shunt device is currently being studied in a randomized 
controlled, patient-blinded setting, with a non-implant control group (NCT01913613).(185) 
In 2011, the results of the CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to 
Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Patients (CHAMPION) Trial were 
published. Daily monitoring of pulmonary pressures in patients with heart failure using a 
wireless PA pressure monitor – and by acting on elevation of pulmonary pressures with up 
titration of diuretics, RAAS inhibitors or vasodilator drugs – significantly reduced pulmonary 
artery pressures and hospitalisations for heart failure, both in trial setting and in real-world 
patients.(186-189) Wireless monitoring of PA now has a class IIb-B recommendation in the 
2016 European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Management Guidelines in order to 
reduce the risk of recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure.(18) In a sub study from the 
CHAMPION trial in 119 patients with HFpEF, it was also shown that the number of 
hospitalizations for heart failure were reduced in the treatment group with active monitoring 
 34 
 
of pulmonary pressures, compared with controls and this reduction seemed to be primarily 
achieved by adequate titration of loop and thiazide diuretics.(188,190) Wireless monitoring of 
PA pressures may therefore be especially beneficial in patients with RVD and renal 
dysfunction, in whom it is difficult to control volume overload. 
In another small study, pulmonary arterial denervation using a radiofrequency ablation 
catheter was reported to improve pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with PAH,(191,192) 
as well as in one patient with PH in combination with left-sided heart failure.(193) Pulmonary 
arterial denervation is currently being tested in patients with PH associated with left heart 
failure (NCT02220335). 
 
CONCLUSION 
It is now well-established that RVD is highly prevalent and contributes to poor prognosis in 
HFpEF. We summarized available evidence regarding the prevalence, diagnosis, risk factors, 
pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets for the right heart in HFpEF. The present 
recommendation paper also highlighted important remaining knowledge gaps and future 
directions (Table 4). Prospective studies are urgently needed to clarify the mechanisms 
underlying right heart remodelling and dysfunction, and to provide effective treatments that 
improve morbidity and mortality in HFpEF. We therefore advocate greater focus on the often 
neglected right side of the heart, and for the introduction of standardized endpoints of right 
heart dysfunction and failure in future clinical trials in HFpEF.

FIGURE LEGENDS 
 
Figure 1: Pathways leading to right ventricular dysfunction in heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction. 
The predominant mechanism for the development of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) is 
the load-dependent pathway, caused by 1) post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to 
increased left-sided filling pressures and 2) aggravated pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) 
with chronic pulmonary congestion and concomitant factors such as ageing, male sex, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension 
(CTEPH). Chronically increased afterload in PVD-HFpEF will lead to RV hypertrophy, 
dilatation and dysfunction (B). Increased right-sided pressure will also lead to leftward septal 
bowing and this ‘diastolic ventricular interaction’ further impairs left-sided filling. In isolated 
post-capillary PH, left atrial size typically increases before or together with increase in 
pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) while in the setting of additional pre-capillary PH, right 
atrial size may surpass left atrial size. There are also several load-independent factors 
associated with development of RVD. These include 1) mechanistic factors, such as atrial 
fibrillation (AF), right-sided pacing and ‘systolic ventricular interaction’ and 2) intrinsic 
myocardial processes that involve systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction caused 
by non-cardiac comorbidities and for instance right-sided involvement in wild-type 
transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) (A). CAD coronary artery disease; DM-II diabetes 
mellitus type 2; OSAS obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome; PCWP pulmonary capillary wedge 
pressure; PVD pulmonary vascular disease; RV right ventricle; RVP right ventricular

Figure 2: Inhomogeneous septal movement in a patient with mildly increased 
pulmonary pressures. 
Example of 2-D echocardiographic speckle tracking on the apical four-chamber view in a 
patient with mildly increased pulmonary pressures. The endocardial borders of the left 
ventricle were traced (left image) and the left ventricle was divided into three septal 
(yellow/turquoise/green) and three lateral wall segments (red/blue/pink). Tracing of these 
segments during the cardiac cycle illustrate a leftward shift in the peak systolic strain of the 
basal and mid septal segments compared with the lateral wall segments (right image). This 
shift is caused by increased right-sided pressure and resulting leftward interventricular septal 
bowing, septal mechanical delay and asynchronicity. 
 
Figure 3: Example of a patient with combined heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Figure 1A: Short-axis view showing 
both left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, as well as RV dilatation on 
the long-axis four chamber view (Figure 1B). Figure 1C: Both dilatation of the main 
pulmonary artery (PA), with PA diameter almost equivalent to the aorta (Ao), and dilation of 
the left pulmonary artery (LPA) are demonstrated.

amyloidosis. 
 
Figure 5: Pathophysiology of myocardial and pulmonary vascular remodelling in heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction 
Comorbidities induce a systemic proinflammatory state with elevation of plasma cytokines, 
such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Microvascular endothelial 
 48 
 
cells of the coronary vessels produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which reduces the 
bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and this lowers the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase 
(sGC) in the cardiomyocytes. The resulting cascade of lower cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) and protein kinase G (PKG) ultimately results in myocardial 
remodelling and release of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) with deposition of 
collagen in the extracellular space. In theory, both ventricles are equally prone to these 
systemic mechanisms. However, the left ventricle (LV) displays more concentric remodelling, 
myocardial stiffening and diastolic dysfunction due to collagen deposition and fibrosis. On the 
contrary, the right ventricle (RV) exhibits more eccentric remodelling with hypertrophy, 
dilatation and systolic failure, mainly due to concomitant pulmonary vascular disease and 
resulting increased RV afterload. Chronic pulmonary congestion in the setting of increased 
LV filling pressures in HFpEF leads to remodelling changes of the pulmonary vasculature. 
The resulting increase in pulmonary artery pressures and RV overload triggers neurohormonal 
activation and cytokine release, which further activates the cyclic guanosine monophosphate 
pathway in RV cardiomyocytes, leading to myocyte apoptosis and necrosis and ultimately RV 
failure. COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; PCWP pulmonary capillary wedge

Table 4: Knowledge gaps and future directions regarding the right side in HFpEF. 
1. It is recommended to identify HFpEF patients with (additional) pulmonary vascular 
disease. More insight into the development of pulmonary vascular disease in HFpEF and 
adequate patient selection for future clinical trials is needed to develop and test more 
specific therapies that target the pulmonary vasculature in HFpEF. 
2. There are several load-independent pathways for the development of RV dysfunction 
reported in cross-sectional studies, such as coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. 
However, clear cause-effect relations remain uncertain. Especially the hypothesis that the 
right heart is simultaneously affected in HFpEF, even in the early course of the disease 
may suggest an intrinsic myocardial process and warrants further research. 
3. There remains insufficient knowledge regarding right heart performance, and RV-
pulmonary artery coupling and uncoupling, during exercise in HFpEF. More insight into 
these measures is warranted to address the previous research question as to what extent 
RV remodelling in HFpEF occurs more or less simultaneously to left ventricular 
remodelling and independent of pulmonary pressures. 
4. Obesity is highly prevalent in HFpEF and is associated with RV remodelling and 
dysfunction in the general community. More insight into the role of obesity and its effects 
on RV function and RV-pulmonary artery coupling is needed to investigate whether 
weight loss will be beneficial for right heart performance in HFpEF. 
5. Endothelin-1 levels are associated with myocardial hypertrophy and stiffening in HFpEF. 
It has also been described that endothelin-1 levels are higher in HFpEF patients with 
diabetes mellitus than in patients without. It is recommended to investigate any link 
between endothelin, diabetes mellitus and RV hypertrophy and stiffening. Furthermore, 
whether PDE type 5 inhibition may be used as a preventive approach in patients with 
diabetes mellitus-associated HFpEF needs further study. 
 57 
 
6. BNP is elevated in both left and right-sided overload and seems significantly more 
elevated in patients with HFpEF with additional pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension 
compared to HFpEF patients without pulmonary hypertension. There is an unmet need for 
a biomarker-signal profile unique to the right heart in patients with left-sided heart failure. 
7. Many trials conducted in patients with HFpEF have not met with the primary endpoints 
and thus these drugs have no place in the guidelines for the treatment of HFpEF. Some of 
these drugs have shown to be beneficial for the RV, both in experimental models or in the 
setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. For the future, it might be recommended to 
investigate whether some of these drugs may have a positive effect in selected patients 
with HFpEF, when the endpoints of such trials are more focused on right-sided 
parameters.
