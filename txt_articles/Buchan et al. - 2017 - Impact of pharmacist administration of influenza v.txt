espite widespread public funding for influenza vaccina-
tion in Canada, either for high-risk groups or the entire 
population depending on the province or territory, uptake 
remains suboptimal.1 Numerous factors influence an individual’s 
decision to be vaccinated, and although many of these relate to 
health beliefs and risk–benefit perceptions that can be challenging 
to address, ease of access to vaccination may play a role.2–5
Influenza vaccines are primarily administered by nurses and 
phys 
icians in Canada, but several provinces have recently imple-
mented policies permitting administration by pharmacists (Ta-
ble 1).6 Community pharmacists who have been authorized to ad-
minister influenza vaccines could help to overcome issues with 
accessibility given their ubiquitous distribution, extended work-
ing hours, walk-in policies and availability to people without a pri-
mary care provider.7–9
In the United States, all states allow trained pharmacists to 
administer vaccines.10 This has enhanced patient access as per-
ceived by patients,11 elicited support from prospective vaccinees12 
and increased vaccine coverage.13,14 Steyer and colleagues14 com-
pared influenza vaccine coverage in the US from 1995 to 1999 and 
found an absolute increase of 10.7% among adults aged 65 years 
and older in states where pharmacists could give the vaccine (from 
57.7% to 68.4%), as compared with an increase of 3.5% in states 
that did not have such a policy at the time of the study (from 
61.2% to 64.7%). Grabenstein and colleagues13 found a significant 
increase in influenza vaccination among younger adults. Improve-
ments in influenza vaccine coverage consistent with a pharmacist 
vaccinator effect have also been observed in rural populations in 
the US15 and in populations in Japan.16
In Canada, patients have expressed support for pharmacist-
administered vaccination,17 and pharmacists have indicated 
strong interest in expanding their scope of practice.18 A Canadian 
 
pilot study suggested that 80% of influenza vaccine recipients 
prefer getting their vaccine at pharmacy-based clinics.7 However, 
it is unknown whether these findings translate to population-
based increases in vaccine coverage, particularly given changes 
over time in other factors such as removal of financial barriers to 
influenza immunization through public funding. We sought to de-

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Uptake of influenza vacci-
nation in Canada remains suboptimal 
despite widespread public funding. To 
increase access, several provinces have 
implemented policies permitting pharma-
cists to administer influenza vaccines in 
community pharmacies. We examined the 
impact of such policies on the uptake of 
seasonal influenza vaccination in Canada.
METHODS: We pooled data from the 
2007–2014 cycles of the Canadian Com-
munity Health Survey (n = 481 526). To 
determine the impact of influenza vac-
cine administration by pharmacists, we 
estimated the prevalence ratio for the 
association between the presence of a 
pharmacist policy and individual-level 
vaccine uptake using a modified Pois-
son regression model (dependent vari-
able: vaccine uptake) with normalized 
weights while controlling for numerous 
health and sociodemographic factors.
RESULTS: Across all survey cycles com-
bined, 28.8% of respondents reported 
receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine dur-
ing the 12 months before survey participa-
tion. Introduction of a policy for pharma-
cist administration of influenza vaccine 
was associated with a modest increase in 
coverage (2.2%) and an individual’s likeli-
hood of uptake (adjusted prevalence ratio 
1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.08).
INTERPRETATION: Uptake of influenza 
immunization was modestly increased in 
Canadian jurisdictions that allowed phar-
macists to administer influenza vaccines.

termine the impact of regulatory changes allowing pharmacists to 
provide influenza vaccines on the uptake of seasonal in 
fluenza 
immunization in Canada.
Methods
Study population
We used nationally representative data from the 2007–2014 cycles 
of the Canadian Community Health Survey. This cross-sectional 
survey has been conducted by Statistics Canada through tele-
phone and in-person interviews annually since 2007, covering a 
range of questions related to health status, health care utilization 
and determinants of health.19 Using a multistage stratified cluster 
design, the survey includes a sample of about 65 000 respondents 
aged 12 years and older in each cycle. The survey excludes people 
living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements, full-time 
members of the Canadian military, people in institutions and resi-
dents in remote health regions in Quebec (all representing < 3% of 
the population).19 The response rate declined across survey cycles, 
from 77.6% to 65.6%.20 
Our study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Public 
Health Ontario.
Definitions
The dependent variable was self-reported influenza vaccination, 
determined through responses to the questions “Have you ever 
had a (seasonal) flu shot?” and “When did you have your last (sea-
sonal) flu shot?” Individuals who reported receiving their last flu 
shot in the 12 months before the survey were considered immu-
nized. These respondents were also asked, “In which month did 
you have your last flu shot?” Those whose response matched the 
month of the survey date were then asked, “Was that this year or 
last year?” We considered respondents who reported receiving the 
vaccine during the same month as the survey date but in the pre-
ceding year as not immunized.
We constructed our primary independent variable — the abil-
ity for pharmacists to administer publicly funded influenza vac-
cines (“pharmacist policy”) — based on province of residence and 
influenza season (Table 1). The start of the pharmacist policy was 
deemed to coincide with the start of the corresponding influenza 
season, defined as Oct. 1 to the following Sept. 30. Residents of 
Alberta and British Columbia from the 2009/10 influenza season 
onward, New Brunswick from 2010/11 onward, Ontario from 
2012/13 onward and Nova Scotia from 2013/14 onward were clas-
sified as living in a jurisdiction with a pharmacist policy. Although 
Alberta introduced its policy in 2007, few pharmacists received 
certification for the 2007/08 and 2008/09 influenza seasons, and 
pharmacists were not part of the publicly funded program until 
2009/10. The available survey data do not cover subsequent influ-
enza seasons when Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, 
Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan introduced their phar-
macist policies.
We chose the following potential confounders for influenza 
vaccination a priori based on a review of the existing literature: 
age, sex, rural residence (population concentration < 1000 and 
population density < 400 per square kilometer), household 
income, education, marital status, immigration status, racial/
cultural group, self-reported health status, presence of chronic 
conditions (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart 
disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer), body mass index, having a child 
less than 5 years old in the household, smoking status, receipt of 
the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine (only for those sur-
veyed in the 2010 cycle) and having a regular doctor.21–23 We also 
examined the impact of living in a jurisdiction that provides uni-
versal publicly funded influenza vaccination (based on province 
and influenza season) as a separate policy intervention from the 
pharmacist policies.21 To account for underlying temporal and pro-
vincial variations, we included influenza season and province as 
potential confounders.
Statistical analysis
We pooled individual-level responses from all survey cycles, with 
the final data set considered to represent the characteristics of the 
average population over the combined period of the survey 
 
cycles.24 Normalized weights were used to account for an unequal 
probability of selection in the sample. We used the Cochran–
Armitage test to assess temporal trends in influenza vaccination 
by province. We used a weighted modified Poisson regression 
model to estimate the prevalence ratio for the association be-
tween the presence of a pharmacist policy and individual-level in-
fluenza vaccine uptake,25 controlling for socio 
demographic infor-
mation, health status and health behaviours associated with 
influenza vaccination. We chose this approach over logistic regres-
sion analysis because of the frequency of the outcome.26 We chose 
Quebec as the reference jurisdiction because it had the lowest ob-

served levels of influenza vaccination (thus all prevalence ratios 
comparing provinces and territories would be greater than 1) and 
because it was the only province that had not implemented either 
universal funding or a pharmacist policy (thus it was akin to a “no 
exposure” group). We assessed the model for interactions of phar-
macist policy with age, chronic conditions and income. 
We performed a sensitivity analysis in which we set introduc-
tion of the pharmacist policy in Alberta to the 2007/08 and 2008/09 
seasons, as opposed to the 2009/10 season. 
A significance level of p < 0.05 was used for all tests. We used 
SAS statistical software (version 9.3, SAS Institute Incorporated) 
for all analyses.
Results
After we excluded respondents with missing data on influenza vac-
cination (n = 15 764), we had a total weighted sample of 481 526 for 
our analysis (Table 2, and Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj 
.ca 
/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj 
.151027 
/-/DC1). Across all survey 
cycles, 28.8% of respondents reported receiving a seasonal influ-
enza vaccine in the 12 months before survey participation. The 
proportion was slightly higher in provinces with a pharmacist pol-
icy than in those without a policy (30.4% v. 28.2%). The proportion 
of respondents who reported receiving an influenza vaccine de-
creased over the study period nationally (p < 0.001). Decreases 
over time were observed in Quebec and Ontario, whereas in-
creases were observed in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Alberta 
(Table 3). We observed notable season-to-season variability in the 
temporal trends.
Influenza vaccination remained higher in provinces with a 
pharmacist policy than in those without a policy after we adjusted 
for potential confounders (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.05, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.08) (Table 4). We observed no signif-
icant interaction of pharmacist policies with age, chronic condi-
tions or income. Respondents in provinces with universal funding 
for influenza vaccination were more likely than those in provinces 
without a universal funding policy to report receiving seasonal 
influenza vaccines (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.10–
1.17), independent of the presence of a pharmacist policy. 
Influenza vaccination uptake was positively associated with 
increased age (≥ 50 yr), female sex, urban residence, high household 
income, high educational attainment, being married, being of Asian 
descent, having chronic conditions (except for post-stroke effects), 
having a higher body mass index, having a child less than 5 years of 
age in the household, receiving the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influ-
enza and having a regular doctor (Table 4 and Appendix 2, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.151027/-/DC1). 
Uptake was negatively associated with being an immigrant, report-
ing better health status and daily smoking. Influenza vaccination 
varied considerably across seasons and provinces.
In the sensitivity analysis, we found no change in the impact of 
pharmacist policies when we used the 2007/08 or 2008/09 influ-
enza season as the first year of the policy for Alberta.
Interpretation
During the study period, influenza vaccine coverage declined over 
time in Canada, but there was substantial interprovincial variabil-
ity in this trend. Individuals living in provinces with a policy allow-
ing administration of publicly funded influenza vaccines by phar-
macists were more likely to report receipt of a seasonal influenza 
vaccine in the year before survey participation than those living in 
jurisdictions without a pharmacist policy. Based on the available 
data capturing the early implementation period of pharmacy poli-

cies for most provinces, the impact of the policies so 
far has been modest.
Pharmacist policies could conceivably increase 
influenza vaccination through 3 mechanisms related 
to accessibility: improved availability, geographic 
proximity and accommodation.27 Large numbers of 
community pharmacists are available to administer 
vaccines; for example, 51% of eligible pharmacists in 
Ontario (n = 7358) have been authorized and trained 
to do so as of 2014.28 In addition, most Canadians live 
close to a pharmacy, thereby possibly increasing 
physical access to these services. For example, 79% 
of the population in Nova Scotia and 91% of the pop-
ulation in Ontario live within a 5-km driving distance 
of a community pharmacy.29,30 This is particularly 
important in rural areas, where access to medical or 
public health services is often limited.9,31 Community 
pharmacies are also accommodating: people can 
visit during longer hours of operation, often without 
appointments, and generally experience shorter wait 
times.7,9,32,33 A study in the United Kingdom found that 
51% of patients surveyed who were eligible for free 
influenza vaccination through a physician preferred 
instead to pay for the service at a pharmacy because 
of convenience, and 43% chose to pay because of 
ease of access.34
Although the results of our study suggest a small 
impact associated with pharmacist policies, at least 
during the initial years of implementation, there may 
be other potential benefits associated with these pol-
icies. For instance, enhanced advertising of seasonal 
influenza vaccination by pharmacies may increase 
awareness of the important burden of influenza and 
promote other health-promoting behaviours such as 
hand-washing and respiratory etiquette, even if it 
does not necessarily translate to increased influenza 
vaccine uptake. Because 80% of Canadians consult 
with pharmacists,35 those who seek nonvaccination 
services from pharmacists may also receive remind-
ers for annual influenza vaccination. This may be an 
effective strategy to increase uptake in certain high-
risk groups who are less likely to get the vaccine, such 
as smokers. However, to achieve the intended policy 
objective of increased vaccine coverage in the popu-
lation, more promotion of influenza vaccination and 
further facilitation of vaccine delivery (e.g., vaccinat-
ing children at school) may be required in addition to 
pharmacist policies.
Strengths and limitations
Our study is novel in assessing the impact of pharma-
cist policies on influenza vaccination coverage across 
all Canadian jurisdictions over time. The inclusion of 
multiple cycles of the Canadian Community Health 
Survey resulted in a large sample, which allowed us 
to incorporate many important covariates known to

*The multivariable regression model included a sample of 456 881 respondents for whom there was 
complete information on all covariates. In addition to the variables in this table, the model was adjusted 
for the following: location of residence, household income, educational attainment, marital status, 
immigration status, racial/cultural group, self-reported health status, category of body mass index, 
having a child less than 5 yr of age in household, smoking status and receipt of influenza A/H1N1 
pandemic vaccine in 2009 (see Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/

be associated with influenza vaccination. It also allowed us to 
include both pre- and post-policy data from provinces that imple-
mented pharmacist policies.
The major limitation of our study was the unavailability of 
information on the vaccine provider. We were therefore unable to 
determine the extent of provider “displacement” (i.e., individuals 
who previously received the vaccine from a physician or nurse 
and were now getting it at a pharmacy). 
We were also unable to measure the extent to which pharma-
cists implemented the practice of providing influenza vaccines in 
provinces that implemented a pharmacist policy. This may have 
varied by province and duration. The absence of a before–after 
effect in certain provinces may have been due to underlying tem-
poral trends (e.g., a decrease in coverage over time that may have 
been mitigated by introduction of a pharmacist policy) or incom-
plete pene 
trance of the policy (e.g., in Ontario, not all pharmacists 
complete the training to administer vaccines and not all pharma-
cies undergo the approval process that is required to provide influ-
enza vaccines). 
Another limitation is the Canadian Community Health Survey’s 
exclusion of important populations, such as children less than 12 
years of age and people in institutions, both of which are important 
groups for influenza vaccination. However, because Canadian phar-
macists are not authorized to administer influenza vaccines to chil-
dren (< 5 yr of age in some provinces and < 9 yr of age in others) and 
institutions often have established vaccination programs, these 
groups may be less likely to obtain the vaccine from pharmacists. 
We were also limited by the data available from the Canadian 
Community Health Survey. Data from the most recent survey 
period, during which additional provinces implemented a pharma-
cist policy, are not yet available.
Finally, our study relied on self-report of influenza vaccination 
status within the 12 months before survey participation, which 
may be susceptible to reporting biases. However, self-report of 
influenza vaccination has been shown to be valid36–39 and has been 
used previously to estimate vaccine coverage.23,40,41
Conclusion
The presence of a policy allowing pharmacists to administer pub-
licly funded seasonal influenza vaccines was associated with mod-
est increases in vaccine uptake. Future work to characterize the 
populations that access this service will aid evaluation efforts and 
inform decision-making in other jurisdictions that are considering 
expanding the scope of pharmacist practice to include delivery of 
vaccines and other services. Ongoing efforts will be needed to 
evaluate the longer-term impact of pharmacist policies.
