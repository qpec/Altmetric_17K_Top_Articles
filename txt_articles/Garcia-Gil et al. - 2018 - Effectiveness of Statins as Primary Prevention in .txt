The purpose was to analyze statin effectiveness in a general population with differing levels of coronary heart disease
(CHD) risk. Patients (35–74 years) without previous cardiovascular disease were included and stratified according to 10-
year CHD risk (<5%, 5–7.4%, 7.5–9.9%, and 10–19.9%). New users were categorized according to their medical possession
ratio (MPR). The main outcome was atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (myocardial infarction and ischemic
stroke). In adherent patients (MPR 70%), statin treatment decreased ASCVD risk across the range of coronary risk (from
16–30%). The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 470 and 204 in the risk categories <5% and 5–7.4%, respectively,
and 75 and 62 in the 7.5–9.9% category than in the 10–19.9% category, respectively. Statin therapy should remain a prior-
ity in patients at high 10-year CHD risk (10–19.9%). Most patients with intermediate risk could benefit from statin treat-
ment, but the treatment decision should focus on the net benefit, safety, and patient preference, given the higher NNT.
Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THIS
TOPIC?
� The evidence of statin efficiency and safety is well known in
primary and secondary prevention. However, statin effective-
ness, in terms of absolute benefit, and the cardiovascular risk
threshold from which individuals should initiate treatment
remain uncertain.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?
� We examined if statins are effective in terms of net benefit
across different ranges of 10-year coronary risk.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE
� Statins were effective in reducing cardiovascular events across
the range of 10-year coronary risk groups in adherent
individuals. The NNT in the lower risk categories (<5% and
5–7.4%) was higher than in the moderate and high-risk catego-
ries (7.5–9.9% and 10–19�9%).
HOW THIS MIGHT CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMA-
COLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
� Statins should remain a priority at high 10-year coronary
risk (10–19.9%) because of the clear absolute benefit and may
be useful in the intermediate category (7.5–9.9%), although the
decision to initiate treatment should focus on the absolute
benefit, safety, and patient preferences. In addition, a first-line
strategy to improve statins effectiveness in primary care
should be the implementation of interventions to improve
adherence.
New guidelines to manage dyslipidemia recommend individual-
ized prevention measures to reduce the incidence of cardiovascu-
lar events and focus on two benefit groups: first, secondary
prevention patients, diabetics, and patients with one or more car-
diovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking)
or with chronic kidney disease; and second, individuals with
10-year cardiovascular risk estimates.1–4 These guidelines have
lowered the estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk threshold to
reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. In primary preven-
tion, European guidelines recommend treatment in individuals
with 5% or higher risk on the SCORE 10-year fatal cardiovascu-
lar risk chart and in those with low (<5%) risk and low-density

US guidelines recommend treatment for individuals aged 40–75
years with 10-year risk scores 7.5%; each guide, however, with dif-
ferent levels of evidence.1,2 In the United Kingdom, the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests statin treat-
ment in primary prevention for people with 10% risk.3 The defi-
nition of high cardiovascular risk varies across guidelines and
depends on the risk function used, the endpoints considered, the
reference population, and the presence of comorbidities. These
recommendations are based on the results from previous meta-
analyses5,6 and recent clinical trials,7 which show that the efficacy
of statins is similar in high and intermediate cardiovascular risk
populations.
These threshold recommendations are controversial for several
reasons. First, the population eligible for lifetime statin therapy
would increase substantially. Second, the focus is on relative
rather than absolute risk reduction.8–10 Finally, the randomiza-
tion of the clinical trials upon which the guidelines are based did
not take baseline cardiovascular risk into account.
As participants in clinical trials may not represent the general
population because specific groups (statin-intolerant or poorly
adherent, diabetics, women, young people) are often excluded,11
data from electronic medical records can be used to provide
population-based evidence for cardiovascular risk management
decisions and to evaluate treatment effectiveness in real-life clini-
cal conditions.12
The aim of the present study was to analyze the effectiveness
of statins in a general population according to their coronary risk
estimation.
RESULTS
Between July 2006 and December 2007, 617,850 individuals ful-
filled all inclusion criteria and 20,799 (3.3%) initiated statin ther-
apy. Losses to follow-up were 3.1% (n 5 19,557), all of them due
to transfer out of the Information System for the Development
of Research in Primary Care (SIDIAPQ) database. Median
follow-up was 7.7 years (ranging from 7.2, 1st quartile, to 8.0, 3rd
quartile). There were 523,580 participants with 10-year coronary
heart disease (CHD) risk <5% (84.7%), 53,534 with risk
5–7.4% (8.6%), 21,824 with risk 7.5–9.9% (3.5%), and 18,912
with risk 10–19.9% (3.0%). The percentage of individuals with
complete follow-up was: 91.05% (CHD category <5%), 84.41%
(5–7.4%), 80.27% (7.5–9.9%), and 75.37% (10–19.9%).
The study flowchart is detailed in Figure 1. The missing data
for incomplete variables and a comparison of the complete-case
and imputed datasets are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Mean values of these variables were lower after multiple imputa-
tions, as expected.
Baseline characteristics
Women constituted 53.8% of the sample. Mean age was 50.4
(SD 10.5) years. Diabetes was present in 4.9% of participants,
hypertension in 17.38%, smoking in 34.8%, and dyslipidemia in
15.2%. The proportion of adherent new users (6-month medical
possession ratio (MPR) 70%) was 54.9%; median MPR was
76.6% (1st quartile, 46.0; 3rd quartile, 100). Descriptive analysis
of the number of days covered by statins is shown in Table S2.
Main baseline characteristics of patients with high (MPR 70%)
and low (MPR <70%) statin adherence and of nonusers are
shown in Table 1, stratified by CHD risk before propensity score
(PS) adjustment. Main baseline characteristics after PS adjust-
ment are shown in Table 2. No clinically relevant standardized
differences were observed after adjusting for PS. Other baseline
characteristics before and after PS adjustment are shown in
Tables S3, S4, respectively. Over 80% of new users were treated
with a statin of moderate LDL-reduction capacity (Table S4).
Baseline characteristics after PS adjustment are also shown for
the complete dataset in Table S5.
Outcomes and statin effectiveness
For 2006–2014, overall unadjusted incidences per 1,000 person-
years at risk (PYAR) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD), CHD, ischemic (IS), and all-cause mortality were
2.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.93–3.03), 2.60 (95% CI
2.55–2.64), 1.75 (95% CI 1.71–1.79), and 3.44 (95% CI 3.39–
3.49), respectively. Unadjusted incidences and adjusted hazard
ratios (HRs) for all outcomes are shown by CHD risk categories
in Table 3. Statins showed a protective effect in individuals with
MPR 70% for ASCVD across all risk groups, and this effect was
significant in the risk groups defined from 7.5% through 9.9%
and 10–19.9%; however, individuals with MPR <70% in any
CHD risk category showed a lower and nonsignificant effect size
reduction in ASCVD.
Statins protected individuals with MPR 70% from CHD in
the two risk groups defined from 5–9.9% and in the 10–19.9%
risk group; however, individuals with MPR <70% showed no
clinically relevant reduction in CHD in any risk category.
Furthermore, no significant differences in IS were found in any
risk category, regardless of MPR. All-cause mortality reduction
was statistically significant only in individuals with MPR 70%
and 10-19.9% risk (0.73 (0.59–0.91)). Variables not balanced
between statins users and nonusers were further included in the
models but the results did not change (data not shown). Standard
adjusted models showed similar results (Table S6).
Overall, 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was lower at
higher levels of risk, ranging from 470 in the group with lowest
CHD risk to 62 in the highest risk group.
Adverse events
There was no significant increase in cancer and hemorrhagic stroke
attributable to statins, regardless of CHD risk category. However,
diabetes increased in all CHD risk categories, although this was
a nonsignificant trend in the 7.5–9.9% risk group (Table 4). Stan-
dard adjusted models showed similar results (Table S7).
Tables S8 and S9 show statin effectiveness and adverse effects
in the complete dataset. The results of the proportional hazards
assumption was met for all outcomes except for diabetes in the
<5% category (Table S10).

 DISCUSSION
This observational retrospective study aimed at estimating statin
effectiveness according to CHD risk levels in a general popula-
tion without previous cardiovascular disease. We found that
statin treatment was effective in preventing ASCVD across the
range of coronary risk in people with high adherence to therapy
(MPR >70%). Specifically, statin therapy decreased ASCVD risk
by 30% and 26% in individuals with cardiovascular risk of 7.5–

 9.9% and 10–19.9%, respectively. Treatment with statins also
decreased all-cause mortality by 27% in those at highest risk (10–
19.9% category). We found no clinically relevant effect size of
statin treatment in people with low adherence to therapy (MPR
<70%), irrespective of their CHD risk.
Our finding that statins effectively reduced ASCVD in individ-
uals with 10-year CHD risk 10–19.9% who adhered to treatment
is consistent with clinical trials and systematic reviews aimed at
evaluating statin efficacy in primary prevention6,7 and in line
with recent guidelines.1–4 In addition, our estimate of 62 as the
5-year NNT to prevent one ASCVD event in the 10–19.9% risk
category was similar to the results of the Cholesterol Trialists
Collaborators’
meta-analysis
in
primary
prevention,
which
included individuals with 10-year coronary risk of about 15%,
similar to the individuals in our 10–19.9% category.6 Hence,
statin therapy may be useful in this CHD risk category.
We found that statin treatment effectively reduced relative risk
in the 7.5–9.9% category, similar to that of the cited meta-
analysis with a pooled population comparable to ours in this 10-
year risk category.5 Although our 5-year NNT estimate in this
risk category was about 20% higher compared to the 10–19.9%
category (75 vs. 62), most individuals with an estimated CHD
risk 7.5–9.9% could benefit from statin treatment, in line with
US guidelines.1,2 Additional research is needed to define strate-
gies that improve the predictive ability of risk functions by con-
sidering new risk factors13 and/or by individualized consideration
of LDL cholesterol levels or response to treatment.14,15
Patient management strategies must take into account the net
benefit of absolute risk reduction,10,14 long-term treatment safety,
costs, and patient preference9,16 in the 10–19.9% and 7.5–9.9%
categories.
The relative benefit for protection against ASCVD in the 5–
7.4% risk category in individuals with MPR 70% was mainly due
to the protective effect for CHD. This finding is in accordance
with the results of a recent pragmatic clinical trial in an
intermediate-risk population, defined as a 10-year cardiovascular
risk of about 10% but 10-year CHD risk of about 5%.7 However,
the net benefit of statin treatment in the <5% and 5–7.4% cate-
gories could be limited because of the large 5-year NNT to pre-
vent one event (470 and 204, respectively).
In our study, the magnitude of the statin effectiveness in
preventing IS was similar to that of clinical trials and meta-
analyses.6,17 It is likely that the few IS events contributed to the
lack of statistical significance in our results. However, the lack of
significant association between statin treatment and IS was in
line with previous observational data.18
There is also great debate about the effectiveness of statins on
all-cause mortality,6,7,19,20 despite agreement that the relative risk
reduction is moderate (�10%). Our findings were consistent
with this effect size in all risk categories except for the association
between statins and all-cause mortality in individuals with MPR
70% and 10–19.9% risk. The effect was greater than expected.
We cannot dismiss the possibility of residual healthy-user effect,
although this was not observed in other risk categories.
About 46% of new users had a 6-month MPR <70%. Impor-
tantly, patients with poor adherence are more likely to have a
higher incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and
all-cause mortality than adherent patients.21 Hence, a first-line
strategy to improve statin effectiveness in primary care should be
the implementation of interventions to improve adherence.
Adverse effects
Statin treatment in users with MPR 70% increased the risk of
diabetes from 15% to 32% depending on risk category, consistent
with results from clinical trials.22 This excess risk should be con-
sidered in recommendations for lifetime statin therapy. We
observed no increased risk of cancer or hemorrhagic stroke
among new users of statins, which is also consistent with the
literature.23,24

 Strengths and limitations
A major strength of this study is that it was based on high-
quality, internally validated electronic medical records that pro-
vided a large sample size, ensured high external validity,12 and
reflected real-life clinical conditions by including individuals
often excluded from clinical trials (e.g., women, diabetics, people
with inflammatory immune disorders).
Ten-year coronary risk was stratified by an equation validated
in Spain.25 The concordance between the estimated and observed
10-year coronary risk in our study reinforces the quality of this
risk equation.
We acknowledge several limitations. First, residual confound-
ing is a possibility, especially indication bias26; we excluded frail
individuals and used a new users design to minimize confounding
factors and then adjusted for PS in each coronary risk stratum.
The exclusion of frail individuals may also lead to an unrepresen-
tative sample; however, the population of greatest interest con-
sists of individuals more likely to receive statins in primary
prevention and frail individuals are less likely to initiate statin
treatment. The inclusion of prevalent users may also lead to a
sample whose covariates at baseline, especially lipid profile, could
be affected by previous statin use.
Second, missing data can influence results. To avoid this
type of selection bias, where the population with missing data
somehow differs from those with complete data, we imputed
the missing values for continuous variables instead of exclud-
ing those records. Overall, the population with complete data
was more likely to be older, female, hypertensive, and diabetic
(Supplementary file, Table S4). The percentage of missing
data ranged from 28–79%. The appropriateness of performing
multiple imputations depends not only on the percentage and
mechanism of missing values but on the number of complete
observations used in the imputation process. In our study,
77,894 complete cases were available to impute variables with
missing values, increasing the likelihood of representing the
general population.
Third, we could not analyze the effect of statins on cardiovas-
cular death, as cause-of-death is not available in the SIDIAPQ
database. Fourth, we cannot exclude some underreporting of out-
comes, which could lead to nondifferential misclassification and
reduce statistical power, biasing results towards the null hypothe-
sis. There were too few cases to accurately estimate the effect of
statins use on acute liver disease and myopathy incidence or on
relative and absolute risk reduction.
In addition, follow-up was shorter than the 10-year CHD
risk; that may result in a misclassification of individuals in each
CHD risk category in the long term. We also estimated 10-year
CHD incidence based on the observed data using a Weibull
model, which showed that the 10-year mean incidence of CHD
in each risk category matched the Framingham score estimates

 (Table S11). Low data quality could also generate misclassifica-
tion. In this study the presence of cardiovascular risk factors
and outcomes were previously validated in SIDIAP.27 Moreover,
the validity of statins exposure in the medical records was con-
firmed by the official invoicing records from community
pharmacies.
Lastly, we could not analyze statin effectiveness in subgroups
based on statin dose or sex because of the few events in the high-
dose category and among women in the highest coronary risk
categories.
In conclusion, statin treatment in adherent patients was associ-
ated with a reduction in ASCVD risk ranging from 16–30%.

CHD risk category (5-year NNT: 62). Statins were less effective
in preventing IS, compared to CHD. All-cause mortality was sig-

 ARTICLE
 Our results indicate that interventions in primary care
should
focus
on
improving
adherence
to
statin
therapy.
Statin
treatment
should
remain
a
priority
in
managing
patients at high 10-year CHD risk (10–19.9%). In the same
way, most patients in the 7.5–9.9% category could benefit
from statin treatment, although the increased risk of diabetes,
costs, and patient preference must be taken into account. In
the 5–7.4% range, the higher 5-year NNT (204) raises the
question of whether it is reasonable to recommend treatment
in these patients.
METHODS
Study design
This was a historical population-based cohort study.
Record linkage system
The Information System for the Development of Research in Primary
Care (SIDIAP) is a clinical database of anonymized longitudinal patient
records for nearly six million people (80% of the Catalan population and
10.2% of the total population of Spain) registered in 274 primary care
practices having a total of 3,414 general practitioners (GPs). A subset of
records from GPs who surpass a predefined data quality standard consti-
tutes the SIDIAPQ, which provides research-quality anonymized clinical
data covering 14 million person-years (2005–2014). SIDIAPQ is highly
representative of both urban and rural areas of Catalonia.28
The quality of SIDIAPQ data has been previously documented, and
the database has been used to study the epidemiology of a number of
health outcomes.13,27,29 Ethics approval was obtained from our local
Ethics Committee.
Study population
All individuals aged 35 to 74 years were included in SIDIAPQ.
Inclusion criteria
Only new users (defined as receiving simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin,
fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, or atorvastatin for the first time) were selected.
For this group, the index date was defined as the first statin invoice;
those same dates were then randomly assigned to nonusers to achieve a
similar distribution. Individuals with at least one visit to their healthcare
provider within 18 months before the index date were included.
Exclusion criteria
Frail individuals with cancer, dementia, paralysis, organ transplant, on
dialysis, or institutionalized at baseline were excluded, as were patients
with previous history of peripheral arterial disease, CHD, IS or hemor-
rhagic stroke, revascularization, heart failure or cardiac therapy (ATC
code C01), or cholesterol-lowering drugs other than statins taken
between July 2006 and December 2007. Individuals with <2 invoices in
pharmacological records for statins during the enrollment period were
also excluded. Finally, we excluded individuals with estimated CHD risk
20% (n 5 1,561) because statins are clearly cost-effective in this risk cate-
gory in terms of absolute risk reduction and safety.1–4
Statin exposure
Statin exposure was calculated according to the medical possession ratio
(MPR), defined as the number of days of statin supplied according to
pharmaceutical records during 6 consecutive months, divided by 183
days. Statin users were categorized as low (MPR <70%) or high (MPR
70%) adherence to therapy.
Outcomes
Cardiovascular diseases during follow-up were identified from SIDIAPQ
codes in both primary care (ICD-10) and hospital discharge records
(ICD-9). Outcomes were CHD (a composite of acute myocardial infarc-
tion (fatal and nonfatal AMI) and angina), fatal and nonfatal ischemic
stroke (IS), and all-cause mortality. The primary outcome of the study
was ASCVD a composite of AMI and IS. Entry of cardiovascular codes
in SIDIAPQ has been previously validated.27
Adverse effects
Liver toxicity and myopathy were attributed to statins if these effects
occurred within 12 months of initiating treatment. New-onset diabetes,
cancer, and hemorrhagic stroke were attributed to statin exposure if the
diagnosis occurred at least 1 year after the prescription date.30
Study entry and follow-up
Patients were enrolled from July 2006 to December 2007 and censored
at the date of transfer from SIDIAPQ or end of study, December 31,
2014. Baseline period was defined as 1 year previous to the index date.
Baseline covariates
The following covariates at baseline were considered: 10-year coronary
risk was calculated using the 10-year CHD risk Framingham function
adapted and validated in the Spanish population.25 Local guidelines31
recommend the use of this function, which allows the estimation of
CHD risk in people without previous CVD up to the age of 74 years
and includes fatal and nonfatal coronary events. Individuals were catego-
rized to assess benefit in the low-intermediate and high-intermediate cor-
onary risk populations, as follows: <5%, 5–7.4%, 7.5–9.9%. and 10–
19.9%.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as percentages for categorical variables and as mean
(SD), or median (quartiles) otherwise. Under the missing-at-random
assumption, we used multiple imputations by chained equations32 to
replace missing baseline values for total cholesterol, high-density

 lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, BMI (weight and height), and deprivation index score. The 10-
year coronary risk was calculated and individuals were then classified
into the study’s four coronary risk categories. The process of multiple
imputation and the variables considered in the models are detailed in the
Supplementary file. Because of nonrandom treatment allocation, a mul-
tinomial model based on potential confounding covariates (Table 5)
was used to calculate a PS for statin therapy (PS model development and
assessment are shown in the Supplementary file). Baseline characteris-
tics of the groups before and after adjusting for PS were compared using
standardized differences. Variables with standardized differences <0.10
were considered well-balanced.
Ten PS and 10 hazard ratio (HR) values were calculated for each cor-
onary risk group in each imputed dataset. A pooled HR was then calcu-
lated according to Rubin’s rules32 with PS as covariate. Variables not
balanced between statins users and nonusers were further included in the
models. In a sensitivity analysis, we compared complete-case results with
those of multiple imputation and standard adjusted models were also
performed (Supplementary file).
Proportionality of hazards assumption was tested by calculating the
median of the chi-square tests of the models fitted for the 10 imputed
datasets (Supplementary file). Five-year NNT for one additional patient
to survive to a specific timepoint was also calculated. Statistical analysis
used R software.33
Ethics approval
Ethics approval was obtained from our local Ethics Committee (IDIAP
Jordi Gol) and all procedures were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki
Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
