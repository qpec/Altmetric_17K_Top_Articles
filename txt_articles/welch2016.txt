BACKGROUND
The goal of screening mammography is to detect small malignant tumors before they 
grow large enough to cause symptoms. Effective screening should therefore lead to 
the detection of a greater number of small tumors, followed by fewer large tumors 
over time.
METHODS
We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, 
1975 through 2012, to calculate the tumor-size distribution and size-specific inci-
dence of breast cancer among women 40 years of age or older. We then calculated the 
size-specific cancer case fatality rate for two time periods: a baseline period before 
the implementation of widespread screening mammography (1975 through 1979) and 
a period encompassing the most recent years for which 10 years of follow-up data 
were available (2000 through 2002).
RESULTS
After the advent of screening mammography, the proportion of detected breast tu-
mors that were small (invasive tumors measuring <2 cm or in situ carcinomas) in-
creased from 36% to 68%; the proportion of detected tumors that were large (invasive 
tumors measuring ≥2 cm) decreased from 64% to 32%. However, this trend was less 
the result of a substantial decrease in the incidence of large tumors (with 30 fewer 
cases of cancer observed per 100,000 women in the period after the advent of screen-
ing than in the period before screening) and more the result of a substantial increase 
in the detection of small tumors (with 162 more cases of cancer observed per 100,000 
women). Assuming that the underlying disease burden was stable, only 30 of the 162 
additional small tumors per 100,000 women that were diagnosed were expected to 
progress to become large, which implied that the remaining 132 cases of cancer per 
100,000 women were overdiagnosed (i.e., cases of cancer were detected on screening 
that never would have led to clinical symptoms). The potential of screening to lower 
breast cancer mortality is reflected in the declining incidence of larger tumors. How-
ever, with respect to only these large tumors, the decline in the size-specific case 
fatality rate suggests that improved treatment was responsible for at least two thirds 
of the reduction in breast cancer mortality.
CONCLUSIONS
Although the rate of detection of large tumors fell after the introduction of screening 
mammography, the more favorable size distribution was primarily the result of the 
additional detection of small tumors. Women were more likely to have breast cancer 
that was overdiagnosed than to have earlier detection of a tumor that was destined to 
become large. The reduction in breast cancer mortality after the implementation of 
screening mammography was predominantly the result of improved systemic therapy.

Breast-Tumor Size, Overdiagnosis, and Screening
A 
lthough it may be possible to show 
the efficacy of screening mammography 
in reducing cancer-specific mortality in 
the relatively controlled setting of randomized 
trials, those trials may not accurately reflect 
the actual effectiveness of screening when it is 
used in clinical practice. Differences between 
efficacy and effectiveness with respect to the 
benefit of screening may be particularly stark 
when the treatments administered in practice 
have markedly changed from those adminis-
tered in the trials that led to the implementa-
tion of widespread screening. Furthermore, al-
though trial data may provide an assessment of 
some negative consequences of screening, such 
as false positive results and associated diag-
nostic procedures, such assessments may under-
state what actually occurs when screening is 
implemented in the general community. The 
collection of data regarding other harms, such 
as overdiagnosis (i.e., tumors detected on screen-
ing that never would have led to clinical symp-
toms), requires additional long-term follow-up 
of trial participants, and those data are often 
either not available or they reflect patient fol-
low-up and testing practices from decades 
earlier.
One response to these challenges in the as-
sessment of the population effects of screening 
mammography has been microsimulation mod-
eling. The output of statistical models has the 
appeal of quantitative precision, but the precision 
may be more apparent than real.1 Modeling is 
only as good as its data inputs and underlying 
assumptions, particularly those regarding the 
(unobserved) natural history of tumors detected 
with the use of screening mammography. Not 
surprisingly, different models elicit a wide range 
of results; in the models used by the Cancer In-
tervention and Surveillance Modeling Network, 
for example, the estimates of the contribution of 
screening to the observed reduction in breast-
cancer mortality ranged from as little as 28% to 
as much as 65%.2. Furthermore, the complexity 
of modeling limits the ability of peer reviewers 
and journal readers to assess the validity of the 
approach.
To assess the potential mortality benefit and 
the potential harm of overdiagnosis associated 
with breast-cancer screening, we used a trans-
parent approach in which the objective was to 
approximate the magnitude of these effects 
rather than to attempt precise estimation. We 
used population data on tumor size, a variable 
that has been collected for decades and is a direct 
proximate indicator of screening effect.
Although the biologic characteristics of a tumor 
are now recognized to be more relevant to breast-
cancer prognosis than the size of the tumor, 
tumor size is more relevant to the assessment of 
the proximate effect of screening. Screening 
mammography is not an assessment of func-
tional gene expression; rather, it is an anatomy-
based search for small structural abnormalities 
that are too small to be felt. Thus, the ultimate 
goal of reduced cancer-specific mortality must 
be mediated through tumor size at diagnosis. In 
this analysis, we used trends in malignant breast-
tumor size to approximate the contribution of 
screening mammography to the reduction in 
breast-cancer mortality and to estimate the mag-
nitude of overdiagnosis.
Methods
Overview
To assess the effectiveness of screening mam-
mography, we examined trends in breast-tumor 
size at diagnosis. We started with the assump-
tion that the underlying probability that clinically 
meaningful breast cancer would develop was 
stable, an assumption we believe was warranted 
given the stable incidence of metastatic breast 
cancer for more than three decades, despite 
spanning the era of increasing prevalence of 
screening-mediated breast cancer and changing 
patterns of hormone therapy (Fig. 1).
All the analyses were performed in the same 
study population: women 40 years of age or 
older at nine long-standing sites of the Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
program, which represents approximately 10% 
of the population of the United States.4 The 
SEER program is the population-based registry 
for incident cancers in the United States. It is 
broadly representative of the nation as a whole; 
SEER-based estimates of breast-cancer mortality 
are virtually identical to those ascertained from 
U.S. mortality data,5 and the SEER program has 
had virtually complete case ascertainment and 
reporting for decades.6 The study period, 1975 
through 2012, spans the time periods before and 
after the widespread dissemination of screen-
ing mammography. All population rates are 
age-adjusted to the standard population of the 
United States in 2000.

Measures
 
Tumor-Size Distribution and Size-Specific Incidence
We classified the recorded size of invasive breast 
tumors in five categories (details regarding 
these categories are provided in Section 1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org). In situ carcino-
mas were included as a separate category. The 
denominator for the determination of tumor-
size distribution was the number of women with 
a diagnosis of breast cancer; the denominator 
for the determination of size-specific incidence 
was the number of women in the study popula-
tion. In both cases, the numerator was the num-
ber of women with breast cancer within each 
size category.
Missing data with respect to tumor size de-
creased with time; missing data were common 
in the early years (33% of tumors were of un-
known size in the period from 1975 through 
1979), then became less common (5% of tumors 
were of unknown size in the period from 2008 
through 2012). If we had directly calculated size-
specific incidence by excluding tumors of un-
known size, this decreasing frequency of missing 
data on size would have produced a spuriously 
low baseline incidence followed by a spuriously 
large increase, which would have led us to over-
estimate overdiagnosis and underestimate the 
contribution of screening to lowering mortality. 
To avoid this bias, we used inverse-probability 
weighting to calculate the tumor-size distribu-
tion. The data for each woman with a known 
tumor size were weighted by the reciprocal of 
the probability that similar women — those 
with identical values of observed characteristics 
— had tumors that were of a known size (details 
of this analysis are provided in Section 2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Size-specific incidence 
was then calculated by multiplying the propor-
tion of tumors in the specific size category by 
the overall incidence of invasive breast cancer.
 
Ten-Year Risk of Death from Breast Cancer
We calculated the 10-year risk of death from 
breast cancer (case fatality rate) for two time 
periods: a baseline period before the advent 
of widespread screening mammography (1975 
through 1979) and a period encompassing the 
most recent years for which 10 years of follow-
up data were available (2000 through 2002). The 
denominator for the determination of case fatal-
ity rate was the number of women who received 
a diagnosis of breast cancer at the beginning of 
a 10-year period, and the numerator was the 
number of deaths from breast cancer within 10 
years after diagnosis.
 
Approximations
 
Magnitude of Overdiagnosis
An increased incidence of small tumors is an 
early indicator of screening effect that could be 
the result of either effective screening or overdi-
agnosis. Assuming a stable underlying incidence 
of disease burden and no overdiagnosis of tu-
mors, the additional detection of small tumors 
should be accompanied by a corresponding de-
crease in large tumors over time. In other words, 
the potential benefit of screening is to identify 
women in whom larger tumors are destined to 
develop and to make the diagnosis of the cancer 
earlier, when their tumors are still small. A de-
crease in the incidence of larger tumors suggests 
that earlier detection is occurring — a neces-
sary, but not sufficient, condition for screening 
to result in lower mortality (with the second 
condition being that earlier treatment of these

rare before 1980 (as evidenced by the rarity of ductal carcinoma in situ — 
an abnormality that is nearly always detected by mammography rather than 
by breast self-examination, physical examination, or the development of 
symptoms), yet its use had disseminated to over half of women 40 years of 
age or older by 1990 (as determined by responses to a National Health Inter-
view Survey question in which women were asked if they had had a mammo-
gram in either 1988 or 19893).

tumors must be more effective than treatment 
after clinical presentation). The extent to which 
diagnosis of additional smaller tumors exceeds 
the decrease in the incidence of larger tumors 
approximates the magnitude of overdiagnosis in 
the population.
Relative Contribution of Improved Cancer Treatment 
versus Screening
Analyses of the relative contribution of improved 
treatment of breast cancer versus screening to 
lowering breast-cancer mortality were limited 
to the larger tumors (invasive tumors measuring 
≥2 cm). This restriction was established for two 
reasons: the potential benefit of screening in 
lowering mortality should be mediated largely 
through the reduction in the incidence of the 
larger tumors, and the case fatality rate is a 
relatively unbiased estimate of the treatment ef-
fect in larger tumors because those tumors are 
detected predominantly clinically, which mini-
mizes biases associated with lead time, length, 
and overdiagnosis. Lead-time bias refers to the 
overestimation of the duration of survival among 
women with screening-detected tumors (relative 
to tumors detected by signs and symptoms) when 
survival is measured from diagnosis. Length 
bias refers to the overestimation of the duration of 
survival among women with screening-detected 
tumors, with the overestimation caused by the 
relative excess of cases that progress slowly; 
these cases are disproportionately identified by 
screening because the probability of detection is 
directly proportional to the length of time dur-
ing which they are detectable. Overdiagnosis bias 
refers to the overestimation of the duration of 
survival among women with screening-detected 
tumors, with the overestimation caused by the 
inclusion of “pseudodisease” — subclinical dis-
ease that would not become overt before the 
patient dies of other causes. (Further details re-
garding these biases can be found at http://ecp

The contribution of improved treatment to 
lowering breast-cancer mortality in the absence 
of screening was approximated by holding size-
specific incidence constant at prescreening levels 
and applying the reduction in size-specific case 
fatality rate over time periods of increasingly 
effective systemic therapy. The contribution of 
screening was approximated by applying the re-
duction of size-specific incidence to a constant 
size-specific case fatality rate. To explore the ef-
fect of screening both before and after improve-
ment in therapy, we performed the latter calcula-
tion twice, according to the case fatality rate 
associated with older therapy (1975 through 
1979) and the rate associated with more recent 
therapy (2000 through 2002).
Results
Tumor-Size Distribution and Size-Specific 
Incidence
The shift in the size distribution of breast tu-
mors associated with the widespread use of 
screening mammography is shown in Figure 2A. 
Although large tumors predominated in the 
period before the advent of screening, small 
tumors predominated after its implementation. 
From 1975 to 2012, the proportion of breast tu-
mors that were small (invasive tumors measur-
ing <2 cm or in situ carcinomas) increased from 
36% to 68%, and the proportion of large tumors 
(invasive tumors measuring ≥2 cm) decreased 
from 64% to 32%.
However, this shift in size distribution was 
less the result of a substantial decrease in the 
incidence of large tumors and more the result of 
substantial increases in the detection of small 
tumors(Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, modest decreases 
were seen in the incidence of large tumors. The 
changes in size-specific incidence of breast can-
cer after the introduction of screening mam-
mography are shown in Table 1. The incidence 
of large tumors decreased by 30 cases of cancer 
per 100,000 women (from 145 to 115 cases of 
cancer per 100,000 women), and the incidence 
of small tumors increased by 162 cases of cancer 
per 100,000 women (from 82 to 244 cases of 
cancer per 100,000 women). Assuming that the 
underlying burden of clinically meaningful breast 
cancer was unchanged, these data suggest that 
30 cases of cancer per 100,000 women were 
destined to become large but were detected ear-
lier, and the remaining 132 cases of cancer per 
100,000 women were overdiagnosed (i.e., 30 sub-
tracted from 162).

follow-up data were available are shown in Fig-
ure 3. For large tumors, the declining case fatal-
ity rate predominantly reflected improved treat-
ment. For small tumors, however, the declining 
case fatality rate was biased by the combined 
effect of lead time, length, and overdiagnosis. In 
fact, during the period from 2000 through 2002, 
women with in situ carcinomas or those with 
invasive tumors measuring less than 1 cm had 
10-year relative survival rates that exceeded 100% 
— meaning that they were more likely than age-
matched women in the general population to 
survive. Relative survival refers to the ratio of the 
proportion of survivors in a cohort of patients 
with cancer to the proportion of survivors in a 
comparable set of persons free from cancer. 
Details of this analysis are provided in Section 3 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
The approximate effect of improved treatment 
of breast cancer on mortality had screening 
mammography not occurred is shown in Table 2. 
The estimated reduction in mortality owing to 
treatment alone was approximately 17 deaths 
per 100,000 women.
 
Effects of Screening Mammography 
on Mortality
The effect of screening mammography on mor-
tality given previously available therapies and 
more recent available therapies is also shown in 
Table 2. In this analysis, the reduction in the 
incidence of large tumors was attributed to 
screening, and this reduction was assumed to 
translate directly to a reduction in mortality. 
During the period of previously available ther-
apy, the reduction in mortality as a result of 
screening mammography was approximately 12 
deaths per 100,000 women. As treatment im-
proved, the benefit of early detection of tumors 
necessarily diminished: the reduction in mortal-
ity as a result of screening during the period of 
more recent therapy was approximately 8 deaths 
per 100,000 women. Thus, improved treatment 
was responsible for at least two thirds (i.e., 17 
divided by the sum of 17 and 8) of the reduction 
in breast cancer mortality.
 
Discussion
Decisions about cancer prognosis and therapy 
have historically been guided by anatomy — the 
size of the tumor and the extent of disease. 
However, it has become increasingly clear that 
the biologic characteristics of the tumor are 
more relevant to breast-cancer prognosis than 
the size of the tumor.7 Tumor size is, at best, a 
very crude manifestation of underlying biologic 
characteristics. A recent prospective trial involv-
ing women with breast cancer showed that the 
prognoses of those whose tumors had favorable 
molecular features were similar regardless of 
whether their tumors measured greater than or 
less than 2 cm.8 Although few clinicians would 
question that nodal status is a far better indica-

Breast-Tumor Size, Overdiagnosis, and Screening
tor of metastatic potential and biologic aggres-
siveness than tumor size, some even question 
whether advances in tumor biology will supplant 
the need to determine lymph-node status.9 How-
ever, while clinicians have moved on to focus on 
tumor biology, breast-cancer screening has re-
mained rooted in anatomy.
The immediate focus of screening continues 
to be the detection of small lesions; in fact, the 
detection rate of so-called “minimal tumors” 
(i.e., invasive tumors measuring <1 cm or in situ 
carcinomas) is used as an indicator of the qual-
ity of mammography.10 However, the detection 
of additional small tumors is helpful only when 
it is accompanied by a reduction in the presenta-
tion of larger tumors. A reduction in the number 
of large tumors may, in turn, reduce the inci-
dence of late-stage disease. Because tumor stage 
is a more important predictor of mortality than 
tumor size, trends in stage-specific incidence 
have been used in previous research that evalu-
ated the effectiveness of screening.11-13 A reason-
able concern was identified, however, that the 
disease stage (e.g., node-positive disease) may be 
subject to “upstaging” over time as technology 
and practice change (e.g., sentinel-node biopsy).14 
To avoid the potentially confounding effect of 
disease-stage migration, we focused on tumor 
size, which has the advantage of being a metric 
that remains constant over time.
Our analysis of size-specific incidence high-
lights the fact that the introduction of screening 
mammography has produced a mixture of ef-
fects. A modest decrease in the incidence of 
large tumors (≥2 cm) was observed, which sug-
gests that screening has had the desired effect of 
advancing the time of diagnosis of some tumors 
that were destined to become large. At the same 
time, a much larger increase in the incidence of 
small tumors (<2 cm) was observed, which sug-
gests that screening has had the undesired effect 
of detecting tumors that otherwise would not 
have become clinically apparent. The magnitude 
of the imbalance indicates that women were 
considerably more likely to have tumors that 
were overdiagnosed than to have earlier detec-
tion of a tumor that was destined to become 
large.
Screening can result in the harm of overdiag-
nosis yet simultaneously result in the benefit of 
lower breast-cancer mortality. To focus on the 
effect of screening that would most likely reflect 
its benefit — a decline in the incidence of large 
tumors — we approximated the relative contri-

Tumor-size data were missing for a third of cases during the period from 1975 through 1979 and 5% of cases during 
the period from 2008 through 2012. Inverse-probability weighting was used to address missing data on tumor size. The 
data for each woman with a known tumor size were weighted by the reciprocal of the probability that similar women — 
those with identical values of observed characteristics — had tumors that were of a known size (details of this analysis 
are provided in Section 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The period from 1975 through 1979 was the baseline time 
period, which refers to the period before the advent of widespread screening.

bution of screening versus improved treatment 
to declining breast-cancer mortality. Because the 
rate of deaths averted as a result of a declining 
size-specific case fatality rate was larger than the 
rate of those averted as a result of the reduced 
incidence of large tumors, we conclude, as others 
have,15-19 that improved treatment must explain a 
majority of the reduction in mortality.
We should emphasize that our approximation 
of the contribution of screening mammography 
to the reduction in breast-cancer mortality is 
likely to be a highly favorable estimate. The 
screening-mediated reduction in the incidence of 
large tumors is unlikely to translate perfectly to 
a reduction in mortality. Screening can advance 
the time of diagnosis of a tumor, thereby detect-
ing the tumor when it is still small, without 
changing its prognosis, a phenomenon termed 
“biologic predeterminism.” In particular, screen-
ing is known to selectively identify tumors that 
have favorable molecular features.20 Because tu-
mors with favorable molecular features grow 
more slowly, they are disproportionately avail-
able to be detected by screening (so-called length-
biased sampling). Thus, the expectation is that 
some tumors that are detected by screening 
when they are small would have favorable bio-
logic characteristics and could have been treated 
equally effectively at clinical presentation.8 For 
this subset of tumors, earlier detection at a 
smaller size would not translate into a mortality 
reduction.
Furthermore, there are other reasons to be-
lieve that we have overstated the effect of screen-
ing relative to improved breast-cancer treatment. 
We attributed the observed shift in tumor-size 
Figure 3. Change in Size-Specific Case Fatality Rate.
Data are shown for the size-specific 10-year risk of death from breast cancer (case fatality rate) among women 40 years 
of age or older with breast cancer that was treated before the introduction of screening mammography (diagnosis 
during the period from 1975 through 1979) and during the most recent years for which 10 years of follow-up were 
available (diagnosis during the period from 2000 through 2002). The relative risk is for the risk in 2000 through 2002 
versus 1975 through 1979. In the period from 2000 through 2002, women with tumors less than 1 cm in size were 
more than 4 times as likely to die from causes other than breast cancer than from breast cancer. In that same period, 
women with in situ carcinoma were more than 10 times as likely to die from causes other than breast cancer than 
from breast cancer. Details of this analysis are provided in Section 3 in the Supplementary Appendix.

Breast-Tumor Size, Overdiagnosis, and Screening
distribution solely to screening mammography 
and did not take into consideration the possibil-
ity that women may have sought care earlier in 
the course of their disease. Indeed, evidence 
suggests that increased breast-cancer awareness 
in the general population has led women to 
present earlier with clinically evident disease 
than they did in the past.21 Finally, our analysis 
does not credit treatment for any improved prog-
nosis in women with invasive tumors smaller 
than 2 cm. Although women with these small 
tumors have a generally favorable prognosis, 15 
to 20% have node-positive disease, the category 
in which improved systemic therapy has exerted 
the greatest effect in declining breast-cancer 
mortality.22

This analysis was limited to large tumors (measuring ≥2 cm), where earlier detection could exert its beneficial effect. 
Incidence of breast cancer and mortality reduction are expressed as diagnoses of breast cancer and deaths from breast 
cancer, respectively, per 100,000 women in the population of women 40 years of age or older. The baseline time period 
refers to the period before the advent of widespread screening (1975 through 1979). The recent time period for this 
analysis refers to the period encompassing the most recent years for which 10 years of follow-up data were available 
(2000 through 2002).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Our findings are limited because a funda-
mental variable, the underlying true incidence of 
breast cancer (i.e., the true burden of disease), is 
unobservable. Observed breast-cancer incidence 
is influenced by observational intensity,23 which 
represents the combined effect of the frequency 
of screening, the resolution of the screening 
examination, and the threshold that is used to 
label the examination as abnormal. We assumed 
that the underlying incidence of breast cancer 
was unchanged and that the observed increase 
reflected the increased observational intensity as-
sociated with screening (information regarding a 
sensitivity analysis with alternative assumptions 
is provided in Section 4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Proponents of screening mammog-
raphy have contended that the increase instead 
reflects genuine disease and that overdiagnosis 
has been greatly exaggerated.24 Those who postu-
late such substantial increases in underlying in-
cidence, however, must explain why the increase 
coincides temporally with the introduction of 
screening, why the incidence of the most aggres-
sive form of the disease — metastatic breast 
cancer — remains essentially unchanged,25 and 
why overdiagnosis is also evident in analyses 
that are based on a single point in time.26
There is no perfectly precise method to as-
sess the population effects of cancer screen-
ing. Screening mammography performed in an 
asymptomatic population that has an average 
risk of cancer can, at best, have only a small 
absolute effect on cancer-specific mortality be-
cause the vast majority of women are not des-
tined to die from the target cancer. Because the 
mortality effect is necessarily delayed in time, the 
availability of improving cancer treatment over 
time further complicates the assessment of the 
contribution of screening. Inferences regarding 
overdiagnosis are equally imprecise since over-
diagnosis cannot be measured directly. Studies 
in which minimal overdiagnosis is reported are 
typically conducted under the assumption that 
all abnormalities that are given the pathologic 
diagnosis of cancer will, in fact, progress.27,28 
Modeling all cancers as having lead time (i.e., as 
invariably progressing) ignores an important pos-
sibility, namely that some cancers are quiescent 
— or, in fact, regress.29 To avoid these problems, 
a recent review concluded that high-quality eco-
logic and cohort studies represent the best de-
signs for investigating overdiagnosis.30
We do not pretend to present a precise esti-
mate of either the amount of overdiagnosis or the 
contribution of screening mammography to the 
reduction in breast-cancer mortality. The data 
regarding size-specific incidence, however, make 
clear that the magnitude of overdiagnosis is 
larger than is generally recognized. Furthermore, 
the data regarding size-specific case fatality rate 
clarify that decreasing breast-cancer mortality 
largely reflects improved cancer treatment.
