Abstract  
 
Introduction 
Occupational stress is a major modern health and safety challenges. Whilst the Emergency 
Department (ED) is known to be a high-pressure environment; the specific organisational stressors 
which affect ED staff have not been established.  
Methods 
We conducted a systematic review of literature examining the sources of organisational stress in the 
ED; their link to adverse health outcomes, and interventions designed to address them. A narrative 
review of contextual factors that may contribute to occupational stress was also performed. All 
articles written in English, French or Spanish were eligible for conclusion. Study quality was graded 
using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.  
Results 
25 full-text articles were eligible for inclusion in our systematic review. Most were of moderate 
quality, with two low and two high quality studies respectively. Whilst high demand and low job 
control were commonly featured; other studies demonstrated the role of insufficient support at 
work, effort-reward imbalance and organisational injustice in the development of adverse health 
and occupational outcomes. We found only one intervention in a peer-reviewed journal evaluating a 
stress reduction programme in ED staff. 
Conclusion 
Our review provides a guide to developing interventions that target the origins of stress in the ED.  It

What is already known on this subject? 
Occupational stress is associated with increased sickness absence, high staff turnover and early 
retirement. The ED is known to be a pressured work environment but the specific organisational 
stressors that affect staff are not well characterised; nor the types of interventions designed to 
address them. 
 
What this study adds? 
This review demonstrates that there is a diverse range of work stressors in the ED beyond work 
volume alone, but a dearth of interventions to address them. We suggest methods to develop 
these, and examples of successful interventions from other fields that may be of value.

Main Paper  
Introduction  
 
Occupational stress, defined as when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with 
the demands of a situation, is a leading modern health and safety challenge.1 Stress has been linked 
to several adverse health and occupational outcomes. Acute exposure can lead to sleep disturbance, 
fatigue and gastrointestinal upset. 2 Chronic stress exposures have been linked to early onset 
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, musculoskeletal illness, anxiety and 
depression. 3,4  Adverse lifestyle behaviours include higher rates of smoking and substance misuse, 
making mistakes and involvement in accidents. There is also a substantial body of literature 
suggesting that cumulative stress can lead to 'burnout' , a syndrome characterised by emotional 
exhaustion, cynicism and feelings of personal underachievement. 5 The Health and Safety Executive 
(HSE) in the United Kingdom (UK) has identified work-related stress as a leading cause of sickness 
absence, high staff turnover and early retirement in the UK workforce.6 
 
Occupational stress is recognised hazard in the education, agriculture, fishing and forestry industries. 
7 Teachers, police officers, social workers, prison officers and those working in call centres have also 
been affected.8,9  In hospital settings, studies have indicated that long work hours, high work 
intensity and lack of role clarity are associated with anxiety and depression amongst doctors and 
nurses.10 A study of family doctors identified that patient demands and work interruptions were 
strongly associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression.11    
 
Evidence suggests that Emergency Department (ED) staff may experience higher rates of anxiety, 
depression and burnout than their hospital colleagues.12,13 Although in the ED setting high work 
volume and time pressures are likely to be significant contributors; the potential influence of other 
factors should not be overlooked. These may include the quality of support and relationships with 
colleagues and managers; how valued and appreciated individuals for their work efforts, and staff 
�������� ����������� �� ��� decisions made about their job.14,15,16  For example, a recent UK study 
has established the importance of support at individual and organisational level in addressing 
compassion fatigue amongst ED consultants.17  A short narrative paper published in 2013, 
highlighted that job factors such as high work demands and long career length, as well as personal 
factors such as increasing age and work-family conflict are contributors to burnout in ED 
physicians.18 Nonetheless, the specific job-related stressors that lead to mental ill-health in ED staff 
 5 
 
are not known. This is essential to developing interventions to reduce stress and prevent burnout. 
6,18  
 
Accordingly, the primary aim of this review was to identify the main organisational stressors that are 
associated with psychological illness, burnout and adverse occupational outcomes in clinical ED staff.  
We have focussed on work factors because these are more amenable to organisational interventions 
than personal vulnerabilities such as maladaptive coping behaviours and attribution styles.19   
Additionally we wished to understand some of the contextual factors that contribute to stress in the 
ED, and examine interventions designed to reduce stress amongst ED staff.

Methods  
 
We conducted a systematic literature review of studies examining sources of organisational stress in 
clinical ED staff (medical, nursing, support workers) leading to psychological illness, burnout and 
adverse occupational outcomes. The review was conducted using the process suggested by the 
Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, England.20 This provides structured 
guidance for conducting systematic reviews of clinical trials, public health interventions and 
economic evaluations including the development of appropriate research questions; identifying a 
suitable search strategy; selecting studies; extracting data; assessing quality and documenting 
findings. Methodological recommendations are also provided for narrative reviews where meta-
analyses are inappropriate.  
 
Full-text articles written in English, French or Spanish examining were eligible for inclusion. The 
exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. Specifically, we excluded articles pertaining to trauma and 
violence since such events are more likely to lead to periods of acute stress which require different 
interventions to those of cumulative stress. Studies with less than 50 participants were arbitrarily 
excluded given the higher probability of random error (chance) with small sample sizes.

The following databases were searched with the support of a health information specialist based at 
the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the University of Sheffield from the years 
1990 to 2016: Embase; Medline; PsycInfo; British Nursing Index; DH-Data; Emcare; K����� F���� 
Health and Safety Science Abstracts and grey literature. An internet search using Google Scholar was 
also conducted. Keywords were grouped under four themes and included a variety of synonyms for 
occupational stress, hospital staff, emergency medicine and terms for psychological illness (anxiety, 
���������� �� ��������� T���� ���� �������� ���� ��� B������ ������� �O‘� ��� ������ ���� 
��� ������� �AND� ����� ������������ An example of the search strategy used for Medline is 
included in Supplement 1.   Abstracts of all identified articles were screened by SB and the health 
information specialist to determine their relevance to this study. References of selected full-text 
articles were also examined for publications which may be relevant to our study.  
Two authors (SB and HQ) assessed study quality using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa 
Scale. 21 A points-based system for selection bias, comparability and outcome was applied as shown 
in Table 2.  Studies were scored on a scale of nine points with a maximum of five for selection, two 
for comparability and two for outcome. We assigned a high quality study as scoring 7-9 points; 
Moderate quality 4-6 points, and low quality 0-3 points. The systematic review was conducted under 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, with 
the findings of the literature search recorded using the PRISMA flowchart. 22 Our analysis was 
intended to provide a descriptive summary of results and a meta-analysis would only be undertaken 
if suitable data were identified.

A narrative review of other contextual factors such as compassion fatigue, high communication 
loads, interruptions and performance-based targets was also conducted from the results of the 
literature search. The literature was also examined for interventions designed to reduce stress in ED 
staff. Given that our methodology included both systematic and narrative approaches, the study was 
not registered with a systematic review database.

Results 
Systematic Review of Organisational Stressors in the ED 
Our search identified 63 full-text articles. All included studies used questionnaire surveys to assess 
underlying stressors associated with the presence of psychiatric symptomatology. The heterogeneity 
of data precluded a meta-analysis. 
 
Insert Figure 1 here 
 
Of the 38 full-text articles excluded, twenty three were removed as acute sources of stress such as 
trauma, violence and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were examined. Six were excluded on the basis 
that only adverse health outcomes were reported.  Seven were removed as personal rather than 
occupational sources of stress were considered.  Three were removed as the efficacy of behavioural 
techniques such as coping strategies in managing mental ill-health were assessed. 
The majority of the 25 assessed full-texts were of moderate quality, with two low and two high 
quality studies. Most were conducted in high-income countries, and all used questionnaire to assess 
stress exposures and outcomes. Four studies (marked by an * in Table 1) used longitudinal designs, 
with the remainder cross-sectional.

Psychological Health and Burnout  
The existing literature suggests that high work volume, long working hours and high work intensity 
are common predictors of occupational stress and burnout.13,23,27,28,32-35 These findings reflect those 
of hospital nurses and doctors practising in other specialties both in the UK and internationally. 
47,48,49  Nonetheless, a number of studies in this review have identified that role ambiguity; low 
managerial and peer support; insufficient pay; lack of professional recognition and limited 
opportunities to attend educational conferences may also contribute to psychological morbidity and 
burnout. 30-32    Again, these findings are consistent with the existing literature examining burnout in 
other clinical specialities. 50, 51 Although not specifically highlighted in the table above, several studies 
reported higher rates of anxious and depressive symptoms in female healthcare workers, but 
findings according to age and years of experience were not consistent. Burnout was most prevalent 
amongst younger staff and those with fewer years of experience in the specialty.   
 13 
 
 
Compassion Fatigue and Contextual Factors 
Our search identified some articles examining the occupational causes of compassion fatigue (CF) in 
ED clinicians. CF includes features of burnout, but is also characterised by a lack of concern or 
empathy towards the misfortunes of others. Accordingly, the literature suggests that similar work 
factors underlie both CF and burnout such as high demands and low job control. Two articles also 
specifically highlighted the role of low managerial support in developing CF, with the former study 
also purporting a link between CF and irritability, clinical errors and plans for early retirement. 17, 52 
Other studies suggest high levels of compassion fatigue are not unique to the specialty, with similar 
rates found in doctors and nurses from fields such as nephrology, intensive care and oncology. 53 ,54 
 
We also found some articles examining the role of communication load, interruptions, multi-tasking 
and performance-based targets in contributing to ED work stress. One study established that the 
nurse-in-charge may be involved in an average of 1.68 communication interactions per minute. 55 A 
Swedish study also identified that information exchange was the most common ED activity to be 
multi-tasked. 56 Gender differences in communication loads for ED consultants suggest that females 
engage in higher activity. 57ED physicians have been shown to encounter up to fifteen interruptions 
per hour, with senior doctors and nurses more frequently affected. 58,59  
 
We found relatively few studies examining the impact of communication load and interruptions 
specifically on perceptions of stress. A study amongst UK general practitioners suggested that these 
may be significant stressors, 11 and in ED settings that interruptions may lead to clinical errors and 
decreased patient satisfaction. 60   Other work however has provided inconsistent information. 
Although not included in our table due to the small number of participants; no individual cited 
interruptions as a contributor to occupational stress in an interview study of 22 UK ED staff. 61 A later 
Danish study assessed the relationship between 12 work-related stressors and adverse clinical 
outcomes. 37 Although both nursing and particularly specialist medical staff cited interruptions as a 
frequent stressor; their emotional impact was not found to be high. This led the authors to suggest 
that ED staf� ��� ��� ������������� �� � �������� ���� of their work.   
 
 14 
 
We also found some articles assessing the relationship between performance targets and 
perceptions of stress. T�� �����-���� �������� �� E������ government initiative to admit or discharge 
98% of ED patients within four hours of arrival was most commonly featured. This target was the 
most frequently-cited occupational stressor in a sample of 22 clinical staff. 61 A qualitative study of 
ED nurses suggested that this target was one of several contributors to higher work demands in their 
department. 62 Another interview study of 27 ED clinical leaders in England suggested that lack of 
organisational ownership of this target contributed to conflicts between staff and concerns for 
patient safety. 63  
 
Interventions 
We found only one intervention designed to reduce workplace stress amongst ED staff published in 
a peer-reviewed journal. This assessed the effect of a twelve-week intervention of aromatherapy 
and massage sessions on perceived stress amongst ED nurses working within a single department. 64 
Changes in anxiety levels were measured using a standardised questionnaire administered pre and 
post-intervention. The authors concluded that their intervention was effective in reducing short-
term anxiety. 
Our search of the grey literature and Internet identified reports of other programmes designed to 
reduce stress amongst ED staff.  A Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance and

Discussion 
 
Workplace stress in the ED is of international significance given its established relationships with 
sickness absence, high staff turnover and early retirement.  In addition, those workers encountering 
stress but remaining in work may experience physical and psychological illness, be prone to making 
errors and develop maladaptive lifestyle behaviours.  It follows that work stress; burnout and 
intention to leave the specialty may often be related. This is of practical significance given high 
attrition rates amongst clinical ED staff both in the UK and abroad. 68 
 
Our review highlights the relevance of a number of factors including job demand and decision 
latitude, as well as managerial support and peer relationships in influencing perceptions of work 
stress. Importantly, these organisational stressors appear to be common contributors in the 
development of work-related mental illness; burnout; compassion fatigue; intention to leave the 
specialty and early retirement. These underlying occupational stressors are also common to many 
workforces. 69 This provides a template from which to design interventions that target the origins of 
stress within the ED; which this review demonstrates are currently lacking.  A review of sixty-three 
stress orientated interventions in 2003 identified that only three reported changes in burnout, with 
most focussing on secondary-level approaches such as increasing resilience through mindfulness and 
cognitive-behavioural therapy. 70 Nonetheless, research elsewhere has demonstrated the positive 
and long-lasting effects of primary-level management interventions designed to improve 
communication and relationships amongst healthcare staff, such as through the CREW (Civility, 
Respect and Engagement in the Workplace) programme in Canada. 71 A 2015 Cochrane review of 
stress interventions in healthcare staff found that that those designed to improve or interrupt work 
schedules may improve stress, but found no evidence for mentoring programmes. 72 
 
The studies presented in this review have a number of limitations. Most are cross-sectional and thus 
causal relationships are uncertain.  Many studies were based at a single site, limiting the 
generalisability of findings. Few studies employed a control group, either from the general 
population or an appropriate hospital unit. This is of relevance since, in practice, it is important to 
distinguish whether particular workplace stressors are specific to the ED, a feature of the hospital, or 
representative of the entire healthcare sector.  The use of questionnaires in all of the studies also 
raises the possibility of reporting bias, and few studies considered the role of common method 
 16 
 
variance when reporting results.  This study has predominantly reviewed the quantitative evidence 
for workplace stress in the ED.  Such studies have tested pre-defined hypotheses of stress rather 
than attempted to generate new theories. This may in part explain why the majority of studies have 
focussed on the demand �control-support model of occupational stress and far fewer considered 
other frameworks such as effort-reward imbalance and organisational justice.73,74 Our review has 
concentrated on organisational sources of stress; and we have not discussed the relevance of 
individual factors such as personal vulnerabilities to mental illness and ineffective coping strategies. 
Finally, our review has focussed on clinical staff. It is likely that non-clinical staff encounter 
substantial levels of occupational stress, as indicated in a study of ED clerical and administrative 
workers. 75 Thus a holistic, whole-department based approach towards tackling stress is advised. 
Further work should explore the role of these issues in causing occupational stress, and those of 
contextual concerns such as performance targets, high communication loads and interruptions. In 
addition, the relationship between chronic stress, compassion fatigue and moral distress merits 
further study. 76 The impact of daily ethical challenges in the ED such as illness disclosure, providing 
care with limited resources and where relevant, an inability to continue care due to financial 
constraints is also of interest. 77 
 
Despite the dearth of scientifically evaluated stress-reduction programmes in the ED; the findings 
from this review suggest that such interventions are plausible. It is probable that different EDs will 
experience different stressors, and thus we advise a tailored approach. This should first identify the 
root causes of stress and use this data to develop primary-level preventative interventions. These, 
for example, may include management interventions to provide additional staff support, increasing 
�������� �������� ���� ��� ��� or improve relationships through building morale.  Secondary-level 
interventions for those staff that may benefit from stress-reduction techniques may be relevant. 
These could include counselling, mindfulness and cognitive-behavioural therapies. Finally, tertiary 
level interventions such as individual case management with support from trained specialists such as 
occupational health professionals may be of value for complex cases.
