Abstract
Background: The observational association between mortality and body mass index
(BMI) is U-shaped, leading to highly publicized suggestions that moderate overweight is
beneficial to health. However, it is unclear whether elevated mortality is caused by low
BMI or if the association is confounded, for example by concurrent ill health.
Methods: Using HUNT, a Norwegian prospective study, 32 452 mother-offspring and
27 747 father-offspring pairs were followed up to 2009. Conventional hazard ratios for
parental mortality per standard deviation of BMI were estimated using Cox regression
adjusted for behavioural and socioeconomic factors. To estimate hazard ratios with
reduced susceptibility to confounding, particularly from concurrent ill health, the BMI of
parents’ offspring was used as an instrumental variable for parents’ own BMI. The shape
of mortality-BMI associations was assessed using cubic splines.
Results: There were 18 365 parental deaths during follow-up. Conventional associations
of mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease and cancer with parents’ own BMI
were substantially nonlinear, with elevated mortality at both extremes and minima at
21–25 kg m�2. Equivalent associations with offspring BMI were positive and there was
no evidence of elevated parental mortality at low offspring BMI. The linear instrumental
variable hazard ratio for all-cause mortality per standard deviation increase in BMI was
1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.10, 1.26), compared with 1.05 (1.03, 1.06) in the conven-
tional analysis.
Conclusions: Elevated mortality rates at high BMI appear causal, whereas excess mortality
at low BMI is likely exaggerated by confounding by factors including concurrent ill health.
Conventional studies probably underestimate the adverse population health conse-
quences of overweight.

Introduction
Average body mass index (BMI) in industrialized countries
has risen rapidly, causing concerns over the consequences for
health.1,2 High BMI is associated with increased mortality,
particularly from cardiovascular disease3,4 but also from
other causes including many cancers.5 Several studies have
also found increased mortality at low BMI, especially from re-
spiratory diseases and smoking-related cancers,3,4,6 leading to
observed mortality rates being lowest at close to 25kg m�2.7
Consequently, some articles in the popular and scientific lit-
erature have suggested that the health risks from overweight
have been overestimated, or those from underweight underes-
timated.8–12 The inverse association of BMI with mortality at
low BMI may represent a causal effect; indeed, it is biologic-
ally inevitable that at some point low BMI becomes harmful.
However, uncorrected confounding may amplify the apparent
magnitude of harm caused by low BMI and increase the
BMI associated with optimal survival. The effects of ill health
(i.e. reverse causation) and smoking on both concurrent
BMI and subsequent mortality are of particular concern
many13,14 although some disagree.15 Omission of follow-up
for a short period after baseline measurements tends to
attenuate such negative associations but not completely,3,16
perhaps because disease effects on BMI can precede diagnosis
or death by decades. Statistical adjustment for confounding
factors is very limited in its effectiveness.17 Restriction to
never-smoking and/or healthy people at baseline18–20 also
attenuates the apparent harmful effects of low BMI and
emphasizes those of high BMI, at the cost of generalizability
and possible residual confounding due to measurement error.
An alternative means of overcoming confounding is the
use of an instrumental variable.21,22 An ideal instrument is
correlated with the exposure of interest, but independent
of confounders of the outcome-exposure relationship.
Mendelian randomization, where the instrument is a geno-
type, has consistently found a positive causal effect of BMI
on ischaemic heart disease.23,24 However, it is difficult to
infer the shape of nonlinear associations from genetic in-
struments. Here we use a continuous variable, the BMI of
a person’s offspring, as a proxy and instrument for the
person’s own BMI. Such an instrument may not be inde-
pendent of socioeconomic or behavioural confounding but
is probably effective against reverse causation.25 A large
study of Swedish men previously used the same approach,
but lacked the detailed covariate data available in the pre-
sent study. We also investigate the instrument’s validity
using bias component plots.26 We start by making conven-
tional analyses of the associations of all-cause and cause-
specific mortality with a person’s own BMI. Comparison
of these with analyses using offspring BMI as an instru-
ment allow us to consider the likely pattern and magnitude
of confounding in the conventional analyses.
Methods
Study population and data linkage
HUNT is a population-based health study conducted in
Nord-Trøndelag, a rural Norwegian county with about 130
000 residents. At each of three surveys (HUNT1, 1984–86;
HUNT2, 1995–97; HUNT3, 2006–08), every resident of at
least 20 years of age was invited to participate. Children of
13 to 19 years of age were also recruited in three
YoungHUNT surveys (Supplementary Table 1, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). We initially extracted all
66 246 participants with at least one participating parent
(Figure 1). Full details of HUNT are available online [http://
www.ntnu.edu/hunt]. Briefly, participants at every HUNT
and YoungHUNT survey attended a physical examination at
which, among other things, their BMI and blood pressure
were recorded. In HUNT2 and HUNT3, a blood sample was
taken and blood lipids were measured. For each individual,
we used data from the earliest available HUNT survey. This
maximized the period parents were at risk and minimized
the influence of illness-induced weight loss in old age.
Key Messages
• Conventional observational analyses of BMI and mortality are probably confounded by ill health.
• The use of offspring BMI as an instrumental variable for own BMI avoids this confounding.
• Linear analyses of BMI and mortality using offspring BMI as an instrumental variable give higher estimates of the
harmful effects of higher BMI than conventional analyses do.
• Plots using offspring BMI as a proxy for own BMI suggest that conventional analyses overestimate the harmful
effects of underweight and underestimate the harmful effects of overweight.

 YoungHUNT data were used for offspring only when
HUNT data were unavailable, to increase sample size while
minimizing adolescence-related variation in BMI.
Participants completed questionnaires providing informa-
tion on smoking, alcohol use, exercise, education, employ-
ment and aspects of their health status (Supplementary
Table 1). Participants’ deaths between the beginning of
HUNT1 (1 January 1984) and 31 December 2009 were
identified using Statistics Norway’s Death Registry. Causes
of death were grouped into categories according to the
International Classification of Diseases code (Supplementary
Table 2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Participants’ emigration records were obtained from the
National Population Registry. Individuals were removed
from each analysis if BMI data for the parent in question, or
for the offspring, were missing. The data were also restricted
to one offspring per parent, chosen randomly except that,
where possible, the same offspring was chosen for both
parents. This left 32 452 mother-offspring and 27 747
father-offspring pairs in the main analyses.
Data description and preparation
BMI values were assigned to quintiles within each age
band (years), sex and HUNT survey. Within these quin-
tiles, we summarized offspring and parents’ health-related
characteristics and characterized their association with
BMI using linear or logistic regression, as appropriate.
Before all further analyses, BMI in parents and offspring
was adjusted for age, sex and year of measurement, by tak-
ing residuals from a sex-specific full factorial regression
model against HUNT survey (categorical, with contempor-
ary HUNT and YoungHUNT combined) and a cubic
spline of age with five knots at percentiles of 5, 27.5, 50,
72.5, 95. These residuals were divided by the residual
standard deviation (SD) of the model (4.33 kg m-2 for
women and 3.39 kg m-2 for men) to give sex-specific
Z-scores for BMI.
Statistical analyses
Separate Cox proportional hazards models with parents’
age as the time axis were used to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs) per SD of: (i) a parent’s own BMI; and (ii) their
offspring’s BMI. All models were adjusted for parental
date of birth (cubic spline with five knots; percentiles as
above), to account for secular trends. Models were run
with and without an additional set of potential confound-
ing factors (Supplementary Table 1), referred to hereafter
as full adjustment and comprising parental smoking,
alcohol use, exercise, education, own employment and
spouse’s employment (measured simultaneously with the
parent’s BMI), as well as offspring smoking (measured
simultaneously with offspring BMI). Observations were
left-truncated at the latest of the offspring’s birth and the
parent’s BMI measurement, and right-censored at the
earliest of the parent’s date of death or emigration, or 31
December 2009 (the latest follow-up). The shape of associ-
ations
was
examined
by
plotting
cubic
spline
fits
(five knots; percentiles as above). Models were run separ-
ately for mothers and fathers, but also for both parents
together.
These
combined
models
were
additionally
adjusted for parental sex, and used robust standard errors
clustered by offspring identity to account for the non-
independence of mothers and fathers. The difference
between maternal and paternal HRs was tested by adding
an interaction between parental sex and the exposure (own
or offspring BMI) and doing a Z-test of its coefficient.

 Parent-specific results were reported when there was some
support (P < 0.10) for a difference in HR.
Instrumental variable analysis was used to estimate
parental HR per SD of parental BMI, with offspring BMI
as an instrument. This method avoids some sources of
confounding between parental mortality and BMI.21,22
First, maternal, paternal and combined parental BMI were
each regressed on offspring BMI, with full adjustment as
described above for the corresponding Cox model. HRs
were then estimated by exponentiating the ratio between
the natural logarithm of the corresponding HR per SD
of offspring BMI (see above) and the adjusted regression
coefficient
for
parental
BMI
against
offspring
BMI
(see Supplementary Methods for details, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). Confidence intervals
were calculated using Taylor series expansions. The differ-
ence between each HR calculated using the instrumental
variable and the corresponding conventional HR (per SD
of the parent’s own BMI) was assessed with a Durbin–
Wu–Hausman
test
(see
Supplementary
Methods
for
details). Bias component plots26 were used to estimate the
relative bias in estimates made by conventional and instru-
mental
variable
methods,
using
measured
covariates
(Supplementary Table 1) as proxies for unmeasured ones.

 Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.2 on a
desktop machine and Stata 12.1 on the University of
Bristol’s Blue Crystal high power computing cluster.
Results
Offspring with higher BMI, and their parents, had higher
blood pressure, lower education, lower physical activity
and lower employment status (Table 1). The parents of
high-BMI offspring had higher BMI, smoked more and be-
came parents younger. Offspring in the lowest quintile of
BMI, and their parents, tended to be heavier drinkers, but
there was no clear trend overall. Parental and offspring
BMI were taken from the same HUNT wave for 41.7% of
all
parent-offspring
pairs,
with
the
offspring’s
BMI
otherwise taken from one (39.4%) or two (17.8%) surveys
later or rarely from one (0.9%) or two (0.1%) surveys ear-
lier. The median age in years (and interquartile range) at
BMI measurement was 27.2 (19.0, 35.5) for offspring,
44.6 (33.4, 60.9) for mothers and 46.2 (35.0, 61.6) for
fathers. For each SD increase in offspring BMI, maternal,
paternal and combined parental BMI increased by 0.24 SD
(95% CI: 0.23, 0.25), 0.22 SD (0.21, 0.23) and 0.23 SD
(0.22, 0.24), respectively. These values were used in the
instrumental variable analysis. The associations were
approximately linear (Supplementary Figure 1, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online), and are similar to
parent-offspring BMI correlations reported elsewhere.27

Offspring BMI was pre-adjusted for age and year of measurement separately within each sex, and the residual SD were 4.33 kg m�2 in women and 3.39 kg m�2
in men. All models were adjusted for parental age and date of birth. Combined models for both parents were also adjusted for parental sex, and used robust stand-
ard errors clustered by offspring identity. Full adjustment additionally involved adjustment for parental alcohol use, education, employment (own and spouse’s),
exercise levels and smoking (own and offspring). Hazard ratios for mothers and fathers were compared by introducing an interaction between offspring BMI and
parental sex to the combined model, and reporting the P-value from a Z-test of the corresponding coefficient. Separate results for mothers and fathers are shown
where there was at least suggestive evidence (P < 0.10) from any analysis (minimal or full adjustment, own or offspring BMI) for a difference between them.

 with parental mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, dia-
betes and cancer. These positive associations were slightly
attenuated by full adjustment. HRs for all-cause, CVD and
CHD mortality per SD of offspring BMI were somewhat
stronger for mothers than for fathers. However, for most
causes of death there was little evidence that HRs differed
between the parents (Table 2). HRs calculated per SD of
parents’ own BMI (Table 3) were generally stronger than
those calculated for offspring BMI (Table 2). Mortality
from all-causes, stroke, cancer and perhaps cardiovascular
diseases was non-linearly associated with parents’ own
BMI, with increased mortality at both extremes (Figure 2;
and Supplementary Figure 2, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online). Corresponding associations with
offspring BMI did not show this clear nonlinearity, and
were consistent with positive (or perhaps null for cancer)
associations across the observed range of BMI. The
width of the confidence intervals, however, meant that an
inverse association at below-average offspring BMI could
also not be ruled out for stroke (and perhaps cardiovascu-
lar
disease
and
all-cause
mortality)
among
fathers.
Mortality from respiratory diseases and from external
causes was elevated only at low values of a person’s own
BMI, but there was little evidence that it was associated
with offspring BMI.

All BMI were pre-adjusted for age and year of measurement separately within each sex, and the residual SD were 4.33 kg m�2 in women and 3.39 kg m�2 in
men. All models were adjusted for parental age, date of birth, alcohol use, education, employment (own and spouse’s), exercise levels and smoking (own and off-
spring). Combined models for both parents were also adjusted for parental sex, and used robust standard errors clustered by offspring identity. Hazard ratios for
mothers and fathers were compared by introducing an interaction between own BMI and sex to the combined model, and reporting the P-value from a Z-test
of the corresponding coefficient. Separate results for mothers and fathers are shown where there was at least suggestive evidence (P < 0.10) from any analysis
(minimal or full adjustment, own or offspring BMI) for a difference between them. Comparisons between the conventional and instrumental variable methods
(POwn vs IV) are P-values from Durbin–Wu–Hausman tests.

 Figure 2. Selected associations of all-cause and cause-specific mortality with own and offspring BMI (kg m�2). Hazard ratios were calculated per
standard deviation of BMI (4.33 kg m�2 in women and 3.39 kg m�2 in men) and back-converted to the original units (upper x-axis for men, lower
x-axis for women). Hazard ratios are relative to a person of mean BMI for their group (fathers, mothers, offspring) and are adjusted for parental age,
date of birth, alcohol use, education, employment (own and spouse’s), exercise levels and smoking (own and offspring’s). BMI was pre-adjusted for
age, sex and HUNT survey. Data were restricted to those with valid data on parent and offspring (but not necessarily both parents). Plotted data were
truncated at the 1st and 99th percentiles of BMI to improve resolution in the main part of the distribution.

 HRs calculated using the instrumental variable were al-
most always greater than those calculated directly from the
parent’s own BMI (Table 3). That is; positive associations
were amplified whereas negative associations were attenu-
ated or made positive. HRs estimated by the two methods
could only be distinguished with confidence for all-cause,
CVD, CHD and diabetes mortality (the latter only for
fathers), perhaps due to the wide confidence intervals
around the instrumental variable estimates. The bias asso-
ciated with most measured covariates was indistinguish-
able between the methods, but there was some evidence
that the instrumental variable estimates were more suscep-
tible to bias from indicators of socioeconomic position
(Supplementary Figure 3, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). Parental smoking biased estimates from the
two methods in opposite directions.
Discussion
Summary and interpretation of findings
In the middle and upper parts of their respective ranges, we
found that parents’ own BMI and offspring BMI were both
positively associated with mortality from all-causes, CVD,
CHD, stroke, diabetes and cancer, supporting a causal in-
terpretation.3,5 At low values we found that own BMI was
inversely associated with mortality from all-causes, CVD,
CHD, stroke, respiratory disease, cancer and external
causes, but when offspring BMI was used as a proxy for
own BMI, there was no clear evidence for an inverse asso-
ciation with these causes of death at low BMI. This could
be in part because of the width of the confidence intervals.
The results for stroke among fathers, although not incon-
sistent with a linear or null association, were suggestive of
an inverse association at low BMI similar to that observed
with fathers’ own BMI. Furthermore, it should be empha-
sized that the associations with offspring BMI are not
equivalently scaled estimates of the association with own
BMI; we would expect both positive and negative associ-
ations to be weakened due to the imperfect correspondence
between own and offspring BMI. However, where the
proxy plots maintain positive associations at high BMI but
lose or reverse negative associations at low BMI, it suggests
that the inverse associations with mortality seen at low val-
ues of own BMI in this and perhaps other studies were
inflated by confounding. Results for site-specific cancers
were relatively under-powered but showed patterns which
were generally consistent with those identified elsewhere.5
The use of offspring BMI as an instrument, rather than
analysing own BMI directly, amplified positive linear asso-
ciations with mortality and attenuated negative ones. Use
of genetic instruments (and possibly some non-genetic
instruments) may amplify associations because the instru-
ment better represents lifetime exposure than a single
observed exposure does.28 This is due to reduced measure-
ment error, not to differences in confounding. However,
when the instrument is offspring BMI and the exposure is
parents’ own BMI, they are likely to be subject to similar
measurement error. Furthermore, any reduction in meas-
urement error would amplify both positive and negative
associations (i.e. move them further from the null). Rather,
the few causes of death which were negatively associated
with own BMI (respiratory diseases, external causes and
lung cancer) were attenuated in the instrumental variable
analyses. This could be due to any difference in confound-
ing between the two methods, but we consider negative
confounding of the conventional analysis by weight loss
due to ill health14,29 to be the most likely candidate.
Comparison with other studies
Three other studies are particularly relevant for compari-
son. The Prospective Studies Collaboration3 combined 57
prospective studies of observational mortality-BMI associ-
ations, amd the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration20
meta-analysed
239
prospective
studies
with
extreme
restrictions designed to limit confounding. The only other
study we are aware of to use offspring BMI as an instru-
ment for BMI in survival analysis is one conducted on
Swedish men measured at their conscription medical
examinations.25
The Prospective Studies Collaboration3 found elevated
all-cause mortality at low values of BMI, which was
mainly due to mortality from smoking-related respiratory
disease, although weaker inverse associations at less than
25 kg m�2 were found for some other causes of death. We
also found that the strongest inverse associations at low
BMI were for respiratory diseases, with weaker inverse as-
sociations for many other causes of death. The Prospective
Studies Collaboration could not explain their results be-
cause they had excluded early deaths to avoid confounding
by ill health; whereas our approach, avoiding confounding
by using offspring BMI as an instrument, tended to
eliminate the inverse associations.
To reduce the impact of confounding and reverse caus-
ation, the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration excluded
approximately 63% of the available participants: ever-
smokers, those with diagnosed pre-existing disease and the
first 5 years of each participant’s follow-up. These precau-
tions
increased
the
apparent
detrimental
effect
of
overweight and decreased the apparent detrimental effect
of underweight, and reduced the BMI range at which
mortality was minimized from 25–30 to 20–25 kg m�2.
Nonetheless, the association between mortality and BMI

 remained J-shaped, albeit less so than in conventionally
controlled analyses and with a nadir at lower BMI. Our
plots using offspring BMI as a proxy for parents’ own BMI
generally did not show a J-shape. This may reflect a degree
of residual confounding in the meta-analysis or the limita-
tions of using offspring BMI as a proxy (wide confidence
intervals at low BMI in Figure 2 do not preclude a slight
J-shape, and harmful effects of extreme low BMI are
intuitively expected).
Davey Smith et al.25 used a younger, all-male Swedish
cohort which had limited data on fathers’ own BMI, re-
stricting the death causes they could analyse. They found a
similar association with all-cause mortality to that found
here, but the HRs they found for CVD, whether using
fathers’ own BMI conventionally or using an instrument,
were considerably greater. Their positive associations be-
tween parental mortality and offspring BMI were also
slightly greater than ours for most death causes, perhaps
because the offspring in their study were all the same sex
and were measured at similar ages. Their overall conclu-
sion, that conventional analyses of BMI risk underestimat-
ing the positive causal association of mortality with high
BMI and overestimating any negative association with low
BMI, was consistent with ours.
Strengths and limitations of the study
The study benefits from a large prospective cohort of par-
ticipants, covering a large proportion of the target popula-
tion. A possible source of selection bias is the restriction to
those members of the population who participated in
HUNT and had children who also participated in HUNT
(which required survival to at least 13 years of age). The
availability of BMI data from both parents and offspring
allowed a direct comparison of instrumental variables
methods with conventional analyses of own BMI, and
extensive
questionnaire
data
allowed
adjustment
for
potentially important confounding factors such as smoking
behaviour. The estimation of hazard ratios using instru-
mental variables introduces some issues around collapsibil-
ity.30 These can be avoided by the use of an additive
hazard model, but these are less commonly used, less well
understood and can result in hazard functions that stray
below zero.31
The use of offspring BMI as an instrument is intended
to give a better estimate of the causal relationship between
BMI and mortality. However, instrumental variable meth-
ods reduce the precision of estimates, and depend on three
key assumptions (Supplementary Figure 4, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online). Of these, we have
shown, first, that the instrument is strongly associated with
the exposure. An additional requirement, not usually
acknowledged, is that the instrument should not be caused
by the exposure. In most applications, the exposure is
caused by the instrument, but this is unlikely in the present
study. Rather, we ascribe the association between parental
and offspring BMI to a shared environmental and genetic
background, and assume any causal effect of parental BMI
on offspring BMI to be minimal. This is consistent with the
high heritability of BMI,32 the failure of negative control
exposure studies to demonstrate mediation by intra-uterine
effects33,34 and the lack of intra-uterine or other causal
effects of maternal BMI on offspring BMI in Mendelian
randomization.35 Furthermore, if there were a substantial
causal effect of the exposure on the instrument, the
confounding
pathways
in
the
instrumental
variables
and conventional analyses would be the same, so the
instrumental variables estimate would be biased towards
the estimate from conventional analyses.
It is not possible to test directly the other two assump-
tions of an instrumental variables analysis that: (ii) the in-
strument is independent of the unmeasured confounding
and (iii) there are no pathways from the instrument to the
outcome, except through the exposure. Examination of
measured covariates (Supplementary Figure 3, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online) suggested that the in-
strumental variable estimates might be more confounded
by socioeconomic factors such as parental age, education
or employment than the conventional estimates were.
However, we expected existing ill health (i.e. reverse caus-
ation) to be an important confounder of the conventional
estimates but not the instrumental variable estimates, since
its likely effect is much greater on the parents’ own BMI
than on their offspring’s. Existing ill health was only very
crudely
represented
among
the
measured
covariates
(and not included in the adjustment set). Several covariates
representing health status in the bias components test
[systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, angina, diabetes, myocardial infarct (MI) his-
tory] may have been mediators rather than confounders of
BMI and mortality. They were therefore not adjusted for
in the main analysis and their results in the covariate bal-
ance tests should be interpreted with great caution.
Nonetheless, the results for functional impairment and
self-reported health were weakly suggestive of bias in the
instrumental variable analysis that was similar to, or less
than, that in the conventional analysis (albeit with wide
and overlapping confidence intervals).
In terms of the implications for medical practice, instru-
mental variable methods use observational data and are thus
more informative about the (potentially causal) association
between a person’s BMI and their mortality risks than they
are about the potential effects of weight loss or gain.
For overweight people to lose weight (as opposed to not

 gaining it) may or may not bring the benefits expected from
population-level observational data.36,37
In conclusion, the use of offspring BMI as an instrument
may be more vulnerable to socioeconomic and behavioural
confounding than a conventional analysis of mortality and
BMI, but less vulnerable to the important bias due to re-
verse causation. The results presented here support causal
explanations for elevated mortality from all-causes, cardio-
vascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes
and cancer at high BMI. Inverse associations at low levels
of BMI were not apparent when offspring BMI was used as
a proxy for parents’ own BMI. This suggests that such asso-
ciations in conventional observational analyses are inflated
by confounding by ill health, and confirm the conventional
view that overweight is detrimental to health.
