 SYNOPSIS: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. 
33 
It often begins in adolescence, setting a course for later life. We have tracked 
34 
the time course of LBP in the Raine Study cohort from the age of 14 years 
35 
into early adulthood. Our work highlights that LBP is already prevalent at 14 
36 
years increasing across adolescence and into early adulthood. It is often co-
37 
morbid with other musculoskeletal pain. For some adolescents LBP has little 
38 
impact – while for others its impact includes care seeking, taking medication, 
39 
taking time off school and work, as well as modifying physical and functional 
40 
activity. Of concern, the prevalence of LBP with impact also increases across 
41 
adolescence, reaching adult rates at the age of 22. The predictors of disabling 
42 
LBP in adolescence are multi-dimensional. They include: female sex, negative 
43 
back pain beliefs, poor mental health status, somatic complaints, involvement 
44 
in sports, and altered stress responses. Genetics also plays a role. Ironically, 
45 
the factors that we have historically thought to be important predictors of LBP 
46 
such as ‘poor’ spinal posture, scoliosis, carrying school bags, joint 
47 
hypermobility, and poor back muscle endurance are not strong predictors. 
48 
This challenges our clinical beliefs and highlights that adolescent LBP needs 
49 
a flexible and targeted multi-dimensional approach to assessment and 
50 
management. In most cases we recommend a cognitive functional approach 
51 
which challenges negative LBP beliefs, educates the adolescent regarding 
52 
factors associated with their LBP, restores functional capacity where it is 
53 
impaired, and encourages healthy lifestyle habits.

 Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of years lived with disability in the 
57 
world.34 Contemporary evidence supports that while rare in children under 10 
58 
years of age, LBP commonly emerges during adolescence and for many this 
59 
sets a trajectory for later life.14, 18  Along with other research groups,18 we 
60 
have tracked the time course of LBP, in our case in the Raine Study cohort 
61 
(rainestudy.org.au) from the age of 14 years into early adulthood (22 years). 
62 
In this population, we have also explored the relationship between genetic, 
63 
physical, psychosocial, biological, and lifestyle factors and the experience of 
64 
LBP. In addition, we have conducted a number of studies in adolescent 
65 
clinical and focused sporting populations.2-4, 39, 45 Together these studies, 
66 
provide an insight into the development and multi-dimensional nature of 
67 
adolescent LBP at a population level, as well as an understanding of the 
68 
experience of LBP at an individual level. We have also conducted focused 
69 
intervention studies in adolescents with LBP, which have demonstrated that a 
70 
cognitive functional approach to management has a positive effect on young 
71 
people with LBP.13, 37, 52, 64  
72 
 
73 
Prevalence of LBP in adolescence and its impact 
74 
Consistent with other epidemiological research18 we have identified that LBP 
75 
is already prevalent at 14 years with 30% of females and 26% of males 
76 
reporting LBP in the last month and 11% of both sexes reporting chronic LBP 
77 
(LBP lasting >3 months).48 By the age of 17 years, significant sex differences 
78 
emerge with 13% of males and 26% of females reporting the presence of 
79 
chronic LBP.41 Whether the pattern of ‘chronic’ LBP in this group is 
80 
characterized by constant or episodic pain is unclear. Adolescent LBP is also

 often comorbid with neck pain and other pain problems such as headache.8 
82 
During the transition from 17 through to 22 years of age, the prevalence of 
83 
LBP over the past month significantly increased from 32% to 45%.14  
84 
 
85 
For many adolescents, LBP has little impact on their activities of daily living, 
86 
sports participation, work, and school activities and they do not seek medical 
87 
attention or take medication.41 Of concern however is the significant number 
88 
of adolescents with chronic LBP (20% at 17 years) associated with impact, 
89 
defined as taking medication, health care seeking, modifying physical and 
90 
daily life activities, and taking time off school and or work.41 This later group is 
91 
characterized by poorer physical and mental health status, and a greater 
92 
proportion of females.  
93 
 
94 
Between the ages of 17 through to 22 we have identified 4 different cluster 
95 
trajectories of LBP associated with negative impact. Cluster 1 had a 
96 
consistently low prevalence of LBP (53% of cohort), cluster 2 had an 
97 
increasing prevalence of LBP (22%), cluster 3 had a reducing prevalence 
98 
(15%), and cluster 4 had a consistently high prevalence (10%).14 These 
99 
findings support that while the overall population burden of LBP increases 
100 
between adolescence and adulthood, different individual trajectories exist.  
101 
 
102 
Red flags and serious pathology 
103 
Serious pathological causes of LBP, while rare in adolescence (less than 1%), 
104 
must be considered as part of a clinical triage.26 The presence of insidious 
105 
onset of severe LBP when associated with a cluster of symptoms such as

 night pain, fever, unexplained weight loss, neurological deficits, and greater 
107 
than 30 minute morning stiffness warrants further investigation to rule out 
108 
pathologies such as malignancy, inflammatory disorders, and infection.26, 36  
109 
 
110 
Specific lumbar pathology 
111 
While MRI findings such as disc degeneration are prevalent (30%) in 
112 
adolescents as young as 13 years, pathology associated with LBP is relatively 
113 
rare.27 Where LBP is acute, disabling, and associated with a clear history of a 
114 
traumatic spinal injury (such as a fall off a bike), screening for traumatic 
115 
fracture is warranted. The prevalence of spondylolysis / spondylolisthesis in 
116 
adolescents is approximately 6%, is often asymptomatic and is associated 
117 
with disrupted ossification of the pars interarticularis due to repetitive 
118 
mechanical stress.28 Where LBP is associated with sports involving repetitive 
119 
loading, coupled with the finding of a step-deformity on palpation, screening 
120 
for spondylolysis / spondylolisthesis should be considered.22 The non-
121 
operative management of spondylolysis / spondylolisthesis results in 
122 
successful outcomes for the majority of people, with the outcome unrelated to 
123 
the presence of bone healing.28 Only in the case of high grade 
124 
spondylolisthesis associated with neurological / cauda equina symptoms is 
125 
surgical considerations indicated.30 
126 
 
127 
While exact estimates are limited, disc herniation associated with sciatica is 
128 
reported to be very low in adolescents (0.2-0.6%).15 The presence of acute 
129 
sciatica with associated neurological deficits with or without cauda equina 
130 
symptoms warrants investigation.26, 36  Even in the presence of pathology,

 other multi-dimensional factors, still need consideration as part of 
132 
assessment, prognostic profiling, and management planning.42  
133 
 
134 
LBP without related pathology 
135 
For the majority of adolescents, LBP has no clear patho-anatomical basis, 
136 
leaving a diagnostic and management vacuum.36 This vacuum is often filled 
137 
by common beliefs with regards to the underlying basis of LBP. Some view 
138 
LBP as a normal life experience during adolescent development that is not 
139 
disabling and should not be given attention.50  While this is the case for some 
140 
adolescents who have LBP that is transient and non-disabling, for a 
141 
substantial number of adolescents, LBP has a profound and growing 
142 
impact.14, 41 Diagnostic labels commonly considered to be related to LBP 
143 
include hypermobility syndromes, postural syndromes (such as slump sitting), 
144 
muscular imbalances, and over-use disorders, where LBP is provoked by 
145 
sport participation.46 Clinical advice is often provided to avoid or minimize 
146 
specific sports, wear special back-packs or minimize their use, and adhere to 
147 
specific exercise and postural correction programs.1  
148 
 
149 
While some of these labels are clinically appealing, the evidence underpinning 
150 
them is largely limited. Our group has investigated the relationship between a 
151 
number of these different factors and LBP in adolescents as outlined below. 
152 
 
153 
Multi-dimensional factors and adolescent LBP – Physical Factors 
154 
Joint Hypermobility 
155 
While there is debate within the research literature, there is a common clinical

 view that LBP in adolescents may be attributable to generalized joint 
157 
hypermobility.30, 35 We have investigated the relationship between LBP and 
158 
generalized joint hypermobility (defined as both ≥ 4/9 and ≥ 6/9 hypermobile 
159 
joints using the Beighton scoring criteria) in large cohort of 14 year olds.  We 
160 
identified that generalized joint hypermobility is prevalent in adolescents 
161 
irrespective of LBP status, especially in girls. However, no relationship 
162 
between joint hypermobility and chronic musculoskeletal pain (including LBP) 
163 
was found in this cohort.32 More importantly we did not find generalized joint 
164 
hypermobility at 14 years to be predictive of LBP with impact at 17 years in 
165 
this population.57 Together these data raise questions regarding the validity of 
166 
‘generalized hypermobility syndrome’ as a diagnosis related to chronic and/ or 
167 
disabling LBP in adolescents.  
168 
 
169 
Scoliosis 
170 
Scoliosis may present in a small group of adolescents with its prevalence 
171 
ranging from 0.5-5% based on population studies.6 While there is a common 
172 
belief and some reports that scoliosis is a cause of LBP,30 a recent systematic 
173 
review into this relationship revealed that the prevalence of LBP in those 
174 
adolescents with scoliosis is similar to those without.6 Further the magnitude 
175 
of spinal curvature based on Cobb angle does not correlate well with the 
176 
presence of pain. Together, the current evidence does not support a clear 
177 
relationship between scoliosis and LBP.6 
178 
 
179 
Spinal posture 
180 
There is a common belief that postural problems such as slump sitting are a

 cause of LBP.26, 40 Previous research regarding the relationship between 
182 
posture and LBP have been limited by sample size, restricted methods for 
183 
posture measurement, as well as a lack of control for potential confounding 
184 
variables such as sex and psychological status.33, 68 We investigated the 
185 
relationship between slump sitting and LBP in 14 year olds. We identified that 
186 
slump sitting was associated with male sex, non-neutral standing postures, 
187 
lower perceived self-efficacy, lower back muscle endurance, greater TV use, 
188 
and higher body mass index (BMI). Poorer Child Behaviour Check List scores 
189 
(a measure of mental health status) had the strongest relationship to LBP 
190 
made worse by sitting, whereas degree of ‘slump’ in sitting, female sex, and 
191 
back muscle endurance were only weakly related.43 Slump sitting at 14 was 
192 
only weakly predictive of LBP associated with impact at age 17 years.57 
193 
 
194 
We also investigated sitting posture in a small group of 14-16 year old Raine 
195 
Study participants with chronic and moderately disabling LBP and identified 2 
196 
sitting posture subgroups. The first group was characterized by lordotic sitting 
197 
postures that were associated with extension pain provocation patterns; the 
198 
other group had slump sitting postures that were associated with flexion pain 
199 
provocation patterns.3 These findings suggest extremes of sitting spinal 
200 
posture (both lordotic and slumped / flexed) may be associated with chronic 
201 
LBP in adolescents rather than a single posture such as slump sitting.3, 4 We 
202 
also identified repositioning deficits were associated with these postural 
203 
patterns in these adolescents.2 This is consistent with our previous 
204 
observations in an adult population with chronic LBP.16  
205

 In another study we investigated sagittal plane standing postures in 14 year 
207 
olds and identified 4 posture subgroups (neutral, sway back, flat back, and 
208 
lordotic).59 A number of relationships between LBP and non-neutral spinal 
209 
postures were identified. For example hyperlordotic postures were associated 
210 
with a greater chance of reporting LBP in the last month as well as LBP 
211 
related to carrying a backpack. This posture group was also associated with 
212 
higher BMI scores.59 Further investigations identified that a high BMI in early 
213 
childhood was predictive of hyperlordosis in early adolescence suggesting a 
214 
relationship between BMI and spinal posture development linked to LBP.58 
215 
Non-neutral standing postures at 14 were also weakly related to LBP with 
216 
impact at 17 years.57  
217 
 
218 
These findings together highlight that generic postural advice for LBP, both at 
219 
an individual and population level, is not warranted as postural presentations 
220 
in adolescents are heterogenous and postural patterns are only weakly 
221 
predictive of future adolescent LBP with impact. In adolescents with chronic 
222 
LBP, their individual LBP experience and unique postural presentation should 
223 
be evaluated when providing postural advice.  
224 
 
225 
While the exact relationship between LBP and posture is not clear, different 
226 
potential mechanisms have been proposed. First, the relationship between 
227 
sagittal spinal posture and LBP may be associated with altered motor control 
228 
strategies, which may have implications for patterns of spinal loading.47  Static 
229 
sitting and standing postures have also been associated with dynamic loading 
230 
postures suggestive that a postural signature is carried into dynamic tasks.66

 While speculative, habitual patterns of static and dynamic postural loading 
232 
may reflect a lack of movement variability, exerting cumulative stress on the 
233 
spine. The influence of other factors such as high BMI linked to hyperlordotic 
234 
and slump sitting postures may have both additional loading and metabolic 
235 
implications for LBP,58 while psychological factors may have a sensitizing 
236 
influence.43  
237 
 
238 
Movement patterns 
239 
While a relationship between sports participation and LBP in adolescents has 
240 
been identified,57 there is very little research into the role that movement 
241 
patterns play in adolescents with LBP during these activities. We have 
242 
conducted 2 biomechanical studies in adolescents, investigating the 
243 
relationship between adolescent LBP related to sport and spinal kinematics. 
244 
In one study, adolescent males with LBP provoked by rowing demonstrated a 
245 
greater tendency to posture their spine closer to end range flexion during the 
246 
drive phase compared to a pain free comparison group.38 In a second study, 
247 
adolescent tennis players with LBP demonstrated reduced lower lumbar, 
248 
pelvis, and pelvis/shoulder right rotation, with their pelvis tilted laterally more 
249 
to the right (toward their racquet arm) and an earlier peak right knee extension 
250 
velocity during the drive phase of the serve.11 Furthermore, the tennis players 
251 
with LBP demonstrated greater peak left lateral forces across their lower back 
252 
when compared to the comparison group.12 While these studies were cross 
253 
sectional and therefore the direction of the relationship is not known, the 
254 
movement patterns observed could potentially result in increased spinal 
255 
loading which may be related to LBP. Further research into the relationship

 between movement patterns and LBP is sport is required. 
257 
 
258 
Poor back muscle endurance 
259 
We have investigated the relationship between back muscle endurance and 
260 
LBP in 14 years olds. While relationships between back muscle endurance 
261 
and physical, lifestyle, and psychological domains were noted, no relationship 
262 
with LBP was identified.61 However in a small group of 15 year olds with 
263 
chronic and moderately disabling LBP from the Raine study, deficits in back 
264 
and lower limb muscle endurance were observed.4 Deficits were also 
265 
identified in adolescent rowers with LBP51 and in small group of adolescents 
266 
with disabling levels of pain.45 Reduced back muscle endurance at 14 years 
267 
was weakly predictive of LBP with impact at 17 years.57  
268 
 
269 
Together these findings support that deficits in muscle endurance may be 
270 
associated with chronic LBP as well as LBP associated with sports involving 
271 
spinal loading such as rowing, but are only weakly predictive of future 
272 
disabling LBP. These deficits are also associated with lifestyle and 
273 
psychological factors.  
274 
 
275 
Back packs 
276 
There is controversy regarding the advice that should be given for backpack 
277 
carriage in adolescents with LBP,1 with previous research reporting a 
278 
relationship between carrying a back pack and LBP.55 We investigated the 
279 
relationship of school bag carriage with back and neck pain in 14 year olds. 
280 
Perceived school bag load, duration of carriage, and method of transport to

 school were all associated with back and neck pain. However physical activity 
282 
in the form of walking or riding to school appeared to offset the potentially 
283 
provocative effects of prolonged bag carriage.23 Whether these findings 
284 
suggest that being conditioned for spinal loading may be protective of LBP 
285 
when carrying a backpack requires further investigation. 
286 
 
287 
Multi-dimensional factors and adolescent LBP – Lifestyle factors 
288 
There is a growing body of evidence for the role of lifestyle factors, such as 
289 
physical activity levels, smoking, dietary factors leading to obesity, and sleep, 
290 
have on chronic musculoskeletal pain and more specifically LBP in adult 
291 
populations.17 We have investigated a number of these lifestyle factors in 
292 
adolescent populations. 
293 
 
294 
Sports involvement 
295 
We have conducted school based research investigating LBP in adolescent 
296 
rowers and have documented a high prevalence of LBP across a rowing 
297 
season in both females and males.39 We have also identified in the Raine 
298 
Study that involvement in sport outside school at 14 years is also predictive of 
299 
LBP with impact at 17 years.57 This evidence suggests the inter-relationship 
300 
between LBP and spinal loading related to sport, findings consistent with 
301 
reports in adult populations.67 
302 
 
303 
TV watching 
304 
Although a trajectory of high levels of TV watching over childhood and 
305 
adolescence was related to poorer bone health at 20 years of age,31 the

 frequency of TV watching and of computer use at 14 years of age were not 
307 
predictive of LBP with impact at 17 years.57 
308 
 
309 
Sleep 
310 
While we have yet to investigate the role of sleep and LBP in adolescents, 
311 
there is evidence that disrupted sleep and sleep deficits are independent 
312 
predictors of LBP and neck pain in adolescent populations.5 It is thought that 
313 
the relationship is mediated though changes in pain thresholds and 
314 
inflammatory processes mediated via the neuro-immune-endocrine system.17 
315 
 
316 
Smoking and alcohol 
317 
A relationship between both alcohol consumption and smoking and LBP and 
318 
neck pain has also been identified in adolescents at 14 years, with both 
319 
behaviors strongly associated with each other and with mental health status.24 
320 
However smoking at 14 was not predictive of LBP at 17 years,21 nor was 
321 
alcohol consumption.57 
322 
 
323 
Diet 
324 
There is growing interest in the role that dietary factors may play with 
325 
musculoskeletal health. We conducted a study investigating relationships 
326 
between LBP and dietary factors (specific nutrients, broad food groups, diet 
327 
quality, and dietary pattern) and identified weak and inconsistent relationships 
328 
between some dietary factors and LBP in 14 year olds.53 These dietary 
329 
factors were not found to be predictive of LBP with impact at 17 years.57 
330 
Together this work does not support a clear relationship between LBP and

There is growing evidence that an individual’s beliefs influence their 
339 
behaviors. We investigated LBP beliefs in 17 years olds and identified that 
340 
more negative LBP beliefs (ie, back pain should be rested, back pain will stop 
341 
you working, back pain gets progressively worse with age) were associated 
342 
with greater levels of activity modification and care seeking.60 This is a similar 
343 
finding to our work in adult populations.7  Positive beliefs (the denial of 
344 
negative beliefs) were associated with female sex, lower BMI, higher family 
345 
income, better mental health scores, and more positive primary caregiver LBP 
346 
belief scores.60 These findings highlight the multidimensional factors 
347 
associated with LBP beliefs and the relationship between negative LBP 
348 
beliefs and behaviors associated with LBP. Interestingly, 17 year olds who 
349 
experienced LBP without impact had more positive beliefs than those who 
350 
never experienced LBP at all, a pattern that has been observed in other 
351 
cohorts.60 While extrapolation is limited by the cross sectional nature of this 
352 
finding, these individuals may have greater resilience and/or the experience of 
353 
LBP without impact may help build resilience for some individuals.

 There is growing evidence for the association between psychological factors 
357 
and LBP.20 We identified that poorer mental health, defined as higher 
358 
internalizing behaviors (anxious / depressed and withdrawn) as well as 
359 
externalizing behaviors (aggressive and rule-breaking), was associated with 
360 
neck and back pain in 14 year olds.54 At 17 years we identified 4 clusters of 
361 
adolescents based on report of LBP and report of diagnosed medical 
362 
conditions / health complaints. The largest cluster presented with low 
363 
probability for LBP and comorbid health conditions (80% of the cohort). The 
364 
second cluster demonstrated a high probability of LBP and neck pain, but a 
365 
low probability of other comorbid health conditions (10%). A third cluster was 
366 
identified with an increased probability of LBP associated with greater 
367 
symptoms of internalizing behaviors of anxiety and depression (7%), a greater 
368 
proportion of whom were female. The fourth cluster demonstrated an 
369 
increased probability of LBP associated with externalizing behaviors of 
370 
aggression and rule breaking (4%), a greater proportion of whom were male. 
371 
Individuals in these later 2 clusters also had poorer general health profiles.8 
372 
Poorer mental health status and somatic complaints at 14 years was also 
373 
found to be predictive of LBP with impact at 17 years.57 These findings 
374 
suggest that for a group of adolescents, LBP is comorbid with poorer mental 
375 
health, and this group appears to carry a higher health burden. There also 
376 
appear to be some sex differences with females tending to show more 
377 
internalizing behaviors, and males externalizing behaviors, associated with 
378 
LBP. These findings support the need to screen for mental and general health 
379 
status in adolescents presenting with LBP.

 Social 
382 
We have identified that behavioral responses associated with LBP in 
383 
adolescents (such as care seeking, taking medication, and avoiding physical 
384 
activity because of LBP) are aligned to their primary carer’s reported 
385 
behavioral responses to LBP.48 These findings suggest that negative 
386 
behaviors associated with LBP are learnt within the home environment.  
387 
 
388 
We have identified that a greater number of life stress events was associated 
389 
with LBP at 14 years.48 Life stress was also associated with poorer family 
390 
functioning and lower household income.48 Having a primary carer with LBP, 
391 
poorer family functioning, and being in a lower socio-economic household at 
392 
14 years were also weakly predictive of LBP with impact at 17years.57 These 
393 
findings suggest that social learning and environmental stressors may play a 
394 
role in the development of adolescent LBP with impact. 
395 
 
396 
Multi-dimensional factors and adolescent LBP: Biological factors 
397 
There is growing evidence that genetic - environmental interactions play a role 
398 
in the development of LBP.18, 19 One of the pathways through which this 
399 
association is thought to occur is via dis-regulation of adrenergic responses to 
400 
factors such as stress, which interacts with negative environmental factors 
401 
such as poor family functioning, early life stress events, and/or poor mental 
402 
health.20 We have also identified genetic variants within this group of 
403 
adolescents independent of mental health status.56 It is thought that 
404 
polymorphisms of genes such as ADRB2 and COMT may up-regulate 
405 
adrenergic receptors resulting in some individuals being predisposed to pain

 during chronic stress and anxiety conditions.56 These findings are also 
407 
consistent with our findings of a hypo-cortisol response pattern to a social 
408 
stress test at 18 years of age, which was predictive of widespread body pain 
409 
(including LBP) at 22 years of age, in females with elevated cold pain 
410 
sensitivity.49 It is considered that altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
411 
function at 18 years of age may be related to changes in neuro-immune-
412 
endocrine function resulting in a pro-nociceptive state mediated via pro-
413 
inflammatory processes.49  
414 
 
415 
What does this epidemiological evidence tell us about adolescent LBP? 
416 
LBP is common in adolescents and for a sizable group this is associated with 
417 
a growing burden of disability and health care seeking, representing an 
418 
emerging health disorder that for many tracks into adulthood. Females carry a 
419 
greater burden of impact related to LBP. Ironically, the factors that we have 
420 
historically thought to be important predictors of LBP such as carrying school 
421 
bags, generalized joint hypermobility, scoliosis, ‘poor’ posture, and back 
422 
muscle endurance are not strong predictors of adolescent LBP with impact. 
423 
Rather, the emerging evidence suggest that the factors associated with LBP 
424 
in adolescence are complex and multi-dimensional (FIGURE 1).   
425 
 
426 
For some adolescents, LBP has no impact, is transient, and doesn’t result in 
427 
seeking care. In contrast, and of concern, for a significant group of 
428 
adolescents, LBP is disabling and linked to health care seeking. For some 
429 
adolescents LBP is associated with sporting activities linked to spinal loading 
430 
and is influenced by factors such as body posture, motor control, muscle

 conditioning, and lifestyle factors. For other adolescents, LBP is associated 
432 
with negative behaviors such as school absenteeism, activity avoidance, and 
433 
functional impairment. Adolescents in this group are associated with negative 
434 
back pain beliefs and a poorer mental health profile. Females represent the 
435 
larger majority of this group, where genetic / environmental interactions and 
436 
psychological factors are likely linked to changes in neuro-immune-endocrine 
437 
function and tissue sensitization. FIGURE 2 provides a framework for 
438 
multidimensional profiling of the adolesecents with LBP and providing 
439 
targeted management aligned to these different presentations.  
440 
 
441 
Public health implications 
442 
From a public health perspective, simplistic messages regarding the potential 
443 
hazards of carrying school bags, joint hypermobility, scoliosis, and ‘poor’ 
444 
posture cannot be justified. Rather, preventative interventions that promote 
445 
positive back pain beliefs may prove helpful to reduce the disability and 
446 
impact burden of LBP in this population, as has been shown in adult public 
447 
health initiatives.9 The early identification of at-risk groups is also warranted to 
448 
prevent the associated medicalization and disability burden. More longitudinal 
449 
research investigating causal factors for the development of disabling LBP are 
450 
required to better target interventions.  
451 
 
452 
Clinical implications 
453 
Health care seeking is common in adolescents with LBP. Yet, to date, little 
454 
clinical research has investigated management of LBP in the adolescent 
455 
population. A systematic review for physical therapy treatments of LBP in

 children and adolescents concluded that only 8 studies of limited quality had 
457 
been conducted. Interventions in these trials consisted of education, exercise, 
458 
or manual therapy or a combination of the 3. Meta-analysis showed a positive 
459 
effect for these interventions over control interventions although the low 
460 
number of studies and methodological limitations prevent definitive 
461 
conclusions to be made.10 
462 
 
463 
Based on contemporary evidence we contend that once red flags and specific 
464 
lumbar pathology are excluded, adolescents with LBP require a flexible and 
465 
targeted multidimensional approach to assessment and management 
466 
(FIGURE 2).42  A strong therapeutic relationship is considered central to this 
467 
process44 and adolescent’s primary care givers should also be included in the 
468 
management.  
469 
 
470 
Our group have investigated a cognitive functional approach to adolescent 
471 
LBP which seeks to identify the multi-dimensional factors associated with LBP 
472 
and specifically target the modifiable factors considered to drive pain, 
473 
disability, and health care seeking, specific to the individual.42 A central part of 
474 
this intervention is to dispel the myths regarding the underlying basis of LBP 
475 
while reinforcing an evidence-based understanding of the disorder (FIGURE 
476 
3). This is combined with the specific targeting of negative functional and 
477 
lifestyle behavioral responses to LBP. This approach differs from more 
478 
traditional physical therapy approaches62 in that it explicitly explores and 
479 
addresses multidimensional factors such as pain related beliefs, avoidance

 behaviors, and psychological distress, known to be important in disabling LBP 
481 
presentations.63 
482 
 
483 
We have conducted 3 controlled clinical trials37, 52, 64 (2 were school based 
484 
intervention studies) targeting adolescent rowers with LBP broadly following 
485 
the cognitive functional approach outlined below and based on successful 
486 
management for adults with LBP.65 This group was chosen as it is known to 
487 
be at risk for developing LBP.39 These brief intervention studies demonstrated 
488 
reductions in pain and disability as well as improvements in back and lower 
489 
limb endurance, while maintaining the adolescents in their sport.37, 52 There 
490 
was also evidence in 1 study of improvements in mental health as measured 
491 
by the Child Behavior Check List.52 While we acknowledge that these studies 
492 
represent a narrow population, they provide a model for management that can 
493 
be adapted to other at risk groups. 
494 
 
495 
Cognitive functional approach 
496 
The following outlines the examination and broad management principles of 
497 
this cognitive functional approach. Three exemplar cases are presented in 
498 
FIGURE 4 to highlight the assessment and targeted management of 
499 
adolescent LBP.

501 
The interview involves the clinician listening to the adolescent’s story and 
502 
concerns as well as that of their primary carer, while exploring:

levels of disability and pain responses to functional activities

-

510 
conditions 
511 
The use of multidimensional screening questionnaires is recommended to 
512 
support this process.25, 29 
513 
 
514 
The physical examination considers the interplay between LBP experience 
515 
and spinal posture, loading, and levels of muscle conditioning. Identification of 
516 
pain related postural and/or movement biases (flexion or extension) and 
517 
conditioning deficits associated with pain provocative activities linked to their 
518 
goals is part of this process. This examination specifically focuses on the 
519 
examination of painful, feared, and avoided activities.37, 42, 65  
520 
 
521 
Based on findings of the interview and examination, modifiable factors are 
522 
identified and targeted under 3 broad areas37, 42, 65. 
523 
1. Education:  
524 
Education, via explanation, reflective questioning, as well as 
525 
experiential learning, reinforcing positive back pain beliefs is central to 
526 
the management of adolescent LBP.42 This includes that LBP doesn't 
527 
mean the spine is damaged, rather it reflects sensitization of spinal 
528 
structures relating to various bio-psycho-social factors relevant to the

 individual as identified in the interview and examination. This reinforces 
530 
that postural variability, spinal movement, and loading is safe and 
531 
important for spinal health. Collaborative goal setting is important to 
532 
build confidence to stay engaged in activities of daily living, physical 
533 
activity, school, and work.  
534 
2. Functional restoration:  
535 
Where LBP is provoked by functional or sports related activities, 
536 
graduated conditioning specific to these tasks while enhancing greater 
537 
postural variability in relation to the individual’s presentation, aims to 
538 
enhance pain control and confidence during these tasks. For example, 
539 
where LBP is associated with sensitization to extension movements 
540 
and postures, enhancing postural and movement variability to reduce 
541 
extension loading is taught (ie, reduce lordosis in sitting, bending, and 
542 
loading).13 The opposite is the case for flexion sensitization.65 Where 
543 
LBP is associated with avoidance of functional activities, building 
544 
confidence to gradually engage in these activities in a relaxed and 
545 
variable manner is stressed.  
546 
3. Healthy lifestyle:  
547 
Engaging in positive lifestyle behaviors such as healthy sleep habits, 
548 
regular physical activity, and balanced diet is important for general, 
549 
spine, and bone health and is encouraged and coached. 
550 
 
551 
In this process reliance on passive therapies should be avoided, so that the 
552 
person can build self-management strategies. Multi-disciplinary referral may 
553 
be required in situations where pain is disabling, distressing, and associated

 with high-levels of depressed mood, anxiety, social stress, and school

absenteeism.

557 
Conclusion 
558 
LBP is an important emergent health disorder in adolescence that for many 
559 
sets a trajectory into adulthood. It is often associated with health care seeking 
560 
and disability. Its presentation is complex and multi-dimensional. Health care 
561 
providers have an important responsibility not to reinforce unhelpful beliefs 
562 
and behaviors associated with LBP. Interventions that reinforce positive back 
563 
pain beliefs, functional restoration, and a healthy lifestyle hold promise to 
564 
reduce the disability burden of this disorder. Future research is required to 
565 
identify causal mechanisms for pain related disability, as well as interventions 
566 
that target vulnerable adolescents so as to prevent disability.

 FIGURE 3. Unhelpful and helpful health messages about low back pain for 
adolescents 
 
Unhelpful health messages 
about LBP 
 
Helpful health messages about 
LBP 
LBP means something is seriously 
wrong, damaged or out of place 
 
When the spine is too mobile it can 
lead to chronic LBP 
 
Scoliosis causes LBP 
 
Poor posture such as slump sitting is 
the cause of LBP 
 
Physical activity and carrying school 
bags should be avoided if painful 
 
With LBP the spine should be rested 
and school avoided 
 
LBP is rarely associated with serious 
pathology or structural damage.  
 
LBP is influenced by many things 
such as your: activity levels, sleep 
patterns, mood, worries, response to 
stress, habitual body postures and 
levels of conditioning 
 
While there is no ideal posture 
varying your posture is helpful 
 
Rest, avoidance of activity and taking 
time off school is usually not helpful 
for LBP 
 
Regular physical activity, maintaining 
a positive mindset about LBP, good 
sleep patterns, maintaining a healthy 
weight and learning to handle stress 
is good for LBP 
 
If your back hurts carrying a backpack 
or playing sport - get your back strong 
and conditioned so it will handle loads 
better

Case 1 
Case 2 
Case 3 
Interview 
History 
14 year old female presents with a 3 
month history of intermittent 
localized low back pain (LBP) 
associated with sitting, lifting, and 
rowing. She reports that she copes 
well, has a good mood, continues to 
row and go to school, but is worried 
she might damage her spine if she 
continues to row. She rated low risk 
on the Orebro screening tool. 
15 year old male presents with a history of 12 
months persistent and episodic localized LBP, 
exacerbated with sporting activities 
(basketball), sitting, standing, and lifting. He 
reports his pain developed insidiously. He 
reports short term pain relief from massage 
and manual therapy. He regularly takes non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to 
manage his pain. He has been avoiding 
physical activity and sport due to pain. He 
scored moderate risk on the Orebro screening 
tool. 
16 year old female with widespread 
persistent back and neck pain of insidious 
onset. Her pain is constant and 
distressing. She avoids physical activity, 
reports disrupted sleep, has low mood, 
and regularly takes time off school due to 
pain. She is socially isolated and spends 
hours on her computer. She reports that 
her parents are in the middle of a divorce 
and she is estranged from her father. She 
reports no relief from physical therapy and 
has been given a diagnosis of 
‘hypermobility syndrome’ by a medical 
doctor and has been given postural 
exercises, which she reports does not 
help her. She has strong beliefs that the 
presence of pain means that she needs to 
rest and avoid physical activity. She 
frequently takes analgesics to manage her 
pain and sleep. She rated high risk on the 
Orebro screening tool.

Education 
Explain that pain does not equal 
damage, that rowing is safe and the 
spine is resilient. 
Highlight the importance of excellent 
body conditioning with high and 
repeated loading activities as well as 
postural variability with sitting and 
spinal loading. 
Explain that the combination of: negative 
beliefs, anxiety, poor sleep, fear of movement, 
and activity feeds a vicious cycle of protective 
muscle guarding, disability, and pain 
sensitization. 
Explain that pain does not equal damage, that 
spinal flexion and physical activity is safe and 
the spine is resilient. This was reinforced by 
experiential learning that adopting these 
postures in-fact reduced the pain experience. 
 
Explain that pain is associated with 
widespread sensitization linked to a 
combination of life stress, depressed 
mood, anxiety, lack of sleep. and 
inactivity. 
Reassurance that joint hypermobility 
does not explain her pain and that 
activity and social engagement and 
health lifestyle habits are important. 
Psychological referral. 
Functional 
restoration 
 
Postural control strategies in sitting 
and lifting to reduce lumbar flexion. 
Graduated conditioning program 
directed towards the lower limbs and 
back muscles 
Static and dynamic squats and 
lunges progressed to loading with 
hand weights.  
Teach relaxation of spinal postures (to reduce 
lumbar extension) in sitting, bending, and 
lifting. 
Conditioning exercises for the lower limbs. 
Graduated return to physical and sporting 
activity based on his preference. 
Graduated conditioning and functional 
activation program linked to her activity 
preference (walking the dog each day). 
Lifestyle change 
Focus on sleep hygiene. 
Focus on sleep hygiene, body relaxation. and 
regular physical activity. 
Sleep habits - minimum of 8 hours per 
night, regular sleep time. 
Daily physical activity and participation 
in physical activity at school. 
Social engagement. 
 
Outcome 
 
 
 
Pain reduction related to sitting, 
lifting, and rowing. 
Reduced pain and disability as well as a 
return to physical engagement.  
Off medication. 
Reduced pain and disability occurred 
gradually over time as she regained her 
sleep, physical activation, and social 
engagement. 
This process occurred in conjunction 
with support from a clinical psychologist 
and her mother.
