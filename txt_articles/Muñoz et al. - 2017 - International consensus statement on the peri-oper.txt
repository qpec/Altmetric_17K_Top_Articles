Summary
Despite current recommendations on the management of pre-operative anaemia, there is no pragmatic guidance for
the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients. A number of experienced
researchers and clinicians took part in an expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After
presentation of our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed
and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with
respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the peri-operative period. These statements include: a diagnostic approach
for anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients; identification of patients appropriate for treatment; and advice
on practical management and follow-up. We urge anaesthetists and peri-operative physicians to embrace these rec-
ommendations, and hospital administrators to enable implementation of these concepts by allocating adequate
resources.

Recommendations for best clinical
practice
1
Physicians should consider pre-operative anaemia
and iron deficiency as an indication for a peri-
operative care pathway that stretches from the
decision to operate until complete recovery from
surgery.
2
The presence of anaemia should be investigated in
all surgical procedures with expected moderate-to-
high blood loss (> 500 ml).
3
Serum ferritin level < 30 lg.l�1 is the most sensi-
tive and specific test used for the identification of
absolute iron deficiency. However, in the presence
of inflammation (C-reactive protein > 5 mg.l�1)
and/or transferrin saturation < 20%, a serum fer-
ritin level < 100 lg.l�1 is indicative of iron defi-
ciency.
4
Major, non-urgent surgery should be postponed to
allow the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia and
iron deficiency.
5
When treating anaemia pre-operatively, the target
haemoglobin concentration should be ≥ 130 g.l�1
in both sexes, to minimise the risk of transfusion-
associated unfavourable outcomes
6
Oral
iron
replacement
should
be
targeted
to
patients with iron deficiency with or without anae-
mia whose surgery is scheduled 6–8 weeks after
diagnosis, preferably by the primary care physician
(General Practitioner).
7
Daily (40–60 mg) or alternate-day (80–100 mg)
treatment with oral iron and nutritional advice
should be initiated immediately in patients with
iron deficiency and no contra-indications.
8
Sufficient data exist to support intravenous iron as
efficacious and safe. Intravenous iron should be
used as front-line therapy in patients who do not
respond to oral iron or are not able to tolerate it,
or if surgery is planned for < 6 weeks after the
diagnosis of iron deficiency.
9
The diagnosis and treatment of anaemia and iron
deficiency should commence as early as possible
in the peri-operative period, and ideally as soon as
the decision to undertake surgery is made.
Why was this consensus statement
developed?
Several guidelines for the management of peri-opera-
tive anaemia have been published over the last decade
[1–11]. However, for anaemia and iron deficiency in
adult surgical patients, there are a number of non-
evidence based misconceptions regarding prevalence,
consequences, diagnosis and treatment, as well as
inconsistency of terminology and lack of clear guid-
ance
on
clinical
pathways.
Throughout
surgical
practice,
there
has
been
increased
emphasis
on
speed to operation, and many pre-assessment clinics
focus on the ability to facilitate same-day hospital
admissions, which may overlook potential opportu-
nities to optimise patients, and improve fitness for
surgery.
How does this consensus statement
differ from other available guidelines?
There are a number of guidelines from professional
associations recommending ‘what to do’ [1–11]. The
aim of this document is to utilise the recommenda-
tions therein, and provide a working practice docu-
ment on ‘how to’ feasibly introduce these guidelines
into clinical practice; or better stated, how to do it.
Therefore, our goal is to provide independent, collec-
tive guidance and a pragmatic, clear clinical pathway
for the diagnosis and treatment of peri-operative iron
deficiency and anaemia in adult surgical patients, in
order to improve outcomes in a cost-effective manner.
Iron deficiency

deficiency, even in industrialised countries, and affects

 approximately two billion people worldwide [12, 13].
Iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, is associated
with chronic conditions such as cancer (43% across
different tumours), inflammatory bowel disease (45%),
chronic kidney disease (24–85%), chronic heart failure
(43–100%) and other chronic inflammatory diseases
[14].
Apart from its well-recognised role in erythro-
poiesis, iron is also a critical component in many
important cellular processes such as oxygen transport,
electron transfer reactions, mitochondrial respiration,
gene regulation and cellular immunity [15, 16]. Func-
tional iron deficiency in critically ill patients is associ-
ated
with
an
increased
duration
of
systemic
inflammatory response syndrome and prolonged ICU
stay [17]. In congestive heart failure, iron deficiency
has been independently associated with compromised
physical performance and quality of life [18], as well
as an increase in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
[19]. Treatment of iron deficiency with i.v. iron may
improve functional status within 4 weeks, which has
been shown to be maintained after 24 and 52 weeks
[20, 21].
Importantly, in a large series of non-cardiac surgi-
cal patients (n = 2115; 48% women), the prevalence of
anaemia was 34%, and absolute iron deficiency and
iron sequestration (see below) was responsible for 75%
of the cases of anaemia (541/715) [22]. In addition,
before major orthopaedic or abdominal surgery, low
ferritin levels have been associated with increased rates
of postoperative infections [23, 24].
For a 70-kg man, total body iron is about
3500 mg (50 mg.kg�1 body weight). Most of the iron
in the body is distributed in haemoglobin (Hb)
within red blood cell (65%; 2300 mg). Approximately
10% is found in muscle fibres (in myoglobin) and
other
tissues
(in
enzymes
and
cytochromes)
(350 mg). The remaining iron is stored in the liver,
macrophages and bone marrow (850 mg) [25]. The
amount of iron required for the daily production of
300 billion red blood cells (20–30 mg) is provided
mainly by macrophages recycling iron from senescent
red blood cells (RBC), while daily iron absorption
(1–2 mg)
balances
daily
losses.
Increased
iron
requirements, limited external supply and increased
blood loss may lead to progressive iron deficiency
and,
subsequently,
iron
deficiency
anaemia
[25]
(Table 1). Thus, different types (stages) of iron defi-
ciency are found in surgical patients (Table 2), classi-
fied as follows:
•
Inadequate (low) iron stores; this refers to the body’s
inability to sustain erythropoiesis to recover from
blood loss at operation. This may be indicated by the
serum ferritin level; in a healthy adult, 1 ng.l�1 fer-
ritin reflects approximately 8 mg stored iron [26].
As an example, a patient with a pre-operative ferritin
< 100 ng.l�1 may not have enough iron reserves to
recover from a 30–40 g.l�1 Hb drop, while main-
taining normal iron stores (ferritin > 30 ng.l�1).
•
True (absolute) iron deficiency without anaemia
refers to a reduction in total body iron with normal
Hb, as levels of erythroid iron are still sufficient for
erythropoiesis. This condition is often seen in
women of child-bearing age.
•
Iron deficiency anaemia refers to a more severe
condition in which decreased iron stores result in
decreased Hb and usually microcytic hypochromic
red cells (mean corpuscular volume < 80 fl; mean
corpuscular haemoglobin < 27 pg). The corrected

 reticulocyte count provides an estimate of the rate
of effective marrow production compared with nor-
mal (set as a production index of 1). A production
index greater than 2 is not compatible with iron
deficiency anaemia.
•
Functional iron deficiency: this refers to insufficient
mobilisation of iron from stores due to increased
demands, in the presence of normal or elevated
iron stores. It is clearly defined in renal patients
following treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents [15].
•
Iron sequestration: this refers to decreased iron
mobilisation from the stores in the liver and the
macrophages to meet daily bone marrow require-
ments. This is caused by inflammation, which up-
regulates
hepatic
hepcidin
synthesis
and
may
decrease the synthesis and activity of erythropoetin.
Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, the only known
iron-exporting protein in humans, and promotes
its internalisation and degradation, resulting in
inhibition of intestinal iron absorption and iron
sequestration
at
liver
and
macrophages
[25]
(Fig. 1). This may evolve to true iron deficiency in
patients
with
inflammation
and
chronic
blood
losses.
Diagnosis of iron deficiency
Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are
commonly used for an initial evaluation of iron sta-
tus. Serum ferritin level is the most widely-used test
for evaluating iron stores, while TSAT reflects iron
availability for erythropoiesis (TSAT < 20% indicates
insufficient iron supply to support normal erythro-
poiesis). C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of
inflammation which is useful when iron-restricted
erythropoiesis due to iron sequestration is suspected
[25, 26]. Thus:
•
A serum ferritin level < 30 lg.l�1 is the most sensi-
tive (92%) and specific (98%) cut-off level for the
identification of true iron deficiency (with or with-
out anaemia); no further laboratory work-up is
needed (Fig. 2) [15, 25, 27].

 •
In the presence of inflammation (CRP > 5 mg.l�1),
and/or TSAT < 20%, ferritin < 100 lg.l�1 strongly
suggests iron deficiency (see below) (Fig. 2). It also
indicates inadequate iron stores for surgery during
which moderate-to-high blood loss is expected.
•
In contrast, TSAT < 20% and ferritin > 100 lg.l�1
usually indicates iron sequestration, as seen in
inflammatory
conditions
(CRP
> 5 mg.l�1),
or
functional iron deficiency, as seen during treatment
with
erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents
(Table 1;
Fig. 2) [25].
However, although ferritin values > 100 lg.l�1
argue against concurrent true iron deficiency in the
setting of inflammation, due to its acute phase reactiv-
ity, its diagnostic value is imperfect. Other tests, such
as low reticulocyte Hb content (CHr < 28 pg) or an
increase in hypochromic red cells (Hypo > 5%), can
be utilised to evaluate for a component of iron defi-
ciency, which if present suggests iron supplementation
may be beneficial [25, 28]. The ratio of serum transfer-
rin receptor level to the log of ferritin (sTfr/log Ft),
the so-called ferritin index, may be used when these
automated red cell parameters are not routinely avail-
able [25, 28]. A ferritin index > 2 indicates true iron
deficiency, and is a strong predictor of response to i.v.
iron [28, 29]. Detailed information regarding the
advantages, disadvantages, limitations and diagnostic
values of these parameters can be found elsewhere
[30].
Anaemia
Anaemia is defined by the World Health Organization
as
an
Hb
concentration
< 130 g.l�1
for
men,
< 120 g.l�1 for non-pregnant women and < 110 g.l�1
for pregnant women [31]. These definitions are widely
quoted and accepted, and are used in most epidemio-
logical studies. They are also adopted in most blood
conservation guidelines, where no further laboratory
work-up
is
deemed
necessary
for
non-anaemic
patients.
However, we consider that this may not be reliable
for the classification of non-pregnant women undergo-
ing surgical procedures in which moderate-to-high
blood loss is expected. Women have lower circulating
blood volumes than men, but the same procedures
performed in either sex often result in comparable
amounts of blood loss. Therefore, when measured as a
proportion of circulating blood volume, blood losses
are proportionally higher in women and may result in
higher transfusion rates, as corroborated by a study in
orthopaedic surgery [32] and the first Austrian bench-
mark study [33]. As women with a pre-operative Hb
of 120 g.l�1 are twice as likely to require a transfusion
as men with an Hb of 130 g.l�1, this Hb level should
be considered as suboptimal in surgical settings. In

 cardiac surgery, a 10 g.l�1 decrease in Hb has been
shown to be independently associated with increased
transfusion requirements, increased mortality and pro-
longed hospital stay [34].
Consequently,
apart
from
replenishing
iron
stores,
pre-operative
treatment
of
iron
deficiency
anaemia should be aimed at producing a target Hb
level ≥ 130 g.l�1 in both sexes, to minimise the risk
of transfusion-associated unfavourable outcomes [35].
Patients who are anaemic and require major sur-
gery (including the obstetrics and gynaecology popula-
tion),
especially
if
moderate
to
high
blood
loss
(> 500 ml) is likely and/or if there is a ≥ 10% statisti-
cal probability for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion,
should be investigated (Fig 3). Laboratory investiga-
tions should be performed as early as possible in the
pre-operative period in order to implement the most
appropriate treatment, if needed. They should initially
include at least full blood count, serum ferritin, TSAT,
a marker of inflammation (e.g. serum CRP) and a
marker of renal function (e.g. serum creatinine), which
can be easily requested by a surgeon (at the time of
listing for surgery), an anaesthetist (during the pre-
anaesthesia assessment) or a primary care physician/
general practitioner. In some hospitals, there is also
the possibility of automatically ordering additional lab-
oratory tests when an Hb < 130 g.l�1 is detected by
pre-operative analysis.
Intervening to treat pre-operative iron deficiency
anaemia in the surgical patient can be expected to
reduce the number of transfusions given and thereby
improve outcomes, even in those for whose anaemia,
surgery is the cure. There is good evidence that
attempts to correct iron deficiency anaemia pre-opera-
tively will improve Hb before surgery, but there is little
good quality evidence that it can modify the excess of
risk for postoperative complications, other than those
associated
with
transfusion
[28,
36–42].
However,
moderate to severe anaemia (Hb < 110 g.l�1) results
in worse outcomes than milder anaemia [43]. In con-
trast, there is also good evidence that correcting anae-
mia by transfusing blood can be detrimental to the
outcomes of surgery [37, 44, 45].
Despite
the
lack
of
level-one
evidence
for
improved outcomes, it is still recommended as good
clinical practice to treat all surgical patients with pre-
operative iron deficiency anaemia, but with a particular
emphasis on treating those undergoing major surgery.
Patients undergoing more minor surgical procedures
are unlikely to see wide fluctuations in Hb postopera-
tively, and surgery can proceed while anaemia evalua-
tion and treatment is ongoing.
Patients who have absolute iron deficiency should
also be investigated for gastro-intestinal pathology

concentration < 270 pg.ml�1 (200 pmol.l�1)], and 3%
for folate [defined by serum concentration < 3 ng.ml�1
(5 nmol.l�1)] [46]. If none are found, other causes of
anaemia should be ruled out (Fig. 2).
Treatment
Treatment of pre-operative iron deficiency anaemia
should be implemented as early as possible before the
scheduled surgical procedure. Most major surgery is
elective. In the UK, the recent NHS Blood and Trans-
plant audit showed there was a median of 60 days
from listing the patient for surgery to the operation
itself
(http://hospital.blood.co.uk/audits/national-com-
parative-audit/). Thus, treatment of iron deficiency
anaemia should be attempted while the patient is on
the surgical waiting list, although this is currently
rarely practised [47].
Regarding oral iron, in non-anaemic iron-deficient
women, high doses of iron sulphate stimulate hepcidin
release, which results in lower iron absorption from
the next daily dose [48]. In contrast, it appears that
low-dose (≤ 60 mg) oral iron given on alternate days
may maximise fractional iron absorption, increase
dosage efficacy, reduce gastro-intestinal exposure to
unabsorbed iron and ultimately improve tolerance and
adherence
to
treatment
[48].
As
anaemia-induced
hypoxia and erythropoietin production downregulate
the expression of hepcidin [15, 25], this may counter-
balance the stimulatory effect of iron. In octogenarian
patients
with
iron
deficiency
anaemia,

or

for

both
improved Hb and ferritin levels equally, but fewer
side-effects were observed with the lower dose [49].
Therefore, when the interval before surgery is sufficient
(at least 6–8 weeks) and no contra-indications are pre-
sent, daily (40–60 mg) or alternate-day (80–100 mg)
supplementation with oral iron and nutritional advice
may be appropriate. The actual dose may depend upon
the elemental iron content of the available oral iron

 formulation, which differs depending on country of
manufacture.
However, many patients will not respond to oral
iron, especially those with functional iron deficiency
and chronic illness or infection and those with ongo-
ing blood loss [15, 25]. Others will not tolerate oral
iron due to gastro-intestinal side-effects. Once oral
iron has been commenced, the Hb should be measured
again, at least 4 weeks before surgery. In the absence
of an increased Hb or if the patient is intolerant, i.v.
iron is the preferred replacement route. If surgery is
planned in less than 6 weeks time, i.v. iron may also
be the most effective option.
Intravenous iron is highly efficacious at replenishing
iron stores and increasing Hb in anaemia due to iron
deficiency with or without inflammation (Fig. 2). The
dose of i.v. iron may be calculated from the baseline and
target Hb and patient’s body weight, adding 500 mg for
iron stores (in patients > 35 kg) [25]. In practice, a dose
of 1000–1500 mg is sufficient in most surgical patients
and can usually be given by slow infusion over less than
1 h in one sitting or in two divided doses, depending on
the preparation used. Most patients feel better in 3 days,
with a rapid Hb response (50% at 5 days, 75% at 10–
14 days, maximal at 3 weeks) [50].
In a small series, i.v. iron sucrose before orthopae-
dic surgery has been shown to be useful for treating
iron deficiency anaemia, with a maximum effect on
Hb after 2 weeks [51]. In abdominal surgery, i.v. iron

pre-operatively
[41]
has
been
shown
to
decrease RBC transfusion and hospital stay.
Intravenous iron treatment < 2 weeks pre-opera-
tively has also been shown to be successful in decreas-
ing the need for RBC transfusion, acute kidney injury,
hospital stay and infections in orthopaedic and cardiac
surgery [52, 53]. A quicker recovery in Hb postopera-
tively was also observed in iron-deficient patients trea-
ted with i.v. iron sucrose [54] or carboxymaltose [41,
42]. Administration of i.v. iron isomaltoside (1000 mg)
1 day before or even on the day of surgery can
improve postoperative Hb recovery even in non-anae-
mic patients without iron deficiency [55].
Presently, there is a lack of high-quality data about
effect on outcomes, but a number of large randomised,
controlled trials are in progress [56].
Iron deficiency without anaemia
A recent meta-analysis of 21 trials in different clinical
settings concluded that there is emerging evidence that
non-anaemic iron deficiency is a disease in its own
right, deserving of further research in the development
of strategies for detection and treatment [57]. Non-
anaemic patients with iron deficiency or inadequate
iron
stores
undergoing
surgical
procedures
with
expected moderate-to-high blood loss may benefit from
pre-operative iron administration, to boost recovery
from postoperative anaemia [1, 3] (Fig. 2). In those
with absolute iron deficiency (ferritin < 30 lg.l�1), the
need for gastro-intestinal investigations should be con-
sidered [3]. Microcytosis due to iron deficiency without
anaemia should be evaluated for chronic hypoxaemia,
myeloproliferative disease (e.g. polycythaemia rubra
vera), or another cause of increased red cell production.
Iron replacement may cause a surge in Hb that could
induce hyperviscosity in this subgroup.
In non-anaemic orthopaedic surgical patients, the
administration of iron ferrous sulphate and vitamins
during the weeks preceding surgery has been shown to
increase serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [58]
and reduce transfusion [59]. However, adherence to
iron supplementation was 67%, and adverse drug reac-
tions were present in 52% of patients [60].
In women undergoing major non-cardiac surgical
procedures, the prevalence of true iron deficiency (fer-
ritin < 30 lg.l�1) for Hb 120–129 g.l�1 was similar to
that for Hb < 120 g.l�1, and significantly higher than
for Hb ≥ 130 g.l�1 (42%, 51% and 24%, respectively;
p < 0.05). This also applies to insufficient iron supply
for erythropoiesis, as defined by TSAT < 20% (58%,
69% and 34%, respectively; p < 0.05) [22]. Thus,
although considered as non-anaemic according to
WHO definitions [31], most women with Hb 120–
129 g�l�1 would benefit from iron replacement ther-
apy, for optimising pre-operative Hb levels and facili-
tating recovery from postoperative anaemia.
For non-anaemic patients undergoing surgery with
a high risk for developing severe postoperative anaemia,
we suggest the administration of oral iron. Intravenous
iron administration (e.g. 500 mg) should be considered
if surgery is scheduled to take place in < 4 weeks or if
the patient cannot tolerate oral iron [1].

noz et al. | Peri-operative management of anaemia and iron deficiency
 Delaying surgery
As stated above, uncorrected pre-operative anaemia is
a risk factor for poor outcome [61–66]. Although there
is little evidence currently that treatment of iron defi-
ciency anaemia improves outcome [60, 67], it does
reduce transfusion and may reduce hospital stay. Con-
sequently, there
is considerable
uncertainty as to
whether surgery should be delayed in patients with
undiagnosed/untreated anaemia.
The problem may be divided into patients under-
going surgery for benign vs. malignant disease. In
major surgery for benign disease, especially when
blood loss > 500 ml is expected or possible, patients
should be informed about the relationship between
anaemia, morbidity and mortality, and should be given
the opportunity to postpone non-urgent surgery until
their anaemia is investigated and treated [4, 35]. Sev-
eral guidelines recommend postponing the operation
for about 4 weeks to allow appropriate management of
anaemia [1, 2, 4, 8].
In some European countries, the allowable time
between diagnosis and surgery for malignant disease is
subjected
to
legal
regulations.
Nevertheless,
many
receive pre-operative adjuvant therapy, which allows
sufficient time for concurrent treatment of pre-opera-
tive iron deficiency anaemia.
Postoperative anaemia
Anaemia is present in up to 90% of patients in the
immediate postoperative period after major surgery
[68]. The main causes are: presence of pre-operative
anaemia; peri-operative blood loss; poor nutritional
intake in the postoperative period; and frequent blood
sampling for laboratory tests. In addition, increased
hepcidin due to the inflammatory response to surgery
can lead to inhibition of iron absorption from the
small bowel and reduced iron release from stores (iron
sequestration) [25] (Fig. 1). These effects can last for a
few weeks after major surgery and aggravate postoper-
ative iron deficiency anaemia.
Recently, the National Institute for Clinical Excel-
lence [69] and other international guidelines [4, 5, 70]
have reduced the transfusion thresholds for surgical
patients to 70 g.l�1 (80 g.l�1 for patients with a history
of ischaemic heart disease) in the absence of active
bleeding. This change in practice has led to more
patients being discharged with significant anaemia
after major surgery. Therefore, it is important to
implement strategies for postoperative anaemia man-
agement.
Management of iron deficiency with oral iron in
the immediate postoperative period has a very limited
role due to poor absorption and considerable side-
effects, and is not recommended [4]. In contrast, i.v.
iron has been successfully used to treat iron deficiency
anaemia after surgery for lower limb arthroplasty [71],
gastrectomy [72] and postpartum haemorrhage [73].
The administration of a single 1000-mg dose of ferric
carboxymaltose
after
major
orthopaedic
surgery,
abdominal and genito-urinary surgery, and others, has
been shown to correct anaemia and improve quality of
life compared with oral iron [74, 75].
Transfused packet RBC contains haem iron (200–
250 mg per unit), plus a small amount of labile iron
which is immediately available for erythropoiesis; in
part, dependent on the storage time of the transfused
RBC unit [76]. After transfusion, the patient’s Hb is
usually < 10 g.l�1. Correcting postoperative iron defi-
ciency, in addition to RBC transfusion to raise Hb,
may be important to improve function, as shown in
animal models [77]. Further research is required as to
whether supplemental iron given to correct iron defi-
ciency in patients who are transfused peri-operatively
is beneficial in humans.
Safety of i.v. iron therapy
Currently, six i.v. iron formulations are available in the
USA and/or Europe (Table 3), and serious adverse
events (SAEs) are very rare (38 per 106 administrations;
deaths, 0.4 per 106 administrations) [78]. In contrast, the
most recent Serious Hazards of Transfusion Report in
the UK quotes the risk of death related to transfusion as
1 in 100,000, and the risk of major morbidity as 1 in
16,000 [79]. The European Medicines Agency concluded
that the benefits of i.v. iron exceed the risks when used
appropriately (correct indication and dose), without any
difference in safety profile among available formulations
[80]. In line with these recommendations, guidance for
risk minimisation and management of hypersensitivity
reactions to i.v. iron has been recently published [81].

Mu~
noz et al. | Peri-operative management of anaemia and iron deficiency
 Some patients who receive i.v. iron may exhibit
complement activation-related pseudo-allergy, which
should not be misinterpreted as hypersensitivity. This
occurs in approximately 1:200 iron-treated patients,
and can consist of arthralgia, myalgia or flushing, but
without associated hypotension, tachycardia, tachyp-
noea, wheezing, stridor or peri-orbital oedema [82].
Symptoms abate without intervention, and the patient
may be rechallenged or another i.v. iron formulation
tried [82].
A recent meta-analysis of 103 trials published
from 1965 to 2013 (including 19,253 patients) con-
cluded that i.v. iron therapy was not associated with
an increased risk of serious adverse events or infection
when compared with oral or intramuscular iron, no
iron or placebo [83]. In large observational studies,
peri-operative i.v. iron did not negatively impact on
rates of transfusion, infection and 30-day mortality in
surgical patients [51, 84]. In contrast, red cell transfu-
sion delivers haem and labile iron which supports bac-
terial growth more readily [85].
The preponderance of published evidence indi-
cates that i.v. iron is safe, supporting a greater and
earlier role for treating iron deficiency and raising the
question of whether parenteral iron should be consid-
ered for front-line therapy in conditions where oral
iron will predictably fail. However, further prospective
efficacy and safety trials in various surgical settings
are required to make evidenced-based conclusions
[82].
Cost implications of iron therapy
There are few studies that have undertaken formal
cost–benefit analysis of iron treatment. Bhandari et al.
[86] performed a comparative analysis of the costs of
administering i.v. iron formulations against RBC trans-
fusion, by considering acquisition costs plus adminis-
tration costs (nursing time and giving sets) and
transportation to hospital, across three dosage levels
(600 mg, 1000 mg and 1600 mg). At all doses, i.v. iron
resulted in a net saving when compared with RBC
transfusion, with the biggest differences observed for
ferric carboxymaltose and iron isomaltoside-1000.
Calvet et al. [87] compared the cost implications
of ferric carboxymaltose vs. iron sucrose vs. oral iron
for avoiding red cell transfusion in 282 patients with
colorectal cancer and anaemia, using cost-minimisation
analysis. Direct and indirect costs for acquisition and
administration of iron product and RBC concentrates,
as well as hospitalisation costs, were included in the
cost model. Ferric carboxymaltose reduced hospital
stay by 2.3 days compared with iron sucrose and by
2.6 days compared with oral iron, resulting in cost
savings of £437 (485€, $532) and £245 (274€, $300)
per patient, respectively.
Data from 182 matched pairs of total lower limb
arthroplasty patients, managed with a restrictive trans-
fusion protocol and without (control) or with postop-
erative i.v. iron, were retrospectively reviewed [88].
Acquisition and administration costs of iron (600 mg
iron sucrose or ferric carboxymaltose) and RBC con-
centrates, Hb, and prolonged stay in hospital were
used. Patients receiving RBC transfusion stayed in hos-
pital longer (1.9 days [95% CI 1.2–2.6]). Compared
with control, i.v. iron reduced RBC transfusion rate
(11.5% vs. 26.4%) without incremental cost [88].
Thus, the use of newer i.v. iron formulations
(e.g. iron isomaltoside 1000 or ferric carboxymaltose)
allows the rapid administration of larger single doses
(≥ 1000 mg),
and
are
more
convenient
both
for
the patient (e.g. fewer hospital visits, less time off
work) and the health system (e.g. less visits to day
hospital, less ambulance transfers, less total cost) [40,
86–89].
When comparing i.v. iron with other interven-
tions implemented to reduce blood transfusion and/
or placebo, it would be interesting to include the
costs of postoperative complications and other clini-
cal endpoints as well. Anaesthetists and surgeons
should consider pre-operative iron deficiency not as
a single ‘point’, although its treatment is essential.
Instead, this should trigger a peri-operative bundle of
care, known as Patient Blood Management, started at
the time that surgery is booked and carried on until
full
recovery
from
the
surgical
intervention
has
occurred. This should be planned and documented
pre-operatively, both in urgent and elective patients
[90–92]. We believe there is ample evidence to sup-
port
peri-operative
blood
management
within
the
context
of
an
evidence-based
enhanced
recovery
programme to secure optimal interpretation of the
intervention [93].
