ABSTRACT
Background: FebriDx is a 10-minute disposable point-of-care test designed to identify clinically
significant systemic host immune responses and aid in the differentiation of bacterial and
viral respiratory infection by simultaneously detecting C-reactive protein (CRP) and myxovirus
resistance protein A (MxA) from a fingerstick blood sample. FebriDx diagnostic accuracy was
evaluated in the emergency room and urgent care setting.
Methods: A prospective, multicentre, observational cohort study of acute upper respiratory tract
infections (URIs), with and without a confirmed fever at the time of enrolment, was performed
to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx to identify clinically significant bacterial infection
with host response and acute pathogenic viral infection. The reference method consisted of an
algorithm with physician override that included bacterial cell culture, respiratory PCR panels for
viral and atypical pathogens, procalcitonin, and white blood cell count.
Results: Among 220 patients enrolled, 100% reported fever 100.5�F within the last 72 hours
while 55% had a measured hyperthermia (T > 100.4) at the time of enrolment. FebriDx
demonstrated a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 77–100%), specificity of 94% (88–98%), PPV of 76%
(59–87%), and a NPV of 99% (93–100%).
Conclusion: FebriDx may identify clinically significant bacterial URI’s and supports outpatient
antibiotic decisions.
KEY MESSAGES
� FebriDx is an outpatient POC test designed to identify a clinically significant systemic host
immune response and aid in the differentiation of viral and bacterial infection through rapid
measurement of MxA and CRP from a fingerstick blood sample. FebriDx test was determined
to be an accurate test, with a 85% sensitivity, 93% specificity and 97% NPV to rule out
bacterial infection for any patient presenting with symptoms and reported fever within the
prior 3 days, and when confirming fever (hyperthermia) at the time of testing, the test was
even more sensitive (95%) and specific (94%) with a 99% NPV. FebriDx may support antibiotic
stewardship by rapidly identifying clinically significant bacterial URIs.

Introduction
Acute upper respiratory infection (URI), which includes
rhinosinusitis,
pharyngitis,
the
common
cold,
and
acute uncomplicated bronchitis are the most common
reasons
for
acute
outpatient
physician
visits
and
antibiotic prescription in adults in the United States
[1]. Forty-one million adult ambulatory care visits result
in an antibiotic prescription, of which 50% may be
unnecessary [1]. Approximately 5 to 25% of patients
who use antibiotics have adverse events, and about 1
in 1000 has a serious adverse event [2]. Antibiotic
adverse events are responsible for 1 of every 5 visits
to emergency departments for drug-related events [3].
Antibiotic overuse leads to antibiotic resistance, anti-
biotic-associated
infections,
increased
costs,

 adverse events, ranging in severity from mild (e.g.
diarrhoea
and
rash)
to
life-threatening
(e.g.
Stevens–Johnson
syndrome
and
anaphylaxis)
[4].
Clostridium
difficile
diarrhoea,
usually
a
result
of
antibiotic treatment, is reported to cause 500,000 infec-
tions and 29,300 deaths in the United States annually,
leading to an estimated $1 billion in extra medical costs
[5]. Inpatient antibiotic stewardship programs focus on
guiding appropriate antibiotic use when adequate evi-
dence for bacterial infection exists [6]. The vast majority
of patients with acute URI present to primary and
urgent care clinics in the outpatient setting, where rapid
diagnostic tests to assist clinicians in the identification
of bacterial respiratory infections are lacking and has
hindered antibiotic stewardship efforts [7].
FebriDxV
R (RPS Diagnostics; Sarasota, FL) is a novel,
single use disposable point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test
designed to rapidly identify clinically significant host
immune responses associated with bacterial and viral
URIs and to assist with antibiotic prescribing decisions
[8–10]. Within 10 minutes, FebriDx provides qualitative
results for elevated serum levels of c-reactive protein
(CRP) and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) [8,10].
CRP is an acute phase reactant that when elevated
above 20 mg/L, is suggestive of a clinically significant
infection, although it cannot differentiate viral or bacter-
ial aetiology independently [11]. MxA is a derivative of
interferon type I a/b and associated with the presence
of a viral infection [12]. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the FebriDx test for
identifying immune responses associated with bacterial
and viral URIs in patients with acute URI symptoms.
Methods
Design and URI study population
A
prospective,
cross-sectional,
observational
study
using a convenience sample of patients reporting a
history of fever within the preceding 72 hours and
presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of a URI
was performed. Children and adults were enrolled
between November 2015 and July 2016 at 10 clinical
sites in the United States, including seven academic
emergency departments, two community urgent care
centres, and 1 ambulatory clinical research site. Similar
to a previous study by Self et al. inclusion criteria
included:
age
>1
year,
exhibited
or
reported
fever � 100.5 �F within the past 3 days, and new onset
of cough or sore throat within the past 7 days. Major
exclusion criteria included use of antibiotics, antiviral
agents, interferon therapy, immunosuppressive therapy
or a live viral immunization within the past 30 days [8].
The study was approved by the governing institutional
review
board
for
each
enrolling
centre.
Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant
or their legal authorized representative, as appropriate.
FebriDx measurements
Each patient underwent testing with FebriDx, which is
a rapid, qualitative, single-use, disposable, whole blood
immunoassay with a turn-around time of 10 minutes
[8]. FebriDx requires a fingerstick to obtain a 5 lL
whole blood sample and provides a qualitative result
for
elevated
levels
of
CRP
(� 20 mg/L)
and
MxA
(� 40 ng/ml)
without
any
sample
processing
or
accessory reader equipment. FebriDx results indicating
elevated CRP without an associated elevated MxA
were interpreted as a bacterial infection. FebriDx
results indicating an elevated MxA with or without an
associated elevated CRP were interpreted as a viral
infection. Valid tests showing no elevated CRP or MxA
were interpreted as negative.
Study personnel at the site obtained a whole blood
sample by finger stick, performed FebriDx testing
according to the manufacturer’s instructions [13], and
interpreted the results as bacterial, viral or negative.
FebriDx results were not used for clinical care and all
personnel performing FebriDx testing were blinded to
all reference testing outlined below.
Outcome
Joseph et al. describe key criteria for an acute respira-
tory infection comparator method designed to assist
with the differentiation of clinically significant acute
respiratory infections from probable colonization [11].
The current study incorporated a clinical algorithm
that incorporates the Joseph criteria [11] and demon-
strated a high level of expert physician agreement in a
previous study [8]. Additionally, this study utilizes a
respiratory viral and atypical bacterial PCR panel;
oropharyngeal swabs sent for plating on routine blood
agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar; and labora-
tory analysis [8]. Compared to the previous algorithm
described by Self et al, PCR testing for Fusobacterium
necrophorum and Neisseria gonorrhoea were included
and
herpes
simplex
and
cytomegalovirus
PCR
removed. The clinical algorithm results were reviewed
on a patient by patient basis by a physician panel,
with
over-reading
capability
to
ensure
clinical
accuracy. There were three potential outcomes: acute
bacterial infection with host response, acute patho-
genic viral infection, and a valid negative test consist-
ent with a microbiologically unconfirmed respiratory

 illness (MURI) [8,10]. Procalcitonin (PCT) and white
blood cell (WBC) count inclusive of lymphocytosis and
bandaemia were used in the reference standard to
identify and support the presence of a host response
[11,14,15]. Viruses that are typically pathogenic when
detected in the upper respiratory tract, such as influ-
enza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus
and metapneumovirus were classified as an acute viral
infection [16–19]. Meanwhile, viruses that are com-
monly found in the respiratory tract without causing
symptoms, such as rhinovirus or coranavirus [16,18,19],
were only considered pathogenic in patients with
negative bacterial cultures who demonstrated the
presence of an immune response such as an elevated
WBC, elevated PCT, lymphocytosis, or bandaemia.
Reference testing algorithm
Each patient underwent the following diagnostic tests:
(1)
throat
swab
bacterial
culture
was
performed
consisting of an EswabTM (Copan) that was inoculated
on routine blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey
agar, incubated at 35–37 �C for 18–24 h before read-
ing, and allowed for an additional 24-h incubation
overnight at room temperature for plates that yield
negative results at 24 hours; (2) multiplex polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) of a combined nasopharyngeal
and
oropharyngeal
(NP/OP)
sample
using
the
FilmArrayV
R Respiratory Panel (BioMerieux, Inc.; Marcy-
l’Etoile, France) [20] underwent validation to accom-
modate oropharyngeal swabs; (3) real-time reverse
transcriptase PCR of an NP/OP sample for Epstein–Barr
virus (EBV), a validated PCR-based LDT using ASR
(Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL) was used to test
for
Fusobacterium
necrophorum,
and
a
PCR-based
target amplification nucleic acid probe test called the
APTIMA Combo #2 Assay on the PANTHER System was
used
to
test
for
Neisseria
Gonorrhea/Chlamydia
Trachomatis after completing a validation for respira-
tory samples; (4) EBV IgM serum antibody with the
ImmunosimplicityV
R IS-EBV-VCA IgM Test Kit (Diamedix
Co; Miami Lakes, FL) [21]; (5) serum PCT concentration
measurement
with
the
BRAHMS
PCT
KRYPTOR
Analyzer (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, MA) [22]; and
(6) WBC count with band differential percentage.
A central laboratory performed all reference testing
that was blinded to patients, treating clinicians, and
study personnel who performed FebriDx testing.
The reference testing algorithm classified patients
as having a bacterial infection if any of the following 5
criteria were met: (1) throat culture positive for a bac-
teria that commonly causes pharyngitis (Group A, C, G
beta hemolytic Streptococci, N gonorrhoeae, C. diphtheria, A.
haemolyticum) with a Centor Criteria� 2 plus PCT� 0.1ng/
ml; (2) throat culture positive for any other bacteria
plus PCT � 0.25 ng/ml or PCT � 0.15 ng/ml plus WBC �
12,000 cells/mcL; (3) NP/OP sample PCR positive for
atypical bacteria (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, B.
pertussis) or F. necrophorum plus PCT � 0.1 ng/ml; (4)
PCT � 0.25 ng/ml
plus
no
identified
pathogen;
(5)
PCT � 0.15 ng/ml plus WBC � 15,000 cells/mcL or the
presence of WBC bands plus no identified pathogen
[23–27]. Meanwhile, the reference testing algorithm
classified patients as having a viral infection if any of
the following four criteria were met: (1) NP/OP sample
PCR positive for influenza A or B, adenovirus, respira-
tory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, or
parainfluenza viruses 1–4; (2) NP/OP sample PCR posi-
tive for rhinovirus or coronavirus plus PCT � 0.1ng/ml,
WBC � 10,000 cells/mcL, lymphocytosis � 4000, or the
presence of bands (3) NP/OP sample PCR positive for
EBV plus serum IgM positive for EBV; (4) PCT between
0.15 ng/ml and 0.25 ng/ml plus WBC <15,000 cells/mcL
plus no WBC bands plus no identified pathogen [8,11].
If a patient met criteria for both a viral and bacterial
infection, the patient was classified as bacterial. If both
a viral and a common bacterial pathogen (see point
(1) above) were microbiologically confirmed in a single
subject, the subject was provisionally characterized as
a bacterial infection if the subject was also associated
with 0.1 ng/ml � PCT �0.25 ng/ml and moderate to
significant bacterial growth. Alternatively, if both a
viral and a common bacterial pathogen (see point (1)
above) were microbiologically confirmed in a single
subject and were associated with rare to low bacterial
growth, the bacteria was deemed colonizing, and the
patient characterized as viral. If the PCT � 0.25 ng/ml, it
was deemed bacterial regardless of the amount of
growth on routine blood agar, chocolate agar and
MacConkey agar. If both a viral and any bacterial
pathogen were microbiologically confirmed in a single
subject, the subject was provisionally characterized as
bacterial if the PCT � 0.75 ng/ml regardless of WBC.
Otherwise, the patient was characterized as a viral
infection. Patients who did not meet any of these cri-
teria for bacterial or viral infection were classified as
negative by the reference testing algorithm.
Physician panel over-read
Two
expert
physicians
in
respiratory
infections
reviewed each case in detail and were blinded to the
FebriDx results. The reviews included verification of
the reference testing algorithm classification (bacterial,
viral or negative) as a guideline, but also included a
review
of
all
clinical
and
laboratory
information

 available from the study case report form including
the
demographics,
patient
history,
presenting
symptoms and signs, comorbidities, results from throat
culture, molecular respiratory pathogen panels, and
the following blood tests: CBC including WBC and a
differential with bands and lymphocytes, procalcitonin,
Epstein–Barr virus IgM/IgM as well as additional stand-
ard of care tests performed including rapid flu and
rapid strep tests. Following the review, the physicians
developed a classification of bacterial, viral or negative.
This physician over-read could lead to reclassification
compared to the initial classification from the algo-
rithm. Thus, the final reference standard classification
(bacterial, viral or negative) consisted of an algorithm-
guided consensus decision.
Statistical analysis
Diagnostic accuracy was calculated by comparing the
FebriDx result to the reference standard diagnosis.
Primary analysis of diagnostic accuracy was based on
Sensitivity (TP/P) and Specificity (TN/N), where P, N, TP
and
TN
correspond
to
positives,
negatives,
true
positives and true negatives, respectively. Additional
measures
of
accuracy
were
calculated
including
Positive
predictive
value
(PPV ¼ TP/[TP þ FP])
and
Negative predictive value (NPV ¼ TN/[TN þ FN]. Initially,
FebriDx and reference standard results were analysed
using a three-category classification scheme (bacterial
vs. viral vs. negative). FebriDx accuracy for bacterial
and viral detections were also evaluated in two-
category
classification
schemes
(bacterial
vs.
not
bacterial, and viral vs. not viral). Sensitivity, specificity
and positive and negative predictive values were
separately calculated for bacterial and viral detection.
Confidence
intervals
for
sensitivity,
specificity
and
predictive values were calculated using the binomial
exact method.
Results
URI study population
During the study period, 223 febrile URI patients were
enrolled. All enrolled URI patients underwent FebriDx
testing and had a valid FebriDx result. Two patients
(0.9%) did not have adequate testing for the reference
standard and were excluded, and one patient had an
invalid FebriDx test resulting in a final population of
220 URI patients for analysis. These patients were
excluded prior to analysis. This population included 13
(5%) children <18 years old and 207 (95%) adults
(Table 1). Among 220 patients enrolled that reported
fever � 100.5 within the last 72 hours, 121 (55%) had a
confirmed fever (observed hyperthermia) at the time
of enrolment.
Reference standard results
Application of the reference standard, including the
reference
testing
algorithm
followed
by
physician
panel over-read, was used to classify patients. Of the
total enrolled patients, 15% (34/220) were classified as
bacterial, 56% (124/220) were classified as viral and
28% (62/220) negative by the reference standard. The
physician panel agreed with classification assigned by
the algorithm in 99% (219/220) of the cases. One
patient that was rhinovirus positive by PCR with an
associated PCT of 2.34 ng/ml and 6% bands, was
reclassified by the physician panel as more likely a
bacterial infection.
Of 124 patients with a microbiologically confirmed
viral infection, 29 (23%) had PCT >0.1 ng/ml, 11 (9%)
had PCT � 0.25 ng/ml and 56% had a CRP � 20 mg/L.
Overall, the most common pathogens were influenza
A (n ¼ 60), Influenza B (n ¼ 20) and GABHS (n ¼ 13)
(Table 2).
Diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx
For patients reporting fever in the last 72 hours and
representing the full study patient population, when
classifying results as bacterial versus not bacterial,
overall agreement was 92% (95% CI: 88–95%). FebriDx
demonstrated a sensitivity of 85% (69–95%), specificity
of 93% (89–96%), positive predictive value (PPV) of
69% (56–79%), and a negative predictive value of 97%
(94–99%). For viral detection in patients reporting
fever in the last 72 hours, when classifying results as
viral versus not viral, overall agreement was 87%

Discussion
In the current clinical study, we sought to evaluate the
accuracy of FebriDx for identifying clinically-significant
acute bacterial and viral URIs in patients presenting
with
and
without
confirmed
fever
(measured
hyperthermia) at the time of enrolment. Of the 220
outpatients enrolled, 55% presented with confirmed
hyperthermia
at
the
time
of
testing
while
45%
presented with a reported history of fever within the
prior 72 hours but no documented hyperthermia at
the enrolling healthcare facility. FebriDx sensitivity for
bacterial pathogens was higher in the population with
confirmed fever (95%) compared with the full popula-
tion
(85%). In a previous prospective
multicentre
clinical trial, FebriDx revealed a bacterial sensitivity of
80%, and specificity of 93%; however, only 13% of the
patients had a fever at the time of enrolment, possibly
accounting for the lower sensitivity in the prior study
[8]. Most importantly, the FebriDx test was found to
have a 97–99% NPV that supports a delayed antibiotic
prescribing
strategy
for
FebriDx-negative
or
viral-
positive patients.
FebriDx showed an overall viral agreement of 86%,
sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 78%. However,
when an elevated MxA ELISA results were added to
the criterion standard for viral detection in patients
with no pathogens detected by the reference testing,
FebriDx specificity for viral infection increases to 84%
which may represent a tautology with the MxA in
FebriDx or the presence of other viruses such as
bocavirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus
(CMV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
In the previous study where the majority of patients
were afebrile at the time of enrolment, 62% of the
patients
were
found
to
have
a
microbiologically
unconfirmed respiratory illness (MURI) [8]. In this study,
where more than half the patients were febrile, the
rate of MURI was reduced to 28%.
The FebriDx test is a 10-minute, single-use, dispos-
able POC diagnostic test designed to rapidly provide
clinicians with actionable results for the management
of outpatient URIs. In one small study, FebriDx was
shown to impact outpatient clinical management
decisions in 48% of cases and reduced antibiotic use
by 80% [9]. FebriDx simultaneously and qualitatively
identifies elevated levels of CRP and MxA, biomarkers
that are associated with bacterial and viral infections,
respectively [12,28]. CRP is a non-specific acute phase
protein, when elevated above 20 mg/L suggests a
clinically significant immune response but cannot
reliably
differentiate
between
viral
and
bacterial
aetiology
[11,29,30],
whereas
a
CRP
below
this
20 mg/L threshold are likely to have non-bacterial or
self-limited infections [11,29,30]. Meta-analyses and
systematic reviews have shown that a standalone CRP
measurement at cut-off of 20 mg/ml can identify
clinically
significant
acute
respiratory
infection
requiring
antibiotic
therapy
without
impacting
morbidity [11,29,30] but cannot differentiate viral
from bacterial infections [8,9]. Using CRP to guide
therapeutic decisions can help to prevent missing a
serious bacterial infection but will lead to nearly 40%
overtreatment of viral infections [8]. A CRP concentra-
tion � 20 mg/L triggers a positive CRP reading on the
FebriDx test.
MxA is a viral biomarker with broad antiviral activity
against both RNA and DNA viruses [31] and is upregu-
lated by interferon-a and interferon–b (type-I interfer-
ons) in the presence of viral infection [12,32]. MxA
concentrations � 40 ng/ml,
a
level
that
has
been
identified as a sensitive threshold for identifying viral
infections,
triggers
a positive
reading on
FebriDx
[10,12,33]. MxA provides the required specificity to the
CRP interpretation to allow for guiding therapeutic
decisions.
By
combining
CRP
and
MxA
into
a
single test, FebriDx includes sensitive markers of both
bacterial and viral infection.
The majority of URI’s are self-limiting, including
confirmed bacterial infections and uncommonly lead
to complications [1,34]. Coinfections are rare and occur
in less than 2% of cases [1]. Melbye et al measured
daily CRP in the course of untreated URI and showed

 a moderately elevated CRP value (10–60 mg/l) is a
common finding in viral URI, with a peak during days
2–4 of illness, while persistent CRP elevations or new
elevations in CRP may indicate a bacterial infec-
tion [35].
A falling CRP, is an indicator of clinical improvement
and/or therapeutic response [35]. PCR may still identify
DNA
associated
with
a
pathogen
long
after
an
infection has cleared [36–38]. In addition, rare to low
culture growth is not uncommon during the first few
days of a healing process, even after the initiation anti-
biotics [36]. Evidence of an elevated CRP along with
bacterial cell culture growth on routine blood agar,
chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar or bacterial PCR
positivity is indicative of an ongoing clinically signifi-
cant infection [39]; however, lack of elevated CRP
would suggest clinical improvement [35] and this may
explain
the
lower
sensitivities
and
the
apparent
disconnect with the performance values when testing
after the resolution of fever.
Infection is defined by the establishment of a
microorganism within a host, while infectious disease
applies when the interaction causes damage or an
altered physiology resulting in clinical signs and symp-
toms [40]. Viral infections are frequently present in the
oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal, asymptomatically
and
symptomatically
and
may
lead
to
bacterial
colonization, however this does not necessarily lead to
clinically significant infection [41]. Pathogen-specific
testing, whether antigen, culture or molecular, cannot
discriminate between colonization or the carrier state
[42,43].
Differentiation
of
infectious
disease
from
colonization or a clinically insignificant local infection
requires the demonstration of a systemic antibody
response, though not practically measured in the
outpatient setting [44]. Host biomarkers, such as CRP
and MxA, may serve as surrogates for the antibody
response [8,10,11].
Historically, there has been a lack of rapid and
accurate diagnostic tests to help clinicians distinguish
between viral and bacterial infection [1,6,7,45,46]. The
ability to rapidly differentiate viral from bacterial infec-
tion is essential for successful outpatient antibiotic
stewardship. Biomarkers such as standalone CRP and
PCT, as well as CRP in combination with either MxA or
both TRAIL and IP-10, or gene expression studies are
the
leading
candidates
for
assisting
clinicians
to
achieve this goal [8,47–50]. There is no definitive refer-
ence standard for distinguishing between viral and
bacterial
respiratory
infections,
which
is
especially
problematic in the afebrile state; we used an algo-
rithm-based approach to maximize reproducibility and
validity
of
our
reference
standard,
but
some
misclassification is possible. When comparing these
biomarkers, alone or in combination, it is important to
normalize the analysis to those studies testing patients
with a confirmed fever at the time of enrolment from
those reporting a fever within several days of testing
(Table 4). It is also important to recognize that testing
hospital inpatients, especially those with pneumonia
and sepsis, are more likely to have more robust
immune responses that are not necessarily seen in
lower
acuity
outpatient
infections.
Examining
outpatient pharyngitis, the median (range) values of
the PCT was shown to be 0.374 ng/ml (0.11–6.5) [26]
and CRP has been shown to be CRP 44 mg/L (38–60)
[51] to 50 mg/L (22–71) [26]. When comparing clinical
performance of diagnostic tests, defining test perform-
ance in afebrile patients at the time of enrolment
poses challenges because of the difficulties in estab-
lishing an appropriate reference method, resulting
from persistent antigen or nucleic acids during an
initial clinical cure.
Strengths of the current study include (1) the
prospective,
multicentre
design;
(2)
standardized
procedures and definitions used across all sites;
(3) appropriate blinding of FebriDx and reference
standard
results
to
personnel
who
performed
FebriDx and reference testing measurements; and
(4) use of a clinical algorithm to determine infection
[8,11]. With an overall agreement 94%, sensitivity of
85–95% and
specificity of 93–94%, and NPV of
97–99%, data are supportive of using FebriDx in a
clinical
setting
to
assist
with
decisions
about
prescribing
antibiotics.
Potential
advantages
of
FebriDx include the convenience of simultaneously
screening for pathogenic bacteria and viruses with a
single test and the rapidity of the results. Although
FebriDx cannot differentiate a rare coinfection, the
97–99% NPV suggests that the FebriDx test may
support
an
initial
watchful
waiting
antibiotic
strategy [8,11].
Our study had limitations. First, since children only
represented 5% of the overall enrolment, this study
better
reflects
an
adult
population.
Second,
our
population is best described as a convenience sample
because
of the constraints
of shipping
biological
samples and availability of research staff. Third, blood
and sputum cultures were not performed due to low
anticipated yield for these tests in outpatients with
URIs. Fourth, we did not test for other possible viral
pathogens known to cause URI including HSV, CMV,
bocavirus or HIV. Fifth, we only captured information
during a patient’s index visit; including follow-up infor-
mation from later visits may have provided additional
data useful for classifying URIs as viral or bacterial.

 Finally, it is possible that patients had a coexisting
infection outside the respiratory tract.
Conclusions
FebriDx
is
an
outpatient
POC
test
designed
to
identify a clinically significant systemic host immune
response and aid in the differentiation of viral and
bacterial infection through rapid measurement of
MxA and CRP from a fingerstick blood sample. In this
study of diagnostic accuracy, the FebriDx test was
determined to be an accurate test, with a 85%
sensitivity, 93% specificity and 97% NPV to rule out
bacterial infection for any patient presenting with
symptoms and reported fever within the prior 3 days.
In confirmed febrile patients at the time of testing,
the test was even more sensitive (95%) and specific
(94%) with a 99% NPV. Comparatively, FebriDx reveals
greater accuracy than a standalone CRP or PCT test
for identifying clinically-important viral and bacterial
URI and similar accuracy to other combined protein
biomarker panels; however, FebriDx is easier to use
and more rapidly reports. FebriDx may support anti-
biotic stewardship by rapidly identifying clinically sig-
nificant bacterial URIs.
