Police agencies in Canada and elsewhere have received much criticism over how they respond to persons with
serious mental disorders. The adequacy of training provided to police officers on mental health issues and in par-
ticular on recognizing indicators of serious mental disorders has been a major concern. This paper describes the
process that led to the development of a new brief mental health screener (interRAI Brief Mental Health Screener,
BMHS) designed to assist police officers to better identify persons with serious mental disorders. The interRAI
BMHS was developed in collaboration with interRAI, an international, not-for-profit consortium of researchers.
The government of Ontario had previously partnered with interRAI to develop and implement the Resident As-
sessment Instrument for Mental Health (RAI-MH), the assessment system mandated for use on all persons ad-
mitted into inpatient psychiatric care in the province. Core items on the interRAI BMHS were obtained through
analysis (N = 41,019) of RAI-MH data together with input from representatives from health care, police services,
and patient groups. Two police services in southwestern Ontario completed forms (N = 235) on persons thought
to have a mental disorder. Patient records were later accessed to determine patient disposition. The use of sum-
mary and inferential statistics revealed that the variables significantly associated with being taken to hospital by
police included performing a self-injurious act in the past 30 days, and others being concerned over the person's
risk for self-injury. Variables significantly associated with being admitted included abnormal thought process, de-
lusions, and hallucinations. The results of the study indicate that the 14-variable algorithm used to construct the
interRAI BMHS is a good predictor of who was most likely to be taken to hospital by police officers and who was
most likely to be admitted. The instrument is an effective means of capturing and standardizing police officer ob-
servations enabling them to provide more and better quality information to emergency department (ED) staff.
Teaching police officers to use the form constitutes enhanced training on major indicators of serious mental dis-
orders. Further, given that items on the interRAI BMHS are written in the language of the health system, language
acts as common currency between police officers and ED staff laying the foundation for a more collaborative ap-
proach between the systems.

1. Introduction
When a person with a serious mental health disorder (PSMD)
presents with disruptive, dangerous, or criminal behavior, police offi-
cers are often called to de-escalate the situation, to determine if criminal
charges are warranted, and to bring the person to the attention of the
mental health care system. The various provincial mental health acts
in Canada provide the authority for police officers to apprehend a per-
son who they believe have a mental health disorder and poses a threat
to themselves or others and to transport the person to a hospital for as-
sessment or treatment. The ability of police officers to accurately identi-
fy behaviors associated with a mental disorder is necessary for the
purposes of fulfilling their legal obligations under the mental health
act(s). It is also important because it may influence how they perceive
and respond to persons experiencing a mental health crisis. Moreover,
if police officers are better able to recognize indicators of mental

 disorder, it may encourage them to connect or re-connect the person to

Police officers have received much criticism over how they have
responded to PSMD experiencing a mental health crisis particularly
when there are tragic consequences. Two issues have been inevitably
raised in the aftermath of such incidents: the adequacy of police training
on mental health issues and the recognition that there needs to be more
effective integration and collaboration between the mental health and
criminal justice systems.
Recommendations for enhanced police training have emanated
from various sources including police officers themselves (Cotton,
2004; Vermette, Pinals, & Appelbaum, 2005), persons with “lived
experience” (Brink, Livingston, Desmarais, et al., 2011), major reports
(Borum, 2000; Coleman & Cotton, 2014; Iacobucci, 2014), coroner's in-
quest recommendations (Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario, 1992,
1997, 2005, 2014), and studies on police academy (Cotton & Coleman,
2008) and in-service training (Coleman & Cotton, 2010). It has been
asserted that current police training on the subject of mental illness is
inadequate and lacks standardization across the country (Coleman &
Cotton, 2014). It has also been argued that current training is overly
focused on police officer safety as opposed to training on the nature
of mental disorders and de-escalation techniques (Borum, 2000;
Coleman & Cotton, 2014).
The second issue to emerge in the aftermath of deadly encounters
between police and PSMD is the recognition that there needs to be
more effective integration of systems and services, particularly the
criminal justice and mental health care systems (Coleman & Cotton,
2014; Iacobucci, 2014; Wolff, 2002a,b). Despite broad acknowledge-
ment of this issue, however, there have been few suggestions as how
the goal of integrating systems and services can be achieved.
The interRAI Brief Mental Health Screener (BMHS) is a new
evidence-based brief mental health screening form developed for use
by police officers. The evidence upon which it is based is the data obtain-
ed through the use of the RAI-MH, the mandated psychiatric assessment
system used in all Ontario hospitals. The form is completed by police of-
ficers whenever they encounter a person exhibiting indicators of mental
disorder. There were two goals underlying the development and use of
the interRAI BMHS: (1) to enhance the ability of police officers to recog-
nize indicators of serious mental disorder and (2) to help facilitate a
more collaborative relationship between frontline staff in the criminal
justice and health systems. The objective of this article is to describe
the process that led to the creation of the interRAI BMHS, the findings
of the pilot study and to explore the implications of its continued use.
1.1. Conceptual framework
The current model underlying the mental health care system is
based on the concept of integration of systems and services. According-
ly, service providers from different ministries, organizations, and agen-
cies work collaboratively to respond to the needs of PSMD. It has been
argued, however, that the model is flawed and the systems do not pro-
vide a coordinated response to the needs of PSMD (Wolff, 2002a,b). The
emergency department (ED) of a general hospital exemplifies this lack
of coordination. The ED is a key juncture where the criminal justice,
the health care, and the mental health care systems intersect. As the
frontline of the criminal justice system, Ontario police officers have
the authority to take persons to the ED when they believe a mental
health problem is present, there is risk of harm to self or others, or
there is evidence the person in incapable of caring for him or herself
(MHA, 1990). Indeed, studies indicate that police officers are, in fact, a
major source of referrals to emergency psychiatric services (Maharaj,
Gillies, Andrew, & Obrien, 2011; Way, Evans, & Banks, 1993). However,
in many cases, the process of transferring persons from police custody
to hospital care has been problematic. For example, police officers and
PSMD have experienced excessive wait times (Senate Standing
Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, 2006). Issues
have been raised about the ability of ED nurses to accurately triage pa-
tients presenting with mental health disorders (Clarke, Dusome, &
Hughes, 2007). In some jurisdictions, there is evidence of an adversarial
relationship between police officers and ED staff (Office of the Chief
Coroner of Ontario, 2005). Finally, repeat presentations at the ED by po-
lice officers with the same persons provide support for what has been
termed the “revolving door syndrome” (Provincial Human Services
and Justice Coordinating Committee, 2011).
A major factor underlying the inability to provide a coordinated re-
sponse to PSMD is the disparate roles performed by frontline staff of
each system. Police officers view mental disorders through the lens of
public and personal safety. They are primarily concerned with potential
for harm to self or others because their legislative authorities emphasize
violence potential (see for example, S. 17, MHA, Ontario, 1990). A num-
ber of studies confirm that the most common characteristic associated
with PSMD referred to hospital by police officers is violent or aggressive
behavior toward self or others (Broussard, McGriff, Demir Neubert,
D'Orio, & Compton, 2010; Citrome & Volaka, 1999; Kneebone, Rogers,
& Hafner, 1995; Lee, Brunero, Fairbrother, & Cowan, 2008; McNiel,
Hatcher, Zeiner, Wolfe, & Myers, 1991; Meadows, Calder, & Van Den
Bos, 1994; Redondo & Currier, 2003; Reinish & Ciccone, 1995; Sales,
1991; Watson, Segal, & Newhill, 1993; Way et al., 1993).
In contrast, ED triage nurses, as the frontline of the health care sys-
tem, are guided by the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS, 2008.
The focus of the CTAS is not on assessing the nature and severity of a
mental health disorder per se but on determining how long the patient
can safely remain in the ED before being seen by a physician.
As to ED physicians, although many variables enter into their assess-
ment, severity of symptoms and diagnoses such as schizophrenia, psy-
chosis, and manic disorders appear to be major factors (Lyons et al.,
1997; Marson, McGovern, & Pomp, 1988; McNiel et al., 1991; Mulder,
Koopmans, & Lyons, 2005). Patients with violent tendencies represent
a somewhat unique case. McNiel, Myers, Zeiner, Wolfe, and Hatcher
(1992) found the ED physicians who participated in their study
responded in a manner consistent with established clinical practice,
which is to concentrate on identifying the source of the violence behav-
ior. If the underlying source can be found and if it is considered treat-
able, it is more likely the person will be hospitalized.
The use of the interRAI BMHS by police officers was intended to
achieve two aims: enhance police training and support a more collabo-
rative approach between police officers and ED staff as the frontline of
the criminal justice and health care systems. First, core items on the
interRAI BMHS were identified as key indicators of serious mental disor-
der primarily through an analysis of RAI-MH data validated by the pilot
study. Teaching police officers to use the interRAI BMHS therefore con-
stitutes enhanced evidence-based training on indicators of serious men-
tal disorder. Second, because the items on the interRAI BMHS are
consistent with those on the RAI-MH, or the health system, common
language will act as a bridge helping to synchronize the systems.
2. Methods
There were several stages to the development of the interRAI BMHS,
including a focused literature review, an analysis of RAI-MH data, the
creation of an advisory committee, and input from the international
Network of Mental Health (iNMH), a subcommittee of interRAI com-
prised of researchers and clinicians from nine countries with a broad
range of expertise in mental health services.
2.1. Review of mental health rating scales
Screening or rating instruments related to mental health have been
used for over half a century, several of the most popular being the
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (Overall & Gorham, 1962), the Positive
and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia (Kay, Fiszbein, &
Opler, 1987), and the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scales (Haddock,

 McCarron, Tarrier, & Faragher, 1999). There are also a number of scales
used to measure depression and suicide potential such as Beck's Suicidal
Intent Scale (Beck, Kovacs, & Weissman, 1979) and Beck's Hopelessness
Scale (Beck, Resnik, & Lettieri, 1974). Although most of these rating
scales are relatively brief, they are not designed to capture observations
made by frontline staff nor are they designed to assess for threat of harm
in imminent situations. Instead, they were primarily intended for use by
clinicians or researchers in structured interviews. Also, many are self-
reporting scales, and all require expertise and considerable training to
administer and interpret. Given that none of the mental health
screeners currently in use are suitable for frontline police officers and
ED staff, a new instrument would have to be constructed.
2.2. RAI-MH as the basis of a mental health screener
The many features of the RAI-MH made it ideal as a basis from which
to develop a brief mental health screening instrument, the first being its
comprehensiveness. The RAI-MH instrument collects information from
patients on more than 400 individual items measuring mental and
physical health symptoms, sociodemographic characteristics, substance
abuse, risk of harm to self or others, functional characteristics, and ser-
vice utilization. Second, the instrument has good reliability and validity
in inpatient psychiatry settings (Gibbons et al., 2008; Seto, Harris, &
Rice, 2004; Urbanoski, Mulsant, Willett, Ehtesham, & Rush, 2012),
with inter-rater agreement averaging 80% or more (Hirdes et al., 2002,
2008). Third, with more than 41,000 individual mental health assess-
ments available for analysis, the RAI-MH data represent a large popula-
tion upon which to identify, analyze, and validate items as candidates
for inclusion on a screener. Fourth, a unique feature of interRAI instru-
ments is the use of algorithms that “trigger” care planning and interven-
tions referred to as Mental Health Clinical Assessment Protocols (CAPS)
(Martin et al., 2009; Mathias, Hirdes, & Pittman, 2010). It is conceivable
that the concept underlying CAPS could be adapted for use by police of-
ficers for training purposes ensuring evidence-based best practice re-
sponse guidelines. Fifth, embedded within the RAI-MH are validated
assessment scales pertaining to danger to self or others and inability
to care for self which correspond to police officer apprehension author-
ities under the MHA. Finally, ED staff with experience in mental health
care should have some knowledge of the RAI-MH, and if it were made
known the brief screener for police officers was based on their own
data and instrument, it may act as an incentive to accepting the new
instrument.
2.3. Constructing a draft mental health screener
Since a police officer's apprehension authorities are based primarily
on dangerousness, the first step in the analysis was the creation of a var-
iable that reflected risk of harm to self or others, appropriately named
risk of harm (RoH). RoH was based on an analysis of three scales embed-
ded in the RAI-MH, severity of self-harm (SOS), risk of harm to others
(RHO), and the self-care index (SCI) scale (Hirdes et al., 2011). All
three scales are scored on an index ranging in severity from 0 to 6; the
higher the score, the more severe the condition. The highest level of
RoH was a score of 6 in any of the three scales referred to as (RoH-high).
The second step was to identify individual variables that were
correlated with RoH-high. Due to the large number of variables on the
RAI-MH, the analysis focused on the top 20 variables with the strongest
association with RoH-high. These items were considered candidates for
inclusion in the interRAI BMHS pending the results of further multivar-
iate analyses. Except for a slight difference in ordering, the same vari-
ables were predictive of scoring either a 6 only or a 5 or a 6 on the
three risk scales (see Table 1). Using RoH-high as the basis of a model,
it was possible to further reduce the number of variables to 14 because
of redundancy of some of the items. Logistic regression analysis
was used on the 14-variable algorithm (see Table 2), which produced
a C-statistic of 0.89.
The third step was to create a variable that reflected police officer ap-
prehension authorities. Provincial legislation in the form of the MHA
(1990) provides police officers legislative authority to apprehend
PSMD of which there are three fundamental components. The person
must pose as a danger to self or others, and police officers must believe
that the behavior due to a mental illness. Thus, although police officers
focus on violence potential, an accurate reflection of their apprehension
authorities includes both indicators of dangerousness and indicators of
disordered thought. A new variable was thus created referred to as po-
lice escort to hospital (PEH), which included indicators of RoH (i.e., to
self or others) (variables 1–6, Table 2) and indicators of disordered
thought (variables 7–14, Table 2).
The final step in the analysis was to examine the relationship be-
tween the 14-variable algorithm and the reason for admission on the
RAI-MH. Using the sample of 41,019 cases, a strong relationship was re-
vealed between PEH and the reason for admission items. Of those who
were admitted because of threat or danger to self, 67% (χ2 = 3849.6,
df = 1, p b .0001) were classified as PEH; of those who were admitted be-
cause of threat or danger to others, 71% (χ2 = 1882.5, df = 1, p b .0001)
met the criteria for PEH; and when the reason was inability to care for
self, 57% (χ2 = 393.3, df = 1, p b .0001) met the criteria for PEH.
The 14 items in the model became the core items on the interRAI
BMHS supplemented with items recommended by the advisory commit-
tee. These additional items were included because they were either not
addressed on the RAI-MH or they were of particular concern to commit-
tee members. Thus, the final draft version of the interRAI BMHS included
14 items from the analysis of the RAI-MH data, 9 additional clinical var-
iables recommended by the advisory committee, and 10 administrative
and contextual variables. With a draft version of the interRAI BMHS cre-
ated, the task of the research team was to work with the advisory com-
mittee to determine issues related to a pilot project.

 County detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police and the Guelph Po-
lice Service. The jurisdiction was chosen because it was representative
of the province of Ontario on a number of important variables including
demographics, urban and rural mix, policing services, and access to
health services. The hospitals that participated in the study included
the Guelph General Hospital, Groves Memorial Community Hospital,
Palmerston and District Hospital, and Louise Marshall Hospital.
2.4.2. Training
Police officers received training on how to use the interRAI BMHS
through interactive classroom exercises. In a small group format, they
were asked to describe the characteristics of a person with whom they
had recently apprehended under authority of the MHA and transported
to hospital for psychiatric assessment. Officer's descriptive comments
were recorded on flip charts at the front of the classroom. To ensure
the police officers understood the link between their descriptive com-
ments and the items on the interRAI BMHS, they received training on
each of the items on the form. Next, they were asked to complete the
interRAI BMHS using the items previously recorded on flip charts. That
is, they now had to translate their original comments into the language
on the interRAI BMHS as a means of validating officers' understanding of
the screener items, and ensuring that the individual items were com-
pleted reliably.
2.4.3. Data collection
The police officers who participated in the study were instructed to
complete the interRAI BMHS for all persons they encountered who
they had reasonable grounds to believe had a mental health disorder.
When the decision was made to apprehend the person under the
MHA, the person was transported to the local general hospital where
the officer provided ED staff with a copy of the interRAI BMHS. The po-
lice officer retained the original copy of the interRAI BMHS, which was
later submitted to a person designated to collect the forms at the police
station at the end of each shift or as soon as practical thereafter. Com-
pleted forms were later collected and stored in a secure server located
at the University of Waterloo.
2.4.4. Statistical analysis
A combined total of 300 interRAI BMHS forms were completed be-
tween March 2011 and January 2012. Forms were excluded from anal-
ysis if the sole reason for the police officer being involved was for
transportation purposes, assisting ED staff, acting as a backup officer,
or if the person was turned over to ambulance personnel. Also, when
the same person had multiple contacts with police during the study pe-
riod, only the first contact was used resulting in a total of 235 completed
forms included in the final analysis.
3. Results
Univariate analysis was used to describe how individual items on the
interRAI BMHS performed. The distributions of the variables were
calculated for indicators of disordered thought, and indicators of risk
of harm. Chi-square analysis was used to examine the relationship be-
tween individual variables on the interRAI BMHS and sex, and police
service. Chi-square analysis was also used to examine the association
between variables on the interRAI BMHS and characteristics of persons
taken to the hospital by police officers and characteristics of those per-
sons who were admitted. Univariate analyses of the demographic, con-
textual, and clinical characteristics of the sample population revealed
the average age was 38.7 (SD = 17 years; range 10–96 years). The ma-
jority of the contacts (85.5%) occurred between the hours of 8 a.m. and
12 a.m., and there were slightly more contacts on Mondays (17.4%) and
Fridays (16.6%) compared to other days of the week which averaged
about 13%. There were only 10 (4.3%) reported cases of homelessness.
In terms of clinical variables, more than 50.0% of the sample population
exhibited irritability (62.9%), abnormal thought process (54.9%), and
lack of insight into their mental health problem (60.4%). Further,
51.7% had considered performing a self-injurious act in the last
30 days and in 61.8% of the cases, family, caregiver, friend, or others
expressed concern that the person was at risk for self-injury. Fifty-
seven percent (134) of the sample were males and 43.0% (101) were fe-
males. Males were significantly more likely to be intoxicated by drug or
alcohol (44.8% versus 29.7% for females) (χ2 = 5.5, df = 2, p = 0.02)
and to have violent ideation (39.6% compared to 23.8% for females)
(χ2 = 6.5, df = 2, p = 0.01).
To more closely examine the characteristics of persons taken to hos-
pital by police officers and those who were admitted, two groups were
created with all persons brought to the hospital by police officers in one
group, referred to as “police escort to hospital” (PEH) (N = 195) and
second group referred to as “admitted” (N = 40). A significantly higher
percentage of persons were escorted to the hospital by police officers
who exhibited the following characteristics: socially inappropriate or
disruptive behavior (49.2%) (χ2 = 11.5, df = 1, p = 0.0007); verbal
abuse (42.6%) (χ2 = 10.7, df = 1, p = 0.001); violent ideation (36.9%)
(χ2 = 9.0, df = 1, p = 0.003); violence to others (27.7%) (χ2 = 5.6,
df = 1, p = 0.02); self-injurious attempt—last 7 days (33.2%) (χ2 =
12.9, df = 1, p = 0.0003); considered performing a self-injurious act
in last 30 days (58.8%) (χ2 = 22.6, df = 1, p = b.0001); suicide
plan—last 30 days (38.7%) (χ2 = 12.2, df = 17.6, df = 1, p = 0.0005);
and others were concerned that the person is at risk of self-harm
(67.9%) (χ2 = 17.6, df = 1, p = b 0.0001).
As to the subset of people brought to the ED by police officers who
were subsequently admitted (see Tables 3 and 4), the following vari-
ables were significantly associated with hospitalization: hallucinations
(28.6%) (χ2 = 10.5, df = 1, p = 0.001); delusions (32.9%) (χ2 = 9.2,

with serious mental disorders, International Journal of Law and Psychiatry (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2016.02.031
 df = 1, p = 0.002); abnormal thought process (68.6%) (χ2 = 6.0, df = 1,
p = 0.01); and lack of insight into their mental health problem (74.3%)
(χ2 = 6.9, df = 1, p = 0.008). Persons were significantly less likely to be
admitted if they had the following characteristics: intoxication by drug
or alcohol (28.6%) (χ2 = 6.5, df = 1, p = 0.01) and self-injurious at-
tempt in the last 7 days (24.3%) (χ2 = 3.9, df = 1, p = 0.05).
Persons taken to hospital by police officers in the study sample
tended to be males in their late 30s. The most common reason why po-
lice officers took someone to the hospital was that they had “considered
performing a self-injurious act in the past 30 days” and “family,
caregiver, friend, others concerned that person is at risk for self-
injury.” Having a drug or alcohol problem was not a significant reason
for bringing someone to the hospital and although symptoms of psycho-
ses were associated with being admitted, this was not a major factor
accounting for why police officers brought the person to hospital.
Dangerousness and aggressiveness toward self or others were not asso-
ciated with being admitted. Rather, indicators of disordered thought
such as lack of insight into their mental health problems, abnormal
thought process, delusions, and hallucinations were most associated
with being admitted.
4. Discussion
The results of the pilot study are consistent with the literature in that
police officers tend to focus primarily on violence potential and issues of
public safety (Broussard et al., 2010; Citrome & Volaka, 1999; Kneebone
et al., 1995; Lee et al., 2008; Lyons et al., 1997; Marson et al., 1988;
McNiel et al., 1991; Meadows et al., 1994; Mulder et al., 2005;
Redondo & Currier, 2003; Reinish & Ciccone, 1995; Sales, 1991;
Watson et al., 1993; Way et al., 1993). However, unlike previous
research, which is based almost exclusively on hospital records of ED
presentations and admissions, the current study used data obtained
from police officers. Further, the use of the interRAI BMHS enabled the
collection of more detailed information on the characteristics of persons
who police officers had interaction with. For example, danger to self or
others can be described as “Family, caregiver, friend others concerned
that person is at risk for self-injury,” “Considered performing a self-
injurious act in last 30 days,” and “Socially inappropriate or disruptive
behaviour.”
Previous studies revealed that ED physicians tend to focus on the
more severely disturbed and diagnoses such as schizophrenia, psycho-
sis, and manic disorders (Lyons et al., 1997; Marson et al., 1988;
Mulder et al., 2005). The use of the interRAI BMHS enabled police offi-
cers to capture, in much more detail, the characteristics of PSMD who
were hospitalized but were not based on diagnoses. That is, factors asso-
ciated with psychiatric admission included “Degree of insight into men-
tal health problems,” “Abnormal thought process,” and “Delusions” and
“Hallucinations.”
An important finding from the pilot study is that the reasons why
police officers apprehended a person and took him or her to the hospital
were not the same as the reasons why the person was subsequently ad-
mitted. As noted, police officers tend to be more concerned with vio-
lence potential while ED physicians focus on psychiatric disorders and
the underlying cause of violent behavior as opposed to the behavior it-
self. This suggests gaining access to mental health care resources
through police contact involves a two-step process. The first step is
meeting the criteria for being apprehended by police officers and the
second step is meeting the criteria for being admitted into the hospital.
The two-step process reveals a lack of consensus between the systems
on indicators of serious mental disorder. This evidence may provide

with serious mental disorders, International Journal of Law and Psychiatry (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2016.02.031
 support for those who contend that the mental health and criminal jus-
tice systems lack synchronization (Iacobucci, 2014; Wolff, 2002a,b).
Lastly, the current study demonstrated that with additional training
as recommended in the literature (Borum, 2000; Coleman & Cotton,
2014) and an enhanced method of recording relevant observations
through the use of the interRAI BMHS, police officers are capable of ac-
curately recognizing indicators of serious mental disorder and commu-
nicating their observations to ED staff.
4.1. Limitations
There were several limitations to the pilot study. First and foremost,
the sample size was relatively small. With a larger sample size, addition-
al variables might prove to be statistically significant, and conversely,
some of the variables currently in the model may not continue to be sta-
tistically significant. Second, the sample population was biased toward
white, predominantly English-speaking population with almost no rep-
resentation from First Nations peoples. This does not reflect the demo-
graphic reality in the province, particularly in larger urban centres.
Third, as a pilot study, it was not possible to gather data from a random-
ized or matched control sample of police interactions with PSMD else-
where in the province, although the results do compare favorably
with other studies and data collected from different jurisdictions.
Fourth, it was not possible to measure inter-rater reliability and obtain
estimates of validity due to limited project resources and the relatively
small sample size, although the individual items included on the screen-
er as based on those in the RAI-MH have demonstrated good validity
and reliability across diverse inpatient hospital settings (Gibbons et al.,
2008; Seto et al., 2004; Urbanoski et al., 2012). Finally, the dependent
variables were limited to police escort to hospital and admission,
which does not reflect the current broad range of dispositions available
to both police officers and clinicians. Future research should focus on
measuring inter-rater reliability and including methods of cross-
validation, which should be integrated into the research design. For ex-
ample, a split half procedure could be used where the sample is ran-
domly divided into two groups: an exploratory group and a group that
would be used for validation purposes. Finally, future research is needed
to determine if police officers benefited from the enhanced training
made possible by the use of the form and if, in fact, it helped to bridge
the gap between the systems.
5. Conclusion
An important finding from the pilot study was that 11 of the original
14 variables identified through the analysis of RAI-MH data which
formed the core items on the interRAI BMHS proved to be significantly
associated with either being taken to the hospital by police officers, or
being hospitalized. This suggests the use of the interRAI BMHS did, in
fact, enhance the ability of police officers to identify indicators of serious
mental disorder. The pilot study provides useful information for both
police officers and clinicians regarding variables that are significantly
associated with serious mental disorders. Continued use of the interRAI
BMHS will provide important information that can be used as a guide to
support both police officer and ED decision making and training. Of even
greater significance, the adoption of a common language encourages
meaningful dialogue between police officers and hospital staff and
may prove to be the vital first step to bridge the gap between the sys-
tems. Already, a number of police services and hospitals in the province
of Ontario are using the interRAI BMHS and an electronic APP has been
developed to further enhance communication all of which is ultimately
aimed at better addressing the needs of persons with serious mental
disorder.
