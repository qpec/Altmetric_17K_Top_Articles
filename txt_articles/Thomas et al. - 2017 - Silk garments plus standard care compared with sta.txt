Abstract
Background
The role of clothing in the management of eczema (also called atopic dermatitis or atopic
eczema) is poorly understood. This trial evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of silk garments (in addition to standard care) for the management of eczema in children
with moderate to severe disease.
Methods and findings
This was a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, observer-blind trial. Children aged 1 to 15
y with moderate to severe eczema were recruited from secondary care and the community
at five UK medical centres. Participants were allocated using online randomisation (1:1) to
standard care or to standard care plus silk garments, stratified by age and recruiting centre.
Silk garments were worn for 6 mo. Primary outcome (eczema severity) was assessed at
baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo, by nurses blinded to treatment allocation, using the Eczema Area

 and Severity Index (EASI), which was log-transformed for analysis (intention-to-treat analy-
sis). A safety outcome was number of skin infections.
Three hundred children were randomised (26 November 2013 to 5 May 2015): 42% girls,
79% white, mean age 5 y. Primary analysis included 282/300 (94%) children (n = 141 in
each group). The garments were worn more often at night than in the day (median of 81% of
nights [25th to 75th centile 57% to 96%] and 34% of days [25th to 75th centile 10% to 76%]).
Geometric mean EASI scores at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo were, respectively, 9.2, 6.4, 5.8,
and 5.4 for silk clothing and 8.4, 6.6, 6.0, and 5.4 for standard care. There was no evidence
of any difference between the groups in EASI score averaged over all follow-up visits
adjusted for baseline EASI score, age, and centre: adjusted ratio of geometric means 0.95,
95% CI 0.85 to 1.07, (p = 0.43). This confidence interval is equivalent to a difference of −1.5
to 0.5 in the original EASI units, which is not clinically important. Skin infections occurred in
36/142 (25%) and 39/141 (28%) of children in the silk clothing and standard care groups,
respectively. Even if the small observed treatment effect was genuine, the incremental cost
per quality-adjusted life year was £56,811 in the base case analysis from a National Health
Service perspective, suggesting that silk garments are unlikely to be cost-effective using
currently accepted thresholds. The main limitation of the study is that use of an objective pri-
mary outcome, whilst minimising detection bias, may have underestimated treatment
effects.
Conclusions
Silk clothing is unlikely to provide additional benefit over standard care in children with mod-
erate to severe eczema.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Prior to this trial, evidence on the use of silk garments for the management of eczema
was limited.
• Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) had been conducted, but these were small
(74 participants in total) and at risk of bias.
• The existing evidence was insufficient to guide clinical practice on the use of silk cloth-
ing in the management of eczema, and no cost-effectiveness analyses had been
undertaken.

 What did the researchers do and find?
• We conducted a pragmatic, observer-blind RCT that recruited 300 children with mod-
erate to severe eczema and followed them for six months.
• Participants were randomised to receive standard eczema care plus silk clothing (100%
sericin-free silk garments; DermaSilk or DreamSkin) or standard care alone.
• After six months, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in eczema
severity (Eczema Area and Severity Index score) assessed by research nurses; the 95%
confidence interval ranged from 1.5 points favouring silk clothing to 0.5 points favour-
ing standard care, which is not a clinically important difference.
• Even if the potential small benefit of silk garments was genuine, our analysis suggests
that they are unlikely to be cost-effective within currently accepted thresholds, with an
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year of £56,811.
What do these findings mean?
• The CLOTHES Trial is the first large, independent RCT to have evaluated silk garments
for the management of eczema.
• The results of this trial suggest that silk garments are unlikely to provide additional clini-
cal or economic benefits over standard care for children with moderate to severe
eczema.
• These results provide robust evidence for health commissioners and prescribers to
make informed clinical decisions.
Introduction
Eczema (also called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema) is a chronic, itchy inflammatory skin
condition that is common throughout the world [1]. Childhood eczema has a substantial
impact on the quality of life of children and their families [2]. Many families are keen to iden-
tify new ways of managing the symptoms of eczema using non-pharmacological approaches
[3].
Clothing may play a role in either soothing or exacerbating eczema symptoms, and patients
are commonly advised to avoid wool because of its tendency to worsen itch, and to use cotton
or fine weave materials next to the skin [4]. Specialist clothing is now available on prescription
in a variety of forms including sericin-free silk, viscose, and silver-impregnated fabrics. These
garments are claimed to be beneficial for the management of eczema as they can help to regu-
late the humidity and temperature of the surface of the skin, are smooth in texture, and may
reduce skin damage from scratching. Some products have anti-microbial properties that could
help to reduce the bacterial load on the skin, which may be important in eczema [5].
To date, there have been just three small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of silk cloth-
ing for the management of eczema [6–8]. These trials involved very few participants (n = 22,

 30, and 22 participants, respectively), were of generally short duration, did not incorporate an
economic evaluation, and were at risk of bias [9].
In view of the limited evidence for the use of silk clothing for eczema management, the UK
National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme commis-
sioned the CLOTHing for the relief of Eczema Symptoms (CLOTHES) Trial. The trial had two
main objectives: (1) to assess whether use of silk garments plus standard eczema treatment
reduces eczema severity in children with moderate to severe eczema compared with standard
treatment alone, and (2) if so, to establish the likely cost-effectiveness of silk garments.
Methods
The protocol for this study has been published [10], and the protocol (S1 Protocol) and statisti-
cal analysis plan are available (http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/CLOTHES). The study was
approved by the Health Research Authority East Midlands–Nottingham 1 Research Ethics
Committee (13/EM/0255), and parents/guardians gave written informed consent (children
gave assent as appropriate). The trial was registered on Current Controlled Trials prior to start
of recruitment (ISRCTN77261365; 11 October 2013). This study is reported as per CONSORT
guidelines (S1 Checklist). A full trial report is available [11].
Study design
The CLOTHES Trial was a multi-centre, parallel-group, observer-blind, pragmatic RCT with
6 mo of follow-up. Children aged 1 to 15 y were randomised (1:1) to receive silk garments
plus standard eczema care or standard eczema care alone. The primary outcome was assessed
by research nurses blinded to the treatment allocation at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo. The trial
included a nested qualitative evaluation and health economic analysis. Changes to the proto-
col after start of participant recruitment included amendment of the number of FLG muta-
tions to be included in the genetic analysis and addition of details of the nested qualitative
evaluation.
Recruitment
Recruitment took place at five UK medical centres: Nottingham University Hospitals NHS
Trust, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, and Isle of Wight NHS Trust. Partici-
pants were identified through secondary care, through primary care, or in response to local
media advertising.
Children aged 1 to 15 y were enrolled. All had a diagnosis of eczema according to the UK
Working Party’s Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis [12] and a score of nine or more on
the Nottingham Eczema Severity Score, denoting moderate to severe eczema over the last 12
mo [13]. All participants had at least one area of active eczema on part of the body that would
be covered by the garments.
Children were excluded if they had taken systemic medication (e.g., ciclosporin or oral cor-
ticosteroids) or had received light therapy for eczema in the preceding 3 mo, had used wet/dry
wraps �5 times in the last month, had started a new medication or treatment regimen that
may affect eczema in the last month, were currently using silk clothing for their eczema and
were unwilling to stop during the trial, or were currently taking part in another clinical trial.
Only one child was enrolled per family.

 Interventions
The silk garments used in the trial (DermaSilk or DreamSkin) are licensed as a medical device
with a CE mark for use in eczema, denoting that they comply with EU legislation and safety
requirements. Two brands were included to improve the generalisability of the trial findings,
to avoid commercial advantage to any one company, and to limit the financial commitment
for the companies that donated the garments.
The garments are made with antimicrobially protected, knitted, sericin-free silk (100%).
Sericin is removed from the silk fibres during manufacture because it is a protein that coats the
outside of silk fibres and has the potential to cause allergic reactions. Participants received
three sets of garments (long-sleeved undershirts and leggings or bodysuits and leggings,
depending on the age of the child) and were instructed to wear the clothing as often as possible
during the day and at night.
Standardised usage instructions were provided, and participants were advised to allow topi-
cal medications to absorb into the skin prior to wearing the garments. Replacement garments
were provided if they were worn out, lost, or no longer fitted during the 6-mo period of the
trial.
Participants in both the intervention and control group continued with their standard
eczema care in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance
[14], including regular emollient use and topical corticosteroids (or calcineurin inhibitors) for
controlling inflammation. Participants were asked not to change their standard eczema treat-
ment for the duration of the trial unless medically warranted. If a skin infection was suspected,
participants were advised to contact their normal medical team for confirmation of diagnosis
and subsequent treatment.
Outcomes
Core outcomes as defined by the Harmonising Outcomes Measures for Eczema (HOME) ini-
tiative [15,16] were included.
Primary outcome
Eczema severity captured using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) [17] was assessed
by trained research nurses at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo. Baseline EASI score was used as a covari-
ate in the analysis model. EASI is a validated scale recommended as the core outcome instru-
ment for eczema signs [18]. EASI scoring involves an evaluation of four eczema signs
(erythema [redness], excoriation [scratching], oedema/papulation [swelling and fluid in the
skin], and lichenification [thickening of the skin]) and an assessment of percentage area
affected by eczema in four body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs).
Higher scores represent more severe disease.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes were the following:
1. Global assessment of eczema by research nurses (Investigator Global Assessment [IGA])
[19] and by participants (participant global assessment [PGA]) at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo,
using a six-point scale (clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, severe, very severe).
2. Self-reported eczema symptoms using the HOME-recommended core outcome instrument
[15], the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), which captures frequency of itch,
sleep loss, bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, and dryness [20]. Higher scores

 represent more severe disease. POEM scores were collected weekly using an online ques-
tionnaire for 6 mo.
3. Three Item Severity (TIS) score [21] at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 mo, assessed by the research
nurses at a representative body site (defined as the most bothersome patch of eczema that
was covered by the garments).
4. Use of eczema treatments: number of days of use of topical steroids, topical calcineurin
inhibitors, emollients, and wet/dry wrapping was assessed weekly using an online question-
naire. Research nurses assessed change in eczema treatment regimen at each visit and cate-
gorised it as no change, neutral change, reduction, or escalation.
5. Health-related quality of life at baseline and at 6 mo from the perspectives of the family
(Dermatitis Family Impact [DFI]) [22], the main carer (EuroQol EQ-5D-3L) [23], and the
child (Atopic Dermatitis Quality of Life [ADQoL] preference-based index [24]; Child
Health Utility 9 Dimensions [CHU-9D] [25] in those aged 5 y and over).
6. Durability of the garments and acceptability of use (at 6 mo) and adherence (number of
days/nights garments worn, assessed weekly).
7. Within-trial cost-effectiveness from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective using the
ADQoL to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). ADQoL is a preference-based util-
ity instrument with four eczema-specific domains covering ability to join in activities,
mood, ability to be comforted, and sleep loss. The resulting 16 possible health states range
in utility from 0.356 (worst state) to 0.841 (best state) [24].
Safety outcomes
Safety outcomes were skin infections requiring antibiotic or antiviral treatment and serious
adverse events (SAEs) related to eczema.
Sample size
Three hundred participants provided 90% power at the 5% significance level (two-tailed) to
detect a difference of three points between the groups in mean EASI score. Although this
between-group difference is approximately half the published minimum clinically important
difference for EASI (suggested from one study in adults receiving systemic therapy) [26], we
wanted to be sure that a clinically important difference was not missed. Sample size was based
on repeated measures analysis of covariance, a standard deviation (SD) of 13, a correlation
between EASI scores at different time points of 0.6, and a loss to follow-up of 10%.
Randomisation and blinding
Randomisation was stratified by recruiting centre and by participant age: <2 y, 2 to 5 y, and
>5 y. A computer-generated pseudo-random code with random permuted blocks of randomly
varying size was created by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit. Research nurses accessed the
randomisation website via unique user logins. The sequence of treatment allocations remained
concealed until the database was locked at the end of the study, when it was revealed to data
analysts.
Staff at the coordinating centre sent confirmation of treatment allocation to participants
(along with the silk clothing as necessary). Whilst it was not possible to blind participants to
their treatment allocation, efforts were made to minimise expectation bias by emphasising in
the trial documents that the evidence supporting the use of silk garments for eczema was

 limited and that it was not yet known if such clothing offered any benefit over standard care.
Participant-facing study documents also avoided the use of value-laden terms such as “special-
ist” or “therapeutic” clothing.
In order to preserve blinding of the research nurses, participants were reminded in the
study literature and in their clinic appointment letters/texts not to wear the clothing when they
attended clinic or to mention the clothing when talking to the research nurses. All questions
relating to the acceptability and use of the clothing were completed using either postal or
online questionnaires, and telephone and email contact with participants was made by staff
from the coordinating centre whenever possible. If the research nurses became unblinded, this
was recorded.
FLG genotype analysis
Saliva samples were collected for DNA extraction and FLG genotyping. Only participants of
white European ethnicity were included in this analysis, because FLG mutations are ethnically
specific. Results for the four most prevalent loss-of-function mutations in the white European
population (R501X, 2282del4, R2447X, and S3247X) were obtained for 217 individuals and
were used to define genotype categories: FLG wild type (no mutations identified), FLG hetero-
zygote (one FLG null mutation), and FLG homozygote or compound heterozygote (two FLG
null mutations).
Statistical methods
Analyses were carried out by L. E. B. (trial statistician) using Stata/SE 13.1. The main approach
to analysis was modified intention to treat, i.e., analysis according to randomised group
regardless of adherence to allocation and including participants who provided data for at least
one follow-up time point. Estimates of the intervention effect are presented with 95% confi-
dence intervals and p-values. All regression models included the randomisation stratification
variables (recruiting centre and age) as covariates, and baseline scores, if measured. Adjusted
differences in means for the intervention group compared to the standard care group are pre-
sented for continuous outcomes, and adjusted risk differences and relative risks for binary out-
comes. For outcomes collected at the 2-, 4-, and 6-mo visits, we explored whether the effect of
the trial garments on the outcome changed over the study period by including an interaction
term between treatment group and time point in the model. As there was no evidence of a dif-
ferential effect over time for any outcomes, we report a single estimate per outcome that aver-
ages the treatment effect over all time points.
The primary analysis used a multilevel model with observations at 2, 4, and 6 mo nested
within participants. The model used a random intercept and slope at the participant level with
an unstructured covariance matrix for these random effects. The model assumed that missing
EASI scores were missing at random given the observed data. EASI scores were right skewed
at all time points. Diagnostic plots indicated that the assumptions for the multilevel model in
the original EASI units were not met. The data were log-transformed for analysis and the treat-
ment effect presented as a ratio of geometric means [27,28]. This ratio was back-transformed
to the original EASI units to facilitate interpretation of findings.
Sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome adjusted for variables that had an observed
imbalance between the groups at baseline, used multiple imputation for missing outcome data,
and explored the impact of adherence in wearing the clothing by estimating the complier aver-
age causal effect (CACE) at 6 mo using instrumental variable regression.
A planned subgroup analysis based on presence or absence of loss-of-function mutations in
FLG (which are associated with impaired skin barrier function and more severe disease) was

 conducted for the primary outcome by adding an interaction term between allocated treat-
ment and FLG genotype (none, one, or two FLG null mutations) to the primary analysis
model.
The global assessment scores (IGA and PGA) were dichotomized into clear, almost clear, or
mild eczema versus moderate, severe, or very severe eczema, and analysed using generalised
estimating equations. The mean weekly POEM scores, percentage of days that topical steroids
were used, and quality of life outcomes were analysed using linear models (weighted according
to the number of questionnaires completed for the weekly POEM and topical steroid use). The
TIS score was analysed using the multilevel model framework as outlined above for the pri-
mary outcome (not transformed). Changes to treatment regimen were based on whether a par-
ticipant had reported treatment escalation over the 6-mo RCT period and were analysed using
a generalised linear model. Skin infections were analysed using negative binomial regression.
SAEs and durability and acceptability of use of the garments were summarised descriptively.
Adherence in wearing the trial clothing was summarised using the percentage of days and
nights that the study clothing was worn. Participants were classified as being broadly adherent
if they wore the trial clothing for at least 50% of the days or 50% of the nights. This classifica-
tion was done for participants for whom at least half (12/24) of the weekly questionnaires were
completed, and sensitivity analysis explored the impact of different assumptions for those par-
ticipants who completed less than 50% of the weekly questionnaires. Adherence with the trial
clothing was explored descriptively according to age and baseline eczema severity using corre-
lation coefficients.
Full details of the analysis are documented in the statistical analysis plan, which was final-
ised prior to database lock and release of treatment allocation codes for analysis.
Following concerns that the baseline EASI scores appeared lower than might be expected
for children with moderate to severe eczema, an additional post hoc analysis was conducted to
explore the interaction between baseline severity and treatment group by adding an interac-
tion term between allocated group and baseline EASI score (log-transformed and continuous)
to the primary analysis model.
Patient involvement
Public and patient involvement (PPI) was embedded throughout the CLOTHES Trial. Various
PPI methods such as online surveys, discussion groups, and patient panels were used to inform
multiple aspects of the trial design including choice of comparator, eligibility criteria, potential
barriers to participation, and outcome measures. PPI members of the trial team also contrib-
uted to the development of patient-facing study materials and took part in media interviews to
enhance recruitment. A PPI representative was a co-applicant on the grant and was involved
in all stages from trial design through to data interpretation and write up, and another PPI rep-
resentative was a member of the trial steering committee.
The study results will be published on the CLOTHES Trial website, and a written summary
and child-friendly animated film will be sent to trial participants.
Health economics
The within-trial economic analysis (conducted by T. H. S. using Stata/SE 14.1) compared the
costs and QALYs in the standard care and intervention groups from the perspective of the
NHS. We attached published unit costs (2014–2015 UK pounds sterling) [29–31] to individ-
ual-level quantities of resource use (S1 Table) and estimated the mean cost per participant
incorporating the cost of the intervention and wider healthcare resource use (primary care,
secondary care, and medications).

 QALYs were estimated using linear interpolation and area under the curve analysis,
adjusting for baseline values, age, and recruitment centre. A regression-based approach
(seemingly unrelated regression equations) [32] was used for the statistical analysis. The
level of uncertainty associated with the decision over which option was most cost-effective
was explored using non-parametric bootstrapping [33] to construct the cost-effectiveness
acceptability curve [34]. Neither costs nor QALYs were discounted reflecting the time
frame.
To test the impact of taking an alternative approach to costing the silk garments, sensitivity
analysis included an estimate of the amount pharmacists are reimbursed for each item of
clothing they prescribe. This analysis was based on the NHS Business Services Authority for-
mula to estimate the actual cost to the NHS. The analysis was rerun using the March 2015 tariff
data [35], where the average discount was 7.43% and the pharmacist’s professional fee £0.90
per prescription item.
Results
Recruitment and retention
Three hundred children were randomised between 26 November 2013 and 5 May 2015 (last
study visit 21 October 2015). The primary analysis included 141 participants in each group
who had at least one primary outcome assessment after baseline (Fig 1). For all but four partic-
ipants, outcome assessments were performed by the same nurse at all study visits.
For the weekly online questionnaires (24 questionnaires over 6 mo), 126/149 (85%) partici-
pants in the intervention group and 127/151 (84%) participants in the standard care group
completed 12 questionnaires or more. The median number completed was 22 (25th to 75th
centile 17 to 24) in both groups.
Baseline characteristics
Participants had a mean age of 5 y, 42% were girls, and 79% were white. At recruitment, 72%
had moderate or severe eczema, as judged by the IGA (Table 1). Demographic and clinical
characteristics were well balanced at baseline apart from gender and parental reported his-
tory of asthma and food allergy (Table 1). The mean baseline EASI score was slightly higher
in the intervention group as more children had a baseline EASI score of over 30 points (14
participants in the intervention group, four participants in the standard care group). How-
ever, the median and interquartile range for EASI score were similar between the groups
(Table 2).
Adherence, contamination, and blinding
Adherence in wearing the garments was good. The garments were worn more often at night
than in the day (median of 81% of nights [25th to 75th centile 57% to 96%] and 34% of days
[25th to 75th centile 10% to 76%]) (Fig 2; S2 Table). Adherence in wearing the garments was
not associated with age or eczema severity at baseline (S2 Table). Contamination of the stan-
dard care group was low; six participants reported wearing silk clothing during the trial
(including one participant who was allocated to the standard care group but was sent the silk
clothing in error; this participant was included in the analysis according to randomised
allocation).
Acceptability of the garments as assessed at 6 mo suggested that 85/121 (70%) participants
were satisfied or very satisfied with the clothing (95% CI 61% to 78%), and 89/121 (74%)

 participants were either happy or very happy to wear the garments (95% CI 64% to 81%).
Some participants raised concerns about the garments, including poor durability and fit.
Research nurses remained blinded to treatment allocation for 289/300 (96%) of partici-
pants. Unblinding occurred for three participants in the standard care group and eight in the
intervention group.

 Primary outcome
For the primary outcome of eczema severity, there was no difference between the groups in
the nurse-assessed EASI scores. For EASI scores averaged over the 2-, 4-, and 6-mo follow-up
visits, the adjusted ratio of geometric means was 0.95, with 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07 (p = 0.43)
(Table 2; Fig 3). This confidence interval equates to a difference of approximately −1.5 to 0.5
points in the original EASI units.
All sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome (adjusting for additional baseline factors,
imputing missing values, and exploring the impact of adherence [CACE analysis]) were sup-
portive of the primary analysis (S3 Table). There was no differential effect of the clothing on
EASI score (eczema severity) according to FLG subgroup (S4 Table) or severity of eczema at
baseline (S5 Table).
Secondary and safety outcomes
For the secondary outcomes, there were no between-group differences in nurse-assessed
eczema severity (IGA, TIS), quality of life (DFI, EQ-5D-3L, CHU-9D), or medication use
(percentage of days eczema medications used, escalation of eczema treatment) (Tables 2 and
3). However, small differences were observed for two of the participant-reported secondary
outcomes of eczema severity (PGA, POEM) (Tables 2 and 3; Fig 4). Safety outcomes (number
of skin infections and hospitalizations due to eczema) were similar in the two groups
(Table 4).
Cost-effectiveness
The economic evaluation included all participants with complete resource use and ADQoL
data at baseline and 6 mo (n = 273). The cost of a single set of tops and leggings ranged from
£66.02 to £155.49, depending on the size of the child. The mean cost of silk garments for 6 mo,

 including initial and replacement garments, was £318.52 (SD £136.60) per participant in the
base case (Table 5). The mean number of sets of garments (tops and leggings) per participant
in the base case was 4.15 (SD 1.56). Sixty-one (45.54%) intervention participants received
replacement garments over the 6 mo.
Combined with wider health resource use, the adjusted mean difference in cost per partici-
pant was £364.94 (95% CI £217.47 to £512.42, p < 0.001) for those who received silk garments
compared to those who did not in the base case (Table 5). The difference in total costs between
groups reflects the cost of the intervention; wider NHS costs were not significantly different
between groups (£48.57 higher per participant on average in the intervention group, 95% CI −
£105.92 to £203.05, p = 0.537). For resource use and costs for all resource items, see S6 and S7
Tables.
The adjusted mean difference in QALY per participant was 0.0064 (95% CI −0.0004 to
0.0133, p = 0.07) (Table 5). The adjusted incremental cost per QALY was £56,811, suggesting
that silk garments for AE are not cost-effective using currently accepted thresholds. At a will-
ingness to pay of £30,000 per QALY, the probability of silk garments being cost-effective was
12.13%. This conclusion did not change in sensitivity analysis testing an alternative approach
to costing the silk garments. Although the cost of silk garments was reduced with the alterna-
tive approach, at £53,989 per QALY, the estimated incremental cost per QALY was still over
the accepted NICE threshold value (see S8 Table).

 Discussion
Main findings
This trial found little evidence of clinical or economic benefit of using silk garments in addi-
tion to standard care, compared with standard care alone, in children with moderate to severe
eczema. There were no differences between the treatment groups for any of the outcomes that
were assessed by research nurses, who were unaware of participants’ treatment allocation, and
the percentage of days on which topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors were used did
not differ between the groups. The 95% confidence intervals around the primary efficacy esti-
mates were narrow, suggesting that a clinically important treatment effect is unlikely to have
been missed, and sensitivity analyses (imputing missing values, adjusting for baseline imbal-
ances, and exploring the impact of adherence in wearing the garments) supported the primary
analysis.
Subgroup analysis based on FLG genotype showed no evidence of differential treatment
response in children with an inherited impairment in skin barrier function, and a post hoc
analysis exploring the impact of baseline eczema severity on the primary outcome showed no
effect, suggesting that children with more severe disease were no more likely to benefit from
silk clothing than those with milder disease.
The trial garments are marketed as possessing antimicrobial properties, but this study
found no evidence to suggest a reduction in the number of skin infections in those using the
clothing compared to those randomised to standard care alone.
Of the seven unblinded secondary outcomes, two (POEM and PGA) showed small differ-
ences in favour of the silk garments, most noticeably in the first 3 mo of the trial. Whilst these
small differences could have been genuine, they are most likely due to an expectation bias that

 declined with time. Our nested qualitative study (to be reported separately) highlighted the
hopes that both children and parents placed on the silk clothing [11]. A previous eczema trial
reported differences between blinded and unblinded outcomes when expectation regarding
the benefits of the trial intervention was high [36].
Relevance to other studies
To our knowledge, there have been no further RCTs on the effectiveness of silk garments for
eczema since the CLOTHES Trial began (search updated 14 March 2016), and meta-analysis
of the available silk clothing trials is not possible due to heterogeneity of designs. Additional
brands of silk garments have since become available for use in eczema (e.g., Skinnies), but
these have not been formally evaluated in RCTs. At the time of commissioning this research
(2011), £840,272 was spent on prescriptions for silk garments per annum in the UK (for all
indications). By 2014, this amount had risen to £2,082,810 per annum [37–40].
Strengths and limitations
The CLOTHES Trial was an adequately powered RCT, with high follow-up rates and good
adherence. The pragmatic study design meant that use of silk garments was evaluated as they

 might be used in normal practice, with mixed patterns of adherence. The trial placed special
emphasis on objective outcome measures in order to minimise response bias.
It is possible that our emphasis on objective eczema severity outcomes meant that some
important potential benefits were not captured in the primary analysis. Other factors, such as
improvements in quality of life or a reduction in symptoms (especially itch and sleep loss, as
measured by POEM), may be important drivers in determining whether or not patients feel
that the garments are helpful. Nevertheless, we found no evidence of improved quality of life
amongst trial participants using a range of validated scales.

Silk garments for treating eczema: CLOTHES Trial
PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002280
April 11, 2017
18 / 23
 Eczema severity scores improved for both groups during the trial, probably due to a combi-
nation of regression to the mean and regular monitoring of the eczema resulting in enhanced
adherence to standard care. It is possible that treatment effects were masked by these general
trial effects.
Generalisability
The study has strong external validity as it was pragmatic in design to reflect normal clinical
practice, and participants were recruited from five UK medical centres covering a range of
urban and rural settings. We recruited children with a range of eczema severities, but the
majority had moderate to severe disease; 32% had at least one mutation in the FLG gene, a pro-
portion typical of eczema patents with moderate or severe disease [36]. Overall, 49% had self-
reported food allergy, which is high for children with moderate to severe disease, and 15%
reported a history of anaphylaxis. However, these data were collected by self-report and so
may include food intolerance as well as food allergy.
We are unable to comment on the effectiveness of the silk garments if used continuously
day and night, although sensitivity analysis found no evidence of improved outcomes in those
who adhered more fully in wearing the garments. It is also possible that the beneficial effects of
silk garments are best realised during a period of eczema flare, and daily use of the garments in
the CLOTHES trial could have led to more rapid deterioration of the clothing than might have
been seen if the garments were worn occasionally when the eczema was at its worst.
Conclusion
This is the first large, independent trial to have evaluated silk garments for the management of
eczema. The nested economic evaluation suggests that use of these garments is unlikely to be
cost-effective for health providers, even if the small observed benefits were genuine. These trial
results provide health commissioners with a better evidence base on which to make informed
decisions about silk garments for eczema. Whether or not parents feel that the small benefits
identified in some of the secondary outcomes are sufficient to justify purchasing these gar-
ments is something for individuals to consider on a case-by-case basis.
