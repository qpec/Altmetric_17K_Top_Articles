Summary
Background Agricultural pesticide self-poisoning is a major public health problem in rural Asia. The use of safer 
household pesticide storage has been promoted to prevent deaths, but there is no evidence of effectiveness. We aimed 
to test the effectiveness of lockable household containers for prevention of pesticide self-poisoning.
Methods We did a community-based, cluster-randomised controlled trial in a rural area of North Central Province, 
Sri Lanka. Clusters of households were randomly assigned (1:1), with a sequence computer-generated by a minimisation 
process, to intervention or usual practice (control) groups. Intervention households that had farmed or had used or 
stored pesticide in the preceding agricultural season were given a lockable storage container. Further promotion of use 
of the containers was restricted to community posters and 6-monthly reminders during routine community meetings. 
The primary outcome was incidence of pesticide self-poisoning in people aged 14 years or older during 3 years of 
follow-up. Identification of outcome events was done by staff who were unaware of group allocation. Analysis was by 
intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT1146496. 
Findings Between Dec 31, 2010, and Feb 2, 2013, we randomly assigned 90 rural villages to the intervention group and 
90 to the control group. 27 091 households (114 168 individuals) in the intervention group and 26 291 households 
(109 693 individuals) in the control group consented to participate. 20 457 household pesticide storage containers 
were distributed. In individuals aged 14 years or older, 611 cases of pesticide self-poisoning had occurred by 3 years in 
the intervention group compared with 641 cases in the control group; incidence of pesticide self-poisoning did not 
differ between groups (293·3 per 100 000 person-years of follow-up in the intervention group vs 318·0 per 100 000 in 
the control group; rate ratio [RR] 0·93, 95% CI 0·80–1·08; p=0·33). We found no evidence of switching from pesticide 
self-poisoning to other forms of self-harm, with no significant difference in the number of fatal (82 in the intervention 
group vs 67 in the control group; RR 1·22, 0·88–1·68]) or non-fatal (1135 vs 1153; RR 0·97, 0·86–1·08) self-harm 
events involving all methods.
Interpretation We found no evidence that means reduction through improved household pesticide storage reduces 
pesticide self-poisoning. Other approaches, particularly removal of highly hazardous pesticides from agricultural 
practice, are likely to be more effective for suicide prevention in rural Asia.

Introduction
Pesticide self-poisoning is a major public health problem 
in rural Asia1,2 and a substantial burden on health 
services.3 A systematic review4 of data from 2006–15 
showed that an estimated 89% of all global suicides from 
pesticide self-poisoning occurred in the Asian and 
Western Pacific regions. WHO recognises pesticide 
ingestion to be one of the three most important means of 
suicide worldwide.2,4 In Sri Lanka, self-poisoning with 
pesticides is the most common method of self-harm in 
many rural districts,5 highly lethal,6 associated with 
impulsivity,7–9 and the fifth leading cause of death 
in 2012.10
Means restriction is a key element of suicide prevention 
strategies.11–13 Restricting access to common and highly 
lethal methods of suicide can reduce both method-
specific and all-cause suicide rates.14–16 Such approaches 
for pesticide self-poisoning include administrative 
interventions 
altering 
behaviour 
(particularly 
the 
purchase, use, and storage of pesticides) and inter-
ventions altering the availability of highly hazardous 
pesticides in the community (through regulatory action 
to remove such pesticides from agricultural practice).17 
Interventions working at the patient level, to improve 
provision of medical care in resource-poor hospitals, are 
difficult for the most common pesticides used for suicide

(organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides, and 
paraquat);18,19 it is unlikely that improved care will be a 
highly effective approach to suicide prevention.
WHO, the pesticide industry, and the International 
Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) have advocated 
the use of improved household and community storage, 
with locked boxes or lockers, to prevent pesticide self-
poisoning as part of an overall suicide prevention 
strategy, termed “safer storage”.20 Findings from pilot 
studies of improved household storage in Sri Lanka21,22 
and China20 and studies of community lockers in India23 
suggest that the approach is appreciated by farming 
communities. However, the trials were pilot in nature 
and not designed to assess effectiveness; additionally, 
repeated interaction with the communities to assess use 
of the storage devices might have affected their 
utilisation.
Domestic locked boxes can result in pesticides being 
brought into the home from the field where they are 
often stored, potentially increasing the risk of self-
poisoning. This problem is exacerbated because locking 
of boxes reduces over time; households might also find it 
difficult to keep the key hidden from vulnerable 
household members.21,24 Real world use of community 
lockers is uncertain because they often require farmers 
to walk away from their fields towards the store in the 
centre of the village, and a second person to be present 
for the locker to be opened.23
In view of the paucity of evidence for effectiveness of 
safer storage of pesticides and the potential for increased 
risk of harm, we aimed to test the effectiveness of 
household pesticide storage containers in a large 
community-based, cluster-randomised controlled trial.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a community-based, cluster-randomised con-
trolled trial of a lockable pesticide storage container in a 
rural area of Sri Lanka. A description of the study design 
and methods has been published elsewhere.25 The 
study 
was 
done 
in 
the 
Anuradhapura 
District 
(population 855 562, census 2011) of Sri Lanka’s North 
Central Province (figure 1). We recruited geographical 
clusters of households primarily from the Mahaweli H 
irrigation region, including the divisional secretariats of 
Thambuttegama, 
Thalawa, 
Galnewa, 
Rajanganaya, 
Ipolagama, and Nochchiyagama, because of the high use 
of pesticides in agriculture and high incidence of pesticide 
self-poisoning in this region. All communities within the 
study area were eligible for participation apart from those 
recruited to our previous pilot studies (1026 households).22,24 
The chief village official (Grama Niladhari) was 
approached to seek consent for community enrolment; 
individual household verbal consent was then sought at 
the start of each household survey. 
At enrolment, adult householders present in the home 
were interviewed about household sociodemographic 
information, current pesticide use and storage practices, 
and 
previous 
history 
of 
self-harm 
and 
alcohol 
consumption. Household global positioning system 
(GPS) coordinates were recorded with a Juno device 
(Trimble 
Inc, 
USA).26 
The 
questionnaire 
was 
administered by young adults, mostly from and familiar 
with the local area, in the local language, after training 
and with regular audit. Additional details of this interview 
process and quality control have been published 
elsewhere.25,27
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, 
and May 1, 2017, with the search terms (((“pesticide”) AND 
“storage”) AND “intervention”). 12 references were retrieved but 
none reported randomised controlled trials or systematic 
reviews. A further search of the internet using general search 
engines with keywords “safe storage” AND “intervention” 
identified pilot studies of pesticide storage in Sri Lanka, China, 
and India, as well as the WHO report on safer access to pesticides 
for suicide prevention. These studies highlighted the potential 
for improved storage on the basis of the acceptability of such 
devices in the community. Additional searches of “pesticide” 
AND “poisoning” identified four randomised controlled studies 
that focused on clinical management of poisoning. To our 
knowledge, no effectiveness studies of pesticide storage to 
prevent pesticide poisoning have been done.
Added value of this study
This study is the first effectiveness trial of improved pesticide 
storage to prevent pesticide poisoning. The provision of a 
lockable storage container to householders was designed 
through discussion and pilot studies to be robust and 
acceptable to farming communities. Our study tested the 
effectiveness of pesticide storage at a population level to 
determine if this intervention could make a significant 
contribution to reducing pesticide poisoning in rural Asian 
communities.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of our study show that improved pesticide storage 
in households is not an effective intervention to prevent 
pesticide self-poisoning, despite its community acceptability. 
Our research counters the current policy approaches 
advocating improved storage of pesticides to reduce 
intentional pesticide poisoning. Only withdrawal of the most 
highly hazardous pesticides from agricultural practice has 
been shown to reduce deaths from pesticide poisoning. Global 
public health efforts should focus on this approach to rapidly 
reduce pesticide suicides worldwide.

There were no substantial changes to the protocol after 
the trial started. We initially planned to collect case data 
from both village level public health midwives and small 
rural peripheral hospitals. However, early pilot work, 
before the distribution of lockable containers, showed 
the difficulties of midwives as sources of case data and 
additional resources were deployed at peripheral hospital 
units. The results of the end of study demographic survey 
showed this strategy to be highly effective (see 
discussion). Another change to the protocol was a 
reduction in the proportion of the study sample that 
received the end of study demographic survey from 
100% to 26%, for logistical reasons.
Ethics approval was received from the research ethics 
committees of the University of Peradeniya and Rajarata 
University of Sri Lanka. The study was approved by the 
Provincial Department of Health Services, North Central 
Province, and the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health. A data 
monitoring committee was established for the trial and a 
charter written. No formal stopping rules or interim 
analyses were planned. The data monitoring committee 
was responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial 
participants and monitoring the quality of the research.
Randomisation and masking
Clusters of households were the unit of randomisation 
for this study (median number of households per 
cluster 272 [IQR 207–344]). For logistical reasons, 
clusters were grouped into ten bands. Clusters were 
delineated after completion of household surveys in 
each band. Cluster boundaries were not based on civil 
village boundaries alone because some villages were 
closely intertwined, increasing the risk of contamination. 
To increase geographical separation, and reduce the risk 
of contamination between clusters caused by, for 
example, the onward sale of unused storage containers, 
we actively identified natural and social boundaries 
between 
communities. 
This 
approach 
included 
identifying patterns of social interaction between 
communities, geographical features such as irrigation 
canals, roads, and forests, as well as means of and 
reasons for access such as transport to commercial 
areas, schools, and temples. Random allocation of 
clusters within each band to the intervention or control 
groups was done by a person not involved in 
recruitment, intervention, or monitoring, with a 
bespoke 
computer 
program 
written 
in 
Stata. 
Minimisation was used to reduce imbalance between 
groups in the number of clusters allocated to each 
group, number of individuals in households eligible for 
a pesticide storage container, and rate of previous 
pesticide self-poisoning in the cluster. A random aspect 
was maintained in the minimisation, which prevented 
allocations being anticipated.25

To maintain masking and minimise bias, we had 
separate study teams for recruitment, randomisation, 
intervention, outcome data collection, outcome linkage, 
and analysis, with limited interaction.25 Identification of 
outcome events was done by staff who were unaware of 
group allocation. 
Procedures
After 
randomisation, 
the 
Grama 
Niladharis 
in 
intervention clusters were informed and arrangements 
made for the distribution of lockable pesticide storage 
containers to eligible households. Households were 
deemed eligible if they farmed or had used or stored 
pesticides in the preceding agricultural season. To 
encourage compliance and reduce the risks associated 
with bringing pesticides into the home, we took care to 
design a container acceptable to the community24,25 that 
could be positioned outside the house. The design of the 
lockable storage container was informed by discussion 
with the local communities and 4 years of piloting.24 The 
container was made from ultraviolet-resistant plastic 
(appendix); we recommended that it be buried in the 
ground for security.25 The container had two lids to 
protect the lock and the contents, respectively, against 
moisture. Each container had 20 cm anchors extending 
sideways from the bottom to prevent it being pulled up 
out of the ground. A small community demonstration 
was given to recipients to promote the correct installation 
and use of the container. Substantial efforts were made 
to ensure that containers were installed; farmers were 
given a choice as to their preferred location for the 
container—ie, in their fields, home garden, or house. 
Researchers subsequently visited households to ensure 
installation in all eligible households. Further promotion 
of use of the containers after distribution was restricted 
to posters hung up in intervention communities and 
6-monthly presentations at community farmer meetings. 
No contact was made with households for 3 years, apart 
from those in the five sub-villages (605 households, 2% 
of intervention households) randomly chosen from 
intervention clusters to study use of the lockable 
containers. Households in the control group received no 
intervention. 
Data on cases of fatal and non-fatal pesticide self-
poisoning, accidental poisoning, and all forms of non-fatal 
and fatal self-harm were prospectively collected from 
several sources. Most patients with poisoning or self-harm 
presented first to small peripheral hospitals (median 
number of beds 42 [range 12–133]) spread across the 
district (figure 1). After triage and treatment, some patients 
were transferred to a secondary level hospital within the 
study area (Thambuttegama) or the main Anuradhapura 
District tertiary level hospital (Anuradhapura Teaching 
Hospital). Patients admitted for poisoning or self-harm to 
the two main hospitals were identified by research 
assistants attending the medical wards daily, and checking 
admissions to surgical, paediatric, and intensive care 
wards on a weekly basis, and the Anuradhapura Teaching 
Hospital morgue at the end of follow-up.
All remaining peripheral hospitals (n=9) within the 
study area were visited at least every other day by 
researchers to identify poisoning or self-harm admissions. 
Cases were identified by researchers who were not aware 
of the person’s allocation. Field research officers also 
visited hospitals situated just outside the study area (n=2, 
figure 1) to identify cases that had bypassed the local 
hospital, through checks of the admission and transfer 
books and discussion with relevant staff. During the 
study, we built up close relationships with medical and 
nursing staff in the peripheral hospitals, resulting in 
researchers often being telephoned when cases presented 
to these hospitals. Private inpatient care is restricted in 
the district; our previous surveys of these hospitals 
suggested that patients who self-harm did not seek care in 
these facilities.28
Deaths that occurred before hospital presentation were 
identified by regular review of the records of local 
coroners and police. At the end of the study, we sought 
additional cases by examination of records belonging to 
local magistrates and district coroners.
After identification of a case, a researcher obtained 
demographic and address data from the medical records, 
the patient, or a relative. The researcher did not enquire 
about the presence of pesticide containers in the case’s 
household to sustain masking to allocation. These

data were shared by telephone with a case-matching 
researcher in a central office who searched for the person 
on the baseline survey database and allocated the case to 
a unique household or individual study identifier. If 
necessary, the researcher re-contacted the patient or 
relative in hospital, or rarely in their village if the patient 
had been discharged, to obtain further information to 
allow matching to baseline records. Again, no effort was 
made to identify whether the household had a pesticide 
storage container. The case-matching researcher had no 
role in randomisation, container distribution, case 
follow-up, or data collection.
Follow-up to identify study endpoints was started after 
the first round of container distribution in each band and 
continued until 3 years after the last round of distribution. 
After completion of 3 years of follow-up, a repeat 
household survey was done in 13 999 (26%) households to 
estimate migration in and out of the area during the study, 
and to assess the use and locking of pesticide containers.
To assess adherence during the 3 years of follow-up, 
five sub-villages in five intervention clusters were 
selected at random from across the study area for annual 
review of use of the pesticide containers. Each village was 
visited twice during the study, use of containers recorded, 
and household opinions on their usefulness elicited 
through a survey and focus groups.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the incidence of pesticide self-
poisoning, whether fatal or non-fatal, in individuals aged 
14 years or older, during a 3-year follow-up period starting 
from completion of container distribution to each band 
(follow-up was staggered across bands). Secondary 
outcomes were the incidence of pesticide poisoning in 
children (aged <14 years), pesticide poisoning in general 
(deliberate and accidental, all ages), self-poisoning (all 
substances, fatal and non-fatal, age ≥14 years), non-fatal 
self-harm (all methods, age ≥14 years), fatal self-harm (all 
methods, age ≥14 years), non-fatal non-pesticide self-
poisoning (age ≥14 years), and fatal non-pesticide 
self-poisoning (age ≥14 years).
Statistical analysis
We have previously justified the sample size target in 
detail.25 Assuming a primary outcome incidence of 175 per 
100 000 person-years in the control group, and an inflation 
factor of 1·75 to accommodate the clustered design, further 
accommodating contamination and non-use of safe 
storage containers, at least 217 944 person-years of follow-
up in each study group (approximately 24 216 households; 
81 clusters per group; 162 in total) would give 80% power 
to detect a 33% reduction to 117 events per 100 000 person-
years in the intervention group.
The main analysis was prespecified in a signed and 
dated (Aug 23, 2016) statistical analysis plan that was 
made publicly available before release of the data for 
analysis. The primary analysis followed the intention-to-
treat principle, comparing the observed incidence of self-
poisoning with pesticides between individuals in clusters 
allocated to the intervention group, and individuals in 
clusters allocated to the control group. A random effect 
Poisson regression model was used, accommodating 
variation between clusters in the primary outcome 
incidence as a gamma distribution. This analysis was 
adjusted for the minimisation variables—ie, number of 
individuals in households eligible for a lockable storage 
container and rate of previous pesticide self-poisoning in 
the cluster, both included as a trend term across three 
tertiles. This approach was adapted to each of the 
secondary outcomes.
Prespecified subgroup analyses investigated whether 
the effectiveness of the intervention was modified by the 
cluster-level historical rate of self-poisoning, the cluster-
level proportion of households reporting a member 
having problems with alcohol (both established in 
the baseline survey), the cluster-level proportion of 
households provided with a lockable box, and the year of 
follow-up. For each of these analyses in turn interaction 
terms were generated, distinguishing the subgroups in 
the intervention and control groups, and these were 
added to the statistical model to test the evidence that the 
intervention effect varied by subgroup. We did a

Results
Between Dec 31, 2010, and Feb 2, 2013, we enrolled 
180 clusters, of which 90 were randomly assigned to the 
intervention group and 90 to the control group (figure 2). 
Follow-up started on July 29, 2011, with distribution of 
lockable pesticide storage containers to the first band, 
and finished on May 12, 2016, 3 years after distribution of 
containers to the tenth band.
53 382 households (comprising 223 861 individuals) gave 
consent to participate. Measures of socioeconomic status, 
number of households, pesticide use, and reported history 
of pesticide self-harm and alcohol use were well balanced 
between the two groups (table 1). 87 751 individuals aged 
14 years or older in the intervention group and 84 469 in the 
control group were followed up for cases. During the 
3 years of the trial, migration was modest with an estimated 
5% (1570 of 29 355) and 6% (1668 of 29 670) of the 
population migrating in, and 11% (3168 of 29 355) and 11% 
(3352 of 29 670) of the population migrating away, in the 
intervention and control areas, respectively.
Pesticide storage containers were distributed to 
20 457  households. At the 2-week check, 19 534 (95%) 
containers were installed within the home compound, 
41 (<1%) within the home, and 738 (4%) in the field. The 
location of 144 (1%) containers was unknown or they had 
been returned. At the end of 3 years of follow-up, surveys 
of 6937 (26%) of 27 091 households in the intervention 
group showed that 4264 (61%) households were storing 
pesticides and 3698 (53%) were locking pesticides away 
sometimes or always. Surveys of 7062 (27%) of 
26 291 households in the control group showed that a 
similar number (3681 [52%]) were storing pesticides but 
only 351 (5%) households were locking pesticides away 
sometimes or always. Data from 605 households in the 
five villages in which container use was assessed 
(number of households eligible for container 52, 78, 104, 
171, and 208, respectively) showed that self-reported use 
of the locked containers was 72% (367 of 507) after 1 year 
and 76% (339 of 448) after 2 years.
We recorded 1252 cases of pesticide self-poisoning in 
individuals aged 14 years or older from the study area 
during the 3 years of follow-up. Of these 1252 cases, 
1077 (86%) were matched to an individual participating in 
the baseline survey, 92 (7%) to households (either new 
members of the household or individuals missed in the 
baseline survey), and 83 (7%) were cluster matches (we 
were unable to match them exactly to a house, knowing 
only their cluster—and therefore allocation to intervention 
or control group). Of the cases matched to individuals, 
516 cases occurred in 500 individuals in the intervention 
group (15 [3%] individuals had more than one episode), 
and 561 cases occurred in 547 individuals in the control 
group (12 [2%] individuals had more than one episode).
1931 records were collected for the 1252 cases of 
pesticide self-poisoning. Of these records, 1203 (62%) 
were identified in peripheral hospital records, 646 (34%) 
in Teaching Hospital records, and 82 (4%) in records 
from the police or coroner. We observed no difference 
between study groups in the source of data collection for 
cases. 11 deaths that occurred before hospital presentation 
were identified by review of the records of local coroners 
and seven by review of police records. 11 deaths that 
occurred before hospital presentation were identified in

routine monitoring during the surveillance period and 
an additional six cases at the end of the 3 year follow-up.
There were fewer cases of pesticide self-poisoning in 
the intervention group (611 cases) than in the control 
group (641 cases; table 2); the incidence of pesticide self-
poisoning in individuals aged 14 years or older did not 
differ between groups (293·3 per 100 000 person-years of 
follow-up in the intervention group vs 318·0 per 100 000 
in the control group; rate ratio 0·93, 95% CI 0·80–1·08; 
p=0·33). In a sensitivity analysis, there was no effect of 
including or excluding the five villages in which there 
was greater researcher presence while use of the 
containers was assessed (appendix).
We found no evidence that the effect of lockable 
container provision differed according to the historical 
incidence of pesticide self-poisoning, the proportion of 
households reporting a member with a problem with 
alcohol use, or the proportion of households using 
pesticides (and therefore eligible for a container) in each 
cluster, with clusters grouped by tertiles (table 3). There 
was no evidence of a change over time in the effectiveness 
of the containers (table 3, figure 3). 
In the end of study demographic survey of 13 999 (26%) 
households in four bands, 147 episodes of pesticide self-
poisoning were reported by households. As a quality-
control exercise, we attempted to match these cases to 
our prospective follow-up. Only six (4%, three in each 
group) of these cases could not be matched and were 
judged as being missed by the follow-up because of 
presentation to hospitals outside the study area and 
residents who maintained multiple addresses. Notably, 
our prospective follow-up identified 634 cases of pesticide 
self-poisoning in these four bands, about four times 
more than self-reported by households.
The design effect for the analysis of the primary 
outcome was estimated as the ratio of the squared 
standard errors for the intervention effect estimates from 
the random effect Poisson regression model and the 
standard Poisson regression model, both including 
covariates for the person-years of follow-up contributed 
by individuals in households eligible for a lockable 
container, and historical rate of pesticide self-poisoning 
in the cluster. This gave an estimate of the design effect 
of 1·75, identical to that allowed for in the sample size 
calculation. 
We found no evidence that the intervention caused a 
switch from pesticide self-poisoning to other forms of 
self-harm. The incidence of fatal and non-fatal self-harm 
events involving all methods in people aged 14 years or 
older did not differ between the intervention and control 
groups (table 3). There was also no evidence of switching 
from pesticide self-poisoning to other forms of self-
poisoning (non-fatal or fatal). We noted no substantial 
increase in other common forms of self-harm (hanging, 
burning, cutting; table 4).
Pesticide poisoning in children younger than 14 years 
was rare, with only 18 cases in the intervention group 
and 15 cases in the control group recorded during the 
3 years of follow-up (incidence 21·8 per 100 000 person-
years of follow-up in the control group vs 25·0 per 100 000

Discussion
Means restriction is an effective approach to suicide 
prevention.29 Small pilot studies have shown that 
improved pesticide storage, with household or community 
storage systems, is acceptable to farming communities 
and possibly effective.21,22 As a result, improved storage 
has been widely promoted by civil society, industry, and 
international multilateral agencies. However, results of 
this large pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial 
showed that improved household storage of pesticides 
did not reduce the incidence of pesticide self-poisoning 
during 3 years of follow-up.
Improved storage is a very active form of prevention, 
requiring persistent and lifelong effort by individuals 
and families to store pesticides away after purchase and 
use, to keep key(s) hidden, to replace locks when 
damaged or the key lost, and to replace damaged 
containers. Our analysis of five sentinel villages showed 
that self-reported use of locked containers was 72% by 
1 year; by 3 years, surveys of households in the 
intervention group showed that 53% were still using the 
container and locking it. Repeated reminders to 
households might sustain effective use; this approach 
has been used in some previous pilot studies. However, 
this strategy will not be sustainable if expanded to 
generalised public health use. For this reason, other than 
the five sentinel villages, we did not access clusters after 
the installation check 2 weeks after distribution, relying 
on community posters and routine farming meetings to 
encourage use. However, a failure of reminders does not 
seem to have been pivotal because we found no evidence 
that the containers were more effective in the first year 
after distribution compared with the third year.
To reduce contamination across the study, we ensured 
that the containers were installed in the ground to 
reduce the risk of them being sold on to families in non-
intervention clusters;25 the low number of households in 
the control areas with pesticides locked away in non-
study containers in the end of study demographic 
survey suggests that the idea of locking up pesticides 
did not effectively pass from intervention to control 
areas. We took account of possible contamination, and 
non-use of containers in intervention clusters, by 
substantially increasing the size of the study. The 
number of cases detected was higher than expected in 
our initial power calculations (crude population 
incidence 871 per 100 000 over 3 years vs 525 per 100 000 
over 3 years estimated in our power calculations), 
further increasing the study power, thus ensuring that 
the study had sufficient power to detect an effect of 
magnitude important to public health.
Introduction of means restriction might result in 
method substitution, possibly to methods of suicide with 
higher case fatality (such as hanging). We found no 
evidence of increased rates of self-harm from other 
methods or non-pesticide forms of self-poisoning. The 
provision of the lockable container did not appear to 
increase the risk of self-harm because of farmers 
bringing pesticides into the home compound. There was 
a small, non-significant increase in the rate of fatal self-
harm in the intervention clusters. It remains possible 
that provision of household storage containers might 
increase the incidence of higher lethality methods such 
as hanging, but the incidence of this method remained 
low in this study.
Our study has some limitations. We might have missed 
some non-fatal self-harm cases by using peripheral 
hospitals as the primary source of data. However, 
previous work in the North Central Province has 
suggested that nearly all cases of self-harm in rural areas 
are brought to small rural hospitals.30 Furthermore, we

have no evidence that there was differential hospital 
presentation between the two groups of the study and the 
cases substantially exceeded the predicted rate.
The research staff involved in outcome ascertainment 
were, as far as possible, kept masked to the trial allocation 
of each participant’s village (cluster) of residence. 
However, this was not absolute because when presenting 
to hospital a few patients reported taking pesticides from 
a study container. To control this possible source of bias, 
we maintained multiple separate study teams with 
limited interactions.
This study only assessed the use of household-based 
storage containers, not community-based locker storage 
systems as proposed by some advocates.23 However, it 
seems likely that compliance with a central community 
locker would be poorer in real life than compliance with 
household storage, since the former will require farmers 
to go away from their fields, towards the town centre to 
obtain pesticides.
Prevention of pesticide suicides is multi-layered, 
requiring work at individual, community, and population 
levels.2,31 Means restriction is a key element of suicide 
prevention strategies, working at the community and 
regulatory levels.29 Unfortunately, our findings show that 
improved household storage of pesticides is unlikely to 
be effective. Individual level interventions will be 
administrative and active, requiring active choices by 
individuals to lower their risk. Improving medical care 
will prevent some deaths.31 However, this approach is 
difficult for the most commonly used pesticides because 
of the absence of new effective therapies, and the scarcity 
of human resources and hospital facilities in regions 
with many patients.18,19 Another strategy that has been 
assessed is the addition of anti-emetics to paraquat 
formulations; however, this intervention only had a 
modest effect.32 Commentary on the study suggested that 
this was the wrong approach and that restricting access 
through regulation was likely to be more effective.33
Other interventions at the regulatory level, including 
replacing highly hazardous pesticides in agricultural 
practice with integrated pest management and alternative 
less hazardous pesticides, has major beneficial effects on 
both pesticide suicides and total suicides.34 Such regulatory 
action in Sri Lanka, for example, has resulted in a 
75% reduction in total suicides with an estimated 
93 000 lives saved over 20 years and little if any effect on 
agricultural yield.35–37 Similar data have come from 
South Korea38 and Bangladesh.39 Some data from China 
have shown the important role of urbanisation in the 
reduced suicide rate reported in this country.40 Urbanisation 
is occurring worldwide, but its effect is likely to reduce the 
population at risk and enhance means restriction 
interventions. Clearly, policy makers worldwide can best 
focus their means restriction efforts on working with 
agricultural colleagues to follow the Code of Conduct on 
Pesticide Management, assess the need for highly 
hazardous pesticides, and remove all that are not essential.40
