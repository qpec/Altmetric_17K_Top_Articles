BACKGROUND: A continuous relationship between reductions in low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has 
been observed in statin and ezetimibe outcomes trials down to achieved levels of 
54 mg/dL. However, it is uncertain whether this relationship extends to LDL-C levels 
<50 mg/dL. We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non–high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 reductions and MACE 
among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls 
(placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.
METHODS: Data were pooled from 10 double-blind trials (6699 patient-years of 
follow-up). Randomization was to alirocumab 75/150 mg every 2 weeks or control 
for 24 to 104 weeks, added to background statin therapy in 8 trials. This analysis 
included 4974 patients (3182 taking alirocumab, 1174 taking placebo, 618 taking 
ezetimibe). In a post hoc analysis, the relationship between average on-treatment 
lipid levels and percent reductions in lipids from baseline were correlated with 
MACE (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic 
stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: Overall, 33.1% of the pooled cohort achieved average LDL-C 
<50 mg/dL (44.7%–52.6% allocated to alirocumab, 6.5% allocated to ezetimibe, 
and 0% allocated to placebo). In total, 104 patients experienced MACE (median 
time to event, 36 weeks). For every 39 mg/dL lower achieved LDL-C, the risk of 
MACE appeared to be 24% lower (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.63–0.91; P=0.0025). Percent reductions in LDL-C from baseline were 
inversely correlated with MACE rates (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 
0.57–0.89 per additional 50% reduction from baseline; P=0.003). Strengths of 
association materially similar to those described for LDL-C were observed with 
achieved non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 levels 
or percentage reductions.
CONCLUSIONS: In a post hoc analysis from 10 ODYSSEY trials, greater 
percentage reductions in LDL-C and lower on-treatment LDL-C were associated 
with a lower incidence of MACE, including very low levels of LDL-C (<50 mg/dL). 
These findings require further validation in the ongoing prospective ODYSSEY 
OUTCOMES trial.

s
tatins have been the cornerstone of global lipid 
modification guidelines for the prevention of major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).1 With accu-
mulating evidence, each subsequent iteration of clinical 
guidelines has extended statin indications and recom-
mended the achievement of progressively lower low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals2–4 or, most 
recently, percentage reductions in LDL-C with the most 
potent statins.5 Recently, the IMPROVE-IT trial (Improved 
Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International 
Trial) demonstrated that further reductions in LDL-C 
to a mean of 54 mg/dL with a nonstatin lipid-lowering 
therapy in statin-treated individuals provided additional 
reductions in MACE,6 supporting the concept that lower 
LDL-C levels are better and consistent with observational 
data from several statin trials.7–9
Inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 
type 9 (PCSK9) offer the prospect of achieving even low-
er LDL-C levels than ezetimibe when added to statins. 
Data from the phase 3 ODYSSEY trial program, in which 
average achieved LDL-C levels of <50 mg/dL were ob-
served when alirocumab was added to statin therapy,10–12 
allow the exploration of changes in event rates at much 
lower LDL-C levels than previously analyzed.
In addition, percent reduction in LDL-C has been cit-
ed as being important in some guidelines,5,13,14 and be-
cause patients in the ODYSSEY trials have already had 
their LDL-C reduced by 30% to 50% with statins, these 
trials allow us to explore the relationship between further 
percentage reductions in LDL-C and risk. Therefore, we 
assessed whether the relationship between LDL-C and 
risk extends to very low levels of LDL-C (<50 mg/dL) 
in the ODYSSEY trial program. We hypothesized that, 
among patients already receiving maximally tolerated 
statin therapy, both lower achieved LDL-C and greater 
percentage reductions from baseline would translate 
into lower rates of MACE. Furthermore, because many 
guidelines increasingly recommend non–high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C) or apolipoprotein 
B100 (apoB) as potential alternatives to LDL-C for as-
sessing the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy, we pro-
vide similar analyses using these lipid parameters for 
comparison.4,15,16
MethODs
Patient Population
The phase 3 ODYSSEY trial designs have been reported previ-
ously.6,11,12,17–22 Patients were enrolled if they had established 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or high car-
diovascular risk such as heterozygous familial hypercholes-
terolemia with LDL-C inadequately controlled on their existing 
treatment (statin/other lipid-lowering therapy/diet). The main 
exclusion criteria were baseline LDL-C <70 mg/dL for those 
with ASCVD and very high risk and <100 mg/dL for high-risk 
patients without ASCVD at screening. Individuals with triglyc-
eride levels >400 mg/dL were excluded (for further details 
on inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Table I in the online-
only Data Supplement). For the present analysis, data were 
pooled from 10 phase 3 ODYSSEY trials (Figure I in the online-
only Data Supplement). Patients were randomized to receive 
alirocumab or control (placebo or ezetimibe) with double-blind 
treatment periods of 24 to 104 weeks. Six of the 10 studies, 
representing ≈80% of the population, had a minimum study 
duration of 52 weeks. All study protocols were approved by the 
relevant local independent review boards, and all participating 
patients provided written informed consent.
lipid Measurements
LDL-C was calculated with the Friedewald equation unless 
triglycerides were >400 mg/dL, when it was determined 
by β quantification. ApoB levels in serum were determined 
from immunonephelometry by a central laboratory (Medpace 
Reference Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH, and Leuven, Belgium, 
except for the LONG TERM study, which used Covance Central 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Cardiovascular benefits of statins and add-on lipid-
lowering therapy extend only to low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of ≈54 mg/dL. 
We investigated whether this relationship extends 
below 50 mg/dL using data from the ODYSSEY tri-
als of alirocumab (proprotein convertase subtilisin/
kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody) versus placebo/
ezetimibe.
• About half of alirocumab-treated patients achieved 
LDL-C <50 mg/dL. For each 39 mg/dL lower 
achieved LDL-C, MACE incidence fell by 24%, and 
50% reductions in LDL-C from baseline reduced 
MACE by 29%.
• Similar associations were observed with non–high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B 
achieved levels, percentage reductions, and MACE.
• Low LDL-C levels were not associated with excess 
treatment-emergent adverse events.
What are the clinical implications?
• These analyses provide further reassurance about 
the safety and cardiovascular benefit of achieving 
even further reductions in LDL-C with alirocumab 
beyond what was previously achieved with statins 
and ezetimibe.
• Limitations include the low number of events (104), 
the limited duration of the studies (24–104 weeks), 
and the post hoc nature of this analysis.
• If the forthcoming outcomes trials of PCSK9 inhibi-
tors such as alirocumab demonstrate additional 
reduction in MACE with further LDL-C reduction, then 
guideline committees may investigate lower LDL-C 
goals or a larger reduction in LDL-C from untreated 
baseline for those at highest risk of MACE.

Mace Definitions
MACE were defined as per the primary end point of the 
ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study23: coronary heart disease death, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or unstable 
angina requiring hospitalization. Cardiovascular events were 
adjudicated by a central Clinical Events Committee12 (The 
same committee is involved in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES 
trial23). Unstable angina considered here was limited to those 
with definite evidence of the ischemic condition; that is a small 
proportion of unstable angina events qualified (see the defini-
tion of unstable angina in the online-only Data Supplement).
statistical analysis
Baseline Characteristics and Distribution of Lipid 
Parameters
Baseline data were pooled for all randomized patients and 
presented stratified according to whether the studies were 
placebo controlled or ezetimibe controlled. For continuous 
variables, the data are reported as mean and SD or median 
and interquartile range if they were not normally distributed. 
The distribution of LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apoB levels at 
baseline and the average on-treatment levels or average 
percentage reductions in these parameters during the study 
treatment period are depicted graphically and analyzed 
with descriptive statistics comparing treatment groups (ali-
rocumab versus placebo or versus ezetimibe).These include 
only patients in the safety population, that is patients who 
were randomized and received at least 1 dose or part of a 
dose of study treatment.
lipid changes and risk of Mace
Regardless of treatment allocation, patients were pooled into 1 
overall cohort, and the relationship between LDL-C and MACE 
during the treatment period was assessed with  achieved 
LDL-C levels during treatment and percentage reductions in 
LDL-C from baseline. Average on-treatment LDL-C or the mean 
percentage reduction during the treatment period was deter-
mined from the area under the curve (using the trapezoidal 
method), taking into account all LDL-C values up to end of 
the treatment period or the occurrence of MACE, whichever 
came first.
The relation between on-treatment LDL-C and MACE was 
assessed with a multivariable Cox regression model with 
adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, history of myo-
cardial infarction or stroke, baseline LDL-C, and smoking sta-
tus, as previously published.24 Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for every 39 mg/dL 
lower LDL-C to provide a comparison with the CTT (Cholesterol 
Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration) meta-regression line.25 
Similar analyses were conducted for the percentage reduction 
in LDL-C from baseline and subsequent risk of MACE with HRs 
and 95% CIs expressed for each 50% reduction in LDL-C.
To assess the shape of association, the adjusted rates of 
MACE and associated 95% CIs were determined from a multi-
variate Poisson model and depicted graphically as a function of 
average LDL-C levels or average percentage reduction during 
treatment. Instead of using all available lipid measurements 
(average LDL-C levels or reductions), we conducted sensitivity 
analyses with only LDL-C values and percentage reduction at 
week 4 and subsequent events after the exclusion of events 
that occurred before week 4. Last, analyses similar to those 
described above were conducted for non–HDL-C or apoB. All 
analyses were generated with SAS version 9.4, and all tests 
and CIs were 2 sided.
safety analysis
For safety, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 
defined as those events occurring from the first dose of study 
treatment up to 70 days after the last dose. The principal 
analyses compared randomized treatment with alirocumab 
and control. We also explored the strength of association 
between any TEAE and LDL-C levels or percentage reductions 
in LDL-C using multivariable logistic regression, after adjust-
ing for the same covariates included in the MACE analyses. 
Data are reported as odds ratio and 95% CI per 39-mg/dL 
difference or 50% reduction in LDL-C. The shape of the asso-
ciation was also depicted graphically with adjusted TEAE rate 
and associated 95% CI plotted against average LDL-C levels 
or percentage LDL-C reductions derived from multivariate 
logistic regression models.

Baseline characteristics
The baseline characteristics of individual studies are 
shown in Table II in the online-only Data Supplement, 
and the pooled summary of placebo and ezetimibe 
comparator trials is shown in Table 1. In the placebo-
controlled trials, 2318 patients were treated with ali-
rocumab and 1174 were treated with placebo; in the 
ezetimibe-controlled trials, 864 were treated with ali-
rocumab and 618 were treated with ezetimibe. Hence, 
a total of 4974 patients were included in the lipid and 
MACE analyses described below. Overall, the average 
age was ≈60 years, with patients being mostly white 
and having an average body mass index of ≈30 kg/
m2. Approximately two thirds were male; one third had 
diabetes mellitus; two thirds had a history of ASCVD; 
and about one fifth were smokers. One third of partici-
pants in the placebo-controlled trials had heterozygous 
familial hypercholesterolemia.
Baseline lipids
Baseline lipid values for individual studies are reported 
in Table III in the online-only Data Supplement. Pooled 
mean baseline LDL-C levels ranged from 123.2 to 
126.8 mg/dL; non–HDL-C, between 154.2 and 156.9 
mg/dL; and apoB, between 101.8 and 104.3 mg/dL 
(Table 1). As expected, the distribution of baseline lip-
ids at randomization was fairly similar between the ali-
rocumab and control groups (Figure II in the online-only 
Data Supplement).

lipid levels During treatment
Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of different lipid pa-
rameters during treatment. The mean LDL-C levels 
achieved during treatment were as follows: in placebo-
controlled studies, 56.9 and 126.5 mg/dL among those 
treated with alirocumab and placebo, and in ezetimibe-
controlled studies, 64.0 and 100.9 mg/dL in those treat-
ed with alirocumab and ezetimibe, respectively (Table 2; 
individual trial data in Table IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Corresponding values for non–HDL-C and 
apoB are shown in Table 2. Similar results were obtained 
when week 4 achieved lipids were used instead of aver-
age levels throughout the entire study duration (Table V 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
Overall, 33.1% of patients achieved an average LDL-
C <50 mg/dL during treatment. In placebo-controlled 
studies, 52.6% of alirocumab-treated and 0% of place-
bo-treated patients achieved LDL-C levels <50 mg/dL. 
In the ezetimibe-controlled studies, the corresponding 
figures were 44.7% for the alirocumab and 6.5% for 
the ezetimibe arm, respectively. Thus, when all patients 
were pooled, the overall distribution of each lipid param-
eter during treatment largely reflected the greater pro-
portion of patients achieving very low levels of LDL-C, 
non–HDL-C, and apoB in the alirocumab group (Figure III 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
Percent reductions in lipids From Baseline
Figure 2 depicts the distribution of the average percent-
age change from baseline in LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and 
apoB during the trials. The average percentage change 
in LDL-C from baseline during treatment was −55.4% for

trials and −48.1% with alirocumab and −18.0% with 
ezetimibe in ezetimibe-controlled trials (Table 2; individ-
ual trial data in Table IV in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). Corresponding results for non–HDL-C and apoB 
are shown in Table 2 and Table IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement. When week 4 percentage reductions were 
assessed rather than the average reductions over the 
course of the trial, similar values were observed (Table V

bution plot (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement)

achieved LDL-C levels (Figure 3; adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% 
CI, 0.63–0.91 per 39 mg/dL lower achieved LDL-C; 
P=0.0025; Table 2). Similar results were obtained with 
the use of a single week 4 LDL-C measurement instead 
of average levels throughout the trial (Table V in the on-
line-only Data Supplement).
In pairwise comparisons of LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and 
apoB, there was a strong and significant correlation be-
tween levels of each lipid parameter (all correlation coef-
ficients >0.9; P<0.0001; Table VI in the online-only Data 
Supplement). As with achieved average LDL-C, lower (av-
erage) achieved non–HDL-C and apoB levels were associ-
ated with a lower risk of MACE (Figure 3). A 39-mg/dL 
difference in LDL-C corresponds to a 42-mg/dL difference 
in non–HDL-C and 27-mg/dL difference in apoB in the 
present pooled data sets. For each 42 mg/dL lower non–
HDL-C, the HR was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65–0.93; P=0.0056; 
Table 2). The corresponding HR for each 27 mg/dL lower 
apoB was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.60–0.86; P=0.0002; Table 2).
Percentage reductions in lipids and Mace
LDL-C percent reduction was inversely correlated with 
MACE rates (Figure 3; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57–0.89 per 
additional 50% reduction in LDL-C; P=0.003; Table 2). 
Similarly the risk of MACE was lower with greater per-
cent reductions from baseline in both non–HDL-C (Fig-
ure 3; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.97 per 50% reduc-
tion; P=0.0323) and apoB (Figure 3; HR, 0.68; 95% 
CI, 0.54–0.85 per 50% reduction; P=0.0008; Table 2). 
Qualitatively similar results were observed with the use 
of a single week 4 measurement of LDL-C or non–HDL-C 
and week 12 apoB instead of average values through-
out the trial (Table V in the online-only Data Supplement).
safety
Overall incidences of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, deaths, and 
discontinuations as a result of TEAEs were similar be-
tween alirocumab and control patients within the pools 
of placebo- and ezetimibe-controlled studies (Table VII 
in the online-only Data Supplement). A higher rate of in-
jection site reactions, mostly mild in intensity and self-
limiting, was observed with alirocumab compared with 
controls. Analyses comparing the relationship between a 
39 mg/dL lower LDL-C and odds of any TEAE were not 
significant (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96–1.09; Figure 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement), nor was there any 
significant association between a 50% lowering of LDL-C 
and odds of any TEAE (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI: 0.93–
1.13; Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
DiscussiOn
At present, all global guidelines for ASCVD risk reduction 
focus on optimization of statin therapy as the first option 
for reducing LDL-C for those at high risk.4,5,13 The thera-
peutic limits of statins and the clinical scenarios in which

More recently, the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association guidelines and the UK Na-
tional Institute for Health and Care Excellence guide-
lines have argued that most statin trials have tested 
whether a certain percentage reduction in LDL-C trans-
lates into a reduction in clinical events rather than an 
LDL-C goal and thus recommended LDL-C reductions 
of at least 30% to 50% for those at elevated risk, again 
on the basis of what is achievable with the most po-
tent statins.5,13 Until recently, it was uncertain from trial 
data whether consistently achieving LDL-C levels <70 
mg/dL or achieving further percentage reductions in 
LDL-C after maximizing statins would translate into a 
lower risk of MACE.
The IMPROVE-IT trial extended our evidence base 
beyond statins, demonstrating that LDL-C levels on av-
erage 54 mg/dL with ezetimibe plus statins further re-
duced MACE compared with the achievement of an LDL-
C of ≈70 mg/dL with statins alone.6 The risk reduction 
observed in the IMPROVE-IT trial was also entirely con-
sistent with the absolute reduction in LDL-C that would 
have been predicted by the CTT statin-derived regres-
sion line, supporting the notion that LDL-C reduction by 
statins and ezetimibe confers similar benefits and that 
the real determinant of the relative risk reduction is the 
magnitude of the change in LDL-C rather than the mecha-
nism by which this change is achieved. If the findings of 
IMPROVE-IT are considered as a further percentage re-
duction in LDL-C, then they support the notion that, start-
ing with a baseline LDL-C of ≈70 mg/dL, a further 20% 
reduction in LDL-C translates into a 6% to 7% lower risk 
of MACE. However, the question remains as to whether 
the additional percentage reduction in LDL-C (of 50% to 
60%) and even lower on-treatment LDL-C level (<50 mg/
dL) that can be achieved by adding a PCSK9 inhibitor 
to a statin will be associated with a lower risk of MACE.
The present analysis reports data from 10 random-
ized trials in the ODYSSEY trial program, providing 
information on 6699 patient-years of exposure, and 
suggests that there is continuous relationship between 
average on-treatment LDL-C and MACE with no evidence 
of discernable attenuation even at low achieved levels of 
LDL-C (<50 mg/dL). Furthermore, for every additional 
39 mg/dL lower LDL-C achieved with either alirocumab 
or ezetimibe (on top of maximally tolerated statins in 
most patients), there was a further 24% lower risk of 
MACE (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91). This is remark-
ably similar to the CTT point estimate of a 22% risk re-
duction (rate ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.76–0.80) for every 
39-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C achieved with statins.25
Similarly, we observed an inverse relationship with 
additional percentage reductions in LDL-C and MACE 
without evidence of attenuation of benefit for greater 
percentage reductions in LDL-C. In multivariable re-
gression analyses, each 50% incremental reduction in 
LDL-C on top of statins was associated with a further

29% reduction in the risk of MACE (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 
0.57–0.89).
There was a significant correlation between LDL-
C and non–HDL-C, between LDL-C and apoB, and be-
tween non–HDL-C and apoB (all P<0.0001). As with 
LDL-C, we observed a continuous relationship between 
lower achieved levels of both non–HDL-C and apoB with 
lower rates of MACE (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93 per 
 
42-mg/dL difference; and HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60–0.86 
per 27-mg/dL difference, respectively), with no discern-
able evidence of attenuation at lower levels. Further-
more, greater percentage reductions in non–HDL-C and 
apoB were also associated with a lower risk of MACE 
with no evidence of attenuation of benefit.
Our findings are consistent with epidemiological stud-
ies in statin-naïve populations that have suggested a

continuous relationship between LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and 
apoB and risk28 with no apparent attenuation of the re-
lationship, as well as data from the statin trials in which 
a continuous relationship between on-treatment LDL-C, 
non–HDL-C, and MACE29 has been observed without 
evidence of a threshold. Although LDL-C continues to 
be the main target of lipid-lowering strategies, levels of 
non–HDL-C and apoB have been shown to more closely 
correlate with risk of MACE because these parameters 
more accurately reflect the actual number of circulating 
atherogenic particles or their cholesterol content, par-
ticularly in patients with elevated triglycerides who likely 
have elevations in non-LDL atherogenic particles.30 Our 
findings showed materially similar benefit with reductions 
in each parameter, in part as a result of the collinearity of 
the parameters and the relatively small number of events.
Prior work by Robinson et al31,32 has demonstrated 
that the benefit of lipid-lowering therapy is also related 
to the percentage reduction in LDL-C and non–HDL-C 
with consistent benefits between statins. Although high-
intensity statins have offered us the scope of a 50% re-
duction in LDL-C, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor to 
statin therapy offers us a further 50% to 60% reduction 
in these parameters on top of statins, or ≈75% to 80% 
total reduction from the patient’s untreated baseline LDL-
C level. Consistent with this rationale is the recent 2016 
American College of Cardiology pathway for the addi-
tion of nonstatin therapies for those individuals with high 
absolute risk and high LDL-C levels despite maximally 
tolerated statin therapy.14 Our observation that high-risk 
patients with LDL-C levels between 120 and 130 mg/dL, 
despite maximally tolerated statin, derive benefit from a 
further 50% reduction in LDL-C or lower achieved abso-
lute levels lends support to the consensus statement.
As we approach the possibility of achieving lower LDL-
C levels consistently with PCSK9 inhibition, concerns have 
been raised about the potential safety of achieving very low 
levels of LDL-C (eg, <50 mg/dL). The present phase 3 clini-
cal trial analyses provide further data on the overall safety 
of alirocumab and lower LDL-C levels not being associated 
with an increase in total adverse events. These findings add 
to earlier observations from high-intensity statin trials that 
have also failed to demonstrate any relationship adverse 
events and lower achieved LDL-C levels.24,33,34
limitations
The limitations of the present analysis merit consid-
eration. It is important to note that, although adverse 
consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in 
these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of 
LDL-C induced by PCSK9 inhibitors are unknown. More-
over, although these data are derived from random-
ized, controlled trials, the analyses are observational 
in nature and derived from a relatively small number of 
events. Therefore, we cannot exclude the potential for 
confounding as an explanation for the observed asso-
ciations. We have attempted to take these into account 
by statistical adjustment and by conducting sensitiv-
ity analyses using alternative methodology that have 
produced materially similar findings. Furthermore, the 
10 studies pooled differed most notably in the preva-
lence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, 
diabetes mellitus, age, history of myocardial infarction 
or stroke, and baseline LDL-C. Studies derived princi-
pally from patients with heterozygous familial hyper-
cholesterolemia tended to include patients who were 
a decade younger, had fewer patients with diabetes 
mellitus, and tended to have patients with higher base-
line LDL-C levels. Similarly, in trials without background

statin therapy, baseline LDL-C was higher. Therefore, 
a potential critique of the analyses of achieved LDL-C 
and MACE could be that patients who achieve lower 
LDL-C had lower baseline LDL-C and lower risk than 
patients at higher baseline LDL-C levels. However, we 
controlled for baseline LDL-C in all analyses; thus, we 
do not believe that baseline LDL-C levels accounted 
for our findings. Furthermore, we also assessed per-
centage reductions in LDL-C, which provided similar 
quantitative findings. Further reassurance of our meth-
odology arises from the magnitude of the association 
observed between a 39-mg/dL difference in LDL-C and 
MACE, which is similar to the point estimate derived 
from the CTT meta-regression line and lies within its 
CIs. For the safety analysis, we looked only at over-
all TEAE rates to maximize power. More sophisticated 
analyses looking at specific TEAEs would be more in-
formative in larger trials with longer follow-up than the 
present pooled data.
conclusions
These analyses provide further reassurance about the 
safety and cardiovascular benefit of achieving even fur-
ther reductions in LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apoB beyond 
what was previously achieved with statins alone. The re-
sults of the large cardiovascular outcomes studies with 
PCSK9 inhibitors such as ODYSSEY OUTCOMES are 
assessing whether PCSK9 inhibition with alirocumab on 
top of maximally tolerated statin therapy reduces MACE. 
If these trials demonstrate the effectiveness of further 
LDL-C reduction, then guideline committees may inves-
