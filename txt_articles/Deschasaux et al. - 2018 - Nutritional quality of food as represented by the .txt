Abstract
Background
Helping consumers make healthier food choices is a key issue for the prevention of cancer
and other diseases. In many countries, political authorities are considering the implementa-
tion of a simplified labelling system to reflect the nutritional quality of food products. The
Nutri-Score, a five-colour nutrition label, is derived from the Nutrient Profiling System of the
British Food Standards Agency (modified version) (FSAm-NPS). How the consumption of
foods with high/low FSAm-NPS relates to cancer risk has been studied in national/regional
cohorts but has not been characterized in diverse European populations.
Methods and findings
This prospective analysis included 471,495 adults from the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC, 1992–2014, median follow-up: 15.3 y), among whom there
were 49,794 incident cancer cases (main locations: breast, n = 12,063; prostate, n = 6,745;
colon-rectum, n = 5,806). Usual food intakes were assessed with standardized country-specific
diet assessment methods. The FSAm-NPS was calculated for each food/beverage using their
100-g content in energy, sugar, saturated fatty acid, sodium, fibres, proteins, and fruits/vegeta-
bles/legumes/nuts. The FSAm-NPS scores of all food items usually consumed by a participant
were averaged to obtain the individual FSAm-NPS Dietary Index (DI) scores. Multi-adjusted
Cox proportional hazards models were computed. A higher FSAm-NPS DI score, reflecting a
lower nutritional quality of the food consumed, was associated with a higher risk of total cancer
(HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.07; 95% CI 1.03–1.10, P-trend < 0.001). Absolute cancer rates in those
with high and low (quintiles 5 and 1) FSAm-NPS DI scores were 81.4 and 69.5 cases/10,000
person-years, respectively. Higher FSAm-NPS DI scores were specifically associated with
higher risks of cancers of the colon-rectum, upper aerodigestive tract and stomach, lung for
men, and liver and postmenopausal breast for women (all P < 0.05). The main study limitation
is that it was based on an observational cohort using self-reported dietary data obtained
through a single baseline food frequency questionnaire; thus, exposure misclassification and
residual confounding cannot be ruled out.

 Conclusions
In this large multinational European cohort, the consumption of food products with a higher
FSAm-NPS score (lower nutritional quality) was associated with a higher risk of cancer. This
supports the relevance of the FSAm-NPS as underlying nutrient profiling system for front-of-
pack nutrition labels, as well as for other public health nutritional measures.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Helping consumers make healthier food choices is a key challenge for the prevention of
cancer and other chronic diseases, which is why in many countries, political authorities
are considering the implementation of a simplified labelling system to reflect the nutri-
tional quality of food products.
• The Nutri-Score, a five-colour nutrition label based on the Nutrient Profiling System of
the British Food Standards Agency (modified version) (FSAm-NPS) score (calculated
for each food/beverage using its 100-g content in energy, sugar, saturated fatty acids,
sodium, fibres, proteins, and fruits/vegetables/legumes/nuts) has been selected by
French authorities but remains optional per European labelling regulations.
• So far, scientific evidence regarding the relevance of the Nutri-Score (and the underly-
ing FSAm-NPS score) has been obtained at national/regional level, thus expanding
investigations to the European level is of importance.
What did the researchers do and find?
• This study is part of a comprehensive assessment of the FSAm-NPS validity as underly-
ing nutrient profiling system for front-of-pack nutrition labels (as well as other public
health nutritional measures) in Europe.
• Here, we conducted a prospective analysis of the association between the FSAm-NPS
score of the food consumed (reflecting their nutritional quality) and cancer risk in the
large and diverse European population that constitutes the European Prospective Inves-
tigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, including 471,495 adults from 10
European countries with 49,794 newly diagnosed cancer cases.
• The consumption of foods with higher FSAm-NPS scores, reflecting a lower nutritional
quality, was associated with an increased risk of developing cancer (overall and several
specific cancer sites).
What do these findings mean?
• These findings add support to the relevance of using the FSAm-NPS to grade the nutri-
tional quality of food products as a basis for prevention strategies for cancer and other
chronic diseases.

Introduction
About a third of the most common cancers in Western countries are estimated to be prevent-
able through appropriate nutritional behaviours (World Cancer Research Fund [WCRF]/
American Institute for Cancer Research [AICR]) [1]. If nutrition can be modified at the indi-
vidual level and therefore targeted by public health policies, informing the general population
to make healthy, evidence-based nutritional decisions remains an important challenge.
Among the promising strategies proposed to promote a healthier dietary environment [2,3],
simplified front-of-pack nutrition labels, providing summarized, easy-to-use information on
the nutritional quality of food products, have the potential to help consumers make healthier
food choices and to encourage the food industry to improve the nutritional quality of the food
supply [4,5]. The Nutri-Score five-colour labelling system (see S1 Fig) [3] uses a modified ver-
sion of the British Food Standards Agency Nutrient Profiling System (original version)
(FSA-NPS) [6,7], considered a promising nutrient profiling system for use in a broad interna-
tional context [6,8], to categorize food products into 5 colours reflecting their nutritional qual-
ity (see examples in S1 Text). The FSA-NPS was built in a perspective of prevention of a large
range of chronic diseases. It allocates a score to a given food/beverage from its content per 100
g of energy, saturated fatty acids, sugar, sodium, dietary fibres, proteins, and fruit/vegetables/
legumes/nuts. It was initially developed and validated in the United Kingdom, where it has
been used for advertising regulation (Ofcom) [6,7,9] and was transposed in France (FSAm-
NPS) [10–12].
Several studies support the scientific relevance and the potential public health impact of the
use of the FSAm-NPS as a basis for public health nutrition policies [13–21] (reviewed in [22]).
In particular, studies performed in the SU.VI.MAX and NutriNet-Sante
´ cohorts have shown
that a diet composed of food products with better FSAm-NPS scores (summarized with the
FSAm-NPS Dietary Index [DI] [23,24]) would lead to more favourable health outcomes as
regards weight gain [25], metabolic syndrome [26], cardiovascular diseases [27,28], and cancer
incidence (total and breast) [29,30]. These results were promising albeit restricted to French
populations and based on a relatively limited number of cases (especially to perform robust
analyses by cancer sites).
In 2017, the Nutri-Score was selected by the French Ministry of Health as the official front-
of-pack nutrition label to be implemented in France [31,32], an initiative officially com-
mended by WHO Europe [33]. However, to comply with the European Union (EU) labelling
regulations, appending the Nutri-Score on food products remains optional and therefore relies
on voluntary uptake by food manufacturers. In 2018, a review of existing labelling schemes at
the EU level is anticipated, and discussions regarding the possible implementation of a unique
nutritional labelling system for all EU countries are expected to follow. Similar discussions are
also ongoing in North and South America, Canada, and Australia. Scientific evidence regard-
ing the relevance of this label (and the underlying FSAm-NPS score) at an international level is
therefore of importance.

 This study is part of a comprehensive assessment of the validity of the FSAm-NPS as under-
lying nutrient profiling system for front-of-pack nutrition labels as well as other public health
nutritional measures in Europe. Specifically, it aimed at investigating the association between
the FSAm-NPS DI and cancer risk in the large and diverse European population that consti-
tutes the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort.
Methods
Study population: The EPIC cohort
EPIC (http://epic.iarc.fr/) is a multicentre prospective cohort study investigating metabolic,
dietary, lifestyle, and environmental factors in relation to cancer and other chronic diseases.
Between 1992 and 2000, more than 500,000 volunteers (25–70 years old) were recruited from
10 European countries (23 administrative centres): Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. All participants gave written informed
consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committees and by the Internal Review
Board of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Details of the study design, recruit-
ment, and data collection have been previously published [34–36].
Of the 521,324 participants enrolled, 471,495 were included in the analyses (see flowchart
in S2 Fig for exclusion details). In particular, from the 54,459 eligible invasive cancer cases, we
excluded those diagnosed within the first 2 years of follow-up (n = 4,665) to allow sufficient
delay between baseline dietary assessment and cancer diagnosis, thereby limiting reverse
causality.
Baseline data collection
An extended and standardized phenotypic characterisation was performed for each participant
upon enrolment. Questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic information, educa-
tional level (collected and standardized for the whole cohort), personal and familial history of
diseases, lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, physical activity), and menstrual and reproductive
history for women. Anthropometric measurements (e.g., height, weight, waist, and hip cir-
cumferences) were performed in all centres (except France, Oxford, and Norway: self-reported
data).
Dietary intake assessment
Usual dietary intake was assessed for each individual at recruitment using country-specific
and validated dietary questionnaires developed to capture the geographical specificity of an
individual’s diet. The type of dietary questionnaire used differed according to study centres
and included: self- or interviewer-administered semiquantitative food frequency question-
naires (FFQs) with an estimation of individual average portions or with the same standard
portion assigned to all subjects or diet history questionnaires combining an FFQ and 7-day
dietary records [36]. The EPIC food composition database comprises more than 10,000 food
and beverage items reflecting the specificities of each country [37].
FSAm-NPS DI computation
As described previously [7,10,12], the FSAm-NPS score is a modified version of the original
FSA-NPS, with adaptations in the allocation of points for beverages, cheese, and added fats fol-
lowing recommendations from the French High Council for Public Health (HCSP) to ensure a
high consistency of the FSAm-NPS score with nutritional recommendations, for labelling pur-
poses [12].

 The FSAm-NPS score was calculated for all foods and beverages in the EPIC food composi-
tion database as follows: points (0–10) are allocated for the content per 100 g in total sugars
(g), saturated fatty acids (g), sodium (mg), and energy (kJ) (i.e., nutrients that should be con-
sumed in limited amounts) and can be balanced by opposite points (0–5) allocated for dietary
fibres (g), proteins (g), and fruits/vegetables/legumes/nuts (percent) (i.e., nutrients/compo-
nents that should be promoted). The grids for point attribution are displayed in S1 Text (gen-
eral rule and specific grids: sugars, energy, and fruits/vegetables/legumes/nuts for beverages,
saturated fatty acids for added fats). The percentage of fruits/vegetables/legumes/nuts was
derived using standard recipes. The FSAm-NPS score for each food/beverage is based on a
unique discrete continuous scale ranging theoretically from −15 (most healthy) to +40 (least
healthy). The universality of the FSAm-NPS components allows a computation for all existing
foods/beverages, no matter the cultural diet structure in which they are included.
An individual consumes many different foods of contrasted nutritional quality, which syn-
ergistically influence his/her disease risk. When studying the association between food intakes
and chronic diseases, all food items consumed have to be considered (and therefore all associ-
ated FSAm-NPS scores) and not just one single food. Therefore, in a second step, the FSAm-
NPS DI was computed at the individual level as an energy-weighted mean of the FSAm-NPS
scores of all foods and beverages consumed using the following equation [23] (FSi: score of
food/beverage i, Ei: energy intake from food/beverage i, n: number of food/beverage con-
sumed):
FSAm � NPS DI ¼
Pn
i¼1ðFSiEiÞ
Pn
i¼1Ei
Higher FSAm-NPS DI therefore reflects lower nutritional quality in foods consumed.
More details on FSAm-NPS and FSAm-NPS DI calculations can be found in S1 Text.
Follow-up for cancer incidence and vital status
Incident cancer cases were identified through several methods, including record linkage with
population-based cancer registries, health insurance records, pathology registries, and active
follow-up of study subjects. Data on vital status were obtained from mortality registries, in
combination with data collected through active follow-up. The end of follow-up/closure dates
of the study period varied between 2009 and 2014 depending on the countries.
First primary invasive cancers were considered as cases in this study. Main cancer cases
were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O)
[38] as follows: colorectal cancer (C18, C199, C209), bladder cancer (C67), kidney cancer
(C649), upper aerodigestive tract cancers (oral cavity: C019, C02, C03, C04, C050, C06; oro-
pharynx: C09, C10; hypopharynx: C13, C14; larynx: C32; esophagus: C15), lung cancer (C34),
stomach cancer (C16), pancreas cancer (C25), liver cancer (C220), breast cancer (C50), endo-
metrial cancer (C54), cervical cancer (C53), ovary cancer (C569), prostate cancer (C61).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were pre-planned and followed the plan detailed in the project protocol
that was submitted for funding application (S2 Text). Associations between the FSAm-NPS DI
(continuous variable and sex-specific quintiles) and cancer risk overall and for specific cancer
locations were characterized (hazard ratio [HR] and 95% CI) using multivariable Cox propor-
tional hazards models with age as the primary time variable. We confirmed that the assump-
tions of proportionality were satisfied through examination of the log–log (survival) versus
log–time plots. Tests for linear trends were performed with an ordinal coding of FSAm-NPS

 DI quintiles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Participants contributed person-time to the model until their date of
cancer diagnosis, their date of death, their date of emigration/loss to follow-up, or end-of-fol-
low-up, whichever occurred first. Analysis by censoring the competing death event is the most
appropriate way for HR estimation in evaluating exposure–disease associations [39,40]. For
analyses of specific cancer sites, participants who reported a cancer other than the one under
study were included and censored at the date of diagnosis (except basal cell skin carcinoma,
which was not considered as cancer).
Analyses were performed for sexes combined and by sex. Models were stratified by age at
recruitment (1-y intervals) and study centre [34] (‘strata’ option in proc phreg, SAS) and mul-
tivariable adjusted for other known risk factors for cancer: sex, body mass index (BMI), height,
educational level, physical activity, smoking status and intensity, alcohol intake at recruitment,
total energy intake, family history of breast and colorectal cancer, and, for women (subgroup
analyses), menopausal status at baseline and whether they ever used hormonal treatment for
menopause or oral contraception. For women-specific cancer locations (cancers of the repro-
ductive system), models were further adjusted for age at menarche, age at first full-term preg-
nancy, age at menopause, and an interaction term between BMI and menopausal status. For
these cancers, models were computed by menopausal status (pre-menopause/post-meno-
pause): women contributed person-time to the ‘pre-menopause model’ until their age of men-
opause and to the ‘post-menopause model’ from their age of menopause. Detailed information
about covariate categorization can be found in the table footnotes. Age at menopause was col-
lected at baseline for postmenopausal women. If missing or if women were pre- or perimen-
opausal at baseline, then age at menopause was set at 55 years [41]. For analyses on cancers of
the endometrium, cervix, and ovaries, we excluded women who declared a surgical menopause
at baseline. When data on categorical covariates were missing, a ‘missing class’ was introduced
in the model. If missing, height and weight were imputed with centre-, age-, and gender-spe-
cific average values. Sensitivity analyses were also performed using a ‘complete cases’
approach, excluding participants with missing data on covariates.
BMI was considered as a confounding factor in the analyses and thus was adjusted for in
the models. However, BMI could also be considered as a potential intermediate factor, which
was tested in a sensitivity analysis excluding BMI.
Unadjusted absolute rates were calculated as the number of cases per 10,000 person-years
in the highest and the lowest quintiles, respectively, of the FSAm-NPS DI score.
All tests were two sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for the analyses.
Results
After a median follow-up time of 15.3 y (between 1992–2000 and 2009–2014), 49,794 incident
invasive cancer cases were recorded (cancer incidence by country is shown in S1 Table). The
most common cancers were breast (n = 12,063), prostate (n = 6,745), colon-rectum
(n = 5,806), and lung (n = 3,654).
Participants with a higher FSAm-NPS DI score, reflecting a diet of lower nutritional quality,
were consistently more likely to have unhealthy dietary intakes, e.g., higher intakes of alcohol,
energy and red and processed meat, lower intakes of dietary fibres, vegetables, fruit, fish, and
lean meat (Table 1). Participants from France, Germany, the UK (Cambridge centre), and
Sweden were more likely to score higher on the FSAm-NPS DI (i.e., to consume food products
of lower nutritional quality) and thus to be classified in the 5th quintile, whereas participants
from Greece, Italy, Spain, Norway, and the UK (Oxford centre, mainly ‘health-conscious’ par-
ticipants, including a high proportion of vegetarians) were more likely to have lower scores.

The FSAm-NPS nutrient profiling system and cancer risk in Europe
PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002651
September 18, 2018
8 / 21
 Participants from Denmark and the Netherlands were more likely to have middle-range scores
falling within the 2nd to the 4th quintile (Table 1).
Associations between the FSAm-NPS DI (continuous score and sex-specific quintiles) and
cancer risk for different cancer types are displayed in Table 2 (overall) and Table 3 (by sex).
A higher FSAm-NPS DI score was associated with a higher risk of total cancer (HRQ5 versus
Q1 = 1.07; 95% CI 1.03–1.10, P-trend < 0.001). The absolute rates in those with high and low
FSAm-NPS DI scores were 81.4 (men: 115.9; women: 66.6) and 69.5 (men: 89.6; women: 61.1)
cases per 10,000 person-years, respectively.
Regarding specific cancer types, a higher FSAm-NPS DI was associated with a higher risk
of colorectal cancer (HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.11 (1.01–1.22), P-trend = 0.02), especially in women
(P-interaction = 0.04). A higher FSAm-NPS DI was also associated with a higher liver cancer
risk in women (HRQ5 versus Q1 = 2.33 (1.23–4.43), P-trend = 0.008, P-interaction = 0.04) and

 a higher lung cancer risk in men (HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.26 (1.06–1.51), P-trend = 0.02) although
the interaction with sex was not significant for lung cancer (P-interaction = 0.3). If only bor-
derline nonsignificant trends were observed when comparing the highest and the lowest quin-
tiles of the FSAm-NPS DI, 2-point increment in the FSAm-NPS DI score was associated with
higher risks of stomach cancer (HR per 2-point increment = 1.10 (1.02–1.18), P-trend = 0.01)
and of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (HR per 2-point increment = 1.07 (1.01–1.14),
P-trend = 0.03). A borderline significant association was also observed for kidney cancer
(HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.17 (0.93–1.46), P-trend = 0.04). No association was observed for cancers
of the bladder (P-trend = 0.6) and pancreas (P-trend = 0.7).
For sex-specific cancers of the reproductive system, a higher FSAm-NPS DI score was asso-
ciated with a higher risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.08 (1.00–1.16),
P-trend = 0.03, S2 Table) and a borderline significant higher risk of prostate cancer (HRQ5 ver-
sus Q1 = 1.07 (0.98–1.17), P-trend = 0.04, Table 2). No association was detected for cancers of
the endometrium, uterine cervix, or ovaries (Table 2).Similar results were observed for overall
cancer risk when complete cases models were used (40,945 cases/5,201,091 person-years,
HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.07 (1.03–1.11), P-trend < 0.001) and when models were not adjusted for
BMI (HRQ5 versus Q1 95% CI 1.07 [1.03–1.10], P-trend < 0.001).
Discussion
In this large multinational European cohort, participants with the highest FSAm-NPS DI
scores, i.e., those consuming on average food products with a lower nutritional quality, were at
higher risk of developing cancer overall. Stronger associations were observed for colorectal,

 upper aerodigestive tract, and stomach cancers, for lung cancer in men, and for liver and post-
menopausal breast cancers in women.
To our knowledge, this study was the first effort to investigate the association between the
FSAm-NPS DI and disease in a large European cohort. Consistent with our results, previous
studies performed in the SU.VI.MAX and NutriNet-Sante
´ cohorts reported higher risks for
total and breast cancers with higher FSAm-NPS DI scores [29,30]. However, these studies
exhibited limited statistical power to investigate the relationships for other specific cancer
types.
With a different approach, using the original FSA-NPS score and the Ofcom regulation
threshold [9] to categorize food/beverage as ‘healthier’ or ‘less healthy’, Masset and colleagues
observed a lower all-cause and cancer mortality associated to the intake of a greater variety of
‘healthier’ food items in the Whitehall II cohort [42], and, recently, Mytton and colleagues
observed a higher all-cause mortality associated to the consumption of ‘less healthy’ food items
in EPIC-Norfolk [43].
The comparison between other dietary scores and the FSAm-NPS DI is not straightforward.
Indeed, the FSAm-NPS DI is a dietary score based on a nutrient profiling system at the level of
food products, obtained following a two-step process. First, all food and beverage items are
assigned a score according to their nutritional quality (FSAm-NPS). Then, an individual
index, the FSAm-NPS DI, is computed at the individual level (mainly for research purposes)
by calculating a weighted mean of the FSAm-NPS scores of all food/beverages consumed by
this individual. In contrast, usual dietary scores are obtained directly at the individual level,
allocating points based on the consumption of foods/food groups or nutrients relevant for
overall or specific chronic disease risk (e.g., Mediterranean diet score [44], WCRF/AICR
adherence score [45], Alternate Healthy Eating Index [46]). Therefore, these scores relate
more to individual eating behaviours than to the intrinsic nutritional quality of the foods con-
sumed, with objective to add support to dietary recommendations and/or be a basis for dietary
guidelines. The FSAm-NPS was not designed to find the best predictive score for cancer risk
but rather to serve as a basis for food nutritional labelling (such as the Nutri-Score) and other
public health nutritional policies (e.g., advertising regulation) in order to improve the preven-
tion of a large range of chronic diseases. As such, it has to be easily computable by industrial
and public stakeholders (thus including only items generally present in the nutritional facts of
all food labels). Hence, our objective was not to compare the FSAm-NPS DI score to other
existing dietary scores but to specifically assess the relevance of the use of the FSAm-NPS score
to grade the nutritional quality of food products in the framework of public health policies
aiming at reducing cancer risk.
To our knowledge, the Overall Nutritional Quality Index (ONQI-f) is the only other dietary
score based on a nutrient profiling system at the food level that has been translated at the indi-
vidual level and then studied in relation to health outcomes so far [47]. In a study performed
in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Chiuve and col-
leagues observed that a higher ONQI-f (reflecting a higher overall nutritional quality of the
diet), was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and mortality but
was not associated with cancer risk. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the ONQI-f is
based on 30 nutrients (from macronutrients such as fat, protein, or glycaemic load to micronu-
trients such as folate, vitamin D, zinc, iron, or omega 3 fatty acids but also polyphenols [flavo-
noids]), among which few have shown a consistent association with cancer risk, which may
have weakened its relevance for the cancer outcome.
In contrast, the FSAm-NPS score relies on a limited number of components for which
information is readily available on food packaging; in addition, most of these components
have been proposed to be involved in cancer development in epidemiological and mechanistic

 studies. Inverse associations have been observed between dietary fibre intake and colorectal
[48,49] and breast [48] cancer risk, fruit and vegetable intakeand risk of cancers of the mouth/
larynx/pharynx and lung [48,49], whereas positive associations have been observed between
salt intake and stomach cancer risk [48,49] and sugar intake (as a contributor to glycaemic
load) and endometrial cancer risk [49]. In addition, even though the evidence for an associa-
tion between saturated fatty acid intake and breast cancer risk was classified as ‘limited-no
conclusion’ in the last WCRF report, the corresponding meta-analysis did show a direct associ-
ation [50]. Indirect associations may also be proposed between the FSAm-NPS components
and cancer risk through an association with body fatness, a major risk factor for most cancer
locations (oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, colon-rectum, breast [postmenopausal],
ovary, endometrium, prostate, and kidney) [48,49]. Indeed, FSAm-NPS components contrib-
ute to the energy density of foods, with energy, sugars, and saturated fatty acids as components
of energy-dense foods and fibres and fruits and vegetables as components of low-energy foods.
In our study, nonsignificant results were observed for specific cancer types in men, women,
or both, and most associations were weak compared to other studies exploring FSAm-NPS DI
in relation with cancers (SU.VI.MAX: total cancer, 453 cases, HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.34 [1.00–
1.81]); NutriNet-Sante
´, breast cancer, 555 cases: HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.52 [1.11–2.08] [29,30]).
Although HR cannot be compared directly between our study and previous ones because of
differences in population and methods, several hypotheses may be proposed to explain the
rather weak associations observed here. Most centres participating in the EPIC cohort used an
FFQ to assess dietary intakes. FFQs allow good estimations of usual dietary intakes but limit
the discrimination of the nutritional quality of individual food products, especially when they

 are collapsed into aggregated food groups. The use of FFQs may have contributed to a less
accurate estimation of the individual FSAm-NPS DI scores and thus to a dilution of the poten-
tial effect [51], with weaker associations than the ones that could have been observed with the
use of other dietary assessment methods (e.g., repeated 24-h dietary records as used in the SU.
VI.MAX and NutriNet-Sante
´ cohorts). Differences in effect size between studies and between
cancer locations could also be partially explained by the differences in the number of cases;
fewer cases may lead to less-accurate estimates of HRs. Finally, the differences in effect size
between cancer locations and the nonsignificant results observed for some cancer sites may
illustrate true different susceptibilities of cancer types to nutritional factors. For example,
WCRF and AICR estimated that 47% of colorectal cancer may be prevented with nutrition
compared to 19% for pancreatic cancers [1].
Strengths of this study include its large sample size, its prospective design, its long follow-
up, and the inclusion of participants from different European countries with standardised data
collection, especially for diet, offering a broad perspective on nutritional quality of dietary
intakes in Europe. However, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, caution is
needed regarding the extrapolation of these results to the entire European population or to
other populations or ethnicities worldwide since this study included volunteers from 10 Euro-
pean countries involved in a long-term cohort study investigating the association between
nutrition and health, with overall more health-conscious behaviours compared to the general
population. Therefore, unhealthy dietary behaviours may have been underrepresented in this
study, which may have weakened the observed associations by inducing a smaller contrast
between high and low scores. Furthermore, in our models, we included all the participants
with available dietary intake data but with potential missing data on other covariates replaced
with a ‘missing’ class or imputation. Although this may have induced some bias, a complete
cases model would lead to a selection towards more compliant participants in an already
health-conscious population. Still, sensitivity analyses with a complete cases model provided
similar results. In addition, this study used a single assessment of dietary intakes at baseline.
Although diet may change over time, it is usually hypothesized that this estimation reflects
general eating behavior throughout middle-aged adult life [52]. Diet measurement instru-
ments are built to capture the usual dietary intakes of an individual but are still subject to
imprecision and inaccuracy. Finally, this study was based on an observational cohort. Thus,
even though our models included a large range of confounding factors, residual confounding
cannot be entirely ruled out.
In conclusion, the results of this observational study performed on a large European cohort
with diverse profiles and nutritional habits, suggest that the consumption of food products
with higher FSAm-NPS scores (reflecting a lower nutritional quality) is associated with a
higher risk of developing cancer. These studies complement published or ongoing studies spe-
cifically assessing the perception and understanding of the Nutri-Score (derived from FSAm-
NPS score) and its actual impact on food choices [13–22]. Overall, this adds support to the rel-
evance of the FSAm-NPS as underlying nutrient profiling system for the simplified nutrition
label Nutri-Score, but also for other public health nutritional measures aiming to influence the
nutritional quality of food choices at a national and potentially supranational level. This should
be considered for ongoing and future debates at the EU level regarding the implementation of
a unique food labelling system on the front of pack of food products. To date, the FSAm-NPS
is the most validated nutrient-profiling system and the easiest to compute, with a limited num-
ber of components that are readily available on food packaging and an open/published algo-
rithm. Future comparative studies may be carried on if other nutrient profiling systems with
similar characteristics, and a corresponding score derived at the individual level are to be pro-
posed. Appending a nutritional label like the Nutri-Score would be an additional tool to the

 array of public health nutritional strategies. In particular, this would complement strategies
setting the bases of a balanced diet mixing different types of food, by helping the consumers
choose food products with a better nutritional profile, even among the same food category,
and by highlighting food products for which a sensible consumption should be preferred.
