Conclusion: 
 The GHB withdrawal symptoms 
cannot be related to a single mechanism or neurological 
pathway, which implies that different medication combina-
tions are needed for treatment. A single drug class, such as 
benzodiazepines, gabapentin or antipsychotics, is unlikely 
to be sufficient to avoid life-threatening complications. De-
toxification by means of titration and tapering of pharma-
ceutical GHB can be considered as a promising treatment 
that could make polypharmacy redundant.

Abstract 
 
Objective: γ-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) has gained popularity 
as a drug of abuse. In the Netherlands the number of patients 
in treatment for GHB dependence has increased sharply. 
Clinical presentation of GHB withdrawal can be life threaten-
ing. We aim, through this overview, to explore the neurobio-
logical pathways causing GHB dependency and withdrawal, 
and their implications for treatment choices.  
Methods: In 
this work we review the literature discussing the findings 
from animal models to clinical studies focused on the neuro-
biological pathways of endogenous but mainly exogenous 
GHB.  
Results: Chronic abuse of GHB exerts multifarious neu-
rotransmitter and neuromodulator effects on γ-aminobutyric 
acid (GABA), glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, norepineph-
rine and cholinergic systems. Moreover, important effects on 
neurosteroidogenesis and oxytocin release are wielded. 
GHB acts mainly via a bidirectional effect on GABA 
B recep-
tors (GABA 
B 
R; subunits GABA 
B1 and GABA 
B2 
), depending on 
the subunit of the GIRK (G-protein-dependent ion inwardly

veloped in the 1960s as an anaesthetic agent  
[2] 
, but its 
use in anaesthesia remained limited due to inadequate 
analgesia, the emergence of delirium and its proconvul-
sive effect  
[3] 
. As a therapeutic drug (Xyrem 
® 
; sodium 
oxybate), GHB is currently used worldwide in the treat-
ment of narcolepsy with attacks of cataplexy  
[4] 
. It is also 
approved in Austria and Italy to treat alcohol dependence 
and withdrawal (Alcover 
® 
)  
[5] 
, and it is used off-label for 
opiate withdrawal. In recent decades, GHB has gained 
popularity as a recreational drug and a drug of abuse in 
Europe and the Netherlands  
[6, 7] 
. However, GHB use 
seems to be on the low side. National estimates (for coun-
tries within Europe) of the prevalence of GHB use in both 
adult and school populations where GHB use exists re-
main low (1–1.4%)  
[8, 9] 
. GHB use was reported as 2% 
among UK regular clubbers in 2011  
[9] 
, 1.3% in the gen-
eral population in the Netherlands (15–65 years)  
[10, 11] 
and 1% of the Norwegian youth aged 15–20 years  
[12] 
. 
Little is known about the exact prevalence of chronic 
GHB dependence in the USA and Europe due to the ab-
sence of surveillance and systematic reporting mecha-
nisms  
[13] 
. Nevertheless, the number of GHB users seek-
ing help has increased in recent years  
[9] 
. In the Nether-
lands, the number of patients admitted to addiction 
treatment centres for GHB detoxification quadrupled 
from 63 patients in 2008 to 799 patients in 2012  
[14] 
; per-
tinent to this is the fact that GHB-related drug incidents 
increased substantially, e.g. 20% of the reported 3,652 
drug incidents in the Netherlands in 2011  
[7] and 7% of 
the subsequent acute poisoning admissions in Norway 
 
[12] 
.
 
The abuse potential of GHB is most likely the result of 
its anxiolytic, hypnotic and euphoric effects  
[15] 
. After 
the ban on the commercial trade of GHB, and its subse-
quent classification as a schedule 1 drug, abuse extended 
to γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) 
 
[15, 16] 
. GBL and 1,4-BD are precursors of GHB, avail-
able as common industrial chemicals, and when ingested 
are rapidly metabolized into GHB, exerting the same clin-
ical effects as GHB  
[17] 
. GHB-dependent users who dose 
multiple times daily are repeatedly presented to emergen-
cy departments with acute intoxication, GHB withdrawal 
syndromes and GHB-related traumas  
[18] 
. Severe mani-
festations of GHB intoxication include central nervous 
system depression, hypoventilation, bradycardia, myoc-
lonus and seizures. Agitation or delayed delirium may oc-
cur, as well as complications such as metabolic acidosis 
and Wernicke’
s encephalopathy, which may be lethal 
 
[19–21] 
. The clinical presentation of GHB withdrawal 
ranges from mild tremors, tachycardia, hypertension, 
anxiety, agitation, seizures and insomnia to profound dis-
orientation, increasing paranoia with auditory and visual 
hallucinations, delirium, agitation and rhabdomyolysis 
 
[22] 
. The pharmacological and neurobiological mecha-
nism of action of GHB responsible for its therapeutic and 
abuse-related effects is not entirely clear. However, over 
recent years an increasing number of animal studies and 
some human studies have focused on examining the 
mechanism of action of GHB. Several recent reviews have 
thoroughly addressed the neurobiology of GHB intoxica-
tion, e.g. van Amsterdam et al.  
[23] 
. Therefore, the aim of 
this review is to provide a neurobiological explanation of 
the complexity of GHB dependence and the GHB with-
drawal syndrome and its clinical implications. In order to 
understand this complexity, firstly the effects of exoge-
nous GHB (ExGHB) are reviewed by exploring the re-
semblances between the endogenous GHB (EnGHB) and 
the ExGHB neurobiological mechanism of action, and 
secondly, the neurobiological pathways of GHB depen-
dence and withdrawal are explored.
 
 
Endogenous and Exogenous GHB 
 
ExGHB was synthesized by Laborit  
[2] in 1960 as a po-
tential γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist and ana-
logue that induces sedation. It was later discovered that 
GHB is an endogenous compound existing in the brain of 
humans  
[24] 
. EnGHB concentrations in the human brain 
reach about 11–25 μ 
M in the striatum  
[25] 
, whereas the 
cerebellum and certain areas of the cerebral cortex con-
tain the lowest concentrations  
[26] 
. ExGHB adds to these 
concentrations where GHB levels above the vitreous cut-
off endogenous urine concentrations of 6–10 mg/l are 
considered to be exogenous  
[27, 28] 
. ExGHB seems 
to pursue almost the same neurobiological pathway as 
EnGHB with regard to metabolism and the neuronal up-
take, release and degradation process in the brain, and it 
could be expected to provide equivalent physiological ef-
fects.
 
Source and Metabolism 
 
EnGHB has several precursors: GABA, through trans-
amination and reduction in the neuronal compartment 
by GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde re-
ductase  
[29, 30] 
, GBL, as detected in the rat brain  
[1] and 
1,4-BD, which exists among lipid-diols in the human 
brain  
[31] 
. ExGHB share the same precursors ( 
fig. 1 
)  
[26] 
. 
When ingested in humans, ExGHB is absorbed rapidly 
and has a peak plasma concentration within 30–90 min

after ingestion  
[32] 
. The overload of the EnGHB system 
in the brain by the administration of ExGHB, which can 
easily cross the placenta and the blood-brain barrier  
[17] 
and penetrate into brain cells, will probably increase GHB 
concentration in the vesicles, depending on the threshold 
level of GHB in the neuronal cytosol  
[33] 
. ExGHB, as well 
as EnGHB, colocalizes with GABA in its nerve terminals 
 
[26, 33] 
. It is released into the extracellular space by Ca 
2+ 
-
dependent neuronal depolarization from GHBergic ter-
minals  
[21, 34] 
. The elimination or degradation process 
seems to be similar for both EnGHB and ExGHB ( 
fig. 1 
), 
and is strictly controlled by the negative feedback influ-
ence of the reaction products  
[17, 35] 
. In addition, ExGHB 
has nonlinear dose-dependent renal clearance, which in-
creases at higher GHB plasma concentrations  
[36] 
, most 
likely due to the saturable reabsorption in the kidneys 
 
[37–39] 
. This may explain, in part, the renal failure pro-
cess presentation during GHB intoxication, which might 
be fatal.
 
Physiological Effect 
 
After crossing the blood-brain barrier, ExGHB in low 
doses could initiate the same physiological functions of 
EnGHB. This clarifies some of the interesting therapeu-
tic perspectives of ExGHB, and may partially explain its 
unfortunate abuse liability. GHB levels are believed to 
rise in the case of hypoxia and/or ischaemia and exces-
sive metabolic demand to protect central and peripheral 
tissues (e.g. myocardium)  
[1] 
. Results of animal studies 
demonstrate the direct protective action of GHB treat-
ment against oxidative stress-induced cell death, apop-
tosis and nerve cell death mechanisms, which suggests 
that GHB may also control neuroprotection against tran-
sient global lesions  
[40–42] 
. This effect is achieved 
through reducing cell energy requirements and cerebral 
energy metabolism via the increase in brain concentra-
tions of glycogen and glucose, and a decrease in concen-
trations of pyruvate, lactate and α-ketoglutarate  
[1] 
which lowers oxygen demand and consumption by the 
brain and other tissues. Low levels of GHB also function 
as a feedback inhibitor of lipid peroxidation  
[43, 44] 
. 
This could explain the limited impact experienced by 
abusers following GHB-induced coma/blackouts, which 
leads to the inaccurate assumption of the drug’
s safety, 
thereby increasing its attraction and ultimate GHB abuse. 
On the other hand, and despite the suggested neuropro-
tective role, animal studies of repeated or prolonged ex-
posure to GHB in rats showed noticeable neurological 
cell loss in the CA1 hippocampus and the prefrontal cor-
tex  
[45] 
. Functional tests in rodents confirmed the pres-
ence of impairments in working and spatial memory 
 
[45–47] 
, which can be lasting  
[48] 
. However, human 
studies systematically investigating the long-lasting ef-
fects of GHB use on cognitive functions are lacking. An-
other physiological function of GHB which has been 
beneficial therapeutically is its impact on the sleep pat-

GABA is converted to succinic semialde-
hyde by GABA transaminase (in mito-
chondria), followed by a reduction of suc-
cinic semialdehyde to GHB by cytosolic 
succinic semialdehyde reductase. Succinic 
semialdehyde 
dehydrogenase 
converts 
succinic semialdehyde to succinate, lead-
ing to energy production via the Krebs cy-
cle. GBL and 1,4-BD are converted to GHB 
and cross the blood-brain barrier. GHB ox-
idation takes place, forming succinic semi-
aldehyde by NADP 
+ 
-linked succinic semi-
aldehyde reductase. The succinic semialde-
hyde undergoes further metabolism to 
either GABA or succinate. The GHB dehy-
drogenase is capable of metabolizing GHB 
to succinic semialdehyde. Another metab-
olism pathway of GHB is through a 
β-oxidation process. SSA = Succinic semi-
aldehyde; SSR = succinic semialdehyde re-
ductase; BBB = blood-brain barrier.

tern in humans and rodents. This effect could be one of 
the potential risks for the abuse and dependence liability 
of GHB when used as self-medication, especially in pa-
tients suffering from sleep disturbances. Just as EnGHB 
plays an important role in sleep physiology  
[49] 
, ExGHB 
also counteracts sleep latency and promotes deep slow-
wave non-REM sleep  
[44, 50] 
, e.g. in depressed patients 
 
[51] 
. Human consolidation of sleep  
[52] with doses as 
low as 0.32–0.56 g/70 kg plasma concentration should be 
considered  
[53] 
. This effect is produced via the stimula-
tion of the GHB-specific receptors (GHBR), for which 
GHB has a high affinity  
[54] 
. GHBR has an ontogenetic 
molecular identity profile distinct from GABA 
B recep-
tors (GABA 
B 
R) and different subtypes  
[55] 
. In the me-
dian raphe nucleus and the dentate gyrus of the hippo-
campus, one of the regions with the highest expression 
of GHB high-affinity binding sites, as well as in several 
brain regions involved in sleep physiology, GHB but not 
baclofen as a pure GABA 
B agonist induced c-Fos expres-
sion  
[56, 57] 
. GHB in nano- to micromolar concentra-
tions  
[58] 
 exerts effects via the GHBR high-affinity site, 
and is suggested to be counteracted by the GHBR antag-
onist NCS-382  
[56] 
. Some studies have stated, in con-
trast, that pretreatment with NCS-382 potentiated, rath-
er than antagonized, a GHB-induced sedative hypnotic 
effect  
[59] 
, which was offset by others who questioned 
the antagonistic properties of NCS-382 on GHBR since 
it failed to block the effect of GHB on hypomotility and 
sedation/hypnosis  
[60–62] 
. The involvement of GHBR 
was confirmed when the specific GHBR agonist c-hy-
droxyvaleric acid was proved to mimic the sedative ef-
fects of GHB without binding to the GABA 
B 
R  
[58, 63] 
. 
Higher supraphysiological concentrations (such as 
ExGHB) downregulate the GHBR and eliminate the ton-
ic inhibitory control of GHBR on the GABA presynaptic 
element. As a result, both GABA release and GABAergic 
tone increase, inducing sleep  
[64] 
. Nevertheless, the ex-
act involvement of GHBR is still unclear. The effects of 
GHB on sleep, as has been suggested, have to be medi-
ated by the β 
1 
-subunit containing the α 
4 
-GABA 
A recep-
tor (GABA 
A 
R)  
[65, 66] which is highly sensitive to low 
concentrations of GHB (levels of 1.0 μ 
M 
 GHB or below 
in neuronal level); when the concentration increases an 
additional GABA 
A 
R δ-subunit would putatively become 
involved  
[66, 67] 
. In summary, GHB ingested in low dos-
es could initiate some physiological effects mediated 
mainly by GHBR, the β 
1 
-subunits of α 
4 
-GABA 
A 
R. These 
effects which have positive therapeutic functions may 
unfortunately provide a potential risk for abuse. Studies 
presenting the exact GHB concentration needed to pro-
duce all of these effects in humans are lacking ( 
table 1 
).
 
 
Characteristics of Behavioural Effects of ExGHB 
 
A special characteristic of GHB is the nonlinear oral 
absorption with limited capacity at higher doses  
[52, 68] 
. 
This leads to an increased interval of time to achieve

T 
max and a decrease in the normalized C 
max 
; for example, 
the average time to achieve peak concentration increased 
from 25 min at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg to 45 min at a dose 
of 50 mg/kg  
[17, 35] 
. The mean peak plasma concentra-
tion decreases with the presence of food in the stomach. 
GHB can be behaviourally active at doses as low as 
0.32 g/70 kg within 10–20 min after ingestion, with a 
short duration of action  
[53] 
. Higher doses (e.g. 0.56 g/70 
kg) produce a longer duration of action  
[32, 53] 
, thus an 
abrupt and dose-dependent effect. Furthermore, GHB ef-
fects are biphasic, with initial stimulant-like effects fol-
lowed by a mixture of sedation and stimulant-like effect 
as blood concentrations rise  
[69] 
. All of the above can 
explain the abuse pattern and the repeated GHB admin-
istration in doses between supraphysiological and phar-
macological levels per ingestion at a maximum interval of 
4 h to achieve the targeted reward effect every time.
 
Neurobiological Pathway of GHB Dependence 
 
Dose and Intensity of GHB Use in Relation to 
Dependence 
 
When GHB is administered in therapeutic doses, 
such as 3–9 g/night or day for the treatment of narco-
lepsy or alcohol dependence, the development of toler-
ance to the effect of GHB is unlikely to occur  
[70, 71] 
. In 
these studies, signs of physical dependence or symptoms 
of withdrawal after discontinuation were not reported 
 
[15, 72–74] 
. On the other hand, studies in baboons 
showed that lower doses such as 56 mg/kg can induce 
possible drug abuse effects  
[70, 75] 
. Repeated adminis-
tration of GHB at least 3–6 times per day can lead to 
tolerance and dependence on the behavioural and neu-
rochemical effects with apparent withdrawal symptoms 
 
[26, 76] 
. In humans, physical dependence has been de-
scribed within days to weeks of frequent and heavy use 
 
[76–78] 
. The average self-administered dose reported in 
dependent patients ranges from 32–67.2 g/day  
[79] to 
a maximum of 144 g/day  
[77] at intervals of 45 min to 
2.5 h. The severity of physical dependence on GHB is 
also a function of the dose and duration of abuse  
[80] 
. 
Thus, not unexpectedly, high doses and/or longer peri-
ods of dosing may be critical for physical dependence on 
GHB  
[70, 79] 
.
 
GHB Dependence Liability 
 
GHB use is considered to have a high dependence po-
tential. It may be related to the reward mechanisms in-
volved and the self-medication use patterns.
 
Reward Mechanism of GHB 
 
GHB shares the neuronal circuits that are believed to 
mediate the rewarding and drug-seeking behavioural as-
pects of most abused drugs including mesolimbic dopa-
minergic and glutamatergic neurons in the ventral teg-
mental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) 
 
[81–84] 
. Besides mediating rewarding effects, the activa-
tion of the mesolimbic dopamine system is also thought 
to be centrally involved in the induction of repetitive drug 
use  
[85] 
. GHB seems to have distinguishable pathways in 
these neurological processes which contribute to its de-
pendence liability. GHB has a bidirectional effect on the 
GABA 
B 
R, influencing the GABA neurons and dopamine 
neurons in opposite ways. GHB can indirectly reduce the 
excitability of the NAc. GHB has a recognized impact 
upon glutamate transmission levels and a neuromodula-
tor effect on serotonin.
 
GHB Bidirectional Effect on GABA 
B 
R and GABAergic 
Neurons Facilitate Dopamine Release. The properties of 
dependence/tolerance and behavioural effects of GHB 
seem to be consistent with the involvement of the 
 
GABAergic receptors, mostly the GABA 
B 
R  
[61, 86, 87] 
. 
GHB activates the GABA 
B 
R directly or indirectly through 
the metabolic conversion of GHB to GABA and the GHB-
mediated feedback control of GABA release  
[21, 67] 
. Sub-
types of the GABA 
B 
R (subunits GABA 
B1 and GABA 
B2 
) 
are important in mediating the effects of GHB  
[21, 88–
92] 
. GHB is distinguished by its discriminative stimulus 
properties on GABA 
B 
R, despite the low-affinity partial 
agonist character  
[85, 87] 
. GHB has a bidirectional effect 
on the GABA 
B 
R  
[85] 
, leading to opposite effects: an in-
creasing (stimulating) effect on one side and a decreasing 
(inhibitory) effect on the other side. This effect depends 
on the localization of the GABA 
B 
R and the type of the G-
protein-dependent ion inwardly rectifying potassium 
(GIRK) channel subunits, which mediate the inhibitory 
effects of G-coupled receptors like GABA 
B 
R  
[93] 
. The 
GIRK channels are responsible for maintaining the rest-
ing membrane potential and excitability of the neuron. 
Once the GABA 
B 
Rs are activated, they allow for the dis-
sociation of the G protein into its individual α-subunit 
and βγ-complex, so it can in turn activate the K 
+ chan-
nels. The G proteins couple the inward rectifying K 
+ 
channels to the GABA 
B 
R, mediating a significant part of 
the GHB inhibition effect  
[94] 
.
 
It has been shown that there is differential coupling ef-
ficacy (EC50) of GIRK channels in the VTA neurons; that 
is to say, the cell-specific expression of GIRK in VTA 
 
neurons can differ with respect to 1, 2c and 3 GIRK sub-
units. Mostly GIRK1/2 heteromultimeric channels are

70
expressed at the surface in GABA neurons and GIRK2c/3 
is expressed in dopamine neurons  
[85, 95, 96] 
. This dif-
ference in the coupling between GABA 
B 
R and GIRK sub-
units provides a mechanism for generating that bidirec-
tional modulation effect of GHB on the neuronal meso-
limbic dopamine system. Due to the increased efficiency 
or full activation of the GIRK channel subunits (1/2) cou-
pling to the GABA 
B 
R in the presynaptic GABAergic neu-
rons, these neurons are more sensitive to GHB, and can 
be targeted even at low doses of GHB as agonist  
[55, 85] 
. 
Despite that, these GABAergic neurons normally exert an 
inhibitory effect on the dopaminergic neuronal activity. 
The GHB activation of GIRK channels on GABA inter-
neurons suppresses their spontaneous activity and leads 
to disinhibition of the dopamine neurons, increasing 
their firing rate and enhancing VTA dopamine output 
 
[97] 
. In other words, GHB activation of the presynaptic 
GABA 
B 
R inhibits GABA release and this, in turn, disin-
hibits dopaminergic neuronal activity. GHB also lowers 
the tone in the GABAergic neurons, decreasing the firing 
rate of the postsynaptic neurons  
[81] 
. This can lead indi-
rectly to disinhibition of dopamine neurons. GHB also 
promotes the release of dopamine postsynaptically  
[26, 
53] 
 as putative GHB-producing neurons are surrounded 
by dopaminergic terminals, suggesting a direct interac-
tion between GHB and dopamine  
[98] 
.
 
In mice, repeated exposure to GHB increased the 
 
GABA 
B 
R GIRK channel coupling efficiency in the dopa-
mine neurons through the downregulation of the regula-
tor of G protein signalling-2 (RGS-2), a member of the 
RGS protein family  
[93] 
, another mechanism that might 
be associated with tolerance.
 
In summary, GHB leads to the suppression of the 
spontaneous activity of the GABA neurons through de-
creased transmitter release (presynaptic inhibition) and 
concomitant hyperpolarization (postsynaptic inhibi-
tion), besides an opposite direct effect on the dopamine 
neurons. These pathways cause disinhibition of the dopa-
mine neurons, especially in the VTA, which provides an 
explanation for its strong abuse potential. Added to that, 
GHB in high doses is metabolized at first to succinic acid. 
A sufficient amount of succinic acid is formed within the 
brain to inhibit the formation of GABA from glutamate, 
and results in lowered concentrations of GABA  
[34, 52] 
. 
Thus, the GABA system is downregulated, and its ability 
to inhibit neurotransmitter release is reduced. The fore-
going, especially the activation of the mesolimbic dopa-
mine system, can explain the increased reward addictive 
process which accentuates craving and GHB-seeking be-
haviour. 
 
GHB Affects Glutamate Transmission and Controls 
Hippocampal and NAc Glutamate Levels. Glutamate 
plays a key role in modulating both the progress of the 
sensitization of addiction behaviours and their expres-
sion such as drug-seeking  
[83] 
. Exogenously applied 
GHB controls hippocampal glutamate levels in a concen-
tration-dependent manner. It is reported that the sys-
temic administration of low doses of GBL, as a precursor 
of GHB, augments long-term potentiation/depolariza-
tion, causing transient plasticity in the CA1 intrahippo-
campal region and, mediated by GHBR activation, in-
creases hippocampal glutamate transmission  
[99–101] 
. 
GHB in millimolar concentrations exerts the same effect 
 
[100, 102] mediated by the N-methyl- 
D 
-aspartate recep-
tor (NMDAR)-gated ion channel  
[103] 
. There is an in-
trinsic connectivity between the hippocampus, known 
for its role in long-term memory, and the midbrain 
(VTA) dopamine regions and the NAc, known for their 
role in motivation and reward processing  
[104] 
. It is also 
speculated that the dopamine receptor (D1)-mediated 
increase of NMDA current on the dopamine neurons 
cause a rise in presynaptic glutamate release and elevate 
the activity of prefrontal glutamatergic input to the VTA 
 
[83] 
 – a sequence of synaptic events which induce GHB 
addiction-related behavioural sensitization. Glutamater-
gic plasticity in the NAc is critical for the expression of 
these behaviours  
[105] 
. GHB could indirectly reduce 
glutamate transmission via a bidirectional effect on the 
presynaptic glutamatergic GABA 
B 
R, where the heterore-
ceptors are more sensitive to GHB than the autorecep-
tors  
[106] 
. Therefore, the repeated engagement in GHB 
drug-seeking might, as with other drugs, cause an endur-
ing imbalance in glutamate homeostasis in the NAc, 
leading to a progressively greater reliance on the motor 
subcircuit and a reduced influence of the limbic subcir-
cuit  
[107] 
. In conclusion, the effect of GHB in glutamate 
release and transmission contributes to GHB addiction 
behaviour sensitization and expression by enhancing the 
memory of reward and the accompanied excitation ef-
fect.
 
GHB Has an Indirect Effect on the NAc Neurons. GHB 
shares with other drugs of abuse the ability to reduce the 
excitability of the NAc neurons, which contribute to its 
abuse potential  
[55, 81] 
. Conversely, GHB differs as it has 
no direct GABA 
B 
R-mediated effect on the medium spiny 
neurons of the NAc, as stated by Molnár et al.  
[62] 
. Thus, 
the reduced activity of NAc observed after systemic GHB 
administration  
[81] is related to an indirect effect of the 
cortical and limbic inputs outside the NAc. There, GHB 
activates post- and presynaptic GABA 
B 
Rs, hence hyper-

polarizing cells and decreasing their glutamate-mediated 
synaptic responses  
[108] 
, and then merging into the NAc 
and increasing the release of dopamine into the reward-
mediating NAc area  
[85] 
. This is in addition to a GHB 
main cellular effect in the NAc, executed via a repetitive 
transient elevation of astrocytic Ca 
2+ 
-independent neu-
ronal signalling  
[62, 109] 
. This in turn leads to neuronal 
hyperpolarization and suppresses baseline excitatory 
synaptic activity  
[110] 
, a reaction which has been proven 
to be mediated by a putative novel GHB agonist-specific 
and succinate-sensitive but NCS-382-insensitive recep-
tor in the astrocytic target  
[109] 
. This ability of GHB 
achieved at a lower dose than the concentration necessary 
to activate GABA 
B 
R  
[55, 62] is a powerful means for the 
rapid modulation of network activity, which can explain 
the rapid process and intense reward dependence effect 
of GHB.
 
The main reward pathway of GHB, as we mentioned 
earlier, is through its effect on GABA and glutamate. 
However, GHB is also suggested to have a neuromodula-
tor effect on serotonin, adding to the experienced reward 
effect and dependence liability potential.
 
Effect of GHB on Serotonin Amplifies Reward. Animal 
studies imply that GHB in pharmacological and recre-
ational doses induced an increase in serotonin turnover 
associated with a rapid intracellular metabolism, which 
may explain the absence of an increase in serotonin  
[97, 
111, 112] 
. A decrease in the extracellular concentration of 
serotonin was observed  
[111] 
, probably due to intraneu-
ronal deamination of newly synthesized serotonin which 
remains in the cytoplasmic pool. The GHB effects medi-
ated by GHBR increase tryptophan and its uptake in brain 
tissue by facilitating the dissociation of tryptophan from 
its albumin binding sites  
[1, 111, 113] 
. On the other hand, 
a GABA 
B 
R dual control of dorsal raphe serotonergic neu-
ronal activity has been suggested, which appears to be 
similar to that exerted on dopaminergic neuronal activity 
 
[44, 114] 
. An interrelationship between the serotonergic 
and dopaminergic systems, where dopamine release has 
been shown to be increased by serotonin, is suggested and 
confirmed by the described projections from the substan-
tia nigra and the VTA to the dorsal raphe nucleus and in 
the striatum  
[111, 115] 
. This can produce a direct inhibi-
tory effect on GABAergic terminals or interneurons and 
an indirect excitatory state  
[116] 
, contributing to the re-
warding euphoric effect of GHB.
 
Neurobiology of Self-Medicating with GHB Use 
 
GHB also has a neuromodulator effect on several oth-
er neurotransmitters and neurohormones which may ex-
plain its self-medicating use and may add to its high de-
pendence liability 
. 
 
Effect of GHB on Adrenergic Activity and Growth Hor-
mones. 
 The sustained daily administration of GHB for 
2- and 10-day periods in rats decreased both the sponta-
neous firing rate and the evoked burst firing of the locus 
coeruleus adrenergic neurons  
[44, 117] 
. This attenuation 
of an adrenergic neuron firing rate may be important to 
the anxiolytic and sedative effects associated with GHB. 
The exact mechanism by which GHB elicits its effects on 
these neurons is not clear. However, the ability of GHB to 
activate GABA 
A 
R and GABA 
B 
R, which has been identi-
fied on adrenergic neurons  
[114] 
, may partially explain 
this effect. GABA tonically inhibits cortical cholinergic 
neuronal activity  
[118] 
. GHB in repeated recreational 
doses mediated by GABA 
B 
R inhibits GABA and could 
subsequently increase cholinergic activity. GHB seems to 
increase the acetylcholine content in several rat brain re-
gions, including the hippocampus, and reduce extracel-
lular levels of acetylcholine  
[119] 
. This suggests that GHB 
reduces cholinergic neurotransmission effective in stress 
conditions and contributes to its anxiolytic effect, and 
hence to its abuse potential.
 
The effect of GHB on the cholinergic system can sub-
sequently result in a change of growth hormone levels. 
GHB-induced growth hormone secretion in humans 
 
[120] is due to the stimulation of not only the cerebral 
GABA 
B 
R  
[119] but also the specific pituitary GHBR 
 
[121] 
. The stimulating effect of GHB on growth hor-
mones seems to correlate with its capacity to induce slow-
wave sleep  
[122, 123] 
. This can contribute to its appeal for 
abuse amongst youth  
[124] 
.
 
GHB Neuromodulates Neurosteroids and Oxytocin. 
The decrease in neurosteroids and α 
4 
β 
1 
δ-GABA 
A 
R up-
regulation has been associated with increased anxiety  
[66, 
125] 
. Experiments in rats have suggested that GHB posi-
tively modulates GABA 
A 
R and NMDAR, leading to an 
increase in the synthesis of neuroactive steroids, such as 
the centrally synthesized progesterone analogues allo-
pregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxy corticosterone 
 
[126, 127] 
. This modulation can also explain the anxio-
lytic effect of GHB. GHB has been shown to reduce hypo-
thalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity in humans, 
which may lead to a decrease in stress hormones (e.g. cor-
ticotropin-releasing hormone) and an increase in oxyto-
cin. The effect of oxytocin is also facilitated by interac-
tions with the mesolimbic dopamine system  
[122] 
. The 
stimulation of oxytocin neurons might be one of the 
mechanisms by which the GHB modulates the dopami-
nergic tone. Both neurosteroids and oxytocin have been

discussed as playing a critical role in the regulation of so-
cial and sexual behaviour, anxiety, stress, aggression and 
the modulation of depression  
[128] 
.
 
Effect of GHB on the Opioid System. Despite the fact 
that the exact interactions between GHB and the opioid 
system are poorly understood, and no direct stimulation 
of μ-, δ- and κ-receptors could be shown, the GHB dopa-
mine release in the striatum is possibly accompanied by 
the release of endogenous opioids. This indicates a certain 
opioidergic analgesic and sedative effect of GHB which 
can be antagonized by naloxone  
[23, 129, 130] 
. All the 
aforementioned deliberated self-medication, anxiolytic, 
antidepressant and sedative effects of GHB, while form-
ing a part of its therapeutic potential, do however contrib-
ute to and play an important role in its potential addiction 
liability risk.
 
GHB Abuse versus Medical Use 
 
Despite the fact that the neurobiological mechanisms 
presented also apply to medically used GHB, studies have 
shown that patients using GHB medically have very low 
abuse liability  
[15] 
. This could be explained in some cases, 
such as for example in narcolepsy patients, by the exhib-
ited deficiency in the hypocretin/orexin system in the 
form of a decrease in mutations of the hypocretin/orexin 
gene, peptide and neurons. The hypocretin/orexin sys-
tem plays a role in the activation of the mesolimbic dopa-
mine system. This deficiency leads to a reduction of plea-
sure associated with reward processing, effects of addic-
tive drugs and risk-taking behaviour  
[131–133] 
. This 
might provide an explanation for the limited abuse po-
tential in narcolepsy patients. In general, it seems that 
GHB dependence associated with withdrawal symptoms 
is exhibited in animal models and human cases  
[131] 
when high doses with a minimum of 11–18 g/day  
[77, 
134] are used in an ‘
around the clock’
 frequency pattern 
 
[135] 
, which is not the case in the daily regime of 1–2 
doses applied in most therapeutic interventions.
 
Neurobiological Effects of Chronic GHB Abuse 
 
The action of GHB during chronic abuse in the meso-
limbic system is suggested to be mediated mainly through 
GABA 
B 
R  
[81, 82] 
. Nevertheless, the involvement of 
GHBR in other brain regions (such as the hippocampus) 
cannot be excluded  
[100] 
. Chronic GHB exposure desen-
sitizes GHBR and GABA 
B 
R, thus reducing their ability 
to affect neurotransmitter release  
[136] 
. Chronic GHB 
abuse can affect the most important neuroregulators. It 
downregulates the GABA system. Chronic GHB abuse 
firstly increases the glutamate level, subsequently de-
creasing the maximal density of NMDA binding sites, 
and downregulates NMDAR (e.g. in the frontal cortex) 
 
[47, 107] 
. By repeated exposure to higher doses of GHB, 
the dopamine neurons would be directly hyperpolarized, 
resulting in a decrease in VTA dopamine release  
[55, 85] 
accompanied with an upregulation of D1 and D2. Chron-
ic treatment of rats with GHB showed an increase of 
mRNA expression of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in 
brain regions that are rich in GHBR  
[137] 
, and the devel-
opment of tolerance to the effect of GHB on brain dopa-
mine levels, thus the mesolimbic dopamine system be-
comes ‘
hypofunctional’
 in the GHB-dependent brain. In-
creased serotonin turnover in chronic GHB abuse can 
lead to more inhibition in dopamine concentration in the 
brain  
[97] 
, as well as reduced noradrenergic and cholin-
ergic activity  
[117] 
.
 
In addition to these main effects mentioned of chron-
ic GHB misuse, GHB displays partial agonism at α 
4 
β 
1 
δ-
receptors compared with GABA, but does not replace the 
GABA effect, and in the case of chronic GHB abuse α 
4 
β 
1 
δ-
GABA 
A 
R can be upregulated due to the decreased GABA 
effect  
[66] 
. The neurosteroid effect can increase as the 
α 
4 
β 
1 
δ-subtype has been identified as an important target 
for neurosteroids. Finally, the possible involvement of the 
extrasynaptic subtypes of GABA 
A 
R may explain the seda-
tive effect during chronic GHB abuse despite the low 
GABA concentration. Chronic abuse is also associated 
with sustained opioid release.
 
 
Possible Neurobiological Mechanism of Withdrawal 
 
The discontinuation of GHB intake in chronic depen-
dent abusers reverses the neurobiological effect of GHB 
and produces a variety of (adverse) withdrawal symp-
toms. Due to the previously mentioned effects of GHB on 
GABA and glutamate which reflects on the different neu-
rotransmitter systems, the state observed during with-
drawal is likely to be the result of a complex interaction.
 
The withdrawal syndrome consists of several symp-
toms which may persist for several days. In the initial pe-
riod of abstinence, features include physical symptoms 
and signs such as tremors, miosis, sweating, tachycardia, 
palpitations, dyspnoea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, ab-
dominal pain and prevailing anxiety-related behaviour 
 
[76, 77, 138] 
. These are related to the stimulation of the

sympathetic system due to an increase in noradrenaline 
and acetylcholine as the result of an impairment of the 
feedback inhibition of GABA. In a study on rats, a sig-
nificant 33% increase in spontaneous noradrenergic neu-
ronal activity and a robust 79% increase in burst firing 
were found to be due to GHB withdrawal  
[117] 
. The loss 
of GHB ability to attenuate the locus coeruleus activity 
increases noradrenaline  
[117] 
 and may be important in 
causing anxiety during withdrawal.
 
In addition, the upregulation of α 
4 
β 
1 
δ-GABA 
A 
R has 
been associated with increased anxiety and hyperalgesia 
because of disinhibition of the GABAergic neuronal out-
put  
[66] 
. Part of the occurrence of arousal symptoms such 
as anxiety during GHB withdrawal can also be explained 
by the decrease in neurosteroid concentration, which 
is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA 
A 
R and 
NMDAR  
[55, 127, 128, 139] 
.
 
It has been suggested that, after the chronic abuse of 
drugs, dopamine release is compromised. Studies have 
pointed to the relevance of dopamine in withdrawal. It 
has been documented that, during withdrawal, striatal 
dopamine response or receptor availability was signifi-
cantly low in cocaine abusers  
[140] 
, and the striatal D2 
receptor was downregulated in alcohol and heroine abus-
ers  
[141, 142] 
. This neurological state seems to be differ-
ent in the case of GHB, and the low dopamine level is 
reversed rapidly to a high level after the cessation of GHB. 
The increase may persist and explain the latent psychosis/
delirium within 2–4 weeks after withdrawal/abstinence 
 
[22, 143] 
.
 
 
In more severe cases of withdrawal, patients experi-
ence symptoms such as hypertension, insomnia, agita-
tion, paranoia, disorientation, confusion, aggression and 
auditory and visual hallucinations  
[76] 
. These symptoms 
are (probably) mainly due to a sudden increase of dopa-
mine concentrations in the frontal cortex and thalamus 
associated with the presence of D1 and D2 upregulation 
status, an effect which can be hypothesized to be related 
to the increased activity of the hippocampal neurons and 
the inhibited effect of prelateral frontal cortex projection 
through D2 receptors  
[144] 
 and the reduced GABAergic 
transmission  
[88] 
. Due to these mechanisms, as well as to 
the associated manipulation of serotonin levels  
[115] 
, pa-
tients may also suffer from depression and, in severe cas-
es, they develop delirium and/or psychosis. One of the 
withdrawal complications of GHB described is an excited 
delirium syndrome. The clinical findings often include 
tachypnea, sweating, severe agitation, elevated tempera-
ture, delirium, non-compliance to and poor awareness of 
instructions, and lack of fatigue with unusual strength 
and pain tolerance  
[145, 146] 
. This state can be explained 
by the persistent dopamine increase together with sero-
tonin dysregulation, and it does not react upon the ad-
ministration of antipsychotics. Impairment of the sleep-
mediating effects of GHB via the β 
1 
-containing GABA 
A 
R 
leads to insomnia  
[66] 
. The thermic effects of GHB with-
drawal are dose dependent, and can occur due to a de-
crease in metabolic heat production and/or an increase in 
cutaneous circulation  
[1, 91] 
. The recognizable symp-
toms here are hyper- or hypothermia, tremors and reflex 
sweating. Likewise, due to the modulation of serotonin, 
uncontrolled muscle contraction caused by hyperkinesia 
and clonus takes place; in some studies, seizures were also 
observed  
[22, 76] 
. A serotonin syndrome-like state is gen-
erated. The low pain threshold observed, e.g. muscle pain 
and skin sensitivity, are possibly due to a decrease in the 
enhancement of endogenous opioid release. Further-
more, a reverse of the inhibition of cholinergic neuronal 
activity is followed by a significant increase in acetylcho-
line and noradrenaline levels  
[119] 
. These can slow down 
depolarization and increase neuronal excitability, result-
ing in irregularities in the heart rate and blood pressure, 
precipitating anxiety and insomnia, an increase in loco-
motor activity and the production of lactate and other 
toxins from skeletal muscle  
[117] 
. Besides the previously 
mentioned serotonin effect, the latter may cause rhabdo-
myolysis and finally lead to renal malfunction.
 
In summary, the withdrawal complications could be 
related to the increase in sympathetic activity, dopamine 
and serotonin, a decrease in opioids and the prolonged 
downregulation of the GABA system. Thus, during GHB 
withdrawal, GABA alone, as the most inhibitory neuro-
regulator of the brain, is no longer capable of opening the 
ion channels. On the other hand, glutamate, as the domi-
nant excitatory factor, undergoes dysregulation in addi-
tion to increases in both dopamine and serotonin levels 
in the brain. This is associated with the upregulation of 
D1, D2, NMDR and GABA 
A 
R. All the aforementioned 
result in cellular hyperexcitability that is easily stimulated 
by excitatory postsynaptic potentials, which are thought 
to be responsible for the previously mentioned complex 
withdrawal state ( 
table 2 
).
 
 
Clinical Implication on Withdrawal Treatment and 
Relapse 
 
The complexity of the neurobiological pathways and 
the involvement of several receptors and neurotransmit-
ters are repeatedly translated into severe withdrawal pre-

74
sentations and inconsistent treatment approaches. The 
abrupt cessation of long-term, high-dose GHB abuse can 
rapidly lead to a severe uncontrolled situation, e.g. psy-
chosis and aggression. A prolonged withdrawal state has 
been reported, lasting up to 3 weeks in several cases  
[77, 
138, 147, 148] and in some patients for 4 weeks to months 
 
[134] 
, a state which is characterized by disorientation, de-
pression, anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia  
[77, 134] 
. 
The intensity of the withdrawal symptoms can urge abus-
ers to maintain their illicit GHB levels by redosing fre-
quently and around the clock  
[21] 
, sometimes risking the 
danger of overdose and intoxication. Severe withdrawal 
symptoms such as aggression and agitation have, in some 
cases, been effectively treated with benzodiazepines such 
as the GABA 
A agonist  
[135, 143, 149] 
. In numerous other 
cases, however, a resistance to benzodiazepines was re-
ported and the delirium/psychosis and agitation state 
persisted despite the particularly high dosages of benzo-
diazepines, e.g. daily doses of diazepam 230 mg  
[79] or 
lorazepam 22.5 mg i.v.  
[138] 
. Treatment alternatives such 
as antipsychotic agents have been considered and caused 
a neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome state  
[150] 
. Bar-
biturates have been suggested  
[151] due to their ability to 
directly open both the GABA 
A 
R and, for a longer dura-
tion, the voltage-gated chloride channels  
[149] 
. Pento-
barbital and phenobarbital also have an antiglutamater-
gic effect via the AMPA (amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-
4-isoxazolepropionic acid)/kainate receptors  
[152] 
, and 
might lead to a decrease in the high glutamatergic state 
during withdrawal. Baclofen as a GABA 
B 
 agonist can also 
have a role in the treatment. The difference in the abuse 
liability of GHB and baclofen may be explained by the dif-
ferential coupling of GABA 
B 
R to GIRK channels  
[26, 85, 
153] 
. In contrast to GHB, baclofen, due to its high affin-
ity for the GABA 
B 
R, would at typical therapeutic levels 
inhibit both GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons and 
decrease dopamine release  
[85] 
. However, clinicians 
should consider the danger of a rapid dose which could 
induce psychosis and aggravate the withdrawal symp-
toms, as has occurred in some cases  
[154] 
. Benzodiaze-
pine-resistant cases were successfully and safely treated 
with pharmaceutical GHB titration and tapering  
[155] 
.
 
Nevertheless, GHB-dependent patients report high 
relapse rates shortly after GHB detoxification treatment 
 
[156] 
, which could be related to an increased impulsivity 
reaction. Despite the fact that it is clear that impulsivity 
is probably multifarious, where different aspects may 
contribute to different clinical syndromes, it is proposed 
that the balance between serotonin and dopamine trans-
mission is critical in the aetiology of impulse control 
 
[157, 158] 
. An abnormal increase in dopamine transmis-
sion at D2 and D3 receptors, e.g. treatment-induced im-
pulsivity in Parkinson’
s disease patients  
[159, 160] and 
serotonin disbalance or decrease, can increase impulsiv-
ity (impulsive choice) in humans. This is a state present 
during the GHB withdrawal phase and may persist for 
weeks. The impulsive behaviour in this case is character-
ized by impatience to delayed rewards (increased delay 
discounting) and an increased likelihood of premature 
responding  
[161, 162] 
. At the same time, other neu-

rotransmitters are thought to play a role here  
[162] such 
as, for example, manipulations of the noradrenergic sys-
tem  
[163] 
 and the decreased GABA levels in the dorso-
lateral prefrontal cortex  
[164] also presented during 
withdrawal. Thus, it could be expected that within a pe-
riod of several weeks after detoxification, GHB-depen-
dent patients might show an impaired capacity to inhib-
it their premature responses, a tendency towards risky 
decision making and a disregard for the relative value of 
delayed rewards, which may play a prominent role in the

Discussion and Conclusions 
 
GHB has become a popular drug in Europe over recent 
decades  
[7] 
. This popularity has resulted in an increase in 
GHB intoxication and, more recently, dependence. GHB-
dependent patients repeatedly suffer from a complicated 
withdrawal syndrome which can be life threatening  
[18, 
22] and challenging to treat. Therefore, in this review we 
aimed to follow the neurobiological pathway responsible 
for GHB dependence and to provide an explanation for 
the complexity of the withdrawal syndrome. Recent years 
have seen important developments in our understanding 
of GHB neurobiology, and some of the key cellular mech-
anisms of its actions have been revealed. The EnGHB sig-
nalling system in the brain can be easily, and similarly, 
stimulated by the peripheral administration of GHB, 
which follows almost identical metabolism routes and 
neurobiological pathways accountable for some of its 
therapeutic effects. The mechanism of action of ingested 
GHB is distinctive from many other drugs with depen-
dence properties, since it is distinguished by its bidirec-
tional discriminative stimulus properties on GABA 
B 
R. 
This can induce mainly GABAergic inhibition and dopa-
mine disinhibition. GHB does not lack a direct effect on 
the GABAergic neurons and glutamatergic pathways in 
the NAc, but it reduces the activity of the NAc through an 
indirect pathway producing cortical and limbic inputs 
outside the NAc. GHB is suggested to cause an elevation 
of the astrocytic Ca 
2+ 
-dependent neuronal signals within 
the NAc, which explains the rapid rewarding effect of 
GHB  
[62] 
. Several factors contribute to the potential 
GHB dependence liability, for instance the self-medica-
tion role in sleep regulation, the high rewarding euphoric 
state, and the anxiolytic and depression-modulating ef-
fect. The aforementioned confirm that GHB can be high-
ly addictive, with an intensive pattern of abuse, and has 
an obvious impact on the psychological state of the pa-
tients. Chronic GHB abuse, as presented in animal (rat) 
studies, may lead to the downregulation of the GABA sys-
tem  
[52] and to the upregulation of dopamine receptors 
D1 and D2  
[137] 
, and is also associated with upregulated 
NMDAR  
[100] 
. Chronic GHB abuse modulates sero-
tonin and noradrenaline levels  
[44, 111, 114] 
. The afore-
mentioned may predict the status of brain excitability 
during GHB withdrawal, manifested due to disinhibition 
of glutamate and an increase in dopamine release, which 
seems to differ in rate and speed from other drugs of 
abuse. The increased central dopamine levels during the 
GHB withdrawal phase can persist for 1–2 weeks because 
of slow elimination of the active metabolite carbon disul-
phide, leading to delayed psychosis with hallucinations 
and possible prolonged delirium  
[165] 
. In conclusion, the 
cessation of GHB abuse may result in a rapid withdrawal 
syndrome based on a complex interaction of different 
neurobiological mechanisms reached through the stimu-
lation of GABA 
B 
 and high-affinity GHB and GABA 
A re-
ceptors. It reveals a level of complexity in regulation and 
functional alterations well beyond the GABA system, in-
volving several key brain neuromodulators and neu-
rotransmitters, including glutamate, dopamine, sero-
tonin and noradrenaline modifications, as well as others 
such as neurosteroids and oxytocin. The withdrawal 
symptoms cannot all be related to a single dominant 
mechanism or neurological pathway, which implies the 
need for different medication combinations to proceed 
with treatment. Detoxification aids with a single drug 
class, such as benzodiazepines, gabapentin or antipsy-
chotics, will not be sufficient to avoid complications and 
have been shown to provoke treatment resistance  
[166, 
167] 
. Physicians should be aware of this complexity, 
which can be a legitimate explanation for the use of phar-
maceutical GHB, in a titration and tapering approach, as 
a promising detoxification treatment method which 
could make polypharmacy redundant, especially in the 
case of dependence on high doses of GHB. In the first 
weeks after the cessation of abuse, therapists should also 
consider a potential increase in the impulsive behaviour 
of GHB-dependent patients, related to a possible persis-
tent high level of dopamine and serotonin disbalance. 
This behaviour might lead to a rapid relapse in GHB use. 
Therefore, patients should receive intensive counselling 
immediately, preferably during detoxification, and 
should be provided with psychoeducation to decrease 
 
relapse rates. It is important, in light of the often unpre-
dictable and severe effects of GHB, to translate the ur-
gency of new insights into treatment tactics and preven-
tion of complications.

Several limitations of this review are noted. There is 
limited published research available to reveal the exact 
neurobiological targets of GHB in humans; therefore, the 
neurobiological profile dependence and abuse liability 
has mostly been illustrated from studies in animals. Stud-
ies often focused on GABAergic agonist ligands in gen-
eral and not specifically on GHB. It was difficult to deter-
mine whether an exact relationship exists between depen-
dence, withdrawal features and the amount of GHB 
ingested. Future human studies will be of great help in 
resolving these important issues.
