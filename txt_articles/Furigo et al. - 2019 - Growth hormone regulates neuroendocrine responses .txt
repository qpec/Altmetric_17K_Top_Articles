Weight loss triggers important metabolic responses to conserve energy, especially via the fall
in leptin levels. Consequently, weight loss becomes increasingly difficult with weight regain
commonly occurring in most dieters. Here we show that central growth hormone (GH)
signaling also promotes neuroendocrine adaptations during food deprivation. GH activates
agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons and GH receptor (GHR) ablation in AgRP cells miti-
gates highly characteristic hypothalamic and metabolic adaptations induced by weight loss.
Thus, the capacity of mice carrying an AgRP-specific GHR ablation to save energy during food
deprivation is impaired, leading to increased fat loss. Additionally, administration of a clini-
cally available GHR antagonist (pegvisomant) attenuates the fall of whole-body energy
expenditure of food-deprived mice, similarly as seen by leptin treatment. Our findings indi-
cate GH as a starvation signal that alerts the brain about energy deficiency, triggering key
adaptive responses to conserve limited fuel stores.

everal energy-saving adaptations are triggered by the
hypothalamus during food deprivation, including increases
in skeletal muscle work efficiency, and inhibition of ther-
mogenesis, thyroid and reproductive axes1–7. The fall in leptin
levels is a starvation signal that plays a critical role inducing
endocrine and autonomic adaptations during situations of
negative energy balance1–4. Accordingly, the prevention of
declining leptin levels via exogenous leptin treatment attenuates
starvation-induced suppression of gonadal and thyroid axes in
mice and humans1, 3. In addition, leptin administration reverses
the
effects
of
sustained
weight
reduction
on
energy
expenditure2, 4. However, leptin replacement does not completely
prevent the neuroendocrine adaptations induced by weight
loss1, 3, 5, indicating the existence of critical additional, but still
unknown, starvation signals. The identification of other cues that
induce such adaptive responses is imperative since the long-term
efficacy of obesity treatments is low, in part due to body’s defense
mechanisms that decrease energy expenditure during weight
loss7.
In the present study, we investigated the central effects of
growth hormone (GH) on energy homeostasis as GH fulfills
several requisites of an energy-deficiency signal to the brain. For
example, GH secretion increases during situations of nutrient
deficiency, such as hypoglycemia8 or food deprivation3, 8–10.
Additionally, GH receptor (GHR) is widely expressed in hypo-
thalamic areas implicated in energy balance regulation, including
the arcuate nucleus (ARH)11. However, the functional role of
central GH signaling for energy homeostasis has not been fully
defined. Here, we uncovered the importance of brain GH sig-
naling for the regulation of energy homeostasis under normal
conditions and during food deprivation. Our findings indicate
that although GH does not play an important role modulating the
energy balance in ad libitum fed animals, GH is a key cue that
signals energy deficiency to the brain, triggering neuroendocrine
responses to conserve body energy stores.

 phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcrip-
tion 5 (pSTAT5), a marker of GHR activation11. We observed
that GH robustly induced pSTAT5 in several hypothalamic
nuclei, whereas few pSTAT5-positive cells were found in PBS-
injected mice (Fig. 1a, b). Since agouti-related protein (AgRP)
neurons in the ARH are major regulators of energy home-
ostasis12, we investigated whether they are responsive to GH. We
found that 91.2 ± 3.0% of AgRP neurons presented pSTAT5 after
i.p. GH injection (Fig. 1c), suggesting that GH acts on AgRP cells.
Although intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of GH
caused no significant changes in food intake during the first 4 h of
measurement, C57BL/6 mice exhibited increased food intake and
reduced energy expenditure 24 h after the injection (Fig. 1d, e).
GH injection also increased hypothalamic AgRP and neuropep-
tide Y (NPY) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, whereas proo-
piomelanocortin
(POMC)
expression
remained
unaffected
(Fig. 1f). Thus, GH injection mimicked the effects induced by
chemogenetic activation of AgRP neurons13. To confirm that GH
activates AgRP neurons, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were
performed in brain slices of AgRP-reporter mouse (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1). We found that 25% of ARH AgRP neurons (3 out 12
recorded cells from 5 mice) were depolarized by GH (Fig. 1g),
increasing the resting membrane potential and action potential
frequency of responsive cells, compared to baseline (Fig. 1h, i). In
order to determine whether the effect of GH is direct in AgRP
cells (independent of action potential-mediated synaptic trans-
mission), a new set of recordings was performed in the presence
of the voltage-gated sodium channel antagonist tetrodotoxin
(TTX; 1 µM) and synaptic blockers (20 µM 6-cyano-7-nitroqui-
noxaline-2,3-dione
(CNQX),
50 µM
2-amino-5-
phosphonovalerate (Ap-5) and 50 µM picrotoxin). We also
found that GH application in the presence of TTX and synaptic
blockers depolarized 25% of ARH AgRP neurons (3 out 12
recorded cells from 4 mice), changing in +7.7 ± 1.4 mV their
resting membrane potential (t(2) = 5.277, P = 0.0341). Altogether,
these findings indicate that exogenous administration of GH
induces an orexigenic response via activation of AgRP neurons.
GHR ablation in AgRP neurons causes no metabolic imbal-
ances. To study in detail the importance of GH signaling in AgRP
neurons, we generated mice carrying an AgRP-specific GHR
ablation. As expected, AgRP GHR knockout (KO) mice did not
show GH-induced pSTAT5 in AgRP neurons (Fig. 1j), while a
normal pSTAT5 distribution was observed in other neuronal
populations (Supplementary Fig. 2). AgRP GHR KO mice dis-
played a similar body weight, food intake, energy expenditure,
respiratory quotient, ambulatory activity, adiposity, lean body
mass, body length, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity
compared to control animals (Supplementary Fig. 3a-h and
Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). GHR ablation in AgRP cells also did
not affect leptin sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 5), ghrelin-
induced food intake or ghrelin-induced c-Fos expression in the
ARH (Supplementary Fig. 6a–d). These results suggest that GHR
expression in AgRP neurons is unnecessary for the regulation of
energy homeostasis under normal circumstances or for the
response to key hormones that rely on AgRP neurons to mod-
ulate energy homeostasis. Thus, endogenous fluctuations of
plasma GH levels likely do not play an important role modulating
the energy balance in ad libitum fed mice.
GH triggers neuroendocrine adaptations during weight loss.
AgRP neurons express c-Fos during food deprivation as an
indicator of increased cell activity14, 15. Notably, the amount of
fasting-induced c-Fos-positive cells in the ARH was reduced in
AgRP GHR KO mice (Fig. 2a–c), despite the number of ARH
AgRP cells remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 7). We then
introduced an AgRP-tdTomato genetic background to our mouse

 model to study if the ablation of GHR in AgRP cells impairs
fasting-induced increments of c-Fos in AgRP neurons. We found
that the number AgRP neurons positive for c-Fos was smaller in
fasted AgRP GHR KO mice as compared to fasted control mice,
while the number of non-AgRP cells positive for c-Fos remained
unchanged between the groups (Fig. 2a–c). This observation
suggests that AgRP neurons are unable to appropriately sense
food deprivation without GH signaling. Since AgRP neurons are
critically involved in neuroendocrine adaptations induced by
weight loss12, 16, 17, control and AgRP GHR KO mice were further
studied either in ad libitum or during 60% food restriction (F.R.).
Two days of F.R. (40% of the normal intake) was sufficient to
increase hypothalamic NPY and AgRP expression in control
mice, whereas GHR ablation in AgRP neurons prevented these
effects (Fig. 2d, e). F.R. reduced hypothalamic POMC expression,
but AgRP-specific GHR ablation did not significantly affect this
response (Fig. 2f). Next, we assessed whether AgRP GHR KO
mice exhibit a normal endocrine response to weight loss. F.R.
reduced serum T4 and testosterone concentrations in control
mice, whereas AgRP GHR KO mice showed a blunted suppres-
sion of these hormones (Fig. 3a, b). Additionally, F.R. increased
serum corticosterone concentration in control mice, but this
increase was prevented in AgRP GHR KO mice (Fig. 3c). While F.
R. also reduced serum leptin levels (Fig. 3d) and increased serum
GH concentration (Fig. 3e), GHR ablation in AgRP cells caused
no significant effects in these responses. F.R. or GHR ablation in
AgRP cells did not affect circulating prolactin levels (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8). We also assessed interscapular brown adipose
tissue uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) mRNA. F.R. suppressed
UCP-1 expression in control mice, whereas this reduction was
attenuated in AgRP GHR KO animals (Fig. 3f). Altogether, our
findings strongly indicate that GH signaling in AgRP neurons is
required for the induction of key neuroendocrine responses that
conserve energy during F.R.
Energy-conserving effects of GH signaling in AgRP neurons.
To test if the lack of adaptive responses to energy deficits sig-
nificant impacts on energy balance, we recorded the whole-body
energy expenditure of both groups of mice during 60% F.R.
Control mice decreased their energy expenditure during F.R.
(Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9), which is in accordance with
the adaptive responses that conserve energy during this situa-
tion7. However, the decrease in energy expenditure of AgRP GHR
KO mice during F.R. was significantly smaller, as compared to
control mice, suggesting that they did not save energy as effi-
ciently as control mice (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9).
Consequently, AgRP GHR KO mice exhibited a higher rate of
weight loss (Fig. 4b), which was predominantly due to fat mass
loss (Fig. 4c), but also to lean mass loss (Fig. 4d). No differences
between groups were observed in the respiratory quotient or
ambulatory activity during F.R. (Supplementary Fig. 10). Since
GH
secretion
during
F.R.
is
essential
to
preserve
blood
glucose9, 10, we daily monitored glycemia and found that AgRP
GHR KO mice exhibited lower glycemia during the initial days of
F.R. when compared to control animals (Fig. 4e).
As GH secretion displays sexual dimorphism18–20, we also
determined whether AgRP GHR KO females show blunted
neuroendocrine responses to F.R. As seen in males, AgRP GHR
KO females showed an attenuated increase in hypothalamic
AgRP and NPY mRNA levels during F.R., whereas POMC gene
expression was not affected by GHR ablation (Supplementary
Fig. 11a–c). In contrast to our observations in male mice, the
decrease in energy expenditure of AgRP GHR KO females during
F.R. was similar as seen in control females (Supplementary
Fig. 11d). However, AgRP GHR KO females exhibited increased
weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 11e) and decreased glycemia
(Supplementary Fig. 11f) during F.R., as compared to control
females, which is similar to our observations in control vs. AgRP
GHR KO males.
To test whether GH signaling in AgRP neurons regulates
energy homeostasis in other conditions of nutrient deficiency,
control and AgRP GHR KO male mice received i.p. injection of 2-
deoxi-D-glucose (2DG), which causes glucoprivation21. The
counter-regulatory response triggered by 2DG was similar
between the groups (Supplementary Fig. 12). However, control
mice exhibited the expected 2DG-induced hyperphagia22, while
this response was prevented in AgRP GHR KO mice (Fig. 4f).
GHR ablation in leptin receptor cells or the entire brain. Since
distinct leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing neurons are known to
be involved in the metabolic adaptations that conserve energy
during F.R.6, 13, 16, 17, 23, we generated mice carrying GHR
ablation either in LepR cells (Fig. 5a–c and Supplementary
Fig. 13) or the entire brain (nestin-derived cells; Fig. 5d and
Supplementary Fig. 14). Thus, we investigated whether GHR
ablation in a large number of neuronal populations produces
additional effects on the metabolic adaptations induced by weight
loss. In contrast to AgRP GHR KO mice, both LepR GHR KO
and brain GHR KO mice exhibited increased body weight and
length (Fig. 5e, f). However, LepR GHR KO mice showed reduced
body adiposity and serum leptin levels compared to control
animals, whereas brain GHR KO mice had higher lean body mass
and
upregulation
of
hypothalamic
GH-releasing
hormone
expression (GHRH; Fig. 5g–j). Thus, central GHR ablation likely
impaired GH negative feedback, leading to increased body
growth, especially in brain GHR KO mice. Despite these changes,
food intake, energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, ambulatory
activity and leptin sensitivity were not affected in these mice
(Supplementary Fig. 15a–e).
Next, we investigated whether LepR GHR KO and brain GHR
KO mice were able to reduce their energy expenditure during F.R.
As seen in AgRP GHR KO mice, both LepR GHR KO and brain
GHR KO mice showed defects in their ability to save energy
during F.R. (Fig. 6a), leading to a greater weight loss (Fig. 6b).
Notably, a sharp decline in energy expenditure of LepR GHR KO
mice was observed during the last days of F.R. (Fig. 6a), which
may reflect an early depletion of their body energy reserves since
these mice had lower adiposity (Fig. 5g). Hence, some LepR GHR
KO mice became lethargic during F.R. and had to be killed and
removed from the study (Supplementary Fig. 16). As seen in
AgRP GHR KO mice, GHR ablation in LepR-expressing cells
prevented the F.R.-induced suppression of UCP-1 expression in
the brown adipose tissue (BAT; Fig. 6c). LepR GHR KO mice also
exhibited lower glycemia during F.R. (Fig. 6d) and attenuated
2DG-induced hyperphagia compared to control or brain GHR
KO mice (Fig. 6e). Thus, we confirmed the ability of central GH
signaling to promote energy saving adaptations during F.R. in
different mouse models; however, GHR ablation in broader
neural
populations
did
not
produce
additional
effects
as
compared to AgRP GHR KO mice, emphasizing a crucial role
of AgRP neurons mediating GH responses.
Pegvisomant increases the metabolic rate of food-deprived
mice. To assess whether the energy-conserving effects of GH can
be pharmacologically manipulated, we tested in mice the effects
of a clinically available GHR antagonist (pegvisomant). Initially,
we determined whether pegvisomant treatment inhibits GH sig-
naling in mice. We found that C57BL/6 mice treated with two
daily i.p. injections of pegvisomant during four consecutive days
showed reduced plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)

 levels (Fig. 7a) and higher GHRH mRNA in the hypothalamus
(Fig. 7b), as compared to PBS-treated mice. These results show
that pegvisomant impairs GH signaling; thus, this drug acts as a
GHR antagonist in mice. Next, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to
60% F.R. while receiving two daily i.p. injections of either peg-
visomant or mouse recombinant leptin. Pegvisomant attenuated
the decline in energy expenditure during F.R. to the same mag-
nitude than leptin (Fig. 7c). However, this prevention was
observed only in the second day of F.R. in both groups and did
not affect significantly the weight loss (Fig. 7c, d). In addition,
pegvisomant treatment did not change the glycemia during F.R.,
whereas leptin-treated mice showed a reduction in glycemia,
especially during the last days of F.R. (Fig. 7e).
Discussion
Clinical trials have indicated that leptin administration failed as
an efficient therapeutical approach to treat obesity24–26, although
it attenuates the neuroendocrine and metabolic changes induced
by weight loss1–5. Actually, many researchers agree that leptin’s
main role is to signal starvation (via falling leptin levels) and
consequently produce appropriate behavioral and metabolic
responses that increase the chances of survival27, 28. Our findings
point out that GH is an additional cue that signals energy defi-
ciency to the brain, triggering key adaptive responses to conserve
body energy stores (Fig. 7f). These findings help to explain why
leptin replacement does not completely reverse the neuroendo-
crine adaptations induced by weight loss1, 3, 5, since both GH and
leptin play a role informing the brain about energy deficiency.
Our study also presents further evidence that AgRP neurons
are fundamental for integrating information of various starvation
signals to modulate energy homeostasis12. Current results not
only show that the activity of AgRP neurons is influenced by
plasma GH levels but also highlight the brain as a key target of
GH signaling.
We observed that ~90% of AgRP cells increased pSTAT5 levels
in response to a systemic injection of GH. However, just 25% of
ARH AgRP neurons depolarized after GH stimulus in an ex vivo
setting. Methodological or biological factors may explain this
quantitative
difference.
For
instance,
technical
procedures
inherent to the experimental approach, such as brain slicing, may
impair the ex vivo responsiveness of AgRP neurons. Also, it is
possible that the signaling pathway or electrical effects of GH on
AgRP neurons may differ. In line with this possibility, it has been
shown that only a percentage of LepR-expressing neurons,
including POMC and AgRP neurons, change their resting
membrane potential after leptin application29, 30. Our findings
also suggest that the genomic actions of GH, presumably via
STAT5 or STAT5-associated transcription factors, may have a
more relevant physiological role than its effects on resting
membrane potential. Indeed, knockout mice for Stat5a/b genes
exhibit similar defects as those caused by GH deficiency, at least
in terms of body and tissue growth31–33.
Here, c-Fos expression in ARH AgRP neurons was measured
after 24 h of fasting, while the importance of endogenous GH
signaling in AgRP cells for the neuroendocrine responses to
weight loss was evaluated in calorie-restricted mice that received
40% of their normal intake. Such F.R. protocol was chosen for the
current study because it was previously shown to induce robust
increments of plasma GH levels9, 10. Furthermore, 2 days of F.R.
produced similar neuroendocrine effects in mice than those
caused by an acute fast, including suppression of thyroid and
reproductive axes, increased glucocorticoid secretion, increase in
hypothalamic AgRP and NPY expression and decreased POMC

 expression1, 15. Additionally, AgRP GHR KO mice showed no
change in serum leptin levels compared to control animal, while
they lost more fat mass during F.R. Although the reasons for the
lack of difference in circulating leptin levels in animals with
different degrees of adiposity are unknown, it is possible to
speculate that changes in autonomic innervation or hormonal
milieu could have affected leptin synthesis and secretion by adi-
pose tissue. In fact, POMC and AgRP neurons modulate auto-
nomic nerve activity in various tissues, including fat depots34, and
these neurons can regulate fasting-induced fall in leptin levels,
independently of changes in fat mass35.
Some differences were observed between our conditional
knockout models. While AgRP GHR KO mice showed no
changes in growth or basal metabolism, both LepR GHR KO and
brain GHR KO mice displayed increased weight gain over time,
associated with a higher body length. The lack of difference in the
growth of AgRP GHR KO mice, as compared to control mice, is
interesting since previous studies suggested that NPY plays a role
regulating GH secretion and consequently somatic growth36–38.
Thus, other populations of NPY neurons may be involved with
this control or simply GHR expression does not affect how ARH
AgRP/NPY neurons modulate the somatotropic axis. On the
other hand, GHR ablation in the entire brain was expected to
increase GH secretion due to impaired GH negative feedback.
Indeed, we observed a significant increase in GHRH mRNA levels
in the hypothalamus of brain GHR KO mice. A recent study
showed that ~45% of ARH GHRH-positive neurons are respon-
sive to leptin39. Thus, GHR ablation in LepR cells probably
increased body length by affecting GH negative feedback in a
subpopulation of ARH GHRH neurons. LepR GHR KO mice also
showed decreased adiposity, although no differences in food
intake and energy expenditure were observed in this model. Since
the reason for the lower body fat mass in LepR GHR KO mice is
unknown, we believe that it is likely related to a larger number of
cells affected by GHR deletion, including peripheral cells that also
express the LepR. Although the energy-conserving effects of GH
signaling were clearly confirmed in both LepR GHR KO and
brain GHR KO mice, only LepR GHR KO animals showed
reduced glycemia during F.R. and a blunted 2DG-induced
hyperphagia. It is possible that genetic deletions affecting a
large number of cells may produce more pronounced compen-
satory effects during development masking the effects induced by
the lack of GHR in the entire brain. In addition, Nestin-Cre
transgene expression was previously shown to produce a phe-
notype per se which could have interfered with the responses
observed in the present study40, 41.
Pegvisomant is a modified version of human GH that has a
much higher half-life than GH and acts as a competitive
antagonist of the GHR42, 43. Here, we show that daily treatment
with pegvisomant in mice reduces plasma IGF-1 levels and
increases hypothalamic GHRH mRNA expression, strongly sug-
gesting that this compound impairs GH signaling. Importantly,
our subsequent study with pegvisomant treatment provided a
proof of concept that a clinically available GHR antagonist pro-
duces energy-saving adaptations during food deprivation. Thus,
pharmacological compounds that are capable of targeting GH
signaling may prevent compensatory decreases in energy expen-
diture during F.R. and consequently represent a promising
approach to facilitate weight loss and improve the efficacy of
obesity treatments. However, additional pharmacological studies
are needed to improve the treatment efficacy in terms of dose,
route of administration or combination of administered drugs. In
conclusion, our findings uncovered a novel physiological role for
GH, which is to signal caloric deficiency to the brain, triggering
important adaptive responses to conserve energy via activation of
AgRP neurons.

Laboratory) or Nestin-Cre mouse (B6.Cg-Tg(Nes-cre)1Kln/J, The Jackson Labora-
tory). Control mice were homozygous for the loxP-flanked Ghr allele, whereas their
littermates carrying the Cre alleles were considered the conditional knockout mice.
In some histological and electrophysiological experiments, AgRP-IRES-Cre or
LepR-IRES-Cre mice were also crossed with the Cre-inducible tdTomato-reporter
mouse (B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, The Jackson Laboratory),
allowing the visualization of AgRP or LepR neurons via expression of the tdTomato
fluorescent protein. The mice in these strains were in the C57BL/6 background.
Mice were weaned at 3–4 weeks of age and their mutations were confirmed by
genotyping the DNA that had been previously extracted from the tail tip
(REDExtract-N-Amp™ Tissue PCR Kit, Sigma). The genetically modified mouse
models and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were produced and maintained in standard
conditions of light (12 h light/ dark cycle) and temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Mice
received a regular rodent chow diet (2.99 kcal/g; 9.4% calories from fat). All
experiments were carried out in compliance with the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were previously
approved by the Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals of the Institute of
Biomedical Sciences at the University of São Paulo.
Brain histology. To visualize GH-responsive cells in the brain, adult mice (n =
3–4/group) received an acute i.p. injection of porcine pituitary GH (pGH; 20 µg/g,
from Dr. A.F. Parlow, National Hormone and Peptide Program (NHPP), National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) and were perfused 90 min
later. To assess fasting-induced c-Fos expression in the ARH, control and AgRP
GHR KO mice carrying the Cre-inducible tdTomato-reporter protein (n = 5/
group) were perfused after 24 h of fasting. Ghrelin-induced c-Fos expression was
measured in control and AgRP GHR KO mice (n = 4–5/group) perfused 90 min
following a subcutaneous injection of ghrelin (0.2 µg/g body weight (b.w.), Global
Peptide, cat. no. C-et-004). For the perfusions, mice were deeply anesthetized with
isoflurane and perfused transcardially with saline, followed by a 10% buffered
formalin solution (150–200 mL per mouse). Brains were collected and post-fixed in
the same fixative for 30–60 min and cryoprotected overnight at 4 °C in 0.1 M PBS
containing 20% sucrose, pH 7.4. Brains were cut (30 µm thick sections) in the
frontal plane using a freezing microtome. To label pSTAT5, brain sections were
rinsed in 0.02 M potassium PBS, pH 7.4 (KPBS), followed by pretreatment in an
alkaline (pH > 13) water solution containing 1% hydrogen peroxide and 1%
sodium hydroxide for 20 min. After rinsing in KPBS, sections were incubated in
0.3% glycine and 0.03% lauryl sulfate for 10 min each. Next, sections were blocked
in 3% normal donkey serum for 1 h, followed by incubation in anti-pSTAT5Tyr694
primary antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling; #9351) for 40 h. For the immuno-
fluorescence reaction, sections were rinsed in KPBS and incubated for 90 min in
AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, Jackson Laboratories). Sec-
tions were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and the slides were coverslipped
with Fluoromount G (Electron Microscopic Sciences, Hatfield, PA). For the
immunoperoxidase staining, sections were incubated for 1 h in biotin-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson Laboratories) and next for 1 h with an avidin-

 biotin complex (1:500, Vector Labs). The peroxidase reaction was performed using
0.05% 3,3’-diaminobenzidine, 0.25% nickel sulfate and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide
resulting in a black nuclear staining. The slides were coverslipped with DPX
mounting medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The reaction to label c-Fos was similar
to the pSTAT5 protocol, except that brain sections were incubated in anti-c-Fos
antibody (1:20,000, Ab5, Millipore) for 48 h. Photomicrographs were acquired with
a Zeiss Axiocam HRc camera coupled to a Zeiss Axioimager A1 microscope (Zeiss,
Munich, Germany). Images were digitized using Axiovision software (Zeiss). The
ImageJ Cell Counter software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) was used to manually
count the number of cells in the areas of interest.
Electrophysiology. To examine the acute effects of GH on the membrane excitability
of AgRP neurons, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in hypotha-
lamic slices of male AgRP-reporter mouse (8–12 weeks old). Mice were decapitated,
their brains were collected and immediately submerged in ice-cold, carbogen-
saturated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 124 mM NaCl,
2.8 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 5 mM glucose
and 2.5 mM CaCl2). Coronal sections (250 µM thick) from a hypothalamic block were
cut with a Leica VT1000S vibratome and then incubated in oxygenated aCSF at room
temperature for at least 1 h before recording. Slices were transferred to the recording
chamber and allowed to equilibrate for 10–20 min before recording. The slices were
bathed in oxygenated aCSF (30 °C) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. In current-clamp
mode, current injection (<± 8 pA) was used to normalize membrane potential. The
resting membrane potential was monitored for at least 5 min (basal), followed by the
addition of pGH to the bath (5 µg/mL) for approximately 5 min. The frequency of
action potentials was determined by analyzing the firing rate 2 min immediately prior
to pGH administration and during the last 2 min of drug application. Changes in
resting membrane potential were also evaluated in the presence of TTX (1 µM) and
synaptic blockers (CNQX at 10 µM, AP-5 at 50 µM and picrotoxin at 50 µM). The
membrane potential values were compensated to account for the junction potential
(−8 mV).
Evaluation of energy and glucose homeostasis. The body weight of AgRP GHR
KO, LepR GHR KO and brain GHR KO mice, as well as of their respective control
animals, was monitored weekly. When mice reached approximately 20 weeks of
age, they were single housed and food intake was daily measured for 5 to 7
consecutive days. Then, mice were subjected to a glucose tolerance test (2 g glucose/
kg b.w.; i.p.) and to an insulin tolerance test (1 IU insulin/kg b.w.; i.p.). To
determine O2 consumption (energy expenditure), CO2 production, respiratory
exchange ratio and locomotor activity (through infrared beam sensors), mice were
placed in the Oxymax/Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS;
Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA). After an adaptation period of
3 days inside the CLAMS, these metabolic parameters were evaluated for 4 con-
secutive days. Therefore, the results presented were the average of this period. Total
body fat and lean mass were measured by time-domain nuclear magnetic reso-
nance (TD-NMR) using the LF50 body composition mice analyzer (Bruker, Ger-
many). Body adiposity was also determined by summing the weight of the
perigonadal, subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat pads. The nose-anus length was
assessed to determine body growth.
Leptin and ghrelin responsiveness. To assess leptin sensitivity, mice received
an i.p. injection of either PBS or mouse recombinant leptin (2.5 µg/g b.w.; from
Dr. A.F. Parlow, NHPP, USA) 3 h before their dark phase, and their food intake
were recorded 4, 14 and 24 h following the injection. The food intake after PBS
injection was compared with the food intake after leptin administration. The
orexigenic response to ghrelin was determined in mice that received a sub-
cutaneous injection of either PBS or ghrelin (0.2 µg/g b.w., Global Peptide, cat. no.
C-et-004). Food intake was assessed 60 min after the injections.
Metabolic effects induced by food restriction. To investigate the neuroendocrine
and metabolic changes induced by weight loss, mice were initially single housed
and their food intake was recorded. Then, mice were subjected to a 60% food
restriction protocol, in which each mouse received 40% of their normal intake 2 h
before lights off for 5 to 7 consecutive days. During this period, the metabolic
parameters were continuously assessed by the CLAMS, and their body weight, body
composition (by TD-NMR) and glycemia were monitored at the time the food
was provided. Daily calculation of VO2 took into consideration the changes in
body weight during food restriction to provide the value relative to body weight
(ml/kg/h). Changes in oxygen consumption (energy expenditure) during food
restriction were then reported as percentage of the values obtained from baseline
(typically 2 to 3 days of recordings before food restriction). In addition, subgroups
of adult (approximately 12-week-old) control and AgRP GHR KO mice were killed
at the beginning of the light cycle (8:00 am) on the second day of food restriction.
Mice with ad libitum access to food were killed at the same time. The hypotha-
lamus, interscapular BAT and trunk blood were collected for subsequent analyses.

 Drug treatment during food restriction. Adult wild-type C57BL/6 male mice
were subjected to the same 60% food restriction protocol described earlier, except
that they received twice a day (at 9:00 am and 6:00 pm; lights on 8:00 am) i.p.
injections of either mouse recombinant leptin (2.5 µg/g b.w. per injection; NHPP,
USA), human GHR antagonist (pegvisomant; 20 µg/g b.w. per injection; Somavert®;
Pfizer, Inc.) or control solution (pegvisomant diluent). Food deprivation-induced
changes in energy expenditure and body weight were assessed as previously
described.
Metabolic effects induced by hypoglycemia. To produce a counter-regulatory
response to hypoglycemia, mice received an i.p. injection of 2DG (0.5 mg/kg b.w.;
Sigma). We initially evaluated the effects of 2DG on glycemia for 180 min. Then,
mice received i.p. injections of either PBS or 2DG and their food intake was
recorded 2, 3 and 4 h afterwards.
Hormone measurements. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kits were used to determine the serum concentration of leptin
(Crystal Chem), T4 (Calbiotech), testosterone (Calbiotech), corticosterone (Arbor
Assays), GH (Millipore), IGF-1 (R&D Systems) and prolactin (Sigma).
Gene expression analysis. Total RNA from the hypothalamus or interscapular
BAT was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Assessment of RNA quantity
and quality was performed with an Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (Biotek).
Total RNA was incubated in DNase I RNase-free (Roche Applied Science). Reverse
transcription was performed with 2 µg of total RNA with SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers p(dN)6 (Roche Applied Science).
Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using the 7500TM Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems). Relative quantification of mRNA was calculated by 2-ΔΔCt.
Data were normalized to the geometric average of β-actin, glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and cyclophilin A and reported as fold
changes compared to values obtained from the control group (set at 1.0). The
following primers were used: AgRP (forward: ctttggcggaggtgctagat; reverse: aggactc
gtgcagccttacac), β-actin (forward: gctccggcatgtgcaaag; reverse: catcacaccctggtgccta),
cyclophilin A (forward: tatctgcactgccaagactgagt; reverse: cttcttgctggtcttgccattcc),
GAPDH (forward: gggtcccagcttaggttcat; reverse: tacggccaaatccgttcaca), GHR (for-
ward: atcaatccaagcctggggac; reverse: acagctgaatagatcctgggg), GHRH (forward: tat
gcccggaaagtgatccag; reverse: atccttgggaatccctgcaaga), NPY (forward: cagatactactc
cgctctgcg; reverse: gggctggatctcttgccata), POMC (forward: tagatgtgtggagctggtgc;
reverse: ccagcgagaggtcgagtttg) and UCP-1 (forward: gaggtgtggcagtgttcattg; reverse:
ggcttgcattctgaccttca).
Statistical analysis. All results were expressed as mean ± s.e.m. The paired two-
tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare the effects of GH or vehicle adminis-
tration in the same animals, and in the electrophysiological data (before and during
GH application). The unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for compar-
isons between two groups. When three groups were compared simultaneously, we
used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Newman–Keuls multiple
comparison tests. Data was analyzed using two-way ANOVA when appropriate,
followed by Newman–Keuls or Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc
tests. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. We
considered P values < 0.05 to be statistically significant.

to conserve body energy stores via activation of agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons. All results were expressed as mean ± s.e.m.
