abstract
BACKGROUND: Food and beverage marketing has been associated with childhood obesity. We 
quantified the number and type of food or beverage brands promoted by music celebrities, 
assessed the nutritional quality of the products, and examined Teen Choice Award data to 
assess the celebrities’ popularity among adolescents.
METHODS: This was a descriptive study. A list of music celebrities associated with the 
2013 and 2014 Billboard Hot 100 Chart, which ranks songs according to sales and radio 
impressions, was compiled. Data on celebrity endorsements were gathered from official 
company Web sites, YouTube commercials, an advertising database, and media reports. 
Nutritional quality of foods was assessed according to the Nutrient Profile Index, whereas 
nonalcoholic beverages were evaluated based on calories from added sugar. Teen Choice 
Award nominations were used to measure the celebrities’ popularity among adolescents.
RESULTS: Of the 590 endorsements made by the 163 celebrities in the sample, consumer goods 
(eg, fragrances, makeup) represented the largest endorsement category (26%), followed 
by food and beverage (18%) and retail (11%). Sixty-five celebrities were collectively 
associated with 57 different food and beverage brands owned by 38 parent companies. 
Of these 65 celebrities, 53 (81.5%) had ≥1 Teen Choice Award nomination. Forty-nine 
(71%) of the 69 nonalcoholic beverage references promoted sugar-sweetened beverages. 
Twenty-one (80.8%) of the 26 endorsed foods were energy dense and nutrient poor. Baauer, 
will.i.am, Justin Timberlake, Maroon 5, and Britney Spears had the most food and beverage 
endorsements.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that music celebrities who are popular among 
adolescents endorse energy-dense, nutrient-poor products.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Exposure 
to unhealthy food advertisements is associated 
with excessive consumption. Studies have shown 
that celebrities’ food endorsements promote 
higher product preferences. Research has also 
demonstrated an association between familiarity 
with songs mentioning alcohol and drinking behaviors 
in adolescents and young adults.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The study examines the use 
of music celebrity endorsements of food and beverage 
products. Furthermore, it assesses nutritional 
value of endorsed products and the popularity of the 
celebrity endorser among adolescents.

The Institute of Medicine and surgeon 
general have stated that individual-
level health-promoting behavior 
changes are very difficult to achieve 
because of the current unhealthy 
environment.1 Food and beverage 
marketing has been identified 
as a significant environmental 
contributor to childhood obesity.1–6 
Exposure to food marketing 
promotes excess consumption, 
increased purchase requests, and 
higher preference for the product 
among children and adults.2–5 A 
cued-recall assessment demonstrated 
that fast food advertising receptivity 
(ie, exposure and response to ads) 
is associated with youth obesity.7 
Food and beverage companies 
spend $2 billion annually on youth-
targeted advertisements.1 Public 
health experts have called for a shift 
toward marketing messages that 
encourage consumption of healthy 
foods and beverages and policies to 
establish protective thresholds for 
food marketing exposure targeting 
youth.8–12
Research has shown that the use of 
celebrity endorsements in marketing 
can enhance brand equity and the 
desirability of a product, leading 
consumers to more positively 
associate with, and easily recognize, 
brands.13–15 This effect is particularly 
relevant in the context of music 
celebrity endorsements because 
adolescents ages 12 to 18 years 
report spending almost 2 hours 
listening to music each day, 
16 
and black and Latino youth spend 
3 hours listening to music daily.17 
This frequent exposure is notable 
in the context of previous research 
that showed that 20% of popular 
US songs mentioned alcohol brands 
and associated alcohol with positive 
consequences (eg, wealth, sex, 
luxury).18 This exposure is linked to 
self-reported alcohol consumption, 
with 1 study demonstrating that 
familiarity with songs that mention 
alcohol brands was associated with 
drinking behaviors in adolescents 
and young adults.19 These findings 
are consistent with industry data 
showing that celebrity endorsement 
campaigns are more likely than 
noncelebrity campaigns to lead to 
substantial increases in immediate 
profits and long-term increases in 
profitability.20 Given the high level 
of brand exposure created by these 
multi–million-dollar endorsement 
deals, public health experts have 
expressed concern over the 
potential effects of these marketing 
techniques on adolescents, who 
represent a vulnerable population 
well attuned to popular music 
trends. Indeed, grassroots action and 
media attention regarding celebrity 
athletes’ endorsement of tobacco 
have coincided with declining 
tobacco endorsements21, 
22 and could 
provide useful lessons for addressing 
music celebrities’ endorsements 
of unhealthy food and beverage 
products.
The food industry capitalizes on 
music celebrities’ popularity with 
youth by engaging in multi–million-
dollar endorsement deals. In 
2012, Beyoncé Knowles signed an 
endorsement deal with Pepsi worth 
an estimated $50 million, and Justin 
Timberlake received an estimated 
$6 million for his involvement 
in the McDonald’s “I’m lovin’ it” 
tune.23, 
24 In addition, beverage 
industry publications credit Latino 
rapper Pitbull’s endorsement of Dr 
Pepper with 4.6 million advertising 
impressions (ie, any views or 
exposure to ads) and boosting 
Dr Pepper sales among Latinos 
by 1.7%, despite overall declines 
in carbonated soft drink sales.25 
Although this instance is anecdotal, 
it is important to note the industry 
perceives it as an example of effective 
celebrity endorsements.
Recent food marketing research 
has focused predominantly on 
children <12 years old, whereas 
adolescents’ exposure and response 
to advertising have been relatively 
understudied. More research on 
adolescents and food marketing is 
needed, especially in recognition 
of adolescents’ unique standing 
as impressionable consumers 
with more purchasing power and 
independence than their younger 
counterparts.26, 
27 In fact, research 
demonstrates that adolescents can be 
highly impulsive with purchases, in 
part because of peer pressure, 
28 
fear of negative evaluation, 
28 
and underdeveloped self-control 
systems.29 This descriptive study 
was designed to examine the use 
of music celebrity endorsements 
of food and nonalcoholic beverage 
products. We aimed to determine 
the number and type of music 
celebrity endorsements, evaluate 
the nutritional quality of endorsed 
products, and assess how popular 
these music celebrities are among 
adolescents and the general public.
METHODS
We listed the top 100 songs that 
appeared on the 2013 and 2014 
Billboard Hot 100 Chart, which 
ranks the year’s “most popular 
songs across all genres, ranked by 
radio airplay audience impressions 
as measured by Nielsen Music, 
sales data as compiled by Nielsen 
Music and streaming activity data 
provided by online music sources.”30 
These songs were used to identify 
celebrities associated with various 
endorsements. Some celebrities 
appeared multiple times on the 
lists, and some songs had multiple 
celebrities listed as performers. 
Thus, we identified 163 unique 
music celebrities for the study. We 
then cataloged every endorsement 
associated with each music celebrity 
between 2000 to 2014 by searching 
for celebrity names on AdScope, an 
advertisement database that contains 
all forms of ads (eg, television, radio) 
dating back to 1997. Researchers 
also searched for official commercials 
on YouTube or endorsement

announcements in news media 
sources.
After we listed endorsements 
associated with each celebrity who 
appeared on the 2013 and 2014 
Billboard Hot 100 Chart, a research 
assistant blind to the purpose of the 
study sorted all endorsed brands into 
the following 11 categories: food and 
nonalcoholic beverages, automotive, 
consumer goods (eg, makeup, 
headphones), communications (eg, 
cell phone companies), finance (eg, 
credit cards), sports (eg, Nike), retail, 
tobacco and alcohol, services (eg, 
Google), airlines, and other. These 
categories were developed on the 
basis of the sponsorship categories 
created by the marketing firms.31
To assess the popularity of these 
music celebrities among adolescents, 
we compiled a list of music 
celebrities who appeared on the 
Teen Choice Award nomination 
lists between the years 2000 and 
2014. The Teen Choice Awards is 
an annual awards show that uses 
adolescent viewers’ votes to honor 
celebrities in music, movies, sports, 
television, and fashion.32 We then 
created endorsement profiles that 
indicated the number and type of 
endorsements associated with each 
celebrity in the sample and the 
number of times each celebrity was 
nominated for a Teen Choice Award.
To assess the general population’s 
exposure to the celebrities and 
their food and nonalcoholic 
beverage endorsements, 2 raters 
independently searched YouTube for 
the celebrity and product or company 
name and cataloged the number 
of views associated with each of 
the videos. Inclusion criteria for 
YouTube videos consisted of official 
commercials, promotional videos, or 
music videos in which the celebrity, 
their song, or the endorsed product 
was featured that were uploaded 
between 2000 and 2014. Even 
though the Billboard Hot 100 list is 
restricted to 2 years for our study, 
capturing 14 years of endorsements 
enabled us to create a comprehensive 
profile that portrays a fuller picture 
of their prominence as an endorser. 
YouTube videos in languages 
other than English were excluded. 
Viewership data for YouTube videos 
represent the total number of views 
as of January 2016.
Nutritional Analysis
We reviewed all advertisements 
featuring endorsements by music 
celebrities in the sample. A celebrity 
was considered to endorse a product 
if an advertisement featured the 
celebrity, the celebrity’s song, or a 
music group to which the celebrity 
formerly belonged at the time of 
the endorsement. The nutrition 
information for products associated 
with celebrities’ endorsements was 
collected from official company Web 
sites or actual nutrition labels.
A nutrition score for each endorsed 
food product was generated from 
Nutrient Profile Model (NPM). The 
NPM was selected because it has 
been used in food marketing research 
studies and is used as the standard 
for child-targeted food marketing 
in United Kingdom.33–35 The NPM 
provides a score that represents the 
healthfulness of each food product 
based on nutrient content. Foods 
gain points for nutrients that should 
be limited (calories, saturated fat, 
sodium, or sugar) and lose points 
for nutrients that are encouraged 
(fruits, vegetables, nuts, fiber, and 
protein). Higher scores represent 
less healthful products, whereas 
lower scores represent products with 
healthy qualities. To translate the 
NPM score to an easy-to-understand 
scale, the final NPM score was 
converted to a Nutrient Profile Index 
(NPI), where 1 is the worst nutrition 
score and 100 is the best score. The 
NPI has been used in previous food 
marketing research.36 The NPI uses 
the following formula: NPI score = 
−2 × NPM score + 70. A score ≥64 
is considered the threshold for 
products that can be advertised to 
children in the United Kingdom. One 
limitation of the NPM is that it codes 
some sugar-sweetened beverages 
(SSBs) as healthy. Therefore, we 
coded nonalcoholic beverages 
into 11 drink categories, 3 sugary 
drink subcategories, and 5 other 
drink categories as outlined in the 
Rudd Center’s Sugary Drink FACTS 
Report.37
In some instances, celebrities 
endorsed a brand that did not 
mention a specific product or a 
brand that offered mixed meals (eg, 
fried chicken, biscuits, cole slaw) 
that could not easily be entered in 
the NPM formula. In those cases, we 
generated the NPM scores based on 
the Rudd Center’s Fast Food FACTS 
Report, 
38 a comprehensive analysis 
of all menu items for a variety of food 
and nonalcoholic beverage brands. In 
cases where data were not available 
through the FACTS report, we 
assessed the nutrition information 
for every food product associated 
with that brand and averaged the NPI 
scores of the entire line of products 
listed on the company Web site. 
Five companies (Chili’s, Pizza Hut, 
Longhorn Steakhouse, Wingstop, 
and Michael Jackson’s Premium 
Chocolate) were excluded from the 
nutritional analyses because the 
serving size information for most 
items was unavailable or unusable 
(eg, “serving size equals one slice”).
Marketing Analysis
To assess the popularity of the 
celebrities among adolescents, we 
compiled a list of music celebrities 
nominated for a Teen Choice Award 
between the years 2000 and 2014. 
We cross-referenced the list of 
Teen Choice Award nominees 
with celebrities in our sample who 
endorsed food and nonalcoholic 
beverages. To assess broad audience 
exposure (ie, adults, adolescents, 
children), we quantified the 
number of YouTube video views 
associated with the celebrities’ food

and nonalcoholic beverage brand 
endorsements.
RESULTS
We identified 590 endorsements 
associated with 163 unique music 
celebrities in the sample. Consumer 
goods was the largest endorsement 
category (26%), followed by food and 
nonalcoholic beverages (18%) and 
retail (11%). We cataloged 107 food 
and beverage brand endorsements, 
although several brands appeared 
multiple times because multiple 
celebrities endorsed the brand. 
Overall, full-calorie soft drinks 
were the most commonly endorsed 
food or nonalcoholic beverage 
product. In contrast, water-
related endorsements appeared 3 
times in the form of a Brita filter 
endorsement, CORE Hydration, 
and WAT-AAH!’s water brand. The 
celebrities with the highest number 
of food and nonalcoholic beverage 
endorsements were Baauer (N = 5), 
will.i.am (N = 4), Britney Spears 
(N = 3), Justin Timberlake (N = 3), 
Maroon 5 (N = 3), Pitbull (N = 3), and 
Jessie J (N = 3) (Table 1).
Endorsements by Food or Beverage 
Brand
There were a total of 107 food 
and beverage endorsements in 
the sample, associated with 38 
parent companies. Fifty-one music 
celebrities were associated with 69 
beverage references in 63 beverage 
advertisements (ie, ads were defined 
as television commercials, print ads, 
or promotional videos [eg, concert 
sponsored by Pepsi]) (Table 2). 
The number of references (ie, 
references were defined as the image 
of beverage can or bottle, verbal 
mention of the brand, or image of the 
parent company logo) exceeds the 
number of ads because 5 of the ads 
included a reference to multiple types 
of beverages (eg, Pepsi ad showing 
both Pepsi Regular can and Diet Pepsi 
can). Of the 69 beverage references, 
49 were for SSBs, 7 were for non-SSBs 
(ie, diet beverage or water), and 13 
references were associated with 
verbal mention of the brand or image 
of the parent company logo (ie, no 
product shown). Full-calorie soft 
drinks were the largest category of 
endorsements overall (N = 33). In 
terms of company prominence in 
endorsements, PepsiCo endorsements 
appeared most frequently (N = 23), 
followed by the Coca-Cola Company 
(N = 8) and Dr Pepper Snapple 
(N = 4) (Table 3). Seven no-calorie 
nonalcoholic beverage endorsements 
included diet soft drinks (N = 5), 
water (N = 1), and milk (N = 1).
Twenty-nine music celebrities were 
associated with 38 food endorsements 
in our sample. Thirty-three of those 
endorsements were unique because 
several brands (eg, McDonald’s) were 
endorsed by multiple celebrities. 
Fast food was the largest category 
of food endorsements (N = 6), with 
McDonald’s accounting for the most 
food endorsements in the sample. The 
remaining endorsements involved 
chips, candy, cereal, non–fast food 
restaurants, and miscellaneous snacks. 
There were no endorsements for 
fruits, vegetables, or whole grains, but 
one celebrity endorsed Wonderful 
Pistachio, which was the only food 
product with a healthy score (66/100).

and Beyoncé was the second most 
watched video in the sample, with 
>42 million views since the video was 
loaded on YouTube in 200940 (Table 
4). Pepsi’s 23 celebrity endorsement 
commercials had the most collective 
YouTube views in the sample (N = 
160 293 981) (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
This descriptive study demonstrates 
that music celebrities often endorse 
energy-dense, nutrient-poor 
products. Food and nonalcoholic 
beverage brands were the second 
largest endorsement category 
behind consumer goods (eg, 
fragrances, makeup). Full-calorie 
soft drinks were the largest category 
of food or nonalcoholic beverage 
endorsements, and Baauer, will.i.am, 
Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, 
Maroon 5, Pitbull, and Jessie J had 
the most food/nonalcoholic beverage 
endorsements. Celebrity ads appear 
to be popular, with >312 million 
viewers watching the 94 videos 
associated with celebrity food and 
nonalcoholic beverage endorsements 
in this sample on YouTube alone. 
However, it is impossible to conclude 
that all these viewers are indeed 
unique because a portion of the 
views may be repeated exposure. 
Although YouTube does not provide 
demographic data on viewers, 
the frequent appearance of these 
celebrities on the Teen Choice Award 
nomination lists suggests high levels 
of popularity among adolescents.
Obesity has become such a pressing 
public health issue that society must 
acknowledge the human suffering 
and costs associated with diabetes, 
obesity, and associated comorbidities. 
Musicians, actors, and other celebrities 
can be tremendously influential, 
particularly for the young fan base that 
may be swayed by their endorsements. 
Celebrities should leverage their 
influence to promote more healthful 
messages, and more effort should 
be made to reduce the exposure of 
children and adolescents to marketing,

particularly for unhealthy food 
and nonalcoholic beverages. Every 
year, American children see 4700 
advertisements, and adolescents view 
5900 advertisements.1 The scale of this 
exposure is similar to that of youth-
targeted tobacco advertisements, 
which permeated television, 
video games, sporting events, and 
movies.41–44 However, voluntary 
corporate pledges related to food 
marketing (eg, Children’s Food and 
Beverage Advertising Initiative) focus 
only on reducing marketing to children 
<12 years old, whereas tobacco policies 
restrict advertisements targeted to 
anyone <18 years old.
Given the heavy targeting of 
adolescents36–38 and the amount 
of money adolescents spend on 
food and beverages, voluntary food 
marketing reduction pledges should 
expand to include adolescents. 
Expanding voluntary pledges to 
include adolescents would also be 
consistent with the food marketing 
reduction recommendations 
published by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (2006), 
45 which 
encourage pediatricians to support 
local and national efforts to reduce 
food marketing while also counseling 
patients to limit screen time. 
Finally, grassroots action and media 
attention can help make celebrity 
food endorsements a public liability 
in the same way these methods 
have been used for other celebrities 
who endorsed tobacco.21 Although 
a number of professional athletes 
endorsed tobacco in the early 1900s, 
policy changes and shifts in public 
perception of smoking coincided 
with declining endorsements; when 
Liu Xiang, an athlete on the Chinese 
Olympic team, endorsed cigarettes 
in 2006, public outcry led him 
to be labeled an “inappropriate” 
ambassador for tobacco, 
demonstrating a strong shift in public 
opinion about endorsements.22
This study has some limitations. 
We may not have captured every 
endorsement that occurred between 
2000 and 2014, which would lead 
to an underestimate of exposure to 
celebrity endorsements. Furthermore, 
we do not have direct adolescent 
viewership data, and 21 commercials 
were not available on YouTube, thus 
leading to conservative estimates 
of exposure. One limitation related 
to assessing popularity among 
adolescents includes criticism 
of the Teen Choice Awards’ lack 
of transparency in whether the 
winners are ultimately determined 
by adolescents’ votes or by the 
show’s corporate producers.46 This 
limitation may lead to inaccuracies in 
determining celebrities’ popularity 
among adolescents.
Future research should examine the 
effect of music celebrities’ food and 
nonalcoholic beverage endorsements 
on consumption, particularly 
for children and adolescents. 
Additionally, researchers should 
examine the effect of music celebrity 
endorsement on youth attitudes 
toward food brands and purchase 
intentions. The popularity of music 
celebrities among adolescents makes 
them uniquely poised to serve 
as positive role models, so these 
celebrities should be aware that 
their endorsements could exacerbate 
society’s struggle with obesity and 
endorse healthy products instead.
These results can inform policies 
designed to address the use of 
celebrities in food marketing. Many 
food and beverage companies have 
agreed not to target children <12 
years old, but these pledges should 
include adolescents as well. To 
reduce exposure to energy-dense 
food and beverage endorsements, 
research is needed on the regulations 
of food marketing in environments 
highly populated by both children 
and adolescents.
