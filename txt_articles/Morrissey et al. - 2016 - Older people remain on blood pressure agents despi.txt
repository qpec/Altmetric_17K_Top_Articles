Abstract
Background: the use of antihypertensive medication in older people in order to prevent cardiovascular events is well estab-
lished. The use of such agents has been encouraged by incentive schemes in the United Kingdom including the Quality and
Outcomes Framework. In addition, many guidelines recommend good blood pressure (BP) control in the elderly. However,
in older people antihypertensives can cause adverse effects related to hypotension.
Aim: the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of low BP and impact on outcomes, particularly in the presence of
antihypertensive treatment, in a primary care population of older people.
Design: a retrospective observational cohort study in people over the age of 70 years registered with primary care providers
in Kent.
Results: a total of 11,167 patients over 70 years old were analysed, 6,373 female (57%). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was
below 120 mmHg in 1,297 people (844 on antihypertensives), below 110 mmHg in 474 (313 on antihypertensives) and
below 100 mmHg in 128 (89 on antihypertensives). Hypotension was independently associated with mortality, acute kidney
injury and hospital admission.
Conclusions: the results demonstrate that low SBP is associated with adverse events, it is possible that the pursuit of BP
control at a population level may lead to over-treatment in certain groups of patients. This may result in an increased inci-
dence of adverse events particularly in older people.
Keywords: older people, hypotension, hospital admission, acute kidney injury, mortality
Introduction
Randomised controlled trials show that treating hyperten-
sion in old age reduces strokes and other cardiovascular
events [1, 2]. However in elderly patients with multiple co-
morbidities there is a trade-off between using antihyperten-
sives to reduce the risk of future disease and increased risk
due to adverse effects of medication [3–5].
Most older people have hypertension and many older
patients also have other co-morbidities therefore they are at
risk of adverse effects of drugs used to treat each condition
[3, 5–9]. Drug treatments for symptomatic relief of other
conditions
common
in
old
age
such
as
prostatism,
Parkinson’s disease and depression have hypotensive effects
[7–9]. Preventative treatments used in accordance with
national guidelines for heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney
disease (CKD) may also cause hypotension [10, 11]. Adverse
effects due to hypotension include syncope and falls, which
can cause serious injury such as hip fracture, and head injury
as well as a number of symptoms, which impair daily quality
of life for the older population [3, 5], including dizziness,
unsteadiness and fear of falling [12]. Atypical presentations
common in older people such as weakness, lethargy, ‘off
legs’, confusion and visual impairment may also be due to
drug side effects [5, 6]. Physiological changes of ageing affect
drug metabolism and increase the propensity to side effects
of medication [6]. The risks of hypotension in older people
are compounded by other age-related changes including pos-
tural instability increasing the risk of falls [13]. Once medica-
tion is initiated, it is not always regularly reviewed and titrated
to adjust for physiological changes associated with ageing and
the effects of additional drugs [5, 6].

 Adverse reactions to medications are implicated in a sig-
nificant number of hospital admissions [14, 15]. Rising
acute admissions especially of older patients with multiple
co-morbidities are contributing to ever-increasing NHS
costs, once admitted older people with multiple co-
morbidities have longer lengths of stay [16, 17]. An emer-
gency admission to hospital is a disruptive and unsettling
experience for the older person exposing them to new clin-
ical and psychological risks and increasing their dependency
[18]. Admissions of frail elderly people to care homes are
frequently precipitated by a hospital admission [19]. Acute
kidney injury (AKI) is a common occurrence in hospital
and is associated with increased short- and long-term
mortalities.
There is no clear guidance or drug trial evidence to inform
how far to lower blood pressure (BP) with antihypertensives
in the older old [1, 4, 20, 21]. A review of hypertension trials
data indicated that for octogenarians Systolic blood pressure
(SBP) <130 mmHg and diastolic BP <65 mmHg should be
avoided [4]. The need for randomised controlled trial evi-
dence on a representative sample of older people with mul-
tiple
co-morbidities
has
been
highlighted
[3].
NICE
Hypertension Guidance advises that for the oldest old (80
and over) the target BP is higher than in younger people [20].
Some guidance extends the 150/90 target to patients over
65s [21]. Accompanying guidance included yearly face-to-face
medication review to look for side effects and titrate dosage
according to symptoms and BP in older patients on antihy-
pertensives [20].
Aims
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of
low BP in the presence of antihypertensive treatment, and
its impact on outcomes particularly in a primary care
population. In this study, outcomes of patients on antihy-
pertensives with SBP <120 mmHg were analysed. These
were stratified into three groups those with SBP <120
and ≥110 mmHg, <110 and ≥100 mmHg and those with
SBP <100 mmHg.
Methods
This study used a prospectively collected database devel-
oped from an unrelated study investigating automated inter-
vention in CKD. Data collection commenced in 2005 by
extracting
data
from
primary
care
databases
using
MIQUEST [22]. All patients who had serum creatinine
checked in primary care had a data set extracted usually at
around monthly intervals between 2005 and 2015, the
application is known as System for Early intervention in
Kidney Disease (SEIK) [23]. This study used a retrospect-
ive analysis of data obtained from this database. Data on
the medication, BP, blood results and co-morbidity of
patients aged 70 was obtained. Co-morbidity data were
obtained directly from the primary care record, these were
coded by primary care doctors caring for the patients.
Medication record was extracted directly from electronic
prescription data used in primary care systems. The primary
aim was to estimate the prevalence of hypotension of older
people in primary care, associated medication prescribed
and co-morbidity. Data were obtained from the 13 practices
actively participating in SEIK.
Inclusion criteria:
• Patients with a serum creatinine estimation.
• Patients with a BP measurement between 30 June 2011
and 01 January 2012.
• Patients registered in participating practices.
Exclusion criteria:
• Patients not screened after 01 June 2013.
• Patients under 70 years of age.
• Request to be withdrawn from the study/database.
The BP and medication data were collected according to
the schedule in Figure 1. Definition of index BP was the
first one after 30 June 2011. Definition of ‘previous blood
pressures’ was all systolic and diastolic BPs 12 months prior
to and including the index BP. Follow-up BPs were all the
systolic and diastolic BPs in the 12 months following the
index BP. Current medication was defined as medication
prescribed between the index BP and in the 4 months pre-
vious. Follow-up medications were all medications pre-
scribed between 8 and 12 months after the index BP date.
Current co-morbidity included all those extracted and
reported prior to the index BP date. Follow-up co-morbid-
ity included any reported up to 12 months after the index
date.
Changes
in numbers
of antihypertensives
were
assessed by BP strata.
The data were stratified into four groups according to
index SBP:
• SBP ≥120 mmHg.
• SBP <120 mmHg but ≥110 mmHg.
• SBP <110 mmHg but ≥100 mmHg.
• SBP <100 mmHg
Data on admissions, episodes of AKI and mortality
were obtained from hospital records.
The association between SBP strata and survival was
examined. The primary outcome assessed was all cause
mortality.
The
results
were
expressed
as
unadjusted
Kaplan–Meier survival curves.

 Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess fac-
tors associated with death and AKI in follow-up.
Finally, the probability of dying at 1 year was estimated
using logistic regression analysis. To allow for possible con-
founding variables, a series of three models were fitted with
varying adjustments for other variables to allow comparison
between the categories
The models fitted were as follows:
• Unadjusted relationship between strata of SBP and death.
• The relationship between strata of SBP and death,
adjusted for age and gender only.
• The relationship between strata of SBP and death,
adjusted for age, gender, antihypertensive use and co-
morbidities.
Results
Data were included from a total of 11,167 patients aged 70
and over, 6,373 female (57.1%). The mean index SBP was
138 mmHg (SD 19, range 90–220). The mean index dia-
stolic BP was 75 mmHg (SD 11, range 40–120).
The mean SBP prior to the index BP (n = 8,758) was
140 mmHg, SD 16 (range 82–193 mmHg). The mean dia-
stolic BP before index (n = 8,771) was 76 mmHg, SD 9
(range 35–117 mmHg).
Baseline characteristics of patients included in the study
are described in Table 1. Coded co-morbidities at index
were as follows (see Table 1): 12.4% had a diagnosis of
hypertension, 7.0% diabetes, 4.2% coronary artery disease
(CAD), 8.6% CKD and 1.3% HF. The patients were taking
between 0 and 5 antihypertensives at index: 34.1% were
taking an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI),
17.6% were taking a diuretic, 16.4% an angiotensin receptor
blocker (ARB), 13.2% a calcium channel blocker, 13.0% a
beta-blocker, 3.9% an alpha-blocker and 0.4% a centrally
acting antihypertensive.
Of patients over 70 years old, 128 (1.2%) patients had a
SBP <100 mmHg at index. Of these, 39 (30.5%) were not
taking antihypertensives, 40 (31.3%) were taking one antihy-
pertensive, 22 (17.2%) were taking two, 22 (17.2%) were
taking three, 4 (3.1%) were taking four and 1 (0.8%) was
taking five antihypertensives. Patients in the strata with
lower BP were on more antihypertensive medication (P
< 0.001). The majority of patients either had their antihy-
pertensives increased or unchanged over the study period.
Patients with an index SBP of <100 mmHg 41% had no
change in medication, 34% had their medication reduced.
In contrast those with an index SBP of ≥120 mmHg, 36%
had no change in medication and 43% had their medication
increased.
Unadjusted analysis of survival by index SBP strata
demonstrated that 1 year survival was poorer in those with
lower BP (97.1% BP >120 mmHg vs. 83.6% BP <100
mmHg), this result is displayed graphically using survival
curves in Supplementary Figure 2 (see Supplementary data
are available in Age and Ageing online).
Using binary logistic regression analysis factors signifi-
cantly associated with mortality included age, gender,
index diagnoses of stroke and HF, index BP <100 mmHg,
average SBP <100 mmHg in 1 year pre-index. The num-
ber of antihypertensives used was not significantly asso-
ciated with mortality (data not shown). Multiple logistic
regression analysis showed that age, gender, index BP
<100 mmHg and index diagnoses of stroke and HF were
significant variables associated with mortality (Table 2).

 Of the total 11,167 patients, 1,637 were admitted to hos-
pital once over the 1-year follow-up, 755 twice, 1,438 three
or more times. Variables were significantly associated
with age (1.03, 1.02–10.4), male gender (0.89, 0.82–0.97)
and average SBP <100 mmHg (1.68, 1.18–2.41) and index
diagnoses of coronary heart disease (1.51, 1.25–1.83),
stroke (1.54, 1.19–1.99) and HF (1.90, 1.35–2.66).
Over 1-year follow-up, 10.6% of patients had an episode
of AKI, 0.8% had two episodes and 0.3% had three epi-
sodes. Of the 128 patients with index SBP <100 mmHg, 30
patients (23%) had an episode of AKI in follow-up com-
pared to 11% in those with SBP ≥100 mmHg (χ2 20.9,
P < 0.05). Variables significantly associated with AKI
included age, gender, index SBP <100 mmHg, current
number of antihypertensive groups and index diagnoses of
diabetes, HT, stroke, CKD and HF. Of the 44 patients with
average BP <100 mmHg, 7 (16%) had AKI in follow-up.
Discussion
This study has demonstrated that a small but clinically sig-
nificant proportion of primary care population of patients
remains on antihypertensive drugs despite being hypoten-
sive (SBP <100 mmHg, <110 mmHg and <120 mmHg). It
was not within the scope of the study to ascertain the clin-
ical correlates of the low BP recordings of individual
patients. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that
hypotension
was
independently
associated
with
acute
admission, AKI and mortality. However, it is not possible
to say whether the hypotension was the result of a severe
illness, which was the primary cause of the admission, or
whether it was the hypotension itself, which caused the
admission. Some of the hypotensive patients also had a
diagnosis of HF and it is possible that hypotension in these
cases was as a direct result of this and antihypertensives
were continued in order to manage their underlying condi-
tion (e.g. ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers and diuretics).
The low BP in HF patients can be as a consequence of
appropriate treatment [12]. However, the results of the
multivariate analysis demonstrated that BP was an inde-
pendent predictor of poor outcome (mortality, AKI and
hospital admission). A further limitation of this study is that
it uses coded data for co-morbidities and these are likely to
underestimate the prevalence of co-morbidities, in addition
not all co-morbidity data were available (for example dis-
ability and dementia), which may have had an influence on
the result. This is demonstrated by the fact that only 12%
of the total population are coded as hypertensive, despite
considerably more being on antihypertensive medication. It
is therefore possible that excess mortality in the hypotensive
patient may be attributed to an un-coded (or under coded)
co-morbidity such as HF. One of the groups of antihyper-
tensives included in the study was diuretics, which may be
used for the treatment of HF rather than hypertension.
This group of agents included thiazide diuretics, loop diure-
tics and aldosterone antagonists, the latter two agents may
be indicated for the treatment of hypertension particularly
in the context of CKD but are more commonly used in the
treatment of oedema. Finally, the data set did not include
the entire prescription information, some medications
known to lower BP have not been included in the analysis
(e.g. drugs to treat prostatic hypertrophy and Parkinson’s
disease).
However despite these limitations the finding that a clin-
ically significant proportion of elderly people on antihyper-
tensive drugs is hypotensive is of importance. Clinical trials
have demonstrated that antihypertensive treatment prevents
cardiovascular disease in older people but recent research
has underscored the importance of assessing the risk bene-
fit ratio in individual patients especially those with co-
morbidities [1–3]. Common clinical sequelae of hypotension
in older people include falls, syncope and fear of falling
[3, 5, 7–9, 12]. The consequences of hypotension due to
drugs are potentially costly to the NHS and have a negative
effect on the quality of life of older patients [14–19].

Odds ratios describe the effect of all variables on outcome. For variable mea-
sured on a categorical scale, the odds ratios represent the odds of death in
each category relative to baseline category. For the continuous variables, the
odds represent the change in odds for one-unit increase in that variable. Three
models were examined, each considering the effect of BP on outcome.

 When medication is used primarily for the prevention of
future disease (for example in the case of antihypertensives
to prevent cardiac and cerebrovascular events) in frail eld-
erly patients, it is important to regularly review treatment in
order to balance the risk and benefits [3, 5]. A target clinic
BP <150/90 mmHg for treated hypertension in older peo-
ple aged 80 and over and 140/90 for younger patients is
specified in NICE guidance [20]. These targets are also
Quality and Outcomes Framework (pay for performance)
indicators. However consideration of how far BP is reduced
below the target in frail older people is also important.
A SBP of 110 mmHg or below in older people is associated
with an increased risk of falls, which potentially can be asso-
ciated with serious clinical consequences [3, 8] Regular face-
to-face medication review to monitor the effects of antihy-
pertensive treatment in older patients was also advised in
the NICE Hypertension guideline. In this regard checking
for postural hypotension and using ambulatory BP moni-
toring can be useful to detect the potential for hypotensive
side effects in older people.
The participants in the randomised clinical trials upon
which clinical guidelines are based (which demonstrated the
benefit of antihypertensives in reducing cardiovascular events)
suffered from fewer co-morbid conditions than an age-
matched clinical population [3]. Randomised controlled trials
involving a representative sample of older people are needed
to best distinguish, which older people are most likely to
derive more benefit than harm from treatment including
effects on function and mortality [3]. Moreover, it has been
suggested that in future clinical trials of long-term preventa-
tive treatments it would be useful to consider patient centred-
outcomes such quality of life along with hard outcomes such
as mortality and cardiovascular events [24].
However factors other than chronological age are
important when assessing the risks and benefits of antihy-
pertensive treatment in older people. There is recent evi-
dence that patients with cognitive impairment, frailty and
those in care homes require special consideration regarding
antihypertensive prescribing [25–27]. For example in older
patients with frailty (as indicated by slower walking speed)
higher BP was not associated with higher mortality, whereas
in patients with higher walking speeds high BP was asso-
ciated with increased mortality [24]. These are important
areas for further research.
The important role of the generalist physician to take a
holistic overview of patients on multiple medications has
been acknowledged [5, 6, 28]. Patients with co-morbidities
may be prescribed BP lowering medication to treat other
conditions, e.g. prostatism, Parkinson’s, depression or car-
diac conditions, and a regular holistic medication review is
advised. In the face of a multiplicity of single disease guide-
lines, an evolving evidence-based clinical decision-making
requires judgement and treatment has to consider patient
circumstances and preferences [5, 6, 28]. Additionally, there
is further scope for the development of clinical systems to
aid decision-making in the care of elderly patients with mul-
tiple medications and co-morbidities [5, 6, 29]. Validated
assessment tools have been shown to aid detection and pre-
vention of adverse drug events and iatrogenic illness in pri-
mary and secondary care [29]. The development of
integrated IT systems, which enable closer integration
between primary and secondary care, could help guide the
management of patients with co-morbidities [6].
In conclusion, this study suggests that some older
patients in primary care on antihypertensive drugs are hypo-
tensive. This could be of clinical importance in some older
patients particularly if they have co-morbidities.
Key points
• A significant proportion of the over 70 s remain on anti-
hypertensives despite hypotension.
• Hypotension in older people is associated with an
increased mortality.
• Hypotension in older people is associated with hospital
admission and acute kidney injury.
