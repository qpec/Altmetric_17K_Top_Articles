IMPORTANCE High-risk medical devices often undergo modifications, which are approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through various kinds of premarket approval
(PMA) supplements. There have been multiple high-profile recalls of devices approved as
PMA supplements.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the quality of the clinical studies and data (strength of evidence)
used to support FDA approval of panel-track supplements (a type of PMA supplement
pathway that is used for significant changes in a device or indication for use and always
requires clinical data).
DESIGN AND SETTING Descriptive study of clinical studies supporting panel-track
supplements approved by the FDA between April 19, 2006, and October 9, 2015.
EXPOSURE Panel-track supplement approval.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Methodological quality of studies including randomization,
blinding, type of controls, clinical vs surrogate primary end points, use of post hoc analyses,
and reporting of age and sex.
RESULTS Eighty-three clinical studies supported the approval of 78 panel-track supplements,
with 71 panel-track supplements (91%) supported by a single study. Of the 83 studies, 37
(45%) were randomized clinical trials and 25 (30%) were blinded. The median number of
patients per study was 185 (interquartile range, 75-305), and the median follow-up duration
was 180 days (interquartile range, 84-270 days). There were a total of 150 primary end points
(mean [SD], 1.8 [1.2] per study), and 57 primary end points (38%) were compared with
controls. Of primary end points with controls, 6 (11%) were retrospective controls and 51
(89%) were active controls. One hundred twenty-one primary end points (81%) were
surrogate end points. Thirty-three studies (40%) did not report age and 25 (30%) did not
report sex for all enrolled patients. The FDA required postapproval studies for 29 of 78 (37%)
panel-track supplements.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among clinical studies used to support FDA approval of
high-risk medical device modifications, fewer than half were randomized, blinded, or
controlled, and most primary outcomes were based on surrogate end points. These findings
suggest that the quality of studies and data evaluated to support approval by the FDA of
modifications of high-risk devices should be improved.

Methods
Included Devices
On October 9, 2015, the FDA’
s PMA database14 was searched
using the term “Supplement Type: Panel Track” and all panel-
track supplements approved between April 19, 2006, and
October 9, 2015, were identified. These data were used to per-
form a descriptive study of all devices either implanted or
tested in humans. Devices used for in vitro testing of labora-
tory samples were excluded.
Included Studies
Data were abstracted from clinical studies included in each de-
vice’
s Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data (hereafter re-
ferred to as Summary), which is “intended to present a rea-
soned, objective, and balanced critique of the scientific
evidence which served as the basis of the decision to approve
or deny the PMA.
”15 The FDA determines safety and effective-
ness of a medical device by considering, among other rel-
evant factors, “(1) The persons for whose use the device is rep-
resented or intended; (2) The conditions of use for the device,
including conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or sug-
gested in the labeling or advertising of the device, and other
intended conditions of use; (3) The probable benefit to health
from the use of the device weighed against any probable in-
jury or illness from such use; (4) The reliability of the device.
”16
Data Abstraction
The following data were recorded for each panel-track supple-
ment: device trade name, applicant name, device category
(forexample,ophthalmicorcardiovascular),reasonforsupple-
ment (labeling change or changes to device design, compo-
nents, or specifications), date received by the FDA, and FDA
decision date. Data were classified by one of us (S.Y.Z.) and re-
viewed by one or two of us (S.S.D. and R.F.R.) in cases of un-
certainty, which were resolved by consensus.
Data abstracted from the clinical studies evaluated for ap-
proval of the device were number of patients enrolled, mean
age (with standard deviation), sex, and race. Number of pa-
tients enrolled was considered stated in the studies only if the
Summary explicitly identified participants as “enrolled.” For
bothageandsexanalyses,anydiscrepanciesbetweenthenum-
ber of participants enrolled in the study and the number re-
ported for mean age and sex proportion were noted.
Strengthofevidenceandriskofbiasandconfoundingwere
determined based on study design and characterization of pri-
mary end point(s) (PEP[s]). For studies, the use of randomiza-
tion and the use of blinding were characterized. The number
and location of study sites were also characterized because
single-site studies generally have more limitations than mul-
tisite studies, including lack of external validity.17 The PEPs
were characterized by single component vs composite, type
of controls, follow-up duration, and type (clinical or surro-
gate, with surrogate defined as “a laboratory measurement or
a physical sign used as a substitute for a clinically meaningful
endpoint that measures directly how a patient feels, func-
tions or survives”18). Examples of surrogate outcomes in-
clude echocardiographic parameters such as Doppler veloc-
ity index for a heart valve, ischemia-driven target vessel
revascularization for a coronary stent (because asymptom-
atic patients may be labeled as ischemic based on stress test-
ing), and blinded evaluation of lip fullness for an injectable gel
(because this is not a patient’
s own evaluation of how he or
she feels). The type of analysis also was characterized (supe-
riority, equivalence, noninferiority, or objective performance
Key Points
Question What is the quality of clinical studies and data used to
approve modifications to high-risk devices by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) panel-track supplement pathway?
Findings In this descriptive study of 83 clinical studies for 78
panel-track supplements approved between 2006 and 2015, 45%
were randomized clinical trials and 30% were blinded. Of the 150
primary end points in these studies, 81% were surrogates and 38%
were compared with controls.
Meaning There are limitations in the quality of the studies and data
evaluated by the FDA to support modifications of high-risk devices.

superiority usually requires a higher evidentiary bar than the
othertypesofanalyses.AnFDAGuidanceDocumentstatesthat
a positive superiority trial is interpretable without further as-
sumptions, while a noninferiority trial is dependent on know-
ing that the active control had its expected effect; if the active
control did not have an effect, then showing noninferiority
“provides no evidence that the test drug is effective.”19
PEPs were identified only if the Summary specifically re-
ferredtoendpoints,objectives,outcomes,parameters,measures
ormeasurements,criteria,variables,orassessmentsas“primary.
”
Examples of PEPs include all-cause mortality at 12 months,
progression-freesurvival,andmean(logMAR[logarithmofthe
minimumangleofresolution]chart)distance-correctednearvi-
sual acuity under photopic conditions at 40 cm. When a study
did not explicitly refer to any end point as primary, up to 3 end
points were designated as PEPs. In such cases, the first 3 end
pointsmentionedintheSummaryweredesignatedasPEPs.Any
discrepanciesbetweenthenumberofpatientsenrolledandnum-
ber examined for PEP analyses were quantified.

tio of men versus women in the study reflective of the underly-
ing distribution of the disease for that given age group, ethnic
group, stage of disease, etc.? Was any selection bias on the ba-
sisofgenderidentifiedduringreview?Wasthereanydifference
in the safety and effectiveness of the device based on gender?
For example, was the device more/less effective in women?”20
Additionalrecordedinformationincludedwhetherapanel-

in-depth examination was warranted of a complex or contro-
versial issue. PASs provide important data about the safety and
effectiveness of devices in real-world clinical practice and can
provide larger sample sizes and longer duration of follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
Data were summarized across PMA supplements, studies, and
PEPs. These summary data are presented as number (PMAs,
studies, or PEPs) and as a percentage of the category to which
they belong. Mean (standard deviation) and median (inter-
quartile range [IQR]) were calculated and reported as appro-
priate. The statistical software used was Microsoft Excel ver-
sion 14.0.0 (Microsoft Corp).
Results
Eighty-four panel-track supplements were approved between
April 19, 2006, and October 9, 2015 (Figure and eTable in the
Supplement). Six supplements not involving human studies
were excluded because they involved in vitro devices used to
testlaboratorysamples.Forty-oneofthe78supplements(53%)
were categorized as cardiovascular, 15 (19%) as ophthalmic,
9 (12%) as general and plastic surgery, 6 (8%) as clinical chem-
istry, 7 (9%) as others (orthopedic, neurology, anesthesiology,
radiology,gastroenterology/urology).Sixty-two(79%)weresub-
mitted for a labeling change, such as modification of a device’
s
indications; 14 (18%) were submitted to support changes to de-
vice design, components, or specifications; and 2 (3%) did not

 the number of participants enrolled and the number in-
cluded in the analysis were reported for 97 PEPs (65%). For 64
of these 97 PEPs (66%), more patients were enrolled than in-
cluded in the analysis. A median of 11% (IQR, 4%-40%) of en-
rolled participants were excluded from their PEP analysis, in-
dicating incomplete follow-up. For one device, 91% of enrolled
patients were not included in PEP analysis.21 Follow-up dura-
tion at PEP analysis was stated for 143 PEPs (95%), with a me-
dian follow-up of 180 days (IQR, 84-270 days).
Discussion
In this descriptive study of panel-track supplements for high-
risk devices approved during the past decade, the majority re-
lied on a single nonrandomized, unblinded study that lacked
controls. Panel-track supplements are the most rigorous
supplement type and the only type that always requires clini-
caldatafordevicemodifications.Althoughrandomizationand
blinding are widely accepted as prerequisites for high-quality
clinical studies,22 they were used infrequently in studies
tosupportdevicemodifications.Thismeanslower-qualitydata
often supported changes in high-risk devices that are modifi-
cations to previously approved devices. For example, the
LAP-BAND’
s indications were expanded through a panel-
track PMA supplement relying on a single-group study
(N = 160)withoutactivecontrols(eachstudyparticipantserved
as his or her own control) with a PEP measured at 1 year23; this
expandedindicationmadeanestimated19millionmoreAmeri-
cans able to have the gastric band placed.24 However, recent
data indicate important concerns about the safety and effec-
tiveness of the LAP-BAND; 18.5% of Medicare beneficiaries
who have received this device have undergone reoperation by
4.5 years, with an average of 3.8 procedures per patient.24
Studies without randomization are prone to various types of
bias, making it difficult to ascertain whether these modified
devices are safer or more effective than previous iterations,
conventional treatments, or no procedure.5,25
Furthermore,moststudiesusedsurrogateendpoints,such
as percent diameter stenosis determined by quantitative coro-
nary angiography for a coronary stent or percentage of glu-
cosevaluesbeingwithin20%ofareferenceforaglucosemoni-
toringsystem.Thecodingofanoutcomeassurrogateorclinical
is not always straightforward, and while we sought to be con-
sistent with the cited definition, we recognize that some may
view a few of the outcomes differently. Surrogate end points
allow for clinical trials of smaller sample size and shorter du-
ration, so trials are less costly. For surrogate end points to be
useful to patients and clinicians, they must be shown to pre-
dict meaningful clinical outcomes, which rarely happens.18,26
Therefore, use of surrogate measures can lead to uncertainty
about clinical outcomes. In addition, 30% of PEPs were com-
posites, which are often weighted disproportionately by 1 com-
ponent,usuallytheweakestormostsubjective.27Clinicallyim-
portant events such as death contribute less to the composite
end point than more commonly occurring but less clinically
significant events. One example of a study that used a com-
posite end point was for approval of a drug-eluting coronary
stent. The PEP was target-lesion failure at 12 months follow-
ing the procedure, defined as cardiac death, target-vessel myo-
cardialinfarction(Qwaveandnon–Qwave),orclinicallydriven
target-lesion revascularization by percutaneous or surgical
methods.28 A more clinically significant outcome would have
been just death and myocardial infarction.
Sixty-four of 97 PEP analyses (66%) did not include all pa-
tients enrolled in the study. Such incomplete reporting may
bias study results because patients with less favorable out-
comes may be preferentially lost. Additionally, the common
use of post hoc or not-prespecified analyses (24% of studies)
mayintroducebias.Thereasonsforstudymodificationsshould
be transparent, which was often not the case. Another find-
ing was that 33 studies (40%) did not report age and 25 (30%)
did not report sex for all enrolled patients; these are usually
essentialdatathataffecttherisk-benefitprofilefordevicesand
help ascertain the representativeness of study participants to
the intended target population for the medical device and gen-
eralizability of study findings.
For one panel-track supplement radiology device, Selenia
Dimensions3DSystem,91%oftheenrolledpatientswerenotin-
cluded in the primary analysis. This device was used to gener-
ate digital mammographic images for screening and diagnosis
of breast cancer. The study excluded the majority of enrolled
participants for various reasons such as training purposes, par-
ticipantsnotmeetinginclusioncriteriaormeetingexclusioncri-
teria, equipment failure, participants’withdrawal of consent,
imagingobtainedusingincorrecttechnique,andqualitycontrol
issues. According to the Summary, following an FDA advisory
panel meeting, the FDA asked the manufacturer to provide ad-
ditionaldatatoaddressconcernsregardingexcludedparticipants.

supplements are rarely used. For example, only 1 of 528 PMA
supplements (0.2%) for high-risk otolaryngologic devices was
approvedasapanel-tracksupplement,and15ofmorethan5800
supplements (0.3%) approved for cardiac implantable devices
used the panel-track supplement pathway.7,10
The recalls of multiple devices approved through PMA
supplements without clinical data—including implantable car-
dioverter-defibrillator leads, knee implants, and cochlear
implants, among others—demonstrate that device modifica-
tions without clinical data could contribute to patients receiv-
ing devices for which safety has not been established.30,31
For example, a glucose-monitoring system, the Dexcom G4
PLATINUM (Pediatric) Receiver, was approved as a panel-
track supplement in May 2015 based on a study with 7 days’
follow-up. In February 2016, a Class I recall was initiated for
more than 19 500 of these devices because patients may not
receive an intended audible alert or alarm for hypoglycemia
or hyperglycemia.32 A Class I recall is defined by the FDA as
“a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the
use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious ad-
verse health consequences or death.”33
Additionally, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
leads of the Medtronic Sprint Fidelis were recalled in 2007 and
St Jude Riata and Riata ST in 2011. These recalled leads had un-
dergone multiple modifications (the Medtronic Sprint Fidelis
was approved as a 180-day supplement and the St Jude Riata
as a real-time supplement); none of the changes were sup-
ported by clinical data.7 These devices were implanted in hun-
dreds of thousands of patients worldwide and were associ-
ated with at least 22 reports of deaths in the case of Riata and
Riata ST and at least a dozen deaths and more than 2200 re-
ports of serious injuries related to Sprint Fidelis.34,35 Addition-
ally, in 2015, there were recalls because of high revision rates
of the New Jersey LCS Total Knee System, which received mul-
tiple supplemental approvals including 2 panel-track
supplements.9 These recalls raise concern that safety signals
were missed due to lack of adequate or any premarket clini-
cal studies.
TheRiegelvMedtronic,IncSupremeCourtrulingestablished
that PMA approval, including supplements, preempts patient
lawsuitsrelatedtodevicesafetyandeffectiveness.36Thismeans
thatpatientslacklegalrecourseifaPMAdeviceisfaultyandad-
verselyaffectshealthoutcomes.Thus,itisvitaltoensuresafety
and effectiveness by requiring high-quality clinical data before
high-riskdevicesreachthemarket.Thefindingsthatfewsupple-
mentarychangesrequireclinicaldataandthatwhentheydothe
data are often low quality raise uncertainty about performance
of many commonly used devices.
Given the extensive modification of many PMA supple-
ment devices and the median preapproval follow-up of 6
months, obtaining additional data via PASs is critical. How-
ever, the FDA required PASs for the minority (37%) of panel-
track supplements. Currently, PASs are often small, nonran-
domized,unblindedstudieswithoutcontrols3,37—similartothe
quality of preapproval studies for PMA panel-track supple-
ments.Only13%ofinitiatedPASsarecompletedbetween3and
5 years after FDA approval,3 and the FDA has never issued a
warning letter, penalty, or fine against the manufacturer for
noncompliance.37 Active postmarket surveillance in a Na-
tional Evaluation System for Health Technology, including
adoption of the FDA’
s unique device identification system and
mandatorydeviceregistries,willfacilitatepostmarketdatacol-
lection when the system is implemented.38-41 To further help
physicians and patients make an informed decision about
which type of device to use, each device label should include
easily accessible information on all relevant supplements.
This study has several limitations. First, the FDA Summa-
ries may have missing data that are included in the proprietary
applications to the FDA. However, the Summaries contain data
justifying the FDA’
s rationale for approval.15 Standardized re-
portingrequirementsofclinicalstudydatabymanufacturersand
standardized FDA reviewer templates could ensure that stud-
ies for the highest-risk devices meet sufficiently rigorous stan-
dards.Second,datacollectionwasdonebyasinglecoder.How-
ever,allcasesofuncertaintywerereviewedbyatleast1additional
author. Third, because the focus of this study was premarket
clinical data, the analyses did not include preclinical data sup-
porting panel-track supplements or postmarket studies initi-
ated without FDA requirements. Both could help inform pa-
tients and clinicians about device performance.
Conclusions
Among clinical studies used to support FDA approval of high-
risk medical device modifications, fewer than half were ran-
domized, blinded, or controlled, and most primary outcomes
were based on surrogate end points. These findings suggest
that the quality of the studies and data evaluated to support
approval by the FDA of modifications of high-risk devices
should be improved.
