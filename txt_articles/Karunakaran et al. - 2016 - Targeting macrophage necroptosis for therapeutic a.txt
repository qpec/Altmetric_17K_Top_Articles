Atherosclerosis results from maladaptive inflammation driven primarily by macrophages, whose recruitment and
proliferationdrive plaque progression.In advanced plaques, macrophage death contributes centrally to the formation
of plaque necrosis, which underlies the instability that promotes plaque rupture and myocardial infarction. Hence,
targeting macrophage cell death pathways may offer promise for the stabilization of vulnerable plaques. Necroptosis
is a recently discovered pathway of programmed cell necrosis regulated by RIP3 and MLKL kinases that, in contrast to
apoptosis, induces a proinflammatory state. We show herein that necroptotic cell death is activated in human
advanced atherosclerotic plaques and can be targeted in experimental atherosclerosis for both therapeutic and
diagnostic interventions. In humans with unstable carotid atherosclerosis, expression of RIP3 and MLKL is
increased, and MLKL phosphorylation, a key step in the commitment to necroptosis, is detected in advanced
atheromas. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying necroptosis showed that atherogenic forms
of low-density lipoprotein increase RIP3 and MLKL transcription and phosphorylation—two critical steps in the
execution of necroptosis. Using a radiotracer developed with the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), we
show that 123I-Nec-1 localizes specifically to atherosclerotic plaques in Apoe−/− mice, and its uptake is tightly
correlated to lesion areas by ex vivo nuclear imaging. Furthermore, treatment of Apoe−/− mice with established
atherosclerosis with Nec-1 reduced lesion size and markers of plaque instability, including necrotic core formation.
Collectively, our findings offer molecular insight into the mechanisms of macrophage cell death that drive necrotic
core formation in atherosclerosis and suggest that this pathway can be used as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool
for the treatment of unstable atherosclerosis.
INTRODUCTION
Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipid-rich pla-
ques in medium to large arteries, which are replete with macrophages,
T lymphocytes, lipids, and cholesterol crystals. Atherosclerosis is
considered a benign disease until plaques weaken and rupture, leading
to acute thrombus and subsequent myocardial infarction or stroke (1).
A hallmark of such vulnerable lesions is the presence of a large necrotic
core covered by a thin fibrous cap, which renders the plaque susceptible
to rupture (2). Although the processes that underlie the initiation of in-
flammatory fatty lesions within the arterial wall are well understood, the
mechanisms by which these benign lesions develop into rupture-prone
culpritlesionsarenot. Thereis,thus,an urgentneedto betterunderstand
the pathways that contribute to necrotic core formation and to develop
strategies to target these processes therapeutically.
Atherosclerosis is initiated by the accumulation of excess low-density
lipoprotein(LDL)cholesterolthatbecomestrappedinthesubendothelial
space, where it is modified in the oxidant-rich environment. According to
the oxidation hypothesis, oxidized LDL (oxLDL) activates innate immune
cells, particularly macrophages, to engulf the modified-self LDL via
constitutivelyexpressedscavengerreceptorsontheircellsurface,triggering
the activation of pattern recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like recep-
tors and the inflammasome (3–6). OxLDL can be cytotoxic and induce
apoptosis of macrophages and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which in
early plaques are effectively cleared by macrophages via efferocytosis
(7). However, as macrophages accumulate lipids and undergo endo-
plasmic reticulum stress, efferocytosis has been shown to become defective,
resulting in secondary necrosis and the uncontrolled release of inflam-
matory mediators, proteases, and coagulation factors—all factors that
promote plaque vulnerability (8). Thus, macrophage cell death has been
considered to be a major contributor to atherosclerosis and necrotic
core formation in plaques.
The recent discovery and characterization of a pathway of pro-
grammed necrosis, or “necroptosis” (9), have expanded our understand-
ing of the mechanisms leading to cell death. It is now understood that
apoptosis and necroptosis have evolved as counterbalances in the first
line of defense against inflammatory stimuli, either exogenous or self-
derived. When proapoptotic caspase-8 is inhibited or overwhelmed, ei-
ther through synthetic or naturally occurring inhibitors, the kinases
RIP1 and RIP3 become phosphorylated, leading to recruitment and ac-
tivation of MLKL by RIP3 and loss of plasma membrane integrity re-
sulting in the release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
into the extracellular space (10–12). The upstream stimuli of necropto-
sis are beginning to be defined, and it is clear that both self- and non–
self-ligands can contribute (13). Necroptosis and apoptosis share many
overlapping factors; however, the small molecule necrostatin-1 (Nec-1)

 uniquely inhibits the interaction of RIP1-RIP3 and subsequent down-
stream effectors of necroptosis (14); thus, Nec-1 can be considered a
preferential inhibitor of necroptosis rather than apoptosis. Although
the necrostatin class of small molecules has enabled the evaluation of
RIP1-RIP3 in many pathologies and next-generation necrostatins have
increased specificity for RIP1, the use of Nec-1 in long-term models of
disease has not been explored (15). Furthermore, the recent develop-
ment of Rip3 knockout mice has revealed a specific role for Rip3 in
the development of a number of diseases (16), including atherosclerosis
(17); however, the mechanistic insight into how necroptosis is driven in
the plaque and whether this is relevant to human disease is still lacking.
Here, we set out to test whether necroptosis is activated in advanced
atherosclerosis in humans and whether it could be targeted for diag-
nostic and therapeutic intervention in a model of established athero-
sclerosis. We find that the necroptotic pathway is triggered in human
atherosclerotic plaques and is associated with markers of lesion vulner-
ability. Atherogenic ligands drive the expression of necroptotic genes,
and this can be targeted as a therapeutic and diagnostic tool for ad-
vanced atherosclerosis in vivo. Together, our findings suggest that ne-
croptosis underlies plaque vulnerability in humans and that dually
targeting necroptosis for therapeutic and diagnostic interventions
may benefit patients at highriskforvulnerable plaquesanddownstream
adverse clinical events.
RESULTS
Necroptotic pathway is activated in unstable atherosclerosis
in humans
Although necroptosis has been shown to promote lesion progression in
an experimental mouse model of atherosclerosis (17), to date there has
not been compelling evidence that necroptosis is active in human pla-
ques. Necrotic cells are frequently found within advanced human
atheromas (18), and the presence of a necrotic core is a major predictor
of rupture-prone lesions; therefore, we hypothesized that the necropto-
tic pathway is activated in advanced atherosclerosis in humans. We ini-
tially evaluated the gene expression of RIP3 and MLKL in carotid
plaques from a large biobank of patients with atherosclerosis and in
disease-free control arteries (19, 20). Gene expression analysis showed a
significant increase in expression of both RIP3 and MLKL mRNA in
atherosclerotic plaques compared to normal arteries (P ≤ 0.0001;
Fig. 1A). Because we hypothesized that necroptosis underlies lesion
vulnerability, we examined whether expression of necroptotic genes
may be further increased in unstable versus stable atherosclerotic pla-
ques. Gene expression analysis of plaques from individuals with symp-
tomatic carotid disease (that is, transient ischemic attack, minor stroke,
and/or amaurosis fugax) revealed a significant elevation of both RIP3
and MLKL gene expression compared to plaques from asymptomatic
individuals (P ≤ 0.05 and P ≤ 0.01, respectively; Fig. 1B). Traditional
measures of cell death [for example, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleoti-
dyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling)
positivity] cannot distinguish between necroptotic and apoptotic cell
death; however, the phosphorylation of MLKL—the last step in the ex-
ecution of necroptosis—is considered to be the most definitive bio-
marker of necroptosis activity in vivo (21). To test whether necroptosis
was indeed activated in vascular lesions in humans, we evaluated whether
phosphorylated MLKL (pMLKL) could be detected in human coronary
plaques with different stages of atherosclerotic lesions. Immuno-
histochemical analysis using an antibody that recognizes pMLKL
showed that regions with advanced fibroatheroma lesions showed pos-
itive pMLKL staining in close proximity to the necrotic core, whereas
within the same subject, early lesions (defined as pathologic intimal
thickening) showed no positive pMLKL staining (Fig. 1C). Quantifica-
tion of the pMLKL-positive area reveals that in subjects with advanced
fibroatheromas, there is a significant elevation of pMLKL compared to
subjects with intimal thickening (Fig. 1D). This is the first evidence that
the necroptotic pathway is associated with human vascular disease and
the first report that pMLKL is found within advanced atherosclerotic
plaques, supporting the idea that this pathway could be contributing
to lesion vulnerability.
OxLDL induces necroptosis in macrophages via RIP3
To further understand the mechanisms by which necroptosis is acti-
vated in plaques, we evaluated how atherogenic ligands trigger necrop-
tosis by endogenous mechanisms in vitro. OxLDL is known to induce
apoptosis; however, little is known whether oxLDL or other atherogenic
ligands found within the plaque can endogenously promote necroptosis
in the absence of nonphysiological apoptosis inhibitors (that is, zVAD.
fmk) (17, 22, 23). Therefore, we tested the degree of necroptotic cell
death in macrophages in vitro in bone marrow–derived macrophages
(BMDMs) treated with oxLDL for 24 hours. Compared to unstimulated
cells, oxLDL treatment resulted in a ~4-fold induction of cell death in
macrophages, and this was significantly inhibited by cotreatment with
the necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 (3.9 ± 0.6–fold versus 2.3 ± 0.4–fold,
respectively; P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 2A and fig. S1A). Inhibition of apoptotic cell
death with the pan–caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk significantly enhanced
cell death in response to oxLDL, similar to what had been reported pre-
viously (5.7 ± 0.7–fold; P ≤ 0.001), whereas Nec-1 treatment alone did
not promote cell death (Fig. 2A and fig. S1B). To test whether the in-
duction of cell death is dependent on RIP3 function, we measured the
induction of cell death by oxLDL in both wild-type macrophages and
macrophages deficient in RIP3 (Rip3−/−), and observed that Rip3−/−
macrophages are resistant to cell death in response to both oxLDL
and oxLDL + zVAD.fmk (Fig. 2B). Because phospho-RIP3 and
phospho-MLKL are required for the execution of necroptosis, we sub-
sequently measured the degree of phosphorylation of RIP3 and MLKL
in response to oxLDL, and we observed that oxLDL significantly in-
duced both RIP3 and MLKL phosphorylation in macrophages, which
was dampened by Nec-1 (Fig. 2, C and D). At the ultrastructural level,
cells undergoing necroptosis have damaged plasma membrane integrity
and translucent electron-light cytoplasm (24). Ultrastructural analysis
of macrophages treated with oxLDL and oxLDL + zVAD.fmk using
electron microscopy shows the typical electron-light zones within the
cytoplasm that are not found in control-treated cells (Fig. 2E and fig. S1C).
Because SMCs form the fibrous cap and play an important role in the
rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, we were curious as to whether SMCs
also undergo necroptosis in response to oxLDL but found that neither
oxLDL nor oxLDL + zVAD.fmk significantly induced cell death in
SMCs (fig. S2A). Together, these data demonstrate that oxLDL, a potent
endogenous atherogenic ligand, can independently induce macro-
phages to undergo necroptosis in the absence of caspase inhibitors, sug-
gesting that this pathway may be activated under physiologic conditions
in the vessel wall.
Within the atherosclerotic milieu, various stimuli are present, in ad-
dition to oxLDL, that can promote the inflammatory response and
propagate lesion formation. These include cytokines, chemokines,

 reactive oxygen species (ROS), cholesterol crystals, and other modified
self-ligands, and together are termed DAMPs. DAMPs are released
from cells during the processof necroptosis, where uncontrolled leakage
of intracellular components occurs after membrane integrity is lost (12).
If these dying cells are not cleared away by efferocytosis, they can persist
and allow for further DAMP release (25). We therefore hypothesized
that efferocytosis of necroptotic cells is impaired, which promotes
DAMP release that exacerbates oxLDL-induced cell death. To test this,
we treated BMDMs with staurosporine to induce apoptosis, or oxLDL +
zVAD.fmk or LPS (lipopolysaccharide) + zVAD.fmk to induce necrop-
tosis. Dead cells were collected and applied in equal number to naïve
macrophages to allow for efferocytosis, after which unbound cells were
washed extensively before uptake was quantified. As expected, cells trea-
ted with staurosporine (that is, apoptotic cells) were taken up by the
naïve macrophages (Fig. 2F). In contrast, cells treated with either
oxLDL + zVAD.fmk or LPS + zVAD.fmk (that is, necroptotic cells)
were not engulfed by the naïve macrophages to the same extent, thus
confirming that necroptotic cells are less efficiently efferocytosed than
cells undergoing apoptosis. To test whether DAMP release might po-
tentiate necroptotic cell death induced by oxLDL, DAMPs generated by

 either mechanical (that is, freeze-thaw) or pharmacological (that is, LPS +
zVAD.fmk) methods were coincubated together with oxLDL that sig-
nificantly induced cell death in macrophages, which could be inhibited
by Nec-1 (Fig. 2G and fig. S2B; P < 0.05). Similar to what is observed
with oxLDL alone, cell death in response to DAMPs is dependent on
RIP3, becauseRip3−/−macrophagesare resistant to celldeathby oxLDL+
DAMPs (Fig. 2H). Activation of RIP3 by phosphorylation is increased
when macrophages are coincubated with oxLDL and DAMPs and can
be inhibited by Nec-1 (Fig. 2I). These data indicate that in addition to
oxLDL, DAMPs released from dying cells exacerbate necroptotic cell
death and are dependent on RIP3 activation, suggesting that the mul-
tiple inflammatory ligands present in the atherosclerotic plaque may act
concomitantly to promote necroptosis.
oxLDL is an inducer of the NLRP3 inflammasome and can induce
the expression and secretion of interleukin-1b (IL-1b) (3, 4). We there-
fore asked whether the inflammasome was required for the induction of
necroptosis by oxLDL. Macrophages from either wild-type mice or
mice deficient in caspase-1 (Casp1−/−) had equivalent levels of cell death
upon treatment with oxLDL (Fig. 2J). Similarly, cotreatment of macro-
phages with the caspase-1 inhibitor zYVAD.fmk did not reduce or pre-
vent cell death in response to oxLDL (fig. S2C). These data indicate that
necroptotic cell death in response to oxLDL does not depend on the
induction of caspase-1, unlike what is observed for IL-1b secretion.
OxLDL induces expression of necroptotic genes RIP3
and MLKL
OxLDL is an inflammatory ligand that induces the activation of proin-
flammatory signaling events, eliciting cytokine and chemokine produc-
tion (26). Because oxLDL induces necroptosis independently of caspase
inhibition, we next sought to determine the mechanisms underlying the
induction of necroptosis by oxLDL. We measured the expression of
genes involved in the necroptotic pathway in macrophages and found
that the treatment with oxLDL induced the expression of RIP3 and
MLKL at both the mRNA (Fig. 3, A and B) and protein levels (Fig. 3,
Cand D). OxLDL can induce the production of ROS(26). Therefore, we
tested whether ROS production was critical for the induction of RIP3
and MLKL expression. We confirmed that treatment of macrophages
with oxLDL induced the production of ROS, which was inhibited by the
ROS scavenger diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) (Fig. 3E and fig. S3A). Pre-
treatment of macrophages with DPI inhibited the induction of both
RIP3 and MLKL mRNA expression by oxLDL and oxLDL + zVAD.
fmk (Fig. 3F). To assess whether this increase in gene expression was
due to direct activation of the promoter by oxLDL, we used a synthetic
construct with the promoter region of either RIP3 or MLKL upstream
of a luciferase reporter. In RAW macrophages transfected with the
promoter constructs, oxLDL treatment significantly induced the activa-
tion of the RIP3 reporter after 6 and 24 hours and the MLKL reporter
after 24 hours (Fig. 3, G and H). Inhibition of ROS by treatment with
DPI significantly blunted the promoter activity of RIP3 and MLKL, in-
dicative of a ROS-dependent activation of the promoter regions of RIP3
and MLKL by oxLDL (Fig. 3, G and H). In addition to MLKL, PGAM5
can play a role in necroptosis by inducing mitochondrial damage (27).
We also found that PGAM5 was induced at the mRNA and protein
levels by oxLDL, and its expression was similarly inhibited by DPI
(fig. S3, B and C). These results indicate that oxLDL directly induces
the expression of RIP3 andMLKL at the mRNA and protein levels, likely
as a result of activation of the promoter regions of these genes by oxLDL
signaling through ROS. Collectively, these data provide mechanistic
insight into the observation in humans that necroptosis could be acti-
vated because of direct activation of the necroptotic program by athero-
genic ligands in the plaque.
Atherosclerosis can be visualized using a Nec-1 radiotracer
Given the evidence that the necroptotic pathway is activated in human
plaques and its expression is driven by atherogenic stimuli, we next test
whether the necroptotic pathway could be targeted using molecular im-
aging to visualize its occurrence in atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. We
developed an 123I-labeled Nec-1 compound and tested its localization to
aortic lesions in Apoe−/− mice. Radiolabeled Nec-1 (123I-Nec-1) was
injected into Apoe−/− mice with established lesions, and 2 hours later,
aortas were harvested and analyzed for radiotracer uptake. Auto-
radiography imaging revealed that 123I-Nec-1 was primarily localized
to areas of plaque accumulation in the en face aortic arch (Fig. 4A). Pre-
administration of a cold nonradioactive Nec-1 compound significantly
blocked aortic lesional uptake of 123I-Nec-1 (Fig. 4B), indicating that
radiolabeled Nec-1 uptake is specific. When compared to Oil Red O
(ORO) uptake within the aorta, which stains lipid-rich lesion areas,
there was a significant correlation between the lesion area measured
by 123I-Nec-1 and ORO (Fig. 4C), suggesting that this was localized
to macrophage foam cells in plaques. These data demonstrate that ne-
croptosis within atherosclerotic lesions can be targeted using a molec-
ular imaging probe based on the small-molecule inhibitor Nec-1 to
visualize atherosclerotic lesion areas.
Blocking necroptosis in established lesions reduces plaque
size and markers of vulnerability
Active necroptosis was detected in advanced rupture-prone lesions in
human subjects. Therefore, we next set out to test whether intervention
using a small-molecule inhibitor of necroptosis could be used as a ther-
apeutic strategy in mice with established atherosclerotic lesions (17).
Necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s) was formulated into a time-release pellet and
delivered to Apoe−/− mice, whichhad been feda Western diet for 4weeks
to induce lesion development (Fig. 5A). After 6 weeks of treatment
with either Nec-1 or placebo with Western diet feeding, quantification
of en face lesion area in the ascending and descending aorta revealed
that Nec-1 treatment significantly reduced lesion burden by 68% com-
pared to placebo-treated mice (9.9 ± 0.9% for placebo versus 3.1 ±
0.3% for Nec-1; P ≤ 0.0001; Fig. 5B). In the aortic root, lesion area
was reduced by 27% compared to controls (0.50 ± 0.03 mm2 for placebo
versus 0.37 ± 0.05 mm2 for Nec-1; P ≤ 0.05; Fig. 5C). Total plasma cho-
lesterolandbody weight were not affectedby Nec-1treatment (Table 1).
These data demonstrate that intervention with an inhibitor of necrop-
tosis can block the further progression of established lesions in mice
with inflammatory atherosclerosis.
We next evaluated whether intervention with Nec-1 altered markers
of lesion instability, namely, necrotic core area and SMC fibrous cap
content.EvaluationoflesioncharacteristicsdemonstratedthatNec-1re-
duced lesion necrotic core area by 62% compared to placebo (P ≤ 0.01;
Fig. 5D) and increased smooth muscle actin area by 70% (P ≤ 0.05;
Fig. 5E). Quantification of macrophage content within the lesions dem-
onstrated that there was a slight but nonsignificant increase in CD68+
macrophage area with Nec-1 treatment, likely reflecting to the overall
reduction in lesion size in the Nec-1–treated animals (34.4 ± 3.2% ver-
sus 43.5 ± 3.7% of lesion area, P = ns; Fig. 5F). We next assessed whether
necroptotic cell death was reduced in lesions from Nec-1–treated mice.

positive area by 63% compared to placebo controls (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 5G).
Because RIP3 can also play a role in inflammasome activation and ath-

ers of plaque instability (that is, necrotic core and necroptotic cell
death), suggesting that necroptosis underlies both the development

DISCUSSION
Here, we show that necroptosis, an emerging pathway underlying in-
flammatory cell death in many pathologies, is active within the necrotic
core in humans with advanced atherosclerosis and can be targeted for
therapeutic and diagnostic interventions in mice. This study is the first
to demonstrate that the necroptotic pathway is increased in vascular
disease in humans, where MLKL is phosphorylated in advanced necrot-
ic lesions. We report that necroptosis can be targeted with long-term
therapeutic inhibition in a mouse model of established atherosclerosis
to reduce lesion size and, importantly, markers of plaque vulnerability.
Moreover, using ex vivo molecular imaging, we show that necroptosis
can be used as a diagnostic tool to visualize this process in athero-
sclerotic lesions. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the sterile lig-
and oxLDL, an inflammatory form of LDL that is abundant within
developing atheroma, is sufficient to induce necroptotic cell death in
macrophages via direct activation of the RIP3 and MLKL promoter.
Although oxLDL is known to induce apoptosis (22, 23), this is the first
report that oxLDL can directly induce necroptotic cell death in the
absence of synthetic caspase inhibition. Overall, our study offers
compelling evidence that necroptosis contributes to atherosclerosis
lesion vulnerability in humans and offers the first mechanistic insight
into how atherogenic ligands are driving this form of inflammatory
cell death.
Mechanisms that govern necrotic core formation in vulnerable ath-
erosclerotic lesions are poorly understood. Throughout virtually all
stages of atherosclerosis, cell death is active and contributes to plaque
progression, from early foam lesion formation to the advancement of
unstable rupture-prone plaques (23). In the early stages of lesion initi-
ation, apoptosis induced by oxidized lipids in the subendothelial space
may serve as a protective mechanism by promoting rapid clearance of
apoptotic cells by phagocytes via efferocytosis. In later stages, it is be-
lieved that efferocytosis is impaired and apoptotic cell debris accumu-
lates and contributes to lesion destabilization (8). However, in advanced
human atherosclerotic lesions, cells with necrotic morphology are more
abundant than with apoptotic morphology, suggesting that other forms
of cell death besides apoptosis endure in the advanced plaque and pro-
mote lesion destabilization (18). Our data suggest that so long as oxLDL
persists within the plaque, macrophages undergo necroptotic cell death,
releasing DAMPs into the extracellular space to serve as a feed-forward
loop to exacerbating the extensive necrotic core found in advanced le-
sions (10). The atheroma milieu is rich in other sources of DAMPs, such
as other oxidized lipids (28), inflammatory cytokines, heat shock pro-
teins, and mitochondrialDNA (29), and our data agree with the concept
that the accumulation of DAMPs induced by atherogenic ligands fur-
ther exacerbates necroptotic cell death. Our data demonstrating that ne-
croptotic macrophages do not efficiently undergo efferocytosis further
suggest that defective efferocytosis in the plaque may in part be driven
by activation of the necroptotic pathway, potentiating the accumulation
of inflammatory and necrotic debris and expansion of the necrotic core.
Apoptotic celldeathis triggered when caspase-8 is active,resulting in
the cleavage of RIP1 and RIP3 and inactivation of the necroptotic
program (12, 30–32). The expression of RIP3 is tightly correlated with
the degree of necroptosis (33), and induction of RIP3 expression is suf-
ficient to overcome caspase-8 and trigger necroptotic cell death (34, 35).
We show that oxLDL induces the expression of necroptotic genes RIP3
and MLKL and, importantly, promotes the up-regulation and phospho-
rylation of RIP3 protein—a requirement for the assembly of the RIP1-
RIP3 complex and subsequent necroptosis (36). In addition, these data
are the first to show that atherogenic ligands can induce the phospho-
rylation of MLKL, and this is active within the atherosclerotic plaque.
Our data offer mechanistic insight into why Rip3−/− mice are protected
from the development of atherosclerosis, suggesting that endogenous
ligandspresent within the atherosclerotic plaque are directly responsible
for the up-regulation of RIP3, which is sufficient to drive necroptosis
and lesion progression. This is the first evidence that oxLDL triggers
necroptosis independently from caspase-8 inhibition by direct tran-
scriptional up-regulation of necroptotic cell genes RIP3 and MLKL.
OxLDL is known to induce many downstream signaling events (26),
including the generation of ROS, which can subsequently activate
transcriptionfactorstoinduceredox-sensitivegeneexpression(37).Sim-
ilar to NLRP3, whose mRNA induction by oxLDL is considered a
necessary priming step for inflammasome activation and is dependent
on ROS (4, 38), we show that oxLDL induces mRNA and protein ex-
pression of RIP3 and MLKL and is sufficient to activate necroptosis,
which is blocked upon scavenging cellular ROS. We find that the induc-
tionofnecroptosisbyoxLDLisindependentofinflammasomeactivation,
because cells deficient in caspase-1 or treated with caspase-1 inhibitors
undergo necroptotic cell death in response to oxLDL to the same de-
gree as wild-type or untreated cells. This evidence could explain why
gene expression of RIP3 and MLKL is positively associated with unstable
atherosclerotic lesions compared to both stable lesions and healthy ar-
teries. An improved understanding of how atherogenic ligands induce
the expression of RIP3 and MLKL could assist in the rationale design
of future therapeutics that block this mechanism to reduce athero-
sclerosis lesion vulnerability.
Our data establish the potential for the therapeutic treatment of
established atherosclerosis with inhibitors of the necroptotic pathway.
Within the atherosclerotic plaque, RIP3 contributes to inflammasome
activation, which could be inhibited by blocking RIP1-RIP3 activation
withNec-1.However,wedidnotobservedifferencesinserumIL-1b levels
in mice treated with Nec-1, suggesting that at doses used in the current
study,Nec-1treatment didnotimpairinflammasomeactivationandthus
likely did not contribute to the reduction in lesion size observed in the
Nec-1–treated group. It has been suggested that some of the activities of
Nec-1renderthe RIP1-dependent apoptotic pathway inactive (39);thus,it
is possible that in vivo, Nec-1 is serving to inhibit both apoptotic and
necroptotic cell death, where both pathways may ultimately contrib-
ute to lesion instability at later stages of atherosclerosis. Nevertheless,
we observed a reduction in pMLKL in Nec-1–treated mice, specifically

 indicating that necroptotic death is reduced in mice treated with Nec-1.
We did not observe necroptosis of SMCs in response to oxLDL, possibly
owing to the fact that SMCs take up modified lipids through distinct
mechanisms compared to macrophages and may not trigger the same
signaling pathways in response (40). However, we noted a thicker SMC
cap in mice treated with Nec-1, which could be as a result of fewer pro-
teases being released from macrophages upon necroptosis inhibition
(that is, because intracellular contents are not released into the sur-
rounding area), which could result in the preservation of extracellular
matrix and fibrous cap integrity. This is the first report of Nec-1 being
used in a long-term therapeutic application and opens the door for
next-generation necroptosis inhibitors with improved specificity
and stability for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such
as atherosclerosis.
Current clinical practice relies on invasive angiography to visualize
plaques in patients with atherosclerosis, providing limited detail of
plaque size but no insight into plaque inflammation or vulnerability.
Imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon
emission computed tomography provides the advantage of being non-
invasive, with the ability of detecting specific molecular processes that
provide insight into the pathology of the plaque when specific molecular
tracers are used (41). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a widely used
nuclear tracer to detect inflammation tissues, because macrophages take
up FDG at a higher rate than noninflammatory cells, making FDG a
surrogate of plaque inflammation (42). FDG-PET has supported the
concept that molecular imaging of dominant pathways within the ath-
erosclerotic plaque correlates with lesion vulnerability and thus may be
of added value when assessing overall cardiovascular risk (43). However,
there remains a need to develop novel radiotracers that can detect cor-
onary artery inflammation without the complication of myocardial
uptake and with less sensitivity to metabolic characteristics of the patient
(that is, high fasting blood glucose). We found that 123I-Nec-1 colocalizes
to the atherosclerotic plaques in Apoe−/− mice by autoradiographic imag-
ing and strongly correlated with that of traditional ORO uptake. Al-
though the uptake of the Nec-1 radiotracer was only measured ex vivo
in the current study, similar radiotracers can be developed and labeled
with PET radionuclides and allow Nec-1 to be used in the future for non-
invasive PET imaging in animal models, with the ultimate goal of detect-
ing atherosclerotic lesions in patients with disease.
In summary, this study providesevidence that necroptosis activation
is associated with necrotic core formation in advanced human
atheromas and supports the therapeutic targeting of necroptosis to re-
ducing lesion progression and plaque vulnerability. Our study provides
excitement for the targeting of necroptosis as a diagnostic tool using
either nuclear imaging or/and biomarker expression to better identify
patients at the highest risk for lesion rupture. Our findings offer mech-
anistic insight into how atherogenic ligands drive necrotic core devel-
opment to better devise therapies that specifically inactivate the
necroptotic pathway to directly treat the underlying causes of clinically
vulnerable atherosclerosis.

Human atherosclerotic lesion analysis
For gene expression studies, human arterial samples were obtained
from BiKE at the Centre for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institute,
as previously described (19, 20). In brief, control normal arteries (undi-
seased macroscopically atherosclerosis-free arteries, iliac, and one aorta)
were obtained from organ donors without any current or history of
cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic plaques were obtained from pa-
tients undergoing surgery for stable or unstable carotid stenosis. All
samples were collected with informed consent, and the study was ap-
proved by the Ethical Committee of Northern Stockholm and met all
international standards. Plaque tissues were ruptured with Tissue
Rupturer/Homogenizer (Omni Inc.) and RNA-isolated. Gene ex-
pression profiles were obtained from n = 10 control arteries and n =
127 atherosclerotic plaque samples, and statistical analysis was per-
formed using Student’s t test with correction for multiple comparisons
(P < 0.05). For details on patient characteristics, please see the study by
Razuvaev et al. (19) and Perisic et al. (20). For immunohistochemical
analysis, human coronary artery samples were obtained from the
CVPath Institute Sudden Cardiac Death registry, as previously de-
scribed (44). Sudden death is defined as symptoms commencing within
6 hours of death (witnessed arrest) or death occurring within 24 hours
after the victim was last seen alive in his or her normal state of health.
Comprehensive analysis of coronary artery histology was performed for
each subject. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded coronary artery blocks
werefurthercross-sectioned at5-mmthicknessforanalysis. Aftercareful
examination of hematoxylin and eosin and Movat pentachrome–
stained sections, advanced fibroatheromas and control lesions with
pathologic intimal thickening were selected. Hematoxylin and eosin
images were obtained using Axio Scan.Z1 (Carl Zeiss). Immunohisto-
chemistry for pMLKL was performed using a primary antibody against
humanpMLKL(rabbit monoclonalantibody, Abcam) withasecondary
antibody conjugated to biotin and visualized using diaminobenzidine
(DAB) (Sigma). Quantification of pMLKL-positive areas was per-
formed using ImageJ, and statistical significance between the two
groups was analyzed using unpaired Student’s t test (P < 0.05).
Mice
C57BL6wild-typeandApoe−/−andCasp1−/− mice were purchasedfrom
Jackson Laboratories. Rip3−/− mice were obtained from Genentech. All
animal studies were approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care
and Use Committee in accordance with the international standards set
forth by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Bone marrow–derived macrophages
BMDMs were isolated from femurs of adult wild-type or Rip3−/− mice
and differentiated into macrophages using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin plus either 20% L929 conditioned medi-
um or mouse M-CSF (20 ng/ml) for 7 to 10 days. DAMPs were obtained
by subjecting BMDMs to 3× 30-min freeze-thaw cycle or treatment with
LPS (100 ng/ml) and 50 mM zVAD.fmk for 24 hours, after which the
medium was collected and added to naïve cells at indicated ratios.

 Cell viability assays
Cell death was determined by measuring LDH release into the medi-
um as previously described (45). Briefly, cells were treated with oxLDL
(100 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of 50 mM zVAD.fmk or 50 mM
Nec-1 for 24 hours, and the medium was collected and centrifuged to
pellet cell debris. The amount of LDH in the medium was measured
in a kinetic assay by adding PBS containing 0.02% NADH (reduced
form of NAD+) and 0.03% sodium pyruvate and measuring absorb-
ance at 340 nm for 10 min at 1-min intervals. The slope of the curve
provides a measure of cell death, which was expressed as fold change
relative to control.
RNA isolation and qPCR
BMDMs were treated with control medium with or without oxLDL or
oxLDL + zVAD.fmk for the indicatedtime pointswithorwithout 1-hour
pretreatment with 50 mM DPI. Alternatively, BMDMs were polarized to
M0, M1, or M2 before RNA isolation, as described above. Total RNA
was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer’s
instructions, and complementary DNA was synthesized using an iScript
Reverse Transcription kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed in triplicate
using either SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad)
or TaqMan Gene Expression Assay, and the mRNA level of target genes
was normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase or
b-actin housekeeping genes.
Western blot analysis
For Western blot analysis of RIP3, cells were lysed in 1.25× sample buffer
[83 mM tris (pH 6.8), 6.7% SDS, 13.3% glycerol, 1.3% b-mercaptoethanol,
and 0.03% bromophenol blue] and boiled at 100°C for 5 min before being
subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
Western blot analysis, as previously described (46). PVDF (polyvinylidene
difluoride) membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk, followed by in-
cubation with RIP3 (ProSci Inc., 1:500) or HSP90 (Santa Cruz Bio-
technology, 1:1000) antibodies. For analysis of MLKL protein, cells were
lysed in ice-cold M2 lysis buffer [50 mM NaF, 20 mM tris (pH 7.0),
0.5% NP-40, 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 3 mM EGTA, sup-
plemented with Roche protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails] for
30 min before centrifugation to pellet insoluble component as described
(47). Samples were mixed 3:1 with 4× sample loading buffer (Bio-Rad)
before SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. PVDF membranes were
blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin and probed with MLKL (Milli-
pore, 1:500) or GAPDH (glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase)
(Millipore, 1:1000) antibodies. Goat anti-mouse (1:2500), anti-rabbit
(1:5000),oranti-rat(1:2500)IRDyesecondaryantibodies(Rockland)were
used. The protein bands were visualized using Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (LI-COR Biotechnology).
Electron microscopy
Cultured cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.5) at 4°C. The fixed cells were washed in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer, postfixed in 1% OsO4, and rinsed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer
and distilled water. The fixed cells were lifted with 50 mM EDTA/Hanks’
balanced salt solution and collected by centrifugation. Cell sediments
were washed in 1× PBS, dehydrated in an ethanol series, and embedded
in Spurr resin. Resin blocks were sectioned by the ultramicrotome Leica
EM UC6 using a diamond knife. Ultrathin sections were mounted on
copper grids coated with formvar film. The sections were stained with
2% alcoholic uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate. The stained
sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope,
JEOL 1230.
Efferocytosis assay
Efferocytosis assays were performed as previously described (48, 49).
BMDMs were labeled with Vybrant Dye (5 mM, Invitrogen) for 25 min
at 37°C, and unbound dye was removed with PBS washing. Labeled
BMDMs were then treated for 24 hours with medium alone (control) or
medium containing 5 mM staurosporine (to induce apoptosis), oxLDL
(150 mg/ml) + 100 mM zVAD, or LPS (200 ng/ml) + 100 mM zVAD
(both to induce necroptosis). Dead cells were collected, counted, resus-
pended in control medium, and applied to naïve BMDMs at a ratio of
3:1. After 2 hours, cells were washed six times with cold PBS, and flu-
orescence intensity was quantified using a plate reader. Experiments
were performed in quadruplicate technical replicates at least three
independent times.
Measurement of ROS
BMDMs were preincubated with DPI for 30 min, followed by the cell
permeant reagent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluorescent dye for
1 hour. Cells were then treated with oxLDL or oxLDL + zVAD.fmk, and
fluorescence was measured at 3 and 24 hours as per manufacturer’s in-
structions (Abcam, ab113851).
Promoter luciferase assay
Luciferase reporter constructs containing the human MLKL and RIP3
promoters were purchased from SwitchGear Genomics. RAW264.7
macrophages (American Type Culture Collection) were plated in
24-well plates in 10% FBS DMEM and transfected using Lipofectamine
2000 (Life Technologies) withMLKL-promoter or RIP3-promoterplas-
mids (Renilla-based luciferase reporter) together with pGL3 basic
(firefly-based reporter, Promega) to normalize for transfection efficien-
cy. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with or
without oxLDL (100 mg/ml) as above, for an additional 24 hours. Cells
were harvested in 1× passive lysis buffer and luciferase measured using
the Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All experiments were performed in quadruplicate technical
replicates at least three times.
Atherosclerosis studies
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal
Care and Use Committee, University of Ottawa, Canada. Eight-week-old
apoE−/− mice (total n = 17 mice) were fed an adjusted-calories diet (21%
fat, 0.2% cholesterol; Harlan Teklad) for 4 weeks to induce atherosclerotic
progression. Mice were then injected with time-release placebo (n = 11) or
stable Nec-1 (n = 8) (15) tablets (2 mg/kg per day), which were synthesized
byInnovativeResearchofAmerica.Themicewereeuthanizedafter6weeks
of treatment and perfused with saline, and aortic roots were embedded in
optimum cutting temperature compound medium and frozen. The aortic
roots were sectioned (10 mm) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
lesion area and necrotic core quantification, and a minimum of 10 sections
per animal were measured across the length of the entire aortic root. For en
face aortic lesion quantifications, aortas were dissected removing all
branchingvesselsdowntothefemoralbifurcationandthenslicedventrally,
and images of the aortas were digitally captured using Image-Pro. Lesion
areaswithin the entire lengthof the aortawere quantifiedusing ImageJand

conjugated to biotin and a–smooth muscle actin (monoclonal antibody,
Sigma) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and visualized using DAB or
SIGMAFAST Red (Sigma), respectively. ImageJ was used to quantify
the positive staining area, and the statistical significance between the
two groups was analyzed using Student’s t test (P < 0.05).
Radiochemistry and ex vivo autoradiography study with
ApoE−/− mice
Thetracer 123I-Nec-1(7-123I-Nec-1)wassynthesizedbyaCu(I)-catalyzed
direct halogen exchange reaction with the precursor 7-Br-Nec-1 and
Na123I. Eight-week-old female apolipoprotein E knockout (Apoe−/−)
mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and fed either
a chow or Western diet (TD.10885, Harlan Laboratories) for 2 months
(total n = 6 mice). 7-123I-O-Nec-1 (37.0 to 55.5 MBq) was administrated
intravenously into the mice under anesthetic. After 2 hours, the mice were
euthanized and perfused with PBS, followed by 10% formalin via left
ventricle cannulation. Aorta was dissected from the heart at the base
using a dissecting microscope following the removal of surrounding
fat and connective tissue. En face specimens were immediately exposed
to superresolution phosphor screens in an autoradiography cassette, as
previously described (50). After overnight exposure at room tem-
perature, the screens were scanned with Cyclone Phosphor Imager
(PerkinElmer). Images were analyzed using OptiQuant 5.0 software.
The regionsof interestwere drawn aroundthe lesionsonthe aortic arch,
and the counts in digitallight unit (DLU) andsurface areas in mm2were
measured. The DLU was converted to activity in mCi using a set of cal-
ibration standards with known activities, which were exposed and
scanned on the same screen used for the aorta samples, as previously
described (50, 51). The percentage injected dose (% ID) was calculated
from dividing the activity (mCi) of the lesion by the injected activity.
Activity density in % ID/m2 was calculated and normalized by animal
body weight to get % ID × kg/m2. The areas of the lesions and the whole
aortic arch in mm2 were also recorded using the OptiQuant 5.0 software,
and the percentage of lesion within the area of the aorta vessel wall
was calculated.
