Chemical synapses are the predominant neuron-to-neuron contact in the central nervous system. Presynaptic
boutons of neurons contain hundreds of vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, the diffusible signaling chemicals.
Changes in the number of synapses are associated with numerous brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease
and epilepsy. However, all current approaches for measuring synaptic density in humans require brain tissue from
autopsy or surgical resection. We report the use of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand [11C]UCB-J
combined with positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify synaptic density in the living human brain. Validation
studies in a baboon confirmed that SV2A is an alternative synaptic density marker to synaptophysin. First-in-human
PET studies demonstrated that [11C]UCB-J had excellent imaging properties. Finally, we confirmed that PET imaging of
SV2A was sensitive to synaptic loss in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, [11C]UCB-J PET imaging is a
promising approach for in vivo quantification of synaptic density with several potential applications in diagnosis
and therapeutic monitoring of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
INTRODUCTION
The human brain is estimated to contain 100 trillion synapses (1).
Structural disruption or loss of synapses can result in network dys-
function with aberrant neuronal signaling. Synaptic pathology has been
associated with many brain disorders. Reduced synaptic density in the
seizure onset zone in patients with epilepsy has been shown in neuro-
pathological studies (2–5), and synapse loss in the hippocampus and
cerebral cortex has been closely associated with cognitive impairment
in Alzheimer’s disease (6–9). Moreover, regional synaptic changes have
been demonstrated in patients with autism (10), depression (11), or
schizophrenia (12, 13). However, all approaches for synapse quantifica-
tion in humans depend on examination of brain tissue from autopsy or
surgical resection, thereby greatly limiting the utility of this approach for
early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. A minimally invasive
method for quantification of synaptic density in the living human brain
is therefore desired.
Quantification of synaptic density in brain tissue is typically per-
formedusingimmunohistochemistryorelectronmicroscopy.Antibodies
targeting key proteins located in the pre- or postsynaptic neurons, such
as synaptophysin (SYN), which is present in the membrane of synaptic
vesicles(14), are commonly usedforimmunohistochemical detection of
synaptic elements. In vivo quantification of proteins in the living brain
ispossible using positron emission tomography(PET),andtheuse of PET
imagingiswellestablishedforawiderangeofbrainreceptors,transporters,
and enzymes, as well as other proteins (15). In vivo quantification of
synapses throughout the entire brain may be possible using PET when
combined with a synapse-specific radioligand, but to date, no radio-
ligands have been reported that bind to a protein ubiquitously present
on synaptic vessels. To this end, we developed [11C]UCB-J [(R)-1-
((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophe-
nyl)pyrrolidin-2-one] as a best-in-class PET radioligand for imaging
of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) and demonstrated its
potential in nonhuman primates (16).
SV2 is present in all vertebrates and is an integral membrane protein
located similarly to SYN in the presynaptic vesicle membranes. SV2
consists of three isoforms, with SV2A as the only isoform ubiquitously
and homogeneously located in synapses across the brain (17). Thus,
PET imaging and quantification of SV2A signal may be an excellent
in vivo proxy of synaptic density. Other SV2A radioligands have been
reported recently, including [11C]UCB-A and [18F]UCB-H (18). [11C]
UCB-A binding could be quantified in rats and pigs (19). [18F]UCB-H
displayed good kinetics in rats (20) and nonhuman primates (21), and
acceptable dosimetry in humans (22), but a human brain imaging study
has not yet been reported.
Here, we demonstrate that [11C]UCB-J binds to SV2A and serves as
a synaptic density marker in nonhuman primates as well as in people, in
a first-in-human imaging study in healthy controls and in patients with
epilepsy. In healthy humans, we characterized the pharmacokinetic and
imaging properties of [11C]UCB-J and confirmed SV2A-specific binding.
We also demonstrated proof of concept in epilepsy patients that changes
in synaptic density can be monitored noninvasively. [11C]UCB-J PET is a
promising approach for research, clinical diagnosis, and therapeutic
monitoring in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
RESULTS
SV2A is a marker of synaptic density—A baboon case study
To validate [11C]UCB-J as a marker of synaptic density, we performed a
PET measurement in an olive baboon (Papio anubis), after which the
animal was sacrificed and the brain was dissected for postmortem
tissue studies. After injection of [11C]UCB-J, brain uptake was rapid, with
highest radioactivity concentrations in the cerebral cortex and lowest in
the white matter region centrum semiovale (Fig. 1, A and B). Regional
time-activity curves (TACs) displayed rapid kinetics, with peakuptake of

 10 to 15 [standardized uptake value (SUV); activity normalized to in-
jection dose and body weight] in gray matter regions achieved within
6 to 16 min after injection. Regional volume of distribution (VT) values, a
measure of equilibrium binding, were estimated with the one-tissue (1T)
compartment model and were in accordance with previously reported VT
values in five rhesus monkeys (VT rhesus = 1.86 × VT baboon − 0.0123; R2 =
0.87) (16).
Tissues were sampled from 12 regions in the baboon’s brain and
analyzed by Western blotting and SV2A homogenate binding assays.
To determine whether SV2A can, like the gold standard SYN, be used
as a marker of synaptic density, we compared regional densities of SV2A
and SYN using selective antibodies for SV2A, SYN, and the house-
keeping protein b-actin. SV2A and SYN signals were strong and specific
in all gray matter regions but absent or weak in the centrum semiovale
(Fig. 1C). The in vitro regional distribution of SV2A [optical density
(OD)] correlated well with in vivo PET-measured [11C]UCB-J VT (Fig.
1D). There was an excellent linear correlation between SV2A and the
“gold standard” synaptic marker SYN across all gray matter regions ana-
lyzed (Fig. 1E), indicating that SV2A can be used as an alternative to SYN
for accurate synapse quantification.
To further evaluate the relationship between in vivo [11C]UCB-J
binding and SV2A density, homogenate binding studies were performed
to determine affinity (Kd) and regionalSV2A densities (Bmax). Saturation
studies using [11C]UCB-J were conducted for 12 brain regions in a com-
petition binding assay. [11C]UCB-J bound with an average Kd of 3.9 ±
0.6 nM (±SD, n = 11) to a homogeneous population of binding sites, as
illustrated in the temporal cortex, the region with the highest SV2A
density (Fig. 1, F and G); 11 other regions of the brain are shown in figs.
S1 and S2. The regional SV2A Bmax ranged from 2.2 pmol/mg pro-
tein (111 pmol/ml brain tissue) in the pons to 19.9 pmol/mg protein
(918 pmol/ml brain tissue) in the temporal cortex; specific binding could
not be reliably detected in the centrum semiovale. The in vitro Bmax
valuesalso correlatedwellwiththe in vivo VTvaluesmeasuredinbaboon
(Fig. 1H). There was excellent correlation between the in vitro Bmax
derived from homogenate binding and the regional SV2A Western blot
measurements (Fig. 1I).
To evaluate the cellular distribution of SV2A, we compared the lo-
calization of SV2A and SYN using selective antibodies. Immuno-
reactivity was evaluated in a section of the somatosensory cortex and
the adjacent white matter using confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, J and K).
There was considerable overlap between the staining for SYN and SV2A.
SV2A and SYN staining was negligible in the white matter but high in
the gray matter (Fig. 1J). SV2A and SYN staining was absent in neuronal
cell bodies (white arrows in Fig. 1K) but high at the border of a proximal
dendrite (yellow arrow in Fig. 1K). These data further support SV2A as
an alternative to SYN for synapse quantification.
[11C]UCB-J is a promising radioligand in humans
Five healthy subjects (37 ± 13 years of age; four males and one female)
were evaluated with PET after an intravenous bolus injection of [11C]
UCB-J. All subjects underwent arterial cannulation, and blood was
collected for measurement of the time course of [11C]UCB-J in plasma,
including radiometabolite analysis. Radio-HPLC (high-pressure liquid
chromatography) analysis of the plasma demonstrated three radioactive
peakseluting between 6 and 8 min, with the [11C]UCB-J fraction eluting
at 11 min, comparable to monkey results (16). The unchanged [11C]
UCB-J fraction was 38 ± 16% (±SD) at 15 min after injection and further
decreased to 25 ± 10% at 90 min after injection (table S1). The plasma
freefractionof[11C]UCB-Jinabloodsample takenjustbeforeradioligand
injection was 32 ± 0.7% (±SD) (table S2).
PET summation images in representative subject 1 demonstrated
high radioactivity concentrations in all gray matter regions and low
uptake in white matterregions(Fig. 2A; allothersubjects, fig. S3) similar
to the baboon. [11C]UCB-J had peak SUV of 7 to 11 across gray matter
brain regions at 10 to 25 min after injection, and the centrum semiovale
showed considerably lower uptake than all examined gray matter re-
gions in subject 1 (Fig. 2B; all other subjects, fig. S4). For all subjects,
[11C]UCB-J displayed favorable kinetics in all gray matter regions, with
a steady decline in regional radioactivity over time, starting ~20 min
after injection.
Kinetic analysis provided measures of both SV2A binding (VT and
BPND) and blood flow (K1). Regional VT values were estimated using the
1T model, which provided suitable fits for the TACs and reliable esti-
mates of the VT values (Fig. 2B). VT values ranged from 5.2 ± 0.5 ml/cm3
in the centrum semiovale to 22.5 ± 2.0 ml/cm3 in the putamen (Fig. 2C
and table S3). The coefficient of variation for VT was 9 ± 3% across the
examined brain regions, indicating a low intersubject variability. The K1
values, determined from the 1Tmodel and reflecting blood flow and trac-
er extraction, were heterogeneous across brain regions and ranged from
0.123 ± 0.017 ml/cm3 per minute in the centrum semiovale to 0.376 ±
0.048 ml/cm3 per minute in the putamen (Fig. 2D and table S4). Regional
binding potential (BPND) values equal the ratio of specific to nondisplaceable
(free plus nonspecific) binding and were determined from the VT values
(Fig.2CandtableS3)asVT,region/VT,centrum_semiovale−1.BPNDvaluesranged
from 1.69 ± 0.29 in the hippocampus to 3.33 ± 0.37 in the putamen (Fig. 2E
andtable S5). The intersubject coefficient of variation for BPND was12 ± 2%.
To confirm that [11C]UCB-J binds specifically to SV2A, displace-
ment studies were performed with the SV2A-selective anticonvulsant
levetiracetam (23). Three additional healthy subjects (32 ± 9 years of
age; one male and two females) underwent a bolus plus constant in-
fusion scan with [11C]UCB-J under baseline conditions. One of these
subjects (30 years of age; female) and two additional healthy subjects
(35 and 46 years of age; two males) underwent a displacement measure-
ment in which 1500-mg levetiracetam was administered intravenously
60 to 65 min after the start of [11C]UCB-J infusion. Regional VT values
reached equilibrium after about 40 min (Fig. 3A; individual subjects 6 to
8, fig. S5A). Levetiracetam substantially decreased binding of [11C]UCB-J
in SV2A-rich regions by 90 to 120 min (30 to 60 min after levetiracetam
infusion) as shown in TACs (Fig. 3B; individual subjects 8 to 10, fig. S5B)
and in PET images (subject 8 in Fig. 3C; all subjects, fig. S6). In the
displacement study, mean VT for the 90- to 120-min periods was 44%
lower in gray matter regions and 12% lower in the centrum semiovale,
when compared to mean VT for the 90- to 120-min period measured
under baseline conditions.
[11C]UCB-J binding is reduced in the seizure onset zone of
epilepsy subjects
To evaluate the sensitivity of [11C]UCB-J binding to synaptic loss, [11C]
UCB-J binding was evaluated with PET in three patients with temporal
lobe epilepsy (TLE) and mesial temporal sclerosis (52 ± 6 years of age;
three males). BPND maps were generated with the simplified reference
tissue model 2 (24) using the centrum semiovale as a reference brain
region for nondisplaceable binding. In all three patients, the unilateral de-
crease in uptake in the hippocampus was ipsilateral to the mesial temporal
sclerosis seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visually evident
in the BPND maps and regional TACs (Fig. 4, A to D). The unilateral

 uptake of [11C]UCB-J wasregion-specific, withno asymmetry observed in
the fusiform (Fig. 4E). Regional asymmetry indices factoring in contra-
lateralversus ipsilateral SV2A density were much higher in the hippocam-
pus and amygdala of epilepsy patients than bilateral asymmetry in healthy
subjects (Fig. 4E). In two epilepsy patients, in addition to hippocampal
synapse loss, there was asymmetry in the amygdala, consistent with pre-
vious reports that damage in the amygdala is present in a significant sub-
population of TLE patients (25).
DISCUSSION
Thenumberofsynapsesinthebrainchangesoverthecourseof alifetime,
and synaptogenesis, synaptic pruning, and synaptic degeneration are key
physiologic and pathologic processes regulating synaptic density (26).
Evaluation of synaptic density in humans has been limited to examina-
tion of brain tissue obtained from surgery or autopsy. However, quan-
tification of synaptic densities in the living human brain over time is
essentialto ourunderstanding, diagnosis, and treatment of brain disorders
associated with synaptic pathology. Here, we presented a noninvasive
method for PET imaging and quantification of synaptic density through-
out the brain using the radioligand [11C]UCB-J for the target SV2A—a
synaptic vesicles marker that, in one baboon brain, was shown to localize
withtheacceptedmarkerSYN.Inhumans,[11C]UCB-JboundtoSV2Ain
thebrainandrevealedunilateralsynapticlossinTLEpatients.Thus,SV2A-
PET imaging is a promising approach for quantifying synaptic density in
the living human brain.
The restricted cellular localization of vesicles in synaptic boutons,
their ubiquitous distribution in the brain, and high phylogenetic con-
servation across vertebrate nervous systems have made synaptic vesicle
proteins the prime markers of synaptic density (27–30). SYN is the most
abundant synaptic vesicle protein (31) and is a widely used marker of
synaptic density (32, 33), because it was one of the first characterized
(29, 34) and cloned (35) vesicle membrane proteins. In the baboon case
study, we demonstrated that the cellular and regional distributions of
SV2A and SYN were highly correlated, suggesting that SV2A is a valid
alternative synaptic density marker. Although SYN is the most poly-
dispersed vesicle protein, possibly reflecting its variability among the vesi-
cles of different neurotransmitter classes, SV2A is the most monodispersed
synaptic vesicle protein (36). Consequently, SV2A may provide a more
accurate measure of synaptic density owing to its greater uniformity in
vesicles. The relevance of SV2A as a synaptic marker was recently ex-
emplifiedinastudy in whichthe FYNtyrosinekinase inhibitorAZD0530
rescued both memory and synapse (SV2A) loss in a mouse model of
Alzheimer’s disease (37).
Unlikeotherhumanimagingtechnologies,suchasMRI,PETimaging
is quantitative and provides outcome measures directly related to protein
concentrations that can be cross-validated in animals or postmortem
tissues. For example, VT, one PET-derived outcome measure, is propor-
tional to the ratio of protein density (Bmax) and binding affinity (Kd) (38).
No detailed regional densities of SV2A were available in the literature.
However, in vitro SV2A densities were determined and found to corre-
late well with the in vivo PET VT values. Mean cortical Bmax values in
baboon were 18 pmol/mg protein, somewhat higher than the values of
3 to 12 pmol/mg protein in rats (39, 40) and 3 to 4 pmol/mg protein in

 humans, but these differences are likely due to methodological dis-
similarities in radioligand, isotope, incubation conditions, or tissue type,
for instance. The estimated Kd for SV2A binding by UCB-J was similar
to previously reported inhibition constant (Ki) values in human tissue (6
to 7 nM), further validating our results (18).
Saturation studies with PET can also provide estimates of in vivo
Bmax and Kd values (41). We recently determined the in vivo Kd value
as 3.4 nM and cortical Bmax values in the range of 300 to 400 nM with
[11C]UCB-J in rhesus monkeys (16), which corresponded well with the
current in vitro results in baboon tissues. Thus, the SV2A density in the
temporalcortex isestimatedto be 5.5 × 1017SV2A moleculesperliterof
brain tissue. Assuming a density of 7.2 × 1014 synapses per liter of brain
tissue, as reported for the female human brain (42), and two to five
SV2A copies per vesicle (31, 36), it can be estimated that there are 154
to 385 vesicles per synapse. This number is very similar to the previously
reported 200 to 350 vesicles per active zone in rat cultured hippocampal
preparations, Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, or rat calyx of Held
terminals, although other species have higher numbers of vesicles (43).
In patients with medically refractory TLE and concomitant mesial
temporal sclerosis, in which unilateral loss of neurons is well established
(5), we found ~52% asymmetry in the hippocampus owing to decreased
binding of [11C]UCB-J ipsilateral to the epileptogenic zone. This degree
of reduction in [11C]UCB-J binding corresponds well with previous tissue-
level analyses, where SYN or SV2A was reported to be reduced by 30 to
60% in the anterior temporal neocortex or hippocampus in resected tissue
from TLE patients in parallel with neuronal/synaptic loss (2–5). When
comparing the asymmetry in [11C]UCB-J binding to [18F]FDG (2-deoxy-
2-18F-fluoro-D-glucose), a clinically established marker of glucose metabo-
lism, asymmetry in [11C]UCB-J binding was more specifically localized to
theepileptogenicmesialtemporallobe,whereas[18F]FDGhypometabolism
usually extends to the lateral temporal lobe and other adjacent regions (44).
The reductions in [11C]UCB-J binding were also larger than those typically
reported for [18F]FDG (typically <20%), but these findings require con-
firmation, ideally by comparing both radioligands in the same subject.
[11C]UCB-J may thus provide accurate identification of the epilepto-
genic zone and have high utility in pharmacoresistant TLE patients in
which surgery is frequently the only therapeutic possibility.
The current study has several limitations. The overall sample size
was small; PET studies were performed in 13 subjects, and tissue experi-
mentswere performedusing only one baboon. Also, it could not be con-
cluded that the centrum semiovale is a suitable reference region for
[11C]UCB-J quantification. A reference tissue devoid of specific binding
can be usedasa substitute forarterialblood sampling. In ourtissue mea-
surements, we found that the centrum semiovale contained none or neg-
ligible SV2A (at least 45-fold lower than cortical regions). However, PET
studies with levetiracetam suggested a small amount of displaceable [11C]
UCB-J binding in centrum semiovale. These preliminary results did not
include correction for the partial volume effect (45), which causes spill-in
of radioactivity from gray matter to white matter. Centrum semiovale
therefore remains a promising reference region, and follow-up studies
and analyses, including blocking studies in humans with other SV2A
ligands, such as brivaracetam, will be required to validate the absence
of SV2A-specific [11C]UCB-J binding in this region.
To facilitate that translation of synaptic density imaging with SV2A-
PET, it is important to review a number of methodological considera-
tions. Evaluation of the TACs suggests that the outcome measure VT can
be reliably estimated using only a 60-min acquisition, which would im-
provepatientcomfort.Alternatively,usingconstant infusion can provide
a very short imaging period during equilibrium. Notably, [11C]UCB-J is
radiolabeledwithcarbon-11,withashorthalf-life(t1/2)of20min.However,
diagnostic PET radioligands are typically labeled with fluorine-18 (t1/2 =
110 min) to allow for distribution from production facilities to hospitals.
Fortuitously, UCB-J contains three fluorine atoms and radiosynthesis of
[18F]UCB-J may thus be possible.
PET imaging of SV2A now provides the unique opportunity to eval-
uate synaptic density in the living human brain. Our in vitro and in vivo
data support the hypothesis that SV2A-PET imaging can be used as a
minimally invasive, quantitative marker of synaptic density. The radio-
ligand [11C]UCB-J has exceptional PET imaging qualities for SV2A in
the human brain. We demonstrate feasibility in epilepsy, but the
application of SV2A-PET imaging as a synaptic marker may be particu-
larly relevant to Alzheimer’s disease, in which the pathology is character-
izedbyaccumulationofmisfoldedproteins(plaquescomposedofamyloid
b, and Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles) and synaptic loss (46).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The overall objective was a proof-of-concept study that SV2A-PET im-
aging could be a method for in vivo measurement of synaptic density.
The size of the healthy control population (n = 10) was consistent with
previous novel radioligand evaluation studies (47–49) and was chosen
to demonstrate the imaging characteristicsofthe tracer, including kinet-
ic analyses and determination of population values for the study end
points (Kd, VT, and BPND). The epilepsy patient population was chosen
to demonstrate the presence of a large asymmetry in the temporal lobe.
The number of epilepsy subjects was based on the small variability in the
bilateral asymmetry index observed in the PET studies in healthy control
subjects, and the large reduction in synaptic density in resected tissue
from epilepsy subjects (2–5). All outliers were included in the analysis,
andno datawere excluded.Noexperimentalgroupswere includedin the
study,andnorandomizationwasrequired.Theauthorswerenotblinded
to the results. We performed a terminal study in one baboon to directly
compare in vivo/in vitro results of tracer binding to synaptic vesicles and
localization in different brain regions; the selection of n = 1 was based on a
conservative approach to terminal primate studies.
PET imaging and brain tissue measurements in a baboon
Experiments were conducted in one olive baboon (P. anubis) according
to a protocol approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee, as described in Supplementary Methods.
Human subjects
Ten healthy subjects (seven males and three females; 36 ± 10 years of
age) and three epilepsy subjects (three males; 52 ± 6 years of age) were
included in the study. All epilepsy patients had medically refractory
mesial TLE with hippocampal sclerosis and were undergoing presurgical
evaluation. None of the epilepsy patients had received levetiracetam. The
studies were performed under a protocol approved by the Yale Univer-
sity Human Investigation Committee andthe Yale New Haven Hospital
Radiation Safety Committee, and in accordance with the U.S. federal
policy for the protection of human research subjects contained in Title
45 Part 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46). Written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects. As part of the subject
evaluation, MR images were acquired on all subjects to eliminate

 subjects with structural brain abnormalities and for registration of
PET images. MRI was performed on a 3-T whole-body scanner (Trio,
Siemens Medical Solutions) with a circularly polarized head coil. The
dimension and pixel size of MR images were 256 × 256 × 176 and
0.98 × 0.98 × 1.0 mm3, respectively.
PET measurements in human subjects
[11C]UCB-J was synthesized at the Yale PET Center as previously re-
ported (16). All [11C]UCB-J PET measurements were conducted on the
High Resolution Research Tomograph (Siemens Medical Solutions),
whichacquires207 slices(1.2-mmslice separation) witha reconstructed
image resolution (full width at half maximum) of ~3 mm. Before every
[11C]UCB-J injection, a 6-min transmission scan was performed for at-
tenuation correction. PET data were acquired in list mode for 120 min
after the start of the [11C]UCB-J administration. Five control subjects
(subjects 1 to 5) and three epilepsy subjects underwent a PET scan after
an intravenous bolus injection of [11C]UCB-J over 1 min (by an auto-
mated infusion pump; Harvard PHD 22/2000, Harvard Apparatus). In
five other control subjects (subjects 6 to 10), bolus plus infusion studies
were performed, where the bolus was followed by a constant infusion to
the end of the PET acquisition (50). In the bolus plus constant infusion
studies, the applied Kbol value was 150 min, based on simulations using
the regional TACs from the five healthy control subjects evaluated with
PET after bolus injection of [11C]UCB-J. Baseline measurements were
performed in three subjects (subjects 6 to 8). In subject 8, a second PET
displacement measurement with levetiracetam was performed on the
same day. Two other subjects (subjects 9 and 10) only underwent a
PET measurement with levetiracetam displacement. In thedisplacement
PET measurement, 1500 mg of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam was
intravenously infused over 5 min starting 60 min after the start of
[11C]UCB-J administration to assess specific binding.
The injected mass was limited to 10 mg of UCB-J. The injected dose
of [11C]UCB-J was 408 ± 179 MBq, with specific activity at the time of
injection of 176 ± 101 MBq/nmol. The corresponding injected UCB-J
mass was 3.7 ± 2.6 nmol or 15 ± 10 ng/kg.
The dynamic emission data were reconstructed into 33 frames (6 ×
0.5, 3 × 1, 2 × 2, and 22 × 5 min) with corrections for attenuation, nor-
malization, scatter, randoms, and dead time using the MOLAR
algorithm (51). Event-by-event motion correction (52) was included
in the reconstruction on the basis of motion detection with a Polaris
Vicra optical tracking system (NDI Systems) using reflectors mounted
on a swim cap worn by the subject.
Arterial input functions
Each subject underwent catheterization of the radial artery for blood
sampling. Samples were drawn every 10 s for the first 90 s and at
1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90,
105, and 120 min after [11C]UCB-J injection. For each sample, plasma
was obtained by centrifugation at 4°C (2930g for 5 min). Whole blood
and plasma were counted in cross-calibrated g-counters (Wizard2;
PerkinElmer). Plasma samples at 3, 8, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min after
[11C]UCB-J injection were also analyzed for unmetabolized [11C]
UCB-J fraction. Metabolite analysis and free fraction of [11C]UCB-J
in plasma were determined as described in Supplementary Methods.
Image registration and definition of regions of interest
For each subject, the hardware motion-corrected dynamic PET data
were coregistered to an early summed PET image (0 to 10 min after
[11C]UCB-J injection) using a six-parameter mutual information
algorithm (FLIRT of FSL) to eliminate any residual motion. The
summed PET image was coregistered to the subject’s individual T1-
weighted3-TMRimage(six-parameterrigidregistration),whichwassub-
sequently coregistered to the automated anatomical labeling (AAL)
template in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using non-
linear transformation (BioImage Suite) (53). Regions of interest were
taken fromthe AAL template forSPM2in MNI space. Using the inverse
combined transformations from template to PET space, we generated re-
gional TACs for the amygdala, caudate nucleus, centrum semiovale, cer-
ebellum, frontal cortex, fusiform, hippocampus, occipital cortex, parietal
cortex, putamen, temporal cortex, and thalamus. Values are expressed in
SUV (dimensionless) equal to the regional activity concentration (Bq/ml)
normalized by the ratio of injected dose (kBq) to subject weight (kg).
Quantitative analysis of [11C]UCB-J binding
Regional TACs were analyzed with kinetic models using the arterial
plasma TAC as input function. The regional distribution volumes (VT)
(38) were calculated using the 1T compartment model asK1/k2. For bolus
plus constant infusion studies, VT was calculated as the ratio of tissue
activity (from PET) to that in metabolite-corrected plasma. On the basis
of the Western blot, homogenate binding, and confocal microscopy
results, the centrum semiovale was used as a reference region for deter-
mination of nondisplaceable binding and BPND values. Regional BPND
values were calculated as VT,region/VT,centrum_semiovale − 1.
Parametric BPND maps were generated using the simplified reference
tissue model 2 (24) and used for calculation of regional BPND values.
Asymmetry indices in regional BPND values were calculated in healthy
control as 200% × [(left − right)/(left + right)] and in epilepsy patients as
200% × [(contralateral − ipsilateral)/(contralateral + ipsilateral)]. All kinetic
modeling was performed with in-house developed programs written with
IDL 8.0 (ITT Visual Information Solutions). For parameter estimation,
data points were weighted on the basis of noise equivalent counts in
each frame.
