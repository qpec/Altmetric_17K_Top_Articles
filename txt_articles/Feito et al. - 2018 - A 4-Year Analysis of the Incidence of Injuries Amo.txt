Background: High-intensity functional training (HIFT) is a new training modality that merges high-intensity exercise with functional
(multijoint) movements. Even though others exist, CrossFit training has emerged as the most common form of HIFT. Recently,
several reports have linked CrossFit training to severe injuries and/or life-threatening conditions, such as rhabdomyolysis.
Empirical evidence regarding the safety of this training modality is currently limited.
Purpose: To examine the incidence of injuries related to CrossFit participation and to estimate the rate of injuries in a large cross-
sectional convenience sample of CrossFit participants from around the world.
Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
Methods: A total of 3049 participants who reported engaging in CrossFit training between 2013 and 2017 were surveyed.
Results: A portion (30.5%) of the participants surveyed reported experiencing an injury over the previous 12 months because of
their participation in CrossFit training. Injuries to the shoulders (39%), back (36%), knees (15%), elbows (12%), and wrists (11%)
were most common for both male and female participants. The greatest number of injuries occurred among those who participated
in CrossFit training 3 to 5 days per week (w2 ¼ 12.51; P ¼ .0019). Overall, and based on the assumed maximum number of workout
hours per week, the injury rate was 0.27 per 1000 hours (females: 0.28; males: 0.26), whereas the assumed minimum number of
workout hours per week resulted in an injury rate of 0.74 per 1000 hours (females: 0.78; males: 0.70).
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CrossFit training is relatively safe compared with more traditional training modalities.
However, it seems that those within their first year of training as well as those who engage in this training modality less than 3 days
per week and/or participate in less than 3 workouts per week are at a greater risk for injuries.

High-intensity functional training (HIFT), which merges
high-intensity exercise with functional (multijoint) move-
ments, has emerged as a new training modality.9,22
Although limited research exists, several studies have dem-
onstrated HIFT as a viable modality to improve aerobic
capacity, muscular strength, and overall fitness.21,22,34
CrossFit training, a type of HIFT regimen, is one of the
fastest growing fitness programs today.39 Overall, the aim
of CrossFit training is “to forge broad, general, and inclusive
fitness” to prepare people for any physical challenge, and it
specializes in “not specializing.”16 Unlike other fitness pro-
grams, this methodology consists of “constantly varied, high-
intensity, functional movements” that are believed to help
people improve the breadth and depth of their physical adap-
tations and gain strength, endurance, and power.16
Although several reports have linked CrossFit to severe inju-
ries and/or life-threatening conditions, such as rhabdomyo-
lysis,18,30,43 empirical evidence regarding the safety of HIFT
and CrossFit training is currently limited.
Previous investigators have examined the nature of inju-
ries related to CrossFit training, and none has substanti-
ated the notion that this training program might be any
more “extreme” or dangerous than other exercise training
programs.19,32,46 In fact, the rate of injuries reported by

 these investigators is between 2.0 and 3.5 injuries per 1000
hours of training, which is lower than more traditional
forms of training.24 Most recently, Poston and colleagues36
compared the risk of injuries during HIFT with traditional
training among military personnel and suggested that
HIFT exhibited a similar or even lower potential for inju-
ries than more traditional training activities in this
population.
Although informative, one of the biggest drawbacks to
these aforementioned studies is the small sample utilized
to calculate the risk of injuries, limiting their generalizabil-
ity to a larger population in addition to increasing the
potential errors associated with these estimates. With over
13,000 affiliates around the world, CrossFit training is one
of the largest training modalities, with millions of partici-
pants. Therefore, and considering the limited evidence, we
conducted a retrospective study that evaluated the inci-
dence of injuries among CrossFit participants over a 4-
year period. Our aim was to (1) examine the incidence of
injuries related to CrossFit training among a large sample
of participants and (2) estimate the rate of injuries among a
large cross-sectional convenience sample of CrossFit parti-
cipants from around the world.
METHODS
This observational study was designed to reach the great-
est number of participants and provide a large cross-
sectional convenience sample of CrossFit athletes. For this
purpose, we created an electronic version of a survey tool
using a Google-based form in English and Spanish. Adults
older than 18 years with more than 3 months of CrossFit
experience were asked to participate in this study. We
used snowball sampling2 to distribute our survey among
members of the CrossFit community using social media
outlets, email, and word of mouth. The survey was com-
pleted anonymously. Based on previous research, we con-
sidered this an appropriate survey methodology for this
study.3,38 Our survey was distributed before the beginning
of the competition season in consecutive years (2013-2017)
between mid-December and the end of February of the
following year. We chose this time frame to appropriately
capture injuries that occurred within the previous year
only.
We used an online application (Bitly) to track the number
of “clicks” that our survey obtained to estimate our global
reach and response rate. This tracking was completely anon-
ymous and did not store IP addresses from any computer. All
participants provided consent before beginning the survey,
and the study protocol was approved by the Kennesaw State
University Institutional Review Board.
Questionnaire
We were interested in obtaining the most information pos-
sible regarding individual participation in CrossFit train-
ing. Thus, we used a mixed-methods design,33 in which
most questions required a predetermined response, while
others were open ended and allowed participants to
elaborate on their individual responses. The questionnaire
inquired about the frequency of participation in CrossFit
training and history of injuries while participating in this
training modality. Biological variables (eg, age and sex)
were included in the questionnaire as descriptive variables.
To gauge their CrossFit training regimen, all participants
were asked about their weekly participation and number of
weekly workouts.
Considering the limited information on this topic and
the lack of evidence regarding the most common injuries
experienced by those involved in CrossFit training, we
asked survey respondents if they had suffered any injury
related to their participation in CrossFit training during
the previous 12 months. To avoid misinterpretation of
what constitutes an injury, we used the definition pro-
vided by Weisenthal and colleagues,46 who defined an
injury as “any muscle, tendon, bone, joint, or ligament
injury sustained while doing CrossFit that resulted in
your consultation with a physician, or health care pro-
vider, AND caused you to stop or reduce your usual phys-
ical activity, your typical participation in CrossFit, or
caused you to have surgery.” In addition, we asked survey
respondents to identify the injured body part as well as to
briefly elaborate on their type of injury. This type of
descriptive information allows for future evaluations of
the type of injuries commonly reported by participants
engaged in this training modality. Although respondents
were able to choose as many body parts as needed and
described their injuries in an open-ended question, we
dichotomized their responses to either a single injury or
multiple injuries (if they chose multiple sites or the same
site multiple times).
Injury Incidence
Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a health
condition in a population at a designated period of time and
provides an indication of the extent of a health problem.11
Our survey queried participants about the number of inju-
ries experienced during the previous 12 months as a result
of their participation in CrossFit training (ie, “During the
past year, how many times would you say you have been
injured because of your participation in CrossFit
training?”). Overall, incidence measurements are propor-
tions and are expressed herein as percentages (%).
Injury Rates
In addition to examining the incidence of these injuries,
we were interested in determining the actual injury rate.
While incidence data provide an indication of how com-
mon a problem can be, injury rates give us the actual
measurement and provide a way to compare between par-
ticipants.29 In our case, the population in question was
people who participated in CrossFit training and had sus-
tained injury to a body part. Considering the differences
in how often people participate in CrossFit training, we
were interested in determining the total amount of time
that a person was exposed (workouts) instead of the num-
ber of people reporting injuries.29 Therefore, we used the
2
Feito et al
The Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine
 total number of injuries reported by participants during
the previous year as our numerator for the injury rate.
For our denominator, we created a variable that would
“balance” the exposure of a participant to sustain bodily
damage (a workout hour). To this effect, we assumed that
every participant completed an hour workout (time), sim-
ilar to other studies,41,46 and multiplied that to their
reported frequency of weekly workouts, and then we mul-
tiplied it by the total number of weeks throughout the
year (ie, 1 hour/session � frequency of workouts/week �
weeks/year). Because both the frequency of weekly work-
outs and the time participated were reported in ranges,
we created minimum and maximum approximations for
each range. Because we wanted to examine the risk of
injuries over a year, we considered that 50 weeks would
be an appropriate minimum approximation of training for
most participants and used 52 weeks as our maximum
approximation. Analyzing the data for this type of range
provides a more accurate estimate of the “real risk” of this
activity, considering that those with greater exposure
may inevitably be more prone to injuries, not necessarily
because of the activity per se but simply because of their
exposure. Considering that these rates are typically very
small numbers, we report injury rates per 1000 workout
hours.
Statistical Analysis
Means and SDs were calculated for different age groups.
Frequency counts and percentages were computed for all
categorical variables. To compare categorical variables, we
used the chi-square test. Incidence is presented as propor-
tions (%) based on the total number of surveys completed,
and incidence rates are calculated based on an assumed
minimum of 50 weeks of training within the previous cal-
endar year and an assumed maximum of 52 weeks of train-
ing within the previous calendar year.
All data were collected and downloaded into Excel 2011
(Microsoft). Statistical analyses were conducted using R
3.3.6 (R Core Team). A significance level of alpha ¼ 0.05
was chosen to denote statistical significance; P values are
reported as 2-tailed.
RESULTS
Participants
The online application reported a total of 5141 total clicks to
our survey from 42 different countries. Of those clicks, 3079
participants responded to our survey. Therefore, we esti-
mate our completion rate as 60%. Thirty participants did
not complete all the questions in the survey. Because we
were unable to identify why they did not complete all
questions, we eliminated their surveys from the total
number of responses. Thus, our final analysis included
3049 participants with a mean age of 36.8 ± 9.8 years
(Table 1). The survey was open to anyone with internet
access, with 88% of respondents identifying themselves
as living in the United States and 99% completing the
survey in English (Figure 1).
Injury Incidence
Of the 3049 participants who completed the survey, 931
(30.5%) reported suffering an injury related to their partic-
ipation in CrossFit training (Table 2). Overall, no signifi-
cant differences were observed between male and female
participants who reported experiencing an injury (females:
14.3% [n ¼ 436]; males: 16.2% [n ¼ 495]; w2 ¼ 1.65; P ¼
.1989). Of those who reported an injury, 62.4% (n ¼ 581)
reported an injury to a single body part, while 37.6% (n ¼
350) reported injuries to multiple body parts. Overall, male
participants reported a greater number of injuries

Incidence of Injuries Among CrossFit-Trained Participants

 compared with female participants (w2 ¼ 8.43; P ¼ .0037);
however, the location of those injuries was similar between
the 2 groups. The shoulders (39%), back (36%), knees (15%),
elbows (12%), and wrists (11%) were the most common sites
of injury (Figure 2). A total of 6 cases (0.6%) of exertional
rhabdomyolysis were reported among this sample.
Among those who reported experiencing an injury, the
proportion of injuries was dependent on how long a partici-
pant had participated in CrossFit training. Those with more
than 3 years of experience reported more injuries (43.1%)
compared with those with 1 to 3 years (38.8%) and those
with less than 1 year (18.0%) of experience (w2 ¼ 12.51; P
¼ .0019). In addition, significant differences existed between
female and male participants when comparing years of
experience (w2 ¼ 6.15; P ¼ .0461). When further examining
sex-based differences and years of experience, only male par-
ticipants with the most experience reported having suffered
a CrossFit training–related injury more often compared
with those with 1 to 3 years and those with less than 1
year of experience (28.3%, 15.8%, and 12.6%, respectively;
P ¼ .013). There were no significant diffferences in injury
incidence among female participants, regardless of expe-
rience. When we examined the incidence of injuries based
on how often participants engaged in CrossFit training
(Table 2), we found that those who engaged in this train-
ing modality 3 to 5 days per week reported a greater num-
ber of injuries compared with those who participated less
than 3 days per week and those who participated more
than 5 days per week (w2 ¼ 1.3529; P ¼ .5084). Significant
differences existed between these 3 groups and between
sexes (w2 ¼ 23.15; P < .001).
Injury Rates
The injury rate distribution resulted in a severely right
tail–skewed data set, with the majority of participants
reporting low injury rates. Based on the assumed maxi-
mum number of workout hours per week, the injury rate
was 0.27 per 1000 hours (females: 0.28; males: 0.26),
whereas the assumed minimum number of workout hours
per week resulted in an injury rate of 0.74 per 1000 hours
(females: 0.78; males: 0.70). Considering the skewness of
the data, we felt that using the median value was the most
appropriate measure for the overall injury rate.45 When
stratified by sex, female participants had higher injury
rates for both the assumed maximum (0.28/1000 hours) and
minimum (0.78/1000 hours) when compared with the
assumed maximum (0.26/1000 hours) and minimum (0.70/
1000 hours) for male participants (Table 3); however, no
significant differences were observed between male and
female participants. No significant differences were
observed between age groups for participants experiencing
injuries (w2 ¼ 11.302; P ¼ .1260).
When we compared the injury rates based on the fre-
quency of CrossFit training participation, we observed a
significantly higher rate of injuries among those who
reported CrossFit training less than 3 days per week (min-
imum, 2.46/1000 workout hours; maximum, 0.54/1000
workout hours) compared with those engaging in this train-
ing modality 3 to 5 days per week (minimum, 0.90/1000
workout hours; maximum, 0.30/1000 workout hours) and
those engaging more than 5 days per week (minimum,
0.53/1000 workout hours; maximum, 0.22/1000 workout
hours) (Table 3).
Last, we examined injury rates among participants
based on how long they reported participating in CrossFit
training. Overall, those with less than 6 months of experi-
ence had the highest rates of injuries (minimum, 3.90/1000
workout hours; maximum, 1.15/1000 workout hours), fol-
lowed by those with 6 to 12 months of experience (mini-
mum, 3.21/1000 workout hours; maximum, 1.01/1000
workout hours). Based on these data, the rate of injuries
was inversely proportional to years of experience (Table 3).
In addition, we stratified our analysis to include sex and
workout frequency and observed that those who partici-
pated in the least number of workouts per week, regardless

who participated most often (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
The present study describes the incidence of injuries among
CrossFit participants and suggests that, unlike some media
reports, the incidence of injuries among participants in this
popular training modality may not be as high as previously
suggested. Overall, CrossFit training seems to be a safe
exercise program that has provided an avenue for thou-
sands of people around the world to become physically
active; although participation numbers worldwide are
debatable, the significant rise in the number of affiliates
since 2009 (from 1000 in February 2009 to over 13,000 in
January 20187) and the rising number of participants in the
CrossFit Open8 suggest an increase in the popularity of this
training modality. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to include a large multiyear sample of participants involved

Incidence of Injuries Among CrossFit-Trained Participants

 in CrossFit training. Overall, our findings suggest that the
rate of injuries for less engaged participants was 0.74 inju-
ries per 1000 hours compared with 0.27 injuries per 1000
hours for those more engaged. In addition, male partici-
pants were more likely to report an injury compared with
female participants, while those participating in CrossFit
training less often (<3 d/wk) and with less experience
(<1 year) were more likely to report an injury compared
with those who were more engaged in this training
modality.
Although a rationale for these findings may be specula-
tive, we believe that these injury rates are appropriate,
considering the nature of this training modality and the
skill needed to complete many of the tasks associated with
it. Keeping in mind the “constantly varied” nature of Cross-
Fit training, it makes sense that those with the least expe-
rience may be more prone to injuries as a result of strength
and/or flexibility issues that may hinder their ability to
complete some of the more basic exercises. Moreover, those
who described themselves as “less experienced” in this
study may not necessarily be inexperienced exercisers; it
may be that those with less experience in CrossFit training,
but who are more athletic, push themselves more and
therefore put themselves at greater risk for injuries. Our
speculations here are supported by the fact that those with
greater experience reported injuries less often than those
with less experience. As a result, it is important that parti-
cipants engaging in CrossFit training initially undergo an
introduction to the training modality and work within their
abilities to prevent potential injuries.
In this study, 30.5% of respondents reported experienc-
ing an injury over the previous 12 months. These findings
are in agreement with those of Sprey et al,41 who reported
an injury incidence of 30% among 566 Brazilian CrossFit
participants, and Montalvo and colleagues,31 who stated
that 55% of the athletes surveyed reported acute injuries.
In addition, our findings are similar to those of Moran
et al,32 who reported that male participants experienced
an injury more often than female participants. Investiga-
tors have provided insight to the rates of injuries among
different leisure-time activities,20,35,37 and although we
cannot make direct comparisons with our findings, it is
interesting to note the similar inverse relationships in
which inactive participants are more likely to experience
an injury as a result of lower fitness levels.20
Considering the popularity of this training program,
and the differences found between men and women as well
as among levels of experience, it is important to describe
injuries in a manner that can be compared between stud-
ies. As such, it is important to compare injury rates
instead of simply the incidence of injuries, as exposure to
training (ie, how often) will have an impact on the likeli-
hood of experiencing an injury. Although we have pro-
vided injury estimates based on participation, our
overall findings are well below previously reported injury
rates.15,19,28,46 For example, Hak et al19 reported on 132
participants (19-57 years old) and calculated an injury
rate of 3.1 per 1000 hours. Meanwhile, Weisenthal
et al46 reported on 486 CrossFit training participants and
reported an incidence of injuries of 20%, without a
specified injury rate. However, this injury rate was later
reported as 2.4 injuries per 1000 hours of training.15 Most
recently, Mehrab and colleagues28 surveyed 553 Dutch
CrossFit athletes and reported a 50% incidence of injuries,
and although they did not provide an injury rate, they
reported that athletes with less than 6 months of experi-
ence had a nearly 4 times greater risk of injuries compared
with those with more than 24 months of experience. We
believe that the differences seen in the injury rates in our
study, compared with those previously mentioned, have to
do with how we calculated our rate of injuries, which
included the number of workouts per week versus the total
number of days a workout was completed. This method
provides a more accurate assessment of the injury risk,
as every session serves as a potential period in which an
injury can occur.
Over the past several years, CrossFit training has been
scrutinized in the mainstream media because of the sup-
posed high incidence of injuries; however, these statements
seem not to be supported by empirical evidence.6,23
Although several case studies exist documenting injuries
from this training modality,10,25 these often provide a case
of a single athlete, which although unfortunate may not
apply to the entire population of CrossFit participants.
These cases should serve as reminders to coaches and prac-
titioners that unfortunate events can occur but should not
be generalizable to the thousands of participants who
engage in this training modality annually.
Additionally, this training modality has been linked with
reports of rhabdomyolysis,18,43 a potentially lethal condi-
tion resulting from the breakdown of muscle tissue charac-
terized by pain, weakness, swelling, and blood in the urine,
which can lead to renal failure and death.5 Although the
incidence of rhabdomyolysis in the general population is
unknown, its development may be associated with genetic
(eg, McArdle disease and sickle cell trait) or acquired con-
ditions (eg, trauma, drug use, infection).5 The most common
causes of rhabdomyolysis in adults include illicit drugs,
alcohol abuse, and trauma (ie, crush injuries)26; nonethe-
less, while rare, several reports exist of people experiencing
rhabdomyolysis after engaging in exercise training and
other sports.1,13,14,27,40,42 In addition, more common
leisure-time physical activities such as indoor cycling,42
resistance training,13 and ultimate Frisbee27 have also
resulted in reports of exertional rhabdomyolysis. In our
study, 6 participants (0.6%) reported a medical diagnosis
of exertional rhabdomyolysis because of their participation
in CrossFit training. Future studies should be designed to
further investigate the occurrence of this condition among
active adults engaged in this training modality to elucidate
the real risk of developing rhabdomyolysis as a result of
CrossFit training.
Although surveys are subject to recall bias, and some
participants may have underreported their injuries, the use
of surveys to retrospectively describe injury data is common
in the literature.12,44 Unlike other investigators who used
message boards and direct mailings, we distributed our
survey using social media outlets, which have been consid-
ered effective tools for recruiting study participants.4,17
Nonetheless, we acknowledge that our sample size was
6
Feito et al
The Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine
 limited to only a small portion of those who engage in this
training modality around the world and that the survey
was primarily completed by those who spoke English and
had access to the internet.
The lack of randomization could have potentially biased
our results, as participants with a history of injuries might
have been more likely to respond to our survey. Neverthe-
less, our method of producing a minimum and maximum for
injury rates based on a participant’s workout frequency cre-
ated a more complete assessment of the exposure to CrossFit
training, depicting a data set that may offer a more accurate
representation of the level of risk related to CrossFit train-
ing compared with previous studies,15,19,28,46 which have
reported a single injury rate. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide this type of range in the literature.
Moreover, if our sample was indeed partial toward those
with injuries, then future studies should result in a lower
incidence of injuries and potentially lower injury rates. Addi-
tionally, previous investigators have studied the validity of
self-reporting the injury history,12,44 suggesting that inju-
ries that have a longer period of symptoms or require the
attention of a medical professional are more likely to be
remembered than minor injuries. Additional studies should
continue to examine the potential implication of these mea-
sures among this group of active people.
CONCLUSION
This study provides valuable contributions to a currently
scarce body of literature. Overall, CrossFit training seems
to be a safe training modality for most participants; how-
ever, our findings suggest that there are 3 main groups that
might be at a greater risk for injuries, including those who
(1) are within their first year of participation, (2) engage in
this training modality less than 3 days per week, and (3)
participate in less than 3 workouts per week. As such, and
considering these findings, we encourage fitness profes-
sionals to pay close attention to these people and potentially
develop “beginner” programs that promote skill progression
within the first year of participation to minimize the risk of
injuries.
