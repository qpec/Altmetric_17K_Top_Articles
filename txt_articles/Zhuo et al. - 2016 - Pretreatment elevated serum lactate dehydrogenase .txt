Abstract
Background: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a hypoxia-regulator plays a vital role in alternative metabolic pathways of cancer
cells. Numerous studies have assessed the prognostic value of elevated pretreatment LDH in malignant mesothelioma (MM).
However, the results have been largely inconsistent. Hence, the aim of current study was to investigate the prognostic value of
pretreatment LDH levels in patients with MM by performing a meta-analysis of relevant studies.
Methods:A literature search for English language studies, which investigated the association of LDH levels with overall survival (OS)
in malignant mesothelioma, was performed in the electronic databases, PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. Pooled
hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran Q and
I2 statistics. Sensitivity analysis, meta-regression model, and subgroup analysis were performed to trace the source of heterogeneity,
if applicable.
Results: A total of 9 studies with a combined study population of 1977 patients came within the purview of this meta analysis.
Pooled HR for OS in patients with high LDH level was 1.68 (95% CI=1.36–2.00). Significant heterogeneity was observed in the
included studies (I2=54.1%, P=0.026). Sensitivity analysis after sequential exclusion of 1 study at a time, and meta-regression with
inclusion of 6 confounding factors failed to identify the source of heterogeneity. However, in the subgroup analysis, it was found that
the publication of Nojiri et al was the origin of heterogeneity. When omitted the publication of Nojiri et al, the pooled HR of the rest 8
studies was 1.83 (95% CI=1.45–2.20, I2=0.0%, P=0.723). Egger test and funnel plots excluded the possibility of publication bias
affecting the results of the current meta-analysis.
Conclusion: A negative association was observed between high LDH levels and poor overall survival in the current study. Our
findings suggest that pretreatment LDH level could serve as a useful predictor of prognosis in patients with malignant mesothelioma.

1. Introduction
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but aggressive and fatal
neoplasm that originates from the thoracic and abdominal
serosal membranes.[1] Environmental and occupational exposure
to asbestos is causally associated with its causation.[2] Due to
delayed diagnosis and long latent interval between onset and
clinical symptoms, the prognosis of MM remains extremely poor.
The natural history of untreated patients was only 4 to 12
months.[3] Conversely, specialized mesothelioma centers employ
multimodality approaches, including surgical resection, chemo-
therapy, and radiation, with survival in excess of 20 months
depending on stage.[4] Therefore, early predictors of prognosis
may help guide intensive treatment protocols to improve survival
outcomes or provide best supportive care to improve quality of
life for patients with short life expectancy.
Clinical practice guidelines are based on the International
Mesothelioma Interest Group (IMIG) TNM staging system.[5]
However, the current staging system relies on anatomical
information as the main reference, and does not take the
biological heterogeneity into account. Therefore, the staging
system is not enough for prediction of survival outcomes. In
addition, only pathological type and performance status have
been shown to be relatively consistent prognostic factors during
pretreatment assessment.[1] Thus, it is necessary to identify
more prognostic factors to tailor the treatment to individual
patients.

 Unlike normal cells, cancer cells tend to employ alternate
metabolic pathways.[6] They generate adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) mainly through anaerobic glycolysis. Lactate dehydroge-
nase (LDH) as a hypoxia-regulator plays a vital role in anaerobic
glycolysis.[7] The prognostic value of serum LDH has been
demonstrated in several tumors, including nonsmall cell lung
cancer,[8] colorectal cancer,[9] prostate cancer,[10] as well as other
solid tumors.[11,12]
Several studies have assessed the prognostic value of elevated
pretreatment LDH levels for the prediction of survival outcomes
in MM.[13–21] However, the results have been largely inconsis-
tent. Moreover, because of the low incidence of MM, relatively
small sample size is a key limitation of the studies conducted thus
far. The limitation of small sample size in individual studies,
however, can be compensated to some extent by meta-analysis.
Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that
investigated the prognostic value of pretreatment serum LDH
level in MM.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Search and filtration strategy
A systematic literature search was performed in the electronic
databases, PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science, to
retrieve relevant clinical studies published up to April 3, 2016.
The key words used were: [“mesothelioma∗” or “celothe-
lioma” or “mesothelial neoplasm∗”] and [“L-Lactate dehydro-
genase” or “lactate dehydrogenase” or “LDH”]. Reference lists
of the included studies were manually screened to increase the
yield of potential studies. This meta-analysis is reported in
accordance with the preferred reporting items for PRISMA
statement.[22]
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The eligibility criteria for inclusion were: studies that included
patients with pathological confirmation of malignant mesotheli-
oma; patients underwent surgical resection, chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or combination therapies; study
design: retrospective or prospective design; full text available in
English; investigated the association between pretreatment serum
LDH level and survival outcomes; data on hazard ratios (HRs)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or a P value for overall
survival (OS) reported.
Exclusion criteria were: case reports, letters, review articles, or
meeting records; non-English language publications; studies had
duplicate data or overlapping patients; sufficient data not
available to estimate HRs and their 95% CIs.
2.3. Data extraction
Data from eligible articles were independently extracted after a
review of full texts by 2 investigators using a standardized form.
Any doubts pertaining to eligibility of a study for inclusion were
resolved in consultation with a third independent senior
oncologist.
Data on following
variables of
interest
were
extracted: first author’s name, publication year, sample size,
study design (prospective or retrospective), follow-up time, cut-
off value of pretreatment LDH, survival analysis method
(multivariate or univariate), and HRs associated with their
95% CIs for OS. In case both multivariate and univariate
outcomes were provided, multivariate proportional hazards
models that adjusted for major clinical factors were preferred in
statistical analysis. If multivariate results were not available, the
univariate results were used instead.
2.4. Quality assessment
Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for quality assessment
of the included studies performed by 2 independent reviewers.[23]
The 3 aspects of NOS criteria were: selection of cases and controls
0 to 4, comparability of subjects 0 to 2, outcome or exposure 0 to
3. Quality scores ranged from 0 to 9, and previous studies with
scores ≥6 were deemed to be of ““good quality.”
2.5. Ethical statement
This article does not contain any studies with human participants
or animals performed by any of the authors.
2.6. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 12.0
software (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). HRs and their
95% CIs were used to calculate overall effects [STATA command
line: metan hr ll ul, label (namevar=author, yearvar=year) wgt
(sample size)]. Heterogeneity among included studies was
evaluated using Cochran Q and I2 statistics test. The value of
I2 ranges from 0% to 100%. I2 > 50% or P<0.05 was
considered indicative of significant heterogeneity, and random
effects model was employed to calculate pooled HRs and their
95% CI. I2 �50% or P>0.05 was considered indicative of a lack
of significant heterogeneity, and fixed effects model was
employed for statistical analysis.[24] Sensitivity and meta-
regression analyses were performed to identify the source of
heterogeneity, if applicable [STATA command lines: metaninf hr
ll ul, label(namevar=author, yearvar=year) random, and metareg
lnhr covariate, wsse(selnhr) bsest(reml)]. Publication year, age of
patients, disease site, LDH cut-off value, study type, and variable
type were considered potential confounding factors. Publication
bias was graphically assessed by visual inspection of Begg funnel
plot and the possibility of publication bias was tested by Egger
test[25] [STATA command line: metabias hr ll ul, ci graph(begg)
gweight]. Conventionally, HR >1 and its 95% CI did not overlap
1 indicated that the elevated LDH level was an adverse prognostic
factor for overall survival. A 2-sided P value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Study characteristics
A total of 196 articles were identified on initial search in
electronic databases. Titles and abstracts of all potentially
relevant studies were screened for eligibility. One hundred
seventy-eight articles were eliminated because of either being
duplicate records, or not relevant or owing to nonavailability of
full text. After review of original data and full texts of the
remaining 18 studies, another 9 were also excluded because of
lack of sufficient data to estimate the overall effect. Finally, 9
eligible studies with a combined study population of 1977
patients were included in the meta-analysis. A schematic
illustration of the selection criteria is shown in Fig. 1. The
summary of the main characteristics of eligible studies is
presented in Table 1. The majority of the eligible studies were
adjusted for major prognostic factors using the multivariate
proportional hazard model. Univariate outcomes were acquired

 when no multivariate outcomes were available. Hereinto, 4
studies reported the negative results, while the rest 5 studies
reported the positive results. In addition, the average quality
scores for included studies, as assessed by 2 independent
reviewers, were 6.7 and 6.8, which indicates a “good” quality
of all studies included in the current meta-analysis.
3.2. Overall survival
Elevated LDH levels predicted an adverse prognosis for OS with a
pooled HR of 1.68 (95% CI=1.36–2.00, I2=54.1%, P=0.026)
using the random-effect model (Fig. 2).
3.3. Heterogeneity analysis
As significant heterogeneity was observed, sensitivity analysis,
meta-regression model, and subgroup analysis were applied to
trace its origin. On sensitivity analysis, the pooled overall effects
were found to be stable after sequential exclusion of studies one at
a time (Fig. 3). Next, a univariate meta-regression analysis
comprising 6 confounding factors was conducted. In aggregate,
no significant association was observed among age, publication
year, disease site, LDH cut-off value, type of study, variable type,
and the HR for OS (P=0.168, 0.327, 0.590, 0.282, 0.486, and
0.785 respectively). Subsequently, the subgroup analysis was
conducted to trace the origin of heterogeneity. The results are
summarized in Table 2. Intriguingly, in each subgroup of 5
confounding factors, there always exists a pooled hazard ratio
with no heterogeneity (I2=0.0%). In the further analysis of the
results in Table 2, it was found that the publication of Nojiri et al
was the origin of heterogeneity. When omitted the publication of
Nojiri et al, the pooled HR of the rest 8 studies was 1.83 (95%
CI=1.45–2.20, I2=0.0%, P=0.723) using the fixed effects
model (Fig. 4).
3.4. Publication bias
No obvious asymmetry was observed in the Begg funnel plot
(Fig. 5), and no significant publication bias was observed to affect
the association of elevated LDH levels with OS on Egger test (P=
0.832).
4. Discussion
To date, only TNM stage system, pathological subtype, and
performance status have been consistently identified as prognos-
tic factors of MM in clinical practice.[1] However, the above-
mentioned factors are not enough to guide individualized
treatment. Biological behavior of tumor essentially differs from
that of normal cells, including the metabolic pathways.[6] Cancer
cells generate ATP mainly through anaerobic glycolysis. LDH as
a hypoxia-regulator plays a vital role in anaerobic glycolysis.[7]
The relevance of serum LDH level as a cheap and convenient
prognostic factor in patients with MM has been investigated.
However, the results have largely been inconsistent. The conflict
may result from the relatively small sample size and different
follow-up periods. It is generally acknowledged that meta-
analysis is a powerful statistic tool to overcome the limitation of
different sample sizes by combining results from several
individual studies to generate the best assessment. Therefore,
we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the prognostic value of
LDH in MM. Finally,9 studies (N=1977 patients) were included
in the meta-analysis. High pretreatment LDH levels indicated a
worse OS in patients with MM. Sensitivity analysis revealed that

 the pooled HR is stable when excluded any individual study each
time. Furthermore, 6 confounding factors comprising “age,”
“publication year,” “disease site,” “LDH cut-off value,” “type of
study,” and “variable type” were performed in meta-regression
analysis; however, no significant association was observed.
Intriguingly, when omitted the publication of Nojiri et al, no
heterogeneity was observed in the rest 8 studies.
A meta-analysis by Chen et al[26] also found elevated LDH to
have an adverse impact on OS in patients with osteosarcoma
(combined HR: 1.92 [95% CI: 1.53–2.40]). Similar findings were
reported in the context of solid tumors from a systematic review
by Zhang et al[27] (N=29,620 patients). These findings suggest
that serum LDH could be employed as a prognostic factor for
overall survival. However, further investigations are needed to
explore the mechanism of LDH and poor prognosis.
As compared with normal cells, cancer cells consume glucose
avidly and produce abundant lactic acid rather than catabolise
glucose via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which is the key
pathway for the generation of ATP under normoxic conditions.[6]
In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is not preferentially
metabolized by TCA cycle but is converted into lactic acid by
lactate dehydrogenase.[7] The linkage between high LDH levels
and poor prognosis could be explained by several hypotheses.
First, the production of lactate acid could be up-regulated by the
increased level of LDH which could result in the lower PH in the
extracellular space.[28,29] Acidic extracellular pH has been shown
to enhance activation of metalloproteases to facilitate the
decomposition of extracellular matrix and enhance the activation
of macrophage-mediated angiogenesis.[30,31] Furthermore, lower
PH may serve to protect mitochondria from oxidative stress,
which induces resistance to hypoxia-induced apoptosis of tumor
cells.[32]
Thus,
up-regulation
of
LDH
may
facilitate
the
invasiveness and resistance of tumor cell to apoptosis. Second,
a strong correlation between LDH-5, one of the main isoenzymes
of LDH, with the expression of HIFas and VEGF is well
documented. Thus, elevated LDH levels may reflect HIF-
dependent tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness.[33,34] In
addition, Kolev et al[35] reported a negative association between
LDH-5 and lymphocytic infiltration at the tumor edge, indicating
that elevated LDH levels may indicate an up-regulation of HIF-
molecular pathway, attenuation of host immunologic function,

 and enhanced tumor angiogenesis, which have an adverse impact
on prognosis in malignant tumors.
A strength of the current study is a relatively large combined
study population (N=1977) from a total of 9 studies used for the
calculation of the overall effect. The adverse prognostic effect of
elevated LDH levels on OS was unequivocal. Our findings build
on the previous studies that have indicated LDH as a potential
therapeutic target. Recently, Le et al[36] reported that inhibition
of LDH-A inhibited tumor progression and induced apoptosis via
accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lymphoma
cells. Zhai et al[37] also demonstrated that oxamate (LDH-
inhibitor) reduced ATP levels and enhanced radiation sensitivity
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Hence, inhibition of LDH appears
to be a promising prospect for individualized treatment of
cancers. Second, several studies have revealed that serum LDH
level could be a reflection of tumor burden and invasiveness,[33,34]
which is consistent with the use of LDH level as an appropriate
indicator of survival outcomes. To our knowledge, no present
study has employed dynamic LDH levels to monitor therapeutic
effects or survival outcome in MM; hence, it is necessary to
conduct several investigations to comprehensively explore the
value of serum LDH level in prognosis.

 Some limitations of the current meta-analysis need to be
acknowledged. First, significant heterogeneity was observed in all
included studies (I2=54.1%, P=0.026). When utilizing sensitiv-
ity analysis and meta-regression analysis, the origin of heteroge-
neity could not be fully identified. However, in the subgroup
analysis, the publication of Nojiri et al was found to be the origin
of heterogeneity. When omitted the publication of Nojiri et al, the
pooled HR of the rest 8 studies was 1.83 (95% CI=1.45–2.20,
I2=0.0%, P=0.723), suggesting that the pooled HR of the rest 8
studies was more homogeneous and reliable. Second, there were
only 9 publications with a total of 1977 MM patients in current
meta-analysis. The relatively modest sample size may unavoid-
ably increase the risk of bias and lower the statistic power in
current meta-analysis. Hence, further investigations with larger
sample size are needed to improve the statistic power and achieve
more meaningful results. Third, the publication dates of studies
included in our meta-analysis spanned from 1998 to 2015. The
therapeutic strategy in recent years may differ from what they
were 5 years ago. Fourth, selection bias may be caused by the
language restriction of English. Fifth, univariate and multivariate
types were both used in the calculation of HR for OS. Univariate
analysis is known to overestimate the effect size. Sixth, the cut-off
values of LDH used in the included studies were inconsistent; it is
important to standardize the LDH cut-off value in future studies.
Seventh, the reliability of the results of prospective and
retrospective studies selected in our study is lower than that of
prospective randomized trials.
In conclusion, a negative association between high serum LDH
level and poor survival outcome in malignant mesothelioma was
observed in current meta-analysis. As a convenient and cost-
effective indicator, serum LDH may be useful in clinical practice.
Further prospective randomized trials with standardized LDH
cut-off values are warranted to improve statistical power of
future analysis.
