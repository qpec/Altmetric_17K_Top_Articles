In Brief
Tagami et al. show that semagacestat
and some other potential g-secretase
inhibitors, which were unsuccessful in
clinical trials of Alzheimer’s disease and
various types of cancer, surprisingly do
not inhibit g-secretase activity. Therefore,
the outcomes of the Alzheimer’s disease
of these clinical trials do not compromise
the Ab hypothesis.

SUMMARY
g-secretase inhibitors (GSI) are drugs developed to
decrease amyloid-b peptide (Ab) production by in-
hibiting intramembranous cleavage of b-amyloid
protein precursor (bAPP). However, a large phase 3
trial of semagacestat, a potential non-transition state
analog (non-TSA) GSI, in patients with Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) was terminated due to unexpected
aggravation of cognitive deficits and side effects.
Here, we show that some semagacestat effects are
clearly different from a phenotype caused by a loss
of function of presenilins, core proteins in the g-sec-
retase complex. Semagacestat increases intracel-
lular byproduct peptides, produced along with Ab
through serial g-cleavage of bAPP, as well as intra-
cellular long Ab species, in cell-based and in vivo
studies of AD model mice. Other potential non-TSA
GSIs, but not L685,458, a TSA GSI, have similar
effects. Furthermore, semagacestat inhibits release
of de novo intramembranous g-byproducts to the
soluble space. Thus, semagacestat is a pseudo-
GSI, and therefore, the semagacestat clinical trial
did not truly test the Ab hypothesis.
INTRODUCTION
As amyloid-b peptide (Ab) accumulation in the brain starts in the
very early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology (Bate-
man et al., 2012; Glenner and Wong, 1984), many anti-Ab strate-
gies have been developed to modify the course of the disease
(Selkoe, 2013). One such strategy is to inhibit Ab production
(De Strooper, 2014). Ab generation is based on the activity of
presenilin/g-secretase (PS/g-secretase), which mediates the
cellular production of Ab (De Strooper et al., 1998; Wolfe et al.,
1999) from its immediate substrate, b-amyloid protein precursor
(bAPP)-CTFb (C-terminal fragment of bAPP by BACE cleavage)
(De Strooper et al., 1998; Haass, 2004; Selkoe, 2001; Wolfe
et al., 1999). g-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are compounds that
inhibit the proteolytic function of PS/g-secretase (Seiffert et al.,
2000; Shearman et al., 2000), and many potential non-transition
state analog (non-TSA) GSIs have been developed, using inhibi-
tion of Ab secretion as the major indicator.
Semagacestat is a potential non-TSA GSI and was used in
clinical trials on AD patients (https://clinicaltrials.gov). However,
all the GSI trials for AD, including that of semagacestat, have
been unsuccessful (Selkoe, 2012). Particularly, semagacestat
and another potential GSI, avagacestat, even caused unex-
pected aggravation of cognitive decline, which is the exact
opposite effect to that expected of the compounds (Coric
et al., 2012; Doody et al., 2013). As a result, researchers
have started to argue against the effectiveness of lowering
brain Ab levels as a therapy for AD (Blennow et al., 2013;
Extance, 2010; Karran and Hardy, 2014). Thus, current argu-
ments based on the aforementioned trial failures have tended
to be against the continuation of AD clinical trials based on
the Ab hypothesis.
The unexpected aggravation of cognitive decline in patients of
the phase 3 trial of semagacestat prompted us to thoroughly re-
examine the action of these compounds. To this purpose, we
focused on intracellular Ab, and, more importantly, the small
bAPP-derived peptides produced along with Ab (Okochi et al.,
2013; Takami et al., 2009). bAPP-CTF stubs primarily undergo
endoproteolysis by PS/g-secretase at the ε-cleavage sites
located near the transmembrane-cytoplasmic border of the sub-
strate (Gu et al., 2001; Sastre et al., 2001; Weidemann et al.,
2002). PS/g-secretase sequentially cleaves the resultant mem-
brane-bound long Ab (i.e., Ab48 and Ab49) every three to five
amino acid residues starting at the C terminus (Okochi et al.,
2013; Takami et al., 2009), thus generating secreted forms of
Ab, such as Ab40, Ab42, and Ab43, which are no longer neces-
sarily bound to the membrane (Okochi et al., 2013; Takami

 et al., 2009). By quantification of the small residual peptides
generated during sequential cleavages upon Ab production,
we aimed to address the effects of semagacestat on PS/g-
secretase.
RESULTS
Intracellular Ab in Human Neuronal Cells Did Not
Decrease but Rather Increased due to Semagacestat
We established human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
lines from fibroblasts of a healthy 40-year-old woman without
any pathological AD mutations (Experimental Procedures)
and also purchased another set of human iPSCs from GIBCO.
To provide relevance to the situation in the human brain, we
differentiated these iPSCs (Takahashi et al., 2007) to neuronal
cells (Eiraku et al., 2008) and obtained human cortical neurons
(Experimental Procedures; Figure 1A). Based on the highest
semagacestat concentration in human cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) reported in a phase 1 clinical trial (0.90 ± 0.23 mM; Bate-
man et al., 2009), we treated the neuronal cells with 2 mM sem-
agacestat (Figure S1A; IC50 values of semagacestat used in
this study in Ab secretion in cell culture and an in vitro g-sec-
retase assay are shown in Figures S1B and S1C, respectively).
As expected, semagacestat treatment caused decreased Ab
secretion (Figure 1B) and accumulation of bAPP-CTF stubs
(Figures 1C and 1D) in the neuronal cells. These features due
to semagacestat are consistent with those by a loss of function
of PSs (see below).
However, given previous results (Qi-Takahara et al., 2005;
Yagishita et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2005) showing that some po-
tential GSIs, including N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-
S-phenylglycine t-butyl Ester (DAPT), increase the amounts of
long intracellular Ab species in bAPP-overexpressing cultured
cells for unclear reasons when used at particular concentra-
tions, we subsequently tried to detect intracellular Ab in our
cells. We found that the intracellular levels of Ab peptides
following
semagacestat
treatment
were
increased
in
the
neuronal cells (Figure 1C). Tricine-urea gel electrophoresis
showed the intracellular accumulation of various Ab species
(Figures 1D and S1D). Semagacestat induced intracellular Ab
accumulation also in naive SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Fig-
ure S1E) and in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells express-
ing the Swedish (sw) AD mutant of bAPP (sw bAPP/HEK cells;
see below; also Figures 3B and 3C). Thus, 2 mM semagacestat
did not decrease but rather increased intracellular Ab in the
cultured cells, including human neuronal cells. In contrast,
these intracellular Ab species disappeared when we deleted
both PS1 and PS2 expression in the sw bAPP/HEK cells (sw
bAPP/HEK-DPS1/2 clone 2411 cells; see below; Figures 2B
and S2C). Thus, the intracellular Ab phenotype due to semaga-
cestat is quite opposite to that caused by loss of function of
PSs (see below).

However, when using human neuronal cells, a 1-hr
incubation was insufficient for observing a good
enough size of the effect on Ab secretion in the
medium (see also Figure 3A), although it is suffi-
cient for observing the effects on intracellular
g-byproducts (see below).
(C) Ab in the neuronal cells treated with or without
semagacestat for 1 hr was immunoprecipitated
(using 4G8) and then separated on a 10%–20%

ECL-prime
chem-
iluminescence was used to detect the bands (using
82E1). In each lane, 2.6 mg of cell lysate protein
were used for immunoprecipitation. By a simple
assessment method (Figures S1F and S1G), it was found that neuronal cells contained 10 ± 3.2 fmol/dish or 2.3 ± 2.1 fmol/dish of total Ab, upon treatment with or
without semagacestat, respectively.
(D) Immunoprecipitated Ab species from cells treated with or without semagacestat for 1 hr used in (C) were separated on a Tris-tricine 8 M urea gel-1 (Qi-

fmol/dish of Ab45+Ab46. The asterisk indicates bAPP-CTF derivatives other than Ab species (see Figure S2C). Note that Ab47–49 species were undetectable on
Tris-tricine 8 M urea gel-2 analysis (Figure S1D).

 Small Intracellular Peptides (g-Byproducts) Are
Generated from bAPP through the Action of PS/
g-Secretase in sw bAPP/HEK Cells
To further investigate the effects of semagacestat on PS/g-sec-
retase in living cells, we measured the small intracellular byprod-
uct peptides released during Ab production in cells (Figure 2)
with or without semagacestat treatment (Figures 3 and 4). In
this study, we refer to the small peptides as the g-byproducts.
All of the theoretical small peptides of 3 to 5 amino acid residues
from the transmembrane domain of bAPP (between the ε- and
g-cleavage sites) that we sought to measure in this study are
shown in Figure 2A.
We first tried to dispel the suspicion that the g-byproducts that
we had previously identified in cells (Okochi et al., 2013) do not
arise from the proteolysis of bAPP by PS/g-secretase (Figure 2).
For this purpose, we prepared untransfected HEK293 cells,
HEK293 cells with stable expression of sw bAPP (sw bAPP/
HEK), and sw bAPP/HEK cells with genomic deletion of both
the PS1 and PS2 genes (sw bAPP/DPS1/2/HEK). To measure
the small peptides in the cell lysates, the cells were heat inacti-
vated and the peptides were purified by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), followed by measurement using liquid
chromatography-tandem
mass
spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS)
(Experimental Procedures). As shown in Figures 2D and 2E, we
observed more than ten peptides, including ITL, VIV, IAT, VIT,
TVI, VVIA, and VVIAT. For technical reasons, we only show the
levels of the peptides for which we repeatedly observed well-
shaped MS peaks with stable values in each set of experiments.

(A) Theoretical small bAPP-derived peptides of 3 to 6 amino acid residues, which we measured in this study. The g-byproducts are derived from serial g-cleavage
between the g- and ε-sites (arrowheads) of bAPP. Cleavage starts at the ε-sites (Takami et al., 2009), and cleavage at the g-sites eventually releases Ab from the
membrane.
(B) Direct immunoblotting (for PS1/2, bAPP, and b-actin) and immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (for Ab) analysis of HEK cells with or without the stable
expression of exogenous sw bAPP or endogenous PS1/2. Exogenous sw bAPP expression increased the bAPP-holo protein, bAPP-CTF stubs, and Ab. Deletion
of PS1/2 in sw bAPP/HEK cells further increased bAPP-CTF but led to the elimination of both intracellular and extracellular Ab.

(fmol/dish) in sw bAPP/HEK cells (values of the y axis) in (D) and (E) differed, because the total number of cells in the dishes could not be made exactly equal in
each set of experiments.

g-byproducts in bAPP KO MEFs. However, the level of intracellular VVI peptide in bAPP KO MEFs was increased by semagacestat. Combined with (A) and (B), the
data suggest that VVI can be produced by PS/g-secretase cleavage of the transmembrane domain of any of its substrates other than bAPP that is endogenously
expressed in the tested cells (i.e., MEF, HEK, and human neuronal cells).

Cell Reports 21, 259–273, October 3, 2017
 We then deleted both the PS1 and PS2 genes in the sw bAPP/
HEK cells using CRISPR CAS9 genome editing technology (Fig-
ures S2A–S2F; Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013; Mashiko et al.,
2013). Importantly, extracellular and intracellular Ab and amyloid
protein precursor intracellular cytoplasmic domain (AICD) could
not be detected in the PS1/2-double KO cells (Figures 2B, 2C,
S2C, and S2E), and the levels of nine small peptides inside the
cells, namely ITL, VIV, IAT, GVV, IVIT, VIT, TVI, VVIA, and VVIAT,
were drastically decreased (Figure 2D; see also Figure S2F).
Therefore, these small peptides are g-byproducts, in that their
generation is PS dependent (see also Figures S2G–S2I). More-
over, the levels of these g-byproducts in untransfected HEK
cells were much lower than in cells overexpressing sw bAPP
(i.e., sw bAPP/HEK; Figure 2E). These data indicate that the sub-
strate used to generate the g-byproducts in sw bAPP/HEK cells
is mostly overexpressed sw bAPP and that the g-byproducts in
the cells that we analyzed are mostly derived from serial g-cleav-
age in the cells. Collectively, the phenotype of a loss of function
of PSs that was apparent in our experiments includes (1) lack of
extracellular Ab secretion, (2) lack of intracellular Ab, (3) drastical
decrease of intracellular g-byproducts, (4) lack of intracellular
AICD, and (5) accumulation of intracellular bAPP-CTF stubs.
To further determine whether the g-byproducts remained in-
side the cells, we assayed the conditioned medium of the sw
bAPP/HEK cells in a similar fashion (Figure S2J; Supplemental
Experimental Procedures).The g-byproducts werehardlydetect-
able in the medium, indicating that they remained inside the cells.
Semagacestat Does Not Inhibit but Increases the Levels
of g-Byproducts
We tested whether semagacestat causes the same effects as a
loss of function of PSs on intramembrane cleavages of bAPP.
We treated sw bAPP/HEK cells with 2 mM of semagacestat. Under
our
experimental
conditions,
semagacestat,
as
expected,
decreased Ab secretion into the conditioned medium (Figure 3A,
middlelanes,andS3A),decreasedintracellularAICD(FigureS3B),
and increased intracellular bAPP-CTF stubs (Figures 3B and 3C).
Surprisingly, however, we found that semagacestat added
to the cells did not decrease but rather increased the major g-by-
product peptides, such as IAT, VIV, and ITL tripeptides within the
cells, in a wide range of concentrations (�10 nM to �10 mM; Fig-
ures 3D and S3C). In contrast, deletion of both PS1 and PS2
genes in the sw bAPP/HEK cells almost abolished all the g-by-
product peptides in the cells (Figure 3E). In addition, semagace-
stat also caused accumulation of intracellular Ab (Figure 3B),
especially long Ab species, such as Ab43 and Ab46 (Figure 3C),
in the sw bAPP/HEK cells. Thus, the phenotype due to semaga-
cestat concerning the major g-byproducts, as well as the intra-
cellular long Ab species, is clearly different from that caused by
a loss of function of PSs.
Moreover, in the PS-deleted sw bAPP/HEK cells, no increase
was observed in the cellular g-byproducts upon semagacestat
treatment (Figure 3F). HEK cells overexpressing a proteolytically
dead PS1 mutant (Wolfe et al., 1999; i.e., PS1 D385N;
Figure S3D) also failed to show an increase in the amount of
g-byproducts by semagacestat (Figure S3E). Therefore, the
data indicate that semagacestat induces an increase in the levels
of g-byproducts by acting on PSs.
Even in cultured cells without exogenous bAPP expression
(mouse embryonic fibroblasts [MEFs] [Figure 4A], HEK [Fig-
ure S4A], and SH-SY5Y [Figure S4B] cells), semagacestat
uniformly increased the amount of the g-byproducts. To test
whether the deletion of PSs or bAPP gene in untransfected
cultured cells also abolishes these unexpected effects of sema-
gacestat, we performed similar experiments using MEFs as the
host cells. We treated PS1 and PS2 double knockout (KO) (Her-
reman et al., 2000) or bAPP KO MEFs with semagacestat. An
increase of g-byproducts by semagacestat did not occur in
MEFs genetically lacking both PS1 and PS2 (Figure 4B) or
bAPP (Figure 4C).
We finally treated our differentiated human neuronal cells (IP-1
clone 2) with 2 mM semagacestat and measured the cellular
g-byproducts. As in the experiments described above, we found
that
semagacestat
added
to
human
neuronal
cells
also
increased the amount of the major g-byproducts within the cells
(Figure 4D). Similar results were obtained using neuronal cells
differentiated from iPSCs of different origin (IP-1 clone 5 and
iPSCs from GIBCO; Figures S4C and S4D). To summarize,
although a loss of function of PSs abolishes the g-byproduct
peptides in the cultured cells, semagacestat causes increase
in g-byproducts by acting on PS function. All the above data sug-
gest that the actions of semagacestat appear similar but are in
fact quite different from the inhibition of PS/g-secretase function.
Semagacestat Retards Release of g-Byproducts from
Membrane to Soluble Space
PS/g-secretase activity in cells can be estimated by the in vitro
g-secretase reconstitution assay, in which affinity-purified
PS/g-secretase complexes (the enzyme) from the cells and puri-
fied bAPP-CTFb (the substrate) are mixed and subsequently
incubated (Li et al., 2000). The addition of a potential GSI, such
as semagacestat, generally decreases de novo Ab generation
in the reconstitution assay. This effect is considered to be a
part of the current definition of GSIs and is a major reason why
researchers have inferred that semagacestat inhibits PS/g-sec-
retase activity. Accordingly, we tried to confirm whether sema-
gacestat decreases g-byproducts using the in vitro g-secretase
reconstitution assay (Figure 5A). Consistent with previous results
(Gitter et al., 2004), the addition of a high concentration of sem-
agacestat (10 mM) just before incubation almost abolished the
generation of g-byproducts (Figure 5A).
Also, in an established cell-free g-secretase assay in which
crude membrane fraction was incubated (Pinnix et al., 2001;
Fukumori et al., 2006), we found that addition of 10 mM

(E) Relative levels of de novo peptides in membrane fraction (membrane) or in supernatant fraction (soluble) after the cell-free assay with or without semagacestat

 semagacestat just before incubation decreased the g-byprod-
ucts (Figure 5B). However, about half of g-byproduct production
remained even under treatment with this high concentration of
semagacestat. Moreover, the g-byproducts did not decrease
in a cell-free g-secretase assay using crude membrane fraction
extracted from semagacestat-pretreated cells (Figure 5C).
Thus, the effects of semagacestat on the generation of g-by-
products depend on the types of assays (Figures 5A and 5B)
and on the timing of semagacestat addition, either to living cells
(Figure 5C) or to extracted crude membrane (Figure 5B).
We then tried to address why the effect sizes of semagacestat
differ in the various assay conditions. One of the major
differences of the two types of the cleavage assays is that, in
the cell-free assay, we observed the activity of g-secretase
embedded in cellular membrane, whereas, in the in vitro assay,
we observed the activity of purified g-secretase with minimum
membrane component, because the CHAPSO-solubilized mem-
brane fraction is removed from this assay. We, therefore, sepa-
rated the solution including the crude membrane fraction after
the cell-free incubation into membrane and soluble fractions.
We analyzed the distribution of de novo g-byproducts after the
cell-free incubation (Figures 5D and 5E) and found that a major
part of de novo g-byproducts was normally collected in the
soluble fraction without semagacestat treatment (blue bars).
When semagacestat was added just before the incubation (red
bars in Figure 5D), de novo g-byproducts in the soluble fraction
were strongly suppressed. In contrast, the majority of de novo
g-byproducts were collected in the membrane fraction by sem-
agacestat treatment (red hatched bars in Figure 5D). Thus, the
g-byproducts observed in the cell-free assay upon semagace-
stat treatment in Figure 5B were those which remained in the in-
tramembranous space. Moreover, in the cell-free assay using
crude membrane fraction obtained from semagacestat pre-
treated cells (see Figure 5C), a major part of de novo g-byprod-
ucts produced was again found in the membrane fraction upon
semagacestat treatment (red hatched bars in Figure 5E). These
results collectively suggest that semagacestat retards the
release of g-byproducts from the membrane to the soluble

Semagacestat Caused Both Major g-Byproducts and
Ab46 Increase in PS1 I213T Knockin Mice
Overexpressing Sw bAPP
To reproduce the pseudo-GSI effects (that is, the increased
g-byproducts and intracellular Ab) of semagacestat in vivo, we
used 8-week-old transgenic mice, which do not have mouse-
amyloid plaques yet. After a total of 3 oral administrations of
semagacestat (30 mg/kg; see details in Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures), we sacrificed the mice and analyzed the
brains. First, we performed immunoprecipitation-immunoblot-
ting analysis using antibodies against the Ab region. Short-expo-
sure images (left panels in Figure 6A) detected Ab40 and Ab42
and accumulation of bAPP-CTF stubs in the brains of mice
treated with semagacestat. Long-exposure images (right panels
in Figure 6A) showed accumulation of Ab46 by semagacestat,
which was reminiscent of its effects on cultured cells. Second,
we measured the levels of g-byproducts (Figure 6B). We found
an increase of major g-byproducts VIV and ITL by semagacestat,
which is also reminiscent of its effects on cultured cells. These
results indicate that an increase of both long Ab and major g-by-
products occurred in the mouse brain due to orally administered
semagacestat.
Other Clinically Tested Potential Non-TSA Inhibitors
Also Increase the Levels of g-Byproducts and
Intracellular Ab
To address whether these pseudo-GSI actions are specific to
semagacestat, we further studied the effects of three other po-
tential GSIs that have been tested in clinical trials. Each of the
compounds was added to the human neuronal cells at concen-
trations reported to be sufficient to inhibit Ab secretion, i.e.,
2.5 mM of RO4929097 (Strosberg et al., 2012; IC50, 14 nM),
1 mM of MK-0752 (Fouladi et al., 2011; IC50, 5 nM), and 60 nM
of avagacestat (Coric et al., 2012; IC50, 0.3 nM; Figure S6), and
the cells were incubated for 1 hr. We observed decreased Ab
secretion (Figure 7A) and accumulation of bAPP-CTF stubs (Fig-
ure 7B). We also confirmed that all three compounds decreased
AICD in the sw bAPP/HEK cells (Figure S3B). Importantly, we
found that the three compounds increased the generation of
some of the major g-byproducts and intracellular long Ab spe-
cies within the human neuronal cells (Figures 7B and 7C).
Thus, very similarly to semagacestat, the phenotype caused by
the action of these compounds was distinct from that caused
by a loss of function of PSs.
The TSA Inhibitor L685,458 Decreases Both the Levels
of g-Byproducts and Intracellular Ab Species
In a final experiment, we investigated whether a TSA GSI also in-
creases both the g-byproducts and intracellular Ab by testing
L685,458. Interestingly, under the same conditions in which
semagacestat increased the levels of g-byproducts, L685,458
decreased them (Figure 7D). Furthermore, L685,458 decreased
intracellular Ab in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7E). Thus,
L685,458 in the cultured cells indeed fulfills a PS loss of function
phenotype, that is, (1) lack of extracellular Ab secretion, (2) intra-
cellular Ab, (3) intracellular g-byproducts, and (4) intracellular
AICD (Figure S3B), along with (5) accumulation of intracellular
bAPP-CTF stubs. Therefore, L685,458 is a true GSI in the current
experimental conditions, whereas many non-TSA-type inhibitors
that we tested here are not.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated seemingly contradictory actions
of semagacestat. We showed that semagacestat does not inhibit
but increases the levels of intracellular g-byproducts and Ab.
However, it decreases the levels of extracellular Ab and intracel-
lular AICD and increases bAPP-CTF stubs. These semagacestat
effects are clearly different from those caused by a loss of
function of PSs. It is of note that L685,458, a TSA GSI, so far
acts equivalently to a loss of function of PSs. Therefore, we
concluded that semagacestat is a pseudo-GSI. From a mecha-
nistic point of view, semagacestat inhibits the liberation of prod-
uct peptides by g-secretase (g-byproducts) from the membrane
to the soluble space, which perhaps causes g-byproducts to
accumulate in living cells. Hence, it is questionable whether
266
Cell Reports 21, 259–273, October 3, 2017
 the clinical trials of semagacestat truly tested the Ab hypothesis.
We believe that a full reconsideration of g-secretase activity
will open avenues toward the clinical application of g-secre-
tase-modulating compounds (true GSIs, g-secretase modula-
tors, etc.).
Unexpected Mode of Action of Semagacestat and the
Failure of a Large Phase 3 Semagacestat Clinical Trial
In the clinical trials of semagacestat and avagacestat for AD
(Bateman et al., 2009; Doody et al., 2013; Fleisher et al., 2008;
Siemers et al., 2005, 2006), an unexpected aggravation of cogni-
tive decline was observed in the patients. Previous reports have
indicated that this is difficult to explain, even considering the
possible interference of Notch signaling in the brain or the accu-
mulation of substrates of PS/g-secretase, such as bAPP-CTF
stubs (Coric et al., 2012; Doody et al., 2013). As a result, not
only treatment strategies using GSIs but also the main Ab hy-
pothesis itself have recently come under severe criticism. In
our study, we showed that, separately from its inhibition of extra-
cellular Ab secretion, semagacestat causes the intracellular
accumulation of various Ab species and g-byproducts. It has
been shown that intraneuronal Ab accumulation in transgenic
mice expressing multiple familial AD mutations causes synaptic
dysfunction and neuronal loss (Oakley et al., 2006; Oddo et al.,
2003). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated enhanced Ab
accumulation in the brain of a patient who died after treatment
with a high dose of semagacestat for more than a year (Roher
et al., 2014). The surprising results of the pseudo-inhibitor effects
of semagacestat on PS/g-secretase shown in this study may
help explain this aggravation of cognitive decline in patients.
Therefore, the recent trend of criticizing the anti-Ab strategy
due to the unsuccessful results of clinical trials of GSIs (Blennow
et al., 2013; Extance, 2010; Karran and Hardy, 2014) may be
unfounded. On the contrary, we suggest that the discovery of
the mode of action of pseudo-GSIs in this study may support
the Ab hypothesis, because these compounds in fact cause an
increase in intracellular Ab.
We acknowledge that the complex effects on g-secretase ac-
tivity by semagacestat could not have been predicted in its
earlier stages of development, because the process of the serial
g-cleavage of bAPP was not known. Many potential g-secretase
inhibitors, such as RO4929097 (Strosberg et al., 2012), have
been used in 50 clinical trials of various kinds of cancers.
MK-0752 (Fouladi et al., 2011) and PF-03084014 (Lanz et al.,
2010) are being tested in clinical trials for their potential use as
anti-breast cancer and anti-desmoid tumor drugs, respectively
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/search), because the inhibition of
Notch signaling in cancer has been considered as a potential

 therapeutic strategy. It is extremely important to note that,
because RO4929097 and MK-0752 cause an increase in g-by-
products as well as intracellular Ab accumulation in a similar
manner to semagacestat (Figure 7), their risk of causing cogni-
tive decline cannot be excluded.
PS/g-Secretase Function as a Key Factor for the
Release of the Products from the Membrane
Based on the pseudo-GSI effects of semagacestat, we may be
able to deepen our understanding about the function of PS/
g-secretase. In the cell-free assay, semagacestat caused in-
crease of g-byproducts in the membrane fraction but a decrease
in the soluble fraction, indicating inhibition of their release to the
soluble fraction. The results indicate that the generation of g-by-
products and their release from the membrane do not always
occur in parallel. This observation leads us to consider that PS/
g-secretase function can be divided into two steps: the first
step is to serve as a protease in a hydrophobic membrane and
the second step is to serve as a catalytic molecule which does
not act as a protease, but which accelerates the process of
driving the products of the membrane fraction out into hydrophil-
ic space. We suggest that semagacestat may mainly affect the
second step of the function of PS/g-secretase. Compared with
PS/g-secretase in living cells or in a cell-free assay using crude
membrane fraction, affinity-purified PS/g-secretase is afforded
a much smaller intramembranous pool that carries the products
it cleaves, due to the removal of the CHAPSO-solubilized mem-
brane. Thus, the intramembranous pool of affinity-purified PS/
g-secretase treated with semagacestat may be easily saturated
due to the inhibition of the release of the products, which may
cause a secondary inhibition of the proteolytic activity. Further
studies are necessary, but semagacestat may increase intracel-
lular Ab by inhibiting the as yet hypothetical function of the PS/
g-secretase complex to release Ab from the membrane. These
membrane-bound Ab species are thought to stay within cells,
not to be secreted extracellularly like intravesicular Ab, which
is not anchored to the membrane.
A major limitation of this study is that it is difficult to fully under-
stand the relation between the complex effects of semagacestat,
that is, the increase in the levels of intracellular g-byproducts, Ab,
and bAPP-CTF stubs and the decrease in the levels of secreted
Ab and intracellular cytoplasmic domains (ICDs). Concerning the
accumulation of bAPP-CTF stubs and the decrease in ICDs, the
inhibition of the proteolytic activity of PS/g-secretase by sema-
gacestat in a whole cell might be a cause.
The intracellular Ab accumulation by semagacestat may have
been disregarded so far, because the overexpression of bAPP
increases a steady-state level of intracellular Ab40, which can
mask changes in intracellular total Ab due to semagacestat (Fig-
ures S1E and S1H). There were cases in which semagacestat did
not clearly increase the levels of intracellular Ab species upon the
artificial overexpression of bAPP. In an extreme example, in CHO
cells overexpressing bAPP (i.e., 7WD10 cells; Koo and Squazzo,
1994), we observed a decrease in intracellular Ab levels by sem-
agacestat (Figure S1H), whereas we again observed an increase
in g-byproducts within the cells (Figure S1I). It is possible that the
metabolism of intracellular Ab upon semagacestat treatment
may be different depending on the host cell type.
g-Byproducts as Alternative Indicators of PS/
g-Secretase Activity
To date, many researchers, including ourselves, have estimated
g-secretase activity in living cells by measuring secreted Ab.
However, it is known that using secreted Ab as an indicator of
PS/g-secretase activity is quite inaccurate, because only a part
of the de novo produced Ab is secreted, whereas the rest is
degraded intracellularly. Ab secretion is part of a multistep pro-
cess involving its generation via PS/g-secretase cleavage, liber-
ation from membrane to soluble space, intracellular trafficking,
and extracellular secretion. Hence, the amount of the final prod-
uct, i.e., secreted Ab, does not necessarily reflect the level of the
initial event, i.e., PS/g-secretase activity. Moreover, it is reason-
able to consider that the rate of Ab secretion may change de-
pending on subcellular conditions in the cells. However, we
have continued to make use of the level of secreted Ab as the
most reliable indicator of PS/g-secretase activity, because we
do not have any better alternatives. Our data demonstrate the
dissociation between the levels of PS/g-secretase cleavage
and the levels of secreted Ab. Our study provides evidence
that the inhibition of Ab secretion does not necessarily indicate
an inhibition of the proteolytic function of PS/g-secretase in living
cells. Intracellular de novo Ab is constantly consumed by

degradation products of bAPP-CTF stubs other than Ab species (see Figure S2C). In each lane, 2.4 mg of cell lysate protein was used for immunoprecipitation.
By a simple assessment method (Figures S1F and S1G), avagacestat-treated neuronal cells were shown to contain 0.59 ± 0.4 fmol/dish of Ab40, 3.1 ± 0.66 fmol/
dish of Ab42+Ab43, and 9.1 ± 3.2 fmol/dish of Ab45+Ab46. RO4979097-treated cells contained 0.72 ± 0.34 fmol/dish of Ab40, 4.8 ± 1.4 fmol/dish of Ab42+Ab43,
and 9.6 ± 2.3 fmol/dish of Ab45+Ab46. MK-0752-treated cells contained 5.2 ± 1.9 fmol/dish of Ab40, 5.0 ± 1.7 fmol/dish of Ab42+Ab43, and 11 ± 2.1 fmol/dish of
Ab45+Ab46.

82E1, 18580, and 18583, respectively. Using a simple assessment method (Figures S1F and S1G), without L685,458 treatment, the sw bAPP/HEK cells were
found to contain 8.7 ± 2.1 fmol/dish of Ab40, 2.8 ± 1.9 fmol/dish of Ab42+Ab43, and 2.2 ± 0.5 fmol/dish of Ab45+Ab46. The asterisk indicates degradation
products of bAPP-CTF stubs other than Ab species (see Figure S2C). In each lane, 1.2 mg of cell lysate protein was used for immunoprecipitation.

 degradation and secretion, whereas extracellular Ab is the sum
of secreted Ab for the whole incubation period. Thus, the sum
of the intracellular (at one point in time) and secreted Ab (the
whole incubation period) levels also does not directly corre-
spond to g-secretase activity. We suggest that, to estimate
cellular g-secretase activity by Ab levels, the total levels of
secreted Ab, intracellular Ab, and intracellularly degraded Ab at
a particular moment need to be measured and calculated. How-
ever, it is almost impossible to estimate how much intracellular
Ab is being degraded. Therefore, in the search for other indica-
tors of PS/g-secretase activity, we turned to the g-byproducts.
Compared with Ab, g-byproducts are not secreted and give us
more detailed results on PS/g-secretase cleavages, which occur
at around 10 sites.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All the experiments were repeated at least three times. All the antibodies and
cell lines that we raised are available upon request. For detailed descriptions of
these and additional procedures, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Materials
Semagacestat was purchased from two different sources (Selleck and Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). RO4929097, MK-0752, and avagacestat were pur-
chased from Selleck. Antibodies used for biochemical analysis and their
respective sources are as follows: anti-bAPP (22C11; Millipore); anti-PS1
(anti-PS1 loop domain [263–407]; Calbiochem); anti-PS2 (Cell Signaling Tech-
nology); anti-pan-Ab (4G8; Covance); anti-Ab N terminus (82E1; IBL); anti-
Ab40 C terminus (18580; IBL); anti-Ab43 C terminus (18583; IBL); anti-b-actin
(AC-15; Sigma); horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-rabbit immuno-
globulin G (IgG) (Promega); and HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Promega).
Antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were anti-b-III TUBULIN (Covance)
and anti-NESTIN (Covance), and the secondary antibodies were anti-mouse-
Alexa488 (Life Technologies) and anti-rabbit-Alexa555 (Cell Signal). Antiserum
(OB1195) against the C terminus of NICASTRIN (amino acids 693–709) conju-
gated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was raised by the method
described previously (Fukumori et al., 2006). Antiserum 6618 against the C ter-
minus of bAPP has been described previously (Fukumori et al., 2006).
Treatment of Cells and Mice with Chemical Compounds
Cells were cultured in 4 = 10 cm dishes with 6 mL of conditioned medium,
without specific indication. Semagacestat was used at a final concentration
of 2 mM, unless otherwise indicated. This concentration was chosen consid-
ering that the maximum semagacestat concentration in the CSF of patients
who were administered the maximum clinical trial dose of semagacestat
(280 mg/day) was approximately 1 mM (Bateman et al., 2009). Semagacestat
(30 mg/kg) was orally administered to double transgenic mice overexpressing
sw bAPP and expressing I213T mutant PS1 every 12 hr for 3 times, and 8 hr
after the last administration, the mice were sacrificed and their brains were
rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Specific experimental protocols are detailed
in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
ELISA
The levels of Ab species (Ab1-x and Ab1-40) were measured by ELISA accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions (IBL).
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were basically performed as
described previously (Okochi et al., 2013). Ab and bAPP-CTF bands were de-
tected by immunoblotting (using 82E1 for Ab1�X, 18580 for Ab40, and 18583
for Ab43) combined with immunoprecipitation (using 4G8). AICD band was
detected by immunoblotting combined with immunoprecipitation (using
6618; Fukumori et al., 2006). PS1/2, bAPP, and b-actin bands were detected
by direct immunoblotting. Tris-tricine 8 M urea gel 1 and 2, described previ-
ously (Qi-Takahara et al., 2005), were used to separate long Ab species. In
all other cases, 10%–20% gradient Tris-tricine gels (Life Technologies) were
used. To detect Ab, SDS-PAGE gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose mem-
branes. The membranes were then boiled in PBS for 10 min and subjected
to immunoblotting. PolyVinylidene DiFluoride (PVDF) membranes were used
for the rest of the proteins. The bands were visualized by chemiluminescence
(enhanced chemiluminescence [ECL] or ECL-prime).
In Vitro g-Secretase Reconstitution Assay and Cell-free g-Secretase
Assay
Affinity-purified PS/g-secretase from human neuronal cells was prepared. The
in vitro g-secretase reconstitution assay was performed according to a previ-
ously described method (Li et al., 2000), with slight modifications (Kakuda
et al., 2006). Specific experimental protocols are detailed in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures. For the cell-free g-secretase assay, crude mem-
brane fraction of sw bAPP/HEK cells was prepared (Fukumori et al., 2006).
Following addition of semagacestat, the membrane fraction was incubated
for 30 min. To distinguish membrane and soluble fraction from the resultant
assay solution, ultracentrifugation (100,000 g) for 1 hr at 4�C was performed.
Then, the levels of the small peptides in the resultant fraction were measured
as described below in ‘‘Measurement of the g-Byproducts in Cells’’.
Measurement of the g-Byproducts in Cells
Following removal of the conditioned medium, cultured cells with or without
compound treatment in 10-cm dishes were placed on ice and washed twice
with ice-cold PBS. Cells collected in ice-cold PBS were quickly boiled in a
heating block for 2 min, followed by addition of a protease inhibitor mixture
(Sigma) and 350 fmol of a standard peptide (i.e., the IVITL pentapeptide) for
monitoring the purification procedure. The IVITL pentapeptide was used
because it has never been detected in living cells. The boiled sample was son-
icated on ice (5 s 3 3 times), and ultracentrifuged (100,000 g) for 1 hr at 4�C.
The supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for
15 min and ultracentrifuged (100,000 g) for 1 hr at 4�C. The resultant superna-
tant was passed through filter papers (4 = 20 mm). The solution was then sepa-
rated by HPLC (Agilent 1100 Series HPLC System with YMC-Pack ODS-A
column 150 3 4.6 mm I.D. S-5 mm; 12 nm [YMC]) and saved as fractions con-
taining tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-peptides. The fractions were dried using
SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific) and stored in a deep freezer at �80�C. The small
peptides, including the g-byproducts in the samples, were measured using
LC-MS/MS (Quattro Premier XE tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer
equipped with ultra performance liquid chromatography [UPLC]; Waters) as
previously described (Okochi et al., 2013). Briefly, the HPLC-purified peptide
fraction from a culture dish (4 = 10 cm) was suspended in 40 mL of 0.05% for-
mic acid solution in 10% DMSO, containing the calibration FLF tri-peptide for
normalizing the signal intensity of each experiment. A fraction (5 mL) was used
for LC-MS/MS measurement of tri-peptides, and another fraction (5 mL) was
used for the tetra-, penta-, and hexa-peptides. The small peptides were
separated using a reversed-phase UPLC column (Waters PLC HSS T3;
2.1 mm 3 150 mm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0%–34.5%) for
25 min. For the effective separation of small peptides, the UPLC system
(Waters) is indispensable. For each small peptide, a set of 1.5, 3.1, 6.3, 12.5,
25, 50, and 100 fmol of synthetic peptide was used to prepare a calibration
curve for each set of measurements. Two different daughter ions resulting
from the degradation of each of the precursor ions were measured by multi-
ple-reaction monitoring. Suitable product ions were chosen for quantification
by measuring the peak area. Only the levels of the peptides calculated from
well-shaped MS peaks with stable values on repetitive measurements are
shown. The values are averages of at least 4 measurements.
Genetic Deletion of PS1 and PS2 by CRISPR CAS9 Technology in sw
bAPP-Expressing HEK Cells
Two regions in exon 3 and two regions in exon 4 of PS1 (Sherrington et al.,
1995) were chosen as guide RNA (gRNA) sequences. Similarly, two regions
in exon 1 and two regions in exon 2 of PS2 (Levy-Lahad et al., 1995) were cho-
sen. sw bAPP/HEK cells were transiently transfected with both the PX330 vec-
tor, in which one of the gRNA sequences was inserted (Cong et al., 2013; Mali
et al., 2013), and the corresponding pCAG EGxxFP vector. The pCAG EGxxFP
270
Cell Reports 21, 259–273, October 3, 2017
 vector was designed to express GFP when the gRNA sequence bound to the
target sequences and broke the double-stranded DNA (Mashiko et al., 2013).
The most effective gRNA sequence that generated the highest GFP fluores-
cence was chosen (CCCTGAGCCATTATCTAATGGAC in exon 4 for PS1 dele-
tion). To knock out PS1 expression, sw bAPP/HEK cells were transfected with
both the PX330 vector carrying the gRNA and the corresponding pCAG
EGxxFP for 4 hr. After changing the conditioned medium, at 48 hr after the
transfection, GFP-positive cells were fractionated using FACSAria (Becton
Dickinson). Following limiting dilution of the selected cells, sequences of
PS1 at 48 single-cell colonies were determined. Cell clones in which 1 to
approximately 20 nucleotides of PS1 were deleted or inserted were obtained.
Following careful estimation of the amino acid sequence of mutated PS1 pro-
teins in each allele, 7 clones were chosen. Finally, clone 24, in which no PS1-
CTF band was detected by immunoblotting, was selected and established
(Figure S2A). The PS2 gene of the PS1-deleted sw bAPP/HEK (clone 24) cells
was deleted in a similar fashion to PS1. The gRNA sequence used for PS2
deletion was CCCTAATGTCGGCTGAGAGCCCC in exon 1 (Figure S2B).
PS1/2-double KO HEK cells stably expressing sw bAPP were thus established
(clone 2411; Figures S2C–S2F).
Generation of Human iPSCs
IP-1 clone 2 and 5 iPSC lines were established according to the methods
described previously (Takahashi et al., 2007). A dermal punch biopsy was
obtained from a healthy 40-year-old woman without any pathological muta-
tions for familial AD in PS1/2, bAPP, or tau genes, with her informed consent
and with research project approval from Academic Clinical Research Center,
Department of Medical Innovation, Osaka University Hospital (no. 803-3).
Details of the experimental protocols are included in Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures. Another set of human control iPSCs was purchased
from GIBCO with a quality guarantee. All the experiments in which iPSCs
and human neuronal cells were used were performed using the iPSCs from
two distinct clones of IP-1 iPSCs and from GIBCO, and representative data
using IP-1 clone 2 iPSCs are shown in the Results section.
Neuronal Differentiation of Human iPSCs
Forebrain neurons derived from each of the iPSC lines were generated as
reported previously (Eiraku et al., 2008), with some modifications. Specific
experimental protocols are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Analysis of Transgenic Mice
g-byproducts and Ab in PS1 I213T knockin transgenic mice overexpressing
sw bAPP were analyzed with a research project approval from the Osaka Uni-
versity Animal Care and Use Committee (no. 3330). All animal procedures were
performed according to the protocols approved by the committee. Specific
experimental protocols are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by the Welch’s t test. A p value of less than
0.01 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between
the two groups.
