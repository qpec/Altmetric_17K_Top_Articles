ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate whether cannabis use is
associated with increased risk of relapse, as indexed by
number of hospital admissions, and whether
antipsychotic treatment failure, as indexed by number
of unique antipsychotics prescribed, may mediate this
effect in a large data set of patients with first episode
psychosis (FEP).
Design: Observational study with exploratory mediation
analysis.
Setting: Anonymised electronic mental health record
data from the South London and Maudsley NHS
Foundation Trust.
Participants: 2026 people presenting to early
intervention services with FEP.
Exposure: Cannabis use at presentation, identified using
natural language processing.
Main outcome measures: admission to psychiatric
hospital and clozapine prescription up to 5 years
following presentation.
Mediator: Number of unique antipsychotics prescribed.
Results: Cannabis use was present in 46.3% of the
sample at first presentation and was particularly common
in patients who were 16–25, male and single. It was
associated with increased frequency of hospital admission
(incidence rate ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.80), increased
likelihood of compulsory admission (OR 1.55, 1.16 to
2.08) and greater number of days spent in hospital (β
coefficient 35.1 days, 12.1 to 58.1). The number of unique
antipsychotics prescribed, mediated increased frequency
of hospital admission (natural indirect effect 1.09, 95% CI
1.01 to 1.18; total effect 1.50, 1.21 to 1.87), increased
likelihood of compulsory admission (natural indirect effect
(NIE) 1.27, 1.03 to 1.58; total effect (TE) 1.76, 0.81 to
3.84) and greater number of days spent in hospital (NIE
17.9, 2.4 to 33.4; TE 34.8, 11.6 to 58.1).
Conclusions: Cannabis use in patients with FEP was
associated with an increased likelihood of hospital
admission. This was linked to the prescription of several
different antipsychotic drugs, indicating clinical judgement
of antipsychotic treatment failure. Together, this suggests
that cannabis use might be associated with worse clinical
outcomes in psychosis by contributing towards failure of
antipsychotic treatment.
INTRODUCTION
Cannabis remains the third most common
drug of dependence
in the world after
tobacco and alcohol,1 with a growing consen-
sus that cannabis
use is associated
with
increased risk of development of psychotic
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the largest known study (over 2000 parti-
cipants) to investigate the association of canna-
bis use with clinical outcome in people with first
episode psychosis. As well as demonstrating that
cannabis is associated with substantially worse
clinical outcomes, our study is the first to iden-
tify a possible explanation for these findings
through a failure of antipsychotic treatment.
▪ Our study employed a novel text mining method
to identify cannabis use in routinely recorded
electronic health record. This approach benefits
from increased generalisability of our findings to
everyday clinical practice but is limited by the
fact that the presence or absence of cannabis
use may not have been comprehensively docu-
mented in all patients. This may have led to
underestimation of its use.
▪ It was not possible to obtain data on amount,
frequency and discontinuation of cannabis use
following first presentation to mental health ser-
vices. Despite this limitation, our data still
showed a significant association of cannabis use
at presentation to mental health services with
poor clinical outcomes up to 5 years later.
▪ We performed an exploratory mediation analysis
to investigate whether the association of canna-
bis use with poor clinical outcomes could be
mediated by an increase in the number of unique
antipsychotics prescribed (a marker of anti-
psychotic treatment failure). However, as this
was an observational study, the mediation ana-
lysis may have been biased by unmeasured con-
founders and temporal ambiguity between the
mediator and outcome variable.

However, there is much less agreement regarding its
effect on outcome in those with established psychosis, a
substantial proportion of whom use the drug, especially
in the early stages of psychosis.4 Despite the widely held
view among clinicians that comorbid cannabis use is a
predictor of poor outcome in those with psychosis, the
evidence to date has been inconsistent irrespective of
the specific outcome measure examined, such as severity
of psychotic symptoms or relapse of illness (as indexed
by
change in
symptom
severity or hospitalisation),
perhaps limited to a large extent by the size of samples
and duration of follow-up.5–10 Since use of cannabis is
potentially amenable to treatment, there is a particular
need to definitively investigate the effect of comorbid
cannabis use on a robust measure of outcome which is
indicative of relapse, such as hospitalisation. This is a
reliably estimated measure, and has significant implica-
tions for the utilisation of healthcare resources.11
Furthermore, questions remain as to how cannabis use
may increase the risk of relapse. While increased severity
of symptoms is likely to play a role, other (but not neces-
sarily unrelated) mechanisms may be through an adverse
effect on adherence,5 12 as well as reduced response to
antipsychotic treatment.13 In a naturalistic setting where
decisions regarding medication change take into account
a number of factors including response to treatment as
well as tolerability and side effects,14 the number of
unique antipsychotics prescribed is a proxy measure
which may encompass all these factors. Hence, compared
with someone prescribed fewer unique antipsychotics, a
person prescribed a greater number of unique antipsy-
chotics may be considered to have a worse antipsychotic
response, or in effect, antipsychotic treatment failure, as
a result of either treatment resistance or tolerability to
the antipsychotic, or a combination of both. However,
whether the effect of cannabis use on the increased risk
of relapse in psychosis is partly mediated by its effect on
antipsychotic
treatment
failure
(as
indexed
by
the
number of unique antipsychotics prescribed) has yet to
be investigated. Understanding how cannabis use may
adversely affect outcome in psychosis is particularly
important as it may identify mechanisms that may poten-
tially be amenable to intervention.
In the present study, we attempt to address these
issues by investigating the prevalence of cannabis use
and its effect on a cohort of patients with first episode
psychosis (FEP) receiving mental healthcare from early
intervention services. We employed novel data mining
and
natural
language
processing
(NLP)
tools
that
allowed us to investigate a large data set of anonymised
free-text electronic health records in order to obtain
data on cannabis use and clinical outcomes. We tested
our hypotheses that in those presenting with their first
episode of psychosis, cannabis use is associated with
increased frequency of hospital admission (including
compulsory admission) and greater number of days
spent in hospital, and that this is mediated by non-
responsiveness to
antipsychotics
as
indexed
by
the
number of unique antipsychotic medications prescribed.
METHODS
Participants
All individuals with FEP who were accepted by an early
intervention service in the South London and Maudsley
(SLaM) National Health Service (NHS) Foundation
Trust between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2013 were
included in the study (n=2026). SLaM is one of the
largest providers of specialist mental healthcare in
Europe, serving a catchment of around 1.2 million resi-
dents in four boroughs of South London (Lambeth,
Southwark, Lewisham and Croydon).15 16
Source of clinical data
Data for this study were obtained from the SLaM
Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Case Register, which
contains anonymised clinical data from the electronic
health
records
of
individuals
who
have
previously
received or are currently receiving mental healthcare
from SLaM.15 The SLaM BRC Case Register comprises
structured fields for demographic information as well as
unstructured (but de-identified) free-text fields from
case notes and correspondence where history, mental
state examination, diagnostic formulation and manage-
ment plan are primarily recorded. A patient-led over-
sight committee considers all proposed research before
access to the anonymised data is permitted. The elec-
tronic health record system was implemented in SLaM
early intervention services in April 2006, and so the
period of 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2013 was chosen for
data capture to maximise the number of participants
with at least 1 year of follow-up. Predictor, covariate and
outcome variable data were obtained from the SLaM
BRC Case Register using the Clinical Record Interactive
Search tool (CRIS),15 a search and database assembly
tool underpinning this data resource.17–20
Identification of cannabis use
NLP was used to extract documentation of cannabis use
from unstructured free-text fields in the BRC Case
Register including clinical assessments, reviews and cor-
respondence between healthcare professionals. An NLP
application was developed using TextHunter software.21
Full
details
of
NLP
application
development
are
described in a previous study.22 In summary, a support
vector machine learning (SVM) approach was used to
identify sentences containing a positive reference of
current or historical cannabis use. The application was
trained using 478 human-classified sentences which con-
tained the word ‘cannabis’ (or the following synonyms:
‘marijuana’, ‘weed’, ‘pot’, ‘hash’, ‘skunk’, ‘resin’) and
optimised using two rounds of active learning classifica-
tion of a further 1357 sentences. The resulting applica-
tion was tested against a reference standard of 233
human-classified sentences and an SVM marginal filter

 applied to obtain a minimum precision value (equiva-
lent to positive predictive value) of 90%. As frequency
and amount of cannabis use was not documented in
electronic health records in the BRC Case Register, a
binary variable defined as any documentation of canna-
bis use by the patient at presentation with FEP was used.
In order to establish baseline cannabis use at the time of
presenting with FEP
, the cannabis NLP application was
applied to clinical records documented within 1 month
of presentation to early intervention service as, by this
time, all patients would have completed a detailed clin-
ical assessment including assessment of substance use
history, allowing a reliable estimation of cannabis expos-
ure at presentation with FEP
.
Clinical outcome measures and covariates
The primary outcome was number of psychiatric hos-
pital admissions within the follow-up period. Secondary
outcomes included any compulsory hospital admission
(under the UK Mental Health Act (MHA)) and number
of days spent in hospital during the follow-up period.
These outcome measures were obtained from structured
fields within the BRC Case Register. The MHA23 is a UK
statute law which allows for compulsory admission to
hospital for assessment and/or treatment of a mental
illness whose nature and/or degree necessitates hospital
admission and where a patient does not consent to be
voluntarily admitted. Admission under section 2 of the
MHA allows for up to 28 days compulsory admission for
assessment of mental illness. Admission under section 3
of the MHA allows for up to 6 months compulsory
admission for treatment of mental illness. A patient
admitted under section 2 may subsequently be placed
under section 3 of the MHA. Compulsory hospital
admission in this study was defined as admission to a
hospital under section 2 or 3 of the MHA.
The number of unique antipsychotic medications pre-
scribed (as a proxy measure of treatment failure) and
whether individuals were prescribed clozapine during
the follow-up period were also obtained. The number of
unique antipsychotics was analysed as a potential mediat-
ing factor in determining association of cannabis use
with the primary and secondary outcome variables.
The following variables were extracted as covariates
for multivariable analyses: age, gender, ethnicity, marital
status and diagnosis. All covariate data obtained were
those closest to the date of being accepted by an early
intervention service. Ethnicity was recorded according to
categories
defined
by
the
UK Office
for
National
Statistics.24
Diagnosis
was
recorded
using
the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 classifi-
cation system, in the following groups: schizophrenia
and related disorders (schizophrenia (F20), delusional
disorder (F22), schizophrenia-like disorders (F23, F28
and F29)), schizoaffective disorder (F25), mania (F30)
or bipolar disorder (F31), psychotic depression (F32.3,
F33.3), drug-related psychosis (F1x.5) and other psych-
otic disorder not otherwise specified. The data were
analysed using STATA (V.12) (StataCorp. Stata Statistical
Software: Release 12. Coll Station TX StataCorp LP
.
2011) using methods described subsequently.
Follow-up period
Outcome data were collected up to 31 March 2014. All
participants
were
assessed
for
outcomes
within
12 months of the date of being accepted to an early
intervention service (2026 person-years). Participants
with sufficient follow-up data were also assessed for out-
comes within 24 months (n=1738; 3476 person-years),
36 months
(n=1461;
4383
person-years),
48 months
(n=1185; 4740 person-years) and 60 months (n=926;
4630 person-years). Analyses were performed over dis-
crete periods of follow-up rather than using survival ana-
lysis owing to non-proportionality of hazards over time
for the clinical outcomes described above and in order
to facilitate the exploratory mediation analysis described
subsequently.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics for predictor, covariate, mediating
and outcome variables were obtained as means and SDs
for continuous variables (age and number of inpatient
days), means and variances for count variables (number
of hospital admissions and number of unique anti-
psychotic medications), and as frequencies and percen-
tages for all other variables.
Associations of cannabis use with demographic factors and
clinical outcome
The Mann-Whitney test was used to analyse differences
in mean age at presentation (depending on cannabis
use) in addition to analysis of age as a categorical vari-
able in regression analyses. Owing to overdispersion (see
supplementary material: eTables 1–5), associations with
number of hospital admissions and number of unique
antipsychotic medications were analysed using multivari-
able negative binomial regression. Although there was
an excess of zero values for number of hospital admis-
sions at 1-year, 2-year and 3-year follow-up, fitting a
zero-inflated
negative
binomial
regression
model
resulted in no meaningful difference compared with
standard negative binomial regression (Vuong p>0.05
for all models). The association of cannabis use with
compulsory hospital admission was assessed using multi-
variable
binary
logistic
regression.
Association
with
number of inpatient days was assessed using multiple
linear regression. Reference groups for covariates in
regression analyses were defined as those with the great-
est prevalence within each variable. Where covariate
data were not recorded (83 participants with unre-
corded marital status), this was included as a predictor
variable
in
regression
analyses.
No
patients
were
dropped from analyses due to missing covariate data.

 Mediation of outcomes by antipsychotic treatment failure
In order to test the potential mediation of the effect of
cannabis use on outcome variables by antipsychotic
treatment failure, an exploratory mediation analysis was
performed using the PARAMED module in STATA.25
This is an extension of the Baron and Kenny method26
in which a regression model examining the association
between the proposed mediator variable and predictor
variable is compared with a regression model examining
the association between the outcome and the predictor
together with the proposed mediator variable. A coun-
terfactual
framework
which
allows
for
interactions
between the exposure and mediator variables is then
used to compare the two models to estimate the direct
effect of the predictor variable on outcome and the
indirect effect of the predictor variable on outcome via
the proposed mediator variable.27 Comparison of the
magnitude of the direct and indirect effect allows for
estimation of the proportion of total effect that is
mediated. In this study, the number of unique antipsy-
chotics (a proxy measure of treatment failure) was
selected as a potentially mediating variable of the effect
of cannabis use on outcomes (analysed as a linear vari-
able), with age, gender, diagnosis, ethnicity and marital
status as covariates. The results are reported as the
natural direct effect of cannabis use on outcomes, the
natural indirect effect of cannabis use on outcomes
mediated by number of unique antipsychotics, and the
estimated total effect representing the combined natural
direct and indirect effect (figure 1). The percentage of
the total effect mediated by number of unique antipsy-
chotics was estimated for the number of days spent in
hospital by dividing the natural indirect effect estimate
by the total effect and for the number of admissions to
hospital and compulsory hospital admission by dividing
the natural logarithm of the natural indirect effect by
the natural logarithm of the total effect.
RESULTS
Cannabis use among individuals with FEP
Of the total sample, 939 individuals (46.3%) with FEP
were found to have a documented history of cannabis
use at presentation to early intervention services. Table 1
shows the breakdown of cannabis use by age, gender,
ethnicity, marital status and diagnosis. In a multivariable
logistic regression analysis (table 1), cannabis use was
independently associated with the 16–25-year age group,
male gender, single marital status and with a diagnosis
of drug-induced psychosis. Cannabis users presented at
a younger age than those without documented cannabis
use (23.8 vs 24.9 years, Mann-Whitney z=3.84, p<0.001).
There was no significant association of cannabis use with
ethnicity and cannabis use was less likely among those
with psychotic depression or other psychotic disorder
not otherwise specified than those with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia.
Hospital admission
Figure 2A, B illustrate the mean number of hospital
admissions and likelihood of compulsory hospital admis-
sion (under the UK MHA) up to 5 years following pres-
entation.
Corroborated
by
multivariable
regression
analyses (table 2), a recorded history of cannabis use
was associated with a significant increase in the number
of hospital admissions each year after presentation up to
year 5, and a significantly increased likelihood of com-
pulsory hospital admission. The data also showed a
greater mean number of days spent in hospital, signifi-
cant from year 2 onwards, following presentation with a
history of cannabis use (figure 2C).
Exploratory mediation analysis
Cannabis use was associated with an increased cumulative
likelihood of clozapine (see supplementary material:
eTable 4) and number of unique antipsychotics (see sup-
plementary material: eTable 5) prescribed up to 5 years
following first presentation. The number of unique anti-
psychotics prescribed during this period ranged from 0
to 11. While there were no statistically significant differ-
ences in clozapine prescription on multivariable logistic
regression
analysis
(see
supplementary
material:
eTable 6), multivariable negative binomial regression
(see supplementary material: eTable 7) indicated that a
history of cannabis use was associated with an increase in
number
of
unique
antipsychotic
prescriptions
per
patient. The exploratory mediation analysis revealed that
at 5-year follow-up (table 3) the total effect of cannabis
on outcomes was partially mediated by the number of
unique antipsychotics prescribed. This was indicated by a
significant
natural
indirect
effect
of
the
mediated
pathway (figure 1) for each of the three outcomes. The
effect of mediation was greatest for the number of days

(17.9 days, 95% CI 2.4 to 33.4) mediated 51.4% of the
total effect (34.8 days, 95% CI 11.6 to 58.1). Outcomes
ascertained at follow-up prior to 5 years (see supplemen-
tary material: eTable 8) also indicated similar findings
with respect to the mediation effect of number of unique
antipsychotics on hospital admission outcomes. However,
care should be taken in interpreting these findings owing
to the possibility of unmeasured confounding and tem-
poral ambiguity between the mediator and outcome
variables.
DISCUSSION
We investigated the impact of cannabis use on outcome
as indexed by the number of hospital admissions follow-
ing onset of illness in a large sample of patients with
FEP
. The analysis captured data for all 2026 residents
who received treatment from early intervention services
in four London boroughs over an 8-year timeframe and
who had been followed up for up to 5 years.
The use of data recorded in electronic health records
presented some challenges in conducting the present
study. In particular, the ascertainment of cannabis use
was dependent on documentation by a healthcare pro-
fessional in the course of delivering mental healthcare.
Despite this, it was possible to identify cannabis use from
electronic health records with a high level of precision.
The prevalence of a documented history of cannabis use
within 1 month of acceptance by early intervention ser-
vices was 46.3% in the present study. This is consistent
with the high levels of lifetime cannabis use reported in
other FEP studies (West London 63%28; Cambridge
80.3%29). However, it is possible that the prevalence

 identified in our study underestimated cannabis use
owing to under-reporting by patients during clinical
assessment. The sample demographic was characteristic-
ally young and male, converging with demographic
characteristics of other FEP cohorts.4 10 30 31
Our findings suggest that patients with a history of
cannabis use recorded at presentation to an early inter-
vention service were more likely to be admitted to hos-
pital, to require compulsory admission to hospital, and
to spend longer in hospital in the 5 years following pres-
entation. We demonstrated an association between can-
nabis use and the number of different antipsychotics
prescribed during the follow-up period (a proxy marker
for treatment failure). Finally, the association between
cannabis use and the number of unique antipsychotics
was found to mediate the increased risk of subsequent
hospitalisation, particularly with respect to number of
days spent in hospital.
In the present study, it was not possible to establish on
the basis of data recorded in electronic health records
whether patients were deemed by clinicians to be resist-
ant to a given antipsychotic following a treatment trial at
an adequate dose for an adequate duration before they
were changed to another. It is also possible that change
to a new antipsychotic may have been prompted by
admission to hospital due to a relapse. Nevertheless,
change to a different antipsychotic, whether as a result
of treatment resistance or poor tolerability, suggests a
clinical judgement of failure of treatment with the previ-
ous antipsychotic. Regardless of whether the change to a
new antipsychotic medication occurred in the commu-
nity or after an admission to hospital, it is likely that any
change in antipsychotic represented a failure of treat-
ment, which must have preceded relapse of illness and
hospital admission. Together, these results based on clin-
ical decisions documented by clinicians unbiased by
awareness of the objectives of the present study, suggest
that cannabis use may be associated with increased risk
of hospitalisation in psychosis due to an association with
antipsychotic treatment failure. There are a number of
ways in which cannabis use may have been associated
with antipsychotic treatment failure as suggested by the
use of multiple different antipsychotics, including a poor
response to treatment, poor adherence to treatment and
the presence of adverse side effects. Recent studies have
linked a poor response to antipsychotic treatment to the
presence of a non-dopaminergic pathophysiology in a
subgroup of patients with psychotic disorders.32 It is pos-
sible that increased cannabis use among people with
greater number of unique antipsychotics could reflect
reduced dopamine synthesis capacity33 which could
reduce response to dopamine receptor blocking anti-
psychotic medications. Another possibility is that poor
medication adherence among such individuals could
have an influence on increased number of unique anti-
psychotics.5 12 It is noteworthy that in our study, cannabis
was associated with an increased likelihood of compul-
sory hospital admission. A previous study suggests that
poor medication adherence is associated with compul-
sory admission and might also explain its association with
cannabis use.34 While we were not able to tease apart the
precise contribution of these various factors to anti-
psychotic treatment failure, future studies would need to
focus on this area, as this may help develop newer strat-
egies for addressing the harmful effects of cannabis.
There are some limitations which should be consid-
ered in interpreting the results of this study. The

 findings presented in this study are based on observa-
tional, prospectively recorded clinical data. For this
reason, it is not possible to infer any aetiological associ-
ation between cannabis use and greater risk of hospital-
isation or treatment failure. However, it would not be
feasible or ethical to conduct a randomised controlled
trial to investigate the impact of cannabis use on clinical
outcomes. We sought to investigate the potential medi-
ation of relapse (indexed by hospital admission) by
treatment failure (indexed by the number of unique
antipsychotics prescribed). It is possible that switch to a
new antipsychotic may have occurred after hospital
admission thereby resulting in reversal of mediator and
outcome. However, even in cases where switch to a new
antipsychotic may have occurred after hospitalisation, it
is extremely unlikely that hospital admission triggered
the treatment failure that resulted in a need to change
antipsychotic therapy. This implies that even in cases
where documentation of a change in antipsychotic
occurs after hospital admission, the failure of treatment
still occurred prior to admission, and so this may have
affected the validity of the exploratory mediation analysis
resulting in an underestimate of the effect of number of
unique antipsychotics on hospital admission outcomes.
Although we sought to adjust multivariable analyses
for
potentially
confounding
factors
including
age,
gender, ethnicity, marital status and diagnosis, there
may be other unmeasured confounding genetic and
environmental factors (including use of alcohol or
other illicit substances) which may have influenced the
association of cannabis use with outcomes, as well as
differences in positive and negative symptom dimen-
sions which we were unable to measure in our study.
Unmeasured confounding may also have affected the
results from the exploratory mediation analysis investi-
gating number of unique antipsychotics and the associ-
ation of cannabis on clinical outcomes. For this reason,
it is not possible to conclude that antipsychotic treat-
ment failure is the greatest determinant of poor clinical
outcomes in relation to cannabis use and there are
likely to be other genetic and environmental factors
that could influence the effect of cannabis on clinical
outcomes in FEP
.
In the present study, we investigated the association of
cannabis use documented at presentation with FEP with
future clinical outcomes. This was defined as cannabis use
in clinical documents recorded within 1 month of presen-
tation to early intervention services. Within the first
month of presentation, all participants are likely to have
undergone a comprehensive clinical assessment allowing
systematic ascertainment of documented cannabis use
across the whole cohort at inception. However, this
method may have underestimated cannabis use owing to
under-reporting by patients during clinical assessment. A
further bias may have been introduced by selective docu-
mentation of assessing clinicians such that documentation
of cannabis use was more likely if it was deemed to be of
relevance to a patient’s clinical presentation.
It is possible that cannabis use varied during the period
of follow-up with some people ceasing to use cannabis
and others starting to use it. Previous studies suggest that
discontinuation of cannabis is associated with improved
clinical outcomes in people with FEP35 36 and bipolar dis-
order.37 However, owing to varying level of engagement
with mental health services, varying degrees of illness
severity and emigration outside the catchment area of
clinical services, it was not possible to systematically ascer-
tain ongoing cannabis use in clinical records analysed in
this study. It may be that future long-term outcomes were
influenced by changes in cannabis use over time.
However, if this were the case, it is likely that such vari-
ation would have diluted associations with clinical out-
comes based on assignment of cannabis use at first
presentation to clinical services. It is therefore noteworthy
that differences in outcomes based on a history of canna-
bis use at presentation persisted even at 5-year follow-up.
In fact, preliminary analysis of ongoing work in patients
with FEP from the same catchment area (n=95) that
includes systematic documentation of continuing canna-
bis use over the follow-up period (by combining clinical
records as in the present study with face-to-face research
interviews) suggest that 70% of patients with a history of
cannabis use at presentation with FEP continued to use
cannabis after 3 years, with no new cannabis users who
started using following onset of FEP
.38 Hence, taking into
consideration the effect of continuing cannabis use would

 not have changed the direction of the results reported
here, but rather would have demonstrated a stronger
adverse effect of cannabis use on outcome in FEP
.
Using the cannabis NLP application, it was possible to
determine history of cannabis use at presentation with
FEP
, but it was not possible to determine frequency or
amount of cannabis use as this was not systematically
recorded in the electronic health record data analysed in
this study. Despite this, our findings demonstrated that
any cannabis use was significantly associated with poor
clinical outcomes, and while the strength of this associ-
ation may have been greater with increased amount and
frequency of cannabis use, such variation is unlikely to
have substantially altered the overall association of any can-
nabis use with poor clinical outcomes that we report here.
These limitations are balanced with the strengths of
investigating cannabis use in a large sample of all indivi-
duals receiving mental healthcare in early intervention ser-
vices. Our findings are therefore directly relevant to
people who receive care for psychotic disorders in stand-
ard clinical practice. The findings presented in this study
highlight a clear association between cannabis use and
hospitalisation in people with FEP
. The fact that over
5 years, cannabis use is associated with 35 additional days
spent in hospital has important implications for affected
individuals as well healthcare service providers, particularly
as almost half of the participants in our study had a history
of cannabis use at presentation to early intervention ser-
vices. This also is the first published study to demonstrate
the potential mediation of cannabis use with poorer out-
comes by a failure of antipsychotic treatment, albeit with
the limitations described previously. Taken together, these
findings highlight the importance of ascertaining cannabis
use in people receiving care for psychotic disorders and
prompt further study to investigate the mechanisms under-
lying poor clinical outcomes in people who use cannabis
and strategies to reduce associated harms.
