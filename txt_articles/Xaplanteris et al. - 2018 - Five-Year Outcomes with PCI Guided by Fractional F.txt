BACKGROUND
We hypothesized that fractional flow reserve (FFR)–guided percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) would be superior to medical therapy as initial treatment in 
patients with stable coronary artery disease.
METHODS
Among 1220 patients with angiographically significant stenoses, those in whom 
at least one stenosis was hemodynamically significant (FFR, ≤0.80) were random­
ly assigned to FFR­guided PCI plus medical therapy or to medical therapy alone. 
Patients in whom all stenoses had an FFR of more than 0.80 received medical 
therapy and were entered into a registry. The primary end point was a composite 
of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization.
RESULTS
A total of 888 patients underwent randomization (447 patients in the PCI group 
and 441 in the medical­therapy group). At 5 years, the rate of the primary end 
point was lower in the PCI group than in the medical­therapy group (13.9% vs. 
27.0%; hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.63; P<0.001). The 
difference was driven by urgent revascularizations, which occurred in 6.3% of the 
patients in the PCI group as compared with 21.1% of those in the medical­therapy 
group (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.41). There were no significant differ­
ences between the PCI group and the medical­therapy group in the rates of death 
(5.1% and 5.2%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.75) or myocar­
dial infarction (8.1% and 12.0%; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.00). There 
was no significant difference in the rate of the primary end point between the PCI 
group and the registry cohort (13.9% and 15.7%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.88; 
95% CI, 0.55 to 1.39). Relief from angina was more pronounced after PCI than 
after medical therapy.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with stable coronary artery disease, an initial FFR­guided PCI strategy 
was associated with a significantly lower rate of the primary composite end point 
of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization at 5 years than medi­
cal therapy alone. Patients without hemodynamically significant stenoses had a 
favorable long­term outcome with medical therapy alone. (Funded by St. Jude

Five-Year Outcomes with PCI Guided by FFR
A 
mong patients with acute coro-
nary syndromes, early percutaneous cor­
onary intervention (PCI) increases the 
survival rate and decreases the rate of recurrent 
myocardial infarction.1­5 In contrast, in patients 
with stable coronary artery disease, there is per­
sistent controversy about the role and timing of 
PCI to improve clinical outcomes and provide 
symptomatic relief.6,7 Since the potential benefit 
of revascularization depends on the extent and 
severity of ischemia, careful identification of ste­
noses capable of inducing ischemia is essential.8,9 
Current guidelines recommend the measurement 
of the coronary fractional flow reserve (FFR) for 
this purpose.10­12
The Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiogra­
phy for Multivessel Evaluation (FAME) 2 trial 
was designed to target stenoses capable of in­
ducing ischemia (FFR, ≤0.80) in a large myocar­
dial territory and to refrain from PCI in patients 
with hemodynamically nonsignificant stenoses 
(FFR, >0.80). We hypothesized that an initial 
strategy of FFR­guided PCI plus medical therapy 
would provide better long­term outcomes than 
an initial strategy of medical therapy alone. 
Here, we describe the prespecified 5­year follow­
up of the trial.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted this randomized, multicenter trial 
to compare FFR­guided PCI plus medical therapy 
with medical therapy alone in patients with 
stable coronary artery disease. The short­term 
outcomes (mean follow­up, 7 months) have been 
reported previously.13 The trial was sponsored by 
St. Jude Medical; the sponsor did not provide 
support for the current analysis. The academic 
members of the steering committee designed 
the trial protocol (available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org), which was approved by 
all the relevant local review boards. An indepen­
dent data and safety monitoring board oversaw 
the trial.
The sponsor was involved in the collection of 
the data during the first 3 years of the trial but 
not in the trial design or conduct, the subse­
quent data collection, the writing and review of 
the manuscript, or the decision to submit it for 
publication. The two first authors and two last 
authors had full access to all the data in the 
trial and vouch for the accuracy and complete­
ness of the data and analyses and for the fidel­
ity of the trial to the protocol.
Participants and Randomization
Patients with stable coronary artery disease were 
enrolled at 28 sites in Europe and North America.13 
Patients with stable angina or documented silent 
ischemia who had at least one stenosis with a 
50% diameter in a large epicardial artery that 
was suitable for PCI were eligible. The full list 
of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provid­
ed in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org.
Measurements of FFR were made for all angio­
graphically significant lesions. Each patient with 
at least one hemodynamically significant steno­
sis (FFR, ≤0.80) was randomly assigned in a 1:1 
ratio to receive either FFR­guided PCI plus 
medical therapy (PCI group) or medical therapy 
alone (medical­therapy group). The randomiza­
tion schedule was computer­generated, stratified 
according to site, blocked (with randomly varied 
block sizes), and concealed with the use of cen­
tral randomization. Patients in whom all angio­
graphically significant stenoses were hemody­
namically nonsignificant (FFR, >0.80) did not 
undergo randomization but received medical 
therapy and were included in a registry. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all the 
patients.
Treatment
Patients who were assigned to the PCI group 
received a loading dose of clopidogrel (at a dose 
of 600 mg) and aspirin immediately before the 
procedure if they were not already taking these 
medications. All stenoses with an FFR of 0.80 or 
less were treated with second­ or third­generation 
drug­eluting stents. All the patients who under­
went PCI received clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg 
daily for at least 12 months.
Trial End Points and Follow-up
The primary end point was a composite of death 
from any cause, myocardial infarction, or urgent 
revascularization. Urgent revascularization was 
defined as any unplanned hospital admission 
that was due to symptoms that led to revascular­
ization during the same hospitalization. Second­
ary end points included the components of the 
primary end point as well as death from cardiac

causes, any revascularization, stroke, and stent 
thrombosis. End­point definitions are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix. Angina was 
classified according to the Canadian Cardiovas­
cular Society (CCS) functional classification, in 
which classes range from I to IV, with higher 
classes indicating greater limitations on physical 
activity owing to angina.
Follow­up was originally scheduled at 1 month, 
6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. A total of 
50% of the patients in the registry cohort were 
randomly selected and followed in the same 
manner as the trial patients. In November 2014, 
the sponsor decided to close out the trial once 
all the included patients had completed their 
3­year visit. The reason indicated by the sponsor 
was that results were unlikely to change sub­
stantially with longer patient follow­up, particu­
larly in view of the high rate of crossover of pa­
tients who had been assigned to medical therapy 
alone. The academic steering committee subse­
quently invited all 28 sites to participate in an 
additional 5­year follow­up, and 19 sites partici­
pated (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Throughout the trial, detailed narratives were 
obtained for each potential event. Events that 
were ascertained before the original trial close­
out were adjudicated by an independent clinical 
events committee whose members were unaware 
of the trial group assignments. Events that were 
ascertained after the close­out were adjudicated 
by two cardiologists who were not involved in 
the trial and who were unaware of the trial 
group assignments.
Statistical Analysis
The trial was powered to determine the superior­
ity of FFR­guided PCI over medical therapy alone 
with respect to the primary end point at 2 years. 
However, recruitment of the patients was stopped 
prematurely after the randomization of 888 of 
the originally intended 1632 patients. Recruit­
ment was discontinued at the recommendation 
of the data and safety monitoring board because 
of a significant difference in the rate of the pri­
mary end point in favor of the PCI group.13 De­
tails of the original sample­size calculation are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Between­group comparisons of the end points 
were performed with the Mantel–Cox method for 
the calculation of hazard ratios and 95% confi­
dence intervals and with the log­rank test for 
corresponding P values. Kaplan–Meier curves 
were constructed. Landmark analyses were per­
formed according to landmark time points at 
7 days and 3 years, with hazard ratios calculated 
separately for events that occurred before and 
after these time points. Landmark analyses were 
accompanied by tests for interaction between 
treatment and time.
There was no prespecified adjustment for mul­
tiple testing of secondary end points. However, 
because it was considered to be of importance to 
formally examine the components of the pri­
mary end point separately in this follow­up 
analysis, we informally adopted a post hoc Bon­
ferroni correction, which allowed for the three 
components of the primary end point to be 
tested at an alpha level of 0.0167 (0.05 
÷ 
3). Since 
the widths of 95% confidence intervals were not 
adjusted for multiple comparisons, these inter­
vals should not be used for inference about treat­
ment effects. All the analyses were performed 
according to the intention­to­treat principle by 
an author who is a statistician in an academic 
clinical trials unit (Clinical Trials Unit Bern, 
University of Bern, Switzerland).
Results
Participants and Follow-up
Between May 15, 2010, and January 15, 2012, a 
total of 1220 patients were enrolled, including 
888 in the randomized trial. Of these, 447 pa­
tients were assigned to PCI plus medical therapy 
and 441 to medical therapy alone. The remain­
ing 332 patients, who had an FFR more than 
0.80 in all lesions, were enrolled in the registry, 
and half these patients (166 patients) were ran­
domly selected for follow­up. The characteristics 
of the patients at baseline were similar in the PCI 
group and the medical­therapy group (Table 1). 
Tables S2 through S5 in the Supplementary Ap­
pendix present comparisons of the baseline 
characteristics between patients in the random­
ized trial and those in the registry cohort and 
according to site participation in the 5­year follow­
up (yes or no).

with balloon angioplasty, coronary­artery bypass 
grafting, or medical therapy alone (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In the medical­therapy 
group, 439 of 441 patients received the planned 
treatment; the remaining 2 patients erroneously 
underwent PCI. In the registry, 165 of 166 pa­
tients received medical therapy, and 1 underwent 
PCI. Details of the medical therapy in each 
group are provided in Table S7 in the Supple­
mentary Appendix.
In the 19 sites that participated in the 5­year 
follow­up, the median length of follow­up was 
60.5 months (interquartile range [IQR], 59.8 to 
61.7) in the PCI group, 60.5 months (IQR, 59.8

hort, with complete follow­up information avail­
able through 5 years for 371 of 395 patients

Five-Year Outcomes with PCI Guided by FFR
nificantly (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.55 to 
1.39), but the rate was significantly higher in the 
medical­therapy group than in the registry co­
hort (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.91) 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The rates and causes of death did not differ 
significantly between the two trial groups (Ta­
ble 2 and Fig. 2A, and Table S8 in the Supple­
mentary Appendix). After Bonferroni correction, 
the rate of myocardial infarction was not sig­
nificantly lower in the PCI group than in the 
medical­therapy group (Table 2 and Fig. 2B). The 
difference in the rates of primary end­point 
events between the PCI group and the medical­
therapy group was driven by a lower rate of ur­
gent revascularizations in the PCI group 
(P<0.001), a difference that was significant after 
Bonferroni correction (Table 2 and Fig. 2C).
The rates of spontaneous and periprocedural 
myocardial infarctions are reported in Table S9 
and Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
The rate of the composite of myocardial infarc­
tion or death from any cause tended to be lower 
in the PCI group than in the medical­therapy 
group, but the difference was not significant 
(Table 2, and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Ap­
pendix). At the end of follow­up, 225 patients 
(51.0%) in the medical­therapy group had 
crossed over to undergo at least one PCI, where­
as 60 patients (13.4%) in the PCI group had 
undergone repeat revascularization (hazard ratio 
for any revascularization, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.14 to 
0.26) (Table 2, and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Time­to­event curves for the remain­
ing secondary composite end points are provid­
ed in Figures S6 and S7 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
The results of the landmark analyses are pro­
vided in Figure S8 in the Supplementary Appen­
dix. The hazard ratio for the primary end point 
within 7 days after randomization in the PCI 
group versus the medical­therapy group was 
2.49 (95% CI, 0.78 to 8.00); between 8 days and 
3 years, the hazard ratio was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.23 
to 0.51); and between 3 years and 5 years, the 
hazard ratio was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.13). The 
P values for interaction were less than 0.001 
between the first and second periods and 0.13 
between the second and third periods.
Figure S9 in the Supplementary Appendix 
presents the results of the originally specified 
subgroup analyses, and Table S10 in the Supple­
mentary Appendix shows a post hoc subgroup 
analysis according to site participation in the 
5­year follow­up. No significant treatment­by­
subgroup interactions were identified. Figure 
S10 in the Supplementary Appendix shows that 
the variation in risk ratios across centers was not 
greater than would be expected by chance 
(P 
= 
0.93 for heterogeneity between sites).
The percentage of patients with angina of 
CCS grade II, III, or IV was lower among pa­
tients in the PCI group than among those in the 
medical­therapy group at all time points during 
the first 3 years of follow­up. However, this 
difference was no longer significant at 5 years 
(Fig. 3).
Discussion
This 5­year follow­up of the FAME 2 trial 
showed that, among patients with stable angina, 
FFR­guided PCI led to a significantly lower rate 
of the prespecified primary composite end point 
of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revas­
cularization than medical therapy alone. This 
difference was driven by a significantly lower 
rate of urgent revascularization in the PCI group 
than in the medical­therapy group. Patients in 
whom all coronary stenoses were hemodynami­
cally nonsignificant had an event rate with 
medical therapy alone that did not differ sig­
nificantly from the rate among patients with 
hemodynamically significant stenoses who un­
derwent FFR­guided PCI. There was no evidence 
of convergence of event rates between groups in 
the long term. Patients who had originally been 
assigned to undergo FFR­guided PCI reported 
significantly less angina up to 3 years after ran­
domization than did patients who had been as­
signed to receive medical therapy alone. How­
ever, this difference was no longer significant at 
5 years, by which time 51% of the patients who 
had been initially assigned to medical therapy 
alone had undergone revascularization.
Guidelines recommend that revascularization 
be considered in patients with stable coronary 
disease when signs of reversible myocardial 
ischemia are present.10­12 In routine clinical prac­

noninvasive functional testing before elective 
PCI.14 FFR quantifies the impediment of myocar­
dial flow with a higher spatial resolution than 
noninvasive testing and is currently the refer­
ence standard to guide revascularization. In the 
FAME 2 trial, patients underwent randomization 
only if they had at least one hemodynamically 
significant stenosis (FFR, ≤0.80) in a large artery. 
In addition, multivessel disease was observed on 
angiography in almost 45% of the patients who 
had undergone randomization, and more than 
60% of the patients had a hemodynamically 
significant stenosis in the proximal or middle 
left anterior descending artery (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Patients in whom all 
angiographically significant stenoses were found 
to be hemodynamically nonsignificant were not 
included in the randomized trial, given that no 
benefit regarding the end points was expected in 
such patients.15
In previous trials comparing PCI with medical 
therapy in patients with stable coronary artery 
disease, patients were included mainly on the 
basis of symptoms and angiography without 
measurement of FFR.6,7 A sizable proportion of 
these patients had no objective signs of reversible 
ischemia. Such patients would not be expected 
to benefit from revascularization.
Our results contradict the general belief that 
abrupt coronary occlusions occur predominantly 
at sites of mild stenosis and hence that the treat­
ment of severe lesions may not prevent myocar­
dial infarction. This belief was also questioned 
in the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observa­
tions to Study Predictors of Events in the Coro­
nary Tree) study, which showed that the main 
determinants of future events in stable lesions 
were a small luminal area and a large plaque 
burden.16

Five-Year Outcomes with PCI Guided by FFR
aware of the treatment assignments, might have 
been more likely to recommend a subsequent 
PCI procedure for patients in the medical­therapy 
group than for those in the PCI group, thus in­
troducing a risk of bias for the end point of any 
revascularization. To limit the risk of such bias, 
the FAME 2 trial included only urgent revascu­
larizations in the primary end point. Revascular­
ization was considered to be urgent if a patient 
was readmitted to the hospital unexpectedly and 
revascularization was performed during that 
same admission. The majority of urgent revascu­
larizations were triggered by worsening angina, 
ischemic changes observed on electrocardiog­
raphy, or myocardial infarction.17 After 5 years, 
225 patients (51.0%) who had originally been 
assigned to receive medical therapy alone had 
undergone revascularization. Given the high rate 
of crossover to PCI among patients who had 
been originally assigned to medical therapy, an 
intention­to­treat analysis may underestimate the 
potential benefit of PCI as compared with medi­
cal therapy with regard to death, myocardial 
infarction, and severity of angina.
Some limitations must be taken into account. 
First, enrollment was stopped prematurely by 
Figure 3. Angina Class in Patients in the Trial Groups and Registry Cohort over Time.
Shown are the numbers of patients in the two trial groups and the registry cohort who had angina of class II to IV on the Canadian Cardio-
vascular Society (CCS) scale (which ranges from I to IV, with higher classes indicating greater limitations on physical activity owing to 
angina) at various time points. The 95% confidence intervals for secondary end points were not adjusted for multiple testing, and any 
inferences drawn from the intervals as reported may not be reproducible.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
the data and safety monitoring board because of 
a large excess of primary end­point events in the 
medical­therapy group. The early termination 
of clinical trials has been shown to exaggerate 
treatment effects.18 Second, the sponsor of the 
trial decided to close the trial after completion 
of the 3­year follow­up. The academic steering 
committee subsequently invited all 28 sites to 
participate in an additional 5­year follow­up, but 
only 19 sites participated. Taken together, these 
two points resulted in a relatively low number of 
events with limited statistical precision. Third, 
patients, physicians, and nurses were aware of 
the assigned treatment. Even though the blinded 
adjudication of clinical events may have reduced 
the risk of detection bias, we cannot rule out 
that between­group differences in clinical man­
agement biased our results regarding urgent re­
vascularization. Fourth, in stenoses that were 
estimated to be less than 50% in diameter, no 
FFR measurements were performed. A sizable 
number of stenoses with a 30 to 50% diameter 
are associated with FFR values below 0.80, espe­
cially in proximal segments of large coronary 
arteries.19,20 Therefore, it is possible that some 
stenoses that were deemed to be nonsignificant 
at angiography (and therefore left untreated) 
might have been hemodynamically significant.
In conclusion, in patients with stable coro­
nary artery disease, an initial FFR­guided PCI 
strategy resulted in a sustained clinical benefit, 
as compared with medical therapy alone, with 
regard to the composite primary end point of 
death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revas­
cularization at 5 years. Patients without hemo­
dynamically significant stenoses had a favor­
able long­term outcome with medical therapy 
alone.
The FAME 2 trial was originally supported by St. Jude Medi­
cal. The present analysis was supported by research grants from 
the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular In­
terventions and the Hellenic Cardiological Society (to Dr. Xa­
planteris), by a research grant from the Swiss National Science 
Foundation (to Dr. Fournier), and by a Tier 1 Canada Research 
Chair in Clinical Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases and the 
Canada Research Chairs Programme (to Dr. Jüni).
