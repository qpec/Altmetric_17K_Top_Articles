Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a pathological condition 
characterized by incapacitating fatigue and a combination of neurologic, immunologic, 
and endocrine symptoms. At present its diagnosis is based exclusively on clinical criteria. 
Several studies have described altered immunologic profiles; therefore, we proposed to 
further examine the more significant differences, particularly T and NK cell subpopu-
lations that could be conditioned by viral infections, to discern their utility in improving 
the diagnosis and characterization of the patients. The study included 76 patients that 
fulfilled the revised Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC 2010) for ME/CFS and 73 healthy 
controls, matched for age and gender. Immunophenotyping of different T cell and natural 
killer cell subpopulations in peripheral blood was determined by flow cytometry. ME/CFS 
patients showed significantly lower values of T regulatory cells (CD4+CD25++(high)FOXP3+) 
and higher NKT-like cells (CD3+CD16+/−CD56+) than the healthy individuals. Regarding 
NK phenotypes, NKG2C was significantly lower and NKCD69 and NKCD56 bright were 
significantly higher in the patients group. A classification model was generated using 
the more relevant cell phenotype differences (NKG2C and T regulatory cells) that was 
able to classify the individuals as ME/CFS patients or healthy in a 70% of cases. The 
observed differences in some of the subpopulations of T and NK cells between patients 
and healthy controls could define a distinct immunological profile that can help in the 
diagnostic process of ME/CFS patients, contribute to the recognition of the disease 
and to the search of more specific treatments. However, more studies are needed to 
corroborate these findings and to contribute to establish a consensus in diagnosis.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a pathological condition char-
acterized by incapacitating fatigue for several months not remitting with rest and a combination 
of symptoms based on neurologic, immunologic, and endocrine disturbances (1, 2), such as post-
exertional malaise, pain, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive impairment, orthostatic intolerance, flu-like 
symptoms, anxiety, and depression, among others. It is defined as a neurological disease (ICD G93.3)

by the World Health Organization despite being a multisystemic 
condition.
There are no specific diagnostic tests consequently many 
patients with the disorder are not diagnosed or suffer many delays. 
There are several case definitions, Fukuda Case Definition for CFS 
(CDC 1994) (1), Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) for ME/
CFS (CCC 2003) (3), NICE Clinical Guidelines for CFS/ME 
(2007), and Revised CCC for ME/CFS (CCC 2010), International 
Consensus Criteria for ME (ICC 2011) (2) each one display-
ing different diagnostic criteria. More recently, the Institute of 
Medicine has proposed a more simplified criteria (4). Therefore, 
it is crucial that the diagnosis can be supported on objective tests.
The etiopathogenic processes of the disease are still largely 
unknown. Infectious agents such as diverse herpes-virus like 
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) (5–8), cytomegalovirus (CMVH) (8), 
herpes simplex 6 (HHV-6) (8, 9), other viruses like enterovirus 
(10, 11), parvovirus B19 (12, 13), murine leukemia virus (XMRV) 
(14–16), and other microorganisms, such as Borrelia sp. (17, 18) 
have been postulated as triggering factors to no avail. Treatment 
with antiviral drugs at high doses, Valaciclovir for EBV (19, 20) 
and Valganciclovir for EBV and HHV (21, 22) have shown some 
improvement.
The potential role of the microorganisms has driven the research 
into the immune factors and attempts to characterize the immune 
profile of ME/CFS, with great heterogeneity of results (23).
Altered cytokine profiles have been observed in ME/CFS 
patients although more indicative of immune activation and 
inflammation than specific for ME/CFS (24), and a cytokine 
plasma signature has been observed in the early stages of the 
disease correlating better with illness duration than with mea-
sures of illness severity, suggesting that the immunopathology of 
ME/CFS is not static (25). Also described has been a significantly 
lower expression of the CD69 activation marker on T cells and 
on NK cells in ME/CFS patients than in healthy subjects (26), 
altered NK subpopulations and functional capacity (26–29), 
showing a defect in T- and NK cell activation in these patients 
(23). However, results are discrete in some and in other studies 
and there are no observed differences (30–32).
Recently, Theorell et al. (33) evaluated cytotoxic lymphocyte 
phenotype and function in ME/CFS and found no differences in 
the number of cytotoxic T cell and adaptive NK cell subsets, exo-
cytosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and adrenalin 
inhibition compared to matched healthy controls.
A previous study by Curriu et al. (34), however, showed diffe-
rences in the phenotype and proliferative responses of T cells and 
NK cells that clearly clustered CFS individuals and could be useful 
to identify these patients. The patients also had increased levels 
 
of T regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) and lower prolife-
rative responses in vitro and in vivo. CD8+ T cells from the CFS 
group showed significantly lower activation and frequency of 
effector memory cells.
In this context, due to the relevance that these immunophe-
notypes could have as an aid in the diagnosis of ME/CFS, we 
decided to evaluate whether those results could be reproduced 
in a study with an extended cohort and stringent clinical criteria 
to overcome one of the limitations of the majority of the immune 
phenotyping studies, that is the small number of patients and 
controls. Our main aim was to assess potential lymphoid cell 
phenotypes associated with ME/CFS pathology that could help 
 
in the diagnosis. Other objectives were to study whether there 
was an association between any of the cell phenotypes and 
severity of the disease, subgroups of patients or viral serologies 
(HCMV, EBV).

ethics
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommenda-
tions of Ley General de Sanidad (25/4/1986) Art. 10, with written 
informed consent from all subjects.
The study was approved by the Healthcare Ethics Committee 
of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona HCB/2015/0870. All par-
ticipants gave written informed consent, complying with current 
legislation.
Patient Population
The study included 76 ME/CFS patients and 73 healthy controls, 
matched for age and gender. All the participants were over 
18 years old. The patients were selected among patients with 
a diagnosis of ME/CFS, members of a group dedicated to the 
research, diagnosis, and treatment of ME/CFS in Barcelona, 
Madrid, and San Sebastian (ASSSEMBiomedics), that fulfilled 
the revised Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC 2010) assessed 
by two medical practitioners and following a questionnaire.
Patients who under the assessment of one of the medical prac-
titioners were considered as not meeting the revised CCC 2010 
were excluded, as well as patients with a medical condition other 
than ME/CFS that could justify the symptoms of the disease. 
Exclusion criteria for the control group was to be a first or second 
degree relative of a ME/CFS patient.
assessment of the severity of symptoms
Evaluation of the burden of the disease was by a self-reported 
Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire (35), an 8-scale profile 
including physical and mental functional health, and one of the 
most used generic surveys to evaluate the quality of life related 
 
to health. The level of fatigue was assessed by a Scale of Degree 
 
of Impairment proposed by J. Fernández Solà (36) that rates 
fatigue in four levels according to the degree of impact in the 
 
qua 
lity of life and daily activities of the patient (grade 1 <20%, 
grade 2 30–50%, grade 3 >50%, and grade 4 bedbound). Fur-
thermore, ME/CFS patients were asked to grade the proportion 
of fatigue vs pain disrupting their daily activities.
immunophenotyping
Peripheral whole blood was collected from all participants and 
analyzed within 6 h of collection. Collection of samples was in 
groups of 17–24 individuals, a combination of patients and hea-
lthy controls. We were not able to obtain an equal number of 
patients and controls for every group but tried to get the closest 
to 50% (patient’s median 53.8%, range 18–85%). Lymphocyte 
pheno 
typing was performed in fresh blood on the BD FACSCanto 
(Becton Dickinson, US) cytometer, with protocols designed for the

purpose of the study. Cells were labeled with the following fluo-
rochrome conjugated monoclonal antibodies: CD5-FITC (Beck-

APC, CD159c (NKG2C)-PECy7, and CD159a (NKG2A)-APC 
(MACS Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Cells were incubated at 
4°C protected from light for 30 min. Then, samples were lysed 
with FacsLysing (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, CA, USA), for 
10 min, and washed twice with PBS. A live/death cell marker was 
not used, but we aimed to reduce this limitation by using gates 
based on the forward and side scatter to remove debris and dead 
cells to the maximum possible. We also used pulse geometry gate 
(FSC-H × FSC-A) to eliminate doublets that could have been 
originated by dead cells clumps. CD45+ was used to determine 
lymphocyte population. Data were analyzed using the BD FACS­
Diva Software.
A complete full blood count was also conducted to allow for app-
roximation of absolute counts of the phenotyped subpopulations.
assessment of cMVh and ebV antibodies
Venous blood was collected in standard gel separator tubes. IgG 
 
antibodies to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were measured 
 
by chemiluminescence on Architect I2000SR (Abbott Diagno-
stics, EUA). Quantification of Epstein virus capsid antigen IgG 
antibodies (EBV VCA) was carried out by enzyme immunoassay 
[Captia EBV VCA (P-18) IgG, Trinity Biotech, Ireland].
statistical analysis
We used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the 
components that maximize variance and determine whether 
defined patterns correlate with the already defined groups or if 
batch effect could be a leading cause of variability. Differential 
cell population between controls and chronic fatigue patients 
was determined using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test 
(GraphPad.Prism.V.5.00), followed by multiple corrections using 
a false discovery rate threshold of 5% (p-adjusted <0.05). Cell 
population correlation was determined using Spearman’s rho. To 
determine significant differences between correlations we used 
the paired r function from the psych R package (p < 0.01).
To establish meaningful variables in the classification model 
we used Weka software bundle (3.8.0). To select relevant attrib-
utes for the model we used as attribute evaluator CfsSubsetEval 
and BestFirst as search method. Once the attributes were selected 
and in order to check the relevance of all attributes, we followed 
a leave one out strategy and checked for significant reduction of 
model accuracy. We defined accuracy as (True Positive + True 
Negative)/(True Positive + True Negative + False Positive + False 
Negative). Evaluation was performed with 10-fold cross-validation 
 
to reduce model overfitting due to the fact that we were averaging 
10 different training sets that represented the entire data set. 
 
The purpose of the test is to be used as an objective aid in support 
of the diagnosis in patients with high degree of clinical suspicion 
for ME/CFS.
resUlTs
Demographic characteristics of 
Patients
The group of cases included 76 patients and the control group 73 
healthy individuals. There were no differences in age or gender 
between the groups (Table 1). Mean age for the patients was 49.78 
vs 48.71 years for the control group, and 82.89% were female vs 
82.19% in the control group. Mean duration of symptoms was 
17.44 years (5–63). The symptoms began acutely in 76.3% of the 
patients and infection was the trigger in 41.37% of these patients.
T and nK cell Phenotypes
Immunophenotyping was performed in batches of 17–24 indi-
viduals. PCA of the data by groups was carried out in order to 
evaluate whether a bias had occurred during the extraction of 
the samples. No differences were observed between the groups 
regarding the extraction (Figure 1A). To determine the presence 
of non-biological variation between groups due to extraction date 
we performed a guided principal component analysis (gPCA). 
gPCA generates a delta statistic that quantifies the proportion 
of variance due to batch effects. We generated 1,000 delta values 
by permutation of our data. This delta values were plotted and 
compared with the delta value generated taking into account 
our extraction grouping (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). 
We can observe that our delta value falls within the permutated 
distribution showing no batch effect due to extraction date.
We obtained the percentage and absolute numbers of CD4 
and CD8 T cells, T regulatory cells (CD4+CD25++(high)FOXP3+), 
and different NK subpopulations: NKT-like cells (CD3+CD16+/
−CD56+), NK cells (CD3−CD16+/−CD56+), NK CD56++(high), NK 
CD56+(dim), NKCD57+, CD69+, NKp46+, NKG2C+, NKG2A+, and 
ILT2+ (Figure 2; Figure S2 in Supplementary Material).
Potential differences in the variables between the patients and 
the healthy controls were analyzed with a PCA (Figures 1B,C) 
and a Wilcoxon non-parametric test. ME/CFS patients showed 
significantly lower values of T regulatory cells and higher NKT-
like cells than the healthy individuals (p = 0.0074 and p = 0.0258, 
respectively) (Figure 2). Regarding NK phenotypes, NKG2C was 
significantly lower (p < 0.0001) and NKCD69 and NKCD56++(high) 
were significantly higher in the patients group (p = 0.0011 
and p = 0.0075, respectively) (Figures 3 and 4; Figure S3 in 
Supplementary Material).

correlation between cell Phenotypes
We applied a z-transformation to scale data previous to deter-
mination of correlation (Spearman rho) between the different 
cell phenotypes. To determine significant differences between 
correlations a paired r function from the psych R package 
(p < 0.01) was used. We observed that the correlations between 
ILT2 and CD3+CD16+/−CD56+, T regulatory cells and NKG2C, 
NKP46 and CD16+/−CD56+CD69+, NKP46 and CD5+CD8+, and 
NK cells and CD3+CD4+ were significantly different in the ME/
CFS individuals compared to the healthy subjects (p = 0.0003, 
p = 0.0008, p = 0.0020, p = 0.0017, and p = 0.0097, respectively) 
(Figures 5 and 6).

classification model. To select relevant attributes for the model, 
 
we used as attribute evaluator CfsSubsetEval and BestFirst as 
search method. Evaluation was performed with 10-fold cross-
validation. The most informative cell phenotypes generated were 
 
NKG2C (10-folds), T regulatory cells (threefold), CD16+/−CD56+ 
CD69+, NKCD56++(high) (twofold), CD3+CD57+ and CD3+CD16+/− 
CD56+ (onefold).
Using these attributes we tested three different models (logistic 
 
regression, J48, and Random Forest) with 10-fold cross-
validation. The minimum best model used T regulatory cells 
and NKG2C with approximately 70% accuracy, i.e., we were 
able to classify the individuals as ME/CFS patients or healthy 
with those two attributes in a 70% of cases. We obtained ROC 
and precision/recall graphs for all three classification models 
(Figure 7).
sF-36 Questionnaire and levels of Fatigue
Patients responded to the Short Form 36 Health Questionnaire 
(SF-36 HQ), one of the most widely used and generic health-
related quality of life questionnaires. In our experience, the SF-36 
does not portray well the effect of the fatigue in the quality of life 
 
in ME/CFS patients. For that reason, we also used a survey to 
 
assess the level of fatigue based on the fatigue evaluation quest-
ionnaire developed by Fernández-Sola and modified the purpose 
of the study. This questionnaire rates the fatigue in four levels 
according to the degree of impact in the quality of life and daily 
activities of the individual.
Mean value for the SF-36 HQ was 32.83 (6–64), and for the 
level of fatigue was 2.28 (1.80–2.70) (Table 1). The relationship 
bet 
ween both questionnaires showed a moderate correlation 
(rho = −0.46). The values of SF-36 decreased as the levels of 
fatigue increased, as expected (Figure S4A in Supplementary 
Material).
We analyzed the relationship between cell phenotypes and 
severity of fatigue and SF-36 questionnaire values, but we did 
not observe a significant correlation between any of the cell 
phenotypes and the measurements of quality of life and degree 
of fatigue. However, we observed a positive trend between 
the level of fatigue and NKT-like cells (CD3+CD16+/−CD56+) 
(rho = 0.30), and a negative trend between the percentage of 
fatigue vs pain and NKG2C expression (rho = −0.33) (Figures 
S4B,C in Supplementary Material).

evaluation of subgroups of Me/cFs 
Patients and cell Phenotypes
There were three groups of patients according to the different onset 
of the symptoms. Some patients referred the initial symptoms 
soon after an infectious process (n = 24); others described the 
symptoms not related to infections (n = 37). A third group 
(n = 15) did not remember how the symptoms started; therefore, 
we exclude them from this analysis.

We compared the cell phenotypes of these two groups vs the 
healthy individuals using a Wilcoxon non-parametric test. We 
observed significant differences between the groups with regards to 
CD56++(high) (p = 0.1559 and p = 0.0036 for the “infection” and “no 
infection” onset groups, respectively) and CD3+CD16+/−CD56+

There were no differences between the patients and healthy 
individuals with regards to the prevalence of the positivity of the 
antibodies (Table 3). We observed a positive correlation between 
NKG2C and IgG-HCMV for both patients and controls, however, 
there was a significant difference regarding the strength of this 
correlation (p = 0.048) (Figure 6F).
DiscUssiOn
Previous studies have evaluated immune profiles in ME/CFS 
looking for potential biomarkers. Some have found a reduced 
NK cell cytotoxic activity (27, 28, 37–40) that has not been 
corroborated in other studies (30–33). Theorell et al. (33) argue 
that the cytotoxic activity could be reduced when using whole 
peripheral blood (41, 42) or PBMC immediately obtained 
(23, 43) but could appear normal when using frozen PBMC. 
Also other soluble factors like cytokines, catecholamines, and 
hormones would decrease according to the time lapse, since 
obtaining the sample that could explain the different results 
obtained in different studies. We used whole peripheral blood 
analyzed within 6 h of collection that may have allowed for 
detection of changes that could be lost when using a more 
processed sample.
We observed in the ME/CFS patients an increased NK 
CD56++(high) population (p = 0.0075), a small group of NK cells 
(maximum 10%) with greater cytokine secretion capacity, 
particu 
larly IFNγ, and with low cytotoxic activity (44, 45). 
This would be in keeping with the observations by Tireli et al. 
(46), in a study with 40 patients and 35 healthy controls. Also, 
Hardcastle et al. (44, 45) observed increased NK CD56++(high) 
levels in patients with greater severity of the disease compared 
to the moderately affected patients. However, the same group 
had observed lower NK CD56++(high) cell numbers in two previ-
ous studies with 95 and 10 patients, respectively (23, 37), and in 
another study the reduced NK CD56++(high) cell numbers were 
related to the time course of the disease (28). NK CD56++(high) 
cells are more resistant to apoptosis than NK CD56+(dim) cells 
(47), so have a longer life span and can induce T cell prolifera-
tion that could lead to autoimmunity (48) and contribute to 
inflammation (49, 50).
Interestingly, we observed increased levels of NKT-like cells 
and lower NK CD56++(high) cells in the group of patients that had 
described an infection before the onset of the disease. These 
populations have a role in the regulation of the immune response 
through their cytokines. While NK CD56++(high) is relevant to 
regulate anti-viral and anti-intracellular infections, NKT cells can 
play a role in Th2 immune responses. However, higher levels of 
NK CD56++(high) cells in the “no infection” onset group could be 
due to the exposure to raised levels of catecholamines secondary 
to the chronic activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal 
axis as described by Loebel et al. (51).
No significant difference was found in our study for the NKp46 
expression in percentage and absolute numbers (p = 0.6556 and 
p = 0.3897) between patients and healthy individuals, in contrast to 
the observations by Curriu et al. (34) who observed increased values of 
NKp46 expression in patients compared to the healthy controls.
NKp46 together with NKp30 and NKp44 are natural cyto-
toxicity receptors (NCRs) (52) involved in viral and tumoral cell 
lysis (53) interacting with non-MHC receptors and without the 
seeming need of MHC class I antigenic stimulation. Increased 
levels of these receptors have been observed in autoimmune/
inflammatory conditions, such as Sjögren (54) and Crohn’s dis-
ease (55) while lower levels have been described in infections like 
HIV (56), tuberculosis(57), human influenza virus (58), VHC 
(59), and chronic CMVH (60, 61).
NKG2C is a NK lectin-like activating receptor that recognizes 
the non-classical human leukocyte antigen E (HLA-E). In our 
study, we observed a lower expression in ME/CFS patients 
(p < 0.0001), in contrast to the findings by Theorell et al. (33), 
that did not observe differences in NKG2C expression in ME/CFS 
patients. This could be due to the different methodology used 
(whole peripheral blood vs frozen PBMC in their study) (62) and 
their smaller cohort analyzed.
According to Lopez-Botet et al. and Malmberg et al. (60, 61, 
63–68) expression of this receptor is increased in chronic 
infec 
tion by HCMV, but also in coinfection with EBV (69, 70) 
and other virus (71–79). The cell population that character-
izes chronic HCMV infection would show increased levels of 
NKG2C activa 
ting receptor, decreased levels of NKp30 and 
NKp46 receptors, increased levels of inhibitory receptors KIR 
and CD85j (ILT2/LIR-1), and decreased levels of the inhibi-
tory receptor NKG2A (60, 63–66, 80). The immunophenotype 
for acute and latent CMVH infection would be NKG2C+ 
NKG2A+ ILT2+ NKp46− NKp30− NKCD57+ (61, 64, 67, 68, 
81). Gumà et al. also describe this profile in asymptomatic 
individuals with positive HCMV serology (64). Lopez Vergés 
et al. (82) observed that during acute CMV infection, the 
NKG2C+ NK cells proliferated, became NKG2Chi, and finally 
acquired CD57, proposing that CD57 might provide a marker

of “memory” NK cells that have been expanded in response 
to infection.
We did not observe significant differences with regards to the 
percentage nor absolute numbers of CD57+ NK cells between ME/
CSF patients and healthy individuals (p = 0.2095 and p = 0.874, 
respectively), as shown by other studies (33, 83). However, there 
are other studies showing lower levels of this cell population. 
CD57 expression has been considered as a marker of senescence 
and anergy (84, 85) although it is also regarded as a marker of 
differentiation in CD8 (86) and NK (87) cells. CD57+ NK cells 
are highly cytotoxic and their presence seems to be beneficial in a 
number of infectious diseases. However, we observed an inverse 
correlation between CD57+ NK cells and NKp46 expression in 
the ME/CSF cohort (p < 0.0001, rho = −0.58) that is also pre-
sent in the healthy population (p = 0.0075, rho = −0.33) in a 
lesser extent, although when comparing both correlations with 
a paired r the difference is not statistically significant (p < 0.01). 
We hypothesize that this phenotype of higher CD57+ and lower 
NKp46 expression in NK cells could represent different stages of 
a chronic viral infection, and together with high NKG2C expres-
sion, could be consistent with HCMV infection reactivation or 
latency, whereas low CD57+ and high NKp46 together with low 
NKG2C expression in NK cells could be associated with reactiva-
tion or latency of EBV infection. Our study did not show any 
differences regarding IgG EBV and HCMV serology between 
ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. Scheibenbogen et al. (5) 
had detected EBV DNA sequences in B lymphocytes by EBER 
DNA technique in ME/CFS patients, that could reveal viral activ-
ity although the IgG antibody profile would be similar to healthy 
controls (88).
We observed a significant correlation between the expression 
of NKG2C and IgG-HCMV antibodies (HS rho = 0.48, ME/CFS 
rho = 0.13, p = 0.048) so higher values of IgG-HCMVH antibod-
ies would be accompanied with lower NKG2C expression in ME/
CFS patients than in the HS cohort.
There were three groups of patients according to the differ-
ent onset of the symptoms. Some patients referred the initial 
symptoms soon after an infectious process (n = 24); others 
described the symptoms not related to infections (n = 37). A 
third group (n = 15) did not remember how the symptoms 
started; therefore, we exclude them from this analysis. We com-
pared the cell phenotypes of these two groups vs the healthy 
individuals and observed significant differences between the 
groups with regards to CD56++(high) (p = 0.1559 and p = 0.0036 
for the “infection” and “no infection” onset groups, respectively) 
and NKT-like cells (p = 0.0243 and p = 0.1041, respectively) 
(Table 2). One explanation could be due to the exposure to 
raised levels of catecholamines secondary to the chronic activa-
tion of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis as described by 
Loebel et al. (51).
Expression of CD69 in NK cells was higher in the ME/CFS 
group (p = 0.011), corroborating the observations by Curriu et al. 
(34) and in contrast to the study by Mihaylova et al. (26) in which 
they found this activation marker to be lower in ME/CFS patients 
but after mitogen stimulation, as opposed to the non stimulatory 
conditions of our and Curriu studies. However, Theorell et al. 
(33) did not observe variations of this marker when analyzing 
previously frozen PBMC. These contradicting observations could 
be due to the different methodologies used, to the small size of 
the cohorts, of patients and/or controls, and to a different profile 
of ME/CFS cohort. Increased levels have also been found in 
infectious and autoimmune pathologies (89–92). In a study with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) induced in mice, CD69 functioned 
as regulator of the autoimmune pathology and inflammation 
by increasing TGF-beta, a cytokine that has been found to be 
increased in EM/CFS patients (93–95).
Finally, we observed a descent in T regulatory cells in contrast 
to other studies, where the T regulatory cells were increased in 
ME/CFS patients (23) or not different to healthy controls (33). 
T regulatory cells have been found to be lower in autoimmune 
conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (96) and active 
RA (97), as well as inverted Th17/T regulatory cells ratio, with an 
elevated proinflammatory response (98). In RA, treatment with 
low dose of methotrexate (MTX) increase levels of T regulatory 
cells and in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (99) with low 
doses of rituximab (RTX) together with steroids vs steroids only 
improve clinical symptoms. In a pilot study with three ME/CFS 
patients, symptoms improved after treatment with MTX and 
RTX (100), and in a larger study (101) improvement were seen 
after treatment with RTX only.
We strongly believe that our results can contribute to the 
knowledge of the immune pathological processes of the disease 
and to the diagnosis. In particular, the mathematical model 
proposed in our study, based on the altered cell subpopulations 
and their correlations could help facilitate and corroborate, 
with laboratory studies, the diagnosis of ME/CFS in 3 out 
of 4 patients that already fulfill the clinical criteria of ME/
CFS. Furthermore, the phenotypic characterization of these 
lymphocyte subpopulations may help to categorize ME/CFS 
patients that could lead to improve the knowledge and under-
standing of the pathophysiology of these patients and their 
treatment. However, more studies are needed to corroborate 
these findings and to contribute to establish a consensus in 
diagnosis.
