During July 2016–January 2017, two unrelated measles cases 
were identified in the Denver, Colorado area after patients 
traveled to countries with endemic measles transmission. Each 
case resulted in multiple exposures at health care facilities 
and public venues, and activated an immediate and complex 
response by local and state public health agencies, with activi-
ties led by the Tri-County Health Department (TCHD), which 
serves Adams, Arapahoe, and Douglas counties. To track the 
economic burden associated with investigating and respond-
ing to single measles cases, personnel hours and supply costs 
incurred during each investigation were tracked prospectively. 
No secondary cases of measles were identified in either investi-
gation. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) was administered to 31 
contacts involving the first case; no contacts of the second case 
were eligible for PEP because of a delay in diagnosing measles 
disease. Public health costs of disease investigation in the first 
and second case were estimated at $49,769 and $18,423, 
respectively. Single measles cases prompted coordinated public 
health action and were costly and resource-intensive for local 
public health agencies.
Patient A
On July 9, 2016, a male resident of Arapahoe County 
aged 14 months experienced a fever, with cough, coryza, 
and conjunctivitis reported during the subsequent 3 days. 
On July 12, the child developed a diffuse macular rash on 
the head that spread to the torso and legs. The child was 
evaluated by a pediatrician, who suspected hand-foot-mouth 
(Coxsackievirus) disease because of the presence of an ulcer 
in the oropharynx. The child had visited the pediatrician for 
pretravel counseling at age 10 months, before visiting India 
during March 30–June 30; however, measles-mumps-rubella 
(MMR) vaccine had not been administered.* The child was 
seen by a pediatrician again on July 13 and 14 with persistent 
fever, respiratory symptoms, and rash, along with lethargy and 
anorexia. The pediatrician referred the child to a local hospital 
emergency department on July 14. Upon evaluation, the child 
* The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommends routine 
childhood vaccination using measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the 
first dose at age 12–15 months, and the second dose at age 4–6 years or at least 
28 days after the first dose. International travelers aged ≥6 months are 
recommended to receive the MMR vaccine before travel.
was transferred and admitted to a pediatric hospital. On hos-
pital admission, the child’s temperature was 99.1°F (37.3°C) 
and a maculopapular rash on the face, neck, and trunk was 
noted, as well as buccal mucosal lesions. Subsequently, these 
buccal lesions were identified as Koplik spots by a consult-
ing infectious disease specialist. However, there was a delay 
of approximately 5 hours before the child was moved to an 
airborne isolation room.
The following day (July 15), TCHD was notified of the 
suspected measles case and recommended that the child remain 
in airborne isolation during the remainder of the potential 
infectious period, 4 days after rash onset (i.e., through July 16). 
TCHD promptly activated their Public Health Incident 
Management Team to coordinate an urgent case investigation 
that involved contact identification, exposure assessment, and 
administration of PEP when appropriate, to prevent addi-
tional measles cases. The investigation required recruitment of 
public health investigators from TCHD and other state and 
local public health agencies in the Denver metropolitan area 
and assistance from hospital infection prevention specialists. 
Measles diagnosis was confirmed in the patient on July 16 by 
detection of measles virus by real-time polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected 
early on July 15; a positive measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) 
antibody titer was reported on July 20.
The patient’s period of infectivity, defined as 4 days before 
until 4 days after rash onset, extended from July 8 to 16. 
Potential exposures occurred at eight settings. Five settings 
(three health care facilities, an apartment building, and a chil-
dren’s math and reading center) were deemed higher risk, based 
on exposure duration and proximity, and three (a supermarket, 
a large retail store, and a fast-food restaurant) were considered 
lower risk. A total of 311 possible contacts were evaluated from 
the higher risk settings. Among the 311 interviewed contacts, 
283 (91%) were determined to have been potentially exposed 
and were evaluated for measles immunity (Table 1). According 
to the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommendations for ascertaining presumptive immunity, 
persons who were born before 1957, had laboratory confirma-
tion of immunity or prior measles disease, or had documenta-
tion of age-appropriate MMR vaccination were classified as 
immune (1). In addition, for this investigation, self-report of

prior measles disease or MMR vaccination was used to classify 
persons as immune. Persons who were unable or unwilling to 
provide laboratory confirmation of immunity or were unsure 
about their measles disease or MMR vaccination history were 
classified as having unknown immunity, and persons who 
reported no previous receipt of MMR vaccine or measles dis-
ease were classified as susceptible. On the basis of these criteria, 
244 (86%) of 283 potentially exposed persons were considered 
to be immune, seven (2%) had unknown immunity, and 32 
(11%) were susceptible.
During the 45-hour period after initiating the contact 
investigation, TCHD held two clinics to dispense PEP
. PEP 
with MMR vaccine is recommended to prevent disease in 
exposed susceptible persons if exposure occurred within the 
preceding 72 hours, or with immune globulin (IG) if expo-
sure occurred within 6 days and the susceptible person is at 
risk for severe illness from measles, which includes infants, 
pregnant women without measles immunity, or persons with 
severe immune system compromise. Among 32 susceptible 
contacts, 31 (97%) received PEP
, including nine (28%) who 
received MMR vaccine and 22 (69%) who received IG (includ-
ing two immunocompromised children and 15 infants aged 
<6 months). One susceptible contact was identified too late 
to receive PEP and was voluntarily quarantined at home and 
monitored daily for symptoms until the end of the incubation 
period. Susceptible contacts who received PEP and contacts 
with unknown immunity were monitored weekly for 21 days, 
the maximum incubation period.
To alert the public about the potential that lower risk expo-
sures might have occurred in community settings, TCHD 
issued a press release on July 18 that advised anyone who had 
been in the facilities visited by the index patient during the 
period of infectivity to request MMR vaccination if they were 
not already immune to measles and to watch for symptoms.
No secondary cases of measles were identified among con-
tacts, nor were any other cases of measles reported in Colorado 
within 4 months of the index case. However, an infant contact 
aged 8 months who had received MMR vaccine PEP experi-
enced fever of 102.2°F (39°C) and diarrhea on July 20, 4 days 
after vaccination and 7 days after being exposed to the index 
patient. A maculopapular rash was reported on the torso on 
July 23 (7 days after MMR vaccination) and the infant expe-
rienced anorexia and irritability on July 24. Because TCHD 
was already monitoring the infant for symptoms, the infant 
was placed in home quarantine, and a nasopharyngeal swab 
was collected for measles real-time PCR testing, which was 
reported positive on July 28. The nasopharyngeal swab speci-
men was sent to the Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory 
at the California Department of Public Health, where the 
measles virus was identified as genotype A, the MMR vaccine 
strain, indicating the infant’s febrile rash illness and positive 
measles real-time PCR was an adverse reaction to measles vac-
cine rather than a case of secondary transmission. In addition, 
the California Department of Public Health subsequently 
identified the measles genotype from the index patient as 
genotype B3, which is endemic in much of Africa and has 
been reported in India since 2012 (2).
Patient B
On January 7, 2017 (approximately 6 months after the case 
in patient A), a second, unrelated measles case in an unvac-
cinated male adult aged 33 years was reported to public health

in Denver, Colorado. The man had traveled to Thailand during 
November 20–December 14, 2016. The patient experienced 
a fever to 102.9°F (39.4°C) on December 20, followed by a 
coalescing macular rash on December 25, which started on the 
face, spread downward, and lasted for 8 days. The man was 
hospitalized during December 29–January 1; a blood sample 
collected on January 1 was reported as positive for measles 
IgM on January 6; TCHD was notified on January 7. During 
the infectious period (December 21–29), the patient visited 
17 businesses and two health care facilities. The investiga-
tion protocol for patient A was used to classify contacts for 
patient B; however, in this investigation, contacts with only 
self-reported MMR vaccination were classified as having 
unknown immunity. Interviews with 248 possible contacts 
identified 232 (94%) who were potentially exposed and for 
whom measles immunity was assessed (Table 1). Among the 
232 potentially exposed persons, three (1%) were susceptible 
to measles and either quarantined or excluded from work. 
Because public health was not notified of the case until >6 days 
from the time of exposure, PEP was not recommended. No 
secondary cases were identified.
TCHD prospectively tracked costs associated with these case 
investigations (Table 2). Personnel hours spent on the inves-
tigation were tracked in the agency’s human resources system, 
and costs were calculated based on individual salaries. TCHD’s 
nursing division provided costs for PEP supplies. Costs from 
external partners were requested and provided by each agency 
and stratified by personnel hours and supplies.
For the first measles case investigation, efforts spanned 
three public health agencies and two health care facilities with 
756 hours of personnel time dedicated to the incident, at a 
cost of $49,769. For the second case investigation, three public 
health agencies managed the investigation, which required 
435 personnel hours at a cost of $18,423.
Discussion
Measles is a highly infectious, vaccine-preventable viral 
disease that typically causes fever, cough, runny nose, conjunc-
tivitis, and rash and can result in complications (otitis media, 
pneumonia, and encephalitis).
Endemic transmission of measles virus has not occurred in 
the United States since 2000 (3). U.S. outbreaks now typi-
cally occur when a traveler to a country with endemic measles 
transmission develops measles and the virus spreads in an 
undervaccinated community, amplifying the outbreak (4). A 
single case of measles prompts rapid case investigation, contact 
tracing, and use of PEP to prevent secondary transmission. 
Coordination from local and state public health agencies and 
health care facilities can improve timeliness of response and 
limit measles outbreaks.
This report highlights the high cost of public health response 
to measles introductions in local communities. Other pub-
lished cost estimates of public health agency response to a 
single measles case range from $5,655 through $181,679 (5–7). 
Primary cost expenditures are personnel hours for contact 
tracing and coordination of PEP
. The delay in reporting of 
patient B to public health precluded the use of PEP for contacts 
and resulted in lower costs. However, these missed opportuni-
ties for use of measles PEP could have led to secondary cases. 
The cost estimates of these two case investigations are pure 
cost estimates, without consideration of cost effectiveness. 
This is a limitation because it results in an underestimate of 
the true economic burden of these public health investigations.
In addition to the direct costs from personnel hours, these 
investigations place considerable burden on public health 
agencies. For example, the investigation for Patient A required 
support from 41 TCHD staff members representing disease 
control, environmental health, nursing, communications, 
emergency preparedness, and administration. Reprioritization 
of public health programming during these urgent investiga-
tions has the potential to cause delay in delivering other neces-
sary public health services.
A febrile rash with typical onset 7–12 days after MMR vac-
cination occurs in approximately one in 20 vaccine recipients 
(8) and can be confused with secondary measles transmission 
from an index patient. Viral genotyping is recommended to 
distinguish between wild-type measles virus infection and a 
vaccine reaction.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable viral 
infection that has been eliminated in the United States. 
However, U.S. outbreaks typically occur when an interna-
tional traveler introduces the infection to an undervacci-
nated community. Effective interruption of the outbreak 
requires timely and comprehensive case investigation by 
public health agencies.
What is added by this report?
During July 2016–January 2017, two single, unrelated measles 
cases were diagnosed in the Denver metropolitan area, each 
exposing hundreds of persons, prompting a complex and 
coordinated response by multiple public health agencies, 
costing in excess of $68,000.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increased awareness of the risk of travel-associated measles 
infection is needed. Prior to international travel, measles-
mumps-rubella vaccination is recommended to prevent 
measles disease. Even a single case of measles can cause 
substantial economic and personnel burden to public health 
systems. This burden can be decreased by improving measles-
mumps-rubella vaccination rates, increasing timely reporting of 
suspected or confirmed measles cases, and optimizing 
coordinated public health response.
Failure of clinicians to recognize measles early in the course 
of illness in these two cases serves as a reminder that health care 
providers might not be familiar with clinical measles or aware 
of the risk for measles transmission during international travel. 
Health care providers need to recommend MMR vaccination 
before travel when appropriate and maintain a high index of 
suspicion for measles in patients with a febrile rash illness, 
particularly unvaccinated returning international travelers. 
Because of ongoing measles transmission in other countries, 
importation into the United States will remain a threat. High 
population immunity, achieved through high 2-dose MMR 
vaccination coverage; prompt reporting of suspected measles 
cases to local public health agencies; and rapid diagnostic test-
ing and implementation of local control measures are necessary 
to maintain measles elimination in the United States. Increased 
awareness by both clinicians and patients of international travel 
vaccination recommendations for measles is needed to prevent 
travel-associated measles infections. Even a single measles case 
can impose high economic and programmatic burdens on 
public health agencies.
