Introduction
Biliary tract cancer (BTC) classification 
BTCs consist of tumors that arise from the epithelial 
cells lining the biliary tree and can be either 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCCA), extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (EHCCA) or gallbladder cancer (GBC). 
EHCCAs are further classified as Klatskin (hilar) and 
distal cholangiocarcinomas (1). BTCs are heterogeneous 
cancers that are increasing in incidence worldwide, are 
often refractory to standard chemotherapy regimens and 
bear a poor prognosis. These cancers are associated with 
gallstones, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, hepatitis, 
congenital cystic lesions in the bile duct or toxin exposure. 
The genetic alterations in BTC result in the activation of 
complex molecular downstream signaling pathways, altered 
chromatin remodeling, deregulation of DNA repair and 
accelerated angiogenesis (2). BTCs are rich in actionable 
genetic aberrations (GA) and it is possible now to identify 
unique molecular subsets of BTC that can be effectively 
treated with an individualized approach. 
Genomic landscape based on tumor location (IHCCA, 
EHCCA and GBC) 
There has been a rising interest in the genomic landscape 
of BTCs with the advent of new, advanced technologies like 
next-generation sequencing (NGS). It has been observed 
that the mutational profile of BTCs vary with location of 
the tumor. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2), BAP1 
mutations and FGFR2 fusions are more commonly observed 
in IHCCA, on the other hand in EHCCA, KRAS, p53 and 
SMAD4 mutations are more frequent. Activating ERBB2 
and ERBB3 mutations and inactivating PTEN and TSCI

Abstract: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are relatively uncommon orphan tumors that have an aggressive 
disease course and a poor clinical outcome. Surgery is the only curative treatment, but most patients present 
with advanced disease and therefore have a limited survival. Gemcitabine and cisplatin based chemotherapy 
has been the only widely accepted standard systemic therapy regimen in these patients but these tumors can 
be chemoresistant, further complicating their management. In recent times, there has been considerable 
research in the genetics of BTC and with the advent of new, advanced technologies like next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) we are achieving a greater understanding of its disease biology. With the help of NGS, 
we have now been able to identify actionable mutations such as in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), 
FGFR2, BRAF and HER2/neu genes for targeted therapeutics and correlate the genetic variations with 
distinct clinical prognoses. This recent genetic information has the potential to make precision medicine a 
part of routine clinical practice for the management of BTC patients.

mutations are seen in GBC (1,3,4). Common actionable 
GA, their prevalence and possible targeted treatment 
options based on the location of the tumor are depicted in 
Figure 1.
Genomic landscape differences seen in different patient 
populations (West versus East) 
The etiology of the BTCs varies in different parts of the 
world. GBC in Asia and Latin America is associated with 
cholelithiasis whereas in Western Europe and North America, 
GBC is becoming very uncommon with the increasing use of 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones (5). 
In the case of cholangiocarcinoma in Southeast Asia, parasitic 
infection by the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini and 
hepatitis B are often responsible (6,7). On the other hand in 
the western world, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease with 
sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis C and toxin exposure have a 
pathogenic role (7). It follows that there is also considerable 
genetic diversity between these cancers corresponding to the 
geographic region of occurrence.
Ong et al. performed whole exome sequencing of liver-
fluke associated cholangiocarcinoma from Asian patients and 
reported mutations in P53, KRAS, MLL3, ROBO2, RNF43, 
PEG3 and GNAS genes. The latter groups of genes are 
involved in the deactivation of histone modifiers, activation 
of G protein signaling and loss of genome stability (8). 
The same group then sequenced non-liver fluke associated 
cholangiocarcinoma and noted that there was a significantly 
higher prevalence of P53, SMAD4, MLL3 and GNAS in 
liver fluke associated cholangiocarcinoma while non-liver 
fluke associated cholangiocarcinomas had a higher rate of 
IDH1/2 and BAP1 mutations (8). Similar findings were 
reported from an exome sequencing study from western 
patients with cholangiocarcinoma with a higher frequency 
of mutations in the chromatin modulating genes, including

ARID1A, BAP1 and PBRM1 being reported (9). Mutations 
in the FGFR family, including FGFR gene fusions/
translocations have been reported in up to 10% of IHCCAs 
in the western patients while these mutations have not been 
reported to our knowledge in the liver fluke associated 
cholangiocarcinomas (3,10). It is evident, based on the 
above observations that genetic differences exist depending 
upon the etio-pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma. 
However, tumor location may at least partly account for 
these differences. Liver fluke associated cholangiocarcinoma 
for instance, is more likely to be extrahepatic (distal or 
perihilar) in location (11), which as discussed has a different 
genetic profile as compared with IHCCA. 
Frequently dysregulated pathways
HER2/neu, HER1/EGFR signaling pathways
HER2/neu gene is a key driver of tumorigenesis in several 
solid tumors, including breast, non-small cell lung cancer 
and colorectal cancer and its overexpression as a result of 
gene amplification indicates an adverse prognosis. Our 
group recently studied HER2/neu protein expression 
in 187 cases of GBC using the accepted College of 
American Pathologists (CAP)/American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) criteria and noted a 13% HER2/neu 
overexpression rate 3+ by immunohistochemistry (4). 
 
Yoshikawa and colleagues reported a 0.9% and 8.5% incidence 
of HER2/neu protein overexpression in intra- and EHCCA, 
respectively. In their series, early stage disease and well-
differentiated tumors had a higher incidence of HER2/neu 
positivity (12). Data with regards to the prognostic value of 
HER2/neu overexpression in biliary cancers is mixed, with 
some studies suggesting a worse prognosis (13,14), while 
others suggest a better prognosis (12,15). Although the data 
regarding HER2/neu targeted therapy with trastuzumab 
in biliary cancer is limited, smaller case series indicate 
therapeutic benefit in GBC patients who had HER2/neu 
amplification but larger studies should be conducted to 
validate these findings (16). HER2/neu mutations in the 
kinase domain occur more commonly in EHCCA and 
maybe subjects for irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) targeting HER2/3 and EGFR, such as afatinib, 
neratinib, and dacomitinib (3).
Abnormal activation of EGFR receptors, leads to 
activation of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK)/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
PTEN/AKT pathways, both of which are well-established 
oncogenic pathways in BTC (17). A phase II study of 
erlotinib in advanced BTC indicated that EGFR expression 
was noted in 81% of cases of whom 17% experienced disease 
stability for 6 months (18). Lubner et al. further studied 
this signal in a multicenter phase II study of erlotinib and 
bevacizumab; of the 53 patients enrolled; 12% experienced 
partial response and stability was seen in 51% (19). A 
subsequent phase III study of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin 
± erlotinib, showed no difference in overall survival 
between these two groups, however there was an improved 
progression-free survival and response rate in the erlotinib 
arm (20). These studies indicate that EGFR targeting in 
BTC continues to be an area of clinical value. 
BRAF mutations occur in 5% of BTC cases, particularly 
in IHCCA (21-24). Impressive activity was noted in 
metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations with a 
combination of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib 
(MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor) (25). Loaiza-Bonilla et al. 
reported an impactful response in an IHCCA patient who 
received this dual therapy, using a combination of BRAF 
inhibition and a MEK inhibitor (26). This indicates the 
need for prospective clinical trials for BTCs patients with 
mutant BRAF.
FGFR signaling pathway 
FGFR pathway GAs, particularly FGFR fusion genes or 
translocations have been described in 10–16% of IHCCA 
and have gained a lot of attention as potential targets 
for therapeutic intervention (3,27). FGFR fusions are 
very uncommon in extrahepatic or GBC and are almost 
exclusively seen in IHCCA only. The FGFR family consists 
of four transmembrane receptors (FGFR 1–4), 22 FGFR 
ligands and a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) that 
stabilizes and sequesters the FGFs. The major downstream 
signaling routes for FGFR are through the Ras-Raf-
MAPK, PI3K pathways and the protein-serine/threonine 
kinase AKT. Dysregulation of the FGFR pathway can occur 
through FGFR mutations, translocations, amplification, 
overexpression and alteration of regulatory influences such 
as by FGF ligand amplification. FGFR amplifications are 
rare in BTC but FGFR2 mutations and FGFR2 fusions occur 
relatively frequently in IHCCA (27). Sia et al. reported that 
FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusions occur in up to 16% of IHCCA (28). 
 
In our experience, FGFR2-BICC fusion was the commonest 
fusion noted. Our group has investigated the prognostic 
role of FGFR pathway GAs. FGFR2 GA, including fusion 
genes appears to be associated with a relatively indolent

clinical disease course of cholangiocarcinoma (29). 
 
The advent of FGFR-targeted therapies has incentivized 
further clinical research in this field. These therapies include 
multi-TKIs that also inhibit FGFR (such as ponatinib, 
nintedanib, dovitinib and brivanib), specific FGFR directed 
small molecule TKI (BGJ398, JNJ425756493, PRN1371, 
ARQ087, TAS-120) FGFR antibodies and FGFR trap 
molecules. Phase II BGJ398 results were reported recently; 
50 patients with BTC having FGFR genetic alterations 
were enrolled, the majority being IHCCA. The overall 
response rate was 15%, disease control rate was 95% 
with progression-free survival of 6 months, indicating 
that FGFR-directed therapy is a successful investigational 
strategy for FGFR mutated cholangiocarcinoma (30). 
IDH1/2 mutations in BTC 
In 2008, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were first identified 
in glioma and acute myeloid leukemia. Subsequently, 
these were identified in other solid tumors including 
cholangiocarcinoma (31). In IHCCA, an estimated 20% have 
IDH1 while 5% have IDH2 mutations (32). These mutations 
are not seen in EHCCA or GBC (3,33). The most common 
IDH mutations occur in arginine residues in the catalytic 
pockets: IDH1 (R132) and IDH2 (R172 or R140) (34). IDH1 
and IDH2 catalyzes the NADP
+-dependent reversible 
conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, whereas gain-
of-function IDH1 or 2 mutations catalyze the oxidation 
of α-ketoglutarate to 2 dihydroxyglutarate (2-HG), using 
NADPH as a cofactor (35). It is believed that 2-HG is 
mutagenic although the mechanism is not well understood. 
However, this alteration causes change in redox potential, 
increased CpG island and histone methylation, thus 
blocking cell differentiation, impaired collagen maturation 
and basement membrane formation. Mutant IDH promotes 
carcinogenesis by blocking hepatocyte differentiation and 
increasing pools of hepatic progenitors that are susceptible 
to additional oncogenic hits (36). IDH1 mutation is 
regarded as a favorable prognostic factor in glioma. 
However, we and others have not found any prognostic 
significance to IDH1/2 mutation in cholangiocarcinoma 
(32,37). Small molecule specific inhibitors against IDH1/2 
may have promising anti-tumor activity in this subgroup. 
Recently Burris et al. reported the findings of a dose-
escalation study of AG-120 in various cancer types having 
these mutations. Of the 20 cholangiocarcinoma patients 
enrolled, response or stability was noted in 12 patients with 
the disease stability demonstrable beyond 6 months (38). 
Other allosteric IDH inhibitors like AG-881, are currently 
under development for these cancers (39). 
DNA repair mutations in BTC 
DNA repair mechanisms are essential for maintaining 
genomic stability and defects in these occur in BTC. Gene 
mutations leading to defective DNA mismatch repair 
(MMR) are commonly seen in several solid tumors like 
colorectal cancer, endometrial and gastric cancer (40,41). 
Data regarding presence of MMR in BTC is limited. 
Goyal et al. reported a 9% rate of MMR protein loss in 
cholangiocarcinoma patients on immunohistochemistry, with 
4.5% patients being microsatellite instability (MSI)-high (42). 
 
In our series of 321 BTC who underwent mutational 
profiling, DNA repair mutations (MSH6, BRCA1, BRCA2, 
ATM, MLH1 or MSH2 genes) occurred in 13% IHCCA, 
26% in EHCCA and 6% of GBC cases (32). The subset 
of cancers with MMR system defects is very sensitive to 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade using 
checkpoint inhibitor agents like pembrolizumab (43). 
Specific DNA repair inhibitors targeting homologous 
recombination repair, base excision repair and nucleotide 
excision repair are under investigation currently. BTC 
patients with mutations in the DNA repair pathways can 
represent a subset wherein targeted therapeutics in the form 
of specific DNA repair inhibitors or immunotherapy may 
be effective. Further clinical trials are needed to validate the 
safety and efficacy of these treatment modalities.
Mutations in chromatin remodeling genes 
Inactivating genetic alterations in ARID, BAP1, PBRM and 
MLL that are responsible for chromatin remodeling have 
been noted in renal cell carcinoma uveal melanoma, ovarian, 
colorectal and gastric cancers. Chromatin remodeling 
allows genomic DNA to access regulatory transcriptional 
proteins and thereby controls gene expression. GA in this 
process have recently been implicated in the development 
of BTC (9). BAP1 encodes for a nuclear deubiquitinase, 
while PBRM1 and ARID1A both encode a subunit of 
the ATP dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling 
complexes (44,45). Jiao et al. observed that mutations in 
at least one of these genes occurred in almost half of the 
BTCs sequenced in their study (9). The prognostic role 
of mutations in chromatin remodeling genes is currently 
unknown, though BAP1 mutations were associated with 
aggressive disease resulting in bony metastases (3). Another

case series reported 22 cases of cholangiocarcinoma 
with BAP1 mutation and noted that 13 (59%) had bone 
metastases at presentation. These patients experienced rapid 
tumor progression with a mean time for tumor progression 
of 3.8 months (46). This study highlights the dire need 
to focus on BAP1-directed targeted therapies as currently 
there are no effective therapies for cholangiocarcinoma with 
these mutations. It is hypothesized that histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) inhibitors such as vorinostat and panobinostat 
may offer therapeutic value and need to be explored further 
prospectively (47).
Molecular classification with prognostic staging 
system/score for BTC 
Cancer classification has traditionally relied upon 
pathologic criteria that are based on site of origin. Recent 
sequencing studies have highlighted that disparate cancers 
arising from different organ systems may harbor similar 
GA causing them to exhibit a clinical course and targeted 
therapy response that is compatible with the molecular 
phenotype rather than the organ of origin. For instance 
BRAF mutant cholangiocarcinoma may have clinical 
homology with melanoma having the BRAF mutation 
rather than with FGFR mutant cholangiocarcinoma. Larger 
genomic studies conducted with The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) research in lung, colorectal, pancreas, breast, 
bladder, endometrial and other cancers have revealed 
that each of these cancers can be further subdivided into 
three or four more molecular subtypes based on recurrent 
genetic alterations that are commonly expressed. In gastric 
cancer, four molecular subgroups have been identified: (I) 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) type (high PIK3CA mutation, 
hypermethylation, expression of PDL1; (II) MSI subtype; 
(III) genomically stable subtype (diffuse histology, RAS 
mutation and genes encoding adhesion proteins); and 
(IV) tumors with chromosomal instability (intestinal type 
histology, aneuploidy and receptor TKI amplification) (48). 
In case of pancreatic cancer, similarly four subgroups have 
been proposed: (I) stable (20% aneuploidy); (II) locally 
rearranged (30%, focal event in one or two chromosomes); 
(III) scattered (36%, <200 structural variation events); and 
(IV) unstable (14%, >200 structural variation events, defects 
in DNA repair and maintenance) (49). This classification 
has important implications for targeted and immunotherapy. 
For instance, the MSI subtype and the EBV type of gastric 
cancers are sensitive to immune inhibition with checkpoint 
blockers. The ‘unstable’ variant of pancreatic cancer may 
respond well to DNA repair blockers, such as inhibitors of 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). TCGA analysis of 
cholangiocarcinoma is now complete and the expectation 
is that we will have a similar molecular subtyping of this 
disease that may result in prognostic and therapeutic 
stratification. 
In summary, molecular analysis of BTC has been 
extremely instructive; this disease has considerable genetic 
heterogeneity that can be effectively targeted with novel 
agents. The plethora of actionable mutations in these 
orphan diseases has made precision medicine a reality.
