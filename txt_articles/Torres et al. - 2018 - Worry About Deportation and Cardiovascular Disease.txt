Abstract
Background—U.S. Latinos report high levels of concern about deportation for themselves or 
others. No previous research has tested the link between worry about deportation and clinical 
measures of cardiovascular risk.
Purpose—We estimate the associations between worry about deportation and clinically 
measured cardiovascular risk factors.
Methods—Data come from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of 
Salinas study. The analytic sample includes 545 Mexican-origin women.

 Results—In multivariable models, reporting a lot of worry about deportation was significantly 
associated with higher body mass index (BMI), an increased risk of obesity (relative to normal 
weight), larger waist circumference, and higher pulse pressure. Reporting moderate deportation 
worry was significantly associated with an increased risk of overweight (relative to normal weight) 
and higher systolic blood pressure. Significant associations between worry about deportation and 
higher BMI, waist circumference, and pulse pressure, respectively, held after correcting for 
multiple testing at p<0.05.
Conclusions—Worry about deportation may be an important cardiovascular risk factor for 
ethnic minority populations in the U.S.

INTRODUCTION
Researchers and policy makers have become increasingly interested in the health impacts of 
immigration policies, including fear related to these policies (1–5). Immigrant deportations 
in the U.S. have increased over the past decade, from an estimated 189,000 deportations in 
2001 to a peak of 435,000 in 2013, declining to 333,000 deportations in 2015 (6). Increased 
deportation, as well as increased collaboration between local law enforcement officers and 
federal immigration authorities (e.g. under the national Secure Communities program, 2008–
2014) has contributed to widespread worry about deportation, including among U.S.-born 
individuals (3, 7). In a 2010 national survey, 46% of U.S. and foreign-born Latinos reported 
that they worried about the deportation of themselves, a family member, or close friend (8). 
The results of a similar survey fielded between December 2016 and January 2017 suggest a 
persistently high prevalence of deportation worry – 47% of both U.S. and foreign-born 
Latinos reported deportation worry, ranging from a third of U.S.-born Latinos to two-thirds 
of foreign-born Latinos who are not U.S. citizens (9).
Prior research has documented significant associations between self-reported worry about 
deportation and depression and anxiety (10, 11), poorer self-rated health (12, 13), and lower 
rates of health care utilization (5, 14, 15). No quantitative research, to our knowledge, has 
examined associations between worry about deportation and clinically measured health 
outcomes that may be risk factors for cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions. 
Qualitative studies, however, have suggested potential links between worry about 
deportation and cardiovascular risk factors. In focus groups, immigrant respondents in the 
northeastern U.S. reported elevated blood pressures, in addition to increased depression, 
anxiety and sleep disturbances as the result of being targeted by immigration authorities (7, 
16). In in-depth interviews during a time of aggressive immigration enforcement efforts, 
Mexican-origin mothers in Arizona reported restricting travel for the purchase of healthy 
foods and limiting outdoor physical activity in order to avoid contact with authorities (3). If 
sustained over time, these behavioral adaptations to the local political climate might 
contribute to increased risk for overweight and obesity. While Mexican-origin individuals 
are at lower risk for cardiovascular disease compared to other populations in the U.S. (17,

 18), traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as overweight and obesity are associated 
with adverse cardiovascular outcomes among U.S. Latinos (19, 20).
In the present study, we examine associations between self-reported worry about deportation 
and measured cardiovascular disease risk factors among a sample of primarily Mexican-
origin women. We hypothesize that higher levels of worry about deportation are associated 
with higher values on key modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, 
including body mass index, waist circumference, and blood pressure (21, 22).
Data for the analysis comes from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and 
Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS), a longitudinal birth cohort study of women and their 
children born in the Salinas Valley, an agricultural area located in the inland region of 
Monterey County, California. Although Monterey County is one of the wealthiest counties 
in the state, the Salinas Valley is predominantly low-income and Latino. The “Secure 
Communities” (SCOMM) program was enacted in Monterey County in 2010. As of 
February 2015 there were 2,384 removals and returns under the program for a population of 
431,300 (2014) (5.52 per 1,000 pop.); by comparison, there were 35,750 removals and 
returns in Los Angeles County during the same period for a population of 10.2 million (3.57 
per 1,000 pop.) (23).
METHOD
Detailed information on the CHAMACOS study has been published elsewhere (24). Briefly, 
the first cohort (CHAM1) of women was recruited during pregnancy from Salinas Valley 
community clinics between October 1999 and October 2000. Eligible women were ≥18 
years of age, English or Spanish-speaking, eligible for Medi-Cal (a state subsidized medical 
insurance plan), < 20 weeks gestation, and had plans to deliver at the county hospital. From 
an initial sample of 1,130 pregnant women, 601 agreed to participate in the study and 531 
remained in the study at the time of delivery. Women who declined to participate were more 
likely to be U.S.-born and English speaking, although they had similar age and parity 
compared to those who agreed to join. Participants were followed until their child reached 
12 years of age. A second cohort of 305 mothers of 9-year-old children (CHAM2) was 
recruited to join the study between January 2010 and September 2011 when the CHAM1 
children were 9 years of age. Eligibility criteria for new participants matched those of the 
initial cohort (i.e. during her pregnancy with the participating child, the mother was ≥18 
years, Spanish or English-speaking, Medi-Cal eligible, and received prenatal care at a low-
income healthcare provider in the Salinas Valley).
Although participants were assessed at multiple time points starting at baseline, data for the 
current analyses are from visits completed between March 2012 and August 2014, when 
mothers were first asked about worry about deportation. A total of 594 mothers (316 from 
CHAM 1 and 278 from CHAM 2) were surveyed as part of this visit, when participating 
children were 12 years old. Compared to women who enrolled at baseline, women who 
completed the 12-year visit were significantly older (about 2 years) and less likely to speak 
Spanish at home, but were not different in terms of nativity, years spent in the U.S. (for 
foreign-born respondents), educational attainment, or poverty status. We also excluded 49

 women who were pregnant or had unknown pregnancy status at time of their assessment for 
a total analytic sample of 545 mothers. There were no significant differences in level of 
deportation worry for those excluded from the analytic sample due to pregnancy status 
compared to those included.
The majority of assessments were completed in the research office, although about 8% of 
assessments were completed in participants’ homes. Written informed consent was obtained 
from all women in the study. All informed consent and study procedures were approved by 
the University of California, Berkeley’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects.
Worry about deportation
Mothers were interviewed in either Spanish or English by trained bilingual, bicultural staff 
members using structured surveys. Participants were asked the following question: “We 
know that many families are worried about deportation, either for themselves or for their 
family and friends. How much worry would you say this causes you?” Response categories 
were: “not too much worry,” “a moderate amount of worry,” or “a lot of worry”.
Health outcomes
Body mass index assessments were based on a single weight measurement taken principally 
using a digital Tanita bioimpedence scale (Tanita TBF-300A Body Composition Analyzer, 
Tanita Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL), although approximately 13% of the women had 
weight measured with a digital scale (Tanita Baby and Mommy 1582, Tanita Corporation, 
Arlington Heights, IL) due to personal preference or assessment in the home. Barefoot 
standing height was measured with a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca 222, Chino, CA). We 
analyzed a continuous BMI measure as well as a three-category measure indicating normal 
weight (BMI <25), overweight (≥ 25 and <30), and obesity (≥30). No participants were 
classified as underweight (i.e. BMI < 18.5). Waist circumference was measured in triplicate 
by placing a measuring tape around the mothers’ abdomen midway between the iliac crest 
and the inferior margin of the ribs, and parallel to the floor; the average of the three 
measurements was calculated and used in analyses.
Blood pressure was measured with an automated oscillometric monitor (Dinamap XL 9300, 
Critikon Inc, Tampa, FL) that was calibrated annually. The monitor was placed on the left 
arm of participants after two minutes of rest. Three measurements were taken with one 
minute of rest between measurements and the average of the second two measurements was 
used for these analyses. We created a binary measure of hypertension, classifying maternal 
participants as hypertensive if they had a measured systolic blood pressure of > 140 mm/Hg, 
a diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mm/Hg, or self-reported ever having been diagnosed with 
hypertension by a doctor or currently taking anti-hypertensive medication. We additionally 
examined continuous systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure (systolic minus 
diastolic blood pressure) and mean arterial pressure (systolic plus three times diastolic blood 
pressure over three). There is evidence that each of these measurements is uniquely related 
to a wide range of cardiovascular endpoints (25), and that continuous measures of blood 
pressure may provide information about cardiovascular risk obscured by binary measures 
(26).

 Covariates
We controlled for respondents’ age in years, marital status (married/living with partner vs. 
single/divorced/widowed), education (≤ 6th grade, > 6th but < 12th grade, and ≥ 12th grade), 
and family income-to-poverty ratio. Given evidence that cardiovascular risk increases with 
longer time in the U.S. and/or birth in the U.S. (i.e. being second or third generation) (27), 
we included a composite measure of nativity and years of residence in the U.S. (≤ 15 years 
in the U.S., > 15 and ≤ 20 years in the U.S., > 20 years in the U.S., and U.S.-born). We also 
controlled for respondents’ preferred language spoken in the home (either Spanish or 
English) to account for the possible contribution of acculturation factors above and beyond 
duration in the U.S. to cardiovascular risk. To protect the participants’ safety and 
confidentiality, we did not ask about their citizenship or documentation status.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were completed using STATA v.14. We first examined descriptive characteristics 
by levels of worry about deportation. We then estimated a series of multivariable models 
regressing each of the respective health outcomes on mothers’ reported worry about 
deportation, adjusting for covariates. We completed a number of ancillary analyses. First, 
given the possibility that the association between deportation worry and health outcomes 
might vary by respondents’ nativity, we tested interaction terms between deportation worry 
and nativity. Next, given the possibility that underlying depression might be driving both 
worry about deportation and cardiovascular risk factors (28), we re-estimated the models 
controlling for respondents’ prior depression. Depressive symptoms were last measured 
among CHAMACOS respondents three years prior to being asked about worry about 
deportation, using the 20-item Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale. 
We contrasted respondents who had scores of ≥16 on the CESD with those who had scores 
of <16 (29). We nevertheless consider results without control for depression as those of 
primary interest. Although the data do not allow for us to accurately characterize the 
temporal order between depression and deportation worry, worry about deportation could 
pre-date depression, with depression serving as a potential mediator between deportation 
worry and measured cardiovascular risk factors. Controlling for potential mediators of the 
primary association of interest may be over-control.
Finally, given the low prevalence of hypertension in the sample, we estimated the association 
between deportation worry and an outcome of pre-hypertension (i.e. systolic blood pressure 
> 120 mm/Hg, diastolic blood pressure > 80 mm/Hg, prior diagnosis of hypertension, or 
taking anti-hypertensive medication).
Ordinary least squares regression was used for continuous outcomes, logistic regression was 
used for the binary outcome of hypertension, and multinomial logistic regression was used 
for the three-category measure of weight status. Standardized mean differences by categories 
of worry about deportation were estimated for continuous outcomes (30). Missing data on 
covariates were handled using multiple imputation with chained equations. A total of 10 
imputed datasets were created and coefficients and standard errors were averaged across all 
of the datasets (31). We adjusted for multiple testing with the False Discovery Rate method 
(32).

 RESULTS
Just fewer than 28% of respondents reported “not too much” worry about deportation for 
themselves or others, 24% reported a moderate amount of worry, and nearly half of 
respondents reported a lot of worry about deportation (Table 1). Respondents were almost 40 
years old on average and two- thirds were still living with or married to the father of their 
child. Among the overall sample, 88% of women were foreign-born and 12% were born in 
the U.S. The majority of respondents spoke primarily Spanish in the home, ranging from 
72% of women who reported not too much worry about deportation to 96% of women 
reporting a lot of worry about deportation. Two-thirds of women who reported not too much 
worry had completed a high school education or more, compared with 26% of those who 
reported moderate worry and 14% of women who reported a lot of worry about deportation. 
Those reporting not too much worry had a mean income-to-poverty ratio of 0.9 (± 0.4) while 
those reported a lot of worry had a mean income-to-poverty ratio of 0.7 (± 0.3).
Mean (±SD) BMI was 30.9 (±6.6); just under 13% of respondents were classified as having 
a BMI in the normal range, 34.7% were categorized as overweight and 52.7% were 
classified as obese. Respondents had a mean (±SD) waist circumference of 102 cm (± 15.6). 
Nearly 20% of women were classified as having hypertension. The mean (±SD) systolic 
blood pressure was 113.6 (± 14.8) mm Hg and the average diastolic blood pressure was 66.0 
(± 19.6) mm Hg. Mean (±SD) arterial pressure was 81.9 (±10.6) mm Hg and mean (±15.6) 
pulse pressure was 47 (± 10.0) mm Hg for the sample.
There was a significant association between reporting a lot of worry about deportation and 
higher body mass index (β: 2.07; 95% CI: 0.69, 3.45), adjusting for covariates. The results 
of multinomial logistic regression of deportation worry on body mass index categories show 
that those reporting moderate worry about deportation were more than twice as likely to be 
overweight relative to normal weight (RRR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.07, 5.33). Similarly, those 
reporting a lot of worry about deportation were twice as likely to be categorized as obese 
relative to normal weight based on their body mass index (RRR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.06, 3.98), 
controlling for covariates. Reporting a lot of worry about deportation was associated with 
significantly larger waist circumference (β: 4.99; 95% CI: 1.70, 8.28) relative to reporting 
not too much worry, all else equal.
Reporting moderate worry about deportation was associated with significantly higher 
systolic blood pressure (β: 3.71; 95% CI: 0.06, 7.34) relative to reporting not too much 
worry. Reporting a lot of worry about deportation was significantly associated with higher 
pulse pressure (β: 3.20; 95% CI: 1.02, 5.39) relative to reporting not too much worry. There 
were no significant associations between worry about deportation and hypertension (or pre-
hypertension, tested in ancillary analyses), diastolic blood pressure, or mean arterial 
pressure. The results of ancillary analyses suggest no significant interaction effects between 
deportation worry and nativity across the models. Significant associations between worry 
about deportation and continuous measures of body mass index, waist circumference, and 
pulse pressure, respectively, held at p<0.05 even after accounting for multiple testing.

 Ancillary analyses show that those with prior depression were significantly more likely to 
report a lot of worry about deportation versus report not too much worry about deportation 
(Appendix Table A). The reported results held after controlling for respondents’ prior 
depression in ancillary multivariate analyses (Appendix Table B). In this set of additional 
analyses, the association between worry about deportation and pulse pressure was 
statistically significant at p<0.05 after accounting for multiple testing; the associations 
between worry about deportation and continuous measures of body mass index and waist 
circumference, respectively, held at p<0.10.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to our knowledge to empirically examine the association between 
worry about deportation and measured cardiovascular risk factors. We found that worry 
about deportation was significantly associated with higher body mass index, greater risk of 
overweight and obesity, and significantly larger waist circumference among a sample of 
Mexican-origin adult women in California’s Salinas Valley. The significant associations 
between a lot of worry about deportation and continuous BMI and waist circumference 
measures, respectively, held after accounting for multiple testing.
We did not observe significant associations between deportation worry and hypertension or 
continuous measures of diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure. However, 
deportation worry was associated with higher systolic blood pressure, which has been linked 
to congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stable angina, as well as higher pulse 
pressure, which has been shown to be a significant predictor of congestive heart failure and 
peripheral arterial disease (25, 33). The relationship between deportation worry and higher 
pulse pressure remained significant even after accounting for multiple testing.
We note that the findings held even when controlling for measures of socio-economic status 
and, importantly, time spent in the U.S. and nativity. Furthermore, we found no evidence of 
significant interactions between deportation worry and measures of nativity or time in the 
U.S., although the sample may have been too small to extensively explore interactions. 
Alternatively, the lack of significant interactions may reflect the possibility that worry about 
deportation similarly affects the health of U.S.-born individuals who are concerned about 
family members at risk for deportation (5, 6).
Although past research on the health effects of worry about deportation has been limited, the 
broader literature on the health impacts of psychosocial stress in general sheds light on a 
number of potential mechanisms driving the association between worry about deportation 
and cardiovascular risk factors. Societal stressors that persist over time may impact 
cardiovascular disease risk by way of chronic activation of the stress response system, 
including faster heart rate, greater inflammation, and heightened immune response to 
pathogens already present in the body (34, 35). Stress may also be linked to cardiovascular 
risk through adverse impacts on sleep duration and quality (36, 37) and reduced physical 
activity (38). Worry about deportation could also compound the adverse cardiovascular 
impacts of other acute and chronic stressors, including financial and occupational strain and 
discrimination (39).

 There are several limitations to consider. For one, the sample is geographically limited to a 
particular agricultural region of California and is comprised of low-income, primarily 
Mexican-born women, which restricts the generalizability of the results to other regions and 
to other immigrant and U.S.-born groups. Second, the analysis is cross-sectional, which 
limits our ability to establish a causal relationship between deportation worry and 
cardiovascular risk factors. We attempted to address the possibility that prior depression 
might be driving both levels of worry and cardiovascular risk factors, thereby confounding 
the results. In ancillary analyses, we did find that prior depression was significantly 
associated with worry about deportation. However, the results linking worry about 
deportation and measured cardiovascular outcomes largely held even when controlling for 
prior depression. Another limitation is that the exposure measure is a single item and its 
psychometric properties are unknown. There was no valid, reliable measure of worry about 
deportation available at the time this wave of data was collected, although the question is 
similar to one utilized by the Pew Research Center in national surveys (8, 9).
Conclusion
Researchers and policy makers have expressed concern about the impact of immigration 
policies and worry about deportation on the health and wellbeing of immigrants and their 
family members. While prior research has examined the association between worry about 
deportation and self-reported outcomes, this is the first study to our knowledge to test the 
association between deportation worry and measured cardiovascular risk factors. Among a 
sample of Mexican-origin women in California’s Salinas Valley, we found that worry about 
deportation was significantly associated with cardiovascular risk factors, including body 
mass index, waist circumference, and measures of systolic and pulse pressure, after 
controlling for potential confounders. These findings should be viewed in light of policy 
efforts that may either exacerbate or alleviate the burden of worry about deportation among 
immigrants and their family members. Policies that mitigate worry about deportation might 
have potentially beneficial consequences for the cardiovascular risk profiles of individuals 
who are themselves undocumented or have undocumented family and community members. 
In contrast, policies that lead to increased worry about deportation may have adverse 
downstream impacts on cardiovascular risk.
