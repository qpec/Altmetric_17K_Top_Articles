IMPORTANCE Prescription and over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements are
commonly used, alone and together, among older adults. However, the effect of recent
regulatory and market forces on these patterns is not known.
OBJECTIVES To characterize changes in the prevalence of medication use, including
concurrent use of prescription and over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements,
and to quantify the frequency and types of potential major drug-drug interactions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Descriptive analyses of a longitudinal, nationally
representative sample of community-dwelling older adults 62 to 85 years old. In-home
interviews with direct medication inspection were conducted in 2005-2006 and again in
2010-2011. The dates of the analysis were March to November 2015. We defined medication
use as the use of at least 1 prescription or over-the-counter medication or dietary supplement
at least daily or weekly and defined concurrent use as the regular use of at least 2
medications. We used Micromedex to identify potential major drug-drug interactions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Population estimates of the prevalence of medication use
(in aggregate and by therapeutic class), concurrent use, and major drug-drug interactions.
RESULTS The study cohort comprised 2351 participants in 2005-2006 and 2206 in
2010-2011. Their mean age was 70.9 years in 2005-2006 and 71.4 years in 2010-2011.
Fifty-three percent of participants were female in 2005-2006, and 51.6% were female in
2010-2011. The use of at least 1 prescription medication slightly increased from 84.1% in
2005-2006 to 87.7% in 2010-2011 (P = .003). Concurrent use of at least 5 prescription
medications increased from 30.6% to 35.8% (P = .02). While the use of over-the-counter
medications declined from 44.4% to 37.9%, the use of dietary supplements increased from
51.8% to 63.7% (P < .001 for both). There were clinically significant increases in the use of
statins (33.8% to 46.2%), antiplatelets (32.8% to 43.0%), and omega-3 fish oils (4.7% to
18.6%) (P < .05 for all). In 2010-2011, approximately 15.1% of older adults were at risk for a
potential major drug-drug interaction compared with an estimated 8.4% in 2005-2006
(P < .001). Most of these interacting regimens involved medications and dietary supplements
increasingly used in 2010-2011.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, the use of prescription medications and dietary
supplements, and concurrent use of interacting medications, has increased since 2005, with
15% of older adults potentially at risk for a major drug-drug interaction. Improving safety with
the use of multiple medications has the potential to reduce preventable adverse drug events
associated with medications commonly used among older adults.

Ourgrouppreviouslyexaminedtheuseofprescriptionand

in the United States.8 Using the National Social Life, Health,
and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative in-
home survey that included direct medication visualization, we
foundthatpolypharmacywascommonandthatmorethanhalf
of the older adults were concurrently using prescription and
nonprescription medications in 2005-2006, including di-
etary supplements.8 In addition, our group estimated that 4%
of older adults were concurrently using interacting medica-
tions or dietary supplements and thus were potentially at risk
foranadversedrugeventfromaseriousdrug-druginteraction.8
During the past decade, various regulatory and market
events have taken place that may have affected medication use
among older adults, including the implementation of Medi-
care Part D,9 the introduction of dozens of new drugs to
market,10andtheincreasingavailabilityofgeneric11,12andOTC13

concernsassociatedwithcommonlyusedmedications,includ-
ingstatins,14-16NSAIDs,17,18protonpumpinhibitors,19andmedi-
cation combinations,20-24 have emerged that may also have af-
fected medication and supplement use among older adults. A
recent study25 using the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) indicates that the use of prescription
medicationsandpolypharmacyhasincreasedbetween1999and
2012 among adults 65 years and older. However, these find-
ings may underestimate medication use and potential adverse
effects because they do not capture information on OTC medi-
cations and dietary supplements.
Herein, we use nationally representative data from Wave
2 (fielded in 2010-2011) of the NSHAP to update our estimates
of medication use, concurrent use, and drug-drug interac-
tions among community-dwelling older adults in the United
States. In addition to comparing rates of medication use be-
tween the 2 periods, we also examined changes in the risk of
drug-drug interactions.
Methods
Participants
The NSHAP is based on a nationally representative probabil-
ity sample of community-dwelling adults born between 1920
and 1947 (57-85 years old in 2004-2005), including an over-
sampling of blacks, Hispanics, men, and older individuals
(75-85 years). As has been previously described,26 a sample of
4400 individuals was drawn from households screened in
2004 (one individual per household), of whom 4017 were de-
termined to be eligible and 3005 successfully interviewed be-
tween July 2005 and March 2006. The weighted response rate
in this first wave (baseline), calculated using the American As-
sociation for Public Opinion Research’
s response rate 2, was
75.5%.27 A second wave was fielded between August 2010 and
May2011,duringwhichsurvivingWave1respondentsandtheir
spouses or partners (if married or cohabiting) were inter-
viewed. In addition, respondents sampled in Wave 1 but who
declined to participate were approached again, with 161 (26%)
being interviewed. The overall weighted response rate in Wave
2 was 74%, and the conditional response rate among those in-
terviewed in Wave 1 was 89%. All respondents provided writ-
ten informed consent. The institutional review boards of the
University of Chicago and the National Opinion Research Cen-
ter approved the NSHAP research protocol.
To facilitate comparisons between waves, we limited our
analytic sample to respondents who were sampled in Wave 1
(ie, we excluded spouses and partners) and who were 62 to 85
years old at the time of the interview. These criteria yielded
2377 Wave 1 interviews and 2245 Wave 2 interviews, with 1555
respondents being interviewed at both waves.
Medication and Supplement Data
Field interviewers collected data on medication and supple-
ment use during the household interview by direct observa-
tion using a computer-based medication log.8 In brief, respon-
dents were asked to show the containers of all medications,
prescription and nonprescription, including OTC medicines
and supplements used on a “regular schedule, like every day
or every week.
” Medication and supplement names were then
coded and linked by generic drug name to a proprietary drug
database(LexiconPlus;CernerMultum,Inc)tofacilitateanaly-
ses. Additional details on the internal and external validity of
this method of data collection and coding have been previ-
ously described.28
Medications and supplements were defined by type (pre-
scription or OTC medications or dietary supplements), thera-
peutic drug class (for prescription and OTC medications), and
supplement type (nutritional product or alternative therapy).
NonprescriptionmedicationsincludedOTCmedicationsanddi-
etarysupplements.Wedefinedanymedicationuseastheregu-
lar use of at least 1 prescription, OTC, or dietary supplement.

Key Points
Question How has the use of prescription and over-the-counter
medications and dietary supplements among older US adults
changed between 2005 and 2011?
Finding In this national population-based study, we found that
older US adults were increasingly using multiple medications and
supplements, with 36% regularly using 5 or more medications or
supplements and 15% potentially at risk for a major drug-drug
interaction.
Meaning Efforts that focus on improving the safe use of multiple
medications have the potential to reduce preventable adverse
drug events associated with medications commonly and
increasingly used among older adults in the United States.

or weekly. We also identified potentially major drug-drug in-
teractions using a drug interaction software program (Micro-
medex;TruvenHealthAnalytics)fromalistofthe20mostcom-
monlyusedprescriptionandOTCmedicationsandthe20most
commonly used dietary supplements in 2010-2011.
Other Variables
Age at the time of the interview was calculated for all respon-
dents based on date of birth. Race and Hispanic ethnicity were
assessed via self-report. Respondents were then classified as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic (any race),
or other. Education was grouped into the following 4 mutu-
ally exclusive categories: less than high school, high school di-
ploma or general equivalency diploma, some college, or bach-
elor’
s degree or higher. Household income was translated into
a percentage of the federal poverty level (FPL) based on house-
hold size. Respondents were classified as poor if their house-
hold income was at or below 100% of the FPL, near poor if their
household income was between 101% and 200% of the FPL,
or nonpoor if their household income was above 200% of the
FPL. Insurance status was measured using the question, “Are
you currently covered by any of the following health insur-
ance programs: Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, Vet-
erans Administration, or other?” Respondents were catego-
rized as having a usual source of care if they responded
affirmatively to the question, “Do you have a routine place you
go when you are sick?” Respondents were also asked to rate
their physical health using a standard 5-point scale with the
responses excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.
Statistical Analysis
The prevalence of use of any prescription medications, OTC
medications,anddietarysupplements,aswellasspecificmedi-
cations, was estimated separately for each wave, both overall
and separately by sex. In addition, the prevalence of use by
therapeutic class and for the 20 most commonly used medi-
cations and supplements and interacting drug regimens was
estimated. All prevalence estimates are weighted using the
sample weights distributed with the data set to adjust for un-
equalprobabilitiesofselectionanddifferentialnonresponse.29
Variance estimates were obtained using the stratum and pri-
mary sampling unit variables distributed with the data set via
the linearization method.30 Confidence intervals were com-
puted on the logit scale and then transformed to the corre-
sponding prevalence.
Comparisonsbetweenwaveswereperformedin2ways.Ini-
tially, a Wald test of the 2 prevalence estimates was con-
ducted, which provides a test of the null hypothesis that the
prevalence among those 62 to 85 years old is equal at both pe-
riods. However, because the use of many medications is asso-
ciated with age, changes in the age distribution within the sub-
population 62 to 85 years old may affect the overall prevalence
of use. To allow for this possibility, a logistic regression was fit
tothepooleddataset(ie,bothwaves),includingage,wave,and
an interaction between the 2. From the fitted model, age-
specificdifferencesinthepredictedprevalencebetweenwaves
were computed (on the logit scale) and averaged over the ob-
servedages.Theresultingpredictivemarginwastestedagainst
the null hypothesis that the population value was zero,31 thus
providing a comparison between waves unaffected by changes
in the age distribution. Note that in both cases, the design-
basedcovariancematrixoftheestimatorsallowsforthedepen-
dencebetweenobservationsfromthesamerespondentatboth
waves because both observations are taken from the same pri-
mary sampling unit.32 The dates of the analysis were March to
November 2015. All analyses were performed using statistical
software (Stata, version 14.1; StataCorp LP). All P values are 2
sided, with a level of significance of .05.
Results
Among 2377 Wave 1 and 2245 Wave 2 interviews, only 26 (1.1%)
and 39 (1.7%) respondents, respectively, declined to com-
plete the medication log, yielding an analytic subsample of
4557 interviews. Table 1 lists the characteristics of this sub-
sample, which correspond closely to those of respondents in
the 2002 and 2012 Current Population Survey.33 Compared
with 2005-2006, older adults in 2010-2011 were more likely
to be insured and have a usual source of care.
Use and Concurrent Use of Prescription and OTC
Medications and Supplements
The Figure shows the prevalence of medication use in 2005-
2006 and 2010-2011 overall and by the number and type of
medication. The prevalence of prescription medication use
amongolderadults62to85yearsoldmarginallyincreasedfrom
84.1% (95% CI, 82.3%-85.7%) in 2005-2006 to 87.7% (95% CI,
85.6%-89.6%) in 2010-2011 (P = .003). Polypharmacy (con-
current use of ≥5 prescription medications) increased from
30.6% to 35.8% (P = .02). Concurrent use of 5 or more medi-
cationsorsupplementsofanytypeincreasedsubstantiallyfrom
53.4% to 67.1% during this 5-year period (P < .001). The use of
OTC medications declined from 44.4% (95% CI, 41.5%-
47.4%) to 37.9% (95% CI, 35.3%-40.6%) (P < .001), while the
use of dietary supplements increased from 51.8% (95% CI,
48.1%-55.4%) to 63.7% (95% CI, 60.6%-66.7%) (P < .001). Con-
current use of 2 or more dietary supplements increased from
31.6% to 47.0% (P < .001).
Among older adult prescription medication users, con-
current use of nonprescription medications (OTC or dietary
supplements)marginallychangedfrom70.2%to71.7%(P = .53)
(eFigure in the Supplement). While concurrent use of OTC
medications declined from 48.3% to 39.9% (P < .001), concur-
rent use of dietary supplements increased substantially from
53.9% to 65.7% (P < .001).
Use of Specific Therapeutic Classes, Medications,
and Supplements
Table 2 summarizes increases in the use of several therapeu-
tic classes, including statins (33.8% to 46.2%, P < .001), anti-
platelets (32.8% to 43.0%, P < .001), NSAIDs (10.1% to 13.7%,
P < .001),andprotonpumpinhibitors(15.7%to18.5%,P = .05).
The prevalence of the use of antihypertensives increased
slightly (60.9% to 65.1%, P = .01), driven largely by increases
in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (24.5% to 30.4%,

P < .001), which were as commonly used as diuretics (29.5%)
and β-blockers (31.2%) in 2010-2011.
The use of many individual medications among older
adults increased from 2005 to 2011, including simvastatin
(10.3% to 22.5%), aspirin (30.2% to 40.2%), lisinopril (12.9%
to 19.9%), and omeprazole (8.2% to 14.2%) (P < .001 for all)
(Table 3). By contrast, there was a significant decline in the use
of atorvastatin calcium (13.8% to 9.7%, P < .001) and no sig-
nificant changes in the use of other medications, such as war-
farin sodium, furosemide, and acetaminophen.
Multivitamin or mineral supplements and calcium were
the most commonly used supplements in both 2005-2006 and
2010-2011 (Table 3). There were clinically and statistically sig-
nificantincreasesintheuseofomega-3fishoils(4.7%to18.6%),
vitamin D (4.6% to 15.6%), and coenzyme Q10 (1.5% to 3.0%)
between 2005-2006 and 2010-2011 (P < .05 for all). While the
use of vitamin E (9.0% to 7.0%) and folic acid (5.9% to 4.2%)
significantlydeclined(P < .05forboth),theuseofseveralcom-
mon dietary supplements, specifically potassium (7.5% to
8.5%), niacin (2.0% to 2.3%), and vitamin C (9.3% to 9.5%), re-
mained constant.
Use of Potentially Interacting Drug Regimens
Using Micromedex, we identified 93 potential drug-drug in-
teractionsthatinvolvedprescriptionandOTCmedicationsand
supplements based on the 20 most commonly used medica-
tions and 20 most commonly used supplements (40 prod-
ucts in total). Among these 20 products, 15 interacting com-
binations were classified as potentially of major or life-
threatening severity, all of which were used by at least 1
respondent in our sample (Table 4).
Approximately 15.1% (95% CI, 13.2%-17.1%) of older adults
62 to 85 years old were using medication combinations with
the potential for a major drug-drug interaction in 2010-2011,
which reflected an increase from an estimated 8.4% (95% CI,
7.2%-9.8%) of the older population similarly at risk in 2005-

2006 (P < .001). In both periods, men (19.8%) were signifi-
cantly more likely than women (11.7%) to use interacting medi-
cations. Furthermore, in 2010-2011, 4.2% of older adults were
using multiple (≥2) potentially interacting drug regimens, an
approximately 3-fold greater proportion than the 1.6% esti-
mated to be at risk in 2005-2006 (P < .05).
Preventive cardiovascular medications and supplements
were increasingly used concurrently in interacting drug regi-
mens. The use of both amlodipine and simvastatin was the
most commonly used interacting drug regimen involving con-
current use of prescription medications and significantly in-
creased from 1.0% to 3.9% between 2005-2006 and 2010-
2011 (P < .001). This potentially major interaction was
significantly more common in older adult men than women.
Concurrent use of aspirin with clopidogrel bisulfate in-
creased by almost 2-fold from 2.3% to 4.6% during this 5-year
period. The use of warfarin concurrently with omega-3 supple-
ments, an alternative therapy, increased substantially from
0.1% in 2005-2006 to 0.8% in 2010-11 (P < .001). In addition,
concurrent use of aspirin and naproxen (both OTC medica-
tions)significantlyincreasedfrom0.9%to2.2%between2005-
2006 and 2010-2011 (P = .001).
Discussion
We used in-home interviews with direct medication inspec-
tion to examine prescription and OTC medication use and di-
etary supplement use among a nationally representative
sample of older adults in the United States in 2010-2011. Simi-
lar to a recent study25 of the US population using the NHANES,
we found that more than 1 in 3 older adults use 5 or more pre-
scription medications concurrently. We also found that more
than two-thirds of older adults concurrently use prescription
medications with OTC medications or dietary supplements.
Since 2005-2006, concurrent use of interacting medications
and supplements has almost doubled, with approximately
1 in 6 older adults potentially at risk for a major drug-drug in-

teraction. Most of these interacting drug regimens involve
medications and dietary supplements increasingly used in
2010-2011.
We identified increases in the use of many therapeutic
classes, including statins, NSAIDs, and antiplatelets, that were
particularly noteworthy. Our findings for prescription-only
medications, such as statins, were similar to those observed
in the recent NHANES study,25 which substantially underes-
timates the use of and changes in the use of antiplatelets and
NSAIDs (commonly used OTC medications). These changes,
which persisted in age-adjusted analyses, demonstrate the po-
tential for large secular changes in the use of many prescrip-
tion and OTC products and therapeutic classes over short pe-
riods. Although our investigation was not designed to
determine the specific causes of changes that we identify, sev-
eral contributing factors may account for increases we ob-
served, including the implementation of Medicare Part D,10,34
changes to clinical guidelines,35,36 and market dynamics, such
as new therapies brought to market as well as patent
expirations.13,37-40
Despite no evidence of any clinical benefits,41 dietary
supplement use is increasingly common among older adults,
with almost a 50% increase in the use of multiple supple-
ments. The almost 4-fold increase in the use of omega-3 fish
oils over a 5-year period is particularly noteworthy consider-
ing their limited cardiovascular benefits.42 We also identified
an almost 3-fold increase in the use of vitamin D, which may
be due to increased reports supporting possible cognitive ben-
efits in older adults.43 However, vitamin E use has declined,
coinciding with the US Preventive Services Task Force recom-

While concurrent use of prescription and nonprescrip-
tion medications remains common, concurrent use of inter-
acting medications among older adults has almost doubled
since 2005-2006, with approximately 1 in 6 older adults in the
United States potentially at risk for a major drug-drug inter-
action. Most of these interactions involved medications and
supplements increasingly used in 2010-2011 and indicate that
commonly used medications are often concurrently used in
combinations that may potentially contribute to and worsen
avoidable adverse drug events in older adults,7 including re-
nal failure and hemorrhagic complications.4,21-23 These find-
ingssuggestthattheunsafeuseofmultiplemedicationsamong

verse effects of commonly used prescription and nonprescrip-
tion medication combinations when treating older adults and
counsel patients about these risks.
Improving the safe use of medications is particularly im-
portant among older adults using preventive cardiovascular
medications and supplements. Most of the interacting regi-
mens we identified involved statins, antiplatelets (eg, clopi-
dogrel and aspirin), NSAIDs, or omega-3 fish oils, which may
not only lead to adverse drug events due to drug-drug inter-
actions but also worsen cardiovascular risk.20-24,42 For ex-
ample, the use of clopidogrel in combination with omeprazole
or NSAIDs is associated with an increased risk of myocardial
infarction, hemorrhagic complications, or cardiovascular
death.20,22-24 However, according to our analyses, approxi-
mately 1.8% of older adults (or 1 million) regularly use clopi-
dogrel in interacting combinations.
Recentimplementationoftreatmentguidelinespromoting
statinsintheprimarypreventionofcardiovasculardisease,45as
well as the availability of both clopidogrel and atorvastatin as
generics,46,47 may further increase the use of these interacting
regimens. Therefore, efforts are needed that focus on increas-
ing patient and health care professional awareness of the risks
associatedwithconcurrentuseofinteractingmedicationsamong
older adults, particularly for statins and antiplatelets. These ef-
fortsmayincludeincorporationoftheinteractioneffectsofcom-
monlyusedmedications,includingOTCmedicationsanddietary
supplements, in treatment guidelines.
Ourstudyhasseverallimitations.First,therisk-benefitpro-
file of a potentially interacting drug regimen may vary be-
tween patients, and we examined the potential for drug inter-
actions. Our study was not designed to evaluate health
outcomes directly, including adverse drug events. Second,
there is a broad range of factors that influence adverse drug
events, such as liver and kidney function, type of interaction,
dosage, timing of concurrent use, and disease severity, and our
datawerenotdesignedtoevaluatethesefactors.Third,weused
the Micromedex drug interaction software to identify poten-
tial interactions in our sample, and alternative sources of such
information may yield greater or lesser estimates of the preva-
lence of specific types of drug-drug interactions. Fourth, our
data were limited to medications used regularly rather than
occasionallyandthusexcludemedicationscommonlyusedfor
acute conditions, such as antibiotics for acute bronchitis, that
may potentially interact with medications regularly used. We
also restricted our analyses to the 20 most commonly used
medicationsandsupplements;therefore,ourfindingsmayun-
derestimate the potential risk of major drug-drug interac-
tions among older adults.

Conclusions
Older adults are increasingly using multiple medications and
dietary supplements, and the use of interacting medication
regimens has increased over time. Approximately 1 in 6 older
adults may be at risk for a major drug-drug interaction.
Efforts that focus on improving the safe use of multiple
medications have the potential to reduce preventable
adverse drug events associated with medications commonly
and increasingly used among older adults in the United
States.

LESS IS MORE
Polypharmacy—Time to Get Beyond Numbers
Michael A. Steinman, MD
When I tell someone that I am a geriatrician, I often get the
same response. I am told half-jokingly that the person needs
my services. Then, I am regaled with a story of how the per-
son’
s older parent, grandparent, or spouse is prescribed an
enormous number of medications, thinks they might be caus-
ing problems, and does not know what to do about it.
It is this view of polypharmacy that often dominates pa-
tients’
, and increasingly clinicians’
, experience of medica-
tion use. This skeptical per-
spective is largely justified.
The number of medications a
personusesisbyfarthestron-
gest risk factor for medica-
tion-related problems. As the number of medications rises, ad-
verse drug reactions become more common. Adherence
worsens. Out-of-pocket costs rise. Drug-drug interactions in-
crease. The use of potentially inappropriate and unnecessary
medications escalates.
Viewed in this light, the article in this issue of JAMA
Internal Medicine by Qato et al1 highlights that the challenges
of polypharmacy are not going away. Using data from a
national sample of older adults, the authors found that the
use of multiple medications has increased between 2005-
2006 and 2010-2011. One decade ago, 31% of older adults
were taking 5 or more prescription medications. Five years
later, it was 36%. The results are more striking if over-the-
counter medications and dietary supplements are included
in the total. With these therapies, 53% of older adults were
taking 5 or more medications in 2005-2006, rising to 67% by
2010-2011. Moreover, as Jou and Johnson2 describe in their
research letter, 25% of adults do not report to their physi-
cians the herbs and supplements they are taking. This is
mostly because physicians do not ask and because patients
do not think their health care providers need to know. There-
fore, we underrecognize the presence of polypharmacy and
the multiple sources that contribute to it.
Theseresultsareconsistentwithalargebodyofresearchthat
has documented a seemingly inexorable rise in medication use
among older adults. What they do not tell us is whether these
changes are good or bad.3 For example, some of the biggest in-
creasesdocumentedbyQatoetal1wereintheuseofstatinsand
