 Bipolar affective disorder is characterised by extreme depressive
and manic affective states, which are often associated with adverse
outcomes, including reduced functioning, impaired quality of life
and increased risk of death by suicide.1–3 Response to treatment is
limited, with high rates of relapse.4 A better understanding of the
risk factors for bipolar disorder is vital for refining detection and
intervention strategies. Although research has typically focused on
the biogenetic determinants of bipolar symptoms, environmental
risk factors are increasingly being considered.5 This review and
meta-analysis explore the association between bipolar disorder
and childhood adversity.
Childhood adversity is associated with a variety of negative
outcomes in the general population.6 In individuals with bipolar
affective disorder it has been linked to increased mood cycling,
greater numbers of affective episodes and the presence of
psychosis.7,8 However, the question of whether childhood adversity
relates to the development of this disorder remains unresolved.
Previous reviews have observed high rates of adversity in many,
but not all, samples of people with bipolar disorder.9–14 To date,
no research has attempted to integrate empirical findings using
meta-analytic methods. To do so would provide a more rigorous
method for testing the null hypothesis, and also allow for
consideration of the size and consistency of the effects.
Authors have proposed that emotional abuse and neglect
may convey greater risk of bipolar disorder than other forms of
maltreatment such as sexual or physical abuse.5 Comparison of
effect sizes for different forms of adversity might help to clarify
whether specific adversity subtypes are more strongly related to
bipolar symptoms. Meta-analytic approaches might also elucidate
whether childhood adversity is associated with a particular form
of bipolar disorder. Type 1 bipolar disorder is characterised by
periods of mania (episodes of extremely elated mood, arousal
and levels of activity, often in the presence of psychosis), whereas
type 2 disorder presents only attenuated symptoms of mania with
limited impact on functioning (hypomania). Given the evidence
for an association between adversity and severe psychopathologic
disorder, characterised by psychotic symptoms,15 levels of child-
hood adversity may be elevated in patients with type 1 disorder.
Lastly, diagnoses of major depression and schizophrenia appear
more likely in individuals with a history of childhood adversity.15,16
It is possible that childhood maltreatment is related to one particular
form of psychiatric disorder. The final and exploratory aim of this
review was therefore to compare rates of childhood adversity in
individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder with those in people
diagnosed with schizophrenia or major depression.
We examined three a priori hypotheses: first, rates of
childhood adversity would be elevated in samples with bipolar
disorder compared with non-clinical controls; second, effect sizes
for emotional abuse and neglect would be higher than for other
forms of adversity; and third, rates of childhood adversity would
be greater in individuals with type 1 disorder compared with type
2. We made no prediction regarding rates of childhood adversity
in bipolar disorder compared with the other clinical samples.
Method
The review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) standards. A systematic search of four databases
(Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science) identified
peer-reviewed articles published between January 1980 and
October 2014. We used blocks of search terms pertaining to
bipolar disorder (bipolar, mani*, cyclothymi*, manic-depressi*
OR hypomani*) AND childhood adversity (child abuse, physical
abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, emotional abuse,
neglect*, trauma*, advers*, maltreat*, bully*, bullied, victim*
OR parental loss). The search terms were partly adapted from past
reviews,10,11,15 and where possible were ‘exploded’ in the field of
Bipolar Disorder. The search in Web of Science was restricted to
the areas of psychiatry and psychology by field. In addition to the
systematic search, we screened the reference lists of the included
manuscripts and previous reviews.5,9–14,17 We also examined

Relationship between childhood adversity
and bipolar affective disorder: systematic
review and meta-analysis
J. E. Palmier-Claus, K. Berry, S. Bucci, W. Mansell and F. Varese
Background
The relationship between childhood adversity and bipolar
affective disorder remains unclear.
Aims
To understand the size and significance of this effect through
a statistical synthesis of reported research.
Method
Search terms relating to childhood adversity and bipolar
disorder were entered into Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and
Web of Science. Eligible studies included a sample diagnosed
with bipolar disorder, a comparison sample and a
quantitative measure of childhood adversity.
Results
In 19 eligible studies childhood adversity was 2.63 times (95%
CI 2.00–3.47) more likely to have occurred in bipolar disorder
compared with non-clinical controls. The effect of emotional
abuse was particularly robust (OR = 4.04, 95% CI 3.12–5.22),
but rates of adversity were similar to those in psychiatric
controls.
Conclusions
Childhood adversity is associated with bipolar disorder, which
has implications for the treatment of this clinical group.
Further prospective research could clarify temporal causality
and explanatory mechanisms.

Review article
 journal articles citing at least one of the included studies. Where
data were insufficient to assess eligibility or calculate an effect size,
further information was requested from the study’s corresponding
author.
Eligibility criteria
The review included case–control studies (comparing two existing
groups distinguished by a defining outcome, i.e. bipolar status v.
control) and epidemiological (prospective and cross-sectional)
studies, where a quantitative measure of childhood adversity was
administered to individuals with a formal diagnosis of bipolar
disorder according to the DSM (DSM-III or later) or ICD
(ICD-9 or -10). We defined childhood adversity as the experience
of neglect, abuse, bullying or the loss of parents before the age of
19 years. Studies exploring loss through separation (e.g. divorce of
parents), expressed emotion and/or stressful life events occurring
in adulthood (after the age of 18 years) were not included. We
excluded relatively common parenting practices (e.g. spanking,
shouting), as these were assumed to be subject to cultural variability.
Also excluded were case-note reviews that opportunistically assessed
– rather than systematically measured – childhood adversity, owing
to the increased likelihood of response bias. When both 12-month
and lifetime diagnoses were provided, the latter were selected for
effect size extraction.18 Only articles published in peer-reviewed
English-language journals were included in the analysis.
Only studies with at least one eligible control sample were
included. These samples were defined a priori as comprising
healthy individuals without an identified DSM or ICD diagnosis
(in the epidemiological studies, this was defined as respondents
known to be free of the outcome of interest, i.e. bipolar disorder),
and individuals with a DSM or ICD diagnosis of major depression
or non-affective psychosis (e.g. schizophrenia, schizoaffective
disorder, schizophreniform disorder or delusional disorder).
Screening and data extraction
The lead author (J.P.C.) screened articles in three stages: at title
level, abstract level and article level. A third of titles (1800) were
double-rated
separately
by
a
postgraduate
researcher,
with
adequate levels of agreement (95%, k= 0.65). All of the abstracts
(446) were double-rated with similarly high levels of agreement
(87%, k= 0.71). The majority of discrepancies were due to the
primary coder (J.P.C.) being overly inclusive. Two authors
extracted data and calculated effect sizes using a data spreadsheet.
The intraclass correlation (ICC) between the two sets of effect sizes
indicated high levels of agreement (ICC = 0.98, P50.001). For the
four cases where the primary authors were in disagreement, the
wider team arbitrated. Extracted data included study and effect
size descriptors. When possible the authors extracted binary
(e.g. frequency tables, percentages), as opposed to d-family (e.g.
means, standard deviations), effect sizes based on the use of odds
ratio as the overall metric.
Methodological quality
Methodological quality was explored using the Newcastle–Ottawa
Quality Assessment Scale (NOQAS),19 which assesses the selection
and comparability of the samples and the suitability of the
adversity exposures. Gender was selected as the most important
covariate or matching criterion, given the studies showing greater
levels and impact of childhood adversity in women compared with
men.20 Quality ratings were based on the effect sizes of interest,
rather than other analyses reported in the papers. Independent,
masked quality ratings by a postgraduate researcher demonstrated
good interrater reliability with the lead author (ICC = 0.83,
P50.001).
Statistical analysis
We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version two) to compute
effect sizes and conduct the analyses. All effect sizes were
converted to odds ratios to aid interpretation of the results. Effects
were integrated using random effects meta-analysis. Visual
inspection of funnel plots and regression tests of funnel plot
asymmetry (Egger’s test) established the presence of publication
and selection bias. Where selection bias was deemed likely, Duval
& Tweedie’s trim and fill method was employed to identify and
correct for hypothetically missing effects.
The analysis consisted of four stages. In stage one we
considered the overall effects from studies comparing bipolar
and non-clinical samples on measures of childhood adversity. This
analysis focused on the association between childhood adversity
and bipolar disorder regardless of adversity type, and considered
both single (e.g. sexual abuse) and multiple (e.g. sexual and
emotional abuse) exposures. When extracting data in the presence
of more than one measure of adversity we used the most global or
wide-reaching assessment (e.g. total levels of adversity). Where
this information was unavailable, we contacted the corresponding
author of the primary manuscript to request information
regarding an aggregated effect. In the absence of this information,
we calculated separate effect sizes for each type of adversity, which
were then aggregated in the main analysis. The second stage of
analysis examined independent associations between different
types of exposures and bipolar disorder. In the third stage overall
effects were extracted for studies that compared childhood
adversity between samples with type 1 and type 2 bipolar disorder.
Finally, we independently examined differences in childhood
adversity between bipolar disorder and other psychiatric groups
(major depression, schizophrenia).
Some
manuscripts
contained
the
results
of
both
the
unadjusted analyses and those adjusting for covariates. In order
to increase comparability among the eligible studies we included
the unadjusted results in the main analyses and then conducted
a sensitivity analysis with the adjusted effects. In the presence of
multiple levels of adjustment we included the analysis with the
largest number of demographic and/or clinical covariates. The
majority of the aforementioned analyses explored the impact of
childhood adversity generally, rather than the specific effects of
adversity subtypes over and above the other forms of adversity.
Therefore, we did not include effects that examined the impact
of exposures while controlling for other types of childhood
adversity (e.g. Stikkelbroek et al).21 The full review protocol
(CRD42015017201) is available through the PROSPERO website
(http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).
Results
The screening procedure is summarised in Fig. 1 and the
characteristics of the included articles are given in online Table
DS1.18,21–26,28–48 Eleven authors provided clarification or further
information from which to generate an effect size. Only 11 studies
reported the exact prevalence of childhood adversity within
bipolar samples, which ranged from 8% (Laursen et al) to 77%
(Fowke et al), with a weighted average exposure of 10.5%.22,23
This estimate includes parental loss (4 studies), sexual abuse (3
studies) and composite adversity measures (4 studies). Thirteen
case–control and six epidemiological studies were included in
the main analysis. The case–control studies included 1259 cases
and 1118 controls, whereas the epidemiological studies surveyed
over 2.1 million respondents. The epidemiological research
included
three
population-based
cross-sectional
design
studies,21,24,25 two retrospective cohort design studies,18,22 and
one quasi-prospective study.26 The latter examined childhood
455

adversity as a predictor of transition to psychosis over a 3-year
period in adulthood. The cohort design studies linked data on
current diagnosis to registers on parental loss and child protection
status.18,22 The most commonly used assessment of adversity in
the case–control studies (seven studies) was the Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire, a 28-item self-report measure of emotional and
physical abuse, emotional and physical neglect and sexual abuse.27
Measures of childhood adversity in the epidemiological studies
were generally single items derived from validated measures.
Stage one
Stage one investigated the overall association between childhood
adversity and bipolar disorder. Figure 2 shows the ORs for each
of the included studies, and the aggregated effects of childhood
adversity on bipolar disorder. The analysis showed an overall effect
of 2.63 (95% CI 2.00–3.47, P50.001), suggesting that individuals
with bipolar disorder are 2.6 times more likely to have experienced
childhood adversity when compared with a non-clinical control
group. Similar effect sizes were observed for the case–control
(OR = 2.88, 95% CI 2.04–4.06, P50.001) and epidemiological
studies (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.40–3.57, P= 0.001). There was no
significant difference (Q(1) = 0.74, P= 0.391) in the strength of
the effect sizes between the two subgroups.
Heterogeneity analyses
Heterogeneity was examined using the Q-test and I 2 statistics.
Results showed that the strength of the relationship between
childhood adversity and bipolar disorder varied considerably
across studies (Q(18) = 79.53, P50.001), with 77% of the
observed dispersion attributable to true statistical heterogeneity.
This level of heterogeneity is generally thought to be high and
should be considered when interpreting the results.
Selection bias analyses
Regarding publication bias, funnel plots of standard error against
log odds ratios indicated a roughly symmetrical distribution of
studies around the mean effect sizes. When combining the case–
control and epidemiological literature the result of Egger’s test
was non-significant (b = 0.12, s.e.= 1.08, P= 0.456) indicating no
evidence of publication or selection bias. Duval & Tweedie’s trim
and fill found two hypothetical missing studies, which brought the
imputed OR to 2.47 (95% CI 1.8–3.1).
Sensitivity analysis
One-study-removed analysis suggested that the withdrawal of any
particular study would not greatly alter the results. Three of
the epidemiological studies provided effect sizes adjusted for
covariates in addition to unadjusted scores. Repeating the analysis
using adjusted scores yielded similar results (OR = 2.58, 95% CI
1.96–3.36, P50.001) with equivalent levels of statistical hetero-
geneity (Q(18) = 79.2, P50.001, I 2 = 77.27). This was also true
when including only the epidemiological studies in the analysis
(OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.36–3.39, P= 0.001).
Stage two
In stage two we examined associations between specific adversity
subtypes and bipolar disorder. Table 1 shows the results of the
analyses exploring whether specific types of childhood adversity
are elevated in bipolar disorder. Grandin et al and Neeren et al
both reported analyses from the Longitudinal Investigation of
Bipolar Spectrum Disorders project;31,49 we selected information
from the paper by Neeren et al because it specifically reported
effects pertaining to the impact of adversity subtypes. The results
of these separate meta-analyses showed significant effects of all
childhood adversity subtypes, with the exception of parental loss,
on bipolar disorder. Emotional abuse showed the strongest effect
(OR = 4.04, 95% CI 3.12–5.22, P50.001).
Stage three
Differences between bipolar disorder subtypes were studied in
stage three. Four identified studies provided data to compare rates
of childhood adversity across subtypes.32,38,39,47 No significant
difference in childhood adversity was observed between type 1
and type 2 bipolar disorder (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.48–1.81,
P = 0.827; Q(3) = 6.91, P= 0.075, I 2 = 56.58).
Stage four
In stage four we looked at differences between bipolar disorder and
psychiatric controls, major depression and schizophrenia. Data from
11 studies were used to compare rates of childhood adversity in

 Childhood adversity and bipolar disorder
bipolar disorder and major depression (see online Fig. DS1).
Childhood adversity was significantly greater in bipolar disorder
(OR= 1.24, 95% CI 1.02–1.50, P= 0.031), with low levels of statistical
heterogeneity (Q(10)= 12.83, P= 0.233, I2 = 22.08). However, Egger’s
test approached significance (b = 0.75, s.e.= 0.43, P= 0.058),
indicating the possibility of publication bias. After Duval &
Tweedie’s trim and fill adjusted for three hypothetical missing
studies, the imputed OR fell to 1.09 (95% CI 0.88–1.36). Based
on the post hoc hypothesis that the absence of an effect was due to
the type of adversity considered, we repeated the analyses removing
four studies that focused on parental loss. This elevated the effect
size
(OR = 1.54,

1.19–2.00,
P50.001;
Q(6)= 4.30,

adversity in bipolar disorder when compared with major depression.
No hypothetically missing study was detected, with no indication
of publication bias (b = 71.34, s.e.= 1.25, P= 0.166).
No significant difference in rates of childhood adversity was
found when comparing bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in
the analysis of five studies (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–1.01,
P = 0.067; Q(4) = 2.32, P= 0.677, I 2 = 0; see online Fig. DS2).
Egger’s
test
was
non-significant
(b = 70.52,
s.e.= 0.42,
P = 0.152) and no hypothetically missing studies were estimated.
Quality assessment
The NOQAS ratings for the case–control studies are given in
online Table DS2. Generally, the quality of the studies in the
main analysis was adequate, with eight studies employing an
appropriately matched control group and/or controlling for
covariates in the analysis. Only one study failed to substantiate
participants’ diagnoses through interview.23 There was a non-
significant trend of better study quality producing larger effects
(b = 0.22, s.e.= 0.12, 95% CI 70.01 to 0.45; Z = 1.82, P= 0.066)
in the case–control studies. Quality ratings for the case–control
studies included in the secondary analysis were lower than for
those in the main analysis. This was largely due to studies not
controlling for covariates or employing matching criteria. The
majority of the studies included in the secondary analysis
employed
a
rigorous
method
of
ascertaining
diagnoses.
Epidemiological
studies
included
nationally
representative
samples with data obtained through structured interviews or
record linkage; these studies adequately controlled for a range of
covariates in their analyses, including gender.
Discussion
The results of the meta-analysis suggest that individuals with
bipolar disorder are 2.6 times more likely to experience childhood
adversity when compared with a non-clinical control group. This
effect did not appear to be the result of study design or bias, and
remained robust and significant even after controlling for
hypothetically missing studies. The findings should be interpreted
in the context of relatively few longitudinal studies and none with a

prospective cohort design, limiting the ability to make causal
inferences. Nevertheless, there appears to be a strong and significant
association between childhood adversity and bipolar disorder.
We found some variances in this association when specific types
of exposure were analysed separately. Emotional abuse was four
times more likely to have occurred in bipolar disorder groups than
in healthy controls, an effect seemingly larger than for other types of
adversity. This is in contrast to a recent meta-analysis that observed
roughly equivalent effect sizes for adversity subtypes on psychosis.15
Interestingly, parental loss did not significantly differ between bipolar
and non-clinical samples. One explanation is that the impact of losing
a parent is highly dependent on the context and stage at which it
occurs.5 Indeed, research has suggested that younger age at parental
loss, maternal loss in particular and death by unnatural causes are
more strongly associated with a bipolar disorder diagnosis.22,50,51
Refuting our initial hypothesis, the effect of childhood adversity
on type 2 bipolar disorder, compared with type 1 disorder, did
not reach statistical significance. Although the analysis included only
four studies, it is possible that childhood adversity is associated
with both the more severe and attenuated bipolar profiles.
Rates of childhood adversity were significantly greater in
bipolar disorder when compared with major depression. However,
this
effect
became
non-significant
when
controlling
for
hypothetically missing studies. The absence of a stronger effect
may have been due to the overrepresentation of studies considering
parental loss, which did not appear to be elevated in bipolar disorder
more generally. When repeating the analysis without effects
pertaining to parental loss, individuals with bipolar disorder
presented with higher levels of adversity compared with the major
depression group. Nevertheless, it is difficult to draw firm
conclusions concerning the specificity of childhood adversity in
the two disorders.
The results showed no significant difference in the rates of
childhood adversity between individuals diagnosed with bipolar
disorder and those with schizophrenia. A wealth of research has
focused on the role of childhood adversity in the development
of psychosis;15 our findings suggest similar levels of adversity in
bipolar disorder. Interestingly, correlational studies have showed
associations between childhood adversity and psychotic experiences
in bipolar disorder.8 Future research should explore the exact
pathways by which specific forms of adversity lead to particular
symptom clusters.
The analysis revealed high levels of statistical heterogeneity,
which allows for less confidence in the estimated effect sizes, but
is not surprising given the methodological and analytic variances
in the identified studies. For example, measures of childhood
adversity included national registers, questionnaires, survey items
and semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, studies differed in
terms of diagnostic assessments (e.g. the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM Disorders, the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview) and inclusion criteria (e.g. adolescents,
adults), with two studies restricting their analysis to type 1 bipolar
disorder.26,42 Although the analyses allowed for the examination
of some potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g. the impact of
study design), the limited number of identified studies prevented
the authors from testing the impact of other methodological
differences on effect sizes. In the presence of further publications,
future
reviews
might
wish
to
explore
whether
such
methodological and clinical variations moderate the association
between childhood adversity and bipolar disorder.
Study limitations
There are some limitations of this meta-analysis and of the
research
literature
more
generally.
Recall
bias
and
illness
representations
may
confound
retrospective
reporting
of
childhood adversity.17 In the absence of long-term prospective
research it is impossible to reach a definitive conclusion on the
causal link between childhood adversity and bipolar disorder. It
is feasible that, in some cases, early or prodromal symptoms in
childhood might place greater strain on parenting, which could
contribute to dysfunctional relationships. Therefore, a genetic
predisposition to bipolar disorder might increase levels of
childhood adversity. Similarly, we note the absence of studies
carefully examining graded (i.e. dose–response) relationships,
which in conjunction with the investigation of putative biological
and psychosocial mechanisms might enable the identification of
plausible pathogenic pathways linking adversity to bipolar psycho-
pathology. Last, the adversity subtypes were not statistically
independent, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions on
the specificity of adversity subtypes on bipolar disorder.
Clinical implications
Given the association between childhood adversity and bipolar
disorder, practitioners should carefully enquire about their clients’
past adverse experiences, including emotional abuse. Read et al have
provided guidance on how clinicians might conduct these convers-
ations and respond sensitively to and deal with disclosures.52
Identification of childhood adversity should then lead to its
integration into personalised formulations of clients’ difficulties
and the provision of appropriate support and interventions.
In conclusion, childhood adversity appears to be associated
with the development of bipolar disorder. Rates of childhood
adversity in bipolar disorder appear to be similar to those
observed in psychosis and major depression. Researchers should
explore the ways in which childhood adversity interacts with
cognitive, behavioural and biological factors. They should also
investigate the potential impact of alternative forms of adversity such
as bullying and witnessing domestic violence. Further prospective
research exploring dose–response and accounting for genetic effects
would help to elucidate the nature of the relationship between
childhood adversity and bipolar symptoms. The findings have
implications for the study and treatment of bipolar disorder.
