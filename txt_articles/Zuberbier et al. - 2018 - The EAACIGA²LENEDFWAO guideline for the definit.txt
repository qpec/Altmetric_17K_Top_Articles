Abstract
This evidence- and consensus-based guideline was developed following the methods
recommended by Cochrane and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. The conference was held on 1
December 2016. It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European
Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-founded network of
excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA²LEN), the European
Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) with the partic-
ipation of 48 delegates of 42 national and international societies. This guideline was
acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS).
Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease, presenting with wheals, angioedema,
or both. The lifetime prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic
spontaneous urticaria and other chronic forms of urticaria are disabling, impair quality
of life and affect performance at work and school. This guideline covers the definition
and classification of urticaria, taking into account the recent progress in identifying its

 causes, eliciting factors and pathomechanisms. In addition, it outlines evidence-based
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria.

INTRODUCTION
This evidence- and consensus-based guideline was developed follow-
ing the methods recommended by Cochrane and the Grading of Rec-
ommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
working group. A structured consensus process was used to discuss
and agree upon recommendations. The conference was held on 1
December 2016 in Berlin, Germany.
It is a joint initiative of Dermatology Section of the European
Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-
founded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma Euro-
pean Network (GA²LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF),
and the World Allergy Organization (WAO), all of which provided
funding for the development of this updated and revised version of
the EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline on urticaria.1–4 There was
no funding from other sources.
This revision and update of the guidelines were developed by 44
urticaria experts from 25 countries, all of which are delegates of
national and/or international medical societies (Table 1). All of the
societies involved endorse this guideline and have supported its
development by covering the travel expenses for the participation of
their delegate(s) in the consensus conference. The development of
this revision and update of the guideline were supported by a team
of methodologists led by Alexander Nast and included the contribu-
tions of the participants of the consensus conference (see Table 1).
The wide diversity and number of different urticaria subtypes that
have been identified reflect, at least in part, our increasing understand-
ing of the causes and eliciting factors of urticaria as well as the molec-
ular and cellular mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of
this guideline is to provide a definition and classification of urticaria,
thereby facilitating the interpretation of divergent data from different
centres and areas of the world regarding underlying causes, eliciting
factors, burden to patients and society, and therapeutic responsive-
ness of subtypes of urticaria. Furthermore, this guideline provides rec-
ommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in common
subtypes of urticaria. This guideline is a global guideline and takes into
consideration that causative factors in patients, medical systems and
access to diagnosis and treatment vary in different countries.

METHODS
The detailed methods used to develop this revision and update of
the EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/WAO guideline on urticaria are published
as separate methods report, including all GRADE tables.5
In summary, this updated and revised guideline takes into
account
the
Appraisal
of
Guidelines

and
Evaluation
(AGREE II) Instrument6 and the methods suggested by the GRADE
working group. The literature review was conducted using the
methods given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions.7
Experts from 42 societies were nominated to be involved in the
development of the guideline. First, key questions and relevant out-
comes were selected and rated by the experts using an online sur-
vey tool.8 Twenty-three key questions were chosen by 30 members
of the expert panel.
Subsequently, we developed a literature review protocol, which
specified
our
literature
search
strategy,
researchable
questions
(PICO), eligibility criteria, outcomes as chosen by the experts, the risk
of bias assessment, and strategies for data transformation, synthesis
and evaluation.
The systematic literature search was conducted on 1 June
2016 and yielded 8090 hits. Two independent reviewers evaluated
the literature and extracted eligible data. After 2 screening phases,
65 studies were determined to fulfil the inclusion criteria. Wher-
ever
possible,
we
calculated
effect
measures
with
confidence
intervals and performed meta-analyses using Review Manager.9
We assessed the quality of the evidence following GRADE using
GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GDT).10,11 Five criteria
(namely, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and
publication bias) were evaluated for each outcome resulting in an
overall
assessment
of
quality
of
evidence
(Table 2).
Effect
measures such as risk ratios express the size of an effect, and
the quality rating expresses how much trust one can have in a
result.
Subsequently modified evidence-to-decisions (EtD) frameworks
were created to help the experts make a judgement on the
size of the desirable and the undesirable effect, the balance of
the
2,
and
to
provide
an
overview
of
quality.
The
evidence
assessment yielded
31
GRADE
evidence
profiles/evi-
dence-to-decision frameworks. A recommendation for each evi-
dence-based key question was drafted using standardized wording
(Table 3).
In a preconference online voting round, all GRADE tables EtD
frameworks and draft recommendations were presented and voted
on. Of the 41 invited participants (expert panel), 30 completed the
survey (response rate 73%). The results were either fed back to the
expert panel or integrated into the EtD frameworks. All EtD frame-
works and draft recommendations were made available to the partic-
ipants before the consensus conference.

 During the conference, all recommendations were voted on by
over 250 participants, all of whom had to submit a declaration
that they were (i) a specialist seeing urticaria patients and (ii) gave
a declaration of conflict of interest. A nominal group technique
was used to come to an agreement on the different recommenda-
tions.12 The consensus conference followed a structured approach:
presentation of the evidence and draft recommendation, open dis-
cussion, initial voting or collection of alternative wording and final
voting, if necessary. Participants eligible for voting had received
one green and one red card, either of which they held up when
voting for or against a suggested recommendation. Voting results
were documented. Strong consensus was defined as >90% agree-
ment, and 70-89% was documented as consensus. All recommen-
dations passed with a 75% agreement. An internal and an external
review took place.
All consented recommendations are highlighted in grey, and it is
indicated whether these are based on expert opinion (based on con-
sensus) or evidence and expert opinion (based on evidence and con-
sensus).

DEFINITION
3.1
|
Definition
Urticaria is a condition characterized by the development of wheals
(hives), angioedema or both. Urticaria needs to be differentiated
from other medical conditions where wheals, angioedema or both
can occur, for example anaphylaxis, auto-inflammatory syndromes,
urticarial vasculitis or bradykinin-mediated angioedema including
hereditary angioedema (HAE).

We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect.
Moderate
(+++)
We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a
possibility that it is substantially different.
Low (++)
Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low (+)
We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

a fleeting nature, with the skin returning to its normal
appearance, usually within 30 minutes to 24 hours.

1.
a sudden, pronounced erythematous or skin coloured swel-
ling of the lower dermis and subcutis or mucous mem-
branes,
2.
sometimes pain, rather than itch.
3.
a resolution slower than that of wheals (can take up to
72 hours).

Classification of urticaria on the basis of its
duration and the relevance of eliciting factors
The spectrum of clinical manifestations of different urticaria sub-
types is very wide. Additionally, 2 or more different subtypes of urti-
caria can coexist in any given patient.
Acute spontaneous urticaria is defined as the occurrence of
spontaneous wheals, angioedema or both for less than 6 weeks.
How should urticaria be classified?
We recommend that urticaria is classified based on
its duration
as acute (≤ 6 weeks) or chronic (>6 weeks).
We recommend that urticaria is classified as
spontaneous (no specific eliciting factor involved) or
inducible (specific eliciting factor involved).
(consensus-based)

Table 4 presents a classification of chronic urticaria (CU) subtypes
for clinical use. This classification has been maintained from the pre-
vious guideline by consensus (>90%) urticarial vasculitis, maculopapu-
lar cutaneous mastocytosis (formerly called urticaria pigmentosa),
auto-inflammatory syndromes (eg, cryopyrin-associated periodic syn-
dromes or Schnitzler’s syndrome), nonmast cell mediator-mediated
angioedema
(eg,
bradykinin-mediated
angioedema)
and
other
diseases such as syndromes that can manifest with wheals and/or
angioedema are not considered to be subtypes of urticaria, due to
their distinctly different pathophysiologic mechanisms (Table 5).
Should we maintain the current guideline classification of chronic
urticaria?
We recommend that the current
guideline classification of chronic
urticaria should be maintained.

Pathophysiological aspects
Urticaria is a mast cell-driven disease. Histamine and other media-
tors, such as platelet-activating factor (PAF) and cytokines released
from activated skin mast cells, result in sensory nerve activation,
vasodilatation and plasma extravasation as well as cell recruitment to
urticarial lesions. The mast cell-activating signals in urticaria are ill-
defined and likely to be heterogeneous and diverse. Histologically,
wheals are characterized by oedema of the upper and mid dermis,
with dilatation and augmented permeability of the postcapillary
venules, as well as lymphatic vessels of the upper dermis leading to
leakage of serum into the tissue. In angioedema, similar changes
occur primarily in the lower dermis and the subcutis. Skin affected
by wheals virtually always exhibits upregulation of endothelial cell
adhesion molecules, neuropeptides and growth factors and a mixed
inflammatory perivascular infiltrate of variable intensity, consisting of
neutrophils with or without eosinophils, basophils, macrophages and
T cells but without vessel-wall necrosis, which is a hallmark of
urticarial vasculitis.13–17 The nonlesional skin of chronic spontaneous
urticaria (CSU) patients shows upregulation of adhesion molecules,18
infiltrating eosinophils and altered cytokine expression.19 A mild to
moderate increase in mast cell numbers has also been reported by

 some authors. These findings underline the complex nature of the
pathogenesis of urticaria, which has many features in addition to the
release of histamine from dermal mast cells.20–22 Some of these fea-
tures of urticaria are also seen in a wide variety of inflammatory condi-
tions and are thus not specific or of diagnostic value. A search for
more specific histological biomarkers for different subtypes of urticaria
and for distinguishing urticaria from other conditions is desirable.23

Burden of disease
The burden of CU for patients, their family and friends, the healthcare
system and society is substantial. The use of patient-reported outcome
measures such as the urticaria activity score (UAS), the angioedema
activity score (AAS), the CU quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL),
the angioedema quality of life questionnaire (AE-QoL) and the urticaria
control test (UCT) in studies and clinical practice has helped to better
define the effects and impact of CU on patients.24 The available data
indicate that urticaria markedly affects both objective functioning and
subjective well-being.25–27 Previously, O’Donnell et al showed that
health status scores in CSU patients are comparable to those reported
by patients with coronary artery disease.28 Furthermore, both health
status and subjective satisfaction in patients with CSU are lower than
in healthy subjects and in patients with respiratory allergy.29 CU also
has considerable costs to patients and the society.30–32

DIAGNOSIS OF URTICARIA
4.1
|
Diagnostic work up in Acute Urticaria
Acute urticaria usually does not require a diagnostic workup, as it is
usually self-limiting. The only exception is the suspicion of acute
urticaria due to a type I food allergy in sensitized patients or the
existence of other eliciting factors such as nonsteroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs). In this case, allergy tests as well as educating
the patients may be useful to allow patients to avoid re-exposure to
relevant causative factors.
Should routine diagnostic measures be performed in acute urticaria?
We recommend against any routine diagnostic
measures in acute spontaneous urticaria.

The diagnostic work up in CU
The diagnostic work up of CSU has 3 major aims: (i) to exclude differ-
ential diagnoses, (ii) to assess disease activity, impact and control and
(iii) to identify triggers of exacerbation or, where indicated, any under-
lying causes. Ad (1) Wheals or angioedema can be present in some
other conditions, too. In patients who display only wheals (but no
angioedema), urticarial vasculitis and auto-inflammatory disorders
such as Schnitzler syndrome or cryopyrin-associated periodic syn-
dromes (CAPS) need to be ruled out. On the other hand, in patients
who suffer only from recurrent angioedema (but not from wheals),
bradykinin-mediated angioedema-like angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema or other nonmast cell-related
angioedema, that is HAE type 1-3, should be considered as differen-
tial diagnoses (Figure 1). Ad (2) Baseline assessment of disease activ-
ity (UAS, AAS), quality of life (CU-Q2oL, AE-QoL) and disease control
(UCT) are indispensable for guiding treatment decisions, providing
better insights into the patients’ disease burden, as well as facilitating,
improving and standardizing the increasingly important documenta-
tion work (see also section on Assessment of disease activity, impact,
and control). Ad (3) History taking is essential in patients with urti-
caria, as exacerbating triggers are variable. Further diagnostic proce-
dures to reveal underlying causes in patients with long-standing and
uncontrolled disease need to be determined carefully.
In the last decades, many advances have been made in identify-
ing causes of different types and subtypes of urticaria, for example
in CSU.33–35 Among others, autoimmunity mediated by functional
auto-antibodies directed against the high-affinity IgE receptor or
IgE-auto-antibodies
to
auto-antigens,
pseudo-allergy
(nonallergic
hypersensitivity reactions) to foods or drugs, and acute or chronic
infections (eg, Helicobacter pylori or Anisakis simplex) have been
described as causes of CU (Table 6). However, there are consider-
able variations in the frequency of underlying causes in the different
studies. This also reflects regional differences in the world, for
example differences in diets and the prevalence of infections. Thus,
it is important to remember that not all possible causative factors
need to be investigated in all patients, and the first step in diagnosis
is a thorough history, taking the following items into consideration:
1. Time of onset of disease
2. Shape, size, frequency/duration and distribution of wheals
3. Associated angioedema
4. Associated symptoms, for example bone/joint pain, fever,
abdominal cramps
5. Family and personal history regarding wheals and angioedema
6. Induction by physical agents or exercise
7. Occurrence in relation to daytime, weekends, menstrual cycle,
holidays and foreign travel
8. Occurrence in relation to foods or drugs (eg, NSAIDs, ACE-
inhibitors)
9. Occurrence in relation to infections, stress
10. Previous or current allergies, infections, internal/autoimmune
diseases, gastric/intestinal problems or other disorders
11. Social and occupational history, leisure activities
12. Previous therapy and response to therapy including dosage
and duration
13. Previous diagnostic procedures/results
The second step of the diagnosis is the physical examination of
the patient. Where it is indicated by history and/or physical examina-
tion, further appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed. The
selection of these diagnostic measures largely depends on the nature
of the urticaria subtype, as summarized in Figure 1 and Table 6.

2. Patients should be asked for a detailed family history and age of disease onset. 3. Test for elevated inflammation markers (C-reactive
protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), test for paraproteinemia in adults, look for signs of neutrophil-rich infiltrates in skin biopsy; perform
gene mutation analysis for hereditary periodic fever syndromes (eg, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome), if strongly suspected. 4. Patients
should be asked: “For how long does each individual wheal last?”. 5. Test for complement C4, C1-INH levels and function; in addition, test for
C1q and C1-INH antibodies, if AAE is suspected; do gene mutation analysis, if former tests are unremarkable but patient’s history suggests
hereditary angioedema. 6. If there is no remission after 6 months of ACE-inhibitor discontinuation C1-inhibitor should be tested for. 7. Does
the biopsy of lesional skin show damage of the small vessels in the papillary and reticular dermis and/or fibrinoid deposits in perivascular and
interstitial locations suggestive of urticarial vasculitis? 8. Patients should be asked: “Can you make your wheals come? Can you bring out your
wheals?”. 9. In patients with a history suggestive of inducible urticaria standardized provocation testing according to international consensus
recommendations69 should be performed. 10. Acquired auto-inflammatory syndromes include Schnitzler0s syndrome as well as systemic-onset
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD); hereditary auto-inflammatory syndromes include Cryopyrin-associated
periodic syndromes (CAPS) such as familial cold auto-inflammatory syndromes (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) and neonatal-onset
multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), more rarely hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS) and tumour necrosis factor receptor alpha-associated
periodic syndrome (TRAPS). 11. In some rare cases, recurrent angioedema is neither mast cell mediator-mediated nor bradykinin-mediated, and
the underlying pathomechanisms remain unknown. These rare cases are referred to as “idiopathic angioedema” by some authors.

Intensive and costly general screening programs for causes of
urticaria are strongly advised against. The factors named in Table 6
in the extended programme should only be investigated based on
patient history. Type I allergy is an extremely rare cause of CSU. In
contrast, pseudo-allergic (nonallergic hypersensitivity reactions) to
NSAIDs or food may be more relevant for CSU. Diagnosis should be
based on history of NSAID intake or a pseudo-allergic elimination
diet protocol. Bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal infections, for exam-
ple with H. pylori, streptococci, staphylococci, Yersinia, Giardia lam-
blia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, hepatitis viruses, norovirus, parvovirus

 different patient groups and different geographical regions. For
example, Anisakis simplex, a sea fish nematode, has only been dis-
cussed as a possible cause of recurrent acute spontaneous urticaria
in areas of the world where uncooked fish is eaten frequently.39,40
The relevance of H. pylori, dental or ear, nose and throat infections
also appears to vary between patient groups.38,41–44 More research
is needed to make definitive recommendations regarding the role of
infection in urticaria.
Routine screening for malignancies in the diagnosis of underlying
causes for urticaria is not suggested. Although it is noted that a
slightly increased prevalence has been reported in Taiwan,45 there is
not sufficient evidence available for a causal correlation of urticaria
with neoplastic diseases. Ruling out malignancies is, however, war-
ranted if patient history (eg, sudden loss of weight) points to this.
Currently, the only generally available tests to screen for auto-
antibodies against either IgE or FceR1 (the high-affinity IgE receptor)
are the autologous serum skin test (ASST) and basophil activation
tests (BATs). The ASST is a nonspecific screening test that evaluates
the presence of serum histamine-releasing factors of any type, not
just histamine-releasing auto-antibodies. The ASST should be per-
formed with utmost care as infections might be transmitted if, by
mistake, patients were injected with someone else’s serum. The sub-
ject is further elucidated in a separate EAACI/GA2LEN position
paper.46,47
BATs assess histamine release or upregulation of activation
markers of donor basophils in response to stimulation with the
serum of CSU patients. BATs can help to co-assess disease activity
in patients with urticaria 48,49 as well as to diagnose autoimmune
urticaria.50 Furthermore, BAT can be used as a marker for respon-
siveness to ciclosporin A or omalizumab.51,52
In some subjects with active CSU, several groups have noted
blood basopenia and that blood basophils exhibit suppressed IgE
receptor-mediated histamine release to anti-IgE. Blood basophils are
detected in skin lesions of CSU patients.19 CSU remission is associ-
ated with increases in blood basophil numbers and IgE receptor-trig-
gered histamine response.53,54 A rise in basophil number is also
observed during anti-IgE treatment 55 This finding, however, needs
to be examined in future research and currently does not lead to
diagnostic recommendations. However, it should be noted that a low
basophil blood count should not result in further diagnostic proce-
dures. It is also known that levels of D-dimer are significantly higher
in patients with active CSU and decrease according to the clinical
response of the disease to omalizumab. The relevance of this finding
is not yet clear, and currently, it is not recommended to measure D-
dimer levels.56,57

Assessment of disease activity impact and
control
Disease activity in spontaneous urticaria should be assessed both in
clinical care and trials with the UAS7 (Table 7), a unified and simple
scoring system that was proposed in the last version of the guidelines
and has been validated.58,59 The UAS7 is based on the assessment of
key urticaria signs and symptoms (wheals and pruritus), which are
documented by the patient, making this score especially valuable.
The use of the UAS7 facilitates comparison of study results from dif-
ferent centres. As urticaria activity frequently changes, the overall
disease activity is best measured by advising patients to document
24-h self-evaluation scores once daily for several days. The UAS7,
that is the sum score of 7 consecutive days, should be used in routine
clinical practice to determine disease activity and response to treat-
ment of patients with CSU. For patients with angioedema, a novel
activity score, the angioedema activity score (AAS) has been devel-
oped and validated.60 In addition to disease activity, it is important to
assess the impact of disease on quality of life as well as disease con-
trol both in clinical practice and trials. Recently, the urticaria control
test (UCT) has become valuable in the assessment of patients’ disease
status.61,62 The UCT was developed and validated to determine the
level of disease control in all forms of CU (CSU and CIndU). The UCT
has only 4 items with a clearly defined cut-off for patients with “well-
controlled” vs “poorly controlled” disease, and it is thus suited for the
management of patients in routine clinical practice. The cut-off value
for a well-controlled disease is 12 of 16 possible points. This helps to
guide treatment decisions.
Patients should be assessed for disease activity, impact and con-
trol at the first and every follow up visit, acknowledging that some
tools, for example the UAS can only be used prospectively and
others, for example the UCT, allow for retrospective assessment.
Validated instruments such as the UAS7, AAS, CU-Q2oL, AE-QoL
and UCT should be used in CU for this purpose.

The diagnostic work up in CIndU
In CIndUs, the routine diagnostic work up should follow the consen-
sus recommendations on the definition, diagnostic testing and man-
agement of CIndUs.69 Diagnostics in CIndU are used to identify the
subtype of CIndU and to determine trigger thresholds.69 The latter is
important as it allows for assessing disease activity and response to
treatment. For most types of CIndU, validated tools for provocation
testing are meanwhile available.69 Examples include cold and heat
urticaria,
where

pressure urticaria. In cholinergic urticaria, a graded provocation test
with office-based methods, for example pulse-controlled ergometry,
is available.66,73 Patients with contact urticaria or aquagenic urticaria
should be assessed by appropriate cutaneous provocation tests.69

Diagnosis in children
Urticaria can occur in all age groups, including infants and young
children. Although data for childhood CSU are still sparse, recent
investigations indicate that the prevalence of CIndUs and CSU, and
underlying causes of CSU are very similar to the prevalence and
causes in adults, with some minor differences.74–77
Thus, the diagnostic approaches for children should be similar to
those in adults.
The diagnostic work up of CSU in children has the same aims as
in adults: (i) differential diagnoses should be excluded with a special
focus on cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). CAPS is a
rare disease with a urticaria-like rash that manifests in childhood.78
(ii) If possible, that is depending on the age of the child, disease
activity, impact and control should be assessed using assessment
tools similar to those used in adults, although it has to be noted that
no validated disease-specific tools for children are available as of
now. (iii) Triggers of exacerbation should be identified and, where
indicated, underlying causes, which appear to be similar to those in
adults, should be searched for. In children with CIndU, similar tests
for provocation and the determination of trigger thresholds should
be performed.

MANAGEMENT OF URTICARIA

Basic considerations
1. The goal of treatment is to treat the disease until it is gone.
2. The therapeutic approach to CU can involve
a.
the identification and elimination of underlying causes,
b.
the avoidance of eliciting factors,
c.
tolerance induction, and/or
d.
the use of pharmacological treatment to prevent mast cell
mediator release and/or the effects of mast cell mediators
3. Treatment should follow the basic principles of treating as much
as needed and as little as possible. This may mean stepping up
or stepping down in the treatment algorithm according to the
course of disease.
Should treatment aim at complete symptom control in urticaria?
We recommend aiming at complete symptom
control in urticaria, considering as much as
possible the safety and the quality of life of each
individual patient. (consensus-based)

Identification and elimination of underlying
causes and avoidance of eliciting factors
To eliminate an underlying cause, an exact diagnosis is a basic pre-
requisite. The identification of a cause in CU is, however, difficult in
most cases, for example infections may be a cause, aggravating fac-
tor or unrelated. The only definite proof of a causative nature of a
suspected agent or trigger is the remission of symptoms following
elimination and recurrence of symptoms following re-challenge in a
double-blind provocation test. Spontaneous remission of urticaria
can occur any time, the elimination of a suspected cause or trigger
can also occur coincidentally.
5.2.1

Drugs
When these agents are suspected in the course of diagnostic work
up, they should be omitted entirely or substituted by another class
of agents if indispensable. Drugs causing nonallergic hypersensitivity
reactions (the prototypes being NSAIDs) cannot only elicit, but can
also aggravate pre-existing CSU,79 so that elimination in the latter
case will only improve symptoms in some patients.

Physical stimuli
Avoidance of physical stimuli for the treatment of CIndUs is desir-
able, but mostly very difficult to achieve. Detailed information
about the physical properties of the respective stimulus should
make the patient sufficiently knowledgeable to recognize and con-
trol exposure in normal daily life. Thus, for instance, it is important
in delayed pressure urticaria and in symptomatic dermographism to
point out that pressure is defined as force per area and that simple
measures, such as broadening of the handle of heavy bags for pres-
sure urticaria or reducing friction in case of symptomatic dermo-
graphism, may be helpful in the prevention of symptoms. Similar
considerations hold for cold urticaria where the impact of the wind
chill factor in cold winds needs to be remembered. For solar urti-
caria, the exact identification of the range of eliciting wavelengths
may be important for the appropriate selection of sunscreens or for
the selection of light bulbs with an UV-A filter. However, in many
patients, the threshold for the relevant physical trigger is low and
total avoidance of symptoms is virtually impossible. For example,
severe symptomatic dermographism is sometimes confused with
CSU because seemingly spontaneous hives are observed where
even loose-fitting clothing rubs on the patient’s skin or uninten-
tional scratching by patients readily causes the development of
wheals in that area.
5.2.3
|
Eradication of infectious agents and
treatment of inflammatory processes
In contrast to CIndU, CSU is often reported to be associated with a
variety of inflammatory or infectious diseases. This is regarded as
significant in some instances, but some studies show conflicting
results and have methodological weaknesses. These infections, which
should be treated appropriately, include those of the gastrointestinal
tract like H. pylori infection or bacterial infections of the nasophar-
ynx80 (even if association with urticaria is not clear in the individual
patient and a meta-analysis shows overall low evidence for eradica-
tion therapy,80 H. pylori should be eliminated as an association with
gastric cancer is suggested81). Bowel parasites, a rare possible cause
of CSU in developed industrial countries, should be eliminated if
indicated.80,82 In the past, intestinal candidiasis was regarded as a
highly important underlying cause of CSU,80 but more recent find-
ings fail to support a significant causative role.83 Apart from infec-
tious diseases, chronic inflammatory processes due to diverse other
diseases have been identified as potentially triggering CSU. This
holds particularly for gastritis, reflux oesophagitis or inflammation of
the bile duct or gall bladder.84,85 However, similar to infections, it is
not easily possible to discern whether any of these are relevant
causes of CSU but should be treated as many of them may be also
associated with development of malignancies.
5.2.4
|
Reduction of physical and emotional stress
Although the mechanisms of stress-induced exacerbation are not
well investigated, some evidence indicates that disease activity and
severity are correlated with stress levels.86 This holds true for emo-
tional stress as well as physical stress which in some entities can be
relevant for the development of symptoms such as in cholinergic
urticaria.87
5.2.5
|
Reduction in functional auto-antibodies
Direct reduction in functional auto-antibodies by plasmapheresis has
been shown to be of temporary benefit in some, severely affected
patients.88 Due to limited experience and high costs, this therapy is
suggested for auto-antibody-positive CSU patients who are unre-
sponsive to all other forms of treatment.
5.2.6
|
Dietary management
IgE-mediated food allergy is extremely rarely the underlying cause of
CSU.84,89 If identified, the specific food allergens need to be omitted
as far as possible which leads to a remission within less than
24 hours. In some CSU patients, pseudo-allergic reactions (non-IgE-
mediated hypersensitivity reactions) to naturally occurring food
ingredients
and
in
some
cases
to
food
additives
have
been
observed.84,89–93 A pseudoallergen-free diet, containing only low
levels of natural as well as artificial food pseudoallergens, has been
tested in different countries 94 and also a low histamine diet may
improve symptoms in those patients.95 Those diets are controversial
and as yet unproven in well-designed double-blind placebo-con-
trolled studies. However, when used, they must usually be main-
tained for a minimum of 2-3 weeks before beneficial effects are
observed. However, it should be pointed out that this kind of treat-
ment requires cooperative patients and success rates may vary con-
siderably due to regional differences in food and dietary habits.
More research is necessary on the effect of natural and artificial
ingredients of food in causing urticaria.
5.3
|
Inducing tolerance
Inducing tolerance can be useful in some subtypes of urticaria.
Examples are cold urticaria, cholinergic urticaria and solar urticaria,
where even a rush therapy with UV-A has been proven to be effec-
tive within 3 days.96 However, tolerance induction is only lasting for
a few days, and thus, a consistent daily exposure to the stimulus just
at threshold level is required. Tolerance induction and maintenance
are often not accepted by patients, for example in the case of cold
urticaria where daily cold baths/showers are needed to achieve this.

Symptomatic pharmacological treatment
A basic principle of the pharmacological treatment is to aim at com-
plete symptom relief. Another general principle in pharmacotherapy
is to use as much as needed and as little as possible. The extent and
selection of medication may therefore vary in the course of the dis-
ease.
The main option in therapies aimed at symptomatic relief is to
reduce the effect of mast cell mediators such as histamine, PAF and
others on the target organs. Many symptoms of urticaria are medi-
ated primarily by the actions of histamine on H1-receptors located
on endothelial cells (the wheal) and on sensory nerves (neurogenic
flare and pruritus). Thus, continuous treatment with H1-antihista-
mines is of eminent importance in the treatment of urticaria (safety
data are available for use of several years continuously). Continuous
use of H1-antihistamines in CU is supported not only by the results
of clinical trials97,98 but also by the mechanism of action of these
medications, that is that they are inverse agonists with preferential
affinity for the inactive state of the histamine H1-receptor and stabi-
lize it in this conformation, shifting the equilibrium towards the inac-
tive state.
However, other mast cell mediators (PAF, leukotrienes, cytoki-
nes) can also be involved and a pronounced cellular infiltrate includ-
ing basophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils may be observed.99
These may respond completely to a brief burst of corticosteroid and
may be relatively refractory to antihistamines.
These general considerations on pharmacotherapy refer to all
forms of acute and chronic urticaria. The difference between sponta-
neous urticaria and CIndU is, however, that in some forms of physi-
cal
urticaria,
for
example
cold
urticaria
instead
of
continuous
treatment, on-demand treatment may be useful. In particular, if the
patient knows of a planned trigger such as expected cold exposure,
when going for a swim in summer, the intake of an antihistamine
2 hours prior to the activity may be sufficient.
Antihistamines have been available for the treatment of urticaria
since the 1950s. The older first-generation antihistamines have pro-
nounced anticholinergic effects and sedative actions on the central
nervous system (CNS) and many interactions with alcohol and drugs
affecting the CNS, such as analgesics, hypnotics, sedatives and mood
elevating drugs, have been described. They can also interfere with
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and impact on learning and perfor-
mance. Impairment is particularly prominent during multi-tasking and
performance of complex sensorimotor tasks such as driving. In a
GA²LEN position paper,100 it is strongly recommended not to use
first-generation antihistamines any longer in allergy both for adults
and especially in children. This view is shared by the WHO guideline
ARIA.101 Based on strong evidence regarding potential serious side
effects of old sedating antihistamines (lethal overdoses have been
reported), we recommend against the use of these sedating antihis-
tamines for the routine management of CU as first-line agents,
except for the rare places worldwide in which modern 2nd-genera-
tion antihistamines are not available. The side effects of first-genera-
tion
H1-antihistamines
are
most pronounced for promethazine,
diphenhydramine, ketotifen and chlorphenamine and are well under-
stood. They penetrate the blood-brain barrier, bind to H1-receptors
in the CNS and interfere with the neurotransmitter effects of his-
tamine. Positron-emission tomography (PET) studies document their
penetration into the human brain and provide a new standard
whereby CNS H1-receptor occupancy can be related directly to
effects on CNS function.102
The development of modern 2nd-generation antihistamines led to
drugs which are minimally or nonsedating and free of anticholinergic
effects. However, 2 of the earlier modern 2nd-generation drugs,
astemizole and terfenadine, which were essentially pro-drugs requir-
ing hepatic metabolism to become fully active, had cardiotoxic
effects if this metabolism was blocked by concomitant administration
of inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme, such as
ketoconazole or erythromycin. These 2 drugs are no longer available
in most countries, and we recommend that they are not used.
Further progress with regard to drug safety has been achieved in
the last few decades with a considerable number of newer modern
2nd-generation antihistamines.102 Not all antihistamines have been
tested specifically in urticaria, but many nonsedating antihistamines
studies are available, for example cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofe-
nadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, ebastine, rupatadine and bilastine.
Modern 2nd-generation antihistamines should be considered as the
first-line symptomatic treatment for urticaria because of their good
safety profile. However, up to date, well-designed clinical trials com-
paring the efficacy and safety of modern 2nd-generation H1-antihis-
tamines in urticaria are largely lacking.
Are 2nd-generation H1-antihistamines to be preferred over 1st-
generation H1-antihistamines for the treatment of chronic urticaria?
We suggest 2nd-generation H1-antihistamines over
1st-generation H1-antihistamines for the treatment
of patients with chronic urticaria. (evidence-based

There are studies showing the benefit of a higher dosage of 2nd-

earlier studies which came to the same conclusion employing first-
generation antihistamines.106,107 This has been verified in studies

In summary, these studies suggest that the majority of patients
with urticaria not responding to standard doses will benefit from up-
dosing of antihistamines. Modern 2nd-generation antihistamines at
licensed doses are first-line treatment in urticaria and up-dosing is
second-line treatment (Figure 2).
Is an increase in the dose to fourfold of modern 2nd-generation H1-
antihistamines useful and to be preferred over other treatments in
urticaria (second-line treatment)?
We suggest up-dosing 2nd-generation H1-

Recommended treatment algorithm for urticaria*
Chronic urticaria treatment algorithm. This algorithm was voted on after finishing all separate GRADE questions taking into consideration the existing consensus. It was decided that omal-
izumab should be tried before ciclosporin A since the latter is not licensed for urticaria and has an inferior profile of adverse effects. In addition: A short course of glucocorticosteroids may
be considered in case of severe exacerbation. Other treatment options are available, see Table 9. >90% consensus.
First line = High-quality evidence: Low cost and worldwide availability (eg, modern 2nd-generation antihistamines exist also in developing
countries mostly cheaper than old sedating antihistamines), per daily dose as the half life time is much longer, very good safety profile, good

izumab, in CU, is effective at doses from 150 to 300 mg per month.
Dosing is independent of total serum IgE.112 The recommended dose
in CSU is 300 mg every 4 weeks. The licensed doses and treatment
duration vary between different countries.

Ciclosporin A also has a moderate, direct effect on mast cell
mediator release.130,131 Efficacy of ciclosporin A in combination with
a modern 2nd-generation H1-antihistamine has been shown in pla-
cebo-controlled trials 132–134 as well as open controlled trials 135 in
CSU, but this drug cannot be recommended as standard treatment
due to a higher incidence of adverse effects.133 Ciclosporin A is off-
label for urticaria and is recommended only for patients with severe
disease refractory to any dose of antihistamine and omalizumab in
combination. However, ciclosporin A has a far better risk/benefit
ratio compared with long-term use of steroids.

Comment by the authors: as shown in the consensus-based treatment
algorithm (Figure 2), which was voted on later, it was decided that
omalizumab should be tried before ciclosporin A as the latter is not
licensed for urticaria and has an inferior profile of adverse effects.
Some previous RCTs have assessed the use of leukotriene recep-
tor antagonists. Studies are difficult to compare due to different
populations studied, for example inclusion of only aspirin and food
additive intolerant patients or exclusion of ASST-positive patients. In
general, the level of evidence for the efficacy of leukotriene receptor
antagonists in urticaria is low but best for montelukast.
Are leukotriene antagonists useful as add-on treatment in patients
unresponsive to high doses of H1-antihistamines?
We cannot make a recommendation with respect to
montelukast as add-on treatment to H1-
antihistamines in patients with chronic urticaria
unresponsive to H1-antihistamines. (evidence-
based and consensus-based)

At present, topical corticosteroids are frequently and successfully
used in many allergic diseases, but in urticaria topical steroids are
not helpful (with the possible exception of pressure urticaria on soles
as alternative therapy with low evidence). If systemic corticosteroids
are used, doses between 20 and 50 mg/day for prednisone are
required with obligatory side effects on long-term use. There is a
strong recommendation against the long-term use of corticosteroids
outside specialist clinics. Depending on the country, it must be noted
that steroids are also not licensed for CU (eg, in Germany pred-
nisolone is only licensed for acute urticaria). For acute urticaria and
acute exacerbations of CSU, a short course of oral corticosteroids,
that is treatment of a maximum of up to 10 days, may, however, be
helpful to reduce disease duration/activity.136,137 Nevertheless, well-
designed RCTs are lacking.
Should oral corticosteroids be used as add-on treatment in the
treatment of urticaria?
We recommend against the long-term use of
systemic glucocorticosteroids in CU. (consensus-

While antihistamines at up to quadruple the manufacturers’ recom-
mended dosages will control symptoms in a large part of patients with
urticaria in general practice, alternative treatments are needed for the
remaining unresponsive patients. Before changing to an alternative ther-
apy, it is recommended to wait for 1-4 weeks to allow full effectiveness.
As the severity of urticaria may fluctuate, and spontaneous
remission may occur at any time, it is also recommended to re-evalu-
ate the necessity for continued or alternative drug treatment every
3-6 months.
Except for omalizumab and ciclosporin A, which both have
restrictions due to their high cost, many of the alternative methods
of treatment, such as combinations of modern 2nd-generation H1-
antihistamines with leukotriene receptor antagonists, are based on
clinical trials with low levels of evidence (Table 9). Based on the
level of evidence, the recommended third-line and fourth-line treat-
ment options are thus limited (see algorithm figure 2).
H₂-antagonists and dapsone, recommended in the previous ver-
sions of the guideline, are now perceived to have little evidence to
maintain them as recommendable in the algorithm but they may still
have relevance as they are very affordable in some more restricted
healthcare systems. Sulphasalazine, methotrexate, interferon, plasma-
pheresis,
phototherapy,
intravenous immunoglobulins
(IVIG/IGIV)
and other treatment options have low-quality evidence, or just case
series have been published2 (Table 9). Despite the lack of published
evidence, all these drugs may be of value to individual patients in
the appropriate clinical context.138
Are H2-antihistamines useful as add-on treatment in patients
unresponsive to low or high doses of H1-antihistamines?

the combined use of H1-and H2-antagonists in
patients with chronic urticaria. (evidence-based and

 Antagonists of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)139 and
IVIG/IGIV,140–143 which have been successfully used in case reports,
are recommended currently only to be used in specialized centres as
last option (ie, anti-TNF-alpha for delayed pressure urticaria and
IVIG/IGIV for CSU).144,145
For the treatment of CSU and symptomatic dermographism, UV-
B (narrow-band UV-B, TL01), UV-A and PUVA treatment for 1-
3 months can be added to antihistamine treatment.146–148
Some treatment alternatives formerly proposed have been shown
to be ineffective in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and should
no longer be used as the grade of recommendation is low. These
include tranexamic acid and sodium cromoglycate in CSU,149,150
nifedipine in symptomatic dermographism/urticaria factitia 151 and col-
chicine and indomethacin in delayed pressure urticaria.152,153 However,
more research may be needed for patient subgroups, for example
recently Ref.154 a pilot study of patients with elevated D-dimer levels
showed heparin and tranexamic acid therapy may be effective.
Could any other treatment options be recommended as third-line
treatment in urticaria?
We cannot make a recommendation with respect

Children
Many clinicians use first-generation, sedating H1-antihistamines as
their first choice in the treatment of children with allergies assuming
that the safety profile of these drugs is better known than that of
the modern 2nd-generation H1-antihistamines due to a longer experi-
ence with them. Also, the use of modern 2nd-generation H1-antihis-
tamines is not licensed for use in children less than 6 months of age
in many countries while the recommendation for the first-generation
H1-antihistamines is sometimes less clear as these drugs were
licensed at a time when the code of good clinical practice for the
pharmaceutical industry was less stringent. As a consequence, many
doctors choose first-generation antihistamines which, as pointed out
above, have a lower safety profile compared with modern 2nd-gen-
eration H1-antihistamines. A strong recommendation was made by
the panel to discourage the use of first-generation antihistamines in
infants and children. Thus, in children, the same first-line treatment
and up-dosing (weight and age adjusted) is recommended as in
adults. Only medications with proven efficacy and safety in the pae-
diatric population should be used. Cetirizine,155 desloratadine,156,157
fexofenadine,158 levocetirizine,159 rupatadine,160 bilastine161 and lor-
atadine155 have been well studied in children, and their long-term
safety has been well established in the paediatric population. In addi-
tion, the choice of the modern 2nd-generation H1-antihistamines in
children depends on the age and availability as not all are available
as syrup or fast dissolving tablet suitable for children. The lowest
licensed age also differs from country to country. All further steps
should be based on individual considerations and be taken carefully
as up-dosing of antihistamines and further treatment options are not
well studied in children.
Should the same treatment algorithm be used in children?
We suggest using the same treatment algorithm
with caution in children with chronic urticaria.

Pregnant and lactating women
The same considerations in principle apply to pregnant and lactating
women. In general, use of any systemic treatment should generally
be avoided in pregnant women, especially in the first trimester. On
the other hand, pregnant women have the right to the best therapy
possible. While the safety of treatment has not been systematically
studied in pregnant women with urticaria, it should be pointed out
that the possible negative effects of increased levels of histamine
occurring in urticaria have also not been studied in pregnancy.
Regarding treatment, no reports of birth defects in women having
used modern 2nd-generation antihistamines during pregnancy have
been reported to date. However, only small sample size studies are
available for cetirizine162 and one large meta-analysis for lorata-
dine.163 Furthermore, as several modern 2nd-generation antihistami-
nes are now prescription free and used widely in both allergic

 rhinitis and urticaria, it must be assumed that many women have
used these drugs especially in the beginning of pregnancy, at least
before the pregnancy was confirmed. Nevertheless, as the highest
safety is mandatory in pregnancy, the suggestion for the use of mod-
ern 2nd-generation antihistamines is to prefer loratadine with the
possible extrapolation to desloratadine and cetirizine with a possible
extrapolation to levocetirizine. All H1-antihistamines are excreted in
breast milk in low concentrations. Use of second-generation H1-anti-
histamines is advised, as nursing infants occasionally develop seda-
tion from the old first-generation H1-antihistamines transmitted in
breast milk.
The increased dosage of modern 2nd-generation antihistamines
can only be carefully suggested in pregnancy as safety studies have
not been carried out, and with loratadine it must be remembered
that this drug is metabolized in the liver which is not the case for its
metabolite desloratadine. First-generation H1-antihistamines should
be avoided.100 The use of omalizumab in pregnancy has been proven
to be safe and to date there is no indication of teratogenicity.164–166
All further steps should be based on individual considerations, with a
preference for medications that have a satisfactory risk-to-benefit
ratio in pregnant women and neonates with regard to teratogenicity
and embryotoxicity. For example, ciclosporin, although not terato-
genic, is embryo-toxic in animal models and is associated with pre-
term delivery and low birth weight in human infants. Whether the
benefits of ciclosporin in CU are worth the risks in pregnant women
will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, all
decisions should be re-evaluated according to the current recom-
mendations published by regulatory authorities.
Should the same treatment algorithm be used in pregnant women and
during lactation?
We suggest using the same treatment algorithm
with caution both in pregnant and lactating women
after risk-benefit assessment. Drugs
contraindicated in pregnancy should not be used.
