Tumor-associated antigens have emerged as important immu-
notherapeutic targets in the fight against cancer. Germline
tumor antigens, such as WT1, Wilms’ tumor gene 1, are over-
expressed in many human malignancies but have low expres-
sion in somatic tissues. Recent vaccination approaches to target
WT1 have been hampered by poor in vivo immune potency,
likely due to the conserved self-antigen nature of WT1. In
this study, we use a novel synthetic micro-consensus SynCon
DNA vaccine approach with the goal of breaking tolerance
and increasing vaccine immune potency. This approach
induced new, neo-antigen-like responses that were superior
to those induced by native WT1 DNA immunogens for driving
T cell immunity and breaking tolerance. Non-human primates
(NHPs) vaccinated with SynCon WT1 antigens elicited im-
mune responses against native rhesus WT1 peptides. When
delivered by electroporation (EP) in mice, SynCon-based
WT1 constructs elicited strong CD4 and CD8 T cell responses
(including IFN-g, CD107a, and TNF-a) to both native and
consensus peptides. In addition, SynCon WT1 vaccine-induced
antibodies recognized native WT1 in vitro. Vaccination with
the SynCon WT1 immunogens was capable of slowing tumor
growth in therapeutic models in vivo. These data support
the further study of synthetic consensus DNA vaccines for
breaking tolerance to important germline antigens.
INTRODUCTION
Major advances in the field of immune therapy have unveiled power-
ful approaches that harness a patient’s immune system to target can-
cer. Several therapies exist to elicit a de novo T cell immune response
against tumor-associated antigens. These include peptide-, DNA-, or
cell-based vaccines, such as PROVENGE, a dendritic cell vaccine for
men with castration-resistant prostate cancer that was the first U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic cancer
vaccine.1 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy has proven highly
effective in patients with B cell lymphoblastic leukemia.2 Additional
therapies include checkpoint blockade inhibitors, such as PD-1 and
CTLA-4, which remove inhibitory signals to allow T cells to react
to tumor neo-antigens and induce tumor shrinkage.3 However,
many patients lack T cells that are already primed to tumor-associ-
ated antigens and thus require initiation of a de novo immune
response.
A study by the National Cancer Institute compiled a list of poten-
tially attractive tumor antigens based on several criteria, including
immunogenicity, therapeutic function, and tumor specificity.4
Many of these tumor-associated antigens are considered germline
antigens, because they are expressed highly in germ tissues, absent
in somatic tissues, and aberrantly activated in human malignancies.
For many of these germline antigens, chimeric antigen receptor
therapy is not possible because of the lack of cell surface expression
of the antigen, and T cell receptor (TCR)-based cellular approaches
are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restricted and cannot be
used for most patients. Vaccine-based approaches for these targets
are therefore important. However, a major challenge for vaccines
targeting germline cancer antigens is breaking tolerance to these
self-antigens.
The No. 1 tumor antigen that emerged from the National Cancer
Institute list was Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT1). WT1 protein is a self-an-
tigen whose expression is upregulated during embryogenesis but is
maintained at lower levels in adult tissues, such as the kidney,
spleen, heart, and gonadal cells.5 WT1 is known to bind to and tran-
scriptionally regulate a number of genes, including insulin growth
factor 2 (IGF2), platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A), and
transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1), as well as itself.6 Aside
from being a known transcription factor, WT1 is mutated or over-
expressed in Wilms’ tumor, an embryonic tumor of the kidney, as
well as in most types of adult leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia,
glomerular diseases, and various solid tumors, including lung,
pancreatic, thyroid, breast, testicular, and ovarian carcinomas and
melanoma.7,8

 Because of its importance as an immune therapy target, many pep-
tide-based vaccination approaches have been developed for WT1.
Several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted
WT1 epitopes have been identified with high binding affinity to
HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*2402 in leukemia patients.8–12 Peptide
vaccines derived from these epitopes, alone or in combination with
Montanide ISA-51, have elicited CD8+ T cell responses and anti-tu-
mor activity in some patients with leukemia, lung, breast disease, glio-
blastoma, various sarcomas, mesothelioma, or pancreatic cancer in
early-phase human clinical trials.8,13–20
Although these peptide vaccines have shown some clinical results in
early testing, this therapeutic approach is limited because of MHC
class or HLA haplotype restrictions in the patient population.
Furthermore, peptide vaccines are limited in their ability to activate
CD4+ T helper responses and many fail to produce long-term mem-
ory responses against antigens. Another vaccination approach that is
not HLA restricted is DNA vaccination. This platform has many ad-
vantages for cancer immune therapy; however, its immune perfor-
mance in the past has been poor.21 In this regard, we have shown
that optimized DNA vaccines delivered by electroporation (EP) can
elicit potent T cell responses against tumor antigens in mice, non-hu-
man primates (NHPs), and humans and that such vaccines in hu-
mans can reverse neoplastic disease.22–24
Although there have been a few attempts to target WT1 by DNA vac-
cine technologies, the results of these prior studies achieved mixed
results. Tsuboi and colleagues immunized mice with full-length
mouse WT1 plasmid DNA intramuscularly and were able to elicit
WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, as well as
prolonged survival of mice challenged with WT1-expressing tumor
cells.25 However, later studies resorted to toxoid fusion constructs to
break tolerance against the encoded epitopes and improve on low
native T cell-induced responses to achieve improved immune
response in an epitope-specific fashion.26 A more recent study by
Tan and colleagues showed that a full-length native WT1 DNA vac-
cine was capable of inducing an immune response in mice but
offered little protection in a mesothelioma tumor challenge model.27
The only existing clinical trial using DNA vaccination to target WT1
used an epitope-based vaccine, which is HLA restricted (NCT:
NCT01334060). Thus, there is a need for vaccine approaches tar-
geting WT1 to enhance the diversity of patient populations who
can benefit.
In prior studies, matched peptides, a toxoid epitope fusion, or a full-
length native murine WT1 was used. Such an immunogen likely has
limited capacity to break tolerance for both MHC class I and MHC
class II responses against this self-antigen. We therefore sought to
improve this vaccine design strategy by introducing mutations in
the self-antigen to generate a broader immune target with an
improved immune response profile that can induce both CD4 and
CD8 T cell responses, an important issue for induction of memory
responses. It has been suggested that introduction of mutations in
self can induce auto-immunity; however, this strategy has not
been broadly applied to current anti-cancer vaccines, and methods
for rationally approaching this issue are not in routine study.28
Furthermore, for many antigens, the choice of mutations is un-
clear.29 We thus developed a synthetic consensus (SynCon)
approach in which protein sequences from various species are
compared to create a consensus sequence with enhanced capacity
to break tolerance, without altering protein structure. Here, we
show that our SynCon vaccines targeting WT1 are vastly superior
at breaking tolerance compared to a native murine WT1 vaccine,
including a codon-optimized version. We also performed matrix
mapping to determine which specific mutated epitopes have the
ability to break tolerance. Finally, when mice were challenged with
tumor cells, animals vaccinated with the SynCon WT1 constructs
were able to control tumor challenge, showing reduced tumor
burden and increased survival compared to unvaccinated animals.
These results support further use of the SynCon technology for
additional tumor-associated antigens to break tolerance and elicit
an anti-tumor response.
RESULTS
Design and Construction of WT1 DNA Vaccines
In an effort to break tolerance and generate a robust immune
response against the WT1 self-antigen, we generated highly opti-
mized SynCon DNA sequences. Specifically, we analyzed and aligned
16 divergent WT1 protein sequences from the NCBI database to
generate a consensus sequence from this collection that shares
96.6% identity with human native WT1. Considering the potential
safety issues, we either engineered eight mutations in the first two
zinc fingers (four mutations per zinc finger) to abolish its DNA-bind-
ing specificity (SynConWT1-L) or removed all four zinc fingers from
our SynCon sequence (SynConWT1-S) (Figure 1A; Figure S1A).30
The final SynConWT1-L and SynConWT1-S proteins share 94.7%
and 95.2% sequence identities with human germline WT1 protein,
and these two antigens share 92.5% and 92.4% sequence identities
with mouse native WT1 protein, respectively. Thus, this sequence
represents a consensus sequence for humans, mice, and NHPs. We
further modified the WT1 consensus sequence by adding a synthetic
immunoglobulin E (IgE) leader sequence to the N terminus as previ-
ously described.31 The synthetic full-length WT1 gene with mutated
zinc fingers (SynConWT1-L) was 1,314 bp in length, and the synthetic
WT1 gene lacking the C-terminal zinc fingers (SynConWT1-S) was
936 bp in length. In addition, we developed two mouse WT1 con-
structs encoding the mouse native WT1 protein: pMuWT1-opt con-
tains a codon- and RNA-optimized full-length mouse WT1 gene with
an IgE leader sequence and a Kozak sequence at the N terminus
(1,404 bp in length), while pMuWT1-nonopt contains a full-length
non-optimized mouse WT1 gene (1,350 bp in length).
Expression of WT1 DNA Vaccines
To verify the expression of each WT1 construct, human rhabdomyo-
sarcoma (RD) cells were transiently transfected with each construct
and expression was analyzed by immunoblotting with a commercial
WT1 antibody. Although the RD cells show no basal expression of
WT1, the cells transfected with pMuWT1-opt, pMuWT1-nonopt,

 pSynConWT1-L, and pSynConWT1-S expressed WT1 (Figure 1B;
Figure S1B). Because WT1 is expressed in the kidneys, HEK293T
cell lysate was used as a positive control. Expression of WT1 by
each construct was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence anal-
ysis in RD cells transiently transfected with each construct and then
stained with a commercial WT1 antibody (Figure 1C; Figure S1C).
As a control, expression was not detected in the cells transfected
with the empty expression vector, pGX0001.
pSynConWT1-S and pSynConWT1-L DNA Vaccines Induce WT1-
Specific T Cell Responses Using Matched Consensus Peptides
To determine whether pSynConWT1-S and pSynConWT1-L were
immunogenic in mice, C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated intramuscu-
larly, followed by EP with pMuWT1-nonopt, pMuWT1-opt,
pSynConWT1-L, or pSynConWT1-S DNA constructs (Figure 2A).
We then performed interferon g (IFN-g) ELISpots using peptides
matched to the SynCon antigen sequences (Figure 2B; Figure S2A).
As expected, pMuWT1-nonopt and pMuWT1-opt did not elicit
immune responses against consensus peptides (Figure 2B). How-
ever, pSynConWT1-S and pSynConWT1-L DNA vaccine induced
robust cellular immune responses against consensus peptides
of roughly 1,200 spot-forming units (SFUs) per 106 splenocytes
for pSynConWT1-S and 800 SFUs per 106 splenocytes for
pSynConWT1-L (Figure 2B; Figure S2A). Characterization of the
cellular immune responses using a library of consensus WT1 peptides,
consisting of 17 matrix pools, revealed that 9 of 17 consensus matrix
pools showed more than 20 SFUs per 106 splenocytes in mice immu-
nized with pSynConWT1-S and 10 of 17 consensus matrix pools
showed more than 20 SFUs per 106 splenocytes in mice immunized
with pSynConWT1-L (Figure 2C; Figure S2B), corresponding to
20 epitope-comprising peptides for pSynConWT1-S (Figure 2D)
and30epitope-comprisingpeptidesforpSynConWT1-L(FigureS2C).
Previous studies have identified the following immunodominant
WT1 peptide epitopes: WT137–45 (VLDFAPPGA), WT1126–134
(RMFPNAPYL),
and
WT1235–243
(CMTWNQMNL)
in
hu-
mans.8,26,32,33 Our analyses identified that the immunodominant
human WT1126–134 epitope elicited strong T cell responses after
pSynConWT1-S DNA vaccination in mice and that all three of these
human epitopes elicited strong T cell responses after pSynConWT1-L
DNA vaccination, indicating that similar immunodominant epitopes
may be displayed by both mouse and human MHCs (highlighted
in italics in Figure 2D; Figure S2C). 20 additional epitope-comprising
peptides for pSynConWT1-S and 25 additional epitope-comprising
peptides for pSynConWT1-L were identified in our matrix mapping
(Figure 2D; Figure S2C). Overall, responses to consensus peptides
occurred

 corresponding mouse sequence, with multiple point mutations per
epitope or large insertions or deletions (Figure 2D; Figure S2C).
pSynConWT1-S and pSynConWT1-L DNA Vaccines Can Break
Tolerance to Native Mouse WT1
To assess whether our SynConWT1-S DNA vaccine can break toler-
ance against the germline antigen WT1, we vaccinated C57BL/6 mice
intramuscularly, followed by EP with pMuWT1-nonopt, pMuWT1-
opt, pSynConWT1-L, or pSynConWT1-S (Figure 3A; Figure S3A).
We performed IFN-g ELISpots using peptides generated from the
native mouse WT1 sequence (mouse-matched peptides). The results
reveal that vaccination with pSynConWT1-S induces strong cellular
immune responses against mouse-matched peptides (�200 SFUs
per 106 splenocytes), whereas pMuWT1-nonopt or pMuWT1-opt
do not (Figure 3B). This indicates that our SynCon-designed antigens
are able to induce a neo-antigen-like response that can break toler-
ance against germline antigens.
We next determined the specific epitopes in the native mouse WT1
that elicited cellular immune responses after DNA vaccination with
pSynConWT1-S or pSynConWT1-L by performing matrix mapping.
We performed IFN-g ELISpots using 18 matrix pools from the library

 of mouse-matched peptides. We found that 7 of 18 mouse-matched
matrix pools showed greater than 20 SFUs per 106 splenocytes for
pSynConWT1-S and 9 of 18 matrix pools showed this for
SynConWT1-L (Figure 3C), indicating that these vaccines can
elicit immune responses to a range of epitopes. From these
pSynConWT1-S matrix pools, we identified ten epitope-comprising
peptides (Figure 3D). These epitope-comprising peptides include
the WT1126–134 epitope identified in patient samples and new immu-
nodominant epitope-containing peptides that have not been previ-
ously described.8,26,32,33 The epitope-comprising peptides for both
pSynConWT1-S and pSynConWT1-L within the native mouse
sequence are highly homologous to the SynCon sequence, with
zero to two point mutations per peptide. These results highlight the
versatility of the synthetic constructs to break tolerance and induce
a strong immune response.
Vaccination with pSynConWT1-S Enhances the Cytokine
Production in CD8 T Cells
To further characterize the responses induced by pSynConWT1-S,
we performed intracellular cytokine staining to measure the
expression or secretion of IFN-g, CD107a, and tumor necrosis fac-
tor alpha (TNF-a) in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Developing the
CD4 immune response is highly relevant to the generation of long-
term memory response. The average frequency of CD8+IFN-g+
and CD8+TNF-a+ cells in response to consensus peptide stimula-
tion in pSynConWT1-S immunized mice was significantly higher

 than that of the pMuWT1-nonopt group or the pMuWT1-opt
group (Figure 4A). The average frequency of CD8+IFN-g+ cells
in response to native peptides was also significantly higher
in pSynConWT1-S immunized mice compared to naive or
pMuWT1-opt groups (Figure 4B). We next assessed cytotoxic po-
tential in vaccinated versus naive mice by quantifying the transient
surface expression of CD107a, a marker of cytolytic degranulation
on CD8+ T cells. In response to consensus peptide stimulation, we
detected significantly higher percentages of CD8+CD107a+ T cells
in mice vaccinated with pSynConWT1-S compared to those vacci-
nated with pMuWT1-nonopt or pMuWT1-opt (Figure 4A). We
also
observed
a
trend
toward
higher
CD8+CD107a+IFN-g+
T cells in mice vaccinated with pSynConWT1-S in response to
native peptides compared to naive mice, although this trend was
not statistically significant (Figure 4B).
We further evaluated cytokine production in CD4+ cells from the
immunized mice. We observed an increase in the production of
IFN-g and TNF-a in CD4+ cells in the immunized mice, which
was highest in the pSynConWT1-S group in response to consensus
peptides (Figure 4A). We also observed an increase in CD4+TNF-
a+ responses to native peptides in pSynConWT1-S splenocytes
compared to naive or pMuWT1-opt splenocytes (Figure 4B). Overall,
the responses were much higher in the CD8+ compartment, suggest-
ing that immune responses elicited by pSynConWT1-S are skewed
toward CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes.
Vaccination with pSynConWT1-S Induces Robust Antibody
Responses
The induction of antibody responses is dependent on CD4 T cell im-
munity. We next examined these responses as a measure of breaking
tolerance in the CD4 and B cell compartment. To detect vaccine-
induced WT1-specific antibodies, we performed ELISA on mouse
sera collected 1 week following the last vaccination. As shown in Fig-
ure 5A, only vaccination with pSynConWT1-S, but not pMuWT1-
nonopt or pMuWT1-opt, was capable of generating WT1-specific
Figure 4. CD4 and CD8 Cytokine Responses to Consensus and Mouse WT1 Peptides for pSynConWT1-S Vaccine

peptides (B) for 5 hr. Background-subtracted percentages of WT1-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells producing CD107a, IFN-g, and TNF-a were calculated. Error bars represent
the average ± SEM.

 antibodies, consistent with a helper T cell response. Furthermore, sera
from mice vaccinated with pSynConWT1-S or, to a lesser extent,
pMuWT1-opt were able to recognize WT1 protein expressed natu-
rally in HEK293T cell lysates, confirmed using western blot
(Figure 5B).
To determine whether these vaccine-induced antibodies could recog-
nize native WT1 expressed on human tumors, we performed immu-
nohistochemical analysis on clinical samples of human renal, ovarian,
cervical, lung, and skin cancers (Figure 5C). We compared staining
performed with sera from naive mice, sera from pSynConWT1-S
vaccinated mice, and a commercial WT1 antibody (Figure 5C). We
observed strong staining of the clinical samples with the WT1 com-
mercial antibody and the pSynConWT1-S vaccinated mouse sera,
but not with the naive mouse sera (Figure 5C). Thus, WT1-specific
antibodies induced by pSynConWT1-S vaccination react with human
tumor samples.
Vaccination with pSynConWT1-S or pSynConWT1-L Elicits
Therapeutic Antitumor Immunity
To determine whether pSynConWT1-S or pSynConWT1-L could
elicit an immune response against WT1-expressing tumors, we
conducted an in vivo therapeutic study. We first challenged mice
with 1 � 106 acute myeloid leukemia cells (mWT1-C1498).
Three days after tumor implantation, mice were immunized with
pSynConWT1-S or pSynConWT1-L at 1-week intervals (Figure 6A;
Figure S4A). Every mouse exhibited tumor growth, but the tumors
in the pSynConWT1-S or pSynConWT1-L immunized mice were
significantly smaller than those of naive from day 14 to day 28 (Fig-
ures 6A and 6C; Figure S4A). Furthermore, although all naive mice
were euthanized due to tumor burden on or before day 28, 70% of
the pSynConWT1-S and pSynConWT1-L mice survived 28 days
after tumor implantation (Figure 6B; Figure S4B). We next
examined whether our pSynConWT1-S vaccine could induce supe-
rior anti-tumor responses compared to the pMuWT1-opt vaccine.

Molecular Therapy
982 Molecular Therapy Vol. 25 No 4 April 2017
 We performed a similar in vivo therapeutic tumor study, in which we
immunized mice 3 days after tumor implantation at 1-week intervals.
Although the pSynConWT1-S vaccine significantly attenuated tumor
growth and prolonged survival of the mice, the pMuWT1-opt vaccine
did not have any significant anti-tumor effect compared to control
mice (Figures S5A and S5B). Overall, vaccination with the synthetic
constructs pSynConWT1-S and pSynConWT1-L slowed tumor
growth and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice.
Vaccine-Induced WT1-Specific Immune Responses Break
Tolerance in Rhesus Macaques
The matrix mapping assays in Figures 2 and Figure S2C revealed that
the pSynConWT1-L construct showed increased breadth of re-
sponses compared to the pSynConWT1-S construct. Therefore, we
sought to determine the level of immune responses induced by
pSynConWT1-L in NHPs, rhesus macaques. Human native WT1
shares 99.5% sequence identity with NHP native WT1; thus, this
model is ideal for assessing whether our pSynConWT1-L construct
is capable of breaking tolerance. We vaccinated NHPs with our
full-length construct, pSynConWT1-L, four times at 4-week intervals
(Figure 7A). We performed the IFN-g ELISpot assay using the pre-
bleed samples to establish the background level of immune response
for individual animal in the study (Figure 7A). To determine whether
these NHPs induced a response against native rhesus WT1 protein,
we stimulated the week 14 NHP peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) with native rhesus peptides and performed an IFN-g
ELISpot assay. As shown in Figure 7B, four of five NHPs showed re-
sponses in non-cultured ELISpot assays to the native peptides,
ranging from �50 to 1,500 SFUs per 106 PBMCs (Figure 7B). No
apparent signs of toxicity or adverse effects were observed in the
NHPs, as assessed by attending animal care staff (Table S1). These re-
sults further illustrate that the SynCon DNA vaccination approach is
capable of breaking tolerance and inducing a neo-antigen-like
response in a species that closely resembles humans.
DISCUSSION
A surge in interest to develop effective therapeutic cancer vaccines
sparked an effort by the National Cancer Institute to compile a list
of cancer antigens with high priority for therapeutic development.4
Criteria for these antigens included immunogenicity, oncogenicity,
specificity, and expression level in tumor cells. Because these tumor
antigens are self-antigens, immunogenicity remains a limiting factor
for immune therapy development. There has thus been recent interest
in identifying tumor-specific somatic mutations that lead to

 presentation of new epitopes on MHC class I or MHC class II that are
recognized as foreign by the host immune system. These neo-antigens
are patient specific, and CD4+ T cells can respond to these mutated
epitopes to elicit tumor regression.34,35 Furthermore, adoptive trans-
fer of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) and successful check-
point blockade cancer immunotherapy are both thought to elicit
tumor rejection that is mediated by recognition of tumor-specific
neo-antigens.36,37 Peptide- and RNA-based vaccines against these
tumor-specific neo-antigens have shown anti-tumor immunity in
mouse models.34,36 However, these vaccination approaches are highly
patient specific and typically target passenger mutations—mutations
that do not contribute to the fitness of a clone—that are not necessary
for survival of the tumor cells. Furthermore, not all patients have so-
matic mutations that are capable of eliciting an immune response.38
Here, we describe a novel approach for targeting the germline tumor
antigen WT1 using a SynCon DNA vaccine platform that is capable of
eliciting a neo-antigen-like immune response jointly against MHC
class I and class II epitopes carried in tumor antigens of relevance.
Previous efforts to develop a peptide- or DNA-based vaccine for
WT1 yielded mixed results, with MHC restriction and limited immu-
nogenicity.8,25,27 Our laboratory has reported that DNA vaccines
delivered by EP are effective in generating strong cytotoxic T lympho-
cyte responses in animals and humans.22–24 However, this is our first
report of novel SynCon sequences in the context of self-tumor anti-
gens that are able to break tolerance to both mouse and rhesus
WT1 native antigens.
It has been appreciated for decades that tumor cells exposed to muta-
gens are more immunogenic and that immunization with these
mutagenized tumor cells can induce protection against the parental
tumor cells.39 One study showed that mutagenesis of a DNA encoding
a self-antigen was sufficient to induce auto-immune responses, but
only one self-reactive DNA clone was identified per 239 randomly
generated mutations.28 In addition, this response was dependent on
both MHC class I and MHC class II presentation, suggesting CD4
T cell help is required for the full self-antigen response. Conversely,
another study reported that immunization with xenogeneic DNA
was sufficient to induce auto-immunity even in the absence of
MHC class II molecules because of the formation of a dominant het-
eroclitic epitope.40 This is also in contrast to rationally designed DNA
vaccines intended to specifically enhance antigen processing and pre-
sentation, which depend only on CD8 cells, not CD4 help.29 This
dependence on CD4 help may depend on the specific antigen or
epitope and on the strength of the existing interaction between the
TCR and MHC-peptide complex. It is likely that responses against
MHC peptides with lower presentation frequency or lower affinity
for the TCR will be more likely to require MHC class II presentation
and CD4 T cell help, consistent with the notion that most auto-im-
mune disorders result from aberrant MHC class II presentation.41
Our intracellular cytokine staining illustrated the induction of
WT1-specific CD4+ T cells and to a greater extent CD8+ T cells
upon vaccination with our SynCon WT1 DNA vaccine.
In our vaccine design approach, we introduced 23 amino acid changes
into the 312 amino acid sequence of WT1-S. We were able to generate
auto-immune responses to 10 of the 51 epitope-comprising peptides,
which typically occurred for peptides that were minimally altered. We
also generated responses against self-peptides that were not mutated
in our consensus vaccine design. These responses were not observed

 upon vaccination with the native antigen, indicating that mutations in
self can induce epitope spreading to non-mutated epitopes in the
same protein.
Previous studies and WT1 clinical trials have focused specifically on
two human WT1 epitopes: WT1126–134 and WT1235–243.33,42,43 Our
peptide mapping studies revealed that our SynCon WT1 DNA vac-
cines were able to elicit some previously identified human immuno-
dominant epitopes in mice, as well as some new immunodominant
WT1 epitopes, which contributed to the robust immune response
seen in mice and suggests that delivery of multiple epitopes could
expand the diversity of T cell responses and improve clinical efficacy.
Matrix mapping studies also revealed that synthetic sequences that
were highly divergent from the native mouse sequence were able to
elicit an immune response; however, these sequences were less effec-
tive at breaking tolerance and inducing auto-immunity. Sequences
that were highly homologous, with only one or two point mutations
per 15-mer, were able to elicit the best response against native WT1
peptides. Thus, this novel SynCon technology using consensus se-
quences that share 92%–95% homology with the native antigen is
able to induce a neo-antigen-like response against the germline anti-
gen WT1 to enhance T cell recognition of WT1 epitopes and elicit an
anti-tumor response. Further studies to potentially improve these im-
mune responses will include combination therapy with immune
plasmid adjuvants such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and combination
therapies with immune checkpoint blockade. In addition, future
studies expanding on this consensus vaccine design concept will focus
on determination of additional details for the optimal levels of diver-
gence and sequence elements required for robust immune responses.
These data have implications for antigen development targeting
diverse germline cancer immune therapy targets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
WT1 DNA Immunogen Design and Construction
The consensus WT1 immunogen was designed by generating a
consensus sequence using 16 GenBank WT1 sequences collected
from human and lower animals, such as rhesus macaque, mouse,
and rat. The consensus sequence was obtained after performing mul-
tiple alignment by ClustalW. No additional mutations were added to
the sequence, with the exception of mutations introduced to inactivate
the function of WT1. The consensus sequence was sub-cloned into
the pGX0001 expression vector and designated pSynConWT1-S
(lacking terminal zinc fingers) or pSynConWT1-L (with mutated
terminal zinc fingers). WT1 constructs encoding the native mouse
WT1 protein (NP_659032) were also made. All plasmids were codon
and RNA optimized with an IgE leader sequence and a Kozak
sequence at the N terminus, with the exception of the pMuWT1-non-
opt plasmid, which only contains a full-length non-optimized mouse
WT1 gene.
Immunoblot and Immunofluorescence
Human RD cells were cultured in complete DMEM with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and transfected using TurboFectin
8.0 (OriGene) transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s
protocol. 48 hr later, cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. Western blot analysis was performed with
an anti-WT1 monoclonal antibody (ab89901) and visualized with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglob-
ulin G (IgG) using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western
blot analysis system (GE Amersham).
For indirect immunofluorescence, RD cells were plated on two-well
chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and transfected (1 mg/well) using
TurboFectin 8.0 (OriGene) transfection reagent. 48 hr after transfec-
tion, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed using paraformaldehyde
and permeabilized for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with
anti-WT1 monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cat. No. ab89901) at a
1:500 dilution for 60 min at room temperature. The slides were
then incubated with the Alexa 555-(phalloidin)-conjugated anti-rab-
bit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 60 min and
analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DM4000B) using the
SPOT Advanced Software program.
Mice and Immunization
Female 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson
Laboratory. Their care was in accordance with the guidelines of
the NIH, the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and the Wistar Institute
IACUC. Mice were divided into groups and immunized with
25 mg of each plasmid by intramuscular (i.m.) injection into the
tibialis interior (TA) muscle, followed by EP using the CELLECTRA
adaptive constant current EP device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals). Two
0.1-A constant current square-wave pulses were delivered through a
triangular three-electrode array consisting of 26-gauge solid stain-
less steel electrodes. Each pulse was 52 ms in length with a 1-s delay
between pulses. The mice received a total of four immunizations
given 2 weeks apart.
ELISpot Assay
Two sets of peptides, the first spanning the entire mouse native WT1
protein sequence and the second spanning the consensus WT1 pro-
tein sequence, each containing 15 amino acid residues overlapping
by 8 amino acids, were synthesized from GenScript. Mouse IFN-g
ELISpot assay (R&D Systems) was performed according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Splenocytes were stimulated with peptides (at
a concentration of 2 mg/mL/peptide), complete culture medium
(negative control), or concanavalin A (5 mg/mL, positive control)
for 24 hr. The average number of spot-forming cells (SFCs) was
adjusted to 1 � 106 splenocytes. The samples were analyzed in tripli-
cate from two independent experiments.
For epitope mapping studies, all WT1 peptides were pooled into
matrix pools (17 for consensus and 18 for mouse native WT1), and
IFN-g ELISpot assay was performed as described earlier.
Intracellular Cytokine Staining
Splenocytes were stimulated with peptides for 5 hr at 37�C, 5% CO2.
Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and complete medium were used as

 controls. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
anti-mouse CD107a as a marker for degranulation. Following incuba-
tion, the cells were first stained with ViViD Dye (LIVE/DEAD Fixable
Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit; Invitrogen, L34955), and then washed and
stained with the following extracellular antibodies: APC-Cy7 anti-
mouse CD3e, PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD4, and APC anti-mouse
CD8a (BD Biosciences). Cells were then permeabilized and washed
with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences). Intracellular cyto-
kines were subsequently stained with the following antibodies: Alexa
Fluor 700 anti-mouse IFN-g and PE-Cy7 anti-mouse TNF (BD Bio-
sciences). Cells were then washed, fixed, and acquired using an LSR II
flow cytometer with BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences), and
analyzed with FlowJo software.
WT1-Specific Antibody Determination
The measurement of IgG antibodies specific for native mouse WT1
was performed by ELISA in both immunized and control mice. The
plates were coated with 1.0 mg/mL of WT1 protein (MyBiosource),
and standard ELISA was carried out. The mathematical formula
used to calculate the endpoint titer cutoffs is expressed as the standard
deviation multiplied by a factor that was based on the number of
negative controls (naive sera) (n = 5) and the confidence level
(95%). The endpoint titer is reported as the reciprocal of the last dilu-
tion that remained above the endpoint cutoff.
Immunohistochemistry
Human cancer tissue sections—cervical, ovarian, melanoma, renal,
and lung—were obtained from the Tumor Tissue and Biospecimen
Bank at the University of Pennsylvania and were previously reviewed
by a pathologist. Tissue sections were de-paraffinized with xylene and
then rehydrated through graded alcohols to water. Endogenous
peroxidase was blocked using BLOXALL (Vector Laboratories), and
for antigen retrieval, slides were microwaved in 10 mM sodium citrate
(pH 6.0) for 10 min and then allowed to cool at room temperature for
20 min. Slides were then treated with horse serum albumin to block
nonspecific staining and immunostained using anti-WT1 polyclonal
antibodies (Abcam Cat. No. ab89901) and sera obtained from WT1
vaccinated mice by the avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase method
(Vectastain Elite ABC Kit). A slide incubated with naive mouse sera
was used as a negative control. The incubation with the primary anti-
body was performed at 4�C overnight in a moisture chamber. After
the treatment with biotinylated secondary antibody, the slide-
mounted sections were stained with diaminobenzidine with hydrogen
peroxide and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Tumor Challenge
mWT1-C1498, a murine leukemia cell line expressing native mouse
WT1 and syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice, was provided by Dr. H.
Sugiyama (Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine).19
mWT1-C1498 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL
streptomycin (Mediatech), 0.5 mg/mL G418, and 50 mM 2-mercap-
toethanol (Invitrogen) in a 37�C incubator with 5% CO2.
Ten male 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were injected with 1 � 106
mWT1-C1498 cells subcutaneously into the right flank. Mice were
immunized weekly beginning 3 days post-implantation for a total
of three vaccinations. Tumors were measured once a week thereafter,
with digital calipers spanning the shortest (width) and longest
(length) surface diameters as previously described. Tumor volumes
were calculated according to the following formula: V = length �
width 2 � p/6. Mice were sacrificed when the tumor diameter
reached 20 mm.
NHP Studies
Five rhesus macaques were vaccinated with pSynConWT1-L, four
times intramuscularly, followed by EP using the CELLECTRA adap-
tive constant current EP device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals), 4 weeks
apart, at 2 mg DNA per immunization at a 0.5-A current and three
52-ms pulses. Blood was collected 2 weeks after each immunization,
and PBMCs were isolated by standard Ficoll-Hypaque density
gradient centrifugation. Monkey IFN-g ELISpots were conducted
on isolated PBMCs. Antigen-specific responses were determined by
subtracting the number of spots in the negative control wells from
the wells containing peptides.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was determined using a standard, two-tailed
Student’s t test for experiments in which two experimental groups
were compared. For experiments containing more than two experi-
mental groups, one-way ANOVA was performed, followed by multi-
ple comparison using Tukey’s honest SD (HSD) test. Differences were
considered statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05. All
statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software.
