 of tobacco products, are critical to reducing tobacco-related 
diseases and deaths in the United States.§
NATS is a stratified, random-digit–dialed landline and cel-
lular telephone survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults aged 
≥18 years. The 2013–2014 NATS included 75,233 respondents 
(70% landline, 30% cellular); the overall response rate was 
36.1% (landline 47.6%, cellular 17.1%). Based on established 
conventions regarding patterns of tobacco product use (3), 
NATS questions used varying thresholds of lifetime use to 
separate established users from experimenters and nonusers. 
Four tobacco product types assessed in NATS had lifetime 
usage thresholds: cigarettes (≥100 cigarettes); cigars/cigarillos/
filtered little cigars (≥50 times); regular pipes (≥50 times); and 
chewing tobacco/snuff/dip (≥20 times). Water pipes/hookahs, 
e-cigarettes, snus, and dissolvable tobacco products did not 
have usage thresholds. Respondents who met the respective 
thresholds for cigarettes, cigars/cigarillos/filtered little cigars,

While significant declines in cigarette smoking have occurred 
among U.S. adults during the past 5 decades, the use of emerg-
ing tobacco products* has increased in recent years (1–3). To 
estimate tobacco use among U.S. adults aged ≥18 years, CDC 
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data 
from the 2013–2014 National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS). 
During 2013–2014, 21.3% of U.S. adults used a tobacco 
product every day or some days, and 25.5% of U.S. adults 
used a tobacco product every day, some days, or rarely. Despite 
progress in reducing cigarette smoking, during 2013–2014, 
cigarettes remained the most commonly used tobacco product 
among adults. Young adults aged 18–24 years reported the 
highest prevalence of use of emerging tobacco products, includ-
ing water pipes/hookahs and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). 
Furthermore, racial/ethnic and sociodemographic differences 
in the use of any tobacco product were observed, with higher 
use reported among males; non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic 
blacks, and non-Hispanics of other races†; persons aged 
<45 years; persons living in the Midwest or South; persons with 
a General Educational Development (GED) certificate; per-
sons who were single/never married/not living with a partner 
or divorced/separated/widowed; persons with annual house-
hold income <$20,000; and persons who were lesbian, gay, 
or bisexual (LGB). Population-level interventions that focus 
on all forms of tobacco product use, including tobacco price 
increases, high-impact anti-tobacco mass media campaigns, 
comprehensive smoke-free laws, and enhanced access to help 
quitting tobacco use, in conjunction with FDA regulation

* Emerging tobacco products are non-cigarette tobacco products that have gained 
increasing popularity and use within the U.S. market over the past decade.
† Three race/ethnic groups (American Indians/Alaska natives, non-Hispanic; 
Native Hawaiians/other Pacific Islanders, non-Hispanic; and persons of multiple 
race, non-Hispanic) were combined into one category of “other, non-Hispanic” 
because sample sizes were too small to provide statistically reliable estimates for 
the individual groups. Data are presented separately for non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic adults.

regular pipes, and chewing tobacco/snuff/dip or who reported 
ever using water pipes/hookahs, e-cigarettes, snus, and dis-
solvable tobacco products, were then asked if they used each 
respective product at the time of the survey. With the exception 
of cigarettes, response options for frequency of use at the time 
of survey were “every day,” “some days,” “rarely,” or “not at all”; 
“rarely” was not included as a response option for cigarettes.
Data were weighted to provide nationally representative esti-
mates of prevalence and number of users. To assess the effect 
of occasional tobacco use on estimates of current tobacco use, 
two definitions were used for all tobacco product types (except 
cigarettes): 1) use every day or some days; and 2) use every day, 
some days, or rarely. Any tobacco product use was defined as 
use of at least one tobacco product type.¶ Any combustible 
tobacco product use was defined as use of at least one of the 
following tobacco product types: cigarettes, cigars/cigarillos/
filtered little cigars, regular pipes, or water pipes/hookahs. All 
smokeless tobacco products (chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, 
and dissolvable tobacco products) were aggregated into a single 
category. Prevalence estimates were calculated overall and by 
sex, age, race/ethnicity, U.S. Census region, education, mari-
tal status, annual household income, and sexual orientation. 
Prevalence estimates with a relative standard error ≥30% are 
not presented. Differences between groups were assessed using 
chi-squared statistics; estimates with p<0.05 were considered 
to be statistically significant.
Overall, the reported prevalence of every day or some day 
use was as follows: any tobacco product use, 21.3% (estimated 
49.2 million users); any combustible tobacco product use, 
18.4% (42.8 million); cigarette use, 17.0% (39.8 million); 
cigar/cigarillo/filtered little cigar use, 1.8% (4.1 million); regu-
lar pipe use, 0.3% (0.7 million); water pipe/hookah use, 0.6% 
(1.4 million); e-cigarette use, 3.3% (7.8 million); and smoke-
less tobacco use, 2.5% (5.7 million) (Table 1). When “rarely” 
was added to the definition of use, prevalence of use was as 
follows: any tobacco product use, 25.5% (58.8 million users); 
any combustible tobacco product use, 22.2% (51.5 million); 
cigar/cigarillo/filtered little cigar use, 5.4% (12.6 million); 
regular pipe use, 0.8% (2.0 million); water pipe/hookah use, 
4.3% (10.0 million); e-cigarette use, 6.6% (15.5 million); 
smokeless tobacco product use, 3.5% (8.2 million) (Table 2).
Differences in use of any tobacco product every day or 
some days were observed across population groups (Table 1). 
Prevalence was higher among males (26.3%) than females 
(16.7%), and among age groups, was highest among per-
sons aged 25–44 years (26.1%) and lowest among persons 
aged ≥65 years (10.3%). Prevalence was highest among non-
Hispanics of other races (i.e., American Indians/Alaska natives, 
Native Hawaiians/other Pacific Islanders, and persons of mul-
tiple race) (32.6%) and lowest among non-Hispanic Asians 
¶ Participants who reported use of any product were considered any tobacco 
product users, but those who had a combination of “no” and missing responses 
to any of the assessed product type questions were excluded from the analysis. 
Participants who did not report use of any product “every day,” “some days,” 
or “rarely” who had missing responses for any of the assessed tobacco products 
(1.9% of respondents) were excluded.

* Any tobacco use was defined as “every day” or “some days” use of cigarettes; cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars; pipes; water pipes/hookahs; e-cigarettes; or smokeless tobacco (snus, 
dissolvable tobacco products, or snuff, chewing tobacco or dip). The survey assessed “every day” or “some days” use of the respective products only among persons who met specified lifetime 
usage thresholds: cigarettes (≥100 times); cigars/cigarillos/filtered little cigars (≥50 times); regular pipes (≥50 times); water pipes/hookahs (≥1 time); snus (≥1 time]; dissolvable tobacco 
products (≥1 time); chewing tobacco/snuff/dip (≥20 times); and e-cigarettes (≥1 time).
 
† Any combustible tobacco users were defined as persons who met specified lifetime usage thresholds for at least one of four different tobacco product types (cigarettes [≥100 times]; 
cigars/cigarillos/filtered little cigars [≥50 times]; regular pipes [≥50 times]; water pipes/hookahs [≥1 time]), and who now (at the time of the survey) used the respective product(s) every 
day or some days.
 
§ Current cigarette smokers were defined as persons who reported smoking ≥100 cigarettes during their lifetime and now smoked cigarettes every day or some days.
 
¶ Current cigar/cigarillo/filtered little cigar smokers were defined as persons who reported smoking cigars, cigarillos, or little filtered cigars ≥50 times during their lifetime and now smoked 
cigars, cigarillos, or little filtered cigars every day or some days.
 ** Reported smoking a regular pipe filled with tobacco ≥50 times during their lifetime and now smoked a regular pipe filled with tobacco every day or some days.
 †† Reported smoking tobacco in a water pipe/hookah at least once during their lifetime and now smoked tobacco in a water pipe/hookah every day or some days.
 §§ Persons who reported using electronic cigarettes at least once during their lifetime and now used e-cigarettes every day or some days.
 ¶¶ Smokeless tobacco users were defined as using at least one of the following three tobacco product types: 1) chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip; 2) snus; and 3) dissolvable tobacco products. 
Chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip users were respondents who reported using the product ≥20 times during their lifetime and now using chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip every day or some 
days. Snus or dissolvable tobacco product users were respondents who reported using each respective product at least once during their lifetime and now using each respective product 
every day or some days.

* Any tobacco use was defined as “every day” or “some days” use of cigarettes; and/or “every day,” “some days,” or “rarely” use of cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars; pipes; water pipes/
hookahs; e-cigarettes; or smokeless tobacco (snus, dissolvable tobacco products, or snuff, chewing tobacco or dip). Cigarettes are not presented separately because the questionnaire 
only assessed “every day” or “some days” use (no “rarely” response option). “Every day” or “some days” use of cigarettes was assessed among those who reported smoking ≥100 cigarettes 
during their lifetime.
 
† For the other tobacco product types, the survey assessed “every day,” “some days,” or “rarely” use among persons who met specified lifetime usage thresholds for the different tobacco 
product types: cigars/cigarillos/filtered little cigars (≥50 times); regular pipes (≥50 times); water pipes/hookahs (≥1 time); snus (≥1 time]; dissolvable tobacco products (≥1 time); chewing 
tobacco/snuff/dip (≥20 times); and e–cigarettes (≥1 time).
 
§ Current cigar/cigarillo/filtered little cigar smokers were defined as persons who reported smoking cigars, cigarillos, or little filtered cigars ≥50 times during their lifetime and smoked a 
cigar, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars every day, some days, or rarely.
 
¶ Reported smoking a regular pipe filled with tobacco ≥50 times during their lifetime and now smoked a regular pipe filled with tobacco every day, some days, or rarely.

 †† Persons who reported using electronic cigarettes at least once during their lifetime and now using electronic cigarettes every day, some days, or rarely.
 §§ Smokeless tobacco users were defined using at least one of the following three tobacco product types: 1) chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip; 2) snus; and 3) dissolvable tobacco products. 
Chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip users were respondents who reported using the product at least 20 times during their lifetime and now used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip every day,

(11.2%); by region, prevalence was highest among persons 
living in the South (24.0%) and lowest among persons living 
in the West (17.6%). Prevalence was highest among adults with 
a GED certificate (50.0%) and lowest among persons with a 
graduate degree (6.4%). Prevalence was higher among adults 
who were single/never married/not living with a partner (26.1%) 
or divorced/separated/widowed (26.1%) than those married or 
living with a partner (18.0%). Prevalence was highest among 
adults with annual household income <$20,000 (32.2%) and 
lowest among those with annual household income ≥$100,000 
(12.1%) and was higher among LGB adults (32.1%) than 
heterosexual/straight adults (20.7%). Prevalence patterns were 
generally similar when “rarely” was included in the definition 
of use (Table 2).
Among every day, some days, or rarely users, younger adults 
aged 18–24 accounted for 55.8% of water pipe/hookah smok-
ers, 24.3% of e-cigarettes users, 23.1% of regular pipe smok-
ers, 21.6% of smokeless tobacco users, and 19.5% of cigar/
cigarillo/filtered little cigar smokers (Figure).
Discussion
During 2013–2014, one in five U.S. adults (an estimated 
49.2 million persons) used any tobacco product every day or 
some days, and one in four (58.8 million persons) used any 
tobacco product every day, some days, or rarely. Across popula-
tion groups, differences were observed in tobacco use by sex, 
age, race/ethnicity, U.S. Census region, education, marital 
status, annual household income, and sexual orientation. 
The magnitude and patterns of tobacco product use generally 
were comparable to those from other national surveys of U.S. 
adults during the same period.** Use of any tobacco product 
every day or some days was nearly threefold higher among 
non-Hispanics of other races (i.e., American Indians/Alaska 
natives, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islanders, and persons 
of multiple race) than among Asian non-Hispanics. Adults 
with annual household incomes of <$20,000 also reported 
a higher prevalence of tobacco product use than did persons 
with higher annual household income and LGB adults reported 
higher prevalence of tobacco product use than did adults who 
identified as heterosexual/straight.
The use of e-cigarettes and water pipes/hookahs was par-
ticularly prevalent among certain populations. Most users of 
these two emerging tobacco products were not daily users. 
Moreover, young adults had the highest prevalence of use of 
e-cigarettes and water pipes, which might reflect that although 
most experimentation with tobacco products occurs during the 
teenage years, young adulthood increasingly is a time of initiation 
of tobacco products, including emerging tobacco products.†† 
The higher prevalence of use among younger adults might also 
be a consequence of targeted marketing of e-cigarette products 
and varying perceptions about the relative harm or social accept-
ability of these products compared with conventional cigarettes 
(1,4,5). When the definition of current users included partici-
pants who reported rarely using tobacco products, current use 
was disproportionately higher among younger adults. These 
users might not consider themselves to be tobacco product 
users, and thus, might not consider themselves to be at risk for 
tobacco-related disease or death (6,7). For example, one focus 
group study with adult cigar smokers found that some users 
would only use the term “smoker” or “cigar smoker” to describe 
someone who smoked cigars several times a week or daily (8). 
This finding underscores the importance of further research 
on the ascertainment of tobacco product use, as well as efforts 
to educate the public about the potential harms of all tobacco 
product use, including risks associated with occasional use.
Continued implementation of proven population-based 
interventions, including increasing tobacco product prices, 
implementing and enforcing comprehensive smoke-free laws, 
warning about the dangers of tobacco use through public 
education media campaigns, and increasing access to proven 
resources to help people quit tobacco use, can help reduce 
tobacco use and tobacco-related disease and death (1,9). In 
addition, regulatory authority over the manufacture, mar-
keting, and sales of tobacco products is an important tool 
to further reduce tobacco-related disease and death in the 
United States.§§ In May 2016, FDA finalized a rule extend-
ing its authority to all products that meet the definition of a 
tobacco product, including e-cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and water 
pipes/hookahs.¶¶ This rule sets a national minimum age for 
sales; requires health warnings, tobacco product ingredient 
reporting, and reporting of harmful and potentially harm-
ful constituents; and ensures FDA premarket review of new 
and changed tobacco products and premarket review of the 
marketing of products as reduced-risk (modified risk tobacco 
products). The rule also enables future rulemaking regarding 
tobacco product manufacturing, marketing, and sales.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, self-reported tobacco use might have resulted in 
misreporting; however, self-reported cigarette smoking correlates 
highly with serum cotinine levels (10). Second, small sample

sizes among certain subgroups resulted in less precise estimates. 
Third, the overall response rate of 36.1% might have resulted 
in bias, even after adjustment for nonresponse. Finally, thresh-
olds and current use measures varied by tobacco product type; 
for example, the absence of a response option of “rarely” for 
ascertaining cigarette smoking at the time of the survey might 
have resulted in underestimates for current cigarette smoking.
Sustained, comprehensive state tobacco control programs 
funded at CDC-recommended levels can accelerate progress 
toward reducing tobacco-related diseases and deaths (1).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Although significant declines in cigarette smoking have 
occurred among U.S. adults during the past 5 decades, the use 
of emerging tobacco products has increased in recent years.
What is added by this report?
During 2013–2014, 21.3% of U.S. adults used a tobacco product 
every day or some days, and 25.5% of U.S. adults used a tobacco 
product every day, some days, or rarely. Cigarettes remained the 
most commonly used tobacco product. Young adults aged 
18–24 years reported the highest prevalence of use of emerging 
tobacco products, including water pipes/hookahs and e-cigarettes. 
Differences in the use of any tobacco product were observed, with 
higher use reported among males; persons aged <45 years; 
non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, or non-Hispanics of 
other races; persons in the Midwest or South; persons with a 
General Educational Development certificate; persons who were 
single/never married/not living with a partner or divorced/
separated/widowed; persons with annual household income 
<$20,000; and persons who were lesbian, gay, or bisexual.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Continued implementation of proven population-based 
interventions focused on the diversity of tobacco product use 
could help reduce tobacco use and tobacco related disease and 
death. These interventions include increasing tobacco product 
prices, implementing and enforcing comprehensive smoke-free 
laws, warning about the dangers of tobacco use through 
high-impact public education media campaigns, and increasing 
access to resources to help people quit tobacco use.
