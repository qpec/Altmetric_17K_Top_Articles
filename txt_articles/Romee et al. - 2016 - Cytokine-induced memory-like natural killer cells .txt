Natural killer (NK) cells are an emerging cellular immunotherapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML);
however, the best approach to maximize NK cell antileukemia potential is unclear. Cytokine-induced memory-like
NK cells differentiate after a brief preactivation with interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, and IL-18 and exhibit enhanced re-
sponses to cytokine or activating receptor restimulation for weeks to months after preactivation. We hypothesized
that memory-like NK cells exhibit enhanced antileukemia functionality. We demonstrated that human memory-like
NK cells have enhanced interferon-g production and cytotoxicity against leukemia cell lines or primary human AML
blasts in vitro. Using mass cytometry, we found that memory-like NK cell functional responses were triggered against
primary AML blasts, regardless of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) to KIR-ligand interactions. In addition,
multidimensional analyses identified distinct phenotypes of control and memory-like NK cells from the same indi-
viduals. Human memory-like NK cells xenografted into mice substantially reduced AML burden in vivo and improved
overall survival. In the context of a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial, adoptively transferred memory-like NK cells
proliferated and expanded in AML patients and demonstrated robust responses against leukemia targets. Clinical
responses were observed in five of nine evaluable patients, including four complete remissions. Thus, harnessing
cytokine-induced memory-like NK cell responses represents a promising translational immunotherapy approach
for patients with AML.
INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy primarily
of older individuals that remains a substantial clinical challenge (1).
Currently,lessthan 30% of AMLpatients are curedwithstandardthera-
pies, and relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) AML patients who are not can-
didates for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have a poor
prognosis and no curative treatment options (2, 3). Cellular immuno-
therapy mediated by alloreactive T and NK cells administered in the
context of an allogeneic HCT is an effective treatment for AML; how-
ever, most AML patients are not candidates for this procedure because
it is associated with substantial treatment-related morbidity and mor-
tality(4,5).Analternativeapproachthatprovidestheimmunotherapeutic
benefits of allogeneic HCT without severe toxicity is the adoptive transfer
of allogeneic lymphocytes that mediate the “graft versus leukemia” effect.
This strategy may expand the option of cellular immunotherapy to most
AML patients.
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that are important
for host defense against pathogens and mediate antitumor immune re-
sponses(6,7).Majorhistocompatibilitycomplex(MHC)–haploidentical
NK cells exhibit antileukemia responses without causing “graft versus
host disease” (GVHD) after HCT (8), providing evidenceof their utility
as a cellular effector for leukemia patients. Allogeneic NK cell adoptive
transfer is safe and can induce remissions in patients with leukemia
(9–12); however, these studies have been limited by inadequate per-
sistence, expansion, and in vivo antileukemia activity of the adop-
tively transferred NK cells. Thus, one key barrier in the field is the
need for biology-driven approaches to enhance NK cell antitumor
functionality before adoptive transfer.
Although NK cells have traditionally been considered members of
the innate immune system, paradigm-shifting studies in mice have
identified memory-like properties after hapten exposure, virus infec-
tion, orcombined interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, and IL-18 cytokine pre-
activation (13, 14). Cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells were
defined by briefly preactivating murine NK cells with IL-12, IL-15, and
IL-18, followed by adoptive transfer into syngeneic mice. Weeks to
months later, memory-like NK cells had proliferated and exhibited
enhanced restimulation responses to cytokines or triggering via activat-
ing receptors (15, 16). This preactivation approach also resulted in anti-
tumor responses to murine NK cell–sensitive cell lines after adoptive
transfer in mice (17). The potential translation of these findings as im-
munotherapy was established by the identification of human IL-12,
IL-15, and IL-18–induced memory-like NK cells (18). Key properties
of human memory-like NK cells include enhanced proliferation, ex-
pression of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor abg (IL-2Rabg), and increased
interferon-g (IFN-g) production after restimulation with cytokines or via
activating receptors (19, 20). However, the ability of human memory-like
NK cells to respond to cancer target cells has not been extensively re-
ported. We hypothesized that human cytokine-induced memory-like
NK cells exhibit enhanced antileukemia properties. This was tested
in vitro against primary AML blasts and in vivo in nonobese diabetic
(NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)/common gamma
chain−/− (gc−/−) (NSG) mouse xenograft models and in AML patients

RESULTS
Memory-like NK cells exhibit
enhanced functional responses
against leukemia target cells
Although the enhanced recall response of
human IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18–induced
memory-like NK cellswaswellestablished
after cytokine receptor restimulation (18),
their response to leukemia target cells, in-
cluding primary AML blasts, was not ex-
tensively studied. To address this issue, we
preactivated human NK cells with IL-12,
IL-15, and IL-18 or control conditions
(low-dose IL-15 only) overnight and then
differentiated memory-like or control NK
cells from the same individual for 7 days
(Fig. 1A). Memory-like NK cells exhibited
enhanced IFN-g production in response
to restimulation with both K562 leukemia
cells (Fig. 1, A and B) and primary AML
blasts (Fig. 1, A and C). In addition,
memory-like NK cells demonstrated sig-
nificantly higher cytotoxicity compared
to control NK cells from the same donors,
which was dependent on NKG2D and
DNAM-1 (P = 0.02; Fig. 1D and fig. S1).
Consistent with augmented cytotoxicity,
we observed increased expression of the
cytotoxic effector protein granzyme B
(Fig. 1, E and F). To further define the dif-
ferences between memory-like and con-
trol NK cells, we established a mass
cytometry panel that included functional-
ly relevant proteins to deeply immuno-
phenotype NK cells.
Mass cytometry defines the
differences between memory-like
and control NK cells
Mass cytometry allows for high-throughput
analysis of a large number of parameters
on single cells, and it has been used to
deeply immunophenotype and track the
diversity of human NK cells (21, 22). We
developed custom mass cytometry panels
that include NK cell lineage, maturation,
receptor repertoire, and functional capac-
ity (tables S1 and S2), and using the viSNE
clustering and visualization strategy (23),
we identified the differences between con-
trol and memory-like NK cells (Fig. 2, A and B, and figs. S2 and S3). Con-
trol and memory-like NK cells were localized within separate areas of
the viSNE map, indicative of distinct cellular islands (Fig. 2A). We con-
firmed significant differences in the expression of a number of markers
that were previously reported (18, 19), including CD94 (P = 0.002),

 findings of increased cytotoxic effector proteins, which likely contribute to
the enhancedcytotoxicity of memory-like NK cellsagainst leukemiatargets.
Memory-like NK cells respond to AML regardless of
inhibitory KIR to KIR-ligand interactions
Because allogeneic NK cell responses to AML blasts are influenced
by the interaction of the inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like
receptors (KIRs) with their cognate human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
ligands (24–26), we next examined whether memory-like differentiation
altered KIR diversity. We used mass cytometry to examine NK cells at
baseline (naïve) and after control or memory-like differentiation in
vitro at day 7 (table S1 and Fig. 1A). The inverse Simpson diversity index
of KIR expressed by naïve, control (day 7), and memory-like (day 7) NK
cells was unaltered (Fig. 2C) (21, 27), demonstrating that inhibitory
KIR phenotypes present at baseline were stable in vitro. Consistent
with this, the percent of KIR-positive NK cells was similar at day 7
between control and memory-like NK cell populations (Fig. 2D).
In the setting of allogeneic HCT, donor KIR repertoire affects patient
prognosis, highlighting the importance of the KIR to KIR-ligand mis-
match for conventional NK cell anti-AML activity (24–26, 28). To
experimentally identify NK cell subsets that preferentially respond
to primary AML blasts, we restimulated control and memory-like
NK cells for 6 hours with primary AML blasts and assessed the ex-
pression of 36 parameters via mass cytometry (tables S2 to S4).
Memory-like NK cells again produced more IFN-g when triggered
with primary AML blasts compared to controls (Fig. 3, A and B). We
used spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events
(SPADE) to cluster the NK cells according to the expression of core
NK cell markers and assessed each node (representing a distinct NK cell
specificity) for IFN-g expression (Fig. 3C) (29, 30). The KIR-ligand in-
teraction status of each node was defined to investigate their impact on
memory-like and control NK cell responses. For a representative indi-
vidual, we assigned the SPADE nodes as matched if they expressed
KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3, which recognizes HLA-C1 present on the AML
blasts. KIR2DL1 and KIR3DL1 did not have ligands present, and nodes
that lacked KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3 were categorized as mismatched. Based
on this approach, we observed the expected increased response in KIR-
mismatched versus KIR-matched node in IFN-g production in the
control cells when triggered with AML blasts (Fig. 3, D to F). However,
memory-like NK cells produced increased IFN-g compared to control
cells in both the KIR-ligand–matched and KIR-ligand–mismatched
situations. Moreover, the IFN-g production by memory-like NK cells
was similar in the KIR-matched and KIR-mismatched setting (Fig. 3,
D and E), which was reproducible across the seven individuals tested
(Fig. 3E). Furthermore, when we expanded our analysis to four dif-
ferent primary AML blasts, we observed a consistent increase in
IFN-g production in KIR-matched memory-like NK cells compared
to KIR-mismatched control-treated cells (Fig. 3F). Because most
memory-like NK cells express NKG2A, we assessed IFN-g production
by NKG2A− or NKG2A+ KIR-ligand–matched or KIR-ligand–
mismatched NK cells and observed increased IFN-g production by
memory-like NK cells compared to controls in both subpopulations
(figs. S4, A to C). Cell surface CD107a, tumor necrosis factor, and mac-
rophage inflammatory protein-1a were also increased on memory-
like NK cells in these assays, compared to controls (fig. S4D). Thus,
memory-like differentiation enhances IFN-g production in response to
primary AML, regardless of whether memory-like NK cells expressed
inhibitory KIR with a ligand present on the target AML blast.
Memory-like NK cells exhibit potent antileukemia
functionality after transfer into NSG mice
To assess whether human memory-like NK cells maintain memory-like
function in vivo, we used an adoptive transfer model with NSG mice
(Fig. 4A). After 7 days, memory-like NK cells were found to localize
in key hematopoietic tissues, including bone marrow (BM), spleen,
and blood (Fig. 4B), and were found in similar numbers compared to
controlNKcells(Fig. 4C).Theexpressionof selectedchemokine receptors
was minimally changed after IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 pre-activation, with
the exception of reduced expression of CX3CR1 (fig. S7). Memory-like
NK cells also maintained their enhanced functionality as evidenced by
increased IFN-g production in response to ex vivo restimulation with
K562 leukemia cells after 7 days in NSG mice (Fig. 4, D and E).
To test the ability of human memory-like NK cells to control leuke-
mia in vivo, we engrafted K562-luc (luciferase-expressing) leukemia
cells in NSG mice and adoptively transferred human IL-12, IL-15, and
IL-18–preactivated or control NK cells into groups of NSG mice on
day 4 (Fig. 4F). Memory-like NK cells were significantly more effective
in controlling K562 tumor cell growth in vivo using whole-body bio-
luminescence imaging (BLI) (P < 0.001; Fig. 4, G and H). The enhanced
leukemia control afforded by a single injection of human memory-like
NK cells also resulted in improved survival of these mice (Fig. 4I).
Donor memory-like NK cells proliferate and expand after
adoptive transfer into patients with AML
On the basis of these preclinical findings with human memory-like NK
cells and those from mouse models evaluating NK cell–sensitive tumor
cell line challenge (17), we initiated a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial
of allogeneic, HLA-haploidentical, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18–preactivated
NK cells in patients with rel/ref AML (fig. S5). Here, we report memory-
likeNKcellbiologyandantileukemiaactivitywithinthefirstnineevaluable

activated for 12 to 16 hours with rhIL-12, rhIL-15, and rhIL-18 in a good
manufacturing practice (GMP) laboratory, washed, and infused into AML
patients who were preconditioned with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (9)
on day 0. After adoptive transfer, low-dose rhIL-2 was administered to sup-
portmemory-likeNKcellsthroughtheirinducedhigh-affinityIL-2Rabg (19).
Three patients at dose level 1 (0.5 × 106/kg), three patients at dose
level 2 (1.0 × 106/kg), and three patients at dose level 3 (all NK cells
generated, capped at 10 × 106/kg) were evaluable. Donor memory-like
NK cells were tracked in the blood of all patients with informative HLA
[using donor- or patient-specific anti-HLA monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs)], peaked in frequency at 7 to 14 days after infusion and, as
expected (9), decreased in number after recipient T cell recovery (Fig.
5, A to C). Memory-like NK cells comprised >90% of blood NK cells
at day 7 (Fig. 5, A and B), with an average of 419 ± 166–fold increase
(range, 39 to 1270) comparing day 1 and day 7 counts (Fig. 5C). Donor

revealed large percentages and absolute numbers of donor memory-like

and recipient pairs, especially between NK cell dose levels (fig. S6).

 K562 leukemia cells (Fig. 6, A to D). These analyses revealed an increased
frequency of IFN-g–positive donor, compared to recipient, NK cells (Fig.
6A). More strikingly, these experiments revealed that the absolute number
of donor IFN-g–producing NK cells was markedly increased, compared to
the recipient NK cells in these samples (Fig. 6, B to D). Similarly, the num-
ber of IFN-g–positive donor memory-like NK cells was greater than reci-
pient NK cells in BM, although fewer patients had BM samples with
adequate cell numbers for functional analyses (Fig. 6, E to G).
Complete remissions were observed after IL-12, IL-15, and
IL-18–preactivated donor NK cell infusion in patients with
rel/ref AML
Performing a phase 1 study of memory-like NK cell adoptive immuno-
therapy in older patients with active rel/ref AML is a clinical challenge,
but it does permit investigation of anti-AML responses. Thirteen pa-
tients who had progressed after multiple previous treatments were
administered with memory-like NK cells at dose levels 1, 2, and 3. Four

Downloaded from 
 blast percentages in the BM of responding and nonresponding patients
are shown in fig. S6. There was no detectable correlation between pre-
therapy BM blast percentage, donor KIR haplotype, the presence of pre-
dicted KIR-ligand mismatch, and the frequency of donor NK cells in the
blood or BM and clinical response, but the number of patients was
small. A complete set of clinical vignettes describing each patient and
his or her clinical course is included in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods. Additional parameters of relevant NK cell receptor biology
are shown in table S5. Thus, allogeneic human IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18–
induced memory-like NK cells proliferate, expand, and exhibit anti-
leukemia function after adoptive transfer into rel/ref AML patients
with active disease.
DISCUSSION
Motivated by the need to develop innovative treatment options for
AML patients (4, 5), we investigated the ability of a recently defined
functional class of NK cells, cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells,
to mediate antileukemia responses (20). Here, we demonstrated that
primary human NK cells, differentiated in vitro into memory-like NK
cells via brief preactivation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, exhibit potent
antileukemia responses in the form of IFN-g production and cyto-
toxicity. Using mass cytometry and multidimensional analyses to assess
a large number of NK cell relevant proteins simultaneously, we found
thatmemory-like NK cells were clearly distinguishable fromcontrolNK
cells from the same individual. Despite stable inhibitory KIR receptor
expression, memory-like NK cells responded more robustly to primary
AML blasts, regardless of KIR-ligand interactions. Moreover, human
memory-like NK cells were superior, in terms of both controlling leu-
kemia burden and prolonging survival, in an in vivo NSG xenograft
model. Translating this to the clinic, we examined the biology of the
MHC-haploidentical donor IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18–preactivated NK
cells administered to patients with active rel/ref AML in the context
of a first-in-human NK cell trial. After transfer, memory-like NK cells
were detectable in the blood and BM of patients for weeks, proliferated
extensively, and expanded in vivo. Further, memory-like NK cells that
differentiated in patients in vivo exhibited enhanced functionality
against leukemia target cells. Notably, five of the nine evaluable AML
patients receiving IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18–preactivated NK cells had clin-
ical responses, suggesting preliminary evidence of in vivo antileukemia
activity. Thus, preactivation of NK cells with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 that
results in memory-like NK cell differentiation represents a promising
approach to enhancing adoptive allogeneic NK cell therapy.
Published studies have identified comparable IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18–
induced memory-like NK cell biology in mice and humans (15–19). In
mouse models, preactivation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 has been
shown to improve NK cell responses to lymphoma and melanoma cell
lines in vivo, which required T cell–derived IL-2 (17). Although some
phenotypic differences have been identified (18), a clear approach to
distinguishing memory-like from conventional NK cells from the same
donor was lacking. Through mass cytometry and multidimensional
data reduction algorithms, control and memory-like NK cells were
identified in separate areas of viSNE maps, indicating a distinct pheno-
type and providing an approach to tracking memory-like NK cells
in vivo. Currently, memory-like NK cells that emerge after IL-12, IL-15,
and IL-18 preactivation are thought to result from a differentiation pro-
cess that yields a long-term alteration of functional capacity; however,
the molecular mechanisms that control this process are yet to be
defined. This concept of differentiation is consistent with the distinct
phenotype tracked by multidimensional analyses, and the observations
that enhanced memory-like NK cell responses to restimulation are re-
tained after extensive cell division and persisted for weeks to months
after the initial preactivation (15, 18). The phenotypic changes observed
after IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 preactivation include increased expression
of inhibitory, activating, and cytokine receptors (CD94/NKG2A,
NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, CD62L, and CD25), whereas other
receptors appear unchanged (KIR, CD57, NKG2C, DNAM-1, CD137,
and CD11b) or decreased (NKp80). Such dynamic changes in activat-
ing, inhibitory, cytokine, and adhesion receptors are also consistent with
differentiation. Further, prolonged IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 activation
(for 5 days) resulted in reduced methylation of the IFN-g conserved

 activation, elucidation of molecular mechanisms controlling cytokine-
induced memory would provide additional clarification of this issue.
Earlier work has set the stage for the use of allogeneic NK cells
as adoptive immunotherapy for AML patients (9–12), harnessing the
leukemia-targeting potential of NK cell allorecognition of MHC-
mismatched AML first identified after HCT (8). Initial pioneering
adoptive NK cell therapy clinical trials identified that an available
lymphoid niche was essential for donor NK cell engraftment and expan-
sion; however, clinical responses occurred in a minority of patients with
limited duration (9). This modest effect is consistent with the concept
that combined modulatory approaches will be required to fully optimize
NK cell adoptive immunotherapy for cancer patients, including (i) en-
hancement of NK cell targeting of cancer cells, (ii) augmentation of NK
cell functional capacity, and (iii) elimination of inhibitory checkpoints
or cellular negative regulators (33S). In the context of AML, NK cell
allorecognition of MHC-haploidentical blasts has provided an
established mode of targeting NK cells to myeloid leukemia via inhib-
itory receptor mismatch and activating receptor ligation. We discovered
that IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18–induced memory-like NK cells exhibit
enhanced triggering against AML regardless of KIR to KIR-ligand inter-
actions, resulting in an expanded NK cell pool of AML-reactive effector
cells. Because NKG2A is expressed on most memory-like NK cells, the
interaction with HLA-E on AML blasts or bystander cells in the micro-
environment remains a potentially important inhibitory pathway for
memory-like NK cells. The functionality of memory-like NK cells is also
enhanced in terms of cytotoxicity and IFN-g production. Thus, through
brief combined cytokine stimulation, two aspects of the NK cell anti-
tumor response have been improved.
Most adoptive NK cell therapy studies to date use IL-2 or IL-15 to
activate NK cells overnight before transfer. This strategy results in a
short-term priming signal that increases NK cell functional capacity
(33), but the effect is rapidly lost after removal from the in vitro cytokine
milieu and transfer into the patient. Here, we reasoned that the longer-
lasting increase in functional capacity afforded by memory-like NK cell
differentiation, combined with improved AML recognition, would en-
hance in vivo expansion and antileukemia responses, resulting in a sev-
eral week “window of opportunity” to attack AML blasts. Donor
memory-like NK cells consistently expanded to become >90% of blood
NK cells, as well as most BM NK cells. Because of concerns for cytokine-
release syndrome, our phase 1 study was intentionally initiated with a
starting NK cell dose of 1/10 to 1/20 of the typical adoptive NK cell dose
(9–12). Considering the relatively low doses of highly purified IL-12,
IL-15, and IL-18–preactivated NK cells administered to patients, the
donor NK cell frequencies and numbers observed here in the blood
and BM are remarkable. Two published studies have transferred doses
of CD56+CD3−-purified NK cells similar to our dose level 3 as adoptive
immunotherapy for patients with active AML (11, 12). The overall re-
sponse rate of 55% (5 of 9) and CR/CRi rate of 45% (4 of 9) in our study
comparefavorablyto7%(1of15)observedwithincohort2ofBachanova
et al. (0 of 10) (12) and patients with active AML on the work of Curti
et al. (1 of 5) (11). Because our sample size was limited, this finding is
hypothesis-generating and will need to be studied in more patients trea-
tedwithIL-12,IL-15,andIL-18–preactivatedNKcells.Inoursmallsample
set treated to date, these responses did not segregate with any KIR-
based rules for NK cell allorecognition, although most patients studied
hadaKIRtoKIR-ligandmismatchinthedonorversusrecipientdirection.

 Similarly, there were no associations with NK cell number or IFN-g pro-
duction measurements, which had substantial variability within patients
who received different doses of NK cells. Thus, this report provides proof
of concept that human IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18–preactivated NK cells
may be translated into the cancer immunotherapy clinic, with consistent
memory-like NK cell biology in vitro, in xenograft models in vivo and in
AML patients in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Patients treated on an open-label, nonrandomized, first-in-human
phase 1 dose escalation trial (NCT01898793) are included in this study.
The primary objective of the clinical trial was to identify the maximum
tolerated or tested dose of memory-like NK cells administered to pa-
tients with rel/ref AML. Sample size was based on a standard 3 + 3 dose
escalation design. Patients with rel/ref AML who were not candidates
for immediate HCT were eligible to participate. Patients were treated
with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide between days −7 and −2 for immu-
nosuppression, followed on day 0 by allogeneic donor IL-12, IL-15, and
IL-18–preactivated NK cells in escalating doses: 0.5 × 106/kg (dose
level 1), 1.0 × 106/kg (dose level 2), and all NK cells that could be
generated from a single leukapheresis capped at 10 × 106/kg (dose
level 3). After donor NK cell adoptive transfer, patients received low-
dose rhIL-2 (1 × 106 IU/m2) subcutaneously every other day for a
total of six doses. Donor NK cell products were generated by purifying
NK cells from a nonmobilized leukapheresis product using CD3 deple-
tion followed by CD56-positive selection on a CliniMACS device (>90%
CD56+CD3−). Purified NK cells were preactivated with IL-12 (10 ng/ml),
IL-15 (50 ng/ml), and IL-18 (50 ng/ml) for 12 to 16 hours under cur-
rent GMP conditions. Samples were obtained from the peripheral
blood (before treatment and at days 1, 3, 7, 8, 14, 21, 30, 60, and
100) and BM (before treatment and at days 8, 14, 30, 60, and 100) after
the NK cell infusions. Clinical responses were defined by the revised
IWG criteria for AML (31). If cell numbers were limiting, analyses of
NK cell number and phenotype were prioritized. All patients provided
informedconsentbeforeparticipatingandweretreatedat the Washington
University Institutional Review Board (IRB)–approved clinical trial
(Human Research Protection Office #201401085).
Reagents, mice, and cell lines
Antihuman mAbs were used for flow and mass cytometry (tables S1, S2,
andS6),includingpreviouslyreportedanti-HLAmAbs(34).Endotoxin-
free, recombinant human cytokines are described in the Supplemen-
tary Materials and Methods. NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice
(4to8weeksold) were obtainedfromThe JacksonLaboratory,maintained
under specific pathogen–free conditions, and used in accordance with our
animal protocol approved by the Washington University Animal Studies
Committee. K562 cells [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC),
CCL-243] were obtained in 2008, viably cryopreserved and stored in
liquid nitrogen, thawed for use in these studies, and maintained for
<2 months at a time in continuous culture according to ATCC instruc-
tions. K562 cells were authenticated in 2015 using single-nucleotide poly-
morphism analysis and were found to be exactly matched to the K562 cells
from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, German Collection
of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), and ATCC databases
(2015, Genetic Resources Core Facility at Johns Hopkins University).
NK cell purification and cell culture
Normal donor PBMCs were obtained from anonymous healthy platelet
donors and isolated by Ficoll centrifugation (18, 19, 35). NK cells were
purified using RosetteSep (STEMCELL Technologies; routinely ≥95%
CD56+CD3−). KIR genotyping of donor PBMC was performed by
Kashi Clinical Laboratories. Memory-like and control NK cells were
generated as previously described (see the Supplementary Materials
and Methods for more details) (18).
Patient samples
Patients with newly diagnosed AML provided informed consent under
theWashingtonUniversityIRB-approvedprotocol(2010-11766)andwere
the source of primary AML blasts for in vitro resimulation experiments
(tableS4).Afterinformedconsent,patientsampleswerealsoobtainedfrom
the first-in-human phase 1 clinical study of allogeneic donor memory-like
NK cells in rel/ref AML (fig. S5). Patient peripheral blood or BM aspirate
wasobtainedattheindicatedtimepointafterNKcellinfusion,andPBMCs
wereisolatedbyFicollcentrifugationandimmediatelyusedinexperiments.
Functional assays to assess cytokine production
Control and memory-like NK cells were harvested after a rest period of
7 days to mimic transfer into a patient and to allow memory-like NK
cell differentiation to occur. Cells were then restimulated in a standard
functional assay (18, 19, 35). Cells were stimulated with K562 leukemia
targets or freshly thawed primary AML blasts (effector/target ratio of
5:1, unless otherwise indicated). Further details are provided in the Sup-
plementary Materials and Methods.
Flow-based killing assay
Flow-based killing assays were performed by co-incubating memory-
like or control NK cells with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl
ester–labeled K562 cells for 4 hours and assaying 7-aminoactinomycin
D uptake as described (18, 19, 35).
Adoptive transfer of human memory-like NK cells into NSG mice
Purified control (5 × 106; ≥95% CD56+CD3−) or IL-12, IL-15, and IL-
18–preactivated NK cells were injected retro-orbitally into NSG mice.
Mice received rhIL-2 (50,000 IU) through intraperitoneal injection ev-
ery other day to support the adoptively transferredNK cells. After 7 days,
the mice were sacrificed, and organs (spleen, blood, and BM) were
assessed for the presence of transferred cells. NSG splenocytes were
also examined for intracellular IFN-g production after restimulation
with K562 leukemia targets.
In vivo BLI
ForBLIexperiments,miceweretreatedasdescribedintheSupplementary
Materials and Methods. For imaging, mice were injected intraperitoneally
with D-luciferin (150 mg/g) (Biosynth) in PBS and imaged using the IVIS
100 (Caliper). BLI was performed at the indicated time points.
Flow cytometric analysis
Cell staining was performed as described (18, 19, 35), and data were
acquired on a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed
using Kaluza (Beckman Coulter) or FlowJo (Tree Star) software.
Mass cytometry
All mass cytometry data were collected on a CyTOF2 mass cytometer
(Fluidigm) and analyzed using Cytobank (36). Mass cytometry data

 were analyzed using previously described methods (37). For detailed
information, refer to the Supplementary Materials and Methods. Diver-
sity was assessed on eight individual donors at baseline (freshly thawed
PBMCs or thawed pure NK cells), after control treatment or memory-
like differentiation (described above) using the Boolean gating strategy
described in fig. S2 (21, 22). Event counts were used to generate inverse
Simpson index for KIR2DL1, KIR2DL1/KIR2DL2, KIR3DL1,
KIR2DS4, and KIR2DL5 expression.
Statistical analysis
Before statistical analyses, all data were tested for normal distribution
(D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test). If data were not normal-
ly distributed, the appropriate nonparametric tests were used (GraphPad
Prism v5.0), with all statistical comparisons indicated in the figure
legends. Uncertainty is represented in the figures as SEM, except as in-
dicated in the figure legends. All comparisons used a two-sided a of 0.05
for significance testing.
