IMPORTANCE Following animal model data indicating the possible rejuvenating effects of
blood from young donors, there have been at least 2 observational studies conducted with
humans that have investigated whether donor age affects patient outcomes. Results,
however, have been conflicting.
OBJECTIVE To study the association of donor age and sex with survival of patients receiving
transfusions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study based on the Scandinavian
Donations and Transfusions database, with nationwide data, was conducted for all patients
from Sweden and Denmark who received at least 1 red blood cell transfusion of autologous
blood or blood from unknown donors between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012.
Patients were followed up from the first transfusion until death, emigration, or end of
follow-up. Data analysis was performed from September 15 to November 15, 2016.
EXPOSURES The number of transfusions from blood donors of different age and sex.
Exposure was treated time dependently throughout follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hazard ratios (HRs) for death and adjusted cumulative
mortality differences, both estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS Results of a crude analysis including 968 264 transfusion recipients (550 257
women and 418 007 men; median age at first transfusion, 73.0 years [interquartile range,
59.8-82.4 years]) showed a U-shaped association between age of the blood donor and
recipient mortality, with a nadir in recipients for the most common donor age group (40-49
years) and significant and increasing HRs among recipients of blood from donors of
successively more extreme age groups (<20 years: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.14; �70 years: HR,
1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.44). Higher mortality was also noted among recipients of blood from
female donors (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.07-1.07). Adjustments for number of transfusions with a
linear term attenuated the associations, but the increased mortality for recipients of blood
from young, old, and female donors was not eliminated. Closer examination of the association
between number of transfusions and mortality revealed a nonlinear pattern. After
adjustments to accommodate nonlinearity, donor age and sex were no longer associated with
patient mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Donor age and sex were not associated with patient survival
and need not be considered in blood allocation. Any comparison between common and less
common categories of transfusions will inevitably be confounded by the number of
transfusions, which drives the probability of receiving the less common blood components.
Previous positive findings regarding donor age and sex are most likely explained by residual
confounding.

T
he possible negative health effects linked to particular
characteristics of transfused blood units have received
much attention in recent years. Much of this research
has focused on the health effects of stored blood products.1-8
Althoughlargeobservationalandrandomizedstudieshavenot
found any negative effect of stored blood,9-14 other character-
istics of blood units are receiving increasing attention.
Most recently, following reports from animal model stud-
ies suggesting that transfusions from young donors may have
rejuvenating effects in older recipients,15-20 there have been at
least 2 observational studies investigating whether donor age
influences the survival of patients receiving transfusions.21,22
The studies used dissimilar statistical methods and reported
conflicting results. In the first study, which was based on the
Scandinavian Donations and Transfusions (SCANDAT2)
database,23 a matched cohort design was used, and no associa-
tions were found between donor age and mortality of patients
who received transfusions.22 The second study, based on Ca-
nadian data, used a more complex, time-dependent survival
model and conversely reported increased risks of death among
recipients of blood from young and female donors.21
The difference between the findings of these 2 studies is
striking. If the Canadian findings are true, they would have im-
mediate implications for transfusion medicine practice. To
understand and explain these differences and ultimately rec-
oncile the contradictory results, we conducted a new retro-
spective cohort study based on the SCANDAT2 database in
which we used methods similar to those used in the Cana-
dian study by Chassé et al.21
Methods
Data Sources
All analyses were based on the SCANDAT2 database, which has
beendescribedindetailpreviously.23Inbrief,thedatabasecon-
tains all electronically available data from Sweden since 1968
and from Denmark since 1983 on blood donors, blood dona-
tions, blood components, and patients who received transfu-
sions. Using national registration numbers that are available
for all persons living in both countries,24,25 the SCANDAT2 da-
tabase has been linked with nationwide population registers,
as well as registers for hospital and outpatient care, cause of
death, and cancer occurrence. The creation of the SCANDAT2
database and the conduct of this study were approved by the
Danish Data Protection Agency and the ethics review board in
Stockholm, Sweden. Informed consent was waived by the eth-
ics review board in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Danish Data
Protection Agency.
Study Design
Blood unit allocation typically follows a first in–first out prin-
ciple: when 1 or more blood units are ordered for a patient, the
blood bank selects the available compatible unit(s) that had
been stored the longest. Consequently, within a given hospi-
tal or administrative region, all characteristics attributed to a
blood unit—apart from blood group—should be unconnected
with patient characteristics. Hence, characteristics such as do-
nor age and sex should not be associated with any prognostic
factor of the patients. However, even if the blood units of in-
terest are effectively randomly allocated, a patient who re-
ceives many transfusions overall is more likely to receive 1 or
more of these units. Because underlying disease severity is
linkedtoboththenumberoftransfusionsandtheriskofdeath,
a comparison of the risk of death among patients who did re-
ceive particular blood units of interest and those who did not
can still be confounded. As such, meticulous adjustments
are warranted. In this case, adjustment for the total number
of transfusions will break the association between disease se-
verity and the exposure of interest and will thus remove the
confounding. More important, because the association be-
tween the number of transfusions and the risk of death is not
direct,26 this adjustment must be set up flexibly to allow non-
linear associations. In addition, because the distribution of
donor age, as well as patient mortality, may differ geographi-
cally, analyses must also account for the hospital. A detailed
description of the analytical background is found in the
eAppendix and eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement.
Wedesignedaretrospectivecohortstudysimilartotheone
described by Chassé et al.21 The analyses were restricted to the
period from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2012. We in-
cluded all patients who were recorded to have received at least
1 red blood cell transfusion in this period. We excluded pa-
tientswhoreceivedautologoustransfusionsorunitsthatcould
not be traced to an identified donor. Patients who received
transfusions were followed up from the date of the first trans-
fusion until death, emigration, or end of follow-up. To in-
crease the sensitivity for short-term survival effects, we also
performed analyses in which the patients were followed up for
a maximum of 30 days.
Given its importance in mediating the confounding ef-
fectofdiseaseseverity(eAppendixintheSupplement),wefirst
examined the association between total number of red blood
cell transfusions and risk of death using 3 separate statistical
modelsbasedonthe30-dayfollow-upmodel.Wefitted1model
that incorporated only a log-linear term for number of trans-
fusions; another model in which this variable was catego-
rized as 1 to 10 or 11 to 20, and so on; and a third model in which
number of transfusions was fitted as a restricted cubic spline
with 5 knots (eAppendix in the Supplement). For each of the
3 models, we then extracted the predicted hazard ratio (HR)
Key Points
Question Does the sex and age of blood donors affect survival of
patients receiving transfusions?
Findings In this binational cohort study, which included 968 264
patients who received transfusions, there was no association
between age and/or sex of blood donors and survival of patients.
Even among the patients who received multiple units of blood
from very young or very old donors, absolute mortality differences
compared with patients who received no such units of blood were
consistently below 0.5%.
Meaning The age and sex of blood donors do not influence
patient survival and need not be considered in blood allocation.

for all possible values for the “number of transfusions” vari-
able, with 15 transfusions arbitrarily set as the reference. As
an objective measure of model fit to compare the 3 models, we
used the Akaike information criterion.27
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed from September 15 to
November 15, 2016. All blood units were categorized by donor
age (<20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, or ≥70 years)
and sex (male or female). The main exposure of interest was
the number of red blood cell transfusions from donors of dif-
ferent age and sex. The cumulative number of transfusions of
each category was allowed to change in a time-dependent
manner during follow-up. Because the SCANDAT2 database
records only the date and not the exact time of transfusion,
exposure was allowed to change only once per day. The rela-
tive risk of death, expressed as HRs, in relation to the number
of blood units from donors of a particular age or sex was esti-
mated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. The
models were set up using the Andersen-Gill counting process
model.28 More important, in all analyses, we only incorpo-
rated information that was known at the time to be repre-
sented in the model. Analyses were conducted separately for
donor age and donor sex exposures.
We used 2 different analytical approaches. First, we fit-
ted 1 set of models that were similar to those in the analyses
by Chassé et al.21 Specifically, we added 1 variable for each of
the exposures of interest to the same model. For the models
investigating associations between donor and recipient mor-
tality, we included 1 variable for each donor age category ex-
cept for the reference category (40-49 years). These variables
contained each recipient’
s attained number of blood units of
each donor age category. Similarly, in the models of the asso-
ciation between donor sex and recipient mortality, we in-
cluded 1 variable for the number of units originating from fe-
male donors, with blood from male donors as the reference.
Because we thought that adding several highly correlated vari-
ables in the same model might lead to distorted results, we also
set up an alternative approach that was different from the one
used by Chassé et al.21 We instead performed 1 statistical analy-
sis per donor characteristic variable. For donor age, this meant
7 separate analyses (1 for each age group variable), and for do-
norsex,2separateanalyses(1forthenumberofunitsfrommale
donors and 1 for the number of units from female donors). In
each of these models, the reference category constituted re-
cipients of all other types of units.
In both of the approaches outlined, all variables for num-
ber of units of each category were fitted as log-linear terms,
but to examine possible dose-response effects in more detail,
we also performed analyses in which the number of units from
donors of a particular age or sex was categorized as 0, 1 to 2,
or3ormoreunits.Thecategoricalanalysiswasperformedonly
for the second approach. For the categorized analyses, we also
computedcovariate-adjustedcumulativemortalityforeachex-
posure group, and cumulative mortality differences at 30 days
to provide a more clinically relevant outcome measure.
Bothmainsetsofanalyseswereotherwisesimilarandwere
designed to be identical to the analyses in the Canadian study,
wherever possible. Adjustment was thus performed for the cu-
mulative number of transfusions, patient age, patient sex, and
Charlson Comorbidity Index,29,30 as ascertained from the re-
spective patient register (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for
coding details). Because the association between the number
of transfusions and the risk of death was distinctly nonlinear
on the log scale (eFigure 3 in the Supplement), we fitted this
variable as a restricted cubic spline with 5 knots to account for
nonlinearity (eAppendix in the Supplement). To allow com-
parison with the results from the study by Chassé et al,21 in
which this adjustment was performed using a log-linear term,
wealsofittedmodelsadjustingforcumulativenumberoftrans-
fusions as a log-linear term. Because we included data from a
large number of hospitals, which may differ both in donor de-
mographics and patient mortality, we also adjusted for hos-
pital by stratifying the Cox proportional hazards regression
model for this variable.
To validate the overall statistical approach, we per-
formed an analysis in which, instead of using the actual age
and sex of the contributing donors, we assigned the donor age
and donor sex of each blood unit randomly according to the
donorageandsexdistributionpresentedinthestudybyChassé
et al.21 This analysis was based on the premise that receipt of
1 or more red blood cell units with a certain randomly as-
signed characteristic should not be causally associated with
patient outcomes.31 The analysis otherwise followed the same
approach as the main analyses.
All data processing and statistical analyses were con-
ducted using SAS statistical analysis software, version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc). The data set for the time-dependent model was
designed using the publicly available Stratify macro.32
Results
Of the 1 015 159 patients in the database who received trans-
fusions between 2003 and 2012, a total of 981 971 received at
least 1 red blood cell unit. After exclusion of 13 271 patients who
received transfusions from donors with uncertain identity and
436 patients who received autologous transfusions, 968 264
patients remained for analysis. The characteristics of the study
population are presented in Table 1. The median age of the pa-
tientsatthefirsttransfusionwas73.0years(interquartilerange,
59.8-82.4 years), 550 257 (56.8%) were women, and 569 119
(58.8%) were from Sweden.
eFigure 3 in the Supplement depicts the estimated asso-
ciationbetweenthecumulativenumberofredbloodcelltrans-
fusions and the HR of death when the number of transfu-
sions was fitted as a log-linear term, a categorical term, and
using a spline function. The log-linear assumption resulted in
the poorest model fit (as indicated by the highest Akaike
information criterion), and the model using a restricted cubic
spline resulted in the best model fit.

sociationbetweenthenumbersoftransfusedredbloodcellunits

in model 1 (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04) but not in model 2 (HR,
1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01).
Results from the second analytical approach, in which we
consideredthedifferentvariablesfordonorageandsexinsepa-
rate models, are presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement. As
in Table 2, we saw statistically significant associations only in
the unadjusted model and in model 1, in which we adjusted
for number of red blood cell transfusions as a log-linear term.
Here,associationswerestrongerthaninTable2,withHRsrang-

a donor who was 70 years of age or older. With more careful
adjustment for number of transfusions using restrictive cu-
bic splines, all associations disappeared. Results from analy-
ses with unrestricted follow-up were largely similar (eTable 2
in the Supplement).
More important, when the exposure in eTable 2 in the
Supplement was categorized according to number of red blood
cell transfusions of each respective blood category, no clear
dose-response effects emerged (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Whenwecomparedpatientswhoreceived3ormoreunitswith
a particular characteristic with patients who received no such
units, adjusted 30-day cumulative mortality differences were
consistently below 0.5%, with upper 95% confidence limits no
higher than 1.0% (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
The sensitivity analyses considering the effects of blood
units from donors with randomly assigned age and sex are pre-
sented in Table 3. Despite the fact that the analyses were con-
ducted on data for which the exposure of interest was ran-
domly assigned and for which there should thus be no genuine
causal associations with the outcome, models that adjusted
for the number of transfusions using a linear term produced
statistically significant associations with the lowest HRs in the
most common blood category and with increasing HRs with
more extreme (and more uncommon) categories, just as in
Table 2. And, as in Table 2, all associations were removed with
full statistical adjustment.
Discussion
Following a recent publication from a Canadian research group
reportingincreasedmortalityamongpatientswhoreceivedred
blood cell transfusions from both young donors and female
donors,21 we set out to replicate these findings in an indepen-
dent patient cohort. Using the same analytical approach as in
the Canadian study, we were able to replicate their findings
with some variation in point estimates. However, after adjust-
ing more carefully for the total number of red blood cell trans-
fusions, neither donor age nor donor sex was associated with
patientmortality.Assumingourapproachiscorrect,thesefind-
ings indicate that, with regard to recipient outcomes, neither
of these donor characteristics need be considered when allo-
cating red blood cell units for transfusion.
Formostpatients,theallocationofbloodunitsfollowsvery
predictablerules.Typically,whenaclinicianordersabloodunit
for a patient, the local blood bank will select the oldest avail-
able unit of a compatible blood type. Other blood unit char-
acteristics, such as donor age and sex, can therefore be as-
sumed to be randomly distributed among patients. When

a The donor age and sex of each blood unit was randomly allocated according to
the age and sex distributions of the donors in the study by Chassé et al.21
Percentages may not total 100% owing to rounding.
bHazard ratios are per transfused blood unit.
c The unadjusted model only included terms for donor age/or sex. Model 1
adjusted for number of red blood cell transfusions as a log-linear term. Model 2
adjusted for number of red blood cell transfusions as a restricted cubic spline
with 5 knots. All 3 models were stratified by hospital to account for regional
differences. Both model 1 and model 2 also included parameters for Charlson
Comorbidity Index score, sex, and age.

based health data registers, we were able to characterize the
nonlinear association between number of red blood cell
transfusions33 and recipient risk of death. Based on this analy-
sis, we created a statistical model that corrected for this factor
very carefully. We then verified the adequacy of our statistical
modelusingasimplesimulationinwhichtheageandsexofthe
contributing blood donors were assigned randomly. Again, this
process revealed strong associations in the unadjusted model
but no associations in the fully adjusted model.
Limitations
There are some differences between the study by Chassé et al21
and our study that should be mentioned. First, there may be
higher-level differences in donor demographics, blood-bank
logistics, and component manufacture processes that may at
least theoretically have contributed to some of the differ-
ences in the results. Moreover, it is quite likely that there are
differences between the patients who received transfusions in
Scandinavia and the patients who received transfusions in
Canada, including mean follow-up and patient mortality,
which, in turn, may affect relative risk magnitudes. The key
difference between the 2 studies is rather the difference in ad-
justing for the key confounding factor, number of transfu-
sions, in which we show that insufficient attention to this vari-
ablewillresultinstrongassociationsbetweennumberofblood
components from young or very old donors and recipient
risk of death, even when donor age and sex were assigned
randomly in a simulation. Therefore, we believe that, rather
than reflecting true biological effects, the Canadian results can
be explained by residual confounding (ie, that the observa-
tions resulted from incomplete adjustment for the number of
transfusions).
Conclusions
The age and sex of donors of red blood cell units are unlikely
to influence the survival of patients receiving transfusions.
In addition, we believe these data reinforce the importance of
extreme caution in assessing epidemiologic analyses in this
field given the tremendous clinical and logistical implica-
tions of false-positive findings.
