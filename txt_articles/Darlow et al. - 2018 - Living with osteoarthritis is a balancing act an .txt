Abstract
Background: This study aimed to explore the beliefs of people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) about the disease, and
how these beliefs had formed and what impact these beliefs had on activity participation, health behaviour, and
self-management.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 people with knee OA recruited from general practices,
community physiotherapy clinics, and public advertisements in two provinces of New Zealand. Data were analysed
using Interpretive Description.
Results: Two key themes emerged. 1) Knowledge: certainty and uncertainty described participants’ strong beliefs about
anatomical changes in their knee. Participants’ beliefs in a biomechanical model of progressive joint degradation often
appeared to originate within clinical encounters and from literal interpretation of the term ‘wear and tear’. These beliefs
led to uncertainty regarding interpretation of daily symptoms and participants’ ability to influence the rate of decline
and certainty that joint replacement surgery represented the only effective solution to fix the damaged knee. 2) Living
with OA described broader perspectives of living with OA and the perceived need to balance competing values and
risks when making decisions about activity participation, medication, attentional focus, accessing care, and making the
most of today without sabotaging tomorrow. Misunderstandings about knee OA negatively impacted on activity
participation, health behaviours, and self-management decisions.
Conclusion: Biomechanical models of OA reduced participant exploration of management options and underpinned a
perceived need to balance competing values. Improved information provision to people with knee OA could help
guide positive health behaviour and self-management decisions and ensure these decisions are grounded in current
evidence.

Background
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common condition that causes
considerable disability and high levels of health expend-
iture [1, 2]. Knee OA accounts for over 80% of the total
OA disease burden [3] and its prevalence is rapidly
increasing [4]. This will have considerable social and eco-
nomic consequences, particularly as people with OA are
twice as likely to be absent from work or retire early due
to ill-health [5, 6].
People’s beliefs about knee OA have an important im-
pact on their lived experience of the disease, influencing
activity levels, social and leisure participation, and emo-
tional wellbeing [7, 8]. Beliefs about knee OA aetiology
have been explored in a number of qualitative studies,
indicating that many people consider OA to be an
inevitable part of ageing that is influenced by wear and
tear due to joint use and obesity [9–12]. There is a com-
monly held mechanical view of OA that focuses on loss
of cartilage and bone abutting directly on bone [10, 13].

 Physical inactivity may predispose to knee OA [4, 14]
and physical activity is a key tenet of OA management
recommendations [15]. Beliefs about physical activity
among people with knee OA have been explored in the
context of general physical activity [16] and adherence to
exercise-based OA self-management programmes [9, 17].
Beliefs that OA is caused by wear and tear result in worry
that weight bearing exercise will exacerbate joint damage
[17] and these concerns may cause people to reduce activ-
ity levels or avoid activities [16].
There is currently inadequate understanding of how
people’s beliefs about knee OA are informed. Given the
discordance between evidence-based physical activity
recommendations for knee OA and consumer beliefs
about OA aetiology and the role of activity, it is import-
ant to address the gap in the literature regarding how
people’s beliefs about knee OA and activity are formed
and what specific impact these beliefs have on activity
participation and self-management. Improved under-
standing of how beliefs are formed and factors that
influence this process may enable clinicians to positively
influence beliefs about knee OA and improve people’s
experience of living with this condition.
This qualitative study aimed to explore the beliefs of
New Zealanders with knee OA about the disease, and in
particular, how these beliefs had formed and what
specific impact these beliefs had on activity participation,
health behaviour, and self-management.
Methods
This study adhered to the Consolidated criteria for
reporting qualitative studies (COREQ; Additional file 1).
Research design
Qualitative data were gathered and analysed using Inter-
pretive Description [18, 19]. This methodology aims to
inform clinical understanding by identifying themes and
patterns within participant perspectives [18, 19]. The
study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. The
University of Otago Human Ethics Committee (Health)
(H15/081) approved the study and participants gave
written informed consent.
Recruitment
Participants were recruited in two provinces of New
Zealand from general practices and community physio-
therapy clinics, and from advertisements to Arthritis
New Zealand members and in public areas such as
libraries, swimming pools, and supermarkets.
Participants were included in the study if they had
been told by a health care professional that they had
knee OA. Participants were excluded if they had received
a total knee replacement or could not speak English.
There
was
no
age
limitation.
Purposive
sampling
maximised the range of viewpoints in terms of gender,
age, cultural backgrounds, disease severity, and level of
functional limitation [20].
Data collection
Participants were interviewed by experienced qualitative
researchers (MB or BT) in a location of their choice; for
most, this was the participant’s home. Participants were
unknown to interviewers prior to recruitment and were
asked to speak to interviewers as lay people. Interviews
were conducted in person; face-to-face or by web-based
video-conferencing. Participants were able to have a
support person present, but all chose to be interviewed
alone. A semi-structured interview schedule was devel-
oped using questions framed around research aims, but
kept flexible to allow participants to focus on what they
deemed important (Table 1). Interviews consisted of
open-ended questions to elicit the participants’ views on
their experiences and perceptions of knee OA, including
activity. Afterward, participants completed a demographic
questionnaire including self-reported duration of knee
pain and clinicians consulted, the Oxford Knee Scale [21]
to indicate functional limitation, and the Pain Self-Efficacy
Questionnaire [22] to indicate confidence in performing
activities despite pain. Interviews were audio-recorded
and transcribed verbatim; field notes were also kept.
Data analysis
Recruitment, data collection, and data analysis occurred
concurrently to enable collected data to inform subse-
quent interviews and to cease recruitment once theme
saturation was achieved. Data were managed using
NVivo 11 software (QSR International Pty Ltd).
Initial transcript coding was undertaken independently
by MB and BT on a line-by-line basis using ‘open
coding’ to allow multiple codes to be applied to single
segments
of
data.
These
researchers
subsequently
discussed and agreed on codes and categories within
each
transcript.
The
relationships
between
and
within categories emerging from this process were
explored with increasingly higher levels of conceptu-
alisation. Negative case analysis was used to broaden

 understandings and challenge initial interpretations of the
data [20]. Transcripts and coding were crosschecked by
another researcher (BD), with all disagreements resolved
through regular discussions. Theme documentation was
checked and discussed with other authors (BH/RG/JHA/
EM) following eight interviews and again following thir-
teen interviews to further develop the emerging analysis,
ensure themes represented participants’ reported experi-
ences and views, and test assumptions related to theme
saturation. Consistent with Interpretive Description, par-
ticipants did not review transcripts or validate findings
[19] and there were no repeat interviews.
Research team
The research team consisted of academics and clinicians
with backgrounds in family medicine (BH), health coach-
ing (MB), nursing (EM), occupational therapy (BT),
physiotherapy (BD/JHA), and rheumatology (RG). Several
researchers (BD/MB/BT/JHA/RG/EM) had experience
with qualitative research in musculoskeletal pain.
Results
Thirteen participants were interviewed (Table 2). Ten fur-
ther eligible respondents were not interviewed because
their characteristics were similar to previous participants
(n = 7), they changed their mind (n = 1), or were unable to
schedule time for the interview (n = 2). Interviews lasted
60 to 90 min. Data saturation was achieved after eight in-
terviews.
Five
further
participants
were
purposively
recruited and interviewed, but no further themes or sig-
nificant variations on existing themes emerged.
Two overarching themes emerged from the data;,
Knowledge: certainty and uncertainty and Living with
osteoarthritis. Findings are presented with illustrative
extracts from participants’ interviews; additional quotes
are in Additional files 2 and 3. An additional theme
emerged around Health System Support; as this large
theme was conceptually distinct and unrelated to the
primary aims of this study, it will be presented in a
future publication.
Knowledge: certainty and uncertainty
This theme described participants’ beliefs about OA and
how it should be managed, describing how these beliefs
have been formed and influenced as well as the impact
of these beliefs.

 pathological changes in their knees. The phrases ‘wear
and tear’
, ‘bone-on-bone’
, and ‘missing cartilage’ were
used frequently to explain their understanding of OA:
“It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to work out that [it’s
bone-on-bone]. If the fluid between the ball-bearing
and the thing has all gone, you know, it’s like a car
situation.”
–Tui
For many, certainty about this biomechanical model of
structural deterioration led to a matter-of-fact attitude,
and often a lack of curiosity about seeking information
or exploring management options:
“It’s sort of like a pound of butter. That’s what it is! It’s
butter. Arthritis is arthritis.”
–George
Despite the sense of certainty around the biomechan-
ical model, participants often had no explanations for
the variability of symptoms, the speed of potential deg-
radation, or the best ways to optimise function and slow
deterioration. This model of progressive deterioration
was in conflict with some participants’ experiences of
stable or improving symptoms. Participants appeared
not to recognise this discordance.
Participants saw ‘wear and tear’ as synonymous with
OA and interpreted the concept literally. Consequently,
participants felt that they needed to protect their joint to
prevent further wear and tear. These concepts were
often reported as originating with, or being reinforced
by, health professionals:
“They always say same thing: wear and tear, you
know, you’re getting older.”
–Iosefo
Many participants had been shown X-rays that pro-
vided graphic evidence of the loss of space between
bone ends. Participants expressed shock at seeing
these changes; several explained that the X-rays led
them to believe that they needed to protect their
knee from further damage. These concepts were rein-
forced by what participants saw, heard, and felt from
their knee (such as a bowed appearance, grinding, or
knocking):
“It’s really obvious I have no cushioning in that knee.”
–John
Approaches to osteoarthritis management
The strongly-held model of ongoing structural deterior-
ation led to participants using strategies such as: avoiding,
reducing, or pacing activities to limit wear and tear; partici-
pating in activities they considered not to cause joint im-
pact; and taking natural supplements to lubricate the joints
(e.g. fish oil) or feed the cartilage (e.g. glucosamine or gel-
atine). Two participants (‘Linda’ and ‘William’) attributed
their successes in managing OA to specific weight-loss
management or strength-based exercise regimes.
Pain or stiffness guided activity participation or avoid-
ance, but participants were often uncertain about these
choices. Some participants interpreted pain that lasted
after they stopped exercise as a sign of further damage,
whereas pain that abated was a reminder to be careful.
Participants’ understandings of helpful and unhelpful
strategies were strongly influenced by their structural
model of what was happening to, and beliefs about what
might be safe or good for, the knee:
“[Biking] there’s no load on your knees… it’s keeping
you in motion, keeping you active, and it’s not stress or
anything on your knees.”
–Anne
Participants often spoke about stages of management
related to the degree of joint degeneration. These in-
cluded things they had done in the past and things they
may try in future. Participants planned to continue with
their current strategies until these were no longer effect-
ive, indicating progression to another stage. Differing
stages helped explain why certain remedies might work
for some people but not others:
“All that sort of stuff [like glucosamine] is supposed to
help your cartilage and protect it. But once it’s not there,
it’s not going to make more of it … once it’s gone it’s gone.”
–Karen
Although participants expressed hope that they may
be able to maintain the status quo or slow the rate of de-
terioration, they were generally resigned to progressive
degradation over which they had little control. The inev-
itability of further deterioration was supported by the
beliefs that OA is part of ageing and the joint is worn
away by movement.
“I don’t think it would improve. It may stay the same,
but I would expect it to get worse… you can’t change
osteoarthritis.”
–Karen
Darlow et al. BMC Rheumatology  (2018) 2:15 
Page 4 of 9
 Participants anticipated increasing pain and activity
limitation, which would reduce their quality of life:
“It worries me that one day I won’t be able to do the
things I can do today.”
–Linda
Participants believed joint replacement surgery is inevitable
and represents the only effective solution to fix OA (albeit a
temporary fix, as they expected the joint replacement would
also wear out). This belief was expressed most participants
including those with early-stage OA and those who
expressed positive expectations around managing day-to-day.
Living with osteoarthritis
This theme described broader perspectives of living with
OA and the decisions and trade-offs that participants
made based on their beliefs about OA.
The big picture
When discussing the meaning of symptoms and symp-
tom fluctuation participants did not usually talk about
structural changes within their knee. Rather, they talked
about how pain and symptoms limited activity and
day-to-day life, and OA’s broader effects on, and interac-
tions with, mood, wellbeing, and sleep.
Participants often downplayed OA and used minimis-
ing language to discuss the condition and its effects.
Regardless of age of onset, participants saw OA as part of
getting older. Participants perceived OA was not as ser-
ious as other health conditions, such as cancer, and a topic
that would bore their peers or health professionals. Some
participants explicitly downplayed the condition to reduce
OA’s place in their lives, or avoid being perceived as a
moaner or identifying as ‘someone with arthritis’.
“I decided I don’t want this to define me, I’m much
more than my knee.”
–Susan
Similarly, many perceived OA was downplayed by cli-
nicians; some commented that this was harmful:
“I’ve made a decision not to use that [term ‘wear and
tear’]… the implication is that it’s not unusual and
everybody gets it and, you know, it’s not something we
need to take any notice of.”
–Brenda
Participants knew that they could not keep playing it
down forever. They anticipated a time when OA would
affect more than day-to-day activities and begin to affect
their core identity and sense of self. Loss of satisfaction or
identity were key indicators that it was time for surgery.
Participants discussed benefits of exercise for general
physical and mental health and for managing comorbidi-
ties.
Some
participants
reported
exercising
despite
concerns about further wear and tear:
“I’m prepared to face up with a bit of further
degeneration in my right knee if everything else benefits.”
–George
Living with osteoarthritis is a balancing act
Participants saw living with OA as a ‘balancing act’. Par-
ticipants’ understandings of OA and expectations of
future decline, combined with uncertainty about the
meaning of fluctuating symptoms and effects of exercise
or movement, led to balancing competing values and
risks (Fig. 1). On the one hand, participants identified
benefits of activity for their knee and general health, but
on the other hand they were concerned about increasing
pain or further joint degradation:
“Am I strengthening it or am I sort of destroying the
cartilage? I don’t know.”
–William
Participants considered the safety of an exercise for the
knee when weighing benefits against costs or risks. How-
ever, ‘safe’ activities were not always activities participants
liked, felt comfortable with, or were able to do. There was
also tension between the notion of the knee needing rest,
pacing, and protection versus the need to keep moving, to
keep one’s identity, and to get on with things.
“It’s the balance between activity and rest for the
joint… I’m probably wearing it more, but weighing
that up against not doing anything then everything
else will fall apart.”
–Susan
Participants spoke about the importance of putting
OA out of their minds and not letting it define their
identity but simultaneously balancing this with the need
to plan and choose activities.
“It’s not always at the front of my mind, but it’s probably
always in the back of my mind… because it has to be.”
–Karen
Darlow et al. BMC Rheumatology  (2018) 2:15 
Page 5 of 9
 Expectation of progressive decline meant participants
wanted to be active while still able, but equally they were
concerned that activity would accelerate their joint
degradation:
“I’ve got a window of time to do all these things in. But
then, at the same time, I’ve got to do this in a way
that doesn’t impact that window of time, make it
shorter than it otherwise would be. So it’s really, yeah,
finding that balance.”
–Linda
Many participants mentioned the cost-benefit payoff
between medication and side effects, especially as anal-
gesics were not addressing the perceived inevitable
degeneration:
“All it’s really doing is taking the pain away a little
bit. But the joint continues to deteriorate, the pain gets
worse.”
–James
Many participants wanted to delay surgery as long as
possible due to concerns about surgery, recovery times,
and uncertainty about how long the new joint would
last. However, they were also concerned about the
impact of increasing age or disability on joint replace-
ment outcomes.
Discussion
This study explored beliefs about the OA disease process
and impact in people with knee OA. In particular, and
not fully explored in previous literature, it also ex-
plored belief formation and influence on decisions
about activity participation, health behaviours, and
self-management. Irrespective of duration or severity
of knee symptoms, all participants viewed OA as
progressive joint degradation due to wear and tear
and ageing. Participants’ biomechanical explanation of
symptoms and expectations of inevitable decline ap-
peared to be derived from, or perpetuated by, clini-
cians’ language and explanations. Despite the limited
correlation between X-ray findings and symptoms or
disability
[23],
participants
considered
that
their
symptoms directly reflected their joint surface condi-
tion as seen on X-ray. Previous studies have indicated
that clinicians may trivialise or minimise OA and
associate it with old age and these findings were supported
by the current study [9, 11, 24, 25]. This may influence a
fatalistic attitude amongst people with knee OA and pes-
simism about engaging in care [9–11].
Participants preferred to discuss the impact of knee
OA on their daily lives rather than explain their under-
standing of the biological mechanisms involved, which

Page 6 of 9
 they saw as straightforward. Consistent with findings
from
people
with
rheumatoid
arthritis,
participants
sought a balance between managing OA and living their
daily lives, and matched management strategies to their
perceived stage of disease [26]. Pouli et al. [10] found
that people with knee OA weigh the pain relieving bene-
fits of medication against the negative side effects or risk
of dependence. The current study expands understand-
ing of the range of factors people with knee OA balance
in their daily lives. These include balancing benefits of
physical activity against risks, ‘safe’ activities against
activities they enjoyed, putting OA out of their mind
while also planning lives around it, not being perceived
as a moaner while also accessing necessary care, and
making the most of their current function without jeo-
pardising the future.
This study confirms that those with knee OA are often
cautious of physical activity due to fear of accelerating
joint degradation [12, 16, 17], and that some people en-
gage in activity despite concerns or expectations of dam-
age because of perceived benefits related to their general
health and well-being [17]. These beliefs conflict with re-
search demonstrating that exercise improves cartilage
volumes, is safe for people with OA, and improves pain
and function [27–31].
A number of studies have reported ambivalent views
about joint replacement surgery in people with knee OA
as a result of concerns about the surgery effectiveness,
surgical risk, recovery times, and a compromised sense
of internal control [10, 11, 24]. These concerns were dis-
cussed by participants in the current study, however,
they strongly believed that joint replacement surgery
was the only way to fix their knee joint and an inevitable
part of their clinical journey. Reasons for this discrep-
ancy could be explored with future research. Expecta-
tions
of
inevitable
decline
and
ultimate
joint
replacement surgery decreased exploration of, and en-
gagement in, strategies to improve joint function and
health.
Strengths and limitations
The qualitative methodology allowed in-depth explor-
ation of participants’ beliefs about knee OA. Transcripts
were independently analysed by two researchers to in-
crease rigour and all findings were reviewed and debated
by the entire interdisciplinary research team. Participants
were recruited from two geographically separate prov-
inces of New Zealand and the sampling frame enabled
inclusion of participants with a range of characteristics.
There was no age restriction, however, no participants
under 50 years of age volunteered to participate. Conse-
quently, this study does not represent the views of youn-
ger people with knee OA, however, it does represent the
main age group affected. Recruitment continued until
no new themes emerged from the data. Saturation was
achieved after eight interviews, demonstrating strong
commonalities in language and beliefs despite differ-
ences in background, disease severity, and functional
limitation. This study was not designed to explore differ-
ences between subgroups with different characteristics
(e.g. length of symptoms or disease severity), however,
beliefs and conceptual frameworks were surprisingly
consistent. Information provided to participants may
have been different from what they reported, however,
the use of ‘wear and tear’ and minimisation of OA by
clinicians has been directly observed in consultations
[25]. Although these findings are consistent with those
found with other populations [13, 16, 17], caution is ad-
vised when applying these findings to other settings. The
inclusion of consumers as part of the research team
could have added insights to the analysis.
Implications for clinical practice and future research
People with OA make difficult decisions on a daily basis,
but many decisions are premised on inaccurate informa-
tion or beliefs that are often not addressed, and may
even be promulgated, by clinicians. Clinicians’ use of the
term ‘wear and tear’ may represent an attempt to
present the diagnosis of OA in a less threatening way or
an effort to shift focus from the diagnosis of ‘osteoarth-
ritis’ to strategies for managing symptoms and improv-
ing function [25, 32]. However, participants saw ‘wear
and tear’ as being synonymous with ‘osteoarthritis’
, so it
did not reduce the threat associated with diagnosis. Lit-
eral interpretation of ‘wear and tear’ established inaccur-
ate biomechanical models that reinforced the perceived
need to limit activity to protect the joint and thereby
prevented
engagement
in
positive
self-management.
Minimisation associated with ‘it’s just wear and tear’
may also limit access to appropriate care and reduce the
perceived need to engage in proactive self-management
and behaviour change.
Information provided to people with OA should focus
on living with OA rather than biomedical aspects of the
disease [33]. The current study highlights a need to ad-
dress unhelpful or inaccurate language and beliefs. Par-
ticipants’ universal adoption of a biomedical model
limited
activity
participation,
increased
uncertainty,
negatively influenced expectations for the future, and
forced people with knee OA to make unnecessary
decisions and trade-offs. These findings will be used
to
inform
the
development
of
novel
information
resources. Future research should explore the impact
of
information
resources
on
modifying
patients’
beliefs about knee OA and empowering increased
participation in activities and behaviours known to
improve pain, function, and experiences of living
with OA.

 Conclusions
Participants’ biomechanical models of OA and expecta-
tions of inevitable decline were influenced by clinicians’
language and explanations. These beliefs reduced partici-
pant exploration of management options and under-
pinned a perceived need to balance competing values.
Improved information provision to people with knee OA
could
help
guide
positive
health
behaviour
and
self-management decisions and ensure these decisions
are grounded in current evidence.
