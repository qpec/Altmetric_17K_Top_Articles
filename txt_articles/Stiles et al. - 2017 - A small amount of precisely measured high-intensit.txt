Abstract
Background: Physical inactivity is a highly modifiable risk factor for the development of
osteoporosis but, due to a lack of research that has precisely and objectively meaured
physical activity (PA) relevant to bone, the specific contribution that PA can make to bone
health is poorly understood. This study examined whether a more precise measure of
PA relelvant to bone was associated with meaures of bone health in pre- and post-
menopausal women in UK Biobank.
Methods: Time spent at intensities specific to bone health [�750 milli-gravitational units
(mg) and �1000 mg] were analysed from raw tri-axial acceleration data averaged over
1-second epochs from 7-day monitoring of habitual PA using accelerometry-based activ-
ity monitors (100 Hz; AX3, Axivity, UK) of 1218 pre- and 1316 post-menopausal healthy
women. In a cross-sectional analysis, associations between categories of time (<1, 1–2
and �2 minutes) spent above the intensity thresholds and calcaneal quantitative ultra-
sound measures of bone health (bone mineral density T-score, BMDT-score; speed of
sound, SOS; and broadband ultrasound attenuation, BUA) were examined.
Results: Compared with <1 minute, spending 1–2 or �2 minutes/day at intensities
�1000 mg in pre-menopausal and �750 mg in post-menopausal women was positively
associated with BMDT-score, SOS and BUA.
Conclusion: Brief bursts of high-intensity PA relevant to bone health can be captured by
applying bone-specific thresholds of intensity to raw tri-axial accelerations averaged

running in pre-menopausal women and slow jogging in post-menopausal women, is
associated with better bone health.

Introduction
Osteoporosis is a brittle bone disease that affects women
(one in three) more than men (one in five) especially over
the age of 50.1,2 It causes over 300 000 people a year in the
UK3 and over 2 million in the USA4 to suffer a fragility
fracture resulting in significant pain, disability, loss of in-
dependence and increased risk of morbidity, especially in
the first 6 months after fracture.2,3 In women, the inci-
dence of osteoporosis increases dramatically post meno-
pause1–3; therefore, identification of strategies that may
optimize bone health in both pre- and post-menopausal
women is a priority.
Physical inactivity is a highly modifiable risk factor for
the development of osteoporosis5–7 but the specific contri-
bution that physical activity (PA) can make to accruing,
maintaining or minimizing the loss of bone mass is poorly
understood compared with other modifiable lifestyle risk
factors such as diet, smoking and alcohol.2,7–9 Whereas PA
guidelines recommending the accumulation of at least
150 minutes/week of moderate PA, in bouts of 10 minutes
or more, exist for cardivascular and metabolic health,10,11
there are no specific PA recommendations for reducing the
risk of poor bone health that likely benefits from a differ-
ent dose of activity characterized by short, dynamic, spor-
adic bursts.12,13 The development of bone-specific PA
guidelines is limited by a lack of research that has precisely
and objectively assessed the influence of exercise interven-
tions2,14
or
habitual
PA
on
bone-health
outcomes.
Consequently, there is a lack of evidence for positive
associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and
moderate or vigorous intensities of PA in women.15,16
Until recently, the outcome for objectively measured PA
in large cross-sectional bone-health studies has been time-
accumulated in sedentary-, light-, moderate- or vigorous-
intensity categories determined from proprietary counts
(device-specific) from hip-worn monitors summed over
user-defined 15- or 60-second epochs.15,16 The classifica-
tion of the intensities corresponds to energy expenditure
during steady-state exercise, making them most relevant to
cardiovascular and metabolic health.17–19 Chastin and col-
leagues16 suggest that their counterintuitive finding for the
absence of an association between BMD and PA at mod-
erate and vigorous intensities may be due to summarising
proprietary counts from hip-worn accelerometry-based ac-
tivity monitors over 60-second epochs. For short dynamic
episodes of activity, averaging has the effect of over-
smoothing, misclassifying and underestimating time spent
in moderate or vigorous intensities, thus failing to capture
the very activities that are likely to benefit bone.16
Classification of activity into intensity categories calibrated
with energy expenditure from steady-state activity relevant
to cardiovascular and metabolic health outcomes may also
contribute to the failure to detect an association between
more dynamic intensities of PA and bone health.20–22
The commercial availability of high-resolution tri-axial
accelerometry-based activity monitors that collect and
store raw acceleration data at up to 100 Hz for 7 days pro-
vides the opportunity to more precisely measure intensities
Key Messages
• Brief bursts of high-intensity habitual physical activity (PA) beneficial to bone health can be quantified from acceler-
ations measured at the wrist with accelerometry-based activity monitors.
• This method provides a step-change in the ability to precisely and objectively measure PA relevant to bone from
commercially available tri-axial wrist-worn monitors typically employed in large population studies.
• Accumulating 1–2 minutes or �2 minutes per day of high-intensity PA, equivalent to running in pre-menopausal
women and slow jogging in post-menopausal women, is associated with better bone health.
• Future research should further exploit high-resolution accelerometry-based activity monitor data to determine the op-
timal temporal characteristics of PA for bone health to inform the development of manageable and effective PA inter-
ventions.

 of PA beneficial to bone. We calibrated raw peak acceler-
ation from these monitors worn on the hip and wrist with
external ground reaction force in adults21 and determined
the magnitude of acceleration associated with ground reac-
tion forces that are beneficial to bone in pre-menopausal
women.23 Providing a valid measure of activity relevant to
bone from wrist-worn monitors is particularly important
because, compared with hip-worn monitors, they result in
higher levels of participant compliance, greater wear-time
and therefore more accurate measures of habitual PA.24
The use of wrist-worn monitors to objectively measure PA
is becoming more common in large population surveys and
national health databases including UK Biobank.
UK Biobank is a new open-access large-scale prospect-
ive epidemiological resource that holds baseline measures
on 500 000 adults including quantitative ultrasound scan-
ning (QUS) of the heel and, in a sub-sample of approxi-
mately 100 000 participants, objective measurement of
habitual (free-living) PA from 7-day monitoring using a
commercial
wrist-worn
tri-axial
accelerometer
that
sampled and stored raw accelerations at 100 Hz. These
high-resolution files present a unique opportunity to derive
a more precise measure of PA relevant to bone from raw
acceleration data in a large cross-sectional study. Brief
bursts of high-intensity activity can be quantified using in-
tensity thresholds specific to bone health. We hypothesize
that precise bone-specific measures of PA will predict
measures of bone health in both pre- and post-menopausal
women independently of PA accrued at all other intensities
and other factors thought to influence bone.
Methods
Questionnaire and baseline physical measures including
QUS of the heel were collected from 500 000 adults aged
40–69 years attending one of 21 assessment centres across
Britain between 2006 and 2010. Objective measurements
of PA were collected in a sub-sample (approximately 100
000) of the same cohort between 2013 and 2015. Details
of recruitment and measurements used to obtain data for
this resource can be found on the UK Biobank website:
https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk.
Study sample
To reduce the influence of conditions or treatments affect-
ing either bone health or PA, only ‘healthy’ individuals, in
the order outlined in Figure 1, were selected. For compari-
son, where complete sets of data were available, general
health and activity characteristics for excluded pre- and
post-menopausal samples are presented (Figure 1). Pre-
menopausal (n ¼ 1218) and post-menopausal (n ¼ 1316)
women forming the included sample were analysed separ-
ately due to the potential for different PA intensity thresh-
olds to predict bone health in each group.
Bone-health outcome measures
Participants had calcaneal QUS measurements of their left
and right calcaneus performed using the Sahara Clinical
Bone Sonometer (Hologic, Bedford, MA). BMDT-scores
(number of standard deviations above or below peak BMD
from a young sex-matched average) were derived from esti-
mated BMD, calculated using the following formula:
Heel BMD ¼ 0:002592 � ðBUA þ SOSÞ–3:687g=cm2;
where SOS is the speed of sound (m/s) and BUA is the
broadband ultrasound attenuation (dH/MHz).25 The QUS
measurements were averaged between the left and right
calcaneus (one measurement from each) for each partici-
pant. In accordance with good practice, daily quality-
control and cleaning procedures were conducted in line
with the manufacturer’s recommendations across all as-
sessment centres. Further details of the QUS testing proto-
col are available on the UK Biobank website.
PA monitoring
Raw acceleration files (.cwa) containing 7-day, 100-Hz
data from tri-axial AX3 (Axivity, Newcastle, UK) acceler-
ometers worn on the dominant wrist were downloaded
from
UK
Biobank
and
auto-calibrated,
re-sampled
(100 Hz) and converted to .wav format using open-source
software (Omgui Version 1.0.0.28; Axivity). An open-
access package (GGIR Version 1.3–2) in R (http://cran.r-
project.org/)
was
used
to
convert
raw
accelerations
(x-, y- and z-axes) in .wav files to magnitudes of dy-
namic acceleration [resultant vector magnitude, corrected
for gravity, expressed as Euclidean Norm Minus One
(ENMO) in milli-gravitational units, mg26,27] averaged
over 1-second epochs from which time accumulated at dif-
ferent intensities from 6 valid days (16 hours/day), includ-
ing one weekend day, of wear was used to calculate an
average day of activity. Month of PA measurement was ex-
tracted to allow for any adjustments in PA due to seasonal
variation to be made.
Using wrist-worn monitors that produce acceleration
magnitudes equivalent to the AX3,28 Hildebrand and col-
leagues19 found thresholds of approximately 100 mg and
400 mg represented moderate and vigorous intensities of
activity based on energy expenditure for 3 and 6 METs, re-
spectively, in adults (aged 34 6 10 years). The moderate in-
tensity approximated brisk walking, with the vigorous

 threshold just over half the 750 mg output elicited during
running (8 km/h)—an activity that has been found to ex-
ceed impact magnitudes and loading rates beneficial to
bone.23,29,30 When calibrating acceleration magnitudes
with ground reaction force beneficial to bone,23 the thresh-
olds we identified corresponded to the acceleration magni-
tudes found during running at 8 km/h (slow jogging) and
10 km/h, equivalent to 750 mg and 1000 mg when averag-
ing over 1-second epochs.19,31 Time spent at intensities
�750 mg (PA � 750 mg) and �1000 mg (PA � 1000 mg)
were therefore used in the present study to examine thresh-
olds of activity specific to bone.
Covariates
Variables collected by UK Biobank that were believed to
be, or have previously been shown to be, associated with
bone health and/or PA were treated as potential covariates.

 Baseline measures for age, height, fat mass and fat-free
mass (bioelectrical impedance; Tanita BC418MA), self-
reported alcohol, nutritional intake and current medica-
tions were extracted from UK Biobank. Whereas estimated
calcium intake (mg) could intuitively be an important de-
terminant of bone health, it was not included as a covariate
in this report due to only half the sample providing data
for it and the absence of any correlation (r ¼ 0.001) be-
tween calcium intake and BMDT-score in the half that did
provide a measure. Estimated alcohol consumption (units/
week) was calculated from self-reported volumes of intake
multiplied by units for each alcohol type.32 Continuous
variables for age at menarche, the number of years taking
contraceptive and years since the menopause (where ap-
plicable) were extracted or calculated from female-specific
factors from the touchscreen questionnaire. The number of
years between baseline and PA measures was also calcu-
lated to allow any influence in time between measures of
bone health and PA to be examined. Covariates for PA
(50–99 mg and 100–749 or 100–999 mg) were created to
allow associations between time spent at higher intensities
and measures of bone health to be analysed independently
of time spent being in activities at all other intensities. To
reduce the amount of dilution that light-intensity activity
(which may also be beneficial to bone)16 has on measures
of moderate activity and above, time spent in 50–99 mg
was used as a separate PA covariate to time spent between
100–749 mg and 100–999 mg for respective analyses.
Statistical data analysis
For the first stage of the model-building process, all of the
covariates were entered simultaneously into the regression
model (Model 1) without removal (e.g. all entered covari-
ates remained in the model irrespective of their p-value).
Plotting the residuals of this covariate model against
PA � 750 mg or PA � 1000 mg indicated that the relation-
ship was curvilinear, requiring a second-order polynomial
to model it. For ease of interpretation, we decided to ad-
dress the curvilinear relationship by converting the con-
tinuous
PA � 750 mg/PA � 1000 mg
variables
into
categorical variables (<1, 1–2, �2 minutes/day). The par-
ameters of these categories were chosen after examining
the distribution of time spent at intensities �1000 mg and
�750 mg for pre- and post-menopausal women, respect-
ively, and consideration of the lowest accumulated dose of
PA that would lend itself to a plausable public health mes-
sage. Consequently, for the second stage of the model-
building process (Model 2), we entered the categorical
variables for PA � 750 mg/PA � 1000 mg (<1 minute/day
being the reference category) into the model that contained
all of the covariates with BMDT-score as the outcome
measure. The models were repeated with BUA and SOS as
the outcome measures. A sample size of n � 1200 and
n � 1300
in
each
group
provides
�90%
power
(at
p ¼ 0.05) to detect very small (�1%, partial R2 change-
¼ 0.011) increases in the explained variance of bone health
by
adding
PA � 750 mg/PA � 1000 mg
to
a
covariate
model that already explains �10% of the variance. All
analyses were carried out in IBM SPSS Version 23 (IBM,
Chicago, IL).
Results
Descriptive statistics for measures of bone health, covari-
ates and PA-by-intensity variables are reported in Table 1
for pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women separ-
ately. Means and standard deviations are reported for nor-
mally distributed variables and medians and interquartile
ranges for variables that are positively skewed. There was
no need to adjust PA data for the potential effects of sea-
sonality, as there was no evidence in this sample that PA
differed by season (e.g. summer vs autumn, vs winter
and vs spring were all p � 0.20 for PA � 1000 mg in the
pre-menopausal group and PA � 750 mg in the post-
menopausal group). Tables 2 and 3 report the beta-
coefficients [with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and
p-values] for all the PA-by-intensity variables obtained
from the full model (Model 2) that best predicted bone-
health measures for pre-menopausal and post-menopausal
women. In addition, the R2 increase for the PA � 750 mg
or PA � 1000 mg variable was reported.
Pre-menopausal women
Whereas there was some evidence that the time spent in
PA � 750 mg was positively associated with BMDT-score
(p ¼ 0.04), the evidence for PA � 1000 mg was much stron-
ger (p ¼ 0.001). Additional analysis implied that time spent
in PA at 750–999 mg (p ¼ 0.16) did not contribute at all to
the association of PA � 750 mg; it was due almost com-
pletely to time spent at PA � 1000 mg. For this reason, we
are not reporting the PA � 750 mg variable for pre-
menopausal women, as this would lead to inappropriate
recommendations; we are only reporting the results of the
model that examined PA � 1000 mg. In this final model,
PA � 1000 mg was the only PA-by-intensity variable that
was associated with BMD [e.g. BMD was 0.20 (p ¼ 0.024)
and 0.29 (p < 0.001) T-scores higher in pre-menopausal
women who spent 1–2 minutes/day and � 2 minutes/day,
respectively, in PA � 1000 mg than in pre-menopausal
women who spent<1 minute/day at that intensity; R2
increased by 1.2% (p ¼ 0.001) from the 1.4% covariate
model]. There was no evidence that time spent in PA at

 50–99 mg or PA at 100–999 mg were related to BMD with
or without PA � 1000 mg in the model (with: p ¼ 0.943
and
p ¼ 0.987,
respectively;
without:
p ¼ 0.674
and
p ¼ 0.211, respectively). The pattern of results was very
similar when SOS and BUA were used as the markers of
bone health.
Post-menopausal women
In post-menopausal women, the association was much
stronger between BMD and PA � 750 mg than between
BMD
and
PA � 1000 mg
(unlike
in
pre-menopausal
women). Additional analysis showed that the association
with PA � 750 mg was due almost completely to time spent
in PA at 750–999 mg (p < 0.001), and not at all to time
spent in PA � 1000 mg (p ¼ 0.79). For this reason, we are
not
reporting
the
PA � 1000 mg
variable
for
post-
menopausal women, as this would lead to inappropriate
recommendations; we are only reporting the results of the
model that examined the PA � 750 mg variable (which
clearly includes time in PA � 1000 mg). In this final model,
PA � 750 mg was the only PA-by-intensity variable that
was associated with BMD [e.g. BMD was 0.16 (p ¼ 0.024)
and 0.27 (p ¼ 0.001) T-scores higher in post-menopausal
women who spent 1–2 minutes/day and�2 minutes/day,
respectively, in PA � 750 mg than in post-menopausal
women who spent <1 minute/day at that intensity; R2
increased by 0.9% (p ¼ 0.002) from the 7.2% covariate
model]. There was no evidence that time spent in PA at
50–99 mg or PA at 100–749 mg were related to BMD with
or without PA � 750 mg in the model (with: p ¼ 0.823 and
p ¼ 0.226, respectively; without: p ¼ 0.408 and p ¼ 0.808,
respectively). The pattern of results was very similar when
SOS and BUA were used as the markers of bone health.
Discussion
Using a bone-health-specific, precise and objective meas-
ures of time spent in high-intensity dynamic activity, we
have demonstrated a step-change in the ability to measure
PA relevant to bone and revealed a positive association be-
tween habitual physical activity and bone health in both
pre- and post-menopausal women. In contrast to previous

 commercially available accelerometers over 15- or 60-se-
cond epochs,15,16 the averaging of raw accelerations over
1-second epochs ensured that brief bursts of high-intensity
habitual PA more relevant to bone were captured, enabling
bone-specific intensity thresholds to be applied. With a
view to developing realistic and achievable bone- and
population-specific public health messages, it is promising
to find that relatively small amounts (1–2 minutes) of ha-
bitual PA at �1000 mg in pre-menopausal and �750 mg in
post-menopausal women are positively associated with
measures of bone health. High-impact activity is generally
considered necessary to stimulate bone cells to benefit
BMD,13 but this osteogenic effect has not always been
found in post-menopausal women.29
To explain why bone-health measures are associated
with a different threshold of intensity in pre- and post-
menopausal women, it is possible as a result of bone
strength declining with age that a lower-intensity activity
in post-menopausal women produces a local bone strain
equivalent to a higher-intensity activity in pre-menopausal
women.33 This is further supported by higher loading rates
in mature women (55 BW/s, 69) compared with younger
women (37 BW/s, 68) when running at the same speed.34
Therefore, a lower threshold of high-intensity activity
(750 mg equivalent to a slow jog) in post-menopausal
women may provide the same mechanical stimulation as a
higher threshold of high-intensity activity (e.g. 1000 mg
equivalent running at 10 km/h) in pre-menopausal women.
By extension, it may also be interesting to consider the po-
tential for a lower intensity of activity to create sufficient
local strain to stimulate bone formation in a less healthy
population with lower levels of bone health. However, the
close proximity of BMDT-scores of the excluded and
included participants observed in the current study (–0.21
and –0.11, respectively, for pre-menopausal women and –
0.72 and –0.63, respectively, for post-menopausal women)
suggests that the activity intensities associated with bone
health in each excluded menopausal group may not be that
dissimilar to respective intensities of the included samples.
Nonetheless, it would be interesting to further explore
these intensities in a wider, potentially less healthy popula-
tion with full consideration of a comprehensive list of
covariates relevant to the sample.
To our knowledge, no other research producing dy-
namic measures of acceleration (ENMO) from raw acceler-
ations (100 Hz) averaged over 1-second epochs to quantify
PA relevant to bone is available for comparison. However,
methods using a non-commercial uniaxial waist-worn ac-
celerometer with an on-board processor to count the num-
ber of impact peaks in vertical acceleration during an
activity intervention found that positive changes in BMD
and calcaneal BUA were evident from fewer than 100 daily
impacts over 3.9 g (standard acceleration due to gravity)—
a threshold that is indicative of running and jumping.30
This supports the positive associations found for time spent
above magnitudes equivalent to running in the present
study.
Our results are counter to reports of osteogenic bene-
fits35 and changes in bone structural properties8 from
walking, which yield average (1-second epochs) acceler-
ations of 170 mg during steady-state activity.19 A high
number (approximately 8500) of peak accelerations at low
intensity (0.3–1 g represents walking30) have been found to
significantly predict changes in bone structure, e.g. circum-
ference and cortical thickness at the proximal tibia.8 Given
that low-level stimulations normally ‘ignored’ by bone
may become highly anabolic if performed at higher fre-
quencies,36,37 it may be that osteogenic benefits from
lower-intensity
accelerations
averaged
over
1-second
epochs can only be recognized if wider characteristics of
PA frequency, bout length and intermittence are also
described.8,38,39 Therefore, further research should also
consider the temporal characteristics of PA such as the dis-
tribution of activity bouts and rest periods over discrete
periods of time.8,13,22,40,41
The development of a primary population-based strat-
egy to increase PA at all ages in order to prevent osteopor-
osis and reduce the risk of fragility fractures has been
limited by a scarcity of research that has accurately deter-
mined the influence of exercise intervention type, uptake
and compliance on bone-health outcomes using precise,
objective measurements of PA.2,14 This study demonstrates
that the method used to analyse raw accelerations from
commercially available tri-axial wrist-worn monitors, typ-
ically employed in large population studies, can be used to
precisely and objectively capture high-intensity PA relevant
to bone. This could be used to evaluate the influence of PA
interventions on bone health and to inform the develop-
ment of manageable PA guidelines specific to bone.
A number of limitations of the present study are
acknowledged.
Averaging
accelerations
over
1-second
epochs captured high-intensity activity relevant to bone
more accurately than previous studies summing counts
over 15- or 60-second epochs; however, it was not possible
to count the magnitude of individual peaks in raw acceler-
ation using this method. The thresholds used in this study,
however, were specific to the intensities of activity benefi-
cial to bone and are meaningful in that they can be
described in relation to running speed and duration. In UK
Biobank, accelerometer data were collected from monitors
worn on the dominant wrist, whereas our thresholds and
those of Hildebrand et al.19 were developed using the non-
dominant wrist. Evidence suggests, however, that differ-
ences in accelerometer output between the dominant and

 non-dominant wrist are minimal at higher intensities.31
Therefore, unless an activity that dominates on one side is
taking place, e.g. racket sports, these high-intensity thresh-
olds are likely appropriate for either wrist. It should also
be acknowledged that accelerometers only measure accel-
eration and are not able to capture loading, e.g. from
resistance-type training, which can also benefit bone
health.
QUS measurements were used in UK Biobank rather
than the current gold standard of DXA for measuring
bone, as it provides a radiation-free and inexpensive
method for measuring the density and micro-architectural
properties of bone. The ultrasound-derived modulus of
elasticity, as measured by the SOS, correlates strongly with
values of bone-breaking strength derived from static load-
ing, whereas BUA values are reported to be dependent
upon trabecular orientation in vitro and to be significantly
associated with bone structure independently of BMD.
These results can be combined to provide a single estimate,
which is an analogue of BMD.42 Whereas QUS is not used
clinically in the UK, it provides a useful research tool to
measure calcaneal estimated BMD and is affected by
weight-bearing activity, with the calcaneus having a tra-
becular content similar to that of the spine and represent-
ing more metabolically active bone, which is likely to
respond to mechanical and hormonal stimuli more rapidly
than cortical bone sites.42 Finally, as this is a cross-
sectional study, it may be susceptible to reverse causality
whereby time spent being physically active at a high inten-
sity could be influenced by bone health.
In conclusion, using precise, objective measures of high-
intensity dynamic activity, we found that 1–2 minutes per
day of high-intensity dynamic PA, equivalent to running in
pre-menopausal
women
and
slow
jogging
in
post-
menopausal women, is associated with better bone health.
