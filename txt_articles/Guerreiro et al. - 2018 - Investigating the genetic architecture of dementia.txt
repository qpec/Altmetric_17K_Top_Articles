 Investigating the genetic architecture of dementia with Lewy 
bodies: a two-stage genome-wide association study
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.
Summary
Background—Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia in 
elderly people but has been overshadowed in the research field, partly because of similarities 
between dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. So far, to our 
knowledge, no large-scale genetic study of dementia with Lewy bodies has been done. To better 
understand the genetic basis of dementia with Lewy bodies, we have done a genome-wide 
association study with the aim of identifying genetic risk factors for this disorder.
Methods—In this two-stage genome-wide association study, we collected samples from white 
participants of European ancestry who had been diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies 
according to established clinical or pathological criteria. In the discovery stage (with the case 
cohort recruited from 22 centres in ten countries and the controls derived from two publicly 
available database of Genotypes and Phenotypes studies [phs000404.v1.p1 and phs000982.v1.p1] 
in the USA), we performed genotyping and exploited the recently established Haplotype 
Reference Consortium panel as the basis for imputation. Pathological samples were ascertained 
following autopsy in each individual brain bank, whereas clinical samples were collected after 
participant examination. There was no specific timeframe for collection of samples. We did 
association analyses in all participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, and also only in 
participants with pathological diagnosis. In the replication stage, we performed genotyping of

 significant and suggestive results from the discovery stage. Lastly, we did a meta-analysis of both 
stages under a fixed-effects model and used logistic regression to test for association in each stage.
Findings—This study included 1743 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (1324 with 
pathological diagnosis) and 4454 controls (1216 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies vs 3791 
controls in the discovery stage; 527 vs 663 in the replication stage). Results confirm previously 
reported associations: APOE (rs429358; odds ratio [OR] 2·40, 95% CI 2·14–2·70; p=1·05 × 
10−48), SNCA (rs7681440; OR 0·73, 0·66–0·81; p=6·39 × 10−10), and GBA (rs35749011; OR 
2·55, 1·88–3·46; p=1·78 × 10−9). They also provide some evidence for a novel candidate locus, 
namely CNTN1 (rs7314908; OR 1·51, 1·27–1·79; p=2·32 × 10−6); further replication will be 
important. Additionally, we estimate the heritable component of dementia with Lewy bodies to be 
about 36%.
Interpretation—Despite the small sample size for a genome-wide association study, and 
acknowledging the potential biases from ascertaining samples from multiple locations, we present 
the most comprehensive and well powered genetic study in dementia with Lewy bodies so far. 
These data show that common genetic variability has a role in the disease.
Introduction
Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s 
disease.1 Despite this fact, very little attention has been devoted to understanding the 
pathogenesis of this disorder, particularly when compared with the other common 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
So far, the only fully penetrant genetic variants that have been identified and replicated as a 
specific cause of dementia with Lewy bodies are SNCA point mutations and gene dosage. 
Three major factors might have contributed to this low number of causative mutations. First, 
dementia with Lewy bodies, often a disease of old age, is not commonly seen in multiplex 
kindreds, meaning that successful linkage studies have been rare.2 Second, the accurate 
clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is complex, with a high rate of 
misdiagnosis.3 Third, even the largest cohorts of dementia with Lewy body samples have 
been generally small, in many instances including as few as 100 patients.4,5 However, the 
fact that dementia with Lewy bodies has a strong genetic component is currently 
indisputable. The ε4 allele of APOE is recognised to be a strong risk factor,6,7 as are 
heterozygous mutations and common polymorphisms in the glucocerebrosidase gene 
(GBA).8 Both of these results have stemmed from candidate gene association studies; APOE 
was known to be strongly associated with Alzheimer’s disease and GBA was known to be a 
strong risk factor for Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body disorders. In addition to these 
genetic associations with susceptibility, in 2016, our group provided evidence that dementia 
with Lewy bodies has a heritable component.9
No overlap in common genetic risk has been shown to exist between Parkinson’s disease and 
Alzheimer’s disease,10 a fact that is not entirely surprising in view of the differences in 
phenotype. However, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the overlaps and differences in 
clinical and pathological presentation between dementia with Lewy bodies and both 
Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease stem, at least in part, from aspects in their

 underlying genetic architecture and, consequently, disease pathobiology. Specific genes and 
loci associated with disease and the strength of association are factors that can be expected 
to modulate these phenotypic overlaps and differences. However, despite these encouraging 
findings, large-scale, unbiased genetic studies of dementia with Lewy bodies have not yet 
been done, which is probably due to the difficulty in identifying large, homogeneous cohorts 
of people with the disease.
To address the need for more powerful and comprehensive genetic studies of dementia with 
Lewy bodies, we performed the first large-scale genome-wide association study in this 
disease.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this two-stage genome-wide association study, we examined data from white participants 
of European ancestry who had been diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies according to 
either clinical or pathological consensus criteria.11 Most participants were diagnosed using 
pathological criteria and were included only when the likelihood of a diagnosis of dementia 
with Lewy bodies was “intermediate” or “high”.11 Samples were collected at 22 different 
centres across ten countries in Europe, North America, and Australia. Pathological samples 
were ascertained following autopsy in each individual brain bank, whereas clinical samples 
were collected after participant examination. There was no specific timeframe for collection 
of samples. White control participants in the discovery stage are part of the “general 
research use” controls from the two studies publicly available at the database of Genotypes 
and Phenotypes (The Genetic Architecture of Smoking and Smoking Cessation 
[phs000404.v1.p1] and Genetic Analysis of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis 
[phs000982.v1.p1]). For the replication stage, white controls were from the Mayo Clinic 
Florida control database. Investigators at every site obtained written informed consent from 
patients and control individuals and approval from a local ethics committee.
Discovery stage: genotyping, quality control, imputation, and statistical analysis
Participants with dementia with Lewy bodies were genotyped in either the Illumina 
Omni2.5M array or the Illumina OmniExpress genotyping array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, 
USA). Controls were genotyped in either the Illumina Omni2.5M array or the Illumina 
Omni1M array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Autosomal variants with GenTrain scores 
of more than 0·7 were included in the quality control stage. We removed single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) with a call rate of less than 95%, a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p 
value in controls of less than 1 × 10−7, or a minor allele frequency of less than 0·01. Samples 
were removed if they had substantial non-European admixture, were duplicates or first-
degree or second-degree relatives of other samples, had a genotype call rate of less than 
98%, or had substantial cryptic relatedness scores (PI_HAT >0·1).
We determined population outliers by principal components analysis, using SNPs passing 
the aforementioned quality-control filters. We used PLINK (version 1.9)12 to do linkage 
disequilibrium-based pruning. Genotypes for remaining SNPs were combined with

 1000Genomes phase 3 genotypes for samples from the YRI, CEU, JPT, and CHB reference 
populations, and subjected to principal components analysis. Individuals lying farther than a 
quarter of the distance between CEU and JPT/CHB/YRI when plotted on the axes of the first 
two principal components were deemed to have substantial non-European admixture and 
were excluded (appendix p 8).
Because samples were genotyped in a variety of arrays, we selected only variants that 
intersected between all arrays to be included in the imputation stage. We performed 
imputation using the most recent reference panels provided by the Haplotype Reference 
Consortium (version 1.1, 2016). We used Eagle (version 2.3) to prephase haplotypes on the 
basis of genotype data.13,14 We did the imputation using the Michigan Imputation Server.15 
Following imputation, we kept variants passing a standard imputation quality threshold 
(R2≥0·3) for further analysis.
We used logistic regression, implemented in PLINK1.9,12 to test for association of hard-call 
variants with the binary case–control phenotype using sex as a covariate. We examined 
variants under an additive model (ie, effect of each minor allele) and estimated odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% CIs. To control for population stratification, we used coordinates from the 
top six principal component dimensions as additional covariates in the logistic regression 
models. We used Q–Q plots and the genomic inflation factor (λ) to test for residual effects 
of population stratification not fully controlled for by the inclusion of the principal 
components analysis and cohort covariates in the regression model. Additionally, we have 
done a subanalysis in the discovery stage, including only participants with pathologically 
diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies.
Moreover, to take into account the uncertainty of imputation, we have done the same 
association in PLINK1.9 using dosage data.
We did gene-wise burden tests using all variants with an effect in protein sequence and a 
maximum minor allele frequency of 5%, using SKAT-O16,17 as implemented in EPACTS.18 
We used the top six principal components and sex as covariates in the burden test.
Replication stage: genotyping and power analysis
Replication was attempted for top variants showing a p value in the discovery stage of less 
than 5 × 10−6. We tested a total of 32 signals for replication using a Sequenom MassARRAY 
iPLEX SNP panel (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA; appendix p 4). We did power 
calculations for replication sample size selection using the R package RPower. We estimated 
a mean statistical power of 81% for the 32 signals on the basis of sample size, variant 
frequency, and effect size in the discovery stage, and used a replication p value threshold of 
0·05. We tested associations in the replication stage using logistic regression models 
adjusted for age (age at onset for the patients with clinically diagnosed dementia with Lewy 
bodies, age at death for the patients with a high pathological likelihood of dementia with 
Lewy bodies, and age at recruitment to study for controls) and sex.
We did a combined meta-analysis of stage 1 and 2 with GWAMA19 under a fixed-effects 
model, using estimates of the allelic OR and 95% CIs.

 Estimation of phenotypic variance
To estimate the phenotypic variance explained by the genotyped SNPs in this cohort, we 
used genetic restricted maximum likelihood analysis as implemented in the Genome-wide 
Complex Trait Analysis tool.20,21 We used the first ten principal components as covariates 
and a disease prevalence of 0·1%.22 We also estimated the partitioned heritability by 
chromosome, for which a separate genetic relationship matrix was generated for each 
chromosome. Each matrix was then run in a separate restricted maximum likelihood 
analysis. We applied linear regression to determine the relation between heritability and 
chromosome length.

Results
This study included a total of 1743 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and 4454 
controls. The majority of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies were neuropathologically 
assessed (n=1324), providing a greater level of diagnostic detail. 987 participants with 
dementia with Lewy bodies were genotyped with the Illumina Omni2.5M array and 700 
with the Illumina OmniExpress genotyping array. 1523 controls were genotyped with the 
Illumina Omni2.5M array and 2847 with the Illumina Omni1M array. Application of quality 
control filters to the dataset at the discovery stage yielded high-quality genotypes at 448 155 
SNPs for 1216 participants with dementia with Lewy bodies and 3791 controls (table 1). A 
total of 52 participants with dementia with Lewy bodies were excluded for cryptic 
relatedness, 20 for genetic ancestry, and the remaining 399 for low call rates or poor 
genotyping. After imputation and quality control, genotypes for 8 397 716 variants were 
available for downstream analyses. After linkage disequilibrium-based pruning with PLINK 
(version 1.9)12 to quasi-independence (variance inflation factor=2), 130 715 SNPs remained 
in the dataset. The Q–Q plot and genomic inflation factor (λ=1·01) indicated good control of 
population stratification (appendix p 9).
Five regions were associated with dementia with Lewy bodies risk at genome-wide 
significance (p<5 × 10−8) in the discovery stage (figure 1; table 2). These regions included 
the previously described Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease loci APOE (rs429358; 
OR 2·40, 95% CI 2·14–2·70; p=1·05 × 10−48), SNCA (rs7681440; OR 0·73, 0·66–0·81; 
p=6·39 × 10−10), and GBA (rs35749011; OR 2·55, 1·88–3·46; p=1·78 × 10−9). Additionally, 
loci overlapping BCL7C/STX1B (rs897984; OR 0·74, 0·67–0·82; p=3·30 × 10−9) and 
GABRB3 (rs1426210; OR 1·34, 1·21–1·48; p=2·62 × 10−8) were also genome-wide 
significant. A subanalysis including only participants with pathologically diagnosed 
dementia with Lewy bodies revealed that all but GABRB3 maintained their genome-wide 
significance in that smaller dataset (table 2; appendix p 11). Furthermore, when undertaking 
the same associations in PLINK1.9 to take into account the uncertainty of imputation, results 
were identical to the best-guess calls (appendix p 8).

 A total of 527 participants with dementia with Lewy bodies and 663 controls from the Mayo 
Clinic were included in the replication stage (table 3). The replication stage of the genome-
wide association study design provided independent replication (p<0·05) for three of the loci 
(APOE, SNCA, and GBA), all of which were also genome-wide significant in the combined 
analysis of both stages (table 2; appendix p 4).
In the discovery stage, suggestive evidence of an association (p<5 × 10−6) with dementia 
with Lewy bodies was also seen for two loci: SOX17 and CNTN1. The association at 
SOX17 did not replicate (appendix p 4). For CNTN1, the association with dementia with 
Lewy bodies (rs7314908; 1·51, 95% CI 1·27–1·79; p=2·32 × 10−6) improved slightly when 
performing the subanalysis on the participants with pathologically confirmed dementia with 
Lewy bodies (rs7314908; OR 1·58, 1·32–1·88; p=4·32 × 10−7), and this candidate locus 
showed evidence of replication with very similar effect size to that in the discovery stage 
(rs79329964; OR 1·54, 1·32–1·79; p=0·03; rs79329964 was used in replication as a proxy 
for rs7314908).
A systematic assessment of genetic loci previously associated with Alzheimer’s disease or 
Parkinson’s disease showed no evidence of other genome-wide significant associations in 
this dementia with Lewy bodies cohort (appendix p 5). These loci include the TREM2 locus, 
where the p.Arg47His variant has been shown to have a strong effect in Alzheimer’s disease.
24 In our cohort this variant did not show genome-wide significant levels of association (OR 
3·46, 95% CI 1·54–7·77; p=0·002), despite the over-representation in people with dementia 
with Lewy bodies compared with controls. Similarly, MAPT, which is strongly associated 
with Parkinson’s disease and has been previously linked to dementia with Lewy bodies,25 
shows no strong evidence of association in this study (rs17649553; OR 0·86, 0·76–0·96; 
p=0·0126).
To examine whether the association with SNCA is independent of that seen in Parkinson’s 
disease, we conditioned our analysis on the top Parkinson’s disease variant (rs356182), 
which showed only a negligible effect on the DLB association (conditioned OR 0·70, 95% 
CI 0·63–0·78; p=2·89 × 10−10; figure 2). To gain insight into potential regulatory effects of 
this distinct SNCA signal, we used expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from the 
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project Consortium and the Harvard Brain Bank 
Resource Center to determine whether rs7681440 and rs7681154 (a variant shown to have 
an independent association for Parkinson’s disease that is in strong linkage disequilibrium 
[R2=0·91] with the rs7681440 SNCA variant) affect gene expression as eQTLs. In the GTEx 
data, the most associated SNP in dementia with Lewy bodies is a strong eQTL in the 
cerebellum for RP11-67M1.1, a known antisense gene located at the 5′ end of SNCA, with 
the alternative allele showing a reduction in expression of RP11-67M1.1 (figure 3). 
Additionally, rs7681154 was associated with SNCA expression in the cerebellum using the 
Harvard Brain Bank Resource Center results (p=2·87 × 10−11; figure 3), with the alternative 
allele associated with increased SNCA expression.
We assessed linkage disequilibrium across the LRRK2 locus region and that analysis 
revealed that rs79329964 is in equilibrium with both p.Gly2019Ser (R2=0·000043) and with 
the Parkinson’s disease hit at this locus, rs76904798 (R2=0·003), suggesting rs79329964 to

 be an independent association from the Parkinson’s disease risk. Although samples were not 
screened for p.Gly2019Ser directly, the variant was well imputed (R2=0·94). The exclusion 
of all samples that carried the p.Gly2019Ser variant showed no significant effect on the 
association at the CNTN1 locus. Notably, the p.Gly2019Ser variant showed a higher minor 
allele frequency in participants with dementia with Lewy bodies (0·0021) than in controls 
(0·0003).
Gene-based burden analysis of all low frequency and rare variants (minor allele frequency 
<0·05) changing the aminoacid sequence, showed a single genome-wide significant result 
comprised of six variants at GBA (p.Asn409Ser, p.Thr408Met, p.Glu365Lys, p.Arg301His, 
p.Ile20Val, and p.Lys13Arg; p=1·29 × 10−13). No other gene showed evidence of strong 
association with disease or overlapped single variant analysis results (table 4).
Using the first ten principal components as covariates and a disease prevalence of 0·1%, 
estimation of the phenotypic variance attributed to genetic variants showed a heritable 
component of dementia with Lewy bodies of 36% (SD 0·03). As expected for a common 
complex disease, we found a strong correlation between chromosome length and heritability 
(p=6·88 × 10−5; figure 4).
The heritability for dementia with Lewy bodies at chromosome 19 is much higher than what 
would be expected considering the chromosome’s size and probably reflects the role of 
APOE. Notably, chromosomes 5, 6, 7, and 13 all have higher heritability for dementia with 
Lewy bodies than expected, although none of them has variants with genome-wide 
significant results.
Discussion
This is the first comprehensive, unbiased study of common and intermediate frequency 
genetic variability in dementia with Lewy bodies. We identified five genome-wide 
significant associations in the discovery stage (APOE, BCL7C/STX1B, SNCA, GBA, and 
GABRB3), with the associations regarding APOE, SNCA, and GBA being confirmed in the 
replication stage and in the combined analysis of both stages.
The most significant association signal is seen at the APOE locus (APOE ε4), which has 
been previously shown to be highly associated with dementia with Lewy bodies.6,7 As 
described, APOE ε4 is the major genetic risk locus for Alzheimer’s disease and has been 
implicated in cognitive impairment within Parkinson’s disease, although not with the risk of 
Parkinson’s disease itself. The locus has also been reported to affect the levels of both β-
amyloid and Lewy body pathology in brains of patients.27 In a small Finnish dataset,28 the 
ε4 allele association with dementia with Lewy bodies was largely driven by the subgroup 
with concomitant Alzheimer’s disease pathology.
The second strongest association is seen at the SNCA locus. Results from our conditioned 
analysis confirmed the different association profile between dementia with Lewy bodies and 
Parkinson’s disease that we had previously reported.7 SNCA is the most significant common 
genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease, with rs356182 having a meta-analysis p value of 
1·85 × 10−82 (OR 1·34, 1·30–1·38) in PDGene. This variant is located 3’ to the gene,29

 whereas in dementia with Lewy bodies, no association was found in that region (figure 2). 
The most associated dementia with Lewy bodies SNP for the SNCA locus (rs7681440) has a 
Parkinson’s disease meta-analysis p value of more than 0·05 in PDGene. When doing a 
conditional analysis on the top Parkinson’s disease SNP (rs356182), Nalls and colleagues29 
reported an independent association at the 5′ region of the gene (rs7681154), and this 
variant is in strong linkage disequilibrium (R2=0·91) with the rs7681440 SNCA variant 
identified in our study. It is tempting to speculate that these differences might reflect 
pathobiological differences between the two diseases, perhaps mediated by differential 
regulation of gene expression. The results in the GTEx data, showing that the most 
associated SNP in dementia with Lewy bodies is a strong eQTL in the cerebellum for 
RP11-67M1.1, are compatible with a model in which rs7681440 genotypes affect the 
expression levels of SNCA indirectly through the action of RP11-67M1.1. More specifically, 
the alternative allele associates with a decreased expression of RP11-67M1.1 and 
consequently reduced repression of SNCA transcription (increased SNCA expression), 
which is in accordance with an increased frequency of the alternative allele in participants 
with dementia with Lewy bodies when compared with controls. Additionally, the 
relationship between rs7681154 and SNCA expression is supported by the high expression 
of SNCA in the brain and the association of rs7681440 with increased SNCA expression in 
whole blood (p=2·13 × 10−38).30,31 However, further investigation of the identified 
significant eQTLs is needed because the effect was seen for only one brain region. This 
localised effect could plausibly result from low overall expression of RP11-67M1.1 and 
higher RNA quality in the cerebellum than in other assayed brain regions in these datasets. 
Notably, both eQTLs’ effects fit with a model of increased SNCA expression in participants 
with dementia with Lewy bodies compared with controls.
The most significant marker at the GBA locus (rs35682329) is located 85 781 base pairs 
downstream of the gene and is in high linkage disequilibrium (D′=0·9; R2=0·8) with 
p.Glu365Lys (also reported in the scientific literature as E365K, E326K, and rs2230288), 
which has been suggested as a risk factor for dementia with Lewy bodies.8 The top 
associated variant for Parkinson’s disease at this locus is the rs71628662 (PDGene meta-
analysis OR 0·52 [95% CI 0·46–0·58; p=6·86 × 10−28]). This variant is also in high linkage 
disequilibrium with the top SNP identified here (D′=0·9 and R2=0·8). In this study, we show 
similar effect sizes for APOE (OR 2·40) and GBA (OR 2·55) in dementia with Lewy bodies. 
Gene burden-based analysis showed GBA as the only genome-wide significant association 
with dementia with Lewy bodies risk. The inexistence of other associations should be 
interpreted with some caution. Because we were not ascertaining the complete spectrum of 
genetic variability, other genes could have had a significant burden of genetic variants that 
were simply not captured in our study design, despite our use of the most recent imputation 
panel.
Although in our meta-analysis we saw a genome-wide significant association with dementia 
with Lewy bodies at the BCL7C/STX1B locus, this association was mostly driven by the 
discovery-stage data (replication-stage results were OR 0·98; p=0·83) and further replication 
is needed. That being acknowledged, an association at the BCL7C/ STX1B locus has been 
previously reported for Parkinson’s disease.29,32 The top Parkinson’s disease-associated 
variants at this locus were rs14235 (synonymous; located at BCKDK) and rs4889603

 (intronic; located at SETD1A). The top SNP identified in dementia with Lewy bodies at this 
locus (rs897984) shows the same direction of association seen in Parkinson’s disease (OR 
0·93, 95% CI 0·90–0·96), a Parkinson’s disease meta-analysis p value of 1·34 × 10−5 (data 
from PDgene), and strong linkage disequilibrium with both Parkinson’s disease hits 
(R2=0·28–0·32; correlation p values<0·0001). This is a gene-rich region of the genome 
(appendix p 9), making accurate nomination of the gene driving the association difficult. 
Mining data from the GTEx project showed that rs897984 is not an eQTL for any gene in 
the locus. Nonetheless, in both Parkinson’s disease studies, the nominated gene at the locus 
was STX1B, probably due to its function as a synaptic receptor.33 Additionally, STX1B has 
a distinctive pattern of expression across tissues, presenting the highest expression in the 
brain. In this tissue, when compared with the closest genes in the locus (HSD3B7, BCL7C, 
ZNF668, MIR4519, CTF1, FBXL19, ORAI3, SETD1A, STX4), STX1B also shows the 
highest levels of expression (appendix p 10). In 2014, mutations in STX1B were shown to 
cause fever-associated epileptic syndromes34 and myoclonic astatic epilepsy.35
Although not quite genome-wide significant in the discovery stage, the association between 
CNTN1 and dementia with Lewy bodies risk replicated with a very similar association OR 
as the discovery stage. Interestingly, the locus has been previously associated with 
Parkinson’s disease in a genome-wide study of identical-by-descent segments in an 
Ashkenazi cohort,36 and with cerebral amyloid deposition, assessed with PET imaging in 
APOE ε4 non-carriers.37 This locus also did not reach genome-wide significance with 
clinicopathological Alzheimer’s disease dementia (p=5·21 × 10−6).38 The contact in 1 
protein, encoded by CNTN1, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored neuronal 
membrane protein that functions as a cell-adhesion molecule with important roles in axonal 
function.39,40 Mutations in CNTN1 were found to cause a familial form of lethal congenital 
myopathy.41 Contactin 1 drives Notch-signalling activation and modulates 
neuroinflammation events, possibly participating in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis 
and other inflammatory disorders.42 A functional protein association network analysis of 
CNTN1 using STRING shows contactin 1 is in the same network as PSEN2 (appendix p 
11), supporting its potential role in neurodegeneration. Further replication will be important 
in view of the absence of a genome-wide significant association in the discovery stage; 
however, this association seems promising. Notably, LRRK2 is located less than 500 000 
base pairs away from the most associated SNP at this locus, which could suggest that the 
association might be driven by variation at the LRRK2 locus. Further validation of the 
involvement of CNTN1 variation in modifying risk of dementia with Lewy bodies will be 
important.
In addition to performing a genome-wide association study with clinicopathological 
Alzheimer’s disease dementia, Beecham and colleagues38 also analysed commonly 
comorbid neuropathological features seen in elderly individuals with dementia, including 
Lewy body disease. In this latter analysis, only the APOE locus was found to achieve 
genome-wide significance. However, when testing known common Alzheimer’s disease risk 
variants with coincident neuropathological features, Beecham and colleagues identified hits 
at SORL1 and MEF2C, finding them to be nominally associated. In our cohort of 
participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, we found no genome-wide significant 
associations between these variants and disease. Similarly, we had previously reported an

 association at the SCARB2 locus with dementia with Lewy bodies.7 In the larger dataset of 
the present study, the association remained at the suggestive level and did not reach genome-
wide significance (most significant SNP in the present study, rs13141895; p=9·58 × 10−4). 
No other variant previously reported to be significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease 
or Parkinson’s disease in recent genome-wide association study meta-analyses showed a 
genome-wide significant association with dementia with Lewy bodies. The most significant 
Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease variants at the following loci showed nominal 
(p<0·05) association levels: MAPT, BIN1, GAK, HLA-DBQB1, CD2AP, INPP5D, 
ECHDC3, and SCIMP. Additionally, variants previously suggested to be associated with 
Lewy-related pathology in a Finnish cohort,28 did not show evidence of association in this 
study (appendix p 5). See appendix pp 12–70 for colocalisation plots of association between 
dementia with Lewy bodies and either Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease.
This study has notable limitations. The control population is not perfectly matched to the 
case cohort because it was derived from publicly available data. To address this, we have 
used all available information (both clinical and genetic) to create a control cohort that is as 
similar as possible to the case cohort. Additionally, despite using the same diagnostic criteria 
for all included participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, diagnostic measurements were 
collected in a variety of locations, suggesting that diagnostic accuracy might have been 
variable, with contamination from participants with Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s 
disease. Notably, we do not see an over-representation of genetic risk factors from those 
diseases in our results (eg, MAPT, CLU, or CR1), suggesting minimum inclusion. Similarly, 
population stratification could bias the results because samples were collected in various 
countries. In the present study, we have used standard methodology to correct for any such 
bias and, consequently, our results show no evidence of population stratification as 
evidenced by the Q–Q plot as defined by the acquired unbiased genotype data. Additionally, 
participants with dementia with Lewy bodies were genotyped at three locations and controls 
were all derived from publicly available datasets, using a mixture of genotyping arrays, 
which could provide a source of genotyping bias. However, our approach was to select 
variants that were at the intersection of all used arrays before imputation, which makes use, 
effectively, of the same genotyping probes for all samples. This approach has been shown to 
remove any bias from this type of result and any effects of using different array scanners are 
negligible for high-quality variants.43
This is the first large-scale genome-wide association study in dementia with Lewy bodies. 
We estimate the heritability of dementia with Lewy bodies to be approximately 36%, which 
is similar to what is known to occur in Parkinson’s disease.44 This finding shows that, 
despite not having multiple causative genes identified so far, genetics has a relevant role in 
the common forms of dementia with Lewy bodies. Additionally, we provide evidence 
suggesting that novel dementia with Lewy bodies loci are likely to be found at chromosomes 
5, 6, 7, and 13 in view of the high heritability estimates at these chromosomes. A significant 
majority of our case cohort in the present study was comprised of participants with 
neuropathological diagnoses, which provide a greater level of information for diagnostic 
accuracy. These results provide us with the first glimpse into the molecular pathogenesis of 
dementia with Lewy bodies; they reveal that this disorder has a strong genetic component 
and suggest a unique genetic risk profile. From a molecular perspective, dementia with

 Lewy bodies does not simply sit between Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease; 
instead, the combination of risk alleles is unique, with loci that are established risk factors 
for those diseases having no clear role in dementia with Lewy bodies (eg, MCCC1, STK39, 
CLU, CR1, or PICALM). Further increases in the size of dementia with Lewy body cohorts 
will probably reveal additional common genetic risk loci, and these will, in turn, improve 
understanding of this disease, its commonalities, and differences with other 
neurodegenerative conditions, ultimately allowing the identification of disease-specific 
targets for future therapeutic approaches.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the keywords “dementia Lewy bodies” AND “genetics”, for 
manuscripts published in any language between database inception and June 21, 2017, 
and found no large-scale genome-wide studies of dementia with Lewy bodies. So far, 
most studies have focused on small cohorts and are frequently candidate gene association 
studies. However, in 2014, we showed that dementia with Lewy bodies has a genetic 
component, suggesting that a large unbiased genetic association study might provide 
novel loci that have a role in the disease.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale genome-wide association study in dementia 
with Lewy bodies. The discovery stage included 1216 patients with dementia with Lewy 
bodies and 3791 controls, and the replication stage included 527 patients with the disease 
and 663 controls. The vast majority of people with the disease from both stages were 
neuropathologically diagnosed. Furthermore, despite the comparatively smaller size of 
the replication cohort, all samples were ascertained at the same centre, which reduces 
diagnostic heterogeneity.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data show several genome-wide significant loci. Some of these loci had previously 
been implicated in Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease, which could suggest that 
dementia with Lewy bodies is simply a combination of the genetic underpinnings 
underlying those diseases. However, our data suggest that dementia with Lewy bodies 
does not sit in the spectrum between Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, but 
instead, has a unique genetic profile. Additionally, we have also estimated the genetic 
heritability of dementia with Lewy bodies to be 36%, which is very close to what has 
been estimated for Parkinson’s disease, a disease now known to have a strong genetic 
component.

 Figure 1. Manhattan plot showing genome-wide p values of association
The p values were obtained by logistic-regression analysis using the first six principal 
components and sex as covariates. The y axis shows −log10 p values of 8 397 716 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms, and the x axis shows their chromosomal positions. The 
horizontal red dotted line represents the threshold of p=5 × 10−8 for Bonferroni significance 
and the green dotted line represents the threshold of p=5 × 10−6 for selecting single 
nucleotide polymorphisms for replication.

 Figure 2. Regional association plot for the SNCA locus
Purple represents variant rs1372517, at chromosome 4, position 90755909, which is the 
most associated SNP at the locus also present in the 1000Genomes dataset. The variant 
rs1372517 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs7681440. Colours represent linkage 
disequilibrium derived from 1000Genomes between each variant and the most associated 
SNP. SNP=single nucleotide polymorphism. R2 represents the level of pairwise linkage 
disequilibrium between the top variant and each other variant plotted, using data from the 
1000 Genomes project.

(A) Association between rs7681440 genotypes and RP11-67M1.1 expression in 103 disease-
free post-mortem cerebellum samples (p=2·00 × 10−7) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) Project Consortium. Carriers of the GG genotype (alternative allele) show the 
lowest levels of expression of the gene. Details on methods are on GTEx website. (B) 
Association between rs7681154 and SNCA expression (p=2·87 × 10−11) in 468 disease-free 
cerebellum samples from postmortem individuals from the Harvard Brain Bank Resource 
Center.26 Individuals with the alternative allele C had increased SNCA expression in the 
cerebellum, on average, compared with individuals with the reference allele G. Details on 
the subjects, experiments, and analytical methods of the expression quantitative trait loci 
study of the Harvard Brain Bank Resource Center samples are described by Zhang and 
colleagues26 and on the Harvard Brain Bank website. Boxplots for both panels show
