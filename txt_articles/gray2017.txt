IMPORTANCE Success on the internal medicine (IM) examination is a central requirement of
the American Board of Internal Medicine’
s (ABIM’
s) Maintenance of Certification program
(MOC). Therefore, it is important to understand the degree to which this examination reflects
conditions seen in practice, one dimension of content validity, which focuses on the match
between content in the discipline and the topics on the examination questions.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether the frequency of questions on IM-MOC examinations were
concordant with the frequency of conditions seen in practice.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The 2010-2013 IM-MOC examinations were used to
calculate the percentage of questions for 186 medical condition categories from the
examination blueprint, which balances examination content by considering importance and
frequency of conditions seen in practice. Nationally representative estimates of conditions
seen in practice by general internists were estimated from the primary diagnosis for 13 832
office visits (2010-2013 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys) and 108 472 hospital
stays (2010 National Hospital Discharge Survey).
EXPOSURES Prevalence of conditions included on the IM-MOC examination questions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome measure was the concordance between the
percentages of IM-MOC examination questions and the percentages of conditions seen
in practice during either office visits or hospital stays for each of 186 condition categories
(eg, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, liver disease). The concordance thresholds
were 0.5 SD of the weighted mean percentages of the applicable 186 conditions seen in
practice (0.74% for office visits; 0.51% for hospital stays). If the absolute differences between
the percentages of examination questions and the percentages of office visit conditions or
hospital stay conditions seen were less than the applicable concordance threshold, then the
condition category was judged to be concordant.
RESULTS During the 2010-2013 IM-MOC examination periods, 3600 questions (180
questions per examination form) were administered and 3461 questions (96.1%) were
mapped into the 186 study conditions (mean, 18.6 questions per condition). Comparison of
the percentages of 186 categories of medical conditions seen in 13 832 office visits and
108 472 hospital stays with the percentages of 3461 questions on IM-MOC examinations
revealed that 2389 examination questions (69.0%; 95% CI, 67.5%-70.6% involving 158
conditions) were categorized as concordant. For concordance between questions and office
visits only, 2010 questions (58.08%; 95% CI, 56.43%-59.72% of all examination questions)
involving 145 conditions were categorized as concordant. For concordance between
questions and hospital stays only, 1456 questions (42.07%; 95% CI, 40.42%-43.71% of all
examination questions) involving 122 conditions were categorized as concordant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among questions on IM-MOC examinations from 2010-2013,
69% were concordant with conditions seen in general internal medicine practices, although
some areas of discordance were identified.

 T
he purpose of the American Board of Internal Medi-
cine’
s (ABIM) Internal Medicine Maintenance of
Certification examination (IM-MOC) is to assess the
knowledge, diagnostic reasoning, and clinical judgment ex-
pectedofageneralinternistwhodeliverscareinofficeandhos-
pital settings. Although there are many forms of quality and
performance feedback, examinations such as the ABIM
IM-MOC examination attempt to address an important gap in
these measures by assessing an individual physician’
s com-
petence in medical knowledge and clinical judgment. Qual-
ity measures based on patient data cover only a portion of the
conditionsseenbyphysiciansandgenerallydonotaddressrare
but serious conditions or adequately consider quality issues
around diagnostic reasoning. Therefore, patient data may be
insufficient to determine whether a physician can diagnose
conditions that cover the breadth of the field or whether a phy-
sician can make the right judgment about appropriate care.1
Recent critiques of the ABIM IM-MOC examination sug-
gest that physician practices have evolved over time and that
the questions that comprise the IM-MOC examination do not
reflect these changes in terms of their relationship to the
medical conditions encountered by practicing general
internists.2 Thus, considering that 91% of general internists
are certified by the ABIM, measuring the degree to which
examination content aligns with clinical practice is both a key
element of the validity of the examination results and an
important policy question.3
Examination validity criteria include content validity,
which addresses the match between content in the discipline
and the examination question topic; construct validity,
which focuses on the theoretical construct being tested;
and predictive and consequential validity, which refers to how
well examination performance predicts physician quality.4,5
The objective of this study was to measure the content valid-
ity of the IM-MOC examination by assessing the concordance
between the frequency of questions related to specific condi-
tions on the 2010-2013 IM-MOC examinations and the fre-
quency with which these conditions were seen in general in-
ternal medicine practice.
Methods
Frequency of Conditions Seen in Practice
Chart abstraction data from the National Ambulatory Medi-
cal Care Survey (NAMCS), conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS), were used to construct national
estimates of the frequencies of conditions seen during gen-
eral internist office visits from 2010 to 2013. Estimates were
drawn from 2-week samples of visits to office-based nonsub-
specializing internists, referred to as general internists.6 Visit
conditions seen were recorded by the NAMCS participating
physician as primary diagnosis International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes abstracted from medi-
cal charts. NAMCS visit-level population weights were used to
estimatethepopulation-weightedfrequencyofconditionsseen
by office-based general internists nationally. A description of
the NAMCS methods is available from the NCHS.7-10
Hospital stay discharge note abstraction data from the
National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), conducted by
the NCHS, were used to construct national estimates of the
frequencies of conditions during hospital stays in 2010 (the
most recent year available). Estimates were drawn from a
sample of hospital stays excluding discharges following
births and for patients younger than 18 years. Hospital stay
conditions seen were based on primary diagnosis ICD-9
codes based on the discharge notes. National Hospital Dis-
charge Survey hospital discharge population weights were
used to estimate the population-weighted frequency of hos-
pital stay conditions seen for patients aged 18 years or older
who were not admitted to the hospital for a delivery. Hospital
stays for younger patients and for deliveries were excluded
because they occur in hospital setting in which general inter-
nists are unlikely to be attending. A description of the NHDS
methods is available from the NCHS.11
Thissampleofhospitalstayswaschosenbecausetherewas
no record of specialty types for treating physicians in the NHDS
data set, and it was more likely that internists providing care
in the inpatient hospital setting would care for this sample of
patients at some point during their stay. For example, if a pa-
tient was admitted for an amputation because of a diabetes
complication, a general internist may in part be responsible for
caring for that patient as an attending physician, even though
the internist did not perform the surgery.
Examination Question Condition Frequency
Questions from the 2010-2013 IM-MOC examinations were
used as the source of question condition frequency. The re-
lated conditions for each question were based on categoriza-
tion of the question by the test-writing committee in the ex-
amination blueprint. Examination blueprints are specification
tables describing an examination’
s scope of content, clinical
tasks (eg, diagnosis, treatment), and functional requirements
(eg, item and examination statistics). The purpose of the blue-
print is to drive examination construction and to provide test
takers insights into examination content.12 Because there were
no “field” questions on the IM-MOC examination, all ques-
tions were categorized.
The blueprint structure is a hierarchical content frame-
work designed to ensure that the questions selected for an ex-
amination represent the appropriate scope and frequency of

 conditions and clinical tasks for a particular discipline. Within
the IM-MOC blueprint, each question is assigned a primary
medical content category (level 1; eg, endocrinology, cardio-
vascular disease) and a specific topic area or medical condi-
tion within the primary category (level 2; eg, diabetes, hyper-
tension). The IM-MOC blueprint level 2 covers 187 unique
conditions. These conditions excluded topic areas that are in-
cluded in the blueprint, such as ethics, epidemiology, or pre-
vention and screening, which do not refer directly to specific
medical conditions.
Examination question frequency was linked to level 2 con-
ditions seen in office visits and hospital stays through ICD-9
codes that reflect condition category descriptions (see eTable
1 in the Supplement for condition ICD-9 codes). Two condi-
tions, small intestinal disease and colonic and anorectal dis-
ease, could not be distinguished using ICD-9 codes and were
combined, resulting in 186 distinct condition categories. Ex-
amination condition categories were assigned ICD-9 codes
usinganiterativeprocessthatinvolvedreviewingthefullICD-9
codesetandassigningcodesthatwereconsistentwiththeblue-
print level 2 condition descriptors.
For each of 186 condition categories, the population-
weighted percentages of office visit conditions seen were cal-
culated by dividing the population-weighted frequency of
office visit conditions seen in a condition category by the total
population-weighted frequency of office visits across all 186
condition categories. Hospital stay conditions seen were cal-
culated in the same way. For each of the 186 condition catego-
ries, the percentages of examination questions were calcu-
lated by dividing the number of questions in a condition
category by the total number of questions across all 186 con-
dition categories.
The NAMCS and NHDS protocols have been approved
by the NCHS Research Ethics Review Board, and these data
are publicly available. The ABIM provided approval for use
of examination question blueprint category data applied in
the analysis.
Concordance Criteria
The study objective was to measure one dimension of con-
tent validity by evaluating whether the question percentage
for each of the 186 condition categories was different than the
corresponding percentage of conditions seen. To accomplish
this, 2 differences were calculated for each condition cat-
egory as the basis for concordance categorizations: (1) the dif-
ference between the percentage of questions for a condition
category and the percentage of office visit conditions seen and
(2) the difference between the percentage of questions for a
condition category and the percentage of hospital stay condi-
tions seen.
Forofficevisits,theconcordancedifferencethresholdused
to evaluate these differences was 0.5 SD of the weighted mean
percentages (ie, population-weighted percentages) across the
186 office visit conditions seen. The same method was used
to calculate the concordance threshold for hospital stays. The
thresholds were based on the conditions seen because the goal
of the analysis was to evaluate whether the examination em-
phasis (reflected in the frequency of questions by condition)
was noticeably different than the frequency of conditions phy-
sicians see in practice. The 0.5-SD criterion was selected be-
cause it corresponds with the medium effect size proposed by
Cohen as being large enough to be perceivable.13,14 Further-
more,theliteraturereviewbyNormanetal15reportsthatacross
numerous health-related studies, 0.5 SD was a common cri-
terion for detectable differences and suggests that this stems
from the natural ability of individuals to judge differences.
A condition category was judged to be concordant if the
difference between examination question percentage and
either the percentage of office visit conditions seen or the per-
centage of hospital stay conditions seen was less than the ap-
plicable concordance threshold in absolute terms. If this stan-
dard was not met, the condition category was judged to be
discordant. Overall examination concordance was calculated
by summing the applicable question percentages for concor-
dantcategories.Inaddition,examinationconcordancewasalso
calculated separately for office visit conditions seen and hos-
pital stay conditions seen by comparing the applicable abso-
lute difference between percentages of conditions seen with
the applicable threshold.
Sensitivity Analyses
Five separate concordance sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted (eAppendix in the Supplement). The first 2 sensitivi-
ties considered the upper and lower 95% confidence bounds
of the 0.5-SD thresholds. The third sensitivity considered that
some physicians see patients only in the office setting by ap-
plying a discordance criterion that weighted office visits more
than hospital stays. The fourth sensitivity addressed includ-
ing only 2010 hospital data. The fifth sensitivity considered
excluding stays involving surgical procedures when calculat-
ing hospital stay frequencies.
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute Inc). Tests were 2-sided and P<.05 denoted sta-
tistical significance.
Results
Study Sample
The applicable 2010-2013 NAMCS sample included 13 842
office visits to 621 office-based general internists for which
the conditions seen were mapped into the 186 blueprint con-
dition categories. Weighted to population level, these data
represent 85.9% of office visits to 87.3% of office-based gen-
eral internists. Of the 14.1% of visits for which the primary
diagnosis could not be mapped to level 2 blueprint condition
categories, 6.7% were well visits or routine follow-up visits
and 7.4% had an ICD-9 primary diagnosis that was not spe-
cific enough or was outside of the examination blueprint
(eg, unspecified fatigue).
The 2010 NHDS hospital sample included 108 472 hospi-
talstaysthatweremappedintothe186blueprintconditioncat-
egories.Weightedtothepopulationlevel,thisrepresents83.1%
of all applicable hospital stays. The 16.9% of applicable hos-
pitalstaysthatcouldnotbemappedrepresentICD-9codesout-
side the blueprint or were not specific enough.

 During the 2010-2013 IM-MOC examination periods, 3600
questions (180 questions per examination form) were admin-
istered. Of these, 3461 questions (96.1%) were mapped into the
186 study conditions (mean, 18.6 questions per condition). Of
the 139 unmapped questions (3.9%), most involved epidemi-
ology (48 questions [34.5%]) and ethics (44 questions [31.6%]).
Concordant Percentages of Questions and Conditions Seen
The 0.5-SD concordance thresholds for the percentages of the
186 conditions seen (condition population-weighted mean
percentage as described in the Methods section) was 0.74%
for percentages of office visit conditions seen and 0.51% for
percentages of hospital stay conditions seen. Applying these
thresholds to the 3461 examination questions, 2389 ques-
tions (69.0%; 95% CI, 67.5%-70.6%) were categorized as con-
cordant (ie, 158 of 186 condition categories were such that
the difference between the percentage of questions and
either the percentage of office visit conditions seen or the
percentage of hospital stay conditions seen was less than the
corresponding threshold) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). For
example, thyroid disorders was classified as concordant
because the absolute difference of −0.09% (95% CI of differ-
ence CI, −0.56% to 0.37%) between this condition’
s question
percentage of 1.30% (95% CI of difference CI, 0.92%-1.68%)
and office visits percentage of 1.39% (95% CI, 1.15%-1.69%)
was less than the concordance threshold in absolute terms
for office visits of 0.74%. For this condition, the difference
between the question percentage and hospital stay percent-
age of 1.02% (95% CI, 0.64%-1.40%) was greater than the
hospital stays concordance threshold of 0.51%. However, the
overall concordance criterion that the absolute difference
between the question percentage and the percentage of
either office visit or hospital stay conditions seen was less
than the corresponding threshold was met.
For concordance between questions and office visits
only, 2010 questions (58.08%; 95% CI, 56.43%-59.72% of all
examination questions) involving 145 conditions were cat-
egorized as concordant. For concordance between questions
and hospital stays only, 1456 questions (42.07% of all exami-
nation questions; 95% CI, 40.42%-43.71%) involving 122 con-
ditions were categorized as concordant (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Discordant Percentages of Questions and Conditions Seen
A total of 1072 questions (30.97%; 95% CI, 29.43%-32.51% of
all examination questions) involving 28 condition categories
were categorized as discordant (the Table lists the percent-
ages of questions, office visits, and hospital stays and differ-
ences for each of these conditions). Depending on the nature
of the discordance, concordance could be reached for these
condition categories by having either greater or fewer exami-
nation questions related to this condition.
For 708 of the discordant questions (20.5% of all exami-
nation questions; 95% CI, 19.1%-21.8%) involving 17 condi-
tions, the question percentage was greater than the percent-
ages of both the office visit and hospital stay conditions seen
(ie, concordance could be reached by reducing the number of
questions). The most prevalent of these conditions in terms
of number of questions was liver disease, with 72 questions.
For this condition, the question percentage of 2.08% (95% CI,
1.60%2.56%) was greater than the office visit percentage of
0.28% (95% CI, 0.16%-0.47%) by 1.81% (95% CI, 1.31%-
2.30%), which exceeded the concordance threshold for office
visit conditions seen of 0.74%. For this condition, the ques-
tion percentage was also greater than the hospital stay per-
centage of 0.64% (95% CI, 0.57%-0.72%) by 1.44% (95% CI,
0.96-1.92%), which was more than the concordance thresh-
old for hospital stay conditions seen of 0.51%.
For 161 of the discordant questions (4.65% of all examina-
tion questions; 95% CI, 3.95%-5.31%) involving 6 conditions,
the question percentage was less than the percentages for
both office visits (18.57%; 95% CI, 17.32%-19.88%) and hospi-
tal stays (15.98%; 95% CI, 15.63%-16.34%) (ie, concordance
could be reached by increasing the number of questions). The
most prevalent of these conditions in terms of number of
questions was lower respiratory tract infections, with 66
questions, for which the question percentage of 1.91% (95%
CI, 1.45%-2.36%) was less than the office visit percentage of
2.97% (95% CI, 2.41%-3.65%) as well as the hospital stay per-
centage of 3.94% (95% CI, 3.75%-4.12%).
For 203 of the discordant questions (5.87% of all exami-
nations questions; 95% CI, 5.08%-6.65%) involving 5 condi-
tions, the question percentage was between the office visit and
hospital stay percentages (ie, concordance could be reached
by either lowering or increasing the number of questions). The
most prevalent of these conditions in terms of number of ques-
tions was dysrhythmias conduction defects, with 71 ques-
tions, for which the question percentage of 2.05% (95% CI,
1.58%-2.52%) was between the office visit percentage of 1.14%
(95% CI, 0.88%-1.47%) and the hospital stay percentage of
3.05% (95% CI, 2.89%-2.22%).
The Figure shows the percentages of office visit condi-
tions seen, hospital stay conditions, and question percent-
agesforeachconditioncategory,orderedfromlowtohigh,and
their concordance designations. The Figure shows that office
visits and, to a lesser extent, hospital stays were more con-
centrated on the right side of the distribution than were ex-
amination questions, which were more equally distributed
(ie, the distribution of conditions seen was more skewed than
the distribution of examination questions).
The results of sensitivity analyses are shown in eTable 4
in the Supplement. These sensitivity results ranged from an
increase in the percentage of questions in the discordant cat-
egoryof3.0percentagepoints(95%CI,0.9%-5.2%),from31.0%
to 3.4%, when the care setting was considered to a decrease
of 5.7 percentage points (95% CI, 3.6%-7.8%), from 31.0% to
25.3%, in the discordant category when the upper 95% confi-
dence bound of the 0.5 SD of the conditions-seen percentage
was applied as a concordance threshold.

 IM-MOC examinations from 2010 to 2013, 69.0% of examina-
tion questions were concordant with conditions seen. This
finding indicates that the IM-MOC examination has generally
been consistent with the conditions seen in practice. How-
ever, with 31.0% of examination questions categorized as dis-
cordant, the study also identified potential opportunities
for improvement.
The approach taken in establishing the concordance
thresholds and applying these thresholds to 2 care settings
should be considered in evaluating these results. The thresh-
old for concordance was selected based on recommenda-
tions from the literature in terms of ability to perceive differ-
ences and for this study was selected as 0.5 SD of the weighted
mean percentages of the corresponding 186 conditions seen.
Yet, it is reasonable to consider other approaches for deriving
a concordance threshold, perhaps based on a physician sur-
vey. As such, sensitivity analyses considered more and less
stringent concordance thresholds and demonstrated that the
main results were robust to several definitions and thresh-
olds for concordance.
With respect to analyzing concordance across 2 settings,
the criteria applied to construct concordance categorizes as-
sumed that questions, absent a code for care setting, were ap-
plicabletoeitheroutpatientorinpatientsettings.Althoughthis
assumption seemed reasonable overall, its application led to
some counterintuitive concordance categorizations. For ex-
ample, the question percentage for hypertension was judged
to be concordant because it was similar to the hospital stay per-
centage (1.91% vs 1.84%), even though the question percent-
age was much lower than the office visit percentage for this
condition (1.91% vs 13.87%). A care setting sensitivity analy-
sis considered that this condition was highly discordant with
office visit conditions seen yet was concordant with hospital
stay conditions seen. Additionally, the data used to construct
measures of concordance have been included in the eAppen-
dix in the Supplement to enable evaluation of other mea-
sures of concordance.
A study finding related to the 2 settings was that IM-MOC
examinationshavebeenmoreconcordantwithconditionsseen
in office settings than in hospital settings. This may reflect that
theexaminationisforgeneralinternistswhopracticeinanout-
patient setting or both outpatient and inpatient settings. The
ABIM offers a separate hospital medicine examination for gen-
eral internists who practice only in inpatient settings.
This study had several limitations. First, errors in diagno-
sis reflected in the medical record could have led to measure-
ment error regarding conditions seen. This may be particu-
larly problematic for less common conditions for which
diagnosticexperiencecouldbelacking.Second,theNHDSdoes
not link hospital stays to specific physician specialties. Be-
cause of this, the analysis assumed that general internists were
involved at least in part in caring for all patients with hospital
stays, with the exception of hospital stays for delivery and care
forpatientyoungerthan18years.Third,theNHDScoveredonly
one-quarter of the study period (2010), but those data were
the most current data available at the time of the study. An
analysis (eTable 4 in the Supplement) evaluating NHDS data
from 2007-2010 suggests that using data from 2010 did not
materially affect the study results as the distribution of hos-
pital stay diagnoses appeared fairly stable in the years lead-
ing up to the 2010-2013 study period. Fourth, some of the con-
cordant condition categories were fairly common in terms of
conditions seen (eg, diabetes) but might have questions re-
lated to specific issues that are rarely seen (eg, an uncommon
complication of diabetes).
Fifth, the study does not reflect changes to the blueprint
that occurred in 2015. The analysis applied in this study
could not yet be replicated with new data or the enhanced
examination blueprint because more recent data on office
visit conditions seen and hospital stay conditions seen are
not currently available and not enough examinations have
been administered with the new blueprint to accurately rep-
resent the question distribution (7.9 questions per category
of condition seen for the 2015-2016 examinations vs 18.6
questions per category of condition seen for the 2010-2013
examinations applied in the study). Although not conclusive,
a preliminary evaluation found a correlation of 0.76 between
the percentages of condition questions used in this study
with these percentages for the limited data available from the
2015-2016 examinations (Jonathan Vandergrift, written com-
munication, unpublished data based on ABIM administrative
data, April 11, 2017). This would suggest that the analysis pre-
sented in this study is still relevant even though some
changes to the question distribution across the conditions
have occurred since the blueprint enhancements were imple-
mented. The major change that occurred in 2015 was the
elimination of 12 miscellaneous/other categories, 2 of which
had no questions (other ophthalmologic disorders and mis-
cellaneous gynecology and women’
s health). In total, these
conditions accounted for only 86 of the 3461 questions from
the 2010-2013 IM-MOC examinations included in this study.
Future research can both update the analysis and findings in
this study and measure the effect of changes in the blueprint
implemented after the 2015 blueprint review.
When considering the findings of the study, it is impor-
tant to recognize that in addition to frequency of conditions
seen in practice, another key dimension of content validity
is the degree to which the knowledge being tested by exami-
nation questions was important in terms of its potential
influence on patient care and outcomes. Because of this,
in addition to the results of this study, the 2015 blueprint
review also considered physician feedback regarding the
importance of examination questions to practice. These
data were drawn separately from a questionnaire completed
by 322 practicing general internists (response rate of 13%)
who rated the importance of different clinical tasks associ-
ated with subcategories of the conditions used in this study
(ie, questions related to diagnosis, testing, treatment/care
decisions, risk assessment/prognosis/epidemiology, and
pathophysiology/basic science).16 Results of this question-
naire indicated that 12 (15.1% of questions) of the 17 condi-
tions (20.5% of questions) representing 74.0% of questions
found to be discordant due to too many questions had at
least 1 clinical task rated as highly important. For example,
pericardial disease was categorized as discordant because
of a greater percentage of questions than the percentages of

 both office visit and hospital stay conditions seen. Yet knowl-
edge about diagnosis of and testing for pericarditis and peri-
cardial effusion (as well as treatment of pericardial effusion)
were rated as highly important by surveyed internists.
Another issue that was beyond the scope of this study
but considered by examination committees is the benefit of
adding more questions pertaining to relatively common con-
ditions. For example, upper respiratory tract infection condi-
tions, found to have indeterminate concordance, had a
greater office visit percentage than question percentage. This
may be because care guidelines are widely disseminated and
more questions in these areas may be repetitive in terms of
content and therefore do not contribute significantly to the
assessment of a physician’
s clinical judgment especially
when limited testing time is available. Another example of
this is hypertension, which represented 13.9% of office visit
conditions seen but only 1.91% of questions. This may
explain why conditions seen were concentrated in fewer con-
ditions than were examination questions. In addition, it was
beyond the scope of this study to evaluate other forms of
validity such as the degree to which examination perfor-
mance predicts outcomes that are important to patients, hos-
pital administrators, and insurers.
The ABIM is using data in an effort to ensure that future
examinations better reflect the conditions seen by practicing
internists. The concordance data included in this analysis were
consideredbytheexaminationcommitteeduringreviewofthe
2015 IM-MOC examination blueprint, although the specific cri-
teria (eg, the concordance threshold) used in this study were
not. Furthermore, for subcategories of these conditions
(eg, diagnosis of diabetes), the IM-MOC examination commit-
tee referenced the physician blueprint review survey de-
scribed above to further adjust the examination content based
on the importance and frequency of each condition reported
by the physicians. Future research is needed to track whether
changesintheIM-MOCexaminationthatwereinformedbythis
and other analyses resulted in discernible improvement in the
relevance of the IM-MOC examination content.
Conclusions
Among questions on IM-MOC examinations from 2010-2013,
69% were concordant with conditions seen in general inter-
nal medicine practice, although some areas of discordance
were identified.
