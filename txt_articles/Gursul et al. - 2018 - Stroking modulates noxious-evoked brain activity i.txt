A subclass of C fi
 bre sensory neurons 
found in hairy skin are activated by 
gentle touch [1] and respond optimally 
to stroking at ~1–10 cm/s, serving 
a protective function by promoting 
affi
 liative behaviours. In adult humans, 
stimulation of these C-tactile (CT) 
afferents is pleasant, and can reduce 
pain perception [2]. Touch-based 
techniques, such as infant massage 
and kangaroo care, are designed to 
comfort infants during procedures, 
and a modest reduction in pain-related 
behavioural and physiological responses 
has been observed in some studies [3]. 
Here, we investigated whether touch 
can reduce noxious-evoked brain 
activity. We demonstrate that stroking 
(at 3 cm/s) prior to an experimental 
noxious stimulus or clinical heel lance 
can attenuate noxious-evoked brain 
activity in infants. CT fi
 bres may 
represent a biological target for non-
pharmacological interventions that 
modulate pain in early life. 
Noxious-evoked brain activity in 
infants is similar to that observed when 
adults experience pain [4], providing 
an objective method of assessing 
pain-relieving interventions [5]. We 
hypothesised that touch which optimally 
activates CT fi
 bres in adults would 
reduce noxious-evoked brain activity 
measured using electroencephalography 
(EEG). In 30 term infants, we applied CT-
optimal touch (brush velocity 3 cm/s), 
CT non-optimal touch (brush velocity 
30 cm/s), and a no-touch control in 
5-second blocks before each acute 
experimental noxious stimulus (128 mN 
PinPrickTM Stimulation, MRC Systems) in 
a train of nine stimuli (Study 1). We then 
tested whether CT-optimal stimulation 
reduced noxious-evoked responses 
in a clinical context in an independent 
sample of infants (Study 2).
In Study 1, CT-optimal touch 
signifi
 cantly reduced noxious-evoked 
brain activity following the fi
 rst acute 
experimental noxious stimulus 
(p = 0.029, linear mixed effects analysis; 
Figure 1A). In contrast, CT non-optimal 
touch did not signifi
 cantly reduce 
noxious-evoked brain activity (p = 0.57, 
linear mixed effects analysis; Figure 
1A), demonstrating the specifi
 city of the 
response to lower velocity stroking. In 
the CT-optimal condition, the attenuation 
of noxious-evoked brain activity was not 
maintained across repeated stimuli (p 
= 0.62, all CT-optimal trials compared 
with control, linear mixed effects 
analysis). The magnitude of noxious-
evoked brain activity following the fi
 rst 
noxious stimulus in the CT-optimal 
condition was signifi
 cantly lower than 
the magnitude of the noxious-evoked 
brain activity in subsequent trials 
(p = 0.019; Figures S1A and S2A in 
Supplemental Information, published 
with this article online), consistent with 
CT fi
 bre fatigue [6]. There was, however, 
no suggestion that CT-optimal (p = 0.20, 
Wilcoxon signed rank test, fi
 rst trial 
compared with fi
 rst trial of control) or 
non-optimal (p = 0.40) tactile stimulation 
altered limb refl
 ex withdrawal activity 
(Figures 1B and S1A). The magnitude 
of the noxious-evoked brain activity 
following the fi
 rst CT-optimal brush 
stimulation was approximately 60% 
less than the magnitude of the activity 
evoked in the no-brush condition. This 
is a similar effect size to that reported 
in a previous study of topical local 
anaesthetic [5]. However, the effect 
of topical anaesthethic in this study is 
likely to have been conservative due to 
the limited time allowed for absorption 
(30 minutes) prior to application of the 
noxious stimuli.
To test whether CT-optimal tactile 
stimulation is clinically effective we 
applied it for 10 s prior to clinical 
heel lancing for blood collection in an 
independent sample of 32 infants; 16 
infants received CT-optimal stimulation 
and 16 were aged-matched controls 
(Study 2). CT-optimal stimulation 
signifi
 cantly reduced the magnitude of 
noxious-evoked brain activity compared 
with age-matched controls who were 
not touched prior to lancing (p = 0.045, 
two-sided t-test; Figure 1C). A 40% 
Correspondence
reduction in the magnitude of noxious-
evoked brain activity following the heel 
lance was observed when the brush 
stimulation was applied. Interestingly, 
one infant required two heel lances 
(~4 minutes apart) and CT-optimal touch 
was performed before each lance. The 
magnitude of noxious-evoked brain 
activity was similar, suggesting that CT-
optimal touch stimulation was equally 
infl
 uential for each procedure (Figure 
S2B). This is in contrast to our results 
from Study 1, where the experimental 
noxious stimuli were applied in relatively 
quick succession and CT-fi
 bre fatigue 
is likely to have contributed to the 
observed lack of effi
 cacy of the brush 
intervention. These fi
 ndings suggest 
that the timing of the touch intervention 
relative to the noxious stimulation 
needs to be carefully considered if 
this technique is to be developed for 
therapeutic use, and further work is 
required to establish the optimal timing.
Consistent with Study 1, the 
magnitude of the refl
 ex withdrawal 
was not signifi
 cantly different between 
groups (p = 1, Mann-Whitney U-test; 
Figure S1B). While noxious-evoked 
refl
 exes and brain activity are correlated 
in term infants [7], these data suggest 
that CT-optimal tactile stimulation may 
disrupt this relationship. Albeit, the study 
was not powered to see a signifi
 cant 
reduction in refl
 ex withdrawal activity. 
Recently, we have shown that resting 
state functional connectivity between 
brain areas involved in endogenous pain 
modulation infl
 uences the magnitude 
of noxious-evoked brain activity [4]. 
It is possible that CT-optimal tactile 
stimulation may infl
 uence noxious-
evoked brain activity by engaging this 
maturing pain modulatory system. 
Inhibition of spinal refl
 exes is, however, 
not observed, indicating that, consistent 
with rodent studies, communication 
of descending inhibitory infl
 uences via 
spinal projections may be immature [8]. 
Concomitant maturation of brain activity 
and refl
 ex withdrawal activity occurs 
during preterm development [9], and by 
term descending modulatory centres 
may begin to exert inhibitory infl
 uences. 
However, evidence here suggests that 
this system is not fully mature, or at 
least not engaged by CT-optimal tactile 
stimulation.
We also examined infants’ behavioural 
responses in Study 2 by recording 
the duration of pain-related facial

expressions (see Supplemental 
Information). A similar proportion of 
infants exhibited facial grimacing 
following heel lancing in both groups 
(12/16 infants in the CT-optimal touch 
group; 9/14 in the control group). 
However, the duration was almost 50% 
shorter in infants who received CT-
optimal stimulation (median duration 
(lower quartile, upper quartile) = 7 s 
(4, 13) than in the control group = 13 
s (9, 14); Figure S1C; p = 0.30, Mann-
Whitney U-test). The study was not 
powered to investigate this behavioural 
effect, and further investigation is 
warranted. This fi
 nding is consistent 
with some observations that tactile 
stimulation, such as infant massage, 
can reduce behavioural pain scores [3]. 
It is plausible that CT fi
 bre stimulation 
may represent a neurophysiological 
mechanism underlying the effi
 cacy of 
these interventions.
Microneurography has facilitated 
identifi
 cation of CT fi
 bres in adults, but 
the safe use of this invasive technique 
has not been established in infants 
[1]. Our results nevertheless suggest 
that tactile stimulation, at a velocity 
that activates CT fi
 bres in adults, can 
modulate noxious-evoked brain activity 
in infants. Social touch is important 
for parent–infant bonding and parents 
instinctively stroke infants at a CT-
optimal velocity [10]. Further research 
is needed to ascertain whether this 
simple tactile intervention is effective 
in modulating pain in the context of 
other clinical procedures and in preterm 
infants. Better understanding of the 
role of CT fi
 bres in early life may lead to 
the development of neurobiologically 
driven interventions to optimise pain 
management in neonatal care.
