Objectives: A programme was introduced in Canterbury, New Zealand to evaluate the diagnosis and treatment of
frenulum releases in newborn infants with suspected tongue-tie (ankyloglossia). The primary goals were to
support breastfeeding and ensure that unnecessary surgery was avoided.
Methods: Local healthcare professionals reached consensus on a pathway for improving management of infants
with tongue-tie and breast-feeding difficulties. This embedded an expert breast-feeding review and assessment of
lingual function using a validated method, the Bristol Tongue-tie Assessment Tool (BTAT). Infants with
breastfeeding problems related to tongue-tie had a frenotomy at a hospital outpatient clinic. An education
programme was developed to support introduction of the new clinical pathway and included seminars and
online information for healthcare professionals and the general public.
Results: Frenotomy intervention rate reduced markedly from 11.3% in 2015 to 3.5% by mid-2017. Feeding
methods were not different before or after surgery between infants who received a frenotomy and those who did
not. Initially, the BTAT threshold for frenotomy was set at ≤5, however the final clinical pathway combined a
breastfeeding assessment and a BTAT threshold of ≤4. The education programs assisted with the changes in
practice, while increased use of the clinician guidance and public health information websites confirmed
growing awareness of tongue-tie and community breastfeeding support.
Conclusions: Establishing consistent multidisciplinary assessment of tongue-tie in infants with feeding difficulties
led to a marked reduction in frenotomy intervention rate. 23% of the frenotomy group in the 2016 audit showed
a significant improvement in the ability to breastfeed, but overall there was no difference in the feeding pattern
of infants who either received or were declined a frenotomy. The development of a supportive education pro-
gramme and availability of online information about tongue-tie for health professionals and consumers con-
tributed to successful uptake of the new clinical pathway.
1. Introduction
Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is a common condition occurring in
1–11% of newborn infants that may result in painful and early cessation
of breastfeeding [1–3]. The presence of tongue-tie does not auto-
matically result in breastfeeding problems and it is estimated that
40–75% of babies with tongue-tie will be able to breastfeed successfully
[4]. In addition, breastfeeding improvement is not universal in infants
with tongue-tie following surgical release of the frenulum (frenotomy
or
frenectomy)
[5].
Interventions
to
alleviate
tongue-tie-related
breastfeeding difficulties may include monitoring, lactation support
and surgical release of the frenulum. Guidelines cautiously support
frenotomies for babies diagnosed with tongue-tie related feeding diffi-
culties but acknowledge that evidence of efficacy is weak due to the
subjective nature of the measurable outcomes [3,6,7]. A 2017 Cochrane
review [3] advised that surgical release of the tongue-tie does not
consistently improve sustained infant feeding but is likely to improve
maternal nipple pain. Clinical guidance and systematic reviews em-
phasise the importance of carefully selecting the infants who may
benefit from a frenotomy, with the use of consistent criteria to diagnose
symptomatic tongue-tie and assessment of function with a breast-
feeding assessment being encouraged [1,4,7–11].
Despite the uncertainties regarding diagnosis and treatment in-
dications for tongue-ties, the demand for frenotomies has increased in

T
 many Western countries in recent years [12–14]. As shown in Fig. 1 this
trend became markedly apparent in the Canterbury province in New
Zealand with frenotomy intervention in infants increasing from a re-
latively high rate of 7.5% in 2013 to a peak of 11.3% in 2015 (un-
published data of Christchurch Women's Hospital). Despite this high
and rising rate of newborn frenotomies, in Canterbury the breastfeeding
rates at discharge from the midwife at 4–6 weeks have remained un-
changed from 2013 at approximately 72%, marginally lower than the
national rate in New Zealand of approximately 74% [15].
In mid-2015, a multifaceted programme was initiated to improve
the care offered to mothers and babies with breastfeeding difficulties.
There was concern that over emphasis on tongue-tie may delay access
to the most appropriate breastfeeding support and that unnecessary
frenotomy surgery may have been provided. A working group was
convened to understand the reasons for the rising frenotomy rate, and
consisted of local hospital and community doctors, dentists, lactation
consultants, allied health care professionals, and senior hospital man-
agers. This group identified inconsistencies in anatomical description
and assessment of tongue function and the lingual frenulum. There
were uncertainties regarding the diagnostic parameters and referral
criteria for frenotomy. It was apparent in some cases that frenotomy
was seen as a quick surgical solution for more complex breastfeeding
problems, and that availability of online information with a bias to-
wards surgical release was influencing parent expectations of the po-
tential value of the procedure [16].
A plan for a referral and assessment pathway that considered all
causes for breastfeeding difficulties and assessed the functional impact
of tongue-tie was needed. Internationally, the evaluation and manage-
ment of infants with tongue-tie-related breastfeeding difficulties has
generally shifted from assessment based solely on the anatomy of fre-
nulum attachment to a more functional focus on restricted tongue
movement caused by the lingual frenulum [2,8,17]. There are a variety
of tongue-tie assessment tools available but none are universally ac-
cepted or applied [4,5,8]. The Hazelbaker tool [18] is recommended by
the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine because it is comprehensive,
but it is also complicated and often too time consuming to use in a busy
clinic [5,8,19,20]. The Bristol Tongue-tie Assessment Tool (BTAT) [21]
was used in this programme as it is simpler, less time consuming, and
has good inter-person reliability. The BTAT uses four criteria to eval-
uate tongue-tie that include appearance of the tongue tip, location of
alveolar attachment, and tongue lift and protrusion. This generates a
score between 0 and 8 with a lower score indicating more severe
tongue-tie (Table 1). Research has shown a strong correlation between
the findings of the BTAT and Hazelbaker tools [21]. Table 1 also de-
scribes the Coryllos system used to classify the type of tongue-tie.
The new clinical pathway with a change in emphasis on assessment
and management of tongue-tie associated breast-feeding difficulties was
supported by inclusion on a local guidance website called Community
HealthPathways [22] and a comprehensive education programme for
health professionals. Online information about breastfeeding, tongue-
tie and access to community based lactation support was also made
available to the general public on a locally developed open-access
website called HealthInfo [23]. The details and the impact of these
initiatives are described below.
2. Methods
2.1. Design, setting, and participants
The central location for the programme was the Neonatal Service,
Christchurch
Women's
Hospital.
A
working
group
within
the
Canterbury District Health Board (DHB), coordinated by the Canterbury
Initiative (http://www.canterburyinitiative.org.nz/) worked with clin-
icians and community representatives to support introduction of the
new pathway. Ethical approval was not required for the study because
it was conducted as part of audit and improvement of usual patient care
by the Canterbury DHB. The time lines for programme development are
shown in Fig. 2.
2.2. Clinical pathway for assessment of frenulum anatomy and function
An objective assessment for measuring frenulum function and
anatomy using the BTAT score was introduced in January 2016. The
threshold score for frenotomy was set initially at ≤5. Surgical and
feeding outcomes were audited for the next 6 months for all babies
assessed at the clinic, regardless of whether or not they received a
frenotomy. The audit data was then shared with the working group to
inform further changes to the pathway.
In January 2017, a revised clinical pathway was developed that
embedded an expert breastfeeding assessment in the earliest stages. It is
generally acknowledged that frenotomy at age between 2 and 4 weeks
is best practice to support breastfeeding [24–6]. Timely assessment to
try to ensure early referral was therefore encouraged in the pathway as
follows: 1) Frenotomy within the first 48 h was restricted to infants
diagnosed with tongue-tie and severe feeding difficulties, following a
specialist medical review, 2) Infants aged between 48 h and 8 weeks
with breast-feeding difficulties needed an assessment by a lactation
consultant (or midwife with additional training) and a BTAT score ≤4
for frenotomy with a neonatologist, and 3) An otorhinolaryngology
surgeon would see infants older than 8 weeks following a breast-feeding

 assessment by a lactation consultant (or midwife with additional
training) and a BTAT score ≤4, or infants with an anatomical ab-
normality. Skilled breastfeeding follow-up after the frenotomy and
discharge back to the community were also prioritised in the revised
clinical pathway (Fig. 3).
2.3. Frenotomy
There are a variety of accepted frenotomy techniques. Newborn
frenotomies are usually provided with either scissors or laser and
without local or general anaesthetic [24,27,28]. All frenotomies at the
Christchurch Women's Hospital clinic were completed with sterile blunt
ended scissor incisions and sucrose or expressed breast milk used for
analgesia. No post-frenotomy bodywork or oral exercises were advised.
2.4. Clinical audit and review of the programme
Following introduction of the BTAT threshold of ≤5 in January
2016 a clinical audit was undertaken that included every infant who
had attended the clinic between January and June 2016. Every family
was telephoned after assessment at the clinic and between 2 and 6 at-
tempts were made to contact them. There was a median follow-up
period of 87 days with a range of 31–193 days. The mothers were asked
the following questions about ongoing feeding regardless of whether or
not a frenotomy was performed; 1) feeding method after the tongue-tie
clinic, 2) symptoms of feeding difficulties, and 3) the mother's sub-
jective perception about feeding following a frenotomy, if performed. In
this study, breastfeeding was defined as either exclusively or fully
breastfeeding.
A second clinical audit was undertaken in 2017 to assess the revised
clinical pathway with the lower BTAT score for frenotomy. This audit
used the same methods and outcome measures as the first audit and
included every infant who attended the hospital clinic between
February and April 2017.
2.5. Education programme on tongue-tie
The clinical forum recognised the importance of education about
the range of normal tongue anatomy, definitions, evaluation and
management of tongue-tie, and breastfeeding support. Canterbury DHB
hospital staff, general practice teams, midwives, and public health and
community nurses were invited to clinical education sessions. Clinical
information was also made available on Community HealthPathways
(CHP). This website was developed locally in 2008 to provide general

 practice teams and primary care providers with clinical guidance, re-
ferral criteria, and a directory of health care services and resources. The
website now includes 670 clinical pathways and is used on a regular
basis by nearly all general medical practitioners in Canterbury [29,30].
Information about tongue-tie, breastfeeding issues and the avail-
ability of community breastfeeding support was also shared with the
general public and made available in early 2017 on HealthInfo. This
website was developed after the 2012 Canterbury Earthquakes to

 provide the public with emergency information and the details of dis-
ruption in health service [31]. Since that time HealthInfo has added
numerous pages that reflect the information obtained in CHP and is
written in an easy-to-understand style, complemented by photographs
and graphics.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Comparison of grouped data was carried out using Fishers exact test
for small data sets and the chi square test for large data sets. The
Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the BTAT scores measured
by the referring health professional and on assessment at the clinic visit.
3. Results
As shown in Fig. 2, the programme resulted in a more consistent
approach to tongue-tie assessment and management, with a reduction
in the frenotomy intervention rate from 10.2% in 2014 and 11.3% in
2015 to 6.6% by the end of 2016 and 3.5% by the middle of 2017.
3.1. 2016 clinical audit
The findings of the audit in 309 infants during the first 6 months of
the programme (January–June 2016) are summarised in Table 2. Male
infants comprised 63% of referrals. With a BTAT threshold ≤5, 264
(85%) of the infants referred for assessment of tongue-tie received a
frenotomy. The infant-mother dyads who received a frenotomy had
similar breastfeeding difficulties at presentation to those declined a
frenotomy, with the exception of a significantly lower proportion
(p = 0.003) of infants classified as ‘constant feeding-poor milk transfer’.
The most common breastfeeding difficulties were failure to establish or
maintain a latch and nipple pain.
Follow-up data on perception of breastfeeding difficulties were
obtained for 164 of the 264 dyads who received a frenotomy (median
follow-up 84 days), and showed 139 (85%) had a subjective improve-
ment, 17 (10%) had no subjective improvement, while 8 (5%) were
unsure. In the 45 dyads who did not have a frenotomy, follow-up in 24
(median 125 days) showed that 2 accessed a frenotomy from a private
provider following the hospital decline, and the remaining 22 had ex-
perienced no major ongoing feeding problems or symptoms.
Analysis of the cross-sectional data showed there was no difference
in the pattern of feeding methods between the released and unreleased
groups
at
both
consultation
(p = 0.21)
and
follow-up
(p = 31).
Longitudinal follow-up data of feeding methods was available in only
177 dyads. A significant improvement in exclusively/fully breast-
feeding rate from 43% to 54% (p = 0.03) was observed in the 157 of
these dyads who received a frenotomy. This improvement was re-
stricted to 23% of dyads as 34% continued to exclusively or fully
breastfeed, while the remaining 42% either stopped or continued to not
breastfeed following the frenotomy. The exclusively/fully breastfeeding
rate in the 22 infants who did not receive a frenotomy did not change
significantly over the follow-up period (p = 0.73).
In order to examine whether or not there was a difference in feeding
outcomes following frenotomy with the lower threshold of BTAT a
comparison was carried out of data stratified according to BTAT ≤4.0.
Table 3 shows there was no difference between the two BTAT groups in
the pattern of feeding methods recorded at consultation and follow-up.
However, after the frenotomy the proportion of infants who were fully
breastfed increased markedly in the BTAT ≤4.0 group from 38% to
54% (p = 0.005), but only slightly in the BTAT > 4.0 group from 48%
to 53% (p = 0.67).
3.2. 2017 clinical audit
Table 4 summarises the findings of the audit in 58 infants. With a
lower BTAT threshold ≤4, nearly all (95%) of the infants referred for
consultation received a frenotomy, with only 3 being declined a release.
This small number of dyads not receiving a frenotomy made any sta-
tistical comparison between the two groups invalid. The distributions of
gender and breastfeeding difficulties were similar to those observed in
the 2016 audit, with the exception that a higher proportion of dyads
had constant feeding-poor milk transfer or failure to gain weight.
Follow-up data on feeding methods were obtained for 34 of the 55
dyads who received a frenotomy (median follow-up 118 days) and
showed a non-significant increase in breastfeeding rate from 49% % to
56% (p = 0.13), a subjective improvement in breastfeeding difficulties
in 85% of dyads, and a similar shift from mixed feeding to either ex-
clusively or fully breastfeeding or bottle-feeding to that observed in the

 2016 audit.
3.3. Clinical investigations and procedures
3.3.1. BTAT and classification of the tongue-ties
Analysis of the combined data of the two audits showed the BTAT
was easy-to-use and had good inter-user reproducibility, with no sig-
nificant difference in the scores measured by the referrers and by hos-
pital clinic staff at the consultation (p = 0.37; Wilcoxin signed-rank
test). The majority of tongue-ties in infants receiving a frenotomy were
Type 1 and 2, with the proportion of these types increasing from 79% in
2016 to 95% in 2017.
3.3.2. Frenotomies
The releases performed in the outpatient clinic using scissor freno-
tomies were well tolerated. No adverse outcomes were observed, al-
though 1 infant required repeat surgery, 1 had a minor bleed, and 1
required paracetomol for analgesia.
3.4. Education programme
Six education seminars about breastfeeding issues and tongue-tie
assessment have been organised since introduction of the programme
and were well attended by a wide range of healthcare professionals.
Access to webpages on Community HealthPathways for information on
management of tongue-tie showed an initial peak of activity in the first
month after introduction (mean 100 visits/week), followed by a sus-
tained number of visits (mean of 15 visits/week). Access to information
on HealthInfo showed a similar initial peak of 64 visits/week in the first
month, but only a small number of visits thereafter (mean 3 visits/
week).
4. Discussion
The overarching goal of this project was to support mothers and
babies with breastfeeding difficulties. While assessment and support for
breastfeeding is crucial both in hospital and in the community, clinical
resources are often spread thinly and it is important to ensure these
resources are used wisely. The rapidly rising frenotomy intervention
rate alongside a static breastfeeding rate were concerning and triggered
our review to reconsider the clinical pathway for frenotomy to support
infant feeding. Monitoring breastfeeding trends and critical reflection
on clinical practice aligned with international recommendations [32]
aimed to support women to breastfeed successfully. For example, the
‘Choosing Wisely’ campaign run by the Council of Medical Colleges
[33] aimed to help patients make good choices and focus on areas
where evidence that showed a test or procedure provided little or no
benefit and could even cause harm.
The new clinical pathway was introduced based on best available
evidence and multidisciplinary expert consensus. The pathway ensured
that all possible causes for breastfeeding difficulties were considered
early, and that tongue function and anatomy were assessed consistently
and objectively. Two retrospective audits showed that consistent ana-
tomical and functional assessment of tongue-tie using the BTAT com-
bined with early expert breastfeeding support led to a marked reduction
in the frenotomy intervention rate without negatively impacting on
breastfeeding. The feeding patterns and sustained breastfeeding out-
comes were similar for both treated and untreated infants.
Several factors were important for achieving these improvements in
management of the maternal infant dyad with breastfeeding difficulties.
Establishing clear clinical guidelines and referral criteria based on sci-
entific evidence were key to this success. The ability of health profes-
sionals and the general public to view these guidelines on locally de-
veloped websites also helped with introduction of the new management
guidelines. Analysis of access data showed an initial peak of interest
followed by a sustained level of activity, especially by healthcare pro-
fessionals.
The iterative process employed to develop the clinical pathway for
tongue-tie release was another strength of the programme. The shared
expertise of a wide range of healthcare professionals in primary care
and hospital care settings, and a high level of cooperation within the
working group and transparent sharing of the audit findings led to
consensus being reached for best practice clinical management. An
indirect beneficial outcome of this collaboration has been the devel-
opment of better working relationships between primary care providers
and hospital clinicians in the region. Ongoing communication amongst
clinicians has confirmed that there has been no increase in privately
accessed frenotomy surgery associated with the reduction in interven-
tions in publicly funded clinics.
Initial consultation with health professionals confirmed widespread
confusion about the normal range of tongue anatomy and the level of
restriction in function that may cause breastfeeding difficulties. A si-
milar situation was reported by Segal et al. [4]. A common mis-
understanding was identification of a visible lingual frenulum as a
tongue-tie, which is inappropriate without assessment of function [17].
This confusion and incorrect terminology can generate parental anxiety
and expectation of breastfeeding problems, along with an increased
demand for surgery [5,17].
Introduction of the new pathway was supported by education ses-
sions for all interested health providers and was integral to embedding
better understanding of tongue anatomy and function, and recognising
the wide range of potential causes for breastfeeding difficulties and
scope for non-surgical breastfeeding support. Future initiatives planned
for the programme include electronic referral for breastfeeding-fre-
notomy assessment using a link on CHP and enhanced use of social
media to share updated clinical and breastfeeding information.

Randomised controlled studies on the effectiveness of frenotomies
have produced inconsistent results with some reporting benefits
[34–36] and others no discernable improvement in breastfeed diffi-
culties [37,38]. The evidence base is still considered limited mainly
because of heterogeneity in study methodology [4,10,39]. Our audit
process also had limitations in that the response rate of the two audits
and the time until follow-up varied, and a validated questionnaire was
not used to obtain information from the mothers. Despite these lim-
itations, subjective breastfeeding improvements following frenotomy
have been reported consistently in research, and were observed in both
our audits with approximately 85% of mothers reporting an improve-
ment in breastfeeding. Analysis of subjective responses however re-
quires caution as research indicates that expectation has the potential
for relieving many symptoms [40]. The expectation of an improvement
in feeding following a tongue-tie release may therefore have influenced
the mother's responses.
4.2. Implications for practice
The clinical challenge with mother and baby dyads experiencing
breastfeeding difficulties is to determine how best to support them. The
surgical release of a lingual frenulum is only one of many treatment or
support options. For example, in some infants interventions such as
adjusting the mother's positioning and attachment technique may re-
solve breastfeeding difficulties [41]. More accurately determining
which dyads will derive breastfeeding benefit from a frenotomy will
help avoid unnecessary surgery and prevent delays in accessing the
most appropriate breastfeeding support. This conundrum has been
discussed by Sethi [5] and Walsh and Tunkel (39) who emphasized the
importance of clinical judgement and determining the cause of the
breastfeeding difficulty for each dyad before intervening.
A clinical pathway that requires standardised assessment of fre-
nulum function and anatomy, along with early breastfeeding assess-
ment and support by either a lactation consultant or midwife with
additional training, before tongue-tie release surgery is sound practise.
Our findings are consistent with several other studies that showed ac-
cess to evidence-based, family-centred care is important to effectively
manage tongue-tie [5,8,25,26].
The BTAT screening tool proved to be reliable for evaluating fre-
nulum function, with good inter-user reliability. Introduction of BTAT
led initially to an increase in declined referrals for a frenotomy, how-
ever over time, inclusion of the tool in the clinical pathway for as-
sessment of breastfeeding problems led to more appropriate referrals
being made. Declined referrals are now a rare occurrence.
In conclusion, the multifactorial programme described in this paper
supported the breastfeeding dyad with early lactation consultant sup-
port alongside an objective assessment of tongue function and anatomy.
The programme reduced the frenotomy intervention rate for tongue-ties
in infants while showing that ongoing feeding methods were not dif-
ferent in the group of infants who received a frenotomy or those who
were declined. Collaboration between health professionals, and an ex-
tensive educational programme with ready access to localised clinical
information for healthcare workers and consumers were key factors
that contributed to this change.
