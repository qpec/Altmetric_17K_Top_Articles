Overview  
 
 
The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a brief, generic, multi-use, self-administered health 
survey comprised of 12 items. The instrument is primarily used to measure health related quality of life, to 
estimate disease burden and to evaluate disease-specific benchmarks with other populations. The 12 items in the 
questionnaire correspond to eight principal physical and mental health domains including general health 
perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical and emotional problems; bodily pain; 
energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health..  The 12 items are summarized into two scores, a 
“Physical Health Summary Measure {PCS-physical component score}” and a “Mental Health Summary 
Measure {MCS-mental component score}”. These  provide an important contrast between physical and 
psychological health status.

Development 
 
 
The VR-12 was derived from the Veterans RAND 36 Item Health Survey (VR-36), historically called the 
Veterans SF-36 (Kazis et al 2006 1,2). The VR-36 was adapted from the RAND SF-36 Version 1.0 
questionnaire, and spans the range of health domains from physical to psychological health status. In 
comparison with the RAND SF-36, there are two modifications made in the VR-36. The first modification is an 
increase in the number of response choices for the role physical (RP) and role emotional (RE) items from a  two 
point yes/no choice to a five-point likert scale (no, none of the time, yes, a little of the time, yes, some of the 
time, yes, most of the time, yes, all of the time).The second modification is the use of two items to assess health 
change, one focusing on physical health and one on emotional problems, in contrast to the one general change 
item in the RAND SF-36 (Kazis et al 2004 3,4). The VR-36 has been widely used, distributed and documented in 
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) with close to 2 million questionnaires administered nationally in six 
national surveys since 1996. The changes to the survey have increased the overall precision of the instrument 
and the discriminant validity of the physical and mental component summary scales (Kazis et al 2006 5). The 
VA has adopted the VR-36 as a primary measure of health related quality of life and functional status measures, 
and a secondary measure of disease burden and for risk adjustment purposes for comparisons made among 
veterans. The VR-12 was developed using extensive research and normative data from the VR-36 in the VHA. 
It consists of the 12 most important items from the VR-36 for construction of the physical and mental 
component summary scales. The 12 items in the VR-12 explain a great deal of the variability in the VR-36. The 
scoring of PCS and MCS is based on weights derived from the VR-36 administered to 1.4 million veteran 
enrollees with 877,775 respondents in the 1999 Large Health Survey of Veteran Enrollees (Veterans Health 
Study), the largest federal survey ever conducted in the VA. The weights were obtained from the large sample 
in the VA survey to create PCS and MCS scores. That is, dummy indicators were defined for response choices 
for each of the 12 items in the VR-12 and these were then entered into multiple regressions to predict PCS and 
MCS scores based on the VR-36. The resulting weights, and the constant term, can be used to compute PCS and 
MCS scores from the VR-12. The two summary component scales derived from the VR-12 explained over 90% 
of the variance in PCS and MCS scales of the VR-36 used in the 1999 Large Health Survey of Veterans 
Enrollees (Jones et al 2001 6). 
 
 
Applications and Usability 
 
Applications of the VR-12 
 
The VR-12 has been administered in national VA surveys in 1997 and 1998 to over 60,000 patients. Since 
2002, the VA has administered the VR-12 to approximately 432,000 patients annually as part of its quality 
management program (Survey of Health Experiences of Patients, SHEP). As of spring 2006, the US Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Studies (CMS) has been administering the VR-12 to Medicare enrollees as part of the 
Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (Medicare HOS 2.0), designed to monitor the quality of care in Medicare 
Advantage Plans (MAP) (Kazis et al 2004 4). The VR-12 has been included in HEDIS 2007 (Health Plan 
Employer Data and Information Set), as part of the performance measurement data set most widely used and 
disseminated in the managed care industry.   
 
When administered to a patient population in time, the VR-12 provides a reliable and valid measure of health 
status and case mix adjustment. It has been an important source, for the office of Quality and Performance at the 
VHA, to monitor the process and outcomes of care at the program and system levels. Similarly, CMS uses the 
VR-12 to assess the physical and mental health functioning of its enrollees and to generate information for 
payment adjustments.

The effectiveness of the VR-12 in estimating health status and disease burden along with providing a rubric for 
risk adjustments has been demonstrated in several publications spanning multiple disease systems (Kazis et al 
2006 5). Subsequently, it has provided applications in the VA for conducting medication effectiveness studies 
based upon non-randomized prospective quasi-experimental designs that approximate real world clinical 
conditions. Such applications using the VR-12 have been widely published for medication studies in those 
diagnosed with hypertension, osteoarthritis, low back pain, depression, and schizophrenia. 
 
 
Chronic Disease Burden 
 
The most traditional application of health status measures is the evaluation of change in relation to the presence 
of different comorbid conditions. VR-12 is used to gauge the incremental effect of case mix on health status and 
make meaningful comparisons about populations with different chronic diseases, thus providing a proxy for 
disease burden. The Medical Outcomes study (MOS) reported an overall mean (age and sex adjusted) of 43.6 
and 52.3 for SF- 36 PCS and MCS scores, respectively.  This was in contrast to the means of 36.91 (PCS) and 
45.08 (MCS) for VR-36 in the Veterans Administration health care system, thus reflecting a greater disease 
burden among veterans (Rogers et al 2004 7). With respect to the specific effect of comorbid conditions on 
health status, the use of VR-36 PCS and MCS measures has been instrumental in gauging the incremental 
impact of case mix across several chronic disease conditions (Kazis et al 2004 8). For example the Veterans 
Health Study showed that having angina resulted in a PCS score that is 2.53 points lower (0.25 of 1 standard 
deviation) than the score of those veterans without angina. Similarly, the presence of depression led to an 8-
point reduction in MCS among veterans while controlling for other comorbidities and demographics.

 Another study (Gage et al 2003 9) calculated the PCS and MCS scores for Veterans with Parkinson disease and 
compared them with those with eight other neurological or chronic conditions. Veterans with Parkinson’s 
disease had PCS and MCS scores lower than scores of veterans with angina/coronary heart disease, arthritis, 
chronic low back pain, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stroke. The incremental or unique effect of 
Parkinson’s disease on Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was found to lower PCS and MCS by 4.10 and 
3.42 points, respectively. 
 
 
Risk Adjustment 
 
Risk adjustment is a methodology used to control for patient characteristics that may affect health care 
outcomes, and mortality is one key variable of interest in measuring patient-related outcomes. VR-12 PCS and 
MCS summary measures have been used extensively as integral elements of risk adjustment models that were 
developed to reliably predict mortality in VA patients receiving ambulatory care. In one longitudinal study 
(Selim et al 2002 10) involving 31, 823 VA patients followed for 18 months, patients with higher VR-12 PCS 
and MCS scores showed a lower likelihood of dying, as indicated by odds ratios in the logistic regression 
models. The highly significant associations of VR-12 PCS and MCS summary measures with mortality resulted 
in their inclusion as important predictor variables in the final risk adjustment model. In another study (Selim et 
al 11) comprising a representative sample of 324,865 VHA ambulatory patients, a risk adjustment model for 
mortality was developed using a prospective monitoring system of outcomes of patients receiving ambulatory 
care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) integrated service networks (VISNs). The baseline VR-12 
PCS and MCS measures were significantly associated with mortality and were included as predictor variables in 
the final risk adjustment model. 
 
Performance Indicator/Outcomes Assessment 
 
Another core application of the VR-36 is its established use in assessing health outcomes and systems’ 
performances in large health care systems. The first application of this kind employed the RAND SF-36 PCS 
and MCS change scores as performance indicators to compare health outcomes among chronically ill Medicare 
enrollees in health maintenance organizations (HMO) with the health outcomes of those in the fee for service 
(FFS) systems (Ware et al 1996 12). This approach of using health status measures to measure systems’ 
performance was then validated for the VR-36 in a representative sample of 31, 823 VA patients across 22 
integrated service networks (Selim et al 2006 13). The change in VR-36 PCS and MCS measures, included as 
part of a multidimensional risk adjusted model, served as the basis for calculating and comparing expected 
versus actual PCS and MCS rates at the individual patient level for each integrated network. The adjusted rate 
for a network was its observed rate divided by its expected rate, multiplied by the mean of the rates observed for 
all networks. The comparison of expected versus actual rates at the VA regional level (Vertically Integrated 
Service Networks – VISNs) provided a framework to assess network performance after case mix adjustments 
and to identify processes of care or management practices that may serve as models for best practices. 
Conversely, greater-than-expected rates of decline in health status measures served as a basis to assess gaps in 
quality of care and disease management. Recently, the use of VR-12 health status measures as outcome and 
performance indicators has been validated in cross-system comparisons between the MAP enrollees and VHS 
cohorts (Selim et al 2006 14).

Interpretation Guidelines of the VR-12: Issues around Clinical Relevance  
 
The clinical relevance of any change observed in PCS and MCS scores in response to an intervention should be 
an important consideration in understanding the chronic disease conditions. A result may be statistically 
significant but may not be clinically meaningful.  
 
 
Therefore one essential characteristic of an instrument is its ability to detect clinically important and meaningful 
changes in patient’s function as a result of an intervention (Kirshner et al 1985 15, Guyatt et al 1987 16). There 
are several techniques that can be employed to quantify this responsiveness of an instrument towards a 
clinically important change (Lydick et al 1993 17). Anchor-based methodology measures a patient change score 
against a clinically relevant or outside change, while distribution-based methods rely on effect sizes (Lydick et 
al 1993 17). Effect size is the mean change of the individual divided by the variability of the whole group or the 
subset of stable subjects. An effect size of 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 is moderate, while 0.8 or greater is 
considered large (Cohen et al 1977 18).  
 
There are at least three published approaches for calculating effect size, where the numerator for each approach 
is the pre-treatment score minus the post-treatment score. The denominator however differs among these 
approaches, the first is the standard deviation of score changes for the group (Cohen et al 1977 18), the second is 
the standard deviation of score changes for a stable or a control group (Guyatt et al 1987 16), and the third 
suggested is the standard deviation of the pretreatment group (Kazis et al 1989 19).  
 
The VR-36 (and VR-12) has been employed in relation to both anchor based and distribution based techniques 
to gauge the clinical significance of a change following an intervention. One of the profound applications of 
VR-36 (and VR-12) is its consistent ability to show the relevant clinical impact of an intervention (or no 
intervention) as an associated difference in the PCS and/or MCS scores. One randomized double blind placebo 
controlled trial (Donta et al 2004 20), designed to evaluate the benefits and harms of doxycycline treatment 
among Gulf War veterans, used the change in VR-36 PCS scores as the primary outcome of the study. 
Following treatment (doxycyline or placebo), the proportion of patients showing more than seven units of 
improvement on the PCS scores of VR-36 were termed as improved. The change of 7 units or greater was 
selected because it is outside the 95% confidence interval for an individual participant score (standard error of 
the measurement) and differences of this magnitude have also been shown to be clinically relevant. Pain, fatigue 
and cognitive function, measured through VR-36 items, were taken as secondary outcomes. The study showed 
no significant differences in primary and secondary outcomes as a function of change in VR-36 health status 
measures between the two groups, and concluded that long term treatment with doxycycline did not improve 
outcomes of Gulf war veterans at one year. 
 
 In another multi-center trial of Gulf War veterans (Donta et al 2003 21), VR-36 health status measures were 
employed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exercise, and a combination of 
the two at improving physical functioning and decreasing symptoms of Gulf War Veterans’ Illness (GWVI). 
Based on previous validation studies of clinically meaningful change, a metric of seven-units of  improvement 
in VR-36 PCS score and any standardized change in the VR-36 items for pain, fatigue, cognitive functioning, 
distress and mental health functioning symptoms was taken as primary and secondary end points, respectively. 
The study showed that CBT significantly improved the physical functioning of veterans as reflected by the PCS 
summary scores, while exercise led to modest improvements in nearly all symptoms (VR-36 item scales) except 
pain.  Both treatments enhanced cognitive and mental health functioning. 
 
One longitudinal study compared the responsiveness of four generic instrument measures (Quality of Well-
Being Scale {QWB}, SF-36 Visual Analog Scale {VAS}, VR-36 MCS, World Health Organization 
Disablement Assessment Schedule {WHO-DAS}) in detecting clinically meaningful improvement in 
schizophrenia symptoms among 134 newly diagnosed veterans (Pyne et al 2003 22). The VR-36 MCS measure 
  
7
along with other generic measures showed significant correlations with changes in side effects, depression 
symptoms, as well as with PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) scores as a function of an effect 
size variable. 
 
The VR-36 MCS measure was also employed in one longitudinal VA study of 2,427 male veterans to examine 
the association of sexual assault and religious inclinations with mental health (Chang et al 2003 23). The subjects 
with reported sexual assault showed poorer mental health status as shown by lower MCS scores. Furthermore, 
the decrement in mental health (MCS score) status was in lesser degrees for patients with religious inclinations. 
 
A widely emerging application of VR-36 (VR-12) PCS and MCS measures is their use in assessing health 
outcomes for medication effectiveness studies with quasi-experimental designs, employing VA administrative 
databases. In one retrospective cohort study (Hamed et al 2001 24) combined the patient reported data from the 
1999 Large Health Survey of Veteran Enrollees with the VA administrative claims and pharmacy data at the 
individual patient level, and examined the differential effect of various antidepressants on PCS and MCS scores. 
Results showed that patients on a single anti-depressant medication tended to have higher scores for PCS and 
MCS (denoting better health) than patients on two or more medications. Among single drug group patients 
using a serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), results were higher for 
MCS, and lower for PCS, than patients on a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), venlafaxine. 
Risk adjustments included demographics (age, gender) and medical and psychiatric co-morbidities using ICD-9 
codes. 
 
In a separate study related to patient perception of pain in those diagnosed with chronic low back pain (CLB) 
and/or osteoarthritis (OA), Hamed et al. 200425 examined the effect of duration of therapy of an opioid 
analgesic- transdermal fentanyl (TDF)- on patient-reported change in physical and emotional health using the 
VR-36. This 3 year, retrospective cohort study merged the patient-reported outcomes data from the 1999 Large 
Health Survey of Veteran Enrollees with the VA claims and pharmacy data to yield a sample size of 441 
veterans who were on therapy with the target medications during the time of the survey. Using the merged data 
for each patient record, three therapeutic groups were identified based on the pattern of prescription: (1) those 
prescribed TDF only and no short-acting opioids; (2) switchers-to-TDF who were prescribed a short-acting 
opioid, then switched to TDF; and (3) concomitant users who were prescribed TDF with a short-acting opioid 
simultaneously during the period of observation. Multivariate models with risk adjustments showed that TDF 
was associated with a significant improvement in physical and emotional change per month, reaching a one-half 
standard deviation improvement (moderate effect size) in 5 months for physical change, and 10 months for 
emotional change. Results suggested that patients receiving TDF report patient-perceived improvement in their 
physical and emotional status compared to a year ago, despite their compromised health. 
 
 
The VR-36 PCS and MCS measures have also been reliable and effective in documenting a perceived change in 
health-related quality of life and health resource utilization in response to poor health behaviors and lifestyle 
factors. Several large investigations (Kazis et al 2004 8, Borzecki et al 2005 26) of patient-reported outcomes 
using VR-36 have shown significant negative associations between smoking and VR-36 PCS and MCS 
measures, and between alcohol use and VR-36 PCS and MCS scores. Exercise and body mass index (BMI) 
were also shown to be significant predictors of PCS scores in these studies, after adjusting for 
sociodemographics and comorbid conditions.   
 
The significant associations of  VR-36/VR-12 PCS and MCS summary measures with clinically recognizable 
and meaningful changes in randomized clinical trials and observational naturalistic prospective studies strongly 
suggest  that these measures can be applied to other empirical inquiries  designed to quantify a clinical benefit. 
However, clinically important differences may differ across different groups of patients with distinct diseases, 
levels of severity, demographics and socioeconomic status. Repeated, well-designed, and clinically oriented 
standard HRQoL assessments applied as endpoints  across different population groups will help clinicians to 
 make more reliable and meaningful clinical interpretations of summary scales. They also provide a 
multidimensional framework to evaluate chronic disease conditions and associated clinical interventions.
