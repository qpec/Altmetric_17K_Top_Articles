Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains almost invariably fatal despite 
optimal surgical and medical therapy. The association between the extent of tumor resection 
(EOR) and outcome remains undefined, notwithstanding many relevant studies.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether greater EOR is associated with improved 1- and 2-year 
overall survival and 6-month and 1-year progression-free survival in patients with GBM.
DATA SOURCES—Pubmed, CINAHL, and Web of Science (January 1, 1966, to December 1, 
2015) were systematically reviewed with librarian guidance. Additional articles were included 
after consultation with experts and evaluation of bibliographies. Articles were collected from 
January 15 to December 1, 2015.
STUDY SELECTION—Studies of adult patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM 
comparing various EOR and presenting objective overall or progression-free survival data were 
included. Pediatric studies were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS—Data were extracted from the text of articles or the 
Kaplan-Meier curves independently by investigators who were blinded to each other’s results. 
Data were analyzed to assess mortality after gross total resection (GTR), subtotal resection (STR), 
and biopsy. The body of evidence was evaluated according to Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria and PRISMA guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES—Relative risk (RR) for mortality at 1 and 2 years and 
progression at 6 months and 1 year.
RESULTS—The search produced 37 studies suitable for inclusion (41 117 unique patients). The 
meta-analysis revealed decreased mortality for GTR compared with STR at 1 year (RR, 0.62; 
95%CI, 0.56–0.69; P < .001; number needed to treat [NNT], 9) and 2 years (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 
0.79–0.89; P < .001; NNT, 17). The 1-year risk for mortality for STR compared with biopsy was 
reduced significantly (RR, 0.85; 95%CI, 0.80–0.91; P < .001). The risk for mortality was similarly 
decreased for any resection compared with biopsy at 1 year (RR, 0.77; 95%CI, 0.71–0.84; P < .
001; NNT, 21) and 2 years (RR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.89–1.00; P = .04; NNT, 593). The likelihood of 
disease progression was decreased with GTR compared with STR at 6 months (RR, 0.72; 95%CI, 
0.48–1.09; P = .12; NNT, 14) and 1 year (RR, 0.66; 95%CI, 0.43–0.99; P < .001; NNT, 26). The 
quality of the body of evidence by the GRADE criteria was moderate to low.

 CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE—This analysis represents the largest systematic review and 
only quantitative systematic review to date performed on this subject. Compared with STR, GTR 
substantially improves overall and progression-free survival, but the quality of the supporting 
evidence is moderate to low.
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in 
adults and is known for its invasive and aggressive behavior.1,2 The optimal combination of 
medical, surgical, and radiation therapy for patients with GBM has yet to be defined, and the 
surgical component of therapy can range from a minimally invasive biopsy to a craniotomy 
with a goal of gross total resection (GTR).2 Although the advent of 5-aminolevulinic acid–
guided intraoperative techniques has increased the extent of resection (EOR) that is 
surgically possible, not every patient receives an aggressive resection.3 Moreover, variations 
in treatment protocols have done very little to extend survival, and fierce debate about this 
topic continues.4–6 Although cytoreductive surgery is the cornerstone of therapy in GBM, no 
consensus exists regarding the optimal EOR necessary to improve survival.4,7 Even prior 
meta-analyses on the subject of EOR and overall survival2,8 have provided contradictory 
results.
The causal association between aggressive tumor resection with tumor-negative margins and 
improved survival is a venerated belief in the field of surgical oncology despite several 
spectacular refutations, most notably in the world of breast oncology, where nearly a century 
of commitment to radical mastectomy ultimately yielded to the long-term results of 
randomized clinical trials.9–14 In the realm of neuro-oncology, many large retrospective 
cohort studies have also demonstrated enhanced survival with increased EOR in patients 
with newly diagnosed GBM, and mathematical modeling of retrospective data suggests 
incremental improvements in survival with EORs ranging from 78% to 98%.4,5 However, 
the unique anatomy of the brain and concern about injury to eloquent structures with 
resulting impairment in quality of life often make the goal of GTR difficult to attain. 
Moreover, elegant pathologic and radiologic studies have shown that GBM is a diffusely 
infiltrating and widespread malignant neoplasm that, even at the time of diagnosis, typically 
invades multiple lobes and both hemispheres of the brain.15–18 For all these reasons, 
disagreement continues about the optimum EOR, the true risks and benefits of aggressive 
resection, and how tobalancethem.19,20 As a consequence, most patients do not undergo 
maximum safe resection, and these controversies, as well as the absence of randomized 
clinical trials, have prevented neurosurgical and oncologic professional societies from 
formulating practice guidelines regarding the optimal EOR.20,21
Because of this continuing controversy, widespread practice variation, and considerable 
deficiencies in the available literature, we sought to determine whether GTR compared with 
subtotal resection (STR) or biopsy is associated with prolonged overall and progression-free 
survival using quantitative meta-analytic techniques according to the PRISMA guidelines.11 
We also applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to our results to guide current practice and inform future study.

 Methods
Systematic Review
We conducted a systematic literature review using accepted evidence-based techniques 
under the supervision of an expert librarian with special training in evidence-based literature 
at the George T. Harrell Health Science Library at the Penn State College of Medicine. The 
search queried PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science using the MeSH term glioblastoma 
and the non-MeSH terms extent of resection, resection, and survival to broadly capture the 
existing literature from January 1, 1966, to December 1, 2015. We reviewed individual 
citations, rejected off-topic citations, and downloaded on topic articles before we reviewed 
the articles individually. Studies were included if greater than 80% of study patients were 
adults with newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM, had a comparison group, and provided 
objective data on 1- or 2-year overall survival or 6-month or 1-year progression-free 
survival. Abstracts were accepted if they met the same inclusion criteria and the data from 
the resulting publication were not also included. No language restriction was imposed. 
Articles were excluded if they focused only on pediatric neoplasms, if greater than 50% of 
the primary brain tumors included were tumor types other than GBM, if they did not contain 
a comparison group, or if they did not provide the specified outcome data. Studies that only 
mentioned EOR as a prognostic factor but did not objectively present data according to our 
outcomes of interest were excluded. In addition to the systematic review, the bibliographies 
of qualitative meta-analyses on the subject were searched by hand for relevant articles. Last, 
we consulted experts in the field for any relevant articles that may have been missed by our 
search methods. Articles were collected from January 15 until December 1, 2015.
Data Extraction
Our comparisons of interest were differences in 1- or 2-year overall survival or 6-month or 
1-year progression-free survival between patients with varying EORs .One-year overall 
survival was chosen because it is the approximate median overall survival for patients with 
GBM. Two-year overall survival was chosen as it was likely to reveal significant differences 
in survival with varying EORs, is a clinically important point from a patient perspective, and 
is frequently reported in randomized clinical trials in this disease. The 6-month and 1-year 
progression-free survival end points were selected for the same reasons. The EOR for this 
study was defined by the authors of the individual studies. Resections were broadly grouped 
into GTR, STR, or biopsy. The STR group included patients described as undergoing STR 
and partial resection. Data from most of the studies did not permit more detailed 
classification, for example, grouping based on the percentage of tumor debulking. When the 
percentages of surviving patients at our prespecified survival and progression end points 
were not provided in the text, values were derived from Kaplan-Meier curves using a pixel-
coordinate method of mapping the axes of interest and mathematically calculating 
percentages. Data were extracted independently by members of the study team (T.J.B., 
M.C.B., E.W.C., N.J.B., K.L.R., E.B.R., and M.G.) who were blinded to each other’s results. 
Any disagreements were adjudicated by one of us (M.G.).

 Evidence Grading
Each article was graded independently by the 7 members of the study team using American 
Academy of Neurology level of evidence criteria.25,26 Each article included in each meta-
analysis was first graded independently by these 7 study team members and was 
subsequently reviewed by all 7 authors in a consensus meeting. Each article was assigned a 
grade of I to IV, with I providing the most robust and IV providing the weakest evidence. 
Disagreements were resolved by group consensus after consulting the study in question.
Once data collection was complete and the meta-analyses had been performed, we evaluated 
the overall body of evidence using the GRADE system proposed by Guyatt and colleagues22 
and others.23,24,27 The GRADE rating scale assigns high, moderate, low, or very low 
reliability categories to a body of evidence. Each rating reflects the degree of confidence that 
the magnitude and direction of an estimated effect are correct. This process considers and 
integrates strength of association, magnitude of effect, and risk for bias.
Meta-analysis
Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for each of our comparisons of interest were calculated 
using the random effects model in Review Manager (version 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration 
[http://www.cochrane.org]). Meta-analyses for each of the comparisons were repeated on 
only class 2 studies (when at least two class 2 studies were available) and on only studies 
published within the last 10 years. We also repeated each meta-analysis after excluding 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, and again after excluding SEER 
and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) data to assess the effect of the large sample 
sizes in those studies and the overall meta analytic estimates. The resulting summary 
statistics were compared with the original meta-analyses using RR ratios (the RR calculator 
is found at http://www.hutchon.net). Significance was established using CIs at the level of 
95% or P < .05. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots.
Results
Literature Search
A systematic literature review yielded 1055 citations, of which 1005 were unique citations. 
Review of titles and publication type allowed 883 citations to be rejected because the 
corresponding studies lacked a comparison group, failed to provide specified outcome data, 
or compared treatments other than EOR. One hundred twenty-two articles were deemed 
potentially suitable for inclusion, retrieved, and analyzed by the group for final eligibility 
determination. Thirty-seven articles6,7,20,28–62 met our inclusion criteria (41 117 unique 
patients) and were included in at least 1 comparison in the meta-analysis. Thirty-six studies 
(References 6, 7, 20, 28, 30–40, 42, 45, 47–51, 53–59, 62) were included in the meta-
analyses of overall survival, and 8 articles29,41,43,44,46,52,60,61 were included in the meta-
analyses of progression-free survival. Hand searching the bibliographies of recent meta-
analyses did not reveal any additional articles fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Three articles 
were identified from consultation with experts in the field that were ultimately included in 
our meta-analyses. The landmark study by Lacroix et al4 was excluded because a new, larger 
study with less risk for bias,34 which included data from the earlier trial, had subsequently

 been published. The search process and results are outlined in Figure 1.63 Demographic data 
for included studies are included in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Evidence Grading
Our review failed to discover any class 1 studies. We included four class 2 studies.36,49,54,61 
The remaining studies were assigned a class III (15 studies) (References 6, 20, 30, 32, 35, 
44, 46, 47, 51–53, 55–57, 60) or class IV (18 studies) (References 7, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 37–
43, 45, 48, 50, 58, 62) rating (Table). None of the identified studies were prospective or 
randomized by EOR; however, 1 study36 was prospective and randomized by surgical 
technique. Many of the studies had substantial differences between treatment groups in 
prognostically important features, including age, performance status, tumor size, tumor 
location, multifocality, medical comorbidities, and postoperative treatments. No trial 
analyzing progression-free survival used masked outcome assessment. Although survival is a 
relatively robust outcome measure, progression-free survival is notoriously subject to 
outcome assessment bias. As a result, the progression-free survival end point was further 
downgraded because of the substantial risk for bias (Table).
Publication Bias
A funnel plot was constructed for each meta-analysis to assess publication bias. The largest 
funnel plot that compared 1-year overall survival in patients with GTR vs STR contained 25 
articles. The funnel plot suggests a potential deficit of small trials favoring STR over GTR 
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Although several studies were identified in searching prior 
meta-analyses that seemed to favor STR over GTR, none of these trials contained data that 
met our inclusion criteria.64
Body of Evidence Quality (GRADE Rating)
Our final assessment of the quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE criteria was 
moderate for the overall survival outcome measure and for meta-analyses including only 
class 2 studies. The assessment was low for all other comparisons.
Meta-analysis for Overall Survival
The meta-analysis revealed substantially improved overall survival after GTR compared 
with STR at 1 year (RR, 0.62; 95% CI,0.56–0.69;P < .001; number needed to treat [NNT], 
9)and 2 years (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79–0.89; P < .001; NNT, 17) (Figure 2 and Figure 3). A 
similar improvement was revealed in 1-year overall survival for STR compared with biopsy 
(RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80–0.91; P < .001). Two-year mortality for STR compared with biopsy 
was not significantly improved (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; P = .09)(Figure 4). Any 
resection compared with biopsy alone showed improved 1-year (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71–
0.84; P < .001; NNT, 21) and 2-year (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00; P = .04; NNT, 593) 
mortality (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Additional Meta-analyses
For the end points of 1- and 2-year overall survival, the meta-analyses were repeated 
including only the class 2 trials, with results similar to those of the larger meta-analyses. For

 comparison of GTR with STR, the RRs for death at 1 and 2 years and NNTs to achieve one 
additional 1- or 2-year survivor were 0.62 (95% CI, 0.55–0.69; P < .001; NNT, 5) and 0.72 
(95% CI, 0.49–1.07; P = .11; NNT, 7), respectively. We also calculated RRs for 1- and 2-
year mortality with STR vs biopsy and any resection vs biopsy. However, these comparisons 
only included 2 studies54,61 and constituted an identical data set for both comparisons. 
Although the RRs for STR vs biopsy suggest decreased mortality, statistical significance 
was not achieved, perhaps because of the very small number of patients included in these 2 
studies (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
We then repeated the meta-analyses after removing the very large single study based on 
SEER data32 as a sensitivity analysis to avoid distortion by a single large study and again 
after removing the SEER study and the study derived from composite RTOG data.36 In both 
instances, essentially no change was found in the meta-analytic summary statistics for any 
comparison (eTable 2 in the Supplement).32,36 Comparison of the RR ratios after the 
removal of these large data sets confirmed that no effect was found on the meta-analytic 
results (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). Finally, the meta-analyses were repeated after 
excluding studies that analyzed patients accrued before 2000 and before 2005.Once again, 
we found no effect on any meta-analytic result (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Progression-Free Survival
Relatively few articles met inclusion criteria for the secondary end point of progression-free 
survival at 6 months. Eight studies29,41,43,44,46,52,60,61 were identified from the systematic 
review and were included in at least 1 progression analysis. At 6 months, the RR for 
progression when comparing GTR with STR was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.48–1.09; P = .12; NNT, 
14), a statistically nonsignificant finding favoring GTR. At 1 year, the RR for progression 
significantly favored GTR at 0.66 (95% CI, 0.43–0.99; P < .001; NNT, 26) (eFigure 4A and 
B in the Supplement).
Subtotal resection also significantly reduced the risk for progression at 6 months when 
compared with biopsy (RR,0.72; 95% CI, 0.51–1.00; P = .05; NNT, 321) (eFigure 4C in the 
Supplement). At 1 year, the risk for progression was not significantly different between the 2 
interventions (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79–1.17; P = .69). Last, any resection appeared to reduce 
the risk for progression compared with biopsy alone at 6 months (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44–
0.84; P = .003; NNT, 330) (eFigure 4D in the Supplement). At 1 year, the risk for 
progression was not significantly different (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69–1.01; P = .07).
Discussion
This report is, to our knowledge, the largest systematic review and the only quantitative 
meta-analysis to date to examine the association between EOR and overall and progression 
free survival. We found that patients with newly diagnosed GBM undergoing GTR were 
61% more likely to survive 1 year (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56–0.69; P < .001),19% more likely 
to survive 2 years (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79–0.89; P < .001), and 51% more likely to be 
progression free at 12 months (RR, 0.66; 95% CI,0.43–0.99; P < .001) compared with 
patients receiving only an STR. These benefits translate into NNTs of 9, 17, and 26, 
respectively. When only class 2 studies are analyzed, the NNTs to achieve one additional 1-

 or 2-year survivor (again comparing GTR with STR) are an even more impressive 5 and 7, 
although the 2-year end point was not statistically significant. For comparison with widely 
accepted neurosurgical and neurologic interventions, the NNTs for endarterectomy for 
stroke prevention in the setting of severe and moderate symptomatic stenosis are 12 and 75; 
for warfarin compared with aspirin for primary stroke prevention and compared with 
placebo for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of atrial fibrillation, 57 and 8; for 
intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 6 hours of an ischemic event, with the end 
point alive and independent at 6 months, 19; and for clopidogrel for secondary prevention of 
vascular events, 196.65–68 Our findings were unchanged after excluding all class 3 and 4 
studies, after excluding studies accruing patients more than 10 and 15 years ago, and after 
excluding 2 large studies based on aggregate data. Subtotal resection also produced superior 
1-year overall survival compared with biopsy, but this benefit was less substantial than for 
GTR, possibly because of variable and imprecise definitions of STR and biopsy in many 
studies, potentially leading to very heterogeneous populations with overlapping EORs.
These findings must be interpreted in the context of several important caveats. First, the 
GTR and STR cohorts differed with respect to prognostically important variables (especially 
age, performance status, tumor size and topography, eloquent location, medical 
comorbidities, and postoperative therapies) in many trials. Studies providing the highest 
class of evidence (class 2 in this analysis) attempted to account for this serious risk for 
confounding. Unfortunately, we were not able to extract patient-level data regarding these 
variables, and no randomized clinical trials or carefully designed prospective registries 
address this issue to allow meta-regression or an analysis using propensity score matching. 
Should data of this type become available, a more robust analysis based on these variables 
could be performed. Second, small studies favoring STR or biopsy may be lacking, which 
suggests possible publication bias. Several trials were uncovered in our systematic review 
that favored less extensive resection; however, these studies failed to meet prespecified 
inclusion criteria for our study. Finally, EOR was defined by the authors of the individual 
studies, often imprecisely and almost always in an unblended fashion. Two retrospective 
studies used mathematical modeling to estimate such a threshold and suggested that at least 
a 78% reduction in preoperative tumor volume is necessary to increase survival and that 
incremental benefit accrues to increasingly more complete resections up to 98%.4,48
Conclusions
Although the available studies are retrospective and mostly carry a high risk for bias and 
confounding, an overwhelming consistency of the evidence (including three class 2 studies) 
supports the superiority of GTR over STR and biopsy. We therefore suggest, based on three 
class II studies and many consistent class 3 studies, that GTR probably increases the 
likelihood of 1-year survival compared with STR by about 61% and increases the likelihood 
of 2-year survival by about 19%. Similar improvements (51%) are seen in 12-month 
progression-free survival. Therefore, when clinically feasible, the body of literature favors 
GTR in all patient switch newly diagnosed GBM. In light of the existing evidence, we 
further suggest that additional retrospective cohort trials will not contribute additional useful 
data and should not be performed or published. Randomized clinical trials have not proved 
feasible. A high-quality, audited, prospective registry of patients with GBM represents a

 valuable alternative for identifying factors that affect patient outcomes such as EOR, 
adjuvant therapies, molecular data, preoperative and postoperative imaging, tumor size, 
topography, location, and medical comorbidities, and should be a critical priority for the 
neurosurgical and oncology communities.

 Key Points
Question
Does increasing the extent of resection improve the likelihood of overall survival in 
glioblastoma multiforme?
Findings
In this meta-analysis of 37 studies, gross total resection was significantly associated with 
a lower relative risk for mortality at 1 and 2 years compared with subtotal resection. 
Overall, a dose-dependent reduction in mortality was seen with increasing extent of 
resection.
Meaning
These findings support the use of gross total resection for glioblastoma multiforme for 
reducing 1- and 2-year mortality.

Relative Risk (RR) for 1-Year Mortality for Gross Total Resection (GTR) vs Subtotal 
Resection (STR)
Forest plots depict RRs (random Mantel-Haenszel test) at 1 year. Twenty-five studies were 
included in this analysis of 20 769 patients. Overall RR at 1 year is 0.62 (95%CI, 0.56–0.69; 
P < .001), favoring GTR over STR. Removal of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER) data produced an RR of 0.60 (95%CI, 0.53–0.67; P < .001). Removal of the 
SEER and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group data produced an RR of 0.59 (95%CI, 0.53–
0.65; P < .001). Marker size indicates the relative weight of the study as it contributes to the 
results of the overall comparison.

Relative Risk (RR) for Mortality for Subtotal Resection (STR) vs Biopsy
Forest plots depict RRs (random Mantel-Haenszel test) at 1 and 2 years. A, Twenty studies 
were included in this analysis of 14 136 patients. The RR of mortality at 1 year with STR is 
0.85 (95%CI, 0.80–0.91; P < .001). Removal of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER) data produced an RR of 0.85 (95%CI, 0.78–0.92; P < .001) compared with 
biopsy. B, Sixteen studies were included in this analysis of 13 811 patients. The RR of 
mortality at 2 years did not significantly differ between STR and biopsy in this analysis (RR,

 0.99; 95%CI, 0.97–1.00; P = .09).We hypothesized that the narrower differences between 
STR and biopsy result from the wide percentages of resections that constitute STR in the 
primary literature and perhaps some overlap between biopsy and STR, particularly in the 
setting of smaller tumors. Marker size indicates the relative weight of the study as it 
contributes to the results of the overall comparison.
