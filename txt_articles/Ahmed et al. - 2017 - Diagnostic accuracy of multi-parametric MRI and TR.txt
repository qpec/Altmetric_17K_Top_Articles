Summary
Background Men with high serum prostate specifi
 c antigen usually undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate 
biopsy (TRUS-biopsy). TRUS-biopsy can cause side-eff
 ects including bleeding, pain, and infection. Multi-parametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) used as a triage test might allow men to avoid unnecessary TRUS-biopsy and 
improve diagnostic accuracy.
Methods We did this multicentre, paired-cohort, confi
 rmatory study to test diagnostic accuracy of MP-MRI and 
TRUS-biopsy against a reference test (template prostate mapping biopsy [TPM-biopsy]). Men with prostate-specifi
 c 
antigen concentrations up to 15 ng/mL, with no previous biopsy, underwent 1·5 Tesla MP-MRI followed by both 
TRUS-biopsy and TPM-biopsy. The conduct and reporting of each test was done blind to other test results. Clinically 
signifi
 cant cancer was defi
 ned as Gleason score ≥4 + 3 or a maximum cancer core length 6 mm or longer. This study 
is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01292291.
Findings Between May 17, 2012, and November 9, 2015, we enrolled 740 men, 576 of whom underwent 1·5 Tesla MP-MRI 
followed by both TRUS-biopsy and TPM-biopsy. On TPM-biopsy, 408 (71%) of 576 men had cancer with 230 (40%) of 
576 patients clinically signifi
 cant. For clinically signifi
 cant cancer, MP-MRI was more sensitive (93%, 95% CI 88–96%) 
than TRUS-biopsy (48%, 42–55%; p<0·0001) and less specifi
 c (41%, 36–46% for MP-MRI vs 96%, 94–98% for TRUS-
biopsy; p<0·0001). 44 (5·9%) of 740 patients reported serious adverse events, including 8 cases of sepsis.
Interpretation Using MP-MRI to triage men might allow 27% of patients avoid a primary biopsy and diagnosis of 
5% fewer clinically insignifi
 cant cancers. If subsequent TRUS-biopsies were directed by MP-MRI fi
 ndings, up to 
18% more cases of clinically signifi
 cant cancer might be detected compared with the standard pathway of TRUS-biopsy 
for all. MP-MRI, used as a triage test before fi
 rst prostate biopsy, could reduce unnecessary biopsies by a quarter. 
MP-MRI can also reduce over-diagnosis of clinically insignifi
 cant prostate cancer and improve detection of clinically 
signifi
 cant cancer.

Introduction
The diagnosis of prostate cancer diff
 ers from that in 
other solid organ cancers where imaging is used to 
identify those patients who require a biopsy. The prostate 
cancer diagnostic pathway off
 ers transrectal ultrasound-
guided biopsy (TRUS-biopsy) in men who present with 
an elevated serum prostate specifi
 c antigen (PSA). As a 
result, many men without cancer undergo unnecessary 
biopsies, clinically insignifi
 cant cancers are often 
detected and clinically signifi
 cant cancers are sometimes 
missed.1,2 TRUS-biopsy also carries signifi
 cant morbidity 
and can cause life-threatening sepsis.3
A pathway with imaging as a triage test to decide which 
men with an elevated PSA go on to biopsy might both 
reduce unnecessary biopsy and improve diagnostic 
accuracy. Multi-Parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MP-MRI) provides information on not just tissue 
anatomy but also tissue characteristics such as prostate 
volume, cellularity, and vascularity. There is some 
evidence that MP-MRI tends to detect higher risk disease 
and systematically overlooks low-risk disease,4,5 which 
makes it attractive as a potential triage test.6,7
In our study, we aimed to investigate whether MP-MRI 
could discriminate between men with and without 
clinically signifi
 cant prostate cancer based on template 
prostate mapping biopsy (TPM-biopsy) as a reference 
test. TPM-biopsy is able to accurately characterise disease 
status in men at risk by sampling the entire prostate

every 5 mm. We also aimed to compare the accuracy of 
MP-MRI with that of TRUS-biopsy.8 We hypothesised 
that MP-MRI could be used as a triage test to decide 
which men with an elevated PSA might safely avoid 
immediate biopsy.9
Methods
PROMIS was a prospective, multi-centre, paired-cohort, 
confi
 rmatory study, which represented level 1b evidence 
for diagnostic test assessment10 and reported to the 
Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy.11  Men were 
eligible if they had a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer 
with no previous prostate biopsy. The conduct and 
reporting of each test was done blind to the other test 
results. The full details of our protocol can be accessed at 
http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/our_research/research_areas/
cancer/studies/promis/.8 Ethics committee approval was 
granted by National Research Ethics Service Committee 
London (reference 11/LO/0185).
Our primary objectives were to establish the proportion 
of men who could safely avoid biopsy and the proportion 
of men correctly identifi
 ed by MP-MRI to have clinically 
signifi
 cant prostate cancer. We also carried out a head-to-
head comparison of the accuracy of TRUS-biopsy and 
MP-MRI in terms of sensitivity, specifi
 city, positive 
predictive value and negative predictive value or clinically 
signifi
 cant prostate cancer, using TPM-biopsy as the 
reference standard. TPM-biopsy was chosen as the 
reference test because it samples the entire prostate, is 
highly accurate with estimated 95% sensitivity for 
clinically signifi
 cant prostate cancers due to its 5 mm 
sampling frame. Third, the test can minimise selection 
and work-up biases because it can be applied to men at 
risk who have had no previous biopsy (appendix 
fi
 gure S1).
Patients
Men who had never had a prostate biopsy were eligible if 
there was clinical suspicion they might have prostate 
cancer and they had been advised to have a prostate 
biopsy. This included men with an elevated serum PSA 
(up to 15 ng/mL) within previous 3 months, suspicious 
digital rectal examination, suspected organ confi
 ned 
stage T2 or lower on rectal examination, or family history. 
Eligible men were aged at least 18 years, fi
 t for general or 
spinal anaesthesia, and fi
 t to undergo all protocol 
procedures including a transrectal ultrasound. Men were 
required to give written informed consent. Patients were 
excluded if they were using 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors 
at time of registration or during the previous 6 months; 
had previous history of prostate biopsy, prostate surgery, 
or treatment for prostate cancer (interventions for benign 
prostatic hyperplasia or bladder outfl
 ow obstruction were 
acceptable); had evidence of a urinary tract infection 
or history of acute prostatitis within the last 3 months; 
had any contraindication to MRI (eg, claustrophobia, 
pacemaker, estimated glomerular fi
 ltration rate ≤50); 
had any other medical condition precluding procedures 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Men with an elevated serum PSA blood test usually undergo 
transrectal ultrasound guided (TRUS) biopsy. TRUS-biopsy is 
blind to the location of cancer in the prostate, leading to many 
men without clinically important cancers undergoing 
unnecessary biopsy, over diagnosis of clinically unimportant 
disease, and under-diagnosis of clinically important cancers. In 
PROTECT, men diagnosed with prostate cancer as a result of 
PSA screening were randomly assigned to active monitoring, 
radical prostatectomy, or radical radiotherapy. Results of the 
study showed no cancer-specifi
 c survival diff
 erences at a 
median of 10 years follow-up but reduced time to metastases 
with treatment. Over three-quarters of men in PROTECT had 
low risk disease, exemplifying the problem of over-diagnosis 
from a TRUS biopsy in all strategy and the need to avoid biopsy 
in such men whilst improving detection of cancer that requires 
treatment. A systematic review found multi parametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) had sensitivity 
58–96% and negative predictive value of 63–98% with 
specifi
 city 23–87%.
MP-MRI has not been assessed using an appropriate reference 
standard. Previous studies have either used TRUS-biopsy or 
radical prostatectomy specimens as the reference standard. 
TRUS-biopsy is inaccurate and radical prostatectomy specimens 
are highly selected since men must test positive for cancer on 
TRUS-biopsy and choose to have surgery so these previous 
estimates of diagnostic accuracy are potentially inaccurate.
Added value of this study
We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of TRUS-biopsy and 
MP-MRI using transperineal template prostate mapping 
biopsies (TPM-biopsies) as the reference standard. 
TPM-biopsies can be applied to men at risk and are highly 
accurate since the prostate is sampled every 5 mm. PROMIS 
shows that MP-MRI has signifi
 cantly better sensitivity and 
negative predictive value for clinically important prostate 
cancer compared with TRUS-biopsy. Thus, MP-MRI could be 
used as a triage test before fi
 rst biopsy to allow one quarter of 
men at risk to avoid biopsy. The lower specifi
 city and positive 
predictive value of MP-MRI means that a biopsy is still required 
with a suspicious MP-MRI. Men with suspicious MP-MRI areas 
can have biopsies guided by these fi
 ndings. Overall, this 
strategy could improve detection of clinically important 
prostate cancer and reduce the number of men diagnosed with 
clinically unimportant disease.
Implications of all the available evidence
MP-MRI should be used as a triage test before prostate biopsy 
in men who present with an elevated serum PSA.

described in the protocol; or had previous history of hip 
replacement surgery, metallic hip replacement, or 
extensive pelvic orthopaedic metal work.
Procedures
Test 1: MP-MRI (index test)
Patients received a standardised MP-MRI, compliant with 
European Society of Uro-Radiology guidelines, with 
1·5 Tesla magnetic fi
 eld strength and a pelvic phased-array 
coil. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diff
 usion-weighted and 
dynamic 
gadolinium 
contrast-enhanced 
imaging 
sequences were acquired (appendix table S1). The protocol 
allowed men to be withdrawn after the MP-MRI scan if 
there was evidence of T4 disease or if the prostate volume 
was greater than 100 mL as TPM-biopsy could not be 
applied fully to such large prostates. All MRI scanners used 
by sites and individual MP-MRI scans underwent quality 
control checks by an independent commercial imaging 
Clinical Research Organization appointed through open 
tender (Ixico Ltd, London, UK). Scans deemed of 
insuffi
  cient quality were repeated before the biopsy.
MP-MRI scans were reported at each centre by dedicated 
urologic radiologists who had previous experience of 
reporting prostate MP-MRI. They also underwent 
centralised training involving an initial whole day course, 
in which 20–30 cases were reviewed individually, scored, 
and then reviewed as a group. A further training day 
occurred after the pilot phase with further 20–30 cases 
reviewed individually and collectively. Radiologists were 
provided with clinical details including PSA, digital rectal 
examination fi
 ndings, and any other risk factors such as 
family history. A 5-point Likert radiology reporting scale 
was used to designate prostates as highly unlikely (1), 
unlikely (2), equivocal (3), likely (4), and highly likely (5) to 
harbour clinically signifi
 cant prostate cancer. An MP-MRI 
score of 3 or greater designated a suspicious scan for the 
purpose of our primary outcomes. This scoring system 
was based on the outputs of a consensus group12 convened 
before the publishing of the Prostate Imaging and Data 
Reporting 
System 
(PIRADS) 
MP-MRI 
reporting 
consensus.13 Subsequent comparisons of the Likert and 
PIRADS reporting schemes have yielded similar results.14,15 
To assess inter-observer agreement, 132 scans from the 
lead site were re-reported by a blinded second radiologist 
based at that site.
Tests 2 and 3: combined biopsy procedure
Once the MP-MRI report had been deposited at the 
central trial offi
  ce, a combined prostate biopsy procedure 
was done under general or spinal anaesthesia. Patients 
and physicians remained blinded to the MP-MRI images 
and report. Patients fi
 rst underwent a TPM-biopsy16,17 
followed by TRUS-biopsy. We combined TPM-biopsy 
with TRUS-biopsy under the same procedure to reduce 
patient visits and minimise dropout between tests. Due 
to ethics committee concerns, TRUS-biopsy was done 
after the TPM-biopsy to minimise infection risk. The 
independent Trial Steering Committee monitored safety 
of this combined procedure in terms of sepsis and other 
important side-eff
 ects, and no concerns were raised 
during the trial.
The reference test (TPM-biopsy) was done with core 
biopsies taken every 5 mm and centrally reported at the 
lead centre (UCLH) by one of two expert uropathologists 
blinded to all MR images and TRUS-biopsy fi
 ndings.
In the standard test (TRUS-biopsy), 10–12 core biopsies 
were taken as per international standards,18 with each 
core identifi
 ed and processed separately. The TRUS-
biopsy samples were reported by expert uropathologists 
at each site blinded to the all MR images and TRUS-
biopsy fi
 ndings.
Defi
 nition of clinically signifi
 cant prostate cancer
Disease signifi
 cance was defi
 ned by criteria previously 
developed and validated for use with TPM-biopsy for 
detection of primary Gleason grade 4 or greater19 and 
cancer core length predictive for the presence of lesions 
0·5 mL or larger.20–23 Gleason scoring was based on the 
most frequent pattern and not the highest grade detected 
on histological analysis. The primary defi
 nition used 
a histological target condition on TPM-biopsy that 
incorporated the presence of Gleason ≥4 + 3 or more, or a 
maximum cancer core length (MCCL) involvement of

6 mm or more in any location. Other defi
 nitions of 
clinical signifi
 cance were also assessed secondarily.
Sample size
Power calculations were done in relation to precision 
around the estimates for MP-MRI accuracy in terms of 
the joint primary outcomes of sensitivity and specifi
 city, 
a head-to-head comparison of MP-MRI versus TRUS-
biopsy, and an assumed underlying prevalence of 
primary defi
 nition clinically signifi
 cant cancer of 15%. 
All calculations were based on 90% power and 
5% signifi
 cance (2-sided). This generated a minimum 
target of 321 (for strong correlation between the tests) 
and maximum 714 men (for no correlation between 
the tests).
The Independent Trial Steering Committee carried 
out an a-priori interim review after 50 men had 
undergone all 3 tests, and although a higher than 
anticipated prevalence of any cancer was observed at 
that time, no changes were recommended to the target 
sample size.
Statistical analysis
Our sample size target was 714 men. All statistical 
analyses were done according to a statistical analysis plan 
agreed before inspection of the data. All analyses were 
done using Stata version 13.0 software (Stata Corporation, 
College Station, TX, USA). For each comparison, 
2 × 2 contingency tables were used to present the results 
and calculate the diagnostic accuracy estimates with 
95% confi
 dence intervals. The unit of assessment for our 
2 × 2 contingency table for assessment of accuracy was 
one patient (ie, the whole prostate). The statistical 
analysis plan pre-specifi
 ed that TPM-biopsy results 
would take precedence over TRUS-biopsy results even if 
TRUS-biopsy detected clinically signifi
 cant cancers that 
TPM-biopsy missed.
Given the paired nature of the test results, McNemar 
tests were used for the head-to-head comparisons of 
sensitivity and specifi
 city between MP-MRI and TRUS-
biopsy. Given that the positive and negative predictive 
values are dependent on prevalence of disease, a general 
estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression model was 
used to compare the positive predictive value and 
negative predictive value for MP-MRI and TRUS-biopsy 
against TPM-biopsy.24,25 Odds ratios represent the odds of 
each test correctly detecting the presence or absence of 
disease. For specifi
 city and negative predictive value, the 
coding logic is reversed as the correct test result is a 
negative test result. Ratios are presented as TRUS relative 
to MP-MRI so ratios greater than 1 favour TRUS and 
ratios less than 1 favour MP-MRI. LCB had full access to 
the data and HUA had responsibility for submission of 
the manuscript.
Results
Between May 17, 2012, and Nov 9, 2015, 740 men were 
recruited and registered across 11 centres (fi
 gure 1). 
A total of 576 men underwent all 3 tests with 
164 withdrawn for various reasons (appendix table S2). 
Baseline characteristics for all men (both included and 
withdrawn) are presented in appendix table S3. The 
median time between MP-MRI and combined biopsy 
was 38 days (IQR 1–111) days.
Cancer was detected on TPM-biopsy in 408 (71%) of 
576 men (95% CI 67–75%). The prevalence of clinically 
signifi
 cant cancer according to the primary defi
 nition 
was 230 (40%) of 576 men (36–44). Gleason score ≥4 + 3 
occurred in 56 (10%) of 576 men (7–12) and Gleason ≥3 + 4 
or greater 220 (38%) of 576 (34–42). 174 men were 
classifi
 ed as signifi
 cant on the basis of core length despite 
having low grade disease (appendix table S4).

Data collection was more than 95% complete. For 13 men, 
clinically signifi
 cant cancer was detected on TRUS-biopsy 
but missed on TPM. The statistical analysis plan specifi
 ed 
that the TPM-biopsy results should take precedence so in 
13 (2%) of 576 men in whom TRUS-biopsy designated a 
patient as having clinically signifi
 cant cancer, these were 
treated as false positives as TPM-biopsy found no cancer 
or clinically insignifi
 cant cancer.
Figures 2 and 3 present the diagnostic results for 
sensitivity, specifi
 city, positive predictive value and 
negative predictive value for MP-MRI and TRUS-biopsy 
against TPM-biopsy. Appendix fi
 gure S2 presents the 
proportion of clinically signifi
 cant disease within each 
MP-MRI score.
Sensitivity of MP-MRI for clinically signifi
 cant cancer 
was 93% (95% CI 88–96%) and negative predictive value 
89% (83–94%). Specifi
 city of MP-MRI was 41% (36–46%) 
with positive predictive value 51% (46–56%). 158 (27%) of 
576 men had a negative MP-MRI, of whom 17 had 
clinically signifi
 cant cancer on TPM-biopsy (fi
 gure 2). All 
17 men had Gleason grade 3 + 4 or less with core lengths 
that ranged from 6–12 mm (appendix table S5). From 
fi
 gure 3, of the 119 signifi
 cant cancers missed by TRUS-
biopsy, 13 were Gleason 4 + 3, 99 Gleason 3 + 4 and 
7 Gleason 3 + 3 (appendix table S5).
MP-MRI was more accurate than TRUS-biopsy in 
terms of both sensitivity (93% vs 48%; McNemar test 
ratio 0·52 [95% CI 0·45–0·60]) and negative predictive 
value (89% vs 74%, GEE model estimate for odds 
ratio 0·34 [0·21–0·55]; p<0·0001). TRUS-biopsy showed 
better specifi
 city (41% vs 96%; McNemar test ratio 2·34 
[2·08–2·68], p<0·0001) and positive predictive value 
(51% vs 90%; GEE model estimate for odds ratio 8·2 
[4·7–14·3], p<0·0001; table).
We considered the implications of using MP-MRI by 
comparing the standard strategy of TRUS-biopsy for all 
men to two alternative strategies using MP-MRI as a 
triage test where only men with a suspicious MP-MRI 
(Likert score ≥3) would go on to biopsy (appendix 
table S6). Under the worst case scenario, a standard 
TRUS-biopsy would be done. Under the best case 
scenario, the biopsies would be guided by the MP-MRI 
fi
 ndings and results are presented assuming targeted 
biopsies would achieve similar diagnostic accuracy as 
TPM-biopsy.26,27 For both these scenarios, 158 (27%) of 
576 men would avoid a primary biopsy. For the worst 
case scenario, an absolute reduction in the over-diagnosis 
of clinically insignifi
 cant cancers might be seen, of 
28 (5%) fewer cases per 576 men (relative reduction of 
31%, 95% CI 22–42%). For the best case scenario, over-
diagnosis of clinically insignifi
 cant cancer might be 
increased to 21%, ie, 31 (5%) more cases per 576 men. 
For the correct diagnosis of clinically signifi
 cant cancer, 
the best case scenario might lead to 102 (18%) more cases 
of clinically signifi
 cant cancer being detected per 576 men 
compared with the standard pathway of TRUS-biopsy for 
all (table S6). As we did not test MRI targeted TRUS 
biopsy, the actual eff
 ect of including MP-MRI into the 
pathway probably lies somewhere between these best 
and worst case scenarios.
We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of TRUS-
biopsy and MP-MRI for other defi
 nitions of clinical 
signifi
 cance on TPM-biopsy. The second defi
 nition we 
used was Gleason ≥3 + 4 or any grade with cancer core 
length 4 mm or greater. We also evaluated diagnostic 
accuracy for the presence of any Gleason score 7 (≥3 + 4) 
prostate cancer. The results for all 3 defi
 nitions are 
presented in the table and despite quite diff
 erent prevalence 
of disease, the performance of the diagnostic tests did not 
alter markedly. Clinically signifi
 cant cases missed under 
these defi
 nitions are presented in appendix tables S5 and S7
.
For the 132 men who had blinded, double reporting of 
their MP-MRI scans, agreement for detection of clinically 
signifi
 cant cancer (primary defi
 nition) according to the 
dichotomisation of the MP-MRI scores (1–2 as negative, 
3–5 as positive) was 80% (95% CI 72–87%, appendix 
table S8). This corresponded to a kappa statistic of 0·5 
(moderate agreement). PROMIS was done in 11 UK sites 
with varying experience of MP-MRI reporting. Analysis 
of the primary outcome results stratifi
 ed between the 
central training site (UCLH) and non-UCLH sites 
reported almost identical fi
 ndings.
There were 44 reports of Serious Adverse Events during

Discussion
PROMIS is the fi
 rst study to our knowledge that presents 
blinded data on the diagnostic accuracy of both MP-MRI 
and TRUS-biopsy against an accurate reference test in 
biopsy-naive men with a suspicion of prostate cancer. It 
is the largest registered trial to date of the population at 
risk, across many centres and in which the conduct and 
reporting of each test was standardised and done blind to 
the other test results.28,29 PROMIS represents level 1b 
evidence for assessment of diagnostic accuracy. The 
main fi
 ndings suggest that if MP-MRI was used as a 
triage test, one-quarter of men might safely avoid prostate 
biopsy. The high negative predictive value is reassuring 
in that a negative MP-MRI result implies a high 
probability of no clinically signifi
 cant cancer. Further, 
over-diagnosis of clinically insignifi
 cant cancers might be 
reduced while detection of clinically signifi
 cant cancers 
improved compared with the standard of TRUS-biopsy 
for all men. The lower specifi
 city and positive predictive 
value of MP-MRI shows that a biopsy, with the needles 
deployed based on the MP-MRI fi
 ndings, is still needed 
in those men with a suspicious MP-MRI.
Our results support the fi
 ndings of systematic reviews 
that assess the diagnostic accuracy of MP-MRI.30,31 The 
reviews declared sensitivities of 58–96%, negative 
predictive value of 63–98% and specifi
 city of 23–87%. The 
ranges were broad because of the single centre nature of 
the studies, each of which invoked diff
 erent target 
conditions on diff
 erent reference standards. Most studies 
were limited by retrospective analysis, non-blinding of 
imaging fi
 ndings (incorporation and reporting biases), 
and MP-MRI comparison with inaccurate (TRUS-biopsy) 
or inappropriate (radical prostatectomy) reference tests. 
One other prospective study compared MP-MRI with 
TPM-biopsy that reported interim32 and then fi
 nal 
results.33 
This 
study 
reported 
96% 
sensitivity, 
36% specifi
 city, 92% negative predictive value and 
52% positive predictive value for detection of clinically 
signifi
 cant cancer (defi
 ned as Gleason score 7–10 with 
more than 5% Gleason grade 4, 20% or more positive 
cores, or 7 mm or larger tumour). This Australian study 
was 
not 
blinded, 
was 
single-centre, 
permitted 
two magnetic fi
 eld strength scanners (1·5 Tesla or 
3·0 Tesla), used a TPM-biopsy protocol that sampled the 
prostate with fewer cores and did not include the standard 
test, TRUS-biopsy.34
Our study has some limitations. First, although the use 
of a 5 mm sampling frame of the entire prostate, while 
too invasive for routine clinical use, off
 ered the precision 
required for a highly accurate reference test by virtue of 
its uniform sampling density over the entire prostate 
gland, this did mean prostates over 100 mL had to be 
excluded due to template grid size and bony pubic arch 
interference.35 Exclusion of large prostates might result 
in a decrease in the proportion of true negatives within 
PROMIS. Second, we acknowledge that PROMIS 
represents a selected group although it is encouraging 
that men who were subsequently withdrawn from the 
study did not diff
 er from those who completed the study. 
Third, the sequence of TPM-biopsy followed by TRUS-
biopsy might have contributed to the poor accuracy of the 
standard test due to swelling, distortion, and tissue 
disruption. The sequencing was based on patient safety 
and to preserve the integrity of the reference test. Fourth, 
by the need for blinding, we did not have targeting of 
MR-suspicious lesions and cannot accurately assess 
clinical utility of a MR-targeted biopsy approach. Fifth, 
although we included some measurement of inter-
observer variability, these were between two expert 
readers. Further work is required to measure the inter-
observer variability of expert and non-expert reporters. 
Last, we acknowledge that likelihood ratios and area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 
not part of the pre-specifi
 ed analysis plan. These metrics 
provide an overall measure of test performance and 
clarify the relative strengths and weaknesses of each test, 
particularly as likelihood ratios are independent of 
disease prevalence.
The MP-MRI scans in PROMIS were done using 
1·5 Tesla magnetic fi
 eld strength. This was chosen 
because of its wide availability, and on the assumption 
that, if benefi
 t was shown, then it was likely to be at least 
maintained at higher magnetic fi
 eld strengths where 
greater signal-to-noise ratios can be achieved.
PROMIS was intentionally designed to be done in 
multiple sites and it was reassuring that analysis of the 
results stratifi
 ed between the central training site (UCLH) 
and non-UCLH sites reported almost identical fi
 ndings. 
Of note in PROMIS, the inter-observer agreement results 
indicate that there was moderate agreement of MP-MRI 
scores between two independent radiologists. Our results 
show that variation usually occurred by 1 point on 
the Likert scale. Nonetheless, this is an important 
consideration and highlights the necessity for a robust 
training programme for radiologists. We have shown that 
a high quality MP-MRI can be delivered in a multicentre 
setting in the UK NHS, but all health-care settings will 
need to consider the capacity issues around access to 
high-quality MP-MRI, high quality reporting and high 
quality MRI-targeted biopsies.
Studies using TPM-biopsy as the primary biopsy have 
previously reported a high prevalence of clinically 
signifi
 cant disease.23,36 This highlights the uncertainty 
around what constitutes clinical signifi
 cance.37 In health-
care systems with higher rates of previous PSA testing, 
the proportion of men with clinically signifi
 cant prostate 
cancer, as we have defi
 ned it, is likely to be lower. If MP-
MRI were used as a triage test in these settings, then the 
number of men who could potentially avoid a primary 
biopsy might be higher. Further, the recent ProtecT trial

demonstrates no cancer-specifi
 c survival benefi
 t over 
active monitoring when men are treated with radical 
prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy, although there 
was a benefi
 cial eff
 ect in reducing time to metastases.38 
With the majority of patients having low risk disease in 
PROTECT, this adds weight to the need for strategies, 
such as MP-MRI, that reduce the diagnosis of clinically 
insignifi
 cant cancer and are better able to identify higher 
risk. In the longer-term, we acknowledge that the volume 
and type of patients being referred to secondary care 
could change depending on future validation of potential 
screening strategies that incorporate risk calculators and 
biomarkers.39 Men in PROMIS have consented to follow-
up through linkage to central registries for mortality and 
cancer outcomes so long-term outcomes can be 
ascertained.
Cost-eff
 ectiveness analyses of the PROMIS data are 
underway and will be reported elsewhere, but the 
primary outcome data provide a strong argument for 
recommending MP-MRI to all men with an elevated 
serum PSA before biopsy. Using MP-MRI as a triage test 
would reduce the problem of unnecessary biopsies in 
men who have a low risk of harbouring clinically 
signifi
 cant cancer, reduce the diagnosis of clinically 
insignifi
 cant disease and improve the detection of 
clinically signifi
 cant cancers.
In conclusion, TRUS-biopsy performs poorly as a 
diagnostic test for clinically signifi
 cant prostate cancer. 
MP-MRI, used as a triage test before fi
 rst prostate biopsy, 
could identify a quarter of men who might safely avoid 
an unnecessary biopsy and might improve the detection 
of clinically signifi
 cant cancer.
