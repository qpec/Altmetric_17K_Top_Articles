Abstract: Cnidarian envenomations are the leading cause of severe and lethal human sting injuries
from marine life. The total amount of venom discharged into sting-site tissues, sometimes referred to
as “venom load”, has been previously shown to correlate with tentacle contact length and sequelae
severity. Since <1% of cnidae discharge upon initial tentacle contact, effective and safe removal of
adherent tentacles is of paramount importance in the management of life-threatening cubozoan stings.
We evaluated whether common rinse solutions or scraping increased venom load as measured in a
direct functional assay of venom activity (hemolysis). Scraping significantly increased hemolysis by
increasing cnidae discharge. For Alatina alata, increases did not occur if the tentacles were first doused
with vinegar or if heat was applied. However, in Chironex fleckeri, vinegar dousing and heat treatment
were less effective, and the best outcomes occurred with the use of venom-inhibiting technologies
(Sting No More® products). Seawater rinsing, considered a “no-harm” alternative, significantly
increased venom load. The application of ice severely exacerbated A. alata stings, but had a less
pronounced effect on C. fleckeri stings, while heat application markedly reduced hemolysis for both
species. Our results do not support scraping or seawater rinsing to remove adherent tentacles.

1. Introduction
Box jellyfish stings are an increasing public health problem, causing more deaths annually than
shark attacks worldwide [1–4]. Envenomations can range in severity from mild sting-site pain to
loss of life within minutes [4–7]. Sting severity varies based on several factors, the most important
of which are the species involved and the dose of venom delivered [8,9]. Studies have shown that
the outcomes also vary based on first-aid and clinical-care measures [10–13]. The activity of venom,
which is already deposited into the tissue of the victim at the sting site, can be markedly reduced by
using venom-inhibiting treatments, such as hot-water immersion [10,11,14,15] and dermal-permeating
inhibitors [15]. Since only <1% of tentacle cnidae discharge upon initial contact with human skin [16],
ineffective procedures for removing still-adherent live tentacles have the potential to greatly worsen
sting outcomes by increasing the initial venom load.
While the preponderance of evidence supports the safe, effective, and advantageous use of
vinegar as a rinse solution [16–19] and hot-water immersion or hot packs for pain relief after vinegar

rinsing [14], suggestions for appropriate first aid in the absence of vinegar vary greatly. One of
the most commonly repeated recommendations is the use of scraping with a credit card or razor
to remove tentacles and/or undischarged cnidae [20–40]. This is perhaps a surprising suggestion
given that it is known that pressure can cause both undischarged cnidae, packed on the surface of the
tentacles, as well as intact cnidae shed from the tentacle and left on the skin, to fire [41]; indeed, some
medical professionals explicitly recommend against sting-site scraping [42] (p. 279). To our knowledge,
the safety and efficacy of scraping has not previously been experimentally examined. Thus, we sought
to compare the effects of scraping alone and in combination with other first aids in two cubozoan
species, Alatina alata (Hawaiian box jellyfish, family: Carybdeidae) and Chironex fleckeri (Australian sea
wasp, family: Chirodropidae).
In part, the lack of evaluation of scraping is due to the methods of experimental examination
used to inform clinical management, which do not directly allow for the examination of mechanical
procedures like scraping. While there have been a few clinical studies, there has been a pervasive
assumption that solution-based assays, such as the tentacle solution assay (TSA), are reliable predictors
of clinical outcomes. The TSA, which measures cnidae discharge in the presence of tested solutions
with or without a secondary cnidae stimulus (chemical or physical), is often used to evaluate removal
aids, although direct correlations between the assay results and clinical outcomes have not been well
established. There is also a lack of rigorous correlation between acute findings like pain and redness
and long-term clinical outcomes, further hampering clarity in evaluating first-aid measures.
TSA studies have shown vinegar to be a potent, irreversible inhibitor of cubozoan cnidae
discharge [16,17]. Its use is supported by case studies [43], but its effects on acute indicators, such as
pain and redness, in human cubozoan sting trials are mixed [44–46]. There is moderate evidence that
solutions that induce significant discharge in the TSA, such as ethanol, worsen pain [44,45], but their
effects on overall outcomes are unclear. Seawater does not induce cnidae discharge in the TSA, but it
does not inhibit the subsequent potential discharge of cnidae, either [16–18,44,45]. It is interesting to
note that although seawater is often used as a control for other rinse solutions in clinical studies, no
studies to our knowledge have specifically compared the effects of rinsing with seawater against any
kind of no-rinse control (such as where tentacles are removed by plucking instead), so whether it or
other “inert” solutions are appropriate to use as rinses has never been rigorously studied; and yet,
seawater rinse is the second-most recommended method of removal, especially when vinegar is
not available [20,21,25,26,29–38]. Thus, we sought to compare the effects of rinsing with different
solutions (seawater, freshwater, ethanol, Sting No More® Spray, and vinegar) to removal by scraping
in a functional assay of venom activity utilizing blood agarose [16]. By comparing the rinse solutions
and scraping, as well as to a no-rinse control (plucking tentacles with tweezers), we aimed to evaluate
the relative efficacy of these removal methods. We further sought to quantify the effect of scraping on
venom delivery when preceded by vinegar dousing or followed by the application of heat.
In addition, we tested two scraping aids—a baking soda “slurry” and shaving cream—as well
as dilutions of vinegar on cnidae discharge inhibition using the TSA. The effects of a baking soda
“slurry” in the TSA has only been examined in two species of cubozoan: Carybdea rastoni, where it was
reported to inhibit chemically induced discharge [18], and Morbakka, where it did not induce discharge
but failed to inhibit it [47]. However, the details of the makeup of the baking soda solutions were not
reported, and since vinegar also inhibited discharge, the authors recommended it preferentially in
both cases. We could find no clinical studies evaluating baking soda for cubozoan stings. Shaving
cream has never been evaluated for its effects on cnidae or its clinical effects, and yet it is commonly
recommended in conjunction with scraping [38]. Specifically, our aim was to examine whether baking
soda slurries or shaving cream inhibited pressure-induced cnidae discharge, as scraping or rubbing
would elicit mechanical discharge rather than chemical discharge of cnidae, as well as whether diluted
vinegar was capable of the same irreversible inhibition of discharge as undiluted vinegar.

2. Results
2.1. Effect of Scraping on Cnidae Removal and Discharge on Isolated Skin
To determine if scraping effectively removes cnidae or causes further cnidae discharge, we applied
live A. alata tentacles to a skin model made from porcine intestine (a part of the “TSBAA” (tentacle skin
blood agarose assay) model outlined in [16]) and either pulled or scraped the tentacles off after a
10 min sting. The skin was then examined microscopically to determine the number of adherent
cnidae per unit area and whether they were discharged or undischarged (Figure 1). About half as
many cnidae—263 ± 19 versus 505 ± 39—remained on the skin after scraping as opposed to pulling
the tentacles off with tweezers (two-tailed t-test t(4) = 5.559, p = 0.005). However, the percentage of
cnidae that were discharged was significantly higher when the tentacles were scraped (85.1% ± 2.6%
compared to 27.9% ± 1.3%; two-tailed t-test t(4) = 19.67, p < 0.001), which resulted in more discharged
cnidae per unit area (211 ± 9 per mm2 for scraped versus only 96 ± 40 per mm2 for pulled, two-tailed
t-test t(4) = 2.81, p = 0.048).

half as many cnidae—263 ± 19 versus 505 ± 39—remained on the skin after scraping as opposed to 
pulling the tentacles off with tweezers (two‐tailed t‐test t(4) = 5.559, p = 0.005). However, the 
percentage of cnidae that were discharged was significantly higher when the tentacles were scraped 
(85.1% ± 2.6% compared to 27.9% ± 1.3%; two‐tailed t‐test t(4) = 19.67, p < 0.001), which resulted in 
more discharged cnidae per unit area (211 ± 9 per mm2 for scraped versus only 96 ± 40 per mm2 for 
pulled, two‐tailed t‐test t(4) = 2.81, p = 0.048).

with tweezers and (b) scraping with a credit card (n = 3 replicate tentacle sections for each removal 
method; cnidae counts from 3 images per tentacle were averaged). Scraped areas had fewer total 
cnidae (263 ± 19 per mm2 versus 505 ± 39 per mm2), but more of them were discharged (85.1% ± 2.6% 
versus 27.9% ± 1.3%), leading to nearly double the number of discharged cnidae per mm2 of skin (211 
± 9 per mm2 versus 96 ± 40 per mm2). Scale bars shown represent 100m. 
2.2. Effect of Adherent Tentacle Removal by Scraping 
Removal of adherent tentacles is one of the most important steps in first‐aid management of 
cnidarian stings. With that in mind, we sought to compare removal by scraping or pulling off with 
tweezers to other commonly used or previously recommended solutions for rinsing off tentacles. We 
set up a previously described TSBAA (see Methods, below) [16], with the modification that instead 
of simply removing tentacles by pulling them off, stinging tentacles were either sprayed off or 
scraped off. Tentacles pulled off with tweezers were used as a baseline. 
The removal method had a significant impact on the size of the hemolytic zone for stings from 
both A. alata and C. fleckeri at both single time points (one‐way ANOVAs, p < 0.0001) and over a time 
course (two‐way ANOVAs, p < 0.001 for removal method). For A. alata, scraping was significantly 
worse than all other removal methods at all time points (post hoc Fisher’s least significant difference 
(LSD), p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Rinsing with ethanol was not effective at removing the tentacles; 
rather than being rinsed away, massive cnidae discharge occurred and the tentacles became even 
more adherent and had to be manually pulled off. 
Figure 1. Comparison of cnidae remaining on model skin after removing the tentacle by (a) pulling
with tweezers and (b) scraping with a credit card (n = 3 replicate tentacle sections for each removal
method; cnidae counts from 3 images per tentacle were averaged). Scraped areas had fewer total
cnidae (263 ± 19 per mm2 versus 505 ± 39 per mm2), but more of them were discharged (85.1% ± 2.6%
versus 27.9% ± 1.3%), leading to nearly double the number of discharged cnidae per mm2 of skin
(211 ± 9 per mm2 versus 96 ± 40 per mm2). Scale bars shown represent 100 µm.

Removal of adherent tentacles is one of the most important steps in first-aid management of
cnidarian stings. With that in mind, we sought to compare removal by scraping or pulling off with
tweezers to other commonly used or previously recommended solutions for rinsing off tentacles.
We set up a previously described TSBAA (see Methods, below) [16], with the modification that instead
of simply removing tentacles by pulling them off, stinging tentacles were either sprayed off or scraped
off. Tentacles pulled off with tweezers were used as a baseline.

both A. alata and C. fleckeri at both single time points (one-way ANOVAs, p < 0.0001) and over a time
course (two-way ANOVAs, p < 0.001 for removal method). For A. alata, scraping was significantly
worse than all other removal methods at all time points (post hoc Fisher’s least significant difference
(LSD), p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Rinsing with ethanol was not effective at removing the tentacles;

rather than being rinsed away, massive cnidae discharge occurred and the tentacles became even more
adherent and had to be manually pulled off.
Removal methods tended to have similar patterns of effects for C. fleckeri (Figure 2), however,
tentacle removal was markedly more difficult for the chirodropid. Seawater and vinegar failed to rinse
away adherent tentacles, which instead had to be plucked off after rinse attempts failed. Only Sting
No More® Spray effectively lifted adherent tentacles so they could be rinsed away.
In both species, contrary to the prevailing belief in the field, rinsing with seawater was not
innocuous. Liberal seawater rinsing dispersed the intact cnidae over an area beyond the original
tentacle contact site and resulted in subsequent discharge with hemolysis (Figure 2). Examination
of agarose sting patterns revealed that seawater allowed tentacles and cnidae to maintain stinging
capacity and that, during attempts at removal, this allowed for additional stinging away from the initial
contact site (Figure 3). Thus, TSBAA observations for seawater are divergent from the “inert” results
found by TSAs, thus demonstrating that TSA results are not predictive of results in functional assays.
We also investigated the effect of temperature treatment on venom activity. Again, scraping had a
significant deleterious impact in that larger areas of lysis were observed when scraping was followed
by exposure to normal body temperature (37 ◦C) treatment (Figure 4, black dashed versus solid lines).
However, nearly all of this functional metric of venom activity could be abolished if tentacle removal
was immediately followed by 20 min of 45 ◦C hot pack application (Figure 4, red lines). In contrast
to the potent inhibitory effect of hot pack application, cold packs (10 ◦C), often recommended for
pain from cnidarian stings, were statistically indistinguishable from treatments of the same removal
methods exposed to normal body temperatures (Figure 4, light blue lines compared to black lines),
and therefore did not counteract the negative effects of scraping. Ice packs severely exacerbated A. alata
stings, more than doubling the hemolytic area size after 18 h (Figure 4, dark blue lines). This was less
evident in assays of C. fleckeri tentacles, which, due to the extreme bioactivity of the venom, led to
almost complete lysis under the area of the tentacle even in the room temperature-incubated plates.

0.0001), the interaction between time and treatment for 10.76% (p < 0.0001), and individual variation 
for 9.257% (p < 0.0001). Scraping led to increases in hemolytic zone size when compared to pulling off 
the tentacle with tweezers, however, the most dramatic increases in lysis were caused by ice‐pack 
treatment, which more than doubled the lytic zone size at 18 h, even in the absence of scraping. The 
use of hot packs significantly reduced the resultant size of the hemolytic zone after 18 h, regardless of 
whether tentacles were removed by scraping (p = 0.0167) or pulling (p = 0.016), while no significant 
differences were found between cold and room‐temperature treatments of the same removal method. 
Interestingly, while the efficacy of heat was also seen with C. fleckeri (B, red line), the exacerbation 
with ice was not (B, blue line). 
We further sought to determine whether vinegar dousing (without tentacle removal; seawater 
used as a solution control) has a significant impact on the amount of venom delivered if tentacles are 
then scraped off. Without vinegar dousing, scraping caused a massive increase in the functional 
metric of discharged venom, measured by an increased area of red blood cell lysis, of more than 3 
times the size of the vinegar‐rinsed samples. Increasingly significant differences between treatments 
were observed as the time course progressed (two‐way repeated measures ANOVA, p < 0.0001; 
Figure 5). Vinegar‐treated tentacles exhibited almost no blood agarose hemolysis (the metric of 
venom injection), and scraping did not lead to an increased hemolytic area if tentacles were first 
doused with vinegar for a period of 30 s.

2.3. Preliminary Investigation of Other Tentacle and Shed Cnidae Removal Aids 
As shaving cream and baking soda are often recommended to aid in scraping, we also evaluated 
whether they inhibit or induce cnidae discharge in A. alata tentacles using the TSA. In addition, we 
examined dilutions of vinegar to determine if diluted vinegar is able to prevent cnidae discharge to 
the same extent as full‐strength vinegar. Significant differences were found between the tested 
solutions (two‐way ANOVA p < 0.0001). Concurrent with previous studies [16,17], 100% vinegar 
irreversibly inhibited cnidae discharge, even when pressure was applied to the tentacle (Table 1). 
However, as that vinegar was diluted with seawater, it lost its ability to prevent discharge. Shaving 
cream and baking soda slurries induced significant discharge and failed to prevent cnidae discharge 
from pressure.

3. Discussion
Effective and safe removal of adherent tentacles and the microscopic, intact, shed cnidae left
on skin after tentacle contact are of paramount importance in the management of life-threatening
cubozoan stings. In this study, scraping tentacles with a credit card was inefficient at removing cnidae,
causing an increase in discharge while failing to remove many adherent cnidae (Figure 1). Scraping also
caused increases in venom load, as evidenced by larger hemolytic zones in blood agarose (Figures 2–5).
These data suggest that tentacle removal by scraping has the potential of causing immense harm, and
thus should no longer be recommended.
The data in this study indicated that tentacle removal by scraping can have a significant impact
on sting severity. There are three possible ways that scraping could increase the amount of venom
injected: (1) scraping could cause the tentacle to drag or roll, exposing a greater number of cnidae
to the skin so they can sting; (2) scraping could apply pressure to tentacle cnidae and shed cnidae,
inducing discharge; or (3) pressure from scraping could cause already-discharged cnidae to exude
more venom, as has been speculated [41]. The first two were observed experimentally in this study but
are difficult to discern in actual stings, as both would appear as an increase in discharged cnidae on the
skin surface. In either case, we would expect that the application of a solution which inhibits cnidae
discharge to prevent scraping-induced venom injection. In vitro studies in the past have strongly
supported the use of vinegar (dousing the area for at least 30 s) prior to any removal attempts because
it inhibits cnidae discharge [17,18], and case series have also supported its use [48]; our results concur
with these findings, as vinegar not only prevented cnidae discharge in vitro (Table 1), dousing tentacles
with it prior to removal significantly reduced the amount of venom delivered in our blood agarose
model (Figure 5). Some have suggested that the addition of vinegar increases the venom exuded
from already-discharged cnidae [49]. We found no evidence for this in our data. If the application
of vinegar caused an increase in venom deposition from already-discharged cnidae, then we would
have expected an increased zone of hemolysis after its application. Instead, the opposite occurred.
Thus, we conclude that there is no evidence that vinegar application induces further venom release
from discharged cnidae, and that vinegar should be considered a safe rinse solution for cubozoan
stings. We also found that dilutions of vinegar progressively led to a reduction in the ability to prevent
cnidae discharge (Table 1), thus vinegar should not be diluted prior to its use.
Most peer-reviewed and medical texts make it clear that scraping or tentacle removal should occur
after inactivation of cnidae (specifically recommending vinegar in most cases) [20–28]; however, in the
modern world of smartphones and social media, the general public does not turn to peer-reviewed
journal articles or medical textbooks for information, especially in the heat of the moment during a
painful event like a sting. Lay articles are less careful with their recommendations; some of the top
Google search results for “What to do if stung by a jellyfish” do not specify proper inhibition of cnidae
discharge prior to tentacle removal, including well-known and trusted sites. For example, WebMD says
that after removing a victim from the water, you should “Wash the area with seawater to deactivate
stinging cells. Or you can remove tentacles by scraping with a credit card or other plastic object” [29].
It should be noted that there is no evidence that seawater rinse can “deactivate stinging cells” and, to
the contrary, this effort only serves to spread intact cnidae onto surrounding skin. Only after this advice
is vinegar dousing mentioned. Similarly, the Mayo Clinic says to “remove stingers” by rinsing with
seawater or “gently scraping off the stingers with the edge of an ID card or a credit card”, and then,
after stinger removal, suggests vinegar rinsing [31]. Moreover, a visually appealing infographic [35]
that was widely shared and has tens of thousands of views [36] depicts rinsing with seawater, scraping,
and then applying vinegar. If a victim or someone helping them acted as these sites advise, they
would likely worsen the sting (sees Figure 2, black solid versus dotted lines) and in the case of severe
cubozoan envenomations, this unvalidated advice could actually cost lives. Some sources suggest
applying shaving cream or baking soda to the adherent tentacle(s) and scraping with a credit card or
razor blade if vinegar is unavailable or as an alternative to vinegar [37,38]. According to our results,
 Toxins 2017, 9, 105

the use of shaving cream and baking soda slurries should be considered suspect at best, as they do not
inhibit cnidae discharge and cause undischarged cnidae to fire (Table 1).
Exactly where the suggestion to scrape away tentacles and/or cnidae came from is unclear. It is
possible that it originated from co-opting the recommended first aid for removal of hymenopteran
stingers [50], mistakenly assuming it would be helpful in removing cnidae capsules and tubules.
In our study, scraping with a credit card with moderate force did not remove cnidae tubules already
penetrating into our skin substitute, and did not even completely remove undischarged cnidae on the
skin surface (Figure 1). Thus, we find it unlikely that scraping a sting site removes the penetrant foreign
material. Or, scraping may have emerged from early tentacle removal recommendations, which consist
of covering tentacles with dry, powdery substances, such as flour or even sand, to “coat” them before
the they are scraped away with a knife or stick [51] or rubbed off with a towel or cloth [52]. In these
early mentions, it was made clear that preventing further tentacle contact is paramount, as tentacle
manipulations could be injurious and dangerously counterproductive; for example, Barnes [51]
specifically states “ineffectual plucking and rubbing cause further discharge of nematocysts, greatly
aggravating the injury” (p. 325) and Cleland and Southcott [52] similarly note that “clearly any action
which will enhance the degree of contact of the tentacle with the skin is highly undesirable, as it
may cause further discharge of nematocysts”, noting that dry sand may be better than wet because
it “is more likely to fill the space between the tentacle and the skin, and when the tentacle is rolled
in attempts to remove it, a better protective layer would exist between it and the skin” (p. 167). It is
possible that there is a substance that could be applied similarly to these which would work to separate
the tentacle from the skin or prevent tentacle rolling, thus making scraping less dangerous, but the
data in this study indicate that shaving cream and baking soda are not ideal for this because of their
induction of cnidae discharge and failure to inhibit pressure-induced discharge.
Tentacle removal methods outside of scraping also impacted sting severity. As compared with
removal with tweezers, tentacle removal by rinsing with seawater significantly increased the hemolytic
zone size (a functional metric of increased venom load) in both species tested, while rinsing with
ethanol modestly increased venom load in A. alata (Figure 2). Increased hemolytic zone size after
tentacle dousing with ethanol would be consistent with solution-based studies, which have shown
that the application of alcohols increases cnidae discharge (e.g., [16–18]). However, the increase in
hemolytic zone size after seawater rinse was unexpected, as seawater is generally considered a “safe”
rinse solution, as it does not cause cnidae discharge in in vitro studies (e.g., [16–18]). Upon examination
of the blood agarose slides, it was clear that seawater allowed tentacle pieces, shed cnidae, and intact
still fully active cnidae to be moved away from the initial site of contact, thus creating an opportunity
for stinging beyond the original tentacle skin contact zone (Figure 3). These results call into question
the use of “innocuous” or “do no harm” rinse solutions in the removal of adherent tentacles and
cnidae, as they may inadvertently permit additional stinging and thus lead to increases in venom
delivered into the victim. This somewhat counterintuitive finding also underscores the concept that
rinse solutions should be limited to solutions that actively inhibit cnidae discharge, rather than those
that are deemed “inert”.
While removal methods produced similar results in both species tested (Figure 2), there were
intriguing differences between the two, which may indicate species- or family-specific differences.
Chironex tentacles were more adherent, and could not be removed from our tissue models with seawater
or vinegar alone. Instead, tentacles had to be plucked with tweezers after attempted rinses. The only
solution which led to effective detachment of C. fleckeri tentacles was Sting No More® Spray, which
contains urea, magnesium sulfate, and copper gluconate in addition to vinegar. We hypothesize that in
addition to preventing further discharge due to the inclusion of vinegar, this weak acid with chaotropic
urea in Sting No More® Spray effectively dissolves glutinous substances released by cnidae or gland
cells; further investigation of the mechanism by which Sting No More® Spray releases adherent
tentacles is warranted.

The data in this study indicate that post-removal care can greatly impact sting severity. There
is much debate about whether heat is recommended in the treatment of cnidarian stings, although
the preponderance of evidence supports its use [14]. Our findings strongly support the use of heat,
as the application of hot packs was able to significantly reduce the activity of injected venom, to
the point of completely counteracting the negative effects of scraping for A. alata (Figure 4). Heat
application significantly reduced hemolytic area size for C. fleckeri stings, but not quite as effectively as
for A. alata stings, which may indicate differential thermal tolerances of the venom toxins from the two
species. Instead of alleviating the sting, the application of ice led to a dramatic increase in A. alata sting
severity, more than doubling the size of the hemolytic zone at 18 h, even in the absence of scraping
(Figure 5). Stings where tentacles were scraped off and then treated with ice for 20 min had hemolytic
zones more than 6.5 times as large as stings where tentacles were pulled off and not treated with any
temperature treatment. The application of cold packs (which only cooled to ~10 ◦C) did not have
this effect, and were statistically indistinguishable from untreated stings receiving the same removal
method. Ice pack treatment did not lead to statistically significant increases in the hemolytic zones of
C. fleckeri stings; however, we would caution that the lack of increased hemolysis reflected a limitation
of the sting model and conditions used. Because of the Chironex tentacle cnidae packing density and
venom potency, near-complete lysis of the 5 mm deep blood agar under the tentacle was seen even at
room temperature; therefore, it was not possible to discern increases in lysis. As a remote field site and
the seasonal availability of the animals limited our work with Chironex, we were unable to conduct
further experiments to more completely examine the effects of ice. To further examine distinctions
between temperature effects, we plan to explore shorter sting durations and even thicker blood agar
preparations. Future work on the effects of ice in chirodropid stings is essential, as there are reported
deaths where ice was used [43]. Even if ice truly does not severely exacerbate all cubozoan stings,
we would still caution that the use of ice is ineffective at best and disastrous at worst, and thus should
be no longer considered a viable treatment option for cubozoan stings, while hot packs or hot water
immersion should be universally applied in all cubozoan stings.
4. Conclusions
As the number of cnidae discharging in a cubozoan sting site represents a small fraction
of the packed cnidae along the tentacle surface [16], first-aid steps taken immediately after a
sting—particularly when tentacles and shed cnidae may be still adherent—can have dramatic effects
on venom load and thus clinical outcomes.
For the cubozoans tested, we found that common recommendations—including rinsing the area
with seawater, scraping away tentacles, and the application of ice packs—can severely exacerbate
venom-induced hemolysis, a metric of sting sequelae. Our results suggest that these practices be
immediately discontinued, and instead support rinsing with Sting No More® Spray, vinegar, or, if no
vinegar is available, that tentacles be removed by careful plucking. Tentacle removal is then best
followed by the application of 45 ◦C heat or 45 ◦C hot water immersion for 45 min.
While our results provide robust support for this revised set of recommendations, further
investigations are warranted. First, while it was clear that for both A. alata and C. fleckeri, ice packs were
not helpful in reducing venom activity, experimental constraints limited our ability to conclusively
determine whether ice packs could exacerbate Chironex stings. Thus, we caution against a benign
interpretation of the Chironex results. However, if the lack of severe exacerbation by ice in C. fleckeri is
validated by further study, then the divergence between the two species in their reaction to ice treatment
could represent family-level differences in venom composition or tentacle behavior, or could reflect
differences between species based on environmental factors (such as ambient seawater temperature).
Second, comparisons should also be made to the other major cnidarian classes, the Schyphozoa and
Hydrozoa. It is imperative to systematically compare removal methods and temperature effects to test
for species-specific, as well as geographic-specific, differences to inform on management of jellyfish
stings. Third, further work could also examine a greater diversity of recommended first-aid measures.

It would be particularly interesting to examine whether traditional knowledge may provide potentially
effective sting mitigation methods.
5. Materials and Methods
5.1. Chemicals
The chemicals used in all assays are as follows: freshwater (tap water), seawater (locally collected,
0.45 µm filtered), white vinegar (Bakers and Chefs CJ314, SAM’s West Inc., Bentonville,
AR, USA), shaving cream (Gillette Regular Foam, Proctor and Gamble, Boston, MA, USA), ethanol
(Pharmco-Aaper, Brookfield, CT, USA), Sting No More® Spray (Alatalab Solutions LLC, Honoulu,
HI, USA).
5.2. Animal Collections and Husbandry
Live C. fleckeri were collected by hand at Mapoon, Queensland, Australia (12◦0�59.68�� S
141◦54�15.83�� E) and kept in buckets with ample seawater until use in experiments (<2 days
post-collection). Live A. alata were collected by hand from Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, USA (21◦16�19.57�� N
157◦49�25.04�� W) during their monthly spawning aggregations, and kept in buckets with ample
seawater until use in experiments (<2 days post-collection).
5.3. Model Skin-Scraping Test
To replicate the circumstances of a natural sting, a sterile porcine intestine “skin” was placed on
Saran Wrap (cling film) and wrapped around the arm of a volunteer. Skin preparation is described in
detail in [16], but briefly: porcine intestines were cut into sheets and rinsed with 50 mM saline. Sheets
were sterilized using 5% hydrogen peroxide, 10% ethanol solution in 50 mM saline for several hours.
Sterile sheets were then rinsed with 110 mM saline, and sterile, warmed lanolin was worked into the
intestine to create a water-resistant barrier. Five-centimeter lengths of freshly cut tentacles were applied
to the skin and allowed to sting for 10 min. After the sting, tentacles were removed by either (a) pulling
them off with tweezers or (b) scraping them off with a credit card using moderate pressure, as felt
comfortable and natural to the volunteer. The skins were then examined using a dissecting microscope
at 10× magnification (Olympus model SZX16, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and images were
taken of three areas under the tentacle. Counts of discharged and undischarged cnidae were performed
in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
5.4. Tentacle Solution Assay (TSA)
To test for the induction of discharge by shaving cream, freshly cut tentacles from live specimens
(length ~1 cm; used <10 min after cutting) were placed on clean, dry microscope slides. The tentacle
was then covered in the test solution (100 µL) or shaving cream (~2 cm3). After 1 min of incubation,
the bulk of the test solution or cream was carefully removed and a cover slip was gently placed
over the tentacle. To test whether solutions or shaving cream inhibited pressure-induced discharge,
freshly cut tentacle pieces (length ~1 cm) were placed on clean, dry microscope slides and allowed to
incubate for 1 min in the test solution/cream. A cover slip was added, and then the slide-tentacle-slip
sandwich was pressed by hand for 30 s. All photos were taken after 10 min using an inverted
microscope at 10× magnification (Olympus model CKX41SF, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Counts of discharged and undischarged cnidae were performed in ImageJ (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
5.5. Blood Agarose Assays
Functional venom delivery and activity was determined using blood agarose envenomation
models [16]. Two variations of substrate were used: human blood agarose and sheep’s blood agar.
For the human blood agarose, live human red blood cells (RBCs) were collected from normal donors
 Toxins 2017, 9, 105
12 of 15
(approved protocol CHS#12561, University of Hawaii Committee on Human Studies) and suspended
in low melting point agarose to create an envenomation model in which venom activity is measured by
hemolysis. The agarose was comprised of 1% RBC and 1.5% Nusieve GTG Agarose (Lonza, Rockland,
ME, USA) in modified RPMI (“YRPMI”: 23.81 mM NaHCO3, Fisher; 102.67 mM NaCl, BDH; 5.37 mM
KCl, Fisher; 0.41 mM MgSO4·7H2O, Fisher; 25 mM HEPES, Fisher; 6.67 mM NaH2PO4, Fisher; 0.42 mM
Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, Fisher). For the sheep’s blood agar, standard 5 mm thick microbiology plates were
used (Remel™ Contact Blood Agar Plates, TSA w/5% Sheep Blood, Fisher).
Blood agarose lengths (75 mm × 25 mm × 2 mm) or squares (25 mm × 25 mm × 2 mm) were
placed on glass slides. Slides were placed in specialized holders whose height was equal to that of the
agarose so that the surface of the agarose could be scraped without destroying its integrity. Agarose
substrates were exposed to ~1.5 cm of freshly cut tentacle for 5 min (A. alata) or 2 min (C. fleckeri),
after which the tentacle was either removed using tweezers (no scrape control), scraping with a credit
card, or rinsed off using a test solution.
To evaluate the effects of scraping, two experimental setups were used; in both cases, treatments
were assigned at random using a random number generator, and the conductor was blinded as to the
treatment until after the application of tentacles. The first employed a sterile porcine intestine “skin”
over the blood agar/agarose (“TSBAA” [16]) to allow for the application of test solutions. Using this
set up, the comparison between scraping and rinsing was performed; tentacles were placed at one
end of the substrate for the sting duration (see above), and then tilted to a 75-degree angle for tentacle
removal. Tentacles were pulled off with tweezers, scraped off with a credit card, or rinsed using a test
solution (seawater, tap water, vinegar, Sting No More® Spray, or 95% ethanol). If the solution failed
to remove the tentacle after 30 s of application, then the tentacle was pulled off manually; a total of
6 replicates were conducted for each removal method. To study the effects of dousing with vinegar,
seawater or vinegar was applied to A. alata tentacles 2 min into the 5 min sting. Both scraping and the
solution used were tested using a fully factorial approach (n = 6 for all).
To evaluate the efficacy of post-sting temperature applications on venom activity, a similar model
without a skin (“TBAA” [16]) was used. One-time use cold packs (CVS Pharmacy Inc., Woonsocket,
RI, USA), ice packs (cubed or crushed ice in Ziploc bags), reusable hot packs (45–50 ◦C at the surface,
long lasting over 45 min; Emergency Zone LLC, Orem, UT, USA), or no treatment (left at ambient
room temperature) were applied for 20 min to scraped and not-scraped agar/agarose using a fully
factorial approach (n = 6 for all). For both experiments, controls without stinging activity were also
run, and replicates were incubated at 37 ◦C overnight with images taken at 1, 4, and 18 h.
Images were recorded using a dissecting microscope (Olympus model SZX16, Olympus
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) or a DSLR camera (Nikon D800, Nikon Inc., Melville, NY, USA). The area
of the zone of hemolysis was calculated using ImageJ. Briefly, scale was set using known object widths
and subsections (15 mm × 5 mm for squares, 50 mm × 20 mm for lengths, 65 mm × 18 mm for
plates) were taken for analysis to remove edge effects. Control slides and unstung areas were used
to determine the color threshold for >80% hemolysis, and the total area of the hemolytic zone was
taken directly from the “analyze particles” function. Hemolytic zone was evaluated as the area of the
subsection exhibiting >80% hemolysis. Outliers were defined using the median absolute deviation
(MAD) method detailed in [53], with the level of decision set conservatively at 3; any replicates which
were outliers at all time points were removed. All ANOVA analyses and post hoc multiple comparisons
were conducted in GraphPad Prism vers. 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
