Background
The ketogenic diet (KD), being high in fat and low in carbohydrates, has been suggested to reduce seizure frequency. It is currently
used mainly for children who continue to have seizures despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Recently, there has been interest in
less restrictive KDs including the modified Atkins diet (MAD) and the use of these diets has extended into adult practice.
Objectives
To review the evidence for efficacy and tolerability from randomised controlled trials regarding the effects of KD and similar diets.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group’s Specialized Register (30 March 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 30 March 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid, 30 March 2015),
ClinicalTrials.gov (30 March 2015) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP
, 30 March 2015). We
imposed no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies.
Selection criteria
Studies of KDs and similar diets for people with epilepsy.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied pre-defined criteria to extract data and assessed study quality.
Main results
We identified seven randomised controlled trials that generated eight publications.
All trials applied an intention-to-treat analysis with varied randomisation methods. The seven studies recruited 427 children and
adolescents and no adults. We could not conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of the studies.
Reported rates of seizure freedom reached as high as 55% in a 4 : 1 KD group after three months and reported rates of seizure reduction
reached as high as 85% in a 4 : 1 KD group after three months.
One trial found no significant difference between the fasting-onset and gradual-onset KD for rates of seizure freedom and reported a
greater rate of seizure reduction in the gradual-onset KD group.

Ketogenic diet and other dietary treatments for epilepsy (Review)

 Studies assessing the efficacy of the MAD reported seizure freedom rates of up to 10% and seizure reduction rates of up to 60%. One
study compared the MAD to a 4 : 1 KD, but did not report rates of seizure freedom or seizure reduction.
Adverse effects were fairly consistent across different dietary interventions. The most commonly reported adverse effects were gastroin-
testinal syndromes. It was common that adverse effects were the reason for participants dropping out of trials. Other reasons for drop-
out included lack of efficacy and non-acceptance of the diet.
Although there was some evidence for greater antiepileptic efficacy for a 4 : 1 KD over lower ratios, the 4 : 1 KD was consistently
associated with more adverse effects.
No studies assessed the effect of dietary interventions on quality of life, or cognitive or behavioural functioning.
Authors’ conclusions
The randomised controlled trials discussed in this review show promising results for the use of KDs in epilepsy. However, the limited
number of studies, small sample sizes and a sole paediatric population resulted in a poor overall quality of evidence.
There were adverse effects within all of the studies and for all KD variations, such as short-term gastrointestinal-related disturbances,
to longer-term cardiovascular complications. Attrition rates remained a problem with all KDs and across all studies, reasons for this
being lack of observed efficacy and dietary tolerance.
There was a lack of evidence to support the clinical use of KD in adults with epilepsy, therefore, further research would be of benefit.
Other more palatable but related diets, such as the MAD ketogenic diet, may have a similar effect on seizure control as classical KD
but this assumption requires more investigation. For people who have medically intractable epilepsy or people who are not suitable for
surgical intervention, a KD remains a valid option; however, further research is required.

Ketogenic and other dietary treatments for epilepsy
Background
Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures (fits) are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Most seizures can be
controlled by one or more antiepileptic medicines but seizures may not be helped by these medicines after a while (called drug-resistant
epilepsy). For people who have drug-resistant epilepsy a special diet (called a ketogenic diet) may be considered. Ketogenic diets are
high in fat and low in carbohydrate.
This review aimed to investigate the effect of a ketogenic diet on seizure control, cognition (e.g., learning, concentration and academic
performance in children; learning, concentration and memory in adults) and behaviour. We also investigated the side effects of the diet
and the number of participants who dropped out of the studies and the reasons for this.
Search date
This evidence is current to March 2015.
Study characteristics
We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more
treatment groups) of adults or children with epilepsy where a ketogenic diet was compared with other treatments. We found seven
randomised controlled trials, with 427 participants. The trials were between three and six months long.
Key results
The short-term side effects of ketogenic diets included diarrhoea, constipation and vomiting. In the long term, heart heath could be
affected.
All studies reported participants dropping out, due to lack of improvement in seizures and poor tolerance of the diet.
No studies reported upon the effect of ketogenic diets on cognition and behaviour.

 Recently, other, more agreeable, ketogenic diets, such as the modified Atkins ketogenic diet, found similar effects on seizure control as
those more restrictive ketogenic diets. However, more research is required.
Quality of the evidence
The studies included in this review were limited by small numbers of participants and they only included children; therefore, the quality
of the evidence was low.
There is little research at present into the use of these diets in adults, therefore, more research is required in this area.

Description of the condition
Epilepsy is a common treatable neurological condition with a
lifetime risk of 1% to 3% (Hauser 1990). It is characterised
by recurrent involuntary brain activity that manifests in seizures
(Chang 2003). Although the majority of people with epilepsy will
have a good response and become seizure free by treatment with
antiepileptic drugs (AED), approximately 30% of people with
epilepsy will continue to have seizures even when taking multi-
ple AEDs (Granata 2009). Uncontrolled seizures pose a signifi-
cant risk to quality of life (Lawn 2004; Schmidt 2002; Villeneuve
2004). In addition, uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures are likely
to be one of the strongest risk factors of sudden death in epilepsy
(Nilsson 1999). Therefore, it is important not to rely on phar-
macological interventions when treating refractory epilepsy and
further evidence for alternative interventions must be developed.
Description of the intervention
Diets have been used in an attempt to control epileptic seizures
throughout the centuries, indeed there is a biblical reference to
prayer and fasting in epilepsy (St Mark 9: 14-29). Scientific as-
sessment of dietary manipulation reported in Guelpa 1911, and
subsequently in Geyelin 1921, confirmed that seizures may cease
on absolute fasting, but neither study was a randomised controlled
trial (RCT). Wilder 1921 suggested that a diet high in fat and low
in carbohydrates would be similar to fasting. The classical keto-
genic diet (KD) uses a 4 : 1 ratio of total energy from fat to carbo-
hydrate and protein. The KD has been described as unpalatable
and difficult to tolerate, thus leading to poor compliance. There-
fore, several diets have been investigated to improve palatability.
The Atkins diet was initially used for weight reduction. It offers
approximately a 1 : 1 ratio of energy from fat to carbohydrate and
protein, through restricting carbohydrate to 10 g to 20 g per day
(Atkins 1972), and is considered less restrictive.
Prior to the introduction of anticonvulsant medications (Merritt
1938), the KD was used in children (and adults) who were more
representative of the current general population of people with
epilepsy. However, case series published since the mid-1980s have
generally included people with multiple seizure types refractory
to multiple AEDs. The classic KD and other more palatable ver-
sions have a positive effect on infantile spasms, severe myoclonic
epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis complex (Kossoff 2005), and children
with refractory status epilepticus (O’Connor 2014).
How the intervention might work
Although the anticonvulsant effects of the KD remain unclear, nu-
merous biochemical theories have been suggested for the possible
action of the diet. One theory suggests that the anticonvulsant ef-
fect of ketone bodies (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate), ketone
reduction of alanine efflux, charge of water and electrolyte imbal-
ance (Schwartz 1989), results in changes occurring either in nerve
cell lipid membranes or neurotransmitter production (Schwartz
1989; Schwartzkroin 1999).
Why it is important to do this review
Despite the use of the KD and other dietary treatments for adults
and children with refractory epilepsy within clinical settings, the
number of high-quality RCTs has been limited in recent years.
Therefore, the evidence base for this intervention has been un-
clear. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of KDs and other
dietary interventions when considering RCTs.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All RCTs or quasi-RCTs (using adequate methods of allocation
concealment) of KD and other dietary interventions for people
with epilepsy.
Types of participants
Adults and children with a diagnosis of epilepsy irrespective of
their seizure type or epilepsy syndrome.
Types of interventions
Ketogenic diet group (related diet)
• Any diet that is designed to produce ketones. There are
several KDs that have been used depending upon the proportion
of the different types of lipids. The two main types of diet are
classical and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT); we also
considered the modified Atkins diet (MAD).

 Control group
• Placebo/sham diet given as a control treatment that is
thought to have no effect on epilepsy.
• Any treatment with known antiepileptic properties.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Seizure freedom (100% reduction in seizure frequency).
• Seizure reduction (50% or greater reduction in seizure
frequency).
• Adverse effects.
Secondary outcomes
• Cognitive and behaviour outcomes as measured by
validated rating scales.
• Quality of life as measured by validated rating scales.
• Attrition rate.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
For the most recent update of this review we searched:
• the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (30
March 2015) using the search strategy outlined in Appendix 1;
• the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online
(CRSO, 30 March 2015) using the search strategy outlined in
Appendix 2;
• MEDLINE (Ovid, 30 March 2015) using the search
strategy outlined in Appendix 3;
• ClinicalTrials.gov (30 March 2015) using the search terms:
epilepsy AND diet;
• the World Health Organization (WHO) International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP
, 30 March 2015) using
the search terms: epilepsy AND diet.
We searched EMBASE from 1980 to March 2003. We no longer
have access to that database. However, RCTs and quasi-RCTs in
EMBASE are included in CENTRAL. Therefore, these records
are available to us via our searches of CENTRAL.
Searching other resources
We searched references from previous versions of this review (back-
ward referencing) and newer references from more up to date stud-
ies.
We contacted experts in the area to enquire about other relevant
studies.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected all potential RCTs for
eligibility according to criteria specified with data extracted from
each publication. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.
In addition to the main outcome measures listed above, for each
study, we collected the following data using a pre-standardised
data extraction form.
• Participant characteristics including age, sex, number of
participants (randomised to each group).
• Diet intervention (classical, MCT, MAD or other).
• Length of follow-up.
• Epilepsy seizure type.
• Reason for commencement.
• Adverse effects.
• Reason for drop-out including compliance.
We conducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis where possi-
ble, including all allocated participants in the treatment groups
to which they were allocated, irrespective of the treatment they
received. Where necessary, we contacted original trial authors for
additional data or clarification. We stratified results according to
method of allocation concealment.
We assessed clinical heterogeneity by investigating the distribution
of important prognostic factors between trials and assessed statis-
tical heterogeneity using a Chi2 test (P value < 0.05). Provided
we found no heterogeneity, we planned summary estimates across
trials. Our preferred estimator was risk ratio with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method us-
ing both fixed-effect and random-effects models.
For behaviour, quality of life and cognitive outcomes, it was un-
likely that individual authors would have addressed this in a uni-
form manner. In the first instance, we planned to summarise the
results using text and tables.
Selection of studies
Two review authors (CJ, KM) independently reviewed the titles
and abstract of the studies identified by the electronic searches and
removed studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria. The same
two authors reviewed the full-text reports to determine eligibility.
We resolved any disagreements by discussion. In the event of there
being multiple reports deriving from one study, we linked the
reports together. We produced a final list of studies to be included
in the review.
Data extraction and management
In addition to the main outcome measures listed in Primary
outcomes; Secondary outcomes, two review authors (CJ, KM)
completed data extraction for each study. We cross-checked results
of the data extraction and resolved any disagreements by discus-
sion.

 We collected the following data using a pre-standardised data ex-
traction form.
• Participant characteristics including age, sex and number of
participants (randomised to each group).
• Diet intervention (classical or MCT or other).
• Length of follow-up.
• Epilepsy seizure type.
• Reason for commencement.
• Adverse effects.
• Reason for drop-out including compliance.
We conducted an ITT analysis where possible, including all al-
located participants in the treatment groups to which they were
allocated, irrespective of the treatment they received. Where nec-
essary, we contacted original trial authors for additional data or
clarification.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (CJ, KM) independently assessed the risk of
bias and compared the results from these assessments to identify
any inconsistencies. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.
We assessed all domains of the current Cochrane tool for assessing
risk of bias (Higgins 2011). We presented an overall summary
judgement of risk of bias for each outcome per study and made an
overall risk of bias assessment for each outcome across all studies.
Where possible, we planned to incorporate the risk of bias judge-
ment into the analysis using sensitivity analysis. This analysis of
the data would have included only studies rated as low risk of
bias. We created a ’Summary of findings’ table for outcomes, and
graded each outcome using the GRADE (Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach
(Guyatt 2008).
Measures of treatment effect
Where possible, we presented outcomes as RRs with 95% CI and
reported secondary outcomes narratively.
Unit of analysis issues
In the event of unit of analysis issues being identified across studies
(e.g. cross-over, cluster randomised or repeated measures studies),
we planned to:
• determine whether the methods in such studies were
conducted appropriately;
• combine extracted effect sizes from such studies through a
generic inverse variance meta-analysis.
Dealing with missing data
In the event of missing data, we planned to contact study authors
for the data or to determine if data were missing at random or not.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Two review authors assessed clinical and methodological hetero-
geneity by investigating the distribution of important prognostic
factors between trials and the study design. We assessed statistical
heterogeneity using a Chi2 test (P value < 0.05) and an I2 statistic
of greater than 50% to indicate statistical heterogeneity in accor-
dance with Cochrane guidelines (Higgins 2011).
Provided we found no heterogeneity, we planned summary esti-
mates across trials. Our preferred estimator was RRs with 95% CIs
calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method using both fixed-
effect and random-effects models.
Assessment of reporting biases
We investigated outcome reporting bias using the ORBIT matrix
system (Kirkham 2010). We requested all protocols from study
authors to compare outcomes of interest.
To examine publication bias, We identified any unpublished data
by carrying out a comprehensive search of multiple sources and
requesting unpublished data from study authors. We planned to
examine funnel plots in the event of there being 10 or more stud-
ies that could be combined, in accordance with Cochrane recom-
mendations (Higgins 2011).
Data synthesis
Ideally, we would have presented the data in a fixed-effect meta-
analysis; however, as we expected some heterogeneity across the
studies, we carried out a random-effects meta-analysis.
We planned to present seizure freedom, seizure reduction by 50%
and adverse effects as RRs with 95% CIs.
Due to significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity,
meta-analysis was not possible and, therefore, we reported the out-
comes narratively.
We planned to carry out the following comparisons:
• KD compared with a control;
• KD compared with other dietary interventions;
• KD compared with other interventions;
• other dietary interventions compared with a control;
• other dietary interventions compared with other
interventions.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned to stratify comparisons by control group, participant
group, study characteristics, or a combination of these to ensure
appropriate combination of study data.
Sensitivity analysis
We intended to carry out sensitivity analysis if we found peculiar-
ities between study quality. We planned to report and compare
analyses for all studies only of studies at low risk of bias.

Description of studies
Results of the search
Previous versions of this review identified four RCTs (Bergqvist
2005; Kossoff 2007; Neal 2008; Seo 2007).
The search strategies were updated and, therefore, there were no
date restrictions placed on the updated searches.
The updated search revealed 230 studies from the databases out-
lined in Electronic searches and three additional studies through
other sources. After removing duplicates, 156 studies remained.
Initial screening removed 143 irrelevant studies leaving 13 studies.
The remaining studies underwent full-text review after which we
excluded a further four studies (Freeman 1999; Freeman 2009;
Hemingway 2001; Smith 2011), identified two studies as ongoing
(Hulshof 2014; Yoon 2014), and deemed seven studies eligible
for inclusion in the present review update. Four of the identified
studies were included in previous versions of this review (Bergqvist
2005; Kossoff 2007; Neal 2008; Seo 2007), therefore we included
three new RCTs in this update (El-Rashidy 2013; Raju 2011;
Sharma 2013).
Figure 1 shows the search results from the present update.

 Included studies
Bergqvist 2005 (USA)
Bergqvist 2005 was a prospective, randomised, single-centre study
of 48 participants aged one to 14 years (mean 5.3, standard devi-
ation (SD) 2.7) comparing fasting and gradual-onset KD over a
three-month period. Participants were recruited from The Chil-
dren’s Hospital of Philadelphia and randomised into two groups of
equal numbers using permuted blocks of random size. Participants
were stratified by age, one to two years and two to 14 years to aid
equal allocation. Baseline data of seizure activity was collected 28
days prior to diet initiation. There was no significant difference in
participant demographics between the groups. Inclusion criteria
applied were children aged one to 14 years, having one or more
seizures per 28 days, tried at least three antiepileptic medications
and a discontinuation of steroidal medication three months pre-
vious. Exclusion criteria applied to children with metabolic disor-
ders, genetic disorders and known or suspected neurodegenerative
disorders. Forty-two percent of children included in the study had
cerebral palsy. The study aimed to compare the efficacy of fasting
KD to gradual initiation KD. Primary outcome was seizure reduc-
tion and secondary outcomes were ketosis and adverse effects.
El-Rashidy 2013 (Egypt)
El-Rashidy 2013 was a single-centre RCT of 40 participants aged
12 to 36 months (mean 27.13, SD 6.63) to compare two different
dietary interventions and a control group. Participants were re-
cruited from the Paediatric Neurology Outpatient Clinic at Chil-
dren’s Hospital Ain Shams University and were randomised into
one of three groups; MAD (15 children), classic ketogenic (4 :
1) liquid diet (10 children) and a control (polytherapy) (15 chil-
dren). There was no significant difference in age or gender across
the groups. The trial excluded children under the age of one year
diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy or with other systemic chronic
conditions. Two children in the classic group had infantile spasms
and one child in the classic group had myoclonic encephalopathy.
Aims of the study were to assess efficacy and tolerability. Out-
comes reported were changes in seizure frequency at three and six
months, adverse effects and attrition rates.
Kossoff 2007 (USA)
Kossoff 2007 was a prospective, randomised, cross-over controlled
trial of 20 participants aged three to 18 years comparing daily car-
bohydrate limits of 10 g and 20 g, using MAD. Participants were
recruited from the John Hopkins Hospital outpatient paediatric
epilepsy clinic and randomised into two groups, 10 g carbohydrate
MAD (10 children) or 20 g carbohydrate MAD (10 children),
which was followed for a three-month period. After this time,
participants were crossed over into the other group and followed
for a further three months. A return to the previous carbohydrate
amount was permitted after two weeks if parents deemed seizure
control to be worse. There was no significant difference in partic-
ipant demographics between the groups. Inclusion criteria were
aged three to 18 years, prior use of at least two anticonvulsants and
daily seizures. Epilepsy syndromes included were idiopathic (15
children), Rett syndrome (two children), cortical dysplasia (two
children) and tuberous sclerosis complex (one child). Exclusion
criteria included children with prior experience of the diet for more
than seven days, hypercholesterolaemia, kidney dysfunction, body
mass index less than 3% for age and children with heart disease.
The study aimed to investigate the ideal starting value of carbo-
hydrate in the MAD. Primary outcome was seizure control and
secondary outcomes were ketosis and tolerability.
Neal 2008 (UK)
Neal2008 wasaprospective, randomised, non-blinded, controlled
trial of 145 participants aged two to 16 years comparing KD (clas-
sic and MCT combined) to controls over a three-month period,
with a follow-on study that compared classic KD versus MCT KD
over a 12-month period. Most participants were recruited from
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, with a few partici-
pants seen in Central Middlesex Hospital and a residential centre
(National Centre for Young People with Epilepsy). Participants
were randomised, using a computer package, to commence a diet
(classic or MCT) after a four-week baseline or after baseline and
a further three months of seizure recording, with the latter group
acting as the control. The study used three defined age groups
to aid the randomisation between groups (two to six years, seven
to 11 years and 12 to 16 years). Participant demographics were
well matched between the groups. Inclusion criteria were children
aged two to 16 years, with daily seizures and more than seven
seizures per week, who had not responded to two or more AEDs
who had not previously been treated with a KD. Exclusion criteria
included hyperlipidaemia, renal stones or organic acid deficiency
syndromes. Fourteen participants had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
and 11 had West syndrome. The study aimed to investigate the
efficacy of the KD in comparison to a control and to compare
classic KD versus MCT KD for efficacy and tolerability at three,
six and 12 months. The primary outcome was efficacy, with the
secondary outcome of tolerability (assessed via a questionnaire at
three, six and 12 months).

 Raju 2011 (India)
Raju 2011 was a randomised, non-blinded, open-label, parallel
controlled trial of children aged six months to five years, with re-
fractory epilepsy comparing a 4 : 1 and a 2.5 : 1 ratio KD. Partic-
ipants were recruited from a single centre, paediatric department
of a tertiary care hospital in India. Participants were randomised
using a computer-generated random number table and conceal-
ment was undertaken using opaque envelopes. Thirty-eight par-
ticipants were recruited, 19 received a 4 : 1 ratio KD and 19 re-
ceived a 2.5 : 1 KD, with outcomes being assessed three months
after dietary initiation. There were no significant differences be-
tween participant demographics at baseline. Epilepsy syndromes
included were West syndrome (nine participants in 4 : 1 KD group
and seven participants in 2.5 : 1 KD group), Lennox-Gastaut syn-
drome (eight participants in 4 : 1 KD group and nine participants
in 2.5 : 1 KD group), Doose (no participants in 4 : 1 KD group
and two participants in 2.5 : 1 KD group) and unclassified syn-
dromes (two participants in 4 : 1 KD group and one participant in
2.5 : 1 KD group). Trial included participants with cerebral palsy
(15 participants in 4 : 1 KD group and nine participants in 2.5 :
1 KD group). Inclusion criteria were children aged six months to
five years, at least two seizures per months, despite appropriate use
of at least two AED and at least one newer AED. Exclusion criteria
were known or suspected inborn errors of metabolism, systemic
illness or surgical remediable causes of epilepsy. Aims of the study
were to compare the efficacy and tolerability of 2.5 : 1 KD versus 4
: 1 KD. Primary outcome was the proportion of participants with
more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency in both groups and
secondary outcome was adverse effects.
Seo 2007 (Korea)
Seo 2007 was a single-centre RCT of 76 children with intractable
childhood epilepsy aged four months to 16 years comparing 3
: 1 KD and 4 : 1 KD. Participants were recruited from a pae-
diatric epilepsy clinic in Severance Children’s Hospital and were
randomised into two groups, 4 : 1 KD group (40 participants)
and 3 : 1 KD group (36 participants) and the diet was followed
for three months. A baseline seizure frequency monitoring period
was completed two months prior to commencement of KD. After
a three-month period of the diet, children who were seizure free
in the 4 : 1 group were recommended to change to a 3 : 1 ratio,
and children who were not seizure free in the 3 : 1 group were
recommended to change to a 4 : 1 ratio and re-evaluated after a
further three months. There were no significant differences in par-
ticipant demographics between the groups. Epilepsy syndromes
included Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and study also included par-
ticipants with infantile spasm. Inclusion criteria were more than
four seizures per months and seizures were not controlled by at
least three AEDs. Exclusion criteria were children with metabolic
disorders or known or suspected neurological degenerative disor-
ders (or both). The study aimed to compare the antiepileptic effi-
cacy and diet tolerability of 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 KDs. Primary outcome
was a reduction in seizure activity from baseline and secondary
outcome was to assess tolerability.
Sharma 2013 (India)
Sharma 2013 was an open-label, parallel-group, RCT of children
aged two to 14 years with refractory epilepsy comparing the MAD
to a control group. This was conducted in a single, tertiary care
centre. Authors noted the study design to be similar to that of Neal
2008. Participants were randomised into an intervention (MAD)
or a control (normal diet) arm using computer-generated random
number tables. Concealment was carried out using opaque sealed
envelopes. There were 102 participants, 50 received MAD and 52
received a normal diet for a period of three months. There were no
significant differences in participant demographics across the two
groups. Epilepsy syndromes included Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
(25 participants in MAD group and 22 participants in control
group), West syndrome (nine participants in MAD group and
10 participants in control group) and myoclonic astatic epilepsy
(two participants in MAD group and three participants in con-
trol group). Other inclusion criteria were two to 14 daily seizures
and previous tried three AEDs. Exclusion criteria were known or
suspected inborn errors of metabolism, systemic illness or motiva-
tional issues of the family that would prelude compliance. Seizure
frequency was recorded for a four-week baseline period and re-
peated at the end of the three-month study period. Aim of the
study was to evaluate the efficacy of the MAD. Outcomes reported
were seizure frequency, tolerability and adverse effects.
Excluded studies
The present update excluded four studies at full-text review. Three
studies were not RCTs (Freeman 1999; Hemingway 2001; Smith
2011), and one study was successfully blinded after fasting (by
administration of saccharin or glucose) (Freeman 2009); however,
Freeman 2009 was only for 12 days and ketosis was not completely
eliminated in the glucose arm).
Risk of bias in included studies
There were seven RCTs that generated eight publications review-
ing the use of ketogenic and other diets appropriate for analysis of
bias. For further details please refer to Characteristics of included
studies table.
Allocation
Three studies used a computer-generated method of sequence
generation and allocation concealment (Neal 2008; Raju 2011;
Sharma 2013), and one study used a permuted block randomisa-
tion method (Bergqvist 2005). We rated these studies at low risk
of allocation bias.
15
Ketogenic diet and other dietary treatments for epilepsy (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The method of sequence generation and allocation concealment
was unclear in three studies (El-Rashidy 2013; Kossoff 2007; Seo
2007).
Blinding
We rated all studies at high risk of performance bias and detection
bias. This may be due to the design of such studies, in that blinding
participants and study personnel did not occur.
Incomplete outcome data
Two studies reported comparable drop-out rates across the groups
but did not complete an ITT analysis (Bergqvist 2005; Kossoff
2007). Three studies also reported comparable drop-out rates
across the groups and completed an ITT analysis (Raju 2011; Seo
2007; Sharma 2013). We rated these studies at low risk of attrition
bias.
One study reported a high level of participants in the control
group being lost to follow-up (Neal 2008), and one study reported
uneven drop-out rates across the groups and did not complete an
ITT analysis (El-Rashidy 2013). We rated these studies at high
risk of attrition bias.
Selective reporting
We contacted the authors of all included studies to request pro-
tocols. Two study authors provided the protocol for the included
studies and on reviewing the outcomes, there was no evidence to
suggest selective reporting for either study (Kossoff 2007; Neal
2008). Therefore, we rated these studies at low risk of bias. Proto-
cols for the remaining five studies were unavailable and we rated
these studies at unclear risk of selection bias (Bergqvist 2005;
El-Rashidy 2013; Raju 2011; Seo 2007; Sharma 2013).
Other potential sources of bias
One study reported that three participants in one of the inter-
vention group had other conditions; two had been diagnosed
with infantile spasms and one with myoclonic encephalopathy
(El-Rashidy 2013). One study reported a high level of co-morbid-
ity among all groups and although they were comparable within
this study, this may introduce bias when evaluating in a meta-anal-
ysis (Raju 2011). One study excluded children where motivational
issues within the family that may impact on compliance had been
identified (Sharma 2013). We rated these studies at high risk of
bias.
There were no other sources of bias identified in four studies (
Bergqvist 2005; Kossoff 2007; Neal 2008; Seo 2007).
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Ketogenic
diet or other dietary treatments for people with epilepsy
All outcomes are presented in Summary of findings for the main
comparison and are described in more detail below.
Seizure freedom (100% reduction in seizure
frequency)
Raju 2011 reported 26% (5/19) of participants following a 4 : 1
KD and 21% (4/19) of participants following a 2.5 : 1 KD to be
seizure free at three months. Seo 2007 found a greater response rate
to both ratios of the KD, reporting 55% (22/40) of participants
to be seizure free after following a 4 : 1 KD for three months
compared to 35% (11/36) of participants following a 3 : 1 KD.
Neal 2008 reported one participant to be seizure free after three
months of following a KD (classic and MCT). When comparing
a fasting-onset and a gradual-onset KD, Bergqvist 2005 stated
21% (5/24) of participants of both fasting-onset and gradual-
onset KD groups were seizure free at three months. For the MAD,
Kossoff 2007 reported 10% (2/20) of participants to be seizure
free by six months. However, the intervention group (10 g or 20
g carbohydrate per day via MAD) was not stated.
Seizure reduction (50% or greater reduction in
seizure frequency)
Raju 2011 found the number of participants with greater than
50% seizure reduction after three months to be 58% (11/19) in
the 4 : 1 KD group and 63% (12/19) in the 2.5 : 1 KD group;
however, there was no significant difference. Seo 2007 stated 85%
(34/40) of participants following a 4 : 1 KD and 72.2% (26/36) of
participants following a 3 : 1 KD to have greater than 50% seizure
reduction after three months. Neal 2008 reported 38% (28/73)
of participants had greater than 50% seizure reduction after three
months in the KD (classic and MCT) group compared to 6% (4/
72) of participants in the control group (P value < 0.0001). When
comparing fasting-onset and gradual-onset KD, Bergqvist 2005
found 58% (14/24) of participants in the fasting-onset KD and
67% (16/24) of participants in the gradual-onset KD group to
have greater than 50% seizure reduction at three months.
When investigating the effects of MAD on seizure reduction,
Sharma 2013 reported significantly higher results in the MAD
group (52%) to the control (11.5%, P value = 0.001), when com-
paringgreaterthan50%seizure reductionatthree months. Kossoff
2007 reported a significant difference (P value = 0.03) in seizure
reduction after three months, between 10 g carbohydrate MAD
and 20 g carbohydrate MAD, with 60% (6/10) of participants in
the 10 g carbohydrate/day group having greater than 50% seizure
reduction compared to 10% (1/10) of participants in the 20 g
carbohydrate/day group.
Seo 2007 reported that antiepileptic efficacy was significantly
16

 greater in the 4 : 1 KD group than the 3 : 1 KD group (P value
= 0.041), but it was unclear as to whether this referred to seizure
reduction, seizure freedom or both.
Adverse effects
All studies reported adverse effects of the dietary interventions.
For those studies investigating the classical KD , the main adverse
effects were gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, con-
stipation and diarrhoea (Bergqvist 2005; El-Rashidy 2013; Neal
2008; Raju 2011; Seo 2007). Seo 2007 found gastrointestinal
symptoms to be significantly worse in the 4 : 1 ratio compared
with the 3 : 1 ratio KD (P value = 0.038), while Neal 2008 re-
ported vomiting to significantly affect more participants in the
classical KD (45%) compared with the MCT KD group (13%, P
value < 0.05). Weight loss was reported upon by two KD studies
(Bergqvist 2005; Raju 2011). Raju 2011 found weight loss to af-
fect more participants (3/19) in the 4 : 1 ratio KD group than in
the 2.5 : 1 (1/19) ratio KD group. Bergqvist 2005 found gradual-
onset KD participants lost significantly less weight than the fast-
ing-onset KD group; -0.95 kg (95% CI -2.9 to 0.6) with fasting-
onset KD compared to -0.3 kg (95% CI -2.1 to 1.5) with gradual-
onset KD; P value = 0.006. Neal 2008 also reported statistical
significance with regards to a lack of energy at three months, af-
fecting 36% of participants in the classical KD group compared
to 14% of participants in the MCT group (P value < 0.05). Other
adverse effects reported by the studies in lower numbers were res-
piratory tract infection, infectious disease (pneumonia and sepsis),
acute pancreatitis, decreased bone matrix density, gallstones, fatty
liver, nephrocalcinosis, hypercholesterolaemia, status epilepticus,
acidosis, dehydration, tachycardia, extended hospital stay, hunger
and abdominal pain.
Adverse effects were also reported in the MAD trials (El-Rashidy
2013; Kossoff 2007; Sharma 2013). All three studies reported
constipation to affect the dietary intervention groups, with 20%
to 46% of participants affected. El-Rashidy 2013 reported con-
stipation to affect 15.4% of participants in the MAD group and
25% of participants in the classic group, but no significance was
reported. Sharma 2013 and El-Rashidy 2013 reported vomiting
to affect 10% of participants in the MAD group and 30% of par-
ticipants in the classic group. El-Rashidy 2013 also reported di-
arrhoea to affect more of the MAD participants than the classic
KD participants (15.4% in the MAD group, 12.5% in the clas-
sic group). Kossoff 2007 found no significant difference between
median weight change in the 10 g and 20 g carbohydrate MAD
groups in the first three months (P value = 0.44). Other adverse
effects were anorexia, lethargy, lower respiratory tract infections
and hyperammonaemic encephalopathy.
Cognitive and behaviour outcomes
We found no RCTs into the effects of a KD or similar diets on
psychosocial impact.
Quality of life
We found no RCTs into the effects of a KD or similar diets on
quality of life.
Attrition rate
All trials experienced drop-outs.
In the studies investigating classic KD, drop-outs ranged from
10% to 20% (Bergqvist 2005; El-Rashidy 2013; Neal 2008; Raju
2011; Seo 2007). Reasons for drop-out included lack of efficacy,
refusal to eat, non-acceptance of diet by other family members,
along with medical conditions including acute pancreatitis, viral
gastrointestinal illness, respiratory distress and increased seizure
activity.
In the studies investigating the MAD, drop-out rates were between
8% and 50% (El-Rashidy 2013; Kossoff 2007; Sharma 2013).
Reasons for drop-out reported by El-Rashidy 2013 and Sharma
2013 were non-acceptance of the diet and weight loss, along with
medical conditionsincludinglowerrespiratory tractinfections and
hyperammonaemic encephalopathy. Kossoff 2007 did not report
reasons for drop-outs; however, they found no significant differ-
ence between 10 g and 20 g carbohydrate MAD drop-out rates (P
value = 0.33).
For further details, refer to Summary of findings for the main
comparison.

Summary of main results
The present update identified three additional RCTs and, there-
fore, this review includes seven RCTs. All of the studies assessed the
efficacy of various dietary interventions for children with epilepsy.
The review presented some promising, although limited, evidence
for the use of KDs in epilepsy. Reported rates of seizure freedom
reached 55% in a 4 : 1 KD group after three months and reported
rates of seizure reduction reached 85% in a 4 : 1 KD group after
three months (Seo 2007).
Interestingly, Bergqvist 2005 found no significant difference be-
tween the fasting-onset and gradual-onset KD for rates of seizure
freedom and reported a greater rate of seizure reduction in the
gradual-onset KD group.
Studies assessing the efficacy of the MAD reported seizure freedom
rates of up to 10% and seizure reduction rates of up to 60%. One
study compared the MAD to a 4 : 1 KD, but did not report rates
of seizure freedom or seizure reduction (El-Rashidy 2013).
Adverse effects were fairly consistent across different dietary inter-
ventions. The most commonly reported adverse effects were gas-
trointestinal syndromes. It was common that adverse effects were

 the reason for participants dropping out of trials. Other reasons
for drop-out included lack of efficacy and non-acceptance of the
diet.
Although there was some evidence for greater antiepileptic efficacy
for a 4 : 1 KD over lower ratios, the 4 : 1 LD was consistently
associated with more adverse effects.
No studies assessed the effect of dietary interventions of quality of
life, cognitive or behavioural functioning.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The present review identified only seven RCTs with a total sample
size of 427 children with epilepsy. Due to the clinical, method-
ological heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not possible for this re-
view. This demonstrates the limitations of the evidence for dietary
interventions in people with epilepsy. Furthermore, there is a lack
of consensus regarding which dietary intervention is most effective
and appropriate. This highlights the need for further research in
this area to address these issues.
All of the included studies assessed the efficacy of dietary interven-
tions in children. However, the evidence for the use of dietary in-
terventions in adults with epilepsy appears to be anecdotal. There-
fore, further research is required to provide high-quality evidence
for the use of dietary interventions in adults, in addition to ex-
panding on evidence in paediatric populations.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence was low. This is due to the relatively
small sample size and high risk of bias in the included studies. In
addition, two of the included studies reported a high incidence of
co-morbidity (Bergqvist 2005; El-Rashidy 2013).
There was considerable heterogeneity across the included studies
in terms of the clinical populations, interventions and methodolo-
gies. Therefore, combined data from included studies was prob-
lematic and meta-analysis was not possible in this review. This is
a limitation of this study and impacts on the quality of evidence
presented.
For further details please refer to Summary of findings for the main
comparison.
Potential biases in the review process
Despite the thorough search strategies, we cannot be certain that
we identified and included all relevant data in this review. Should
further data be identified following publication of this review, it
will be incorporated into subsequent updates.
There was limited information about the included studies, in par-
ticular study protocols were unavailable for the majority of in-
cluded studies, therefore decisions within the risk of bias assess-
ment were often based on insufficient information, resulting in a
number of unclear risk of bias judgements.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
We found two prospective studies investigating the effect of KD
on epilepsy in an adult population (Kossoff 2008; Moesk 2009).
Kossoff 2008 investigated the effects of a MAD (30 participants),
while Moesk 2009 used a classic 4 : 1 KD (nine participants).
Drop-out rates varied between 30% and 77%, reportedly due feel-
ing of hunger, dietary restrictions and lack of efficacy. Moesk 2009
reported that both of the participants who completed the study
had greater than 50% seizure reduction by three months, while
Kossoff 2008 reported that 47% of participants had experienced
this level of seizure reduction. Both studies reported an increase
in cholesterol levels. The findings of Kossoff 2008 were similar to
those of the included RCTs discussed above, which may demon-
strate the ability for adults to achieve a similar level of seizure re-
duction as that of children. However, attrition rates experienced by
Moesk 2009 were considerably higher than the RCTs conducted
on children, which may suggest tolerability of a 4 : 1 KD or lack
of efficacy to be problematic in the adult population.
Further prospective studies with children reported similar levels of
seizure reduction to those of the included RCTs (Coppola 2002;
Hosain 2005). Hosain 2005 administered a KD via gastrostomy
tubes and reported compliance rates of 100% (12 children), likely
due to the method of delivery.
Retrospective studies found 58% (Kang 2005) and 35% (DiMario
2002) of children to have greater than 50% seizure reduction fol-
lowing six months of KD. However, given the time scale, direct
comparison of results are difficult. Adverse effects in both studies
were mild and self limited. Kang 2005 reported a 32% drop-out
rate, which is slightly greater than the included RCTs, reportedly
due to complications and dietary intolerances. However, four par-
ticipants were also reported to had died during the study, three due
to lipoid pneumonia and infectious illnesses that occurred within
three months of starting a KD.

Implications for practice
The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) discussed in this review
show promising results for the use of ketogenic diets (KD) in
epilepsy. However, the limited number of studies, small sample
sizes and a sole paediatric population result in a poor overall quality
of evidence.
All studies comparing all KD variations reported adverse effects,
from short-term gastrointestinal-related disturbances, to longer-

 term cardiovascular complications. The adverse effects associated
with the modified Atkins KDs may initially appear lower than the
classic KD, but we found no significant results.
Attrition rates remained a problem in all KDs and across all stud-
ies, reasons for this being lack of observed efficacy and dietary tol-
erance.
One study found no significant difference in seizure reduction
between gradual-onset and fasting-onset KD, which could prove
cost effective and time saving. However, further large-scale studies
are required.
There was a lack of evidence to support the clinical use of KD
in adults with epilepsy, therefore, further research would be of
benefit.
Other more palatable but related diets, such as the modified Atkins
KD, may have a similar effect on seizure control as classical KD
but this assumption requires more investigation.
For people who have medically intractable epilepsy or people who
are not suitable for surgical intervention, a KD remains a valid
option; however, further research is required.
Implications for research
Key areas for research identified by this review are as follows:
• studies should address quality of life issues and cognitive
changes using a validated scale;
• consistency in outcomes across RCTs would be beneficial to
research as a limitation of the present review was that meta-
analysis was not possible. It may be beneficial for future RCTs to
assess seizure frequency by means of seizure reduction (greater
than 50% reduction in seizures) and seizure freedom (100%
reduction in seizures);
• although shorter studies (e.g. six months) provide useful
evidence for the efficacy of dietary interventions, it may be useful
to assess the tolerability and adverse effects of such interventions
in long-term studies that follow participants for over 12 months
or preferably several years;
• studies of the mechanisms of action could help determine
which specific seizure types or syndromes respond better to the
diets;
• further studies should address other diets, particularly those
that are less restrictive (such as the modified Atkins);
• the present review highlighted a paucity of evidence for the
use of the KD in adults. Therefore, future studies should
investigate the use and potential adverse effects of KDs, in adults
with epilepsy;
• large-scale RCTs would be of benefit.

Methods
Single-centre randomised controlled trial, to compare 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 KD. Baseline period
lasted 2 months. After a 3-month period of the diet, participants who were seizure free
in the 4 : 1 group were recommended to change to a 3 : 1 ratio, and participants who
were not seizure free in the 3 : 1 group were recommended to change to a 4 : 1 ratio and
were re-evaluated after a further 3 months
Participants
76 children (aged 4 months to 16 years), with > 4 seizures/months and seizures were not
controlled by at least 3 AEDs. Study done in Korea. All seizure types included
Interventions
Participants were randomised into 2 groups, 4 : 1 KD group (40 participants) and 3 : 1
KD group (36 participants) and the diet was followed for 3 months
Outcomes
• Seizure reduction rate
• Tolerability
Notes
6 participants dropped out in both of the original groups. 2 of participants in the 3 : 1
group dropped out due to diet intolerance and 1 participant in the 4 : 1 KD group. 1
participant in the 3 : 1 group dropped out due to acute pancreatitis. Other reasons for

Methods
Single-centre randomised controlled trial to compare the 2 different dietary interventions
(MAD and classic KD in form of 4 : 1 liquid diet) and a control group (AED)
Participants
40 children aged 12-36 months (mean 27.13, SD 6.63) with symptomatic intractable
epilepsy. Study done in Egypt
Interventions
Participants were randomised into 1 of 3 groups; MAD (15 participants), KD (10 par-
ticipants) and control (15 participants). Data were collected at 3 and 6 months
Outcomes
• Seizure reduction rate
• Adverse effects
• Attrition rate
Notes
2 participants in the MAD group dropped out of the trial as they could not accept
the diet and experienced weight loss. From the results, it could be inferred that these
participants dropped out between the 3- and 6-month reviews. 2 participants from the
classic KD group dropped out due to intolerance; however, it was unclear when these
participants dropped out

2.5 : 1 KD (19 participants) and followed for 3 months
Outcomes
• > 50% reduction in seizure frequency
• Adverse effects
Notes
3 participants in each group dropped out of the study. Reasons for drop-out in 4 : 1 KD
group were refusal to eat, unsatisfactory seizure control and non-acceptance by other
family members. In 2.5 : 1 KD group, 2 participants dropped out due to unsatisfactory
seizure control and 1 due to refusal to eat
Exclusion criteria: known or suspected inborn errors of metabolism, systemic illness or
surgical remediable causes of epilepsy

 Sharma 2013
Methods
Open-label, single-centre, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial, to compare the
MAD to a control group over a 3-month period. Authors noted the study design to be
similar to that of Neal 2008. There was a 4-week baseline of seizure frequency
Participants
102 children aged 2-14 years with refractory epilepsy and 2-14 daily seizures, having
previously tried 3 AEDs. Study conducted in India
Interventions
Randomised into 1 of 2 groups; MAD (50 participants) or a normal diet (52 participants)
for a period of 3 months
Outcomes
• Seizure frequency
• Tolerability
• Adverse effects
Notes
4 children reported to have dropped out of the trial. 2 secondary to lower respiratory
tract infections, 1 secondary to hyperammonaemic encephalopathy and 1 as the child
and family found the diet too restrictive. In the control group, 3 participants were lost
to follow-up
Exclusion criteria: known or suspected inborn errors of metabolism, systemic illness or
motivational issues the family that would prelude compliance

Trial name or title
The |Modified Atkins Diet for Epilepsy: an RCT
Methods
A single-centre, parallel, unblinded randomised controlled trial
Participants
Aimed to recruit 54 people, aged > 18 years, adults with refractory epilepsy that was controlled by 2 AEDs.
Included participants must have had ≥ 2 seizures/month and have moderate-to-severe intellectual disability.
Potential participants were excluded if they had undergone epilepsy surgery in the last 6 months or were
awaiting surgery; underwent implantation of vagal nerve stimulation in the last 6 months; have used the
MAD or KD for > 7 days in the last year
Interventions
Intervention group treated with the MAD for at least 4 months, with a total follow-up of at least 6 months
Control group comprised a waiting list in which participants can begin the MAD diet after the 4-month trial
period, the control group can be started on the MAD as well, in which efficacy, tolerability and safety will
also be evaluated
Outcomes
Primary outcomes:
• Number of responders 4 months after randomisation, compared between the intervention and the
control group. Responder is defined by > 50% reduction in seizure frequency
Secondary outcomes:
• Retention of the diet; change in daily functioning; feasibility of the MAD in this population and
setting; adverse events attributable to the MAD; predictive factors of efficacy of the diet
