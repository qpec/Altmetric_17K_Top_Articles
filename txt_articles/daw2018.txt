 Association of the Affordable Care Act Dependent Coverage
Provision With Prenatal Care Use and Birth Outcomes
Jamie R. Daw, MSc; Benjamin D. Sommers, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE The effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) dependent coverage provision on
pregnancy-related health care and health outcomes is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether the dependent coverage provision was associated with
changes in payment for birth, prenatal care, and birth outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study, using a differences-in-
differences analysis of individual-level birth certificate data comparing live births among US
women aged 24 to 25 years (exposure group) and women aged 27 to 28 years (control group)
before (2009) and after (2011-2013) enactment of the dependent coverage provision.
Results were stratified by marital status.
MAIN EXPOSURES The dependent coverage provision of the ACA, which allowed young adults
to stay on their parent’
s health insurance until age 26 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were payment source for birth, early
prenatal care (first visit in first trimester), and adequate prenatal care (a first trimester visit
and 80% of expected visits). Secondary outcomes were cesarean delivery, premature birth,
low birth weight, and infant neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.
RESULTS The study population included 1 379 005 births among women aged 24 to 25 years
(exposure: 299 024 in 2009; 1 079 981 in 2011-2013), and 1 551 192 births among women aged
27 to 28 years (control: 325 564 in 2009; 1 225 628 in 2011-2013). From 2011-2013, compared
with 2009, private insurance payment for births increased in the exposure group vs the control
group; Medicaid payment and self-payment decreased. Early and adequate prenatal care
increased and preterm birth decreased. There were no significant changes in low birth weight,
NICU admission, or cesarean delivery. In stratified analyses, changes in payment for birth,
prenatal care, and preterm birth were concentrated among unmarried women.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study of nearly 3 million births among women aged 24
to 25 years vs those aged 27 to 28 years, the Affordable Care Act dependent coverage
provision was associated with increased private insurance payment for birth, increased use of
prenatal care, and modest reduction in preterm births, but was not associated with changes
in cesarean delivery rates, low birth weight, or NICU admission.

eginning in September 2010, the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) required private health insurers to allow young
adultstoremainonaparent’
splanuntiltheir26thbirth-
day.Nearlyone-thirdofUSbirthsaretowomenintheagerange
affected by the policy (age 19-25 years). Although studies have
found that this dependent coverage provision expanded in-
surance, increased preventive care, and improved self-
reported health among young adults, little attention has been
given to the effect of the provision on pregnant women.1-6 The
only study among pregnant women found that the policy was
associated with an increase in privately insured births and a
decrease in Medicaid-paid births, concentrated among un-
married women.7
Insurance changes among reproductive-age and preg-
nant women associated with the provision could lead to im-
provements in prenatal care use and birth outcomes (eFigure
in the Supplement). Compared with women who are insured
prior to pregnancy, uninsured women who become eligible
for pregnancy-related Medicaid may face delays accessing
prenatal care because of late pregnancy recognition, enroll-
ment barriers, and difficulty finding a clinician. Coverage be-
fore pregnancy is associated with earlier initiation of prenatal
care, which is associated with reduced adverse outcomes such
as prematurity and neonatal death.8-10 Expansion of cover-
age to reproductive-age women may also improve outcomes
by increasing access to care before conception, in turn poten-
tially improving chronic disease management, reducing to-
bacco use, increasing access to contraception, and improving
quality and continuity of care.
The objective of this study was to investigate whether the
dependent coverage provision’
s expansion of health insur-
ance was associated with changes in payment for birth, pre-
natal care, and birth outcomes among married and unmar-
ried women.
Methods
Data
We used individual-level data from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention public-use natality files, which con-
tain a census of US birth certificate data. We limited our
sample to states that had adopted the 2003 revised US Stan-
dard Certificate of Live Birth format in each year because this
format contains consistent outcome definitions and informa-
tion on payment for birth. Birth certificate data are entered
by the birth facility based on clinical records and maternal
surveys. During our study period, the number of states using
the 2003 format increased from 28 in 2009 to 41 (including
Washington, DC) by 2013, but the public data set does not
identify individual states over time. This study was deemed
non–human subjects research by the Harvard University
institutional review board.
Study Design
Similar to previous evaluations of the dependent coverage
provision,1-5 we conducted a retrospective cohort study ana-
lyzed using a difference-in-differences analysis comparing
younger adults eligible for the provision to a control group
of slightly older adults. We stratified our results by marital
status because marriage has the potential to modify the
effect of the policy. Married women are more likely to have
private insurance than unmarried women (due partly to
spousal insurance), decreasing the probability that they will
receive coverage through a parent’
s plan.11 This hypothesis
is supported by previous research on the dependent cover-
age provision, including a study on payment for birth,
which found larger increases in private insurance among
unmarried women.1,7
The study period was 2009-2013 because our data set
only included the source of payment for delivery starting in
2009, and, in 2014, the ACA’
s Medicaid and marketplace
expansions took effect, changing coverage options for all
ages. Although dependent coverage was not mandated until
September 23, 2010, some insurers voluntarily implemented
it earlier in 2010. Accordingly, we excluded births in 2010 as a
“washout period,” similar to several prior studies.3,5,7 We
classified 2011-2013 as the postpolicy period.
Main Exposure
The primary assumption of difference-in-differences analy-
sis is that the trends observed in the control group are a valid
counterfactual for what would have occurred in the expo-
sure group if not for the policy. Following published best
practices for this study design, we inspected prepolicy
trends before conducting the assessment of the policy’
s
effects to select our comparison groups.12 Based on an analy-
sis of monthly trends in our study outcomes before 2010, we
defined the exposure group as births to women aged 24 to
25 years and the control group as births to women aged 27 to
28 years. Although many studies of this provision used
broader age groups (eg, ages 19-25 years and 27-34 years),
such wide age bands may yield less-appropriate comparison
groups, and, in our case, violated the parallel trends
assumption for primary payment outcomes; thus, we chose
narrower age bands for a more appropriate analytical com-
parison (eTable 1 in the Supplement).13 Prepolicy monthly
trends were more similar within marital strata than for the
Key Points
Question Is there an association between the dependent
coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act (which allowed
adults to stay on their parents’insurance plans until age 26) and
payment for birth, prenatal care, and birth outcomes?
Findings In this study of nearly 3 million births, the dependent
coverage provision was associated with increased private
insurance payment for birth (1.9 percentage point), increased
early prenatal care (1.0 percentage points), increased adequate
prenatal care (0.4 percentage points), and a reduction in preterm
births (−0.2 percentage points), but not associated with changes
in cesarean delivery, low birth weight, or neonatal intensive care
unit admission.
Meaning Allowing young adults to stay on their parent’
s insurance
was associated with increased private payment for birth, increased
prenatal care use, and modest reduction in preterm births.

 overall sample (eTable 2 in the Supplement). We detected
small but significant differential linear trends prior to 2010
for early prenatal care and neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU) admission overall and among unmarried women only
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Estimating our primary
difference-in-differences regression as if the policy took
effect in July 2009 (post hoc placebo testing), we identified a
similar pattern, with significant results for early prenatal
care and NICU admission overall and among unmarried
women only (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Outcomes
Consistent with numerous studies of health insurance expan-
sions, including the dependent coverage provision, we exam-
ined outcomes in 3 domains: insurance status, access to care,
andhealth.1,3,14-16Thisapproachissupportedbyevidencefrom
a variety of settings showing that coverage changes can lead
to changes in utilization and health outcomes.17
As a proxy for insurance status, we analyzed payment for
birth—Medicaid, private insurance, or self-pay. Payment
for birth does not necessarily capture coverage status before
and during pregnancy; however, most women with private
insurance at delivery have it throughout pregnancy, unlike
Medicaid, which is often acquired during pregnancy or
at delivery.18 To measure access to care, we examined early
prenatal care (first prenatal visit in the first trimester) and
adequate prenatal care (defined by the Adequacy of Prenatal
Care Utilization [APNCU] index).19 The APNCU index defines
adequate prenatal care as having a visit in the first trimester
and at least 80% of the expected number of visits based on
gestational age and clinical guidelines. In addition, we
selected a set of secondary infant birth outcomes for which
previous research suggests an association with insurance sta-
tus and prenatal care: cesarean delivery,20-23 preterm birth
(<37 weeks),10,16,22,24 low birth weight (<2500 g),16,22,24-27
and infant NICU admission.28
Statistical Analysis
We fitted linear probability models for each outcome as a
function of exposure group status, status after implementa-
tion (2011-2013), and their interaction (eMethods in the
Supplement). The interaction term is the difference-in-
differences estimate of the association between the provision
and the outcome (ie, the differential change before and after
the dependent coverage provision among women aged 24-25
years compared with those aged 27-28 years). We used robust
standard errors, but also conducted a sensitivity analysis
with standard errors clustered at the age group–month level,
and this did not substantively change our results (eTable 4 in
the Supplement). Multivariable models controlled for poten-
tial confounders, including month of delivery; maternal
marital status, age, race, ethnicity, and education; whether
the birth was a woman’
s first live birth; multiple delivery; and
paternal age. Race/ethnicity data were drawn from birth cer-
tificate data; states typically use this information to track
population-level health and disparities. Because private
health insurance rates are correlated with employment rates,
which could differentially affect the exposure and control
groups, we also adjusted for monthly sex-specific and age-
specific unemployment rates.29 Prenatal health behaviors,
such as tobacco use, are potentially both intermediate out-
comes and confounders (eFigure in the Supplement). Thus,
we estimated our main model by both adjusting and not
adjusting for tobacco use and found that the results were
essentially unchanged (eTable 5 in the Supplement). To
assess whether changes in the outcomes were potentially
accounted for by changes in payment for birth, we conducted
a sensitivity analysis estimating the association between the
provision and prenatal care and birth outcomes adjusting for
payment for birth. However, our approach did not include a
formal causal medication analysis; rather, like numerous
published studies of this provision and other recent insur-
ance expansions,1,3,30,31 we used a difference-in-differences
framework to simultaneously assess changes in multiple
domains—coverage, access to care, and health outcomes.
Observations with missing or unreported covariates were
included in the analysis and coded using an indicator vari-
able for observations in which the covariate was not re-
ported. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons and thus
our results should be considered exploratory. A 2-sided P value
of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All
analyseswereperformedusingSTATA(StataCorp),version13.1.
Results
Study Population
The final sample included 1 379 005 births to women aged 24
to25years(exposuregroup)and1 551 192birthstowomenaged
27 to 28 years (control group). Prior to the policy, compared
with the control group, the exposure group had a younger pa-
ternal age and a higher proportion of women who were His-
panic, black, unmarried, or without postsecondary educa-
tion (Table 1).
Payment for Birth
In unadjusted analyses, private insurance payment for births
decreased from 36.9% in 2009 to 35.9% in 2011-2013 (differ-
ence, −1.0%) among the exposure group and decreased from
52.4%to51.1%(difference,−1.3%)amongthecontrolgroup(un-
adjusteddifference-in-differences,0.3percentagepoints[95%
CI, 0.01 to 0.6]) (Figure and Table 2). Medicaid payment in-
creased from 51.6% to 53.6% (difference, 2.0%) in the expo-
sure group and from 37.4% to 39.4% (difference, 1.9%) in the
control group (unadjusted difference-in-differences, 0.1 per-
centage points [95% CI, −0.2 to 0.4]). Self-payment for births
decreased 5.2% to 4.3% (difference, −0.9%) in the exposure
groupand4.9%to4.3%(difference,−0.5%)inthecontrolgroup
(unadjusted difference-in-differences, −0.3 percentage points
[95% CI, −0.5 to −0.2]).
In the adjusted difference-in-difference analyses, the de-
pendent coverage provision was associated with a 1.9 percent-
age-point increase (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.1) in private insurance pay-
ment for birth (P < .001; 5% relative increase from a baseline
of 37%), a 1.4 percentage-point decrease (95% CI, −1.7 to −1.2)
in Medicaid payment (P < .001; 3% relative decrease from

CI, −0.4 to −0.1) in self-payment or uninsured (P < .001; 6%
relative decrease from a baseline of 5%).
Among unmarried women, the provision was associated
with a 3.8 percentage-point increase (95% CI, 3.5 to 4.2) in pri-
vate insurance (P < .001; 20% relative increase from a base-
line of 19%), as well as a 3.6 percentage-point decrease (95%
CI, −4.0 to −3.2) in Medicaid (P < .001; 5% relative decrease
from a baseline of 71%) (Table 3). The provision was not asso-
ciated with significant changes in source of payment for mar-
ried women. The differential changes in private payment (−4.2
percentage points [95% CI, −4.6 to −3.7]; P < .001) and Med-
icaid payment (3.8 percentage points [95% CI, 3.3 to 4.3];
P < .001) between unmarried and married women were sta-
tistically significant.
Prenatal Care
Inunadjustedanalyses,earlyprenatalcareincreasedfrom70%
in 2009 to 71.6% in 2011-2013 (difference, 1.6%) in the expo-
sure group and from 75.7% to 76.8% (difference, 1.1%) in the
control group (unadjusted difference-in-differences, 0.6 per-
centage points [95% CI, 0.3 to 0.8]). Adequate prenatal care
increased from 73.5% to 74.8% (difference, 1.3%) in the expo-
sure group and from 77.5% to 78.8% (difference, 1.3%) in the
control group (unadjusted difference-in-differences, 0.04 per-
centage points [95% CI, −0.2 to 0.3]).
In adjusted analyses, the policy was associated with a 1.0
percentage-point increase (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.2) in early prena-
talcare(P < .001;1.4%relativeincreasefromabaselineof70%),
and a 0.4 percentage-point increase (95% CI, 0.2 to 0.6) in ad-
equate prenatal care (P < .001; 0.6% relative increase from a
baseline of 74%). After adjusting for payment for birth, the as-
sociation with early prenatal care was still significant but
roughly 30% smaller in magnitude, and the association with
adequate prenatal care was no longer significant (eTable 6 in
the Supplement).

age points [95% CI, 0.4 to 1.3], P < .001; 1.3% relative increase
from a baseline of 64%) and married women (0.7 percentage

Birth Outcomes
In unadjusted analyses, cesarean deliveries decreased from
30.1% in 2009 to 29.7% in 2011-2013 among the exposure
group (difference, −0.4%) and from 32.1% to 31.5% among
the control group (difference, −0.6%); unadjusted difference-

The y-axis scale shown in blue indicates range from 0% to 12%. The policy
implementation period (January 2010-December 2010) was excluded from the
analysis. Linear regression modeling of the individual-level data with the
payment type as the outcome was used to calculate the monthly season
adjustments as coefficients on monthly dummy variables. The seasonal
adjustments were subtracted from means calculated at the group and month
level. The median No. of births per month (prepolicy/postpolicy): overall control
group (27 251/34 139), overall exposure group (24 864/29 861), married control
group (18 813/23 136), married exposure group (13 539/15 298), unmarried
control goup (8432/10 973), unmarried exposure group (11 361/14 674).

 difference-in-differences, 0.1 percentage points (95% CI, −0.1
to 0.2). NICU admission increased from 6.7% to 7.3% in the
exposure group (difference, 0.6%) and from 6.6% to 7.3% in
the control group (difference, 0.7%), unadjusted difference-
in-differences, −0.1 percentage points (95% CI, −0.2 to 0.1).
In adjusted analyses, the policy was associated with a sta-
tistically significant decrease in preterm birth (−0.2 percent-
age points [95% CI, −0.3 to −0.03], P = .02; 2.2% relative de-
crease from a baseline of 9.4%), but not with changes in
cesarean delivery, low birth weight, or NICU admission. The
association with preterm birth was no longer statistically sig-
nificant after adjusting for payment for birth (eTable 6 in the
Supplement).
In stratified analyses, the policy was associated with sig-
nificant decreases in preterm birth (−0.3 percentage points
[95% CI, −0.5 to 0.002], P = .05; 2.9% relative decrease from
a baseline of 10.3% and cesarean delivery (−0.6 percentage
points [95% CI, −1.0 to −0.2], P = .01; 1.9% relative decrease
from a baseline of 32%) among unmarried women only. The
differential change between unmarried and married women
was significant for cesarean deliveries (0.9 percentage points
[95% CI, 0.4 to 1.4]) but not for preterm birth (0.1 percentage
points [95% CI, −0.2 to 0.5]).
Discussion
In this national study of prenatal care and birth outcomes
among young adults, the ACA dependent coverage provision
was associated with a significant increase in private insur-
ance payment and a reduction in Medicaid payment for
childbirth. The provision was also associated with modest
but statistically significant increases in early and adequate
prenatal care. For secondary birth outcomes, the dependent
coverage provision was associated with modest decreases in
preterm births, but no significant reduction in cesarean deliv-
eries, low birth weight, or infant NICU admissions.
The study findings for changes in payment for birth are
consistent with the study by Akosa Antwi et al,7 which found
a 2.5 percentage-point increase in privately paid births, a 2.1
percentage-point decrease in Medicaid paid births, and a 0.3
percentage-point decrease in self-paid births. The small
decrease in uninsured births associated with the policy con-
trasts with studies of the general young adult population,
which estimated decreases of uninsurance from 3.0 to 4.7
percentage points, driven almost entirely by shifts from unin-
surance to private insurance.1,2 This difference reflects the

 special role Medicaid plays in covering pregnant women.
Medicaid paid for 45% of US births in 2010,32 and even if a
woman is uninsured for most of her pregnancy, by the time
of delivery, there is a high likelihood she will have obtained
Medicaid, if she is eligible. Hospitals have a strong incentive
to enroll eligible women even after delivery to obtain pay-
ment (Medicaid pays retroactive costs for eligible individuals
for up to 3 months prior to enrollment).33 Thus, the estimates
of payment for birth in this study likely understate the role
the policy played in increasing preconception and postcon-
ception coverage and the number of months women were
insured during pregnancy.
Unmarried women experienced a 20% relative increase
in private coverage (3.8 percentage points) in contrast to no
significant change among married women. This is consistent
with the study by Akosa Antwi et al,7 which also found sig-
nificant changes in payment for birth among unmarried
women only. Without the option of spousal coverage, unmar-
ried women were less likely to have private insurance before
the ACA and more likely to benefit from the provision. The
finding that changes in adequate prenatal care, preterm birth,
and cesarean deliveries were only significant among unmar-
ried women is consistent with the interpretation that the
observed changes in prenatal care and birth outcomes are
related to changes in payment for birth, and direct adjust-
ment for payment attenuated the observed changes in prena-
tal care and birth outcomes.
The improvement in prenatal care observed in this study
is consistent with previous research showing that women
with preconception coverage are better able to access clini-
cians early in pregnancy.9 Other research has shown that
having private insurance at delivery is associated with
higher rates of continuous coverage before, during, and after
pregnancy compared with pregnancy-related Medicaid cov-
erage, which only covers women from conception to 60 days
postpartum.18
The estimated increases in prenatal care utilization (1.0
percentage points for early prenatal care and 0.4 percentage
points for adequate prenatal care) are modest but not negli-
gible when considered in the context of other interventions
aimed to improve prenatal care use. Evidence from
pregnancy-related Medicaid expansions in the 1980s found
that despite large increases in coverage, gains in prenatal
care use were inconsistent.24 For example, Epstein and
Newhouse22 observed an increase of 3 percentage points in
early prenatal care in South Carolina but no improvement in
California. Similarly modest evidence exists for community-
based interventions to improve prenatal care. For example,
evidence on home-visiting programs for high-risk women
have found results ranging from no significant difference to
a 4.5 percentage-point increase in adequate prenatal care
use, suggesting that this study’
s estimates for the dependent
coverage provision are in the range of changes detected after
more intensive interventions.34
Given the relatively small coverage and utilization
changes associated with the policy, it is not surprising that
changes in birth outcomes were small in magnitude. These
modest results are similar to previous studies of coverage
expansions to pregnant women, which have found small or
no changes in premature birth, cesarean delivery, and low
birth weight, despite improvements in prenatal care.16,24
Although prenatal care is not the only mechanism through
which expansion of coverage might affect birth outcomes
(eFigure in the Supplement), evidence on the effectiveness of
routine prenatal care is mixed.35-38 Regardless, it is likely that
insurance coverage is still important to improve access to
such interventions.
The dependent coverage provision is one of many com-
ponents of the ACA with the potential to affect reproductive-
age and pregnant women. Future research should examine the
effect of other aspects of the law on insurance coverage dur-
ing pregnancy and resulting effects on access to care, mater-
nal outcomes, and both short-term and long-term children’
s
health outcomes.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, difference-in-
differences analysis relies on the assumption that the trend
after implementation for the control group is a valid coun-
terfactual for what would have been observed in the expo-
sure group, if not for the policy. Based on an analysis of
monthly prepolicy trends, this study used narrower age
bands than previous studies. Small but significant divergent
trends and placebo effects were detected for early prenatal
care and NICU admission among unmarried women, sug-
gesting that results for these outcomes should be interpreted
with caution.
Second, although the use of narrow age bands improves
the study’
s internal validity, this approach only estimates the
association between the provision and outcomes for births to
women aged 24 to 25 years. The provision may have differen-
tially affected women of younger ages, among whom rates of
prenatal care are typically lower and risk of adverse birth out-
comes higher.10
Third, without state identifiers, the analysis could not be
restricted to states based on the year they adopted the 2003
birth certificate format. A previous analysis of the dependent
coverage provision and payment for childbirth compared the
data used in this study with the Nationwide Inpatient Sample
database and found similar results, suggesting this threat to
validity is limited for payment-related outcomes.7 Though
regression models controlled for observed covariates, unob-
served changes in the composition of the exposure and con-
trol group over time could bias the results.
Conclusions
In this study of nearly 3 million births among women aged
24 to 25 years compared with those aged 27 to 28 years, the
Affordable Care Act dependent coverage provision was
associated with increased private insurance payment for
birth, increased use of prenatal care, and modest reduction
in preterm births, but was not associated with changes in
cesarean delivery rates, low birth weight, or neonatal inten-
sive care unit admission.
