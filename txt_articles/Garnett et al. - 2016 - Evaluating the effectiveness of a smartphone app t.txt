Abstract
Background: Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide and interventions
to help people reduce their consumption are needed. Interventions delivered by smartphone apps have the potential
to help harmful and hazardous drinkers reduce their consumption of alcohol. However, there has been little evaluation
of the effectiveness of existing smartphone interventions.
A systematic review, amongst other methodologies, identified promising modular content that could be delivered by
an app: self-monitoring and feedback; action planning; normative feedback; cognitive bias re-training; and identity
change. This protocol reports a factorial randomised controlled trial to assess the comparative potential of these five
intervention modules to reduce excessive alcohol consumption.
Methods: A between-subject factorial randomised controlled trial. Hazardous and harmful drinkers aged 18 or over
who are making a serious attempt to reduce their drinking will be randomised to one of 32 (25) experimental
conditions after downloading the ‘Drink Less’ app. Participants complete baseline measures on downloading
the app and are contacted after 1-month with a follow-up questionnaire. The primary outcome measure is
change in past week consumption of alcohol. Secondary outcome measures are change in AUDIT score, app
usage data and usability ratings for the app. A factorial between-subjects ANOVA will be conducted to assess
main and interactive effects of the five intervention modules for the primary and secondary outcome measures.
Discussion: This study will establish the extent to which the five intervention modules offered in this app can help
reduce hazardous and harmful drinking. This is the first step in optimising and understanding what component parts of
an app could help to reduce excessive alcohol consumption. The findings from this study will be used to inform the
content of a future integrated treatment app and evaluated against a minimal control in a definitive randomised control
trial with long-term outcomes.

 Background
Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for ap-
proximately 3.3 million deaths each year worldwide [1];
only high blood pressure and smoking contribute more
to the global burden of disease [2]. When the impact of
alcohol-related crime and lost productivity is added to
healthcare, alcohol consumption costs the UK economy
an estimated £21bn per year [3]. Tackling excessive alco-
hol consumption is a public health priority [4] and there
is a need for interventions to help people reduce their
consumption.
In the UK, although brief interventions for excessive
alcohol use are available and appear to be both effective
[5] and cost-effective [6, 7], they are not widely offered;
less than 10 % of those drinking excessively receive a
brief intervention on alcohol from their general practi-
tioner (GP) [8]. Digital behaviour change interventions
(DBCIs) delivered on websites, by email or through mo-
bile phones offer the potential to increase the proportion
of excessive drinkers receiving an alcohol brief interven-
tion [9]. The convenience and anonymity of DBCIs may
increase uptake amongst those reluctant to receive help
from health professionals [10, 11]. DBCIs have been
found in meta-analyses and systematic reviews to result
in small reductions in alcohol consumption across a
range of populations [12–20]. A 2016 Cochrane review
of 40 RCTs found that DBCIs reduced alcohol consump-
tion by 23.6 g of alcohol per week (equivalent of 2.95
UK units) more than controls [21, 22].
The rapid development and use of health-related
smartphone apps provides a new method for supporting
people in their attempts to reduce their alcohol con-
sumption. It is estimated that the 165,000 currently
available smartphone apps for the practice of medicine
and public health [23] will be downloaded a total of
three billion times in 2015, almost double the number
from 2013 [24]. Despite their proliferation, evaluation of
app content has revealed they are often developed with-
out reference to scientific evidence or theory, fail to con-
form to guidelines, lack evidence based-content and/or
provide inaccurate information [25–31]. There has been
little evaluation of app effectiveness. Reviews of mobile
phone interventions to promote weight loss [32, 33], im-
prove women’s health [34], increase physical activity [35]
and improve treatment adherence for chronic disease
management [36], as well as a review of digital resources
for mental health self-management [37], found numer-
ous trials of text messaging but few RCTs of apps. When
they have been evaluated, apps have generally been
found effective. Apps have increased physical activity
[38], improved muscular fitness, movement skills, and
weight-related behaviours [39], reduced symptoms of de-
pression [40, 41] and improved diabetes management
[42]. Only one trial of alcohol reduction apps appears to
have been published; this evaluated two different apps
aimed at Swedish university students, both allowed users
to calculate their levels of blood alcohol concentration,
though neither was effective at reducing consumption
relative to controls [43].
The problem of excessive alcohol consumption and
the potential of smartphone apps to help people manage
their behaviour, as well as the limited evidence for the
effectiveness of such apps and their tendency to be de-
veloped without reference to scientific evidence or the-
ory, highlight the need for the rigorous development and
evaluation of new smartphone app alcohol interventions.
Selecting modules for evaluation
The initial selection of modules for evaluation was based
on four main sources of evidence: i) examination of the
behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used in alcohol in-
terventions [44]; ii) a systematic review of the evidence
of the effectiveness of digital technologies for reducing
excessive alcohol consumption [21, 22]; iii), a formal
consensus-building study with experts in the fields of al-
cohol or behaviour change to identify the behaviour
change techniques thought most likely to be effective at
reducing alcohol consumption in a smartphone app [45];
iv), a content analysis of the behaviour change tech-
niques within existing popular alcohol reduction apps
[46]. On the basis of this systematic development work,
the following five modules were selected as high priority
for experimental manipulation evaluation in a factorial
design: self-monitoring and feedback; action planning;
normative feedback; cognitive bias re-training; and iden-
tity change. We elaborate the reasons for each selection
below.
Self-monitoring and feedback
Self-monitoring and feedback are both recommended as
effective
techniques
for
alcohol
reduction
by
the
National
Institute
for
Health
and
Care
Excellence
(NICE) clinical guidance [47]. They are also related to
core elements of Control Theory [48], which posits that
behaviour is goal-driven and that feedback enables
people to assess their performance in relation to their
goals and make adjustments toward it accordingly. Self-
monitoring has been found to be effective for controlling
weight and blood-glucose levels [49–52]; increasing
academic performance [53, 54] and improving healthy
eating
and
physical
activity
[55].
In
the
formal
consensus-building study with behaviour change or alco-
hol experts, self-monitoring was ranked the most likely
intervention component to be effective in a smartphone
app to reduce excessive alcohol consumption [45]. Be-
haviour
change
interventions
which
include
self-
monitoring in combination with at least one of the other
behaviour change techniques (BCTs) relevant to Control
Garnett et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:536 
Page 2 of 10
 Theory have been found to be significantly more effect-
ive than interventions not including those techniques
[55–57]. Feedback is a key component of brief alcohol
interventions [58] and is commonly included in DBCIs:
95 % of the DBCIs in the 2016 Cochrane review gave
participants feedback about their drinking [59]. Feedback
was also ranked highly as an intervention component
likely to be effective in an app to reduce excessive alco-
hol consumption by alcohol or behaviour change experts
in a formal consensus-building study [45].
Action planning
NICE clinical guidance recommends that providers of
behaviour change interventions for alcohol reduction
should facilitate action planning [47]. Action planning
is also a technique related to a core element of Con-
trol Theory, reducing discrepancies between goals and
observed behaviour [48]. Action plans detailing the
steps necessary to achieve a specific goal have been
found to increase physical activity [60], enhance be-
haviour change in patients [61] and reduce alcohol
consumption [62–64]. ‘Implementation intentions’
, a
form of action plan that enable the setting of if/then
conditions
for
future
events
[65],
increased
goal-
attainment rates for health behaviours such as regular
breast examinations [66], engaging in exercise [67]
and alcohol reduction [62–64].
Normative feedback
Normative feedback is personalised feedback on how an
individual’s behaviour compares with the behaviour of
other people. Providing normative feedback can reduce
subsequent alcohol use [68–73] indicating that norma-
tive misperceptions (underestimating own alcohol use
compared with others) play a role in excessive alcohol
consumption. Research has shown that normative mis-
perceptions exist in the general population [74] as well
as in heavy drinkers [69, 70] and college/university stu-
dents [71, 72, 75–77]. Theoretical evidence for the role
of normative misperceptions in excessive alcohol con-
sumption come from Social Norms theory [78]. This
theory predicts that people behave in a way that at-
tempts to conform to the perceived norm. This can re-
sult in people behaving in ways that are not consistent
with their own beliefs and values in their attempt to
reach the perceived norm [79]. Providing feedback in re-
lation to people was also identified by alcohol or behav-
iour change experts as an intervention component likely
to be effective at reducing excessive alcohol consump-
tion in a smartphone app [45].
Cognitive bias re-training
Dual process theories of addiction [80–82] suggest that
excessive alcohol consumption occurs, in part, due to
automatic processes when the impulses to drink over-
come the inhibitory response not to [83]. These auto-
matic biases in information processing of alcohol-related
cues or stimuli have been found to predict alcohol use
[84, 85] though are largely unaffected by interventions
targeting changing conscious information or processes
[86, 87]. Cognitive bias re-training has been found to be
effective at altering these automatic cognitive biases
[88–92] and some studies have also found there are as-
sociated impacts on subsequent alcohol use [90, 91, 93,
94]. The intervention strategy chosen for this module is
to re-train approach biases, with the aim of changing the
tendency to approach alcohol and alcohol-related stimuli
to an ‘avoid’ bias. Retraining these approach biases has
been shown to have a greater efficacy in reducing alco-
hol consumption [90–92] than retraining other cognitive
biases such as attentional biases [95].
Identity change
Excessive drinking is central to many peoples’ sense of
self, particularly students [96], and identity has been
proposed as a motivational factor for behaviours by a
number of theories [97–99], including the PRIME theory
of motivation which proposes that identity is a source of
motives, self-regulation and stability of behaviour [100].
Identity (group, social and/or individual) was also identi-
fied in a consensus approach as a theoretical domain to
explain behaviour change [101]. The relationship be-
tween identity and behaviour change has not been inves-
tigated in the field of alcohol research though there is
evidence from the smoking cessation literature that
identity change (adopting an identity that is incongruent
with the undesired behaviour) may be an effective inter-
vention technique. A systematic analysis of English Stop
Smoking
Services
treatment
manuals
found
that
‘strengthening an ex-smoker identity’ was associated
with 4-week abstinence rates (both carbon-monoxide
verified and self-reported) [102]. A positive smoker iden-
tity was present in a minority of smokers in England and
predicted failure to make a smoking quit attempt at 6
months and so may be an important barrier to behaviour
change [103]. A meta-ethnography also found that the
nature of a smoker’s identity can play an important role
in smoking cessation [104].
Each of the intervention modules detailed above con-
tain a number of relevant behaviour change techniques,
details of the full content of each module are sum-
marised in Additional file 1: Table S1. To evaluate both
the overall effectiveness of the app and its component
modules, we will use a full factorial study design, guided
by the Multiphase Optimization Strategy [105]. This
uses factorial experiments to screen possible interven-
tion components selected on the basis of theory and evi-
dence to identify those warranting further investigation

 [106], with users randomly allocated to receive either an
enhanced (‘high’) or minimal (‘low’) version of each
intervention module.
Methods
Aim
The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
five intervention modules at reducing excessive alcohol
consumption.
Design
A between-subject factorial randomised controlled trial
evaluating the effectiveness of five intervention modules
(i) self-monitoring and feedback, ii) action planning, iii)
normative feedback, iv) cognitive bias re-training, and v)
identity change), all with a ‘high’ and ‘low’ version (see
Additional file 1: Table S1) yielding 32 experimental con-
ditions (see Additional file 2: Table S2). This factorial de-
sign was chosen over a treatment package approach with
usual care or nothing as a control group so that the indi-
vidual effect of each intervention module on excessive
alcohol consumption can be assessed. A factorial design
also requires smaller sample sizes than individual experi-
mental designs whilst still maintaining the same power.
Intervention
Drink Less is an app available for iOS devices that is de-
signed to support a user who is interested in cutting
down their alcohol consumption. The iOS (Apple’s oper-
ating system) was chosen to avoid issues of fragmenta-
tion associated with Android [107] and because there
tends to be a greater retention rate for apps amongst
iPhone users compared with Android [108]. There was a
pragmatic, methodological need to structure the app
around an activity that would engage all users and allow
experimental manipulation of other supporting modules.
Thus, the app asks all users to set a goal to which they
would like to reduce their alcohol consumption. The
app then offers them access to a variety of modules and
tools to help them achieve their goal. The app was
interactive though there was no human component to
its functionality. The content of these five interven-
tion modules is described in detail in Additional file
1: Table S1. The ‘high’ version of each intervention
module contained the BCTs or intervention compo-
nent hypothesised to be effective. The ‘low’ version of
each intervention module lacked the BCTs or inter-
vention component being assessed and, where pos-
sible, were based on controls in equivalent studies.
Study sample
Participants will be included in the analysis if they have
downloaded the app onto an iOS smartphone or tablet,
are 18 years of age or over, live in the United Kingdom
and have an AUDIT score of 8 or above (indicative of
excessive alcohol consumption), have confirmed that
they are making an attempt to reduce their drinking
(responded “Interested in drinking less alcohol”, not
“Just browsing” to “Why are you using this app?”), and
provided an email address.
This study will recruit 672 participants and have more
than 80 % power (with alpha at 5 %, 1:1 allocation and a
two-tailed test) to detect a mean change in alcohol con-
sumption of 5 units between the high and low condition
for each intervention module [109]. This assumes a
mean of 27 weekly units at follow-up in the control
group, a mean of 22 units in the intervention group and
a SD of 23 units for both (d = 0.22), and rounds up the
sample size to the nearest multiple of 32 to ensure all
cells are balanced. The estimated effect size is large
(comparable with that of a face-to-face brief intervention
[5]) and may be considered somewhat unrealistic for a
module within a digital intervention. However, in the
event of a ‘non-significant’ result, we plan to calculate a
Bayes factor to establish the relative likelihood of the
null versus the experimental hypothesis given the data
obtained [110]. This will permit a relative judgment for
the purposes of screening about whether the inclusion
of the module in a future app would be more likely than
not to have an effect on alcohol consumption.
Recruitment
Participants will be recruited through a number of
methods. The app will be listed in the iTunes Store
and the listing will be optimised according to best
practices for app store optimisation (e.g. ensuring the
keywords are carefully selected, that the description
is well written and that screenshots display the as-
pects of the app that users are most interested in
[111–114]). Users will be encouraged to leave re-
views, which may persuade others to download it
[114, 115]. We intend to promote the app through
organisations such as the Department of Health and
Public Health England, and mHealth (mobile health)
directory
web
sites
(e.g.
ourmobilehealth.co.uk,
myhealthapps.net),
alcohol-reduction
online
forums
(e.g. Club Soda) and the UCL App Lab service that pro-
motes apps to all of the staff and students at UCL.
Procedure
Each participant, on downloading the app, will be asked to
read the participant information sheet and provide in-
formed consent. Before being able to access the content of
the
app
participants
are
asked
to
provide
socio-
demographic data, indicate their reason for using the app
(interested in drinking less alcohol or just browsing), pro-
vide their e-mail address for the 1-month follow-up ques-
tionnaire and complete the full AUDIT questionnaire. At
Garnett et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:536 
Page 4 of 10
 this point, all participants who meet the inclusion criteria
will be randomised to one of 32 unique experimental con-
ditions (see Additional file 2: Table S2) in a block random-
isation method. After this they are provided with their
AUDIT score and informed of their ‘AUDIT risk zone’.
From this point onwards, the app differs for the different
experimental conditions. Participants who do not meet all
of the inclusion criteria can still use the app and will be al-
located to a separate, non-experimental condition that has
the ‘high’ version of each intervention module for engage-
ment and app rating purposes.
One month after downloading the app, the app will
automatically deliver a follow-up questionnaire. If this is
not completed, email reminders will be sent at periodic
intervals (1 day and 1 week). The follow-up question-
naire consists of the AUDIT and questions regarding
usability.
Measures
Baseline measures
AUDIT score; socio-demographic assessment (age, gen-
der, ethnicity, level of education, employment status and
whether they are a current smoker).
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure is change in past week
consumption of alcohol; calculated from the AUDIT-C
score at baseline and 1-month follow-up [109]. Second-
ary outcome measures will be i) change between baseline
and follow-up on the full AUDIT score ii) app usage data
(user sessions per day, screen views per day, screens per
session, session duration and session instances, user re-
tention), and iii) usability ratings for the app (a) how
helpful did you find Drink Less? b) how easy did you
find Drink Less to use? c) how satisfied are you with
Drink Less? d) how likely are you to recommend Drink
Less to a friend?). An intention-to-treat approach will be
used such that those who are lost to follow-up will be
retained in the primary analysis and assumed to be
drinking at baseline levels. The full 10-item AUDIT as-
sesses alcohol consumption (AUDIT-C), harmful drink-
ing and alcohol dependence [116]. The AUDIT has been
used in other trials for assessing alcohol consumption
and related harms [117].
Analysis
A factorial between-subjects ANOVA will be conducted
to assess main and interactive effects of the five inter-
vention modules on the primary and secondary out-
comes. In a sensitivity analysis, ANCOVAs will also be
conducted to adjust for any chance imbalances in drink-
ing and socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age,
ethnicity, level of education, employment status, AUDIT
score, AUDIT-C score).
On the basis of the intention-to-treat principle, individ-
uals who are not followed up (non-responders) will be
retained in the analyses and assumed they drinking at same
levels as baseline. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted i)
among only those who completed the follow-up question-
naire (responders) and ii) by imputing missing data from
baseline characteristics. The intention-to-treat principle is
often used in digital public health interventions [118–120]
and is a conservative approach to ensure effect sizes are not
over-estimated as participants who respond well to the
intervention are more likely to be retained.
In the event of a non-significant main effect of an
intervention module, Bayes factors will be calculated
with the alternative hypotheses conservatively repre-
sented in each case by a half-normal distribution (online
calculator: http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Zoltan_
Dienes/inference/Bayes.htm). In an alternative hypoth-
esis represented by a half-normal distribution, the stand-
ard deviation of a distribution can be specified as an
expected effect size, which means plausible values have
been effectively represented between zero and twice the
effect size, with smaller values more likely. The expected
effect size for the primary calculation of Bayes factors
will be the same as for the power calculation (d = 0.22).
In a sensitivity analysis, we will also calculate Bayes fac-
tors for a smaller effect (reflecting a reduction of 3 units
per week, d = 0.13).
Discussion
This study protocol describes the design of a factorial
randomised controlled trial to determine the effective-
ness of five intervention modules delivered within a
smartphone app at reducing excessive alcohol consump-
tion. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to
examine the effectiveness of a smartphone app to reduce
excessive alcohol consumption that has been developed
based on empirical evidence and theoretical models.
This type of trial and analysis means we can independ-
ently assess each module to see which module is having
the biggest effect. This also allows for on-going evalu-
ation and optimisation of the app for future evaluation
of an integrated treatment package. As each module was
developed based on empirical evidence and theoretical
models, the findings of this study will be able to inform
behavioural science, theory and future public health in-
terventions. The ‘pure control’ group in this trial was ef-
fectively those who received ‘low’ versions of every
intervention module which lacked the BCTs or interven-
tion component being assessed in the ‘high’ version.
Most popular alcohol reduction apps include almost no
BCTs or mentions of theory [46], therefore the users re-
ceiving the ‘pure control’ were effectively receiving ‘usual
care’ in this context.

 The selection process of high priority modules for
evaluation was intended to be systematic and transpar-
ent. However, it is possible that other researchers could
have conducted a similar process and reached a different
view. For example, it may have been of interest to evalu-
ate the individual effect of goal-setting. Goal-setting was
provided to all participants for two reasons. First, from a
methodological perspective, we believed there was a
pragmatic need to provide engaging content to all users,
particularly those receiving low versions of all the mod-
ules, and around which access to other modules could
be
plausibly
structured.
Second,
we
thought
the
evidence-base on goal-setting was sufficiently robust that
it would warrant inclusion in a future evaluation of an
integrated app without support from a factorial screen-
ing experiment [121–123].
Our power calculation relied on a large estimated ef-
fect size (comparable with that of a face-to-face brief
intervention) and may be considered somewhat unrealis-
tic for a module within a digital intervention. The reason
is that selecting smaller effect sizes would require larger
numbers of participants and more time to recruit them.
The Multiphase Optimization Strategy, which guides our
research, emphasises agile screening experiments before
running a definitive head-to-head trial of an optimised
intervention against a control [106, 124]. We deal with
the limitation of a somewhat unrealistic effect size for
our power calculation by planning to supplement our in-
ferential statistics by calculating Bayes factors. Bayes fac-
tors will provide useful information on the relative
likelihood of smaller (more realistic) effects compared
with the null given the data we obtain.
One strength of this intervention is that it is delivered
by smartphone, so there will be no issues of availability
or accessibility for the participants. The app can be used
fully without an internet connection. The data is stored
on the phone until an internet connection is available,
when the data is then sent to the server. A limitation of
this type of study is high attrition. We will send regular
reminders for the one-month follow-up questionnaire
and remind them of the incentives offered to reduce the
risk of attrition. A practical issue may be recruiting enough
participants to meet the numbers sufficient to meet the
power for our analysis. We have planned for this issue by
using best practices for app store optimisation and by pro-
moting the app through trusted organisations such as Pub-
lic Health England and University College London.
This study will evaluate the extent to which an app
containing five intervention modules (self-monitoring
combined with feedback, action planning, normative
feedback, cognitive bias re-training, and identity change),
developed based on theory and empirical evidence, can
help reduce excessive alcohol consumption. Each inter-
vention module will be independently assessed and the
findings will be used to inform the content of a future app
with an integrated treatment package that will be evaluated
against a minimal control in a definitive randomised con-
trol trial with long-term outcomes. As the app and its inter-
vention modules have been developed based on theoretical
models and empirical evidence, these findings will also be
able to inform future behaviour change interventions, the-
ories and behavioural science.
