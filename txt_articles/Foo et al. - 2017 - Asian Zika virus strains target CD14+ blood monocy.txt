Abstract
Blood CD14+ monocytes are the frontline immunomodulators categorized into classical, 
intermediate or non-classical subsets, subsequently differentiating into M1 pro- or M2 anti-
inflammatory macrophages upon stimulation. While Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes 
viremia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during pregnancy, remain elusive. 
Furthermore, it is unknown whether African- and Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic

 impacts on host immune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+ monocytes 
as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. When immunoprofiles of 
human blood infected with ZIKV were compared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated 
M1-skewed inflammation by African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in contrast to a non-
classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed immunosuppression by Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. 
Importantly, infection of pregnant women’s blood revealed enhanced susceptibility to ZIKV 
infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV infection of pregnant women’s blood led to an 
exacerbated M2-skewed immunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with 
global suppression of type I interferon-signaling pathway and an aberrant expression of host genes 
associated with pregnancy complications. 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients also 
showed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and pregnancy complication-
associated fibronectin-1. This study demonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of 
blood monocytes, particularly during pregnancy, upon infection with different lineages of ZIKV.
Introduction
Climate change and global warming have increased the toll of mosquito-borne diseases, due 
to development of favorable meteorological conditions for mosquito breeding1. Similar to 
other mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as Dengue virus, ZIKV is also transmitted by Aedes 
mosquitoes that are widely spread in most parts of the world2. Currently, ZIKV outbreaks 
have been reported in 59 countries, mainly affecting the North and South America 
continents3. Despite mild symptomatic illness being exhibited by only 20% of infected 
individuals, ZIKV has been unexpectedly associated with almost 3,000 cases of 
microcephaly and/or central nervous system malformations reported in 29 countries3. When 
ZIKV re-emerged on Yap Island in 2007, it appeared to have evolved from the original 
African lineage first discovered back in 1947 in Uganda, taking a new form, now identified 
as the Asian lineage4,5. Despite a 90% sequence homology between the two lineages, stark 
differences in the replication kinetics, infectivity and immune responses have been reported 
during infection of neural cells6. Recent advances on ZIKV have shed insights on its tropism 
for the maternal-fetal interface. ZIKV has been detected in placental tissues of infected 
expectant mothers, specifically within the placental macrophages, known as Hofbauer cells 
and intervillous histiocytes found on the maternal side7,8. Additionally, the neurotropism of 
ZIKV for glial cells and endothelial cells of fetal brains has also been identified8.
Pregnancy is a sophisticated immune-altering process which requires prudent 
immunomodulation of innate immunity to ensure healthy pregnancy outcomes9. In 
particular, circulating maternal monocytes play a crucial role, where the activation and 
transition of monocytes to macrophages is essential for healthy placental development10,11. 
Blood monocytes exhibit morphological and functional plasticity that can be categorized 
into: (i) classical (CD14hi CD16−), (ii) intermediate (CD14hi CD16+) and (iii) non-classical 
(CD14lo CD16+) subsets12. In addition, monocytes can further differentiate into pro-
inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages11,13. While the fate of these 
monocyte subsets remains a subject of debate, findings from a mouse model of vascular 
inflammation have suggested that classical and non-classical monocytes are most likely to 
differentiate into M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively14. During pregnancy, the

 continuous growth of the semi-allogeneic fetus in the expectant mother leads to an 
expansion of an intermediate monocyte population and a shift from T helper (Th)1 to Th2-
dominating immunity in the peripheral system15. This alteration of immune responsiveness 
commences in early pregnancy when blood monocytes recruited to the placenta are 
converted into M2 macrophages to ensure an immunosuppressive environment for fetus 
development10. Activated monocytes are cytokine factories capable of secreting immune 
mediators that in turn further direct monocyte differentiation. For instance, C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand (CXCL)10, interleukin (IL)-23A, IL-12, cluster of differentiation (CD)64, 
CD80, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), 
and C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) promote differentiation into M1 macrophages, 
whereas IL-10, arginase (Arg)-1, CD200R, CD163, CD23, C-C motif chemokine 22 
(CCL22), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFα), chitinase-3-like protein 1 
(CHI3L1/YKL-40) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) prime M2 macrophage 
polarization16–21. Indeed, overt activation of monocytes/macrophages can induce excessive 
cytokine production, leading to pregnancy complications such as pre-elampsia10,22.
Despite the established placental tropism of ZIKV, little is known regarding the target cells 
in the blood and their immune responses elicited by ZIKV viremia. Here, we identified 
CD14+ monocytes as the primary target for the infection of two different lineages of ZIKV, 
which ultimately promoted differential monocytic shifts. Asian ZIKV infection induced the 
pronounced expansion of non-classical monocytes leading to M2-skewed 
immunosuppressive phenotype evidenced by the overt production of IL-10. In contrast, 
African ZIKV infection promoted inflammatory M1-skewed immune responses along with 
the specific induction of CXCL10 by intermediate monocytes. Furthermore, blood from 
pregnant women showed an enhanced infectivity to African and Asian ZIKV, leading to 
pronounced M1/M2-skewed immune responses. Finally, multiplex cytokine array of sera 
from ZIKV+ symptomatic pregnant women also showed increased levels of M2-skewed 
immunosuppressive cytokines and fibronectin-1 (FN1) associated with pregnancy 
complications. This study demonstrates the differential phenotypic responses of human 
blood monocytes induced by different lineages of ZIKV following infection and sheds 
important insights to the pronounced immune responses present during pregnancy.
Results
ZIKV specifically targets human CD14+ blood monocytes, inducing phenotypic shift
Infections of heparinized whole blood obtained from healthy donors were performed using 
African ZIKV (MR766) and Asian ZIKV (H/PF/2013) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 
(Fig. 1a). At 24 hour post infection (hpi), PBMCs were isolated from whole blood 
specimens and the susceptibility to ZIKV infection was determined using viral load qRT-
PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Interestingly, despite 90% sequence 
identity between ZIKV MR766 and H/PF/2013 strains, significantly higher viral burden was 
detected in PBMCs infected with MR766 strain than in those infected with H/PF/2013 strain 
(Fig. 1b). To identify the primary target cells by ZIKV infection, we sorted and gated the 
isolated PBMCs by flow cytometry into four major blood immune subsets (monocytes, NK 
cells, T cells and B cells) (Supplementary Fig. 1a), followed by detection of the ZIKV NS1

 RNA and envelope (E) protein. Viral load and FACS analyses identified CD14+ monocytes 
among these sorted immune subsets as the primary target cells for ZIKV infection (Fig. 
1c,d). Similarly, higher viral burdens were detected in CD14+ monocytes infected with the 
MR766 strain than in those infected with the H/PF/2013 strain (Fig. 1c,d).
CD14hi CD16− classical monocytes are the dominant monocyte subsets in blood which 
rapidly undergo activation and phenotypic shift upon stimulation. To determine whether 
ZIKV infections drive the phenotypic shift of classical monocytes into other subsets, we 
examined ZIKV-infected monocytes using CD14 and CD16 surface markers (Supplementary 
Fig. 1b). Indeed, either MR766 or H/PF/2013 ZIKV infection induced specific expansion of 
CD14lo CD16+ non-classical monocytes, but not that of CD14hi CD16+ intermediate 
monocytes. Surprisingly, despite its lower virus burden, H/PF/2013-infected monocytes 
showed significantly higher expansion of CD14lo CD16+ non-classical monocytes than 
MR766-infected monocytes (Fig. 1e). These data identified CD14+ monocytes as the 
primary target cells for ZIKV infection, in which the H/PF/2013 strain drives a higher 
expansion of CD14lo CD16+ non-classical monocytes despite its lower viral burden when 
compared to the MR766 strain.
Different lineages of ZIKV differentially affect expressions of cytokines and immune 
modulatory genes
Activated monocytes are key producers of cytokines in blood which subsequently influence 
monocyte differentiation. To determine whether ZIKV infection affects cytokine expression, 
PBMCs were isolated from whole blood at 24 hpi with MR766 ZIKV or H/PF/2013 ZIKV 
and subjected to qRT-PCR screening for 43 cytokines and immune modulatory genes 
commonly associated with acute viral infection, which were further categorized into four 
different pathways [type I interferon (IFN)-related signaling, inflammation, M1-skewed pro-
inflammation, and M2-skewed immunosuppression). Heat map representation revealed the 
contrasting induction pattern of cytokines and immune mediators in response to the infection 
with two different lineages of ZIKV strains (Fig. 2a). MR766-infected whole blood 
exhibited an apparent increase of IFN-β in plasma, while little or no increase of IFN-β 
detected upon H/PF/2013 infection (Fig. 2b). Consistently, MR766 infection elicited a 
significantly higher induction of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/2, 
2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) 1/3, viperin, IFN regulatory factor (IRF)7/9, and 
nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) subunits p50 and p65 when compared to H/PF/2013 
infection (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Interestingly, a panel of cytokines and 
immune modulatory genes (CXCL10, IL-23A, CD64, CD80, IL-18, IDO, SOCS1 and 
CCR7) associated with M1-skewed inflammation was profoundly induced specifically upon 
MR766 infection (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). By striking contrast, H/PF/2013-
infected PBMCs demonstrated a significant elevation of M2-skewed immunosuppression 
related genes (IL-10, Arg-1, CD200R, CD163, CD23, CCL22 and VEGFα) (Fig. 2d,e and 
Supplementary Fig. 2c,d).
As CXCL10 and IL-10 cytokines are crucial for priming monocytes/macrophages into pro-
inflammatory M1-skewed and immunosuppressive M2-skewed phenotypes, respectively17, 
we sorted mock- and ZIKV-infected PBMCs into monocytes, NK cells, T cells and B cells,

 followed by qRT-PCR analysis. These results showed the specific induction of CXCL10 and 
IL-10 expressions in ZIKV-infected CD14+ monocytes. Strikingly, MR766-infected 
monocytes exhibited a high level of CXCL10 expression, while a high IL-10 expression was 
detected in H/PF/2013-infected monocytes (Fig. 2f). Consistent with these observations, 
ELISA performed on plasma of mock- and ZIKV-infected whole blood specimens at 24 hpi 
showed a considerable production of CXCL10 was detected upon MR766 infection, whereas 
a significant production of IL-10 was observed upon H/PF/2013 infection (Fig. 2g). 
Together, these data indicate that different lineages of ZIKV differentially affect the 
expression of cytokine and immune modulatory genes associated with M1- or M2-skewed 
monocytes/macrophage phenotypes.
Asian ZIKV preferentially targets non-classical monocytes, driving specific IL-10 
expression
To further address the differential expansion of monocyte subsets upon infection with 
different lineages of ZIKV, we infected total monocytes isolated from human whole blood 
with H/PF/2013 or MR766, followed by sorting into individual monocyte subsets (Fig. 3a). 
Despite infection at the same MOI, the H/PF/2013 strain showed much lower viral loads in 
infected monocytes than the MR766 strain (Fig. 3b,d). Since in vitro differentiation of 
monocytes to macrophages takes 3–5 days post stimulation23,24, mock- or ZIKV-infected 
monocytes were harvested at 2 dpi for apparent detection of M1-/M2-skewed markers, and 
subsequently sorted into individual monocyte subsets. This showed that H/PF/2013 infection 
led to the apparent decrease of classical monocytes in conjunction with the considerable 
increase of non-classical monocytes (Fig. 3c). Analysis of the ZIKV intracellular E protein 
and NS1 RNA load revealed that MR766 preferentially infects intermediate monocytes, 
while H/PF/2013 infects non-classical monocytes at a higher magnitude (Fig. 3e,f). 
Furthermore, MR766-infected classical/intermediate monocytes exhibited a high level of 
CXCL10 expression, while a high IL-10 expression was detected in H/PF/2013-infected 
non-classical monocytes (Fig. 3g,h). Finally, infection with either MR766 or H/PF/2013 did 
not elicit detectable cell death at 48 hpi (Fig. 3i). These data further demonstrate that 
different lineages of ZIKV infection differentially target M1- or M2-skewed monocyte 
subsets.
Different immunologic traits between African and Asian lineage ZIKV strains
To test that differential levels of virus infectivity, non-classical monocyte expansion and 
immunoregulatory gene expression were a conserved immunologic trait between African 
and Asian lineage ZIKV strains, whole human blood samples were infected with additional 
African lineage IbH30656 and Asian lineage PRVABC59 ZIKV strains at different MOIs, 
and PBMCs and plasma were isolated at 40 hpi. Consistent with previous results (Fig. 1b), 
lower ZIKV burden was observed upon infection with Asian ZIKV PRVABC59 and H/PF/
2013 when compared to infection with African ZIKV counterparts MR766 and IbH30656 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a,d). Furthermore, the apparent expansions of CD14lo CD16+ non-
classical monocytes was observed following ZIKV PRVABC59 infection, whereas a 
minimal increase of CD14lo CD16+ non-classical monocytes was observed following 
African ZIKV IbH30656 infection (Supplementary Fig. 3b,e). Similarly, the robust induction 
of CXCL10 expression was observed upon African ZIKV IbH30656 infection, but not upon

 ZIKV PRVABC59 infection. In contrast, IL-10 expression was induced only upon Asian 
ZIKV PRVABC59 infection (Supplementary Fig. 3c,f). Thus, these results demonstrate that 
lower virus burden, non-classical monocyte expansion and M2-skewed immunosuppression 
gene expression are commonly associated with Asian ZIKV strains, whereas higher virus 
burden and M1-skewed inflammatory gene expression are triggered by African ZIKV 
strains.
Pregnancy is associated with enhanced ZIKV infection and profound monocyte subset 
shift
Despite numerous clinical cohort studies of ZIKV-infected pregnant women, the exact acute 
immunological effects induced by ZIKV infection remain unknown. To investigate if ZIKV 
differentially altered blood immunity during different trimesters of pregnancy, we infected 
whole blood specimens obtained from women in their first, second and third trimester of 
gestation. Whole blood specimens of age-matched non-pregnant women were included as 
controls. Higher viral burdens were detected in PBMCs isolated from first trimester pregnant 
women following ZIKV MR766 and H/PF/2013 infections as compared to non-pregnant 
women, albeit higher viral loads were detected following MR766 infection than following 
H/PF/2013 infection (Fig. 4a,b). We further confirmed that CD14+ monocytes were the 
primary target cells for ZIKV infection during pregnancy, and that the H/PF/2013 strain 
showed lower viral infection in these monocytes than the MR766 strain (Fig. 4c). 
Surprisingly, H/PF/2013 infection induced a dramatic expansion of CD14lo CD16+ non-
classical monocytes in maternal blood from the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, 
while blood from the third trimester of pregnancy exhibited a non-classical monocyte 
expansion similar to blood from non-pregnant women (Fig. 4d,e). Compared to H/PF/2013 
infection, small increase of non-classical monocytes was observed with MR766 infection of 
blood from non-pregnant and pregnant women in all trimesters of pregnancy (Fig. 4d,e). 
These results provide the first experimental evidence that the early stage of pregnancy is a 
period of high susceptibility to ZIKV infection, leading to a dramatic expansion of CD14lo 
CD16+ non-classical monocytes in maternal blood.
Differential expression of immune modulatory genes in the blood of pregnant women upon 
African or Asian lineage ZIKV infection
Next, we characterized the expression profiles of IFN signaling related genes, M1-skewed 
inflammation genes, and M2-skewed immunosuppression genes in PBMCs isolated from 
blood of pregnant and non-pregnant women at 40 hpi with ZIKV (Fig. 5a). MR766 infection 
induced IFN-β production in plasma of pregnant and non-pregnant women, albeit a 
significantly lower level of IFN-β production was noted in plasma of pregnant women as 
compared to that of non-pregnant women (Fig 5a). On the other hand, H/PF/2013 infection 
led to lower IFN-β response in blood of both pregnant and non-pregnant women than 
MR766 infection (Fig. 2b and 5a). In addition, STAT1/2, OAS1/3 and viperin expression in 
blood of pregnant women were highly elevated following MR766 infection, but not 
following infection with H/PF/2013 (Fig. 5b).
Pregnancy intrinsically displays a high magnitude of M2-polarized gene expression, 
particularly during first and second trimesters11. Upon mock infection condition, expression

 of M2-skewed immunosuppression markers (IL-10, Arg-1, CD200R, YKL-40, CD163 and 
VEGFα) were significantly higher in the blood of pregnant women than in that of non-
pregnant subjects (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In contrast, the suppression of CXCL10 and 
IL-23A expressions were observed in blood from pregnant subjects, while expression of 
other M1-related markers was unchanged regardless of pregnancy status (Supplementary 
Fig. 4b). Upon MR766 infection, plasma CXCL10 levels were significantly elevated in 
plasma of both non-pregnant and pregnant subjects, though to a lower extent in that of 
pregnant women (Fig. 5c). Similarly, the expression of M1-skewed inflammation related 
genes including CXCL10, IDO, CD80, CCR7, SOCS1, IL-23A, IL-12 p35 and IL-18 were 
highly induced in MR766-infected blood from pregnant women (Fig. 5d and Supplementary 
Fig. 4c). Despite elevated basal plasma IL-10 levels and expression of M2-related genes 
during pregnancy (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 4a), H/PF/2013 infection further 
enhanced plasma IL-10 levels in plasma of pregnant women, particularly during the first and 
second trimesters (Fig. 5e), and the CCL22 and YKL-40 expression in their blood (Fig. 5f). 
In addition, expression of M2-related genes (IL-10, Arg-1, CD200R, CCL22, YKL-40 and 
CCL2) in blood of non-pregnant women was also increased upon H/PF/2013 infection, but 
not following MR766 infection (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 4d). Finally, multiplex 
cytokine array analyses of sera from 30 RT-PCR confirmed ZIKV+ symptomatic pregnant 
women and 14 healthy control pregnant women demonstrated overt expression of M2-
skewed immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10, CD163 and YKL-40, but not that of M1 
cytokine IL-12 p40, in sera of ZIKV+ infected pregnant women (Fig. 5g–j). Serum IL-10 
was elevated particularly in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy in ZIKV+ women, 
whereas serum CD163 and YKL-40 were significantly increased in all trimesters of 
pregnancy in ZIKV+ women (Fig. 5g–i). Finally, serum IL-10, CD163 and YKL-40 were 
considerably high in ZIKV+-viremic or viruric pregnant women than in healthy control 
pregnant women (Fig. 5g–i). Together, analyses of in vitro infection and that of patient 
specimens clearly demonstrate that Asian ZIKV infection preferentially leads to the M2-
skewed immunosuppression phenotype host immune response.
Transcriptome analysis of blood monocytes upon MR766 or H/PF/2013 ZIKV infection
Since CD14+ monocytes were the primary target cells for ZIKV infection in blood, we 
isolated total monocytes from mock- and ZIKV-infected whole blood at 40 hpi, followed by 
multiplexed gene expression analysis using NanoString nCounter platform that targets ~600 
myeloid cell-related genes (Supplementary dataset 1). Analysis of infected non-pregnant 
women’s monocytes revealed the specific induction of a larger pool of myeloid cell-related 
genes upon infection with MR766 (75 genes) than with H/PF/2013 (42 genes) (Fig. 6a and 
Supplementary Fig. 4a). In addition, MR766 infection led to a higher induction of IFN-
signaling pathway genes compared to H/PF/2013 infection (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Most 
host genes induced by MR766 infection were M1-skewed inflammation-related [CXCL10, 
IL-12B, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2)] and pro-inflammatory genes 
[complement factor 3 (C3), resistin-like beta (RETNLB), ribonuclease A family member 3 
(RNASE3) and IL-27], whereas H/PF/2013 infection-induced host genes were M2-skewed 
immunosuppression related [IL-10, IL-4 and platelet-derived growth factor subunit B 
(PDGFB)] (Fig. 6b). In addition, H/PF/2013 infection induced host genes for fatty acid 
oxidation [lipoprotein lipase (LPL)] and collagen deposition [ADAMTS14, discoidin

 domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2) and collagen alpha-1(X) chain (COL10A1)] that are 
crucial for M2 macrophage function (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, unlike monocytes from non-
pregnant women which showed induction of a larger pool of myeloid cell-related genes 
following MR766 infection rather than H/PF/2013 infection (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 
4a), monocytes from pregnant women were more reactive to H/PF/2013 infection than 
MR766 infection (Fig. 6c). Consistent with a clinical study showing that Asian ZIKV 
infection during the first and second trimester led to a significantly higher frequency of fetal 
anomalies25,26, H/PF/2013 infection induced expression of a higher number of host genes in 
monocytes from women in their first and second trimesters of pregnancy than women in 
their third trimester of gestation or non-pregnant (Fig. 6c). Interestingly, we also observed 
that two host pregnancy complication-associated genes ADAMTS9 and fibronectin 1 
(FN1)27–31 were induced in PBMCs and monocytes of women in their first and second 
trimesters of pregnancy following Asian ZIKV infection (Fig. 6c,d). Indeed, serum FN1 
exhibited significantly elevated levels in ZIKV+ pregnant patients in any trimester of 
pregnancy as well as in ZIKV+-viremic or -viruric pregnant women (Fig. 6e). In summary, 
we demonstrate that infections with different lineages of ZIKV lead to different expression 
profiles of host immune genes and that this effect is dependent on pregnancy stage, 
especially during the first and second trimesters of gestation. Furthermore, our results show 
that Asian ZIKV infection induces the aberrant expression of host pregnancy complication-
associated genes FN1 and ADAMTS9, which may contribute to adverse pregnancy 
outcomes.
Discussion
The recent re-emergence of ZIKV infection and its ominous association with congenital 
anomalies during pregnancy has captivated global attention25,26,32,33. Despite large clinical 
cohort studies of ZIKV-infected pregnant women, the dynamics of viral replication and 
blood immunity of ZIKV remains elusive. ZIKV viremia in infected patients typically 
resolves in the first week of infection, as early as 72 hpi34. Due to the short viremic phase 
and mild clinical symptoms, identifying acute ZIKV patients and obtaining their blood 
specimens has been a challenging task. So far, ZIKV replication dynamics has been largely 
studied using in vitro cell lines or in vivo IFN-α/β receptor knockout (IFNAR−/−) mouse 
model35, however, none of these systems may fully recapitulate human blood infection. 
Specifically, the host target cells of ZIKV infection and the acute immune responses of 
blood following an infectious mosquito bite have not been well-studied. Hence, to overcome 
this issue, we utilized an in vitro human whole blood infection approach that mimics the 
natural infection setting of ZIKV viremia in humans. This approach has been shown to be an 
effective platform for dissecting acute host immunity mediated against viruses, such as 
Chikungunya virus and vaccinia virus36,37. Although the whole blood infection approach has 
been a useful in vitro model for studying blood immunity, the caveat of this approach is the 
inability to access the infectivity of non-PBMCs population, such as short-lived 
granulocytes. Here, we identified CD14+ monocytes as the primary target cells of acute 
ZIKV infection. Furthermore, higher viral burdens were detected in CD14+ monocytes 
infected with African lineage ZIKV strain than in those infected with the Asian lineage 
ZIKV strain. The mechanisms responsible for this difference of replication kinetics between

 African lineage ZIKV vs. Asian lineage ZIKV in human CD14+ monocytes are under 
investigation.
Blood monocytes have been shown to be a favorable cellular target for several other viruses, 
such as influenza A virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and vaccinia virus, while viral infections 
rapidly trigger differentiation of monocytes into DCs38. Recently, Asian ZIKV infection of 
non-human primates was shown to trigger a peak of CD16+ monocytes activation at 2 days 
post infection39. Here we showed that in human blood, both lineages of ZIKV strains 
triggered the specific expansion of CD14lo CD16+ non-classical monocytes, but not the 
CD14hi CD16+ intermediate monocyte population. While African lineage ZIKV promoted a 
modest expansion of non-classical monocytes, it targeted intermediate monocytes as the 
preferred monocyte subset that specifically induced CXCL10-associated M1-skewed 
inflammatory responses. Surprisingly, despite a lower viral burden and infectivity, Asian 
lineage ZIKV infection led to the large expansion of non-classical monocytes, the 
suppression of type I IFN-signaling pathway and the promotion of IL-10-associated M2-
skewed immunosuppressive phenotype. Similar to other mosquito-borne RNA viruses, this 
immunophenotype was likely due to a bystander effect. Previous studies have demonstrated 
that the infection of a small subset of blood cells with chikungunya virus is sufficient to 
trigger the robust activation of monocytes, leading to a cytokine storm37,40. In addition, 
previous studies of HIV-1 infection-elicited immunodeficiency have suggested the possible 
pathogenic involvement of CD16+ monocytes through differentiation into M2 
macrophages41. An expanded population of CD16+ monocytes have been specifically 
observed in HIV patients who experienced high viremia, while patients who maintained 
undetectable viremia showed reduced CD14lo CD16+ non-classical monocyte 
populations42,43. Just as the poor prognosis of HIV infection is closely associated with 
uncontrolled viremia, the high viremia of ZIKV has also been associated with lethality in 
patients with pre-existing medical conditions44. The unexpected resemblance of monocyte 
expansion and responses elicited by Asian ZIKV or HIV infection suggests that Asian ZIKV 
may trigger a certain degree of immunosuppression, whereby an inadvertent exacerbated 
disease outcome may occur in patients with underlying immune-altering conditions.
Pregnancy is a sophisticated biological process that relies on maternal-initiated 
immunosuppression towards the growing fetus particularly during early to mid-stages of 
pregnancy to ensure a healthy birth. Recent clinical study on 131 pregnant ZIKV+ patients 
has demonstrated that maternal viral burden or disease severity is not underlying risk factors 
for the development of fetal abnormalities45. However, prolonged ZIKV viremia during the 
first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with fetal abnormalities46,47, suggesting that 
the pregnancy stage of ZIKV infection may be risk determinant for ZIKV-associated birth 
defects. Interestingly, infection of blood obtained from pregnant women, particularly those 
who were in their first trimester of pregnancy, exhibited enhanced viremia following African 
or Asian ZIKV infection. These suggest that a higher viral burden would require longer time 
to be cleared from the peripheral system, leading to prolong viremic phase. Since monocytes 
from pregnant women did not show an obvious increase in infectivity, slightly reduced IFN-
β level during pregnancy may contribute to an enhanced viral burden. Indeed, ZIKV has 
been widely known to be highly sensitive to type I IFN signaling pathways48,49. In addition, 
it has been shown that pregnancy alone can induce the expansion of intermediate/non-

 classical monocytes with a declined classical subset50. Intriguingly, Asian ZIKV infection 
triggered pronounced changes in blood immunity specifically during the first and second 
trimester of pregnancy, which further promoted the dramatic expansion of CD14lo CD16+ 
non-classical monocytes and the apparent production of the IL-10 cytokine. The early to 
mid-stages of healthy pregnancies occur in a Th2-bias environment where IL-10 expression 
modestly increases to elicit a subtle immunosuppressive effect. However, the abundant 
production of IL-10 in response to Asian ZIKV is likely to do more harm than good in 
regards to the pregnancy outcome, as many viruses have been shown to exploit the elevated 
levels of IL-10 as a means to promote viral persistency and to dampen host defenses51–53. 
Increased IL-10 levels have been detected in the amniotic fluid of pregnant ZIKV patients 
who had microcephalic fetuses or neonates54. The highest frequencies of reported ZIKV-
induced fetal defects were observed when ZIKV infection occurred in the first and second 
trimesters of pregnancy25,26. Hence, we hypothesize that the expression of certain genes 
potentially detrimental to pregnancy may be induced in the first and second trimester 
specifically following Asian ZIKV infection. Indeed, the comparison of host genes uniquely 
induced by Asian ZIKV in monocytes from women in the first and second trimesters 
revealed high expressions of two pregnancy-detrimental genes – ADAMTS9 and FN1. 
ADAMTS9 plays a crucial role in vascular remodeling during pregnancy27. Elevated 
ADAMTS9 expression has been implicated in placental abnormalities, leading to pre-term, 
small birth weight and/or labor arrest disorders28,29. Increased levels of FN1 are found in 
pregnant women suffering from pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and fetal 
growth restriction30,31. Surprisingly, we also found that ZIKV+-viremic or -viruric pregnant 
women showed elevated serum FN1 levels throughout all trimesters of pregnancy (Fig. 6e). 
Hence, our findings suggest the potential pathogenic roles of pregnancy-detrimental genes 
such as ADAMTS9 and FN1 contributing to ZIKV-associated congenital defects.
Currently, all epidemic strains of disease-associated ZIKV belong to the Asian lineage55. 
Our data demonstrate a stark contrast in blood immunity elicited following infection with 
different lineage ZIKV strains, especially during pregnancy. Specifically, Asian lineage 
ZIKV infection led to the profound expansion of non-classical monocytes, an M2-skewed 
immunosuppressive phenotype of infected monocytes, and the aberrant expression of 
pregnancy detrimental genes. While this study provides a better understanding of how Asian 
ZIKV manipulates the host immunity which ultimately leads to adverse pregnancy 
outcomes, it does not negate the role of inflammatory properties induced by African ZIKV 
infection. The robust induction of CXCL10-associated M1 inflammatory responses during 
African ZIKV infection resembles many acute inflammatory conditions such as those seen 
in infections with West Nile virus56 and Japanese encephalitis virus57. In a healthy 
pregnancy, M1 polarization occurs in the third trimester prior to full term birth11. Overt 
inflammation during early to mid-stages of pregnancy can lead to preterm birth58. Thus, this 
suggests the possibility of complicated pregnancy outcomes regardless of African or Asian 
ZIKV infection. In summary, our study identified the primary cellular target of ZIKV in the 
human blood and characterized the heightened sensitivity of maternal monocytes to this 
virus during pregnancy. This potentially brings new directions for additional immunological 
studies of ZIKV infection-induced host immunity during pregnancy, which should be

 instrumental for developing future therapeutic interventions for improved pregnancy and 
fetal outcomes.
Methods
Human subjects and blood collection
Peripheral blood specimens were obtained from healthy donors aged 18 to 39 years old and 
stored temporarily at 37 °C in lithium heparin-containing tube (BD) prior to infection. Blood 
specimens used in Figure 1–4 were obtained from male and female subjects of equal 
distribution. Pregnant subjects were recruited at Los Angeles County (LAC) + University of 
Southern California (USC) Medical Center, with the following exclusion criteria: (i) 
vaccination within last 14 days, (ii) suspected/recent illness within last 14 days, (iii) steroid 
administration during pregnancy, (iv) immunodeficiency/immunocompromised conditions, 
(v) autoimmune disorders, and (vi) suspected fetal anomalies. Pregnancy was categorized 
into three trimesters based on the following: first trimester <12 weeks, second trimester 12–
28 weeks and third trimester >28 weeks. Blood serum specimens from 30 symptomatic 
ZIKV+ pregnant women, 10 from each trimester, were collected from pregnant women who 
were admitted to the acute febrile illness clinic at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation exhibiting 
rash that had developed within the previous 5 days. All patients were confirmed to be ZIKV-
positive following the performance of reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay in blood 
or urine which utilized specific probe and primers for ZIKV detection59. Serum aliquots 
from these patients were stored at −80 °C until the performance of the present experiments. 
Written and oral informed consents were obtained prior to the collection of whole blood, 
sera and urine specimens from healthy individuals and ZIKV+ pregnant patients, and study 
protocols were approved by institutional review boards of the USC Institutional Review 
Board (IRB), Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz) and the University of California, Los 
Angeles (UCLA).
Viruses
African ZIKV strains MR766 (Uganda, 1947) and IbH30656 (Nigeria, 1968), as well as 
Asian ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico, 2015) virus stocks were purchased from 
ATCC. Asian ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (French Polynesia, 2013) was kindly provided by Dr. 
Michael Diamond (Washington University School of Medicine). All ZIKV virus stocks were 
propagated in Vero cell line (ATCC CCL-81, ATCC) and supernatant was harvested at 3–5 
dpi. The viral titers were determined by plaque assays on Vero cells. Vero cells were 
authenticated by morphology check and growth curve analysis, and validated to be 
mycoplasma-free using Hoechst staining.
In vitro whole blood infection and PBMCs/plasma isolation
Anti-coagulated whole blood specimens were diluted in equal volume of serum-free RPMI 
(Gibco) prior to ZIKV infection at MOI 0.1 or 1. PBMCs count per ml of whole blood per 
donor was counted prior to infection with the appropriate amount of virus. Blood specimens 
were incubated at 37 °C with intermittent shaking for 24 or 40 hpi. Isolation of PBMCs or 
plasma were performed by density gradient centrifugation using SepMate (STEMCELL) 
and lymphocyte separation medium (Corning). Plasma specimens were collected and stored

 at −80°C prior to use. PBMCs were further processed for RNA extraction, FACS staining or 
cell sorting. In this study, total cell population rather than sorted ZIKV+ cells were used for 
all downstream analyses, and were generally termed as “ZIKV/MR766/H/PF2103-infected” 
specimens.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
Surface staining of PBMCs were performed with the following antibodies: CD45-BV421 
(clone HI30, Biolegend), CD14-AF488 (clone M5E2, Biolegend), CD56-PerCP-Cy5.5 
(clone 5.1H11, Biolegend), CD3-AF647 (clone HIT3a, Biolegend) and CD19-PerCP (clone 
HIB19, Biolegend). PBMCs specimens were either sorted based on surface markers 
expression using BD LSR III (BD) or proceed on to intracellular ZIKV staining for 
detection of ZIKV-infected cells. Indirect intracellular ZIKV staining was performed using 
pan flavivirus antibody (clone D1-4G2-4-15, EMD Millipore), followed by fluorescence-
conjugated secondary antibody. For profiling of monocyte subsets, separate surface staining 
for CD45-BV421, CD14-AF488 and CD16-AF647 (clone 3G8, Biolegend) were performed 
on PBMCs. All fluorescence-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Biolegend. FACS 
acquisitions were performed on BD FACSCanto II (BD), using BD FACSDIVA software. 
All FACS data was analyzed using FlowJo software.
RNA extraction, viral load and gene expression analyses
Total RNA extractions were performed using RNeasy mini/micro Kit (Qiagen) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop 1000 
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Extracted total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 
iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BIO-RAD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For 
viral load detection, specific ZIKV NS1 primers and probe targeting conserved NS1 region 
across all 4 ZIKV strains (MR766, IbH30656, H/PF/2013 and PRVABC59) were designed. 
Standard curve (101 to 108 NS1 copies/μl) was generated using serial dilutions of plasmid 
expressing MR766 NS1 protein. Viral load and gene expression qRT-PCR were performed 
with 10 ng of cDNA/well using SsoAdvanced Universal Probe Supermix (BIO-RAD) or iQ 
SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD), respectively. All qRT-PCR reactions were performed 
using BIO-RAD CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System on 96-well plates. 
Amount of viral load in specimens were interpolated from standard curve using Prism 
Graphpad software. All viral load qRT-PCR performed in this study included mock controls 
in which no CT values could be detected. Gene expression fold change was calculated with 
the ΔΔCt method using Microsoft Excel. Briefly, ΔΔCt = ΔCt(ZIKV-infected)–ΔCt(mock 
control) with ΔCt = Ct(gene-of-interest)—Ct(housekeeping gene-GAPDH). The fold change 
for each gene is calculated as 2−ΔΔCt. All primers and probe sequences used in this study is 
available upon request.
Pan monocyte isolation and human myeloid gene expression analysis
Total monocyte population was isolated from PBMCs using Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit 
(Miltenyi Biotec), according to manufacturer’s instructions. nCounter assay using Human 
Myeloid Panel (650 genes) (NanoString Technologies) was performed using 1.5 μl of 
monocyte lysates in RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) of ~6500 cells/μl, according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression analyses were performed using NanoString

 nSolver software. Background was eliminated by subtracting mean nCounter counts of 
negative controls supplied in the kit, across counts of all specimens. Gene expressions were 
expressed as fold change relative to controls (mock-infected specimens). Genes with fold 
change > 1.5 is considered to be induced. The NanoString gene analysis data were deposited 
in the NCBI GEO database under the accession code GSE101718.
Multiplex immunoassay and ELISA
Serum levels of human IL-12 p40, IL-10, sCD163 and YKL-40 were detected using Bio-
plex multiplex immunoassay (BIO-RAD). Human CXCL10 and IL-10 ELISA assays 
(Biolegend) were performed on plasma specimens according to manufacturer’s instructions. 
Human FN1 ELISA assay (LSBio) was performed on serum specimens according to 
manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. For analyses 
between 2 groups, Mann-Whitney U test were used. For comparisons among more than 2 
groups, either one-way or two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test was used.
Data availability
