Exploring the Industry-Dermatologist Financial Relationship
Insight From the Open Payment Data

I
n today’s complex economic and health care environ-
ment, the interactions between physicians, hospitals, and
health care manufacturing companies are under in-
creased scrutiny. Under the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires
manufacturers and group-purchasing organizations that make
products reimbursed by a government-run health program to
report on all payments and other transfers of value to physi-
cians in categories, such as consulting, speaking fees, food,
travel, and research.1 Specifically, amounts greater than $10
or aggregates of payment greater than $100 during a calendar
year are mandatory reports.1
Industry-physician interaction is common in all medical
specialties, and dermatology is no exception.2-4 While the
types of interaction between dermatologists and industry
have been described,2,4 there is very little literature on the
amount and geographic distribution of financial distribu-
tions by industry to dermatologists. To better understand
the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of physician
payments from industry sources, we probed the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Sunshine Act Open
Payments database, the largest public nationwide database
detailing financial relationships of industry and physicians
and the first of its kind.
The purpose of this study was to characterize the extent
and nature of industry payments to dermatologists for 2014,
the first year that a full 12 months of financial data have been
released. Specifically, we examined the number, amount, and
IMPORTANCE Significant ties exist between clinicians and industry. Little is known about the
characteristics of industry payments to dermatologists.
OBJECTIVE To analyze the nature and extent of industry payments to dermatologists.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a retrospective review using the publicly
available Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Sunshine Act Open Payment
database. Data were downloaded from the publically available CMS website under General
Payment and Research Payment data sets. All payments to dermatologists from companies
making products reimbursed by a government-run health program were reviewed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean, median, and range of payments made, including
quantity and total sum of payments, per clinician. Total payments and number of transactions
per category of payment, geographic region, and payment source were also assessed.
RESULTS A total of 8333 dermatologists received 208 613 payments totaling more than
$34 million. The median total payment per dermatologist was $298 with an interquartile
range of $99 to $844. The top 10% of dermatologists (n = 833) received more than $31.2
million, 90% of the total payments. The top 1% each (n = 83) received at least $93 622 and
accounted for 44% of total payments. While 83% of payment entries were for food and
beverage, they accounted for only 13% of total amount of payments. Speaker fees (31.7%),
consulting fees (21.6%), and research payments (16.5%) comprised 69.8% of total payment
amount. The top 15 companies were all pharmaceutical manufacturers and paid
dermatologists $28.7 million, representing 81% of total disbursement.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dermatologists received substantial payments from the
pharmaceutical industry. The nature and amount of payments varied widely. The impact of
the data on patient care, physicians practice patterns, and patient perception of physicians
is unclear.

type of payments dermatologists received, the geographic dis-
tribution of industry payments, and the manufacturers that
are contributing the highest total payments.
Methods
In this retrospective database analysis, we used publicly
available data from the CMS Sunshine Act Open Payments,5
which contains records of payments to physicians by appli-
cable medical manufacturers or group-purchasing organiza-
tions operating in the United States. We used the general
payment and research payment data sets from 2014, which
contains payments made between January 1, 2014, and
December 31, 2014. The data within do not contain physi-
cian ownership and/or investment interests, which can be
found in a separate database on the Open Payments web-
site, because these payments may be reported without
adequate context for interpretation. Payments without an
associated clinician were excluded from the study. After fil-
tering the payment data by the physician’s primary spe-
cialty and excluding payment data made to physicians who
were not classified as practicing dermatology in the Open
Payment physician profile data file, the data were down-
loaded. To ensure uniformity, one individual (H. F.)
reviewed and collected the information from the database.
Data management and analysis were performed with Micro-
soft Excel software (Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011, version
14.2.3; Microsoft Corp). Information on sex and academic
affiliation of payment recipients was obtained from internet
searches. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, inter-
quartile range (IQR), and percentages were calculated. We
chose to use primarily median and IQR instead of mean and
standard deviation to describe data because of skewed
distribution.
Geographicanalysisofpaymentdatawasconductedbased
on divisions created by the US Census Bureau: New England
(Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode
Island,andVermont),Mid-Atlantic(NewJersey,NewYork,and
Pennsylvania), East North Central (Illinois, Indiana, Michi-
gan, Ohio, and Wisconsin), West North Central (Iowa, Kan-
sas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South
Dakota), South Atlantic (Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Mary-
land,NorthCarolina,SouthCarolina,Virginia,Washington,DC,
and West Virginia), East South Central (Alabama, Kentucky,
Mississippi, and Tennessee), West South Central (Arkansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas), Mountain (Arizona, Colo-
rado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyo-
ming), Pacific (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Wash-
ington). Puerto Rico, US military bases abroad, and US Virgin
Islands are classified under Other. Divisions were used in-
stead of regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) to bet-
ter provide more detailed insight of geographic payment
differences. Geographic data were based on the state listed in
the physician profile data file.
The New York University School of Medicine's institu-
tional review board reviewed this study and granted it
exempt status.
Results
A total of 208 613 payments totaling $34 810 661.57 were made
to 8333 dermatologists in 2014. This represented 0.54% of the
total $6.49 billion disbursement and 1.8% of the 11.41 million
records of all industry payment to clinicians.
For dermatology, the median amount per payment was
$15.93 (IQR, $10.89-$25.94) with the minimum and maxi-
mum payment per entry of $0.00 and $249 641.60, respec-
tively. The mean (SD) amount per payment was $171 ($1400).
Seventy-nine percent of payments were less than $50 and
94.6% of payments were less than $500. The distribution of
payments is shown in Table 1.
The median total industry payment to each dermatolo-
gist was $297.59 (IQR, $99.10-$843.58) (mean [SD], $4177.45
[$22 527.43]). The median (mean) number of payment per der-
matologist was 10 (25). In total, 25%, 63%, 78%, and 91% of
dermatologists received less than $100, $500, $1000, and
$5000, respectively. The top 10% of dermatologists receiving
payments (n = 833) each received at least $3940 and ac-
countedforover$31.2millionintotalpayments,or90%oftotal

Physicians have the option of reviewing and challenging
the accuracy of the published data. In 2014, 7 physicians dis-

Key Points
Question What are the characteristics of industry payments to
dermatologists?
Findings In this retrospective study, 8333 dermatologists
received 208 613 payments totaling more than $34 million, with
the median total payment per dermatologist of $298. The
payment distribution is highly skewed, with a minority of
dermatologists receiving most of the total payments from
pharmaceutical companies.
Meaning There are potential conflicts of interest among
dermatologists.

greatest share of all payments. These services included serv-
ing as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continu-
ing education program (29.9%). Consulting services received
21.6% of all payments, followed by payments for research ac-
tivities (16.5%), and food and beverages (13.3%). The greatest
number of payments made was for food and beverages at
172 690 disbursements. The 3 categories with the largest single
payment amount were research ($249 642), consulting fees
($235 674), and royalty or license fees ($83 903). The distribu-
tion of payment categories by physician affiliations with aca-
demic center and private practice for the top 10% (n = 833) der-
matologists receiving industry payments is shown in Table 3.
In total, 279 companies with distinct payment identifi-
cation numbers made payments to dermatologists. The top
15, 10, and 5 companies accounted for $28.7 million (82.3%),
$25.1 million (72.0%), and $18.6 million (53.5%) of the total
payment, respectively. The top 15 manufacturers by total
payment amount were all pharmaceutical companies. Their
total payment amounts and payment type distributions are
shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. A physician
may direct a company to pay another entity instead of the
physician. When this occurs, many payments attributed to
the third-party entity are for biologic medications and small
molecules.
The highest number and sum of payments went to der-
matologists in the Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Pacific
areas.Themeanpaymentreceivedperdermatologistwashigh-
est in the Mid-Atlantic ($5277) and East South Central ($5106).
Dermatologists in the West North Central division received the
lowest total payment per individual.

Discussion
In recent years, legislative measures at the state and national
level have been implemented to make relationships between
physicians and industry more transparent.1,6,7 In this study,
we demonstrated that interactions between industry and
dermatologists are widely prevalent and highly variable,
with a small fraction of dermatologists receiving a large
share of all payments. With roughly 11 363 active dermatolo-
gists in the United States8 and 8333 dermatologists (73.3%)
receiving payment in this study, those without industry
interaction are in the minority. The high percentage of physi-
cians receiving industry payment is consistent with a
national survey across all specialties.9 There are variations
across specialties, but the percentage of physicians receiving
payments in dermatology is similar to those of other proce-
dural specialties.10-13 While dermatologist-industry interac-
tion resulted in $34.8 million worth of transactions, pay-
ments ranged widely across recipients. Sixty-three percent
of dermatologists received less than $500 in compensation,
and a small fraction received a disproportionately large per-
centage of total payments to the specialty. This positively
skewed distribution of industry payments has also been
observed in other specialties.10-15 Most individual payments
were relatively small, with 79% of payments less than $50
and median amount of $15.93, reflecting payments primarily
for food and beverages. This was also consistent with data

from other specialties.10-14 The large standard deviation of
payments reflects wide variation in payment amounts.
Although food and beverage payments comprised 83% of
the number of payments made, they made up only 13% of the
total payment amount to the specialty as a whole. This find-
ing is consistent with other specialties.9,10,13-15 Interestingly,
patients may view payments of food more negatively.14,16,17
Studies show that patients often interpret food and beverage
as a personal gift to the physician without direct benefit to pa-
tients. Themes of dishonesty and selfishness seem to be at the
center of patient concerns.16,17 Compensation for speaking ar-
rangements and consulting fees made up over half of the total
payment amount to the specialty, compared with a much more
modest 16.5% for research. Consulting and speaking arrange-
ments brought in the highest median payment per category,
at $1360 and $1500 each, respectively. These amounts do not
take into account nonfinancial gains accrued from these ac-
tivities, such as publicity or the perception of becoming a more
notable figure in the field. For companies, having key knowl-
edge holders and thought leaders being advocates and spokes-
personsmayhelpshiftclinicalpractices.9,18Infact,studieshave
shown that patients see the physician with this association
positively, viewing him or her at the forefront of the field and
being an influential figure.17,19,20 The exact nature of the con-
sulting fees and agreements are not described in the data-
base, preventing a full understanding of the relationship. The
amount and percentage of total payouts for royalties and pat-
ent licenses to dermatologists were less compared with pay-
outs for ophthalmologists and orthopedic surgeons.12,14 The
exact nature of research compensation cannot be discerned
owing to lack of reporting uniformity across companies, but
the available data suggest that most research payments were
for the study of safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of vari-
ous medications, including small molecules, biological medi-
cations, topical acne medications, and injectable neuromodu-
lators. It is unclear what expenses the research payments
actually covered, such as stipend, supplies, equipment, clini-
cal study services, publication support, travel expenses, and
meeting costs.
Both dermatologists affiliated with academic centers and
those with private practices received industry payments. How-
ever, among the top 10% of all payment recipients (n = 833),
only 16.6% of these were academic dermatologists. Given that
approximately 6% of the nation’s dermatologists work in
academic settings,21 their disproportionately higher represen-
tations among top industry payment recipients may be re-
lated to their position as thought leaders. This idea is sup-
ported by the fact that 45.3% of payments made toward
dermatologists at academic centers were in the form of con-
sulting fees, compared with 18.2% for those in private prac-
tice. However, among the same top recipients, those affili-
atedwithprivatepracticesreceivedahigherpercentageoftheir
total payments for research and non–continuing medical edu-
cation program speaking fees than their counterparts at aca-
demic centers. Sex differences in the amount of money re-
ceived from industry have been reported.22 In dermatology,
men outnumbered women among top industry payment re-
cipients, although apparently less than in other fields.23,24
Recent research examined sex disparities in academic derma-
tology, specifically looking at principal investigator funding
from the National Institutes of Health.25 More granular
research on sex and industry connections would be useful.
It is important to note that there is likely variability in the
classification of payment activities among companies, as evi-
denced by the uneven payment distribution across catego-
ries by different companies. For example, consulting fees and
speaker fees were prominent for some companies, whereas
honoraria were prominent for others. The CMS defines con-
sulting fees as payments made “for advice and expertise on a
particularmedicalproductortreatment,typicallyprovidedun-
der a written agreement and in response to a particular busi-
ness need,” speaking fees as those made “for speaking, train-

with industry to advance the field and address skin diseases.
More than ever, investigators will need to adhere to rigorous
standardsofintegrityandtransparencytomanagepotentialcon-
flictsofinterestintoday’sresearchenvironment.TheOpenPay-
ment database can be used to help verify that physician inves-
tigators are disclosing their sources of financial support and
potential conflicts of interest.
The15highest-payingmanufacturersandmostofthecom-
paniesmakingpaymentstodermatologistsintheOpenPayment
data set belong to the pharmaceutical industry. The predomi-
nance of pharmaceutical payments in dermatology contrasts
sharply with other specialties, such as otolaryngology,11 ortho-
pedic surgery,12,15 and ophthalmology,14 in which surgical and
diagnostic manufacturers play a larger role. It should not come
asanysurprisethatsurgicalsubspecialtiesthatdependontech-
nology for operative success also received a proportionally
highershareofpaymentsfromdevicemanufacturers.Similarly,
it is not surprising that pharmaceutical companies have finan-
cial incentives to promote their medications to dermatologists
given the profitability, frequent use, and large number of pa-
tients who depend on topical and systemic medications for
skinailments.Becausetreatmentwithlasersandothercosmetic
instruments is generally not reimbursed by government-
sponsoredinsurances,companiesspecializingintheseareasare

There were significant regional differences in the total
amount of payments made to dermatologists. This likely re-
lates to the high number and concentration of dermatolo-
gists,academicmedicalcenters,andpatientpopulationsinthe
Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Pacific areas. Regional pay-
ment distribution varies by specialty.11,14,15
While the primary advantage of this study is the use of na-
tionwidepaymentinformation,ithasseverallimitations.Since
the Sunshine Act requires reporting only by companies mak-
ingproductscoveredbygovernment-sponsoredprograms,such
as Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram, the data represent only a fraction of the total physician-
industry financial relationships. Cosmetic devices and lasers,
for example, are not included. Furthermore, the database re-
lies on accurate reports from manufacturers. There may be in-
accurate attribution of payments into categories, individuals,
or affiliated institution by reporting companies on the data-
base. Although physicians have the option of reviewing and
challengingtheaccuracyofthepublisheddata,itisunclearhow
many have done so. Physicians have been known to encounter
challenges while registering with the CMS to dispute claims.1,7
These data do not include payments to medical students, resi-
dents, nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists. How-
ever,interactionsbetweendermatologyresidentsandpharma-
ceutical companies are common in the form of sponsored
dinners,board-reviewmaterials,samples,andconferences.2The
industryhasankeeninteresttotargetyoungphysiciansintrain-
ing as they develop their own prescription and disease treat-
ment patterns.30 Finally and most importantly, while the da-
tabase provides certain valuable insights as outlined herein, it
does not offer an opportunity to accomplish the important and
difficult task of differentiating nonbeneficial or even harmful
relationshipsfrombeneficialonesthatadvancescientificknowl-
edge and improve patient care.31-34 Not all industry payments
should be viewed the same way, and the relative dearth of con-
textualinformationoftenmakestheinterpretationofeachpay-
ment difficult, especially when considering that dermatolo-
gistswhodidnotreceiveindustrypaymentsareintheminority.
While we have limited data in dermatology, recent studies35,36
in other fields show that receipt of industry payments and in-
dustry-sponsored meals was associated with an increased rate
of prescribing several class of brand-name medications. Simi-
lar investigations into dermatologic medications would be
of interest.
Conclusions
Seventy-three percent of dermatologists received payments
from industry with 63% receiving less than $500. The rela-
tionships between dermatologists and industry are varied,
complex, and robust. This study helps to delineate the spe-
cific nature and extent of industry payments to dermatolo-
gists nationwide. We encourage all physicians to review their
OpenPaymentsdataathttps://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov.We
hope this study will promote discussions among physicians,
regulators, and the public regarding various topics such as na-
tional policies, physician behaviors, and potential for con-
flict of interest. Ultimately, the impact of financial disclosure
from industry to dermatologists, and physicians in general, re-
mains to be seen. Further investigations examining the im-
pact on clinician behavior, outcomes of clinical care, and
patient perception are merited.
