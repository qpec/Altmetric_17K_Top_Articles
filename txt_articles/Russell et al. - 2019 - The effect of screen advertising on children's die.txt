Summary
Evidence indicates that screen advertising for unhealthy food results in significant
increases in dietary intake among children. This review was undertaken with the main
aim of estimating the quantitative effect of screen advertising in experimental and
nonexperimental conditions on children's dietary intake.
Systematic searches were undertaken of interdisciplinary databases. Studies from
1980 to April 2018, all geography and languages, were included; participants were
children and adolescents aged between 2 and 18 years; the intervention was screen
advertising; and the outcome was dietary intake. Meta‐analyses were conducted for
measured and nonmeasured outcomes.
Food advertising was found to increase dietary intake among children (age range
2‐14, mean 8.8 years) in experimental conditions for television (TV) advertising and
advergames. Meta‐analysis revealed that children exposed to food advertising on TV
(11 studies) and advergames (five studies) respectively consumed an average 60.0 kcal
(95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1‐116.9) and 53.2 kcal (95% CI, 31.5‐74.9) more than
children exposed to nonfood advertising. There was also an effect by body mass index
(BMI). Findings from nonexperimental studies revealed that exposure to TV food
advertising was positively associated with and predictive of dietary intake in children.
Short‐term exposure to unhealthy food advertising on TV and advergames increases
immediate calorie consumption in children.

INTRODUCTION
There is a substantial burden of illness and disease resulting from
poor diet, which is estimated to account for 40.0% of non-
communicable diseases across Europe.1 Rates of childhood obesity
have been rapidly increasing, and in 2016, there were an estimated
340 million children aged 5 to 19 in the world living with overweight
or obesity.2 Food and drink marketing is a vast global industry, and
evidence indicates disproportionate marketing of products with high
sugar, fat, and salt content.3 Children are exposed to a high volume
of marketing and advertising, a substantial proportion of which is
for unhealthy foods.4
Television (TV) viewing among children has been found to predict
obesity even when levels of physical activity are controlled for,5 which
suggests it is not just the effect of a sedentary lifestyle that increases
the risk factors for weight gain. Research has shown that exposure to
unhealthy food advertising, at least under experimental conditions,
results in significant increases in food consumption, particularly
energy‐dense, low‐nutrient foods, and that increases are greatest
among children with obesity.6-9

 This review sought to establish the effect size of screen advertis-
ing on children and adolescents' dietary intake, body mass index (BMI),
or body composition by systemically reviewing the evidence in the
available literature. We aimed to extend previous work by including
data sources from business and economics databases and including
nonexperimental studies. Meta‐analyses were conducted, primarily
on experimental studies between exposure to unhealthy food and
nonfood advertising, where outcomes for dietary intake were pro-
vided in kcals or a convertible alternative.

METHODOLOGY
We conducted a high‐quality systematic review, adopting a rapid review
methodology in collaboration with the Evidence for Policy and Practice
Information Centre (EPPI‐Centre) at the Social Science Research Unit
of the UCL Institute of Education. EPPI‐Reviewer 4 software was used
to manage data and the review process, which facilitated a machine
learning approach and has the potential to substantially reduce screening
time.10 This study was registered with PROSPERO (registration number
CRD42018089228), and systematic review and meta‐analyses were
conducted and reported according to the PRISMA checklist.11
The practice and use of rapid systematic reviews are increasing
because of limitations in terms of size and practicality of full reviews.12
Some suggested methodological modifications include highly specific
research questions, use of search tools/software, and use of only
one reviewer.13 While some studies suggest rapid reviews do not
apply the same rigour as full systematic reviews,14 rapid reviews are
generally accepted to be useful and valid,15 and that, despite measures
to save time, compared with full reviews, incur no discernible impacts
on derived conclusions.13

Eligibility criteria, information sources, and
search strategy
Quantitative studies (experimental or nonexperimental “real world”)
were eligible for inclusion; population criteria were children and
adolescents (aged between 2 and 18 years); all geography, languages,
and studies between 1980 and April 2018 were included; intervention
criteria
were
screen
advertising
(including
TV,
cinema,
and
internet/advergames); and outcomes were dietary intake, BMI, and
body composition. Studies before 1980 were excluded as they were
likely to have limited relevance to the current relationship between
advertising exposure and obesity‐related behaviours. Published reports
and dissertations were not eligible as the peer review status of these
publications is unclear.
In January 2018 and April 2018, systematic searches were under-
taken of the following medicine, psychology, science, business, and
economics
electronic
databases:
PubMed/MEDLINE,
Cochrane
Library Web, CINAHL, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, JSTOR, Web of Science,
ProQuest,
Google
Scholar,
Emerald,
EconBiz
(including
RePec),
EconLit, Business Source Complete, and the World Advertising
Research Centre (WARC). Relevant search terms were used for elec-
tronic databases, and combinations of key search words were used
for Google scholar (provided as Supporting Information).
As part of the rapid review methodology, the primary reviewer
(S.R.) conducted the initial searches (January 2018), imported records
into reference manager software and EPPI‐Reviewer 4, and removed
duplicates; a secondary reviewer (H.C.) replicated the searches at a
later time to check the total records found from each data source.
Reference searches were also conducted on eligible articles and rele-
vant systematic reviews. Supplementary searches (April 2018) were
conducted by the primary reviewer. Articles were imported into
EPPI‐Reviewer 4 for screening, data extraction, and analysis.

Study selection
Exclusion criteria were date (pre‐1980), participant age group (adults),
intervention (nonscreen forms of advertising or marketing), study type
(reports, systematic reviews, or dissertations), and outcome measure
(food choice, preference, pester power, food advertisement recall,
etc). Articles were included if all other criteria were met and if studies
gave a quantitative measure or estimate of the outcome variable
(dietary intake, body composition, or BMI).
Two reviewers (S.R. and R.I.) independently screened on title
and/or abstract for three days; discrepancies were jointly reconciled
by reviewers. Predictive algorithms built into EPPI‐Reviewer 4 soft-
ware learned and applied reviewer decisions; the resulting model
was applied to unscreened records throughout screening. Articles
were intermittently refreshed to allow machine learning to prioritise
unscreened items based on relevance denoted from include/exclude
codes. After the allocated screening period, a model classifier was built
within the software using include codes distinguished from exclude
codes and applied to all unscreened items. Scores based on relevance
(0‐100) were generated for all unscreened articles.
Articles were retrieved via web and library services and via direct
contact with authors; a total of seven papers could not be found and
were excluded. Full‐text screening was conducted by the primary
reviewer only. Two papers were translated into English.
Experimental studies with measured outcomes were deemed suit-
able for meta‐analysis if dietary intake in kcals was reported as an out-
come (or kJ/g where conversion was possible), and groups of children
exposed to food screen adverts (various low‐nutrient/unhealthy foods
or soft drinks) were compared with nonfood/neutral screen adverts
(eg, toys). Nonexperimental/real‐world studies were deemed suitable
for meta‐analyses if a quantitative relationship between food screen
advert exposure and dietary intake was explored.

Data extraction and items
Data were extracted by the primary reviewer (S.R.) using customised
EPPI‐Reviewer 4 extraction tools; data extraction was later replicated
(H.C.). Meta‐analyses were
conducted using R software EPPI‐
Reviewer 4 and with STATA v15 for presentation purposes.16 Corre-
sponding
authors were
contacted
where
additional data
were
required; nine authors were contacted for additional information, of
which eight responded and provided data.
Data extracted included study identification (authors, country,
and year of publication), target group (children and/or adolescents),

ing), and measures for dietary intake (kcal, kJ, grams, proportion con-

Assessment of quality
Experimental studies were required to have a nonfood advert control
group; studies that used neutral TV (no adverts) or no TV as control
conditions were not included, or subgroups were omitted from analy-
ses. Within study, quality was generally assessed, but direct compari-
sons could not be drawn because study designs varied. Allocation
method of participants was recorded for all between‐subject studies.
General assessments of quality were undertaken between studies;
however, rigorous appraisal was not possible owing to the variety of
research objectives between studies. While data may have been appro-
priate for meta‐analysis, the primary focus of the study may not have
been in relation to the effect of food advert exposure on dietary intake.
Risk of bias at study level for experimental papers was assessed
by the primary reviewer using Cochrane methods.17 Sources of bias
were assessed in terms of selection bias, performance bias, attrition
bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias, including study design.
To detect publication bias, the regression test of Egger et al18 for fun-
nel plot asymmetry was used with trim and fill method.19 Both tests
were run using R software within EPPI‐Reviewer 4.

Measures and data synthesis
2.5.1
|
Experimental studies
To be included in meta‐analyses, studies were required to compare
the effect of food screen advert exposure with nonfood screen advert
exposure, as measured by mean difference (kcals or convertible out-
come) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was deter-
mined using the I2 statistic. Owing to study design and measure
inconsistency, the DerSimonian‐Laird random‐effects model was used
for meta‐analysis for experimental studies. Separate meta‐analyses
were conducted for TV and advergame interventions. Within‐ and
between‐subject studies were combined, and sensitivity analyses
were conducted to assess the impact on overall effect size.
For
the
main
analyses
and
where
possible,
groups
were
combined to give an overall comparison for each study; age, sex,
BMI groups, and groups by child characteristics (eg, level of
inhibition) were combined. Data from substudies were not included
where interventions/preloads were administered (eg, “protective
messages”/glucose drinks). Outcome food groups were also combined
to give total dietary intake. Within‐ and between‐subject studies were
also combined in meta‐analyses. Where required and appropriate, the
Satterthwaite approximation was used to combine standard error
values for two groups. Studies with more than two relevant groups
were included as separate data points (two studies).
Screen advertisements were considered to be a consistent inter-
vention. All adverts were for low‐nutrient/energy‐dense products;
however, brands and products advertised varied, as did the advert
break and total advert duration. Data for a “light” food (low energy)
advert condition were excluded;20 data for branded and unbranded
food adverts were combined; data from a control condition where a
celebrity endorser was shown in a nonfood context were excluded;7
and data for healthy food adverts were excluded.21 Data from healthy
food adverts and no advergame control data were excluded;22,23 data
for advergames with food adverts/nonfood adverts with a protective
message intervention were excluded.24 Data for combined media
(the effect of TV adverts with advergame) were excluded since the
effect was inconsistent for TV or advergame analyses.25
In terms of the outcome, total intake of food groups were
combined in analyses to give an overall measure of dietary intake.
All studies appropriate for meta‐analysis (n = 16) provided one or
more unhealthy food product for participants to consume ad libitum.
Five studies also provided healthy food products, including fruit22,23
or fruit and wholegrain snacks;8,9,26 intake of such products was
included in the analyses as the outcome was considered at a caloric
rather than a nutrient level. Branded and nonbranded food groups
were combined.27 Studies were conducted with various levels of par-
ticipant satiety; all such data were pooled providing conditions were
consistent within studies.
In terms of participants, where overall totals were not reported,
groups were combined where it was reasonable to do so in order to
give overall effect sizes for each study. Sex groups were combined,28
BMI groups were combined,25 perceived high‐ and low‐maternal
encouragement groups were combined,20 and high‐ and low‐inhibition
groups were combined. Where it was not reasonable or statistically
possible to combine groups, subgroups within studies were included
as separate data points.24,28,29
2.5.2
|
Nonexperimental studies
Secondary meta‐analysis for nonexperimental studies was conducted
for correlation coefficients for food advert exposure and nonmeasured
outcomes of dietary intake. Intake of low‐nutrient high‐calorie foods
was pooled, including self‐reported measures or estimates of energy‐
dense food products,30,31 unhealthy advertised foods,32 fast food
and soft drink consumption,33 and unhealthy snacks.34 There were
insufficient data and lack of homogeneity for meta‐analyses to be con-
ducted for regression coefficients.
2.6

Additional analyses
The association between the effect size of dietary intake following TV
advert exposure and the exposure duration was plotted and tested
using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Exposure time was not
calculated for advergames as, in many studies, the playing time was
specified, but the playing speed varied between participants; there-
fore, children would not have been exposed to the same amount of
food cues over the given time. Also, food cues were not always embed-
ded into the game (peripheral to the child's attention); therefore, an
exposure duration/effect size relationship was not explored. Subgroup
556
RUSSELL ET AL.
 analyses of experimental data were undertaken to analyse the impact
of TV food advert exposure on dietary intake by BMI. Children with
overweight/obesity were grouped and compared with children with
healthy weight; significance was tested using chi‐square test. Data
were analysed using R software within EPPI‐Reviewer 4 and STATA v15.

Study selection
Figure 1 shows the flow chart of the review process. Searches yielded
a total of 5545 articles (5378 from initial searches and 167 from
supplementary searches in April 2018); 379 articles were included
for full‐text screening of a total of 1460 articles manually screened;
3703 were excluded by the machine learnt predictive algorithm. Appli-
cation of the classifier provided articles with scores ranging from 1 to
72 which were sorted descending and screened; three articles were
included as a result of this process (study scores were 72, 67, and
61), and all studies with scores of 60 and below were excluded. A total
of 382 articles were screened on full text; 25 articles were included
with measured outcomes for dietary intake (11 studies suitable for
meta‐analysis for TV advertising and five studies suitable for meta‐
analysis
for
advergames);
and
14
articles
were
included
with
nonmeasured (ie, estimated or self/parent‐reported) outcomes for die-
tary intake (five studies were suitable for correlation meta‐analysis and
five for regression meta‐analysis; however, the required data for meta‐
analysis of regression coefficients could not be retrieved).

Interventions
TV food adverts were embedded in cartoons (n = 12), nature shows
(n = 2), children's TV shows (n = 2), and a movie (n = 1); three studies
did not state the programme used. Total TV time ranged from 10 to
39 minutes, the mean time was 20.1 minutes. For studies included in
meta‐analysis, where stated (n = 8), advert duration ranged from
45 seconds to 8 minutes, the mean advert duration was 4.4 minutes.
Screen food advert interventions were for low‐nutrient, high‐energy
foods, including fast food products, savoury/potato snacks, cheese,
sweets/candies/chocolate,
cookies/muffins,
ice
cream/desserts,
breakfast cereals, or high sugar drinks. Specifically, branded food
products were used in adverts if integral to the research objectives
for the particular study.27
3.3.3
|
Outcomes
Food items for ad libitum consumption varied between experimental
studies; 13 studies offered only low‐nutrient, high‐energy foods (five
peanut M&Ms or chocolate, three candy and chocolate, three
potato/corn/wheat snacks, one pizza, one ice cream), nine studies
offered a selection of healthy and unhealthy snacks,21 and three
studies did not specify but reported a selection of foods. Ad libitum
consumption of food was during the intervention in 10 studies and
after the intervention in 15 studies. Where consumption took place
during the intervention, duration of snacking ranged between six and
39 minutes (mean 21.1 minutes); two studies did not state the dura-
tion of the intervention/ad libitum snacking. Where consumption took
place after the intervention, duration of snacking was five minutes
(n = 3), 15 minutes (n = 4), 20 minutes (n = 1), 30 minutes (n = 1), or
an unlimited time (n = 4); two studies did not state the duration of
ad libitum snacking.

Comparisons
Unhealthy food advertisements were compared with nonfood adver-
tisements in all studies included in television meta‐analysis (n = 11),
of which one study also included a comparison with an advert “light”
condition.20 Advergames with integrated food cues were compared
with games with nonfood cues in meta‐analysis (n = 5), of which three
studies also included comparisons with healthy food cues (n = 2), no
game controls (n = 2), and food and nonfood cues combined with pro-
tective messages (n = 1). Of studies not included in television or
advergame
meta‐analyses,
three
compared
food
adverts
with
healthy/pro/high‐nutrition foods, three to television with no adverts
and one to a no television condition.

Settings
Of the experimental studies, 18 used a between‐subject design and
seven used a within‐subject design; all studies allocated participants
randomly, except for one study where the experimental procedure
was unclear.44 Of those using within‐subject designs, number of
experimental sessions varied between two and six, and washout
periods ranged between one day and one month. Experimental studies
were conducted in schools (n = 12), laboratories or research trailers
(n = 9), holiday camps (n = 2), childcare facilities (n = 1), or community
settings (n = 1). Experiments were conducted in the United States
(n = 7), the Netherlands (n = 7), the United Kingdom (n = 5), Australia
(n = 2), Canada (n = 2), Spain (n = 1), Georgia (n = 1), and Mexico
(n = 1); one study contained separate samples in Spain and Netherlands,
which were included as separate studies in meta‐analysis.24

Meta‐analysis
Meta‐analysis revealed that for television and advergames combined,
food advertising, compared with nonfood advertising increased dietary
intake
among
children/adolescents
in
experimental
conditions
(Figure 2); mean difference 57.7 kcal (P < 0.01; 95% CI, 36.61‐78.75;
I2 = 99.7). The effect size point estimate for television food advertising
was 60.0 kcal (P < 0.05; 95% CI, 3.06‐116.94; I2 = 99.76). Funnel plots
showed some evidence of asymmetry and trim and fill analysis showed
evidence of one missing study. Eggers regression analysis revealed low
risk of publication bias (P = 0.696). The average time children were
exposed to television advertising (data available in n = 8 studies) was
4.4 minutes (range 45 seconds to 8 minutes; however, there was no
association between length of advert exposure and effect size (n = 9,
r = 0.056, P ≥ 0.05). The effect size point estimate for advergames
was 53.2 kcal (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 31.49‐74.85; I2 = 99.71); the mean
duration of advergames was five minutes, but it was not considered
reasonable to calculate an exposure duration/effect size relationship.
Funnel plots showed no evidence of asymmetry and trim and fill anal-
ysis showed evidence of no missing studies. Eggers regression analysis
revealed low risk of publication bias (P = 0.511).
Regression analyses were conducted to explore whether within‐
or between‐subject study design and ad libitum eating duration had
a significant effect on the variability of the effect size between stud-
ies. Study design was not found to be a significant predictor and there
was no significant difference in dietary intake for within‐ or between‐
subject studies (P > 0.05). Eating duration period was found to be a
significant
predictor of effect size; studies that gave children
15 minutes or less to eat during and/or post advertising exposure
reported significantly lower effect sizes (N = 19, coef = 1.50, SE = 0.69,
CI, 0.04‐2.97, I2 = 99.69, R2 = 17.17%).

Effects of BMI
Planned subgroup analyses were conducted on the effect size by BMI;
four studies provided appropriate data. Analyses revealed that the
effect size of television food advert exposure on dietary intake was
greater for children with overweight or obesity (mean difference
125.5 kcal, 95% CI, 18.80‐232.25), compared with children with
healthy weight (mean difference 79.9 kcal, 95% CI, 19.89‐179.66),
independent of experimental condition (Figure 3). Compared with
nonfood adverts, children with overweight or obesity consumed
an average 45.6 kcal more than children with healthy weight
following exposure to food adverts. Subgroup analysis revealed the

Other findings
The effect of advertising was reported by some studies to vary by sex;
however, the nature of the effect was inconsistent with some research
finding the effect size to be greater among girls,28 while others
reported the effect size to be greater among boys.36 The effect size
was reported to be greater for children with low neophobia compared
with high,21 highly impulsive compared with less impulsive children,29
and children with a relatively higher gaze duration or “attentional
bias”.39 Combined media (eg, a combination of exposure to television
food advertising and advergames) was reported to have a stronger
effect on children's dietary intake than television advertising alone;25
the same study reported that the increase in dietary intake following
advertising exposure was not compensated for at subsequent meals.
Food adverts for particular foods were reported to increase consump-
tion of those foods,40 when given the option, children were more likely
to consume low nutrient foods following television advertising,22,37
and consumption of food type was found to vary by BMI group.8 Chil-
dren were reported to quickly recognise brand names and recall the
content of food advertisements41 and were found to be responsive
to characters and make healthier choices if popular characters were
associated with healthier products.47 Celebrity endorsers were found
to be effective at increasing consumption of endorsed food, and the
effect was found to extend into nonfood contexts.27 Healthy food
adverts were not found to increase children's consumption of fruit or
vegetables.21 Parental behaviour, such as perceived encouragement
to be thin or controlling feeding practices, was reported to affect sus-
ceptibility to the effects of television advertising on dietary intake.20,46
Two studies conducted in Georgia and Mexico found no association
between television advertising and energy intake.42,45

Interventions
All studies considered the effect of television food advertising, except
one study that considered exposure to digital food marketing. Interven-
tion data were estimated from self‐reported surveys/questionnaires of
television time or advert exposure (n = 9), from a combination of self‐
report and secondary data (eg, advertising broadcast data; n = 2), or
from secondary data sources only (eg, company/media data; n = 3).
3.5.3
|
Outcomes
Reported outcomes included dietary intake (n = 12), BMI, or
overweight/obesity (n = 3). Of those reporting dietary intake, seven
studies reported unhealthy food consumption, four studies reported
healthy and unhealthy food consumption, and one study reported
healthy food consumption.
3.5.4
|
Settings
Study settings varied, some collected primary data, using parent or
child self‐report questionnaires (n = 11), others used longitudinal sur-
vey data (n = 2), one study used secondary data, and one was experi-
mental with nonmeasured outcomes (within‐subject design with
random allocation, supplemented with self‐report data).
3.5.5
|
Meta‐analysis—nonexperimental findings
Secondary meta‐analysis was conducted for the nonexperimental
studies reporting an association between television food advert expo-
sure and dietary intake (n = 5); there was a significant positive associ-
ation where the pooled mean correlation coefficient was r = 0.30 (95%
CI, 0.16‐0.45).
3.5.6
|
Other findings
Various studies found television food advertising to be associated with
dietary intake32-34,48,50,54 but not necessarily body weight.48 In one
study, the association between advertising exposure and dietary
intake was only found for lower income families.30 Consistent with
experimental findings, cumulative media, including television and
other sources, was positively linked to adolescent food intake.55
Various studies also found television food or soft drink advertising
exposure to be a significant positive predictor of dietary intake in
children after controlling for other factors.30,33,34,48 Contrary to exper-
imental findings, two studies reported exposure to healthy food
adverts was associated with fruit and vegetable consumption;33,53
the latter study also reported self‐control to be independently associ-
ated with dietary intake. Two studies reported parental mediation,
relating to guidance of food consumption or explaining the purpose
of advertising could be effective in mediating the influence of televi-
sion food advertising and associated dietary intake.31,54

DISCUSSION
In this rapid systematic review utilising machine learning including 25
experimental studies and 14 studies with nonmeasured outcomes, we
found that food advertising increased dietary intake in children under
experimental conditions when compared with exposure to nonfood
advertising. Exposure to 4.4 minutes of food advertising would on
average increase a child's food consumption by 60.0 kcal, whilst
playing an advergame with food cues for 5 minutes would increase
consumption by 53.4 kcal on average. The similarity of the estimate
across both subcategories suggests that this estimate is meaningful,
despite high heterogeneity which is likely to have arisen from the var-
iation in study designs, setting, total intervention time, and period
allowed for food intake. We were unable to identify a “dose” relation-
ship between unit of advertising exposure and resulting excess calorie
consumption. However, we note that advertising exposure in coun-
tries such as the United Kingdom is in excess of the experimental
RUSSELL ET AL.
565
 exposures in our included studies; commercial television in the United
Kingdom currently shows up to 12 minutes of advertising per hour57
and median television‐watching during weekdays for U.K. children
aged 7 to 15 years is 2 to 3 hours per day. Concerningly, children with
overweight or obesity appeared to be more vulnerable to the influ-
ence of advertising, consuming an average of 45.6 kcal more than
children with healthy weight when exposed to food advertising.
The point estimates for the effect size of television compared
with advergame advertising were highly similar, suggesting similar
effects, despite television watching being passive and with inter-
spersed advertising whilst playing advergames is active with advertis-
ing embedded throughout. Findings from the experimental studies
relate to the immediate effects of acute advertising, whereas children
in ‘normal life’ are exposed to various media in combination and over
longer periods of time. However, findings from the nonexperimental
studies similarly showed that exposure to television food advertising
was predictive of greater calorie intake in children.
4.1

Comparison with the literature
Our review is consistent with a previous review by Boyland et al;7 how-
ever, findings in that meta‐analysis were presented as standardised
mean difference, and this review included data from a number of addi-
tional studies. A broader review that included any form of marketing by
Sadeghirad et al58 found that 3.8 minutes of food marketing was asso-
ciated with an additional consumption of 30.4 kcals in children. These
analyses included a range of marketing (including games, packaging,
and sponsorship), and the effect size was calculated from fewer studies,
six compared with 16 in this review. The current review also analysed
the impact of screen advertising in “real world” studies' with
nonmeasured outcomes, thereby increasing the breadth and reliability
of evidence of the effect of screen advertising on dietary intake.
4.2
|
TV and advergames
Despite these differences, research has found no differences in the
persuasive effect of adverts on television or advergames.59 There
was evidence from experimental data that combined media of televi-
sion and advergames induces a greater effect on dietary intake.25
4.3
|
Mechanisms of food advertising
The mechanisms by which advertising affects eating behaviour in chil-
dren are unclear and are likely to vary by contextual and individual fac-
tors. However, recent research using functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) has revealed that the ventromedial prefrontal cortices
(vmPFC) in children's brains, functions of which include decision mak-
ing, reward valuation and self‐control, are activated significantly more
after watching television food advertisements.60 The same research
reported that following food advert exposure, food decisions by chil-
dren were made faster and tended to favour taste over health.60 In
addition to situational factors, eating behaviour in adults and children
is directed by impulsive and reflective decision making,61 and these
findings suggest that food advertisements may reduce the extent to
which children utilise reflective/inhibitory control systems, which are
negatively associated with risky eating behaviours, and promote
impulsive decision making, which is positively associated with risky
eating behaviours.62,63
4.4
|
Public health implications
There is a substantial burden of illness and disease resulting from
childhood overweight or obesity and a clear need for policy makers
to address this public health problem. There is clear evidence that
acute exposure to television food advertising increases immediate die-
tary intake, particularly of unhealthy foods. While there is a scarcity of
evidence relating to the long‐term effects of food advertising, reduc-
ing exposure both on television and via advergames is likely to
improve children's food choices, reduce intake of unhealthy foods,
and improve long‐term health outcomes.
4.5
|
Limitations
There may have been limitations in the rapid review methodology
adopted for this work; potential bias was reduced by utilising indepen-
dent reviewers for screening on title and abstract but machine learning
was used to exclude a large number of articles without screening on
title and abstract. Only one reviewer was used for full‐text screening,
but stringent criteria were thought to assist in reducing potential bias.
While justifiable in the context of this review, findings may also have
been limited by excluding studies from before 1980 and report
publications.
The number of studies included for meta‐analyses was relatively
small, variability was high and effects due to error cannot be
discounted. There were also small sample sizes for subgroup analyses
by BMI (subgroup samples ranged from 11 to 28 for groups of children
with overweight or obesity). Study heterogeneity was high and CIs
were large for television advertising meta‐analysis, indicating that
caution should be taken with these results overall. There was also a
limitation with advergame meta‐analysis since studies were all by the
same primary author.

CONCLUSIONS
The evidence from this research shows that television and advergame
screen advertising for unhealthy foods increases immediate dietary
intake in children. There appears to be an effect by BMI where dietary
intake of children with overweight or obesity increased to a greater
extent than children with healthy weight. Given children and adoles-
cents' changing use of media and unknown levels of advert exposure,
the longer‐term impacts of these reported effects in the real world are
difficult to determine. More research on the effect of advertising
duration and dose of exposure would be particularly useful, as would
longitudinal work which considers the longer‐term outcomes of adver-
tising exposure. While the extrapolation of these findings to real world
population is limited, this research is likely to have notable implications
for policy and practice.
