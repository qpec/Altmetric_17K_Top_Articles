Abstract
Rationale: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with several
pathophysiological deficits found in diabetic retinopathy (DR).
Hence, it’s plausible that OSA could play a role in the pathogenesis of
sight-threatening DR (STDR).
Objectives: To assess the relationship between OSA and DR in
patients with type 2 diabetes and to assess whether OSA is associated
with its progression.
Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted in diabetes clinics
within two U.K. hospitals. Patients known to have any respiratory
disorder (including OSA) were excluded. DR was assessed using two-
field 45-degree retinal images for each eye. OSA was assessed using a
home-based multichannel cardiorespiratory device.
Measurements and Main Results: A total of 230 patients were
included. STDR and OSA prevalence rates were 36.1% and 63.9%,
respectively. STDR prevalence was higher in patients with OSA than in
those without OSA (42.9% vs. 24.1%; P = 0.004). After adjustment for
confounders,OSAremainedindependentlyassociatedwithSTDR(odds
ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–4.9; P = 0.04). After a median
(interquartile range) follow-up of 43.0 (37.0–51.0) months, patients
with OSA were more likely than patients without OSA to develop
preproliferative/proliferative DR (18.4% vs. 6.1%; P = 0.02). After
adjustment for confounders, OSA remained an independent
predictor of progression to preproliferative/proliferative DR (odds
ratio, 5.2; 95% CI confidence interval, 1.2–23.0; P = 0.03). Patients
who received continuous positive airway pressure treatment were
significantly less likely to develop preproliferative/proliferative DR.
Conclusions: OSA is associated with STDR in patients with type 2
diabetes. OSA is an independent predictor for the progression
to preproliferative/proliferative DR. Continuous positive
airway pressure treatment was associated with reduction in
preproliferative/proliferative DR. Interventional studies are needed
to assess the impact of OSA treatment on STDR.

 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects 40 to 50%
of patients with diabetes, is a leading cause
of blindness in the Western world, and
results in significant morbidity and
economic burden (1, 2). Important risk
factors include age, poor glycemic control,
hypertension, diabetes duration,
dyslipidemia, and genetic factors (1, 3).
Although the precise etiology of DR
remains debated, increased inflammation,
oxidative stress, and activation of multiple
pathways are thought to result in functional
and/or structural defects involving the
microvasculature. These will increase
vascular permeability (which can lead
to macular edema) or cause ischemia
leading to increased vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) levels and
neovascularization (1, 4). Despite
improvements in the control of metabolic
and vascular risk factors, DR remains very
common (5), and a significant proportion
of DR cases progress to sight-threatening
diabetic retinopathy (STDR) (1).
Hence, improved understanding of the
pathogenesis of DR is important to identify
new treatment targets/strategies.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is very
common in patients with type 2 diabetes
(T2D) (6–10). We previously reported that
OSA is associated with peripheral
neuropathy, nephropathy, and estimated
glomerular filtration rate decline in patients
with T2D independently of obesity (10, 11).
We also previously showed that OSA is
independently associated with increased
nitrosative and oxidative stress as well as
impaired microvascular regulation in
patients with T2D (10). T2D is also a risk
factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia (12).
Hence, it seems reasonable to speculate that
OSA could play a role in the pathogenesis
STDR, particularly because OSA is
also associated with many of the
pathophysiological deficits found in DR
(including inflammation, oxidative stress,
and increased VEGF) (13–18).
The aims of this study were therefore to
determine the interrelationships of OSA and
STDR in subjects with T2D and to assess
whether OSA is associated with DR
progression. Some of the findings reported
in this paper were presented previously in
the form of an abstract (19).
Methods
We conducted an observational, cross-
sectional study that was converted to a
longitudinal, prospective study of subjects
with T2D. Patients with respiratory disease
(including prediagnosed OSA), end-stage
renal disease, or nondiabetic retinopathy
were excluded (Figure 1). Patients were
recruited consecutively from the outpatient
diabetes departments of two secondary
care hospitals in the United Kingdom
(Birmingham Heartlands Hospital and
Royal Stoke University Hospital). The
project was approved by the Warwickshire
Research Ethics Committee (REC number
08/H1211/145), and all patients provided
written informed consent.
OSA was assessed on the basis
of a single overnight home-based
cardiorespiratory study using a portable
multichannel device (Alice PDx; Philips
Respironics, Best, the Netherlands). Sleep
studies were scored in accordance with the
American Academy of Sleep Medicine
guidelines using the hypopnea definition of
greater than or equal to 4% oxygen
desaturation and greater than or equal to
30% reduction in nasal air flow signal (20).
Sleep studies with less than 4 hours of
adequate recordings were repeated, and if
the quality remained poor, they were
excluded from analysis. All sleep studies
were double scored manually, and further
scoring was performed in cases of
discrepancy by a consultant in sleep
medicine (A.A.). An apnea–hypopnea
index (AHI) greater than or equal to 5
events per hour was consistent with an
OSA diagnosis (21). OSA severity was
assessed on the basis of the AHI and the
oxygen desaturation index (ODI) based on
4% oxygen desaturation. OSA was classified
as mild, moderate, and severe on the basis
of AHI greater than or equal to 5 but less
than 15 events per hour, greater than or
equal to 15 but less than 30 events per hour,
and greater than or equal to 30 events per
hour, respectively. Data regarding
continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) treatment was collected as part of
routine care because all patients with
moderate to severe OSA at baseline were
referred to the sleep clinic in their
respective National Health Service trusts for
further assessment and decisions regarding
treatment. CPAP was offered to all patients
with moderate to severe OSA. CPAP use
data were obtained from the patients’
electronic records approximately 2.5 years
after the OSA diagnosis and referral to the
sleep clinic. CPAP use for more than 4
hours per night on 70% of days was
considered to indicate compliance (22).
DR/STDR was assessed using two-field
45-degree digital retinal images for each eye
in accordance with the English national
screening program guidelines (Table 1)
(23). The retinal images included in this
study were obtained during routine care
because patients with diabetes in England
are invited to undergo retinal imaging as
part of the national screening program once
per year. All retinal images were graded at
least twice, with further grading performed
in cases of discrepancy by a consultant
ophthalmologist. Patients with ungradable
images were examined by a consultant
ophthalmologist. STDR was defined as the
presence of preproliferative or proliferative
DR, maculopathy, or photocoagulation
(Table 1) (23). Advanced DR was defined as
having preproliferative (R2) or proliferative
(R3) DR.
The cross-sectional baseline
recruitment analysis designed to explore the
relationship between OSA and STDR was
conducted using data collected between
2009 and 2010. To explore the impact of
At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: Obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA) is known to be common in
patients with type 2 diabetes. Previous
studies showed a cross-sectional
association between OSA and diabetes-
related microvascular complications
(e.g., nephropathy and neuropathy).
There are no published studies
assessing the relationship between
OSA and diabetic retinopathy
longitudinally.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: To our knowledge, this study is
the first prospective examination of the
impact of OSA on diabetic retinopathy.
Our present study shows that OSA is
independently associated with
maculopathy and sight-threatening
retinopathy in patients with type 2
diabetes and that OSA is associated
with the development of advanced
(preproliferative and proliferative)
retinopathy longitudinally over
approximately 4 years in patients with
type 2 diabetes.

 OSA on the rate of progression of STDR, a
longitudinal analysis using retinal images
from one of the study centers was performed
in 2014. All patients who had at least one
retinal screening after the baseline visit were
included in the longitudinal analysis. All
images obtained between baseline and the
end of follow-up were reviewed, and the
worst retinal grades prior to receiving DR
treatment were included in the analysis.
Progression to maculopathy was assessed by
examining the progression from no
maculopathy (M0) to maculopathy (M1)
after excluding patients with M1 at baseline.
Progression to advanced DR was examined
by assessing the progression from no (R0) or
background (R1) DR to preproliferative
(R2) or proliferative (R3) DR after excluding
patients who had R2 or R3 at baseline. In
analyzing retinal imaging grading, the worst
eye grade was used.
Sleep study scorers were blinded to the
patient’s DR grade, and retinal graders were
blinded to the patient’s OSA status. All data
(apart from the retinal images) were
obtained during one-to-one interviews.
Data analysis was performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics version 22.0 software (IBM,
Armonk, NY). Data are presented as mean
(SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]),
depending on data distribution.
Independent continuous variables were
compared using Student’s t test or the
Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables
were compared using the chi-square test.
Correlations between continuous variables
were performed using Pearson’s or
Spearman’s tests. All statistical test
conditions/assumptions were adhered to
throughout the analysis.
To assess whether OSA and/or
hypoxemia measures were independently
associated with STDR, advanced DR, and
maculopathy, multiple logistic regression
(forced entry method) was used, in which
STDR, advanced DR, and maculopathy
status, respectively, were the outcome
measures and OSA and other possible
confounders were the covariates. To assess
the predictors of DR progression, multiple
logistic regression was used with
progression to maculopathy and
progression to advanced DR as the
outcomes and OSA and other confounders
as the covariates (see the RESULTS section for
a full list of the covariates). To assess the
relationship between OSA severity and the
outcome measures in the cross-sectional
and longitudinal analyses, tertiles of AHI
and ODI were used in the logistic
regression models.
Collinearity was considered in
assessing the fit of models to data. On the
basis of tolerance and the variance inflation
factor tests, there was no evidence of
collinearity. However, on the basis of the
condition index, there was evidence
of collinearity with a condition index
value greater than 30, but there was no
variance in proportions less than 0.5.
Sequentially removing variables involved in
multicollinearity had limited impact on
model estimates for the main exposure.
Hence, the final models presented
included variables based on the known

possible confounders and/or variables
that differed between patients with and
without OSA, regardless of the presence
of collinearity. A P value less than
0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Two hundred sixty-six patients were
recruited and 36 were excluded, leaving
230 patients for baseline analysis (Figure 1).
Of these 230 patients, 57.0% (n = 131)
were men, 54.8% (n = 126) were white
Europeans, and 45.2% (n = 104) were South
Asians. There were no differences between
those who were included and those who
were excluded with regard to the prevalence
of DR, maculopathy, or STDR.
OSA prevalence was 63.9% (n = 147).
The prevalence rates of mild, moderate, and
severe OSA were 37.8% (n = 87), 14.8%
(n = 34), and 11.3% (n = 26), respectively.
STDR prevalence was 36.1% (n = 83), DR
prevalence was 63.5% (n = 146) (R0, 36.5%
[n = 84]; R1, 48.3% [n = 111]; R2, 6.5%
[n = 15]; R3, 8.7% [n = 20]). The
prevalence of advanced DR was 15.2%
(n = 35), and the prevalence of maculopathy
was 31.7% (n = 73).
The prevalence of OSA was higher
in white Europeans. Patients with OSA
(OSA1) were older and more obese and had
higher systolic blood pressure than patients
without OSA (OSA2) (Table 2). The use of
antihypertensive agents and insulin was
higher in OSA1 patients, whereas there
were no differences in the use of antiplatelet
or lipid-lowering therapy (Table 2).
Cross-Sectional Analysis
The prevalence rates of STDR, advanced
DR (R2 or R3), and maculopathy were
significantly higher in OSA1 patients than
in OSA2 patients (Table 3).
OSA and DR: Multivariable Analysis
To assess whether the relationship between
OSA and STDR is secondary to or
independent of possible confounders,
logistic regression models were used
(Table 4). Despite adjustment, OSA
remained independently associated with
STDR (Table 4). In addition to OSA (odds
ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.1–4.9; P = 0.035), diabetes duration
(OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1–1.2; P , 0.001), and
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (OR, 1.4;
95% CI, 1.0–1.7; P = 0.02) were also
independently associated with STDR. OSA
was also independently associated with
maculopathy (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2–5.8;
P = 0.01) (Table 4). For details on the
relationship between OSA severity and DR,
see the online supplement.
OSA and DR Progression:
Longitudinal Analysis
We hypothesized that retinopathy
progression from background to more
advanced stages is accelerated by the
presence of OSA. Therefore, to explore this
construct, a longitudinal analysis was
conducted in 199 of 230 patients because
follow-up data were available from one site
only. The average follow-up was 43.0
(37.0–51.0) months. There was no
significant difference in the median (IQR)
follow-up duration between OSA2 patients
(n = 71) and OSA1 patients (n = 122) (45.0
[37.0–51.0] mo vs. 42.5 [36.0–51.0] mo,
respectively; P = 0.32). A summary of
follow-up duration and DR progression in
patients with R0 at baseline in OSA1 and
OSA2 patients can be found in Figure E1
in the online supplement.
When we examined the progression
from R0 or R1 to advanced DR (R2 or R3),
we found that we had 164 (of 199) cases
available for analysis after excluding
29 patients who had advanced DR at
baseline and 6 cases lost to follow-up. Of
the 164 patients included in this analysis,
66 (40.2%), 60 (36.6%), 19 (11.6%), and
19 (11.6%) had no, mild, moderate, and
severe OSA, respectively. For description
of the baseline characteristics of this
population, refer to the online supplement.
The proportion of patients progressing to
advanced DR was higher in OSA1 patients
(18.4% [n = 18] vs. 6.1% [n = 4] for OSA1
and OSA2, respectively; P = 0.02), with
similar trends in South Asians (14.0%
[n = 6] vs. 8.9% [n = 4]; P = 0.45) and white

 Europeans (21.8% [n = 12] vs. 0.0% [n = 0];
P = 0.02).
Data from 129 (of 199) subjects were
available to examine the progression to
maculopathy (M0 to M1) after excluding
65 patients with M1 at baseline and 5 cases
lost to follow-up. There was no significant
difference in maculopathy progression
between OSA1 and OSA2 patients (20.8%
[n = 15] vs. 19.3% [n = 11] for OSA1 and
OSA2, respectively; P = 0.83).
Similarly, data from 121 patients (of
199) were available to examine the
progression to STDR after exclusion of 74
patients with STDR at baseline and 4 cases
lost to follow-up. The proportion of patients
progressing to STDR was not statistically
different between OSA1 and OSA2
patients (20.6% [n = 14] vs. 13.2% [n = 7]
for OSA1 and OSA2, respectively; P =
0.29), regardless of ethnicity (South Asians,
21.2% [n = 7] vs. 19.4% [n = 7], P = 0.86;
white Europeans, 20.0% [n = 7] vs. 0.0%
[n = 0], P = 0.05).
After adjustment for ethnicity, sex,
diabetes duration, age at diabetes diagnosis,
systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, estimated
glomerular filtration rate, body mass index
(BMI), oral antihyperglycemic agents,
insulin use, and number of antihypertensive
medications (Nagelkerke R2 for the model,
0.42), OSA remained an independent
predictor of progression to advanced DR
(OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.2–23.0; P = 0.03)
(Table 5). There was also a dose–effect
relationship showing that moderate to
severe OSA (vs. no OSA) and tertile 3 (vs.
tertile 1) of AHI and ODI were significantly
associated with progression to advanced
DR (Table 5).
To assess whether differences in follow-
up might account for the observed
relationship between OSA and progression
to advanced DR, we compared the follow-up
duration in patients with OSA who
progressed and did not progress to advanced
DR. We calculated the follow-up using two
methods: (1) using the latest available
retinal image or clinical data when the data
were accessed in 2014, as detailed in the
METHODS section; and (2) using the first
mention of progression to advanced DR in
electronic records or the retinal screening
images. The median (IQR) follow-up
(based on first mention of advanced DR in
the records) in patients with OSA who did
not progress (n = 80) versus those who
progressed (n = 18) to advanced DR was
44.0 (37.0–51.0) months versus 32.5
(21.8–42.3) months, respectively
(P = 0.006). These data suggest that the
follow-up duration was significantly shorter
in patients with OSA who developed
advanced DR than in those who did not
develop advanced DR. Compared with the
follow-up duration (based on the date of
the last available record in 2014), we found
no difference between patients with OSA
who did not progress and those who
progressed to advanced DR (44.0
[37.0–51.0] mo vs. 43.5 [35.5–52.5] mo,
respectively; P = 0.9). These data suggest
that our findings are not related to a longer
follow-up in patients who had OSA and
progressed to advanced DR. In addition,
adding the follow-up duration (based on
the date of the last available record in 2014)
to the regression model did not change our
findings (Nagelkerke R2 remained at 0.42;
OR for progression to advanced DR in
patients with OSA vs. those without OSA,
5.2; 95% CI, 1.2–23.0; P = 0.03). Adding the
follow-up duration (based on the first
mention of advanced DR in the records)
did not change the results either
(Nagelkerke R2 = 0.5; OR, 5.4; 95% CI,
1.1–27.4; P = 0.04). Hence, the length of
follow-up does explain the associations
between OSA and progression to advanced
DR in our study.
We also assessed the impact of changes
in HbA1c during the follow-up on the
association between OSA and progression to
advanced DR. We found that these
associations were independent of changes in
HbA1c during follow-up. More details are
included in the online supplement.
CPAP and DR Progression
CPAP lowered the progression to advanced
DR and maculopathy, but this was
statistically significant only in the
progression to advanced DR category
(see the online supplement for details).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report of
an examination of the relationship between
OSA and DR longitudinally. T2D and OSA

 frequently coexist and can be associated
with a range of metabolic and physiological
perturbations that have also been implicated
in the pathogenesis of DR. Our study
demonstrates that OSA (even when mild) is
independently associated with STDR,
maculopathy, and advanced DR in patients
with T2D. We have also shown that OSA is
an independent predictor of progression to
R2 or R3 over approximately 4 years and
that CPAP treatment might have a beneficial
impact on DR progression.
The population in our report comprises
subjects attending large inner-city hospital-
based diabetes clinics in which the
known duration of diabetes was
approximately 10 years. Many of the
subjects already exhibited established
diabetes complications (e.g., albuminuria, as
indicated in Table 2). The participant
characteristics are similar to those reported
previously in a different region of the
United Kingdom (24), suggesting that the
present study sample was representative of
the wider T2D population in secondary
care. However, whether our findings are
applicable to patients typically managed in
primary care and those with a shorter
duration of diabetes remains to be
examined. The high prevalence of OSA in
our sample is consistent with that in other
studies of subjects with T2D (6–9). The
prevalence of STDR in our cohort (36.1%)
is higher than that reported in the literature
(5 to 15%) (1, 25), reflecting differences in
the cohorts and DR risk factors in the
various studies.
OSA1 patients differed from OSA2
patients in regard to multiple demographic
and metabolic factors. Nevertheless, the
association between OSA and advanced DR
remained independent, despite adjustment
for these confounders. STDR and
maculopathy were also associated with mild
OSA. This suggests that the adverse impact

 of OSA in patients with T2D occurs even
in patients with mild degrees of OSA, and
it is possible that the impact of mild OSA
is magnified in tissue that is already
predisposed to damage because of chronic
hyperglycemia. This is further exacerbated
by the increased retinal oxygen
requirements during night adaptation;
hence, even mild hypoxia can result in
major adverse consequences to the retina
(26). In addition, there was a dose–response
relationship in the association between
OSA and progression to advanced DR,
because this association was statistically
significant mainly in patients with
moderate to severe OSA and in patients
with the highest AHI and ODI tertiles,
suggesting potentially that OSA
exacerbated retinal ischemia, which is an
integral part of the development of
preproliferative and proliferative DR.
There are several mechanisms that can
link OSA to maculopathy and
preproliferative and proliferative DR.
Retinal ischemia in diabetes results in the
stimulation of hypoxia-inducible factors,
which are transcriptional factors that are
activated under hypoxic conditions,
resulting in the expression of multiple gene
products, including VEGF (27). Increased
VEGF leads to the development of
proliferative DR, and retinal ischemia is the
main stimulant of VEGF secretion,
resulting in proliferative retinopathy, and as
a result, anti-VEGF is currently used in
clinical practice to treat DR (1, 4). The
hypoxemia associated with OSA has been
shown to be associated with increased
VEGF, which was lowered by CPAP
treatment (28). This is particularly
important because the retina is especially
prone to hypoxic damage during night
hours (29), which is the same time that
OSA-associated hypoxemia occurs. In
addition, endothelial dysfunction plays an
important role in the development of DR
and maculopathy. We and others have
previously shown that OSA (and its
associated cyclical oxygen desaturations
and disruptions in sleep architecture) can
lead to the activation of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase, protein kinase C, and the
polyol pathway, as well as increased
advanced glycation end product
production, inflammation, and oxidative
and nitrosative stress, all of which can lead
to endothelial dysfunction and could have
contributed to the observed associations
between OSA and DR in our study
(10, 30, 31).
In our study, the observed cross-
sectional and longitudinal associations
between OSA and DR were much stronger
in white Europeans than in South Asians.
There might be several plausible reasons for
the observed racial differences. South Asians
with T2D are known to be at an increased
risk of DR and STDR compared with white
Europeans with T2D (32). Hence, there are
factors other than OSA that result in
increased risk of DR in South Asians
compared with white Europeans, making
the impact of OSA on DR in South Asians
smaller and hence requiring a significantly
larger sample size to detect. This is
supported by our analysis showing that the
direction of the relationship between OSA
and STDR, advanced DR, and maculopathy
cross-sectionally and longitudinally is
similar between South Asians and white
Europeans, but the magnitude is greater in
white Europeans. Another important factor
is that we have previously shown in this
cohort that OSA is less common and less
severe in South Asians than in white
Europeans with T2D (33), which might also
contribute to the weaker relationship
between OSA and STDR, maculopathy, and
advanced DR observed in this study in
South Asians than in white Europeans.
Two previous studies have shown an
association between OSA and DR, but there
are important differences between these
studies and ours. The previous studies were
cross-sectional, and unlike in our study,
longitudinal analysis was not performed. In
addition, the previous studies included
highly selected populations, such as
Japanese patients who underwent vitreous
surgery (34) or only white European men
(35). Our study was more comprehensive
and included patients regardless of their
ethnicity, sex, or severity of retinopathy.
Moreover, in prior reports, the diagnosis of
DR was based on case records rather than
retinal images, which we used in our study
(34). OSA assessment also differed between
the studies; one study used pulse oximetry
to diagnose OSA (34), and the other used a
complex, multistep approach based on
questionnaires followed by pulse oximetry
in a selected subgroup (35). We performed
a more in-depth assessment using a
multichannel device with all the study
participants. Critically, the previous studies
did not adjust for important possible
confounders, such as blood pressure, BMI,
and medication use, or they used
suboptimal measures, such as self-reported
BMI (34, 35). In contrast, our extensive
data ascertainment allowed us to adjust for
a wide range of possible confounders.
Although OSA has been associated
with several other ocular pathologies in
patients without diabetes (36–40), changes
similar to DR have not been described in
patients with OSA without diabetes,

 suggesting that the presence of
hyperglycemia is mainly responsible for the
development of DR but that OSA might
contribute to the progression of the disease.
This is supported by our data showing that
the higher prevalence of DR in patients
with OSA than in those without OSA in our
study was driven mainly by a higher
prevalence of advanced DR but that the
prevalence of background DR (or early DR)
was similar in patients with and without
OSA, suggesting that OSA contributes to
the progression rather than the
development of the disease. This is
biologically plausible, particularly because
the intermittent hypoxia associated with
OSA can result in retinal ischemia and
increased VEGF production, resulting in
the development of advanced DR. The lack
of an effect of OSA on maculopathy
development longitudinally could be due to
differences in the pathogenesis between
maculopathy and preproliferative/
proliferative DR or to the methods used to
diagnose maculopathy in this study
(i.e., images) rather than to the actual
measurement of macular thickness using
optical coherence tomography.
Assessment of the impact of CPAP
treatment on DR and DR progression was
not the focus of this study. The available
observational data, however, suggest that
CPAP treatment compliance might have a
favorable impact on DR progression,
although these patients had worse AHI. The
progression to maculopathy in the CPAP-
compliant group was lower than that in the
noncompliant group and similar to that of
patients with mild OSA. However, it is
difficult to assess CPAP efficacy on the basis
of observational data, owing to the small
numbers of patients who were compliant.
Nonetheless, these data provide further
justification for future research to assess the
impact of CPAP on the development and
progression of DR, and they highlight the
challenges of CPAP compliance among
patients with T2D.
Our study has several limitations. We
used home-based portable multichannel
respiratory devices rather than inpatient
overnight polysomnography. However, this
approach is well established (41, 42). Our
sample population was also drawn from
hospital-based diabetes centers; hence, we
cannot necessarily extend our conclusions
to other patient populations. We used
two-field images rather than seven-field
images to assess DR, which might have
resulted in missing peripheral retinal
lesions. This is unlikely to affect the
results unless patients with OSA are more
likely develop more peripheral lesions than
patients without OSA (or vice versa), but
there is no evidence to support this. The
limited number of events over the follow-
up period did not allow us to perform more
in-depth analysis of the relationship
between OSA and DR progression.
In conclusion, we have identified a
relationship between OSA and STDR and
maculopathy in patients with T2D. OSA was
also an independent predictor for the
development of advanced DR. There was a
dose–response relationship between OSA
severity and the development of advanced
DR. CPAP treatment compliance was
associated with reduction in the
development of advanced DR.
Interventional studies are needed to assess
the impact of OSA treatment on the
development of advanced DR. n
