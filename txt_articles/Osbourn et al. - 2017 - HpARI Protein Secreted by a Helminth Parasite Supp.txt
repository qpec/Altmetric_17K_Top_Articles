In Brief
Osbourn et al identified HpARI, a protein
secreted by a helminth parasite that is
capable of suppressing allergic
responses. HpARI binds to IL-33
(a critical inducer of allergy) and nuclear
DNA, preventing the release of IL-33 from
necrotic epithelial cells.

SUMMARY
Infection by helminth parasites is associated with
amelioration of allergic reactivity, but mechanistic
insights into this association are lacking. Products
secreted by the mouse parasite Heligmosomoides
polygyrus suppress type 2 (allergic) immune re-
sponses through interference in the interleukin-33
(IL-33) pathway. Here, we identified H. polygyrus Alar-
min Release Inhibitor (HpARI), an IL-33-suppressive
26-kDa protein, containing three predicted comple-
ment control protein (CCP) modules. In vivo, recombi-
nant HpARI abrogated IL-33, group 2 innate lymphoid
cell (ILC2) and eosinophilic responses to Alternaria
allergen administration, and diminished eosinophilic
responses to Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, increasing
parasite burden. HpARI bound directly to both mouse
and human IL-33 (in the cytokine’s activated state)
and also to nuclear DNA via its N-terminal CCP mod-
ule pair (CCP1/2), tethering active IL-33 within
necrotic cells, preventing its release, and forestalling
initiation of type 2 allergic responses. Thus, HpARI
employs a novel molecular strategy to suppress
type 2 immunity in both infection and allergy.
INTRODUCTION
Infection with helminth parasites negatively correlates with prev-
alence of allergic disease, and parasitic infection is associated
with immunosuppression (Maizels and McSorley, 2016). Many
researchers,
ourselves
included,
have
demonstrated
that
helminths release immunomodulatory proteins to control anti-
parasite immune responses and maintain their persistence in
the host (Maizels and McSorley, 2016). We previously showed
that the excretory–secretory products of the mouse intestinal
parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus (HES) suppress allergic
responses in mouse models of asthma (Buck et al., 2014;
McSorley et al., 2015; McSorley et al., 2014; McSorley et al.,
2012). HES administration blocks the interleukin-33 (IL-33)
response to inhaled Alternaria (fungal) allergen (McSorley et al.,
2014) leading to reduced type 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2)
responses and abrogating lung pathology.
IL33 and its receptor (IL1RL1) are both among the 10 genes
most strongly linked to allergic sensitization (Bønnelykke et al.,
2013) and asthma (Bønnelykke et al., 2014; Moffatt et al.,
2010) in genome-wide association studies. IL-33 concentration
is increased in the lungs of severe asthmatics (Castanhinha
et al., 2015; Saglani et al., 2013), correlating negatively with
lung function (Christianson et al., 2015). Respiratory viral infec-
tions are implicated in both initiation and exacerbation of
asthma, an effect that is also associated with IL-33 release
(Jackson et al., 2014; Saravia et al., 2015).
The IL-33 receptor (ST2, IL1RL1, IL-33R) is expressed by a
wide range of cells, notably T cells, macrophages, endothelial
cells, epithelial cells, and ILC2 (Cayrol and Girard, 2014).
Through these interactions, IL-33 drives type 2 immune
responses in a range of diseases including asthma, atopic
dermatitis, food allergy, COPD, eosinophilic inflammatory bowel
disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and age-related macular
degeneration (De Salvo et al., 2016; Liew et al., 2016; Simon
et al., 2015; Tordesillas et al., 2014). IL-33 is a member of the

 IL-1 family of cytokines. It is stored preformed in the nucleus
bound to heterochromatin, and its dominant function is as an
alarmin cytokine. Active IL-33 is released from the nucleus under
conditions of necrosis, while during apoptosis active caspases
cleave IL-33 within its receptor-binding domain, abolishing activ-
ity (Lefranc
¸ ais and Cayrol, 2012). Although the full-length, 30 kDa
form of IL-33 is functional, the activity of IL-33 is increased
10-fold through cleavage between the DNA-binding and recep-
tor-binding domains by proteases such as calpain-2 (Hristova
et al., 2016), neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G (Lefranc
¸ ais et al.,
2012), and mast cell tryptase (Lefranc
¸ ais et al., 2014) releasing
18–21 kDa mature forms. Active IL-33 is released in a reduced
form, which under physiological conditions rapidly oxidizes,
forming new disulfide bonds and changing conformation,
rendering it unable to bind to the IL-33R beyond a short temporal
and spatial range (Cohen et al., 2015).
Here, we identified H. polygyrus Alarmin Release Inhibitor
(HpARI), a HES-derived recombinant protein that can replicate
the IL-33-suppressive effects of total HES. HpARI bound directly
to active murine or human IL-33 and nuclear DNA. This dual bind-
ing blocked the interaction of IL-33 with its receptor, and tethered
IL-33 within necrotic cells, preventing its release, and blocking
allergic responseinitiation. Thus, HpARI preventsinitiationofpara-
site-toxic IL-33-mediated type 2 immune responses and sup-
presses the development of allergic airway inflammation.
RESULTS
In Vitro Suppression of IL-33 by HES
Previous studies established that HES ablates detectable IL-33
in the bronchoalveolar milieu after Alternaria allergen administra-
tion, suppressing downstream allergic responses (McSorley
et al., 2014). To further investigate the IL-33-suppressive activity
of HES, we developed an in vitro assay for IL-33 release: a single
cell suspension of naı
¨ve total murine lung cells cultured for 1 hr in
the presence of Alternaria allergen and HES. In this assay, HES
markedly reduced the amount of IL-33 in culture supernatants,
as detected by ELISA (Figure 1A).
IL-33 is released from lung epithelial cells under conditions of
necrosis, whereas activated caspases cleave IL-33 within the
IL-1-like cytokine domain, inactivating IL-33 under conditions
of apoptosis (Lefranc
¸ ais and Cayrol, 2012). We therefore hy-
pothesized that HES could be activating caspase and/or
apoptosis pathways. Propidium iodide and annexin V staining
showed that cells incubated with Alternaria allergen were highly
necrotic and that this was unaffected by the presence of HES
(Figure 1B). Necrosis induced by freeze-thaw treatment of
lung cells also resulted in substantial IL-33 release, which again
was abrogated by treatment of cells with HES immediately prior
to freezing (Figure 1C). Therefore we conclude that HES sup-
pression of IL-33 does not depend on activation of the
apoptosis pathway, but instead acts on pre-formed IL-33
released from necrotic cells.
Identification and Characterization of HpARI Protein
A process of fractionation, screening, and proteomic analysis of
HES was used to identify candidate IL-33-suppressive proteins.
Gel filtration and anion exchange FPLC were used to fractionate
HES by size and charge, respectively. IL-33 suppressive activity
peaked around size fraction 11 (Figure 2A) and charge fraction
25 (Figure 2B). Each size and charge fraction was subjected to
trypsin digestion followed by liquid chromatography-electro-
spray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the expo-
nentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) value for
each HES protein in every fraction was calculated, and
compared to the profile of IL-33 suppression.
By size fractionation, 220 proteins were found with emPAI
values which peaked around size fraction 11 (peak value in frac-
tions 10–12), while 371 proteins were found with emPAIs which
peaked around charge fraction 25 (peak value in fractions
23–27), 54 of which were shared between the two fractionation
techniques. Proteins were prioritized wherein more than one
peptide was detected in size fraction 11 and charge fraction
25, resulting in a short-list of 25 candidate proteins (Table S1).
The emPAI values for each of these 25 candidates for all size
and charge fractions was then manually compared to the IL-33
suppression profile (Figure S1A), and 4 candidates were
selected for initial screening (Figure S1B).
The 4 candidate IL-33 suppressive genes were transfected
into HEK293T cells for expression, and screened for suppression

 of the IL-33 signal in vitro. Of the 4 candidates, only the transcript
named Hp_I08176_IG02172_L1157 in our in-house sequencing
(candidate ‘‘D’’ in Figure 2C) significantly suppressed IL-33;
this protein was consequently renamed as H. polygyrus Alarmin
Release Inhibitor (HpARI). Subsequently, an identical transcript
was found at WormBase Parasite: HPBE_0000813301.
The HpARI gene is made up of 7 exons, encoding a 251-aa
protein including a 16-aa signal peptide motif (Figure S2A),
with a deduced mature molecular weight of 26 kDa. The mature
protein contains three predicted Complement Control Protein
(CCP)-like modules (also known as Short Consensus Repeats
(SCRs) or sushi-domains, PFAM00084) (Figure 2D). CCP1–3 all
contain features of a CCP module such as the four consensus
Cysteine residues (CysI to CysIV, consistent with formation of
disulfide bonds in a CysI-CysIII and CysII-CysIV pattern), the
Trp/Leu residue between CysIII and CysIV and other structurally
important residues typical of a CCP module (Figures 2D and
2E and STAR Methods) (Kirkitadze and Barlow, 2001; Soares
et al., 2005). Compared to archetypal CCP modules (Soares
and Barlow, 2005), all three are atypical in part with divergent
sequence features, including an absence of conserved Proline
residues after CysI in CCP1, and atypical insertions of �20 amino
acid residues between CysI and CysII in CCP 2 and CCP3, which
are unique compared to previously identified CCP domains.
Each CCP module is encoded by two exons with the second
exon boundary in each case falling between adjacent predicted
CCP modules (i.e. between CysIV of one module and CysI of the
next) lending further support to the discerned domain bound-
aries (Figure 2E and Figure S2A).
The three predicted HpARI CCP module sequences were
modelled individually based upon their top ranked CCP module
template structures. Each CCP module 3-D model is character-
ized by a b-sheet framework, held together by two disulfide
bridges. Other key structural features such as the location of
the buried Trp/Leu, hypervariable loop, and potential N-glycosyl-
ation sites are indicated along with the relative positions of the
novel insertions in CCP2 and CCP3, which could not be
modelled on conventional experimentally determined CCP mod-
ule structures (Figure 2F).
In Vitro and In Vivo IL-33 Suppression by HpARI
Recombinant mature 6-His and Myc-tagged HpARI protein was
purified by metal chelating chromatography (Figure S2B), and
tested for IL-33 suppression in vitro. HpARI was active at
<10 ng/ml, while HES required an approximately 50-fold higher
concentration for a similar effect (Figure 3A). The IL-33-suppres-
sive activity of HpARI in response to Alternaria culture or freeze-
thaw was ablated on heat-treatment, as with HES (Figures S3A
and S3B).
HpARI also effectively suppressed IL-33 detected in bron-
choalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids in response to Alternaria allergen
in vivo (Figure 3B). Again this effect replicated that of HES
(McSorley et al., 2014) and suppression was ablated when
HpARI was proteolytically cleaved and heat-treated, ruling out
a role for non-protein contaminants. In addition, the IL-33-sup-
pressive effects of HpARI could pre-condition airway tissues,
substantially reducing the IL-33 response to Alternaria allergen
24 hr later, with a degree of protection in some animals even after
72 hr (Figure 3C). Thus, HpARI appears to be a critical IL-33-sup-
pressive factor in HES.
Suppression of In Vivo Type 2 Responses by HpARI
Alternaria exposure induces a rapid T cell-independent eosino-
philia within 24 hr of administration. This response is driven by
ILC2 cytokine release, and is critically dependent on IL-33 (Bar-
temes et al., 2012). Recombinant HpARI co-administration with
Alternaria allergen abrogated BAL eosinophilia (Figure 3D) and
lung ILC2 IL-5 (Figure 3E) and IL-13 production (Figure 3F),
24 hr later, again replicating the effects observed with total
HES. IL-13-eGFP reporter mice were used to assess ILC2 cyto-
kine responses in the absence of PMA and Ionomycin stimula-
tion, confirming profound suppression of IL-13 reporter expres-
sion in ICOS+CD90.2+IL-33R+CD127+CD45+lineage– ILC2s by
HpARI (Figures S3C–S3E).
HpARI was administered in a T cell-dependent model of
asthma, in which OVA protein is first co-administered with Alter-
naria, and antigen-specific type 2 responses recalled 2 weeks
later by challenge with OVA protein alone (McSorley et al.,
2014). Again HpARI replicated the suppressive effects of HES
on BAL eosinophilia and lung ILC2 responses (Figures 4A–4C).
Furthermore, this suppression led to significantly abrogated
lung resistance and compliance at challenge (Figures 4D and
4E), as well as reduced inflammation and mucus production as-
sessed by histological staining (Figure 4F–4H).
Finally, the role of HpARI in parasite infections was addressed
using Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection, a parasite which
(unlike H. polygyrus) migrates through the lung and leads to early
IL-33-dependent type 2 responses (Hung et al., 2013). Similarly
to the phenotype seen in an IL-33-deficient mouse, HpARI
administration did not affect worm burden at early timepoints,
but increased numbers of adult parasites found in the intestinal
lumen at day 6 (Figures 4I and 4J). This suppression of parasite
rejection was associated with reduced BAL eosinophilia, reaching
significance at day 6 (Figure 4K). Thus, HpARI abrogates parasite-
or allergen-induced IL-33-dependent type 2 immune responses,
abrogating parasite ejection and suppressing allergic pathology.
HpARI Binding to IL-33
We hypothesized that HpARI could act by binding directly to
IL-33. To investigate this, we incubated Myc-tagged HpARI
with murine lung cell homogenates, and immunoprecipitated
with anti-c-Myc antibody bound to protein G-coated beads.

Immunity 47, 739–751, October 17, 2017
 HpARI immunoprecipitated a clear band at �18 kDa in Myc-
tagged complexes eluted from anti-c-Myc-coated, but not iso-
type control-coated beads, as revealed by anti-IL-33 western
blotting (Figure 5A). Unbound material (supernatants from co-
immunoprecipitation) showed undetectable or very faint bands
for IL-33 under these conditions, reflecting the manner in which
immunoprecipitation concentrates ligand sufficiently for detec-
tion. No band could be detected for full-length IL-33 (30 kDa)
in these experiments (data not shown).
Despite human and murine IL-33 sharing only 52% amino acid
identity, we found that human IL-33 also co-immunoprecipitates
with HpARI after incubation with human lung homogenates, seen
as an �18 kDa band corresponding to mature human IL-33 (Fig-
ure 5B). In this case, unbound human IL-33 could be detected in
supernatants from co-immunoprecipitation or control condi-
tions, also at �18 kDa.
To biochemically characterize the binding of human and
mouse IL-33 with HpARI, we assessed the interactions between
these proteins by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Figures 5C
and 5D). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of HpARI for
murine IL-33 is 0.56 ± 0.1 nM, and 260 ± 13 nM for human IL-33.
Oxidation of IL-33
Recently, it was shown that IL-33 is released in an active reduced
form, which is quickly oxidized (<4 hr after release) and inacti-
vated under physiological conditions (Cohen et al., 2015).
Commercially-available IL-33 ELISA kits do not differentiate be-
tween the reduced and oxidized forms. Therefore we decided to
investigate whether HpARI preferentially bound to reduced or
oxidized IL-33.
To attain a source of oxidized and reduced IL-33, we sub-
jected lung cells to freeze and thaw-mediated necrosis,
harvested IL-33-containing supernatants immediately post-
thaw, and incubated these at 37�C for 1–4 hr to oxidize IL-33
(Cohen et al., 2015). When HpARI was added to supernatants
directly post-thaw, or up to 2 hr later, it was able to significantly
reduce the IL-33 signal as measured by ELISA, whereas by 4 hr
post-thaw, no effect of HpARI could be seen (Figure 5E and Fig-
ure S4A). Therefore we hypothesized that HpARI binds only to
active (reduced) IL-33.
HpARI
co-immunoprecipitation
experiments
were
then
repeated with either untreated recombinant murine IL-33
(rmIL-33) or rmIL-33 which had been oxidized by incubation
for 24 hr at 37�C in tissue culture medium. Eluted complexes
were run on non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels to distinguish
reduced and oxidized IL-33 by their differential migration un-
der non-reducing conditions, the more compact oxidized
form migrating more rapidly (Cohen et al., 2015). A strong
bias for binding of HpARI to the reduced form could be
seen, with unbound supernatants containing the oxidized
form, while no unbound reduced IL-33 could be detected
(Figure 5F).

 Co-immunoprecipitation
was repeated with recombinant
human IL-33 (rhIL-33), either untreated or oxidized under the
same conditions as applied to murine IL-33. Similarly to murine
IL-33, rhIL-33 could only be bound by HpARI in its reduced,
active form, with oxidation of IL-33 abolishing its ability to be
co-precipitated (Figure 5G).
Finally, we ensured that the binding of HpARI is specific to
IL-33, by binding studies with the closely-related IL-1 family
cytokine IL-1a. No binding of HpARI to IL-1a could be detected,
either by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 5H) or by SPR (Fig-
ure S4B). Thus, HpARI specifically and with high affinity, binds
to the active, reduced form of IL-33.
HpARI Prevents Binding of Active IL-33 to the IL-33
Receptor
To investigate whether HpARI binding IL-33 consequently
affected downstream responses to IL-33, we investigated the
binding of IL-33 to its receptor ST2. Recombinant mIL-33
was incubated alone or with HpARI, then immunoprecipitation
was carried out using an ST2-Fc fusion protein bound to pro-
tein G-coated magnetic beads. The presence of HpARI
completely
blocked
immunoprecipitation
of
rmIL-33
by
ST2-Fc (Figure 6A), implying that HpARI prevents IL-33 from
binding to its receptor.

Furthermore,
when
rmIL-33
was
administered intranasally to mice, IL-33-
mediated ILC2 activation (measured by
IL-5 and IL-13 production) was effectively
ablated by HpARI co-administration (Figures 6B and 6C). Thus
HpARI, through binding to IL-33, can prevent the activation of
ILC2s through ST2 ligation.
HpARI Inhibits Release of IL-33
As HpARI directly binds IL-33, it could also interfere with detec-
tion of the cytokine by ELISA through masking epitopes bound
by assay antibodies. This could affect our early screening re-
sults, (Figures 1, 2, and 3) as these are largely dependent on
ELISA to measure concentrations of IL-33. To investigate the
possibility of undetectable HpARI-bound IL-33 in BAL superna-
tants, we measured IL-33 by both ELISA and western blot, as the
latter reduces, denatures and dissociates protein complexes.
Mice were treated with Alternaria allergen and BAL taken
15 min later (at which timepoint the majority of IL-33 released
is active and reduced [Cohen et al., 2015]), HpARI coadministra-
tion ablated the IL-33 signal by ELISA (Figure 6D), and signifi-
cantly inhibited (but did not ablate) the IL-33 signal by western
blot (Figure 6E), implying that although HpARI binding interferes
with IL-33 detection by ELISA, IL-33 release is indeed diminished
with HpARI administration. In contrast, HpARI could not affect
the release of HMGB1, another nuclear-localised alarmin cyto-
kine released on necrosis, (Figure S4C), demonstrating that the
effects of HpARI are specific to IL-33.
Immunity 47, 739–751, October 17, 2017

 To translate these results to human biology, we cultured human
lung explants for 1 hr with HpARI, a system and timepoint in which
lungexplantsspontaneouslyreleasereduced(active)humanIL-33
(Cohen et al., 2015). Similarly to the murine system, a reduction in
IL-33 signal was seen with HpARI coadministration, as measured
by both ELISA and western blot (Figures 6F and 6G). Furthermore,
HpARIwasadministeredwithAlternariatohumanIL-33transgenic
mice (Cohen et al., 2015), where it again suppressed human IL-33
release into the BAL (Figures 6H and 6I). Thus, HpARI reduces the
release of both mouse and human IL-33.

which we found stores high amounts of
IL-33 in the nucleus (Figure S5A). Similarly
to lung cells cultured in vitro, IL-33 is
released from freeze-thawed CMT-64
cells, and this response is suppressed
by HpARI (Figure S5B). We then produced
an HpARI_mCherry fusion protein, allow-
ing
fluorescent
localization
of
HpARI
binding, while retaining IL-33-suppres-
sive activity (Figure S5C).
Although we found no HpARI_mCherry
staining of live CMT-64 cells, binding was
evident in freeze-thaw treated necrotic
cells (Figure 7A), where it bound in the nu-
cleus (Figure 7B). Surprisingly, we found
HpARI_mCherry binds the nucleus independently of IL-33
expression, as similar staining could be seen in HEK293 cells
(Figure 7C), from which no IL-33 could be detected (data not
shown). As binding of HpARI in the nucleus of CMT-64 or
HEK293 cells was ablated by addition of DNAse I (Figure 7C),
we hypothesized that HpARI binds directly to DNA in the nucleus
of necrotic epithelial cells.
In vivo, DNAse co-administration with Alternaria allergen
abrogated HpARI suppression of IL-33 as measured by west-
ern blot, but not by ELISA, in the latter case presumably due
to steric hindrance of ELISA antibodies on released HpARI-
bound IL-33 (Figures 7D and 7E). We conclude that dual bind-
ing of DNA and IL-33 by HpARI results in retention of IL-33
within the necrotic cell nucleus, conferring a tethering function

 on HpARI in addition to its ability to block IL-33 in the
fluid phase.
Binding of DNA by HpARI was confirmed using a gel shift
assay, in which addition of HpARI retarded the migration of linear
plasmid DNA through an agarose gel in a concentration-depen-
dent manner (Figure 7F), and by immunoprecipitation of plasmid
DNA by HpARI (Figure S5D). We hypothesised that HpARI could
bind DNA through electrostatic interactions, as shown for other
CCP module-containing proteins (Sjo
¨ berg et al., 2007; Trouw
et al., 2005). When the isoelectric point (pI) of each of the three
CCP domains of HpARI were calculated, CCP2 and CCP3
were found to be relatively acidic (pI 6.32 and 5.34 respectively),
while CCP1 was strongly basic (pI 9.79). Indeed, an electrostatic
surface representation of our 3-D model of CCP1 (Figure S5E),
reveals clusters of solvent-exposed positively charged residues
that could serve as a binding site for oppositely-charged (acidic)
DNA. We produced truncated versions of HpARI, either encod-

ing CCP1/2 or CCP2/3. As predicted, we
found that only the CCP1/2 truncation
caused a shift in DNA migration (Fig-
ure 7F), supporting a role for CCP1 in
binding to DNA.
In vivo, only the CCP1/2 HpARI trunca-
tion could inhibit the release of IL-33 as
measured by western blot, while CCP2/3
actually
increased
total
quantities
of
IL-33 detected in the BAL (Figure 7G).
Both constructs suppressed IL-33 detec-
tion by ELISA (Figure 7H), indicating they
could both bind IL-33 and inhibit binding
of ELISA antibodies. Therefore we pro-
pose that CCP2/3 does not inhibit IL-33
release but instead binds it in solution, prevent it from being
degraded or taken up via its receptor. This data supports a
model by which HpARI binds to IL-33 through its CCP2 domain,
and to DNA through its CCP1 domain, tethering IL-33 within the
necrotic cell nucleus.
DISCUSSION
IL-33 has emerged as a critical initiator of allergic responses in
diseases such as asthma, sparking an array of type 2 reactions
in innate lymphoid cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and T cells
(Liew et al., 2016). Through screening of the secreted products
of a helminth parasite we identified HpARI, a CCP module-con-
taining protein that inhibits IL-33 release. Recombinant HpARI is
non-cell permeable, and can only gain access to the nucleus of
necrotic cells, where it binds directly to IL-33 and nuclear DNA,
tethering IL-33 within necrotic cells and preventing binding to

747
 the IL-33R, thereby suppressing ILC2 responses and eosino-
philia in the lung after Alternaria administration.
The primary mechanistic effect of HpARI is to bind IL-33:
remarkably, this extends from murine to human IL-33. Although
the affinity of HpARI for human IL-33 is lower than that of mouse
IL-33, this binding is sufficient to prevent human IL-33 release,
with a reduced IL-33 signal in human lung explant supernatants
when cultured with HpARI, and reduced human IL-33 release in
the lungs of human IL-33 transgenic mice. In the mouse, HpARI
proved to be highly suppressive in vivo, recapitulating and
exceeding the effects of total parasite secretions (HES), and
able to inhibit IL-33 release even when administered 24 hr prior
to allergen challenge.
Although it is clear that IL-33 is released at high levels during
tissue injury and necrosis, it is presently unclear how IL-33 is
secreted during homeostasis (Liew et al., 2016). We showed
that HpARI was not able to penetrate intact cells thus, in the
absence of cell membrane damage, HpARI would be unable to
mediate the nuclear retention of IL-33. HpARI’s unique mecha-
nism of action and specificity provide an interesting tool to inves-
tigate the role of IL-33 as an alarmin—preventing the release of
IL-33 from necrotic cells while leaving other responses (necrosis,
HMGB1 or IL-1a release) unaffected. Recently, IL-33 production
and release by activated mast cells in response to extracellular
ATP release was demonstrated in H. polygyrus infection (Shimo-
kawa et al., 2017), and extracellular ATP has previously been
shown to induce IL-33 release in response to Alternaria adminis-
tration (Kouzaki et al., 2011). These findings might explain the
lack of total ablation of IL-33 release with HpARI administration,
as some cytokine might be actively secreted by live mast cells,
against which the tethering function of HpARI would be inactive,
without exposed DNA in a necrotic, lysed cell. In this context, the
role of H. polygyrus secreted apyrases (Hewitson et al., 2011)—
enzymes which degrade extracellular ATP—might have a
further role.
Binding to nuclear DNA allows HpARI to hold active IL-33
within the necrotic cell, and ablates allergic sensitization.
Although the affinity for DNA was not determined in this study,
evidence from gel shift and co-immunoprecipitation assays, as
well as ablation of necrotic nuclear localization and IL-33 teth-
ering function on DNAse treatment, strongly supports binding
of HpARI to DNA. Truncated HpARI lacking CCP1 has no ac-
tivity in the gel shift assay and lacks IL-33 tethering function-
ality, and molecular modeling of CCP1 revealed 2 exposed
basic patches as putative DNA binding sites. Of note, the
mammalian CCP domain-containing proteins C4b-binding
protein (C4BP) (Trouw et al., 2005) and complement factor
H (Leffler et al., 2010), also bind DNA through basic CCP mod-
ules. The importance of IL-33 localization to the nucleus has
been shown in transgenic mice lacking the nuclear localization
domain of IL-33, which develop lethal eosinophil-dominant
multi-organ inflammation (Bessa et al., 2014), and in human
endothelial cells, where extracellular IL-33 leads to inflamma-
tory
responses,
while
nuclear
IL-33
does
not
(Gautier
et al., 2016).
Three predicted CCP modules span the length of mature
HpARI. CCP module-containing proteins are present in different
phyla including chordates and nematodes, with notable expan-
sion
and
diversification
in
parasitic
species
such
as
H. polygyrus (Hewitson et al., 2013). The functions of CCP mod-
ules are diverse, underlining the versatility of this structural scaf-
fold that has evolved to serve many purposes (Kirkitadze and
Barlow, 2001; Soares and Barlow, 2005; Soares et al., 2005).
Of note, no non-host CCP module-containing protein has previ-
ously been shown to have immunomodulatory function outside
of the complement system, and hence the co-option of this mod-
ule by a parasite to block a mammalian immunological pathway
is remarkable.
The suppression of the IL-33 pathway by H. polygyrus at the
level of the IL-33 cytokine (mediated by HpARI) and the IL-33
receptor (mediated by secreted exosomes [Buck et al., 2014])
indicates that this pathway might be critical to persistence of
the parasite. Indeed administration of exogenous IL-33 induces
expulsion of H. polygyrus (Yang et al., 2013), while IL-33R-defi-
cient mice are slow to expel this parasite even when immunized
with a vaccine that induces sterile immunity in wild-type mice
(Coakley et al., 2017). Similarly, in many helminth infections
IL-33 administration can drive immunity, while deficiency of
IL-33 or the IL-33 receptor leads to increased parasite load (Mai-
zels and McSorley, 2016). Hence, the ability of H. polygyrus to
pre-empt the IL-33 alarmin system is likely to be a pivotal evolu-
tionary adaptation to allow establishment in the mamma-
lian host.
HpARI administration suppressed the eosinophilic response
to N. brasiliensis infection, leading to reduced ejection of adult
parasites from the intestinal lumen, similarly to the phenotype
seen in IL-33-deficient animals (Hung et al., 2013). Thus HpARI
is capable of suppressing early innate anti-parasite immunity,
a role we hypothesize it to play in the early stages of
H. polygyrus infection where IL-33 is critical for resistance
(Coakley et al., 2017).
During an H. polygyrus infection, larvae penetrate the gut wall,
undergo two molts in the subserosal membrane, and emerge
back into the lumen of the gut as adults (Maizels et al., 2012).
As the parasite penetrates the intestinal wall, it damages epithe-
lial cells which could result in the release of pre-formed IL-33 and
induction of a parasite-toxic type 2 immune response. HpARI is
secreted by the parasite larvae and adult (Hewitson et al., 2013)
and so is well positioned to ablate this IL-33 response.
Recently, IL-33 was implicated in activation of intestinal
Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells (Schiering et al., 2014) raising
the possibility that HpARI could interfere with Treg cell-medi-
ated suppression. However, in mouse models of asthma,
IL-33 signaling to IL-33R+Foxp3+ Treg cells results in their
expression of Th2 cytokines, and abrogation of suppressive
ability (Chen et al., 2017). Thus, in asthmatic responses at least,
IL-33 appears to have an inflammatory, rather than suppressive
effect.
In conclusion, we have identified a CCP module-containing
protein with the unique ability to selectively bind to IL-33 and
DNA within necrotic epithelial cells. This activity potently sup-
presses the release and the biological activity of IL-33, resulting
in suppression of type 2 responses to allergen challenge. IL-33 is
a critical mediator in allergic disease and an important clinical
target. HpARI could be a potent agent for prevention of IL-33-
mediated pathology, as well as a new tool for manipulation of
IL-33 release, leading to better understanding of the IL-33
pathway.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
BALB/cOlaHsd, C57BL/6JOlaHsd, IL-13-eGFP (C57BL/6 background) (Neill et al., 2010) and ST2-deficient (BALB/c background,
kindly provided by Dr Andrew McKenzie, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge) mice, male or female (single sex within
an experiment), 6-10 weeks old, were bred in-house at the University of Edinburgh. hIL-33+/+, mIL-33–/– (humanised IL-33) transgenic
mice (BALB/c background) (Cohen et al., 2015) were bred in-house at the Babraham Institute, Cambridge. All mice were accommo-
dated, and procedures performed under UK Home Office licenses with institutional oversight performed by qualified veterinarians.
Human Tissue Samples
Non-cancerous adjacent tissue from lung cancer patients was collected by Lothian NRS Bioresource, and cultured as previously
described (Cohen et al., 2015). The study was approved by Lothian NRS Bioresource (15/ES/0094) and tissue was donated with
the informed consent of patients.

 METHOD DETAILS
Parasite lifecycles, Infection, and HES Preparation
The life cycle of H. polygyrus bakeri was maintained, and HES products prepared, as previously described (Johnston et al., 2015). The
life cycle of N. brasiliensis was maintained in Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (Lawrence et al., 1996), and infective L3
larvae were prepared from 1-3 week rat fecal cultures. BALB/c mice were subcutaneously infected with 500 L3 N. brasiliensis larvae.
At day 3 post-infection, larvae were counted in the bronchoalveolar lavage and in lung tissue, by dicing lungs and placing them in a
cheese-cloth bag in a 50 ml tube containing PBS at 37�C for at least 3 h. Day 3 lung counts reflect a sum of the BAL and lung larval
counts for each animal. At day 6 intestinal worms were recovered from intestinal tissue using an adapted Baermann apparatus.
Reagents
Alternaria alternata extract (Greer XPM1D3A25) was resuspended in PBS, filter sterilized and concentration assessed by BCA assay
(Pierce). CMT-64 cells (ECACC 10032301) and HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) were maintained by serial passage in DMEM
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mg ml-1 penicillin/streptomycin. Human and murine IL-33
and murine IL-1a were purchased from BioLegend.
In Vitro IL-33 Release Assay
HES, candidate proteins or HpARI were cultured with total murine lung cells prepared by Liberase/DNAse digestion of naı
¨ve mouse
lungs or CMT-64 cells for 1 h at 37�C, 5% CO2, with Alternaria allergen (200 mg ml-1), or were frozen on dry ice, and thawed at 37�C.
Preparation of Murine Lung Single Cell Suspension
Single-cell suspensions of naı
¨ve murine lung tissue were prepared by digesting in 2 U ml-1 liberase TL (Roche, Burgess Hill, UK) and
80 U ml-1 DNase (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) at 37�C with agitation for 35 min. Digested tissue was macerated through a 70 mm
cell strainer (BD Biosciences), treated with red blood cells lysis buffer (Sigma), and live cells counted on a haemocytometer, excluding
dead cells by trypan blue staining.
Cytokine Measurement
R&D Systems Duoset kits were used to measure human and murine IL-33 by ELISA, while western blotting was carried out using
polyclonal goat anti-mouse IL-33, goat anti-human IL-33 or goat anti-mouse IL-1a (R&D Systems) with a rabbit anti-goat IgG HRP
secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher), and detected using WesternSure Premium reagent (Licor).
Fractionation and Mass Spectrometry
HES was separated into 1 ml fractions by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column, or by anion ex-
change chromatography using a MonoQ 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare) in a 40 column volume gradient from 20 mM TrisHCl pH 8
(start buffer) to a maximum of 30% 20 mM TrisHCl + 1 M NaCl pH 8 (elution buffer). All fractions were trypsinized and analyzed by LC
MS/MS on an on-line system consisting of a capillary-pump Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent, UK) coupled to an Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) as previously described (Hewitson et al., 2011; Hewitson et al., 2013). LC MS/MS data was
analyzed using Mascot (v2.4, Matrix Science) and searched against an improved in-house BLASTx annotated database obtained
by 454 sequencing of H. polygyrus adults, with additional full length H. polygyrus sequences from NCBI, WormBase ParaSite
(Howe et al., 2016) and our own Sanger sequencing (Harcus Y. et al, manuscript in preparation). Peptides identified were ranked
by Mascot protein score, with a minimum cutoff score of 20, with a significance threshold of p<0.05. Protein abundance was esti-
mated by emPAI (exponentially modified protein abundance index).
Protein Expression and Purification
Candidate genes were selected by comparison of emPAI and IL-33-suppression profiles in all fractions (Figures S1 and S2). Candi-
date genes A-D (Figure 2A, respectively Hp_I10793_IG03481_L623, Hp_I15874_IG07818_L1106, Hp_I46029_IG37973_L313 and
Hp_I08176_IG02172_L1157 transcripts) were codon optimised for Homo sapiens and gene synthesised (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher)
with 5’ AscI and 3’ NotI restriction enzyme sites. CCP1/2 (amino acids 17-165) and CCP2/3 (amino acids 80-251) constructs
were created using PCR of codon-optimised HpARI, and primers which added a NotI site 3’ of the CCP2 module
(5’GCGGCCGCCTTGGGGCACACGCCCAG3’, primes reverse of LGVCPK amino acid sequence, for CCP1/2 construct), or an
AscI site 5’ of the CCP2 module (5’ 5’GGCGCGCCGGCTGCAAGGGCATCCTG3’, primes GCKGIL amino acid sequence, for
CCP2/3 construct), combined with vector-specific T7 (5’ of insert) and BGH (3’ of insert) primers. The HpARI_mCherry fusion protein
was created by cloning in a codon-optimised gene-synthesised mCherry sequence (ANO45948.1) at the C-terminus of the HpARI
protein, using an mCherry 5’ NotI site and a 3’ ApaI site. These constructs were sub-cloned into the pSecTAG2A expression vector
(Thermo Fisher), using AscI, NotI-HF and Apa-1 restriction enzyme digestion (New England Biolabs), followed by T4 DNA ligation
(Thermo Fisher).
JM109 cells were transformed with ligated constructs and plasmids were midiprepped using the PureLink HiPure midiprep kit
(Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and Sanger sequenced. Plasmid constructs were transfected into
HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate technique (Jordan et al., 1996), using 15 mg plasmid DNA per 100 mm tissue culture

 dish of HEK293T cells at 20% confluency. Stable cell lines were maintained using Zeocin (Thermo Fisher) selection in DMEM medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mg ml-1 Penicillin/Streptomycin.
Resulting expressed proteins secreted to the medium contained C-terminal myc and 6-His tags. For large scale expression of con-
structs, transfected cells were transferred to 293 SFM II media (Thermo Fisher) and protein purified from supernatant by nickel affinity
chromatography using HiTrap chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare), eluting bound proteins using an imidazole gradient. Fractions
containing pure expressed protein were pooled, dialysed into PBS, sterile filtered and concentration assessed by absorbance at
280 nm, corrected by calculated extinction coefficient.
Purified HpARI had an endotoxin content of below 0.5 U LPS per mg protein, as measured by the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate
assay (Lonza).
Bioinformatics Characterization and Modeling
Domain identification and assignment were undertaken using a combination of SMART (Letunic et al., 2015), an HHPred search
against the pdb70 database (accessed March 2016) (Berman et al., 2000; So
¨ ding, 2005), and refined manually based upon posi-
tioning of the four Cysteine residues that typify CCP module sequences (Soares et al., 2005). PROSITE (de Castro et al., 2006)
was used for short motif searches. ESPript v3 (Robert and Gouet, 2014) was used for alignment figure preparation.
The three predicted HpARI CCP module sequences were modeled based upon their top ranked CCP module template structure
‘hits’ as suggested by HHPred. HpARI-CCP1 was modeled based upon CR2-CCP2 (PDB ID: 1LY2) (Prota et al., 2002) (after a manual
switch of Leu69 with Trp69 to help identify this CCP module using HHPred; note Leu/Trp substitutions exist in other experimentally-
determined CCP module structures such as complement Factor H CCP10 and CCP20 (Makou et al., 2012; Morgan et al.,
2012); HpARI-CCP2 on CSMD1-CCP3 (PDB ID: 2EHF) (RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative); HpARI-CCP3 on
GABABR1a-CCP2 (PDB ID: 1SRZ) (Blein et al., 2004). The target-template alignment in each case was based upon the initial HHPred
alignment, then extended to include the first Cysteine residue in each domain, realigned using ClustalX (Thompson et al., 1997), and
finally subjected to manual editing to optimally position known consensus residues, secondary structure elements and gaps (Soares
et al., 2005). Note, an alternative alignment for the atypical insertion in CCP3 is possible where it can be accommodated after the
hypervariable loop (not shown). A total of 100 models for each CCP module were built using Modeller v9.12 (Sali and Blundell,
1993), and the model with the lowest DOPE (Shen and Sali, 2006) energy score selected as the representative model in each
case and evaluated for valid stereochemistry (Lovell et al., 2003). Electrostatic surface potential was calculated using APBS (Baker
et al, 2001). PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/; Schro
¨ dinger, LLC.) was used for visualization, and figure preparation.
Alternaria Models
Alternaria models, lung cell preparation, flow cytometry and lung histology were carried out as previously described (McSorley et al.,
2014). Alternaria allergen (25 mg) was administered intranasally with 20 mg OVA protein (Sigma) and HpARI (10 mg). In some exper-
iments, the OVA-specific response was recalled by daily intranasal administration of 20 mg OVA protein on days 14, 15 and 16. Mice
were culled 15 min, 1 h, 24 h or 17 days after the initial administration, as indicated. Bronchoalveloar lavage was collected (4 lavages
with 0.5 ml ice-cold PBS), followed by lung dissection for tissue digestion and single cell preparation (see below), or lungs were in-
flated with 10% neutral buffered formalin for histology. Formalin-fixed lungs were transferred into 70% ethanol 24 h after collection,
paraffin, embedded and sectioned (5 mm), prior to staining with haemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS). H&E and
PAS-stained sections were scored blindly according to the following criteria: H&E stain at 200X magnification on an increasing
severity score of 1–4 in both the peri-vascular and peri-bronchiolar compartments (1 = <5, 2 = 5-20, 3 = 20-100, 4 = >100 cells), giving
an average overall score of 5-10 fields of view per section. PAS stained sections were scored at 100X magnification, on percentage of
mucous-positive epithelial cells (1 = <1%, 2 = 1-20%, 3 = 20-50%, 4 = 50-100%), of 5-10 fields of view per section.
Measurement of Airway Hyperresponsiveness
A Flexivent system (Scireq, Montreal, Canada) was used to measure dynamic resistance and compliance. Mice were anaesthetised
with intraperitoneal ketamine 200 mg/kg and pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg), tracheotomised and mechanically ventillated. Lung resis-
tance and compliance were measured in response to nebulised methacholine (Sigma).
Immunoprecipitation
Protein G dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) were coated with 5 mg anti-c-Myc (clone Myc.A7, Thermo Fisher), MOPC (IgG1 isotype control
antibody) or ST2-Fc fusion protein (Biolegend), and washed on a DynaMag-2 magnet with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. These
were then used to immunoprecipitate HpARI-IL-33 complexes, following manufacturer’s instructions.
Where human or mouse lung homogenates were used, these were prepared by homogenizing (Tissuelyser II, QIAGEN) one lung
lobe (mouse) in 1 ml PBS, or 400 mg human lung tissue in 1 ml PBS. Lung homogenates (100 ul) or 100 ng human or murine recom-
binant IL-33 (Biolegend) were then mixed with 1 mg HpARI in PBS containing 100 ug/ml OVA protein, and incubated for 30 min at
37�C. Complexes were then added to coated dynabeads, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and unbound material
collected. Bound material on beads was washed 3 times in PBS+0.02% PBS on a DynaMag-2 magnet, before transferring to a fresh
tube and eluting bound complexes using 50 mM glycine pH 2.8 (non-denaturing), before neutralising in 1M Tris buffer, pH 8. Eluted
proteins and unbound supernatants were ran on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels (Thermo Fisher) under non-reducing conditions, and trans-
ferred to nitrocellulose membranes for western blotting.

 Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
SPR measurements were performed using a BIAcore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chips
were purchased from GE Healthcare. HpARI was immobilised on an NTA sensor surface to 400 RU, which gave essential zero base-
line drift over the time course of the experiments performed: the apparent k- for the His-tagged HpARI Ni2+-NTA surfaces was signif-
icantly slower than the complex being studied �5310-5 s-1 for HpARI-Ni-NTA vs �14-400310-5 s-1 for HpARI-IL-33, therefore short
cycle (400-600 s total run times) single kinetic analysis could be reliably performed. Following Ni2+ priming (30 sec injection of 500 mM
NiCl2 at 5 ml$min-1) 50 nM HpARI, in 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 50 mM EDTA; 0.05% surfactant P20, was captured via
the 6-His tag by injection for 15 seconds, at 30 ml$min-1. Surface regeneration between cycles and/or experiments was performed by
dissociating any immobilised His-tagged protein or complex by a 90 s injection of 350 mM EDTA, in 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5; 150 mM
NaCl; 0.05% surfactant P20 followed by a 30 s injection of 50 mM NaOH at the same flow rate.
SPR kinetic titration binding experiments were performed at 25�C. Three-fold dilution series of mIL-33 (6.2 nM to 167 nM) or hIL-33
(0.062 mM to 1.67 mM), were injected over the sensor surface, in 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 50 mM EDTA; 0.05%
surfactant P20, at 30 ml.min-1 for 30 s followed by a 60 s dissociation phase. The same concentration series of mIL-33/hIL-33
were ran over Ni2+-charged NTA surfaces, and showed no evidence of non-specific interaction of mIL-33/hIL-33 interacting with
these surfaces. All experiments were performed on Ni2+-charged surfaces following non-specific binding assessment and were
double referenced using similar blank surface responses for run-noise corrections. The on- (k+) and off-rate (k–) constants and the
equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) were calculated by global fitting all three surfaces simultaneously to a 1:1 interaction model,
with mass transport considerations, to the double reference corrected sensorgrams, using analysis software (v.2.01, GE Healthcare)
provided with the BIAcore T200 instrument.
Both interactions were extremely well fit by a simple 1:1 interaction model (Chi2 values of 0.457 and 0.395, mIL-33 and hIL-33
respectively), with RUmax values close to the theoretical maximum expected for a 1:1 stoichiometric interaction with high specific
activity (� 180 RU; 173 RU and 169.3 RU, mIL-33 and hIL-33 respectively) and showed no evidence of mass transport issues.
Human Lung Explant Culture
Approximately 5 g of lung tissue was washed 3 times in PBS and �0.5 mm2 tissue explants prepared using sterilized scissors.
Explants were incubated in 400 ml PBS+0.1% BSA +/- 10 mg/ml HpARI in wells of a 48-well tissue culture plate (Costar) for 1 h, at
37�C, 5% CO2. Each condition was performed with 8 replicates for IL-33 measurement by ELISA, and pairs of supernatants were
pooled (to make 4 replicates) for IL-33 western blot. After culture, tissue pieces were weighed, and IL-33 levels calculated relative
to tissue weight.
Gel Shift Assay
Linearized Not-HF-cut pSecTAG2A plasmid (10 ng) was mixed with HpARI, CCP1/2 and CCP2/3 proteins, in 10 mM TrisCl, 1 mM
EDTA, and incubated for 30 min at 37�C. Complexes were ran on a 0.7% agarose gel and imaged with Gelred (Biotium).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All data was analyzed using Prism (Graphpad Software Inc.). Where two groups were compared, Student’s t-test was used, where
there were 3 or more groups, one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni’s post test was used, and for comparing groups at multiple
timepoints two-way ANOVA with a Sidak’s post test was used. **** = p<0.0001, *** = p<0.001, ** = p<0.01, * = p<0.05, N.S. = Not
Significant (p>0.05).
