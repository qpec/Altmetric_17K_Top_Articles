Abstract
Purpose: There is evolving evidence that children and adolescents with gender dysphoria have higher-than-
expected rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet clinical data on ASD among youth with gender dysphoria
remain limited, particularly in North America. This report aims to fill this gap.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patient chart data from 39 consecutive youth ages 8 to 20 years
(mean age 15.8 years, natal male: n = 22, natal female: n = 17) presenting for evaluation at a multidisciplinary
gender clinic in a large U.S. pediatric hospital from 2007 to 2011 to evaluate the prevalence of ASD in this pa-
tient population.
Results: Overall, 23.1% of patients (9/39) presenting with gender dysphoria had possible, likely, or very likely
Asperger syndrome as measured by the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS).
Conclusion: These findings are consistent with growing evidence supporting increased prevalence of ASD in
gender dysphoric children. To guide provision of optimal clinical care and therapeutic intervention, routine as-
sessment of ASD is recommended in youth presenting for gender dysphoria.
Keywords: Asperger syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, gender dysphoria, transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual,
and transgender (LGBT) youth.
Introduction
T
here is evolving evidence that children and adoles-
cents with gender dysphoria have higher than expected
rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).1–3 Gender dyspho-
ria denotes a persistent incongruence between one’s biologic
sex and current gender identity causing clinically significant
distress and impairment.4 The association of gender dyspho-
ria with ASD, with cases often categorized as Asperger
syndrome (AS), was initially reported in a series of case re-
ports.5–7 The association was measured more formally in a
Dutch study which reported a 7.8% prevalence of ASD in pa-
tients presenting for evaluation at a gender dysphoria clinic,8
a rate much higher than expected based on the prevalence of
ASD in the general population. In addition, children with
ASD seen at a large U.S. hospital-based neuropsychology
clinic were 7.59 times more likely than non-referred children
to have gender variance as measured by the parent-reported
Child Behavior Checklist.9
However, clinical data on ASD among youth with gender
dysphoria remain limited, particularly in North America
where no published studies, to our knowledge, have formally
evaluated the prevalence of children and adolescents with
ASD presenting with gender dysphoria. The current study
aimed to fill this gap by providing a descriptive analysis of
ASD data from youth patients referred to a multidisciplinary
gender clinic in a large U.S. pediatric hospital.
Methods
We reviewed clinical data from 39 consecutive patients
ages 8 to 20 years (mean age 15.8 years, natal male:
n = 22, natal female: n = 17) presenting for evaluation at a
multidisciplinary gender clinic from 2007 to 2011 based in
a large U.S. pediatric hospital. All study activities were ap-
proved by the Boston Children’s Hospital Institutional
Review Board, and patient data were protected by use of
sound research methods and use of de-identified data.

 As part of an initial evaluation, a single clinic psychologist
performed a battery of psychological assessments, routinely
administering the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale
(ASDS)10 in an attempt to identify children who may have
co-occurring gender dysphoria and ASD. The ASDS was
designed for use in children ages 5-to-18 years and was val-
idated in a sample of 115 children with the diagnosis of AS.11
It is a parent-completed, pen-and-paper measure containing
50 statements that are rated as observed or not observed.
The statements describe AS-typical behaviors within 5 sub-
scales: language (9 items), social (13 items), maladaptive
(11 items), cognitive (10 items), and sensorimotor (7
items). For example, an item within the social subscale,
‘‘Avoids or limits eye contact,’’ provides the parent with
choices ‘‘Observed’’ or ‘‘Not observed.’’ The total number
of observed items within the subscale yields the subscale’s
raw score with corresponding percentiles within each sub-
scale. Adding together these subscale raw scores yields a
total raw score that is converted into an Asperger Syndrome
Quotient (ASQ). The ASQ translates to a ‘‘Probability of
Asperger Syndrome.’’ Probabilities are expressed as ‘‘Very
likely’’ (ASQ >110), ‘‘Likely’’ (ASQ 90–110), ‘‘Possibly’’
(ASQ 80–89), ‘‘Unlikely’’ (ASQ 70–79), and ‘‘Very unlike-
ly’’ (ASQ £69).10 The ASDS was chosen as a clinical tool for
our program because it could be administered and scored
quickly, serving as a screening tool for ASD.
Data were extracted manually from individual patient
charts by one member of the study team and entered into
Excel. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, standard
deviations) were conducted.
Results
Overall, 9 of the 39 participants (23.1%) had an ASQ
above 80, corresponding to a ‘‘Probability of Asperger Syn-
drome’’ of ‘‘Possibly’’ (n = 1), ‘‘Likely’’ (n = 6), or ‘‘Very
likely’’ (n = 2) (Figure 1). Of these nine participants scoring
highly on the ASDS, 5 were assigned a male sex at birth and
4 were assigned a female sex at birth. Average age at evalu-
ation of the high ASQ group was 16.2 years (range 12.0–
18.8). The prevalence of ASDS among natal males (22.7%,
n = 5/22) and natal females (23.5%, n = 4/17) in our patient
population was not significantly different (Fisher’s exact
test P = 0.95).
Prior to presenting to the gender clinic, one patient had a
long-standing diagnosis of autism, one had a long-standing
diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, and two had been recently
given a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome by a referring psy-
chologist. Subscale analysis of the 9 patients with high
ASQ scores demonstrates highest scores in the cognitive sub-
scale, followed by the maladaptive subscale (Figure 2).
Review of documentation would suggest that the identified
patients represent a range of autism severity with more rep-
resentation in the high-functioning end of the clinical spec-
trum. None of the four patients already diagnosed with an
ASD had been diagnosed with other mental health disorders.

 Of the five patients not previously diagnosed with an ASD,
four had been diagnosed with other mental health disorders
(Table 1). Comparison of rates of co-morbid mental health
disorders between patients with high versus low ASQ scores
was not performed; previous description of this clinic’s pa-
tient population demonstrated a rate of significant psychiatric
history at presentation at 44.3%.12
Discussion
This is the first report of formal screening for ASD in pa-
tients presenting to a North American child and adolescent
gender clinic. Our finding, that 23% of patients presenting
with gender dysphoria had possible, likely, or very likely
Asperger syndrome as measured by the ASDS, is consistent
with growing evidence of increased prevalence of ASD in
gender dysphoric children.1–3,8 This number is higher than
the previously published co-occurrence rate of 7.8% in the
Dutch pediatric gender clinic, however the numbers should
not be compared directly since we used a screening tool
while the Dutch group used a diagnostic test, the Diagnostic
Interview for Social and Communication Disorders—10th
Revision.8 It is interesting to note the near equal rate of pos-
itively screened males and females. This finding conflicts
with the typical male prevalence of ASD.
The evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents
with gender dysphoria is guided by professional guidelines
or standards of care.13,14 These guidelines suggest evaluation
by a mental health professional who not only explores the di-
agnosis of gender dysphoria, but who also assesses for co-
occurring mental health conditions. Anxiety, depression,
and suicidality are common in children and adolescents pre-
senting to gender clinics.15,16 The psychological evaluation
performed is not standardized, with different clinics perform-
ing diverse batteries of psychological testing.12,17,18 Our data
support inclusion of ASD screening as part of any compre-
hensive gender assessment, especially as diagnosis of ASD
has implications for management of gender dysphoria. For
example, a patient with ASD and gender dysphoria may re-
quire specialized psychosocial interventions, focused on
navigating unique social challenges encountered during hor-
monal and social transition from the natal sex to the affirmed
gender. Youth have the right to appropriate assessment, diag-
nosis, and treatment of both ASD and gender dysphoria to
ensure optimal clinical care.
A limitation of this study is that we report results of a
screening test that is not validated as an ASD diagnostic
tool in the absence of other confirmatory information. It is im-
portant to restate that the ASDS was not validated in a general
population-based sample, but rather in a sample of 115 chil-
dren with the diagnosis of AS. This limits our ability to know
how closely we are measuring true ASD. For example, some
items on the ASDS may be naturally observed in non-ASD
gender dysphoric youth. Specifically, an item on the cogni-
tive subscale ‘‘appears to be aware that he or she is different
from others,’’ and an item on the maladaptive subscale ‘‘does
not change behavior to match the environment,’’ might cap-
ture expected observations in a gender dysphoric child. Thus,
scrupulous attention to symptomology during ASD diagnos-
tic evaluation of gender non-conforming youth is essential to
minimize any risk of misclassifying gender dysphoric youth
with high functioning ASD due to symptom overlap (e.g.,
feeling different from peers, social isolation, etc.). Impor-
tantly, certain symptoms may be associated with both diag-
noses, but stem from vastly different origins. Another
consideration is the potential for presentation bias. First, chil-
dren with ASD may be more likely to express their gender
dysphoria than children without ASD. ASD may minimize
awareness of social stigma, the same stigma that might
cause non-ASD children to repress gender dysphoria. Sec-
ond, children with co-occurring ASD and gender dysphoria
may be more likely to be referred to a specialty center than
other children with gender dysphoria, who may be managed
locally. Therefore, our findings describe rates of positively
screened ASD in children presenting for medical assessment
and management of gender dysphoria to a specialty referral
center, as opposed to the general co-occurrence of ASD
and gender dysphoria. The true relationship of ASD and gen-
der dysphoria requires a population-based study design.
Finally, this is a retrospective chart review and results should
be further examined using prospective research methods.
Conclusion
Our findings are consistent with growing evidence sup-
porting increased prevalence of ASD in gender dysphoric

 children. Future research is needed to validate measures of
ASD for use with a gender dysphoric patient population. In
addition, longitudinal follow-up studies of co-occurring gen-
der dysphoria and ASD will allow for better quantification of
the problem and improved understanding of etiological fac-
tors. Differences in androgen exposures on the developing
fetal brain have been suggested as a potential contributor
in gender development19–22 as well as in the development
of ASD.23,24 Genetic factors have also been implicated in
both ASD25 and gender dysphoria.26 In addition, it has
been proposed that the social rigidity typical of ASD contrib-
utes to inflexibility of gender and contributes to increased
prevalence of ASD in gender dysphoric children.8 Gaining
scientific and clinical insight into children and adolescents
with co-occurring gender dysphoria and ASD could advance
understanding of development of both gender and autism, as
well as guide diagnostic practices, clinical care, and thera-
peutic intervention. To guide provision of optimal clinical
care and therapeutic intervention, we recommend routine as-
sessment of ASD in youth presenting for gender dysphoria.
