Abstract.
Background: National Football League (NFL) players are exposed to multiple head collisions during their careers. Increasing
awareness of the adverse long-term effects of repetitive head trauma has raised substantial concern among players, medical
professionals, and the general public.
Objective: To determine whether low perfusion in specific brain regions on neuroimaging can accurately separate professional
football players from healthy controls.
Method: A cohort of retired and current NFL players (n = 161) were recruited in a longitudinal study starting in 2009 with
ongoing interval follow up. A healthy control group (n = 124) was separately recruited for comparison. Assessments included
medical examinations, neuropsychological tests, and perfusion neuroimaging with single photon emission computed tomog-
raphy (SPECT). Perfusion estimates of each scan were quantified using a standard atlas. We hypothesized that hypoperfusion
particularly in the orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, anterior temporal, hippocampal, amygdala, insular, caudate, superior/mid
occipital, and cerebellar sub-regions alone would reliably separate controls from NFL players. Cerebral perfusion differences
were calculated using a one-way ANOVA and diagnostic separation was determined with discriminant and automatic linear
regression predictive models.
Results: NFL players showed lower cerebral perfusion on average (p < 0.01) in 36 brain regions. The discriminant analysis
subsequently distinguished NFL players from controls with 90% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 94% accuracy (95% CI
95-99). Automatic linear modeling achieved similar results. Inclusion of age and clinical co-morbidities did not improve
diagnostic classification.
Conclusion: Specific brain regions commonly damaged in traumatic brain injury show abnormally low perfusion on SPECT
in professional NFL players. These same regions alone can distinguish this group from healthy subjects with high diagnostic
accuracy. This study carries implications for the neurological safety of NFL players.

INTRODUCTION
The current public dialogue regarding the possi-

opposing perspectives [1]. The genesis of this recent
debate was the discovery of neuropsychiatric symp-
toms linked to a distinct neuropathological entity
in former National Football League (NFL) play-
ers, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [2, 3].
Noticeably lacking in this dialogue are assertions
weighted in data from living professional football
players. Several small studies have described struc-
tural and functional brain abnormalities in this group.
One study of 28 former NFL players found lower
hippocampal volumes in those with a history of con-
cussion leading to loss of consciousness compared
to 27 controls [4]. This same cohort was found to
have white matter tract abnormalities on diffusion
tensor imaging correlating to increased symptoms of
depression [5]. A separate functional MRI study of 54
retired NFL players compared to 53 controls found
hypoconnectivity and hyperactivation in the frontal
lobes suggestive of executive dysfunction [6].
Other studies have shown increased structural
abnormalities [7] and neuropsychiatric deficits in
NFL players. A study of 30 retired players found
a lifetime history of concussions correlated to
increased depressive symptoms on the Beck Depres-
sion Inventory II test [8]. In a larger group of 1,044
former players surveyed, the increased risk of depres-
sion persists at least up to 9 years after retirement
[9] and this association was independent of declin-
ing physical health. Currently, there is a relative
lack of data on i) What regions are neurophysio-
logically impaired in living NFL players compared
to healthy controls; ii) How well these brain abnor-
malities distinguish possible repetitive concussive
and subconcussive pathology in NFL players from
healthy individuals; and iii) What specific brain areas
are most predictive of such a classification. The pur-
pose of this work is to address these questions in a
large NFL cohort with functional imaging data and
predictive data analytics. We specifically hypothe-
size that areas of abnormally low cerebral perfusion
on single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) imaging in NFL players compared to con-
trols will reliably separate these groups with high
accuracy.
METHODS
Study participants
Starting in 2009, we recruited a cohort of retired
and current NFL players (n = 161; mean age = 52 ±
14.2 years) as described in prior work [10] along
with a control group of healthy individuals (n = 124;
mean age = 44 ± 16.6 years, M:F 44%:56%). Play-
ers were recruited from 27 teams and all positions
(Integ Review IRB Certificate Number: 004). All
recruitment was done in accordance with Institutional
Review Board approval. Inclusion criteria were being
on an active NLF roster for a minimum of 1 year.
Exclusion criteria were any subjects that could not
discontinue psychoactive medications for an appro-
priate period prior to functional neuroimaging. Each
study participant was interviewed by a board certified
psychiatrist, completed a 315 intake questionnaire
of mental and physical health, and was given either
the Microcog Assessment of Cognitive Functioning
[11] or WebNeuro [12] computerized neuropsycho-
logical battery. Concussion history from high school
through NFL play, including loss of consciousness,
was obtained from each study participant. Concus-
sions were defined using the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) [13] criteria “condi-
tions of temporarily altered mental status as a result
of head trauma” that may or may not involve a loss
of consciousness.
Functional perfusion neuroimaging
All subjects (n = 285) received functional per-
fusion neuroimaging with SPECT as described in
previous studies [14, 15]. Briefly, each participant
received an appropriate dose of technetium-99 m hex-
amethylpropyleneamine (HMPAO) intravenously.
The injection was done in normal room lighting while
eachsubjectperformedtheConnors’ContinuousPer-
formance Test II [16]. Regional cerebral blood flow
was modeled in 128 regions using a standard neu-
roanatomical atlas [17] as previously described [14,
15]. Age, gender, and race corrections were done in
the analyses.
Predictive data analytics
All statistical analyses were performed in Statisti-
cal Package for Social Science (SPSS, version 23,
IBM, Armonk, NY) and were controlled for both
age and gender. To identify specific brain regions
we hypothesize are predictive in distinguishing NFL
players from controls, a one-way ANOVA was con-
ducted to identify regions of low perfusion in NFL
players compared to controls. In all, 36 regions out
of the 128 tested met our cutoff level for statisti-
cal significance (p < 0.01). These regions were then
used to classify NFL players from controls with two

separate predictive data analytic methods. The first
was discriminant analysis using a leave-one-out cross
validation [18] followed by extraction of predicted
probabilities from this model. These probabilities
were then used to determine diagnostic sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy from input into receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) and Area Under the
Curve (AUC) analyses. The second approach was the
automatic linear modeling (ALM) approach in SPSS
[19] done to verify the diagnostic accuracy metrics
obtained from the discriminant analysis and to pro-
vide a ranking of the most predictive features from
the 36 brain regions initially selected for the analysis.
RESULTS
All NFL players were male, while 56% of the
control group were women. The control group was

Fig. 1. Example of a volume rendered of the undersurface of the
brain in normal control compared to a 12-year NFL player. While
the control subject has symmetric activity, the NFL player has mul-
tiple defects in the inferior frontal and temporal lobes suggestive
of concussion related hypoperfusion.
56% Caucasian, while the NFL group was 53%. In
the NFL group, baseline neuropsychological assess-
ments showed 92% of players had decreased general
cognitive proficiency, 86% had decreased informa-
tion processing speed, 83% had memory loss, 83%
had attentional deficits, and 85% had executive
function impairment. The most common psychiatric
co-morbidities in the NFL players were depression
(29%), anxiety (22%), and attention deficit hyperac-
tivity disorder (ADHD) (13%). In the NFL cohort,
3% had a history of substance abuse. In total, 36
brain regions were found to have abnormally low
blood flow on functional perfusion neuroimaging on
ANOVA (p < 0.01, average F-value 29.51 ± 16.76.
These regions are listed in Table 1. Figure 1 shows a
visual 3-D rendering of a SPECT scan of a 12-year
NFL player compared to a control subject.
Predictive modeling
The discriminant analysis yielded a correct clas-
sification rate of 87% with the leave-one-out cross
validation at 82%. The corresponding accuracy of the
linear discriminant probabilities in identifying NFL
players from controls was 94.4% based upon AUC
analysis with 90% sensitivity and 86% specificity.
The automatic linear modeling analysis produced
essentially identical results with 95% accuracy (95%
CI: 92.6-97.6), 90% sensitivity and 87% specificity.
The diagnostic metrics of these two models do
not change when adding demographic co-variates
such as age, gender, and race or co-morbidities
such as depression or ADHD. Based upon the auto-
mated linear modeling, the most important regions in
 240

predicting NFL players from controls were the i)
anterior superior temporal lobes, ii) rolandic oper-
culum, iii) insula, iv) superior temporal poles, v)
precuneus, and vi) cerebellar vermis. The accuracy
estimates from these models did not change when
accounting for age, gender, or co-morbidities such as
anxiety, depression, or ADHD by including them as
co-variates in both discriminant and automatic lin-
ear regression models. Additionally, the results of
these predictive models were not significantly differ-
entwhenfemalesubjectswereentirelyexcludedfrom
the analysis. For example, in the discriminant analy-
sis, the accuracy was 92%, sensitivity was 86%, and
specificity was 81%. The correct classification was
86% and 80% with a leave-one-out validation with
females completely excluded from the analysis.
DISCUSSION
Former and current NFL players have lower
cerebral perfusion and impaired neuropsychological
function compared to healthy controls. The regional
perfusion abnormalities alone reliably separate these
individuals from controls with high accuracy in two
separate predictive analytic models. The result of our
study advances the literature in living NFL players by
characterizing regional abnormalities and their abil-
ity to distinguish players from controls in the largest
known imaging study of this population. The main
caveats to our data are its retrospective design and
lack of NFL players with no traumatic brain injury
(TBI) to serve as an NFL control group thus necessi-
tating our use of a non-NFL control group.
Playing professional football has been correlated
with alterations on structural and molecular neu-
roimaging [20] and our study adds several key
insights. First results of low perfusion in the frontal
and temporal lobes match what is known from a
prior systematic review of the literature identifying
the most common abnormalities on SPECT in mild
TBI [21]. Second, involvement of the hippocam-
pus and precuneus suggest neural correlates for poor
memory function in our NFL subjects and increased
risk for dementia [22]. Abnormally low flow in the
insula is consistent with literature correlating perfu-
sion decreases in this structure with depression, a
common co-morbidity in our study [23]. Low flow in
thecerebellarvermisisrelevantasmildTBIinvolving
this structure in diffusion tensor imaging is related to
anxiety, also a common co-morbidity in our popula-
tion [24]. From a network perspective, the abnormal
brain regions in this study are most commonly found
in the default mode network and frontal-parietal net-
work, both of which are implicated in Alzheimer’s
disease and psychiatric disorders [25]. We had previ-
ously used default mode network regions to separate
veterans with histories of TBI from healthy controls
with 94% accuracy [15]. Also of note is the corre-
lation between the functional abnormalities seen in
our cohort and the in vivo characterization of CTE on
PET tau imaging with increased deposits in frontal
regions, amygdala, and anterior cingulate [26, 27].
There are several implications of our study to
consider. In this and other studies, it is becoming
increasingly suggestive that playing football at the
professional level is associated with brain abnormal-
ities in players. Longitudinal studies are required at
the pre-teen, high school, and college level to better
characterize the time course of such alternations.
