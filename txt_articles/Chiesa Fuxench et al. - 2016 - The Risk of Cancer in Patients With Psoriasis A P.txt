Abstract
IMPORTANCE—The risk of cancer in patients with psoriasis remains a cause of special concern 
due to the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease, the use of immune-suppressive treatments 
and UV therapies, and the increased prevalence of comorbid, well-established risk factors for 
cancer, such as smoking and obesity, all of which may increase the risk of carcinogenesis.
OBJECTIVE—To compare the overall risk of cancer, and specific cancers of interest, in patients 
with psoriasis compared with patients without psoriasis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Population-based cohort study of patients ages 
18 to 89 years with no medical history of human immunodeficiency virus, cancer, organ 
transplants, or hereditary disease (albinism and xeroderma pigmentosum), prior to the start date, 
conducted using The Health Improvement Network, a primary care medical records database in 
the United Kingdom. The data analyzed had been collected prospectively from 2002 through 
January 2014. The analysis was completed in August 2015.

 EXPOSURES OF INTEREST—Patients with at least 1 diagnostic code for psoriasis were 
classified as having moderate-to-severe disease if they had been prescribed psoralen, methotrexate, 
cyclosporine, acitretin, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, or ustekinumab or phototherapy for 
psoriasis. Patients were classified as having mild disease if they never received treatment with any 
of these agents.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Incident cancer diagnosis.
RESULTS—A total of 937 716 control group patients without psoriasis, matched on date and 
practice visit, and 198 366 patients with psoriasis (186 076 with mild psoriasis and 12 290 with 
moderate-to-severe disease) were included in the analysis. The adjusted hazards ratios (aHRs) with 
95% CIs for any incident cancer excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) were 1.06 (95% 
CI, 1.02-1.09), 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02-1.09), and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.96-1.22) in the overall, mild, and 
severe psoriasis group. The aHRs for incident lymphoma were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18-1.51), 1.31 
(95% CI, 1.15-1.49), and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.25-2.86); for NMSC, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07-1.16), 1.09 
(95% CI, 1.05-1.13), and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.42-1.84); and for lung cancer, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.03-1.27), 
1.12 (95% CI, 1.01-1.25), and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.16-2.28) in the overall, mild, and severe psoriasis 
groups, respectively. No significant association was seen with cancer of the breast, colon, prostate, 
or leukemia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—The association between psoriasis and cancer, albeit 
small, was present in our cohort of patients with psoriasis. This association was primarily driven 
by NMSC, lymphoma, and lung cancer.
The risk of cancer in patients with psoriasis has been of special concern owing to the chronic 
inflammatory nature of the disease, use of immune suppressive treatments and UV therapies, 
and the increased prevalence of comorbid, well-established risk factors for cancer, such as 
smoking, all of which may increase the risk of carcinogenesis.1 Indeed, studies2-8 have 
previously demonstrated that patients with more severe psoriasis are at an increased risk of 
cancer-related mortality, and psoriasis has been associated with an increased risk of cancer, 
including lymphoma. However, these studies have generally not controlled for important 
confounders, and have often failed to examine the rates of specific cancers or the impact of 
disease severity on cancer risk. Furthermore, there have often been conflicting data on the 
risk of specific cancers including lymphoma.1,3,4,6,9 Additional studies are necessary to 
further define the risk of cancer in patients with this disease.
We performed a population-based cohort study using a nationwide, electronic medical 
records database from the United Kingdom to evaluate the association between psoriasis and 
cancer. In addition, our study also evaluated whether the risk of cancer in patients with 
psoriasis could be explained by a specific group of cancers and if this risk was higher in 
patients with more severe disease.
Methods
This study is a population-based cohort study analyzing data that had been collected 
prospectively since 2002 through January 2014 by general practitioners (GPs) in the United 
Kingdom who were unaware of the hypothesis being tested.

 Data Source
Our source of data was The Health Improvement Network (THIN), an electronic medical 
records (EMR) database that contains anonymized medical record information from nearly 
11.9 million patients across the United Kingdom. THIN has been extensively used for 
epidemiological research, and prior studies10-13 have validated the diagnostic accuracy of 
psoriasis and malignant disease codes used in THIN. Participants within THIN are 
considered to be representative of the general population of the United Kingdom in terms of 
their age, sex, geography, and medical diagnoses.14 Information recorded includes patient 
demographics, medical diagnosis, and treatments prescribed, as well as referrals to 
specialists, hospitalizations, and laboratory results. THIN has the advantage over 
administrative claims databases (ie, Medicare) because it contains information on important 
risk factors for cancer, such as smoking, alcohol intake, and body mass index (BMI).15
Study Population
Our initial cohort within THIN consisted of all patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis and 
unexposed controls (ie, those with no recorded diagnosis of psoriasis). All patients with 
psoriasis who were ages 18 to 89 years at the start date and had observation time within 
THIN, after implementation of the EMR, were included. Patients were excluded if they died 
or transferred out of the practice prior to the implementation of EMR. Each patient with 
psoriasis was matched to up to 5 unexposed controls that were also 18 to 89 years at the start 
date and were from the same practice. Unexposed controls were assigned a ”diagnosis” date 
based on having a recorded visit with the GP within 6 months (ie, ±180 days) of the 
corresponding patient’s visit date to the GP. This algorithm was designed to minimize bias 
by ensuring that exposed patients and unexposed controls were followed by similar 
clinicians during similar time periods. Patients were initially excluded from the entire cohort 
if they had a personal history of any cancer, organ transplant, or human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) and/or AIDS, or had a diagnosis of hereditary diseases that have an increased 
susceptibility for developing malignant abnormalities, including albinism and xeroderma 
pigmentosum.
Protection of Study Subjects
This study was developed in accordance with the STROBE guidelines and was approved by 
the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania and by the Scientific Review 
Committee of CSD Medical Research, United Kingdom. This study was a population-based 
study using data already collected for these purposes. Data were collected by a third party 
and deidentified before they were made available for research purposes. Because our study 
analyzed data already collected for these purposes, patient consent was not required.
Definition of Exposure
Patients with psoriasis were identified by the presence of at least one diagnostic Read code 
for psoriasis in the patient’s medical file. Read codes are a comprehensive numerical system 
developed in the United Kingdom to record diagnosis, symptoms, and tests, and is similar to 
the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes.16 The use of Read codes for 
modeling disease outcomes in patients with psoriasis has been previously validated in

 THIN.13 Severity of psoriasis was classified as mild or moderate-to-severe depending on 
whether the patient was prescribed systemic therapy or phototherapy for psoriasis. Patients 
were classified as having moderate-to-severe psoriasis if they had ever received any 
prescription for psoralen, phototherapy, methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, adalimumab, 
etanercept, infliximab, and/or ustekinumab. Patients were classified as having mild disease if 
they had never received treatment with any of these agents. This approach has been used in 
previous studies as a proxy for estimating disease severity.4,17
Person-Time Calculation
For exposed patients (ie, those who received at least 1 diagnostic code for psoriasis) the start 
of follow-up time occurred at the latest of the following: date of first diagnostic code for 
psoriasis in THIN; 180 days after patient registration with the practice; or when the practice 
began recording information using Vision software. For unexposed patients (ie, those with 
no diagnosis of psoriasis) the start time occurred at the latest of 3 dates: 180 days after 
patient registration, when the practice began recording information using Vision software, or 
the closest corresponding visit to the exposed patient’s visit date with the GP (±180 days), 
whichever was latest. Patient follow-up continued for both groups until the earliest of the 
following: first diagnosis of cancer, death, transfer out of the practice, or end of the study 
period.
Outcome of Interest
The outcome of interest was incident cancer diagnosis. Cancer cases were identified using a 
series of Read codes selected a priori by the primary investigator (Z.C.C.F.). Patients were 
classified as having an incident cancer diagnosis if they received a code for any cancer 
(except carcinoma in situ or metastatic cancer) after the start date and on or before the end 
date of the study period. We also selected a priori specific cancer outcomes that were of 
interest to us, as part of secondary outcome analyses, either because prior studies have 
shown a possible association between psoriasis and risk of developing these malignant 
diseases or because they are considered important owing to public health implications.
Covariates
Covariates assessed in multivariable models as potential confounders included age, sex, 
BMI, smoking, and alcohol intake. Age and BMI were treated as continuous variables 
whereas smoking and alcohol intake were treated as categorical variables.
Sample Size
The sample size was fixed as we included all patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis in THIN 
who met our inclusion criteria. Using data on the incidence rates for all cancers, we would 
expect to detect a hazards ratio (HR) of 1.06 to 1.98 for patients with mild psoriasis and 2.02 
to 7.79 for patients with severe disease for specific cancers assuming a 2-sided .05 
significance level with a median follow-up period of 5 years and 80% power.

 Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to examine age, sex, disease severity, person-time, and 
covariate distribution among the cohort with exposed psoriasis and the control group. χ2 
Test was used to examine dichotomous variables. The nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney rank sum test was used to examine the continuous variables age and BMI. The rates 
of incident cancer diagnosis were descriptively reported as the cumulative incidence with 
95% CIs for all cancers overall and stratified by cancer type in controls and patients with 
mild and severe psoriasis, separately. An unadjusted Cox proportional hazards model was 
then used to determine the HRs with 95% CIs for incident cancer diagnosis. The overall 
models were then adjusted for age and sex and were also adjusted for additional covariates 
using a purposeful selection modeling approach.18 Covariates with biological plausible 
relationship to the exposure and outcome and those that resulted in a change in the point 
estimates of the main effects by more than 10% were kept in the final model. Multivariate 
models were examined for proportionality using diagnostic log-log plots. Finally, we 
performed multiple sensitivity analyses to test the underlying assumptions of our primary 
analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA statistical software (version 13; 
Stata Corp).
Results
We identified 937 716 controls and 198 366 patients with psoriasis; 186 076 were classified 
as having mild psoriasis, and 12 290 were classified as having moderate-to-severe disease 
based on having received treatment with either phototherapy or systemic therapies (Table 1). 
Overall, patients with psoriasis were younger, had higher BMI, and a greater proportion 
were male and current smokers compared with controls. In patients with moderate-to-severe 
disease, the most commonly prescribed systemic therapy was methotrexate (69.48%) (Table 
2).
The mean follow-up time across all outcomes varied from 6.39 to 6.57 years in the control 
group and 6.06 to 6.22 in the overall psoriasis group. The mean follow-up time in the mild 
and moderate-to-severe psoriasis group varied from 6.11 to 6.28 years, and 5.20 to 5.35 
years, respectively. For all cancers, excluding NMSC, the number of new cancer cases 
identified was 32 241 in the control group and 6289 in the overall psoriasis group, of which 
5490 were in the mild psoriasis group and 2186 in the moderate-to-severe psoriasis group. 
Unadjusted HRs with 95% CI showed that patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis had a 
statistically significant higher risk of any lymphoma (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.12-2.55); 
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) (HR, 8.86; 95% CI, 3.53-22.20); lung cancer (HR, 
1.73; 95% CI, 1.26-2.39); and NMSC (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.23-1.60) compared with patients 
without psoriasis (Table 3).
The adjusted HR with 95% CI for specific cancer types are summarized in the Figure. Fully 
adjusted models showed a statistically significant increased risk for any cancer excluding 
NMSC, lymphoma, CTCL, lung cancer, and NMSC in patients with any psoriasis compared 
with controls, with this risk being higher in patients classified as having moderate-to-severe 
disease. A similar association was seen for any lymphoma, excluding CTCL, melanoma, and 
pancreatic cancer, where an increased risk was seen across all 3 groups; however, results

 were not statistically significant in the moderate-to-severe psoriasis group. In fully adjusted 
models, no statistically significant increased risk was observed across any of the groups for 
leukemia, breast, prostate, or colon cancer (Table 3).
Results were robust to a number of sensitivity analyses (Table 4). Because smoking is an 
especially strong risk factor for lung cancer, we performed additional sensitivity analyses 
with the fully adjusted model limited to patients who were classified as never smokers. In 
this model, the association between psoriasis and lung cancer was lost in the overall (HR, 
0.98; 95% CI, 0.76-1.25) and mild (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.75-1.24) group and was decreased 
in the severe psoriasis group (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.44-3.17). In contrast, an age- and sex-
adjusted model for lung cancer including only patients classified as current smokers showed 
a positive association between psoriasis and risk of lung cancer across all study groups.
Discussion
Prior studies evaluating the risk of cancer in patients with psoriasis have often shown 
conflicting results. Our results are consistent with those of a meta-analysis1 that showed a 
small increased risk of cancer overall excluding NMSC (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25). As 
expected, we observed an increased risk for NMSC and lymphoma. In both instances, this 
risk was highest in patients with psoriasis who received systemic treatment or phototherapy. 
In patients defined as having moderate-to-severe disease, the HR for incident NMSC was 
1.61 (95% CI, 1.42-1.84). The risk for NMSC in patients with psoriasis has been previously 
described in the literature and has been primarily attributed to phototherapy exposure, 
particularly psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA).1,9,19,20 Chen et al6 postulated that although 
systemic medications, including PUVA, increased the risk of cancer in patients with 
psoriasis, they are not the sole cause of malignant neoplasms seen in this population. Indeed, 
multiple studies have suggested that in the case of lymphoma, including CTCL, prolonged 
immune stimulation could potentially lead to the development of a dominant clone which in 
turn promotes lymphomagenesis.4,21,22 Our results showed that patients with psoriasis had 
an increased risk of any lymphoma across all study groups (overall: HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 
1.18-1.51]; mild disease: HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.15-1.49]; and moderate-to-severe disease: 
HR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.25-2.86]). These results replicate those of Gelfand et al3 who, using a 
similar study population and case definition, found that patients with mild psoriasis had 
increased risk for any lymphoma (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.54) and patients with moderate-
to-severe disease had increased risk (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.88-2.89) compared with patients 
without psoriasis.
The risk for common solid organ malignant neoplasms, breast, colon, and prostate cancer 
was not higher than the general population. This finding suggests that positive associations 
seen for other internal malignant neoplasms, lymphoma, and lung cancer are not likely 
owing to screening bias. In our age-, sex-, and smoking-adjusted model, patients with 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis had an approximately 60% increased risk of developing lung 
cancer compared with patients without psoriasis (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.16-2.28). Three 
prospective cohort studies23-25 showed a positive association between psoriasis and lung 
cancer; however, models were not adjusted for smoking. In 2 prior studies in which 
adjustment for smoking was performed, one8 found no positive association between

 psoriasis and lung cancer (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.60-1.06), and the 
other26 resulted in loss of the association when adjusting for this risk factor (HR, 1.3; 95% 
CI, 0.8-2.0). In additional sensitivity analyses, we showed a loss of this association when 
only including patients who were classified as never smokers. However, in models including 
only patients classified as former or current smokers, this association persisted. This 
observation would suggest that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer in patients 
with psoriasis is more complex.
We found no clear association between psoriasis and either melanoma or pancreatic cancer. 
In the case of melanoma, results from prior studies have been mixed. Chen et al6 found an 
increased risk for melanoma in Taiwanese patients with psoriasis compared with patients 
without psoriasis (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.24-7.71). A more recent study27 found that patients 
with psoriasis had a lower probability of developing melanoma when compared with a group 
of nondermatological patients. With respect to pancreatic cancer, a standardized incidence 
ratio (SIR) of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.10-1.95) has been previously reported, which is somewhat 
similar to our results (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04-1.51).1 Interestingly, Brauchli et al8 also 
found an increased incidence rate of pancreatic cancer in patients with psoriasis overall (HR, 
2.20; 95% CI, 1.18-4.09). Our results showed a positive association across all study groups, 
yet we found no evidence of a dose-response effect with psoriasis severity. Chronic systemic 
inflammation, such as that seen in patients with severe psoriasis, has been postulated as a 
potential risk factor for pancreatic cancer.28 Chronic alcohol consumption, which is 
reportedly higher in this population and often results in chronic pancreatitis, could be a 
contributing factor.29,30
Our study has certain strengths. We used a large, population-based database that has been 
used in similar epidemiological studies and contains information on well-established risk 
factors for cancer. We provide further evidence that the risk of cancer in patients with 
psoriasis, albeit small, applies to a specific group of cancers, including NMSC, lymphoma, 
and lung cancer. Nonetheless, our study has certain limitations. First, because THIN does 
not capture information on disease severity using physician-assessed measures, we used 
treatment exposure as a proxy for disease severity. This limited our ability to separate the 
effect of disease severity from the effect of treatment exposure on cancer risk. Second, the 
effect of biologic therapies on cancer risk cannot be properly assessed because the use of 
these medications is more restricted in the UK and therefore may not be readily captured 
within THIN. While data on the effect of treatment on cancer risk in patients with psoriasis 
are limited, studies31-33 in patients with other systemic inflammatory diseases, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, who are exposed to similar immune suppressive medications, have 
shown that the risk of malignant neoplasms cannot be entirely explained by exposure to 
these types of systemic medications. Third, while data on well-established risk factors for 
cancer (ie, smoking), are available within THIN, greater efforts need to be made to improve 
the capture of these risk factors in large population-based databases if we are to further 
clarify the impact of psoriasis on cancer risk. Finally, although the risk of NMSC associated 
with PUVA treatment has been previously demonstrated, there are limited data to support 
that exposure to UV-B therapy, including narrowband UV-B, also increases this risk.20,34 In 
addition, we could not adjust for exposure to environmental UV radiation, a strong risk 
factor for NMSC,35 because these data are not collected in EMR databases such as THIN.

 Misclassification could also have resulted in an increased estimate for c ancer risk. For 
example, it is well known that patients with CTCL are sometimes incorrectly classified as 
having psoriasis, resulting in a biased positive association. Yet, it is unlikely that the 
misdiagnosis of psoriasis would completely explain this association. In the United Kingdom, 
patients who require initiation of systemic treatment would have been seen by a 
dermatologist prior to the start of therapy; therefore, we would expect most of these patients 
to be correctly classified as having psoriasis and not CTCL.4
Finally, surveillance bias could have affected our results because patients with severe 
psoriasis might be followed more closely than their counterparts who do not have psoriasis 
or only have mild disease. We performed additional analyses limiting our entire cohort to 
patients seen at least once a year by their GP and observed similar results. In addition, if 
there was surveillance bias, we would have expected to see an increased risk of common 
cancers, such as breast, prostate, and colon cancer, and this was not observed. Care must be 
taken when interpreting our findings; in some cases our effects were small and could be 
related to chance because multiple outcomes were evaluated.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our data suggest that there is a small increased risk of cancer overall in 
patients with psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis who received treatment with systemic 
medications or phototherapy were shown to be at a higher risk for malignant neoplasms 
compared with controls. Future work should be aimed at developing a better understanding 
of the effect of disease severity and treatment exposure separately on cancer risk in this 
population. Dermatologists who care for patients with psoriasis should consider 
incorporating current cancer screening guidelines and counseling, such as smoking 
cessation, into their daily practice.
