IMPORTANCE The risk of osteoporotic fracture with dabigatran use in patients with
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk of osteoporotic fracture with dabigatran vs warfarin
in patients with NVAF.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study using a population-wide
database managed by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Patients newly diagnosed
with NVAF from 2010 through 2014 and prescribed dabigatran or warfarin were
matched by propensity score at a 1:2 ratio with follow-up until July 31, 2016.
EXPOSURES Dabigatran or warfarin use during the study period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of osteoporotic hip fracture and vertebral fracture
was compared between dabigatran and warfarin users using Poisson regression.
The corresponding incidence rate ratio (IRR) and absolute risk difference (ARD)
with 95% CIs were calculated.
RESULTS Among 51 496 patients newly diagnosed with NVAF, 8152 new users of dabigatran
(n = 3268) and warfarin (n = 4884) were matched by propensity score (50% women;
mean [SD] age, 74 [11] years). Osteoporotic fracture developed in 104 (1.3%) patients during
follow-up (32 dabigatran users [1.0%]; 72 warfarin users [1.5%]). Results of Poisson
regression analysis showed that dabigatran use was associated with a significantly lower risk
of osteoporotic fracture compared with warfarin (0.7 vs 1.1 per 100 person-years; ARD per
100 person-years, −0.68 [95% CI, −0.38 to −0.86]; IRR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.66]).
The association with lower risk was statistically significant in patients with a history of falls,
fractures, or both (dabigatran vs warfarin, 1.6 vs 3.6 per 100 person-years; ARD per 100
person-years, −3.15 [95% CI, −2.40 to −3.45]; IRR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.33]), but not in
those without a history (0.6 vs 0.7 per 100 person-years; ARD per 100 person-years, −0.04
[95% CI, 0.67 to −0.39]; IRR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.45 to 1.96]) (P value for interaction, <.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with NVAF receiving anticoagulation,
the use of dabigatran compared with warfarin was associated with a lower risk of
osteoporotic fracture. Additional study, perhaps including randomized clinical trials,
may be warranted to further understand the relationship between use of dabigatran
vs warfarin and risk of fracture.

arfarin is a traditional oral anticoagulant used for
stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular
atrial fibrillation (NVAF). It is a vitamin K antago-
nist that interferes with the γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid
residues, and it consequently inhibits the activation of bone
matrix proteins.1 Several studies have reported the possible
link between warfarin use and an increased risk of osteopo-
rotic fracture.1-4 Particular concern was highlighted by a
population-based study of 14 564 Medicare patients in the
United States in 2006,3 which reported an increased risk of
osteoporotic fracture (odds ratio, 1.25) in patients with atrial
fibrillation (AF) and long-term (≥1 year) warfarin use com-
pared with patients who were not using warfarin. Despite the
concerns for fracture risk, warfarin was an inevitable treat-
ment choice for decades because no other comparable alter-
natives were available.
Dabigatran is the first non–vitamin K antagonist oral an-
ticoagulant approved for use in patients with NVAF. Al-
though most attention has focused on its effect on stroke or
bleeding, a recent animal study reported that the use of dabi-
gatran was associated with higher bone volume, smaller tra-
becular separation, and lower bone turnover rate compared
with warfarin in rats, suggesting potential for a lower risk of
osteoporotic fracture over warfarin.5 Osteoporotic fracture is
a key clinical concern because oral anticoagulants are usually
prescribed to older people for whom fracture is a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality.6 However, the actual risk of
osteoporotic fracture with dabigatran in humans is unde-
fined,anditscomparisonwithwarfarininroutineclinicalprac-
tice is unknown.
This population-based cohort study was conducted to de-
termine and compare the risk of osteoporotic fracture in pa-
tients with NVAF treated with dabigatran or warfarin.
Method
Data Source
This study used the anonymized electronic medical records
of the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS)
of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, a statutory body that
manages all public hospitals and their ambulatory clinics in
Hong Kong.7 The Hong Kong Hospital Authority serves a
population of more than 7 million through 41 hospitals and
institutions, 47 specialist outpatient clinics, and 73 general
outpatient clinics.7 CDARS covers approximately 80% of all
hospital admissions in Hong Kong.8 Electronic patient rec-
ords in the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, including demo-
graphics, date of registered death, date of hospital admission
and discharge, date of consultation, drug dispensing records,
diagnoses, procedures, and laboratory tests, are all central-
ized in CDARS for research and audit purposes. Patient rec-
ords are anonymized to protect patient identity. CDARS had
been extensively used for conducting high-quality large
population-based studies.9-16 Data validation has demon-
strated high coding accuracy in CDARS.9,10,12 Original clinical
records of patients, including radiology reports, results from
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
scans, surgery records, and documentation in medical charts
were reviewed by 2 independent physicians to confirm the
fracture events. A high coding accuracy was found in the
diagnosis for fractures at the hip (positive predictive value
[PPV] = 100%; 104/104 cases), vertebrae (PPV = 86%; 87/101
cases), wrist and forearm (PPV = 100%; 94/94 cases), and
humerus (PPV = 100%; 83/83 cases). Detailed descriptions of
CDARS were reported previously.10,14,16
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital
Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (reference number:UW13-
468). Informed patient consent was not required as the data
used in this study were anonymized.
Study Design and Selection of Patients
This was a retrospective cohort study. New patients were
identified as those who had a first recorded AF (International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
[ICD-9-CM] code 427.3) between January 1, 2010, and
December 31, 2014, in CDARS. To select patients with NVAF
only, patients diagnosed with valvular AF, valvular heart dis-
ease, hyperthyroidism, or those who had undergone valve
replacement (eTable 1 in the Supplement) at or prior to their
first AF occurrence were excluded. Any possible cases of
transient AF, cardiac surgery, myocarditis, pericarditis, or
pulmonary embolism within 3 months before patients’first
AF occurrence were excluded, as were patients with a miss-
ing date of birth or sex, age younger than 18 years, or who
died during their first AF episode (Figure).
Index date was defined as the date of the first recorded
prescription of dabigatran or warfarin following AF diagno-
sis. The follow-up for each patient commenced from the
index date until the occurrence of fracture, death, change of
prescription to another oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabiga-
tran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin), discontinuation of treatment
(>5-day time frame between consecutive prescription refill),
or end of study period (July 31, 2016), whichever came first.
Patients were excluded if they received dabigatran or warfa-
rin within 180 days prior to index date, or if they had a pre-
scription record of other oral anticoagulant use on the index
date (Figure). Patients with bone tumors, epilepsy or history
of seizure recorded any time before index date, or baseline
Key Points
Question What is the risk of osteoporotic fracture associated with
the use of dabigatran compared with warfarin among patients
with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 8152 patients,
use of dabigatran was associated with a significantly lower risk of
osteoporotic fracture compared with warfarin (incidence, 0.7 vs 1.1
per 100 person-years) during a mean follow-up of approximately
500 days.
Meaning Among adults with NVAF receiving anticoagulation, the
use of dabigatran compared with warfarin was associated with a
lower risk of osteoporotic fracture; further studies may be
warranted to assess this further.

use (≤90 days prior to index date) of hormone therapy were
excluded to reduce potential residual confounding effects.17
Outcome
The outcome of interest was a composite of hip fracture (ICD-
9-CM code 820.x) and vertebral fracture (ICD-9-CM code
805.x). To exclude fractures due to trauma, fractures that
accompanied a record of motor vehicle accident (ICD-9-CM
codes E800-E848) on the same date were not included as
outcome events. Patient follow-up was censored at the date
of any fracture associated with motor vehicle accident.
Propensity Score Matching
Propensity score was used to reduce potential bias due to treat-
ment allocation.18 It was estimated by logistic regression in
which the dependent variable was the treatment of interest
(dabigatran),andthecovariatesweretheobservedpatientchar-
acteristics (including age, sex, index year), other risk factors for
osteoporotic fractures3,17 (including medical history [recorded
any time on or before the index date] of congestive heart fail-
ure, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, chronic ob-
structivepulmonarydisease[COPD],diabetesmellitus[detected
by a diagnosis for diabetes mellitus or a recent use of insulin or
antidiabetic drugs within 90 days on or before the index date],
liver disease, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and other in-
flammatory polyarthropathies, chronic kidney disease, his-
tory of falls, and history of fractures (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment), and recent use (≤90 days on or before the index date) of
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II re-
ceptor blockers, β-blockers, bisphosphonates, antidepres-
sants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic an-
tidepressants), and systemic glucocorticoids. Patients using
dabigatran and warfarin were matched at a 1:2 ratio by propen-
sity score using a greedy matching algorithm, which has been
demonstrated to perform well in both actual and simulation
studies.19 Standardized difference was used to assess the dif-
ference between treatment groups of which a value of less than
0.2 was considered negligible.18 At the time of this study, there
was no clear consensus on the criterion for negligible standard-
ized difference.18 Proposed cutoffs for acceptable standard-
ized differences have ranged from 0.1 to 0.25.18,20
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were expressed as mean (standard
deviation [SD]) for continuous variables and as frequencies
(percentages) for categorical variables. The risk of osteopo-
rotic fracture between dabigatran and warfarin users was
compared using Poisson regression stratified on propensity
score–matched groups. The result estimates were expressed
using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% CIs. Absolute risk
difference (ARD) was estimated by I × (IRR–1) (I indicates the
incidence of osteoporotic fracture among warfarin users).21
In the present study, subgroup analyses were conducted to
investigate the risk of osteoporotic fractures in dabigatran and
warfarin users with different treatment durations. A previous
study suggested that only long-term exposure to warfarin
(≥1 year), and not short-term exposure (<1 year), was associ-
ated with an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture.3 There-
fore, 2 subgroup analyses were conducted among patients ex-
posed to dabigatran and warfarin for at least 1 year and for less
than 1 year. Because patients with a history of falls or fractures
are a concerning high-risk group for anticoagulant use due to
potential of fall-related injuries and subsequent risk of exces-
sive bleeding,22 participants were stratified by history of falls,
fractures,orbothtoexploretheeffectofdabigatranagainstwar-
farin. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding frac-
tures that were recorded with falls from higher than standing
height (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Fractures at the humerus
(ICD-9-CM, 812.x) and the forearm and wrist (ICD-9-CM,
813.x-814.x) were included as a composite outcome of osteo-
poroticfracturesinseparateanalyses.Inaddition,analyseswere
repeated with 5% trimming of propensity score to investigate
any bias from unmeasured residual confounding.23 Posthoc

Results
Baseline Characteristics
There were 51 946 patients newly diagnosed with AF identi-
fied in CDARS from January 1, 2010, through December 31,
2014. Following exclusion of ineligible participants, 10 279
new users of dabigatran and warfarin were eligible for pro-
pensity score matching, of whom 8152 were successfully
matched (3268 dabigatran users and 4884 warfarin users;
Figure). All baseline characteristics had standardized dif-
ferences of less than 0.2 after propensity score matching
(Table 1; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). When applying 5%
trimming of propensity score in the sensitivity analysis, all
baseline characteristics had standardized differences of less
than 0.1 (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The mean (SD) age of
the cohort was 74 (11) years, and 4052 patients (50%) were
women. The mean (SD) follow-up was 510 (507) days for the
dabigatran group and 496 (535) days for the warfarin group.
The mean follow-up of the overall cohort was 501 (524) days.
Risk of Osteoporotic Fracture
A total of 129 of 10 279 patients (1.3%) developed osteopo-
rotic fracture during follow-up (34 dabigatran users [1.0%]
and 95 warfarin users [1.4%]; Table 2). In the propensity
score-matched sample, 104 of 8152 patients (1.3%) developed
osteoporotic fracture during follow-up (32 dabigatran users
[1.0%] and 72 warfarin users [1.5%]). The median time to
osteoporotic fracture after the first prescription was 222 days
(interquartile range [IQR], 57-450 days) for dabigatran and
267 days (IQR, 81-638 days) for warfarin.
The results for Poisson regression analysis showed that
dabigatran use was significantly associated with a lower risk
for osteoporotic fracture compared with warfarin (0.7 vs 1.1 per
100 person-years; ARD per 100 person-years, −0.68 [95% CI,
−0.38 to −0.86]; IRR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.66]; Table 3).

The association with lower risk was statistically significant
for patients with short-term exposure (1.1 for dabigatran vs
1.4 for warfarin per 100 person-years; ARD per 100 person-
years, −0.83 [95% CI, −0.30 to −1.11]; IRR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.21
to 0.79]) as well as long-term exposure (0.4 for dabigatran vs
0.9 for warfarin per 100 person-years]; ARD per 100 person-
years, −0.65 [95% CI, −0.31 to −0.81]; IRR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.10
to 0.66]). The test for subgroup difference indicated no sig-
nificant difference between the associations in short-term and
long-term exposure groups (P value for interaction, .45).
The association with lower risk was statistically signifi-
cant only for patients with a history of falls or fractures (1.6
for dabigatran vs 3.6 for warfarin per 100 person-years; ARD
per 100 person-years, −3.15 [95% CI, −2.40 to −3.45]; IRR, 0.12

come of osteoporotic fractures (1.2 for dabigatran vs 1.6 for

[95% CI, −0.24 to −1.02]; IRR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.85]). Fur-
ther analysis with 5% propensity score trimming to reduce bias
from unmeasured residual confounding also yielded similar
results (0.6 for dabigatran vs 1.0 for warfarin per 100 person-
years; ARD per 100 person-years, −0.63 [95% CI, −0.30 to
−0.81]; IRR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.70]; Table 3). On posthoc
analysis, dabigatran was associated with a lower incidence of
osteoporotic fracture when compared with nontreated pa-
tients (ARD per 100 person-years, −0.62 [95% CI, −0.25 to
−0.87]; IRR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.81]) (eTable 3, eTable 4,
eFigure 2, and eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this population-based study, patients who used dabigatran
had a lower risk of osteoporotic fracture compared with war-
farin users (IRR, 0.38), with an ARD of −0.68 per 100 person-
years. The results suggest that the association with lower risk
applies to both short-term (<1 year) and long-term (≥1 year)
treatment with dabigatran vs warfarin. High-risk patients
with a history of falls, fractures, or both were found to have a
greater ARD (−3.15 per 100 person-years). The results were
robust to all sensitivity analyses, which accounted for pos-
sible falls from height, different sites of osteoporotic fracture,
and effects on unmeasured residual confounding.
Possible Mechanism for Study Findings
Several factors might explain why dabigatran was associated
with a lower risk of osteoporotic fracture compared with
warfarin. First, although mechanism for any deleterious ef-
fectofdabigatranonbonehasnotbeenidentified,24themecha-
nism of action of warfarin may interfere with processes that
contribute to bone formation.1 Warfarin antagonizes vita-
min K–dependent processes including the γ-carboxylation of
osteocalcin and other bone matrix proteins that are required
in bone mineralization.1 Previous studies have demonstrated
an increased level of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in war-
farinusers3anditsassociationwithreducedbonemineralden-
sity and increased fracture risk.25 In contrast, the mechanism
of dabigatran is independent of vitamin K and theoretically
does not interfere with bone metabolism.24 Therefore, it is bio-
logically plausible that dabigatran may be associated with a
lower risk for osteoporotic fracture compared with warfarin.
Patients with a history of falls, fractures, or both might re-
flect weaker baseline bone strength and therefore might be
more susceptible to any further deleterious effect of warfarin
on bone.26 This is in line with the findings that the effect es-
timate in patients with a history of falls, fractures, or both was
stronger than that in patients without such history, and that
both effect estimates went toward a lower risk in dabigatran
users than warfarin users.
Second,patientswhoarewarfarinusersareadvisedtolimit
dietary intake of vitamin K in order to achieve an optimal an-
ticoagulation effect.27 Vitamin K is involved in multiple stages
of bone metabolism and a deficiency of vitamin K has been
linked to an increased risk of bone loss and fracture.28 Because
the use of dabigatran requires no dietary restrictions, and it is
less likely to be associated with osteoporotic fracture due to
vitamin K deficiency. Because the decrease in bone mass is a
gradual process, the observed higher risk of osteoporotic frac-
ture with less than 1-year use of warfarin vs dabigatran war-
rants further investigation. This could mean that there was an
alternative mechanism by which dabigatran reduced the like-
lihoodofosteoporoticfracture.Recently,resultsfromaninvivo
study indicated that dabigatran use was associated with higher
bone volume, reduced trabecular separation, and lower bone
turnover rate compared with warfarin in rats.5 However, no
similar studies have been conducted in humans. On posthoc
sensitivity analysis, dabigatran was associated with a lower in-
cidence of osteoporotic fracture than in nontreated patients.
Such finding may be due to unmeasured residual confound-
ing effects; however, the biological effects of dabigatran on
bone cannot be excluded. Additional epidemiological and
mechanistic studies are warranted to further investigate ef-
fects of dabigatran on bone.
Comparisons With Other Studies
Although the risk of osteoporotic fracture with dabigatran has
not been described in the literature, the possible link be-
tween warfarin use and osteoporotic fracture has been dem-
onstrated previously.2-4 However, some studies reported
no increased risk of osteoporotic fracture associated with
warfarin.29-33 Studies that found no increased risk of fracture
with warfarin involved smaller sample sizes,30,32,33 shorter
treatmentduration,29andself-reporteddata31,32comparedwith
those that found an increased risk.3,4 However, because most
studies compared patients prescribed warfarin against those
receiving no treatment, the underlying characteristics be-
tween comparison groups were likely to be different with re-
spect to stroke risk and comorbidities,27 which are also risk fac-
tors for osteoporotic fracture.34 It is possible that nontreated
patients were healthier and anticoagulation was not indi-
cated, or in contrast, more severe patients in whom antico-
agulation was deemed inappropriate.27 Therefore, residual
confounding was possible, and the results could have been bi-
ased toward either direction. For similar reasons, the previ-
ous observation that patients using warfarin for less than 1 year
was not associated with an increased risk of fracture com-
pared with nontreated patients does not necessarily contra-
dict the findings of the current study. Dabigatran has the same
indication as warfarin.27 Further, the current study used pro-
pensity score matching—excluding patients with a high ten-
dency of receiving dabigatran or warfarin from the compari-

son.Therefore,theresultswerelesslikelythanpreviousstudies
to be confounded by indication.
Clinical Implications
The finding that dabigatran was associated with a lower risk
of osteoporotic fracture compared with warfarin is of particu-
lar clinical relevance given that osteoporotic fracture is a ma-
jor cause of morbidity and mortality in older populations.6
Many risk factors for osteoporotic fracture, such as older age,
history of stroke, and diabetes mellitus are also risk factors for
stroke among NVAF patients requiring anticoagulation.17 Al-
though surgery is usually required to treat a fracture, peri-
operative management of anticoagulation can be challenging
given the need to balance the reduction in thromboembolism
against excessive bleeding. The ARD observed in the overall
cohort was moderate but much more pronounced in patients
with a history of falls, fractures, or both; it has potential clini-
cal significance because the current results suggest that dabi-
gatran might serve as a safer alternative to warfarin for reduc-
ing the risk of osteoporotic fracture in patients with NVAF.
Randomized clinical trials and population-based studies are
warranted because, if this association is confirmed, screen-
ing of patients with NVAF for the risk for osteoporotic frac-
ture could be considered to inform the choice of oral antico-
agulant prescribed in clinical practice.
Strengths and Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study that
determined the risk of osteoporotic fracture with dabigatran
vswarfarininpatientswithNVAF.Thisstudyusedtheterritory-
wide health care database in Hong Kong, which has been rec-
ognized to provide high-quality data for large drug surveil-
lance studies.9-16
This study has several limitations. As inherent in epide-
miological studies, the possibility of unmeasured residual con-
founding effects cannot be excluded. Similar to other health
care databases, information such as bone mineral density and
body mass index are not routinely recorded in CDARS. How-
ever, these factors are not typically considered to differenti-
ate eligible users of dabigatran and warfarin27 and therefore
are unlikely to introduce confounding by indication. Simi-
larly, tobacco and alcohol consumption are not routinely re-
corded in CDARS. However, other important confounding fac-
tors, which may partially account for these risk factors, were
included (eg, COPD and liver disease),35,36 and several sensi-
tivity analyses were conducted, which showed that the re-
sults were consistent. Because the potential risk of osteopo-
roticfracturewithwarfarinusehaslongbeennoted,2-4patients
with concerned risk of osteoporotic fracture might tend to re-
ceive dabigatran over warfarin. This might mask any associa-
tion with lower risk with dabigatran use compared with war-
farin if patient characteristics were not perfectly controlled by
propensity score. However, this did not apply to the findings
of the current study.
Similar to research accessing other health care databases,
the fractures identified in this study could not be classified
into symptomatic or asymptomatic because such informa-
tion is not available in CDARS. Vertebral compression frac-
ture is often asymptomatic and may not be diagnosed, which
might lead to an underestimation of any risk with dabigatran
and warfarin. However, more severe cases would draw clini-
cal attention and be recorded. Although warfarin users may
have had more frequent visits than dabigatran users due to
coagulation testing, it is unusual to perform routine screen-
ing for asymptomatic vertebral fractures.37 The decision to
obtain spine x-rays is generally a response to conditions that
warrant medical attention (eg, chronic lower back pain), and
if such conditions had been presented in patients taking dabi-
gatran, it would generally have been reported during their
routine clinical visits when a fracture would also be detected
if present. Therefore, it is unlikely that the potential underes-
timation would occur differentially for dabigatran and warfa-
rin users, consequently, this would not affect the conclusion
of our results.
Conclusions
Among adults with NVAF receiving anticoagulation, the use
of dabigatran compared with warfarin was associated with a
lower risk of osteoporotic fracture. Additional study, perhaps
including randomized clinical trials, may be warranted to fur-
ther understand the relationship between use of dabigatran
vs warfarin and risk of fracture.
