Objective: This paper estimates specific additional disease outcomes and costs that could be prevented
by helping a patient go from an obesity or overweight category to a normal weight category at different
ages. This information could help physicians, other health care workers, patients, and third-party payers
determine how to prioritize weight reduction.
Methods: A computational Markov model was developed that represented the BMI status, chronic health
states, health outcomes, and associated costs (from various perspectives) for an adult at different age
points throughout his or her lifetime.
Results: Incremental costs were calculated for adult patients with obesity or overweight (vs. normal
weight) at different starting ages. For example, for a metabolically healthy 20-year-old, having obesity (vs.
normal weight) added lifetime third-party payer costs averaging $14,059 (95% range: $13,956-$14,163),
productivity losses of $14,141 ($13,969-$14,312), and total societal costs of $28,020 ($27,751-$28,289);
having overweight vs. normal weight added $5,055 ($4,967-$5,144), $5,358 ($5,199-$5,518), and $10,365
($10,140-$10,590). For a metabolically healthy 50-year-old, having obesity added $15,925 ($15,831-
$16,020), $20,120 ($19,887-$20,352), and $36,278 ($35,977-$36,579); having overweight added $5,866
($5,779-$5,953), $10,205 ($9,980-$10,429), and $16,169 ($15,899-$16,438).
Conclusions: Incremental lifetime costs of a patient with obesity or overweight (vs. normal weight)
increased with the patient’s age, peaked at age 50, and decreased with older ages. However, weight
reduction even in older adults still yielded incremental cost savings.

Introduction
Although studies have shown that patients with obesity or over-
weight have a higher risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, car-
diovascular disease, and cancer, the following question remains:
what specific additional disease outcomes and costs accompany
individuals with obesity or overweight at different ages? Con-
versely, what outcomes and costs could be averted by weight
reduction in adults? Given the high and growing prevalence of obe-
sity and overweight (1) (66% of the United States adult population
(2)), knowing the answers to these questions can help guide both
medical decision-making and policy-making, including deciding
how many resources to allocate to obesity prevention/control com-
pared to other competing priorities. Therefore, we developed a
computational model that simulated the progression of an adult’s
weight, disease outcomes, and associated costs throughout his or
her lifetime.
Methods
Model structure
By using TreeAge Pro 2016 (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown,
Massachusetts), we developed an individual-based Markov model
that represented the BMI status, health outcomes, and associated
costs (from various perspectives) at different age points throughout
an adult’s lifetime. The model includes 15 mutually exclusive dis-
crete health states (Figure 1) that represent every combination of
three BMI categories (normal weight [18.5 � BMI < 25], overweight
[25 � BMI < 30], and obesity [BMI � 30]) and five chronic health

 stages (CHS). The CHS represent an integration of the Edmonton
Obesity Staging System (3) and the Cardiometabolic Disease Staging
System (4), taking into account six clinical parameters related to the
health risk profile of individuals to derive a risk-stratification system.
Table 1 describes the five developed CHS (stage 0 to stage 4).
An adult (� 18 years old) can enter the model with his or her initial
health condition represented by 1 of the 15 health states; e.g., an
overweight 40-year-old in CHS3. At each model cycle, individuals
age 1 year and continue to cycle through the model until death. At
the end of each cycle, an individual may stay in the same health
state, transition to another, or die (Figure 1). Death is an absorptive
state; i.e., once an individual moves into this state, he or she leaves
the model. All transition probabilities are age and state specific.
While in a given health state, an individual can develop four types
of common obesity-related health outcomes: stroke, cancer, coronary
heart disease (CHD), or type 2 diabetes complications (nephropathy,
retinopathy, and neuropathy). The chances of developing these
health outcomes depend on an individual’s age and health state.
Given the health conditions associated with each CHS (e.g., meta-
bolically healthy in stage 0, diabetes in stage 4), individuals in
stages 0 and 1 could develop only stroke and cancer; individuals in
stage 2 could develop only stroke, cancer, and CHD; and individuals
in stages 3 and 4 could develop all possible health outcomes. Indi-
viduals with obesity and overweight have higher probabilities of
developing each health outcome, and these are modeled as multi-
pliers to the baseline normal weight probabilities (Supporting Infor-
mation Table S2).
Each cycle (i.e., year), individuals accrue associated costs and health
effects, measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), based on
their health state and the health outcomes they’ve developed (e.g.,
stroke). Costs were accrued for different relevant perspectives. The
third-party payer perspective considered only the direct medical
costs (e.g., outpatient, hospitalization, emergency room visits, medi-
cations), whereas the societal perspective included direct and indi-
rect costs (i.e., productivity losses). Annual wages attenuated by util-
ity weights for an individual’s health condition served as a proxy
for productivity losses. Utility weights represented a person’s prefer-
ence for his or her own health on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (per-
fect health) (5). The developed health outcomes resulted in a
decrease in the health utility value. Annual QALYs were derived
from age-specific health utility, attenuated by the utility weights
associated with each health condition and outcome and their dura-
tion. If an individual suffered more than one health outcome (e.g.,
stroke and CHD), the outcome with the highest costs and lowest
health effect superseded others. For example, an individual who
developed stroke and CHD would incur the costs associated with
CHD and the QALYs associated with stroke. The costs and QALYs
that an individual accrued in each cycle of his or her lifetime were
totaled when individual transitioned to the death state.

 participants’ age range in these two prospective cohort studies, data
from CARDIA and ARIC were used for calculating transition proba-
bilities for adults � 45 years and > 45 years, respectively. The proba-
bilities of cardiac events and stroke for each stage and the associated
risk adjustments by BMI categories came from the Framingham
Heart Study (FRS) (8). Probabilities of stroke and CHD recurrence
came from FRS and the Northern Manhattan Stroke cohort study
(9). Age-specific probabilities of developing obesity-related cancers
for females (breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, esoph-
ageal cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, and
uterine cancer) and for males (colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer,
kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach can-
cer) were extracted from the National Cancer Institute database (10)
and the National Health Interview Survey (11). Time-dependent
probabilities of developing diabetes complications (i.e., nephropathy,
retinopathy, and neuropathy) came from the Pittsburgh Epidemiol-
ogy of Diabetes Complications Study (12). Mortality data for each
disease came from the following sources: FRS for cardiac-associated
mortality (13) and for stroke (14), the National Institute of Cancer
and National Health Interview Survey (11) for cancer, and the US
Renal Data System (15) for end-stage renal disease. Age-related all-
cause mortality rates were derived from the Human Mortality Data-
base (16).
We used nationally representative data sources (such as Medicare
claims data linked to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results
program
(17), the
Medical
Expenditure Panel
Survey
[MEPS] (18), and published literature (19,20)) to estimate the third-
party payer costs for various health stages and health outcomes.
MEPS mainly contains data of medical encounters and claims of
families and individuals, their medical providers, and employers
across the United States. It represents both public and private insur-
ance coverage on health services used. By using MEPS, we derived
estimates for inpatient visits, outpatient visits, hospitalization, emer-
gency room visits, and medications for each BMI category and
health outcome. These were modeled as distributions. We supple-
mented these databases with cost data from published literature. A
3% annual discount rate converted all past and future costs to 2016
US dollars. Utility weights for different health stages and health out-
comes came from published literature. Wage data came from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (21). Supporting Information Tables S1-
S4 contain model parameter values and sources.
Simulation scenarios and sensitivity analyses
Each simulation experiment consisted of sending 1,000 individuals
through the model 1,000 times (1,000,000 total trials). Each individ-
ual entering the model was given a specific age and BMI group
(e.g., 20-year-old with normal weight). Different simulation experi-
ments varied the individual’s starting age and BMI group. All indi-
viduals, irrespective of their BMI group, started the simulation in a
healthy condition (i.e., stage 0), and their health states evolved over
the years depicted in the simulation on the basis of transition proba-
bilities. We reported results by the age and health state of individu-
als entering the model, regardless of how they transitioned through
the health states. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis consisted of simul-
taneously varying each parameter throughout its distribution. Addi-
tional sensitivity analyses explored the effect of varying key param-
eters, such as the transition probabilities, by a relative 650% (i.e.,
by increasing or decreasing each of the probabilities to 1.5 or 0.5 of
its current value without letting it go below 0 or above 1). All statis-
tics and results reported in the paper were generated by TreeAge
Pro.
Results
Third-party payer perspective
(direct medical costs)
Table 2 shows the incremental net present value of the lifetime
third-party payer costs for patients with obesity and overweight ver-
sus normal weight, as well as those for patients with obesity versus
overweight for different initial patient ages. The incremental third-
party payer costs increased across age with a peak at age 50. More-
over, our results show that the benefits of weight reduction extended
beyond age 80.

 normal weight, as well as those for patients with obesity versus
overweight at different initial ages. The incremental yearly third-
party payer costs for patients with obesity and overweight (vs. nor-
mal weight) increased across ages, with patients with obesity show-
ing larger values. For 20-year-old patients with obesity versus nor-
mal weight, simulation runs of our model determined that about
64% of their incremental yearly third-party payer costs could be
averted by their moving from the obesity to the overweight category
(Table 3). For 30-year-old patients, 61% could be averted; for 40-
year-old patients, 57% could be averted; for 50-year-old patients,
51% could be averted; for 60-year-old patients, 40% could be
averted; for 70-year-old patients, 26% could be averted; and for 80-
year-old patients, 21% could be averted. This implies that, after age
50, the largest cost savings for an individual with obesity is obtained
not by moving to the overweight category but by moving to the nor-
mal weight category. Comparing patients with obesity versus
overweight, incremental average third-party payer costs incurred per
year increased, with a peak at age 50, implying that these costs per
year get closer as patients age. This emphasizes the importance of
weight loss as people get older for both individuals with obesity and
individuals with overweight.
In our sensitivity analyses, the state transition probabilities were the
largest driver of third-party payer costs. Varying BMI transition
probabilities affected incremental third-party payer costs the most
for those entering the model at age 20 (220% to 25% for individu-
als with obesity vs. normal weight, 224% to 36% for obesity vs.
overweight, and 213% to 4% for overweight vs. normal weight).
These effects decreased with an increasing individual starting age
(e.g., for those entering at age 50, the changes were 29% to 11%,
214% to 14%, and 22% to 6%, respectively). Varying the chronic
health state transition probabilities by 650% had a larger effect

 (e.g., for those starting at age 20, 250% to 52%, 256% to 60%,
and 239% to 41%, respectively, and for those starting at age 50,
227% to 22%, 235% to 29%, and 212% to 12%, respectively).
Productivity losses (indirect costs)
Table 2 also shows the indirect costs and an age-related trend simi-
lar to that shown in third-party payer costs. For 20-year-old patients
with obesity versus normal weight, simulation runs of our model
determined that about 62% of their incremental lifetime indirect
costs could be averted by their moving from the obesity to the over-
weight category (Table 2). For 30-year-old patients, 57% could be
averted; for 40-year-old patients, 53% could be averted; for 50-year-
old patients, 49% could be averted; for 60-year-old patients, 41%
could be averted; for 70-year-old patients, 36% could be averted;
and for 80-year-old patients, 30% could be averted. After age 50,
the significant reduction in incremental indirect costs happened if
patients made the additional shift from the overweight to the normal
weight category as well. Comparing patients with obesity and over-
weight versus normal weight, the incremental indirect costs across
all ages were larger than the incremental third-party payer costs; the
magnitude of the difference was larger for patients ages 50 to 80,
reflecting the importance of costs incurred in the form of productiv-
ity losses caused by having obesity or overweight after age 50. The
incremental productivity losses of patients of all ages with obesity
versus overweight increased across ages, with a peak at age 50.
Table 3 shows the incremental average indirect costs incurred per
year for patients with obesity and overweight versus normal weight
and for patients with obesity versus overweight. For patients with
obesity and overweight versus normal weight, the incremental aver-
age indirect costs per year increased as people aged, with a slight
drop at age 80. Simulation runs of our model also showed that as
individuals with obesity aged, reducing BMI and moving to the
overweight category did not have a significant effect on averting
productivity losses; instead, they needed to transition to the normal
weight category. Sensitivity analyses showed similar trends in pro-
ductivity losses as in third-party payer costs.
Societal perspective (third-party payer costs plus
productivity losses)
Table 2 also reports the lifetime societal cost results, again showing
an age-related trend similar to that shown in third-party payer costs.
For patients with obesity versus normal weight, incremental lifetime
societal costs increased with age, with a peak at age 50. Moreover,
incremental productivity losses made up approximately 60% of the
incremental total societal costs for ages 50 to 80. Simulation runs of
our model determined that for 20-year-old patients with obesity

 versus normal weight, about 63% of their incremental lifetime soci-
etal costs could be averted by moving from the obesity to over-
weight category. For 30-year-old patients, 60% could be averted; for
40-year-old patients, 58% could be averted; for 50-year-old patients,
55% could be averted; for 60-year-old patients, 46% could be
averted; for 70-year-old patients, 41% could be averted; and for 80-
year-old patients, 37% could be averted. This again emphasizes the
fact that weight reduction and a transition to the overweight cate-
gory will not significantly reduce societal costs for older patients
with obesity. Instead, additional efforts are need for transition to the
normal weight category.
Table 3 shows the incremental societal costs incurred per year for
patients with obesity and overweight versus normal weight, as well
as patients with obesity versus overweight. Like incremental produc-
tivity losses,
the
incremental average
societal
costs per year
increased for patients with obesity and overweight (vs. normal
weight) across age with a slight drop at age 80. The difference
between the average societal costs per year for patients with obesity
and overweight decreased
as people age.
Sensitivity
analyses
showed trends with yearly societal costs similar to those seen in pro-
ductivity losses and third-party payer costs.
QALYs
Table 2 also shows how the incremental QALYs displayed an age-
related change similar to that seen in costs. More than 60% of the
incremental QALYs for patients with obesity could be gained by
BMI reduction and moving to the overweight category. For example,
a 70-year-old patient with obesity (vs. normal weight) would gain
about 70% of his or her incremental QALYs by moving to the over-
weight category. Sensitivity analyses showed that varying the BMI
transition probabilities by 650% affected incremental QALYs by no
more than 225% to 34% for patients with obesity versus normal
weight, 228% to 49% for patients with obesity versus overweight,
and 217% to 14% for patients with overweight versus normal
weight, starting the model at age 20. Effects decreased with an
increasing starting age (e.g., for those at age 50, the changes were
27% to 8%, 211% to 15%, and 21% to 6%, respectively). Varying
the chronic health state transition probabilities affected incremental
QALYs by no more than 222% to 22% for patients with obesity
versus normal weight, 226% to 26% for patients with obesity ver-
sus overweight, and 214% to 20% for patients with overweight ver-
sus normal weight, starting the model at age 20, again decreasing
effects with increasing starting age (e.g., for those at age 50, the
changes were 28% to 6%, 210% to 9%, and 24% to 21%,
respectively).
Discussion
Our results show the incremental health effects and costs for an
individual going from normal weight to overweight to obesity, thus
demonstrating the value of weight reduction at different ages.
Although numerous studies have shown that patients with obesity or
overweight have higher risk of various health outcomes, such as
type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer
(22-24), various decision-makers could benefit from a better under-
standing of the specific health effects and costs associated with
increased or decreased BMI for a patient. For example, policy-
makers and public health officials can use these results to develop
more relevant interventions in terms of targeting specific subpopula-
tions (defined by their health condition, BMI status, and age). Fun-
ders can use the reported results to decide how many resources to
dedicate to helping individuals lose weight. Understanding the
resulting lifetime costs and health effects for an individual with obe-
sity at different ages can also aid physicians and health care profes-
sionals in more targeted individual-based preventive management
decisions. The cost and health outcomes can be used for informing
patients of potential future health risks and impending medical costs,
given their existing BMI status and health condition. Although most
of the studies in the literature have adopted a population perspective
to estimate the costs and health effects of obesity over particular
time periods (25-30), our study is unique because we (1) focus on
specific patients of different BMI categories at different ages and
estimate their additional lifetime cost and health effects/outcomes in
comparison with normal weight individuals; (2) provide greater
granularity by defining 15 health states that take into account not
only the BMI group of individuals but also the immediate health
complications associated with body weight (i.e., prehypertension,
hypertension, prehyperlipidemia, hyperlipidemia, prediabetes, and
diabetes), whereas existing studies mainly have considered three
states based only on BMI; and (3) include all major health outcomes
linked to obesity (i.e., CHD, stroke, different types of cancer, and
diabetes complications) in calculating the incremental health effects
and costs.
Our study shows that incremental lifetime third-party payer costs,
productivity losses, and total societal costs for patients with obesity
or overweight versus normal weight increase as people age (peaking
at age 50). This may be because the chances of most of the health
complications increase after age 50. It should also be noted that the
transition probabilities before age 45 are from CARDIA and that
those after age 45 are from ARIC. We also show that incremental
productivity losses of patients with obesity or overweight (vs. nor-
mal weight) age 50 and older make up more than 60% of their
incremental societal costs. This number for 20- to 40-year-old
patients with obesity and overweight is about 55%. Escalating pro-
ductivity losses lead to weakening on several key parts of society,
such as the business sector (31). By realizing the effects of obesity
on the productivity of their employees and consequently their prof-
its, employers may look to redesign or sponsor healthy lifestyle pro-
grams with weight loss initiatives (31). Additionally, incremental
costs incurred per year for patients with obesity versus overweight
decrease after age 50, implying that older adults with both obesity
and overweight need to lose weight to avert the health effects and
costs associated with weight gain.
Because we endeavored to be conservative, our findings may under-
estimate the burden of the progression of individuals through various
health states. For example, we only accounted for productivity losses
from reduced productivity, not from absenteeism or premature death.
Our model did not account for the possible burden on family mem-
bers, friends, and coworkers. Moreover, we only considered four
major health outcomes associated with obesity, rather than encom-
passing every possible outcome. For scenarios in which an individ-
ual has developed more than one health outcome, we considered the
costs and health effects for only one health outcome. Except for in
cases of cancer, we did not consider the costs associated with mor-
tality. Therefore, we were conservative in our estimates of costs and
QALYs. Finally, our results show the possible reduction in third-
party payer costs and productivity losses if individuals lose weight.

 Although we did not explicitly account for the potential costs of los-
ing weight (e.g., the cost of adopting weight management programs,
gym memberships, bariatric surgery), our estimates show how much
can be invested into losing weight and still return net cost savings.
All models are simplifications of reality and cannot represent every
event or outcome (32,33). We have made the simplifying assump-
tion that obesity-associated outcomes (i.e., stroke, CHD, cancers,
and diabetes complications) do not impact the overall chances of
transition to various health states. Evaluating the chance of BMI
change due to these health complications is difficult, if not impossi-
ble, given the available data sets. Moreover, the use of BMI as an
anthropometric assessment of weight has been shown to introduce
bias from misclassification when looking at obesity effects on health
outcomes (34). Muscular individuals or those who have little muscle
definition may not receive an accurate BMI, which can lead to over-
estimation or underestimation of the costs/health effects associated
with obesity and overweight. Our decision to use BMI was driven
by the ubiquitous availability of BMI information in data sources
and the ease of communication with stakeholders. Finally, our model
inputs draw from various data sources and databases. Although we
tried to identify those relevant to each of the inputs, these different
databases and sources draw from different populations and, there-
fore, from different circumstances. For example, cost estimates from
MEPS may underestimate medical costs due to overall underreport-
ing of events by households. Extensive sensitivity analyses varied
the value of different parameters to evaluate the robustness of these
inputs and to account for potential variability.
Conclusion
Our results show the incremental health effects and costs of going
from normal weight to overweight to obesity, thus demonstrating the
value of BMI reduction at different ages and how this changes with
increasing patient age; these results could help with decision-making
in obesity prevention and control.O
