OBJECTIVES: To determine if longitudinal associations exist between parental incarceration 
(PI) and health care use or health behaviors among a national sample of young adults. 
METHODS: We used the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health to examine 
associations between history of mother incarceration (MI) and father incarceration (FI), 
health care use, and 3 dimensions of health behaviors (eg, general health behaviors, 
substance use, and other risky behaviors) (N = 13 084). Multivariable logistic regression 
models accounted for individual, family, and geographic factors and generated adjusted 
odds ratios (aORs).
RESULTS: Over 10% of the sample had a history of PI before the age of 18. History of MI and 
FI were both associated with forgone health care (aOR = 1.65 [95% confidence interval 
(CI), 1.20–2.27], aOR = 1.22 [95% CI, 1.02–1.47], respectively), prescription drug abuse (MI 
aOR = 1.61 [95% CI, 1.02–2.55], FI aOR = 1.46 [95% CI, 1.20–1.79]), and 10 or more lifetime 
sexual partners (MI aOR = 1.55 [95% CI, 1.08–2.22], FI aOR = 1.19 [95% CI, 1.01–1.41]). 
MI was associated with higher likelihood of emergency department use (aOR = 2.36 [95% 
CI, 1.51–3.68]), and FI was associated with illicit injection drug use (aOR = 2.54 [95% CI, 
1.27–5.12]).
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of incarceration extend beyond incarcerated individuals. PI histories 
are associated with lower health care use and unhealthy behaviors in young adulthood. By 
addressing barriers to health care and health-harming behaviors, health care providers and 
policy makers may reduce health disparities among this population.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: A history of 
parental incarceration (PI) is associated with poor 
physical and mental health outcomes into adulthood. 
However, the relationship between PI and health 
care use and multidimensional health behaviors has 
been understudied.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Young adults with PI 
histories are less likely to use health care and more 
likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors compared 
with peers without PI.

 The United States has the highest 
incarceration rate in the world, and 
nearly 60% of incarcerated adults 
are parents to minor children.1 
– 
3 At 
least 5 million children in the United 
States have had a parent who lived 
with them go to jail or prison.1 Black, 
low-income, and rural children 
experience disproportionately high 
rates of parental incarceration 
(PI).2, 
 
4 Most children experience 
the incarceration of a father; 
however, maternal incarceration is 
increasingly more common because 
of rising incarceration rates among 
women.2 Mothers tend to have 
slightly more children than fathers 
at the time of incarceration.2, 
 
5, 
6 
Although incarceration may have a 
marked impact on an incarcerated 
individual’s life, it also disrupts the 
family unit and thereby negatively 
affects his or her children.7
PI has been identified as 1 of several 
adverse childhood experiences 
(ACEs), a group of traumatic or 
persistent childhood experiences 
associated with poor physical 
and mental health across the life 
course.8 
– 
11 PI is associated with 
learning delays and behavioral 
problems, 
12 
– 
15 perhaps because of 
the traumatic separation from a 
parent, the loss of parental resources, 
and the lack of social support.7, 
12  
The authors of a growing body 
of literature indicate that PI is 
detrimental to health in childhood 
and adulthood. The prevalence of 
asthma, HIV and AIDS, depression, 
anxiety, and posttraumatic stress 
disorder is higher among individuals 
with a history of PI.16, 
 
17
In contrast to what is known about 
the health of individuals who 
experience PI, little is known about 
their health care use and health 
behaviors in young adulthood, 
which are strong determinants of 
health.18 The impact of PI on health-
related behavior is important to 
examine because understanding 
these relationships can inform 
interventions to improve the health 
of individuals with a history of PI.
We used a large, nationally 
representative sample of young 
adults to evaluate the relationship 
between PI before the age of 18 and 
health care use and health behaviors. 
We hypothesized a priori that PI 
would be associated with lower 
levels of health care use and a higher 
prevalence of unhealthy behaviors 
compared with individuals without 
PI.19,

METHODS
Data
We used data from the National 
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
Health to Adult Health (Add Health), 
a nationally representative cohort 
study following adolescents into 
adulthood in the United States. Add 
Health is a multisurvey, multiwave 
study in which systematic sampling 
methods with implicit stratification 
are used. High schools serve as 
the primary sampling unit for the 
clustered design. The sample design 
ensures adequate representation 
by region, urbanicity, school size, 
school type, and ethnicity.21 During 
wave 1 (1994–1995 school year), 
18 924 adolescents (12–19 years 
old) completed in-home interviews, 
were assigned a sample weight, and 
were invited to continue in follow-up 
waves. In wave 4 (2008), 13 861 
respondents (24–32 years old) who 
were in wave 1 completed follow-up 
surveys and were assigned a sample 
weight. Written informed consent 
was obtained from the participants. 
Additional information on the 
sampling procedures and study 
design is documented elsewhere.21
Study Population
Among eligible participants with 
wave 1 and wave 4 sample weights, 
13 084 (94.4%) had complete data 
and were included in our analytic 
sample. Sociodemographic data were 
drawn from wave 1 and combined 
with wave 4 self-reported health care 
use, health behaviors, and PI history.
Measures
PI
In wave 4, respondents were asked 
if their biological mother or father 
ever spent time in jail or prison. 
Respondents were also asked their 
age at the first and most recent time 
their biological mother or father 
went to jail or prison. We included 
individuals who reported any history 
of mother incarceration (MI) or 
father incarceration (FI) after birth 
and before the age of 18.
Health Care Use
Data on health care use were 
collected in wave 4. Respondents 
were asked about forgone care, 
worsening health problems because 
of lack of health care, the timing of 
annual dental examinations, the 
receipt of mental health counseling, 
the timing of physical examinations, 
and the usual source of care 
(Table 1). Time since last physical 
examination was categorized into 
2 categories: <1 year and >1 year 
or never. Location of care was 
categorized as a primary care setting 
(ie, hospital-based clinic; community 
health clinic; health maintenance 
organization; private medical 
office; school, college, or work 
clinic; military hospital or clinic; or 
respondent “never gets sick”) and 
emergency department (ED) or non–
primary care site.
Health Behaviors
In wave 4, respondents were asked 
questions regarding their general 
health behaviors, substance use, and 
other high-risk behaviors (Table 1).  
Respondents were asked about 
television screen time, fast food and 
sugary drink consumption, frequency 
of physical fitness center use, and 
sunblock use. We defined excessive 
screen time as >50 hours per week 
(3.5 times higher than the national 
average for ages 25–34 and 1.5 times

Substance use behaviors included 
cigarette smoking, prescription drug 
abuse, illicit intravenous (IV) drug 
use, and alcohol use. Respondents 
were determined to have problem 
drinking or problem drug use if their 
substance use–related behavior 
endangered the respondent or 
others, caused legal problems, 
caused problems with family and 
friends, or interfered with school or 
work. Questions about other risky 
behaviors included the number 
of lifetime sexual partners (≤9 vs 
≥10 lifetime partners), 
25, 
 
26 sex in 
exchange for money in the past 12 
months, and any gambling problems.
Covariates
We controlled for wave 1 
sociodemographic factors associated 
with health care use and health 
behaviors in our analysis, including 
(1) individual factors, such as sex, 
race and/or ethnicity, and age; (2) 
family characteristics, such as family 
structure (2 parents, 1 parent, or no 
biological parents in the household), 
parental education (no resident 
parent, less than high school, high 
school, and college or higher), and 
receipt of public assistance; and (3) 
geography, such as the geographical 
classification of the respondent’s 
residence (urban, suburban, rural,  
or other).16,

Statistical Analysis
We summarized sociodemographic 
characteristics of our study 
population by PI history. We created 
3 categorical variables for no PI

 history, MI history, and FI history. 
We also used descriptive statistics 
to describe the prevalence of PI and 
the mean age at first episode of PI in 
our sample. We used unadjusted and 
adjusted logistic regression models 
to examine associations between 
PI and our outcome variables. 
We modeled PI as 2 independent 
variables indicating history of MI or 
history of FI. This approach allowed 
us to isolate the impact of MI and 
FI for individuals who experienced 
incarceration of 1 or both parents. 
In unadjusted analyses, only MI and 
FI were included in the model. In 
adjusted analyses, we controlled for 
all previously described covariates. 
In all analyses, we conducted them 
using Stata 14.0 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX); accounted for the 
clustered, stratified survey design; 
and used survey weights to generate 
national population estimates 
unless otherwise noted.28 This study 
was approved by the University of 
Michigan Medical School Institutional 
Review Board.
RESULTS
 
Table 2 illustrates the weighted 
sociodemographic characteristics 
of our sample by history of PI. 
Of the 13 084 individuals in the 
analysis sample, 10.7% experienced 
any PI (2.1% experienced MI and 
9.4% experienced FI before 18 
years of age). Non-Hispanic Black 
individuals had a disproportionally 
high prevalence of PI, accounting for 
34.3% of individuals reporting MI 
and 23.0% of individuals reporting 
FI, while representing only 14.8% of 
our sample (data not shown). A large 
proportion of individuals with PI 
were from 1-parent households and 
urban areas.
For individuals with PI histories, the 
mean age at first PI episode was 10.7 
years (8.8–12.6) for those with MI 
and 10.8 years (9.2–12.3) for those 
with FI (data not shown).
Unadjusted Analyses
In Table 3, we display the unadjusted 
odds ratios (ORs) of health care use 
patterns and health behaviors among 
individuals with a history of MI or FI 
compared with individuals without 
a history of PI. Young adults with MI 
and FI had significantly higher odds 
of forgone health care. Individuals 
with FI only had higher odds of 
having a health problem worsen 
because of lack of care. Dental 
health care use was significantly less 
common among individuals with an 
MI or FI history. Individuals with

 FI had significantly higher odds of 
having had counseling within the 
past year. Although neither MI nor FI 
was associated with delayed annual 
physical examinations, young adults 
with a history of PI were significantly 
more likely to report using the ED or 
a non–primary care site as their usual 
source of care.
Individuals with PI were more likely 
to engage in several unhealthy 
behaviors. Any history of MI or FI 
was associated with drinking sugary 
drinks, smoking cigarettes, and 
having 10 or more lifetime sexual 
partners. Whereas MI history was 
positively associated with high-
risk behaviors, including having 
sex in exchange for money, FI was 
associated with obesogenic behaviors 
(ie, related to fast food consumption 
and sedentary behaviors), lower 
sunblock use, and higher substance 
use (ie, prescription drug abuse, illicit 
IV drug use, and problem drug use). 
Neither MI nor FI was associated 
with gambling problems.
Multivariable Analyses
Multivariable results of the 
association between MI or FI and 
health care use and health behavior 
outcomes are presented in Table 4.
In adjusted analyses, MI and FI 
remained significantly associated 
with forgone health care. FI history 
remained statistically significantly 
associated with worsening health 
problems because of lack of health 
care. Individuals with MI were 
significantly less likely to receive 
annual dental examinations 
compared with peers; however, this 
association was no longer significant 
for individuals with FI. Adjusted 
odds of having recent psychological 
counseling were significantly higher 
for young adults with FI compared 
with those without FI. The ED as 
a usual source of care remained 
significant for individuals with MI 
only.
Individuals with FI were significantly 
more likely to watch 50 hours or 
more of television per week, consume 
sugary drinks, and less likely to use 
sunblock than individuals without 
FI. MI history was not significantly 
associated with these general health 
behaviors in adjusted analyses.
Young adults with MI or FI history 
had significantly higher adjusted 
odds of smoking cigarettes, drinking 
problems, and prescription drug 
abuse compared with peers without 
a PI history. For individuals with FI, 
adjusted odds of using illicit IV drug 
use and problem drug use were also 
significantly higher.
MI and FI were associated with 
significantly higher odds of having 
≥10 sexual partners. MI remained 
significantly associated with having 
sex in exchange for money in 
adjusted analyses.
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative 
study of young adults, we found 
a consistent association between 
the incarceration of a mother or 
father and suboptimal health care 
use and unhealthy behaviors. Our 
findings suggest a history of MI or 
FI is independently associated with 
activities detrimental to health, 
including higher levels of ED use, 
obesogenic behaviors, substance 
use, and other high-risk behaviors. 
Adverse health care use patterns and 
more health-harming behaviors may 
ultimately contribute to poor health 
outcomes throughout the life course 
for young adults with a history of PI.
Authors of previous studies have 
demonstrated that children with PI 
histories and young adults with a 
history of MI, exclusively, experience 
barriers to health care.29,

Downloaded from 
 findings related to the association 
of PI with forgone care and FI with 
worsening health problems because 
of no health care suggest there is 
underutilization of needed health 
care. The higher use of mental 
health counseling among individuals 
with a history of FI likely reflects a 
greater mental health burden in this 
population but does not necessarily 
indicate adequate mental health 
treatment.16, 
 
31 Additionally, young 
adults with MI are more likely to 
use the ED as their usual source of 
health care. These young adults may 
seek care after their health problems 
have worsened, propagating existing 
health disparities experienced by 
individuals with exposure to MI.16 
Higher frequencies of ED use is 
not unexpected given the multiple 
health conditions that ACE-exposed 
populations experience in addition 
to the numerous social and economic 
barriers to primary care and may 
experience unmet health care 
needs.14, 
 
29, 
 
30
Although we examined young adults 
in this study, drivers of health 
care being underused may begin 
in childhood for individuals with 
PI. PI often leads to disruptions in 
the family unit, including possible 
transitions in the adults who serve as 
the primary caregiver, as well as the 
child’s residence.7 Such disruptions 
may make it more difficult for 
caregivers to take children to the 
doctor or dentist for preventive 
health care, which may normalize 
forgoing medical care. Additionally, 
parents and children who have 
experienced a history of negative 
interaction with institutions, such as 
the criminal justice and child welfare 
systems, may be less likely to interact 
with other systems, such as the 
health care system, because of fear 
of surveillance and formal record-
keeping.32 Caregivers are also more 
likely to be financially stressed and 
may have access to fewer resources 
that allow them to model good health 
behavior for children. Additionally, PI 
has been associated with a truncated 
transition from adolescence to 
adulthood, 
33 which may result in the 
failure to acquire knowledge of how 
to access or use preventive health 
care. Together, these behaviors may 
be mirrored in the future as the child 
ages and begins to independently 
engage with the health care system.
Individuals with PI histories also 
reported more unhealthy behaviors 
compared with their peers without 
PI. For example, we found that 
young adults with a history of FI, 
but not MI, were more likely to 
engage in obesogenic behaviors, such 
as excessive television watching. 
Researchers of previous work have 
shown that children with PI histories 
are more likely to eat unhealthy 
foods, such as fast food and salty, 
starchy, and sweet snacks, suggesting 
the health behaviors we observed 
among young adults may also have 
their origins in childhood.34 We 
found that a history of MI or FI was 
associated with significantly higher 
rates of smoking, problem drinking, 
prescription drug abuse, and ≥10 
lifetime sexual partners than peers 
without a history of PI. The results 
presented in previous studies have 
been mixed regarding substance use 
among children and youth with PI 
histories.14, 
 
35 However, researchers 
of previous studies used small sample 
sizes, whereas we employed a large, 
nationally representative data set in 
our study.36 Our results aligned with 
studies in which population-based 
samples were also used.35, 
 
37 Other 
high-risk behaviors varied by MI or 
FI history. Individuals with a history 
of MI had twice the odds of having 
sex in exchange for money, whereas 
a history of FI was associated with

These findings add to the broader 
ACE literature by explicating the 
differential association between MI 
or FI and health behaviors.
The differential impact of 
incarceration by parent has been 
described in the literature, with a 
specific focus on the influence of 
maternal incarceration.6, 
 
30, 
 
38 The 
evidence regarding the effect of MI 
on child outcomes is mixed, but some 
scholars have suggested FI may have 
a greater influence on children’s 
long-term outcomes.6, 
38, 
 
39 For 
example, Miller and Barnes39 found 
that FI exclusively was associated 
with physical (ie, asthma, bronchitis, 
emphysema, and physical injury) 
and mental health (ie, depression 
and anxiety) conditions. In our study, 
we found that FI was more strongly 
associated with general health 
behaviors and drug use than MI. The 
mechanisms for these differential 
relationships are unclear. The impact 
of FI may be related to a father’s role 
as the primary wage-earner in the 
household and the loss of income and 
economic strain after incarceration. 
This strain may place children at risk 
for living in lower socioeconomic 
families and neighborhoods.40 In 
addition, financial challenges during 
and after FI may impede a family’s 
ability to afford health care, healthy 
food options, and activities that 
promote physical fitness. Fewer 
opportunities for healthy experiences 
may increase screen time and 
other unhealthy behaviors.34 These 
findings reveal that interventions 
aimed at improving the health among 
this population may need to be 
tailored according to which parent 
was incarcerated.
Although this study has many 
strengths, the results of this study 
must be interpreted in the context 
of specific limitations. Several of the 
findings were significantly associated 
with FI but not MI. Although this 
aligns with previous research and 
could be interpreted as FI being 
a stronger driver for many health 
behaviors compared with those with 
MI, 
6, 
 
38 the sample of individuals 
reporting MI was small and may have 
lacked the power to detect significant 
associations. Additionally, we did 
not report the primary caregiver 
before PI, the type of offenses leading 
to PI, or measure the length of each 
episode of PI in our study because 
these data were not collected in Add 
Health. Moreover, incarceration can 
be a sensitive subject and a source of 
stigma or shame, 
41, 
 
42 and respondents 
could have underreported their PI 
history, which may have led to more 
conservative estimates.
CONCLUSIONS
A history of PI is associated with 
health care use patterns and 
health behaviors into adulthood. 
Barriers to health care and health-
harming behaviors may contribute 
to overall poorer health for this 
population. Research that focuses 
both on the identification of specific 
barriers to health care, targeting 
this population’s under-utilization 
of care, and the development of 
unhealthy behaviors for PI-exposed 
individuals is needed. Also, 
determining if existing interventions 
that increase preventive health 
care use and improve unhealthy 
behaviors for children exposed to PI 
should be prioritized. For example, 
partnerships between government 
organizations, community 
organizations, and health care 
organizations that provide services to 
children with PI could communicate 
about children that need to establish 
care within a medical home and 
help them gain access to care. Also, 
pediatric providers could consider 
ACE screening as an initial approach 
to identifying patients who may 
benefit from further assessment 
and health behavior counseling. 
Additionally, group medical visits 
for children impacted by PI may be 
another strategy to improve health 
behaviors and decrease ED visits.43 
At those group visits, providers 
can discuss healthy behaviors 
and link children with effective 
interventions to encourage healthy 
behaviors. These group visits could 
foster a patient-provider trust, a 
sense of community, and support 
among individuals experiencing 
PI.44 Finally, policy makers should 
support policies that (1) reduce 
incarceration rates by addressing 
aggressive incarceration policies 
that lead to mass incarceration, 
disproportionately affecting 
minority and poor individuals, 
and (2) maintain a child’s contact 
with an incarcerated parent, when 
appropriate. Addressing PI is critical 
because the long-term consequences 
may impact future generations to 
come.
