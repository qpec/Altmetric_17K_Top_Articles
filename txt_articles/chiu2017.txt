IMPORTANCE Animal experiments suggest that ingestion of pesticide mixtures at
environmentally relevant concentrations decreases the number of live-born offspring.
Whether the same is true in humans is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of preconception intake of pesticide residues in fruits
and vegetables (FVs) with outcomes of infertility treatment with assisted reproductive
technologies (ART).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This analysis included 325 women who completed a
diet assessment and subsequently underwent 541 ART cycles in the Environment and
Reproductive Health (EARTH) prospective cohort study (2007-2016) at a fertility center at a
teaching hospital. We categorized FVs as having high or low pesticide residues using a
validated method based on surveillance data from the US Department of Agriculture.
Cluster-weighted generalized estimating equations were used to analyze associations of
high–and low–pesticide residue FV intake with ART outcomes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adjusted probabilities of clinical pregnancy and live birth
per treatment cycle.
RESULTS In the 325 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.1 [4.0] y; body mass index, 24.1 [4.3]),
mean (SD) intakes of high–and low–pesticide residue FVs were 1.7 (1.0) and 2.8 (1.6)
servings/d, respectively. Greater intake of high–pesticide residue FVs was associated with a
lower probability of clinical pregnancy and live birth. Compared with women in the lowest
quartile of high-pesticide FV intake (<1.0 servings/d), women in the highest quartile (�2.3
servings/d) had 18% (95% CI, 5%-30%) lower probability of clinical pregnancy and 26%
(95% CI, 13%-37%) lower probability of live birth. Intake of low–pesticide residue FVs was not
significantly related to ART outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Higher consumption of high–pesticide residue FVs was
associated with lower probabilities of pregnancy and live birth following infertility treatment
with ART. These data suggest that dietary pesticide exposure within the range of typical
human exposure may be associated with adverse reproductive consequences.

ore than 90% of the US population has detectable
concentrations of pesticides or their metabolites in
their urine or blood samples.1 While pesticide expo-
sure occurs through a variety of routes, the primary route in
thegeneralpopulationisthroughdiet–especiallyintakeofcon-
ventionally grown fruits and vegetables (FVs).2-7 In the United
States, pesticides are regulated and evaluated by the US En-
vironmental Protection Agency to ensure the safety of the food
supply for human consumption. Nonetheless, there has been
a growing concern that permitted levels of pesticide residues
in food defined by traditional toxicological testing may be too
high, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant
women or infants.8,9
In rodent models, ingestion of pesticide mixtures in
early pregnancy at a concentration assumed to be without
adverse health effects increased the percentage of apoptosis
in embryos and decreased the number of live pups born.10,11
Evidence from human studies is scarce. Women occupation-
ally exposed to pesticides and women living in or near agri-
cultural areas may have increased risk of infertility and
adverse pregnancy outcomes.12-24 However, whether expo-
sure within the range of typical human exposure, such as
through diet, has any effect on reproductive outcomes in
humans is unknown.
We previously developed and validated a low-cost, ques-
tionnaire-based method—the Pesticide Residue Burden Score
(PRBS)—to estimate exposure to pesticide residues from FVs
in epidemiologic studies.25-27 In the present study, we aimed
to investigate the associations between preconception intake
of high– and low–pesticide residue FVs and outcomes of as-
sisted reproductive technologies (ART) in a prospective co-
hort of women undergoing infertility treatment.
Methods
Study Population
Women in this study were participants in the Environment and
ReproductiveHealth(EARTH)Study,anongoingprospectiveco-
hort established in 2006 to identify determinants of fertility
amongcouplespresentingtotheMassachusettsGeneralHospi-
talFertilityCenter(Boston,Massachusetts).28 Womenwereeli-
gible to participate if they were between 18 and 45 years and
plannedtousetheirowngametesforinfertilitytreatment.Wom-
en whose treating physician later determined that using donor
eggswasclinicallynecessaryremainedinthestudy.Amongwom-
en referred by physicians, approximately 60% of those ap-
proached by the research nurses enrolled in the study. Diet
assessment was introduced to the study in 2007. The current
analysisincludes325women(contributing541ARTcycles)whose
dietwasassessedandwhocontributedatleast1subsequentART
cyclebetweenApril2007andAugust2016.Womenwhodidnot
completeadietassessment(n = 113)orwhoseARTcyclesstarted
prior to assessment completion (n = 7) were excluded from the
present analysis. The study was approved by the Human Stud-
iesInstitutionalReviewBoardsoftheMassachusettsGeneralHos-
pital, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention. All participants signed
aninformedconsentafterthestudyprocedureswereexplained
by trained study staff.
On entry, height and weight were measured by trained
study staff to calculate body mass index (BMI, calculated as
weightinkilogramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared).Study
staff also administered a brief questionnaire to collect data on
demographic characteristics, medical history, and lifestyle fac-
tors. Participants completed a detailed take-home question-
naire with additional questions on reproductive history and
lifestyle factors. On this take-home questionnaire, partici-
pants were asked how often they consumed organic FVs dur-
ing the past 3 months. We considered women to be organic FV
consumers if they consumed organic FVs at least 3 times per
week (the median in this population); women with lower in-
take of organic FVs (<3 times/wk) were considered to be con-
ventional FV consumers.
Outcome Assessment
Clinical information was abstracted by trained study staff from
the patients’electronic medical records. We have previously
described details of patient clinical management elsewhere.28
Briefly, clinical staff monitored patients during gonadotropin
stimulation for serum estradiol, follicle size and counts, and
endometrial thickness for 2 days before oocyte retrieval, and
administered human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) to in-
duce ovulation approximately 36 hours before oocyte re-
trieval. Embryologists classified oocytes as germinal vesicle,
metaphase I, metaphase II (MII), or degenerated, and deter-
mined fertilization rate as the number of oocytes with 2 pro-
nuclei divided by the number of MII oocytes at 17 to 20 hours
after insemination. Cell cleavage rates of embryos were con-
sidered to be normal with a division of 2 to 4 cells on day 2 and
4 to 8 cells on day 3 of culture. A division below 2 cells on day
2 and 6 cells on day 3 was considered as slow while a division
of 4 or more cells on day 2 and 8 or more cells on day 3 was
designated accelerated. For this study, early ART end points
referred to any end points prior to embryo transfer, including
markersofovarianresponsestostimulation(peakestradiollev-
els, endometrial thickness, MII and total oocytes), fertiliza-
tionrate,andembryoquality.Weexcludedeggdonorandcryo-
genic cycles for the analysis of early ART end points.
Clinical outcomes were assessed per initiated cycle, in-
cluding implantation (defined as a serum β-hCG level
Key Points
Question Is there an association between exposure to pesticide
residues in fruits and vegetables and pregnancy outcomes?
Findings In a cohort of 325 women undergoing infertility
treatment with assisted reproductive technology, intake of
high–pesticide residue fruits and vegetables was associated with a
lower probability of live birth, while low–pesticide residue fruit and
vegetable intake was not associated with this outcome.
Meaning Dietary pesticide exposure within the range of typical
human exposure may be associated with adverse reproductive
consequences.

 >6 mIU/mL [to convert to IU/L, multiply by 1.0] typically mea-
sured approximately 17 days after oocyte retrieval), clinical
pregnancy (defined as presence of intrauterine gestational
sac[s] on ultrasonography at 6 weeks), and live birth (as the
birth of a neonate on or after 24 weeks of gestation).
We categorized total pregnancy loss into (1) early preg-
nancy loss, defined as a positive urine β-hCG test followed by
the absence of signs of clinical pregnancy, including chemi-
calpregnancylossandectopicpregnancy;and(2)clinicalpreg-
nancy loss, defined as an intrauterine pregnancy demise af-
ter a clinical pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion,
stillbirth, and therapeutic abortion. No molar pregnancies oc-
curred in this cohort.
Exposure Assessment
Diet was assessed before initiation of ART using a self-
administered, previously validated food frequency
questionnaire.29 Women reported how often they typically
consumed specified amounts of each food, beverage,
and supplement over the past year. Two data-derived dietary
pattern scores, the prudent and Western pattern,30 were used
to summarize overall food choices.
We used the annual reports from the US Department of Ag-
riculture Pesticide Data Program (PDP) to classify FVs accord-
ing to their mean pesticide residue status in the US food
supply.31 Details of the PRBS methods have been described
elsewhere.25,27,32 We considered 3 measures of contamina-
tion from the PDP to classify FVs: (1) the percentage of samples
tested with any detectable pesticides, (2) the percentage of
samples tested with pesticides exceeding the tolerance level,
and (3) the percentage of samples with 3 or more individual
detectable pesticides. The pesticide residue data in FVs were
averaged by annual PDP reports from 2006 through 2015, cor-
responding to the periods when the diet history of the partici-
pants was captured by the food frequency questionnaire.
Next, we categorized foods according to tertiles for each
of the 3 measurements of contamination and assigned a score
of 0 to FVs in the bottom tertile, 1 to FVs in the middle tertile,
and 2 for FVs in the top tertile. The PRBS for each food was the
sum of scores across the 3 PDP contamination measures. We
considered FVs with a PRBS of 4 or greater on a scale of 0 to 6
to be high–pesticide residue foods while FVs with a PRBS of
less than 4 to be low–pesticide residue foods. Based on these
criteria, 14 FVs were categorized as high pesticide residue and
22 as low pesticide residue (Table 1).
Statistical Analysis
Women were classified according to quartiles of total FV
intake, high–pesticide residue FV intake, and low–pesticide
residue FV intake. We conducted Kruskal-Wallis tests (for
continuous variables) and Fisher exact tests (for categorical
variables) to compare baseline characteristics across quar-
tiles of FV intake. To evaluate the relationship of FV intake
with ART outcomes, we used cluster-weighted generalized
estimating equations to account for within-person correla-
tions in the presence of nonignorable cluster size.33 Each
observation was weighted inversely to the number of cycles
they contributed to the analysis. We evaluated ART out-
comes per initiated cycle to estimate effects relevant in prac-
tice and mirror intention-to-treat analyses for studies of
ART.34,35 However, in a post-hoc analysis, we evaluated the
association of FV intake with risk of pregnancy loss only
among cycles in which implantation was achieved.34 Popula-
tion marginal means were used to present population aver-
ages adjusted for the covariates at their average levels for
continuous variables and weighted average levels of cat-
egorical variables in the model.36 Tests for linear trend were
performed using the median intake of FVs in each quartile as
a continuous variable.
Confounding was evaluated using directed acyclic graphs
based on prior knowledge.
Specifically, variables previously reported to be associ-
ated with live birth/pregnancy loss as well as associated with
FV intake were considered as potential confounders.37-40 In
addition, we included dietary pattern scores to distinguish re-
lations between FV intake from those of overall food choices.
The final multivariable models were adjusted for age (years),
BMI, smoking status (current/former vs never), race (white vs
nonwhite), supplemental folate intake (micrograms per day),
organic FV consumption frequency (<3 vs ≥3 times/wk), resi-
dential pesticide exposure history (yes vs no), prudent and
Western dietary patterns, total energy intake (kilocalories per
day), and infertility diagnosis (male factor vs female factor vs
unexplained). The model for high–pesticide residue FV in-
take was additionally adjusted for low-pesticide FV intake and
vice versa because they may confound each other. To mini-
mize residual confounding, we performed separate sensitiv-
ity analyses restricting to women younger than 40 years,
women without a history of miscarriage, autologous cycles,
and cycles initiated within 1 year of food frequency question-
naire completion. We also estimated the effect of substitut-
ing 1 serving/d of low–pesticide residue FVs for high–
pesticide residue FVs on clinical outcomes.41 All statistical
analyses were performed in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
P values were 2 sided. Findings were considered statistically
significant when P < .05.
Results
A total of 325 women underwent 541 ART cycles (range, 1-6),
of which 228 (42%) resulted in a live birth (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). Women had a mean (SD) intake of 1.7 (1.0) serv-
ings/d of high–pesticide residue FVs and 2.8 (1.6) servings/d
of low–pesticide residue FVs. Intakes of high– and low–
pesticideresidueFVswerepositivelycorrelatedwitheachother
(Spearman r = 0.57). Women who consumed more high–
pesticide residue FVs were more likely to report regular or-
ganic FV consumption, had higher total calorie and micronu-
trient intake, higher adherence to the prudent dietary pattern,
and a slightly higher prevalence of diminished ovarian re-
serve. Similar trends were observed with greater intake of low–
pesticide residue FVs except that no difference in prevalence
of diminished ovarian reserve was observed. Other character-
istics were similar across quartiles of high- or low-pesticide FV
intake (Table 2).

 Total FV intake was unrelated to probability of implanta-
tion,clinicalpregnancy,andlivebirth(Table3).However,when
FVs were classified as having high or low pesticide residues,
divergent patterns of associations with clinical pregnancy and
live birth emerged (Table 3). Specifically, high–pesticide resi-
dueFVintakewasinverselyassociatedwithprobabilityofclini-
cal pregnancy and live birth per initiated cycle. Compared with
women in the lowest quartile of high–pesticide residue FV in-
take (<1 serving/d), women in the highest quartile (≥2.3 serv-
ings/d) had 18% (95% CI, 5%-30%) lower probability of clini-
cal pregnancy and 26% (95% CI, 13%-37%) lower probability
of live birth. These associations persisted in sensitivity analy-
ses (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Low–pesticide residue FV in-
take was associated with a higher, albeit nonsignificant, prob-
ability of clinical pregnancy and live birth (Table 3). We found
no associations between intake of high– or low–pesticide resi-
due FVs with markers of response to ovarian stimulation, fer-
tilization rate, or embryo quality (eTable 2 and eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Next, we examined the associations of FV intake with risks
of pregnancy loss (Figure 1). High–pesticide residue FV in-
take was positively associated with probability of total preg-
nancy loss. The adjusted probabilities of total pregnancy loss
were 7% (95% CI, 3%-15%), 23% (95% CI, 16%-33%), 24% (95%

 Discussion
We evaluated the association between preconception intake
of FVs, considering their pesticide residue status, and ART out-
comes among women undergoing infertility treatment. We ob-
served that greater intake of high–pesticide residue FVs was
associated with lower probabilities of clinical pregnancy and
live birth per initiated cycle. The observed association with live
births was driven by a higher risk of early and clinical preg-
nancy loss. On the other hand, low–pesticide residue FV in-
take was associated with a lower risk of early pregnancy loss.
Replacing high–pesticide residue FVs with low–pesticide resi-
due FVs was estimated to provide the greatest benefit for
achieving clinical pregnancy and live birth.
While FVs are an important part of a healthy diet,42 they
also serve as the primary vehicle for pesticide residue expo-
sure in the general population.3 Earlier studies have shown
that many pesticides used in agriculture have deleterious ef-
fects on reproductive health outcomes, such as decreased
fertility, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or develop-
mental abnormalities,12-24 while a few others reported no
associations.43,44 Of note, in one of these studies, among 684
participants (73 cases, 611 controls) from agricultural coun-
ties of California, Bell et al18 found that the adjusted odds ra-
tiooffetaldeathforthoseexposedto3ormorepesticideclasses
was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.3-5.3), while those exposed to 1 or 2 pesti-
cide classes had an odds ratio of 1.1 (95% CI, 0.6-2.1). In an-
other study of women living on Ontario farms, Arbuckle et al24
showed that exposure to both fungicides and herbicides be-
fore conception doubled the risk of spontaneous abortion rela-
tive to women exposed only to fungicides, suggesting that pes-
ticide mixtures may confer a greater risk of fetal loss.
Nonetheless, most of these studies have focused on occupa-
tional workers or women living in or near agricultural areas.
The influence of exposure to pesticide residues primarily
through foods on pregnancy outcomes in the general popula-
tion remains unknown.

intakeofhigh–pesticidesFVsinthepresentstudy,aswellaslower
prevalenceofpreeclampsiaassociatedwithorganicvegetablecon-
sumptionintheearlierstudy.45However,giventhepaucityofthe
data, future studies are warranted to replicate these findings.
Our results are also in agreement with experimental ani-
mal data. Cavieres et al11 showed that pregnant mice exposed
to a pesticide mixture at a level lower than drinking water stan-
dards during a period spanning preimplantation and organo-
genesis produced a significant decrease in implantation sites
and number of live pups born. Further, Greenlee and
colleagues10 showed that a mixture of agricultural chemicals
at 1 reference dose (ie, an estimate of daily oral exposure that
is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious ef-
fects during lifetime) increased blastomere apoptosis and sup-
pressed cell proliferation of morulae, which may result in em-
bryonic demise or pregnancy loss. It is possible that pesticides
may impair pregnancy maintenance by affecting peri-
implantation embryo development, which is known as a pe-
riod of heightened susceptibility to malformations.50(pp421-423)
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. First, exposure to pesticides
was not directly assessed but was rather estimated from self-
reported FV intake paired with pesticide residue surveillance
data. Although we have adjusted for organic FV intake, data
on whether individual FVs were consumed as organic or con-
ventionalwerenotcollected,possiblyleadingtoexposuremis-
classification. However, our previous work has shown that
higher intake of high–pesticide residue FVs was significantly
associated with higher levels of urinary pesticide metabo-
lites, supporting the use of the PRBS as an adequate measure
to characterize exposure to pesticides through diet.26 Sec-
ond, our methodology does not allow linking specific pesti-
cides to adverse reproductive effects. Further confirmation
studies, preferably accounting for common chemical mix-
tures used in agriculture by biomarkers, are needed. Third, as
in all observational studies, we cannot rule out the possibil-
ity that residual (eg, significant differences in organic FV con-
sumption across quartiles of high–pesticide residue FV in-
take)orunmeasuredconfoundingmaystillbeexplainingsome
of our observed associations. However, women with greater
high-pesticide FV intake and those of greater low-pesticide FV
intake had similar patterns of baseline characteristics, sug-
gesting that the observed associations are due to intake of pes-
ticide residues rather than to residual confounding. Further-
more,resultswereconsistentafteraccountingformanyfactors
that could potentially affect the risk of pregnancy loss. An ad-
ditional limitation is that findings may not be generalizable to
the general population because participants were recruited
through a fertility clinic and intake of FVs in our cohort was
double the median intake in the US population (2 servings/d).51
However, the infertility cohort allowed us to examine the as-
sociation of dietary pesticide exposure with many pregnancy
outcomes that are not observable among couples becoming
pregnant on their own such as very early pregnancy losses. In
addition, demographic characteristics of the study partici-
pants were comparable to those of women seeking fertility
treatment in the United States,52 suggesting that results may
be generalizable to women seeking infertility treatment. Ad-
ditional strengths of the study include its prospective study
design and well-documented outcome measures.
Conclusions
In conclusion, intake of high–pesticide residue FVs was asso-
ciated with lower probabilities of clinical pregnancy and live
birthamongwomenundergoinginfertilitytreatment.Ourfind-
ings are consistent with animal studies showing that low-
dose pesticide ingestion may exert an adverse impact on sus-
taining pregnancy.11 Because, to our knowledge, this is the first
report of this relationship in humans, confirmation of these
findings is warranted.
