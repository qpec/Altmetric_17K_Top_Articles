Current widely used semiquantitative histological assessment methods are insensitive to identify 
subtle changes of liver fibrosis. Therefore, to precisely assess therapeutic efficacy on chronic hepatitis 
B (CHB), we explored the utility of qFibrosis (a fully-quantitative morphometric method employing 
second harmonic generation/two photon excitation fluorescence) in liver fibrosis evaluation. Fibrosis 
changes were evaluated by Ishak fibrosis scoring and qFibrosis in CHB patients with paired liver biopsies 
before and after 78 weeks’ antiviral therapy. A total of 162 patients with qualified paired biopsies were 
enrolled. Ishak fibrosis scoring revealed that 42.6% (69/162) of the patients achieved fibrosis regression 
(≥1-point decrease), 51.9% (84/162) remained stable, and 5.5% (9/162) showed progression (≥1-
point increase). qFibrosis showed similar trends in the groups of regression and progression patients 
as evaluated by Ishak. However, in Ishak stable patients, qFibrosis revealed hitherto undetected 
changes, allowing for further subcategorization into regression (“Regression by qFibrosis”; 40/84, 
47.6%), stable (29/84, 34.5%), and progression (“Progression by qFibrosis”; 15/84, 17.9%) groups. 
These newly fine-tuned categories were supported by changes of morphological parameters of fibrosis, 
collagen percentage area, and liver stiffness measurements. In conclusion, qFibrosis can be used to 
quantitatively identify subtle changes of liver fibrosis in CHB patients after antiviral therapy.
There is compelling evidence that liver fibrosis and even cirrhosis can be reversed after suppression of hepatitis 
B virus (HBV)1,2. In a landmark study, treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 5 years resulted in 51% 
(176/348) of patients achieving fibrosis/cirrhosis regression3. Similarly, the entecavir study showed 88% (50/57) of 
patients achieving at least a 1-point improvement in Ishak fibrosis scores after 5 years of treatment4.
The gold standard for evaluation of liver fibrosis improvement is still the liver biopsy5. Most studies have 
assessed fibrosis changes with semiquantitative numerical scoring systems such as stages 0 to 4 for Scheuer6/
Metavir7 and 0 to 6 for Ishak system8. Regression has been defined as at least 1-point decrease of fibrosis stage

after treatment3,4,9. However, in the era of potent anti-HBV treatment, relatively coarse assessment provided by 
the 6-point semiquantitative system may not suffice to evaluate progression or regression of fibrosis2.
In our recent study published in Hepatology, we have developed a new staging system, the Beijing Classification, 
for assessment of dynamic changes of liver fibrosis pre- and post-treatment10. The most important novelty of the 
Beijing Classification is that it includes not only extent (stage) of fibrosis, but the quality of fibrosis, namely if the 
specimen shows predominantly regressive, progressive or indeterminate features, the P-I-R. Although we found 
this classification to be particularly relevant in the era of successful antiviral therapies, we perceive a need for a 
more quantitative method to evaluate subtle fibrosis changes and to identify different outcomes, particularly in 
clinical trials.
Recently, qFibrosis, a stain-free and fully automated approach based on second harmonic generation/
two-photon excitation fluorescence (SHG/TPEF) microscopy has been developed11,12. qFibrosis is objective and 
reproducible and has been demonstrated to be a reliable quantitative method for the evaluation of liver fibrosis; 
exhibiting high correlation with Metavir fibrosis scores13,14. This tool provides the potential for precise quantifi-
cation of histological fibrosis changes. In this study, we aim to evaluate the finer changes in liver fibrosis by SHG/
TPEF in CHB patients with paired liver biopsies performed pre- and post-antiviral treatment.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients. 
A total of 183 patients with paired liver biopsies 
were enrolled. After excluding unqualified biopsies, 162 patients with sufficient pre- and post-treatment liver 
specimens were included in the final analysis. All specimens were assessed by Ishak modified HAI grading and 
fibrosis staging and SHG/TPEF-based qFibrosis (Fig. 1). Patients were predominantly male (78%) with a median 
age of 36 years, median baseline HBV DNA of 6.80 Log IU/mL and ALT level of 81.4 U/L. After 78 weeks of anti-
viral therapy, 74.5% of patients had HBV DNA level <20 IU/mL, significantly decreased ALT and AST (81.4 U/L 
to 25.5 U/L and 52.0 U/L to 23.4 U/L, respectively; P < 0.001), and improved liver stiffness values (from 10.6 kpa 
to 6.6 kpa; P < 0.001) (Table 1).
After 78 weeks of treatment, both inflammation and fibrosis were significantly improved. The proportion of 
patients with pronounced necroinflammation (necroinflammatory scores ≥
10) decreased from 16.7% (27/162) 
at baseline to 0 at week 78. In addition, the proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis (stage 4) and cirrhosis 
(stages 5 and 6) decreased from 42.0% (68/162) at baseline to 25.3% (41/162) at week 78. Overall, 42.6% (69/162) 
of patients achieved fibrosis regression (at least a 1-point improvement in Ishak fibrosis scores), 51.9% (84/162) 
remained stable (no change in Ishak scores), while 5.5% (9/162) showed fibrosis progression (at least a 1-point 
increase in Ishak scores) (Table 1).
According to P-I-R score, 63.9% (only applicable for Ishak ≥
3, 78/122) of patients were predominantly pro-
gressive at baseline, but this proportion declined to 8.0% (only applicable for Ishak ≥
3, 8/100) at week 78. The 
proportion of patients with predominantly regressive features increased from 10.7% (13/122) at baseline to 69.0% 
(69/100) at week 78.

Consistency between changes in qFibrosis and Ishak scores in patients with decreased or 
increased Ishak stage. 
As shown in Supplementary Table 2, we evaluated multiple different cut-off values of 
Δ
qFibrosis for regression. Considering both sensitivity and specificity, the range between ± 0.4 to ± 0.6 (average 
of ±0.5) could serve as an acceptable cut-off value. Patients were further categorized by qFibrosis into “Regression 
by qFibrosis” (≥
0.5 stage decrease by qFibrosis,), “Progression by qFibrosis” (≥
0.5 stage increase by qFibrosis), and 
“Stable by qFibrosis” (qFibrosis changes <0.5 stage).
There was relatively good agreement between qFibrosis and Ishak scores in patients with decreased (Fig. 2A and B) 
 
and increased Ishak stages (Fig. 2E and F). Of 12 patients with 2-stage improvements, 11 (92%) were classified as 
“Regression by qFibrosis” and one (8%) was “Stable by qFibrosis”. In patients with 1-stage decrease by Ishak score, 
67% (38/57) were classified as “Regression by qFibrosis” and 30% (17/57) were considered “Stable by qFibrosis”. 
It is noteworthy that the Ishak scoring system is a categorical assignment based largely on architectural changes, 
instead of quantitative measurement of fibrosis content. The changes in fibrosis content between early Ishak stages 
in biopsy tissue are minimal; thereby lending these cases to be classified as stable by qFibrosis. In those nine pro-
gressed patients with increasing Ishak stage, 67% (6/9) were also considered “Progression by qFibrosis” while 33% 
(3/9) were reclassified as “Stable by qFibrosis” (Table 2).
The more severe the fibrosis, the higher the agreement between qFibrosis and Ishak system for the regres-
sion and progression categories. Consistencies of 100%, 83% and 75%, respectively, were recorded for cases of 
advanced fibrosis with Ishak ≥
4 (Table 2). Besides, a trend towards a greater decrease in qFibrosis was seen in 
those cases with a higher baseline Ishak stage. The median qFibrosis decreased by 2.2 in patients with cirrhosis at 
baseline, which is higher than those with advanced fibrosis (decreased by 1.4) and early fibrosis (decreased by 0.8) 
(Fig. 3A). A similar trend was observed in patients with 1-stage decrease in Ishak scores (Fig. 3B).
Precise subclassification of patients with “stable” Ishak stages by qFibrosis. 
It was interesting to note 
that in those Ishak stage-stable cases, only about one third was identified as stable by qFibrosis, with the other two thirds 
were reassigned into either regression or progression groups by qFibrosis assessment (Fig. 2C and D; Table 2). Of 84 
patients with stable Ishak scores, 34% (29/84) were “Stable by qFibrosis”, 48% (40/84) were “Regression by qFibrosis”
, and 
18% (15/84) were “Progression by qFibrosis” (Table 2). Of note is that the proportion of “Regression by qFibrosis” patients 
was higher in patients with ≥
stage 4 disease than in those with Ishak stage 2–3 at baseline (Fig. 3C).

Figure 4 shows a representative case with paired biopsies, which were considered stable by Ishak staging 
but were reclassified as “Regression by qFibrosis”. qFibrosis decreased from 4.5 to 3.2 after 78 weeks of therapy 
while the Ishak scores remained at stage 5. LSM also decreased from 27.9 Kpa to 10.5 Kpa. The most remarkable 
regression occurred in the septal compartment. At baseline, fibrous septa were wide with loosely aggregated 
collagen fibers and inflammatory cell infiltrates. After treatment, the septa became delicate, densely aggregated 
and acellular.

subclassification by qFibrosis. 
Table 3 shows Ishak staging of all patients into regression, stable or pro-
gression categories. The 84 Ishak “stable” cases were reassigned as “Regression by qFibrosis”, “Stable by qFibrosis” 
and “Progression by qFibrosis”. To compare these new subcategories, P-I-R score was assessed. The proportion of 
patients with regressive fibrosis features at week 78 was 71.9% (23/32) in “Regression by qFibrosis” patients, higher 
than that in “Stable by qFibrosis” (57.9%, 11/19) and “Progression by qFibrosis” groups (60.0%, 6/10).

At baseline, qFibrosis correlated well with liver stiffness (r = 0.6, P < 0.001). With the improvement of inflam-
mation, LSM significantly decreased after treatment and the association with qFibrosis decreased (r = 0.3, 
P < 0.001). Changes of LSM were also evaluated. LSM decreased by 46% in “Regression by qFibrosis” patients, 
comparable to 44% in patients with decreasing Ishak stage (P = 0.595). Decrease of LSM in these two regression 
groups were more than that in “Stable by qFibrosis” and “Progression by qFibrosis” groups. Increase of LSM in 
“Progression by qFibrosis” patients was comparable with that in patients with increasing Ishak stage. Dynamic 
changes of LSM among groups were further assessed. As shown in Supplementary Figure 2, in the group of 
regression by Ishak and “Regression by qFibrosis” patients, LSM decreased rapidly after 26 weeks of therapy, fol-
lowed by a more gradual decrease after that. However, those patients with stable or progression changes had more 
fluctuating liver stiffness values, especially in patients with increasing Ishak stage.
Similarly, total collagen percentage area (CPA) decreased by 2.6 in “Regression by qFibrosis” patients, which 
is even greater than the 1.3 decrease documented in patients with decreasing Ishak stage. Total CPA showed 
minimal change of 0.1 in “Stable by qFibrosis” and increase of 0.7 in “Progression by qFibrosis” patients. We also 
employed SHG/TPEF analysis to identify the three main locations of collagen. Among portal, septal and fibrillar 
CPA, similar results were seen in changes from septal and fibrillar compartments but not in the portal compart-
ment, indicating a possibility that fibrosis regression may begin in septal and fibrillary areas instead of portal areas 
(Table 3).
We analyzed the baseline and post-treatment factors associated with fibrosis regression. As shown in 
Supplementary Table 3, higher baseline Ishak stage, LSM and qFibrosis were identified as predictors for fibrosis 
regression; this is consistent with other studies by Wang et al.15 and Marcellin et al.3.
Changes of multi-morphological fibrosis features by Heatmap analysis to confirm subclassifi-
cation by qFibrosis. 
Multiple morphological collagen features from portal, septal and fibrillar areas were 
further identified by SHG/TPEF. Changes of collagen features were comparable between “Regression by Ishak” 
and “Regression by qFibrosis” groups (Fig. 5). Features from septal areas decreased more significantly than those 
from portal and fibrillar areas, supporting the rationale that the most remarkable morphological change in fibro-
sis regression was the thinning of fibrous septa. Most of these features changed minimally in “Stable by qFibrosis” 
group, and increased in both “Progression by qFibrosis” and “Progression by Ishak” groups.
Discussion
In this study based on a well-characterized cohort of CHB patients on antiviral therapy with paired liver biopsies, 
we evaluated fibrosis regression by both semiquantitative histological fibrosis scoring (Ishak) and fully auto-
mated quantitative method (qFibrosis). Changes in qFibrosis were consistent with the increase or decrease of 
Ishak fibrosis scores. However, qFibrosis can further identify fibrosis improvements in patients who remained 
unchanged in Ishak stages.
The biggest improvement was in the analysis of those “on the fence” cases - stable as defined by Ishak; qFibrosis 
was able to distinguish a range of histological outcomes. In more than half (52% in this study) of the Ishak “stable” 
patients after anti-HBV treatment, qFibrosis identified 48% of patients actually showing significant improvement, 
supported by liver stiffness measurements and CPA. These complexities were previously imperceptible by the

Ishak methodology alone. Even after long term antiviral therapy, some patients may still have fibrosis progres-
sion. Therefore, early detection of patients with subtle collagen increase will contribute to closer monitoring with 
supposedly lower incidence of clinical outcomes. Hence, qFibrosis can provide critical information on treatment 
evaluation and need for treatment modification, with these previously undetected changes. This precise method 
can also be used to assess the efficacy of new anti-fibrotic therapies in clinical trials.

Compared to conventional quantification assessment by CPA in assessing dynamic changes of fibrosis, qFi-
brosis provided more detailed collagen features incorporating collagen spatial location and architectural organ-
ization information16–18. Therefore, we evaluated changes of different collagen features from portal, septal and 
fibrillar areas. In this study, the new quantitative approach showed that fibrosis regression was most dominant in 
the septal area (Figs 4 and 5). CPA and other detailed collagen features (number of string, number of short, long, 
thick and thin string) from septal areas decreased significantly both in “Regression by Ishak” and “Regression by 
qFibrosis” groups.
Fibrous septa have been regarded as an important parameter in fibrosis progression and regression19,20. Some 
septal features (delicate, perforated and splitting) have been demonstrated to correlate with the fibrosis repair 
process21. In our previous study, we proposed a new (P-I-R) classification based on the balance between progres-
sive and regressive septa10. The current study also shows the importance of septa resorption in fibrosis regression 
during a relatively short period of antiviral therapy; thus, implying that qFibrosis may be a useful tool to analyze 
the pathological mechanism of fibrosis regression.
Nowadays, non-invasive assessment methods employing either serum markers or LSM continue to be good 
surrogate markers for liver fibrosis evaluation in CHB patients. However, these markers have not been qualified 
to evaluate dynamic changes of liver fibrosis after treatment. APRI and FIB-4 have been demonstrated to be not 
suitable for assessment of improvements in liver fibrosis following therapy in CHB patients22. Besides, given 
the fact that most patients had decrease in ALT and hepatic necroinflammation, improvement of LSM by tran-
sient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) after antiviral therapy may be related to 
diminished necroinflammatory activity rather than fibrosis regression23. MR elastography (MRE) remains costly 
and technology-dependent for widespread use in routine practice23. The correlation of fibrosis improvement as 
predicted by non-invasive measurement with that by histology has yet to be determined. In the meantime, liver 
biopsy still remains the best standard to evaluate fibrosis regression following antiviral therapy in CHB patients.
Our study and this new technology have several limitations. First, fibrosis regression may improve 
liver-related clinical endpoints such as portal hypertension, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carci-
noma3. Unfortunately, the low incidence of liver-related endpoints in our current study makes it impossible to 
analyze the association of complications with fibrosis regression. In our study, all patients will be followed up 
for another 5 years and a third liver biopsy will be performed after 3 years; the association of fibrosis regression 
and clinical endpoints will be evaluated then. Second, SHG/TPEF still has its limitations. The process of spatial 
location identification and collagen architectural features extraction should be more standardized. Thickness of 
tissue sections which may affect the collagen content was not considered. Architectural collagen from large portal 
tracts and liver capsule cannot be distinguished automatically, although we have excluded it manually. Finally, the

septa were wide with loosely aggregated collagen fibers and inflammatory cell infiltration at baseline. (B) After 
treatment, the septa became delicate, densely aggregated and acellular.

process of feature identification and quantification is costly and time-consuming compared to the conventional 
semiquantitative scoring systems. Technology improvements may help to broaden its usage not only in clinical 
trials but in assessment of anti-fibrotic therapies in the future.
In conclusion, qFibrosis can sensitively reflect fine histological fibrosis changes and detect fibrosis improve-
ments. This can be used in the assessment of therapeutic efficacies and fibrosis outcome evaluation in clinical 
trials.

paraffin-embedded, 5 µm thick histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson 
Trichrome and Reticulin24. All biopsy samples were evaluated independently by two pathologists from central 
laboratory. Discordant cases were further determined by a third senior pathologist (TLW). Ishak modified his-
tology activity index (HAI) grading and staging system was employed to assess necroinflammatory activity and 
fibrosis8. P-I-R score (predominantly progressive, indeterminate and predominantly regressive) was used to assess 
the dynamic changes of liver fibrosis pre- and post-treatment10. All pathologists were blinded to treatment assign-
ment, biopsy sequence and other clinical details. Fibrosis regression was defined as at least 1-point decrease in 
Ishak fibrosis scores.
SHG/TPEF imaging for establishment of qFibrosis. 
All liver biopsy specimens were imaged 
by Genesis200TM (HistoIndex Pte. Ltd, Singapore), employing SHG/TPEF technology-based microscopy 
(Supplementary Figure 1)11,13. Images were acquired at 20 ×
 objective on unstained histological liver sections 
with 512 ×
 512 pixel resolution of a single 200 ×
 200 μ
m2 tile. In order to avoid missing information from biopsy 
tissues, each section was fully imaged and stitched by multiple adjacent images. To determine only disease-related

collagen, image artifacts and structural collagen in large portal tracts and blood vessel were excluded. The proce-
dure of identifying and extracting collagen features from portal, septal, and fibrillar areas can be obtained from 
Xu et al.13.
The sophisticated image analysis algorithms extracted 100 collagen features from SHG images. The fea-
tures were then normalized by image segmentations of TPEF images which were considered as the tissue size. 
Correlation analysis between the collagen features and fibrosis stages and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 
test were used to select the most important features for establishing qFibrosis. Nonlinear regression model 
was selected to combine the collagen features into a single index based on the distribution of fibrosis stages. 
Eventually, a model of 15 features (Supplementary Table 1) revealed the best performance overall. The qFibrosis 
was calculated by the following equation:

where Xi was the value of the i-th selected features. Feature selection and model fitting were processed by Matlab 
2015a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).
Figure 5. Changes of multi-morphological collagen features pre- and post-treatment by Heatmap analysis. The 
color scale represents the changes of collagen features ((post-pre)/pretreatment). Red color indicates fibrosis 
progression, whereas green or blue color indicates regression. Changes of collagen features were comparable 
between “Regression by Ishak” and “Regression by qFibrosis” groups. Most of these features hardly changed in 
“Stable by qFibrosis” group, but increased in “Progression by qFibrosis” and “Progression by Ishak” groups. CPA,

Liver stiffness measurements and laboratory evaluations. 
Liver stiffness measured by transient 
elastography (Fibroscan; Echosens, Paris, France) was performed by experienced operators following the man-
ufacturer’s recommendations25. The results were expressed in kilopascal (Kpa) as the median of at least 10 valid 
measurements. Only procedures with the success rate of at least 60% and the interquartile range-to-liver stiffness 
ratio lower than 30% were included in the final analysis23.
Liver tests (including ALT, AST, albumin and bilirubin) were performed at local center laboratories according 
to standard procedures. HBV serological markers (HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-HBc) were assessed 
using Abbott Architect i2000 (ABBOTT, Wiesbaden, Germany). Serum HBV DNA levels were measured by 
Roche COBAS®TaqMan® HBV Test, a real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay which has a lower limit 
of quantification of 20 IU/mL.
Statistical analysis. 
Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages. Continuous variables 
were expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) or mean ± standard deviation (SD). Paired samples t-test and 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare clinical data pre- and post-treatment. McNemar’s test was used 
to compare the changes of histological scores pre- and post-treatment. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test 
were used to assess the changes of LSM and collagen percentage area (CPA) in specific conditions. All statistical 
tests were two-sided. Statistical significance level was set as P < 0.05. Data analysis were performed using SPSS 
(version 22.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).
Clinical Trial Number. 
NCT01938781, NCT01938820.
