ABSTRACT
RICE, H. M., S. T. JAMISON, and I. S. DAVIS. Footwear Matters: Influence of Footwear and Foot Strike on Load Rates during
Running. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 48, No. 12, pp. 2462–2468, 2016. Introduction: Running with a forefoot strike (FFS) pattern has
been suggested to reduce the risk of overuse running injuries, due to a reduced vertical load rate compared with rearfoot strike (RFS) running.
However, resultant load rate has been reported to be similar between foot strikes when running in traditional shoes, leading to questions
regarding the value of running with a FFS. The influence of minimal footwear on the resultant load rate has not been considered. This study
aimed to compare component and resultant instantaneous loading rate (ILR) between runners with different foot strike patterns in their
habitual footwear conditions. Methods: Twenty-nine injury-free participants (22 men, seven women) ran at 3.13 mIsj1 along a 30-m
runway, with their habitual foot strike and footwear condition. Ground reaction force data were collected. Peak ILR values were
compared between three conditions; those who habitually run with an RFS in standard shoes, with an FFS in standard shoes, and with
an FFS in minimal shoes. Results: Peak resultant, vertical, lateral, and medial ILR were lower (P G 0.001) when running in minimal shoes
with an FFS than in standard shoes with either foot strike. When running with an FFS, peak posterior ILR were lower (P G 0.001) in minimal
than standard shoes. Conclusions: When running in a standard shoe, peak resultant and component ILR were similar between
footstrike patterns. However, load rates were lower when running in minimal shoes with a FFS, compared with running in standard
shoes with either foot strike. Therefore, it appears that footwear alters the load rates during running, even with similar foot strike patterns.

T
he relationship between foot strike pattern and injury
during running has been the subject of much dis-
cussion in recent years. This is because the vertical
impact transient characteristic of a rearfoot strike (RFS) (3)
is associated with a high rate of loading experienced by the
body. The musculoskeletal system is viscoelastic in nature
and therefore sensitive to high rates of loading. This was
underscored by earlier animal studies that demonstrated that
impulsive impact loading was associated with both bony (22)
and cartilaginous (23) injuries. In humans, high load rates
during running have since been associated with lower ex-
tremity overuse injuries in retrospective studies (17,21,31).
A recent prospective study suggests that high load rates
can distinguish between those who develop any medically
diagnosed running-related injury and those who have never
been injured, further strengthening this relationship (8).
It has previously been reported that a forefoot strike (FFS)
pattern is missing the impact transient in the vertical ground
reaction force that is characteristic of an RFS pattern (15).
This FFS pattern has been associated with markedly lower
vertical loading rates (15). In a recent study, Daoud and col-
leagues (7) reported that collegiate cross-country runners who
habitually FFS experience fewer repetitive stress running
injuries compared with those who habitually RFS. Addi-
tionally, transitioning to an FFS pattern has been reported to
resolve a variety of chronic running-related injuries includ-
ing patellofemoral pain syndrome (4) and anterior compart-
ment syndrome (9). However, footwear was not considered
in these studies. Additionally, all of these studies focused
only on the vertical component of the ground reaction force.
Although the vertical ground reaction force is the largest
component of the total ground reaction force, forces in the
anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions also
contribute to the loading forces the body experiences. Yet,
the resultant ground reaction force, and its associated load
rate, has received little attention in the running literature.
The resultant load rate may be important in terms of injury
risk, because this is the total rate of loading that is applied to
the body and was found to be at least as high as the vertical
instantaneous loading rate (ILR) by Boyer et al. (2). These

 authors reported that the resultant ILR was similar between
habitual RFS and FFS runners in standard running shoes,
despite slightly lower vertical ILR when running with an
FFS compared with an RFS. They also found that ILR in the
posterior and medial directions were higher when running
with an FFS than an RFS, likely due to impact peaks in these
directions that are characteristic of traditionally shod FFS
running. These increases in posterior and medial ILR may
explain why the resultant ILR was similar between foot
strikes. If there is no difference in the total rate of loading to
the body between a FFS and a RFS, it is reasonable to question
the overall value of FFS running. However, this similarity in
resultant ILR has only been observed during running in tra-
ditional, cushioned running shoes with a heel–toe drop.
Minimal shoes are often recommended when transitioning
to a FFS pattern, as their lack of cushioning discourages
landing on the heel. In fact, running in minimal shoes has
been shown to encourage a more anterior foot strike than
running in traditional shoes (20,27). Landing on stiffer sur-
faces has been shown to result in more compliant landings
(1,10,16), thus running in minimal shoes may have a similar
influence. Running in minimal shoes has been shown to result
in lower vertical impact loading than running in standard
shoes (27) but resultant load rates were not examined in this
study. These authors also noted a more anterior foot strike
in minimal shoes, but comparisons to running with a FFS
pattern in standard shoes were not made. It should be noted
that running barefoot or in minimalist footwear has been
associated with stress reactions in the metatarsals (11,24,25).
However, it remains unclear whether this was the influence
of footwear or was confounded by the brief transition these
runners underwent. Boyer et al. (2) reported that when run-
ners were asked to transition to a novel RFS or FFS, they
immediately exhibited exaggerated RFS or FFS character-
istics compared with the characteristics of runners in their
habitual group. This suggests that the novel condition was
not representative of the habitual state and highlights the
need for more ecologically valid research in which partici-
pants run in their typical condition.
The aim of this study was to assess the component, as well
as the resultant GRF and ILR during running in three distinct
groups of runners. These groups were: those who habitually
run in standard shoes with an RFS; those who habitually run
in standard shoes with a FFS; and those who habitually run in
minimal shoes with an FFS. It was hypothesized that FFS
runners would demonstrate a lower peak vertical ILR than
RFS runners. It was also hypothesized that running with an
FFS pattern in minimal shoes would result in lower posterior,
medial, and lateral ILR, and therefore a lower peak resultant
ILR, than running with a FFS pattern in standard shoes.
METHODS
Participants. Twenty-nine participants, age 18–60 yr
were included in the study (Table 1). These participants were
part of a larger study of healthy runners. Participants were
required to run at least 10 miles per week, with a minimum
running pace of 8.5 min per mile (3.12 mIsj1). Participants
were injury-free at the time of data collection, and had been
injury-free for at least 6 months prior. Habitual footwear was
recorded. Foot strike was determined from frame-by-frame
observation of videos (125 frames per second) capturing force
plate contact from a sagittal plane view. Only one camera
was used, allowing observation of either the medial right
foot, or the lateral left foot. Foot strike pattern was observed
from the video analysis for each trial, and the participant was
categorized as running with either an RFS (heel first land-
ing) or an FFS (forefoot first landing) based on observation
of all of their recorded trials. No participants demonstrated
a combination of both RFS and FFS running in this study.
Runners with a midfoot strike (flat foot landing) were not
included in this study, because there were fewer than five
midfoot strike runners in each footwear condition. Once
footstrike pattern was classified, those who ran with an FFS
pattern in traditional shoes and those who ran with a FFS
pattern in minimal shoes (defined as having minimal cush-
ioning and heel–toe drop e 4 mm) were included. An equal
number of those who run with a RFS pattern in traditional
shoes were randomly selected and were also included. The
study was approved by the institutional review board, and all
participants provided written informed consent.
Protocol. Each participant was provided with a shoe
consistent with the type of shoe they habitually wore for at
least 50% of their running miles. The standard neutral lab-
oratory shoe was the Nike Air Pegasus, and the minimal
laboratory shoe was the inov-8i BARE-X-200. Participants
warmed up on a treadmill, running at 2.24 mIsj1 for 3 min,
followed by overground running familiarization trials. Force
data were collected at 1500 Hz using two AMTI force plates
(AMTI, Watertown, MA). Data were collected while par-
ticipants ran at 3.13 mIsj1 (T5%) along a 30-m runway. Five
trials per side in which the foot was completely on the force
plate were included. Participants were not aware that force
data were being collected, or that foot strike was being
assessed, thus minimizing the likelihood of plate targeting or
alteration of foot strike.
Data analysis. Force data were filtered using a fourth-
order 50-Hz low-pass Butterworth filter in Visual3D (C-
motion, Rockville, MD). Variables were extracted for each
trial using customized Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA)
codes. Data from only those trials in which the right leg
contacted the force plate were used throughout. Stance was
identified when vertical GRF 9 10 N. Variables were obtained
from each trial. Time series data were then time normalized
and averaged across trials for visualization purposes only.

 Comparisons were made between those who habitually run
with a RFS in a standard shoe (SRFS), those who habitually
run with an FFS in a standard shoe (SFFS), and those who
habitually run with a FFS in a minimal shoe (MFFS).
Variables. Component ILRs were determined by calcu-
lating the derivative of the corresponding GRF with respect
to time. Resultant ILR was the resultant of component ILRs
(rather than the derivative of the resultant GRF). This ensured
that positive ILR values were obtained, so that the resultant
magnitude would be more easily interpreted. GRF and ILR
values were normalized to body weight (BW). The percent-
age of foot strikes which included a vertical impact peak was
determined for each group, where a vertical impact peak was
defined as a local maximum in vertical GRF that occurred
before the overall maximum vertical GRF. These percent-
ages were provided for reference and were not included in
statistical analyses. Ground contact times were also com-
pared across groups.
Peak medial (negative direction) and lateral (positive di-
rection) GRF values were obtained from the first 25% of
stance. In the posterior (negative direction) GRF, an initial
peak is often observed before the greatest peak value, par-
ticularly when FFS running. This posterior impact peak was
defined as the greatest local minimum in the first 15% of
stance. The maximum ILR value in the first 25% of stance
was obtained for the resultant, as well as in the vertical,
lateral, and medial directions, whereas the posterior ILR was
the maximum value in the first 15% of stance. Previous
studies of RFS running have obtained the vertical load rate
between 20% and 80% of the time of the vertical GRF im-
pact peak (6,14,17,19,21,29,32). However, when running
with an FFS pattern, an impact peak may not be present, in
which case, an alternative method is required to calculate
load rate. Samaan et al. (26) used 13% of stance (the average
time of an impact peak in the RFS pattern) over which to
calculate the load rates in FFS runners. Boyer et al. (2) used
a similar approach, but used 14% of stance. Goss and Gross
(12) considered the load rate for runners without impact
peaks between 3% and 12% of stance. As we have found
vertical load rate peaks in FFS to occur later in the stance
cycle, we calculated these over the first 25% of stance. How-
ever, for comparison to other studies, we also calculated peak
vertical load rates in FFS runners in the first 13% of stance
(peak vILR13).
Statistical analyses. The data were determined to be
non-normally distributed according to Kolmogorov–Smirnov
tests and the observation of histograms. Nonparametric
Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to identify whether there was
a main effect of group on GRF and ILR variables, with P G
0.05 indicating a significant main effect. Where there was
a main effect, Mann–Whitney U tests identified where dif-
ferences between groups occurred. A post hoc subanalysis
was also conducted on the minimal footwear group. This is
because half of the shoes classified as minimal had some
cushioning (partial minimal, n = 5) and half had no cush-
ioning (full minimal, n = 5). The vertical and resultant ILR,
as well as the percentage of foot strikes with impact peaks in
these two minimal footwear subgroups were compared de-
scriptively with the two standard shoe groups.
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics of the participants are pre-
sented in Table 1. There were 22 male and 7 female partic-
ipants. The majority of those who habitually ran with an FFS
in either footwear condition were men (89%). There were no
differences in age, height, body mass, or BMI between groups.
There was a main effect for ground contact time (P G
0.001), which was lowest in the SFFS group, and highest in
the SRFS group (mean [SD] SRFS: 270 (23) ms; SFFS: 246
(20) ms; MFFS: 260 (10) ms, P G 0.001 for all comparisons).
Impact peaks, defined as local maxima during early stance,
were present in 96% of foot strikes in the SRFS group,
compared with 16% in the SFFS group and 32% in the MFFS

 group. Group mean GRF and ILR time histories are presented
in Figure 1 (resultant and vertical) and Figure 2 (AP and
ML directions). Peak GRF and ILR values are presented in
Figures 3 and 4, respectively. There were main effects for
posterior, lateral, and medial impact peaks (P G 0.001 in all
cases). Posterior impact peak was lowest in the SRFS group
and highest in the SFFS group. Lateral impact peak was lower
in the MFFS group than both standard shoe groups. Medial
impact peak was higher in the SFFS group than both the
SRFS and MFFS groups.
There were main effects for ILR in all directions, includ-
ing the resultant (P G 0.001 in all cases). Resultant and ver-
tical ILR were lower in MFFS than both standard shoe groups.
Posterior ILR values were higher in the SFFS group than both
the SRFS and MFFS groups. Lateral and medial ILR values
were lower in MFFS than both standard shoe groups. Peak
vertical ILR calculated over the first 13% of stance (Peak
vILR13) was higher in the SRFS group than both the SFFS
(P = 0.007) and MFFS (P G 0.001) groups (mean [SD] SRFS:
71.12 [27.70] BWIsj1; SFFS: 55.24 [14.22] BWIsj1; MFFS:
47.10 [12.00] BWIsj1). Time of peak vertical ILR (mean
(SD) values as a percentage of stance) occurred at 9.0% (2.2%)
in SRFS, 14.4% (4.2%) in SFFS, and 10.6% (7.5%) in MFFS
runners. The range of values for time of peak vertical ILR for
the SRFS, SFFS, and MFFS groups, respectively, were 4.4%–
12.7%, 5.0%–20.3%, and 1.7%–24.5%.
Subanalysis results. Both partial and full minimal shoe
subgroups exhibited lower resultant and vertical load rates
than the groups who either RFS or FFS in standard shoes.
However, vertical and resultant ILR were 17% and 15% lower,
respectively, in those who habitually FFS in full minimal shoes
compared with those who habitually FFS in partial minimal
shoes (Fig. 5). Additionally, all of the impact peaks noted in
the minimally shod group (32% of footstrikes) were found
in those who habitually run in partial minimal shoes. Those
habituated to full minimal shoes exhibited no impact peaks.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to determine the influence
of foot strike and footwear on component and resultant

 ground reaction forces and load rates in runners in their ha-
bitual conditions. Results of this study suggest that forefoot
striking in shoes with the least cushioning results in the lowest
rates of loading.
Ground reaction force. GRF time histories displayed
patterns that differed according to foot strike pattern. When
running with an RFS, the majority of foot strikes displayed a
distinct impact peak, which was not the case when running
with an FFS in either shoe. This is consistent with previous
findings (12,13). Distinct posterior and medial impact peaks
were observed in both FFS groups which were less evident
when running with an RFS, also consistent with previous
findings (2,3,18,29). Boyer et al. (2) suggested that the ini-
tial posterior and medial impact peaks that occur during FFS
running may result from a rapid change in direction of the
foot center of mass during stance, which does not occur during
RFS running. The lower lateral GRF when running in mini-
mal shoes compared with standard shoes may be the result of
a smaller lateral flare in minimal shoes than standard shoes.
This results in a smaller moment arm for the vertical ground
reaction force, thereby reducing the pronatory moment on the
foot. This may minimize the amount of change in direction of
the center of pressure at contact. The mechanical character-
istics of the shoe, particularly the rigidity, likely also influence
the amount of change in direction of the center of pressure
throughout stance. The magnitude of GRF in the AP and ML
directions is considerably lower than in the vertical direction
for all groups. Nonetheless, these components contribute to
the shear forces applied to the body and may be important in
terms of injury. For example, it is known that bone is weaker
in shear than compression (28).
ILR. Our results were consistent with a previous study,
demonstrating similar resultant ILR between habitual RFS
and FFS runners in traditional footwear (2). In their study,
Boyer et al. (2) found a significantly lower vertical ILR
in FFS runners, but the resultant was similar due to higher
posterior and medial ILR. In our study, the component ILR
values were similar between foot strikes when running in
standard running footwear, with nonsignificantly lower verti-
cal ILR but higher posterior ILR contributing to a similar re-
sultant ILR. In the current study, runners who habitually use
minimal shoes and run with a FFS had lower component and
resultant load rates than runners using standard footwear with
either foot strike. This finding is likely due to an interaction of
footstrike pattern and footwear, as running with an RFS pat-
tern in minimal shoes results in higher load rates than in
standard shoes (20). Those who habitually run in full minimal
shoes had lower vertical and resultant load rates than those
who habitually run in partial minimal shoes. Additionally,
only those running in partial minimal shoes exhibited impact
peaks in their vertical ground reaction forces. This further
emphasizes the importance of footwear and suggests that
even being habituated to a small amount of cushioning can
lead to harder landings. To date, only the vertical ILR com-
ponent has been associated with injury in runners. However,

 the resultant warrants investigation because these load rates
are at least as high as the vertical ILR and represent the total
loading experienced by the body.
When running with an FFS, the foot contacts the ground
in a more plantarflexed (30) and inverted (2) position than
when running with a RFS. To achieve an FFS in standard
shoes, these characteristics may be exaggerated to overcome
both the heel height and lateral flare of the standard shoe that
are not present in a true minimal shoe. This may increase
both the braking and ML forces in early stance and could lead
to higher load rates. Furthermore, the midsole of a standard
shoe extends to the forefoot and provides additional cushion-
ing. Several studies have demonstrated that individuals land
harder when landing on cushioned surfaces (1,10,16).
Although the vertical load rate was lower in the SFFS
compared with the SRFS, this was not statistically different,
contrary to our hypothesis and to previous studies (2). The
current study identified the maximum load rate within the first
25% of stance, whereas previous studies used only the first
13% of stance (4,6,13,17,19,21,26,29). When assessing ver-
tical load rates within the first 13% of stance, our findings
also indicated significantly lower vertical ILR when running
with an FFS compared with an RFS. However, our findings
demonstrate that the time of peak vertical ILR ranged from
1.7% to 24.5% of stance when running with a FFS, thus the
maximum vertical load rate may not have been obtained in
previous studies including FFS runners.
Vertical ILR for FFS runners in both shoe conditions
demonstrated two local maxima, with the first local maxi-
mum being lower than the second. Boyer et al. (2) also found a
double peaked vertical ILR for the FFS group, however, they
found the second peak to be lower than the first. The source
of this second peak may be associated with the acceleration
of the remainder of the body_s mass throughout stance, after
the initial foot contact (5). The difference observed between
the present study and the study by Boyer et al. may be due
to the combining of MFS and FFS data in the previous study,
whereas our study included only FFS runners. Furthermore,
the study by Boyer et al. included competitive runners, whereas
our study included recreational runners. Both of these factors
likely influenced the acceleration of the remainder of the body_s
mass after foot impact. All other studies of FFS running,
because of the range over which they assessed load rates,
captured the first peak in vertical ILR, but not the second.
Therefore, they may have underestimated the true vertical
ILR during the loading phase of stance. Future studies of FFS
running should consider the maximum vertical ILR that oc-
curs throughout the first 25% of stance, rather than deter-
mining this according to the typical time of impact peak when
running with an RFS pattern.
This study has a number of strengths. First, including
runners in their habitual running conditions increases the
ecological validity of the results. Additionally, including an
assessment of resultant ILR provides information about the
total loading experienced by the body. Finally, extending the
range of stance over which ILR are assessed in FFS runners
improves the validity of the data. This study may have been
limited by the uneven distribution of gender between the
groups, although there is no evidence that this factor affects
impact loading. This observed difference may be interesting
in itself and warrants further investigation. Additionally,
although habitually running with a FFS pattern in a minimal
shoe resulted in lower load rates than in a standard shoe,
further studies are required to determine if these differences
are important in terms of injury.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study suggest that running with a FFS
pattern in standard shoes results in similar resultant load rates
as running with an RFS pattern in standard shoes. However,
resultant load rates are significantly lower when running with
an FFS pattern in minimal shoes. Preliminary analysis of the
minimal footwear group revealed that runners who are habit-
uated to full minimal shoes (no cushioning) have the lowest
impacts at landing. Additional studies are under way to further
examine these differences.
