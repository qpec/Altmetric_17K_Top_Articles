Abstract
Background: Abortion is a common medical procedure, yet its availability has become more limited across the United States
over the past decade. Women who do not know where to go for abortion care may use the internet to find abortion facility
information, and there appears to be more online searches for abortion in states with more restrictive abortion laws. While previous
studies have examined the distances women must travel to reach an abortion provider, to our knowledge no studies have used a
systematic online search to document the geographic locations and services of abortion facilities.
Objective: The objective of our study was to describe abortion facilities and services available in the United States from the
perspective of a potential patient searching online and to identify US cities where people must travel the farthest to obtain abortion
care.
Methods: In early 2017, we conducted a systematic online search for abortion facilities in every state and the largest cities in
each state. We recorded facility locations, types of abortion services available, and facility gestational limits. We then summarized
the frequencies by region and state. If the online information was incomplete or unclear, we called the facility using a mystery
shopper method, which simulates the perspective of patients calling for services. We also calculated distance to the closest abortion
facility from all US cities with populations of 50,000 or more.
Results: We identified 780 facilities through our online search, with the fewest in the Midwest and South. Over 30% (236/780,
30.3%) of all facilities advertised the provision of medication abortion services only; this proportion was close to 40% in the
Northeast (89/233, 38.2%) and West (104/262, 39.7%). The lowest gestational limit at which services were provided was 12
weeks in Wyoming; the highest was 28 weeks in New Mexico. People in 27 US cities must travel over 100 miles (160 km) to
reach an abortion facility; the state with the largest number of such cities is Texas (n=10).
Conclusions: Online searches can provide detailed information about the location of abortion facilities and the types of services
they provide. However, these facilities are not evenly distributed geographically, and many large US cities do not have an abortion
facility. Long distances can push women to seek abortion in later gestations when care is even more limited.

 Introduction
Women’s ability to determine if and when they get pregnant
and continue that pregnancy is key to their overall well-being.
Women who are denied wanted abortions experience some
negative outcomes compared with women who were able to
obtain abortions, including increased economic insecurity [1]
and continued exposure to violence from the man involved in
the pregnancy [2]. While abortion rates have declined slightly
in recent years, over 926,000 abortions were performed in the
United States in 2014 [3]. This rate is equivalent to 1 in 4 women
of reproductive age having an abortion within her lifetime [3],
which underscores that abortion is common.
The explanations for the decline in abortion rates are varied,
but part of this drop can likely be attributed to the decrease in
facilities at which women can obtain abortion care across the
United States over the past decade. Most abortions (95%) are
performed in specialized abortion clinics (rather than private
physicians’ offices or hospitals), and the number of these clinics
declined in half of US states from 2011 to 2014, with some
regions experiencing up to a 22% decrease [3]. Because 90%
of US counties do not have an abortion provider [3], many
women seeking abortion must travel outside their home counties
to obtain care. Other geographic disparities have been
documented: women living in rural areas, the South and Midwest
regions of the United States, and those seeking second-trimester
or later abortions are more likely to travel farther for services,
often 50 miles (80 km) or more one way [4-7]. These shifts in
the availability of abortion-providing facilities indicate that
women in underserved areas must travel increasingly far for
abortion care.
Somedecline in the number of abortion facilities may be due to
the more than 400 state laws regulating abortion that have been
adopted between 2011 and 2017 [8], which, among other
requirements, mandate that physicians have local hospital
admitting privileges, facilities have formal transfer agreements
with local hospitals, and facilities become ambulatory surgical
centers. These laws have likely led to the closure of facilities
that could not meet the financial or administrative requirements
imposed by these laws. For example, after these types of laws
were passed in Texas in 2013, the number of abortion facilities
decreased by 54% over 15 months, requiring women whose
nearest clinic had closed to travel 85 miles (137 km) one way
to a facility [9]. Additional analyses of trends in abortion rates
in Texas from 2012 to 2014 found a relationship between
increases in distance to the nearest abortion facility and
decreases in the county abortion rate [10]. Another analysis
from Louisiana estimated that, if admitting privileges laws were
to go into effect, 67% of women of reproductive age would live
more than 150 miles (241 km) from the nearest abortion facility,
thereby tripling the distance women have to travel to reach the
nearest facility for care [11,12]. With distance come increased
travel time, increased costs for transportation and childcare, lost
wages, the need to take time off of work or school, the need to
disclose the abortion to more people than desired, and overall
delays in care [13-15]. Ultimately, delays in reaching and
obtaining care can push women later into their pregnancies,
even up to the point that they might not be able to obtain a
wanted abortion, depending on the gestational limits on abortion
in their state [16].
To obtain abortion care in their communities, women who do
not know where to go may use the internet to find abortion
facility information [15]. Almost half (45%) of women seeking
abortion services at clinics in Nebraska located the abortion
clinic through an online search [17], and a recent study
documented an interest in information on self-abortion among
people searching online using the search engine Google [18].
Online searching for abortion information appears to be more
prevalent in states with restrictive abortion laws and where
abortion availability is limited, suggesting that women with
reduced access to abortion are more likely to seek out
information on abortion online [19,20].
We were interested in examining the question “What does the
current landscape of abortion facilities look like to women
searching online for abortion services?” There are no publicly
available systematically documented and comprehensive lists
of US abortion facilities, which makes it difficult to determine
how far women must travel to obtain these services. Considering
the trends in increased restrictions and decreasing numbers of
abortion-providing facilities, it is important to generate accurate
estimates of the distances women must travel to obtain abortion
services in order to demonstrate potential impacts of closures.
This study aimed to address this question by documenting the
location of and abortion services available at abortion facilities
identified through a systematic online search in all 50 US states
(and the District of Columbia) and then calculating travel
distances to these facilities from metropolitan areas with
populations of 50,000 or more.
Methods
Data Collection
We conducted a systematic online search for abortion facilities
using the Google (Google LLC), Bing (Microsoft Corporation),
and Yahoo (Oath Inc) search engines between February 22,
2017 and May 22, 2017. Although Google alone accounts for
a substantial portion of the market share in the United States
(87.5%), together the 3 search engines comprised 99.1% of the
total search engine market share as of February 2017 [21]. We
conducted a search with the keywords “Abortion clinic in
[state]” (no quotes) for all 50 states and the District of Columbia
in each of the 3 search engines. In addition, we searched all
cities (n=302) with populations over 100,000 based on 2015
US Census population estimates [22] using the keywords
“Abortion clinic in [city]” (no quotes). For states that had fewer
than 3 cities with populations over 100,000, we used the 3 most
populous cities from the same US Census source. We conducted
the keyword searches in Google’s Chrome browser on Incognito
mode and cleared the complete browsing history, including
cookies and other site data and cached images and files, prior
to each search. The researcher was logged into a Google account
created specifically for this study during the searches. We chose
keyword searches to reflect the natural language that women
would use to search for local abortion services.

 We assessed the first 20 results for each city for information on
abortion-providing facilities, similar to previous analyses of
search engine content [23,24], resulting in a review of a total
of 18,120 city results across all 3 search engines. To capture
the larger number of facilities expected in statewide searches,
we reviewed the first 30 results for each state (for a total review
of 4590 state results). For each result, we examined the website
for relevant information. If the website belonged to an abortion
facility, we included the result in our count of facilities and
recorded whether they provided medication abortion, or
aspiration or surgical abortion, as well as the facility gestational
limit. Some facilities noted on their websites that they offered
services beyond the gestational limit on a case-by-case basis;
however, we recorded the limit that each facility offered to all
patients seeking services. We included hospitals and clinics
associated with universities and medical schools through the
Ryan Residency Training Program in Abortion and Family
Planning [25] in the analysis if they provided information about
availability of abortion services on their website, even if they
did not come up in our systematic Web searches. If a website
did not provide information about a facility where abortion care
could be obtained or explicitly stated that they did not provide
abortion care, we excluded the facility. If the online information
was incomplete or unclear, we called the facility using a mystery
shopper method, which simulates the perspective of patients
calling for services [26]. With these calls, we verified that it
was not a crisis pregnancy center, confirmed that the facility
was open and providing abortion services, and obtained
additional information on its address, including state and zip
code, types of abortion services provided, and gestational limits.
Finally, because Planned Parenthood is the health care provider
most widely known to provide abortion services in the United
States, we reviewed all facilities listed by state on the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America website as a validity check
against the results from our systematic search. We confirmed
that all Planned Parenthood facilities providing abortion had
been captured by our searches. The study was approved by the
institutional review board of the University of California, San
Francisco.
Data Analysis
We described the number of facilities and the proportion of
facilities that offered medication abortion only, aspiration or
surgical abortion only, and both medication and aspiration or
surgical abortion in each state and region. We grouped states
by region and subregion based on US Census categories. The
latest gestational limit at which facilities offered aspiration or
surgical abortions was documented for each state. Using 2015
population estimates taken from 2010 US Census data [22], we
determined the number of women of reproductive age (15-49
years) per abortion facility in each state.
To calculate the cities farthest from an abortion-providing
facility, we defined cities based on the US Census’s data on
incorporated places of 50,000 or more [22], which amounted
to 758 cities. After removing those cities that had at least one
abortion provider, we calculated the distance from each city to
all the abortion facilities within the state and in any neighboring
or nearby states. For each city, we then took the minimum of
these distances to determine the closest provider. We calculated
distances in Stata 14 (StataCorp LLC) using the traveltime3
command, which uses a Google Maps application programming
interface to calculate driving distances in miles and time.
Mapping was performed in Redivis, a Stanford University-based
online visualization platform. Rather than using Euclidean
(straight-line) distance, Redivis uses road network information,
including road type and corresponding average speed, sourced
from OpenStreetMap [27] to implement a cost-distance
algorithm to predict distance-access to abortion facilities.
Results
Distribution and Characteristics of Abortion Facilities
in the United States
We identified 780 abortion facilities in the United States. The
distribution of abortion facilities was not uniform across states.
The largest numbers of facilities were in the Northeast and the
West. California had the highest number of facilities (n=152),
while Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South
Dakota, and West Virginia had 1 facility each. The geographic
region with the highest ratio of women of reproductive age to
facility was the Midwest, with 165,886 women per abortion
facility (Table 1). The Northeast had the lowest ratio (55,662:1).
While population density is not distributed evenly across all
regions, the subregions with the highest ratios were the West
South Central and East South Central subregions, with 298,733
and 288,463 women per facility, respectively. The state with
the highest ratio of women to facility was Missouri, with
1,365,575 women per facility, and the lowest was in Maine,
with 13,905 women per facility.
Most facilities reported providing both medication and aspiration
or surgical abortion, although the proportion of facilities that
provided different types of abortion care also varied by region
and state. Over 30% (236/780, 30.3%) of all the facilities
reported on their websites that they only provided medication
abortion (Table 2), while 65.4% (510/780) provided both
medication and aspiration or surgical abortion. Very few offered
just aspiration or surgical abortion.
The South region had the highest proportion of facilities offering
both medication abortion and aspiration or surgical abortion
(169/193, 87.6%). While the Northeast and West had many
more facilities overall, almost 40% of facilities in each of these
regions offered medication abortion only (89/233, 38.2%; and
104/262, 39.7%, respectively). When looking at subregion, New
England (34/74, 45.9%) and Pacific (87/207, 42.0%) had even
greater proportions of facilities offering medication abortion
only.
The highest gestational limit advertised by facilities also varied
by state, subregion, and region (Table 2). The states with the
lowest advertised gestation for abortions were Wyoming (12
weeks) and Indiana and South Dakota (both 13 weeks and 6
days), and the lowest subregions were West North Central in
the Midwest and East South Central in the South, with limits
of 22 weeks. Among all facilities, 50.9% (397/780) provided
abortion services at 14 weeks or later and 26.5% (207/780)
provided services at 20 weeks or later.

cInformation obtained in early 2017, and as of September 22, 2017, may no longer be accurate as a result of state laws or staffing changes.
dOne facility in Texas listed the gestational limit on their website as <24 weeks; this was likely an error, as at the time of data collection, Texas had
restrictions on abortion services after 22 weeks.
Abortion Deserts
We identified 27 “abortion deserts,” cities from which people
would have to travel over 100 miles (160 km) to reach an
abortion facility (Table 3). People living in Rapid City, SD had
to travel the farthest, 318 miles (512 km), to reach an abortion
facility. Although the most cities in any one state (n=10) were
located in Texas, there was a wide geographic diversity, with
15 unique states represented. These states were overwhelmingly
in the South and Midwest. Figure 1 shows the geographic
distribution of these distances, where large areas of the Midwest
and Southwest had no abortion facility.

 Figure 1. Distance to nearest abortion facility in the contiguous United States, May 2017.
Discussion
Principal Results
Using an online search method, we identified almost 800
abortion facilities in the United States, which is consistent with
other estimates of abortion clinics and nonspecialized clinics
providing abortion [3]. These facilities were not distributed
proportionately by state population. Through our analysis, we
also found that 27 US cities, largely in the Midwest and the
South, could be characterized as abortion deserts, as they did
not have a publicly advertised abortion facility within 100 miles
(160 km). These findings are consistent with those published
by Bearak and colleagues [6], who found that the US counties
where women would have to travel the farthest to reach the
nearest abortion clinic were concentrated in the middle of the
country, as well as several metropolitan areas in Texas. The
lack of access to a common reproductive health service such as
abortion is a public health concern in that more women in these
cities could be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term if
they are unable to travel long distances to obtain abortion care.
As states continue to pass, implement, and defend restrictions
on abortion [8], it is possible that the number of abortion
facilities will continue to decrease in those states with the most
restrictions. The 6 states that have only 1 abortion facility have
combined populations of almost 4 million women of
reproductive age who will be forced to travel out of their home
state to access abortion care if those facilities close.
For people seeking abortion services in the cities characterized
as abortion deserts and in states with few facilities, reaching a
facility for care could be incredibly challenging. Access to
transportation is a barrier for people seeking all types of health
care, in both urban and rural settings [28]. Lower-income women
who are unable to access a car or money for gas may have to
travel by bus, train, or other forms of transportation, which also
becomes more difficult the farther they have to travel. Delays
in care due to distance or transportation can push women seeking
abortion to later gestations [16,29,30] and are likely to
disproportionately affect low-income women, who may struggle
to cover the cost of transport [11,14]. Delays to abortion care
may be particularly crucial to women in Wyoming, Alaska,
Indiana, South Dakota, and South Carolina, where the abortion
facilities had the lowest gestational limits. We found that 26.5%
of identified facilities performed abortions at 20 weeks or later,
which is lower than estimates from 2011-2012 [31], perhaps
due to an increased number of state restrictions on abortion after
20 weeks since those estimates were published.
It seems likely that the larger number of facilities in the
Northeast and West can be attributed to the fact that 40% to
50% of identified facilities in those regions are offering
medication abortion only. The high proportion of facilities
offering only medication abortion reflects the opportunities
provided by medication abortion: the skills required for
clinicians to provide it are minimal (compared with aspiration
or surgical abortion) and the large majority of abortions in the
United States (80.5%) occur at or before 10 weeks’ gestation
(the current accepted limit by which medication abortion can
be provided) [32]. While the proportion of women choosing
this method of abortion now accounts for 31% of nonhospital
abortions (compared with 6% in 2001) [3], it is difficult to
determine what the true demand would be if both medication
and aspiration abortion were equally available. However, in
states such as California, where fewer barriers to access exist
for both types of abortion, medication abortion is now up to
46% of abortions in some populations, such as Medicaid
recipients [33]. Additionally, states in the Northeast and West
are less likely to have laws that limit the provision of medication
abortion to physicians [34] and more likely to have policies that
allow nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and
physicians assistants to offer medication abortion as part of their
scope of practice.

 These findings underscore the opportunities to pursue
geographic expansion and other innovative models to achieve
more equitable access to abortion care [35]. Some states have
already managed this through an expansion of medication
abortion-only services and increased use of telemedicine, which
has been demonstrated to be safe and acceptable to women and
to decrease travel for patients [36]. Indeed, in this analysis,
Maine had the lowest ratio of women of reproductive age per
facility, which was likely the result of an expansion of
medication abortion through telemedicine programs offered
from the existing Maine facilities [37]. While 19 states (almost
exclusively in the South and Midwest) effectively prohibit
telemedicine medication abortion [34], a recent Iowa Supreme
Court decision could have implications for other states
challenging similar restrictions that would allow expansion of
medication abortion provision [38]. Given that it is less resource
intensive, existing health care providers in the Midwest and the
South, particularly in states where there is only 1 abortion
provider or those states that contain cities classified as abortion
deserts, could consider filling gaps in access by offering
medication abortion alone as an entry point into abortion care,
especially for primary care providers. Expanding the types of
providers who can offer aspiration and medication abortion,
such as nurse practitioners, would also increase the number of
providers in smaller urban areas, thus expanding access to care
[39]. However, it is important to note that in some states in
which half or more facilities are only providing medication
abortion, such as Idaho and Wyoming, the other facilities in the
state offer abortion care up to 16 weeks and 12 weeks,
respectively. Simply increasing the availability of medication
abortion would not meet the needs of all women seeking
abortion, some of whom may prefer aspiration abortion or need
later abortion.
Supportive policy related to transportation for reproductive
health services could also help reduce the burden on women in
abortion deserts who have to travel extended distances to access
services. California has recently introduced a Medicaid benefit
to provide transportation for reproductive health care services
(including abortion) to enrollees [40]. Further research is needed
to determine what other policies can be enacted to reduce
burdens of transportation and distance.
The internet will likely continue to be a key place for people to
obtain the locations of abortion-providing facilities. However,
both reduced geographic access and a desire to have more
privacy and autonomy around the abortion process may lead
women to seek out information on self-abortion [18] and obtain
medication abortion pills through online sources, many of which
have recently been shown to be selling effective medications
with delivery to US-based mailing addresses [41]. There are no
accurate estimates of how many women are obtaining abortion
pills online, but the existence of online marketplaces and the
documented feasibility of ordering from them implies online
purchasing is occurring at volume.
Strengths and Limitations
This study is unique in that it systematically documented what
people searching for abortion services online would find in
search engine listings in early 2017 from a patient-centered
perspective. A strength of this study is that it used up-to-date
information on facilities of any volume to calculate distances,
while other recent studies have been limited to a 2014 iteration
of 
a 
proprietary 
database 
of 
only 
high-volume
abortion-providing facilities (>400 abortions per year) that the
Guttmacher Institute maintains [3,6]. An additional strength of
the study is that it did not include abortion providers that offer
abortion only to their existing patients or those that do not
advertise their services, which would distort an accurate
portrayal of the visibility of abortion availability. In addition,
this analysis included the maximum gestations at which
abortions were provided in each state, regardless of the state
laws.
However, this study also has limitations. We used search terms
that would enable us to locate abortion facilities in specific cities
and states, but someone seeking abortion care might search
“abortion clinic near me” and their results could vary from ours
based on the location they are searching from. We attempted to
eliminate geolocation bias by searching in Incognito mode and
clearing both cache and cookies after each search. The
information provided here is limited to what women seeking
services would encounter—information that facilities chose to
make available on their websites and provided through mystery
shopper calls. Website information may be inaccurate or updated
infrequently. It is possible that, if a woman called a facility to
describe her unique situation, the staff could provide her with
information about additional services that they do not wish to
list on their website.
Distance is not the only barrier that people may face in trying
to access abortion services—they may also face abortion stigma,
waiting periods [13], and state gestational limits [16,42] as a
result of state-level restrictions. In addition, the abortion facility
that is closest to where a woman lives may not meet all her
needs, particularly if it only provides medication abortion, has
low limits on the gestation at which it provides abortion care,
or cannot serve women with health conditions who may have
higher risks.
Conclusions
Online searches provide information about abortion facilities
and their services. The locations of these providers are not
distributed equitably geographically across the United States.
Having to travel long distances for abortion care can
disproportionately affect low-income women and potentially
push women to seek abortion at later gestations when care is
even less available. Travel burdens may exist in addition to
other restrictions on abortion in the state, including waiting
periods and gestational limits, which can exacerbate inequities
in the ability to access abortion care as part of the full range of
reproductive health services.
