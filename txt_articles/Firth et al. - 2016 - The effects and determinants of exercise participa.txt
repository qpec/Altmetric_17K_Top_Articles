Abstract
Background: Previous qualitative studies have found that exercise may facilitate symptomatic and functional
recovery in people with long-term schizophrenia. This study examined the perceived effects of exercise as
experienced by people in the early stages of psychosis, and explored which aspects of an exercise intervention
facilitated or hindered their engagement.
Methods: Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with early intervention service users who had
participated in a 10-week exercise intervention. Interviews discussed people’s incentives and barriers to exercise,
short- and long-term effects, and opinions on optimal interventions. A thematic analysis was applied to determine
the prevailing themes.
Results: The intervention was perceived as beneficial and engaging for participants. The main themes were
(a) exercise alleviating psychiatric symptoms, (b) improved self-perceptions following exercise, and (c) factors
determining exercise participation, with three respective sub-themes for each.
Conclusions: Participants explained how exercise had improved their mental health, improved their confidence and
given them a sense of achievement. Autonomy and social support were identified as critical factors for effectively
engaging people with first-episode psychosis in moderate-to-vigorous exercise. Implementing such programs in early
intervention services may lead to better physical health, symptom management and social functioning among service
users.

Background
People with schizophrenia typically have poor physical
fitness and lower levels of physical activity than general
population [1, 2]. This is linked to the elevated rates of
obesity, cardio-metabolic diseases and premature mor-
tality observed within this patient group [3]. Further-
more,
physical
inactivity
and
poor
fitness
bears
particularly strong relationships with negative symptoms
and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia [1, 4], which
strongly impair functional recovery and yet often remain
untreated.
Exercise
offers
a
possible
adjunctive
intervention
which may improve both physical and mental health
outcomes in schizophrenia. A recent systematic review
and meta-analysis found that 90 min of moderate-to-
vigorous activity per week can increase fitness, reduce
positive and negative symptoms and improve cognition
[5]. The qualitative literature has also shed light on how
exercise may have these effects. Two separate reviews,
each including between 11 and 13 qualitative studies,
found that vigorous exercise can draw attention away
from auditory hallucinations and/or adverse beliefs that
people with long-term schizophrenia may have, and help

 them to ‘reconnect with reality’ by focusing on physical
exertion [6, 7]. Furthermore, exercise may improve nega-
tive symptoms and real-world functioning through pro-
viding a valued, sociable activity with achievable and
rewarding goals [6, 7].
Despite the
clear benefits, adherence to exercise
among people with schizophrenia is lower than other
patient groups [8]. However, interventions which use
supervised exercise have better rates of retention [8].
Additionally, interventions which accommodate indi-
vidual preferences, through offering different types of
exercise, have previously resulted in higher rates of
exercise
adherence among long-term schizophrenia
patients [9, 10].
This is congruent with qualitative research which
shows that patients feel that individualised support can
overcome many of the barriers faced by people with
schizophrenia, and facilitate exercise engagement [6, 7].
The qualitative literature has also provided insight into
why people with schizophrenia often fail to achieve ad-
equate amounts of exercise. For example, symptoms of
paranoia and anxiety are barriers to attending exercise
facilities, while amotivation and body-image issues can
deter people from physically engaging [6].
However, all previous qualitative research has sampled
patients who are receiving treatment for long-term
schizophrenia. The experiences of exercise among youn-
ger patients within an ‘Early Intervention for Psychosis’
(EIP) service has yet to be explored. This is a pertinent
area of enquiry, since early psychosis is a time when
interventions which target negative and cognitive symp-
toms may maximize functional recovery [11]. It is also a
‘critical period’ for physical health interventions to
prevent cardio-metabolic disorders from arising [12]. Pa-
tients themselves may feel more able to engage with
exercise when they are at a younger age, with a lower
BMI and in the absence of metabolic disorders [13].
Preliminary research has indicated that increasing
physical activity and fitness during the first-episode of
psychosis (FEP) can improve physical health and support
functional recovery [14–16]. In a recent feasibility trial
(the “iBeep” study) of an exercise intervention delivered
through EIP services for patients with FEP, significant
improvements were observed in cardio-metabolic health,
positive and negative symptoms and cognitive function-
ing after just 10 weeks [17]. Additionally, adherence and
retention rates were substantially higher than in previous
exercise trials in schizophrenia [8, 17], perhaps due to
the nature of the intervention applied, or certain charac-
teristics of the first-episode sample.
We conducted a qualitative study of patients who had
participated in the iBeep trial. The aim of this investiga-
tion was to explore the perceived benefits of exercise as
experienced by people with FEP, and to establish the
barriers and facilitating factors for increasing physical
activity in this patient group. These findings could in-
form the development of future studies, and the imple-
mentation of exercise interventions within EIP services.
Methods
Ethics, consent and permissions
This study was conducted as the qualitative section of
the iBeep (‘Investigating the Benefits of Exercise in Early
Psychosis’) feasibility trial [17], which was approved by
the North West Research Ethics Committee on 18/12/
2013 (REC# 13/NW/0784) and registered with the
current clinical trials database (ISRCTN: 09150095). Par-
ticipants were recruited from EIP services in Greater
Manchester, UK. In the United Kingdom, EIP services
are currently offered to any individual aged 14–35 who
are experiencing FEP, defined as full threshold psychotic
symptoms for a period of greater than 7 consecutive
days, regardless of formal diagnostic status. Additionally,
diagnoses given during the early stages of illness are sus-
ceptible to change [18]. Therefore, no restrictions were
placed on patients’ diagnosis in this study, in order to
assess exercise as an intervention for FEP more broadly,
and inform its implementation within EIP services.
Inclusion criteria were: (1) currently receiving care for
FEP as a service user of EIP services; (2) aged 18 – 35;
(3) experiencing some psychological difficulties, defined
as having either a score of ≥2 on the WHO Disability
Assessment Schedule 2.0 [19] or ≥21 on the Beck
Depression Inventory 2.0 [20]. Exclusion criteria were
inability to provide informed consent, pregnancy, phys-
ical health issues which are a contraindication to exer-
cise (as assessed by the referring clinician), and/or
insufficient command of English to complete baseline
assessments. All referrals were screened against inclu-
sion criteria using a telephone interview. Eligible service
users were then met in person to provide written in-
formed consent.
Intervention
Each participant received a 10-week individualised exer-
cise training programme, which aimed to achieve ≥90 min
of moderate-to-vigorous activity each week [17]. All inter-
ventions
were delivered
through ‘community
leisure
schemes’ within service users’ localities. Such schemes are
now commonplace throughout the UK and offer highly
discounted gym memberships and sports facilities to any-
one referred by health services.
During the intervention period, participants were of-
fered gym training sessions twice per week at their local
leisure centres. These were supervised by research assis-
tants, either on a 1-to-1 basis or in small groups of 2–3
participants. Research assistants had no formal exercise
qualifications but did have several years of exercise

 experience. Their role was to facilitate exercise adher-
ence through arranging gym memberships, accompany-
ing participants to gym sessions and recording their
training. A standardised training plan was developed in
line with recommendations from exercise physiologist
JM, and used as a guide for exercise sessions, consisting
of combination of aerobic and resistance exercise activ-
ities (See Additional file 1; Aerobic-resistance training
plan for IBEEP). However, the specific content of each
session
was
tailored
toward
participant
preference.
Mandatory gym inductions were also provided by the
personal trainers at community leisure centres (who
were available for further support throughout the dur-
ation of the intervention).
Qualitative interviews
Informants for the qualitative section were selected on the
basis of availability while aiming to obtain a “maximum
variation sample” [21] of men and women, older and
younger participants, full compliers and non-adherers.
Participants were interviewed on a one-to-one basis. Inter-
views took place either immediately after the intervention,
or 6-months after the supervised training period had sub-
sided. These two time-points were used in order to obtain
additional perspectives from participants following the
withdrawal of supervised training, thus providing a more
complete understanding of exercise adherence, benefits,
and barriers experienced by patients over time.
All interviews used topic guides which contained open
ended questions about participant experiences and opin-
ions of exercise, and were conducted between June 2014
and March 2015. To minimize response bias, interviews
were conducted by different research assistants to those
who supervised the exercise sessions. However, due to
unavailability of research assistants at follow-up, some
interviews were conducted by the same person who had
previously supervised participants’ exercise. Nonetheless,
this only occurred for five of 19 total interviews, each of
which was conducted 6 months after the intervention
had finished, thus limiting potential impact on findings.
Data analysis
The current study pre-specified several areas of interest
for analysis, determined on basis of existing qualitative
literature around exercise and schizophrenia [6, 7]. These
areas included; possible reasons for exercising; short- and
long-term effects of exercise; barriers/facilitating factors
towards exercise participation. A thematic analysis was
used to determine the key themes from participants’ dia-
logue on these topics, through applying the five stages of
qualitative analysis [22]:
(i)
transcripts were read and re-read to familiarize the
researcher with the data
(ii) a range of codes were generated to index common
features across interviewees
(iii) these initial codes were examined to determine
prevalent themes
(iv) themes were reviewed for internal homogeneity
and external heterogeneity, to combine similar
themes into overarching themes and draw coherent
links or distinctions between them [21]
(v) the overarching themes were firmly defined,
organized in relation to their collated data
extracts, and then analysed for sub-themes.
Interpretive rigor
To reduce the risk of bias, the prominence of over-
arching themes and their respective sub-themes was
determined through discussion between three of the
authors,
who
had
transcribed
the
interviews
and
reviewed all coded quotations for each theme. To val-
idate the findings, first hand quotes are presented
word-for-word within the Results and Table 1, follow-
ing removal of non-specific interjections [23].
Results
The clinical and demographic characteristics of partic-
ipants are displayed in Table 1, which shows that in-
terviewees were broadly representative of the entire
‘iBeep’ sample. A total of 19 interviews were con-
ducted; nine immediately after the 10-week interven-
tion and a further ten at 6-month follow-up. Six
participants were interviewed at both time points.
The mean level of exercise achieved by these partici-
pants
during
the
intervention
was
119
min
of
moderate-to-vigorous exercise per-week for 10 weeks
(s.d. 74 mins), primarily in the form of individualised
gym
training.
Three
overarching
themes
emerged
from the thematic analysis. These were: (a) exercise
alleviating psychiatric symptoms (b) improved self-
perceptions from exercise, and (c) factors determining
exercise participation. To accurately represent the en-
tirety of participants’ dialogue, one exemplar quote
for each theme has been featured in Results (selected
through mutual agreement between authors), with
three additional examples in Table 2.
(A) Exercise alleviating psychiatric symptoms
Participants generally felt that exercise was capable
of providing acute relief for psychiatric symptoms.
These effects varied across participants. Some
reported relief from positive symptoms (i.e.
auditory hallucinations and paranoia) and others
for negative symptoms (amotivation and
anhedonia). This seemed to depend on which
aspects of psychosis characterised the individual’s
current condition.
Firth et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:36 
Page 3 of 9
 (A1) Positive symptoms
Participants described how the physical
demands of exercise temporarily subdued
positive symptoms, by helping them to direct
their thoughts away from intrusive voices,
delusions and/or paranoia:
P005: “Well with psychosis, which is partly what I
suffer from, I hear the voices and stuff like that.
But when I’m training, the voices are suppressed, cos
I’m so concentrated on lifting that weight up, doing the
next exercise, that everything else clears out of your
head.”
(A2) Overcoming negative symptoms and depression
Exercising was also beneficial for negative
symptoms and depression, reportedly helping
people to overcome feelings of low energy,
low mood and amotivation.
P006: “it makes me more active, before I was lazy
and couldn’t be bothered doing things. But now it’s
like I’m more active and I just want to go out
there and start going to the gym… Got my get up
and go back!”
Furthermore, comments about this were often
tied to feelings of exercise acting directly on
one’s mood state through stimulating the
production of neurological chemicals or
‘endorphins’:
P002: “I always get them bad days but when I go
the gym, like I said, physical exercise, it lets
endorphins off in your brain doesn’t it. So even if
you are a bit depressed it can erm make you not
depressed, [laughs] or make you slightly more
happy.”
(A3) Supporting psychological well-being
Participants explained how these immediate
effects of exercise provided a sense of well-
being and freedom from mental health
problems. This could have an enduring impact
on the rest of one’s day, reducing usual feelings
of disturbance, stress and/or despair.
P009: “…I’d notice, after I’d done the gym sessions, I
felt really fresh. Like afterwards like my mind felt kind
of washed, if you like.”
(B) Improved self-perceptions following exercise
(B1) Overall confidence
While engaging in exercise was associated
with transitory relief from mental health
issues, the long-term benefits of exercise
participation were more strongly related to
improved self-perceptions. This was described
as an increased confidence, stemming from
greater self-efficacy and self-esteem.
P003: “I think people can benefit from it - to get
fitter and healthier - Get more confidence and
self-esteem.”
(B2) Benefits extending to other areas of life
Improvements in confidence were often
directly linked to physical changes, in terms
of feeling fitter, healthier and/or obtaining a
better body image. Others described exercise
as providing a supportive platform for
improving social confidence. In both cases,
the increased confidence gained from
exercising positively affected other areas.
P007: “if you can learn and do things in the gym, then
you can do it anywhere outside and, you know, you
can get other people involved as well. And er it
definitely helps your lifestyle you know - it improves
your lifestyle.”

(A) Exercise alleviating psychiatric symptoms
(A1) Reducing positive symptoms
P011: “It’s like, when I’m doing the weights or I’m running, I don’t sit there and think
about the voices or what they’re saying, I just think ‘yeah let’s do it!”
P006: “All your mental issues are going to go away because once you’re concentrating
on picking up weights and doing exercise. Then your mind goes somewhere else.”
P008: “It makes you calmer when exercising. It gives you a fresh mind. If you have got
any worries then just it’ll go away.”
(A2) Overcoming negative symptoms and depression
P012: “I felt the change, emotional changes, you know what I mean, that I was like
flooded with chemicals if you will, like made me feel good by myself”
P007: “I think more energetic a bit more enthusiastic kind of thing. Yeah more up for
doing things which I probably normally wouldn’t do”
P004: “More energetic, feeling happier, makes you feel a lot happier I think. Erm you
feel motivated to do things - and energetic.”
(A3) Supporting psychological well-being
P006: “Go and exercise you’ll feel you’ll feel your minds gone free. And you’re stress
free. You’ll get all your worries to go away, cos you’re concentrating on something else”
P005: “A lot of people don’t understand how much exercise helps. But if I didn’t do
exercise I’d be in a lot worse place than what I am right now cos at times when I feel
like I’m just so angry, and stuff like that, I’ve gone training, I’ve done press ups and
stuff at home and it’s cleared my head, killed me anger and you feel better for it…”
P003: “Yeah, makes you happier really. I don’t know really, just when you’ve done it
you’re buzzing aren’t you.”
(B) Improved self-perceptions from exercise
(B1) Overall confidence
P002: “Has a big err, a big big er, has a big effect on all of it. It makes me feel more
happy in myself, you know, more confident, more self erm… [esteem], you know,
believe in myself better, a lot more.”
P012: “once you once you go gym and that after a while you start feeling good about
yourself. You start walking round like yeah I’m getting big and do you know what I
mean type thing.”
P011: “I love it. It’s just like, thinking yeah, I couldn’t do this 4 months ago, now look
at me doing it comfortably. Let’s throw it up a gear!”
(B2) Benefits extending to other areas of life
P001: “I feel good knowing that I’ve lost weight. I’m really excited and proud of meself
that I’ve lost weight…Erm I go out with my friends more and they are like proud of
me because they know I’ve lost weight because they know about me wanting to lose
it and they have been very supportive as well.”
P005: “it’s a lot better when you start doing it and like I said you gain that confidence
up and you think you just think to yourself I can do this. I’m training and, er give me
another year year of doing this I think I’ll be ready to go back to work…and you’ll be
nervous getting a job interview or anything, like anyone would, but you’ll go in with
your confidence that you gained from going from doing your exercise. And when er
like people from interviews see that, you work hard in the gym or something like that
they’ll look at you and they’ll think well this guy’s got quite good confidence.”
P009: “My head felt a bit better after I’d done the exercise, like it was easier to do uni
work and…. I dunno my head just felt a lot clearer.”
(B3) Sense of achievement
P002:” Yeah I feel like I’ve achieved summat I feel like you know a lot better in myself
I feel like, I should do this every day”
P005: And you think yeah I feel good, and erm especially if you got somebody with
you you know you’ll have it all out that were a good session that and then you’ll go
you’ll sit down or you go home you’ll turn your xbox on or you do your house
cleaning or something like that and then when you’re going to bed you think I had
a good day today
P012: “For me…it’s not so much as like putting weight on or losing weight or it was
just that feel good factor that I enjoyed…I used to look forward to going to the gym
for that particular reason you know to make me feel good and that.”
Firth et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:36 
Page 5 of 9
 (B3) Sense of achievement
People also received an immediate boost
from a ‘sense of achievement’ associated
with completing exercise sessions. This was
a highly prevalent experience, reported by
almost all.
P010: “Just lifts your spirits I think when you’ve done it
and just makes you feel like you’ve achieved a goal in a
day when you go to the gym and if you go swimming
or…Definitely lifts it yeah, bit of exercise does.”
(C) Factors determining exercise participation
(C1) Acceptability of individualised exercise training
Overall, participants’ achieved more than
satisfactory amounts of exercise during their
10-week programmes. We found that the
exercise offered (most often personalised gym
training) was acceptable and desirable among
people with first-episode psychosis. From
the interviews, it was apparent that flexible,
individualised interventions ensure that
exercise is enjoyed, and thus adhered to by
participants.
P004: “…it’s very important in drawing the
individual towards making their own choice,
because it is about choice. They can make a choice
in what they want to do, and what they love to do,
it motivates them to sort of do what they feel
happy to do.”
(C2) Importance of a training partner
Another emergent sub-theme was the
perception of exercise as an inherently
social activity. A central aspect of the ‘iBeep’
intervention was the provision of a research
assistant to facilitate exercise on either
an individual or small-groups basis (2–3
participants). This was found to be highly
effective, perhaps essential, for encouraging
attendance and promoting engagement with
exercise.
The only recurrent criticism of ‘iBeep’ was
the relatively short length of the intervention
(10 weeks), with participants unanimously
stating that a longer (or permanent) period
of supervised exercise sessions would have
been preferred. Furthermore, participants’
suggestions for further and/or alternative
exercise interventions all involved some level
of social support, such as; personal trainers,
‘service user friendly’ exercise groups, or
learning how to train with friends.
Table 2 Additional examples of content within each qualitative sub-theme (Continued)
(C) Factors determining participation
(C1) Acceptability of individualised routines
P003: “It was good that we got to choose something out of like a list. We could have
done all different things… I thought the options were quite good. But I would have
like to have done boxercise as well.”
P007: yeah let them try all the different er materials out there in the gym um different
weights machines, definitely they will fit into something that they like yeah
P004: “I think it’s er finding what they enjoy what they love to do… And if you can
maybe, er, assess what type of exercise would be desirable um then, er, I’m sure they
they’re more likely to exercise”
(C2) Importance of a training partner
P006: “It wasn’t just him [the trainer] standing and shouting at you. He was like
persuading us on like ‘come on you can do it, you can do it!’ when he says things
like that it makes me more activate.”
P005: “[You’ve] got someone there also who’s basically saying, ‘it’s alright I’m here.
I’ll show you what you need to learn’ and once like the 6 months is over they’ve got
that extra bit of confidence to say I’ll give it a go on me own.”
P010: “Yeah definitely I think group work group exercising gets you more motivated
than…Whereas if you’re going on your own you don’t really motivate yourself
especially this time of year as well.”
(C3) Overcoming anxiety and motivational barriers
P001: “…if you go on your own you like don’t know somebody and you feel dead
shy and timid and stuff like that, whereas if you go with somebody you’re chatting
as you’re swimming or on bikes or at gym or something the time passes and stuff.”
P002: “They push you to do more than you would and if you’re on your own you
might just say oh well I’m not really bothered, but if someone’s with you they’ll they’ll
push you to do more they’ll push you to go.”
P004: “What really gave me the confidence to go, because the err, we had to work in
sort of a group, so we worked in a group and did some sets and stuff, so that was
really good. It made me feel a lot secure.”
Firth et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:36 
Page 6 of 9
 P001: “It’s just summat’ I want to do and it’s just a bit
of support and more encouragement to do it. And I
got the encouragement and the support, so I did it.
(C3) Barriers towards exercise
Barriers towards exercise fell into two
categories. The most frequently mentioned
was anxiety within the exercise environment.
This was often related to social anxiety, or a
lack of exercise efficacy. The second was
feelings of low motivation, which dissuaded
some participants from initiating exercise
alone. However, this was never described as
apathy towards exercise itself, as they still
perceived exercise as beneficial and congruent
with personal goals. Instead, participants
expressed how generalized amotivation could
become a psychological obstacle towards
initiating any activity, even those which they
valued and enjoyed. Nevertheless, the
feedback showed that having an experienced
and enthusiastic trainer can overcome both
amotivation and anxiety:
P012: “It’s just good to have a partner you know
mentally it’s good having a partner. You know what I
mean; when you go out there on your own you just
feel like, you know, like you really need somebody to
come with you I suppose.”
Discussion
This study examined the experiences of exercise among
people with first-episode psychosis who had recently
participated in a 10-week intervention. A thematic ana-
lysis showed exercise could provide relief for partici-
pants’ positive symptoms along with improving their
energy levels and mood. Social aspects of exercise also
emerged as overarching themes, in terms of (i) long-
term benefits of exercise participation, and (ii) ideal
types of support required. The findings are consistent
with qualitative studies of exercise in people with long-
term schizophrenia [6, 7]. They are also congruent with
quantitative data from the ‘iBeep’ study, which found sig-
nificant reductions in participants’ positive and negative
symptoms after the exercise intervention, as measured
by the PANSS [17].
Exercise as an intervention for first-episode psychosis
The positive symptoms of psychosis can be indications
of a ‘loss of contact with reality’ [24]. People with long-
term schizophrenia have previously described how exer-
cise provides a platform to reconnect with a reality, thus
helping to detach from these symptoms [25–27]. Our
study
replicated
these
findings
in
the
first-episode
sample; participants similarly described how exercise can
inhibit auditory hallucinations and intrusive thoughts, as
a consequence of physical exertion demanding their full
attention. Exercise was also perceived as energizing and
uplifting, making participants feel more enthusiastic
about other aspects of life. This may be linked to physio-
logical responses to exercise, as participants reported a
rush or ‘feel good’ effect immediately after their sessions.
Therefore, exercise offer a destigmatising, empowering
and natural method for overcoming negative symptoms
in early psychosis, which are usually unresponsive to
antipsychotic treatment [28].
As the benefits of exercise for psychiatric symptoms
were often tied to the physical activity itself, rather than
just the social aspects, it is important to provide activities
which allow for sufficient levels of exercise-intensity.
While low-intensity activities (e.g. walking, stretching)
may
have
other therapeutic
benefits,
moderate-to-
vigorous exercise may be optimal for people with
psychosis, as it would occupy enough attentional re-
sources to subdue voices/delusions, while also physiolo-
gically stimulating the body to release neurobiological
chemicals known to enhance mood [29]. This is supported
by a recent meta-analysis, which found that the symptoms
of schizophrenia are only reduced significantly by exercise
interventions which implement at least moderately intense
exercise [5]. Future randomised trials should aim to spe-
cify the mechanisms of exercise as an intervention for FEP
using time-and-attention control conditions, in order to
separate the physiological effects of vigorous physical
activity from the social support provided during the
intervention.
Moderately difficult or ‘challenging’ exercise has the
added benefit of providing an immediate sense of
achievement. Participants experienced this upon com-
pleting their sessions, and described how this led to im-
proved self-perceptions overtime. For instance, many
participants explained how achieving their goals in the
exercise setting had increased their self-efficacy and con-
fidence for other areas of life, which may help to im-
prove psychosocial functioning.
Overcoming barriers using individualised exercise
training
Participants discussed how sufficient levels of exercise
can be attained by tailoring programmes to individual
needs, thus facilitating physical exertion through intrin-
sically rewarding activities. Early psychosis may be an
ideal time to implement this, when patients are younger,
fitter, and less likely to have cardio-metabolic diseases,
which may act as a barrier towards exercise [13, 30].
Among our participants, barriers were mostly related to
anxiety, rather than the physical health complaints often
mentioned by long-term patients [30].

 Additionally, motivational barriers were not attributed
to reduced interest in exercise, but rather as generalized
amotivation obstructing their engagement with positive
activities. Crucially, these barriers were readily overcome
through the intervention, with participants achieving
107 min of moderate-to-vigorous activity per week on
average [17]. Thus, both the qualitative and quantitative
data shows individualised exercise interventions can
feasibly achieve sufficient moderate-to-vigorous activity
for people with early psychosis.
Providing structured advice is insufficient for over-
coming barriers towards exercise [31]. Instead, social
support was consistently identified as the crucial facilita-
tor of exercise engagement – as is found in long-term
schizophrenia [32–34]. Participants described how the
provision of a ‘training partner’ moved them from feel-
ing willing but unable to exercise, to readily achieving
substantial amounts of activity each week. This is likely
because a training partner can effectively address both of
the most prominent barriers towards exercise (anxiety
and amotivation), through providing reassurance or
prompting as required.
Research assistants who supervised exercise in this
study were not qualified personal trainers, but were fa-
miliar with gym-based training. This suggests that such
interventions could be delivered by any mental health
support staff with personal exercise experience. Add-
itional exercise support was available from the qualified
exercise professionals based in community leisure cen-
tres. Thus future interventions could also take advantage
of the expertise and facilities readily available through
community facilities, to provide low cost and destigma-
tising interventions to this population.
Furthermore, due to the general alignment in exercise
preferences expressed by participants [35], research as-
sistants were often able to group participants and
supervise 2–3 people per session. Administering indivi-
dualised exercise within small group settings has also
proved feasible in studies of long-term schizophrenia pa-
tients [9, 10]. Thus, implementing this approach within
clinical practice would reduce the cost of exercise inter-
ventions, and may even improve long-term maintenance
of exercise through enabling participants to act as each
other’s training partner after the supervised period
subsides.
Limitations
One limitation is that our sample were mostly male
(92 %) and had demonstrated an existing desire for exer-
cise by opting into the study. Thus, findings may not
generalise across whole first-episode population. How-
ever, the high referral-to-recruitment rates [17], along
with the many benefits observed, suggest that a substan-
tial portion of early intervention service users would
value exercise as an adjunctive intervention. It should
also be considered that the individualised nature of our
intervention meant that each participant’s preferences
were flexibly accommodated for. Therefore, barriers
which may typically prevent people from engaging (i.e.
lack of interest in activities offered, inaccessibility of
facilities) would be less likely to arise.
For this study, we conducted one round of interviews
immediately following the intervention, and then an-
other 6-month after, in order to assess patient opinions
on exercise after the supervised training period had sub-
sided. A limitation here is that, in order to obtain suffi-
cient data, six of the original interviewees were also used
in follow-up interviews, resulting in more qualitative
data being available for the subgroup (n = 6) who were
interviewed at both time-points. Nonetheless, the data
was grouped by participant number throughout, and
thematic analysis was applied to identify the common
themes across interviewees (rather than just interviews)
[21, 22], thus reducing the possibility of ‘double count-
ing’. Furthermore, each emergent sub-theme was sup-
ported by quotations from multiple participants.
Conclusions
The findings show that interventions which allocate
support on an individual-needs basis, while also priori-
tising the amount/intensity of exercise (rather than the
modality), are well-suited for people with early psych-
osis. Such interventions could be used in EIP services to
provide patients with an additional tool to manage posi-
tive and/or negative symptoms, while also improving
physical health and psychosocial functioning. Future
research must establish sustainable systems for imple-
menting exercise in clinical practice. Optimal systems
could incorporate short-term ‘introductory periods’ with
relatively high levels of supervision, followed by step-
down periods or peer support, leading people to auton-
omy and social integration with their own exercise
routines at local facilities.
