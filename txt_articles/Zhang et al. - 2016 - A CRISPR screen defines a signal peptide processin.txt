Flaviviruses infect hundreds of millions of people annually, and 
no antiviral therapy is available1,2. We performed a genome-wide 
CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to identify host genes that, when 
edited, resulted in reduced flavivirus infection. Here, we validated 
nine human genes required for flavivirus infectivity, and these 
were associated with endoplasmic reticulum functions including 
translocation, protein degradation, and N-linked glycosylation. 
In particular, a subset of endoplasmic reticulum-associated signal 
peptidase complex (SPCS) proteins was necessary for proper 
cleavage of the flavivirus structural proteins (prM and E) and 
secretion of viral particles. Loss of SPCS1 expression resulted in 
markedly reduced yield of all Flaviviridae family members tested 
(West Nile, dengue, Zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and 
hepatitis C viruses), but had little impact on alphavirus, bunyavirus, 
or rhabdovirus infection or the surface expression or secretion of 
diverse host proteins. We found that SPCS1 dependence could be 
bypassed by replacing the native prM protein leader sequences 
with a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen 
leader sequence. Thus, SPCS1, either directly or indirectly via 
its interactions with host proteins, preferentially promotes the 
processing of specific protein cargo, and Flaviviridae have a unique 
dependence on this signal peptide processing pathway. SPCS1 
and other signal processing pathway members could represent 
pharmacological targets for inhibiting infection by the expanding 
number of flaviviruses of medical concern.
We performed a genome-wide inhibition of West Nile virus (WNV)-
induced cell death screen using the CRISPR/Cas9 system3–7 and 
 
lentiviruses targeting 19,050 genes (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Whereas 
in the absence of lentivirus transduction cells did not survive WNV 
infection, colonies of lentivirus-transduced cells survived; single 
guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were amplified by PCR and sequenced. We 
identified 12 genes that were statistically enriched using MAGeCK8 
(Supplementary Tables 1, 2). All 12 genes were endoplasmic reticulum- 
associated with annotated functions of carbohydrate modification, 
 
protein translocation and signal peptide processing, protein degrada-
tion, and heat shock response (Fig. 1a).
In validation studies, editing of nine genes resulted in reduced 
WNV antigen expression following infection of 293T or HeLa cells 
(Fig. 1a, b) without causing cytotoxicity (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We 
confirmed the efficiency of gene editing for the proteins for which we 
could obtain validated antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Validated 
genes were tested for effects on related flaviviruses: Zika (ZIKV), 
Japanese encephalitis (JEV), dengue serotype 2 (DENV-2), and yellow 
fever (YFV) viruses. Editing of six of these genes reduced infection by 
all four flaviviruses (Fig. 1c–f). Editing of STT3A, SEC63, SPCS1, or 
SPCS3 resulted in decreased yields of WNV and JEV (Fig. 1g, h). We 
observed less impact on unrelated positive- or negative-sense RNA 
viruses (Extended Data Fig. 1d).
As pathogenic flaviviruses are transmitted by arthropods, we eval-
uated the roles of orthologues of these genes in insect cells. Silencing 
of Drosophila orthologues reduced infection by WNV and DENV-2 
 
(Fig. 2a, b) without appreciably affecting cell viability (Fig. 2c). 
Decreased WNV infection was also observed in mosquito cells after 
gene silencing (Fig. 2d). Depletion of Spase22-23 (orthologue of SPCS3) 
in adult Drosophila led to decreased WNV titres (Fig. 2e) and flies 
 
heterozygous for Spase12 (orthologue of SPCS1) showed reduced WNV 
infection (Fig. 2f). Overall, flavivirus infectivity in human and insect cells 
was dependent on analogous endoplasmic reticulum-associated genes.
Trans-complementation of gene-edited human cells with wild-type 
alleles rescued flavivirus infectivity (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g). Since 
we identified the genes encoding two (SPCS1 and SPCS3) of the five 
components of the Signal Peptidase Complex9,10, and found that insect 
SPCS genes also affected flavivirus infection, we focused our study 
on these genes. Gene silencing in human cells confirmed that SPCS 
genes were required for optimal flavivirus but not alphavirus infection 
(Extended Data Fig. 2 and data not shown).
We screened for clonal SPCS1 and SPCS3 knockout cells lines. 
Although we were unable to obtain SPCS3−/− clonal lines, SPCS1−/− 
293T or Huh7.5 cell clones grew, with both alleles containing nonsense 
deletions (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3). WNV
, DENV
, JEV
, YFV
, and 
ZIKV failed to accumulate in the supernatants of SPCS1−/− 293T cells 
(Fig. 3c–f), and WNV infectivity was restored in trans-complemented 
 
cells (Fig. 3h). However, SPCS1−/− cells supported infection by alpha-
viruses, bunyaviruses, and rhabdoviruses (Fig. 3i–k and Extended Data 
Fig. 3a). To corroborate these findings, we tested SPCS1−/− Huh7.5 
cells and found reduced infection by WNV, ZIKV, JEV, and the related 
Flaviviridae member, hepatitis C virus (Extended Data Fig. 3e, f). In 
comparison, gene editing of the remaining SPCS genes, SEC11A and 
SEC11C, had minimal effects on infection (Extended Data Fig. 4).
To determine whether SPCS1 was required for viral translation, 
 
replication, or both, we used wild-type and loss-of-function11 flavivirus 
 
replicons encoding reporter genes12 (Fig. 3b and Extended Data 
 
Fig. 5). Transfection of control cells with replicon RNA resulted in low 
levels of reporter gene activity over the first several hours, which reflects 
translation of input viral RNA, whereas subsequent signal increases are 
due to RNA replication. In SPCS1−/− cells, high levels of reporter gene 
expression were observed, indicating that viral RNA translation and 
replication remained largely intact.
We speculated that SPCS subunits, directly or indirectly, might 
 
regulate cleavage of the flavivirus polyprotein13. Flavivirus structural 
(prM and E) and non-structural (NS1 and NS4B) proteins are cleaved 
by unknown endoplasmic reticulum host signal peptidase(s) (Fig. 3l

or JEV, and lysates were analysed. Reduced levels of E and prM pro-
teins were found in SPCS1−/− clones and SPCS1 or SPCS3 bulk gene-

bands reacted with anti-E or anti-prM/E antibodies16 (Fig. 3m, n and

resulted in decreased expression of NS1 and the accumulation of 
higher molecular mass bands (Fig. 3o). We detected lower levels of 
NS4B protein in SPCS1−/− cells; in transfection studies with a tagged 
2K–NS4B plasmid, a higher molecular mass band was observed. For 
NS1–NS2A and NS3, we did not detect aberrant cleavage (Extended 
Data Fig. 6). We also tested the effects on HCV E2 glycoprotein and 
found decreased levels in SPCS1−/− cells (Extended Data Fig. 7). In 
comparison, alphavirus or bunyavirus glycoproteins, which also require 
endoplasmic reticulum processing17,18, showed intact expression in 
SPCS1−/− cells (Fig. 3p and Extended Data Fig. 3b, c).
To isolate the effects of the SPCS complex from infection, we trans-
fected a prM–E plasmid, which produces subviral particles (SVPs)19. 
Immunoblotting of cell lysates for E and prM proteins showed reduced 
levels and higher molecular mass bands in SPCS1- or SPCS3-deficient 
cells, and these changes correlated with a reduction in the number of 
secreted SVPs (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c). We tested whether cleavage of 
flavivirus protein signal sequences depended on SPCS1. We transfected 
WNV structural (capsid (C), prM, M, E) and secreted non-structural 
(NS1) genes with native or MHC class I (Kb) signal sequences into 
SPCS1−/− cells, and evaluated protein expression (Fig. 4).
Expression of C protein from a C–prM–E plasmid was equiv-
alent in control and SPCS1−/− cells, although in the absence of the 
viral protease, C did not migrate at its normal size (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 8d). However, cleavage of the downstream proteins prM and E was 
reduced in SPCS1−/− cells. When NS2B–NS3 was supplied in trans, 
 
C was cleaved from prM–E and accumulated at the correct size in 
control and SPCS1−/− cells. Thus, expression or cleavage of C is not 
affected by SPCS1.
We next evaluated expression of prM and M. When the native prM 
leader sequence was used, expression of prM and its furin-cleavage 
product M was reduced in SPCS1−/− cells (Fig. 4a, groups 1 and 3). 
 
Substitution of the Kb leader rescued prM and M expression in 
SPCS1−/− cells only when prM was on a separate plasmid (Fig. 4a, 
group 2) but not as a prM–E plasmid (Fig. 4a, group 4). Thus, specific 
leader sequences determine the dependence of prM and M protein 
expression on SPCS1, and downstream proteins can modulate pro-
cessing efficiency.
When E was transfected, its expression was largely independent 
of SPCS1 or the Kb leader sequence (Fig. 4b, groups 1 and 2). When 
 
E was cloned downstream of prM, accumulation of E was not detected 
in SPCS1−/− cells (Fig. 4b, groups 3 and 4). This finding suggested 
that the native leader sequence of E was not cleaved in SPCS1−/− cells 
when presented as an ‘internal’ leader sequence or that epistatic effects 
of the upstream prM protein reduced the stability of E protein. To test 
which of these possible explanations was correct, we performed 35S 
pulse-chase studies in prM–E-transfected cells. In control cells, only 
a single E protein band was visible, indicating rapid prM–E cleavage. 
However, prM–E and E bands were both present in SPCS1−/− cells 
 
(Fig. 4c, top) and remained in an endoplasmic reticulum-resident form 
(Fig. 4c, bottom). A short 3-min 35S pulse showed a delay in the cleavage 
 
of prM–E in SPCS1−/− cells (Fig. 4d).
We assessed the expression of NS1, which also requires endoplasmic 
 
reticulum-dependent signal sequence cleavage. When NS1 was trans-
fected into cells, SPCS1 was not required for expression (Fig. 4e, group 1). 
 
When NS1 was cloned downstream of E (Fig. 4e, groups 2 and 3) 
 
or prM–E (Fig. 4e, groups 4 and 5), NS1 levels were reduced in 
SPCS1−/− cells. After blotting with an anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody, 
 
a 90-kDa band was visible in blots from SPCS1−/− cells (Fig. 4e, group 2), 
 
which probably represented uncleaved E–NS1; this result was corrob-
orated by blotting for E protein (Fig. 4b, groups 5 and 6). Thus, place-
ment of the NS1 leader sequence into an internal position rendered it 
more dependent on SPCS1 for cleavage.
Flavivirus SVPs can be produced after transfection of prM and E on 
single or separate plasmids20,21. Transfection of prM–E encoding native

or Kb and native internal signal sequences resulted in loss of expres-
sion of prM and E or SVPs in SPCS1−/− cells (Fig. 4f, groups 5 and 6). 
When prM and E were co-transfected, the proteins were detected in 
SPCS1−/− cell lysates (Fig. 4f, groups 1 and 2) and supernatant, albeit 
at lower levels. In SPCS1−/− cells, prM negatively affected E but not NS1 
production (Fig. 4f (compare groups 1, 2, and 7) and Extended Data 
Fig. 8e), possibly because of its chaperone-like function for E protein20. 
Defects in co-expression of prM and E in SPCS1−/− cells were corrected 
by inserting the Kb leader sequence in front of the prM gene (Fig. 4f, 
groups 3 and 4). A 3-min 35S pulse and immunoprecipitation exper-
iment in SPCS1−/− cells showed an uncleaved form of prM (Fig. 4g).
To assess whether host surface proteins require SPCS1 for signal 
peptide processing, we profiled SPCS1−/− Jurkat T cells. Whereas 
ten antigens showed no difference in surface expression, levels of 
CD49d–CD29, ULBP1, and HLA-E were reduced by two-to-threefold 
(Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). A decrease in surface expression of ULBP1

RESEARCH
has been reported in cells deficient in SPCS1 or SPCS2 expression22, 
although this phenotype was not explored. In an unbiased approach, 
we analysed the secretome of SPCS1−/− 293T cells by mass spectrome-
try. Of the approximately 245 secreted proteins identified, only 35 were 
downregulated in SPCS1−/− cells, and the fold-changes were small 
(Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 4). We validated 3 of 5 
 
as being reduced in supernatants of SPCS1−/− cells (Supplementary 
Table 5). Despite profound effects on flavivirus protein processing, an 
absence of SPCS1 only modestly affected the expression of host proteins.
The differential requirement of SPCS1 for viral and host protein 
 
processing suggests that components of the SPCS complex in mamma-
lian and probably insect cells facilitate the cleavage of particular signal 
peptides in specific contexts. There may be additional requirements for 
some viruses, as interactions between SPCS1 and the HCV NS2 and E2 
proteins have been reported23.
A recent study performed an analogous CRISPR-based screen with 
WNV24. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated genes were identified 
that prevented WNV-induced cell death. We identified three of these 
genes (EMC4, EMC6, and SEL1L), as did an siRNA screen25. Virtually 
all human gene ‘hits’ identified in our screen had insect orthologues 
required for optimal flavivirus infection. A subset of our genes were also 
identified in RNAi screens in Drosophila cells26,27. The endoplasmic 
 
reticulum is a focal site in the flavivirus lifecycle because it sup-
ports translation, polyprotein processing, replication, and virion 
 
morphogenesis. The identification of host gene targets that are selec-
tively required for flavivirus infection but not cell survival provides 
intriguing candidates for pharmacological inhibition.

METHODS
Cells and viruses. Vero, BHK21, HeLa, U2OS, Huh7.5, and 293T cells were cultured 
 
at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS). C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells were cultured at 28 °C in 
L15 supplemented with 10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.3. Drosophila DL1 and 
Aedes Aag2 cells were cultured at 28 °C in Schneider’s medium supplemented with 
10% FBS as described28. Jurkat cells were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 supple-
mented with 10% FBS and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3. All cell lines were originally 
acquired from American Type Culture Collection or colleagues (Huh7.5) and were 
 
tested and judged free of mycoplasma contamination. The following viruses were 
used in screening and validation studies: WNV (New York 2000 and Kunjin), JEV 
(14-14-2 vaccine and Bennett strains), DENV-2 (16681 and New Guinea C strains), 
ZIKV (H/PF/2013), YFV (17D vaccine), CHIKV (2006 La Reunion OPY1), LACV 
(original strain), VSV (Indiana), HCV (J6/JFH), and SINV (Toto). With the 
 
exception of HCV (see below), all other viruses were propagated in BHK21, Vero, 
or C6/36 cells and titrated by standard plaque or focus-forming assays29.
Viral growth analysis. 293T or Huh7.5 cells were infected with WNV (multiplicity 
of infection (MOI) 0.01), JEV (14-14-2 strain, MOI 0.05 or 0.5; Bennett strain, MOI 
0.05), DENV-2 (MOI 3), YFV (MOI 1), ZIKV (MOI 0.05), CHIKV (MOI 0.01), 
SINV (MOI 0.01), RVFV (MOI 1), or VSV (MOI 0.01). After 2 h of incubation, 
cells were washed three times and samples were titrated on Vero cells. For HCV 
growth analysis, control and SPCS1 gene-edited Huh7.5 cells were inoculated at 
an MOI of 1 with virus derived from a growth-adapted JFH-1 infectious clone30. 
Cells were rinsed 6 h after infection to remove unbound virus and samples were 
collected every 24 h for 7 days. Viral titres in the supernatant were quantified by 
focus-forming assay, as described previously31.
Pooled sgRNA screen and data analysis. A pooled library encompassing 122,411 
different sgRNAs against 19,050 human genes was derived by the Zhang laboratory32  
and obtained from a commercial source (Addgene). The library was packaged 
using a lentivirus expression system and 293T cells were transfected using 
FugeneHD (Promega). Forty-eight hours after transfection, supernatants were 
collected, clarified by centrifugation (3,500 rpm × 20 min), filtered, and aliquotted 
for storage at −80 °C.
For the screen, we generated clonal 293T-Cas9 cells by transfecting the 
 
lentiCas9-Blast plasmid (Addgene 52962) using FugeneHD transfection reagent 
(Promega), blasticidin selection, and limiting dilution. These 293T-Cas9 cells were 
transduced with lentiviruses encoding individual sgRNAs at an MOI of 0.3. After 
selection with puromycin for 7 days, ~2 × 108 cells were infected with WNV (MOI 
of 1) and then incubated for 2–3 weeks. In parallel, untransduced 293T-Cas9 cells 
were infected to ensure virus-induced infection and cell death. The experiments 
were performed in parallel as either duplicate or triplicate technical replicates in 
two independent biological experiments.
Genomic DNA was extracted from the uninfected cells (5 × 107) or the cells 
(3 × 107) that survived WNV infection, and sgRNA sequences were amplified5, and 
subjected to next generation sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. 
The sgRNA sequences against specific genes were recovered after removal of the 
tag sequences using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) 
and cutadapt 1.8.1.
Gene validation. The cut-off for candidate gene ‘hits’ was made using a pub-
lished computational tool (MAGeCK)8 and reflected sequencing data showing 
multiple different sgRNAs per gene, the number of sequencing reads per gene, 
and the enrichment of a given sgRNA compared to the uninfected cell library 
(Supplementary Tables 1, 2). From this, we identified 12 genes that showed statis-
tically significant enrichment compared to uninfected cells. These candidate genes 
were tested for validation by using 3–5 independent sgRNAs per gene from the 
parent library and cloning them into the plasmid pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) 
V2.0 (Addgene plasmid 62988). The control sgRNAs were used from the par-
ent library. Plasmids were transfected into 293T or HeLa cells using FugeneHD 
transfection reagent and puromycin was added one day later. Three days later, 
puromycin was removed, and cells were allowed to recover for three additional 
days before infection with different viruses.
For flow cytometric analyses, gene-edited 293T cells were infected with WNV 
(MOI 5, 12 h), JEV (MOI 50, 22 h), ZIKV (MOI 10, 30 h), DENV-2 (MOI 3, 32 h), 
YFV (MOI 3, 38 h), CHIKV (MOI 1, 6 h), SINV (MOI 10, 6 h), LACV (MOI 5, 
6 h), or VSV-GFP (MOI 1, 5.5 h). Gene-edited HeLa cells were infected with WNV 
(MOI 3, 24 h). At the indicated times, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde 
(PFA) diluted in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 
Perm buffer (HBSS (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% (w/v) saponin (Sigma), 
and 0.025% NaN3 (Sigma)) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells then were rinsed 
one additional time with Perm buffer, transferred to a U-bottom plate, and incu-
bated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg ml−1 of the following virus-specific antibodies: WNV 
(human E16 (ref. 33)); DENV2 (mouse E18 (ref. 34)); JEV (mouse E18 (ref. 34)); 
YFV (mouse E60 (ref. 34)); CHIKV (CHK-11 (ref. 35)); SINV (ascites fluid, ATCC 
VR-1248AF), LACV (807-31 and 807-33, gift from A. Pekosz). After washing, cells 
were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-human 
 
IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were fixed in 1% PFA in PBS, processed on 
a FACS Array (BD Biosciences), and analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Validation also was performed by an infectious virus yield assay. Bulk 
gene-edited 293T cells were infected with WNV (MOI 0.01) or JEV (MOI 0.5). 
Supernatants were collected at specific times after infection and focus-forming 
assays were performed in 96-well plates as described previously36. Following infec-
tion, cell monolayers were overlaid with 100 μl per well of medium (1 × DMEM, 
4% FBS) containing 1% carboxymethylcellulose, and incubated for 22 h (WNV) 
or 36 h (JEV) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were then fixed by adding 100 μl per 
well of 1% PFA directly onto the overlay at room temperature for 40 min. Cells 
were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized (in 1 × PBS, 0.1% saponin, and 0.1% 
BSA) for 20 min, and incubated with antibodies specific for WNV (humanized E16 
 
(ref. 33)) or JEV (mouse E18 (ref. 34)) E glycoprotein for 1 h at room tempera-
ture. After being rinsed twice, cells were incubated with species-specific HRP-
conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). After further washing, foci were 
developed by incubating in 50 μl per well of TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) 
for 10 min at room temperature, after which time cells were washed twice in water. 
Well images were captured using Immuno Capture software (Cell Technology Ltd), 
and foci counted using BioSpot software (Cell Technology Ltd).
Insect cell and fly infections. dsRNAs were generated as described37. To silence 
genes using RNAi, insect cells were passaged into serum-free medium containing 
 
dsRNAs targeting the indicated genes. Cells were serum-starved for 1 h, after 
which complete medium was added and cells were incubated for 3 days. Cells 
were infected with WNV (Kunjin strain) at an MOI of 4 or DENV-2 (NGC strain) 
at an MOI of 1 for 30 h and then processed for microscopy with automated image 
analysis as described38. Control (hs>+) or Spcs3-depleted (hs>Spase22-23 IR 
(Bloomington)) 4–7-day-old female flies were heat shocked (37 °C) for 1 h for 
three consecutive days to deplete the gene of interest and challenged with WNV 
(Kunjin) (5 PFU). At day 7 after infection, pools of 10 flies were crushed and titred 
by plaque assay. Three independent experiments were performed. Heterozygous 
flies (Spase12(EY10774)) were outcrossed to wild-type flies and either wild-type 
or Spase12 heterozygous sibling controls were challenged with WNV (Kunjin) for 
7 days and groups of 5 flies were titred.
siRNA treatments in human cells. Human U2OS cells were transfected with 
 
siRNAs against control, SPCS1, SPCS2, or SPCS3 genes for three days, infected with 
WNV (Kunjin) or DENV-2 (MOI 1) for 18 h, and then processed for microscopy 
with automated image analysis as described38.
Replicon transfection and analysis. Two types of replicons were used.
SP6-generated YFV replicons. The wild-type and NS5 polymerase mutant 
(GDD→GVD) YFV replicons (YF-FFLuc2A, wild-type and GVD) have been 
published previously12 and were a gift from R. Kuhn. Capped replicon RNA was 
generated using SP6 polymerase with an mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was purified 
using an RNEasy kit (Qiagen) and 2 μg was transfected into control or SPCS1−/− 
Huh7.5 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). At specified times, cells were collected, lysed, 
and processed for firefly luciferase activity using a commercial kit (Promega). 
Cleared lysates were tested for Fluc activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 
Assay System (Promega) and the protein concentration was quantified using a BCA 
assay kit (ThermoFisher). Fluc activity (relative light units, RLU) was normalized 
by subtracting background luminescence of transfected cells collected at the time 
of transfection, then the adjusted RLU was divided by the total protein content 
 
(in μg) to yield RLU per μg protein.
cDNA launched WNV replicons. The construction of wild-type and NS5 polymerase 
mutant (GDD→GVD) WNV replicons (lineage I, strain New York 1999) was based 
on a previously described cDNA launched molecular clone system39. The back-
bone of this strategy, a plasmid containing a truncated WNV genome under the 
 
control of a CMV promoter (pWNV-backbone), was designed to be complemented 
via ligation of a structural gene DNA fragment; transfection of pWNV-backbone 
alone does not result in production of a self-replicating RNA molecule. Using overlap 
 
extension PCR and unique restriction endonuclease sites, pWNV-backbone 
 
was modified by the introduction of a fragment downstream of the CMV pro-
moter encoding [5′UTR-cyclization sequence of capsid-FMDV2a protease- 
signal sequence of E-NS1] to complement the NS2→NS5-3′UTR already present in 
the pWNV-backbone plasmid, generating the replicon plasmid pWNVI-rep. The 
reporter gene GFP was then cloned upstream of the FMDV2a protease sequence via 
a unique MluI site to generate pWNVI-rep–GFP. The construction and organiza-
tion of this WNV lineage I replicon is analogous to a previously described lineage 
II WNV replicon (pWNVIIrep–GFP)40. Finally, QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent 
Technologies) was used to delete the enhancer portion of the CMV immediate early 
enhancer/promoter, generating pWNVI-minCMV-rep–GFP, and to generate the

GDD→GVD NS5 polymerase variant. Although the CMV enhancer–promoter 
combination commonly found in cloning vectors results in robust and constitutive 
expression, inclusion of only the minimal CMV promoter (no enhancer) results in 
low-level expression41. As such, direct transfection of pWNVI-minCMV-rep–GFP 
results in a dim GFP signal, which reflects translation of the RNA generated by 
DNA-dependent RNA translation. RNA polymerase-dependent replication of the 
wild-type (but not GVD mutant) replicon results in higher production of GFP 
over time. The eGFP is bracketed by the FMDV2a autocleavage site, and does not 
rely on host or viral proteases for processing. Wild-type and NS5 GVD variants of 
pWNVI-minCMV-rep–GFP (200 ng) were transfected into 104 control or gene- 
edited 293T cells (96-well plates) using Lipofectamine 2000. At various times after 
transfection, cells were collected, cooled to 4 °C, stained sequentially with a bioti-
nylated anti-9NS1 (ref. 42) (or biotin anti-CHIKV negative control monoclonal 
antibodies) and Alexa 647-conjugated streptavidin. In some samples, cells were 
fixed with 4% PFA in PBS (10 min, room temperature) and permeabilized with 
0.1% (w/v) saponin. Cells were processed for two-colour flow cytometry using a 
MACs Quant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec).
Plasmid transfections. 293T gene-edited cells were transfected with the following 
genes that were derived from a WNV infectious cDNA clone43 and then cloned 
into a pHLsec backbone (gift from D. Fremont): V5–C–prM–E, prM, prM–Flag 
(3 × Flag), E, prM–E, prM–E–NS1, E–NS1, NS1, NS1–NS2A–Flag (includes 
full-length NS1 and 231 amino acids of NS2A fused to a C-terminal 3 × Flag), 
and 2K–NS4B–haemagglutinin tag (HA). These plasmids were obtained from 
colleagues (e.g., 2K-NS4B-HA44, gift from A. Garcia-Sastre) or in some cases 
engineered to contain either native WNV signal sequences (C–prM, 18 amino 
acids beyond the C terminus of C; prM-E, 17 C-terminal amino acids of prM; 
E-NS1, 24 C-terminal amino acids of E) or the signal sequence of mouse Kb class 
I MHC (N-terminal 21 amino acids). Plasmids were transfected into gene-edited 
293T cells using FugeneHD reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Supernatants containing prM-E subviral particles (SVPs) were col-
lected 24 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and stored aliquotted 
at −80 °C. For the capture ELISA, Nunc MaxiSorp polystyrene 96-well plates were 
coated overnight at 4 °C with mouse E60 monoclonal antibodies34 (5 μg ml−1) in a 
pH 9.3 carbonate buffer. Plates were washed three times in enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) wash buffer (PBS with 0.02% Tween 20) and blocked for 
1 h at 37 °C with ELISA block buffer (PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% 
Tween 20). Supernatants from prM-E plasmid transfected cells were captured on 
plates coated with E60 for 90 min at room temperature. Subsequently, plates were 
rinsed five times in wash buffer and then incubated with humanized anti-WNV 
E16 (1 μg ml−1 in block buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed 
five times and then incubated with pre-absorbed biotinylated goat anti-human IgG 
antibody (1 μg ml−1; Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature in blocking 
buffer. Plates were washed again five times and then sequentially incubated with 
2 μg ml−1 of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories) 
and tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Dako). The reaction was stopped with the 
addition of 2 N H2SO4 to the medium, and emission (450 nm) was read using an 
iMark microplate reader (Bio-Rad).
Western blotting. For virus infected samples, cells were infected with WNV (MOI 
200–1,000, 24 h), JEV (MOI 150, 45 h), CHIKV (MOI 5, 12 h), SINV (MOI 5, 16 h), 
RVFV (MOI 2.5, 16 h), or HCV (MOI 5, 48 or 72 h). Cells (106) were lysed directly 
in 30 μl RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling) with 0.1% SDS and a cocktail of protease inhib-
itors (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were prepared in LDS buffer (Life Technologies) 
under non-reducing or reducing (dithiothreitol) conditions. After heating (70 °C, 
10 min), samples were electrophoresed using 7% Tris-Acetate or 4–12%, 10% or 
12% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) and proteins were transferred to PVDF mem-
branes using an iBlot2 Dry Blotting System (Life Technologies). Membranes were 
blocked with 5% non-fat dry powdered milk and probed with antibodies against 
SPCS1 (11847-1-AP, Proteintech), SPCS2 (14872-1-AP, Proteintech), SPCS3 
(ab91222, Abcam), SEC11A (14753-1-AP, Proteintech), SEC11C (HPA026816, 
Sigma) and SEC61B (ab15576, Abcam). For studies with prM–E, prM, E, NS1, 
NS1–2A–Flag, or 2K–NS4B–Flag-transfected or virus-infected cells, membranes 
were probed with anti-E (human E16; mouse CHK-4835; mouse anti-JEV, oligo-
clonal pool), anti-NS1 (mouse 8-NS1), anti-NS3 (W1018-54, USBio), anti-NS4B 
(rabbit polyclonal antibody45, gift from W
. I. Lipkin) anti-prM (human CR429316 or 
rabbit WNV-M (IMG-5099A, IMGENEX)), anti-Flag (F1804, Sigma), and the rel-
evant secondary antibodies. For validation of the secretome experiments, superna-
tants were electrophoresed and PVDF membranes were probed with anti-CXCL16 
(ab101404, Abcam), anti-SFRP1 (ab126613, Abcam), anti-RNASET2 (ab169655, 
Abcam), anti-LGALS3BP(ab81489, Abcam),anti-SLITL2 (ab173758, Abcam), anti-
PEDF (ab157207, Abcam), anti-NPC2 (19888-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-CREG1 
(12220-1-AP, Proteintech), and the relevant secondary antibodies. Western blots 
were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate or 
SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Life Technologies).
Metabolic labelling, pulse-chase, and immunoprecipitation experiments. Pulse-
labelling and pulse-chase experiments were performed as described  
previously46. 
After starvation in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM for 30 min, 293T cells 
were labelled metabolically with 300 or 500 μCi ml−1 [35S]-methionine/cysteine 
(PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 3 or 40 min. Cells then were washed three 
times in PBS and immediately lysed or incubated in DMEM supplemented with 
non-radiolabelled cysteine (500 μg ml−1) and methionine (100 μg ml−1). Cells lysis 
was performed in 400 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 
1 mM EDTA, 5 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium 
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS. After preclearing with an irrelevant human monoclonal 
 
antibody protein A-agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) complex, lysates were 
incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with humanized monoclonal E16 and E60 monoclonal 
antibodies or anti-Flag and then with protein A-agarose for 2 h. The immunopre-
cipitates were washed seven times in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mM 
PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 5 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, 
1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, and then analysed by SDS–PAGE under 
reducing conditions, followed by fluorography. Some immunoprecipitates were 
incubated with 20 mU endoglycosidase H or PNGase F (New England BioLabs) 
for 1 h at 37 °C before SDS–PAGE and fluorography.
293T cell viability assay. A Vybrant MTT cell viability assay (Life Technologies) 
was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 10 μl of 12 mM 
MTT (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added 
to 105 293T cells (different gene-edited lines, with or without WNV infection) in 
100 μl phenol-red free medium. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, at which time 
medium was removed and formazan crystals solubilized in 100 μl of DMSO were 
added for 10 min at 37 °C. Liquid was analysed for absorbance at 540 nm using a 
Synergy H1 Hybrid Plate Reader (Biotek).
Flow and mass cytometry analysis of Jurkat T cells. The antibodies and 
 
conjugates used are listed in Supplementary Table 6. For flow cytometry studies, 
 
wild-type and SPCS1 gene-edited Jurkat T cells were incubated with fluoro-
phore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed three 
times in PBS containing 5% FBS. Cells were immediately processed on an LSRII 
flow cytometer and data were analysed using FlowJo 10.0.7. For mass cytometry 
studies, wild-type and SPCS1 gene-edited Jurkat T cells were incubated with mon-
oclonal antibodies conjugated with transition element isotopes and analysed on 
a CyTOF 2 mass cytometer (Fluidigm DVS Sciences). Data were analysed using 
Cytobank (http://wustl.cytobank.org) and FlowJo 10.0.7.
Secretome analysis of SPCS1−/− 293T cells. Wild-type and SPCS1−/− 293T cells 
were cultured in poly-d-lysine treated flasks in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium 
(ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% FBS. At 90% confluence, cells were 
washed four times with pre-warmed PBS, then twice with pre-warmed FreeStyle 
293 Expression Medium, and maintained in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium 
without FBS for 48 h. Supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation 
at 1,000g for 5 min, and then 10,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples were concen-
trated with Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore) at 5,000g for 1 h 
in the presence of 1 × protease inhibitors (S8830, Sigma). The concentrates were 
collected and stored at −80 °C. After thawing on ice, the samples were exchanged 
twice in digestion buffer (Tris, 0.1 M, pH 8.5 containing 8 M urea) by centrifugation 
(~4,000g, 2 h) in Amicon Ultracel 3K units to a volume of ~100 μl. The solubilized 
samples were reduced with 2 mM DTT (ThermoScientific) for 30 min at 37 °C 
followed by alkylation at room temperature for 30 min with 7 mM iodoacetamide 
(Sigma) in the dark. The alkylated samples were treated with 7 mM DTT for 15 min 
at room temperature. After dilution, the samples were digested with LysC (1 μg) 
(Sigma) overnight at 37 °C with agitation (ThermoMixer). After dilution of the 
samples to 1.5 M urea with Tris buffer, trypsin was added (5 μg) (Sigma) was added 
and the incubation was continued overnight at 37 °C with mixing. The digested 
samples were acidified with to a concentration of 1% tri-flouro acetic acid (TFA). 
The peptides were desalted with a SepPak (50 mg) with 0.1%TFA/70% acetoni-
trile in an elution volume (2 ml). The lyophilized peptides were quantified with 
a fluorescent assay (Thermo Fisher) and 2 μg was labelled with TMT-6 reagents 
according to the vendor. The labelled peptides were desalted and the samples were 
transferred to PCR tubes (0.5 ml) and positioned in 96-well holders for robotic 
solid phase extraction (SPE). Each digest was extracted sequentially with one C4 
tip (Glygen BIOMEK NT3C04) and one porous graphite carbon micro-tip (Glygen 
BIOMEK NT3CAR) with the following auto-pipetting steps: (i) wet tips with AcN/
FA (60%/1%) (10 × 25 μl); (ii) equilibrate tips with AcN/FA (1%/1%) (10 × 25 μl); 
(iii) extract peptides with repetitive aspirations of the digest (50 × 25 μl); (iv) wash 
loaded tips with AcN/FA (1%/1%) (10 × 25 μl); and (v) elute peptides with AcN/
FA (60%/1%) (5 × 65 μl). The SPE eluents were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac 
centrifuge and transferred to an autosampler vial for LC–MS analysis.
The remainder of the peptides were dissolved in the binding buffer (100 mM 
Tris, pH 7.8 containing NaCl (0.5 M), MnCl2 (1 mM) and CaCl2 (1 mM). The dried 
lectins (Con-A and WGA) Sigma were dissolved in binding buffer (4 mg ml−1).

The rCA120 (10 mg ml−1), Con-A and WGA were added to the peptide solution 
(36 μl and 10 μl, respectively). After incubation at room temperature, the mixture 
was transferred to a YM-10 Microcon filter unit. After centrifugation (14,000g) for 
10 min and washing with binding buffer (100 μl), the filter unit was transferred to 
another tube. The peptides were released with the addition of PNGase (10 units) in 
100 μl of ammonium bicarbonate buffer (50 mM) after incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 h. 
The enzyme addition and incubation was repeated and the peptides recovered 
with one wash of PNGase buffer. The peptides were acidified to 5% formic acid 
and desalted, labelled with TMT-6, and prepared for LC–MS as described above 
for the total pool of peptides.
LC–MS analysis. LC–ESI/MS/MS analysis was conducted with a Q-Exactive Plus 
mass spectrometer coupled to an EASY-nanoLC 1000 system (Thermo-Fisher). 
For each Hp-RP fraction, 2 μl of sample was loaded onto a 75 μm i.d. × 25 cm 
Acclaim PepMap 100 RP column (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Peptide separations 
were started with 95% mobile phase A (0.1% FA) for 5 min and increased to 30% 
B (100% ACN, 0.1% FA) over 180 min, followed by a 25-min gradient to 45% 
B, a 5-min gradient to 95% B and wash at 90% B for 7 min, with a flow rate of 
300 nl min−1. Full-scan mass spectra were acquired by the Orbitrap mass analyser 
in the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 375–1,400 and with a mass resolving power 
set to 70,000. Fifteen data-dependent high-energy collisional dissociations were 
performed with a mass resolving power set to 35,000, a fixed first m/z of 100, an 
isolation width of 0.7 m/z, and the normalized collision energy (NCE) setting of 
32. The maximum injection time was 50 ms for parent-ion analysis and 105 ms 
for product-ion analysis. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were excluded 
dynamically for 30 s. An automatic gain control target value of 3 × 106 ions was 
used for full MS scans and 105 ions for MS/MS scans. Peptide ions with charge 
states of one or greater than six were excluded from MS/MS interrogation.
Protein identification and quantification with TMT. All raw data were processed 
using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81, Thermo-Fischer Scientific). MS/MS 
spectra were searched with SequestHT engine against the human UniRef database 
(69,021 entries; version 2014_05), assuming the digestion enzyme was trypsin 
with a maximum of 2 missed cleavage allowed. The searches were performed with 
a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.02 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 20 ppm. 
Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, acetylation and TMT 6-plex derivat-
ization of N termini and oxidation of methionine were specified in Proteome 
Discoverer as variable modifications. Iodoacetamide derivatization of cysteine 
and TMT 6-plex derivatization of lysine were specified as fixed modifications. 
Peptide spectral matches (PSM) were validated using percolator based on q-values 
at a 1% FDR47. Peptides were filtered to 1% FDR and grouped into proteins at 1% 
FDR as specified in Proteome Discoverer. The intensities of TMT reporter ions 
were determined with Proteome Discoverer at a mass tolerance of 0.01 Da and 
used for peptide quantifications. The median values of peptide intensities that can 
be assigned to a same protein was used to represent protein intensities. Peptide 
identifications that can be assigned to more than one protein were removed from 
protein quantification
Proteomic Data Analysis. Normalization in protein ratios was applied in that 
the median ratios are log2 0. Data analysis was performed with the free software 
environment for statistical computing and graphics, R (http://www.R-project.
org). Gene ontology analysis was carried out using the Database for Annotation, 
Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)48,49. Data from duplicated LC/
MS/MS analysis were first averaged and protein abundance ratios were log2- 
transformed before statistical analysis. A one-way ANOVA with Benjamini-
Hochberg correction was performed to assess the statistical significance in protein 
abundance changes between wild type and SPCS1−/− cells.
Statistical analysis. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. 
The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to 
allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Statistical significance 
was assigned when P values were <0.05 using GraphPad Prism Version 5.04. Viral

Extended Data Figure 1 | Results of CRISPR-Cas9 screen. a, Scheme  
of gene-editing screen. b, Analysis of cell viability of gene-edited cells. 
WNV-infected CRISPR-Ca9 edited bulk cells were evaluated for cell 
viability using a metabolic MTT assay 24 h after infection. The results  
were pooled from several independent experiments performed in 
duplicate and data were compared to cells edited with a control sgRNA. 
None of the differences were statistically significant compared to the 
control. c, Western blotting confirms the efficiency of gene editing of 
SEC61B, SPCS1, and SPCS3. β-actin is included as a loading control.  
d, Effect of gene editing on infection by other RNA viruses. sgRNA-
edited bulk selected cell populations were infected with alphaviruses 
(SINV or CHIKV), a bunyavirus (LACV) or a rhabdovirus (VSV). Cells 
were analysed for intracellular viral antigen staining by flow cytometry 
using virus-specific monoclonal antibodies. The data are representative 
of two independent experiments and are expressed as relative infection 
(viral antigen expression) compared to the sgRNA control. d–f, Trans-
complementation of sgRNA gene-edited cells with Flag-tagged genes.  
d, Individual sgRNA bulk gene-edited cell lines were trans-complemented 
with cDNA expressing C-terminal Flag-tagged versions of their respective 
genes and GFP or an empty vector control and GFP. Transfected cells 
were analysed by flow cytometry for expression of the Flag-tag in the 
GFP+ cells. The data are representative of two independent experiments. 
e, Western blotting of SPCS1 and SPCS3 trans-complemented genes after 
incubation with an anti-Flag antibody. f, Individual sgRNA cell lines 
were trans-complemented with cDNA expressing C-terminal Flag-tagged 
versions of their respective genes and GFP or an empty vector control 
and GFP. Transfected cells were infected with WNV (MOI 5) and 12 h 
later cells were stained for intracellular E antigen and processed by flow 
cytometry. The data are representative of three independent experiments 
performed in triplicate and reflect the percentage of WNV-infected cells 
in the fraction that expressed GFP. The indicated comparisons were 
statistically significant (****P < 0.0001), as determined by the Mann–
Whitney test. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

Extended Data Figure 3 | Viral infection in SPCS1−/− cells.  
a–c, Alphaviruses replicate and are processed efficiently in 293T cells 
in the absence of expression of SPCS1. a, SINV infection in control and 
SPCS1−/− clonal cells. Cells were infected (MOI 0.01) and supernatants 
were collected and analysed by FFA. The results are the average of 
two independent experiments performed in triplicate. b, Control and 
SPCS1−/− gene-edited 293T cells were infected with SINV. At the indicated 
time, lysates were prepared, electrophoresed and western blotted with  
anti-SINV E2 ascites fluid (ATCC VR-1248AF). c, Control or SPCS1−/− 
293T cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 5). After 8 h, cells were 
labelled for 30 min with [35S]cysteine/methionine. Excess cold cysteine/
methionine was added for indicated chase times (0, 1 or 4 h). An 
uninfected control established the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. 
After 35S labelling, lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with 
anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies (CHK-48). Immunoprecipitates were 
left untreated (blank) or treated with Endo H (E) or PNGase F (P) 
for 1 h at 37 °C before SDS–PAGE and fluorography. d, Sequencing of 
SPCS1 alleles in gene-edited 293T and Huh7 cell clones after puromycin 
selection and limiting dilution cloning. The sgRNA targeting site and 
the ‘PAM’ sequences are highlighted at the top of the wild-type gene, 
and the sequence of edited alleles are indicated. e, Western blotting of 
bulk-selected or clonal (clone 7) Huh7.5 cells (control and SPCS1 sgRNA 
selected) for expression of SPCS1 (~12 kDa). f, WNV, HCV, ZIKV,  
and JEV (Bennett strain) infection in control and SPCS1-deficient Huh7.5 
cells. Cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 (WNV, ZIKV, JEV) or 1 (HCV) 
and supernatants were collected and analysed by FFA. The results are the 
average of two independent experiments performed in triplicate.  
g, Control or SPCS1−/− Huh7.5 cells were infected at an MOI of 150 for 
45 h with a pathogenic JEV isolate (Bennett strain). Lysates were blotted 
with an anti-JEV E monoclonal antibody. Higher molecular mass bands 
(Ehi and Emed) that reacted specifically with the anti-E monoclonal 
antibody are indicated. One representative experiment of two is shown 
and loading controls (β-actin) are included. For gel source data,

Extended Data Figure 4 | Gene editing of SEC11A and SEC11C do not 
substantively affect infection of several enveloped viruses. Top, 293T 
cells were treated with the indicated sgRNA and isolated in bulk after 
puromycin drug selection. Western blotting confirmed gene editing of 
SEC11A (left, 20 kDa) or SEC11C (middle, 22 kDa). No difference in levels 
or migration pattern of WNV E was observed in SEC11A or SEC11C  
gene-edited cells (right) after WNV infection at an MOI of 200 for 24 h. 
Spaces between the western blots indicate cropping to remove lanes that 
were not relevant to this experiment. Bottom, control or gene-edited 
293T cells were infected with viruses and supernatants were harvested 
after infection for titration. Left, WNV (MOI 0.01, 72 h) or YFV (MOI 
1, 72 h); right, SINV (MOI 0.01, 72 h), CHIKV (MOI 0.01, 36 h), VSV

Extended Data Figure 5 | Effect of sgRNA on translation and replication 
of wild-type and NS5 GVD polymerase mutant WNV replicons.  
A cDNA launched WNV replicon (a, wild-type; b, GVD polymerase ‘dead’ 
mutant) with a minimal CMV promoter (GFP–NS1–NS2A–NS2B–NS3–
NS4A–NS4B–NS5) was transfected into the indicated gene-edited 293T 
cells. At 48 and 72 h after transfection, cells were collected and analysed 
for GFP expression by flow cytometry. After transfection with the wild-
type replicon, WNV replication was lower in STT3A gene-edited cells, as 
determined by ANOVA with a multiple comparisons correction (P < 0.05 
at 48 and 72 h). Data are the average of three independent experiments. 
Note, the GVD replicon data with sgRNA control (translation only) are 
provided for comparison in a.

Extended Data Figure 6 | Processing of WNV proteins in SPCS1 and 
SPCS3 gene-edited 293T cells. a, Normal (left) and over-exposed (right) 
western blot in SPCS1 and SPCS3 bulk gene-edited 293T cells. The over-
exposure is shown to highlight the accumulation of high molecular mass 
bands that react with anti-E protein antibody. Control, SPCS1 and SPCS3 
gene-edited 293T cells were infected with WNV or mock-infected for the 
indicated times. Lysates were western blotted with an anti-E (human E16) 
monoclonal antibodies. Under these electrophoresis conditions, natively 
processed E protein migrates at ~50 to 55 kDa. Higher molecular mass 
bands (Emed (probably prM–E) and Ehi (probably prM–E–NS1)) that react 
specifically with the E monoclonal antibody are present only in SPCS1 
and SPCS3 gene-edited 293T cells. The data are representative of two 
independent experiments and a loading control (β-actin) is shown.  
b, Western blot of SPCS1 and SPCS3 bulk gene-edited 293T cells. Control, 
SPCS1, and SPCS3 gene-edited 293T cells were infected with WNV or 
mock-infected for the indicated times. Lysates were western blotted with 
an anti-prM human monoclonal antibody (CR4293) that recognizes a 
shared epitope on prM and E. Higher molecular mass bands (prM–Ehi) 
probably represent uncleaved polyprotein forms and are present only in 
SPCS1 and SPCS3 gene-edited 293T cells. The data are representative 
of two independent experiments and a loading control (β-actin) is 
shown. c, Control or SPCS1−/− cells were infected with WNV or left 
unmanipulated (−) and 24 h later cell lysates were generated and probed 
with a polyclonal antibody against NS4B. The results are representative of 
two independent experiments and loading controls (β-actin) are shown. 
d, Control or SPCS1−/− cells were transfected with a 2K-NS4B–HA 
plasmid. One day later, lysates were probed with an anti-HA antibody. 
Results are representative of two independent experiments and loading 
controls (β-actin) are shown. Cleaved (NS4B) and uncleaved (2K–NS4B) 
bands are indicated on the right of the gel. e, Control or SPCS1−/− cells 
were transfected with NS1, NS1–NS2A–Flag, or control plasmids. One 
day later, lysates were probed with anti-NS1 (left) or anti-FLAG (right) 
antibodies. Cleavage of NS1–NS2A–Flag results in expression of the 
C-terminal Flag tag exclusively with the residual NS2A protein. The 
results are representative of three independent experiments and loading 
controls (β-actin) are shown. Note, expression of NS1–NS2A results in two 
forms of NS1 (NS1 and NS1′) owing to a ribosomal frameshift event that 
occurs at a heptanucleotide motif near the beginning of the NS2A gene. 
f, Control or SPCS1−/− cells were infected with WNV or left uninfected 
and 24 h later cell lysates were generated and probed with a monoclonal 
antibody against NS3. The results are representative of two independent 
experiments and loading controls (β-actin) are shown. For gel source data, 
see Supplementary Fig. 1.

Extended Data Figure 8 | Effect of sgRNA on WNV structural protein 
processing and production. a–c, The indicated gene-edited 293T cells 
were transfected with a plasmid encoding WNV prM–E and subjected 
to western blotting with hE16 (anti-E) (a) or CR4293 (anti-prM-E) (b). 
Note the shift of the prM–E bands to high molecular mass in bulk gene-
edited cells with reduced expression of SPCS1 or SPCS3. The results are 
representative of three independent experiments and a loading control 
(β-actin) is shown. c, 293T cells expressing the indicated sgRNA were 
transfected with a plasmid encoding prM–E. After 24 h, supernatants 
were collected and SVPs were quantified by capture ELISA. The results are 
the average of several independent experiments performed in triplicate. 
The asterisks indicate SVP levels in the supernatant that are statistically 
different compared to control cells (****P < 0.001, ANOVA with a 
multiple comparison correction). d, Control or SPCS1−/− clonal 293T 
cells were transfected with a single C–prM–E plasmid containing an 
N-terminal V5 tag fused to C (purple box) and native C–prM (green box) 
and prM–E (blue box) leader sequences. In some experiments, a cDNA 
launched WNV replicon was co-transfected to facilitate the cleavage of 
C from prM by the viral NS2B–NS3 protease. Lysates were prepared 24 h 
later and probed with an anti-V5 (top) or anti-E (bottom) antibody. Note, 
two separate gels were run for blotting with anti-V5 (C) and anti-E. One 
representative experiment of two is shown and a loading control (β-actin) 
for the top (anti-V5) gel is included. e, Control and SPCS1−/− 293T cells 
were transfected with E or NS1 with or without prM co-transfection. 
One day after transfection, cells were collected and lysates were western 
blotted with antibodies against E (left) or NS1 (right). Molecular mass 
markers and specific proteins are indicated to the left and right of each 
gel, respectively. The results are representative of three independent 
experiments. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.
