Background: Many reports have indicated that the intravenous administration of bevacizumab 
produces a number of systemic side effects. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic effects 
of intratumoral bevacizumab administration using a glioma animal model. 
Methods: The glioma cell lines U251 and U87 that carried luciferase were implanted into 
the brains of mice to develop glioma models. Glioma-bearing mice were treated with bevaci-
zumab intravenously or intratumorally by Alzet micro-osmotic pumps, and the survival time 
of mice was monitored. Tumor volumes and location were observed by fluorescence imaging 
and histological analysis. Levels of microvessel marker, cancer stem cell marker as well as 
angiogenesis-, invasion-, and inflammation-related factors in tumors were examined by immu-
nohistochemical staining. 
Results: Mice treated with intratumoral low-dose bevacizumab had smaller tumor volumes, 
longer survival time, lower microvessel density, and fewer cancer stem cells as compared with 
untreated and intravenously treated mice. Furthermore, expression levels of inflammation-related 
factors increased signifiwhereas that of angiogenesis- and invasion-related factors decreased in 
intratumorally treated animals, compared with intravenously treated mice. 
Conclusion: These results implied bevacizumab delivery by intratumoral injection via Alzet 
micro-osmotic pumps may be a more effective and safer protocol for treating gliomas.
Keywords: bevacizumab, anti-angiogenic, glioma cell line, intratumoral delivery, fluorescence 
imaging
Introduction
Gliomas [glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)] are highly vascularized tumors and their 
abundant capillary network may possibly be the main reason for their rapid growth 
and poor prognosis. A series of studies proved that the vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) and its associated pathways are of great importance in controlling the 
complex process of angiogenesis in GBMs.1–3 Therefore, bevacizumab (BEV) – a 
recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to human VEGF – has found 
widespread application in the treatment of malignant gliomas and is intravenously 
administered.4–6
However, some studies have indicated that chronic high-dose BEV treatment 
results in serious systemic adverse events in patients. In addition, tumors eventually 
became resistant to the anti-angiogenesis therapy and adopt a more invasive growth 
pattern.7–9 Thus, the systemic administration of BEV has exhibited limited effects on 
glioma progression and, reduction of the BEV dose to physiological levels is desirable. 
Therefore, defining a delivery method at a lower dose with lesser systemic adverse 
events and good therapeutic effect is both necessary and important.

In the present study, we compared the therapeutic effect 
of intratumoral (IT) low-dose BEV treatment and intravenous 
(IV) high-dose BEV treatment in glioma-bearing animals 
with respect to the therapeutic effect and tumor-invasion 
capacity in glioma-bearing mice. The results showed that the 
administration of BEV by IT injection might be an effective 
protocol for treating gliomas by regulating the expression 
of inflammation- and invasion-related factors and inhibiting 
cancer stem cells [glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs)]; 
these findings help provide direction to future clinical trials 
of BEV using this novel drug-delivery method.
Materials and methods
human glioma cells stably expressing the 
luciferase reporter gene
Lentiviral particles carrying the luciferase (luc) reporter gene 
were provided by the Qiang Zhao Xing Y
e Company. U251 
and U87 cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, People’s Republic 
of China) and transfected as previously described.10 Forty-
eight hours after transfection, positive cells were sorted by 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), according to the 
expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Mouse tumor model
All animals used in this study were from the Laboratory 
Animal Center of the Academy of Military Medical Sci-
ences of China (Beijing). All animal experiments were 
approved by the Ethical Committee of the Chinese PLA 
General Hospital (Beijing, People’s Republic of China). 
The procedures in this study were conducted in accordance 
with the guidelines for the use of experimental animals 
from the National Institutes of Health. U251 or U87 glioma 
cells expressing the luc reporter gene (1 × 106 cells in 5 μL 
PBS) were implanted into the brains of anesthetized athymic 
nu/nu mice: a median incision of ~1 cm was made, a burr 
hole was drilled into the skull, and cells were injected into 
the right striatum. The cell suspension in PBS (5 μL) was 
injected at the rate of 1 μL min−1 at a depth of 3 mm. Seven 
days after tumor cell transplantation, the animals divided 
into three groups (n=10 in each group): 1) untreated, 2) IT 
BEV, and 3) IV BEV. In the IV treatment group, BEV was 
administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg via a tail-vein catheter once 
weekly (four injections in 28 days). The total BEV dose in 
the IV group was 20 mg/kg for 28 days. For the IT treatment 
group, an Alzet pump (Alzet, Cupertino, CA, USA) was 
implanted into each mouse as as previously described.11,12 
Briefly, mice were anesthetized and the osmotic pump was 
placed into a subcutaneous pocket in the dorsal region. A 
cannula was implanted through the same hole used for glioma 
transplantation and was sealed with dental cement before it 
was connected to the pump. The pumps were filled up with 
vehicle (PBS), or BEV (25 μg μL−1) was delivered into the 
tumor continuously by direct IT delivery via an Alzet micro-
osmotic pump at a total dose of 10 mg/kg for 28 days, which 
was half the dose that was used in the IV group for 28 days. 
Untreated tumor-bearing mice received PBS using the Alzet 
micro-osmotic pump as described earlier. After the treatment 
was completed (28 days), the animals were maintained with-
out any treatment until they died spontaneously.
Bioluminescence imaging in vivo
Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to assess tumor 
growth and calculate tumor volumes. Briefly, BLI was carried 
out in vivo using the NightOWL LB 983 in vivo Imaging 
System. Mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injec-
tion of 10% chloral hydrate (0.03 mg/kg). D-luciferin (Sigma) 
dissolved in saline was then injected intraperitoneally at a 
dose of 100 mg/kg body weight. Immediately after the injec-
tion, a series of bioluminescent images was acquired with 
2-minutes acquisition intervals for approximately 20 minutes, 
by which time, the luciferin had been washed out. The image 
with the peak BLI intensity was used for quantification in 
units of photon counts.
histology and immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded sections of brain tissues were deparaf-
finized by placing slides into three changes of xylene, fol-
lowed by rehydration in graded ethanol. Then, hematoxylin 
staining was carried out and sections were rinsed with water 
until the slice became blue. Color separation was carried out 
using 70% alcohol, following by rinsing with water. The 
sections were stained with 1% eosin for 5–10 minutes, and 
then rinsed with distilled water. Thereafter, a gradient ethanol 
dehydration was undertaken. Finally, the sections were sealed 
with neutral resin, and observed by light microscopy.
For histological analysis, sections were incubated with 
anti-CD31, sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), matrix 
metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), or cold-inducible RNA-
binding protein (CIRP; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) 
antibodies at 4°C overnight, washed thrice with PBS, and 
incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies for 
1 hour. Images were acquired using a microscope. Microvessel 
density (MVD) was determined by immune-staining with 
CD31. The numbers of SOX2, MMP-9, or CIRP-positive 
cells per field were counted by ImageJ and divided by the

outcome was defined as the percentage of positive cells/field 
and was the mean value calculated in 10 high-power micro-
scopic fields.
statistical analysis
All data were expressed as the mean ± SD. Differences 
between the two groups were assessed by the unpaired 
Student’s t-test, which is used to test differences in the data 
obtained from two groups of independent samples using 
SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). 
Survival time was calculated from the date of tumor injection 
to the date of death, the log-rank test was used to determine 
statistical significance. A p-value ,0.05 was considered 
indicative of statistical significance in the tests conducted.
Results
establishment of stable glioma cell lines 
carrying luc
Lentivirus vectors carrying luc (Figure 1A) were transfected 
into U251 and U87 cells. The vectors and the resultant len-
tivirus carried GFP; therefore, infection efficiency in U251 
and U87 cells was estimated by GFP expression. High-GFP-
expression luc+ U251 and U87 cells were sorted by FACS. 
After sorting, almost all of cells showed strong GFP signal 
(Figure 1B).
iT BeV treatment at a lower dose could 
inhibit tumor growth
U251-luc and U87-luc cells were implanted into the brains 
of NOD/SCID mice and tumor growth was monitored with 
BLI. At Day 7 after cell implantation, animals were divided 
into three groups randomly (untreated, IT BEV, and IV 
BEV) and, tumor growth was monitored with BLI every 
week (Figure 2). In U251 tumor-bearing animals, BLI signal 
intensity of the IT BEV-treated mice was the lowest among 
the three groups. The BLI signal intensity of IV-treated mice 
was lower than that of untreated mice. Moreover, results 
from the U87 tumor-bearing animals confirmed that the BLI 
signal intensity of the IT-treated group was significantly 
lower than that in the IV-treated or untreated groups. These 
results indicated that administration of BEV – either IV or 
IT – decreased tumor growth; however, IT BEV treatment 
was more efficient than IV BEV treatment.
Outcome of histology was consistent 
with that of Bli
Tumor tissues were obtained from animals at Day 28 after 
treatment. Representative photographs of hematoxylin & 
eosin (HE)-stained brain sections from untreated, IV BEV, 
or IT BEV-treated mice are shown in Figure 3. Volumes of 
tumors in different groups were estimated on the images of 
HE-stained sections using Image-Pro PLUS software. For 
both U251 and U87 tumor-bearing animals, a significant 
decrease of tumor volumes was observed in mice from IV 
or IT BEV-treated groups as compared to untreated mice 
(U251: untreated vs IV, p=0.0138; untreated vs IT, p=0.0008; 
U87: untreated vs IV, p=0.0025; untreated vs IT, p=0.0002). 
More importantly, there was an apparent difference in tumor 
volumes between IV BEV and IT BEV-treated mice (U251: 
IT vs IV, p=0.0012; U87: IT vs IV p=0.0088). These data 
were in agreement with the results of BLI tracing.

iT BeV treatment increased survival 
of mice
To estimate the effect of delivery method on clinical outcome, 
we examined the survival of mice with glioma xenografts 
after IV or IT BEV treatment. Data from U251 tumor-bearing 
animals showed that BEV treatment significantly increased 
the survival time of glioma models. Moreover, the mice 
in the IT BEV treatment group survived longer than those 
in the IV treatment group, with a median survival of 40 days 
for the IT group, 27 days for the IV group, and 17 days for 
the untreated group (untreated vs IT, p=0.0083; IV vs IT, 
p=0.0042; Figure 4A).
Furthermore, we observed a significant prolongation of 
survival time in U87 tumor-bearing animals after IT BEV

abnormal tumor blood vessels. In the present study, we ana-
lyzed the MVD of tumor by immunostaining for CD31 – a 
vessel-density marker to quantify the number of blood vessels 
(Figure 5). Not surprisingly, U251 tumors showed a marked 
reduction in the relative density of blood vessels in BEV-
treated animals, compared with untreated controls (p,0.01); 
moreover, the data showed that IT BEV significantly reduced 
the density of tumor blood vessels as compared with that 
in the IV group (approximately 50% reduction, p,0.01). 
Further, results from the U87 tumor-bearing animals showed 
approximately 40% reduction of blood vessels in the IT 
BEV group as compared with those in the IV BEV-treated 
group (p,0.05).
iT BeV treatment decreased cancer 
stem cells
To determine whether the method of drug delivery had an 
effect on CSCs, tumor tissues from different groups were 
analyzed for SOX2 – the marker for CSCs. The results 
showed that the number of SOX2+ cells within the tumors 
of the BEV-treated groups was significant less than in the 
untreated group (U251: control vs IV, p=0.04; control 
vs IT, p=0.0023. U87: control vs IV, p=0.02; control vs IT, 
p=0.0012). More importantly, SOX2+ cells in the tumors of 
the IT group decreased significantly as compared to that of 
the IV group (p,0.002; Figures 6 and 7).
invasive factors of tumors decreased 
after iT BeV treatment
Previous studies have reported that BEV treatment affected 
the invasive pattern of glioblastoma in vivo and vitro. Here, 
we evaluated the level of invasion-related factor MMP-9 in 
tumors from the IT or IV groups by immunostaining. The 
results from both U251 and U87 cells showed that MMP-9 
expression in the xenograft tumors of IT group was signifi-
cantly lower than that of the IV-treated group (Figure 8).
Inflammatory factors of tumors increased 
after iT BeV treatment
Inflammatory responses are important to inhibit tumor pro-
gression; therefore, we tested whether there were differences 
in the inflammatory response as a result of the BEV delivery 
method. Tissues from different groups were analyzed for 
the expression of CIRP – an important inflammatory factor 
mediating brain injury (Figure 9). Our results showed 
significantly increased CIRP expression in tumors from IT 
BEV-treated mice compared with IV BEV-treated mice (for 
U251, p=0.0097; for U87 cells, p=0.006).
Discussion
BEV – a VEGF-neutralizing antibody – is the most developed 
and successful treatment for glioblastoma. Currently, sys-
temic high-dose administration is the main delivery method 
of BEV in glioma. However, with widespread use of BEV, 
Figure 5 iT BeV treatment decreased the MVD. Tumor tissues from the different groups were immunostained for blood vessels using cD31. (A) histological specimens 
show fewer blood vessels in iT BeV-treated tumors than in untreated or iV BeV-treated specimens. scale bar, 100 μm. (B) statistical analysis for the relative number of

Bevacizumab administered as intracranial injection in glioma
both inevitable and unexpected adverse vascular events have 
been observed.13–15 It is well known that VEGF is secreted by 
glioma cells and exists in the interstitial spaces of tumor cells. 
It interacts with VEGF receptors on endothelial cells of blood 
vessels and opens up the tumor–blood interface.16 Therefore, 
the location of BEV was critical, and we speculated that 
when BEV was directly delivered into the interstitial space, 
it could eliminate the VEGF secreted by glioma cells more 
effectively and the dose needed would be lower. To test this 
hypothesis, glioma animal models were treated with BEV 
10 mg/kg intravenously or 5 mg/kg intratumorally (half the 
dose of the IV treatment) weekly. Then, we analyzed the 
effects of the BEV delivery method on tumor growth by 
in vivo bioluminescence imaging – a noninvasive labora-
tory and clinical imaging technique at the molecular level 
that can monitor the localization, proliferation, migration, 
and differentiation of cells in vivo.17 Herein, we found that 
luciferase activity in IT BEV-treated groups were much lower

than that in the IV BEV-treated and untreated groups, which 
proved that IT BEV treatment at a lower dose could inhibit 
tumor growth more efficiently than the IV BEV method. 
To further confirm the outcome of BLI, the brains of mice 
in different groups were isolated at Day 28 after BEV treat-
ment. We found the results from histology were in accordance 
with those from BLI, which proved that BLI could offer a 
rapid and accurate means for studying tumor cell growth and 
response to therapy in animal models.
Next, we examined animal survival in different groups 
after BEV treatment. The results showed that the animal 
survival time of mice in the BEV-treated group was up to 
3 times longer than in the control group. In addition, the mice 
treated with BEV intratumorally by Alzet micro-osmotic 
pumps survived longer than those treated systemically.
Glioblastoma displays remarkable cellular heterogeneity 
and differentiation hierarchy, because cancer cells contain 
GSCs that are able to self-renew, differentiate, vascularize, 
and become resistant to therapy.18,19 To interrogate the 
potential link between the drug-delivery method and tumor

Bevacizumab administered as intracranial injection in glioma
invasion may be a result of the upregulation of enzymes which 
are responsible for the breakdown of extracellular matrix, 
such as MMPs.20–22 In the MMP family, MMP-9 is one of 
the most common metalloproteinases associated with neo-
vascularization and tumor cell migration.23 Here, an expected 
anti-angiogenic effect was observed in both the IV and IT 
BEV-administration groups that were accompanied by a much 
reduced MVD at 4 weeks after drug treatment. Simultaneously 
however, strong expression of MMP-9 was found in tumors 
after BEV treatment. However, we observed a less invasive 
pattern of tumor growth in IT BEV-treated mice than in the IV 
groups with lower levels of MMP-9, which clearly indicated 
that IT BEV treatment at a low dose could alleviate invasion 
after long-term exposure to anti-VEGF therapy.
Inflammatory actions have been shown to play an 
important role in regulating the immune response to tumor, 
and proinflammatory factors are key to blocking tumor 
progression.24 Recent studies have revealed that extracellular 
CIRP is an important mediator in neuro-inflammation, which 
could induce release of tumor necrosis factor-α through acti-
vation of the NF-κB pathway.25,26 Our data demonstrated a 
stronger expression of CIRP in tumors from the IT group, 
which implied the IT delivery of BEV may delay tumor 
growth by an intense inflammatory response.
Venous thromboembolism was one of the most popular 
side effects of IV BEV treatment; therefore, hemorheologi-
cal parameters could be an important reference for the risk 
of thromboembolism. We measured the hemorheological

characteristics of mice after BEV treatment and found that 
low-dose IT BEV treatment could decrease the risk of throm-
boembolism with a lower viscosity, when compared with IV 
treatment (data not shown).
In this study, untreated mice in whom the IT route was 
used were regarded as controls. For a more rationalized com-
parison, we examined the tumor volume and survival time 
in untreated mice in whom the IV route was used (tumor-
bearing mice received PBS intravenously) and found there 
were no significant differences between these two groups of 
untreated mice (Figure S1).
Conclusion
Localized BEV delivery by Alzet micro-osmotic pumps is 
more effective in reducing tumor size and tumor cell infil-
tration when compared with systemic administration. Thus, 
IT BEV delivery could be considered a good alternative to 
IV BEV administration. The identification of this fact paves 
the first step in the development of a novel delivery method 
to overcome the side effects of anti-angiogenic agents, and 
is worth investigating further.
