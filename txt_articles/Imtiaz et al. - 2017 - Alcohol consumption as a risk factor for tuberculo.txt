ABSTRACT
Meta-analyses of alcohol use, alcohol dosage and alcohol-related problems as risk factors for
tuberculosis incidence were undertaken. The global alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease was
also re-estimated.
Systematic searches were conducted, reference lists were reviewed and expert consultations were held to
identify studies. Cohort and case-control studies were included if there were no temporal violations of
exposure and outcome. Risk relations (RRs) were pooled by using categorical and dose-response meta-
analyses. The alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease was estimated by using alcohol-
attributable fractions.
36 of 1108 studies were included. RRs for alcohol use and alcohol-related problems were 1.35 (95% CI
1.09–1.68; I2: 83%) and 3.33 (95% CI 2.14–5.19; 87%), respectively. Concerning alcohol dosage,
tuberculosis risk rose as ethanol intake increased, with evidence of a threshold effect. Alcohol consumption
caused 22.02 incident cases (95% CI 19.70–40.77) and 2.35 deaths (95% CI 2.05–4.79) per 100000 people
from tuberculosis in 2014. Alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence increased between 2000 and 2014 in
most high tuberculosis burden countries, whereas mortality decreased.
Alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis in all meta-analyses. It was
consequently a major contributor to the tuberculosis burden of disease.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
TUBERCULOSIS
 Introduction
Although the incidence of tuberculosis has been declining since 2000, 10.4 million incident cases were
estimated globally in 2015 [1]. Tuberculosis also caused an estimated 1.4 million deaths globally during the
same time frame, surpassing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and bolstering its status as a leading
cause of death [1]. As such, tuberculosis is a major infectious cause of the global burden of disease; it
contributes 1.6% of all disability-adjusted life years and 2.0% of all deaths, according to the Global Burden
of Disease Study 2015 [2].
An important risk factor for tuberculosis is alcohol consumption, particularly heavy consumption [3, 4]. A
meta-analysis conducted by LÖNNROTH et al. [3], which included studies published up to 2007, indicated
that alcohol consumption of more than 40 g of ethanol per day or a diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder
resulted in a nearly three-fold increase in the risk of tuberculosis. Based on this meta-analysis, alcohol
consumption was estimated to be responsible for approximately 10% of all incident cases and deaths due
to tuberculosis [4]. Since then a number of relevant studies have been published, which allow separate
meta-analyses to be conducted of alcohol use, alcohol dosage (including assessment of a threshold effect)
and alcohol-related problems as risk factors for tuberculosis. In particular, meta-analyses of the dose–
response relationship are of special importance, as these effects have been long suspected and are observed
for other infectious diseases [4, 5]. In addition, the alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease can
be re-estimated based on updated risk relations (RRs), which may guide decision makers towards
prevention and treatment interventions.
As such, the objectives of the present study were two-fold. First, meta-analyses of alcohol use, alcohol
dosage and alcohol-related problems as risk factors for tuberculosis incidence (including recurrence) were
conducted based on cohort and case-control studies. Second, alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence
and mortality rates in 2014 were estimated for the 196 member states of the World Health Organization
(WHO).
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
Meta-analyses of study-level observational data were undertaken and reported according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRIMSA) guidelines [6]. Electronic searches
were carried out for relevant studies in the PubMed database, as well as in a comprehensive tuberculosis
studies database housed at the Global TB Programme of the WHO. The search strategies for these
databases were identical to those operationalised in the prior meta-analysis by LÖNNROTH et al. [3]. As the
prior meta-analysis by LÖNNROTH et al. [3] included studies published up to 2007, the present search
identified studies published between January 2007 and June 2016. In addition to the above-mentioned
database searches, the reference lists of all included studies were reviewed and expert consultations (with
K. Lönnroth and J. Rehm) were held to further identify relevant studies. No language restrictions were
applied and grey literature was included, but authors were not contacted.
Relevant studies were initially screened based on titles and abstracts, followed by full-text assessments.
Inclusion criteria consisted of 1) cohort or case-control study design, 2) reporting of RRs for alcohol
consumption as a risk factor for tuberculosis (such as relative risks, hazard ratios or odds ratios), or
provision of sufficient information for the calculation of RRs, and 3) inclusion of tuberculosis incidence,
new or recurrent, as an end-point. Relevant studies were excluded if they were not based on the most
recent alcohol consumption exposure prior to or at the time of tuberculosis incidence or recurrence
diagnosis, as alcohol consumption has been shown to decrease thereafter [7]. For example, case–control
studies were excluded that enquired about current alcohol consumption at the time of interview from
prevalent tuberculosis cases, as were cohort studies of tuberculosis recurrence that were based on alcohol
consumption measured at baseline (i.e. not after the first treatment episode). Relevant studies with unclear
temporal relationships were included as part of sensitivity analyses. Further details on the search strategy
and selection criteria are available in appendix A.
Tuberculosis case definition
Tuberculosis was defined based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes A15–A19, as well as corresponding ICD-8 and ICD-9
codes.
Alcohol consumption assessment
Alcohol consumption was operationalised as alcohol use, alcohol dosage and alcohol-related problems.
Alcohol use corresponded to measurements of lifetime or current use, as well as other qualitative and
frequency-based measurements. Past alcohol use denoted measurements of former use (i.e. not current
https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00216-2017

 use). Alcohol dosage referred to measurements of ethanol (pure alcohol) intake in grammes per day. The
midpoints of ethanol intake categories were calculated, whereas three-quarters of the second-highest
category’s range was added to the lower limit of open-ended categories. Conversion factors were applied
when standard drinks were the unit of measurement. Depending on the country, one standard drink
contains 8–14 g of ethanol [8]. Alcohol-related problems included measurements of alcohol use disorders,
as well as physical health conditions related to chronic excessive alcohol consumption (e.g. alcoholic
cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholic polyneuropathy). Detailed descriptions of the data extraction and
quality assessment are available in appendix A.
Meta-analyses
The primary outcome was the RR for alcohol consumption as a risk factor for tuberculosis. Categorical
meta-analyses were conducted for alcohol use (versus no alcohol use) and alcohol-related problems (versus
no alcohol-related problems, including abstainers and drinkers) as risk factors for tuberculosis. Inverse
variance weighted DerSimonian–Laird random effects models were used in these analyses to permit
between-study heterogeneity [9]. The Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics were computed to quantify variation in
the RRs due to between-study heterogeneity, whereas p-values from Egger’s regression-based test were
computed for the assessment of publication bias [10–12]. Apart from these analyses, subgroup
meta-analyses were conducted based on stratifications by study design and control for confounding, as
well as based on the tuberculosis burden and problem drinking in the studied country. The stratification
pertaining to the tuberculosis burden was based on the number of tuberculosis cases, as detailed in the
Global Tuberculosis Report 2015 [13], whereas the stratification pertaining to problem drinking was based
on total per capita alcohol consumption among drinkers and patterns of drinking scores from the Global
Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2014 [14].
Linear dose–response meta-analyses were carried out for alcohol dosage as a risk factor for tuberculosis,
where different levels of ethanol intake in grammes per day were modelled in comparison with no alcohol
use (current abstention). Studies required a minimum of three or more ethanol intake categories for
inclusion in the alcohol dosage meta-analyses. These analyses involved linear two-stage meta-regression
models as described elsewhere [15]. In addition, categorical dose−response meta-analyses were conducted
to investigate a potential threshold effect, using the categories of ⩽24 g, >24 to ⩽60 g and >60 g of ethanol
intake per day (all versus no alcohol use). As before, publication bias was assessed by using Egger’s
regression-based test[14].
All meta-analyses were conducted using Stata Statistical Software Version 14.1.
Burden of disease analyses
The alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease included incidence and mortality, which were
estimated by using alcohol-attributable fractions [16]. These fractions estimate the proportion of
tuberculosis incidence and mortality that would not have occurred under the theoretical minimum
exposure of lifetime alcohol abstention [17]. As part of these estimations, alcohol consumption status data
from 2012 (the latest year for which data were available) were combined with per capita alcohol
consumption data from 2014 [14, 18, 19]. Alcohol consumption among current drinkers was modelled by
using a continuous Gamma distribution (see references [16, 19] for the exact formulae). Alcohol consumption
data were subsequently combined with the RRs from the linear dose–response meta-analyses to generate the
alcohol-attributable fractions. Uncertainty intervals were generated by using 40000 Monte Carlo-like draws of
all lowest level parameters [20]. The alcohol-attributable fractions were then applied to the tuberculosis
incidence and mortality data from 2014, as obtained from the publically available Global Tuberculosis
Database [21]. The alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease was estimated for the 196 member
states, organised into six regions of the WHO in 2014. Comparisons of changes between 2000 and 2014 were
also performed for the 22 high tuberculosis burden countries (same definition as above) [13]. Although both
crude numbers and crude rates were generated, only the latter are discussed throughout the results.
Compliance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER)
Statement was ensured [22]. All burden of disease analyses were conducted using R Software Version 3.3.1.
Further details on the methodology of the burden of disease analyses are presented in appendix B.
Ethics approval
Research ethics committee review and approval were not required, as aggregate data were extracted from
published studies.
Results
The search strategy yielded 1108 relevant studies after duplicates were excluded (see figure S1 in appendix
D for the PRISMA flow chart and checklist supplement for the PRISMA checklist). Based on title and

 abstract screening, 1015 of these studies were excluded, whereas 93 underwent full-text assessments. After
completion of the full-text assessments, 36 studies in three languages (English, Portuguese and Chinese)
were included in the meta-analyses [7, 23–57]. Among the included studies, eight were cohort studies and
28 were case-control studies. There was representation from all WHO regions, with the exception of the
Eastern Mediterranean Region, as well as representation from several high tuberculosis burden countries,
including India, China, South Africa, Russia and Brazil. Detailed descriptions of the included studies are
presented in tables S1 and S2 in appendix D. From these included studies, 15 were part of the
meta-analyses of alcohol use, four were part of the meta-analyses of alcohol dosage and eight were part of
the meta-analyses of alcohol-related problems.
The RRs from the categorical meta-analyses of alcohol use as a risk factor for tuberculosis are presented in
table 1 (see also tables S3 and S4 in appendix D for the sex-specific RRs) [7, 23–45]. Alcohol use was
associated with a 35% higher risk of tuberculosis compared to no alcohol use (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09–1.68).
In some of the included studies, the reference categories of the alcohol consumption exposure included
alcohol users (e.g. alcohol use never or less than or equal to 2 days per week versus alcohol use more than
2 days per week). There was an additional increase in tuberculosis risk once such studies were included in
the meta-analyses. Past alcohol use was not significantly associated with a higher risk of tuberculosis
compared to no alcohol use (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.67–3.43) (table S5 in appendix D).
Regression coefficients from the linear dose-response meta-analyses of alcohol dosage as a risk factor for
tuberculosis are presented in table 2 [24, 25, 28, 35, 39]. The tuberculosis risk rose as ethanol intake in
grammes per day increased: RR at 25 g per day: 1.57, 95% CI 1.10–2.23; RR at 50 g per day: 2.46, 95% CI
1.21–4.98; RR at 75 g per day; 3.85, 95% CI 1.33–11.11; and RR at 100 g per day: 6.03, 95% CI 1.47–24.81.
The RRs from the related categorical dose-response meta-analyses are presented in table S6 in appendix
D. The RRs were non-significant for the ⩽24 and > 24 to ⩽60 categories of ethanol intake in grammes per
day, but became significant thereafter along with increases in magnitude. Ethanol intake of more than 60 g

 per day was associated with a 68% higher risk of tuberculosis compared to no alcohol use (RR 1.68, 95%
CI 1.22–2.31).
Alcohol-related problems were associated with greater than a three-fold higher risk of tuberculosis compared
to no alcohol-related problems (RR 3.33, 95% CI 2.14–5.19) [46–57]. All RRs from the categorical
meta-analyses of alcohol-related problems as a risk factor for tuberculosis are presented in table 3.
As indicated by the Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics, substantial between-study heterogeneity was detected.
The subgroup meta-analyses based on the specified stratifications did not lead to extensive reductions in
between-study heterogeneity, although there were a few exceptions. All p-values obtained from the Egger’s
regression-based test for publication bias were non-significant. Inclusion of studies that did not provide
sufficient information for the ascertainment of alcohol consumption exposure timing did not lead to
substantial changes in the overall pattern of findings. For a further discussion of the results pertaining to
between-study heterogeneity, publication bias and sensitivity analyses, refer to appendix C.
Based on the RRs from the linear dose-response meta-analyses, alcohol consumption was estimated to have
caused 1587449 incident cases of tuberculosis (95% CI 1420559–2939075) globally in 2014, corresponding
to 22.02 cases per 100000 people (95% CI 19.70–40.77) (see also the GATHER checklist in the checklist

 supplement). The regional alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence estimates are presented in table 4,
whereas the country-level estimates are displayed in figure 1 (see also table S7 in appendix D for the data).
At the regional level, alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence was the highest in the African Region,
followed by the South-East Asia Region and it was the lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Countries that featured alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence more than five times higher than the
global average all belonged to the African Region: Swaziland, Gabon, Namibia, Lesotho and South Africa.
Alcohol consumption was also estimated to have caused 169721 tuberculosis deaths (95% CI 148111–
345658) globally in 2014 (2.35 deaths per 100000 people, 95% CI 2.05–4.79). The regional- and
country-level estimates of alcohol-attributable tuberculosis mortality are presented in table 4 and figure 2,
respectively (see also table S8 in appendix D for the data). The African Region featured the highest
alcohol-attributable tuberculosis mortality, followed by the South-East Asia Region, whereas the lowest
impacts were evident in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Countries exhibiting alcohol-attributable
tuberculosis mortality that was more than five times higher than the global average included Liberia,
Angola, South Africa, Lesotho, Gabon, Namibia and Nigeria; all countries belonging to the African
Region.
Changes in alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence and mortality between 2000 and 2014 among the
22 high tuberculosis burden countries are displayed in figures 3 and 4, respectively (see also tables S9 and
S10 in appendix D for the data). Alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence increased in most high
tuberculosis burden countries during the examined time period, with a mean percentage increase of 50%

 Alcohol-attributable tuberculosis mortality decreased in most high-tuberculosis-burden countries between
2000 and 2014, with a mean percentage decrease of 32% (range 6–62%). These decreases were particularly
pronounced in Philippines and Uganda, where percentage decreases exceeded 50%. Despite these decreases,
alcohol-attributable tuberculosis mortality increased in 10 other countries (mean percentage increase 35%,
range 7–121%), with percentage increases surpassing 50% in Kenya, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.
Discussion
Summary of findings
Alcohol use, alcohol dosage and alcohol-related problems were examined as risk factors for tuberculosis
through meta-analyses of cohort and case-control studies. All three classifications were associated with an
increased risk of tuberculosis. As problems are associated with higher consumption [58], the dose-response
meta-analyses suggest higher attributable tuberculosis burden of disease at the highest levels of alcohol
consumption. Based on meta-analyses of alcohol dosage, the alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of
disease was also estimated. Alcohol consumption was a major contributor to the tuberculosis burden of
disease, with the most severe impacts estimated for the African Region.
Strengths and limitations
There are some notable strengths of the present study that deserve mention. Separate in-depth
meta-analyses were conducted of alcohol use, alcohol dosage and alcohol-related problems as risk factors
for tuberculosis. In particular, meta-analyses of alcohol dosage represent an important extension of prior
research, as dose−response effects had been long suspected and were observed for other infectious
diseases [4]. Apart from the in-depth meta-analyses, special attention was paid to the alcohol
consumption exposure timing in the study selection, which diminished the risk of biasing the
relationships. In addition to the meta-analyses, the alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease was
estimated based on the updated RRs.
Despite the strengths of the present study, there are some limitations of the meta-analyses that should be
considered. To be consistent with the meta-analysis conducted by LÖNNROTH et al. [3], the database
searches were limited to the two databases specified, which may have missed other relevant studies. A
distinction between drug-susceptible tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was not made, as
alcohol consumption was considered to influence the risk in a similar manner. There is nonetheless some

 evidence to suggest that alcohol consumption impacts tuberculosis treatment compliance, leading to
subsequent acquired drug resistance [59]. Several measurements of alcohol consumption in the included
studies were susceptible to social desirability and recall biases (e.g. measurements from self-reported
questionnaires), as well as misclassification bias (e.g. measurements from health administrative databases).
Measurements of alcohol consumption in the included cohort studies did not account for changes over
time, whereas not all measurements of alcohol-related problems were based on standardised diagnostic
criteria. Additionally, there were a number of included studies that ascertained tuberculosis diagnosis from
health administrative databases. These limitations may also have resulted also in misclassification bias.
Apart from the limitations concerning measurements, substantial between-study heterogeneity was
detected, which persisted in the subgroup meta-analyses. This can be attributed to differences between the
included studies, such as sources of recruitment of participants, types of participants, definitions of alcohol
consumption and definitions of tuberculosis. The low number of included studies also resulted in some
underpowered
subgroup meta-analyses, and
precluded the quantification of
sex-specific
RRs
in
meta-analyses of alcohol dosage and alcohol-related problems.
There are also limitations of the burden of disease analyses. Alcohol consumption data were based on
surveys and government statistics, with the former susceptible to issues of coverage and social desirability
and recall biases. Dynamic modelling was not operationalised in these analyses, which precluded
determination of the secondary effects of tuberculosis transmission from alcohol users to others.
Additionally, the impact on mortality resulting from delayed diagnosis or treatment incompliance due to
alcohol consumption was not considered. Based on these modelling decisions, the alcohol-attributable
fractions should be considered conservative.
Comparison with other studies
In a previous meta-analysis related to the topic, LÖNNROTH et al. [3] showed that alcohol consumption of
more than 40 g of ethanol per day or a diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder was associated with a nearly
three-fold higher risk of tuberculosis (RR 2.94, 95% CI 1.89–4.59) compared with no alcohol consumption
or alcohol consumption below the specified thresholds. Although not directly comparable, the findings of
LÖNNROTH et al. [3] are consistent with the RRs from the present meta-analyses of alcohol dosage and
alcohol-related problems. Furthermore, the threshold effect of alcohol consumption was investigated in a
sex-stratified case–control study [60]. The risk of tuberculosis was nonsignificant for males with an ethanol
intake of less than 38 g per day, but significantly increased four-fold thereafter [60]. Alcohol consumption
was not associated with tuberculosis for females [60]. The threshold effect observed in the case–control
study was slightly lower than that estimated in the present meta-analyses (38 versus 60 g of ethanol intake
per day) [60]. As such, further confirmation of the threshold effect is needed, especially as the category of
>24 to ⩽60 g of ethanol intake per day included only one study in the present meta-analyses.
The alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease on the other hand has not been frequently
estimated
[61].
In
the
most
comparable
iteration
of
the
Global
Burden
of
Disease
Study,
alcohol-attributable tuberculosis mortality totalled 155000 deaths (86000–200000) in 2013 [62]. This is
largely consistent with the mortality estimates generated in the present study. The minor variation in
estimates can be attributed to the modelling time frame, as well as to the choice of RRs and consequential
modelling strategy, as the Global Burden of Disease Study operationalised the RRs computed by LÖNNROTH
et al. [3].
Explanations and implications
The relationship between alcohol consumption and tuberculosis can be explained by two causal pathways
[3, 4]. First, alcohol consumption impairs the immune system, which increases susceptibility to
tuberculosis infection, as well as to reactivation of latent tuberculosis [3, 4]. The ability of alveolar
macrophages to respond to newly introduced pathogens is compromised by alcohol consumption [63];
under
normal
circumstances
these
macrophages
eliminate
most
mycobacteria
[64].
Specifically,
mobilisation and adherence of macrophages is suppressed and phagocytosis of mycobacteria and
superoxide production are impacted [65–69]. In addition, monocytes’ production of cytokines that regulate
inflammation is limited by alcohol consumption [70, 71]. The macrophages’ ability to respond to these
cytokines and present mycobacterial antigens to lymphocytes is also reduced, and antigen-specific T-cell
activation is impaired [69–71]. As a result of these changes, the immune system’s ability to respond to new
and dormant mycobacteria is severely diminished [72]. Apart from direct influences on the immune
system, alcohol consumption is associated with malnutrition, liver disease and social drift, all of which
impact the maintenance of innate and acquired immune systems [72–76]. Second, alcohol consumption
leads to presence in social environments that facilitate the spread of tuberculosis infection [3, 4]. Examples
of such environments include bars, shelters, prisons and social institutions, which have been implicated in
molecular-epidemiological studies [77–79].

 Regarding the burden of disease, alcohol consumption was responsible for 17% of incident cases and 15%
of deaths due to tuberculosis. Alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence increased with tuberculosis
incidence, as expected; however, an important exception was the Eastern Mediterranean Region, where
tuberculosis incidence was the third highest [21], but alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence was the
lowest, given the low alcohol consumption [14, 18]. This trend was less apparent in the case of
alcohol-attributable
tuberculosis
mortality.
The
European
Region
featured
the
third
highest
alcohol-attributable tuberculosis mortality, despite having one of the lowest tuberculosis mortality rates [21];
this was driven by high alcohol consumption, as determined by both the proportion of current drinkers
and total per capita alcohol consumption [14, 18]. Concerning changes between 2000 and 2014, the global
tuberculosis burden of disease has been declining for almost the past two decades. There are still important
differences in the extent of these declines, as the reductions in tuberculosis mortality compared to incidence
have been significantly larger (38% versus 18% cumulative rate reductions between 2000 and 2014,
respectively) [21]. Nonetheless, the tuberculosis burden of disease decreased during the examined time
period in the overwhelming majority of the high tuberculosis burden countries, with a few exceptions from
the African Region [21]. It therefore follows that increases in the alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of
disease in these countries were due primarily to increases in alcohol consumption.
The global strategy for tuberculosis control has evolved to incorporate a broader preventative focus [80]. This
shift has been a consequence of lower than expected reductions in the tuberculosis burden of disease,
especially its incidence [81, 82]. Findings from the present study emphasise one important component of the
current global strategy for tuberculosis control: the necessity of interventions to prevent heavy alcohol
consumption and alcohol-related problems, as well as to address shared social determinants of health [80].
This component is based on the rationale that targeting risk factors and social determinants of health will
supplement cutting transmission chains, which will further reduce the tuberculosis burden of disease [81, 83].
Indeed, it is relevant to a number of countries that have observed increases in alcohol consumption,
including high tuberculosis burden countries. To that end, interventions can be implemented to reduce the
harms of alcohol consumption, including regulation of the environment in which alcohol is marketed,
especially its price and availability, as well as individually directed interventions for those with at-risk levels of
alcohol consumption [84]. However, targeting shared social determinants of health will produce greater
public health benefits, which can be addressed by the frameworks for action developed by the Commission
on Social Determinants of Health [85].
In addition to tuberculosis control, findings from the present study emphasise that addressing heavy
alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems are of relevance for eventual tuberculosis elimination,
particularly in low-incidence settings [86]. This is because as the incidence of tuberculosis decreases, it
becomes more and more concentrated among vulnerable risk groups, including those with heavy alcohol
consumption and alcohol-related problems [86]. As such, on top of the prevention interventions described
above, training and awareness initiatives for relevant healthcare professionals should be considered,
especially as they relate to assisting with access to and navigation of tuberculosis care [86].
Conclusion
Alcohol use, alcohol dosage and alcohol-related problems were all associated with an increased risk of
tuberculosis in meta-analyses of cohort and case–control studies. Based on the updated meta-analyses,
alcohol consumption was a major contributor to the tuberculosis burden of disease, particularly in the
African Region. As such, alcohol control policies have an instrumental role to play within the global
strategy for tuberculosis control.
