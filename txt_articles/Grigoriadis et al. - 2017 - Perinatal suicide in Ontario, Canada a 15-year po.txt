n developed countries, maternal suicide is a leading cause 
of death during pregnancy and the first postpartum year.1–5 
Existing Canadian data suggest that suicide is the fourth 
leading cause of death in the perinatal period.6 However, rates 
may be underestimated, because they typically include only 
“maternal deaths” in pregnancy or up to 6 weeks (42 d) after 
the birth, despite the fact that the burden of suicide related to 
postpartum mental illness is likely to extend beyond 6 weeks 
postpartum.7–9 Furthermore, these rates are based on whether 
the death certificate records pregnancy or recent childbirth. 
Data from Europe suggest that underreporting of perinatal sui-
cide on death certificates is in the range of 26% to 56%,10,11 
given that the presence of a child, or perhaps a birth, does not 
always emerge during the investigation of a death.1,4,9,12,13 
Despite high-profile media attention and calls to increase 
knowledge, with the goal of encouraging policy change, little is 
known about the true extent of the problem in Canada or the 
steps that can be taken to prevent it.14,15 Greater knowledge 
about the suicide rate during pregnancy and the postpartum 
period, as well as the characteristics and patterns of health ser-
vice use of women who die by suicide, is critical to inform sui-
cide prevention strategies for perinatal women, and ultimately 
to reduce maternal mortality. 
In this study, we combined coroner death records with popu-
lation-level health administrative data to study deaths by suicide 
during the perinatal period in Ontario, Canada, over a 15-year 
period. After determination of the perinatal suicide rate, we com-
pared sociodemographic, clinical presentation and health ser-
vice use characteristics of women who died by suicide perinatally 
with those of women who died by suicide during the same period 
but who were not perinatal (non-perinatal group) and with those 
of age-matched living perinatal women (controls).

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Death by suicide during 
the perinatal period has been under-
studied in Canada. We examined the 
epidemiology of and health service use 
related to suicides during pregnancy 
and the first postpartum year.
METHODS: In this retrospective, popula-
tion-based cohort study, we linked health 
administrative databases with coroner 
death records (1994–2008) for Ontario, 
Canada. We compared sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, clinical features 
and health service use in the 30 days and 
1 year before death between women who 
died by suicide perinatally, women who 
died by suicide outside of the perinatal 
period and living perinatal women.
RESULTS: The perinatal suicide rate was 
2.58 per 100 000 live births, with suicide 
accounting for 51 (5.3%) of 966 perinatal 
deaths. Most suicides occurred during 
the final quarter of the first postpartum 
year, with highest rates in rural and 
remote regions. Perinatal women were 
more likely to die from hanging (33.3% 
[17/51]) or jumping or falling (19.6% 
[10/51]) than women who died by suicide 
non-perinatally (p = 0.04). Only 39.2% 
(20/51) had mental health contact within 
the 30 days before death, similar to the 
rate among those who died by suicide 
non-perinatally (47.7% [762/1597]; odds 
ratio [OR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.40–1.25). Compared with living 
peri 
natal women matched by pregnancy 
or postpartum status at date of suicide, 
perinatal women who died by suicide 
had similar likelihood of non–mental 
health primary care and obstetric care 
before the index date but had a lower 
likelihood of pediatric contact (64.5% 
[20/31] v. 88.4% [137/155] at 30 days; OR 
0.24, 95% CI 0.10–0.58).
INTERPRETATION: The perinatal suicide 
rate for Ontario during the period 1994–
2008 was comparable to international 
estimates and represents a substantial 
component of Canadian perinatal mor-
tality. Given that deaths by suicide 
occur throughout the perinatal period, 
all health care providers must be collec-
tively vigilant in assessing risk.

Methods
Data sources and linkage
We extracted primary data, including death certificates and 
reports of postmortem examinations, from the Office of the Chief 
Coroner for Ontario for all women aged 18 to 45 years who died by 
suicide in Ontario, Canada, between 1994 and 2008. We linked cor-
oner records with population-based health administrative data 
housed within the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) 
through probabilistic linkage (names, dates of birth and death, 
postal codes) to Ontario’s Registered Persons Database, which 
contains information for all Ontario residents with a provincial 
health card. Once linked, the records were de-identified and linked 
at ICES to other health administrative databases (Appendix 1, 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj 
. 
170088/-/DC1). The data from these health administrative data 
sources are complete and reliable, with high diagnostic validity for 
hospital admissions; however, from outpatient mental health 
codes alone, it is difficult to ascertain specific diagnoses within the 
mood and anxiety disorder spectrum.16–21
Exposure groups
We classified women who died by suicide as “perinatal” using 
coroner records or health administrative data, where there was a 
pregnancy (at least 2 pregnancy-related ultrasound examina-
tions or a prenatal visit with a family physician or obstetrician 
within the 40 weeks preceding death)22 or hospitalization for 
obstetric delivery within the 365 days before death.23 The timing 
of suicide relative to pregnancy was based on combined informa-
tion from the coroner’s office (including autopsy records for 
pregnant women) and the date of hospital delivery. We dealt 
with discrepancies between coroner and health administrative 
data on a case-by-case basis, with autopsy records taking prece-
dence for possibly pregnant women, and hospital delivery 
records taking precedence for correct classification of postpar-
tum women. We classified all other suicides as non-perinatal, 
except for those within 1 year after an abortion or stillbirth 
(which we excluded from the analyses). 
We created a living perinatal control group based on health 
administrative data by matching the perinatal women with death 
by suicide in a 1:5 ratio with living controls, matched within 
2 years on maternal age and calendar year of birth (or expected 
birth). To facilitate comparisons between groups, we assigned 
each living perinatal control an index date that matched the 
number of weeks of gestation or weeks postpartum of the 
matched perinatal woman who died by suicide.
Variables of interest
We extracted data for demographic and clinical variables from cor-
oner records and health administrative databases (Appendices 1 
and 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170088/-/DC1).19,24 We generated variables for health care use 
using health administrative data. For consistency with the litera-
ture, we defined outpatient mental health contact within 30 days 
and 1 year before suicide25 as either contact with a psychiatrist or a 
mental health visit with a primary care provider, using a validated 
algorithm.26 We recorded psychiatric emergency department visits 
(available for 2002 forward) and psychiatric hospital admissions in 
the 30 days and 1 year before death. We also recorded contact 
with primary care providers for non–mental health reasons, con-
tact with an obstetrician and contact with a pediatrician within 
30 days and 1 year of death (Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170088/-/DC1).
Statistical analysis
We calculated the suicide rate during the perinatal period as 
the number of suicides per 100 000 live births over the course of 
the study period. We determined the proportion of maternal 
deaths attributable to suicide by dividing the number of peri-
natal suicides by the number of maternal perinatal deaths, as 
per health administrative data codes for pregnancy-related 
death (where there was no evidence of delivery or medical or 
spontaneous abortion), or, for postpartum women, the deaths 
that occurred where there was evidence of a delivery in the pre-
ceding 365 days.  
We calculated population age-standardized rates for each 
health region. We present sample characteristics as means, 
medians or proportions, with comparisons between groups, as 
appropriate, on sociodemographic, medical and psychiatric 
history, and suicide characteristics using t tests for continuous 
variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. We compared 
health care use before suicide between groups, generating 
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and using 
logistic regression to compare women who died perinatally 
with those who died non-perinatally and conditional logistic 
regression to compare women who died perinatally with their 
matched living controls. A trained research assistant extracted 
data from cor 
oner records; another member of the research 
team checked 15% of the records to ensure reliability. We per-
formed statistical analyses using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute Inc.) at ICES.
According to Ontario provincial privacy legislation, all data 
values below 6 are considered nonreportable, to avoid the possi-
bility of identifying specific individuals. 
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the research ethics boards of the 
Women’s College Hospital and Sunnybrook Health Sciences 
Centre.
Results
A total of 1914 women died by suicide during the study period, 
according to death records of the Office of the Chief Coroner for 
Ontario; of these, we linked 1695 (88.6%) by probabilistic match-
ing with administrative health data. We excluded an additional 
47 women who did not meet our criteria (Appendix 4, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170088/-/DC1), 
which left 1648 suicides for analysis. Of these, 51 were classified 
as perinatal (20 during pregnancy, 31 during the postpartum 
period), a greater number than would have been classified as 
perinatal using either data source alone (Table 1). The perinatal

suicide rate was 2.58 per 100 000 live births. Suicide accounted 
for 5.3% (51/966 or about 1/19) of deaths in perinatal women in 
Ontario: 4.4% (20/453) of pregnancy-related deaths, and 6.0% 
(31/513) of postpartum deaths.
Death by suicide occurred throughout the perinatal period, but 
the largest numbers of suicides were in the last trimester of preg-
nancy and, especially, the final quarter of the first postpartum year 
(Figure 1). For pregnant women, suicide occurred on average at 
5 months and for postpartum women, at 7.5 months (Figure 1). 
The majority of women who died by suicide lived in either urban 
centres (> 100 000 people)27 or small population centres (< 10 000 
people),27 with the highest rates in the North West Local Health 
Integration Network (LHIN) of Ontario (Appendix 5, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170088/-/DC1). This 
regional distribution was similar to that for death by suicide 
among non-perinatal women. 
The most common means of suicide for perinatal women was 
hanging (33.3% [17/51]), followed by jumping or falling (19.6% 
[10/51]); this differed from the distribution among women who 
died by suicide non-perinatally, among whom overdose was the 
leading cause of death (Appendix 6, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170088/-/DC1). Women who died 
by suicide perinatally were slightly younger than those who died 
by suicide non-perinatally and were more likely to have a part-
ner; neither neighbourhood income quintile nor community size 
differed between these 2 groups (Table 2).
Women who died by suicide in the perinatal period had prior 
medical morbidity (as indicated by mean aggregated diagnosis 
groups) similar to that of the non-perinatal suicide group, but 
greater than that of matched living perinatal controls (Table 2). 
The majority who died by suicide, regardless of group, had an 
affective or anxiety and related disorder, rather than a psychotic 
disorder. The distribution of psychiatric diagnoses in the 5 years 
preceding the suicide (or matched index date for perinatal con-
trols) was similar for the 2 groups who died, whereas the living 
perinatal women had much lower rates of prior psychiatric mor-
bidity. A similar pattern was observed for psychiatric hospitaliza-
tions and history of suicide attempts (Table 2).
About 70.6% (36/51) of perinatal women who died by suicide 
had mental health contact in the year before suicide, with only 
39.2% (20/51) having mental health contact in the 30 days 
before. This level of contact was not significantly different from 
that for the women who died by suicide non-perinatally. How-
ever, there were differences when such contact was broken 
down by type of provider. Women who died by suicide peri-
natally were less likely to have seen a psychiatrist (OR 0.37, 95% 
CI 0.17–0.79), but more likely to have seen a primary care pro-
vider for a mental health reason (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.03–3.16) 
within the year before suicide compared with women who died 
by suicide non-perinatally. Perinatal women who died by suicide 
were far more likely to have had contact with a mental health 
provider in the year before suicide than living perinatal controls 
at their matched index date (70.6% v. 21.6%, OR 8.73, 95% CI 
4.34–17.6; Table 3). Compared with matched living perinatal 
women, perinatal women who died by suicide had similar likeli-
hood of non–mental health primary care (32.5% v. 29.4%; OR 
0.86, 95% CI 0.44–0.71) and obstetric care (67.0% v. 40.0%; OR 
0.33, 95% CI 0.10–1.11) at 30 days before death, but lower likeli-
hood of pediatric contact (64.5% v. 88.4%; OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10–
0.58) (Table 4).

Interpretation
We observed a perinatal suicide rate of 2.58 per 100 000 live 
births, and found that 1 of every 19 maternal deaths in Ontario 
was attributable to suicide. One key finding was that deaths 
occurred across the perinatal period. Also, women who died by 
suicide perinatally tended to use more lethal means than 
women who died by suicide non-perinatally. Furthermore, fewer 
than half of the women who died by suicide during pregnancy or 
the postpartum period had mental health service use in the 
30 days before death, although a substantial proportion had 
contact with other health care professionals, such as obstetri-
cians and pediatricians.
The rate of suicide during pregnancy and the postpartum 
period as reported here lies between rates in the United King-
dom and the United States (2 and 3 per 100 000, respectively).2,5 A 
strength of our work was the combined model, whereby we col-
lected data from multiple sources; this approach may more accu-
rately reflect the numbers of deaths by suicide perinatally in 
Ontario than using data from just one source.
Our findings with regard to the timing of suicide in the perinatal 
period are consistent with those of a smaller study examining 
maternal deaths in the first year postpartum, which found that 
many suicides occur late in the postpartum period (9–12 mo after 
birth).28 In our study, postpartum deaths occurred most frequently 
after the first 12 weeks, particularly after the sixth month postpar-
tum. This is an important finding, given that many definitions of 
postpartum depression are restricted to women who gave birth 
within the past month, and maternal mortality up to 6 weeks post-
partum is usually considered to be related to childbirth.
The characteristics of women who died by suicide perinatally 
are important. The more lethal means of suicide in the perinatal 
group (i.e., hanging or jumping) relative to the non-perinatal 
group (i.e., overdose) is consistent with previous reports.2,28–31 
These findings suggest that perinatal women who are suicidal 
may be at higher risk for suicide completion than women outside 
the perinatal period. Similar to research in other countries,32 
most of the women who died perinatally had a mood or anxiety 
disorder, rather than a psychotic disorder. This serves as a 
reminder not to underestimate the possible serious conse-
quences of nonpsychotic postpartum mental disorders. Consis-
tent with the literature, most of the women who died by suicide 
had mental health issues (i.e., the perinatal group had signifi-
cantly more psychiatric comorbidities than the living perinatal 
controls), which suggests that many of the women at risk could 
be identified from their psychiatric history.

median gestational age was 23.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 12–29) weeks. For postpartum women, the mean postpartum age at the time of death by sui-

One potential risk factor that emerged here and that requires 
further research is geographic region: women in the North West 
LHIN of Ontario more often died by suicide than was the case in 
other regions, although the difference was not statistically sig-
nificant. The North West LHIN is the largest in Ontario in terms of 
land mass, yet it accounts for the lowest percentage of the popu-

lation. Women in this region, regardless of perinatal status, may 
be more likely to die by suicide than women in any other region, 
 
which perhaps speaks to isolation or lack of access to care, 
hypotheses that would need to be tested directly. Given that 
about 21% of residents in this region are of Aboriginal ancestry 
(close to double that in other regions, according to 2006 data),33 
further exploration is required. 
These characteristics may serve to inform prevention pro-
grams geared to identifying perinatal women at risk.34 Unfortu-
nately, the low rates of mental health contact in the time lead-
ing up to suicide that we observed are also consistent with 
those of research in other jurisdictions; for example, in a recent 
UK study, women were found not to be in treatment around the 
time of death.30 Few studies have examined non–mental health 
contact before suicide. The higher rates of contact with non–
mental health providers that we observed suggest that tailored 
suicide interventions for the perinatal population should be 
geared to family practice and to obstetric and pediatric settings.
Limitations
The limitations of this study included small sample size, which lim-
ited our ability to comment on potential differences in suicide 
rates between pregnant women and those in the postpartum 
period. Our analysis was also limited by aspects of the data 
sources. For example, when there were discrepancies between 
data sources, we reviewed individual cases, but data from the cor-
oner’s office and from ICES are complex and not always complete. 
We may have undercounted the number of pregnancies if preg-
nancy data for some women were not captured in the databases. 
Our diagnostic data may not have been completely accurate,

because we used database sources, although our findings were 
consistent with the literature. We were unable to examine other 
forms of mental health service use, such as therapy with psycholo-
gists or other providers not covered by the provincial health insur-
ance plan. However, contact with primary care providers indicates 
that these women were in the system and could potentially have 
been monitored continuously by primary care providers.
Conclusion
The World Health Organization, recognizing that suicide has not 
been a public health priority, has identified death from suicide as 
imperative for study worldwide.35 With 1 in 19 maternal deaths 
attributable to suicide in Ontario, the findings of our study suggest 
that there is room to improve engagement of pregnant and postpar-
tum women in perinatal mental health services. Moreover, our sui-
cide surveillance and mental health intervention efforts must focus 
on pregnancy and must continue well into the first postpartum year.
