IMPORTANCE Falls result in substantial burden for patients and health care systems, and given
the aging of the population worldwide, the incidence of falls continues to rise.
OBJECTIVE To assess the potential effectiveness of interventions for preventing falls.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,
and Ageline databases from inception until April 2017. Reference lists of included studies
were scanned.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of fall-prevention interventions for
participants aged 65 years and older.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Pairs of reviewers independently screened the studies,
abstracted data, and appraised risk of bias. Pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis
were conducted.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Injurious falls and fall-related hospitalizations.
RESULTS A total of 283 RCTs (159 910 participants; mean age, 78.1 years; 74% women) were
included after screening of 10 650 titles and abstracts and 1210 full-text articles. Network
meta-analysis (including 54 RCTs, 41 596 participants, 39 interventions plus usual care)
suggested that the following interventions, when compared with usual care, were associated
with reductions in injurious falls: exercise (odds ratio [OR], 0.51 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.79];
absolute risk difference [ARD], −0.67 [95% CI, −1.10 to −0.24]); combined exercise and vision
assessment and treatment (OR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.38]; ARD, −1.79 [95% CI, −2.63 to
−0.96]); combined exercise, vision assessment and treatment, and environmental
assessment and modification (OR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.13 to 0.70]; ARD, −1.19 [95% CI, −2.04 to
−0.35]); and combined clinic-level quality improvement strategies (eg, case management),
multifactorial assessment and treatment (eg, comprehensive geriatric assessment), calcium
supplementation, and vitamin D supplementation (OR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.55]; ARD,
−2.08 [95% CI, −3.56 to −0.60]). Pairwise meta-analyses for fall-related hospitalizations
(2 RCTs; 516 participants) showed no significant association between combined clinic- and
patient-level quality improvement strategies and multifactorial assessment and treatment
relative to usual care (OR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.81]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exercise alone and various combinations of interventions
were associated with lower risk of injurious falls compared with usual care. Choice of
fall-prevention intervention may depend on patient and caregiver values and preferences.

 D
ata from the National Institute on Aging showed
that the 2-year prevalence of falls among individuals
aged 65 years or older was 36% in 2010.1 Falls cause
a substantial burden to patients and health care systems.2-4
In 2012, the cost of falls to Medicare was $31 billion.5 Not
only can falls result in serious injury or death,6,7 but older
adults who experience falls also report increased anxiety
and depression and reduced quality of life.8,9 Given the
aging of the population worldwide, the incidence of falls is
expected to continue rising.5 As such, preventing falls
among older persons is increasingly important for health
care systems.
Previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and system-
atic reviews have selectively examined fall-prevention
programs.10-13 However, directly comparing more than 2
interventions using conventional meta-analysis has major
limitations. The key elements of an effective fall-prevention
program remain unclear, which has hampered implementa-
tion of effective interventions. Furthermore, a network
meta-analysis ranking all available fall-prevention interven-
tions and their combinations has not been conducted.
Therefore, a systematic review and network meta-analysis
on all available fall-prevention interventions for older
people were conducted.
Methods
Protocol
The systematic review protocol was developed using
guidance from the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P)
statement,14 registered in PROSPERO (CRD42013004151),
and published.15 Because the methods were reported
previously, they are described only briefly here. The
PRISMA-network meta-analysis extension16 was used to
report results.
Eligibility Criteria
All types of RCTs (eg, cluster, crossover) examining
fall-prevention interventions (whether single or multifacto-
rial) for adults aged 65 years or older in all settings (eg, com-
munity, acute care) were included. Potential compar-
ators were usual care, other fall-prevention interventions,
and placebo.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were the numbers of injurious falls
and fall-related hospitalizations. The secondary outcomes
were rate of falls, number of fallers, number of fall-related
emergency department visits, number of fall-related physi-
cian visits, number of fractures, costs (eg, to the health care
system), number of intervention-related harms (eg, muscle
soreness from exercise), and quality of life. Quality of
life was measured with the SF-12 or SF-36 physical and men-
tal summary component measures (range, 0-100) or the
EuroQol-5D VAS (range, 0-100), where 0 indicates maxi-
mum disability, and 100 indicates no disability.17-19
Data Sources
MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, and Ageline databases were searched from inception
until December 1, 2015 (see protocol for search strategy15).
Reference lists of included RCTs and relevant reviews were
scanned for additional RCTs. Study authors were contacted
for unpublished studies or additional data. An updated
search was conducted on April 19, 2017, which involved
screening, abstraction, and risk-of-bias appraisal by 2 review-
ers, working independently without additional reference
scanning or author contact regarding conference abstracts,
trial protocols, or non-English articles for any studies identi-
fied in the update.
Study Selection
After pilot-testing eligibility criteria for citations and full-text
articles, screening was conducted independently by pairs
of reviewers. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer.
Data Abstraction
Data abstraction was completed by independent pairs
of reviewers after pilot-testing of the data abstraction
form. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Interven-
tions were coded independently by a clinician (S.E.S.) and
a methodologist (A.C.T.) using a preestablished coding
guide (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Included interventions
were classified into the following broad categories: basic
falls risk assessment, calcium supplementation, cog-
nitive behavioral therapy, devices, diet modification,
electromagnetic field therapy and whole-body vibration,
environmental assessment and modification, exercise, floor
modifications, multifactorial assessment and treatment,
osteoporosis medications, podiatry assessment and treat-
ment, quality improvement strategies, social engagement,
surgery, vision assessment and treatment, and vitamin D
supplementation. Quality improvement strategies were
focused on increasing use of research in practice and were
classified at the health system, clinic and clinician, and
patient levels (Box 1 and Table 1).20
Key Points
Question What types of fall-prevention programs may be
effective for reducing injurious falls in older people?
Findings In a network meta-analysis including 54 studies and
41 596 participants, exercise (odds ratio [OR], 0.51), combined
exercise, vision assessment and treatment, and environmental
assessment and modification (OR, 0.30), combined exercise,
and vision assessment and treatment (OR, 0.17), and combined
clinic-level quality-improvement strategies, multifactorial
assessment and treatment, calcium supplementation,
and vitamin D supplementation (OR, 0.12) were significantly
associated with reductions in injurious falls.
Meaning The analysis identified combinations of interventions
likely to be more effective than usual care for preventing
injurious falls.

 Risk-of-Bias Appraisal
The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care
(EPOC) Group’
s risk-of-bias tool was used to appraise in-
cluded studies.21 This appraisal was conducted by pairs
of independent reviewers, with conflicts resolved by a third
reviewer. Small study effects were assessed for each out-
come (when >10 RCTs were available) using the comparison-
adjusted funnel plot and the netfunnel command (Stata 13.0)22
withafixedmeta-analysismodelandorderingtreatmentsfrom
most to least effective according to clinical insight.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Across all outcomes, pairwise random-effects meta-analysis
was conducted. Effect estimates are reported as odds ratios
(ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for
continuous outcomes. Studies reporting dichotomous out-
comes with zero events across all groups were included in
the systematic review, but excluded from analysis. Studies
reporting continuous outcomes with the average effect esti-
mate but not reporting the associated measure of variance
(eg, standard deviation) were included in the analysis, with
standard errors imputed when feasible.23,24
Random-effects network meta-analyses were con-
ducted for connected networks of included RCTs when
more than 10 RCTs were available and the number of RCTs
was greater than the number of intervention nodes. To sur-
mount small study effects,25 smaller trials (n <100 partici-
pants) were excluded from analysis. Across all outcomes for
which network meta-analysis was possible, the transitivity
and consistency assumptions were assessed a priori.26-28
In both network meta-analysis and inconsistency models,
common within-network, between-study variance across
intervention comparisons was assumed because the treat-
ments included in each network of trials were mostly
nonpharmacological. Subgroup and sensitivity network
meta-analyses were conducted for the primary outcome
with consideration of potential treatment effect modifiers.
Interventions were ranked using P scores29 and presented in
a rank-heat plot.30 For each network meta-analysis, the
overall risk for the control group (considering usual care
as the control) of the included studies was calculated via
the variance-stabilizing Freeman-Tukey double arcsine
approach.31 A random-effects pairwise meta-analysis was
applied using inverse variance weights, and to facilitate
interpretation, summary group risks were back-transformed
to the initial scale. All network meta-analyses and consis-
tency assessments were conducted with R software (version
3.3.3)32 using the netmeta package.33 Results were summa-
rized using effect estimates (ORs or mean differences) and
their associated 95% CIs. Overall ORs, derived from each
network meta-analysis, were transformed to risk differ-
ences to allow judgment of the clinical importance of statis-
tically significant results.34 Analysis details are provided in
eMethods in the Supplement.

 included (citations in eReferences in the Supplement),
with a total of 159 910 participants (mean age 78.1 years;
74% women). Two included studies were available only as
conference abstracts,35,36 and 14 other studies were identi-
fied by scanning reference lists of included studies and rel-
evant reviews.37-50
Author Contact
Fifty-four authors were contacted, and responses were re-
ceived from 35 (response rate, 65%), which allowed inclusion
of 2 additional studies.
Study and Participant Characteristics
For 155 of the RCTs (54.8%), the mean age of participants
was between 74 and 84 years (Table 2; eTable 2 in the
Supplement). In 248 of the RCTs (87.6%), at least 50% of the
participants were women. One hundred sixty-nine RCTs
(59.7%) included a mixture of individuals with and without
a history of falls. The number of medications taken was not
reported in 172 RCTs (60.8%).
Two hundred fifty-five of the RCTs (90.1%) were pub-
lished in 2001 or later, and the studies were conducted in
Europe (121 [42.8%]), Australia or New Zealand (66 [23.3%]),
and other regions (Table 3; eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The setting for 142 studies (50.2%) was at home, 75 were in
a clinic ([26.5%]), and 72 were in the community (25.4%),
with some studies including multiple settings. One hundred
and fifty-one RCTs (53.4%) had an intervention duration
of 26 weeks or less, and 223 of the studies (78.8%) had
a duration (ie, from recruitment to the end of follow-up)
of 1 year or less.
Risk of Bias
Most RCTs had a low risk of bias for random sequence gen-
eration (187 [66.1%]), similar baseline outcome measures (212
[74.9%]), similar baseline characteristics (238 [84.1%]),
incomplete outcome data (221 (78.1%]), blinding (267
[94.3%]), and other components of bias (171 [60.4%]) (eTable
4 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement). However, a high propor-
tion had unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment

 (145 [51.2%]), contamination (190 [67.1%]), and selective out-
come reporting (183 [64.7%]). All comparison-adjusted fun-
nel plots suggested no evidence of publication bias (eFigure 2
in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
The design-by-treatment interaction model showed no evi-
dence of significant inconsistency across the network meta-
analysis (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Because of the large
number of results from the analysis, the overall results for
each outcome are presented and focus on statistically signifi-
cant intervention effects relative to usual care for network
meta-analyses (summarized in Box 2). The results from all
statistically significant treatment comparisons are available
in eTable 5 in the Supplement, and the results from all analy-
ses are posted on the Open Science Framework.50 P scores
were used to summarize results for the primary outcome,
and all results are presented in eTable 6, eTable 7, and eTable
8 in the Supplement. The rank-heat plot, presented in eFig-
ure 3 in the Supplement, indicates that exercise is likely the
most effective intervention in terms of numbers of fallers,
injurious falls, fractures, and hip fractures.
Injurious Falls
Network meta-analysis for the primary outcome of injurious
falls included 54 RCTs (41 596 participants) with 39 interven-
tions plus usual care (Figure 2). The event rate for injurious
falls in the usual care group was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.44).
Across all 780 network meta-analysis comparisons, 101
(12.9%) were statistically significant (eTable 5 in the Supple-
ment). The following 4 interventions were associated with a
reduced risk of injurious falls relative to usual care:
• Exercise (OR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.79]; absolute risk dif-
ference [ARD], −0.67 [95% CI, −1.10 to −0.24])
• Combined exercise and vision assessment and treatment
(OR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.38]; ARD, −1.79 [95% CI, −2.63
to −0.96])
• Combinedexercise,visionassessmentandtreatment,anden-
vironmental assessment and modification (OR, 0.30 [95% CI,
0.13 to 0.70]; ARD, −1.19 [95% CI, −2.04 to −0.35])
• Combined clinic-level quality improvement strategies, mul-
tifactorial assessment and treatment, calcium supplemen-
tation,andvitaminDsupplementation(OR,0.12[95%CI,0.03
to 0.55]; ARD, −2.08 [95% CI, −3.56 to −0.60])
The remaining 35 single or multifactorial interventions
were not significantly associated with the risk of injurious falls
relative to usual care. According to the P score results, com-
bined exercise and vision assessment and treatment was prob-
ably the most effective intervention (97% likelihood) to re-
duce injurious falls.
The results of subgroup analyses are summarized in
Table 4. For the 37 RCTs that had less than 75% women
(20 354 participants), which examined 27 treatments plus
usual care, the network meta-analysis results were consistent
with the main analysis. For the 44 RCTs with duration of 12
months or less (32 890 participants; examined 28 interven-
tions plus usual care), the network meta-analysis results

 were consistent with the main analysis for the interventions
of exercise vs usual care and combined clinic-level quality
improvement strategies, multifactorial assessment and treat-
ment, calcium supplementation, and vitamin D supplemen-
tation vs usual care; the remaining 2 significant comparisons
from the main analysis (combined exercise and vision assess-
ment and treatment vs usual care; combined exercise, vision
assessment and treatment, and environmental assessment
and modification vs usual care) were no longer included in
the network. Network meta-analysis was conducted for the
32 RCTs with participants who were younger than 80 years
old (24 869 participants), which examined 26 interventions
plus usual care. Compared with the main analysis, the same
interventions were associated with a reduced risk of injurious
falls except for the combination of clinic-level quality
improvement strategies, multifactorial assessment and treat-
ment, calcium supplementation, and vitamin D supplemen-
tation, which was no longer in the network. This finding was
consistent in another network meta-analysis involving the
40 RCTs (37 010 participants) for people with a mixed fall his-
tory (ie, some had fallen previously and some had not),
which examined 34 interventions plus usual care. A network
meta-analysis restricted to 11 RCTs involving 3830 patients
who had fallen previously and examining 9 interventions
plus usual care found that the combination of clinic-level
quality improvement strategies, multifactorial assessment
and treatment, calcium supplementation, and vitamin D
supplementation was associated with fewer injurious falls
than usual care (OR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.44]; ARD, −2.08
[95% CI, −3.34 to −0.83]), while the remaining 3 comparisons
(exercise vs usual care; combined exercise and vision assess-
ment and treatment vs usual care; combined exercise, vision
assessment and treatment, and environmental assessment
and modification vs usual care) were no longer in the net-
work. Sensitivity analysis was conducted restricting the net-
work meta-analysis to 24 RCTs with a low risk of contamina-
tion bias (26 969 participants; 19 interventions plus usual
care); no intervention was associated with a lower risk of
injurious falls compared with usual care (eg, exercise vs usual
care, OR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.29 to 1.18]; ARD, −0.53 [95% CI,
−1.23 to 0.17]), and 3 of the significant comparisons from
the main analysis were no longer in the network (combined
exercise and vision assessment and treatment vs usual care;
combined exercise, vision assessment and treatment, and
environmental assessment and modification vs usual care;
combined clinic-level quality improvement strategies, multi-
factorial assessment and treatment, calcium supplementa-
tion, and vitamin D supplementation vs usual care).
Overall, each of the 4 interventions that was associated
with better outcomes than usual care in the main analysis was
also associated with fewer injurious falls in 2 or more of the
additional analyses, although in some cases, an additional
analysis was not feasible for a particular subgroup.
Hospitalizations
For the primary outcome of fall-related hospitalizations, 20
RCTs (24 531 participants) with 25 interventions plus usual
care were included. Two pairwise meta-analyses were pos-
sible across all comparisons (eTable 9 in the Supplement).
There were no significant associations with hospitalizations
for combined clinic-level quality improvement strategies,
patient-level quality improvement strategies, and multifacto-
rial assessment and treatment relative to usual care (2 RCTs
[516 participants]; OR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.81]; ARD, −0.03
[−0.10 to 0.093]) or for combined patient-level quality
improvement strategies and exercise relative to exercise
alone (2 RCTs [2126 participants]; OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.38 to
3.25]; ARD, 0.02 [−0.09 to 0.22]).
Emergency Department Visits

 physician visits for exercise relative to usual care (OR, 0.62
[95% CI, 0.32 to 1.18]; ARD, −0.10 [−0.19 to 0.04]).
Number of Fallers
Network meta-analysis for the outcome of number of fallers
included 158 RCTs, 107 300 participants, and 77 interven-
tions plus usual care (Figure 3). One RCT (0.6%) with 31 par-
ticipants (0.03%) was excluded from the network meta-
analysis because it had zero events across all groups. The event
rate for falls in the usual care group was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.33 to
0.43).Acrossall3003networkmeta-analysiscomparisons,200
(6.7%) were statistically significant (eTable 5 in the Supple-
ment). Of these, 5 interventions were associated with a lower
risk of patients experiencing a fall relative to usual care:
• Exercise (OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99]; ARD, −0.19 [95%
CI, −0.36 to −0.01])
• Combined exercise, patient-level quality improvement strat-
egies, clinic-level quality improvement strategies, and mul-
tifactorial assessment and treatment (OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.49
to 0.94]; ARD, −0.39 [95% CI, −0.72 to 0.06])
• Combined exercise, patient-level quality improvement strat-
egies, hip protectors, and environmental assessment and
modification (OR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.97]; ARD, −0.63
[95% CI, −1.22 to −0.03])
• Combined patient-level quality improvement strategies,
clinic-level quality improvement strategies, dietary modifi-
cations, calcium supplementation, and vitamin D supple-
mentation (OR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.93]; ARD, −1.03 [95%
CI, −1.99 to −0.08])
• Combined orthotics and exercise (OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.07 to
0.67]; ARD, −1.54 [95% CI, −2.67 to −0.40])
The remaining interventions were not significantly
associated with a lower risk of falls than usual care. One
intervention (combined exercise, patient-level quality
improvement strategies, and social engagement) was asso-
ciated with a higher risk that patients would experience falls
relative to usual care (OR, 5.13 [95% CI, 2.14 to 12.30]; ARD,
1.63 [95% CI, 0.76 to 2.51]).
Fractures
Network meta-analysis for the outcome of fractures included
68 RCTs, 86 491 participants, and 43 interventions plus usual
care (Figure 4). The event rate for fractures in the usual care
group was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.10). Across all 946 network
meta-analysis comparisons, 45 (4.8%) were statistically sig-
nificant (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Of these, 1 intervention
(combined osteoporosis treatment (eg, bisphosphonates),
calcium supplementation, and vitamin D supplementation)
was associated with a lower risk of fractures relative to usual
care (OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.54]; ARD, −1.51 [95% CI,
−2.41 to −0.62]). The remaining 42 interventions were not
significantly associated with a lower risk of fractures than
usual care.
Hip Fractures
Network meta-analysis for the outcome of hip fractures
included 39 RCTs, 52 281 participants, and 23 interventions
plus usual care (Figure 4). Four RCTs (9.1%) with 1877 par-
ticipants (3.5%) were excluded from the network meta-
analysis because they had zero events across all groups. The
event rate for hip fractures in the usual care group was 0.03
(95% CI, 0.02 to 0.04). Across all 276 network meta-analysis

 comparisons, 9 (3.3%) were statistically significant (eTable 5
in the Supplement). Of these, 1 intervention (combined
osteoporosis treatment, calcium supplementation, and vita-
min D supplementation) was associated with a lower risk of
hip fracture relative to usual care (OR, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.05 to
0.62]; ARD, −1.70 [95% CI, −2.92 to −0.48]). An additional
22 interventions were not significantly associated with a
lower risk of hip fractures than usual care.
Quality of Life
Although 32 RCTs (18 521 participants) provided data on
quality-of-life measures (eTable 10 in the Supplement),
only 2 pairwise meta-analyses were possible (eTable 9 in
the Supplement). Exercise was not significantly associated
with improvement in quality of life as measured by the
SF-36 or SF-12 physical component summary score com-
pared with usual care (mean difference, −0.06 [95% CI,
−0.90 to 0.77]; 2 RCTs; 1206 participants). Similar results
were obtained for the SF-36 or SF-12 mental component
summary score (mean difference, 0.29 [95% CI, −1.00 to
1.58]; 2 RCTs; 1206 participants).
Harms
Fifty-seven of the RCTs (24 558 participants) reported no
intervention-related harmful events in any study group, and
another 62 RCTs (39 596 participants) reported 1 or more
harms (eTable 11 in the Supplement). Only 2 pairwise meta-
analyses were possible (eTable 9 in the Supplement). Exer-
cise was not significantly associated with an increased risk of
muscle soreness compared with usual care (OR, 4.97 [95% CI,
0.35 to 70.38]; ARD, 0.13 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0.70]; 2 RCTs;
1021 participants). Supplementation with calcium and vita-
min D was not significantly associated with an increased risk
of gastrointestinal harm compared with usual care (OR, 1.05
[95% CI, 0.52 to 2.09]; ARD, 0.001 [95% CI, −0.01 to 0.03];
2 RCTs; 3853 participants).

 Discussion
Exercise alone and various combinations of interventions
were associated with lower risk of injurious falls compared
with usual care. Choice of intervention may depend on
patient and caregiver values and preferences. Combinations
of interventions, including exercise, vision assessment and
treatment, environmental assessment and modification,
multifactorial assessment and treatment, and vitamin D
supplementation were associated with preventing injurious
falls compared with usual care. The combination of exercise

 and vision assessment and treatment was probably the
intervention most strongly associated with reduction in
injurious falls.
These results suggest that encouraging patients to exer-
cise, undergo a vision assessment, and consider osteoporo-
sis therapy (for those at risk), given the potential impact of
these interventions in preventing injurious falls. Other com-
binations of interventions to consider include exercise,
patient-level and clinic-level quality improvement strate-
gies, multifactorial assessment and treatment; exercise,
patient-level quality improvement strategies, hip protectors,
and environmental assessment and modification; and
orthotics and exercise in patients at risk for falls. The results
suggest focusing on implementing patient-level quality
improvement strategies (eg, patient education and patient
reminders) and clinic-level quality improvement interven-
tions (eg, audit and feedback) to increase uptake of this evi-
dence. The results also suggest that calcium and vitamin D
supplementation may decrease fractures, as may osteoporo-
sis therapy plus calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
However, the results indicate the need for a tailored ap-
proach; subgroup analyses showed that the combination of
exercise, environmental assessment and modification, and
multifactorial assessment and treatment was associated
with an increased risk of injurious falls among patients who
had fallen previously. In addition, the combination of exer-
cise, patient-level quality improvement strategies, and social
engagement was associated with increased fall risk. Exercise
may increase fall risk in some individuals because these
people become more mobile as their strength increases;
patients can be made aware of this situation, but any cau-
tionary advice must be balanced with the need to improve
mobility and avoid deconditioning. This finding also raises
the issue of the type of exercise to recommend, such as exer-
cise focused on enhancing balance.52 Health care managers
might consider the use of clinic-level quality improvement
strategies, such as clinician reminders and audit and feed-
back, to increase uptake of multifactorial assessment and
treatment and of vitamin D supplementation to reduce inju-
rious falls. As well, for patients in long-term care settings,
hip protectors, environmental assessment and modification,
exercise, and patient-level quality improvement strategies
are potential options to reduce falls.
A 2015 systematic review and network meta-analysis
examining vision and risk factor interventions to prevent
falls included 7 RCTs with 2723 participants; interventions
combining vision assessment and treatment and multifacto-
rial assessment and treatment were found to be the most
effective.53 The current systematic review was much larger
(with an additional 276 RCTs and 157 187 participants; eRef-
erences in the Supplement) and includes information on the
effectiveness of quality improvement strategies and multi-
factorial assessment and treatment. Although the authors of
a systematic review on exercise54 did not conduct network
meta-analysis, their results were similar to those reported
here, which suggests that exercise might be associated with
decreased falls in older adults, but the type of exercise
should be tailored to the individual.
The authors of RCTs included in this review could have
improved their studies by conducting adequate allocation
concealment (which is possible in any RCT), ensuring that
results were not influenced by contamination bias, and
reporting all outcomes. Most RCTs were completed within 6
months, but longer-term follow-up and confirmation of the
sustainability of these interventions are required. In addi-
tion, few studies were conducted in the acute care setting,
despite falls in hospitals often being considered during hos-
pital accreditation processes.
Strengths of the review process include reviewers work-
ing in pairs across all levels of screening, data abstraction, and
risk-of-bias appraisal; cleaning of the data by a third re-
viewer; and following the guidance of the International Soci-
ety for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research in con-
ducting statistical analyses.55
This study had several limitations. The published
protocol included both the falls rate and costs as secondary
outcomes. However, because few studies reported these
outcomes consistently, these outcomes could not be ana-
lyzed directly; rather, data for falls rates were converted to
number of falls. As well, another outcome, quality of life, as
measured by SF-12 or SF-36 summary component measures
or EuroQol-5D, was added.17-19 Some of the planned sub-
group analyses and sensitivity analyses were not conducted
because of insufficient data. Although the point esti-
mate was similar to the overall OR, the results were no lon-
ger statistically significant for the injurious falls network
meta-analysis when only studies with a low risk of contami-
nation bias were included. However, because most of the
studies (67%) were assessed as having an unclear risk of
contamination bias, the power of this sensitivity analysis
was limited by the lower number of studies that could be
included. This limitation suggests that improvements in
reporting are required. Most network meta-analyses
included numerous interventions, with sparse data for the
treatment comparisons; additional analyses, using the mod-
els suggested by Welton et al56 and Caldwell and Welton57
to account for sparseness, could be conducted in the fu-
ture. Scanning the reference lists of 32 additional studies
from the updated search and inclusion of an unpublished
conference abstract58 and a non-English paper59 were not
possible. Because of the large number of comparisons in the
network meta-analyses, multiplicity may have elevated
the rate of false positives in the statistically significant
results (type I error).60,61 Although P scores are based on
the treatment effect estimates and their associated CIs,
it is recommended that the P score values be interpreted
along with the network meta-analysis point estimates and
their precision.29
Conclusions
Exercise alone and various combined interventions were as-
sociated with lower risk of injurious falls compared with usual
care. Choice of intervention may depend on patient and care-
giver values and preferences.
