Significance Statement
It is generally accepted that long-term memory (LTM) is encoded as alterations in synaptic strength. An
alternative model, however, proposes that LTM is encoded by epigenetic changes. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)
can mediate epigenetic modifications. Therefore, RNA from a trained animal might be capable of producing
learning-like behavioral change in an untrained animal. Here, it is demonstrated that the memory for long-term
sensitization (LTS) in the marine mollusk Aplysia can be successfully transferred by injecting RNA from sensitized
into naïve animals. Moreover, a specific cellular alteration that underlies sensitization in Aplysia, sensory neuron
hyperexcitability, can be reproduced by exposing sensory neurons in vitro to RNA from trained animals. The
results provide support for a nonsynaptic, epigenetic model of memory storage in Aplysia.

 The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that
RNA extracted from the central nervous system of Aplysia given long-term sensitization (LTS) training induced
sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-
induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from
trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from
naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of
nonassociative long-term memory (LTM) in Aplysia can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA
is sufficient to generate an engram for LTS in Aplysia and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced
epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in Aplysia.

Introduction
A major goal of modern neuroscience is to determine
the identity of the engram, the physical memory trace
(Semon, 1921). At present, it is widely accepted that long-
term memory (LTM) is stored by learning-induced modifica-
tions of synaptic connections (Mayford et al., 2012;
Takeuchi et al., 2014). But theoretical considerations (Hol-
liday, 1999; Gallistel and Balsam, 2014) and recent exper-
imental evidence (Chen et al., 2014; Johansson et al.,
2014; Ryan et al., 2015) support the idea that LTM is
stored within the cell bodies of neurons. Previously, it was
reported that the memory for long-term sensitization (LTS)
in Aplysia (Pinsker et al., 1973) involves an early, protein
synthesis-dependent priming component that can persist
independently of memory-related behavioral and synaptic
alterations; the priming component permits LTM to be
reinstated following its disruption by reconsolidation
blockade, or to be induced by partial training after impair-
ment of memory consolidation by retrograde amnesia
(Chen et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 2017). The molecular
identity of the memory priming component is unknown,
but appears to involve epigenetic modifications (Zovkic
et al., 2013). Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which play im-
portant roles in memory formation (Rajasethupathy et al.,
2009, 2012; Fiumara et al., 2015; Guven-Ozkan et al.,
2016; Tan et al., 2017), represent a major mechanism for
epigenetic alterations (Peschansky and Wahlestedt, 2014;
Savell et al., 2016). This raises the intriguing possibility that
constituents of LTM may be transferred from a trained to an
untrained animal by RNA. Here, we tested this possibility in
the case of LTS in Aplysia.
Materials and Methods
Behavioral training and testing
Adult Aplysia californica (80–120 g) were obtained from
Alacrity Marine Biological Services and initially housed in
a 50-gallon aquarium filled with cooled (12–14°C), aerated
seawater. For the experiments, the animals were placed
individually into custom-built Plexiglas chambers that
were continuously perfused with cooled (14°C) seawater.
One day before training, each animal was implanted bi-
laterally with Teflon-coated platinum wires (0.008-inch
coated diameter, A-M Systems). For this procedure, the
animal was anesthetized by cooling in cold seawater (4°C)
for 13 min. Wires, prepared by removing the Teflon from
the ends with forceps, were threaded through a 20-gauge
needle, which was used to insert the wire into the animal’s
tail. Following this procedure, the animal was placed into
the experimental chamber, where it was given 24 h to re-
cover and acclimate to the chamber. The siphon-withdrawal
reflex (SWR) was tested as follows: The siphon was lightly
stimulated with a soft, flexible probe and the duration of
the resulting SWR was timed. Timing of the SWR began
once the siphon had retracted completely beneath the
parapodia and ended as soon as the siphon reappeared.
Responses were given a score of 1.0 s if the siphon did
not withdraw completely into the parapodia. Three pre-
tests were delivered once every 10 min, beginning 25 min
before the start of training (Figs. 1A, 2A). Sensitization
training comprised two rounds of training separated by 24
h. Each round of training consisted of five bouts of tail
shocks delivered at 20-min intervals. During each bout of
training, the animal received three trains; the intertrain
interval was 2 s. Each train was 1 s in duration and
consisted of shocks (10-ms pulse duration, 40 Hz, 120 V)
delivered to the animal’s tail via a Grass stimulator (S88,
Astro-Med) connected to the platinum wires. A single
posttest of the SWR, performed exactly as the pretests,
was made at 48 h after the start of training. The testing
and training were conducted by different experimenters,
and the tester was blind to the experimental treatment of
the animal.
In the experiments involving RNA injections (see Re-
sults), naïve animals were given three pretests, identical

 controls, immediately after the 48-h posttest. The total
RNA was then extracted from the dissected ganglia. The
ganglia were initially homogenized in TRIzol reagent for 30
s; typically, 1 ml TRIzol was used to homogenize the
central ganglia from two animals. For every 1 ml TRIzol
reagent, 200 �l chloroform was added and mixed by
vortexing for 15 s. After incubation at room temperature
for 5–10 min, the sample was centrifuged at 12,000 � g
for 15 min. The upper aqueous phase was transferred into
a new tube. The sample was then centrifuged for 10 min
at 4°C after addition of 500 �l isopropanol to precipitate
the RNA. The resulting RNA pellets were washed with
70% ethanol and centrifuged for 2 min at 4°C. After being
air-dried for 10 min, the RNA pellet from each tube was
dissolved in 30 �l DIH2O; then the RNA from ganglia
dissected from trained animals (typically, from four ani-
mals) was combined, or the RNA from ganglia dissected
from untrained animals was combined, into a single tube,
and the RNA concentration was measured using Nano
Drop (Thermo Fisher ND-1000). After the RNA concentra-
tion had been determined, 70 �g of the combined RNA
was aliquoted and ASW was added to this aliquot to attain
a volume of 100 �l; this solution was then injected into the
hemocoel of an animal via its neck. Each recipient animal
therefore received 70 �g of either RNA from trained ani-
mals or RNA from control animals.
The DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor RG108
(Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 25
mM. To inhibit DNMT, a volume of 100 �l/100 g of body
weight of RG108 was injected intrahemocoelically into
each animal (Fig. 2C).
Cell culturing and electrophysiological
measurements
Pleural sensory neurons and small siphon (LFS) motor
neurons were individually dissociated from adult animals
and placed into cell culture (Rayport and Schacher, 1986;
Lin and Glanzman, 1994). Some of the cell cultures com-
prised isolated neurons, either exclusively sensory or ex-
clusively motor neurons; others comprised synaptically
coupled pairs of neurons, each consisting of a single
sensory neuron and a single motor neuron. The cell cul-
ture medium was composed of 50% Aplysia sterile he-
molymph and 50% Leibowitz-15 (L-15, Sigma). During
electrophysiological recording the cell cultures were per-
fused with 50% ASW and 50% L-15 (recording medium).
The recordings from isolated neurons were made using
dissociated neurons that had been in culture for 5 d at the
start of the experiments. For the experiments on synap-
tically coupled pairs of neurons (sensorimotor cocultures),
the neurons were in culture for 3 d before the initial
recordings. The neurons were impaled with sharp mi-
cropipettes (20–30 M�) filled with 1.5 M potassium ace-
tate, 0.5 M potassium chloride, and 0.01 M HEPES (pH
7.2). The recorded voltage signals were amplified with an
Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular Devices), digitalized
with an ITC-18 (Instrutech), and acquired and stored using
Axograph software.
During the measurements of the biophysical properties
of isolated sensory and motor neurons, the cell membrane
potential was current clamped at –50 mV. The action
potential (AP) firing threshold was determined by injecting
2-s current pulses of incremental intensity (0.1 nA for the
sensory neurons and 0.01 nA for the motor neurons). Cells
were injected with a 2-s steady pulse of suprathreshold
positive current for the measurements of neuronal excit-
ability (Liu et al., 2011). In the case of the sensory neurons,
current pulses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 nA were used depending
on whether the initial firing threshold was �0.5, �0.5, or
�1.0 nA, respectively. Sensory neurons were excluded
from the analysis if their resting membrane potential was
more depolarized than –35 mV. To test the excitability of
motor neurons, positive current pulses of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3
nA were used when the initial spike threshold was �0.1,
�0.1, or �0.2 nA, respectively. Motor neurons whose
membrane potentials were more depolarized than –30 mV
were excluded. After the electrophysiological measurements
were completed, the microelectrodes were removed from
the neurons, and the cell cultures were treated with RNA-
containing medium or vehicle solution (see Results). Twenty-
four hours later, the neurons were reimpaled and their
electrophysiological properties remeasured.
In the experiments involving sensorimotor cocultures,
the amplitude of the monosynaptic EPSP evoked by a
single presynaptic AP was assessed on day 1 of the exper-
iment. For this purpose, the presynaptic sensory neuron and
postsynaptic motor neuron in the coculture were impaled
with sharp microelectrodes. To prevent the motor neuron
from spontaneously firing during testing, the neuron’s
membrane potential was held at –80 to –85 mV by pass-
ing negative current (0.3–0.8 nA) into the cell via the
recording microelectrode using the bridge circuit of the
amplifier. An initial EPSP was elicited through brief intra-
cellular stimulation of the sensory neuron using a positive
current pulse (20 ms, 0.2–0.8 nA). After the pretest, the
microelectrodes were removed from the sensory and mo-
tor neurons, and the recording medium was replaced with
cell culture medium. Then the coculture was treated either
with RNA-containing medium or control medium (see Re-
sults). The sensory and motor neurons were reimpaled
with microelectrodes and the amplitude of the monosyn-
aptic EPSP reassessed 24 h later.
RNA/vehicle treatment of cell cultures
Following the initial electrophysiological measurements
on day 1, the recording medium was washed out with
normal cell culture medium. The cultures were then ran-
domly assigned to treatment with RNA from trained ani-
mals (trained RNA group), RNA from untrained animals
(control RNA group), or vehicle. For the RNA treatments, 1
�g of RNA was added to each cell culture dish, yielding a
concentration of 0.5 �g of RNA per 1 ml of cell culture
medium. The RNA from the trained animals, the RNA from
the control animals, or the vehicle was added to the cell
culture dish and left in the dish for 24 h, after which it was
washed out with the recording medium for 30 min, and the
posttest electrophysiological measurements made.

 were used to assess the statistical significance of differ-
ences whenever necessitated due to non-normality of the
data or to the violation of the assumption of homogeneity
of variance among experimental groups. Mann–Whitney U
tests were used for comparisons of two independent
groups. A paired t test or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was
used to compare two dependent groups. When three
independent groups were involved, the significance of the
overall group differences was initially assessed with a
one-way ANOVA or a Kruskal–Wallis test. Given that the
group differences were significant, Dunn’s post hoc tests
were used for pairwise comparisons. Normality of the
distribution were tested with a Shapiro–Wilk test. Lev-
ene’s test centered to the mean (car package) was used
with R software to test for homogeneity of variance in the
synaptic experiments. All reported levels of significance
represent two-tailed values. The statistical analyses are
summarized in Table 1.
Results
Injection of RNA from sensitization-trained donor
animals causes enhancement of the withdrawal
reflex in untrained recipients
To generate the RNA used for memory transfer, individ-
ual Aplysia were given sensitization training consisting of
spaced bouts of tail shocks for two consecutive days (Fig.
1A). The training produced clear LTS, as indicated by the
significant enhancement of the SWR 24 h after the second
day of training (48-h posttest) in the trained group of animals
(Fig. 1B). Immediately after the 48-h posttest, RNA was
extracted from the central nervous system (pleural, pedal
and abdominal ganglia) of the control and trained animals.
The extracted RNA was then injected intrahemocoelically
into other naïve Aplysia (recipient animals; Fig. 1C). (Note
that occasional batches of wild-caught Aplysia did not
sensitize. The behavioral data from these animals were
excluded from the analysis, and RNA was not extracted
from them.) The duration of the SWR in the recipients was
measured 24 h after the RNA injection. The SWR was
significantly enhanced in the trained RNA group of ani-
mals compared to the control RNA group (Fig. 1D). Fur-
thermore, a within-group comparison indicated that the
posttest duration of the reflex was significantly longer
than the pretest duration in the animals that received the
injection of the RNA from trained donors; by contrast, the
posttest SWR was not significantly prolonged compared
to the pretest SWR in animals that received the injection
of RNA from the untrained donors. Thus, only the RNA
from sensitized animals appeared to induce reflex en-
hancement in the recipient snails.
Inhibition of DNA methylation blocks the behavioral
effect of RNA from sensitized donor animals in the
recipients
Both the consolidation and maintenance of the LTM
for sensitization in Aplysia depend on DNA methylation
(Rajasethupathy et al., 2012; Pearce et al., 2017). To
determine whether the RNA-mediated behavioral en-
hancement similarly required DNA methylation, we exam-
ined whether inhibiting DNA methylation disrupted the
sensitizing effect of the RNA from trained animals. Aplysia
were again given 2 d of sensitization training, which pro-
duced LTS, and afterward RNA was extracted from their
central ganglia (Fig. 2A,B). The RNA was then injected into
two groups of naïve snails; 5–10 min later, one of these
groups (RNA-RG group) was also given an intrahemocoe-
lic injection of the DNMT inhibitor RG-108 (Brueckner
et al., 2005; Pearce et al., 2017), whereas the other (RNA-
Veh group) was given an injection of the vehicle solution
(Fig. 2C). The RNA-Veh group exhibited significant en-
hancement of the SWR 24 h later; by contrast, the
RNA-RG group did not show behavioral enhancement
(Fig. 2D). Therefore, DNA methylation is required for RNA-
induced enhancement of the SWR, as it is for tail shock-
induced LTS of the reflex (Pearce et al., 2017).
RNA from sensitized animals induces increased
excitability in sensory neurons dissociated from
naïve animals
A significant advantage of Aplysia as a model system
for mechanistic analyses of learning and memory is the
wealth of extant knowledge regarding the biological bases of
sensitization in this organism (Kandel, 2001; Byrne and
Hawkins, 2015). Accordingly, we tested whether RNA ex-
tracted from sensitization-trained animals caused cellular
alternations that mimic those known to result from re-
peated tail shocks. To ascertain whether the cellular
changes induced by RNA from sensitized animals mimic
shock-induced cellular changes, we made use of sensory

 and motor neurons of the withdrawal circuit in dissociated
cell culture (Lin and Glanzman, 1994).
In response to a prolonged pulse of depolarizing intra-
cellular current, Aplysia sensory neurons exhibit spike
“accommodation”: they fire at the beginning of, but not
throughout, the current pulse (Klein et al., 1986). Long-
lasting sensitization of the defensive withdrawal reflex is
accompanied by a long-term increase in the excitability of
the somata of central sensory neurons in the withdrawal
circuit (Walters, 1987); this enhanced excitability is reflected
as anti-accommodation, an increase in the number of APs
evoked by a prolonged pulse of positive current (Cleary
et al., 1998). To test whether RNA extracted from trained
Aplysia alters sensory neuron accommodation, we used
isolated sensory neurons in dissociated cell culture. The
neurons were initially impaled with sharp microelectrodes
and the number of APs evoked by a 2-s intracellular pulse
of suprathreshold positive current quantified (Fig. 3A).
Following this pretest, the sensory neurons were treated
for 24 h with RNA from trained donors or RNA from
untrained donors. Other sensory neurons were treated
with an equivalent amount of the vehicle alone. The next
day, the RNA/vehicle was washed out of the culture
dishes with cell recording medium, and the neurons were
reimpaled and reinjected with the same suprathreshold
current to measure potential changes in excitability. The
current injections produced significantly more APs in sen-
sory neurons treated with RNA from sensitized animals
than in sensory neurons treated with either vehicle or RNA
from control animals (Fig. 3B). There was no significant
difference in excitability between the sensory neurons
treated with control RNA and those treated with the ve-
hicle. Anti-accommodation is known to result from a de-
crease in cyclic AMP-dependent potassium currents in
Aplysia sensory neurons, and, in particular, to reduction of
the slowly-inactivating S-type current (Klein et al., 1986;
Goldsmith
and
Abrams,
1992);
thus,
the
RNA
from
sensitization-trained animals may enhance the excitability of
sensory neurons through modulation of the same current
that is modulated by electrical shocks to the body wall of
Aplysia.
RNA from sensitized animals does not increase the
excitability of dissociated motor neurons
To ascertain the specificity of the cellular effects of the
RNA treatment, we examined the effects of applying RNA
from trained or control animals to isolated small siphon
(LFS) motor neurons in dissociated cell culture. A previous
study of LTS in Aplysia showed that, in contrast to the
effects observed in sensory neurons, in motor neurons
LTS was not accompanied by a significant increase in the
number of APs evoked to intracellular injection of a pro-
longed pulse of suprathreshold current (Cleary et al., 1998).
Thus, the induction of LTS does not produce an overall
increase in the excitability of motor neurons. Similarly, we
observed no effect of the RNA from sensitization-trained
animals on excitability-related properties of isolated mo-
tor neurons in cell culture (Fig. 3C,D). This result indicates
that the modulation of neuronal excitability by RNA from
sensitized animals was specific to the sensory neurons.
RNA from sensitized animals has a variable effect on
synaptic strength in sensorimotor cocultures
LTS in Aplysia involves long-term facilitation (LTF) of the
monosynaptic connection between the sensory and mo-
tor neurons of the withdrawal circuit (Frost et al., 1985).
Accordingly, we examined the effects of RNA from trained
and untrained donors on the strength of sensorimotor
synapses in dissociated cell culture (Montarolo et al.,
1986; Cai et al., 2008). There was no long-term effect of
24-h incubation with RNA from trained animals, RNA from
control animals, or the vehicle on the mean EPSP evoked
in the postsynaptic motor neurons by a presynaptic AP
(Fig. 4). Nonetheless, although the mean EPSPs in the
three experimental groups did not differ significantly, the
variances among the EPSPs in the three groups were sig-
nificantly unequal due to the greater variance in the EPSPs
for the synapses treated with RNA from sensitization-
trained animals. Inspection of the synaptic data revealed
that the RNA from trained donors produced large en-
hancement of a subset of the sensorimotor synapses.
Such enhancement was never observed for synapses
treated with RNA from untrained animals or for synapses
treated with the vehicle.
Discussion
We have shown that RNA from sensitization-trained
Aplysia contains critical components of the engram for
LTS, as indicated by its ability to induce sensitization-like
behavioral enhancement when injected into naïve recipi-
ent animals. Importantly, the RNA-induced sensitization,
like the LTS induced by noxious stimulation, requires DNA
methylation for its consolidation (Pearce et al., 2017; Fig.
2). Several of our cellular and behavioral results further
argue that this putative transference of memory from
donor animals to the recipients cannot be easily ascribed
to nonspecific effects of the donor RNA. First, the control
RNA (RNA extracted from untrained donors) did not pro-
duce sensitization of the SWR (Fig. 1). Second, the RNA
from trained donors had an opposing effect on the excit-
ability of cultured sensory neurons from that of untrained
donors (Fig. 3A,B). Third, the changes produced by the
RNA from sensitized Aplysia were selective for sensory
neurons; the biophysical properties of motor neurons
were unaltered by the RNA from sensitized donors (Fig.
3C,D). Admittedly, the alterations we observed in the
biophysical properties of cultured sensory neurons after
treatment with RNA from sensitized animals are unlikely to
fully account for the behavioral changes produced in the
intact recipient animals by injections of RNA from trained
donors; nonetheless, because these biophysical altera-
tions mimic those found in intact animals after LTS train-
ing (Walters, 1987; Cleary et al., 1998), they would be
expected to contribute substantially to the RNA-induced
sensitization.
It is interesting that the RNA from sensitization-trained
animals appeared to produce strong facilitation only in a
subset of sensorimotor synapses (Fig. 4). We do not
understand the reason for the variability of the synaptic
effect of the RNA from trained animals. One possibility is
that there is an as-yet unappreciated inhomogeneity

 among the population of pleural sensory neurons and/or
small siphon motor neurons that were used for the sen-
sorimotor cocultures; according to this idea, only some of
the dissociated neurons had the capacity to express the
long-term changes that contribute to LTF. Another possi-
bility is that the epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA
methylation, that result from treatment with the RNA from
sensitized animals more reliably induce cell-wide altera-
tions, such as changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability
(Meadows et al., 2016; see also Meadows et al., 2015),
than synapse-specific LTF. Of course, these possibilities
are not mutually exclusive.
Overall, the cellular changes caused by the RNA from
trained animals were admittedly modest compared to the
behavioral changes. But this is not unexpected; the de-
fensive withdrawal reflexes in Aplysia are regulated by
interneuronal neural circuits, in addition to the monosyn-
aptic sensorimotor connections (Cleary et al., 1995). In-

 jections of the RNA from sensitized donors may well have
produced modifications of interneuronal pathways within
the animals that contributed to behavioral sensitization. In
addition, it is important to note that the RNA was removed
from the donors 48 h after training; indeed, the RNA from
trained animals produced a greater increase in the excit-
ability of cultured sensory neurons at 48 h posttraining
than long-term training with serotonin (Liu et al., 2011,
their Fig. 6).
Our data indicate that essential components of the
engram for LTM in Aplysia can be transferred to untrained
animals, or to neurons in culture, via RNA. This finding
raises two questions: (1) Which specific RNA(s) mediate(s)
the memory transfer? and (2) How does the naked RNA
get from the hemolymph/cell culture medium into Aplysia
neurons? Regarding the first question, although we do not
know the identity of the memory-bearing molecules at
present, we believe it is likely that they are ncRNAs. Note
that previous results have implicated ncRNAs, notably
microRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs;
Rajasethupathy et al., 2009, 2012; Fiumara et al., 2015), in
LTM in Aplysia. Long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) represent other
potential candidate memory transfer molecules (Mercer
et al., 2008). Regarding the second question, recent evi-
dence has revealed potential pathways for the passage of
cell-free, extracellular RNA from body fluids into neurons.
Thus, miRNAs, for example, have been detected in many
different types of body fluids, including blood plasma; and
cell-free extracellular miRNAs can become encapsulated
within exosomes or attached to proteins of the Argonaut
(AGO) family, thereby rendering the miRNAs resistant to
degradation by extracellular nucleases (Turchinovich et al.,
2012, 2013). Moreover, miRNA-containing exosomes have
been reported to pass freely through the blood-brain barrier
(Ridder et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2017). And it is now appreci-
ated that RNAs can be exchanged between cells of the
body, including between neurons, via extracellular vesi-
cles (Smalheiser, 2007; Valadi et al., 2007; Tkach and
Théry, 2016; Ashley et al., 2018; Pastuzyn et al., 2018). If,
as we believe, ncRNAs in the RNA extracted from sensi-
tized animals were transferred to Aplysia neurons, per-
haps via extracellular vesicles, they likely caused one or
more epigenetic effects that contributed to the induction
and maintenance of LTM (Fig. 2).
There have been prior reports of the successful transfer
of LTM from trained donor animals to naïve recipients via
cannibalism (McConnell, 1962) or RNA injection (Babich
et al., 1965; Jacobson et al., 1965; Albert, 1966; Braud,
1970). However, these early claims have long been viewed
with skepticism due to numerous failures to replicate the
memory transfer effect (Hartry et al., 1964; Gross and
Carey, 1965; Byrne et al., 1966; Luttges et al., 1966;
Walker, 1966; Walker and Milton, 1966; McGaugh, 1967).
The negative results convinced many that the positive
reports of memory transfer were attributable to lack of
proper controls for training-induced factors such as stress
or arousal, and/or the influence of poorly defined aspects
of the experimental methods used (time between the RNA
injection and behavioral testing of the recipients, specific
method of RNA extraction, etc.; McGaugh, 1967; Setlow,
1997).
A major advantage of our study over earlier studies of
memory transfer is that we used a type of learning, sen-
sitization of the defensive withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, the
cellular and molecular basis of which is exceptionally well
characterized (Kandel, 2001; Kandel, 2012; Byrne and
Hawkins, 2015). The extensive knowledge base regarding
sensitization in Aplysia enabled us to show that the RNA
from sensitized donors not only produced sensitization-
like behavioral change in the naïve recipients, but also
caused specific electrophysiological alterations of cul-
tured neurons that mimic those observed in sensitized
animals. The cellular changes observed after exposure of
cultured neurons to RNA from trained animals significantly

32). A Kruskal–Wallis test revealed no significant differences among the groups with respect to the mean changes in EPSP amplitude
(p � 0.8). Note, however, that five of the 32 synapses treated with RNA from trained animals showed an increase of �150%, whereas
none of the synapses treated with vehicle or RNA from control animals showed an increase of this magnitude. A Levene’s test
confirmed that the three groups displayed significantly unequal variances (F(2,86) � 5.883, p � 0.005).

 strengthens the case for positive memory transfer in our
study.
Another difference between our study and earlier at-
tempts at memory transfer via RNA is that there is now at
hand a mechanism, unknown 40 years ago, whereby RNA
can powerfully influence the function of neurons: epige-
netic modifications (Qureshi and Mehler, 2012). In fact,
the role of ncRNA-mediated epigenetic changes in neural
function, particularly in learning and memory, is currently
the subject of vigorous investigation (Landry et al., 2013;
Sweatt, 2013; Fischer, 2014; Nestler, 2014; Smalheiser,
2014; Marshall and Bredy, 2016). Our demonstration that
inhibition of DNA methylation blocks the memory transfer
effect (Fig. 2) supports the hypothesis that the behavioral
and cellular effects of RNA from sensitized Aplysia in our
study are mediated, in part, by DNA methylation (Rajas-
ethupathy et al., 2012; see also Pearce et al., 2017).
The discovery that RNA from trained animals can trans-
fer the engram for LTS in Aplysia offers dramatic support
for the idea that memory can be stored nonsynaptically
(Holliday, 1999; Gallistel and Balsam, 2014; Queenan et al.,
2017), and indicates the limitations of the synaptic plasticity
model of LTM storage (Mayford et al., 2012; Takeuchi
et al., 2014). In addition, our results suggest that RNA
could eventually be used to modify, either enhance or
depress, memories.
