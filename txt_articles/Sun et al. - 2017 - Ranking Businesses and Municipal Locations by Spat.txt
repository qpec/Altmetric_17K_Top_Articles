BACKGROUND: Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator 
placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused 
on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering 
hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many 
businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for 
automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours 
and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator 
accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations 
that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment 
of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study 
using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest 
database. We identified all nontraumatic public OHCAs occurring in Toronto, 
ON, Canada, from January 2007 through December 2015. We identified 
41 unique businesses and municipal location types with ≥20 locations in 
Toronto from the YellowPages, Canadian Franchise Association, and the City 
of Toronto Open Data Portal. We obtained their geographic coordinates and 
hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined 
the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it 
was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The 
businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal 
OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we 
calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.
RESULTS: There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons 
ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in 
downtown, covering 110 OHCAs. Coffee shops and bank machines from 
the 5 largest Canadian banks occupied 8 of the top 10 spots in both 
Toronto and downtown. The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with 
intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) 
in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified and ranked businesses and municipal 
locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity. This 
approach may help policy makers and funders to identify and prioritize 
potential partnerships for automated external defibrillator deployment in 
public-access defibrillator programs.

U
se of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) has 
been shown to increase survival after sudden car-
diac arrest by reducing the delay to treatment and 
allowing rapid defibrillation.1–5 Therefore, AEDs are dis-
seminated through public-access defibrillation (PAD) pro-
grams to encourage bystander response in communities 
worldwide.6,7 However, even with the increasing effort 
and resources devoted to these programs, bystander 
AED use remains low.8–10 This is a prominent health con-
cern because out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is as-
sociated with a <10% survival rate and ≈400 
000 deaths 
in North America alone.11,12
Efforts to improve AED use have initially focused on 
identifying locations with high spatial OHCA risk such as 
office buildings or shopping malls for targeted AED place-
ment.13–19 The use of spatial OHCA risk has led to the 
development of optimization models that demonstrate 
that locations for AED placement can be prioritized to 
efficiently target OHCA hot spots.20 However, temporal 
availability of AEDs was not considered in these studies 
and is rarely considered in decisions on where to place 
AEDs. Previous work done by our group and others has 
demonstrated that placing AEDs in locations that are 
not accessible 24 h/d significantly reduces the potential 
usefulness of AEDs.21,22 Optimizing AED locations with 
knowledge of temporal availability could mitigate the 
loss of coverage associated with building hours of op-
eration.22
We hypothesized that the next step to improve AED 
placement in existing PAD programs is to examine 
the potential impact of a strategy that entails partner-
ship with franchise businesses for broad deployment 
of AEDs. Developing partnerships with franchise busi-
nesses can be extremely beneficial to PAD programs 
because they may provide financial support to purchase 
and distribute the AEDs and to improve awareness of 
AED locations through marketing campaigns connected 
with their brand.
The goal of this study is to determine and rank or-
der the spatiotemporal OHCA risk in the immediate 
vicinity of specific businesses and municipal locations 
in Toronto, ON, Canada for the purpose of evaluating 
AED deployment potential to support the development 
of private-public PAD partnerships. This study extends 
previous research that focused only on spatial OHCA risk 
in broad location categories by examining both spatial 
and temporal OHCA risk, as well as more granular lo-
cation types, including individual businesses and munici-
pal locations. Using these rankings, policy makers and 
funders can identify the best organizations with which to 
seek partnership to maximize OHCA coverage of AEDs 
placed in their locations. We hypothesized that certain 
franchise businesses would be more advantageous than 
others for this purpose because of their locations and 
opening hours in relation to actual spatiotemporal car-
diac arrest risk.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This was a retrospective population-based cohort study using 
data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET cardiac arrest 
database, Rescu Epistry, which is compliant with the ROC 
(Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium) Epistry–Cardiac Arrest 
database and the Strategies for Post Arrest Care database; 
the methodologies of these 2 databases are described else-
where.23,24 Approval for this study was obtained from the St. 
Michael’s Hospital Research Ethics Board, and no informed 
consent for participants was required.
We included all nontraumatic, public-location OHCA epi-
sodes that occurred in Toronto from January 2007 through 
December 2015. Public locations included airports, heliports, 
construction sites, office buildings, medical offices, industrial 
sites, mining sites, railways, streets, hotels, restaurants, bars, 
casinos, shopping malls, single stores, strip malls, schools, 
recreation facilities, sports fields, parks, stadiums, golf 
courses, and dockyards; hospitals and nursing homes were 
excluded. Geographical data for the location of each OHCA 
episode, namely street address and latitude-longitude coordi-
nates, were converted to the Universal Transverse Mercator 
format.
A list of registered AEDs, as of March 2015, was obtained 
from Toronto Paramedic Services. The data set contains 912 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• We present novel rankings of specific businesses 
and municipal locations in Toronto, ON, Canada, 
based on spatiotemporal out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest coverage, the number of out-of-hospital car-
diac arrests that occur within 100 m of a given loca-
tion when that location is open based on hours of 
operation, and related metrics.
• We found that coffee shops (Tim Hortons, Starbucks, 
and Second Cup) and automated teller machines 
from the 5 major banks provided the highest out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest coverage, and their rankings 
were stable over time.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Health organizations and policy makers focused on 
developing public-access defibrillator programs can 
use our rankings to identify businesses and munici-
pal locations to develop partnerships for automated 
external defibrillator deployment and public-access 
defibrillator programs.
• These private-public partnerships with businesses 
and municipal locations may provide benefits such 
as financial support and increased automated exter-
nal defibrillator awareness and accessibility and 
reduce the barriers to automated external defibrilla-
tor deployment and distribution.

publicly and privately owned AEDs that are registered with the 
owner’s consent, located in 737 unique addresses. AED reg-
istration is voluntary in Toronto. For each AED, the address, 
location type, and hours of operations were detailed.
Data Collection for Businesses and Municipal 
Locations
The businesses and municipal locations included in this study 
were identified from the Canadian Franchise Association, 
YellowPages, and the City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal.25–27 
The Canadian Franchise Association is the sole recognized 
national trade association of the Canadian franchise indus-
try. It produces an annual franchise directory with up-to-date 
information on current franchisees, including the number of 
locations in Canada, the United States, and internationally. 
YellowPages provides a comprehensive directory of restau-
rants, shops, and services in major cities worldwide. Listings 
are obtained through phone companies and are verified by 
a YellowPages data quality team. The Toronto Open Data 
Portal is part of Toronto’s Open Data initiative to make data 
available for any public use such as research, Web site and 
mobile application development, and data visualization. The 
Open Data Portal is maintained by the City of Toronto and 
contains the address, phone number, facility name, and facil-
ity type for municipally operated services in categorized data 
sets. Information on the portal is collected and maintained by 
municipal staff.
All franchises in the Canadian Franchise Association direc-
tory with >20 locations in Toronto were included. Similarly, all 
stores or businesses listed in YellowPages with >20 locations 
in Toronto were included. Last, all data sets in the Toronto 
Open Data Portal in the business, locations and mapping, 
and parks and recreation categories with ≥20 entries were 
included. Next, we gathered the addresses of each location 
from YellowPages, Google, or the official company Web site. 
Each address was then converted to Universal Transverse 
Mercator format and plotted with the use of a geographic infor-
mation system (QGIS, version 2.4.0, Open Source Geospatial 
Foundation, Beaverton, OR) to ensure that the locations were 
inside the Toronto boundaries. In total, we identified 41 busi-
nesses and municipal locations, totaling 4949 individual 
facilities (see Table I in the online-only Data Supplement for a 
summary of the included businesses and municipal locations). 
Businesses that were typically accessible only through a larger 
building such as restaurant chains found exclusively in shop-
ping mall food courts were excluded from the study. We cat-
egorized and examined the businesses and municipal locations 
for both downtown Toronto, as defined by the City of Toronto,28 
and Toronto as a whole.
We gathered the hours of operation of each facility 
through online resources, by phone, or through in-person 
visits. Hours of operation could not be confirmed for 91 of 
the 223 separate schools (ie, religious schools) and 453 
of the 952 automated teller machines (ATMs) included in 
this study. For these location types, we assumed hours of 
operation on the basis of collected/known hours of opera-
tions for facilities in the same location type. The assumed 
hours used were 8 am to 5 pm for separate schools and 8 
am to 11 pm for in-branch ATMs. We conducted sensitivity 
analyses (section 1.2 and Tables II–VII in the online-only Data 
Supplement) to examine the impact of the assumed hours on 
OHCA coverage.
Analysis 1: Ranking Businesses and Municipal 
Locations by Spatiotemporal OHCA Coverage
For each of the 41 businesses and municipal locations, we 
calculated the following data elements using all public non-
traumatic OHCAs: the total number of their facilities; the total 
number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of any of their 
facilities (assumed 24/7 coverage); the total number of OHCAs 
that occurred within 100 m of their facilities and when the 
respective facility was open on the basis of its hours of opera-
tions (actual coverage); the assumed 24/7 coverage minus 
actual coverage divided by assumed 24/7 coverage (cover-
age loss); and the actual coverage divided by the number of 
facilities (coverage efficiency). Cardiac arrest coverage was 
calculated independently for each of the 41 businesses and

municipal locations. Therefore, if an OHCA was covered by 2 
different businesses, it was counted as a covered OHCA for 
both businesses. The 100-m coverage radius (109.4 yd) was 
based on American Heart Association recommendations and a 
3-minute response goal.7,29,30
We repeated the coverage analysis using only OHCAs that 
were not already covered by the existing registered AEDs in 
Toronto. In other words, all OHCAs that occurred within 100 
m of a registered AED while the AED was available, based 
on hours of operation of the buildings housing the AED, were 
excluded from this analysis.
Analysis 2: Temporal Stability of the Businesses 
and Municipal Location Coverage Rankings
To measure the variation in the rankings over time, we sepa-
rated the cardiac arrest data by year of occurrence and cal-
culated the actual coverage provided by each business and 
municipal location in each year. We then computed the intra-
class correlation of the annual values and a corresponding 
95% confidence interval using a 2-way random-effect model, 
intraclass correlation (C,1), as defined by McGraw and Wong.31
Analysis 3: Ranking Broad Location Categories 
by Spatiotemporal OHCA Coverage
To enable comparisons with other studies and for generalizabil-
ity, the 41 businesses and municipal locations were grouped 
into 1 of 14 broader location categories, and the same metrics 
from analysis 1 were recalculated. We also repeated this cov-
erage analysis using only OHCAs that were not already covered 
by the existing registered AEDs in Toronto.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Cardiac Arrest Episodes
A total of 27 
650 nontraumatic OHCAs occurred from 
January 2007 through December 2015 in the City of 
Toronto. Of these, 2654 occurred in a public setting, 
with 506 of them occurring in the downtown area. The 
characteristics of the included public cardiac arrests are 
summarized in Table 1.
Analysis 1: Ranking Businesses and Municipal 
Locations by Spatiotemporal OHCA Coverage
Table 2 ranks the 41 businesses and municipal loca-
tions in descending order of actual coverage in Toron-
to. The top-ranked businesses were Tim Hortons (actu-
al coverage=286), Royal Bank of Canada ATMs (actual 
coverage=243), and Subway restaurants (actual cov-
erage=228). Coffee shops (Tim Hortons, Starbucks, 
and Second Cup) and ATMs of the 5 major Canadian 
banks (Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Ca-
nadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion 
Bank, and Bank of Montreal) occupied 8 of the top 10 
location types. The top-ranked businesses in coverage 
efficiency were 7-Eleven (coverage efficiency=1.92), 
Burger King (coverage efficiency=1.73), and Second 
Cup (coverage efficiency=1.39). The businesses with 
the largest coverage loss were Wendy’s (coverage 
loss=78.6%), UPS Stores (coverage loss=67.7%), and 
Scotiabank branches (coverage loss=62.9%). The geo-
graphical distribution of the top 5 ranked location types 
is shown in Figures I through XI in the online-only Data 
Supplement.
Table 3 summarizes the result of the downtown 
subgroup analysis. The top-ranked businesses by ac-
tual coverage were Starbucks (actual coverage=110), 
Tim Hortons (actual coverage=97), and Royal Bank of 
Canada ATMs (actual coverage=94). The same coffee 
shop chains and bank ATMs in the top 10 of Table 2 
occupied 8 of the top 10 rankings in downtown but in a 
different order. The top-ranked businesses by coverage 
efficiency were Burger King (coverage efficiency=4.25), 
7-Eleven (coverage efficiency=3.50), and Pizza Nova 
(coverage efficiency=3.17). The largest coverage 
losses were experienced by schools: separate (reli-
gious) schools (coverage loss=100.0%), public schools 
(coverage loss=77.8%), and private schools (coverage 
loss=71.4%).

shops (Tim Hortons, Starbucks, and Second Cup) and 
ATMs of the 5 major Canadian banks remained in the 
top 10. The rankings for the downtown subgroup can 
be found in Table VIII in the online-only Data Supplement.
Analysis 2: Temporal Stability of the Businesses 
and Municipal Location Coverage Rankings
Table 5 shows the actual coverage for each business and 
municipal location in Toronto for each year from 2007 to 
2015. Table 6 shows the same data for the downtown 
subgroup. Results in both tables were sorted by aver-
age annual actual coverage. Rankings for each individual 
year were also determined. The intraclass correlation 
values were 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) 
for Toronto overall and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 
0.71–0.86) for downtown Toronto, indicating high stabil-
ity of the coverage values over time.
Analysis 3: Ranking Broad Location Categories 
by Spatiotemporal OHCA Coverage
Tables 7 and 8 summarize the rankings of the broad 
location categories for Toronto and downtown Toronto, 
respectively. They are ranked in descending order of 
actual coverage. Reflecting the individual business and 
municipal location rankings, the bank ATM category 
and coffee shop category were both ranked highly. The 
bank ATM category was ranked first in both Toronto 
and downtown Toronto. The coffee shop category was 
ranked third and second in the 2 areas, respectively. 
Restaurant chains ranked highly as well but consisted 
of the most number of individual businesses (n = 9) than 
any other category (see Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement for the taxonomy of individual businesses 
and municipal locations in broad location categories). 
Convenience stores had the highest coverage efficiency 
in both Toronto (coverage efficiency=1.21) and down-
town (coverage efficiency=3.00). The largest coverage 
losses were experienced by schools in both Toronto 
(coverage loss=56.3%) and downtown Toronto (cover-
age loss=73.5%).
The broad location category rankings with respect 
to the public OHCAs that are not already covered by a 
registered AED in Toronto can be found in Tables IX and 
X in the online-only Data Supplement. In this case, bank 
ATMs, coffee shops, and restaurant chains retained their 
top 3 rankings in both Toronto and downtown Toronto.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we determined novel rankings of specific 
businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal 
OHCA coverage in Toronto, Canada. We found that 8 of 
the top 10 location types in both Toronto overall and 
downtown Toronto were coffee shops and bank ATMs. 
Furthermore, the rankings were fairly stable over time. 
For example, most of the top 10 location types in actual 
coverage remained in the top 10 for every year from 
2007 to 2015. When the individual businesses and 
municipal locations were consolidated into broad loca-
tion categories, coffee shops and bank ATMs remained 
among the highest-ranking location categories in spatio-
temporal coverage.
The analysis presented in Table 4 sheds light on the 
potential impact of implementing a private-public AED 
partnership in a realistic case in which there are existing 
AEDs deployed. We found that ATMs and coffee shops 
retained their high ranking even after removing OHCAs 
already covered by existing AEDs. However, these find-
ings are specific to Toronto and are not meant to be 
generalized to other settings because each city’s exist-
ing public AED network is unique.
Besides providing high coverage for spatiotemporal 
OHCA risk, bank ATMs and coffee shops may be promis-
ing locations for AED deployment for additional reasons. 
For example, ATMs offer additional security (eg, video 
cameras), weather protection (eg, electricity to heat an 
AED cabinet), increased accessibility (many are avail-
able 24/7 and located outdoors), and broad recognition

(most people would know where to find an ATM locally 
and they are easily recognized, even in foreign cities). 
Like ATMs, coffee shops tend to be geographically wide-
spread, to be located in more populated areas with op-
erating hours that extend past general working hours, 
and to have strong brand recognition. Our results also 
show that ATMs and coffee shops have high coverage 
efficiency, which means that partnerships with these 
businesses may make more effective use of limited re-
sources for AED deployment. Furthermore, our stabil-
ity results suggest that ATMs and coffee shops, like the 
other high-potential locations for AED deployment, will 
remain good choices in the future, which is an important 
consideration because AEDs are typically not moved 
after they are deployed. Relocating AEDs also has the 
negative side effect of disrupting any public association 
between AEDs and specific locations. We believe the 
combinations of characteristics described make these 
businesses strong candidates for potential PAD program 
partnerships.
Our stability results are consistent with a previous 
study that demonstrated temporal stability of OHCA 
incidence in Toronto.32 In fact, our intraclass correla-
tion values were even higher than found in the previous 
study, which examined OHCA incidence in all 140 neigh-
borhoods in Toronto. These neighborhoods aggregate 
the risk of many different businesses and communities 
into one number. We believe that examining more granu-
lar location categories such as specific businesses and 
municipal locations results in more consistent measure-
ments from year to year. Our analysis of risk in specific 
locations further supports the notion of committing re-
sources to high-risk areas to help improve survival out-
comes because high-risk areas will remain high-risk long 
term.
Rankings based on the broad location categories 
(Tables 7 and 8) are important for generalizability of our 
findings beyond Toronto. Our findings are in line with 
previous studies conducted in Denmark and Canada 
that examined the spatial-only OHCA risk at broad loca-
tion categories. They identified large businesses (busi-
nesses with at least 150 employees), supermarkets, 
offices, and retail stores as locations with high absolute 
OHCA risk.13,15 However, it is also important to examine 
specific businesses and municipal locations because 
OHCA risk can vary significantly within a broad location 
category. For example, the restaurant chain category is 
ranked second in spatiotemporal coverage among the 
broad location categories, but the 9 individual restau-
rants that make up the category rank between 3rd and 
37th of 41 total businesses/municipal locations, with 
an average rank of 24. Furthermore, to achieve the 
coverage indicated by a broad location category would 
potentially require working with many different (often 
competing) businesses, each with its own decision-
making processes. Overall, by examining specific loca-
tion types, we can obtain more accurate estimates of 
spatiotemporal cardiac arrest risk to help direct policy 
decisions and public-private partnerships to improve fu-
ture PAD placement.
 Ranking locations by actual coverage takes into ac-
count temporal accessibility, which has been shown to 
significantly affect the potential availability of AEDs in 
an emergency situation.21,22 If AEDs are placed inside a 
business, then actual coverage is the appropriate met-
ric to consider. However, if AEDs can be made avail-
able 24 h/d (eg, in a cabinet outside the building), then 
the relevant coverage metric becomes assumed 24/7 
coverage. The coverage loss metric, which measures 
the relative difference between assumed 24/7 cov-
erage and actual coverage, quantifies the additional 
value of having around-the-clock access to AEDs. For 
example, Wendy’s is ranked first in terms of coverage 
loss, which means that 24/7 accessible AEDs would 
be much more valuable than AEDs placed inside the 
restaurant, which would be unavailable when the restau-
rant is closed.
Coverage efficiency, which measures the actual 
coverage per facility, is an indicator of how much cov-
erage can be provided by an AED placed at a single 
location. Businesses with high coverage efficiency 
tended to have fewer total facilities compared with

the average. For almost all location types analyzed, 
coverage efficiency was higher in downtown Toronto, 
most likely because of increased population density. 
Although coverage efficiency does not equal cost-
effectiveness, it can be used to gauge the value of 
an AED placed in a specific business or municipal 
location. We hypothesize that placing AEDs in busi-
nesses with high coverage efficiency will be more 
cost-effective than placing AEDs in locations with low 
coverage efficiency. AED placement strategies based 
on OHCA risk and optimization have been found to be 
cost-effective.13,30
These rankings may be helpful to municipalities, pub-
lic safety agencies, and policy makers involved in PAD 
programs, especially when public-private partnerships 
for AEDs are being considered. Business-based partner-
ships for AED deployment have several advantages be-
yond coverage of OHCA risk. For example, these orga-
nizations may provide financial support to buy AEDs and 
marketing support to improve PAD program awareness 
in connection with their brand. By deploying AEDs in all 
locations of well-known and highly visible franchises (eg, 
well-known coffee shop chains) and undertaking a well-
planned public awareness campaign, communities may 
be able to increase access to and awareness of AEDs. 
Large businesses with a national presence may also be 
able to provide the necessary financial resources, infra-
structure, and leadership to support a nationwide PAD 
program partnership.
There are some previous examples of public-private 
partnerships in AED deployment. Recently, >60 public 
AEDs were installed in outdoor cabinets integrated with 
advertisement boards in Vienna in partnership with a lo-
cal advertising company.33,34 Across Japan, AEDs have 
also been installed in vending machines and advertise-
ment boards.35 Both partnerships were made possible 
through creative financing, including contributions from 
advertising and vending machine revenues, the AED dis-
tributor, and the municipalities. In addition to the possibil-
ity of broad geographical coverage, like that provided by 
advertisement boards and vending machines, business-
es and municipal locations have the additional potential 
to improve response by having trained employees act as 
responders on site. Our rankings examined the total cov-
erage of all facilities of a single business, modeling the 
potential coverage of universal AED deployment, that is, 
placing AEDs in all locations of the business. Universal 
deployment can give bystanders confidence that they 
will find an AED at any location of that business. How-
ever, not all locations of the same business may have 
the same risk, and resource limitations may outweigh 
the benefits of universal deployment. In that case, op-
timizing AED deployment to a subset of the locations 
may provide maximum benefit within a constrained bud-
get.20,22,30
Coverage, risk, and AED accessibility are only a few 
of the factors that need to be considered in the design 
of a PAD program. Additional factors such as security, 
signage, emergency medical services integration, regis-
tration with local emergency medical services dispatch, 
existing AED placements, and the presence of trained 
responders also are key considerations. For example, 
an area with good coverage from existing AEDs may 
receive only marginal benefit from additional AED de-
ployment in that area. More benefit might be realized 
by expanding the coverage radius of existing AEDs in 
that area through improved signage, accessibility, or em-
ployee training.36
Limitations
As a measure of temporal availability, we used the hours 
of operation associated with each facility. These hours 
of operation were collected at one point in the year, but 
we note that hours may fluctuate seasonally. Hours of 
operations used in the analysis do not account for holi-
day closures.
In our analysis of ranking stability, we assumed that 
all facilities of each business or municipal location were 
present every year on the basis of presence at the time 
of data collection. Thus, depending on whether there 
were more or fewer locations of a certain business in 
the past, our coverage values could be underestimated 
or overestimated, respectively.

We used 20 businesses as a cutoff so as to fo-
cus on large, recognizable businesses in this study. 
These large businesses would make the most sense 
for public-private partnerships from the perspective 
of visibility. However, as a result of this cutoff, it is 
possible that we did not include certain businesses 
and municipal locations in the study that could be ben-
eficial for improving OHCA coverage and developing 
AED programs.
This analysis was conducted with cardiac arrest 
and franchise data from Toronto. The businesses we 
examined were specific to Toronto and may not exist 
in other cities. It is also important to note that public 
OHCAs, the focus of this article, make up a minority 
of all OHCAs.
Conclusions
We determined novel rankings of specific businesses 
and municipal locations in terms of spatiotemporal 
OHCA coverage in Toronto, ON, Canada, and found that 
they exhibit high temporal stability, suggesting that loca-
tions that maximize coverage would continue to do so 
over time. Overall, we found that coffee shops and bank

ATMs ranked highly. Our rankings can help policy makers 
and funders to identify and prioritize potential partner-
ships for AED deployment, which can increase the dis-
tribution and awareness of AED locations and ultimately 
help improve OHCA survival.
