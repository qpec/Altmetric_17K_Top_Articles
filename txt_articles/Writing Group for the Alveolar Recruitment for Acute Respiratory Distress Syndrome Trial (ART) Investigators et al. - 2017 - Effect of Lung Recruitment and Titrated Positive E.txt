 Effect of Lung Recruitment and Titrated Positive
End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) vs Low PEEP on Mortality
in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Writing Group for the Alveolar Recruitment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial (ART) Investigators
IMPORTANCE The effects of recruitment maneuvers and positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP) titration on clinical outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To determine if lung recruitment associated with PEEP titration according to the
best respiratory-system compliance decreases 28-day mortality of patients with moderate to
severe ARDS compared with a conventional low-PEEP strategy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, randomized trial conducted at 120
intensive care units (ICUs) from 9 countries from November 17, 2011, through April 25, 2017,
enrolling adults with moderate to severe ARDS.
INTERVENTIONS An experimental strategy with a lung recruitment maneuver and PEEP
titration according to the best respiratory–system compliance (n = 501; experimental group)
or a control strategy of low PEEP (n = 509). All patients received volume-assist control mode
until weaning.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was all-cause mortality until 28 days.
Secondary outcomes were length of ICU and hospital stay; ventilator-free days through day
28; pneumothorax requiring drainage within 7 days; barotrauma within 7 days; and ICU,
in-hospital, and 6-month mortality.
RESULTS A total of 1010 patients (37.5% female; mean [SD] age, 50.9 [17.4] years) were
enrolled and followed up. At 28 days, 277 of 501 patients (55.3%) in the experimental group
and 251 of 509 patients (49.3%) in the control group had died (hazard ratio [HR], 1.20; 95%
CI, 1.01 to 1.42; P = .041). Compared with the control group, the experimental group strategy
increased 6-month mortality (65.3% vs 59.9%; HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.38; P = .04),
decreased the number of mean ventilator-free days (5.3 vs 6.4; difference, −1.1; 95% CI, −2.1
to −0.1; P = .03), increased the risk of pneumothorax requiring drainage (3.2% vs 1.2%;
difference, 2.0%; 95% CI, 0.0% to 4.0%; P = .03), and the risk of barotrauma (5.6% vs 1.6%;
difference, 4.0%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 6.5%; P = .001). There were no significant differences in
the length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, ICU mortality, and in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with moderate to severe ARDS, a strategy with
lung recruitment and titrated PEEP compared with low PEEP increased 28-day all-cause
mortality. These findings do not support the routine use of lung recruitment maneuver and
PEEP titration in these patients.

 A
cute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a com-
mon clinical problem among critically ill patients and
is associated with high mortality and limited long-
term quality of life.1,2 The functional lung size is decreased in
ARDS,sincemanylungunitsbecomepoorlyornonaerateddue
to collapse, flooding, or consolidation.3 This places patients at
increased risk of ventilator-induced lung injury due both to
overdistention of aerated lung units and cyclic opening and
closing of small airways and alveoli (atelectrauma).4-6
The aim of recruitment maneuvers and positive end-
expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration is to open collapsed lung
units and keep them opened, potentially decreasing the risk
of atelectrauma. Prospective noncontrolled trials have shown
that a lung recruitment maneuver with stepwise increases in
PEEP, achieving inspiratory pressures up to 60 cm H2O, is
able to open most of the collapsed lung tissue in patients
with ARDS.7,8 Two randomized trials9,10 comparing similar
recruitment maneuvers followed by decremental PEEP titra-
tion vs a well-established low-PEEP strategy6 suggested ben-
eficial effects on oxygenation, respiratory-system compli-
ance, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, without
increasing barotrauma or other adverse events. Additionally,
systematic reviews evaluating recruitment maneuvers sug-
gested a reduction in mortality, also without increase in
barotrauma.11,12 However, quality of evidence is limited by
high risk of bias in most trials and variable use of cointerven-
tions. Thus, the Alveolar Recruitment for ARDS Trial (ART)
was conducted to assess whether a strategy of lung recruit-
ment maneuver associated with PEEP titrated according to
the best respiratory-system compliance vs a well-established
low-PEEP strategy6 improves clinical outcomes of patients
with moderate to severe ARDS.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
We conducted a randomized clinical trial in 120 intensive care
units(ICUs)from9countries(Brazil,Argentina,Colombia,Italy,
Poland, Portugal, Malaysia, Spain, and Uruguay). The proto-
col and statistical analysis plan (in Supplement 1) were pub-
lished previously.13,14 Data analysis started after the statisti-
cal analysis plan was accepted for publication (see eAppendix
in Supplement 2 for details). Ethics committees of all institu-
tionsapprovedthestudy.Informedconsentwasobtainedfrom
all patients’representatives. An independent data monitor-
ing committee oversaw efficacy and safety data.
Patients
We enrolled patients receiving invasive mechanical ventila-
tion with moderate to severe ARDS of less than 72 hours
of duration. Eligibility was evaluated in 2 phases, a screening
andaconfirmatoryphase.Inthescreeningphase,patientswere
considered for inclusion in the study if they met the American-
European Consensus Conference criteria15 for ARDS. The ex-
clusion criteria were age younger than 18 years; use of vaso-
constrictor drugs in increasing doses over the past 2 hours or
mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 65 mm Hg; contrain-
dications to hypercapnia, such as intracranial hypertension or
acute coronary syndrome; pneumothorax, subcutaneous em-
physema, pneumomediastinum or pneumatocele; patients in
palliative care only; or previously enrolled patients.
Before confirming eligibility, patients received at least
3 hours of mechanical ventilation using a low-PEEP and low-
tidal volume strategy proposed by the Acute Respiratory Dis-
tress Syndrome Network (ARDSNet).6 After that, the fraction
of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was set at 100% and the PEEP at
10 cm H2O or more for 30 minutes and arterial blood gases
were collected. Eligibility was confirmed if the ratio of the
partial pressure (PaO2) of oxygen to the FIO2 (PaO2:FIO2) was
200 or lower and less than 72 hours had passed since the first
time a PaO2:FIO2 ratio of 200 or less was determined.
Randomization and Masking
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a strategy of lung re-
cruitment associated with PEEP adjusted according to the
respiratory-system compliance or to a low-PEEP strategy.
The random allocation list was generated by a statistician with
no clinical involvement in the trial using a computer-
generated random number list. Randomization was con-
ducted with blocks of 4 and stratification by site, age (≤55 years
or>55years)andPaO2:FIO2ratio(≤100or>100).Allocationcon-
cealment was ensured via a central web-based system. The
treatment to which a patient was allocated was disclosed only
after the patient was enrolled in the study.
Participant, clinicians, and outcome assessors were aware
of the assigned treatment.
Interventions
Patients assigned to the control group continued to receive
the low-PEEP strategy.6 Immediately after randomization, pa-
tients assigned to the experimental strategy received a bolus
of neuromuscular blocker and hemodynamic status was
maintained by administering intravenous fluids when there
were signs of fluid responsiveness. Then, we conducted a lung
recruitment maneuver with incremental PEEP levels, fol-
lowed by a decremental PEEP titration according to the best
respiratory-system static compliance and by a second recruit-
ment maneuver. The lung recruitment maneuver and PEEP

 titration technique were based on those used in previous non-
controlled studies.7,8 After recruitment and PEEP titration, pa-
tients were ventilated under volume-assist control mode with
PEEP set at the titrated value (the PEEP associated with high-
est respiratory-system compliance plus 2 cm H2O). If PaO2:
FIO2 levels were stable or increasing for 24 hours or more af-
ter recruitment, weaning of PEEP was started with decreases
of 2 cm H2O every 8 hours. Apart from the lung recruitment
maneuver and PEEP titration scheme, other aspects of care
were similar for both groups. The experimental and control
group procedures are detailed in the protocol and the manual
of operations (Supplements 1 and 3).
Initially, we applied a recruitment maneuver using pres-
sure-controlled ventilation and driving pressure of 15 cm H2O.
We started with a PEEP of 25 cm H2O for 1 minute, then a PEEP
of 35 cm H2O for 1 minute, and then 45 cm H2O for 2 minutes.
Afterrecruitment,decrementalPEEPtitrationwasstartedwith
a PEEP of 23 cm H2O in volume-controlled mode. PEEP levels
were decreased in steps of 3 cm H2O down to a minimum of
11 cm H2O. After 4 minutes in each step, we measured respi-
ratory-system static compliance. The PEEP associated with the
best compliance plus 2 cm H2O was considered the optimal
PEEP. After PEEP titration, a new recruitment in pressure-
controlled ventilation was conducted in 1 step using PEEP of
45 cm H2O for 2 minutes.
In June 2015, starting with the 556th patient, the steering
committee, in consultation with the data monitoring com-
mittee, decided to modify the recruitment maneuver and
PEEP titration strategy after 3 cases of resuscitated cardiac
arrest possibly associated with the experimental group treat-
ment were observed. During the recruitment maneuver,
PEEP was increased to 25 cm H2O, 30 cm H2O, and then
35 cm H2O, in steps of 1 minute. Maximum plateau pressure
was 50 cm H2O. Decremental PEEP trial was shorter, with
each PEEP step lasting 3 minutes, followed by a new recruit-
ment maneuver with PEEP of 35 cm H2O.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was mortality until 28 days. Sec-
ondary outcomes were length of ICU and hospital stay;
ventilator-free days from day 1 until day 28; pneumothorax
requiring drainage within 7 days; barotrauma within 7 days;
and ICU, in-hospital, and 6-month mortality. We defined as
pneumothorax requiring drainage for any case that was pos-
sibly due to barotrauma; that is, we did not consider cases
judged to be clearly caused by invasive procedures such as
central venous punction or thoracocentesis. We defined
as barotrauma within 7 days any pneumothorax, pneumo-
mediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumatocele
of more than 2 cm detected on image examinations between

 randomization and 7 days, except those judged to be clearly
caused by invasive procedures.
Other exploratory outcomes were death with refractory
hypoxemia within 7 days; death with refractory acidosis
within 7 days; death with barotrauma within 7 days; cardio-
respiratory arrest on day 1; need of commencement or
increase of vasopressors or hypotension (MAP<65 mm Hg)
within 1 hour after randomization; refractory hypoxemia
(PaO2<55 mm Hg) within 1 hour after randomization; and
severe acidosis (pH<7.10) within 1 hour after randomization.
Length of ICU stay (secondary outcome) and all other ex-
ploratory outcomes were included in our statistical analysis
plan14 and ClinicalTrials.gov, although they were not origi-
nally in our study protocol (see eAppendix in Supplement 2
for details).
Statistical Analysis
ART was an event-driven study designed to continue until
520 events (28-day deaths) had accrued. This number of
events was estimated to provide 90% power, assuming a haz-
ard ratio of 0.75 and type I error of 5%. This hazard ratio is
similar to the size of effect used to estimate sample size in
other trials in the field.16,17
All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle,
considering all patients in the treatment groups to which
they were randomly assigned, except for cases lost to
follow-up. We carried out complete-case analysis for all out-
comes. We planned to conduct sensitivity analysis for the
primary outcome using multiple imputation techniques
only if follow-up data of 1% or more of the patients was lost.
Baseline characteristics were reported as counts and per-
centages, mean and standard deviation (SD), or median and
interquartile range (IQR), whenever appropriate. Hypothesis
tests were 2-sided. Two interim analyses were performed
after recruitment of one-third and two-thirds of the plan-
ned sample size to assess effects on clinical outcomes.
The data monitoring committee would consider stopping
the trial early if there was evidence of harm with 1-sided
P value <.01. The significance level for the primary outcome
final analysis was .042, to maintain overall α at .05. For all
other outcomes, the significance level was .05, without
adjustment for multiple comparisons. Because of this, all
secondary outcomes and analyses should be interpreted
as exploratory.
We assessed the effect of the trial treatments on the pri-
mary outcome using Kaplan-Meier curves and calculated the
hazard ratio with 95% CI using the Cox proportional hazard
model. We conducted 2 sensitivity analyses. The first was a
prespecified Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for
age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) score, and
PaO2:FIO2 ratio. The second was a post hoc frailty Cox model
with stratification variables (site, age, and PaO2:FIO2) as ran-
dom effects.
We used Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional
hazard model to assess the effect of treatment on 6-month
survival. We assessed the effects of the intervention on
categorical variables with risk ratios and 95% CIs, and we
used the χ2 test to compare between-group differences. For

 continuous outcomes, we estimated the effects of the inter-
vention with generalized linear models using gamma distri-
butions (for lengths of ICU and hospital stay) or a truncated
Poisson distribution (for ventilator-free days).
We used Cox proportional hazards to assess interactions
between treatment effect and the following prespecified sub-
groups: PaO2:FIO2 (≤100 vs >100 mm Hg); SAPS 3 score (<50
vs ≥50); pulmonary vs extrapulmonary ARDS; duration of
ARDS (≤36 hours vs >36 to <72 hours); mechanical ventilation
(≤2 days, 3-4 days, ≥5 days); and prone position. As an explor-
atory analysis, we tested whether treatment effects were simi-
lar before and after the protocol amendment of June 2015. We
also tested in a post hoc analysis whether treatment effects per
quartiles according to order of enrollment in the trial (earlier
vslater)werehomogeneous.Allanalyseswereperformedusing
the R (R Core Team, 2016) software.
Results
Patients
From November 17, 2011, through April 25, 2017, we screened
2077 patients with moderate to severe ARDS. A total of 1064
were not enrolled, of whom 863 (81.1%) met exclusion crite-
ria and 201 (18.9%) were eligible but were not enrolled for
other reasons. We randomized 1013 patients, 501 to the lung
recruitment strategy and 512 to the low-PEEP strategy. Repre-
sentatives of 3 patients assigned to the control group with-
drew consent to use study data. We obtained 28-day and
6-month follow-up data of all remaining patients, except for
23 who were followed up and censored between 2 and 6
months. Thus, data of 1010 patients (501 in the experimental
group and 509 in the control groups) were considered for the
final analysis. The data monitoring committee evaluated 2
interim analyses and recommended the trial to be continued.
(Figure 1)
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between
the study groups (Table 1). Two-thirds of the patients had
septic shock. The mean number of nonpulmonary organ
failures was more than 2. Most ARDS cases were of pulmo-
nary (62.0%) rather than extrapulmonary origin (38.0%).
In the experimental and control groups, baseline mean (SD)
tidal volume and plateau pressures were 5.8 (1.1) and
5.8 (1.0) mL/Kg of predicted body weight, and 25.8 (4.7)
and 26.2 (5.2) cm H2O, respectively.
Lung Recruitment
A total of 480 patients (95.8%) in the experimental group re-
ceived a lung recruitment maneuver after randomization
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). In 78 cases (15.6%) the maneuver
had to be interrupted, most often due to hypotension or a de-
crease in oxygen saturation. In 21 cases, a recruitment maneu-
ver was not attempted due to uncontrolled hypotension
(14 cases), detection of pneumothorax (3 cases) after random-
ization, or other reasons (4 cases). The mean (SD) titrated PEEP
was 16.8 (3.8) cm H2O. Lung recruitment was repeated after
PEEP titration in 393 patients (78.4%). After the initial recruit-
ment and PEEP titration, alveolar recruitment was not re-
peated from day 1 to 7 in most patients (62.7%). Conversely,
28patientsinthecontrolgroupalsoreceivedarecruitmentma-
neuver within the first 7 days.
Ventilator Settings and Respiratory Variables
Mean PEEP values from hour 1 through day 7 were higher in
the experimental than in the control group (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). Mean values of plateau pressure were also
higher in the experimental group, although always below
30 cm H2O in both groups. Mean tidal volumes were below
6 mL/kg of predicted body weight in both groups from hour 1
through day 3. The mean PaO2:FIO2 ratios were higher in the
experimental group. Yet decreases in driving pressure from
control to experimental group were limited to less than 2 cm
H2O from day 1 through day 7. Partial pressure of carbon di-
oxide was higher and arterial pH was lower in experimental
group only at the first hour, with values that were not signifi-
cantly different after day 1.
Cointerventions
Use of neuromuscular blockers was higher in the experimen-
tal than the control group (96.8% vs 73.3%; difference, 23.5%;
95%CI,19.2%-27.9%;P < .001),reflectingtheprotocolrequire-
ment for their use before the recruitment maneuver (eTable 3
in Supplement 2). The proportion of patients who received
sedatives on any day was higher in the experimental group
(99.0%vs97.1%;difference,1.9%;95%CI,0.0%-3.9%;P = .05),
although there was no difference between groups in the me-
dian number of days receiving sedatives. There were no dif-
ferences among groups in other cointerventions or on the need
of rescue therapies for hypoxemia.
Outcomes
At 28 days, there were 277 deaths (55.3%) among 501 patients
in the experimental group and 251 deaths (49.3%) among 509
patients in the control group, with a hazard ratio of 1.20 (95%
CI, 1.01-1.42; P = .041) (Figure 2). After adjustment for base-
line covariates, age, SAPS 3, and PaO2:FIO2, the hazard ratio for

 28-day mortality was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.03-1.45; P = .02). In the
post hoc frailty Cox model, the hazard ratio was 1.21 (95% CI,
1.02-1.44; P = .03).
All-cause mortality was also higher within 6 months in
the experimental than in the control group (65.3% vs 59.9%;
hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.38; P = .04) (Table 2). Differ-
ences in the ICU or in-hospital mortality between groups
were not statistically significant. Compared with the control
group, mortality in the experimental group was higher during
the first 7 days, with increased rates of death with baro-
trauma (Table 2). There were no significant differences in the
rates of death with refractory hypoxemia, death with acido-
sis, and cardiorespiratory arrest between groups. Lengths of
stay in the ICU or hospital were also not significantly differ-
ent. The experimental group had fewer ventilator-free days
during the first 28 days. The rates of pneumothorax requiring
drainage and rates of any barotrauma increased in the experi-
mental group. Within 1 hour, commencement or increase in
vasopressors or hypotension were more common in the
experimental group, but there were no differences in refrac-
tory hypoxemia or severe acidosis.
Subgroup and Exploratory Analyses
Effects of experimental vs control strategy on 28-day mor-
tality were not significantly different across subgroups
(Figure 3). Treatment effects were also not significantly dif-
ferent in the periods of study before and after the protocol
was modified with reduction in the length and in the maxi-
mum PEEP and pressure levels of the recruitment maneuver
(P = .89). Treatment effects were also not significantly dif-
ferent per quartiles according to order of enrollment in the
trial (P = .76).

 Discussion
In this trial enrolling adults with moderate to severe ARDS,
a strategy of lung recruitment and PEEP titration according
to the respiratory-system compliance increased 28-day mor-
tality compared with an established low-PEEP strategy.
In addition, the lung recruitment strategy increased 6-month
mortality, the risk of any barotrauma and death with baro-
trauma, and the need for vasopressors or hypotension in
the first hour. Conversely, the lung recruitment strategy
decreased the number of days free of mechanical ventilation
during 28 days.
One potential explanation for the findings of this trial
relates to an unfavorable balance between potential positive
(reduction in driving pressure)10 and negative (increase in
overdistention, hemodynamic impairment)18,19 physiological
consequences of lung recruitment and PEEP. Although
some studies showed almost full opening of collapsed alveoli
after recruitment maneuvers achieving high inspiratory pres-
sures,7,8 only mild responses were observed in this trial as
suggested by the small increments in the respiratory-system
compliance and reductions in driving pressure. Furthermore,
the driving pressure, a strong predictor of survival in
ARDS,20,21 decreased by a mean of only less than 2 cm of
water. On the contrary, the risk of barotrauma within 7 days
and signs of hemodynamic impairment within 1 hour
increased in the experimental group, suggesting lung injury
and hemodynamic impairment as mechanisms that may
have driven increased mortality. Nevertheless, the incidence
of barotrauma, even in the experimental group, was lower
than in any previous studies using high PEEP levels.22
Another potential explanation for the results observed in
this trial lies in the lung protective characteristics of the con-
trol group, which may have offset any potential physiological
advantages of the lung recruitment and PEEP titration strat-
egy. The control group strategy called for a tidal volume of
6 mL/kg (or less if plateau pressure was >30 cm H2O) and use
of lower PEEP levels.6 Adherence to low tidal volume was
very strict, with lower mean tidal volumes than the ARDSNet
trials.6,23 Conversely, PEEP values were approximately 3 cm
H2O higher than that observed in control groups from previ-
ous studies.22 The use of strictly low tidal volumes and
resulting low driving pressures may have reduced lung injury
due to tidal overdistention. Furthermore, intermediate levels
of PEEP may have contributed to maximizing homogeneity
and preventing atelectrauma.
A third possible explanation for the findings of this trial
is the breath stacking phenomenon, which may occur inad-
vertently in patients receiving protective ventilation, espe-
cially in the volume-assist control mode and with low tidal
volumes.24,25 It was documented in 1 patient enrolled in
the experimental group and routinely monitored with elec-
trical impedance tomography (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).

 The patient received 12 mL/kg of effective tidal volume in
more than 40% of the breaths, whereas the ventilator dis-
played 6 mL/kg. Although the incidence of this phenom-
enon was likely similar in both groups, it may have caused
more lung overstretch with disproportionally higher driving
pressures in patients submitted to higher PEEP levels.
The choice of the ARDSNet table of lower instead of
higher PEEP values for the control group in this trial might be
questioned, since an individual patient data meta-analysis
suggested a survival benefit for higher PEEP levels in the
subgroup of patients with moderate to severe ARDS.22
Three main reasons supported the option for lower PEEP val-
ues. First, the meta-analysis did not show benefit of high
PEEP for the overall group of patients with ARDS.22 Second,
none of the individual trials showed a significant effect on
mortality.17,23,26 Third, the trials included in the meta-
analysis used substantially different strategies both in the
experimental and control groups, with variable use of recruit-
ment maneuvers. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the
potential benefit was due to higher PEEP or to the lung
recruitment maneuver itself.
This trial has strengths. Bias was controlled by using con-
cealed allocation, intention-to-treat analysis, and by avoiding
losses to follow-up. Analyses were based on a large number
of events, which allowed for adequate random error control.
Patient eligibility was confirmed only after ventilation with a
lung protective low-tidal volume strategy and standardized
FIO2 and PEEP settings before collecting arterial blood gases.
Except for the lung recruitment maneuvers and PEEP titra-
tion scheme, identical mechanical ventilation protocol with
low-tidal volume was applied for both groups. In addition,
the study involved centers from 9 countries, which contrib-
utes to generalizability of its results.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, it was not feasible to
blind participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors. It is
possible that processes of care might have been affected by
knowledge of treatment allocation. Conversely, blinding
would not affect classification of the primary outcome. Sec-
ond, it was not possible to classify enrolled patients into
ARDS subphenotypes, which may respond differently to
therapies such as PEEP.27,28 Determination of subphenotype
requires collecting plasma samples to perform analysis of
biomarkers; however, this was not conducted due to funding
restrictions. Third, it has been suggested that baseline
responsiveness to a test of PEEP elevation predicts percent-
age of potentially recruitable lung and the clinical response
to a strategy of lung recruitment associated with high
PEEP.29,30 However, since responsiveness to PEEP at baseline
was not assessed, it is not possible to analyze whether this
characteristic modifies treatment effect. Nevertheless, there
was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect in any
of the subgroups examined. Fourth, patients were enrolled in
the trial over 6 years. The care of patients with ARDS may
have changed during this period, which might have affected
results. However, an analysis of treatment effects on mortal-
ity according to order of enrollment provides no evidence
that effects changed over time. Fifth, a strategy involving
lung recruitment and PEEP titration (primary interventions)
is complex in the sense that not only the primary interven-
tions are part of it, but also cointerventions that need to be
aggregated. For example, administering neuromuscular
blockers and fluids in preparation for the recruitment man-
euver. As a consequence, it is not possible to ascribe ob-
served clinical effects exclusively to the direct effects of lung
recruitment maneuver and PEEP.
Conclusions
In patients with moderate to severe ARDS, a strategy with lung
recruitment and titrated PEEP compared with low PEEP in-
creased 28-day all-cause mortality. These findings do not sup-
port the routine use of lung recruitment maneuver and PEEP
titration in these patients.
