IMPORTANCE Patients in the United States waiting for kidney transplantation die in increasing
numbers owing to the severe kidney shortage, which might be alleviated by compensating
living kidney donors.
OBJECTIVE To determine the willingness of voting US citizens to become living kidney donors
and to ascertain the potential influence of compensation for donation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A professionally designed quantitative survey was
administered by an international polling firm in June 2014. Information was collected on
willingness to donate a kidney and the potential influence of compensation ($50 000);
survey data included respondent age, income, education level, sex, US region, race/ethnicity,
marital status, political affiliation, likelihood to vote, and employment status. The survey was
performed via a random-digit dialing process that selected respondents via both landlines
and mobile telephones to improve population representation. The survey included 1011
registered US voters likely to vote.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The degree to which the US voting public is willing to
donate a kidney and the perceptions of current voters toward paying living kidney donors.
RESULTS Of the 1011 respondents, 427 were male and 584 were female, with 43% of
participants between ages 45 and 64 years. With respondents grouped by willingness to
donate, we found that 689 (68%) would donate a kidney to anyone and 235 (23%) only to
certain persons; 87 (9%) would not donate. Most (59%) indicated that payment of $50 000
would make them even more likely to donate a kidney, 32% were unmoved by compensation,
and 9% were negatively influenced by payment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most US voters view living kidney donation positively, and
most would be motivated toward donor nephrectomy if offered a payment of $50 000.
Because most registered voters favor such payments, and because thousands of lives might
be saved should compensation increase the number of transplantable kidneys, laws and
regulations prohibiting donor compensation should be modified to allow pilot studies of
financial incentives for living kidney donors. Outcomes of such trials could then result in
evidence-based policies, which would incorporate fair and just compensation to those
persons willing to undergo donor nephrectomy.

T
housands of patients with end-stage renal disease in the
United States have had preventable deaths owing to the
shortage of transplantable kidneys. The Organ Procure-
ment and Transplantation Network database confirms that
from 2004 to 2013, 63 742 persons died or became too sick for
transplantation while awaiting a kidney.1 During that time,
166 667 kidneys were transplanted, 105 214 from deceased and
61 453 from living donors.1 Thus, for every 1000 US patients
who received a kidney, 382 eligible persons died of circum-
stances potentially correctable by kidney transplantation. In
2013, there were 7604 such potentially preventable events
compared with 5009 in 2004 (Figure 1A).
Currently, the US kidney transplantation waiting list ex-
ceeds 101 400 patients.1 The list grows each year, while the
number of kidneys transplanted stagnates or diminishes
(Figure 1B). There was an increase of 20% in deceased donor
kidney transplants from 2004 to 2013 and a 14% decrease in
living donor kidney transplants (Figure 1C). The graft sur-
vival rate from living donors is almost double that of de-
ceased donors.2 Although there are risks to living donation,
negativeincidencesremainlow.3,4Novelstrategies,suchasliv-
ing donor kidney exchanges and other efforts promoting liv-
ing kidney donation, have not met the ever-growing need.5,6
Nearly all state-level policies have had a negligible effect on
donation.7 Increasing the number of living persons undergo-
ing donor nephrectomy could expand the number of trans-
plantable kidneys, but donation is dependent on altruism be-
cause it is illegal under the National Organ Transplant Act to
pay any donor.8 Because altruism has failed, one way to in-
creasekidneytransplantationmaybetoprovidefinancialcom-
pensation to living donors.
One type of donor compensation is to reimburse all costs,
such as lost wages, travel expenses, and follow-up care. Such
payments are legal and not contentious, but many donors do
not qualify for assistance through existing programs.9-11 Thus,
donor financial hardship remains a significant barrier. An-
other type of compensation, which is controversial but poten-
tially more effective, is the provision of financial incentives be-
yond expenses. These may take the form of an in-kind reward
(eg, a contribution to the donor’
s retirement fund, an income
tax credit, or a tuition voucher) or even a direct cash pay-
ment. Persons favoring payment believe that living kidney do-
nationswouldincreaseandwaitlistdeathswoulddecreaseand
that remuneration could be ethical with respect to the
donor.12,13 Those against financial incentives disagree and as-
sert that even with a transparent and well-regulated compen-
sation program, potential donors would be subject to coer-
cion, undue influence, and body commodification.14
Additionally, it has been argued that payment would gener-
ate such a negative public response that living donation rates
might actually decrease.15,16
The issue of financial incentives in organ donation has
been deliberated for more than 2 decades.15-17 Most relevant
peer-reviewed reports and government policies are based on
opinion, anecdotes, moral constructs, individual testimony,
tradition, and personal beliefs. No evidence-based data gen-
erated from clinical trials of donor payment are available
because such trials are illegal under the National Organ

Key Points
Question How much do US voters support living kidney donation
and financial compensation for living kidney donors?
Findings Of 1011 randomly selected US voters, 68% would
donate a kidney to anyone, 23% would donate only to certain
persons, and 9% would not donate. Most (59%) indicated
payment of $50 000 would make them even more likely to
donate.
Meaning Most US voters view living kidney donation positively
and would be motivated to become a living donor by a payment
of $50 000, which implies public support to modify current
restrictive laws to permit studies of financial incentives for living
kidney donors.

Transplant Act. Therefore, the matter of payment in organ
donation is a national political issue that should be
addressed by US voters and legislators to develop evidence-
based policies. A combined working group consisting of
members of the American Society of Transplantation and
the American Society of Transplant Surgeons recently
argued that it was important to engage the public in discus-
sions about increasing organ donation and that policies con-
cerning financial incentives and the removal of disincentives
may best be defined by the citizenry.18 While debate over
the ethics, nature, and scope of donor compensation
matures,12,19 we sought to understand the current attitudes
of a statistically balanced sample representative of US voters
regarding whether living kidney donors should receive cash
payments.
Methods
A quantitative, nationwide telephone survey of 1011 regis-
tered US voters likely to vote was completed in June 2014. The
survey was engaged by the FAIR Foundation, a 501(c)(3) vol-
unteer organization interested in US health resources alloca-
tion, and designed and administered by Penn Schoen Ber-
land,aninternationalpollingfirm.Becausethispoliticalsurvey
was commissioned by a private 501(c)(3) corporation, and be-
cause the phone numbers are publically available and no iden-
tifying information was obtained, institutional review board
approval was not necessary.
A random-digit dialing process selected respondents via
both landlines and mobile telephones to optimize unbiased
population representation. From 16 851 Americans willing to
complete the survey, a final assemblage of 1011 persons was
selected to produce a study population representative of the
US voting public. Demographic information comprising age,
income, education level, sex, US geographic region, race/
ethnicity, marital status, political affiliation, likelihood to
vote, and employment status was collected. Survey respon-
dents were self-described as US citizens registered to vote
and likely to continue voting. All survey questions and
response choices are available at https://fileshare.ps-b.com/dl
/3yF2PPoHc8.
Answers to specific questions were graded on a 4-point
scale (eg, “Do you strongly agree, somewhat agree, some-
what disagree, or strongly disagree with the following state-
ment: I would be open to being a living kidney donor to any-
one.”). Respondent choices were compiled so that answers
of strongly agree and somewhat agree were reported in a
single category: agree. Answers of somewhat disagree or
strongly disagree were similarly aggregated. Some queries
included an opinion statement and a question about how
agreeable or disagreeable the respondent was to that state-
ment; answer choices for these questions were graded on
the same 4-point agreeable to disagreeable scale with an
additional “don’
t know” option.
The survey began by gathering demographic details. Next,
with no mention yet about paying donors, respondents were
asked how open they were to being a living kidney donor. As
part of the analysis, respondents were sorted into 3 baseline
groups corresponding to their willingness to donate without
regard to donor incentives. Group 1 (anyone) included those
positive to donating to anyone, including unknown persons;
group 2 (family/friends) included those positive to donating
with restrictions, eg, only to family or friends; and group 3 (no
one) included those who would not donate to anyone.
All 1011 respondents were assigned to 1 of these groups.
Next, to determine the effect of paying living kidney donors,
all 1011 respondents were asked how a tax-free payment of
$50 000 from the health care system would affect their will-
ingness to donate a kidney to anyone, to family/friends, or to
no one. This level of compensation was chosen because it is a
substantial amount and is less than the annual Medicare in-
center hemodialysis per-patient cost.20 To assess how voters
mightregardpaymentforotherhumanbiologicassets,thesur-
vey explored perceptions of payment for marrow, blood, ova,
and sperm in relation to living kidney donation.
During the survey, it became apparent that, regardless of
willingness to donate, some respondents perceived payment
to themselves as different from the concept of paying living
donors as a societal norm. To ascertain opinions about the so-
cial justification for paying donors, 635 of the 1011 respon-
dents were additionally queried about supporting or not sup-
porting compensation in principle. This cohort of 635 was
further analyzed with respect to age and income level to de-
termine how these factors might clarify who would favor or
disfavor paying living kidney donors.
Statistical analysis used contingency tables built from sur-
vey questions, demographic information, and changes to re-
spondent likelihood to donate under different conditions. Sta-
tistical significance was calculated (95% CI) for groups of
respondents in related subgroups. Incomplete or missing an-
swers prompted withdrawal from analysis only for that par-
ticular question; complete answers from that respondent were
retained.Significancetestingdetailsacrossallgroupsareavail-

Baseline Willingness to Donate Without Regard
to Compensation
Of the 1011 respondents, 689 (68%) indicated that they were
open to donating a kidney to anyone (group 1); 235 (23%) said
that they were open to donating with restrictions (family/
friends; group 2); and 87 (9%) stated that they would not do-
nate a kidney to anyone (group 3) (Table 1; Figure 2A). For all
1011 respondents, considering sex, age, and employment sta-
tus, there was little variance about respondents’ self-
designation regarding their own donor status. A range of 60%
to 76% of respondents considered themselves donors to any-
one,while21%to29%indicatedthattheywoulddonatetofam-

Payment for Living Donor Nephrectomy:
Personal Decision Effects
All 1011 participants were evaluated to determine whether do-
nor compensation would move them toward a positive or a
negative decision to donate a kidney (Table 2; Figure 2B). For
the 689 group 1 respondents, 428 (62%) indicated that pay-
ment of $50 000 would make them even more likely to do-
nate. For the 235 group 2 respondents, 141 (60%) were more
likely to consider undergoing nephrectomy. For the 87 group
3 respondents, 23 (26%) were more willing to donate if com-
pensated. Conversely, movement away from donating when
offered $50 000 occurred in 54 (8%), 22 (9%), and 16 (18%) re-
spondentsingroups1,2,and3,respectively(allP < .05).Atotal
of 323 respondents (32%) did not move toward or away from
their original self-designation. Thus, payment motivated more
USvoterstopositivelyconsiderdonornephrectomyratherthan
to reject the notion of donating a kidney.
US Citizens’ Support for Living Donor Compensation
For the 635 US voters asked about societal norms of paying liv-
ing donors, 432 (68%) were in group 1, 149 (23%) were in group
2, and 54 (9%) were in group 3, reflecting the exact propor-
tions of the entire 1011 respondents (Table 3). Of this cohort,
387(61%)wereopentosupportingdonorpayments.Whenana-
lyzedcomparedwithbaselinewillingnesstodonate,285of432
persons (66%) in group 1 favored compensating donors, a two-
thirds majority of already-willing donors. This degree of sup-
port was significantly greater (P < .05) than the 79 of 149 ma-
jority(53%)ingroup2andthe23of54(43%)ingroup3favoring
a societal policy of living donor compensation.
Results by respondent age revealed that 53 of 68 voters
(78%) aged 18 to 29 years favored payment, a significantly
higher percentage than all other age groups (P < .05). How-
ever, 68 of 108 respondents (63%) aged 30 to 44 years, as well
as 266 of 459 respondents (58%) 45 years and older, favored
paying living kidney donors. Thus, a majority (58% to 78%)
acrossallagesofUSvotersfavoredtheconceptinprinciplethat
persons undergoing donor nephrectomy should be paid.
Data were available for 521 of 635 respondents (82%) will-
ing to disclose their annual household income while stating

less than $50 000, 175 of 257 (68%) favored compensating do-
nors, a proportion significantly higher than other income lev-
els (P < .05). Of those earning between $50 000 and $100 000,
111 of 191 (58%) favored compensation, while 41 of 73 (56%)
earning more than $100 000 favored payment. At no income

come levels, 327 of 521 respondents (63%) favored paying liv-
ing kidney donors.
Compensation for Kidneys vs Other Living Donor Tissues
Regarding compensation for human kidneys, marrow, blood,
ova, and sperm, more US voters favored payment for kidney
andmarrowdonorsthancompensationforblood,ova,orsperm
donors. Among all 1011 respondents, 56% and 58% agreed that
compensation should be allowed for kidney and marrow, re-
spectively. When asked about payment for blood, ova, and
sperm, approval was significantly lower at 48%, 41%, and 35%,
respectively (all P < .05).
Discussion
Every year, increasing numbers of US patients awaiting kid-
ney transplantation die or become so ill that they are no lon-
ger considered transplantation candidates. The major reason
for this failure of patient care is the shortage of kidneys for
transplantation.Anincreaseinlivingkidneydonorscouldsolve
this problem, yet financial burdens often remain a barrier to
living kidney donation.21 The idea that living donors should
notbefinanciallyencumberedhasbeenaffirmedbytheAmeri-
can Society of Transplantation and the American Society of
Transplant Surgeons, professional societies that are now con-
sidering how donor remuneration might relieve the kidney
shortage in America.13,18,22
While many transplantation professionals still oppose di-
rect payments in organ donation, others affirm that financial
incentives should be debated in public. The attitudes of pro-
fessionals opposing payment may lag behind those of the
American populace, which often accepts policy changes be-
forepoliticians,regulators,andjudgesaddressandmodifylaws
and regulations. This “population-out-in-front” phenom-
enon has been evident in issues such as same-sex marriage,
marijuana use, and end-of-life imperatives. A poignant ex-
ample of the out-in-front phenomenon is that in 1947, fewer
than 40% of Americans were likely to support physician-
assistedeuthanasia,whileacceptanceisashighas70%today.23
Publicandprofessionalattitudesaboutpayingdonorshave
varied over time. Hoeyer et al24 reviewed 23 articles pub-
lished from 2002 to 2012 regarding public opinion of finan-
cial incentives in both living and deceased donation. They
found broad differences for and against financial incentives,
with a low overall acceptance for paying living donors. How-
ever, they noted a considerable preference for nonmonetary
rewards, including paid lifetime donor health care, preferen-
tial treatment should a living donor need transplantation, and
deferment of any donation costs. In 2012, Canadian citizens,
health care professionals, and those affected by kidney dis-
ease were surveyed about financial incentives to increase liv-
ing kidney donation.25 Although only 14% of professionals
and 27% of kidney patients supported paying donors, nearly
half (45%) of the general public favored compensation. The
study concluded that the Canadian public saw payment as
acceptable and that further research should determine what
role financial incentives might play. In a Netherlands study,
van Buren et al26 surveyed 250 living kidney donors, argu-
ably the population with the most investment in the issue.
Respondents were asked in retrospect—ie, after donation was
completed—whether they would have wanted a financial re-
ward and whether they favored a regulated system of pay-
ment to stimulate kidney donation. While most (78%) did not
desire a reward for themselves, noting that they donated out
of love for the recipient, 60% favored payment to anony-
mous donors and 46% favored a payment system for future
living kidney donors.
Concerns for undue inducement and coercion through fi-
nancial incentives, particularly for payments beyond costs of
the donor, remain19 despite the work of Halpern et al27 in 2010
that showed that (1) although higher payments increased the
probabilities of donating, they did so evenly across different
income strata and (2) poorer persons were more willing to do-
nate independent of payment. Moreover, in agreement with

our results, payment did not appear to adversely affect altru-
istic motivations to donate. Gordon et al28 reported that di-
rect payment of money was the most preferred form of com-
pensationin61%ofrespondentsandthatcompensationwould
increase the likelihood to donate in 29% of respondents but
would not change the view of 70% of persons queried. Offer-
ing $5000 or $10 000 to give a kidney to family and friends or
strangers,respectively,wereamountsatwhichparticipantsbe-
gan to consider donation more positively. These authors fur-
ther found that undue inducement payment levels for ne-
phrectomy were $50 000 and $100 000 for family and friends
and strangers, respectively, thus concluding that lower
amounts of payment may motivate the public in an accept-
able fashion. In contrast, we have found that most US voters
who would be willing to consider donor nephrectomy would
be more willing to do so when offered a cash payment of
$50 000, and even some initially not in favor of donation in-
dicated that they would be swayed. Our findings refute the as-
sertion that the US public, and particularly the American voter,
holds payment for living kidney donation in disdain. Instead,
our data suggest that a substantial proportion of US voters
would consider living donation, would be more inclined to do-
nate if paid a sufficient amount, and would favor compensat-
ing donors as a societal norm.
An overriding and virtually ubiquitous tenet of modern
medicine is that decisions related to care must be based on evi-
dence.TheevidenceregardingthecircumstancesintheUnited
States related to sufficient organs for transplantation is clear:
the current system to obtain organs, particularly kidneys, for
transplantation is inadequate. Survey data suggest that many
citizens would consider donating a kidney if there were no fi-
nancial burden and adequate compensation. However, ac-
tual behaviors may not fully comport with survey responses.
Therefore, the way to determine whether compensating liv-
ing kidney donors would substantially increase the number of
kidneys for transplantation and where exactly the line is be-
tween fairness and undue inducement or coercion is to de-
sign and carry out clinical trials, through which data could be
obtained on the actual behaviors of potential donors and
on the attitudes and opinions of actual donors who receive
compensation.
Conclusions
Most US voters support living kidney donation, both in terms
of donation and compensation. Persons self-described as po-
tential donors appear even more inclined to donate if offered
payment. Thus, the inclination toward donation appears
strengthened,notweakened,bypayment.MoreAmericansbe-
lievethatlivingkidneyandmarrowdonors,whocurrentlymay
not be paid by law, are more deserving of compensation than
donors of ova, sperm, and blood, who currently can be paid.
Because too many US patients are dying owing to the inad-
equate kidney supply, and because paying living kidney do-
nors could increase the number of kidneys, we conclude that
this option must be seriously considered. Amending existing
federal law so that pilot studies concerning donor compensa-
tion can go forward is a reasonable start, and our findings show
thatitshouldbepoliticallyfeasible.Resultsofsuchclinicaltrials
should be the basis of regulatory policy. If pilot studies sup-
port paying living kidney donors, perhaps one day there might
be a long waiting list of persons wanting to donate rather than
a list of Americans waiting for kidneys that never come.

The Ethical Dilemma of Compensating Living Kidney Donors
Alignment Between Science, Legislation, and Ethical Perception
in Society?

Since 1954, when the first kidney transplantation was per-
formed, more than half a million living donor kidney trans-
plants have been completed.1 A study2 on 3698 living kidney
donors showed that the post-
operativemortalityrateofdo-
nation is 0.03% and that the
risk of long-term end-stage
renal disease is comparable with the risk of the matched gen-
eral US population. The authors concluded that the life expec-
tancy and quality of life of living donors is comparable with
the general population.
Living kidney donation undoubtedly has beneficial ef-
fects for patients receiving chronic dialysis, including shorter
waiting time for transplantation, lower risk of graft rejection,
and improved allograft survival compared with cadaveric
donation.1,3,4 However, there is a gap between the need for kid-
ney transplantation and the availability of grafts. The limited
availabilityofgraftshasparticularlynegativeeffectsonyounger
patients with kidney failure owing to the pathology of an un-
derlying disease, the quality of the graft, and longer waiting
lists for organs from deceased donors.
Living kidney donation has recently been shown to affect
the economic situation of the donor5; would financial com-
