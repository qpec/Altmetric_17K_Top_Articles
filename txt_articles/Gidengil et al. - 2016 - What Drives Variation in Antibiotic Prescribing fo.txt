BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections are the most
common symptomatic reason for seeking care among
patients in the US, and account for the majority of all
antibiotic prescribing, yet a large fraction of antibiotic
prescriptions are inappropriate.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the underlying factors
driving variation in antibiotic prescribing across clini-
cians and settings.
DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS: Using electronic health data
for adult ambulatory visits for acute respiratory infections
to a retail clinic chain and primary care practices from an
integrated healthcare system, we identified a random
sample of clinicians for survey.
MAIN MEASURES: We evaluated independent predictors
of overall prescribing and imperfect antibiotic prescribing,
controlling for clinician and site of care. We defined im-
perfect antibiotic prescribing as prescribing for non-
antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses, failure to prescribe for
an antibiotic-appropriate diagnosis, or prescribing a non-
guideline-concordant antibiotic.
KEY RESULTS: Response rates were 34 % for retail clin-
ics and 24 % for physicians’ offices (N = 187). Clinicians in
physicians’ offices prescribed antibiotics less often than
those in retail clinics (53 % versus 67 %; p < 0.01), but had
a higher imperfect antibiotic prescribing rate (65 % versus
31 %; p < 0.01). Feeling rushed was associated with higher
antibiotic prescribing (OR 1.34; 95 % CI 1.03, 1.75). An-
tibiotic prescribing was also associated with clinician dis-
agreement that antibiotics are overused (OR 1.60, 95 %
CI, 1.16, 2.20). Imperfect antibiotic prescribing was asso-
ciated with receiving antibiotic prescribing feedback (OR
1.35, 95 % CI 1.04, 1.75) and disagreement that patient
demand was a problem (OR 1.66, 95 % CI 1.00, 2.73).
Imperfect antibiotic prescribing was less common with
clinicians who perceived that they prescribed antibiotics
less often than their peers (OR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.46, 0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: Poor-quality antibiotic prescribing was
associated with feeling rushed, believing less strongly that
antibiotics were overused, and believing that patient de-
mand was not an issue, factors that can be assessed and
addressed in future interventions.

BACKGROUND
Acute respiratory infections—including the common cold,
otitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and pneumo-
nia—are the most common symptomatic reason for seeking
care among patients in the US, and account for the majority of
all antibiotic prescriptions.1 A large fraction of antibiotic pre-
scriptions are inappropriate, either because the antibiotic is
written for a viral condition or because a broad-spectrum
antibiotic is chosen in clinical situations where a narrow-
spectrum antibiotic would be suitable.1,2
There has been some progress. Numerous interventions
have been tried over the last several decades ranging from
physician education to the CDC’s GET SMART patient edu-
cation campaign.3–5 Per capita antibiotic use for acute respira-
tory infections has fallen by 25 %.1 While this success is
laudable, several studies have found that improvements in
antibiotic prescribing rates have stalled.6,7 Furthermore, the
inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has in-
creased.1 We are in need of new interventions.
Variation in antibiotic prescribing between individual clini-
cians and clinical settings might help identify targets for new
interventions. Outside of primary care physician (PCPs) offi-
ces, many patients are receiving acute respiratory infection
care in settings such as retail clinics. Retail clinics, located in
drug stores and grocery stores and typically staffed by nurse
practitioners (NPs), are an innovative delivery model that
provides walk-in care for acute respiratory infections.8,9 Cur-
rently there are ∼5.4 million visits to the 1200 retail clinics in
the US each year, and almost two thirds of these visits are for
acute respiratory infections.8 Prior work has demonstrated that
retail clinic clinicians are more likely to provide guideline-
concordant care.10,11

 The goal of this study was to understand the underlying
factors driving the variation in antibiotic prescribing across
clinicians and settings, with the hope that these factors could
be the basis of future interventions. We measured the rates of
antibiotic prescribing and Bimperfect^ antibiotic prescribing
among a sample of clinicians at physicians’ offices and pro-
viders in retail clinics. Then, using survey responses from
those same clinicians, we looked for associations between
antibiotic use and survey-reported measures of knowledge,
attitudes, and behavior.
METHODS
Survey Development
Based on Ranji’s work on antibiotic prescribing5 and Cab-
ana’s framework for categorizing barriers to compliance
with guidelines,12 we created a conceptual framework of
factors and barriers that might influence antibiotic prescrib-
ing for acute respiratory infections. These factors can affect
clinicians’ behavior directly or can affect knowledge and
attitudes that, in turn, affect behavior. Barriers include a
lack of clinician awareness of a guideline, lack of outcome
expectancy (e.g. guideline-based care will not work), self-
efficacy regarding communication ability, and the percep-
tion that guideline-based care goes against patient wishes.
Other factors include clinicians’ perceptions of their antibi-
otic prescribing compared to their peers, clinical workload,
patient continuity (whether they see their own clinician),
and feedback on performance.
We developed the survey using the above framework and
refined the survey through cognitive testing with four clini-
cians and pilot testing with 31 clinicians in the spring of 2013.
Please see the Online Electronic Materials for the full survey
wording.
Study Population and Data Collection
We sampled clinicians in two settings: (1) PCPs’ offices in the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center—a large integrated
health system with an academic affiliation; and (2) a national
retail clinic chain with clinics in 19 states in the Northeast,
West, South, and Midwest. We focused on these two settings
because prior work has documented large differences in pat-
terns of antibiotic prescribing.13 We strove to understand what
drives that variation. Clinicians in the physicians’ offices were
all physicians with an MD (doctor of medicine degree) or a
DO (doctor of osteopathic medicine degree). Clinicians in the
retail clinics were almost all NPs, with a small number of
physician assistants. Both had an electronic health record
(EHR) that allowed us to directly measure antibiotic
prescribing.
We obtained electronic health record data for all adult
ambulatory visits for acute respiratory infections in 2012.
Based on prior work,14 we defined acute respiratory infection
diagnoses using the following ICD-9 codes: streptococcal
pharyngitis (034.x), otitis media (381.x, 382.x), sinusitis
(461.x), pneumonia (481.x, 482.x, 483.x, 485.x, 486.x), non-
specific upper respiratory infection (URI; 460.x, 465.x), non-
streptococcal pharyngitis (462.x), and bronchitis (466.x,
490.x, 491.21). The physicians’ offices had 39,961 visits for
acute respiratory infections in 2012, while the retail clinics had
765,667 visits. The smaller number at physicians’ offices is
presumed to be due to our having surveyed within only one
health system. We then excluded all visits where the patient
had a comorbidity or condition requiring an antibiotic accord-
ing to the ICD-9 code, based on prior literature (see Online
Materials Table 1).13 We otherwise included all visits for acute
respiratory infections, including those that may have been
follow-up visits. Given our use of EMR data, we could not
identify visits outside the health system, and therefore could
not reliably identify follow-up visits.
Survey Deployment
We randomly sampled clinicians in each of the two settings
from among those who had at least 25 visits for acute respira-
tory infections during 2012. The self-administered online sur-
vey was emailed to clinicians starting in January 2013 (physi-
cians’ offices) and September 2013 (retail clinics). The clini-
cians were offered a $50 gift card as an incentive for partici-
pation. The initial email invitation was followed by two email
reminders sent at 5–7-day intervals to those who had not
responded. The study protocol was approved by the Human
Subjects Protection Committees at the University of Pitts-
burgh and Harvard Medical School.
Defining Two Measures of Antibiotic Prescribing
We used EHR data to create two measures to characterize
antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections for each
clinician. The first was overall antibiotic prescribing, which
was the rate of prescribing of any antibiotic across all acute
respiratory infection visits. We then created a new quality
measure, called Bimperfect antibiotic prescribing.^ Overall
acute respiratory infection antibiotic prescribing is crude, in
that it does not account for acute respiratory infection con-
ditions where antibiotics may be indicated. Thus we defined
the Bimperfect^ antibiotic prescribing rate as prescribing an
antibiotic for a non-antibiotic-appropriate diagnosis (defined
as URI, bronchitis, non-streptococcal pharyngitis),13,14 failure
to prescribe an antibiotic for an antibiotic-appropriate diagno-
sis (sinusitis, pneumonia, streptococcal pharyngitis, otitis me-
dia),13,14 or choosing a non-guideline-concordant antibiotic
for an antibiotic-appropriate diagnosis. We defined non-
guideline-concordant antibiotics as an antibiotic other than
amoxicillin-clavulanate or amoxicillin for sinusitis,15–17 a
macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) or
doxycycline for pneumonia,18 amoxicillin or penicillin for
streptococcal pharyngitis,19,20 and amoxicillin for otitis me-
dia.21 Other antibiotics that were prescribed by clinicians

 across all visits—none of which would be considered guide-
line-concordant—included fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin,
ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and ofloxacin), trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), first-generation cephalosporins
(cefadroxil, cephalexin), second-generation cephalosporins
(cefaclor, cefprozil, cefuroxime), third-generation cephalo-
sporins (cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone), and
others (clindamycin, metronidazole, minocycline, tetracy-
cline, nitrofurantoin).
Analysis
We constructed a multivariate model at the visit level, where
the primary outcome was whether an antibiotic was prescribed
at the visit. A secondary model was constructed identically to
the first but with imperfect antibiotic prescribing as the out-
come. For each model, we selected both clinician-level and
visit-level covariates based on theoretical grounds. Clinician-
level variables included demographic characteristics such as
gender, number of years in practice, and professional degree/
background (all via self-report). We also asked clinicians
about the type of insurance held by their patients across all
of their patients. Other clinician-level covariates included the
factors from our conceptual framework collected via the sur-
vey, which included familiarity with guidelines; ability to
effectively communicate; agreement that antibiotics are over-
used in primary care; agreement that patient demand for anti-
biotics is a problem; prescribing rate compared to peers;
receiving feedback on prescribing; and how often the clinician
felt rushed when seeing patients. From the EHR, we obtained
visit-level covariates including the patient’s gender as well as
the patient’s age in years at the time of the visit. Both models
were run as logistic regressions with standard errors adjusted
for clustering at the clinician level.
RESULTS
Among a total of 613 clinicians, 187 completed the email
survey, resulting in an overall response rate of 30 %. The
response rates were similar between clinicians at retail clinics
(34 %) and at physicians’ offices (27 %; p=0.08). We did not
have data to compare respondents and non-respondents, ex-
cept on their prescribing rates. The overall prescribing rate of
61 % for respondents was similar to that of non-respondents,
at 64 % (p=0.07). Respondents had a significantly lower
imperfect antibiotic prescribing rate than non-respondents,
though the absolute magnitude of difference was not large
(46 % versus 52 %, p=0.003)
Of our respondents, 29 % reported working more than
40 hours per week (Table 1). The average number of years
in practice after having completed training was 13.2. Clini-
cians at retail clinics were more likely to be women, have less
time in practice, and work part-time. Patients at both retail
clinics and physicians’ offices were more likely to be women

 (66 %; Table 1). Patients at physicians’ offices tended to be
older than those at retail clinics.
Variation in Antibiotic Prescribing
There were large variations in overall antibiotic prescribing
and imperfect antibiotic prescribing rates among clinicians and
between sites (Fig. 1). Overall, compared to the physicians in
the physicians’ offices, clinicians in retail clinics had a higher
antibiotic prescribing rate (67 % versus 53 %, p<0.01), but a
lower imperfect antibiotic prescribing rate (31 % versus 65 %,
p<0.001).
Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors
Most clinicians (82 %) strongly agreed that antibiotics were
overused in primary care, with no clinicians in disagreement
with that statement (Table 2; results by setting can be found in
Online Materials Table 2). The majority of clinicians also
strongly agreed that patient demand was a problem in their
practice (59 %). About a third of clinicians reported feeling
rushed almost always or most of the time. Forty-three percent
of respondents believed that they prescribed antibiotics at
about the same rate as their peers, and 50 % reported prescrib-
ing antibiotics less often than their peers.

 Factors Associated with Overall Antibiotic
Prescribing and Imperfect Antibiotic
Prescribing for Acute Respiratory Infections
Clinicians who reported feeling rushed almost always or most
of the time were more likely to prescribe antibiotics (OR 1.34,
95 % CI 1.03, 1.75; Table 3). Clinicians who felt less strongly
that antibiotics were overused had a higher overall antibiotic
prescribing rate (OR 1.61, 95 % 1.18, 2.20). Clinicians who
did not agree that patient demand was a problem in their
practice were more likely to have imperfect antibiotic prescrib-
ing (OR 1.66, 95 % CI 1.00, 2.73). Clinicians who reported
that they prescribed less often than their peers had a lower
antibiotic prescribing rate (OR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.47, 0.86).
Seemingly paradoxically, imperfect antibiotic prescribing
was more likely among clinicians who reported receiving
feedback (OR 1.35, 95 % CI 1.04, 1.75].
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive
survey thus far of clinician antibiotic prescribing behavior
related to acute respiratory infections. Consistent with prior
work,13 we found notable variation among clinicians, even
within single health systems, in antibiotic prescribing rates.
Our goals were to exploit these differences to learn what might
be driving variation in care. We found that the following
factors were associated with higher rates of inappropriate
prescribing: feeling rushed, less likely to perceive patient
demand as a problem, clinician perception of having a higher
prescribing rate than peers, and paradoxically, receiving more
feedback on antibiotic prescribing. Equally notable is that
knowledge of guidelines and communication ability were
not predictive of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.
Understanding what links the factors we identified in our
model to actual prescribing behaviors may inform future inter-
ventions. Clinicians who are rushed may be more likely to
prescribe antibiotics because they believe it takes more time to
convince a patient that antibiotics are not necessary. Further-
more, the perception that antibiotic overuse is not a problem
makes it easier to take the path of least resistance, which is to
prescribe antibiotics. These same clinicians may then not per-
ceive patient demand as a problem for their practice, because
they more frequently prescribe antibiotics. As a result, they
receive less pushback from patients and fewer conflicting
demands, and thus do not perceive patient demand as a problem.
Based on these findings, future interventions could try to
reduce the perceived workload associated with not prescribing
antibiotics and/or increase the perceived workload with prescrib-
ing antibiotics. One set of interventions could focus on reducing
the likelihood that patients will ask for antibiotics. This could be
accomplished through low-cost interventions such a notification
informing patients that for the majority of acute respiratory
infections, the clinician does not prescribe antibiotics, a poster
in the waiting room stating that the practice is committed to
prescribing antibiotics only when appropriate,22 or sending
patients literature on antibiotic overuse prior to the visit or
providing it in the waiting room.23 Another set of interventions

 could focus on perceptions of feeling rushed. One example might
be to give clinicians brief Btalking points^ about antibiotics. A
third set of interventions could make it harder for clinicians to
take the path of least resistance and prescribe antibiotics inappro-
priately. For example, being forced to provide justification in the
electronic record for decisions around giving antibiotics might
make prescribing antibiotics a less desirable option for the clini-
cian who feels rushed. This would go beyond simple decision
support interventions4,24,25—which have resulted in only modest
reductions in antibiotic prescribing rates—to a more active review
when clinicians prescribe antibiotics inappropriately.
Some of the factors that we hypothesized would be related to
antibiotic prescribing either were not significant, or their effect
was the opposite of what we expected. For example, receiving
feedback on antibiotic prescribing, rather than improving care for
acute respiratory infections, was associated with higher odds of
imperfect antibiotic prescribing. Past work in the area of audit
and feedback to clinicians has shown mixed effects, with some
interventions demonstrating significant improvements in pre-
scribing rates26 and others with more mixed results.14,27,28 Al-
though we did not collect the data needed to further explore the
apparently paradoxical relationship observed in this study, we
wonder whether clinicians who were performing poorly in care
for acute respiratory infections were also those who received
feedback on their prescribing rates. In such instances, temporality
cannot be assessed. Self-reported familiarity with guidelines was
not associated with either prescribing outcome. This is consistent
with prior work, in which self-reported familiarity was not
associated with consistent guideline adherence or higher quality
of care.29 And finally, self-reported communication effectiveness
was not associated with quality of antibiotic prescribing. Given
that very few clinicians rated themselves as poor communicators,
our questions may not have been able to capture the spectrum of
responses in sufficiently granular detail.
Our study had a number of limitations. We had only a fair
response rate at 30 %. Not unexpectedly, we did observe
differences between responders and non-responders, with res-
ponders having significantly lower rates of imperfect antibiot-
ic prescribing. This is not entirely surprising, as those who are
more aware and supportive of appropriate antibiotic prescrib-
ing may be more responsive to survey requests. Our results
may thus be biased and may overestimate the quality of
antibiotic prescribing in these settings. While we compared
two very different settings, due to feasibility constraints, we
looked at only one health system in a single state and one
chain of retail clinics (though with representation across 19
states), which limits the generalizability of our findings in light
of known regional differences in prescribing patterns.30 In
addition, we included all visits for ARIs, and thus may have
inadvertently included some follow-up visits. We were unable
to reliably identify follow-up visits at retail clinics, given that
the vast majority of such visits are to a different site. However,
in physicians’ offices, follow-up visits within 21 days for the
same condition occurred only 4.5 % of the time, and thus this
inclusion is unlikely to have significantly affected our results.
We did not account for antibiotic allergies in this study, both
because such information was not available and because aller-
gies are generally poorly recorded, even with the use of an
EMR.31 In theory, sicker patients who might be more likely to
have allergies may also be more likely to go to a physician’s
office, which would bias our results towards penalizing physi-
cians for broader antibiotic prescribing. However, we did
exclude patients based on a number of comorbidities and other
conditions, which may partially mitigate the issue of allergies.
An additional limitation is that our study was not designed to
assess the differences between retail clinics and physicians’
offices. However, we did observe a large discrepancy in the
prescribing rates at the two settings, both for overall and imper-
fect antibiotic prescribing. Our prescribing rates were based on
ICD-9 codes, as we did not have access to laboratory or radiol-
ogy data. One possibility is that clinicians at retail clinics use a
smaller set of codes, and selectively choose ICD-9 codes that
align with the decision to prescribe antibiotics. Unfortunately,
we could not determine whether coding and true practice were
similarly matched in the two settings in this study, but this
would be an important area for future exploration.
In conclusion, we created a new measure of the quality of
antibiotic prescribing, which is a resource that can be used, tested,
and validated in future studies. In using this measure, we found
that, independent of clinical discipline and site of care, poor-
quality antibiotic prescribing was associated with feeling rushed,
believing less strongly that antibiotics were overused, and believ-
ing that patient demand was not an issue. These factors should be
considered and addressed in future interventions.
