Neurofilament light chain level is a weak
risk factor for the development of MS
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine the prognostic value of selected biomarkers in clinically isolated syn-
dromes (CIS) for conversion to multiple sclerosis (MS) and disability accrual.
Methods: Data were acquired from 2 CIS cohorts. The screening phase evaluated patients devel-
oping clinically definite MS (CIS-CDMS) and patients who remained as CIS during a 2-year mini-
mum follow-up (CIS-CIS). We determined levels of neurofascin, semaphorin 3A, fetuin A, glial
fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light (NfL) and heavy chains in CSF (estimated mean
[95% confidence interval; CI]). We evaluated associations between biomarker levels, conversion,
disability, and magnetic resonance parameters. In the replication phase, we determined NfL levels
(n 5 155) using a 900 ng/L cutoff. Primary endpoints in uni- and multivariate analyses were
CDMS and 2010 McDonald MS.
Results: The only biomarker showing significant differences in the screening was NfL (CIS-CDMS
1,553.1 [1,208.7–1,897.5] ng/L and CIS-CIS 499.0 [168.8–829.2] ng/L, p , 0.0001). The
strongest associations were with brain parenchymal fraction change (rs 5 20.892) and percent-
age brain volume change (rs 5 20.842) at 5 years. NfL did not correlate with disability. In the
replication phase, more NfL-positive patients, according to the cutoff, evolved to MS. Every
100-ng/L increase in NfL predicted CDMS (hazard ratio [HR] 5 1.009, 95% CI 1.005–1.014)
and McDonald MS (HR 5 1.009, 95% CI 1.005–1.013), remaining significant for CDMS in the
multivariate analysis (adjusted HR 5 1.005, 95% CI 1.000–1.011). This risk was lower than the
presence of oligoclonal bands or T2 lesions.
Conclusions: NfL is a weak independent risk factor for MS. Its role as an axonal damage biomarker
may be more relevant as suggested by its association with medium-term brain volume changes.

 of MS is still necessary. Although many have
been identified, few are currently useful in the
clinical setting.5 Consequently, we aimed to
determine the prognostic value of selected
biomarkers for conversion to MS and disabil-
ity accrual, and to assess their associations with
MRI inflammatory activity and neurodegener-
ative parameters.
METHODS Patients. We acquired longitudinal data from
CIS cohorts at the Multiple Sclerosis Center in Vall d’Hebron
Hospital, Barcelona,6 and the Neurology Department of Ramón
y Cajal Hospital, Madrid. Inclusion criteria were age younger
than 50 years and baseline clinical evaluation within the first
3 months of disease onset. We recorded baseline demographic
and clinical characteristics and conducted follow-up visits every 3
to 6 months, assessing for relapses, clinical worsening, and
excluding patients in whom we reached alternative diagnoses. A
second attack established the diagnosis of clinically definite MS
(CDMS).7 Definitions of disability accrual were a sustained
increase in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.0
point over 1 year or confirmed EDSS score $3.0.
Biological samples. We collected venous blood and CSF
within 3 months of disease onset for OCB determination in
the 2 hospitals. Remnant samples were aliquoted and stored at
2808C until further use.
MRI acquisition and analysis. At Vall d’Hebron Hospital,
brain MRI acquisition on 1.5- or 3.0-tesla superconductive
magnets included the following sequences, obtained with
a contiguous 3- to 5-mm slice thickness: transverse proton
density and T2-weighted conventional or fast spin-echo,
transverse and sagittal T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery,
and unenhanced and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-
echo. We included routine baseline spinal cord MRIs in
November 2007. Baseline scans were done within 5 months of
disease onset and follow-up MRIs at 1 year and every 5 years
thereafter.6 The Ramón y Cajal cohort followed a similar
acquisition protocol, performing baseline and follow-up MRIs
within 3 months after the CIS and at 1 year, including spinal
cord MRI in case of myelitis.
Neuroradiologists scored T2 lesion number and location, and
gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing and new T2 lesion number. T2
lesion volume was calculated using the semiautomated Jim med-
ical image display package (Xinapse Systems, Ltd., Colchester,
UK). Brain volume parameters were obtained using the Structural
Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy (SIENA)
software, part of FSL (FMRIB Software Library).8 Single-time-
point analysis to obtain brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) esti-
mates was performed with SIENAx. Two-time-point analysis was
performed with SIENA, estimating the percentage brain volume
change (PBVC) between 2 input images of the same subject at
different time points.
Biological markers. We selected fetuin A (FA),9 semaphorin
3A (sema3A),10,11 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),12–15 neu-
rofilament heavy (NfH) and light (NfL) chains,13–20 and neuro-
fascin21,22 after a PubMed search in 2008, which we updated
regularly throughout the study duration, including the terms
“biological markers” or “biomarkers” and “multiple sclerosis” or
“clinically isolated syndromes.”
Except for NfH, we determined biomarker levels using com-
mercial sandwich ELISA kits according to the manufacturers’
recommendations (FA: BioVendor, Brno, Czech Republic;
NfL: UmanDiagnostics AB, Umeå, Sweden; GFAP: Abnova,
Taipei City, Taiwan; neurofascin: USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan,
China; and sema3A: USCN Life Science Inc.). We optimized the
assays using varying sample dilutions measured in duplicates. NfH
levels were determined using an electrochemiluminescence-based
solid-phase sandwich immunoassay17 at the University Hospital Basel,
Switzerland, selected among different assays for its higher sensitiv-
ity.18,23,24 All samples were tested blinded to clinical data and outcome
measures. Whenever possible according to availability, we tested sam-
ples from the same patients using a different, unthawed aliquot.
Experimental design. Screening phase. We selected 2 opposite
groups with a 2-year minimum follow-up from the Vall d’Hebron
cohort: CIS-CDMS (n 5 from 33 to 38), including patients with 3
to 4 Barkhof-Tintore criteria on baseline MRI and presence of
OCBs who converted to CDMS; and CIS-CIS (n 5 from 33 to 39),
comprising patients with 0 Barkhof-Tintore criteria and absence of
OCBs who remained as CIS (figure e-1A at Neurology.org).
Replication phase. Only NfL levels showed significant differ-
ences in the screening and were thus evaluated in a replication
phase. We selected consecutive patients with available CSF sam-
ples from the Vall d’Hebron and Ramón y Cajal cohorts (n 5
155). Patients from Vall d’Hebron were selected from a different
time range (2009–2011) than the NfL screening phase because of
sample availability. NfL determination was performed in each
hospital separately using the above-mentioned assay (figure e-1B).
Statistical analysis. We performed parametric and nonpara-
metric descriptive statistics depending on the normality of the dis-
tributions of the continuous variables.
Screening phase. For each biomarker, we calculated sample
size for 80% power at the 0.05 level of significance based on pre-
vious data. We used generalized linear models to compare CIS
groups in terms of conversion to CDMS and assess biomarker levels
and disability accrual, with the Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons when applicable. Data are reported as the estimated
mean (95% confidence interval [CI]). Potential covariates were
age, sex, CIS topography, time from CIS to lumbar puncture, sam-
ple storage time, and disease-modifying treatment (DMT) before
CDMS. We calculated Spearman correlations for MRI inflamma-
tory activity parameters at baseline, 1, and 5 years (number of T2,
Gd-enhancing, and new T2 lesions; T2 lesion volume), and partial
correlations for neurodegenerative parameters at 1 and 5 years of
follow-up (BPF change [BPFD] adjusted for age and baseline Gd-
enhancing lesions, and PBVC). We calculated BPFD by subtracting
baseline from 1- and 5-year follow-up SIENAx estimates and
dividing by the baseline values, then multiplying by 100. We as-
sessed the PBVC estimated by SIENA for changes from baseline to
1 and 5 years. Finally, we assessed Spearman correlations between
NfL and NfH levels in a subgroup of 42 patients with determi-
nation of both biomarkers.
Replication phase. Primary endpoints were conversion to
CDMS and 2010 McDonald MS according to NfL status (posi-
tive/negative) based on a 900 ng/L cutoff value, established as the
mean 6 3 SD of NfL levels in a control group of patients with
noninflammatory neurologic diseases.25 We performed uni- and
multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses for NfL
levels as a continuous or dichotomic variable. Covariates were
OCBs, baseline T2 lesion number, DMT before MS, and hospital
where NfL levels were determined. We used generalized linear
models to compare NfL levels in terms of disability accrual (EDSS
score $3.0), and Spearman correlations or generalized linear mod-
els to determine associations between NfL and MRI inflammatory
parameters at baseline and 1 year. We could not assess brain volume

 changes because of the few estimated measures at the time of the
analysis.
We performed statistical tests on the 0.05 level of signifi-
cance, using the IBM SPSS Statistics (version 20.0; IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY). We also prepared figures using GraphPad Prism
5.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This study received approval from the corresponding
local ethical committees in both hospitals and all patients signed
a written informed consent.
RESULTS Screening phase. Appendix e-1A describes
preliminary analyses. Baseline demographic and clini-
cal characteristics were comparable between CIS
groups (table 1) except for the higher frequency of
optic neuritis in CIS-CIS regarding FA, NfL, and
NfH. The proportion of patients on DMT before
CDMS varied between 8.8% and 17.7% for each
biomarker. Mean follow-up was longer for CIS-
CDMS than CIS-CIS tested for GFAP and NfH.
The differences in storage time between CIS-CDMS
and CIS-CIS samples for NfH did not correlate with
this biomarker’s levels (rs 5 20.131, p 5 0.256). NfH
levels correlated with age (rs 5 0.230, p 5 0.044). We
found no differences in time from CIS to lumbar
puncture. Therefore, for each protein, we adjusted
the analyses for age, topography, and/or DMT.
FA, GFAP, and NfH results were negative (figure e-2,
A–C). We could not detect neurofascin and sema3A.
As for NfL levels, we found a significant difference
between

ng/L) and CIS-CIS (499.0 [168.8–829.2] ng/L) (p ,
0.0001) (figure 1). The average intra- and interplate
coefficients of variation (CVs) were 9.7% and 0.5%,
respectively. We found no significant differences for
EDSS progression of 1 point or $3.0, even though in
the latter case, NfL levels were 1,506.1 (645.2–2,367.1)
ng/L in the 15 patients with EDSS score $3.0 and
906.6 (693.2–1,120.1) ng/L if ,3.0 (p 5 0.185).
We found significant correlations between NfL levels
and inflammatory activity parameters on MRI, except
for Gd-enhancing lesions at 5 years (table 2). As for
neurodegenerative parameters, NfL and both BPFD
and PBVC at 5 years showed the strongest correlations
(table 2, figure 2).
Finally, we found a correlation between NfL and
NfH levels (rs 5 0.466, p 5 0.002).
Replication phase. Appendix e-1B describes prelimi-
nary analyses. Baseline demographic and clinical char-
acteristics are shown in table e-1. Median (interquartile
range) NfL levels were 1,238.3 (1,782.1) ng/L for pa-
tients converting to CDMS and 555.8 (825.5) ng/L
for CIS-CIS. Average intra- and interplate CV were
4.9% and 7.0% at Vall d’Hebron (n 5 93) and
5.1% and 8.8% at Ramón y Cajal (n 5 62).
According to the cutoff, 63 patients (40.6%) were
NfL positive. Significantly more NfL-positive patients

 converted to CDMS or fulfilled McDonald MS over
time (data not shown).
When evaluating NfL levels as a continuous vari-
able in the univariate analyses, we observed a 1-point
increase in risk of both CDMS and McDonald MS
for every 100-ng/L increment. The adjusted hazard
ratio (aHR) for CDMS remained significant in the
multivariate analysis (table 3).
As for NfL status, NfL positivity was a predictor of
CDMS (HR 2.279, 95% CI 1.283–4.049, p 5 0.005)
and McDonald MS (HR 2.801, 95% CI 1.761–4.455,
p , 0.0001) in the univariate analyses; however, this
significance was lost in the multivariate models (aHR
1.220, 95% CI 0.656–2.269, p 5 0.530 and aHR
1.347, 95% CI 0.809–2.244, p 5 0.252, respectively).
Regarding disability, although NfL levels were
2,635.6 (1,226.4–4,044.8) ng/L in the 11 patients
with EDSS score $3.0 and 1,560.5 (934.8–2,186.2)
ng/L if ,3.0, this difference was not statistically sig-
nificant (p 5 0.172).
Finally, we found significant correlations between
NfL levels and T2 lesion volume and Gd-enhancing
lesion number on baseline MRIs (n 5 63, rs 5 0.517,
p , 0.0001 and n 5 146, rs 5 0.469, p , 0.0001,
respectively) and follow-up MRIs (n 5 36, rs 5 0.420,
p 5 0.011 for new T2 lesion volume and n 5 94, rs 5
0.231, p 5 0.025 for Gd-enhancing lesions). Higher
NfL levels were associated with a higher T2 lesion num-
ber at baseline and 1 year (data not shown).
DISCUSSION In the screening phase, we aimed to
identify differences in biomarker levels under the
rationale that, if none were found between 2 opposite
CIS groups,26 none would be found in consecutive
patients, a scenario that better resembles clinical prac-
tice. In addition, this phase allows a strict use of
biological samples. Only NfL levels were significantly
higher in patients who converted to MS compared to
nonconverters. Neurofilaments are type IV interme-
diate filaments specific for neurons, released into the
CSF when axonal damage occurs.16,27,28 A study with
38 patients reported higher NfL levels in CIS-CDMS
compared to CIS-CIS,18 a finding unconfirmed in other
investigations including 9 to 36 patients per group.20,29,30
Such discrepancies could be attributable to a small
sample size in the converter group,20,30 homogeneity in
baseline inflammatory parameters such as proportion of
OCBs present in both CIS groups,29 or the method used
to detect NfL.30 In addition, sample size calculations are
not referred and some groups may be too small to
properly demonstrate any differences. Our study was
adequately powered and thus confirms the differences
with a well-balanced distribution between groups.
We found no associations between NfL levels and
disability by the EDSS. Except for one, most studies
showed
significant
correlations,
but
the
analyses
included CIS and other MS phenotypes, observing the
strongest correlations in progressive forms.13,14,18,31–33
Khalil et al.20 evaluated 67 patients with CIS exclusively
and found a marginal correlation coefficient of rs 5
0.324 (p , 0.05). When assessing NfL levels according
to EDSS score $3.0 in both phases, they were higher in
patients with more severe disability but the difference
was not significant, a finding probably influenced by the
few patients who reached such EDSS score.

 We observed significant associations between NfL
and MRI inflammatory parameters on baseline and
follow-up MRIs, with similar findings during the rep-
lication phase. Regarding Gd-enhancing lesions, in the
screening, we found correlations with NfL levels at
baseline and 1 year, observed again in the replication
phase, but not at 5 years. There are previous reports
of correlations with T2 lesion number and Gd-
enhancing lesions in CIS and/or MS groups,18,25
unconfirmed in other CIS-specific studies.20,34 The
most striking findings concern MRI neurodegenerative
parameters: our results suggest baseline NfL levels
increase not only in association with lesion load,
accrual, and activity, but also independently of these
parameters.35,36 On the contrary, a previous study did
not find any correlations between NfL levels and brain
volume change in CIS.20 Although the authors did
adjust for age and used the SIENA software, they as-
sessed the follow-up only at 1 year and did not control
by Gd-enhancing lesions. We additionally evaluated
the association between baseline NfL levels and brain
volume changes at 5 years. Our findings are partly
supported by those of Burman et al.,15 in which NfL
levels were elevated irrespective of Gd-enhancing le-
sions in progressive MS. Unfortunately, our appraisal
is limited: our sample size was small and we were
unable to repeat this evaluation in the replication
phase. However, by estimating both BPFD and PBVC,
the latter a robust method, we believe our results are
reliable and should be assessed in future studies.

 Of note, there was a significant correlation
between NfL and NfH levels, in accordance with pre-
vious publications on CIS and relapsing-remitting
MS,18,20,31 although contrary to our results, some of
these studies demonstrated associations between NfH
and EDSS or MRI parameters.18,20 Thus, the origin of
this correlation in our study is a matter of debate and
deserves further study.
In the replication phase, considering that a dichoto-
mic biomarker could be more useful in the clinical
practice, we explored a 900 ng/L cutoff,25 observing
that more NfL-positive than -negative patients evolved
to CDMS and McDonald MS. Two other studies
explored cutoff values to either identify relapses or pre-
dict evolution to secondary progressive MS.13,37 Their
cutoff values, however, are lower than ours, a finding
possibly related not only to the different outcomes but
also to the use of a different assay,13 or the calculation
methods based on NfL levels in patients with MS,13,37
whereas we established our cutoff using a control group
with noninflammatory neurologic diseases under the
rationale that this value would be more stable across
studies. To assess whether this is a better approach, the
cutoff should be evaluated in other cohorts. One study
explored NfL levels and fulfillment of the 2010 dis-
semination in space criteria in optic neuritis,34 whereas
we used the cutoff value to investigate the risk of devel-
oping both CDMS and 2010 McDonald MS at the
time of a CIS. Another contribution is the assessment
of NfL as an independent risk factor for MS. In the
univariate analyses, we found a higher risk of CDMS
and McDonald MS for every 100-ng/L increase in NfL
levels, maintained for CDMS in the multivariate anal-
ysis. The nonsignificant results for McDonald MS
could be conditioned by the distribution of patients
over the different categories in the multivariate analy-
sis, the correlations between NfL levels and T2 lesions,
and the strong predictive value of T2 lesions for dis-
semination in space fulfillment. When assessing NfL
status, the increased risk of both CDMS and McDo-
nald MS in the univariate analyses was lost in the
multivariate models. Thus, although NfL status could
be more practical in the clinical setting, in our study,
only NfL as a continuous variable is an independent
risk factor for CDMS. Nevertheless, the value of NfL
should be considered in context with OCB and T2
lesion results and, according to a recent study, it could
be considered a weak risk factor for MS.6
Despite conducting measures to minimize bias,
a limitation in the replication phase concerns the
NfL determination in 2 different centers. Although
the corresponding intra- and interplate CVs were
within the assay’s standardized limits, we did not per-
form quality controls such as testing the same samples
in both centers.38 Besides, the shorter follow-up of the
Vall d’Hebron cohort in the replication phase may
preclude excluding patients with potential alternative
diagnoses; nevertheless, the specific inclusion of typical
CIS presentations lowers this risk.6 Furthermore,
a shortcoming of NfL levels is their determination in
CSF because some centers do not perform lumbar
punctures routinely. It is impossible to quantify serum
NfL levels with the available ELISA29,30; however,
a new electrochemiluminescence array showed prom-
ising results in detecting higher serum NfL levels in
patients with CIS compared to healthy controls.39
Our biomarker list was probably not thoroughly
comprehensive. We did, however, search for updates

 throughout the study duration. Besides, the proper-
ties of the selected assays could have influenced our
findings. Another limitation is the difficulty in assess-
ing all biomarkers in the same patients without com-
promising the sample size given the limited CSF
aliquot availability. Nevertheless, the homogeneous
data collection and systematic sample storage proce-
dures could aid to minimize bias. Finally, we did
not compare the NfH electrochemiluminescence
assay to other methods.
Therefore, elevated NfL levels indicate a higher risk
of evolving to MS. However, the increase in risk for
every 100 ng/L could be difficult to interpret in the
daily clinical practice and, compared to OCBs and
T2 lesions, NfL levels are a weak risk factor for MS.
The search for a cutoff value should be assessed in
other cohorts and, finally, the value of NfL as a marker
of axonal damage may be more relevant as suggested by
the correlations with medium-term brain volume loss.

Neurology 
 generates the question: Would this high exacerbation
rate happen if patients were allowed to achieve remis-
sion with steroids without using MMF?
It was previously illustrated that among patients
with MG who were treated with steroids, 80.2%
(93/116) achieved remission/minimal manifestations
status and only 18% (17/93) experienced an exacer-
bation afterward.2 This clues in that the high exacer-
bation rate reported by Oskarsson et al. after
discontinuing MMF may not reflect the natural dis-
ease activity but rather reflects MMF dependence,
and that continuing MMF mainly treats the depen-
dence. Both studies are limited by a lack of informa-
tion on the prednisone dose required to maintain
remission/minimal manifestations status (an impor-
tant data point to determine whether MMF is
effective).
Author Response: Björn Oskarsson, Sacramento;
David M. Rocke, Davis; Karsten Dengel, Sacramento;
David P. Richman, Davis, CA: We thank Dimachkie
et al. for their interest in our article.1 However, in oppo-
sition to Dimachkie et al., we would consider MG
exacerbations after discontinuation of MMF as MG
exacerbations rather than a novel MMF dependence
condition. Given this premise, patients with pharmaco-
logically controlled MG seem a more appropriate con-
trol group compared to patients who had MG but
sustain remission without pharmacologic treatment.
We would suspect that patients without symptoms
or treatment may have a less-active disease compared
to a population requiring treatment. This last group is
also rare in our clinic, further making such a compari-
son less meaningful.
The patients were selected on the basis of being on
stable doses of prednisone (0–25 mg/d; see table 2)1
and only MMF was varied. Our article does not
address corticosteroid treatment of MG and we do
not argue that corticosteroids are not an effective
treatment of MG. The interest in treating MG with
MMF stems primarily from MMF’s more favorable
side-effect profile.

CORRECTIONS
Neurofilament light chain level is a weak risk factor for the development of MS
In the article “Neurofilament light chain level is a weak risk factor for the development of MS” by G. Arrambide et al.,1
there is an error in figure 2. In panel C, the p value should read “p , 0.0001” rather than “p , 0.0001” as originally
published. The editorial staff regrets the error.
