Background: The ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) version 1.0 (v1.0) was published in May 2015 and
was the first version of a validated and reproducible tool to assess the magnitude of clinical benefit from new cancer therapies.
The ESMO-MCBS was designed to be a dynamic tool with planned revisions and updates based upon recognition of expanding
needs and shortcomings identified since the last review.
Methods: The revision process for the ESMO-MCBS incorporates a nine-step process: Careful review of critiques and
suggestions, and identification of problems in the application of v1.0; Identification of shortcomings for revision in the
upcoming version; Proposal and evaluation of solutions to address identified shortcomings; Field testing of solutions;
Preparation of a near-final revised version for peer review for reasonableness by members of the ESMO Faculty and Guidelines
Committee; Amendments based on peer review for reasonableness; Near-final review by members of the ESMO-MCBS Working
Group and the ESMO Executive Board; Final amendments; Final review and approval by members of the ESMO-MCBS Working
Group and the ESMO Executive Board.
Results: Twelve issues for revision or amendment were proposed for consideration; proposed amendments were formulated
for eight identified shortcomings. The proposed amendments are classified as either structural, technical, immunotherapy
triggered or nuanced. All amendments were field tested in a wide range of studies comparing scores generated with ESMO-
MCBS v1.0 and version 1.1 (v1.1).
Conclusions: ESMO-MCBS v1.1 incorporates 10 revisions and will allow for scoring of single-arm studies. Scoring remains very
stable; revisions in v1.1 alter the scores of only 12 out of 118 comparative studies and facilitate scoring for single-arm studies.

Introduction
The ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS)
v1.0 was published in May 2015 [1] and was the first version of a
validated and reproducible tool to assess the magnitude of the clin-
ical benefit from new and effective cancer therapies. The tool uses a
rational, structured and consistent approach to derive a relative
ranking of the magnitude of clinically meaningful benefit that can
be expected from a new anti-cancer treatment.
The ESMO-MCBS was designed to be a dynamic tool with
planned revisions and updates based upon recognition of ex-
panding needs and shortcomings identified since the last review.
For instance, while there is a recent trend for more medication to
be approved on the basis of single-arm studies, the first version
only scored comparative studies. Therefore, there was a manifest
imperative to formulate and to incorporate an approach to grade
the clinical benefit data derived from the registration trials of
medications approved on the basis of these single-arm studies.
Additional impetus for revision was derived from experience
accrued in evaluating a further large cohort of studies published
between 2014 and 2016; feedback and queries from clinicians, pa-
tients, researchers and representatives of the pharmaceutical in-
dustry; and a dynamic process of internal peer review.

 Commitment to ‘accountability for reasonableness’, which
represents the ethical gold-standard for a fair priority setting
process in public policy [2, 3], demands a process for challenges
and appeals and requires that the deliberative process be trans-
parent. In accordance with this standard, the revised v1.1 of the
ESMO-MCBS is presented with point-by-point deliberative ex-
planation, including the shortcomings identified in v1.0, de-
scription of the amendment in v1.1, and explanation of the
rationale including relevant index cases.
Methodology
The revision process for the ESMO-MCBS incorporates a nine-
step process: 1. Careful review of critiques and suggestions, and
identification of problems in the application of v1.0; 2.
Identification of shortcomings for revision in the upcoming ver-
sion; 3. Proposal and evaluation of solutions to address identified
shortcomings; 4. Field testing of solutions; 5. Preparation of a
near-final revised version for peer review for reasonableness by
members of the ESMO Faculty and Guidelines Committee; 6.
Amendments based on peer review for reasonableness; 7. Near-
final review by members of the ESMO-MCBS Working Group
and the ESMO Executive Board; 8. Final amendments; 9. Final
review and approval by members of the ESMO-MCBS Working
Group and the ESMO Executive Board.
Twelve issues for revision or amendment were proposed for
consideration (Table 1). Of these, one, the use of the lower limit
of the 95% confidence interval (CI) rather than the point esti-
mate, had been reviewed extensively by the Working Group and
subjected to extensive statistical modelling (to be published in
full in ESMO Open) and a decision was made not to subject this
issue to revision. Three issues have been deferred for further con-
sultation with patient representative organisations. These include
toxicity penalties, credit for improvements in quality of life
(QoL) or deferred deterioration in QoL and credits for single
symptom improvements.
Proposed amendments were formulated for the remaining
eight identified shortcomings. The proposed amendments are
classified as either structural, technical, immunotherapy trig-
gered or nuanced. Structural amendments (n ¼ 2) involve either
the addition of a new form or a restructuring of an existing form
with the addition of a new prognostic stratification. Technical
amendments (n ¼ 1) involve changes to the instructions regard-
ing the application of the ESMO-MCBS. Immunotherapy trig-
gered amendments (n ¼ 3) refer to amendments triggered by
evolving issues derived from the expanding experience in evaluat-
ing new immunotherapy-based studies. Nuanced amendments
(n ¼ 4) correct shortcomings identified in the scoring of existing
forms. The amendments for each of the revised sections of the
ESMO-MCBS: Introduction, form 1, forms 2a and 2b, and the
new form 3 are detailed in this manuscript.
Field testing, comparing scores generated on v1.0 and v1.1, was
undertaken in 118 comparative studies (supplementary Tables
S1–S15, available at Annals of Oncology online). A pre-final ver-
sion and the field testing results derived from the proposed
amendments were peer reviewed by members of the ESMO
Faculty and Guidelines Committee for ‘reasonableness’. Based on
feedback from this peer review process, amendments were further
adjusted and revised. The final amendments resulted in a change
in score for 12 studies: 4 comparative studies having scores
upgraded by 1 point and 3 achieving scores in situations where
they were not previously scorable (Table 2), and 5 having scores
downgraded (Table 3); along with new scoring of 10 single-arm
studies (Table 4). The final version (v1.1) is presented in Figure 1
and has been approved by the ESMO-MCBS Working Group and
the ESMO Executive Board.
INSTRUCTIONS:
SHORTCOMINGS
IN
v1.0
AND
AMENDMENT IN v1.1.
Shortcoming: Instructions regarding subgroup analyses were
not adequately clear.
Amendment: Instructions regarding subgroup analyses were re-
drafted to more clearly reflect the published eligibility guidelines
for the application of the ESMO-MCBS [1]. The rules for sub-
group analyses are more clearly specified in the instructions as
following:
• Studies with pre-planned subgroup analyses with a maximum
of three subgroups can be graded (provided there is adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons).
• When statistically significant results are reported for any sub-
group, then each of these should be graded separately.
• Subgroups not showing statistically significant results are not
graded.
• Except for studies that incorporate collection of tissue sam-
ples to enable re-stratification based on new genetic or other
biomarkers, findings from un-planned (post hoc) subgroup
analysis cannot be graded and they can only be used as foun-
dation for hypothesis generation.
Rationale: Point of clarification.
Type: Technical.

 Index case: The SQUIRE study of cisplatin and gemcitabine with
or without the addition of necitumumab in first-line treatment of
patients with metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer
included a planned subgroup analysis for tumours expressing
EGFR H-score less than or greater than 200 which did not dem-
onstrate any predictive significance [4]. In a subsequent publica-
tion, the authors published results of an unplanned exploratory
re-analysis of the data re-stratifying the cohorts to EGFR-
expressing or non-EGFR-expressing [5]. In the EGFR-expressing
subgroup an OS advantage was reported: HR 0.79 (0.69–0.92) ab-
solute gain in median survival 1.7 months and with a 2-year sur-
vival gain of 3%–5%.
An appeal was submitted by the study sponsor to have the un-
planned exploratory re-analysis accredited with ESMO-MCBS
score 3.
The ESMO-MCBS Working Group evaluated the appeal and
also noted the authors’ conclusions ‘these data should be inter-
preted in the context of the SQUIRE ITT results and caution
should be exercised, especially when it comes to the outcomes of
smaller subgroups. . .. Further analyses of the data are needed in
order to better understand the potential predictive role of EGFR
copy number gain in this setting’. The appeal to score the un-
planned exploratory analysis was declined.
FORM 1: SHORTCOMINGS IN v1.0 AND AMENDMENT IN
v1.1.
Shortcoming: Version 1.0 had no framework to score adjuvant
therapies approved on the basis of pathological complete re-
mission (pCR).
Amendment: New criteria for grade C have been inserted
‘Improvements in pCR (pathological complete remission) alone
(primary end point) by �30% relative gain AND �15% absolute
gain in studies without mature survival data’.
Type: Nuanced.
Rationale: Pertuzumab was approved by both the European
Medicines
Agency
(EMA)
and
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration (FDA) in addition to chemotherapy and trastu-
zumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2 overexpressed in-
vasive
ductal
breast
cancer,
on
the
basis
of
substantial
improvement in the pCR rate of patients with HER2 overexpress-
ing invasive ductal breast cancer. The approval by the FDA is an
accelerated (provisional) approval. There continues to be sub-
stantial controversy regarding the validity of pCR as a surrogate
for overall survival (OS) in neoadjuvant studies in solid tumours.
It is graded at a level C because of this on-going controversy [6].
Index case: In the randomised phase II NeoSphere trial of neoad-
juvant therapy with trastuzumab and docetaxel 6pertuzumab
for HER2 overexpressed invasive ductal breast cancer, there was a
17% increase in the pCR rate (46% versus 29%) [7]. Based on
this, the FDA granted accelerated (provisional) approval for the
addition of pertuzumab to chemotherapy and trastuzumab in the
neoadjuvant setting and the EMA approved the indication with a
provision for ‘additional monitoring’. ESMO-MCBS v1.0 was

 not able to score this trial; in v1.1 it scores grade C
(Improvements in pCR alone, as primary end point, by �30%
relative AND �15% absolute gain in studies without mature sur-
vival data).
FORM 2a: SHORTCOMINGS IN v1.0 AND AMENDMENT IN
v1.1.
Shortcoming: The thresholds for absolute gain in median
survival in the subsection for patients with a median
OS >12 months, provided inadequate constraints in the situ-
ation of clinical studies where the median OS was very long.
Amendment: The prognostic stratification for form 2a has been
revised, v1.1 incorporates a three-level prognostic stratifica-
tion:�12months,>12 to�24months, and>24months. The>24-
month stratification is introduced to achieve maximal score if either:
HR�0.70 AND Gain�9months or increase in 7-year survival
of>10%.
Type: Structural.
Rationale: For grade assignment in the ESMO-MCBS, the high-
est grade is assigned to successful trials providing a meaningful
relative benefit, taking into account the variability of the estimate
coupled with a minimum relevant observed absolute gain (quan-
titative component). It is thus guided by a dual rule based on the
comparison to pre-specified threshold values of the observed
relative benefit and the absolute benefit achieved by the therapy.
Statistical simulation studies on the scoring criteria for v1.0 iden-
tified that for the subgroup of studies in which the median sur-
vival for the control arm was very long (>2 years), the absolute
gain threshold restricted to 5 months did not apply adequate con-
straint on scores credited on the basis of HR � 0.70. This was
identified as an important deficiency requiring amendment.
Index cases: In the EMILIA study of T-DM1 versus the combin-
ation therapy of lapatinib and capecitabine, the control arm had
an OS of 25.1 months and the survival gain was 5.8 months [8, 9],
thus generating the same preliminary score of 4 as the
CLEOPATRA study of paclitaxel and trastuzumab with or with-
out the addition or pertuzumab in which the control arm OS was
40.8 months and the gain was 15.7 months [10–13]. In v1.1, this
anomaly is corrected; the preliminary ESMO-MCBS score for
the EMILIA study is downgraded from 4 to 3, and the final
ESMO-MCBS score derived from the credit for co-primary
outcome of PFS and quality of life benefit is 4.
Shortcoming: Studies in which there was a long-term plateau
in the survival curve (such as in the case of ipilimumab in mel-
anoma) were not credited as having curative potential.
Amendment: There is a new adjustment to the preliminary scor-
ing: ‘If there is a long-term plateau in the survival curve, and OS
advantage continues to be observed at 5 years (or 7 years for dis-
eases with median survival >24 months), also score according to
form 1 (treatments with curative potential) and present both
scores, i.e. A/4’.
Type: Immunotherapy triggered.
Rationale: In some diseases exceptional responders may achieve
protracted complete remission (CR) with the possibility of long-
term disease control and survival. Historically, this has been
described in the setting of small-cell-lung cancer [14]. More re-
cently, long-term follow-up data after immunotherapy for meta-
static melanoma suggested some patients may achieve long-term
disease control with the potential for cure. The potential for cure
is indicated by a sustained plateau in the long-term survival data.
This amendment recognises that some treatments may have bene-
fits both in a non-curative and curative setting and that the clinical
benefit scale ought to credit both. It is important to emphasise that
prolonged (5 or 7 year) survival advantage alone, without a plateau
in the curve (as has been observed in some instances of breast and
prostate cancer), does not meet this criterion.
Index case: The study of dacarbazine 6ipilimumab in the treat-
ment of metastatic melanoma initially demonstrated a modest
survival gain of 2.1 months over a control of 9.1 months with
HR 0.69 (0.57–0.84) and with 2-year survival gain of 10.6%
scoring ESMO-MCBS 4 [15]. Long-term follow-up subse-
quently demonstrated a plateau on the survival curve after
3 years, with a 9.4% absolute increase in 5-year OS [16] which
meets form 1 criteria or grade A. Consequently, the ESMO-
MCBS v1.1 score is A/4.
Shortcoming: Anomalies in the absolute gain criteria for grade
2 scoring, did not allow scoring for some studies.
Amendment: Grade 2 scoring across all prognostic groups (based
on median OS of the control arm) has been amended to credit
studies achieving optimal HR targets but small absolute gains, as
well as studies achieving an intermediate HR which achieve me-
dian survival gains above a minimal threshold.
Type: Nuanced.
Rationale: Statistical modelling of plausible outcome scenarios
using v1.0, which incorporated both a lower and upper limit for
median survival gain, identified the problem that some studies
with intermediate HRs could not be scored because survival gain
was outside the defining limits. This problem was also observed
in the setting of some low HR scenarios in which the absolute
gain in median OS was very modest. The revision corrects these
anomalies in the scale function and corrects the lacunae in the
scoring continuum.
Index case: The KEYNOTE-010 study [17] compared docetaxel
to pembrolizumab 2 or 10 mg/kg in advanced non-small-cell
lung cancer with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumour cells.
The experimental arm of pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg achieved a 1.9-
month gain in median survival (10.4 versus 8.5 months), HR 0.71
(0.58–0.88). In v1.0, there was a grading lacuna that resulted
in this scenario being unscorable. With the v1.1 amendment,
this scenario is now scorable, and achieves a preliminary score of
2 which is upgraded to a final score of 3 based on reduced
toxicity.

 Shortcoming: Grade 1 and grade 2 credit for low magnitude
improvements in 2- and 3-year survival, corresponding to
gains of <10%, lacked adequate statistical justification.
Amendment: Grade 1 and grade 2 credit for low magnitude im-
provements of <10% absolute gain 2-year survival (for studies
with control median OS <12 months) and 3-year survival in
studies (for studies with median control OS >12 months) have
been deleted.
Type: Nuanced.
Rationale: Published OS plots typically do not include confi-
dence intervals. When small differences are identified in the tail
of a survival curve, when the number of surviving cases is small,
the likelihood that confidence intervals would overlap is high and
therefore crediting benefit based on such small differences is not
statistically justifiable.
Index cases: According to ESMO-MCBS v1.0, the REVEL study
of docetaxel versus ramucirumab in the second-line treatment of
non-small-cell lung cancer [18] with control median OS of
9.1 months and median gain of 1.4 months with HR 0.86 (0.75–
0.98) would have qualified it for an ESMO-MCBS score of 1 on
these considerations alone. However, the score was upgraded to 2
on the basis of a 2-year survival gain of 3%–5% that was observed
in the tail of the survival curve. In another two instances, studies
with relatively small gains in median survival had been upgraded
on the basis of a 2-year survival gain of 5%–10% in the tail of the
curve: The addition of ramucirumab to FOLFIRI in advanced
colorectal cancer [19] was upgraded from 1 to 3 and the superior-
ity of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine over gem-
citabine alone in advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer [20]
was upgraded from 2 to 3. In v1.1, these upgrades are rescinded
because it is highly unlikely such small differences in the tail of
the curve are statistically significant.
In contrast, the CheckMate 057 study demonstrating superior-
ity of nivolumab over docetaxel as second line therapy after
platinum-based therapy for non-squamous non-small-cell lung
cancer [21, 22] was upgraded in v1.0 from 3 to 4 on the basis of
a >10% increase in 2-year survival. Although this credit may also
be statistically dubious, the possibility of it being significant is
considered more plausible, and in v1.1 credit continues to be
accrued for 2- and 3-year survival gain of this magnitude.
FORM 2b: SHORTCOMINGS IN v1.0 AND AMENDMENT IN
v1.1.
Shortcoming 1: In v1.0 there was no mechanism to credit plat-
eauing in progression-free survival (PFS) curves. This resulted
in low grading for treatments with a small gain in median PFS
but improved duration of response (DoR) among the patients
who did respond.
Amendment: The addition of a new adjustment. Upgrade 1 level if
there is a long-term plateau in the PFS curve, and there is�10% im-
provement in PFS at 1year for control median PFS<6months
or�10% improvement in PFS at 2years for median PFS>6months.
Type: Immunotherapy triggered.
Rationale: The rapidly evolving experience with immunother-
apy interventions has highlighted the scenario in which very
prolonged responses may be observed in a minority of pa-
tients. In this scenario, the relatively modest improvement in
median PFS may be accompanied by a far more substantial
widening of sustained PFS advantage with time, associated
with a prolonged DoR. This amendment corrects the anomaly
whereby scoring based only on median PFS, without looking at
sustained advantage in PFS, understates the magnitude of clin-
ical benefit.
Index cases: In the study of combination therapy nivolumab plus
ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone versus ipilimumab alone as
first-line therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic
melanoma [23], the combination therapy scores only a grade of 2
according to v1.0. The maximal preliminary score of 3 is achieved
on the basis of improved median PFS gain of 7.6 months (control
2.9 months), HR 0.42 (0.31–0.57). However, this is adjusted
down to 2 because of high toxicity. In v1.1, additional credit is
given for plateau in PFS curve with >10% gain at 1 year, thus
upgrading the score to 3. Similarly, in the Keynote-002 study of
pembrolizumab (2 versus 10 mg/kg) versus investigator-choice
second-line therapy for metastatic melanoma after failure of ipili-
mumab, BRAF or MEK inhibitor [24], additional credit is given
for plateau in PFS curve with >10% gain at 1 year, raising the
score from 3 with v1.0 to 4 with the additional adjustment
in v1.1.
Shortcoming 2: PFS studies with early crossover because of
early stopping or crossover based on detection of survival ad-
vantage at interim analysis, and with no mature OS advantage,
are not credited with improving OS in v1.0.
Amendment: Addition of a new adjustment to ‘Upgrade 1 level if
study had early crossover because of early stopping or crossover
based on detection of survival advantage at interim analysis’.
Type: Immunotherapy triggered.
Rationale: Preliminary PFS data are capped at a maximum of
grade 3 because of the limitations of PFS as a surrogate for ei-
ther improvement in OS or improvement in QoL. ESMO-
MCBS v1.0 was designed to allow upgrade for PFS studies in
which secondary outcome data demonstrated improved OS. In
v1.0, the only mechanism for this upgrade was based on im-
provement in median OS. This approach penalised studies
which incorporated early stopping or crossover based on de-
tection of survival advantage at interim analysis, particularly
in situations where the interim analysis was performed before
median survival was reached. This amendment corrects this
anomaly and provides an extra mechanism for crediting im-
proved magnitude of clinical benefit evidenced by survival ad-
vantage at interim analysis.
This upgrade does not apply to situations in which early stop-
ping or crossover are based on detection of PFS advantage at in-
terim analysis.

 Index case: None.
Shortcoming 3: The penalty for studies with PFS advantage
only, with no gain in OS or QoL, did not explicitly indicate that
survival data must be mature.
Amendment: The adjustment criterion has been amended
‘Downgrade 1 level if the drug ONLY leads to improved PFS (ma-
ture data shows no OS advantage) and QoL assessment does not
demonstrate improved QoL’.
Type: Nuanced.
Rationale: It is inappropriate to penalise a study with inconclu-
sive immature interim survival data when mature data may refute
the penalty.
Index case: The phase II Study 19 which evaluated the role of
olaparib for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer in first remission
[25–27] demonstrated a PFS advantage but no survival advantage
at an interim analysis of immature survival data. Incorrect appli-
cation of the penalty for PFS studies which yield neither survival
nor QoL benefit led to a downgrading from 3 to 2. This penalty is
rescinded in v1.1.
NEW FORM 3: SINGLE-ARM STUDIES IN ‘ORPHAN
DISEASES’ AND FOR DISEASES WITH ‘HIGH UNMET
NEED’ WHEN PRIMARY OUTCOME IS PROGRESSION
FREE SURVIVAL (PFS) OR OVERALL RESPONSE RATE
(ORR).
Shortcoming: In v1.0, there was no mechanism to evaluate
medications approved on the basis of single-arm studies.
Amendment: Development of a new form 3 ‘For single-arm stud-
ies in ‘orphan diseases’ and for diseases with ‘high unmet need’
when primary outcome is PFS or ORR’.
Type: Structural.
Rationale: In the past 5 years, an increasing number of agents
have been approved by regulatory authorities on the basis of data
derived from single-arm studies. Overwhelmingly, these ap-
provals have been in the setting of either uncommon diseases, co-
horts of small target populations identified by biological markers
or situations in which there is no alternative treatment strategy
and ‘high unmet need’ for new therapeutic strategies.
Even in the absence of a comparator arm, there is a perceived
need to provide information regarding the magnitude of clinical
benefit. The published papers describing the studies of agents
which have been approved are characterised by a paucity of data
regarding the natural history of untreated patients and the litera-
ture is characterised by a presumption of poor outcomes in the
absence of disease modifying treatment.
A review of published studies leading to license indications
identified that three major indicators of clinical benefit leading to
approval were response rate, either ORR or CR, DoR, and PFS.
Infrequently, measurements of QoL have been incorporated.
Based upon this review, the ESMO-MCBS Working Group has
developed a three grade scale for single-arm studies in orphan
diseases and for diseases with high unmet need when primary
outcome is PFS or ORR. The highest grade of 3 is awarded to
studies
demonstrating
either:
median
PFS >6 months;
ORR > 60%; or ORR �20 <60% AND DoR �9 months.
Preliminary scores are adjusted based on toxicity (Downgrade
1 level if there are �30% grade 3–4 toxicities impacting on daily
well-being), QoL (Upgrade 1 level if improved QoL) or confirma-
tory phase 4 experience (Upgrade 1 level for confirmatory, ad-
equately sized, phase 4 experience).
Field testing
All amendments incorporated into v1.1 have been field tested in
128 studies, reported in 142 publications across a range of 15 dis-
ease groups in the comparative studies and 5 disease groups in
the single-arm setting (see Tables 2–4 and supplementary Tables
S1–S15, available at Annals of Oncology online). Field testing has
been reviewed by the ESMO Guidelines Committee and ESMO
Faculty for reasonableness. The amended version resulted in
scoring changes in 12 randomised studies (Tables 2 and 3) and
facilitated scoring for 10 single-arm studies (Table 4).
Discussion
The ESMO-MCBS has proven to be a valued and reproducible
tool for the evaluation of the magnitude of benefit from clinical
studies that is essential for both policy and clinical discourse.
Dynamic discussion with end-users who have provided feedback,
critiques and suggestions has helped facilitate a dynamic quality
improvement process that is essential to maintain the integrity of
this important endeavour.
Since its launch in 2015, the ESMO-MCBS has been widely
cited (source Scopus/Google Scholar). It has been applied in clin-
ical and in health technology assessment settings [28, 29], suc-
cessfully employed by the ESMO Guidelines Committee [30],
demonstrated clinical utility [31] and has served as the basis for
benchmarking studies [32].
ESMO-MCBS v1.1 incorporates 9 amendments in forms 1, 2a
and 2b and adds a new form 3 for scoring of single-arm studies.
For the most part, the scoring remains very stable. The 10 revi-
sions in v1.1 will alter the scores of only 12 out of 118 compara-
tive studies. In the seven studies impacted by the revision, the
newer version either upgrades the score or enables scoring which
was previously not possible and in five instances a score is low-
ered by the amendments.
A transparent process of development with scope for peer re-
view, appeal and revision is one of the critical criteria for ‘ac-
countability for reasonableness’ [2, 3]. The validity of this
revision derives from a careful deliberative process followed by
extensive field testing and peer review. This first revision is an in-
tegral part of the planned process for on-going development and
the Working Group invites feedback, discussion, review and con-
structive critiques of the revised v1.1 as well as any appeals re-
garding scores derived using the new version.

 Not all issues could be addressed in this revision. For the next
planned revision, the ESMO-MCBS Working Group will be so-
liciting stakeholder input from patients and patient advocates re-
garding the toxicity penalties, credit for improvements in QoL or
deferred deterioration in QoL and credits for single symptom im-
provements. This process will involve formal consultations with
patient advocacy groups and an open invitation for feedback or
suggestions regarding these aspects of the scale.
The amendments incorporated into v1.1 will be applied to studies
previously scored and will prevail until the next planned revision.
Conclusion
The 10 amendments incorporated into ESMO-MCBS v1.1 im-
prove the discriminatory capacity and utility of the grading sys-
tem. These revisions are part of an organisational commitment
by ESMO to the continual quality improvement that is essential
for accountability for reasonableness, incorporating a transparent
revision process based on accrued experience, feedback, consult-
ation and the critical review necessary to promote the integrity of
this important endeavour.

Instructions
1. There are five forms:
� Evaluation form 1: for new approaches to adjuvant therapy or
new potentially curative therapies
Hyper mature data from studies that were un-blinded after
compelling early results with subsequent access to the superior
arm are contaminated, subsequently late intention to treat
(ITT) follow-up data are not evaluable.
� Evaluation form 2a: for therapies that are not likely to be cura-
tive with primary end point of OS with separate sheets for:
• IF median OS with the standard treatment is �12 months
• IF median OS with the standard treatment >12 months,
�24 months
• IF median OS with the standard treatment >24 months
� Evaluation form 2b: for therapies that are not likely to be cura-
tive with primary end point PFS with separate sheets for:
• IF median PFS with standard treatment �6 months
• IF median PFS with standard treatment >6 months
� Evaluation form 2c: for therapies that are not likely to be cura-
tive with primary end point other than OS or PFS or equiva-
lence (non-inferiority) studies.
� Evaluation form 3: for single-arm studies in ‘orphan diseases’
and for diseases with ‘high unmet need’ when primary out-
come is PFS or ORR.

 2. The highest grade of the ESMO-MCBS is A in the curative
setting and this is restricted to new curative treatments; for
non-curative indications 5 is the highest possible grade, yet suf-
ficient to trigger rapid consideration for reimbursement is B
and 4.
3. Analysis of phase III trials
• Adequately powered studies showing statistically significant
improvement in the primary outcome (defined by P <0.050)
• Careful analyses ‘control arm’ and identification of end points.
• Check subgroup analysis.
a. Studies with pre-planned subgroup analyses with a maximum
of three subgroups can be graded (provided there is adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons).
b. When statistically significant results are reported for any sub-
group, then each of these should be graded separately.
c. Subgroups not showing statistically significant results are not
graded.
d. Except for studies that incorporate collection of tissue samples
to enable re-stratification based on new genetic or other bio-
markers, findings from un-planned (post hoc) subgroup ana-
lysis cannot be graded and they can only be used as
foundation for hypothesis generation.
4. More than one outcome may be applicable
• The statistical significance of secondary outcomes are deter-
mined by the same criteria as for primary outcomes ie (defined
by P <0.050)
5. For a required HR, not the point estimate but the lower limit
of 95% CI estimated based on the observed HR in the trial
should encompass the required HR
Example: for threshold set at HR �0.65, it is the lower limit of the
95% CI which has to be �0.65
6. In the studies with a primary outcome of OS in the non-
curative setting check for
• Survival gain >10% at 2, 3 or 5 years on Kaplan Meyer plots
• Long term survival with plateau in Kaplan Meyer plots at 5
or 7 years
• Reduced toxicity
• Improvement in quality of life
• Report final adjusted grade taken into account toxicity, and
QoL when relevant
7. In studies with a primary outcome of PFS in the non-curative
setting check for:
• Indicators of toxicity
• Survival data also available
• Early termination with crossover based on planned interim
survival analysis
• Greater than 10% gain in PFA at 2 or 3 years (tail of curve)
• Global QoL advantage using validated scale if applicable
• Report final adjusted grade taken into account toxicity, sur-
vival advantage and QoL when applicable
