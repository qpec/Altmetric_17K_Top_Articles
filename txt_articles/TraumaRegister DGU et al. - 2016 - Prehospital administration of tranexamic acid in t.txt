Abstract
Background: Evidence on prehospital administration of the antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid (TXA) in civilian trauma
populations is scarce. The aim was to study whether prehospital TXA use in trauma patients was associated with
improved outcomes.
Methods: The prehospital database of the ADAC (General German Automobile Club) Air Rescue Service was linked
with the TraumaRegister of the German Trauma Society to reidentify patients documented in both registries.
Primarily admitted trauma patients (2012 until 2014) who were treated with TXA during the prehospital phase
were matched with patients who had not received prehospital TXA, applying propensity score-based matching.
Results: The matching yielded two identical cohorts (n = 258 in each group), since there were no significant
differences in demographics or injury characteristics (mean Injury Severity Score 24 ± 14 [TXA] vs. 24 ± 16 [control];
p = 0.46). The majority had sustained blunt injury (90.3 % vs. 93.0 %; p = 0.34). There were no differences with
respect to prehospital therapy, including rates of intubation, chest tube insertion or both administration of i.v. fluids
and catecholamines. During ER treatment, the TXA cohort received fewer numbers of red blood cells and plasma
units, but without reaching statistical significance. Incidences of organ failure, sepsis or thromboembolism showed no
significant differences as well, although data were incomplete for these parameters. Early mortality was significantly
lower in the TXA group (e.g., 24-h mortality 5.8 % [TXA] vs. 12.4 % [control]; p = 0.01), and mean time to death was
8.8 ± 13.4 days vs. 3.6 ± 4.9 days, respectively (p = 0.001). Overall hospital mortality was similar in both groups (14.7 % vs.
16.3 %; p = 0.72). The most pronounced mortality difference was observed in patients with a high propensity score,
reflecting severe injury load.
Conclusions: This is the first civilian study, to our knowledge, in which the effect of prehospital TXA use in trauma
patients has been examined. TXA was associated with prolonged time to death and significantly improved early
survival. Until further evidence emerges, the results of this study support the use of TXA during prehospital treatment
of severely injured patients.

Background
Exsanguination remains the leading cause of early mor-
tality in trauma patients [1] and recent research has elu-
cidated the role of acute trauma-associated coagulopathy
in aggravating haemorrhage [2–4]. Resuscitation strat-
egies for severely injured patients with massive blood
loss include several key components, such as transfusion
of
blood
components
to
reestablish
perfusion
and
coagulation function [5]. Furthermore, several commer-
cially available haemostatic agents are commonly applied
as adjuncts to support coagulation [6]. Since clot deg-
radation by early hyperfibrinolysis has been reported to
play a major role in traumatic coagulopathy and massive
bleeding, recent clinical research has been focused on
the antifibrinolytic substance tranexamic acid (TXA) [7].
However, only one large randomised controlled trial—
Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant
Haemorrhage 2 (CRASH-2)—has examined the effect of

 in-hospital TXA administration in trauma, but the results
have been discussed controversially due to several weak-
nesses of the trial, such as that the majority of patients
were enrolled in developing countries [8, 9]. Altogether,
evidence on prehospital TXA use in trauma, especially
from European countries, is scarce. Accordingly, existing
guidelines either provide no statement or make only a
weak recommendation to consider en route administration
of TXA [10]. However, since no other drug is approved for
coagulation support during prehospital treatment, the aim
of the present study was to assess whether prehospital
intravenous (i.v.) administration of TXA in trauma patients
is associated with improved outcomes.
Methods
General German Automobile Club Air Rescue Service
database
The General German Automobile Club (ADAC) Air
Rescue Service operates 35 air ambulance helicopters
throughout Germany and is therefore the largest national
provider of Air Rescue Services. For each rescue mission
and each patient, information on the prehospital course
and treatment is documented including air rescue-specific
parameters [11]. The severity of illness and/or injury is
assessed by applying the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics
(NACA)
score,
ranging
from
I
(minor
disturbance/injury) to VII (death) [12]. As the equipment
for each helicopter regarding medication is regulated
according to its respective local policies, TXA has been
provided by 20 of the 35 Air Rescue helicopters during
the 3-year study period. Patients were treated with TXA at
the discretion of the emergency physician.
TraumaRegister DGU®
The TraumaRegister DGU® (TR-DGU) of the German
Trauma Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie,
DGU) was founded in 1993 [13]. The aim of this multicen-
tre database is an anonymous and standardized documen-
tation of severely injured patients. Data are collected
prospectively in four consecutive time phases from
the site of the accident until discharge from the hos-
pital: (A) prehospital phase, (B) emergency room (ER)
and initial surgery, (C) intensive care unit (ICU) and
(D) discharge. The documentation includes detailed infor-
mation on demographics, injury patterns, comorbidities,
pre- and in-hospital management, course on the ICU,
relevant laboratory findings including data on transfu-
sions, and outcomes of each individual.
The participating hospitals are located primarily in
Germany (90 %), but a rising number of hospitals in
other countries contribute data as well (e.g., Austria,
Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Switzerland).
Currently, approximately 25,000 cases per year from
more than 600 hospitals are entered into the database.
The documentation comprises detailed information in-
cluding standardized scoring systems (e.g., the Injury
Severity Score [ISS]) [14]. All injuries are coded using
the Abbreviated Injury Scale [15]. Organ failure was
assessed using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
score [16]. Sepsis was defined according to the Bone cri-
teria, which are close to those of the American College
of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine con-
sensus conference definition [17]. The TR-DGU docu-
ments the prothrombin time as prothrombin time index
(expressed as a percentage of normal; also commonly
referred to as Quick’s test), where a value of <70 % corre-
sponds to an international normalized ratio >1.3 [3, 18].
Study population
Due to data security and confidentiality, both databases
provide anonymized data; thus, there was no informa-
tion available about whether individual patients were in-
cluded in these two independent databases in parallel.
As the ADAC Air Rescue Service registry is limited to
the prehospital setting without providing information on
the patient’s in-hospital course, and since the TR-DGU
does not document the prehospital administration of
TXA, we linked the data to reidentify patients docu-
mented in both registries. Patient records from both data-
bases collected between 1 January 2012 and 31 December
2014 were considered for the present study (Fig. 1).
Patients were included in this study according to the
following criteria:
1. ADAC Air Rescue Service database:
a. Primarily admitted trauma patient
b. Critical injury, defined as preclinically assessed
NACA IV (potentially life-threatening), NACA V
(acute danger) or NACA VI (respiratory and/or
cardiac arrest)
c. Admission to a trauma centre participating in the
TR-DGU
2. TR-DGU database:
a. Primary admission
b. Treatment in a German trauma centre (i.e.,
exclusion of trauma centres from other countries)
Data were linked using the parameters age, sex, date
and time of injury, and trauma centre (Fig. 1). Thus, a
total of 5765 patients were identified as documented in
both databases, of whom 258 patients had received i.v.
administration of TXA before ER arrival. These 5765
patients were eligible for propensity score-based matched-
pairs analysis. A multivariable analysis was conducted
using a logistic regression model with prehospital admin-
istration of TXA as a dependent variable (Table 1). The
resulting independent predictors were applied to calculate

 a propensity of receiving prehospital TXA. Each of the
258 TXA patients was matched with 1 of the 5507 control
patients according to the propensity of receiving TXA; for
example, a patient with a propensity of 7 % was matched
with another patient with a 7 % propensity. Matching was
performed blinded to outcome.
Study approval
The medical authorities of the ADAC Air Rescue Service
and the scientific committee of the TR-DGU approved the
design and publication of this study. This study and publi-
cation are in line with the publication guidelines of the
TraumaRegisterDGU® and registered as TR-DGU project
ID 2015-023. The present study was also approved by the
ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of
Witten/Herdecke (Alfred-Herrhausen-Strasse 50, 58448
Witten, Germany; register number 85/2015).
Statistical analysis
Data were compared between groups using the Mann-
Whitney U test for continuous variables and Fisher’s
exact test for categorical variables, if not indicated
otherwise. For comparison of the Kaplan-Meier survival
curves, the Mantel-Cox log-rank test was applied. Data
are presented as mean with standard deviation (±SD) for
continuous variables and as percentages for incidence
rates. We applied a significance level p < 0.05 to all stat-
istical tests. Statistical analysis was performed using
standard statistical software (SPSS version 18.0 software;
SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Among the 5765 patients with complete datasets, 258
pairs with corresponding propensity of TXA administra-
tion were identified. As intended, the matching yielded

 two similar cohorts, as there were no significant dif-
ferences in demographic data, injury characteristics or
prehospital course between treatment groups (Table 2).
Patients were predominantly male, and their average ages
by group were 43 ± 19 years (TXA group) vs. 41 ± 18 years
(control group) (p = 0.48). The mean ISSs for the TXA
and control groups were 24 ± 14 and 24 ± 16, respectively
(p = 0.46), and the majority had sustained a blunt injury
(90.3 % vs. 93.0 %, respectively; p = 0.34). There were also
no differences with respect to injury pattern, prehospital
vital signs and prehospital therapy, including rates of in-
tubation, chest tube insertion, cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion
and
administration
of
both
i.v.
fluids
and
catecholamines. Table 3 summarizes the vital signs and la-
boratory values upon ER admission, showing no signifi-
cant differences as well. Before ICU admission, the TXA
cohort received fewer numbers of packed red blood cells
(pRBC) and plasma units, but without reaching statistical
significance. Further haemostatic agents were applied in
similar
frequencies
as
well,
including
fibrinogen
concentrate.
The outcome parameters (Table 4) showed no differences
with respect to incidence of multiple organ failure, sepsis or
thromboembolism, although for these parameters data
were not documented for the complete study population.
Early mortality was significantly lower in the TXA group
(e.g., 24-h mortality 5.8 % [TXA] vs. 12.4 % [control];
p = 0.01), and mean time to death was 8.8 ± 13.4 days
(TXA) vs. 3.6 ± 4.9 days (control) (p = 0.001). Overall
hospital mortality was similar in both groups (14.7 %
vs. 16.3 %; p = 0.72). Correspondingly, these mortality
rates are reflected in the survival curves, since for the ini-
tial days following ER arrival TXA patients tended to have
higher survival (Fig. 2). The log-rank test yielded no
significant differences for these Kaplan-Meier plots
(p = 0.47).

 In a subgroup analysis, Fig. 3 illustrates that the most
pronounced decrease in mortality from TXA could be
observed in those patients with a high propensity score,
with the score indicating a more complicated prehospital
course and higher injury severity as reflected by the fac-
tors derived from multivariate analysis shown in Table 1.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first civilian study to
examine the effect of prehospital TXA use in trauma
patients. Our propensity score-based matched-pairs ana-
lysis of a large population of trauma patients resulted in
two identical groups, and the prehospital i.v. administra-
tion of TXA was associated with a significantly lower
early mortality (up to 24 h) and increased time to death.
Particularly those patients appeared to benefit most from
TXA who had a high propensity score reflecting severe
injury load. The improvement of early outcome may
suggest benefits of TXA on haemostatic resuscitation,
since previous investigations have indicated that the ma-
jority of deaths due to traumatic bleeding occur in the
first few hours following trauma [19]. In this context,
the recent Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and
Plasma Ratios trial showed that exsanguination was the
predominant cause of death within the first 24 h [5].
However, although the amount of blood components
was lower in the TXA group, the difference was not sig-
nificant. Surprisingly, only about 25 % in both groups re-
quired any transfusion at all. The lower mortality rates
may also be explained by the anti-inflammatory effects
of TXA [20], although further studies are required to
elucidate
this
potential
additional
benefit.
Multiple
randomised controlled trials from elective surgery (e.g.,
orthopaedic, cardiovascular) have shown beneficial ef-
fects of TXA with respect to reduced perioperative
blood loss [21]. Still, to date, CRASH-2 represents the
only randomised controlled trial on TXA in trauma [8].
The researchers in that study recruited 20,211 trauma
patients following hospital admission and showed that
treatment with TXA significantly reduced all-cause mor-
tality vs. placebo (14.5 % vs. 16.0 %). Death caused by
haemorrhage was reduced as well (4.9 % vs. 5.7 %),

 without increasing thromboembolic events. The authors
of a post hoc analysis observed beneficial effects, especially
when TXA was given early (within 1 h after trauma), and
delayed administration was even linked with worse
outcomes [9]. However, several weaknesses and gaps of
CRASH-2 have been discussed controversially [22]. First,
data on laboratory values, on injury severity or on sub-
types of transfused blood components (pRBC, fresh frozen
plasma) were not reported. Second, the majority of pa-
tients were enrolled in low-income or developing coun-
tries, causing hesitancy to translate the findings to mature
trauma systems. Retrospective military studies (Military
Application of Tranexamic Acid in Trauma Emergency
Resuscitation [MATTERs]) from a combat treatment
facility in southern Afghanistan confirmed the benefits of
TXA in battle casualties [23, 24]. The evidence from de-
veloped countries remains equivocal. In a single-centre
retrospective analysis done in Miami, FL, USA, TXA was
administered at a median of 97 minutes following ER ad-
mission to 150 patients deemed to be at high risk for
haemorrhagic death. Propensity score-based matching
demonstrated higher mortality in the TXA group [25]. In
another single-centre study, done in London, UK, the ma-
jority of patients (n = 160) received TXA in the ER during
the adoption phase of a major haemorrhage protocol [26].
However, this cohort was also more severely injured and
more coagulopathic than non-TXA patients, since TXA
was administered when critical injury or signs of haemor-
rhagic shock were present. Still, multivariate adjustments
suggested potential benefits in severely injured shock pa-
tients. Furthermore, Moore et al. demonstrated that only a

TXA tranexamic acid

 minority of severely injured patients presented with hyper-
fibrinolysis upon admission and a majority even displayed
shut-down of fibrinolysis, raising concerns that TXA
might cause complications in these patients [7]. Although
CRASH-2 showed no difference with respect to vascular
occlusive events, the authors admitted that, owing to trial
design, they “might have underreported the frequency of
these events” [8]. In the MATTERs study, TXA was associ-
ated with higher rates of thromboembolic events [23]. In
our study, we found no difference, but data were incom-
plete. However, longer ICU stay and longer hospital stay in
our TXA group might indicate a more complicated course.
The decision of several ADAC air rescue bases against
TXA use reflects both the ongoing controversy regard-
ing TXA and the uncertainty with applying a substance
that has such weak evidence in the prehospital phase. In
a recent review, Ausset et al. summarized that the evi-
dence for the prehospital use of TXA regarding trauma
populations is lacking [27]. Several groups have simply
published their experience with the feasibility and fre-
quency of prehospital TXA administration, but without
reporting any outcome data [28–31].
Several
limitations
of
the
present
study
must be
addressed. First, laboratory parameters with respect to
hyperfibrinolysis or inflammation (e.g., D-dimers, throm-
boelastometry, interleukin-6) are not available in the data-
bases. Second, the documentation of data was incomplete
and inconsistent with respect to morbidity (organ failure,
sepsis, thromboembolism). Furthermore, as the two data-
bases were merged, only 5801 of 17,584 patients in the
ADAC Air Rescue Service database could be assigned to a
case in the TR-DGU. The data are further limited because
exact timing of prehospital TXA administration and dos-
ages (TXA or fibrinogen concentrate) have not been docu-
mented. Personal correspondence with all participating Air
Rescue bases revealed that the majority apply a single dose
of 1 g of TXA during prehospital treatment. Patients were
treated with TXA at the discretion of the emergency phys-
ician, not according to a standardized algorithm, represent-
ing another major weakness. In this context, base excess
and overall transfusion rates were moderate, which might
indicate that TXA was also administered to noncoagulo-
pathic patients or patients without signs of active bleeding.
Also, the subtype of colloid infusion is not specified in the
databases. A further limitation is that the cause of death
(e.g., bleeding, brain death) is not documented in the TR-
DGU; therefore, we cannot discern whether TXA was as-
sociated with reduced mortality due to haemorrhage.
Nevertheless, the present analysis represents the lar-
gest civilian study on prehospital TXA supplementation
in trauma patients. The current European guidelines for
management of bleeding and coagulopathy following
major trauma recommend considering the administra-
tion of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital.
Since this is based on very limited evidence and extrapo-
lated from the CRASH-2 trial, the authors graded this as a
“very weak recommendation” (grade 2C) [10]. However,
until further evidence emerges from ongoing prospective
randomised controlled trials [32, 33], considering the
existing literature on in-hospital administration, the re-
sults of the present study support the prehospital use of
TXA in those trauma patients with severe injury with con-
firmed or suspected haemorrhagic shock.
Conclusions
In the present study of trauma patients, prehospital use of
TXA was associated with prolonged time to death and sig-
nificantly improved early survival, suggesting benefits of
TXA on haemostatic resuscitation. Until further evidence
emerges, the results support the use of TXA during pre-
hospital treatment of severely injured patients.
Key messages
� Evidence from mature trauma systems on
prehospital administration of TXA in civilian
populations is not available.
� Prehospital use of TXA was associated with
significantly longer time to death and significantly
lower mortality rates at 6, 12 and 24 h.
� The most pronounced difference in mortality could
be observed in those patients with a high propensity
score reflecting severe injury load.
� The present data support the current recommendation
to consider the first dose of TXA en route to
the hospital.
