Abstract
In 2015, 2409 active candidates aged 12 years or older were added to the
lung transplant waiting list; 2072 transplants were performed, the most of
any year.
The median waiting time for candidates listed in 2015 was 3.4
months; the shortest waiting time was for diagnosis group D. Despite the
highest recorded transplant rate of 157 per 100 waitlist years, waitlist mortality
continued a steady decade-long rise to a high of 16.5 deaths per 100 waitlist
years.
Measures of short- and long-term survival showed no trend toward
improved overall survival in the past 5 years, except that 6-month death rates
decreased from 9.4% in 2005 to 7.9% in 2014.
At 5 years posttransplant,
55.5% of recipients remained alive. In 2015, 23 new child (ages 0-11 years)
candidates were added to the list; 17 transplants were performed. Incidence of
death was 6.1% at 6 months and 8.2% at 1 year for transplants in 2013-2014.
Important policy changes will affect access to transplant. In February 2015,
OPTN implemented a comprehensive revision of the lung allocation score to
better reflect mortality risk. Broader geographic sharing of donor lungs for
1
  
 
 
 
 
pediatric candidates and allowance for selected transplants across blood types
for candidates aged younger than 2 years have been approved and are expected
to improve pediatric access to transplant. The impact of these changes on lung
transplant trends will be observed in the coming years.
Keywords: End-stage lung disease; lung allocation score, lung transplant,
organ allocation, transplant outcomes.

Introduction
Lung transplant remains an important and increasingly used option for the treatment of
patients who have end-stage lung diseases. Lungs are allocated to US transplant candidates
aged younger than 12 years based on age, geography, ABO blood type and priority status.
For candidates aged 12 years or older, allocation is based on age, geography, blood type
(ABO) compatibility, the lung allocation score (LAS), and, if necessary, waiting time.
Implemented in 2005, the LAS calculation largely reflects the risk of waitlist mortality
while avoiding transplants in candidates with poor likelihood of posttransplant survival.
The LAS applies to adolescent (aged 12-17 years) and adult (aged 18 years or older)
candidates.
As part of the development of the LAS system, pulmonary diagnoses for
candidates aged 12 years or older were categorized into four main groups based on survival
probability and pathophysiology of the underlying disease. The four groups are: group
A, obstructive lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive lung disease/emphysema); group B,
pulmonary vascular disease (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension); group C,
cystic fibrosis and immunodeficiency disorders; and group D, restrictive lung disease (e.g.,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).
The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) implemented the first
comprehensive revision of the LAS calculation in February 2015. This revision includes
modifications to the variables used in the LAS calculation and to the relative weight of the
variables used to predict risk of death in the next year without transplant and in the first
year posttransplant. In this chapter, we refer to the revised LAS as the LAS-R. We caution
readers about comparing the LAS-R with the LAS in the figures. Given the differences in
how these scores are calculated, they may not be comparable. In time, the full impact of the
LAS-R on waitlist and posttransplant outcomes will be evident. In 2016, OPTN approved
policies to improve access to lung transplant for pediatric lung transplant candidates. These
include broader geographic sharing of donor lungs to pediatric candidates aged younger
than18 years. Also, candidates who were listed before age 2 can be considered for donor
lungs of any blood type, because infants do not have sensitivity to ”incompatible” blood
types. The pediatric policies have been approved but are not yet implemented.
In this report, all lung transplant candidates and recipients aged 12 years or older are
included under Adult Lung Transplant, and those aged 0 to 11 years are included under
Lung Transplant in Children. Heart-lung patients are included in all tabulations.

Waiting List
2.1.1
Characteristics of US candidates waiting for a lung transplant
In 2015, lung transplant waitlist trends were comparable to trends in prior years, with 2409
candidates added to the waiting list (Figure LU 1). By the end of the year, 1519 candidates
were waiting for a lung transplant (Figure LU 2), 1459 for lung-only transplant and only 50
for heart-lung transplant (Table LU 1). Distinct trends attributable to implementation of
the LAS also persisted. Lung transplant candidates were listed at increasingly older ages,
were more likely to have restrictive lung disease, and were likely sicker at listing.
Approximately 75% of candidates on the waiting list were aged 50 years or older in 2015
(Figure LU 3). Those aged 50 to 64 years continued to make up the largest proportion of
the waiting list, at 49.0%. Candidates aged 60 years or older made up higher proportions
of the waiting list every year in the past decade, and they represented 25.7% of the list in
2015. With this trend comes the correlate decline in proportions of younger candidates.
Candidates aged 35 to 49 years made up 13.7%, 18 to 34 years 10.3 %, and 12 to 17 years
1.4% of the waiting list.
The proportion of candidates with restrictive lung disease (diagnosis group D) increased
every year from 2005-2014, then stabilized in 2015 at 49.6% of the list (Figure LU 5).
Candidates from the other three diagnostic groups made up smaller proportions of the
waiting list, and proportions have been mostly stable over the past 5 years: group A,
33.3%; group B, 5.0%; and group C, 12.2%.
Whether the trend toward listing sicker candidates for transplant has stabilized is
unclear. Snapshots of lung transplant recipients in 2010 and 2015 show similar findings: 8%
to 9% were supported by a ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
at the time of transplant (Table LU 4). The LAS distribution on the waiting list rose
steadily toward higher scores from LAS implementation in 2005 to 2014; median LAS at
the time of transplant was 36.7 in 2005 and 44.4 in 2014 (Figure LU 38). The lower median
LAS-R of 41.6 in 2015 cannot be compared with the LAS in years prior because the LAS-
R calculation differs from the LAS calculation. The score distribution among candidates
showed a similar pattern of increases; the LAS was 50-100 for 31.6% of candidates in 2014,
compared with 5.7% in 2005 (Figure LU 7). In 2015, the LAS-R was 50-100 for 27.6% of
candidates. Again, the distribution of the LAS-R in 2015 cannot be compared with the
distribution of the LAS in prior years.
2.1.2
Outcome of US candidates listed for lung transplant
In 2015, we saw the highest lung transplant rate ever in the US, at 157 per 100 waitlist years
(Figure LU 10). Most candidates underwent transplant by 1 year after listing (Figure LU
15). For example, of candidates listed for transplant in 2014, 45.1% underwent transplant
by 3 months, 56.7% by 6 months, and 67.4% by 1 year (Figure LU 15). The overall median
waiting time to transplant for candidates listed in 2015 was 3.4 months, varying from
2.4 months for group D candidates to 4.9 months for group A candidates. Fewer than
half of the group B candidates listed in 2015 underwent transplant by year end, so the
3
  
 
 
 
 
median waiting time was not observed, but the median among group B candidates listed
in 2014 was 7.7 months. (Figure LU 14). Transplant rates were highest for candidates in
diagnosis group D, at 224.2 per 100 active waitlist years, continuing a trend in evidence
since implementation of the LAS (Figure LU 10); these candidates also had the highest
median LAS compared with other diagnosis groups during the LAS era. Candidates in
group B had the lowest transplant rate, at 89.3 per 100 active waitlist years (Figure LU
10). Both trends may change in coming years with implementation of the LAS-R; group B
candidates had the highest median LAS-R at transplant in 2015 (Figure LU 39). Height
correlates with access to transplant up to 175 cm, with the shortest candidates (< 160 cm)
consistently experiencing the lowest transplant rates (Figure LU 12). Geography, according
to donation service area (DSA), continued to affect access to transplant (Figure LU 16).
Percentages of candidates who underwent transplant varied from 53.0% to 80.9% by DSA
(Figure LU 16).
Despite the highest ever transplant rates in 2015, the 2014-2015 mortality rate of 16.5
deaths per 100 waitlist years was also the highest, compared with 8.6 in 2004-2005 (Figure
LU 18). This increase is likely due to the increasingly sick candidate pool, as described.
Waitlist mortality rates in 2014-2015 remained highest for candidates aged 12 to 17 years,
at 40.0 deaths per 100 waitlist years; rates for candidates aged 18 to 34 and 65 years or
older were similar, at 19.0 and 20.0 deaths per 100 waitlist years (Figure LU 17). This
is likely due to small numbers of appropriately sized donors for candidates in this age
group, who tend to be of smaller stature. Despite their preferential access to transplant,
candidates from diagnosis group D continued to have the highest waitlist morality rate, at
26.6 deaths per 100 waitlist years (Figure LU 20). The waitlist mortality rate was 174.0
per 100 waitlist years for candidates with LAS 50 or higher, well above the 16.3 deaths per
100 waitlist years for candidates with LAS 40 to less than 50 (Figure LU 21).
2.2
Transplant
2.2.1
Characteristics of US lung transplant recipients
In 2015, 2072 total lung transplants were performed, including adult, pediatric, and multi-
organ transplant recipients, the most ever in a single year since lung transplants have been
performed (Figure LU 31). The preferred procedure remained bilateral lung transplant,
which constituted a stable proportion of 68.0% to 71.2% of transplants over the past 5
years (Figure LU 31).
In 2015, transplant trends attributable to implementation of the LAS persisted. Lung
transplant recipients were increasingly older, were more likely to be men, were more likely
to have restrictive lung disease, and were likely sicker at transplant (Table LU 4).
Of all US lung recipients in 2015, including children, 47.0% were aged 50 to 64 years,
28.7% 65 years or older, 12.2% 35 to 49 years, and 10.0% 18 to 34 years. Pediatric lung
transplants remained an extremely small proportion of lung transplants; recipients aged
younger than 18 years made up 2.1% of all transplants in 2015 (computed from counts in
Figure LU 32). The proportion of female lung transplant recipients decreased since LAS
implementation and remained stable in 2015 at 41% of transplants (Figure LU 33), a trend
likely explained by the lower prevalence of female candidates with the highest LAS (data
4
  
 
 
 
 
not shown). The proportion of lung transplant recipients from group D was consistently
more than 50% over the past 5 years, and 58% in 2015 (computed from counts in Figure
LU 35). As mentioned, it is unclear whether the trend toward sicker candidates undergoing
transplant observed until 2014 continued in 2015 (Figure LU 36).
2.2.2
Outcomes of US lung transplant recipients
More lung transplant recipients, 12,111, were alive in 2015 than ever before; 7967 were
aged 50 years or older, 3739 18 to 49 years, and 405 younger than 18 years at the time of
transplant (Figure LU 54). For recipients aged 12 years or older who underwent transplant
in 2008-2010, posttransplant survival was 92.9% at 3 months, 84.6% at 1 year, 67.8% at
3 years, and 55.5% at 5 years. Survival was lowest for recipients aged 65 years or older
and 12 to 17 years (Figure LU 47), and those with LAS 60 or higher (Figure LU 49). In
this unadjusted analysis, bilateral lung transplant appeared to confer a survival advantage
(Figure LU 50). The most common documented cause of death was infection at every
time point up to 5 years posttransplant (Figure LU 57, Figure LU 58). The incidence of
acute rejection 1 year posttransplant has remained stable at 16.6% to 18.6% since 2009
(Figure LU 55).
Chronic rejection or bronchiolitis obliterans was reported in 7.3% of
recipients by 1 year and in 43.7% by 5 years posttransplant (computed from Table LU
6). The most prevalent complications of lung transplant at 5 years were diabetes (27.9%),
malignancy (22.9%), and chronic kidney disease (14.0% with creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, 2.4%
on maintenance dialysis, 0.9% requiring renal transplant).
Measures of short- and long-term survival showed no trend toward improved overall
survival in the past 5 years, except that 6-month death rates decreased from 9.4% in 2005
to 7.9% in 2014 (Figure LU 53). This plateau in survival gains may be due to transplants
in increasingly sicker candidates, who received preferential access to transplant under the
LAS system. The impact of the LAS-R on survival remains to be seen.

Lung Transplant in Children
3.1
Waiting List
In 2015, 23 new child (ages 0-11 years) candidates were added to the lung transplant
waiting list, and all but two were active at the time of listing (Figure LU 59). The number
of prevalent child candidates (i.e., on the waiting list on December 31 of a given year)
steadily decreased from a peak of 127 in 2004 to 20 in 2015 (Figure LU 60). The largest
age group of child candidates waiting during 2015 was 6 to 11 years; these candidates
made up 57.5% of the waiting list, followed by candidates aged 1 to 5 years at 30.0% and
younger than 1 year at 12.5% (Figure LU 61). Most child lung candidates were white
(65.0%), followed by Hispanic (20.0%) and black and Asian (both 7.5%, Figure LU 62).
Of child lung candidates in 2015, 65.0% were on the waiting list for less than 6 months,
17.5% for 6 months to less than 1 year, 12.5% for 1 to less than 2 years, and 5.0% for 2
or more years (Figure LU 64). Snapshots of child lung candidates on December 31, 2005,
and December 31, 2015, revealed changes in the waiting list. Seventy-one candidates who
were listed before their twelfth birthdays were waiting at year-end 2005, but only 17 at
5
  
 
 
 
 
year-end 2015. Regarding age distribution, the proportion of children aged younger than
1 year increased from none in 2005 to 1 (5.9%) in 2015 (Table LU 7). At year-end 2015,
23.6% of candidates were on the waiting list for 60 days or less, compared with 9.8% in
2005. In 2015, all candidates were listed for lung-only transplant, compared with 84.5% in
2005.
Of 32 patients removed from the waiting list in 2015, 17 (53.1%) were removed due
to undergoing transplant, 8 (25.0%) due to death, 2 (6.3%) due to improved condition,
and 2 (6.3%) due to being too sick to undergo transplant (Table LU 9). Regarding 3-year
outcomes for child lung transplant candidates listed in 2012, 72.0% underwent deceased
donor transplant, 20.0% died waiting, and 8.0% were removed from the list for reasons
other than transplant or death (Figure LU 65). The overall child lung transplant rate
peaked in 2013 at 170.1 per 100 waitlist years, and declined in 2015 to 121.8 (Figure LU
66). Pretransplant mortality increased in 2014-2015 to 36.5 deaths per 100 waitlist years
for all candidates aged 0 to 11 years (Figure LU 67). Rates were higher for candidates aged
younger than 6 years than for those aged 6 to 11 years, 49.4 versus 29.0 per 100 waitlist
years.
3.2
Transplant
In 2015, a total of 17 lung transplants were performed in recipients aged 0 to 11 years, 1 in
a recipient aged younger than 1 year, 6 in recipients aged 1 to 5 years, and 10 in recipients
aged 6 to 11 years (Figure LU 68). Eight out of 68 centers were performing pediatric-
only (recipients aged 0-17 years) lung transplants in 2015, compared with 49 performing
adult-only transplants (Figure LU 69). In 2012-2015, the proportion of child transplant
recipients aged 1 to 5 years was larger than in 2002-2005, and there were more Hispanic
recipients, more pulmonary fibrosis and other vascular diagnoses, and fewer cystic fibrosis
diagnoses (Table LU 10). More recipients in 2012-2015 were on a ventilator, ECMO, or
both at the time of transplant (42.3%) than in 2002-2005 (28.6%). The procedure of choice
was bilateral transplant, performed in all patients in 2012-2015.
3.2.1
Pediatric Immunosuppression and Outcomes
Substantial changes in immunosuppression occurred in lung transplantation compared with
a decade prior. In 2014-2015, the most common induction therapy was interleukin-2 recep-
tor antagonists, used in 43.9% of lung transplant recipients, followed by T-cell depleting
agents in 41.5%. No induction therapy was reported in 19.5% of recipients (Figure LU 70).
The initial immunosuppression agents used most commonly in 2014-2015 were tacrolimus
(97.6%, Figure LU 71), mycophenolate (97.6%, Figure LU 72), and steroids (100%, Figure
LU 73). Steroid use at 1 year posttransplant was reported in 100% of recipients (Figure
LU 73). The overall incidence of first acute rejection in the first posttransplant year was
14.5% for child lung transplant recipients in 2009-2014 (data not shown). The incidence
of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative
recipients who underwent transplant in 2003-2013 was 8.4% at 5 years posttransplant, com-
pared with 1.1% among EBV-positive recipients (Figure LU 75). Incidence of death was
6.1% at 6 months and 8.2% at 1 year for transplants in 2013-2014, 15.5% at 3 years for
6
  
 
 
 
 
transplants in 2011-2012, 32.6% at 5 years for transplants in 2009-2010, and 56.4% at 10
years for transplants in 2003-2004 (Figure LU 76). For children who underwent transplant
in 2003-2010, overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year patient survival was 80.7%, 63.2%, and 56.8%, re-
spectively (Figure LU 77). By age, patient survival rates were highest for recipients aged
6 to 11 years at all time points. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was associated with higher
survival rates compared with the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (Figure LU 78). At
1 year posttransplant, infection was the leading documented cause of death (4.7%, Figure
LU 79), and at 5 years, graft failure was the leading documented cause (12.4%), followed
by respiratory (7.3%), infection (5.1%) and cerebro/cardiovascular causes (4.4%, Figure
LU 80).
Among pediatric lung transplant recipients in 2011-2015, 57.9% were cytomegalovirus
(CMV) negative and 48.4% were EBV negative (Table LU 11).
The combination of a
CMV-positive donor and CMV-negative recipient occurred in 20.0% of transplants; this
combination for EBV occurred in 32.6% of transplants.
Complication rates in child lung transplant recipients increased with time posttrans-
plant, including bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (5.6% at 1 year to 38.1% at 5 years),
diabetes (2.8% to 7.1%), and malignancy (1.4% to 2.4%) (Table LU 12). For most surviv-
ing child lung transplant recipients (92.9%), functional status was reported as fully active
at 5 years posttransplant (Table LU 12).

Donor Registration Form and recipient serology on the OPTN Translant Recipient
Registration Form. There may be multiple fields per serology. Any evidence for a
positive serology is treated as positive for that serology. If all fields are unknown,
incomplete, or pending, the person is categorized as unknown for that serology;
otherwise, serology is assumed negative. CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-Barr
virus.

Table LU 12 Posttransplant events among lung transplant recipients aged
0-11 years. Posttransplant morbidities are recorded on the OPTN Pediatric Trans-
plant Recipient Follow-up Form and are included in the table if they were reported
anytime on or before 1-year and 5-year follow-up. One-year events are reported for
recipients in 2011-2014 and 5-year events for recipients in 2007-2010. Recipients of
more than one transplant are counted separately per transplant. For bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome (BOS), the most severe complication recorded for each trans-
plant is counted.
