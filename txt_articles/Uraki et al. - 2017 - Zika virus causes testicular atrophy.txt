Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has recently been found to cause fetal infection and
neonatal abnormalities, including microcephaly and neurological dysfunction. ZIKV persists in the semen months after
the acute viremic phase in humans. To further understand the consequences of ZIKV persistence in males, we infected
Ifnar1−/− mice via subcutaneous injection of a pathogenic but nonlethal ZIKV strain. ZIKV replication persists within the
testes even after clearance from the blood, with interstitial, testosterone-producing Leydig cells supporting virus re-
plication. We found high levels of viral RNA and antigen within the epididymal lumen, where sperm is stored, and
within surrounding epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, at 21 days post-infection, the testes of the ZIKV-infected mice were
significantlysmallercomparedtothose ofmock-infectedmice,indicatingprogressive testicularatrophy.ZIKV infection
caused a reduction in serum testosterone, suggesting that male fertility can be affected. Our findings have important
implications for nonvector-borne vertical transmission, as well as long-term potential reproductive deficiencies, in
ZIKV-infected males.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV), a positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the
Flavivirus family, has recently been associated with several unexpected
viral characteristics (1, 2). Although the main mode of ZIKV transmis-
sion is thought to be mosquito-mediated, as in other flaviviruses (3, 4),
ZIKV has additionally been found to use both maternal-fetal (5) and
sexual transmission (6) as a means of virus spread. Upon systemic
infection, virus replication can be detected in most organs; it has also
been found within several immune-privileged sites, including the brain
(7–18), placenta (19, 20), eyes (21), ovaries (22), and testes (23, 24). In
humans, persistent shedding of infectious virus has been found in
vaginal secretions (25) and semen (26–33) at times well past the acute
viremic and symptomatic stage of virus infection.
RESULTS
To understand the pathology associated with persistence of ZIKV
shedding within the testes, we used a murine infection model that leads
to high levels of systemic virus replication but does not ultimately result
in death (Ifnar1−/− mice challenged with ZIKVMEX). ZIKVMEX-infected
Ifnar1−/− mice demonstrated relatively mild body weight loss (Fig. 1A)
and developed peak viremia at 5 days post-infection (dpi) (Fig. 1B). We
were surprised to find that the ZIKVMEX strain, which has not yet been
published in mouse models, did not result in the lethal pathology of pre-
vious strains (22, 24). This allowed us to monitor the effects of ZIKV
infection of a pandemic strain at later time points of infection. Con-
sistent with these findings, mice sacrificed at 5 dpi were found to have
high levels of viral RNA (Fig. 1C) and infectious virus (Fig. 1D) within
the brain, testes, and blood. At 9 dpi, ZIKV was essentially cleared from
the bloodstream and was undetectable at 21 dpi (Fig. 1B).
To decipher the cellular tropism within the testes, we performed
immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a mouse monoclonal antibody
recognizing ZIKV NS1 antigen on testes and epididymis of ZIKVMEX-
infected Ifnar1−/− mice at 5 dpi. As shown in Fig. 2A, viral antigens
were mainly detected within the interstitial cells of the testes. These
regions are mainly composed of Leydig cells, a testicular cell type that
supports sperm production through the generation of testosterone
(34). We did not detect ZIKV within the seminiferous tubules in
ZIKVMEX-infected Ifnar1−/− mice at 5 dpi (Fig. 2A, a and b). Because
the epididymis is a highly convoluted tube that stores and carries
sperm (35), we also examined epididymal tissue of ZIKVMEX-infected
Ifnar1−/− mice for ZIKV antigen and found an overwhelming amount
of antigen associated with the sperm mass within the epididymal duct
lumen (Fig. 2A, d). In addition, we also observed several epithelial cells
lining the lumen that were positive for viral antigen (red arrows in Fig.
2A, d). In further support of ZIKV infection of testes, RNA analysis of
several cytokines indicated that an innate immune response was eli-
cited at 5 dpi (Fig. 2B).
Because IHC analysis suggested that Leydig cells, which are re-
sponsible for the supply of testosterone in testes, are targets for ZIKV
infection, we next determined the expression level of several genes re-
lated to testosterone synthesis (36) in ZIKVMEX-infected Ifnar1−/−
mice testes and found a consistent reduction among all genes tested as
compared in testes of ZIKVMEX-infected Ifnar1−/−mice (Fig. 2C). To con-
firm the susceptibility of Leydig cells to ZIKV, we infected isolated WT or
Ifnar1−/− Leydig cells with ZIKVMEX in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2D,
Leydig cells were able to productively support ZIKV replication, in-
dicating that Leydig cells could serve as a target and a reservoir cell type
for ZIKV within the testes.
Strikingly and rather unexpectedly, at 21 dpi, the testes of ZIKVMEX-
infected Ifnar1−/− mice were significantly reduced in size as compared
to those of uninfected mice (Fig. 3A), as determined by both weight
(Fig. 3B) and length (Fig. 3C). These findings suggest that persistent
ZIKV infection may lead to hypofertility. Because IHC, in vitro infec-
tion, and the decreased expression of genes related with testosterone
synthesis indicated Leydig cells as putative targets for ZIKV infection
within the testes, we next set to determine whether atrophy could occur
as the result of decreased testosterone levels in ZIKV-infected mice. We
examined levels of testosterone within serum from ZIKVMEX-infected
Ifnar1−/− mice at 5 and 21 dpi as compared with mock-infected Ifnar1−/−
mice and found a significant decrease in testosterone at 5 dpi with a
consistent reduction at 21 dpi (Fig. 3D). Notably, the testosterone levels

 at 5 dpi (six of seven mice) and at 21 dpi (two of seven mice) were
lower than the assay detection limit. These findings support other
data documenting ZIKV infection of Leydig cells (Fig. 2, A and D)
and suggest a potential mechanism for ZIKV-induced testicular at-
rophy. Viral RNA was noticeably higher in the epididymis com-
pared to testes (Fig. 3E), consistent with the copious amount of
viral antigen detected by IHC within the epididymal lumen (Fig.
2A). It remains conceivable that multiple cell types within the re-
productive tract produce virus, and the cell-free virus becomes
stored and concentrated in the epididymis before physical expul-
sion upon sexual activity.
DISCUSSION
Because humans with a fully functioning immune system also demon-
strate persistent ZIKV infection of the testes, these findings have major
implications for the fertility of men who have been exposed to ZIKV. It
will be important to monitor the fertility of men who have been infected
with ZIKV to better understand the impact in humans. We hypothesize
that active infection of Leydig cells within the interstitial regions of the
testes could cause decreased testosterone production, which ultimately
results in testicular atrophy. There is precedence for deleterious effects
on the production of testosterone and spermatogenesis caused by infec-
tion with mumps virus, which also targets Leydig cells as a site of rep-
lication within the testes (37–39). Alternatively, or in conjunction,
because inflammation is known to also lead to testicular atrophy, the
phenotype may be caused indirectly, or enhanced by, the immune re-
sponse to detection of ZIKV. Because all experiments were carried out
in Ifnar1−/− mice, our data rule out the possibility of type I interferon
signaling in testicular atrophy caused by ZIKV.
RNA analysis of testes samples of ZIKVMEX-infected Ifnar1−/− mice
found ZIKV to be present within the testes and epididymis at 5 dpi in all
mice and at 21 dpi in most mice. Because there is no detectable ZIKV
RNA within the blood of ZIKVMEX-infected Ifnar1−/− mice at 21 dpi (Fig.
1B), this observation recapitulates the human presentation of persistent
ZIKV replication within the testes. For ZIKVMEX-infected Ifnar1−/− mice
sacrificed at 35 dpi, when the epididymis was measured to be ZIKV-
negative, some of the testes were still reduced in size (15 to 45% shorter
in length) as compared to testes of mock-infected mice. Determination of
the possibility of recovery from testicular atrophy over greater time periods
is warranted. Recently, two other groups also reported that ZIKV can cause
long-term testicular damage; however, the infected cell types found in these
studies (spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, Sertoli cells, and/or peri-
tubularmyoidcells)differfromthosereportedhere, indicating that further

monitored for 15 days after virus infection. The values represent average scores of body weight compared with initial body weight ± SD from four mice. (B) Blood samples
were collected at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 21 dpi, and the virus loads were examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Three wild-type (WT)
and Ifnar1−/− mice were infected subcutaneously with 105 PFU of ZIKVMEX. Multiple organs were collected from mice (n = 3) after challenge on day 5 and subjected to virus
loads by qRT-PCR (C) and by plaque assays in Vero cells (D). The results are expressed as the mean titers. The detection limit of plaque assays is 1.8 log10 PFU/g.

 studies are required to examine the temporal and molecular details of
ZIKV tropism within the reproductive tract (40, 41). In addition, further
work is necessary to assess the relative contributions of the innate im-
mune response and/or testosterone reduction in ZIKV-induced testicular
atrophy. Regardless, the hypofertility implications of testicular atrophy call
for an urgent global need to develop vaccines and antiviral therapeutics.

 Plaque assays
Vero cells were seeded in 12-well plates 24 hours before infection.
Serial-diluted ZIKV was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Then, cells were overlaid with 2% agarose and 2× medium. At 3 to
4 dpi, cells were fixed by 10% formalin and stained with 0.005% amido
black, and PFU were counted.
Mouse experiments
Four- to six-week-old Ifnar1−/− (C57BL/6 background) and WT C57BL/6
mice were analyzed in this study. Mice were bred in a specific pathogen–
free facility at Yale University or purchased from The Jackson Laboratory
(WT C57BL/6). Mice were inoculated with ZIKV via subcutaneous
injection (footpad; a volume of 50 ml) with 105 PFU of ZIKV. Survivals
and weights were monitored every day up to 15 dpi. Mice exhibiting a
weight loss of >20% of initial body weight or neurological disease were
euthanized. To examine the viremia, we collected blood samples at 1, 3,
5, 7, 9, and 21 dpi and performed real-time PCR. To assess virus growth
or host responses in organs, we euthanized three mice at 5 or 21 dpi,
and their organs were collected, homogenized with DMEM with 10%
FCS or TRIzol, and titrated using plaque assays or real-time PCR.
RNA extraction, real-time PCR, and PCR
The homogenized organ and blood samples from ZIKV-infected mice
were transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube to which chloroform was
added. The tubes were vortexed well and centrifuged for 10 min at
14,000 rpm at 4°C. The aqueous layers were mixed with 100% ethanol
and then subjected to RNA extraction using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was
reverse-transcribed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expressions of samples were
queried using iQ SYBR Green Supermix. ZIKV RNA or target gene
mRNA levels were normalized to mouse b-actin RNA levels according
to the 2−DDCt calculations. The qRT-PCR primer sequences are available
upon request.
Detection of testosterone in serum
TheconcentrationoftestosteroneinserumofZIKV-infectedIfnar1−/−mice
was performed by using the Mouse Testosterone ELISA Kit (Abcam)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Isolation of Leydig cells
Leydig cells were isolated from WT and Ifnar1−/− mice according to
previous studies (36, 43). In brief, the testes of two mice were decap-
sulated and incubated with collagenase (0.5 mg/ml) in F12/DMEM
(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS at room temperature
for 15 min with gentle inverting. The suspensions were filtered
through 70-mm mesh to separate the interstitial cells from seminifer-
ous tubules. The interstitial cells were cultured in F12/DMEM supple-
mented with FCS. After 24 hours, Leydig cells were detached by
0.125% trypsin treatment for 5 min and resuspended to dish.

 Histopathological analysis
The testes of mice were preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde/
phosphate-buffered saline for pathological examination. The fixed
samples were processed for paraffin embedding. Sections were
processed for immunohistological staining with an anti-ZIKV
NS1 antibody.
Data analysis
Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and Microsoft
Excel. One-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine the signifi-
cance of qRT-PCR values for host responses. One-way analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) was used to compare the weight and length of testes
and testosterone levels.
