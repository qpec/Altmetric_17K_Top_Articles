In Brief
Sanyal et al. report that the dysregulation
of cGMP signaling in adipose tissue of
obese mice is proportional to the degree
of metaflammation through distinct
pathways. Since targeting cGMP
signaling ameliorates obesity and
associated co-morbidities, knowledge
gained from this study suggests avenues
for therapy.

SUMMARY
Current worldwide figures suggest that obesity is
pandemic. Understanding the underlying molecular
mechanisms would help develop viable anti-obesity
therapies. Here, we assess the influence of obesity-
induced inflammation on white adipocyte cyclic gua-
nosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling, which is
beneficial for adipocyte differentiation and thermo-
genesis. We find that murine gonadal and not inguinal
fat is prone to obesity-induced inflammation. Corre-
spondingly, the cGMP cascade is dysregulated in
gonadal but not in inguinal fat of obese mice.
Analysis of two independent human cohorts reveals
a defective cGMP pathway only in visceral fat of
obese subjects. Congruently, cGMP signaling is dys-
regulated in tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)-treated
primary white adipocytes. TNF-a-mediated suppres-
sion of sGCb1 is mediated via NF-kB, whereas PKG
is repressed by JNK signaling. Additionally, TNF-
a-activated JNK signaling suppresses PPARg and
aP2. Taken together, the intensity of obesity-induced
inflammation dictates the amplitude of cGMP sig-
naling dysregulation in white adipocytes through
distinct pathways.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased over
the past few decades (Ng et al., 2014). The World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) estimates that 1.9 billion human adults are
overweight, of whom 600 million are obese (World Health Orga-
nization, 2014). Obesity, characterized by unhealthy expansion
of the adipose tissue (AT) (Rutkowski et al., 2015), is associated
with pathophysiological changes in AT (Sun et al., 2011; O
¨ zcan
et al., 2004) that lead to chronic inflammation (Gutierrez et al.,
2009; Castoldi et al., 2016; Dalmas et al., 2011), which is also
known as metaflammation (Gregor and Hotamisligil, 2011).
Obesity alters the AT immune cell profile from an anti- to pro-in-
flammatory state (Lumeng et al., 2007a, 2008; Weisberg et al.,
2003; Lee and Lee, 2014; Lumeng and Saltiel, 2011). Pro-inflam-
matory cytokines (Lee and Lee, 2014), such as tumor necrosis
factor a (TNF-a), released by AT cells, have been shown to
play a major role in the development of insulin resistance and
diabetes (Hotamisligil and Spiegelman, 1994). Systemic insulin
resistance eventually perturbs metabolic homeostasis and
ultimately contributes to obesity-associated co-morbidities (de
Luca and Olefsky, 2008; Gutierrez et al., 2009; Jung and Choi,
2014).
Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a second
messenger involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular sys-
tem (Tsai and Kass, 2009; Handa et al., 2011), as well as AT func-
tion (Haas et al., 2009; Mitschke et al., 2013; Ayala et al., 2007;
Hoffmann et al., 2015). cGMP is produced by two types of gua-
nylate cyclases (GCs) (Koesling et al., 1991): a-b heterodimeric
soluble GC (sGC), when stimulated by nitric oxide (NO) (Koesling
et al., 1991; McDonald and Murad, 1996; Poulos, 2006); and
membrane-bound particulate GC (pGC), upon extracellular
natriuretic peptide activation (Miyashita et al., 2009; Waldman
et al., 1984). In turn, cGMP can activate cyclic nucleotide gated
ion channels (Pifferi et al., 2006) and the cGMP-dependent pro-
tein kinase (PKG) (Butt et al., 1994; Francis et al., 2010), which
has been identified as the major mediator of cGMP effects in ad-
ipocytes (Haas et al., 2009; Mitschke et al., 2013; Withers et al.,
2014). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) like PDE5A degrade cGMP to
GMP (Francis et al., 2010), thereby regulating cGMP signaling
activation. Although, the cGMP-PKG cascade enhances differ-
entiation and thermogenesis (energy expenditure by heat gener-
ation) in adipocytes (Haas et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2015;
Mitschke et al., 2013; Bordicchia et al., 2012), not much is
known about its regulation during obesity. Therefore, examining
cGMP signaling modulation in obesity is important and might
have therapeutic implications.

 Here, we assess the impact of genetic and diet-induced
obesity (DIO) on cGMP signaling in white adipose tissue (WAT).
We demonstrate that sGC-PKG1-mediated cGMP signaling is
diminished in gonadal or visceral WAT (WATg), but not in inguinal
or subcutaneous WAT (WATi), of mice. Interestingly, sGCb1 and
PKG1 mRNA expression is reduced in omental or visceral AT
(VAT), but not in subcutaneous AT (SAT), of obese humans. In
parallel, we find that murine WATg displays strong character-
istics of obesity-induced inflammation, whereas WATi is mini-
mally inflamed. Treatment of primary murine white adipocytes
(WAs) with TNF-a represses the sGC-PKG1 pathway, as well
as expression of major adipogenic regulators (peroxisome pro-
liferator-activated receptor gamma [PPARg] and adipocyte
protein 2 [aP2]). Subsequently, we identify that TNF-a-activated
nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling suppresses sGCb1 expres-
sion, while PKG1, PPARg, and aP2 are downregulated by
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling.
RESULTS
Obesity Downregulates cGMP Signaling in WATg, but
Not in WATi, of Mice
To understand the impact of obesity on the cGMP signaling
pathway in WAT, we analyzed WATg and WATi of leptin-deficient
genetically obese (ob/ob) and lean (ob/+) mice for expression of
the major cGMP signaling components sGCb1 and PKG1. To
exclude artifacts resulting from leptin deficiency, we corrobo-
rated our observations by analyzing mice fed a high-fat diet
(HFD) compared to controls fed a normal diet (ND). The ob/ob
mice were significantly heavier than ob/+ mice (whole body
weight as well as WAT and liver weights; Figure S1A and S1B).
sGCb1 protein content in WATg was significantly reduced in
ob/ob and HFD mice compared to their respective controls (Fig-
ures 1A and 1B, top). In addition, Gucy1b3 (sGCb1) mRNA
expression was lower in WATg from ob/ob and HFD mice (Fig-
ures 1A and 1B, bottom). Conversely, sGCb1 protein expression
in WATi was significantly increased in ob/ob but unaltered in HFD
mice (Figures 1C and 1D, top). Gucy1b3 expression was not
significantly altered in WATi of genetically or diet-induced obese
mice compared to corresponding lean controls (Figures 1C and
1D, bottom). Expression of sGCa1 (Gucy1a3), the other compo-
nent of sGC, was also significantly reduced in WATg but unal-
tered in WATi from ob/ob mice (Figures S1C). To study the func-
tional consequence of sGC repression, we analyzed cGMP
production upon acute stimulation with the nitric oxide (NO)
donor (SNAP), which was significantly diminished in WATg ex-
plants from ob/ob compared to ob/+ mice (Figure 1E, top). In
contrast, SNAP-stimulated cGMP levels were not significantly
different between WATi from ob/+ and ob/ob mice (Figure 1E,
bottom). Interestingly, expression of PKG1, the major target of
cGMP in adipocytes, was reduced in WATg of ob/ob and HFD-
fed mice compared to their respective controls (Figures 1F and
1G) but was unchanged in WATi (Figures 1H and 1I). Fittingly,
cGMP-induced phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phos-
phoprotein (VASP), a major PKG target in adipocytes (Jennissen
et al., 2012), at serine-239 was repressed only in WATg, but not
in WATi, of ob/ob mice (Figure 1J). In a separate cohort of DIO
mice (body and tissue weights in Figures S1D and S1E),
Gucy1b3 and Prkg1 expression was significantly reduced in
adipocytes as well as the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of
WATg from HFD mice but unchanged in WATi (Figures S1F
and S1G). Altogether, we observe that sGC-PKG1-mediated
cGMP signaling is dysregulated in WATg, but surprisingly not
in WATi, of obese mice.
Different Degrees of Metaflammation in WATg and WATi
in Obesity
Unhealthy expansion of adipose tissue during obesity leads to
metaflammation (Gregor and Hotamisligil, 2011; Lee and Lee,
2014; Lumeng et al., 2007a; Lumeng and Saltiel, 2011). To
explain the discrepancies in sGC and PKG1 expression patterns
between the WAT depots, we assessed the inflammatory pro-
files of WATg and WATi in lean and obese mice. Expression of
pro-inflammatory genes like Tnfa, interleukin 6 (Il6), interleukin
1b (Il1b), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (Ccl3) and 7
(Ccl7) was significantly increased in WATg from ob/ob compared
to ob/+ mice (Figure 2A). In contrast, expression of Il6 and Ccl7
was unchanged in WATi from ob/ob and ob/+ mice, while Tnfa,
Il1b, and Ccl3 were repressed (Figure 2B). Ccl2 was upregulated
in WATi, but to a lesser extent than in WATg from ob/ob mice.
F4/80 staining in histological sections demonstrated a visibly
greater AT macrophage (ATM) content in WATg than in WATi
from ob/ob mice (Figure 2C). Flow cytometric analysis (gating
strategy in Figure S2A) of WAT from ob/+ and ob/ob mice re-
vealed that ATM (CD45+ F4/80+ CD11b+ Ly6C�) content was
significantly higher in WATg from ob/ob mice than ob/+ mice
(Figures 2D and 2E). However, macrophage counts only moder-
ately increased in WATi (Figures 2D and 2E). The proportion
of pro-inflammatory ATMs (CD45+ F4/80+ CD11b+ Ly6C�
CD11c+; Lumeng et al., 2007a; Morris et al., 2011) significantly
increased only in WATg, but not WATi, of ob/ob mice when
compared to ob/+ mice (Figures 2F and S2B). On the contrary,
anti-inflammatory ATM proportion (CD45+ F4/80+ CD11b+
Ly6C� CD11c� CD206+ CD301+; Morris et al., 2011) was dimin-
ished in WATg of ob/ob mice when compared to ob/+ mice but
unaltered in WATi (Figure 2G). Nonetheless, their content
increased in both WATg and WATi of ob/ob mice compared to
ob/+ mice (Figure S2C). These observations indicated that
WATg from ob/ob mice has a greater macrophage content and
is more inflamed than WATi.
In DIO, Tnfa expression was higher in WATg, but not in WATi,
from HFD mice compared to ND mice (Figures 2H and 2I).
Although Il6 and Ccl2 were mildly upregulated in WATi of HFD
mice, overall, their expression was greater in WATg. Inflamma-
tory markers were highly upregulated in the SVF and adipocyte
compartments of WATg, but not in WATi, in HFD mice (Figures
S3A–S3D). Adipocyte and SVF biomarker gene expression was
determined to ascertain purity of the samples analyzed (Figures
S3E–S3J). Ccl2 and Ccl3 mRNA were moderately elevated in
WATi, while their expression in both SVF and adipocytes from
WATg was higher in HFD mice (Figures S3A–S3D). Adgre1 (F4/
80) expression was greatly increased in WATg of HFD mice but
only moderately increased in WATi (Figures 2H and 2I). Mirroring
mRNA expression, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b, monocyte chemoattrac-
tant protein 1 (MCP-1), MCP-3, and macrophage inflammatory
protein 1a (MIP-1a) content was significantly higher in WATg of
226
Cell Reports 18, 225–236, January 3, 2017
 HFD mice than in WATg of ND mice (Figures 2J and S3K).
Conversely, TNF-a and IL-6 were unchanged, while MCP-1
and MCP-3 were modestly upregulated and IL-1b was reduced
in WATi of HFD mice (Figures 2K and S3L). The serum level of
MCP-3 was significantly higher in HFD mice, while IL-6 elevation
was not statistically significant (Figure S3M). TNF-a, IL-1b,
MCP-1, and MIP-1a content in circulation was unaffected by
DIO (Figure S3M). Together, these data suggest that although
obesity results in expansion of WAT in mice, metaflammation
is pronounced only in WATg.

 TNF-a Impairs cGMP Signaling and Adipogenic
Differentiation in Primary Murine White Adipocytes
To determine whether metaflammation dysregulates cGMP
signaling in adipocytes, we treated primary murine WAs with
TNF-a. Chronic TNF-a treatment of preadipocytes during dif-
ferentiation (Figure S4A) impaired the sGC-PKG1 pathway.
Expression of sGCb1 protein and mRNA was significantly
repressed in TNF-a-treated cells (Figure 3A). In addition,
Gucy1a3 mRNA expression was greatly reduced (Figure S4B),
while PDE5A (protein and mRNA) was unaltered upon chronic
TNF-a treatment (Figure S4C). Accordingly, DEA/NO-stimulated
cGMP production was significantly lower in TNF-a-treated cells
(Figure 3B). PKG1 expression was also significantly down-
regulated at the protein and mRNA levels after TNF-a treat-
ment (Figure 3C). Diminished PKG1 expression translated into
reduced
cGMP-PKG-dependent
VASP
phosphorylation
in
TNF-a-treated cells (Figure 3D). Treatment of WAs with TNF-a
not only dysregulated the cGMP cascade but also curtailed
adipocyte differentiation (Cawthorn and Sethi, 2008, Zhang
et al., 1996, Sethi and Hotamisligil, 1999, Ruan et al., 2002).
As indicated by reduced oil red O staining (Figure 3E) and tri-
glyceride (TG) content (Figure 3F), lipid content was significantly
lower in TNF-a-treated cells than in untreated WAs. This TNF-
a-induced inability of preadipocytes to accumulate lipids was
corroborated by a drastic repression of the adipogenic marker
PPARg and aP2 (Figures 3G and 3H) and mRNA expression
(Figure S4B).
Next, we tested whether TNF-a regulated cGMP signaling in
differentiated WAs. Mature WAs treated with TNF-a for 4 days
(Figure S4D) demonstrated a significant reduction in sGCb1 as
well as PKG1 protein and mRNA expression (Figures 3I, 3J,
and S4E). Although TNF-a treatment did not visibly alter
lipid content in differentiated WAs (Figures 3K and 3L), PPARg
and aP2 expression was significantly diminished (Figures
S4F–S4H). Apart from TNF-a, Gucy1b3 and Prkg1 were also
repressed by IL-1b and interferon g (IFN-g) treatment of differ-
entiated WAs (Figure S4I). However, only IL-1b had a negative
impact on adipogenic marker expression (Figure S4I). This
demonstrated
that
metaflammation
inhibits
sGC-PKG1-
mediated cGMP signaling as well as adipogenic markers in
differentiating and mature WAs. Notably, despite the differ-
ences in inflammation, adipogenic marker expression was
diminished in both WATg and WATi from obese mice (Fig-
ures S4J–S4N), suggesting that along with metaflamma-
tion, other obesity-induced stresses adversely affected AT
function.
TNF-a Inhibits Gucy1b3 via NF-kB and Prkg1 via JNK
Signaling
We next determined whether repression of sGCb1 and PKG1
was a direct result of TNF-a-induced inflammation or an indirect
consequence of reduced adipogenesis. We found that acute
TNF-a-treatment (6 hr) of differentiated WAs significantly down-
regulated Gucy1b3, Prkg1, Pparg, and Fabp4 expression (Fig-
ure 4A). This suggested a direct involvement of TNF-a-stimu-
lated pathways in repressing these genes. To identify the
mechanisms responsible for these TNF-a-mediated effects, we
pharmacologically inhibited two major TNF-a-activated path-
ways, NF-kB and JNK signaling. TNF-a-repressed Gucy1b3
expression was restored to control levels in cells co-treated
with the NF-kB signaling inhibitor MG132 (10 mM), Bay11-7085
(10 mM), or cardamonin (10 mM) (Figure 4B). On the other hand,
co-treatment with these inhibitors did not rescue TNF-a-induced
repression of Prkg1, Pparg, or Fabp4 expression (Figure 4B).
Likewise, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated p65 knockdown
improved TNF-a-mediated Gucy1b3 repression (Figure 4C).
However, shRNA-mediated knockdown of p65 had no effect
on TNF-a-mediated Prkg1, Pparg, and Fabp4 suppression
(Figures 4D–4F). Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of JNK
signaling by SP600125 or TCS JNK 6o (10 mM each) ameliorated
TNF-a-induced repression of Prkg1, Pparg, and Fabp4, but not
Gucy1b3 (Figure 4G). In agreement, shRNA-mediated cJun
knockdown rescued TNF-a-mediated inhibition of Prkg1, Pparg,
and Fabp4 expression, but not Gucy1b3 (Figures 4H–4K). To
confirm these in vitro effects, WATg explants from ND and
HFD mice were treated with Bay 11-7085 or TCS JNK 6o
(10 mM; 6 hr). Gucy1b3 expression, lowered in HFD mice, was
rescued only by ex vivo Bay 11-7085 treatment (Figure S5A),
while expression of Prkg1, Pparg, and Fabp4 was restored
only by TCS JNK 6o (Figures S5B–S5D).
The efficacy of pharmacological agents used was determined
by analyzing NF-kB-p65 (Ser-536) and cJun (Ser-63) phosphor-
ylation, which are increased by TNF-a (Figures S5E and S5F).
Knockdown efficiency and target specificity of the shRNAs
were also confirmed (Figures S5G and S5H).
We next assessed whether reduced WA differentiation was
caused by diminished sGC-PKG1 signaling in TNF-a-treated
cells.
Through
lentiviral
shRNA-mediated
knockdown
of
sGCb1 (Figures S6A and S6B), we mimicked the obesity-
induced reduction in sGC-PKG1-mediated cGMP signaling
in vivo (WATg) and examined its consequences on adipocyte
differentiation and inflammation. Silencing sGCb1 significantly
diminished basal as well as TNF-a-induced Tnfa and Nos2
expression (Figure S6C). As expected (Hoffmann et al., 2015),
knocking down sGCb1 severely compromised PPARg and aP2
expression (Figures S6D and S6E). Nonetheless, Pparg and
Fabp4 were further repressed in acute TNF-a-treated sGCb1
knocked-down cells (Figure S6F). Other adipogenic markers
(Fasn, Plin1, Lpl, Cd36, and Slc2a4) were downregulated in
sGCb1 knocked-down cells (Figure S6G). Interestingly, Plin1,
Lpl, Cd36, and Slc2a4 were further repressed upon acute
TNF-a treatment (Figure S6G). These observations highlighted

GUCY1B3 and PRKG1 Expression Is Repressed in
Visceral, but Not Subcutaneous, Adipose Tissue of
Obese Humans
To corroborate our observations in mice, we examined
whether the expression of sGCb1 and PKG1 was altered
in SAT and omental or VAT from lean (BMI % 25kg/m2) and
obese (BMI R 30 kg/m2) humans. GUCY1B3 mRNA expres-
sion in SAT positively correlated with body fat content of
individuals from cohort 1 (Figure 5A), while, it was unchanged
in SAT from lean and obese individuals (Figure 5B, left) from a
second, independent cohort (cohort 2). Although, PRKG1
expression was higher in SAT (Figure 5B, right), expression
of both GUCY1B3 and PRKG1 was significantly reduced in
VAT from obese patients of cohort 2 (Figure 5C). In the
same samples, inflammatory marker gene expression was
unaltered in SAT but significantly enhanced in VAT of obese
patients (Figures 5D and 5E). This suggested that like in

 mice, human VAT is prone to metaflammation and cGMP sig-
naling dysregulation.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we assessed the impact of obesity-associated
metaflammation on cGMP signaling in WAT. Previously, we
and others have shown that cGMP signaling enhances differen-
tiation and activates a thermogenic program in murine as well as
human adipocytes (Bordicchia et al., 2012; Haas et al., 2009;
Hoffmann et al., 2015; Mitschke et al., 2013). We report that
major components of the cGMP cascade, sGCb1 and PKG1,
are downregulated in WATg, but not in WATi, of obese mice
(both in adipocytes and SVF). Consequently, cGMP production
by sGC upon NO stimulation is significantly lower in WATg
from ob/ob mice than in control animals (ob/+). Conversely,
sGC function remains intact in obese WATi. Similarly, PKG1-
mediated VASP phosphorylation is dampened in WATg, but
not in WATi, of ob/ob mice. These observations suggest that
sGC-PKG1-mediated cGMP signaling is severely impaired only
in WATg from obese mice. Additionally, reduced Gucy1b3 and
Prkg1 mRNA levels imply that metabolic stress-induced cellular
pathways inhibit their expression at the transcriptional level.
Notably, like in mice, GUCY1B3 and PRKG1 expression is dimin-
ished only in VAT, but not SAT, of obese humans.
Our results demonstrate a discrepancy in the expression
and function of cGMP signaling components in subcutaneous
and visceral AT from obese mice and humans. Earlier reports
show that obesity leads to mechanical and endoplasmic reticu-

2010; Ertunc and Hotamisligil, 2016), and
oxidative stress (Furukawa et al., 2004;
Kusminski and Scherer, 2012). These pro-
cesses, in concert with increased pro-in-
flammatory immune cell presence (Lee and Lee, 2014; Lumeng
et al., 2007a; Weisberg et al., 2003; Huh et al., 2014; Nishimura
et al., 2009; Talukdar et al., 2012; Wensveen et al., 2015), disturb
AT microenvironment (Sun et al., 2011), impede AT function
(leading to ectopic lipid deposition) (Carobbio et al., 2011; Unger
and Scherer, 2010), enhance metaflammation (Gregor and Hota-
misligil, 2011; Gutierrez et al., 2009), and eventually result in
metabolic dysregulation (de Luca and Olefsky, 2008; Gutierrez
et al., 2009; Jung and Choi, 2014). Targeting inflammation or
inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, is known
to be metabolically beneficial (Aouadi et al., 2013; Hotamisligil
et al., 1993; Kusminski et al., 2016). Interestingly, we observe
heightened expression of pro-inflammatory markers only in
WATg, but not WATi, of obese mice. Macrophages, the major
mediators of metaflammation-induced AT dysfunction (Aouadi
et al., 2013; Boutens and Stienstra, 2016; Kamei et al., 2006),
accumulate in obese WAT (Weisberg et al., 2003). This results
from higher influx of blood monocytes into AT (Weisberg et al.,
2006; Oh et al., 2012; Lumeng et al., 2007b; Kamei et al., 2006)
as well as in situ proliferation (Amano et al., 2014). ATMs also
undergo a phenotypic switch from an anti-inflammatory to a
pro-inflammatory state (Lumeng et al., 2007a; Castoldi et al.,
2016; Lumeng et al., 2008). In ob/ob mice, we observe a robust
increase in WATg macrophage content, whereas WATi ATM
content increases marginally. Interestingly, the proportion of
pro-inflammatory ATMs is greater in WATg than WATi of ob/ob
mice. This suggests that although white ATM content increases
in murine obesity, only WATg accumulates pro-inflammatory
macrophages and is hence vulnerable to metaflammation.

Cell Reports 18, 225–236, January 3, 2017
 Similarly, we observe that VAT is greatly inflamed in obese
humans, while SAT does not demonstrate traits of severe meta-
flammation. Others have also demonstrated a disparity in AT
macrophage content of obese humans, with higher numbers in
VAT than SAT (Cancello et al., 2006; O’Rourke et al., 2009).
Moreover, in humans, VAT mass is a dominant risk factor for
the development of obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities
(Harman-Boehm et al., 2007; Tchkonia et al., 2013). Thus, murine
and human VAT is at a greater risk of obesity-induced inflamma-
tion and its consequences than SAT.
Based on the observations thus far, we hypothesize that the
degree of AT inflammation corresponds to the extent of cGMP
signaling disruption. Mimicking metaflammation by TNF-a treat-
ment inhibits the cGMP cascade in differentiating and mature
adipocytes. sGC expression and NO-stimulated cGMP produc-
tion is diminished in TNF-a-treated cells during differentiation.
Likewise, reduced PKG1 expression in TNF-a-treated WAs re-
sults in diminished cGMP-stimulated VASP phosphorylation.
Apart from impeding the cGMP cascade, TNF-a also suppresses
adipocyte differentiation and adipogenic gene expression (Caw-
thorn and Sethi, 2008; Zhang et al., 1996). In congruence, lipid
accumulation in differentiating WAs is severely blunted, with a
concomitant repression of PPARg and aP2. Although TNF-a
does not alter lipid content in differentiated adipocytes, PPARg
and aP2 expression is significantly reduced. These detrimental
effects on cGMP signaling and adipogenesis are not exclusive
to TNF-a. IL-1b and IFN-g treatment also downregulates
sGCb1, PKG1, and adipogenic marker expression in WAs.
Thus, metaflammation plays a leading role in dysregulating
cGMP signaling in WAs. Interestingly, several essential adipo-
genic genes are downregulated in both WATg and WATi of obese
mice, suggesting that in concert with inflammation, other
obesity-associated mechanisms, such as ER-stress-induced
UPR, hypoxia, and others, hamper lipid synthesis in and the stor-
age capacity of WATi. Therefore, even though obesity-induced
inflammation is a major player, especially in WATg, it is not solely
responsible for the inhibition of WAT adipogenesis and the
resulting lipid spillover.
We next investigate whether inflammation directly and
simultaneously represses cGMP signaling and adipogenesis.
Since acute TNF-a treatment reduces Gucy1b3 and Prkg1
expression, we predict that TNF-a-activated cellular pathways
directly impede cGMP signaling. A positive feed-forward effect
of dysregulated cGMP signaling on inflammatory signaling is
not probable, as knocking down sGCb1 does not aggravate
pro-inflammatory gene expression. In parallel, Pparg, Fabp4
and several other adipogenic genes are repressed by acute
TNF-a exposure. Although genetic ablation of cGMP signaling
components result in reduced adipogenic gene expression
(Haas et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2015; Mitschke et al.,
2013), TNF-a treatment can independently further downregulate
Pparg, Fabp4, Plin1, Lpl, Cd36, and Slc2a4. This suggests that
metaflammation diminishes adipogenesis by directly inhibiting
adipogenic gene expression, as well as indirectly, through
disruption of the cGMP cascade.
We also identify the cellular mechanisms responsible for
TNF-a-induced repression of sGCb1, PKG1, PPARg, and aP2.
Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of NF-kB signaling spe-
cifically restores TNF-a-driven Gucy1b3 repression. Conversely,
TNF-a-induced Prkg1 suppression is ameliorated by impeding
the JNK cascade. TNF-a is known to represses Pparg and
Fabp4 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Ruan et al., 2002;
Zhang et al., 1996) through inhibition of CCAAT/enhancer-bind-
ing protein d (C/EBPd) expression (Kudo et al., 2004). In ST2
cells, TNF-a has been shown to inhibit PPARg function through
NF-kB signaling (Suzawa et al., 2014). However, we demonstrate
that TNF-a-activated JNK, and not NF-kB signaling, diminishes
Pparg and Fabp4 expression in primary murine WAs. Our obser-
vations suggest that NF-kB and JNK signaling have distinct
effects on cGMP signaling and adipogenesis (Figure 6).
Multiple reports demonstrate that activating cGMP signaling
improves insulin sensitivity (Ayala et al., 2007), WATg inflamma-
tion (Handa et al., 2011), and adipogenic marker expression and
induces thermogenesis in obese mice (Hoffmann et al., 2015).
We conclude that the extent of metaflammation in WAT dictates
the degree of cGMP signaling dysfunction through specific
pathways. Given that targeting cGMP signaling (Pfeifer and
Hoffmann, 2015) is metabolically beneficial, our findings high-
light the importance of inflammatory mechanisms governing
cGMP signaling dysfunction. Combining inhibition of inflamma-
tion and enhancing cGMP signaling, could be a potential anti-
obesity therapeutic avenue.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Studies
Breeding pairs of ob/+ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Male
16-week-old ob/+ and ob/ob mice were used. Six-week-old C57BL/6J mice,
assessed for the impact of DIO on WAT cGMP signaling, were fed an HFD
(D12492; Ssniff) or ND (D12450B; Ssniff) for 18 weeks. They were part of a pre-
viously published cohort identifying the metabolic effects of sGCb1 stimulation
(by Bay 41-4583) in established obesity (Hoffmann et al., 2015). These studies
