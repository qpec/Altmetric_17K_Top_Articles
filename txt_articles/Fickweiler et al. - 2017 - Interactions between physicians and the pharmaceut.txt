Objectives The objective of this review is to explore 
interactions between physicians and the pharmaceutical 
industry including sales representatives and their impact 
on physicians’ attitude and prescribing habits.
Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and 
Google scholar electronic databases were searched from 
1992 to August 2016 using free-text words and medical 
subject headings relevant to the topic.
study selection Studies included cross-sectional studies, 
cohort studies, randomised trials and survey designs. 
Studies with narrative reviews, case reports, opinion 
polls and letters to the editor were excluded from data 
synthesis.
Data extraction Two reviewers independently extracted 
the data. Data on study design, study year, country, 
participant characteristics, setting and number of 
participants were collected.
Data synthesis Pharmaceutical industry and 
pharmaceutical sales representative (PSR) interactions 
influence physicians’ attitudes and their prescribing 
behaviour and increase the number of formulary addition 
requests for the company’s drug.
conclusion Physician–pharmaceutical industry and 
its sales representative’s interactions and acceptance 
of gifts from the company’s PSRs have been found to 
affect physicians’ prescribing behaviour and are likely 
to contribute to irrational prescribing of the company’s 
drug. Therefore, intervention in the form of policy 
implementation and education about the implications of 
these interactions is needed.
IntrODuctIOn
The relationship between physicians and the 
pharmaceutical industry has evoked heated 
debate for many decades.1 In 2012, the phar-
maceutical industry spent $89.5 billion on 
physician–pharmaceutical sales representa-
tive (PSR) interactions that accounted for 60% 
of the global sales and marketing spending.2–8 
Previous reports have demonstrated that 
PSRs may influence prescribing behaviour.9–16 
However, the evidence determining whether 
pharmaceutical industry and PSRs interac-
tions influence physicians is divided and 
contradictory. Studies have indicated that 
physicians may be unable to distinguish 
between 
promotional 
information 
and 
scientific evidence.17 18 Physicians, however, 
believe their colleagues are more susceptible 
to pharmaceutical industry marketing strat-
egies than themselves.19–22 The majority of 
the physicians do not believe that they are 
affected by pharmaceutical industry and PSR 
interactions. Most medical and governmental 
institutions have installed guidelines and 
self-regulatory and legislative checks to regu-
late the relationship between physicians and 
the pharmaceutical industry and its repre-
sentatives.5 15 16 23–26 However, while admin-
istrative proposals for deregulatory reforms

that would remove some governmental authority over 
the industry are increasing, scientific evidence rigorously 
examining the extent of interactions between physicians 
and pharmaceutical industry and it PSRs is needed. This 
review evaluates critically and systemically the evidence 
on the impact of pharmaceutical industry and PSR inter-
actions on physicians.
MethODOlOgy
Protocol
We followed a detailed methodology that we described 
in our review protocol, which is available on request to 
the corresponding author. Two independent reviewers 
assessed selected articles as per inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, shortlisted them for writing the review and cross-
checked their decisions about inclusion/exclusion with 
each other. The review followed the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guide-
lines (supplementary appendix 1).
eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria were:
 
► types of studies: observational study design, such as 
cross-sectional studies and cohort studies, but also 
(non-)randomised trials and survey designs comparing 
at least one facet that are mentioned below on the 
impact on behaviour and attitude;
 
► types of participants: physicians, pharmaceutical 
representatives and physicians in training/residents;
 
► types of exposure: any type of interaction between 
physicians and the pharmaceutical industry where 
there is direct interaction with the physician, such 
as meeting with drug representatives, participating 
in pharmaceutical-sponsored Continuing Medical 
Education (CME) events, receiving travel funding, 
free drug samples, industry-provided meals, gifts and 
presentations of industry-related information;
 
► types of outcome: knowledge, beliefs and/or attitudes 
of physicians regarding physician–industry interac-
tions and (prescribing) behaviour of physicians;
 
► type of control: no interaction.
 
► Exclusion criteria were: qualitative, ecological, econo-
metric studies, editorials, letters to the editor, studies 
on other health professionals (eg, nurses and medical 
students), small samples sizes, studies assessing indi-
rect interactions and research funding.
We did not exclude studies based on risk of bias. We 
took risk of bias into account when grading the quality of 
evidence using GRADE approach.
search strategy
The search strategy included PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
Library and Google Scholar electronic databases (January 
1992 to August 2016). Databases were not searched 
 on 2 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

before 1992, as these studies were already investigated in 
an earlier review.27 The search combined terms for physi-
cians and pharmaceutical and included both free-text 
words and medical subject heading relevant to the topic. 
We did not use a search filter. The online supplementary 
information file provides the full details for one database. 
Additional search strategies included a search of the grey 
literature (theses and dissertations). Also, we reviewed 
the references lists of included and relevant papers.27–29
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two reviewers assessed in duplicate and independently 
the risk of bias in each eligible study. Disagreements were 
resolved by discussion or adjudication by a third reviewer. 
We used the recommendations outlined in the Cochrane 
Handbook to assess the risk of bias in randomised studies. 
We graded each potential source of bias and rated the 
studies as high, low or unclear risk of bias.
Data analysis and synthesis
The information extracted from the selected studies 
included type of study, study design, type of pharmaceu-
tical industry and PSR interaction and type of outcome. We 
did not conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity 
of study design, types of interventions, outcomes assessed 
and outcome measures used. Instead, we summarised the 
data narratively. We assessed the quality of evidence by 
outcome using the GRADE methodology.30
results
We independently screened the titles and abstracts of the 
2170 identified records for potential eligibility. Out of 
2170, the full text of 49 eligible citations that matched 
the inclusion criteria were retrieved and used for qualita-
tive assessment during the writing of the review (figure 1, 
table 1).
characteristics of included studies
The identified studies were published between 1992 and 
August 2016. Most of the studies included were cross-sec-
tional studies.1 9–13 19 21 22 31–55 Only two studies were cohort 
studies,56 57 three were randomised trials58–60 and one 
study was a case–control study.61
extent of interactions between physicians and the 
pharmaceutical industry
We found that PSR interactions are a regular feature in 
the daily lives of physicians across the world.9–11 13 42 50 
Most of the attending physicians and residents have at 
least one interaction with industry representatives per 
month.10 21 22 36 42 The frequency of interactions or gifts 
offered and accepted varies with private versus public 
hospital setting and the position of the physicians in 
the medical hierarchy.10 13 31 38 42 43 50 58 62 Junior resi-
dents received twice as much free drug samples from 
PSR interactions than senior residents.10 PSR interac-
tions were significantly higher at the beginning of resi-
dency.13 The majority of programme directors of internal 
medicine residencies in the USA allowed PSRs to meet 
with residents during working hours and permitted PSR 
sponsorship of conferences.40 Attending physicians and 
physician specialists had more PSR interactions and 
received higher numbers of medical samples and promo-
tional material than residents.9 42 Participants working in 
private practice alone or in both sectors were more likely 
to receive gifts than physicians working in the public 
sector.38 42 50 Most common gifts received were medical 
samples,9 21 22 31 36 37 42 63 promotional material9 34 42 invi-
tations for dinners,9 invitations for CMEs,22 34 scientific 
journals34 and free lunches.21 37
Perspectives of physicians towards Psr interactions
We found that physicians have a positive attitude towards 
PSRs1 13 19 20 22 31 32 40 49 58 64 Physicians perceived PSRs as 
important sources of education and funding,10 22 32 43 45 46; 
while some studies reporting sceptical attitudes about 
the contribution of PSRs towards teaching and educa-
tion.21 36 39 40 49 Conference registration fees, informa-
tional luncheons, sponsorship of departmental journal 
clubs, anatomical models and free drug samples were 
considered as appropriate gifts.19 39 51 58 Most of the physi-
cians considered pharmaceutical information provided 
by PSRs, industry-sponsored conferences and CME events 
as important instruments for enhancing their scientific 
knowledge.22 32 45 46 Compared with senior residents, 
significantly more junior residents felt that pharmaceu-
tical representatives have a valuable teaching role.10
Most studies found that physicians do not believe that 
PSR interactions impact their prescribing behavoir,1 9–13 65 66 
while other studies found that there was some extent of 
influence.21 22 34 36 37 39 43 In addition, physicians consid-
ered their colleagues more susceptible than themselves 
to PSR marketing strategies.1 20 21 37 43 There was a strong 
correlation between the amount of gifts and the belief 
that PSR interactions did not influence their prescribing 
behaviour.10
gifts
We found that better scores on knowledge and attitudes 
were significantly associated with fewer interactions with 
representatives and their gifts.19 Conference registration 
fees, informational luncheons, sponsorship of depart-
mental journal clubs, anatomical models and free drug 
samples were considered as appropriate gifts19 37 47 52 
Most of the physicians considered themselves immune to 
the influence of gifts.1 10 32 33 35 39 53 58 Most common gifts 
received were medical samples,9 21 22 31 36 37 42–44 47 promo-
tional material,9 34 42 67 invitations for dinners9 and scien-
tific journals.34
Drug samples
Most of the physicians who accepted drug samples had 
a positive attitude towards the pharmaceutical repre-
sentatives.9 21 22 31 36 37 42 43 Accepting samples lead to 
higher branded drug prescription rather than generic 
prescribing.22 47

Survey
Effect of restricting PSRs on 
clinical practice and knowledge
Restricting PSRs affected 
information flow about drugs, 
both negative and positive.
We excluded 2000 records as they were not relevant (n=1641), not original research (n=269), about medical students (n=4) and non-medical (eg, ecological and econometric; n=86).
PSRs, pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
Table 1 Continued 
Pharmaceutical representative speakers
Sponsored lectures/symposia of pharmaceutical compa-
nies influenced behaviour of the attendees leading to the 
attendees prescribing more drugs from the sponsoring 
companies without sufficient evidence supporting superi-
ority of those drugs.56 57 The majority of attending physi-
cians failed to identify inaccurate information about the 
company drug.18
honoraria and research funding
Physicians who received money to attend pharmaceu-
tical symposia or to perform research requested formu-
lary addition of the company’s drug more often than 
other physicians. This association was independent of 
many confounding factors61 (table 2). Brief encounters 
with PSRs and receipt of honoraria or research support 
were predictors of faculty requested change in hospital 
formulary.68
conference travel
Pharmaceutical company-sponsored conference travels 
to touristic locations have quantifiable impact on the 
prescribing rational of attendees. A significant increase 
(three times) in the prescribing rate of two company 
drugs was observed after the physicians attended a compa-
ny-sponsored symposium with all their expenses covered. 
Despite this significant difference in the prescribing 
patterns, physicians insisted there was no impact on their 
prescribing behaviour.57
Industry-paid lunches
Most physicians received invitations for dinners9 and 
free lunches.10 21 35 43 Clerks, interns and junior residents 
attended more company-sponsored lunches than senior 
residents.10 Pharmaceutical companies also sponsored 
departmental lunches during journal clubs.39 There 
was no significant association between attending indus-
try-paid lunches37 and dinners9 and formulary request for 
that company’s drug (table 2).
cMe sponsorship
Physicians who attended company-sponsored CME events 
had more positive attitudes towards and inclination to 
prescribe the branded drugs.28 34 43 67 69–71 We found that 
physicians who refused CME sponsorship were seen to 
prescribe higher proportion of generics and lower expen-
diture medicines when compared with physicians who 
attended CMEs.22
DIscussIOn
We report that there is widespread interaction between the 
pharmaceutical industry and physicians.9–11 13 42 50 Inter-
actions are in the form of personal communications, free 
gifts such as drug samples, sponsored meals, sponsored 
conference travel, funding for research and CMEs and 
honoraria.9 21 22 31 36 42 The frequency of these interactions 
is comparable between residents and physicians.10 21 22 36 42 
However, the amount and type of gifts vary with the position

of the physician in medical hierarchy, specialisation and 
location of practice.10 13 31 38 42 43 50 58 62 In general, trainees 
(residents and interns) are treated with more drug samples, 
stationery items and free meals than senior physicians.10 13 
Senior physicians usually avail of sponsored conferences/
trips, research funding, honoraria and CME events. The 
extent of these interactions varies with academic versus 
non-academic institutions: non-academic hospitals record 
more interactions than others.31 38 42 50 55 The majority of 
the physicians do not believe that they are affected by PSR 
interactions.1 10 32 33 35 37 43 59 However, a sizeable percentage 
in various surveys responded in the affirmative when asked 
whether they thought that their peers are vulnerable.1 20 21 37 43
Policies and educational intervention
The relationship of physicians with patients is of a fidu-
ciary nature. Hence, activities that might affect that rela-
tionship by altering physicians’ clinical behaviour are 
not acceptable. Physician–pharmaceutical industry and 
PSR interactions may put the trust of patients in physi-
cians at risk. Interaction with pharmaceutical industry 
and PSRs begins early in the physicians’ career. Trainees 
are exposed to pharmaceutical industry marketing and 
promotional techniques from the initial years of their 
medical education, which impact their prescribing 
behaviour in future. Overall, trainees, that is, residents 
and interns, are more vulnerable to pharmaceutical 
industry and PSR interactions than senior physicians11 41 62 
Physicians are susceptible to pharmaceutical industry and 
PSR interactions, which influences their clinical decision 
making leading to greater prescriptions of branded drugs 
over low-cost generic medicines and increasing health-
care costs.22 47 52 53 72 Therefore, there is need to institute 
and implement stringent policies curtailing physician–
pharmaceutical industry and PSR relationships, as well as 
educational programmes to increase awareness. Previous 
reports have indicated that implementing policies and 
conducting educational programmes are effective in 
increasing awareness of physician’s attitudes towards 
pharmaceutical industry and PSR interactions.54 59 60 73–83
strengths and limitations of the study
A major strength of this study is that it is a large, up-to-date 
systematic review of studies exploring the effects of physi-
cian and pharmaceutical industry representative interac-
tions and residents in different settings (eg, academic and 
primary care). Another strength of this study is the use of 
Cochrane and GRADE methodologies for conducting a 
review and assessing the quality of the studies. Moreover, 
we performed an extensive search in three databases 
and the grey literature. Some of the limitations of this 
review are related to the included studies, as some did 
not provide evidence for the significance of their find-
ings or had varying study designs and outcomes, which 
made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis. Also, the 
included studies were subject to risk of bias related to the 
lack of validity of outcome measurement and inadequate 
handling of significant potential confounders.
Future implications
Pharmaceutical industry and PSR interactions compromise 
the objectivity of the physicians. Educating physicians and 
increasing regulation of pharmaceutical industry and PSR 
interactions may lower the likelihood of prescribing new 
non-superior industry drugs and irrational prescription 
behaviour. Further studies are required to evaluate the 
impact of pharmaceutical industry and PSR interactions 
on physicians over time and the benefits of various inter-
vention-based education programmes on the clinical and 
ethical behaviour of the physicians.
