T
he safety of obstetric services in small, rural communi-
ties remains uncertain. Delivery at hospitals with low 
delivery volumes has been correlated with better, worse 
and comparable pregnancy outcomes compared with delivery 
at larger centres,1–7 and studies examining the safety of delivery 
at rural versus urban hospitals have likewise produced conflict-
ing results.8–12
Establishing the relative safety of obstetric care in small rural 
hospitals is challenging. Studies comparing health outcomes 
according to hospital delivery volume3–5 are influenced by under-
lying referral patterns in which higher rates of adverse outcomes 
at larger centres may reflect referrals of high-risk women. Adjust-
ment for maternal risk factors is unlikely to completely account 
for case-mix differences. Comparisons made according to catch-
ment area (in which women are classified according to their place 
of residence)1,2,4,8–12 prevent bias due to referral patterns, but con-
founding by differences in socioeconomic status and health 
behaviours between women living in urban and rural areas 
remains a concern.10 Such comparisons also have less utility for 
decisions about service regionalization because the policy option 
is not to change rural women’s place of residence to an urban set-
ting, but rather to have rural women travel to an urban setting to 
deliver, which may lead to increased risks, such as unintentional 
out-of-hospital delivery.2
Since 1998, nearly one-third of hospitals in British Columbia, 
Canada, have stopped providing planned obstetric services. The 
vast majority of service closures occurred in low-volume hospitals 
(< 150 deliveries/yr) serving smaller, rural communities. In this 
study, we examined whether the frequency and severity of mater-
nal–neonatal labour and delivery health outcomes of women 
residing in small communities were affected by the closure of 
their community hospitals. Other implications of obstetric service 
provision in small communities (e.g., social, economic), although 
important, are beyond the scope of this study.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: In recent decades, many 
smaller hospitals in British Columbia, Can-
ada, have stopped providing planned 
obstetric services. We examined the effect 
of these service closures on the labour 
and delivery outcomes of pregnant 
women living in affected communities.
METHODS: We used maternal postal 
codes to identify delivery records (1998–
2014) of women residing in a commu-
nity affected by service closure. The re-
cords were obtained from the British 
Columbia Perinatal Data Registry. We 
examined the effect of the closures us-
ing a within-communities fixed-effects 
framework and included similar-sized 
communities without service closures to 
control for underlying time trends. The 
primary outcome was a previously pub-
lished composite measure of labour and 
delivery safety, the Adverse Outcome In-
dex, which includes adverse events such 
as birth injury and unanticipated opera-
tive procedures, and includes weights 
for severity of adverse events. Second-
ary outcomes included maternal or 
newborn transfer, and use of obstetric 
interventions.
RESULTS: We found little evidence that 
closure of planned obstetric services af-
fected the risk of composite adverse 
maternal–newborn outcome (–0.4 ex-
cess adverse events per 100 deliveries, 
95% confidence interval [CI] –2.0 to 1.1), 
or most other secondary outcomes. The 
severity of composite outcome events 
decreased following the closures (rate 
ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89). Closures 
were associated with increases in use of 
epidural analgesia (3.4 excess events per 
100 deliveries, 95% CI 0.4 to 6.3) and 
length of antepartum stay (0.6 h, 95% CI 
0.1 to 1.0 h).
INTERPRETATION: Closure of planned 
obstetric services in low-volume hospi-
tals was not associated with an increase 
or decrease in frequency of adverse 
events during labour and delivery.

Methods
Setting
Our study population was drawn from deliveries in BC, 1998–
2014. We obtained abstracted medical chart data from the British 
Columbia Perinatal Data Registry, a quality-controlled database 
that contains records for more than 99% of deliveries in the prov-
ince, including home births.13 
Study design
We evaluated the effect of obstetric service closures using a 
within-community fixed-effects design.14 Specifically, we esti-
mated the change in the risk of adverse outcomes within each 
affected community before and after the closure, akin to includ-
ing an indicator variable for each community in a regression 
model. Using each community as its own control holds constant 
any time-invariant community characteristics (“fixed effects”) 
that are challenging to control for using measured covariates. In 
estimating these within-community changes, we control for tem-
poral trends in outcomes based on both closure and control com-
munities. These trends capture any changes in risk unrelated to 
service closures, which would bias a simple pre–post compari-
son15 (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.160461/-/DC1).
We used residential postal codes to identify deliveries to 
women living in the 25 communities affected by closure of 
planned obstetric services, based on Statistics Canada census 
subdivisions (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj. 160461/-/DC1). This geographically 
defined cohort therefore included deliveries to all women living in 
the community irrespective of delivery location (e.g., women liv-
ing in the community before the closure who delivered elsewhere 
and women who delivered after the closure of the local hospital’s 
planned obstetric services). We excluded 2 communities because 
of their proximity to larger metropolitan areas and 2 communities 
because of uncertainty about the precise dates of service clo-
sures. Residential postal codes were also used to identify deliver-
ies to women living in the 12 communities in BC with low-volume 
hospitals (< 150 annual births) unaffected by obstetric service clo-
sures (Appendix 2), used to control for time trends. Appendix 3 
(available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj. 
160461/-/DC1) shows the geographic locations of communities in 
our study in relation to secondary and tertiary centres.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was a previously developed composite of 
10 adverse maternal or newborn events, the Adverse Outcome 
Index.16,17 The index was created through an expert consensus 
process as a tool for assessing the safety of labour and delivery. It 
measures the occurrence of any of the following: maternal death, 
intrapartum stillbirth or in-hospital death of a newborn weighing 
more than 2500 g and having a gestational age of 37 weeks or 
greater with no congenital anomalies or fetal hydrops, uterine 
rupture, maternal admission to the intensive care unit, birth 
injury, unanticipated operative procedure, neonatal admission 
to the intensive care unit for a duration greater than 48 hours for 
newborns weighing more than 2500 g and having a gestational 
age of 37 weeks or greater, 5-minute Apgar score less than 7, 
maternal blood transfusion, or third- or fourth-degree perineal 
tear. We expanded the definition of “neonatal admission to the 
intensive care unit” to include transfer within 24 hours of birth to 
a facility with a neonatal intensive care unit for a newborn weigh-
ing more than 2500 g with a gestational age of 37 weeks or 
greater. Variables used to calculate the index and provincial tem-
poral trends are detailed elsewhere.18,19
We also calculated a weighted Adverse Outcome Index, using 
previously published weights derived through a consensus pro-
cess by obstetricians and nurses on the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Patient Safety and 
Quality Improvement. The weights account for the severity of dif-
ferent components in the composite (750 points for maternal 
death, 400 points for uterine rupture, 100 points for maternal 
admission to the intensive care unit, 65 points for birth trauma, 
40 points for unanticipated operative procedure, 35 points for neo-
natal admission to the intensive care unit, 25 points for 5-minute 
Apgar score < 7, 20 points for blood transfusion, and 5 points for 
third- or fourth-degree tear).16 We further examined an (equally 
weighted) secondary outcome consisting of the most serious com-
ponents of the index: in-hospital maternal or perinatal death, uter-
ine rupture or maternal admission to the intensive care unit.19
Other secondary outcomes were as follows: maternal or new-
born transfer to a secondary or tertiary care hospital, maternal 
admission-to-delivery interval (hours), mode of delivery (cesar-
ean, instrumental delivery), use of obstetric interventions (epi-
dural, labour induction, labour augmentation) and out-of-
hospital birth (planned or unplanned).
Statistical analyses
We compared communities with and without a closure by calcu-
lating medians with interquartile ranges or counts with propor-
tions of the annual 1998 delivery volume, distance to next closest 
hospital with planned obstetric services, and Rural Birth Index (a 
tool that estimates the appropriate level of obstetric service pro-
vision for a given rural community). The Rural Birth Index com-
bines information on 3 key characteristics for predicting sustain-
ability of rural service: population birth numbers, social 
vulnerability and geographic isolation. A higher value indicates 
the need for a more specialized level of care, ranging from 0–7 
(maternity service level A: no local intrapartum services) and 7–9 
(service level B: local intrapartum services without operative 
delivery) to greater than 27 (service level E: specialist only mod-
els).20 The percentage of women delivering at their local hospital 
was calculated as the number of women delivering at their com-
munity hospital divided by the total number of deliveries to 
women residing in that community.
We estimated the change in probability of an adverse out-
come associated with service closure using a within-community 
fixed-effects linear probability model with robust standard errors 
clustered at the community level. We focused our interpretation 
on the absolute scale (i.e., adverse events per 100 deliveries), 
which is more relevant than relative risks for assessing the popu-
lation burden or benefit of the policy change.21 We examined

median rather than mean maternal antepartum length of stay (in 
hours) because of its highly skewed distribution. Conditional 
fixed-effects Poisson regression was used to estimate relative 
measures of effect (incidence rate ratios [IRR]). Calendar time 
was modelled as a linear term or a restricted cubic spline with 3, 
4 or 5 knots, and the final fit was chosen as the approach that 
provided the best model fit for the control and preclosure data 
(using the Akaike information criterion). We did not adjust for 
maternal characteristics such as pre-pregnancy body mass index 
or parity, because we found no evidence that these characteris-
tics changed concurrently with service closure.
To estimate the effect of closure on the weighted Adverse 
Outcome Index we used a fixed-effects Poisson regression 
model, in which the total count of severity points associated with 
an adverse event was modelled as the outcome. Confidence 
intervals for IRRs were estimated through bootstrapping with 
1000 samples. We compared the IRRs produced by a severity-
weighted model with IRRs from a fixed-effects Poisson model 
where the adverse outcome was not weighted for event severity. 
Analyses were conducted using Stata 13.
Sample size estimation
Conservatively assuming a fixed sample size of 3810 deliveries in the 
3 years before and after closure (based on 1998 delivery volumes in 
affected hospitals), and an Adverse Outcome Index rate of 7%,18 we 
estimated that we would have 80% power to detect a risk ratio of 0.7 
before versus after closure (although we hypothesized that closures 
could either increase or decrease risks).
Ethics approval
The University of British Columbia/Children’s and Women’s Health 
Centre of British Columbia Research Ethics Board approved this 
study (H15-02026).
Results
Our cohort included 20 874 deliveries to women residing in a com-
munity that experienced a closure of planned obstetric services (n = 
11 949) or a similar-sized community without service closure (n = 
8925). Among women residing in a community affected by a service 
closure, 5796 deliveries (48.5%) occurred before the closure.
Compared with communities without service closures, com-
munities with closures performed 19 fewer deliveries per year in 
1998 and were 28 km (14 min) closer to the next community with 
planned obstetric services (Table 1). There were no differences in 
the median Rural Birth Index classifications, which corresponded 
to a service level B (scores of 7–9), or “local intrapartum services 
without operative delivery.” The proportion of women delivering 
at their local hospital was 7 percentage points higher in commu-
nities without a closure compared with the preclosure rate in 
affected communities (57% v. 50%, respectively). The small frac-
tion of women (3%, n = 169) delivering at their local hospital fol-
lowing service closure reflects provision of emergency rather than 
planned obstetric services. There were no meaningful differences 
in the pregnancy characteristics of women living in communities 
with versus without closures, nor pre- versus postclosure within 
communities experiencing a closure (Table 1).

The proportion of women delivering at their local hospital de-
creased over time in both affected and control communities. In 
communities without closures, 73.9% of women delivered at 
their local hospital in 1998; by 2014, the proportion was 51.6%. 
After accounting for this time trend, the mean estimated change 
associated with closure was a decrease of 20 percentage points 
(95% CI –11 to –28). Less than 57% of women delivered at their 
local hospital, even before the closure of local obstetric services, 
as well as in control communities (Table 1).
We found that closure of planned obstetric services was not asso-
ciated with a significant increase or decrease in risk of adverse events 
in the Adverse Outcome Index (–0.4 excess adverse events per 100 
deliveries, 95% CI –2.0 to 1.1), or in the risk of the more severe com-
ponents of the index (Table 2). Likewise, closures were not signifi-
cantly associated with changes in risks of maternal or newborn trans-
fer, mode of delivery, labour induction, labour augmentation or 
out-of-hospital birth. There were small increases in antepartum stay 
(0.6 h, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.0 h) and use of epidural analgesia (3.4 per 100 
deliveries, 95% CI 0.4 to 6.3) following service closure.
When all components of the Adverse Outcome Index were 
weighted equally, the IRR associated with service closures was 
0.94 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.18). However, the severity-weighted rate 
ratio indicated a protective effect of hospital closure (IRR 0.58, 
95% CI 0.36 to 0.89) (i.e., the adverse events that did occur 
following the service closure were, on average, less severe). We 
did not conduct further statistical testing to evaluate differences 
between groups in the index subcomponents owing to the small 
numbers of each adverse event (Table 3).
Interpretation
In this study, closure of planned obstetric services in 21 communi-
ties in BC did not affect the frequency of adverse outcomes or se-
rious adverse outcomes during labour and delivery. We found 
that more than 40% of women in these communities were deliver-
ing elsewhere even before the closure of local planned obstetric 
services (as well as in control communities). With many women 
already delivering elsewhere, this may partially explain the lack of 
an overall effect on labour and delivery outcomes following local 
service closures. However, we estimated that the severity of ad-
verse events decreased after closures. Because of the small num-
ber of each adverse event in the composite, it is challenging to de-
termine which specific components were responsible for this 
decrease, independent of underlying time trends.
Service closures were associated with increased use of epi-
dural analgesia and median length of antepartum stay. We spec-
ulate that the increase in use of epidural analgesia reflects in-
creased access to anesthesia services in larger centres, whereas 
the longer antepartum stay could reflect altered admission 
thresholds given longer driving times to return home.
The abrupt closure of obstetric units in Philadelphia, Pennsyl-
vania, has previously been evaluated.22–24 Zhang and colleagues24 
found that the closures were associated with a substantial increase 
in neonatal birth injuries, with increases most pronounced among 
mothers living in communities with closures. Allen and colleagues25 
compared time trends of iatrogenic preterm delivery, fetal growth 
restriction and perinatal mortality in regions of Nova Scotia, Canada,

that were affected to varying degrees by hospital closures. They 
found no consistent evidence that outcomes were worse in regions 
with more closures, although effects of closures could have been dif-
ficult to detect in overall comparisons of regions.25
Numerous studies have evaluated the relative safety of smaller 
hospitals by comparing maternal and newborn outcomes accord-
ing to the residence of mothers.1,2,9,10,12 However, this approach is 
prone to confounding from unmeasured differences in the risk 
profiles of women who live in smaller versus larger communities. 
In our study, we overcame this concern by using communities as 
their own controls. Our access to population-based postal code 
information and use of a methodologically rigorous design 
allowed us to isolate the effect of the closure from underlying time 
trends in adverse outcomes. Finally, our medical chart–based data 
allowed us to examine clinically detailed outcomes most affected 
by intrapartum care (instead of outcomes such as preterm birth or 
perinatal death, which, although important public health indica-
tors, may be less sensitive to care during labour and delivery).
Limitations
Drawing causal conclusions from the within-community fixed-
effects design relies on the assumption that, conditional on the 
estimated time trends, no other changes occurred at the time of 
the service closure that could also have influenced outcomes.15 
The design also assumes that changes in adverse outcomes over 
time in the communities with and without closures are reasonably 
similar. We found no evidence to invalidate this assumption, but 
year-to-year variability in rates based on relatively small numbers 
limited our ability to compare pre 
closure trends. The severe out-
comes we examined were rare, and we were likely underpowered 
to detect small to moderate (but still important) effects of the clo-
sures for these secondary outcomes. The weights used in our 
severity-weighted outcome reflect expert opinion only, and as a 
result, the clinical and public health relevance of these analyses 
are highly dependent on the extent to which the weights reflect 
the values of local women and care providers.
Conclusion
The frequency of adverse events during labour and delivery was 
not significantly higher or lower following closure of planned 
obstetric services in low-volume hospitals.
Decisions on closure of obstetric services in small communi-
ties are complex, and our study provides evidence on clinical out-
comes only. Closures have other important consequences for 
communities, women and families. Rural women without access 
to local maternity services are 7 times more likely to experience 
moderate to severe delivery-related stress than women with local 
services.26 Financial issues (e.g., costs of relocating before deliv-
ery, travel expenses) as well as lack of continuity of care were 
identified as reasons.26 Lack of a local hospital creates anx 
iety 
because of poor winter road conditions while travelling to the 
hospital for delivery and returning with a newborn postpartum.27

Travel for parous women often requires separation from older 
children and difficulties in arrangement of child care.27 These con-
siderations, informed by other research, must all be weighed 
when making decisions on closures of planned obstetric services.
