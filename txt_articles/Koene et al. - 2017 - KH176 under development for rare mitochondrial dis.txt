Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial disorders are a clinically, biochemically and genetically heterogeneous group of multi-
system diseases, with an unmet medical need for treatment. KH176 is an orally bio-available small molecule under
development for the treatment of mitochondrial(−related) diseases. The compound is a member of a new class of
drugs, acting as a potent intracellular redox-modulating agent essential for the control of oxidative and redox pathologies.
The aim of this randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded phase 1 study was to test safety, tolerability and
pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of KH176 in healthy male volunteers. Putative effects on redox
related biomarkers were explored.
Results: KH176 was well tolerated up to and including a single dose of 800 mg and multiple doses of 400 mg b.i.d.
for 7 Days. However, when the QT interval was corrected for heart rate, administration of single doses of 800 and
2000 mg and at a multiple dose of 400 mg KH176 had marked effects. Post-hoc analysis of the ECGs showed
clear changes in cardiac electrophysiology at single doses of 800 and 2000 mg and multiple doses of 400 mg
b.i.d.. At lower doses, detailed ECG analysis showed no changes in electrophysiology compared to placebo.
Exposure-response modelling of the cardiac intervals revealed an exposure range of KH176 without effects on
cardiac conduction and provided a threshold of 1000 ng/mL above which changes in intervals could occur.
After single- and multiple-dose administration, the pharmacokinetics of KH176 was more than dose proportional. KH176
accumulated to a small extent and food only slightly affected the pharmacokinetics of KH176, which was considered
clinically irrelevant. Renal excretion of unchanged KH176 and its metabolite represents a minor pathway in the
elimination of KH176. As expected in healthy volunteers no effects on redox biomarkers were observed.
Conclusion: The study deemed that KH176 is well tolerated up to single doses of 800 mg and multiple doses of 400 mg
b.i.d. and has a pharmacokinetic profile supportive for a twice daily dosing. Only at high doses, KH176 causes clinically
relevant changes in cardiac electrophysiology, including prolonged QTc interval and changes in T wave morphology. A
Phase 2 clinical trial (100 mg b.i.d., orally) has been conducted recently of which the final results are expected Q1 2018.

 Background
Over 1150 genes have been identified to encode for pro-
teins located in the mitochondria [1]. Mutations in these
genes, like those involved in oxidative phosphorylation,
can cause mitochondrial disease. This genetic heterogen-
eity is one of the numerous factors explaining the
phenotypic variability seen in mitochondrial diseases, in-
cluding many mono-, and multisystem phenotypes in
childhood and adulthood [2]. Although the rate of de-
terioration is variable, the disease course is often pro-
gressive and the prognosis of some of the childhood
diseases is even very poor [3]. With a minimal preva-
lence rate of about 1 in 4300–5000 [4], there is a clear
need for therapy for these devastating disorders.
Currently, there is no effective treatment for most
mitochondrial disorders and the care for these patients
is mainly supportive [4]. Many treatment strategies have
been attempted, including gene therapy, exercise and
nutritional therapy, modulation of cell signalling and the
manipulation of reactive oxygen species [5–7]. The latter
has been subject of many studies and clinical trials
[8, 9], since it has been recognised that cell redox imbal-
ance play a key role in the pathogenesis of many of the clin-
ical manifestations of mitochondrial diseases [5, 10–12].
KH176 (and its active metabolite KH176m) is a po-
tent
intracellular
redox-modulating
agent
targeting
these reactive oxygen species. Preclinical studies in
patient-derived fibroblasts with a wide variety of gene
defects
associated
with
mitochondrial
dysfunction
show that KH176 was able to protect these cells against
a toxic perturbation of their redox balance. Additio-
nally, a 4 week- in vivo study showed that KH176 was
able to significantly improve motor performance and
gait in Ndufs4−/− mice [13]. Translating preclinical re-
sults to an anticipated human dose indicates that
100 mg b.i.d. is expected to be within a putatively effi-
cacious range.
This study aims to test the safety, tolerability and
pharmacokinetics of KH176 in human subjects after
oral administration of a single dose (SD) as well as
multiple doses (MD), to obtain a safe and putatively
efficacious dosing regimen of KH176 for a next Proof
of Concept study.
Methods
The compound as described herein was tested in a
double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-
centre study in healthy male volunteers (Fig. 1). The sin-
gle ascending dose (SAD) part has a partial alternating
crossover design (n = 6) and the multiple-ascending
dose
(MAD)
part
has
a
sequential
group
design.
Randomization was 2:1 (2 active for each placebo). All
subjects received placebo once.
Study population
For both the SAD and MAD study, healthy men be-
tween 18 and 55 years of age with a body mass index
(BMI) of 18.0–30.0 kg/m2 were recruited. Good physical
and mental health was established by medical history,
physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital
signs
recording,
and
results
of
clinical
chemistry,
hematology and urinalysis testing within 4 weeks prior
to the first dose. Participants agreed to stay in the clinic
during the first 24 h after dosing (SAD) and during Day
8 (MAD) and refrain from multivitamins and dietary
supplements and grapefruit juice at least 14 Days prior
to the first dosing, from alcohol 7 Days prior to the first
dosing, from strenuous exercise, beverages containing
quinine and from xanthine-derivates (e.g. caffeine) 48 h
prior to the clinical admission and during the study.
Only non-smokers (at least 3 months) were eligible for
inclusion. Exclusion criteria included: clinically signifi-
cant allergies, positive serology for hepatitis B surface
antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, HIV1 of HIV2, history of
alcohol or drug abuse in the past 2 years, history of can-
cer, surgery or active illness of the gastro-intestinal tract
that might interfere with absorption, intake of any
enzyme-affecting drugs in the 30 days prior to the first
dosing period, use of any medication, herbal medicine or
dietary supplement from 14 days prior to the first dosing
(except for occasional paracetamol intake), participation
in a trial of an investigational product in the 2 months
prior to the first dosing, blood donation in the 2 months
prior to the first dosing, history of hypersensitivity or
idiosyncrasy to any of the components of the investiga-
tional drug, positive drug, alcohol or cotinine test at
screening or admission, clinically relevant abnormal la-
boratory findings, ECG recordings, vital signs or physical
or mental findings at screening, and/or major surgery
and/or prolonged immobilisation (more than 2 weeks)
within the 3 months prior to the screening.
Study drug
KH176 (or ((S)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-N-((R)-piper-
idin-3-yl)chroman-2-carboxamide
hydrochloride;
Patent
WO2014011047 A1) was available as a powder for recon-
stitution with saline. Placebo was a NaCl salt/bitrex powder
for reconstitution with saline.
Study design
The trial had a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-
controlled, single-centre design. For the SAD part, a par-
tial alternating crossover design and for the MAD part a
sequential group design was applied.
In the SAD part the effects of 6 single orally adminis-
tered ascending doses of KH176 or placebo were investi-
gated alternately dosed to two groups of 6 healthy male
subjects (4 active; 2 placebo per group). Dose escalation
Koene et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:163 
Page 2 of 12
 to the next dose level was done after evaluation of the
safety and the first 24-h pharmacokinetic results of the
previous dose. The single dose part included a food
effect investigation; the 100-mg dose was administered
following the intake of a high calorie/high fat breakfast
to the same subjects as who received this dose in fasting
conditions. In the MAD study 3 multiple ascending
doses of KH176 were administered for 7 Days to 3 se-
quential groups of 6 healthy male subjects each (4 active;
2 placebo per group).
Formulation and administration
KH176 (solution) was administered orally. Single doses
of 10, 30, 100, 300, 800 and 2000 mg were administered
in the SAD part. Multiple oral doses of 100, 200 and
400 mg were administered b.i.d. for 7 Days in the MAD
part. The starting dose for the SAD was ~150 fold lower
than the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) of
both dogs and rats. Anticipated exposures at this starting
dose were just below the Minimum Anticipated Bio-
logical Effect Level (MABEL). Placebo (an in taste and
appearance matching oral liquid) was also administered
orally on one occasion in the single-ascending dose part
and b.i.d. for 7 Days in the MAD part.
Safety assessment
Safety was assessed using standard vital signs, clinical
laboratory results for blood chemistry, haematology and
urinalysis, continuous cardiac telemetry and a 12-lead
ECG at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h post dosing. The
changes from baseline (pre-dose assessment on Day 1)
for body weight, physical examinations, vital signs,
ECG-variables and clinical laboratory variables were
determined for each time point. Treatment-emergent
laboratory and ECG abnormalities as well as adverse
events were monitored throughout the study, up to
28 Days after the last study drug intake.
Since preclinical studies in rats demonstrated the
occurrence of phospholipidosis, the presence of phos-
pholipidosis was determined by the concentration of di-
docosahexaenoyl (22:6)-bis(monoacylglycerol) phosphate
(di-22:6-BMP) in a midstream urine sample and by elec-
tron microscopy of peripheral leucocytes at Day 1 and 7
in the MAD study [14].
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were taken
pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after
dosing (SAD) and pre-dose at Day 1, 2, 4, 7, and post-
dose at Day 1 and Day 7 at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 h
after dosing (MAD). All samples were stored at <−70 °C
until analysis. Quantification of KH176 and its metabol-
ite KH176m were performed using a validated LC-MS/
MS method with good (max 15–20% CV) selectivity,
precision and accuracy, little carry over effect, good sta-
bility of both the solutions and the samples.
For mean value calculations, all values below the limit
of quantification (LOQ) were set to zero. If <50% of the
values at a given time point were below the LOQ (BLQ),
these values were set to zero for calculation of the mean
value. If >50% of the values at a given time point were
BLQ,
no
mean
value
was
calculated.
The
non-
compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed
using
Phoenix, Version
6.3
(Pharsight
Corporation,
Mountain View, CA, USA). Plasma concentration-time
profiles of KH176 and its metabolite KH176m were de-
termined for the SAD and MAD part and for trough
concentrations in the MAD part. The PK parameters

 were calculated on the basis of the actual blood sam-
pling time points relative to dosing. Selected pharma-
cokinetic parameters (Cmax, tmax, t1/2, AUClast and
AUC0-inf) following single-dose administration and se-
lected pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, tmax, t1/2,
AUCtau, the accumulation factor (Racc) and time to
reach steady state) following multiple dose adminis-
tration were determined. In urine, the percentage of
dose excreted in urine was determined for the single-
and multiple-dose administration.
Pharmacodynamic analysis
Blood samples for pharmacodynamic analyses were
taken pre-dose and at 3, 6 and 24 h post dosing at Day 7
(MAD). All samples were stored in −80 °C until analysis.
Quantification of oxidized and reduced glutathione was
performed at York Bioanalytical solutions using a previ-
ously described validated method [15]. Change from
baseline in the concentrations of oxidized and reduced
glutathione (GSH/GSSG) was calculated.
ECG post-hoc analysis
During
the
interim
evaluations
at
dose
escalation,
machine-read ECGs and telemetry in the clinic indicated
a prolongation of the corrected QT interval by KH176,
as indicated by QTcB, the Bazett corrected QT interval,
particularly strong at high dosages of the compound.
Correction of the QT interval is indicated to allow com-
parison between QT values over different heart rates,
since the QT interval shortens with higher heart rates.
In the post-hoc analysis, we have used the Fridericia
formula (QTcF = QT/RR1/3), which is more reliable
compared to the QTcB outside the range of 60–
100 bpm. The goal of this post-hoc optimization study
was to repeat the machine-read ECG assessment with a
highly automated computer-assisted approach where in
addition to the re-evaluation of standard intervals (PR,
QRS and QT intervals), a set of parameters describing
repolarization morphology were considered. The morph-
ology indices were the TpTe interval (interval from the
T wave apex to the end of the T wave), the TpTe/QT
index (the ratio between the TpTe interval and the QT
interval), Tamp (the amplitude in microvolt units of the
T wave) and TSym (an index of repolarization morph-
ology based on the symmetry of the T wave).
ECGs were digitally recorded using a Schiller AT104
ECG machine (500 Hz, 1 μV). Cardiac interval measure-
ments were performed on the Global Superimposed
Median Beat (GSMB), a methodology that allows mea-
surements that consider each of the 12 individual me-
dian beats [16]. This measurement methodology ensures
that the PR, QRS, and QT interval are measured from
the earliest onset in any lead to the latest deflection in
any lead. Cardiologist overview of the computer-based
measurements is based on the superimposed (over-
lapped) display of the individual median beats, to assure
measurements are performed at the earliest onset of any
viable lead to the latest offset of any viable lead.
The RR interval used for heart-rate correction of the
QT interval (QTcB) was based on all the beats in the ten
second recording.
Other cardiac parameters were computed from the 12-
lead vector magnitude VM (e.g. the square root of the
sum of squares at each digital sample) computed from
the individual median beats. On the VM lead, the apex
of the T wave is placed and used to compute the TpTe
interval (using the end of the T wave from the GSMB)
and the T wave amplitude (height in microvolt of the
VM T peak from the isoelectric line). Additional file 1:
Figure S1A shows an example with all the calipers in-
volved: the GSMB leads are drawn in black and the VM
lead is drawn in green. T wave symmetry index was
computed using a proprietary
approach based on
Gaussian Mesa function modeling (GMF) of the repolari-
zation waves [17]. Briefly, the ascending and descending
phases of the VM T wave are modeled by two independ-
ent half-Gaussian curves (see Additional file 1: Figure S1).
The standard deviations of these functions (σ1 and σ2)
and indicators of the ascending/descending speed and
their ratio is an index of symmetry (TSym = σ1/σ2;
TSym = 1 for a perfectly symmetric T wave, TSym <1 for
slow-ascending/fast-descending T waves, T > 1 for fast-
ascending/slow-decending T waves).
For the pre-dose (baseline) ECGs, all parameters per
time point were calculated as the averages of the tripli-
cate ECGs. Computation of QTcB and QTcF was per-
formed using the RR interval averaged from the total
ECG acquisition duration (10 s) and in the case of the
triplicate ECGs is based on the average QT and average
HR of the replicate ECGs.
The over-reading cardiologist provided a clinical inter-
pretation for each ECG at each time point. Each ECG
was classified as Normal, Abnormal Clinically Insignifi-
cant (ACI), or Abnormal Clinically Significant (ACS),
based on absolute changes in QTc interval (> 450 ms),
changes from baseline (>60 ms) and the presence of
secondary arrhythmias. Results of this post-hoc analysis
were used for an exposure-response evaluation for the
changes in the electrophysiological parameters as a func-
tion of the concentration of KH176.
Ethics
All studies were conducted at the Drug Research Unit
Ghent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines established by
the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH).
An independent medical ethical committee approved the

 protocol (University Hospital of Ghent). All participants
have signed informed consent prior to their enrolment.
This trial has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov prior
to the conduction of the study (NCT02544217) and
retrospectively at 23–06-2017 (ISRCTN43372293).
Statistical analysis
The tolerability and safety data were compared between
KH176 and placebo using descriptive summary statistics.
Pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
parameters
were analyzed by treatment group on the per-protocol
set and summarized using descriptive statistics. Dose
proportionality of log transformed Cmax and AUC values
was explored graphically. The effect of food on the
pharmacokinetics was explored by calculating the geo-
metric means and 90% confidence interval of the ratio
(fed/fasted) for AUC and Cmax. The pharmacodynamic
endpoints were analyzed
descriptively by treatment
group on the per-protocol set as a change from baseline.
Pharmacokinetic-effect modelling of PK/ECG data was
explored visually and by an exposure-response evalu-
ation for the changes in the electrophysiological parame-
ters as a function of the concentration of KH176.
Results
Study population
For the SAD part of the study, 14 healthy male subjects
divided in two groups of 7 subjects were included. Two
subjects prematurely withdrew from the study after dos-
ing period 2 for non-medical reasons. For the MAD part
of the study, 18 healthy male subjects divided in 3
groups of 6 subjects were included. Two subjects prema-
turely withdrew from the study for non-medical reasons
and were replaced. There were no protocol violations in
either part of the study that excluded subjects from
the analysis set(s) and, therefore, all subjects included
in this study were evaluable for pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability. For demo-
graphics, see Table 1.
Safety and tolerability
Following administration of a single dose of KH176 to
subjects in the fasted state (SAD study), a total of 43 ad-
verse events (AEs) were reported by 14 subjects (56%;
Additional file 2: Table S1A). The majority of AEs (35)
was rated as mild in severity whereas there were 6 mod-
erate and 2 severe AEs. Up to and including the 800 mg
dose, no relationship between the presence of placebo or
KH176, the dose of KH176 and the number or the sever-
ity of reported AEs could be discerned (Additional file 2:
Table S1). However, 28 of the 43 reported AEs were re-
ported by subjects in the highest dose group of which 6
and 2 were of moderate and severe severity, respectively.
The 2 severe AEs were nausea and headache. Following
administration of placebo, a total of 7 AEs were reported
by 3 subjects (25%). Of note, 4 of these AEs were rated
as moderate in severity. Headache was the most fre-
quently reported AE with a total of 7 subjects including
2 placebo subjects. The majority of AEs occurred inci-
dentally, i.e., was reported by only 1 or 2 subjects.
Adverse events reported by more than 2 subjects and
not by placebo subjects were psychiatric symptoms, diz-
ziness, oral paraesthesia and prolonged QT at the elec-
trocardiogram and telemetry. All these events occurred
in the highest dose group (2000 mg dose) and were re-
ported by 3 subjects each.
Following administration of a multiple doses of KH176
(MAD study), a total of 29 AEs were reported by 10 sub-
jects (83.3%; Additional file 2: Table S1B). The majority
of AEs (27) was rated as mild in severity whereas there
were 2 moderate AEs, one each in the 200- and 400-mg
dose groups. No relationship to dose and the number of
reported AEs or severity could be discerned. Headache
was the most frequently reported AE with a total of 11
subjects including 5 placebo subjects reporting this AE.
Except for skin irritation, all AEs occurred inciden-
tally, i.e., were reported by only 1 or 2 subjects in the
KH176 treated subjects. Skin irritation was also re-
ported by 2 placebo subjects and, therefore, no AE
was reported by more than 2 KH176-treated subjects
and not by placebo subjects.
The level of di-22:6-BMP was variable at baseline.
There was no increase in di-22:6-BMP for the treatment
groups versus placebo (change from Day 1 to Day 7
0.74–2.50; −1.44–1.32 and −0.69-1.46 ng/mg creatinine
for group III, IV and V respectively and −0.92-4.31 ng/
mg creatinine for placebo). No increased prevalence of
the presence of phospholipidosis in either granulocytes
or monocytes as evaluated by electron microscopy was
present in the KH176-treated group versus the placebo-
treated group.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
SAD study
The
plasma
concentrations-time
profiles
of
KH176
(Fig. 2a) showed that the median tmax was between 0.75
and 1.5 h after administration and varied little with dose.
Thereafter, the KH176 concentrations decreased in a
biphasic way. The t1/2 was approximately 10 h and var-
ied little among dose groups (Table 2). The elimination
phase following administration of a dose of 10 mg was
not well characterized and, therefore, t1/2 could not be
estimated for this dose only.
The shape of the plasma concentration-time profiles
of KH176m (Fig. 2b) resembled that of the parent com-
pound but concentrations were lower. Cmax was reached
at the same time or slightly later when compared to
KH176 (Additional file 2: Table S2). Thereafter, KH176m
Koene et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:163 
Page 5 of 12
 plasma concentrations decreased in a biphasic way and
the elimination was characterized by a t1/2 of approxi-
mately 16 h without any notable effect of dose.
In the presence of food, the absorption of KH176 was
slower as indicated by a median tmax that shifted from
approximately 1 h in fasted condition to 2.5 h in fed
condition for both analytes (Table 2). Exposure under
fed conditions in terms of AUC0-inf increased slightly for
KH176 whereas that to KH176m decreased slightly
(AUC0-inf 1.28 (90%CI 1.12–1.45) for KH176 and 0.90
(90%CI 0.57–1.41) for KH176m). The t1/2 was not
affected by food.
A graphical exploration for dose-proportionality of the
pharmacokinetics of KH176 indicated that with increas-
ing single dose there was a more than proportional in-
crease in Cmax and AUC0-inf (Fig. 3).
Regardless of the dose and when combining KH176
and KH176m, approximately 16% of the administered
dose was excreted in urine. Unchanged KH176 accounted
for approximately 12%.
MAD study
Visual inspection of the mean trough concentration-
time curves indicated that steady concentrations of
KH176 were reached by Day 4 of dosing (of note: Day 4
was the first time point of measurement of trough
values; Fig. 2c).
The plasma concentration-time profiles of KH176
after single- and multiple-dose administration were simi-
lar. Peak concentrations were attained between 1 and
2 h after drug administration (Table 2). Following attain-
ment of Cmax, the KH176 plasma concentrations de-
clined rapidly. KH176 accumulated as shown by values
for the accumulation index between doses varying from
2.17 to 2.65.
After
multiple
dosing,
the
shape
of
the
plasma
concentration-time profiles of KH176m resembled that
of parent compound but concentrations were lower
(Fig. 2d). On Day 7, Cmax was reached at approximately
the same time when compared to KH176. After multiple
dosing, the accumulation of the metabolite KH176m
was less pronounced when compared to that of KH176
as indicated by values for the accumulation index vary-
ing from 1.19 to 1.86.
A graphical exploration for dose-proportionality of
the pharmacokinetics of KH176 after multiple dosing
indicated that with increasing multiple doses there
was a more than proportional increase in Cmax and
AUCtau, which was most pronounced at the 400 mg
dose (Fig. 3).
On
Day
7
and
when
combining
KH176
and
KH176m, the %dose excreted in urine varied from
18.0
to
25.1%
between
doses.
Unchanged
KH176
accounted for 14.0 to 18.1%.

 Pharmacodynamic analysis
No significant alterations in the GSH/GSSG ratio were
observed.
Posthoc analysis QTc prolongation
A QTcF prolongation was present after single-dose admin-
istration of 800 and 2000 mg KH176 (see Additional file 3:
Figure S3 for a representative example). The largest median
baseline increase observed was 46.8 ms (1 h post-dose),
whereas the
largest
individual
change
was 64.7
ms
(2000 mg group; Additional file 4: Figure S2). This QTcF
prolongation was associated with moderate but clear
changes of morphology, namely a reduction of the T wave
amplitude, a prolongation of the TpTe interval (in both ab-
solute terms and relatively to the QT interval), and the
symmetry (shape) of the T wave. At lower doses, KH176
does not seem to affect repolarization. Changes were
also observed on other cardiac intervals: the QRS
interval increased but only at a dose of 2000 mg,
whereas the PR interval increased progressively also
at lower doses of KH176.
The MAD part of the study showed the same effects,
particularly for the 400 mg dose group (Additional file 4:
Figure S2). A dose of 100 mg b.i.d. had no effect on
QTcF and the time curve for this dose was indistinguish-
able from placebo. On Day 4 and later, administration of
200 mg b.i.d. increased QTcF and a median maximum
change from baseline was observed on Day 5 of 13 msec.
A further increase in QTcF was observed with a dose of
400 mg b.i.d. and the median maximum change from
baseline at trough of 29 msec was observed on Day 6.
Clinically relevant changes were observed in at the
peak concentrations in 2 individuals in the 2000 mg sub-
group and did not include appearance of notched and/or
bumps on any of the T-waves (all leads).
When the change in the TpTe interval is correlated
to the KH176-exposure, a clear dose-dependency is
observed (Fig. 4). In exposures lower than 500 ng/ml,
no significant prolongation of the TpTe interval com-
pared to placebo was observed. When increasing the
dose and the plasma concentration, the TpTe interval
increases. When the highest (non-tolerated) dose was

Discussion
Mitochondrial disorders are a devastating group of dis-
orders for which there is an urgent need for treatment
development. In preclinical studies, KH176 showed
promising properties in ameliorating the viability and
phenotype of cells and mice affected by mitochondrial
disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
tolerability,
safety,
pharmacokinetics
and
pharmaco-
dynamics of single- and multiple-ascending doses of
KH176 in healthy male subjects.
KH176 was well tolerated in doses up to 800 mg SD
and 400 mg b.i.d.. Headache was the most frequently re-
ported AE in both the KH176 - and the placebo treated
groups. Although there was no clear dose-response rela-
tionship for any of the adverse effects after single and
multiple dose administration, unforeseen markedly more
severe adverse events were reported after a single dose
of 2000 mg. At this dose, which is a factor 10 above the
anticipated daily human efficacious dose of 200 mg/
day, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and psychiatric dis-
turbances were reported, along with a prolonged cor-
rected QT time.
The shape of the plasma concentration-time profiles of
KH176 and its metabolite KH176m were similar after sin-
gle- and multiple-dose administration. The pharmacokin-
etics of KH176 showed several aspects. In particular, the
pharmacodynamics of KH176 were characterized by a i)
median tmax between 0.75 and 2.0 h, ii) terminal t1/2 of
about 10 h, iii) biphasic elimination, and a iv) more than
dose proportional increases in both Cmax and AUC.
In vitro, KH176 is metabolized by CYP3A4 and ex-
creted by the PgP efflux pump. We did not observe signs
for auto-induction in this study such as a decline in pre-
dose concentrations. Without wishing to be bound by
any theory, the more than proportional increase with
dose could be caused by saturation of the PgP efflux
pump for which KH176 is a substrate, as evidenced by

 the fact that half-life and clearance doesn’t change with
dose, but rather the availability seems to change with dose.
Up to 25.1% of an administered dose is excreted via urine
after multiple dosing. In steady state conditions at 100 mg
BID dosing the maximum concentration reached ranges
within 303–458 ng/mL for KH176 and 89.4–204 ng/mL
for KH167m (hence the maximum concentrations of these
active moieties ranged within 392.4–662 ng/mL).
Based on the results of the multiple-dose administra-
tion, steady state was reached at the first time point of
measurement of trough concentrations (Day 4). Based on
the estimated t1/2, it is expected that steady state will be
reached after 2 to 3 Days of dosing. KH176 was well toler-
ated in the presence of food, and the tolerability and safety
profile in the presence and absence of food was similar.
Although the point estimates (as well as the sample co-
variance) for both Cmax and AUC0-inf did not completely
remain within the usually accepted range of 0.8 to 1.25
(Table 2), no special measures are warranted regarding the
intake of KH176.
KH176 clearly modifies cardiac repolarisation in a
dose-dependent manner. QTcF prolongation was present
after single-dose administration of 800 and 2000 mg and
after multiple doses of 400 mg of KH176 b.i.d.. Post-hoc
studies showed that this QTcF prolongation was associ-
ated with changes in morphology and other cardiac
intervals. Detailed analysis of the ECGs during the
single-dose administration of 200, 100, 30 and 10 mg
and multiple oral doses of 100 and 200 mg b.i.d. showed
no cardiac electrophysiological abnormalities. Moreover,
the changes in the QTcF interval in the 800 mg KH176
single dose and the 400 mg b.i.d KH176 dose did not
reach the threshold for clinical relevance. The KH176
related changes in cardiac repolarisation include a re-
duction of T wave amplitude, a prolongation of the TpTe
interval and a reduction of the T wave symmetry index.
The reduction in T wave amplitude is largely explained by
changes in heart rate and also seen in the placebo group.
The prolongation of the TpTe interval and the reduction
on the symmetry index indicate a prolongation of the

 descending phase of the T wave. With pure hERG block-
ade, there is a direct relationship between increasing
plasma drug concentrations and the risk for torsades.
Importantly, although the specific T wave morphology
changes observed in this study have been associated with
the hERG potassium channel blockade [18], the IC50 of
hERG blocking for KH176 was 3 times higher than the
Cmax for the highest dose.
The clinical relevance of these changes in cardiac elec-
trophysiology are not clear yet. Notably, there were 2
subjects with a potentially clinically relevant change
(>60 ms) at the peak concentration after administration
of 2000 mg but no signs of arrhythmias or severe mor-
phologic changes (such as T wave bumps, notches, etc)
were observed. One should be cautious when translating
these healthy volunteer results to a patient population.
Since the sensitivity to torsades de pointes also depends
on many other factors including cardiovascular disease,
alcoholic liver disease, obesity, hypertension, and/or
electrolyte disturbances [19, 20], high concentrations
(e.g. more than a total daily dose of 1000 mg) of KH176
preferably should not be given to patients with any of
these risk factors. Moreover, until dose adjustments for
patients with concomitant medication (also metabolized
by CYP3A4) are determined, high concentrations (e.g.
more than a total daily dose of 1000 mg) of KH176
should preferably not be given to these patients either
since unpredictable pharmacokinetics will possibly lead
to plasma concentrations of KH176 above the currently
defined safety threshold.
Since the mechanism of KH176 is based on correction
of an abnormal redox balance, as expected, we did not
observe any pharmacodynamic changes in the healthy
male volunteers.
Comparing human exposure to mouse exposure in the in
vivo mouse studies and benchmarking human exposure to
in vitro activity of KH176 and metabolites indicates that
100 mg b.i.d. dosing results in a putatively efficacious expos-
ure to be tested in the following Proof of Concept study.
Conclusion
We conclude that administration of single doses up to
and including 800 mg or multiple doses up to 400 mg
b.i.d. for 7 days of KH176, a new small redox-modulating
molecule developed to treat mitochondrial(−related) dis-
eases and conditions, is safe and well tolerated in healthy
male volunteers. Although doses above the anticipated hu-
man efficacious dose could lead to prolongation of the
QTc interval with T-wave abnormalities, these changes
did not reach the threshold for clinical relevance in these
men. We have recently performed a phase 2 study in
m.3243A > G carriers, administering the anticipated effi-
cacious dose which did not lead to changes in cardiac
electrophysiology in healthy men (100 mg KH176 b.i.d).
Based on the study reported here, patients with cardiac
abnormalities were excluded for safety reasons.
