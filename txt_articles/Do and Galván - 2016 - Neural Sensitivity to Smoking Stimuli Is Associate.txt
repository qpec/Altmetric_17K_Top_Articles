Purpose: Adolescents initiate cigarette smoking at disproportionately high rates, despite wide-
spread knowledge of its health-compromising and long-term consequences. Psychosocial factors
clearly play a role in adolescent smoking initiation, but the role of the developing adolescent brain
in this behavior remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to determine whether greater
neural sensitivity to smoking cues in adolescents compared to adults underlies increased proclivity
toward smoking behavior and craving.
Methods: We addressed this question in a sample of adolescent (n ¼ 39) and adult (n ¼ 39)
smokers and nonsmokers by assessing craving in response to smoking videos that featured late
adolescents/young adults while participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Results: Ventral striatal activation mediated the relationship between video-induced craving and
subsequent desires to smoke following the scan in adolescent smokers only. We also found that
functional coupling between striatal and cortical regions was associated with increased craving in
adolescent smokers.
Conclusions: These novel results demonstrate that adolescent smokers may be more neuro-
biologically responsive to smoking stimuli than adults, perhaps because of ongoing ontogenetic
changes in adolescents that normatively occur in frontostriatal circuitry.

IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION
Neurobiological responses
to cigarette cues underlie
individual differences in
subsequent
smoking
urges, with ventral striatal
activity
mediating
the
relationship between cue-
induced
and
postscan
craving
in
adolescent
smokers only. Compared
to adult smokers, adoles-
cent smokers may be more
sensitive to photographs
or videos that depict ciga-
rette
smoking
behavior
due to ongoing ontoge-
netic changes in the brain.
The health-compromising risks of cigarette smoking are well
known [1,2]. Although the number of new cigarette smokers in
the United States declined in recent years, those who do start
using are younger than in previous generations, and use of other
tobacco products has increased [3,4]. Social influence clearly
plays a role in this increase [5,6], but it alone does not explain
high rates of initiation in adolescents. Evidence from rodent
studies suggests that normative developmental changes that
occur in the adolescent brain in regions associated with
addiction (and which are homologous in humans) may also
render it particularly susceptible to nicotine’s addictive proper-
ties [7e9]. Whether this phenomenon applies to human ado-
lescents has been surprisingly understudied. Evidence suggests
that smoking cues elicit a desire to smoke in adolescents [10,11]
and that this may be driven by increased activation in addiction-
related regions to smoking cues [12]. Research examining neural
responses to drug and alcohol cues have demonstrated similar
findings [13,14]. However, no previous study has asked the
developmental question: is the adolescent brain more respon-
sive to smoking cues than adults? Relatedly, does cue-induced
craving explain individual differences in the desire to smoke
among adolescents? Addressing these questions may help
elucidate why adolescents are at greater risk of smoking initia-
tion than adults.
Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

 Adolescents undergo significant brain development in fron-
tostriatal circuitry [15,16]. Regions in this circuitry, including the
ventral striatum (VS) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),
are particularly relevant to the current investigation as they are
implicated in cigarette cue reactivity in adults [17e19]. During
adolescence, the VS exhibits hypersensitivity to both the antici-
pation and receipt of rewards [20e22]. The DLPFC, implicated in
cognitive regulation of cigarette craving [23], undergoes pro-
tracted development through adolescence [24]. This neuro-
developmental
tempo
may
render
adolescents
especially
susceptible to the allure of appetitive smoking cues via increased
craving relative to adults. In this study, we used mediation ana-
lyses to test the hypothesis that greater neural responses to
smoking videos in adolescent versus adult smokers would be
predictive of greater craving in the adolescent smokers. In
addition, because neural regions typically work in concert with
other neural regions, we applied functional connectivity tools to
test the hypothesis that the relationship between activation of
regions that have previously been implicated in craving predicts
greater craving in adolescents.
Methods
Participants
Using community and Internet advertising, 78 right-handed,
English-speaking
(n
¼
39
postpubertal
adolescents,
13e18 years; n ¼ 39 adults, 25e30 years) smokers and non-
smokers participated (Table 1; Appendix for demographic
details). Participants aged 18 years provided written consent,
whereas participants <18 years provided assent and parents
provided written consent as approved by the University of Cali-
fornia Los Angeles Institutional Review Board. All participants
self-reported that they were free of developmental, neurologic,
or psychiatric disorders.
Smoking behavior
Participants completed two visits. At the intake session, par-
ticipants provided self-reports on cigarettes smoked per day,
smoking duration, and nicotine dependence via the Fagerstrom
Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) [25]. A revised FTND score
excluding statements less applicable to adolescents1 was calcu-
lated to controlfor smokingexperienceacrossage categories.There
were no significant differences in nicotine dependence scores be-
tween the revised FTND and original measure for adolescents and
adults; therefore, the revised FTND scores were used in analyses.
Demographic and smoking variables that differed between groups
(Table 1) were controlled in analyses, and implications for these
significant differences are provided in the Discussion.
Smoking status was measured by daily cigarette consumption
and verified by exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels (Smoker-
lyzer; Bedfront Scientific, Kent, UK) and urinary cotinine (NicA-
lert test strips; Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp., Hasbrouck Heights,
NJ) at both sessions (Table 1). Nonsmokers reported less than five
cigarettes in their lifetime and tested negative on tests. Smokers
reported five or more cigarettes daily for 6 months and met
qualification thresholds for exhaled CO (6 ppm) and urinary
cotinine (200 ng/mL) measurements. To capture naturalistic
smoking habits, smokers were not instructed to abstain before
the visit; self-reported time since last cigarette was controlled in
analyses. Participants with other tobacco use (e.g., e-cigarettes)
and comorbid substance use (except marijuana) were excluded
during telephone screening. Participants who reported regular
marijuana use were instructed to abstain for a minimum of
24 hours before test days; visits were rescheduled if the urine
drug screen tested positive for marijuana use (Instant-View
Multi-Panel 12-Test Drug Screen; ALFA Scientific Designs Inc.,
Poway, CA).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure
The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) occurred
w1 week after the intake visit. Before the scan, participants re-
ported hours since last cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana con-
sumption (Table 1). To assess baseline craving before the scan,
participants completed the ShiffmaneJarvik Withdrawal (SJ)
Scale, which asked about desire to smoke if freely permitted,
extent of missing a cigarette, the current urge to smoke, and
likability of smoking (1e7: 1 ¼ definitely not, 7 ¼ definitely) [26].
To assess post-task craving, participants rated the same items on
the Urge To Smoke (UTS) Scale (1e7: 1 ¼ definitely not; 7 ¼
definitely) following the scan [27]. Because cigarette craving was
assessed using two different measures, we focused on the four
items that were the same on the SJ and UTS scales; for each
measure of cigarette craving, the items were averaged, and the
composite was used for all analyses. The internal consistency of
these four items was high (abaseline ¼ .93 and apost-task ¼ .96).
Although adolescent and adult smokers differed in number of
hours since last cigarette (Madolescents ¼ 26.93, standard deviation
[SD] ¼ 59.01; Madults ¼ 6.96, SD ¼ 1.93; Table 1), there were no
differences in nicotine withdrawal levels (as measured by the SJ
Scale; Madolescents ¼ 3.01, SD ¼ .74; Madults ¼ 3.29, SD ¼ .58).
However, there was a significant difference in CO level between
adolescent and adult smokers (Table 1), which may be attributed
to age differences in hours since last cigarette.
Following the scan, participants listed the top five cues that
elicited the greatest craving and attributed a primary reason for
why
that
specific
cue
made
them
feel
like
smoking
(Supplementary Table 1). The same set of smoking cues featuring
late adolescents/young adults elicited similar craving ratings and
reasons for craving from both adolescent and adult smokers
(Appendix; Supplementary Table 1).
Cigarette cue reactivity functional magnetic resonance imaging
task
During the scan, participants completed a cigarette cue
reactivity task. So as not to rely on static smoking cues (e.g.,
photographs), this task consisted of sixteen 20-second videos
created by a local filmmaker that were developmentally appro-
priate, meaning that all the actors were young adults/late ado-
lescents; this is a novel contribution to this area of research.
Ecologic validity is difficult to approximate in a scanner, and
dynamic videos of real people smoking in realistic situations
presumably elicit a more salient response. Furthermore, youth
are more likely to attend to videos that feature individuals in the
same age group. The videos were classified as either neutral or
smoking cues (Figure 1A). Neutral cue videos depicted late
1 For example, “How soon after you wake up do you smoke your first ciga-
rette?” may not be indicative of adolescent dependence because parental
presence may preclude smoking first thing in the morning.

 adolescents in naturalistic settings (e.g., waiting at a bus stop),
whereas smoking cue videos matched neutral cue videos for
setting but also included the same actors smoking a cigarette
(e.g., waiting at a bus stop while smoking a cigarette). Both age
groups viewed the same set of videos, which were presented
randomly. Following presentation of each video cue, participants
provided a rating of cigarette craving on a Likert scale of 1e4
(Figure 1A). Craving ratings were averaged by cue type for group
comparisons. Response times of craving ratings to the cues were
also recorded.
Behavioral data analysis
A series of repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs)
with age group and smoking group as between-subject factors
were conducted in IBM Statistical Package of the Social Science
(IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh,
version 22.0., IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Socioeconomic status
(measured by maternal education), gender, hours since last
cigarette, smoking duration, cigarettes per day, and revised
Fagerstrom dependence scores were controlled in behavioral
analyses. Outliers (beyond two SDs of the mean) were excluded
from statistical analyses (n ¼ 2).
Magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition, processing, and
analysis
Scanning was performed on a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner.
Imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using FMRIB
Software Library (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). We analyzed our data
tofocus on the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal,
which primarily corresponds to the concentration of blood flow.
The BOLD effect is based on the fact that when neuronal activity is
increased in one brain region, there is also an increased amount of
cerebral blood flow to that area. Specifically, fMRI analyses
commonly focus on “contrasts” which refers to the contrast in
BOLD signal in one condition versus BOLD signal in another con-
dition (or a baseline condition). Four contrasts of interest were
modeled: smoking > baseline, neutral > baseline, smoking >
neutral, and neutral > smoking. In the present study, we focused
on activation observed in the smoking > neutral contrast.
Our primary aim in this study was to examine the effects of
smoking versus neutral cues on key nodes in the mesolimbic
system in the adolescent brain. First, we performed a voxelwise
analysis across all participants with the expectation that two a
priori regions of interest (ROIs), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc)
component of the VS and DLPFC, would show activation to the
smoking > neutral contrast. Next, we extracted the peak signals
from the VS and DLPFC for subsequent ROI analyses. See Appendix
for details on MRI parameters, processing, and modeling.
Psychophysiological interaction analysis
A psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis [28] was con-
ducted to determine whether craving during the fMRI task related
to functional coupling (strong correlation of activation patterns
between two regions) between regions involved in craving regu-
lation and the VS. We defined the seed region, defined as the region

kind of made me feel like smoking; (3) It really made me feel like smoking; (4) It really made me feel like smoking right now.] (B) Smokers reported greater craving to

Results
Behavioral results
There was a significant main effect of cue type [F(1, 29) ¼ 4.21,
p ¼ .05] and a significant cue type  smoking group interaction
on craving [F(1, 29) ¼ 50.19, p < .0001]. Participants reported
more craving during smoking (M ¼ 1.75, SD ¼ .88) versus neutral
cues (M ¼ 1.26, SD ¼ .44), with higher craving reports by smokers
(M ¼ 2.42, SD ¼ .80) compared to nonsmokers (M ¼ 1.10, SD ¼
.21) during smoking cues compared to neutral cues (Figure 1B).
There were no main effects of age group or significant in-
teractions with age group.
There was a significant main effect of smoking group on baseline
craving, where smokers (M ¼ 4.13, SD ¼ 1.53) versus nonsmokers
(M ¼ 1.08, SD ¼ .28) reported higher baseline craving [F(1, 30) ¼
15.57, p < .0001]. Post hoc tests showed no significant differences in
prescan craving between adolescent (M ¼ 3.80, SD ¼ 1.52)andadult
(M ¼ 4.44, SD ¼ 1.52) smokers. There was also a significant main
effect of smoking group on postscan craving, such that smokers
(M ¼ 4.05, SD ¼ 1.94) reported significantly higher craving ratings
relative to nonsmokers (M ¼ 1.02, SD ¼ .06) [F(1, 30) ¼ 27.00, p <
.0001]. Craving ratings to smoking cues were correlated with
postscan ratings for smokers (r ¼ .52, p ¼ .001), an effect driven by
the adolescent smokers (r ¼ .66, p ¼ .002; adult smokers, r ¼ .36,
p ¼ .13; Figure 1C). Ratings to neutral cues were correlated with
postscan ratings for adolescent smokers only (r ¼ .56, p ¼ .01).
Change in craving rating was a difference score calculated by sub-
tracting the mean average of prescan craving from the mean
average craving following the fMRI task. There were no significant
differences between adolescent (M ¼ .07, SD ¼ 1.64) and adult
(M ¼ .41, SD ¼ 1.31) smokers in overall change in craving levels.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging results
Our first analysis examined the main effects of smoking and
neutral videos. Whole-brain analyses show that both smoking
and
neutral
videos
activated
several
frontolimbic
regions
(Supplementary Table 2 lists significant regions). Because the
present study focused on the effects of smoking cues on regions
that are implicated in craving and which undergo the most
adolescent neurodevelopment, the remaining analyses were
conducted within a priori ROIs.
Based on the whole-brain analyses for the smoking > neutral
contrast, we used an ROI approach to extract the parameter es-
timates with the highest z-statistic from two a priori regions: the
NAcc (10, 20, 4; z ¼ 2.89) and DLPFC (30, 46, 32; z ¼ 3.75).
There was a significant main effect of smoking group on NAcc
activation, with less NAcc activation exhibited by smokers
(M ¼ .003, SD ¼ .03) compared to nonsmokers (M ¼ .01, SD ¼
.02) to the smoking versus neutral cues contrast [F(1, 30) ¼ 7.29,
p ¼ .01]. There was no significant main effect of age group. An age
group  smoking group interaction revealed greater NAcc acti-
vation in adolescent smokers (M ¼ .007, SD ¼ .04) relative to adult
smokers (M ¼ .01, SD ¼ .02) [F(1, 37) ¼ 3.84, p ¼ .05; Figure 2A].

than adult smokers (10, 20, 4; z ¼ 3.89). (B) Greater NAcc activation was associated with subsequent urges to smoke. (C) Nonsmokers exhibited significantly greater
activation than smokers in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; 30, 46, 32; z ¼ 3.57). Error bars represent standard error.

 NAcc activation was not correlated with hours since last cigarette
or prescan craving.
A significant main effect of smoking group on activation in the
DLPFC revealed that smokers (M ¼ .015, SD ¼ .04) showed less
DLPFC activation than nonsmokers (M ¼ .0098, SD ¼ .03) to
smoking versus neutral cues [F(1, 30) ¼ 8.88, p ¼ .004; Figure 2C].
There was no main effect of age group or interactions on DLPFC
activation. Greater DLPFC activation was correlated with lower
baseline craving and lower craving to the smoking cues and were
driven by the nonsmokers (baseline craving: r ¼ .38, p < .001;
craving to smoking cues: r ¼ .44, p ¼ .01), which means non-
smokers showed a stronger correlation between DLPFC and
craving than smokers. In smokers, greater DLPFC activation was
also significantly correlated with higher changes in craving
scores (r ¼ .36, p ¼ .02), an effect driven by the adolescent
smokers (adolescent smokers: r ¼ .24, p ¼ .04; adult smokers: r ¼
.19, p ¼ .42). DLPFC activation was not related to prescan or
postscan craving, daily cigarette use, hours since last cigarette, or
Fagerstrom scores.
To further investigate whether greater cue sensitivity in
adolescentsmokerswasalsopredictiveofcue-relatedandpostscan
craving, NAcc activation was regressed onto cue-induced craving
and postscan ratings. For adolescent smokers only, greater NAcc
activation significantly correlated with higher postscan ratings
following the scan (r ¼ .53, p ¼ .02) (Figure 2B) and a trend toward
greater acute craving to smoking cues (r ¼ .44, p ¼ .06).
We next conducted mediation analyses using a series of re-
gressions to determine whether NAcc activation mediated the
relationship between self-rated craving to the smoking videos and
greater change in craving scores (from prescan to postscan). For
adolescent smokers, the relationship between smoking cue-
induced craving reports and change in craving scores was
mediated by NAcc activation (Figure 3A). NAcc activation showed
significant relationshipswith both cue-induced craving (b ¼ .71, p ¼
.001) and change in craving scores (b ¼ .57, p ¼ .05). The stan-
dardized b coefficient between acute craving to the smoking cues
and change in craving scores (b ¼ .36, p ¼ .01) significantly
decreased when controlling for NAcc activation in adolescent
smokers (b ¼ .20, p ¼ .46). A Sobel test [29] confirmed that NAcc
activation mediated the relationship between reported craving
during the scanto smoking cues andchanges inpre-to-post urgesto
smoke among adolescent smokers (Z ¼ 1.85, p ¼ .05). These medi-
ation effects were not observed among adult smokers (Figure 3B),
nor were they significant for neutral cues in either group.
To further probe a possible mechanism for the relationship
between NAcc activation and postscan craving, we conducted a
post hoc PPI analysis using the NAcc as a seed region (Figure 4A).
Because NAcc activation only mediated the relationship between
acute craving to smoking cues and change in pre-to-post craving
for adolescent smokers, we restricted the analyses to this group.
Craving ratings to the smoking > neutral cues was associated
with increased functional coupling between the NAcc and mul-
tiple cortical regions (Figure 4B; see Appendix for a complete list
of regions), which included the superior parietal lobule (24, 52,
48, z ¼ 3.90) and paracingulate cortex (2, 12, 38, z ¼ 2.95). Next,
we investigated how functional coupling between the NAcc and
these cortical regions related to craving ratings from adolescent
smokers but only observed the following effects: increased
functional coupling between the NAcc and superior parietal
lobule was marginally associated with cue-induced craving to
smoking cues (r ¼ .40, p ¼ .09; Figure 4C) and increased func-
tional coupling between the NAcc and paracingulate cortex was
related to slower reaction times in response to smoking (r ¼ .51,
p ¼ .03) and neutral cues (r ¼ .43, p ¼ .07).
Discussion
The goal of this study was to characterize neural correlates of
cigarette craving in adolescent smokers and to determine if the
adolescent brain is more responsive to cigarette cues than
adults. The findings reveal four novel advancements to this
understudied question: (1) adolescent smokers report the same
level of craving in response to cigarette cues as adult smokers,
despite having a significantly shorter history of smoking; (2)
exposure to smoking cues predicts changes in subsequent
smoking urges in adolescents; (3) VS activation mediates the
relationship between acute craving during the cues and change
in craving levels from pre-to-post cue exposure in adolescent
smokers only; and (4) functional coupling between striatal and
cortical regions is associated with increased craving in adoles-
cent smokers.
In the present study, smoking cue-induced craving was par-
alleled with greater activation of the VS in adolescent versus
adult smokers and reduced activation of the DLPFC in smokers
versus nonsmokers. The data also highlight individual differ-
ences in smoking behaviors that may arise from an imbalance
between
reward-related
and
cognitive
control
systems
in
adolescence, such that adolescent smokers’ VS activation medi-
ates the relationship between acute craving to smoking cues and
the change in subsequent urges to smoke and was predictive of
increased functional coupling between the VS and frontal re-
gions. Thus, the developing brain may render adolescents, rela-
tive to adults, especially responsive to smoking stimuli.
Compared to nonsmokers, adolescent and adult smokers re-
ported greater craving in response to smoking cues. The similarity
in smoking cue-induced craving supports a recent finding which
found little discrimination between occasional and daily adoles-
cent smokers in cue-induced craving [11], suggesting that
adolescent and adult smokers may endorse similar craving

 patterns regardless of nicotine dependence severity. Under-
standing this relationship is important as increased craving levels
in response to smoking cues can lead to difficulty with cessation
attempts and relapse in smokers [30,31]. Thus, these findings
highlight adolescence as a critical period to target cessation
efforts.
Cue exposure has consistently been associated with increases
in craving and VS activity [12,32,33]. Our findings further sug-
gest that the relationship between acute craving to smoking cues
and subsequent changes in craving levels is mediated by acti-
vation of the VS in response to smoking cues in adolescent
smokers only; these effects may not be observed in adult
smokers because the smoking cues (featuring young smokers)
were not as engaging for them. This relationship highlights how
impactful exposure to smoking stimuli can be on eliciting neural
activity during adolescence relative to adulthood, which may
increase reward sensitivity and influence youth toward initiating
tobacco use.
In response to smoking versus neutral cues, smokers exhibi-
ted diminished DLPFC activation compared to nonsmokers; this
neural activation was positively correlated with higher changes
in pre-to-post craving scores, an effect driven by adolescent
smokers. These findings are intriguing in light of two previous
findings. First, a previous study reported that the DLPFC helped
cigarette smokers regulate their self-reported cigarette craving,
which was based on the observation that those who exhibited
decreased VS activation and increased DLPFC activation evinced
greater decreases in craving [23]. Other studies have also found
that the prefrontalestriatal pathway is involved in the control of
craving and habitual use of drugs [17,34]. Second, the DLPFC
shows a protracted neurodevelopmental trajectory that persists
through
adolescence
and
into
early
adulthood

smokers following smoking vs. neutral cues. (C) Increased coupling between the NAcc and parietal lobe was positively correlated with greater acute craving to smoking

 phenomenon that renders adolescents less adept than adults at
regulating limbic-based urges [36]. These two findings suggest
that the region individuals need most for successful inhibition of
craving (the DLPFC) is not yet fully engaged during adolescence,
which may preclude effective craving regulation in adolescent
smokers. Indeed, our findings underscore the meaningful rela-
tionship
between
frontostriatal
circuitry
and
craving
that
together predict subsequent smoking urges.
Acute craving to smoking cues was also associated with
increased functional coupling between the VS and cortical cir-
cuitry (i.e., strong correlation between activation in the VS and
activation in the cortex), which included the DLPFC, superior
parietal lobule, and motor cortices. Previous research delineating
this frontoparietal network reveals that the automaticity of
smoking behaviors is attributed to subconscious imitation trig-
gered by smoking stimuli [37]. Wagner et al. found greater cue-
related
activity
in
frontal
regions
implicated
in planning
manual actions. Similarly, increased functional coupling between
the VS and superior parietal lobe predicted greater craving
following smoking cues in the present study [38], suggesting that
action representation acquired while viewing others’ smoking
inspired later feelings of “wanting a cigarette.”
A major strength of this study is its examination of individual
differences in cigarette craving and neural sensitivity to smok-
ing cues and ontogenetic differences between adolescent and
adult smokers. However, a few limitations are noted. One lim-
itation is that participants were not instructed to refrain from
smoking beforehand, which may lead to variability in the last
cigarette smoked and initial craving levels. However, both time
since last cigarette and prescan craving were not related to
neural activity to the cues for adolescent or adult smokers. In
addition, there were ethnic and sex differences in our sample;
yet, these were consonant with the demographic makeup of our
target recruitment sites (i.e., greater Los Angeles). Because it is
challenging to recruit a large sample of smokers for an fMRI
study who do not present with comorbid substance use, we did
not have exclusion criteria for ethnicity or sex. However, these
group differences are consistent with the literature, such that
higher smoking prevalence is typically found in males [4,39]
and ethnic minority groups [40], with greater daily cigarette
consumption and smoking dependence found in adult smokers
[39]. Additionally, the statistically significant differences in
craving between neutral and smoking cues were admittedly
modest so the clinical application warrants a replication study
and further investigation. Finally, one alternative explanation of
the results is that they reflect neural desensitization in adults
(as long-time and heavier users) rather than hypersensitivity in
youth.
In conclusion, our data offer further evidence that neurobio-
logical responses to cigarette cues underlie individual and
developmental differences in subsequent smoking urges be-
tween adolescent and adult smokers. The finding that VS activity
mediated the effect of smoking cue-induced craving and changes
in pre-to-post craving was restricted to adolescent smokers,
which underlines the importance of targeting efforts toward
reducing smoking initiation during this highly sensitive devel-
opmental window.
