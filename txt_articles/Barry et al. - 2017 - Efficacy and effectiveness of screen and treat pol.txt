ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To assess diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for 
pre-diabetes and efficacy of interventions (lifestyle or 
metformin) in preventing onset of type 2 diabetes in 
people with pre-diabetes.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sOurCes anD methOD
Medline, PreMedline, and Embase. Study protocols 
and seminal papers were citation-tracked in Google 
Scholar to identify definitive trials and additional 
publications. Data on study design, methods, and 
findings were extracted onto Excel spreadsheets; a 
20% sample was checked by a second researcher. 
Data extracted for screening tests included diagnostic 
accuracy and population prevalence. Two meta-
analyses were performed, one summarising accuracy 
of screening tests (with the oral glucose tolerance test 
as the standard) for identification of pre-diabetes, and 
the other assessing relative risk of progression to type 
2 diabetes after either lifestyle intervention or 
treatment with metformin.
eligibility Criteria
Empirical studies evaluating accuracy of tests for 
identification of pre-diabetes. Interventions 
(randomised trials and interventional studies) with a 
control group in people identified through screening. 
No language restrictions.
results
2874 titles were scanned and 148 papers (covering 138 
studies) reviewed in full. The final analysis included 49 
studies of screening tests (five of which were prevalence 
studies) and 50 intervention trials. HbA1c had a mean 
sensitivity of 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.58) 
and specificity of 0.79 (0.73 to 0.84), for identification of 
pre-diabetes, though different studies used different 
cut-off values. Fasting plasma glucose had a mean 
sensitivity of 0.25 (0.19 to 0.32) and specificity of 0.94 
(0.92 to 0.96). Different measures of glycaemic 
abnormality identified different subpopulations (for 
example, 47% of people with abnormal HbA1c had no 
other glycaemic abnormality). Lifestyle interventions 
were associated with a 36% (28% to 43%) reduction in 
relative risk of type 2 diabetes over six months to six 
years, attenuating to 20% (8% to 31%) at follow-up in the 
period after the trails.
COnClusiOns
HbA1c is neither sensitive nor specific for detecting 
pre-diabetes; fasting glucose is specific but not 
sensitive. Interventions in people classified through 
screening as having pre-diabetes have some efficacy 
in preventing or delaying onset of type 2 diabetes in 
trial populations. As screening is inaccurate, many 
people will receives an incorrect diagnosis and be 
referred on for interventions while others will be falsely 
reassured and not offered the intervention. These 
findings suggest that “screen and treat” policies alone 
are unlikely to have substantial impact on the 
worsening epidemic of type 2 diabetes.

Introduction
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising globally; 422 
million adults are living with diabetes,1  and the num-
ber expected to die from its complications is predicted 
to double between 2005 and 2030.1  In the United King-
dom about 3.2 million people have type 2 diabetes, and 
by 2025 it is predicted that this will increase to five mil-
lion.2  This places considerable financial burden on the 
National Health Service (NHS). The healthcare cost of 
diabetes is estimated to be £23.7bn ($30.2bn, €28.2bn), 
a figure expected to rise to £39.8bn by 2035-36.2 
 
Preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes has become an 
international priority.
There are two approaches to prevention: screen and 
treat, in which a subpopulation is identified as “high 
risk” and offered individual intervention, and a popula-
tion-wide approach, in which everyone is targeted via 
public health policies on environmental moderators3 
 
(sociocultural influences, socioeconomic influences, 
transport, green spaces). Finland is taking a multi-level 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Type 2 diabetes is increasingly common; its prevention is an international health 
priority
There is no agreement on how best to define or detect “pre-diabetes” (that is, high 
risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future)
Trials in people with pre-diabetes have shown that the onset of type 2 diabetes can 
be delayed or prevented with lifestyle measures or metformin
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This is the first systematic review to assess both the diagnostic accuracy of screening 
tests for pre-diabetes and the efficacy of interventions in those detected by screening
As different tests for pre-diabetes define vastly different populations, large numbers of 
people will be unnecessarily treated or falsely reassured depending on the test used
“Screen and treat” policies will benefit some but not all people at high risk of 
developing diabetes; they might need to be complemented by population-wide 
approaches for effective diabetes prevention

approach to prevention by using both strategies.4  In 
contrast, the UK’s National Diabetes Prevention Pro-
gramme5 
6  follows Australia7  and the United States8 in 
placing the emphasis on a screen and treat approach.
There is international inconsistency on how to iden-
tify individuals at high risk of diabetes, to the extent 
that “a transatlantic trip may cure or cause diabetes 
simply as a result of small but important differences in 
diagnostic criteria.”9 In the US, the American Diabetes 
Association criteria recommend a diagnosis of pre-dia-
betes in people with a fasting plasma glucose concen-
tration of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L or HbA1c of 39-47 mmol/mol 
(5.7-6.4%). WHO (World Health Organization) and the 
International Expert Committee recommend a fasting 
plasma glucose cut off of 6.0-6.9 mmol/L and HbA1c of 
42-47 mmol/mol (6.0-6.4%). The term pre-diabetes is 
used to encapsulate these ranges and implies that if 
individuals do not take action they will develop diabe-
tes (though in reality this is not always the case). Since 
the recognition of pre-disease states (impaired glucose 
tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and raised HbA1c), 
trials of lifestyle interventions have been associated 
with reduced or delayed onset of type 2 diabetes.10 
 
Studies of screening and intervention programmes in 
real world settings, however, are sparse.11  Women with 
a history of gestational diabetes have a sevenfold risk of 
developing diabetes postpartum.12  These women might 
not be captured by the pre-diabetes umbrella term 
because many have normal glycaemic markers at the 
six week postpartum review and then fail to attend for 
annual review thereafter.13-17  Gestational diabetes is 
common in certain minority ethnic groups,18 and in 
deprived multi-ethnic areas a history of this condition 
could identify a considerable proportion of individuals 
who could benefit from preventive interventions.
We sought to inform national and local policymaking 
on prevention of type 2 diabetes by asking two ques-
tions. Which (if any) screening test should be used to 
identify people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes? 
What is the efficacy of preventive interventions (life-
style and/or metformin) in those identified as high risk 
by screening?
Methods
search strategy
We sought to identify all diagnostic accuracy and preva-
lence studies focusing on laboratory assessed HbA1c and 
fasting plasma glucose (as recommended by the UK NICE 
(National Institute for Health and Care  
Excellence)19) as 
screening tools. Capillary glucose and HbA1c point of care 
testing were excluded because of the lower reliability of 
these tests. For intervention studies we included trials 
whose participants were aged ≥18 and had been identi-
fied as being in one of the “at risk” groups (impaired glu-
cose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, raised HbA1c, or 
a history of gestational diabetes). We studied two kinds 
of intervention: lifestyle programmes and metformin, 
compared with a control, in any setting, and that 
included weight change, change in glycaemic index, or 
incidence of diabetes as an outcome measure. Animal 
studies, molecular biology studies, studies related to 
children, surgical interventions, and interventions 
related to drugs other than metformin were excluded.
The study was undertaken from December 2014 to 
June 2016. It was commissioned by policymakers in a 
London borough with high prevalence of type 2 diabe-
tes, and concerns about applicability to a real world set-
ting helped shape the review questions. With assistance 
from a specialist librarian, three searches were under-
taken: one for screening tests for pre-diabetes, another 
for intervention trials, and a third to identify studies 
relating to the prevention of type 2 diabetes in women 
with a history of gestational diabetes. Appendix 1 shows 
the full search strategy. Search terms (MESH and free 
text) included test, screening, pre-diabetes, impaired 
glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, gestational 
diabetes, post-partum, ethnic groups, metformin, and 
lifestyle. EB manually extracted relevant titles from this 
dataset and reviewed abstracts to  
identify papers for full 
review. SR checked a random sample of 750 abstracts 
(20%). Disagreements were resolved by discussion. 
Bilingual colleagues translated non-English papers and 
extracted data with guidance from the research team.
Diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis
Diagnostic accuracy studies were tabulated by index 
and reference test. Raw data for the meta-analysis on 
true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false 
negatives were extracted directly or calculated with the 
sensitivity and specificity information given in the 
paper. Additional data were extracted on population 
demographics, ethnicity, and diagnostic criteria used. 
We pooled studies in which HbA1c was the index test and

an oral glucose tolerance test was the reference stan-
dard. We presented these data separately for studies 
using the WHO criteria and studies not using these crite-
ria (notably, some studies used the more stringent Amer-
ican Diabetes Association criteria to define pre-diabetes). 
We also pooled studies with the fasting plasma glucose 
as the index test and 2 hour glucose tolerance test as the 
reference test. Again we examined the data as a whole as 
well as separately by diagnostic criteria.
We undertook a bivariate diagnostic random effects 
meta-analysis20  to pool study level estimates of diagnostic 
accuracy using the reitsma function from the R21  package 
mada.22 In each case, we reported the pooled sensitivity, 
false positive rate, false negative rate, and 95% confidence 
intervals. We plotted the bivariate summary receiver oper-
ating curve (sROC) over points representing study esti-
mates of sensitivity and false positive rate, weighted by 
study size, and summarised the discriminative ability of 
each test using the area under the ROC (receiver operating 
characteristics) curve (AUROC) and the partial AUROC 
(which restricts the area to the observed false positive 
rates). Statistical heterogeneity was described with I2 sta-
tistic for bivariate meta-analysis.23
Defining at risk population
To compare differences in the at risk population identi-
fied by each test, we undertook a prevalence analysis. 
Using eulerAPE v324 we analysed raw data from preva-
lence studies to assess the degree of overlap in the pop-
ulation identified as abnormal by each test. This 
analysis highlights the differing number of people eligi-
ble for interventions, depending on which test and cri-
teria are used. We created Venn diagrams with the area 
of each ellipse proportional to the prevalence.
intervention trial review and meta-analysis
Data extracted into Excel files from intervention trials 
included participants’ demographics, type of interven-
tion, intervention length, and primary and secondary 
outcomes. A second Excel sheet was used to tabulate 
results, including a clinically significant reduction in 
BMI (1 kg/m2) or weight (2 kg), clinically significant 
improvement in glycaemic markers (normoglycaemia, 
or reduction in fasting plasma glucose by 0.5 mmol/l, 2 
hour glucose tolerance by >1 mmol/L, HbA1c to <42 
mmol/mol), differences in incidence of diabetes 
between groups and whether this was significant.25 We 
included in the meta-analysis any trial that collected 
data on incidence of diabetes. Data were extracted 
directly from the publications and processed with 
RevMan software. Because of the heterogeneity of the 
data we used a random effects model to create forest 
plots showing relative risk of developing type 2 diabetes 
after lifestyle interventions and metformin compared 
with usual care or no additional intervention.
assessment of study quality, applicability, and bias
To assess the quality and applicability of the test papers 
we used the validated QUADAS-2 tool, designed for the 
evaluation of diagnostic accuracy papers.26  After the 
refinement steps as recommended by the creators, two 
authors (EB and SR) piloted, adapted, and refined the 
tool before it was applied to all the papers used in the 
meta-analysis (see appendix 2). The limitations of the 
intervention trials were assessed with the Cochrane risk 
of bias tool27  and the CONSORT checklist. One author 
(RN) used the GRADE principles to assess the overall 
quality of the evidence at outcome level.27 An additional 
assessment was conducted to examine the extent to 
which participants were involved in the design of the 
intervention, if feedback was sought, if non-enrolment 
reasons were given, and if interventions could be 
adapted to meet the individual’s needs.
Patient involvement
The review was conceptualised by a patient participation 
group led by the project lead (SV). Patients and clinicians 
raised questions on how best to identify those at risk of 
diabetes and explore how the Clinical Commissioning 
Group can support people in Newham to minimise their 
risk. In this way, patient and citizen involvement shaped 
the research question and methods of this review. The 
authors attended regular project meetings, reporting 
back the results of the review to the rest of the team, 
which included GP leads from the practices piloting 
interventions as well as the area lead for diabetes.

46 papers were extracted and used to construct the 
diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis. We reviewed 50 
unique intervention trials in full as well as publications 
related to these (protocol designs, subanalyses).
Diagnostic accuracy of tests for pre-diabetes
Table 1  lists the studies included in the diagnostic accu-
racy meta-analysis, with country of origin, population 
demographics, and QUADAS-2 assessment for bias and 
applicability. Figures 2 and 3 show the ROC curves con-
structed from data extracted from these trials. The 
pooled sensitivity of HbA1c at identifying abnormalities 
as defined by the oral glucose tolerance test was 0.49 
(95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.58); its specificity 
was 0.79 (0.73 to 0.84). Data were extracted from studies 
with both WHO and American Diabetes Association cri-
teria, as well as studies that determined the optimal 
diagnostic cut offs using the optimal sensitivity and 
specificity assessed from their own populations. AUROC 
are used to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of a 
test with a value of 1 equating to the perfect test. The 
calculated AUROC of the HbA1c was 0.71. A low sensitiv-
ity, however, leads to a high number of false negative 
results (that is, people incorrectly identified as not hav-
ing diabetes). When this is taken into account (with the 
partial AUROC calculation) the accuracy reduces to 
0.59. A subanalysis with the International Expert Com-
mittee/WHO criteria for HbA1c did not alter the sensitiv-
ity of this test.
Analysis of studies that used the fasting plasma glu-
cose as the index test found that this test had a sensitiv-
ity of 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.32) and 
specificity of 0.94 (0.92 to 0.96) at identifying impaired 
glucose tolerance. The analysis calculated an AUROC of 
0.72, with a partial AUROC of 0.42. A subanalysis of 
studies using the criteria implemented in the UK did not 
change the results.
The main source of potential bias from these studies 
was selection bias. In many studies, the sampling strat-
egy was unclear or participants self selected to attend 
for screening (for example, by answering an invitation 
or advertisement) rather than using a true population 
sample (random or consecutive). This was a particular 
concern in studies of follow-up after gestational diabe-
tes, which usually defined their populations as women 
who had attended for the oral glucose tolerance tests, 
with no information on those who did not attend. Most 
diagnostic accuracy studies scored well on the QUADAS 
scale for applicability, indicating that the populations 
of patients were similar to those tested in primary care 
settings and the use of diagnostic tests and their inter-
pretation was in keeping with our review question. 
These analyses showed a high level of heterogeneity, 
indicating that the test performs differently depending 
on population and setting. These are important consid-
erations in the assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of 
the tests with specified populations. The results of the 
QUADAS tool were used to undertake a sensitivity anal-
yses. Exclusion of studies at high risk of bias and outly-
ing studies did not significantly alter the results (tables 
A and B in appendix 4).
agreement between different diagnostic tests for 
pre-diabetes
Only five studies (table 2) gave a comparison of preva-
lence of pre-diabetes for all three tests (HbA1c, fasting 
plasma glucose, 2 hour glucose tolerance test). With 
current International Expert Committee and WHO 
guidelines, 27% of the populations studied were identi-
fied as having “pre-diabetes” by one of the tests (of 
whom 48% had a raised HbA1c alone, fig 4); if American 
Diabetes Association criteria for the HbA1c is applied to 
the same cohort, this figure was 49% (of whom 71% had 
a raised HbA1c alone, see fig F in appendix 4). There was 
low agreement between the three tests on which indi-
viduals were classified as having pre-diabetes. Figure 4 
illustrates this limited overlap. Substitution of the 
American Diabetes Association criteria for both the oral 
glucose tolerance test and HbA1c increased the degree of 
overlap between the test results, but this doubled the 
estimated prevalence of pre-diabetes (fig 5).
interventions to prevent diabetes in screen detected 
pre-diabetes
Fifty trials met our eligibility criteria10 
78-126  (tables A-D 
in appendix 3 summarise the methods and results of 
these studies). Only 25 of the trials (21 of lifestyle inter-
ventions alone, two of metformin alone, and two 
assessed both) had the necessary information available 
to be included in the meta-analysis. All trials were per-
formed in adults identified as at risk of developing dia-
betes defined by the oral glucose tolerance test or had a 
history of gestational diabetes. There was heterogeneity 
in the number of participants in each trial (ranging 
from hundreds to thousands), length of interventions 
(four weeks to six years), intensity of intervention (fre-
quency of contacts), and delivery method. Agreement 
between raters on data extraction was 100%, with the 
exception of a single paper in which the authors did not 
distinguish between primary and secondary outcomes. 
Of 49 trials, 19 used the development of diabetes as a 
primary outcome measure. Some trials had begun with 
this outcome but during the trial substituted it for 
weight reduction and/or change in glycaemic markers 
because of low recruitment.78 Many studies showed dif-
ferences in weight and change in glycaemic markers 
between groups that were statistically but not clinically 
significant. At the end of the intervention, 20 of the 49 
trials showed a clinically significant reduction in weight 
between the groups, 15 showed a clinically significant 
improvement in glycaemic markers, and 23 showed 
some difference in favour of the intervention arm in the 
number of people developing diabetes, but this differ-
ence was significant only in seven of those trials (tables 
C and D in appendix 3).
Meta-analysis (fig 6 ) showed that lifestyle interven-
tions reduced the relative risk of developing diabetes by 
31% (95% confidence interval 15% to 44%) if the inter-
vention lasted six months to two years. This translates 
to 69 (95% confidence interval 56 to 85) out of 1000 peo-
ple in the lifestyle intervention group developing diabe-
tes compared with 100 out of 1000 without the 
intervention, or a number needed to treat (NNT) of 33

(95% confidence interval 23 to 67). Lifestyle interven-
tions lasting three to six years showed a 37% (28% to 
46%) reduction in relative risk, equating to 151 (129 to 
172) out of 1000 people in the lifestyle intervention 
group developing diabetes compared with 239 of 1000 
in the control group (NNT 12, 10 to 15). The overall rela-
tive risk reduction of developing diabetes after lifestyle 
interventions was 36%. Because of the small number of 
follow-up studies it is difficult to assess the reduction in 
risk of diabetes after the completion of lifestyle inter-
ventions. Our estimates show that relative risk reduc-
tion of developing diabetes fell to 20% (8% to 
31%))84

127-129  in the period after the trial (fig 7).
Meta-analysis evaluating the impact of metformin 
(fig 8 ) showed a relative risk reduction of 26% (95% 
confidence interval 16% to 35%) while participants 
were taking this drug, translating to 218 (95% confi-
dence interval 192 to 248) out of 1000 developing diabe-
tes while taking metformin compared with 295 of 1000 
not receiving this drug (NNT 14 (95% confidence inter-
val 10 to 22)). The benefits of metformin were assessed 
at the end of the trial periods once the participants had 
been taking the drug for a prespecified length of time. 
There were no follow-up studies examining for per-
sistence of benefit once metformin had been discontin-
ued, but the US DPP study did show some improvements 
in reduction in incidence of diabetes with long term 
metformin use.130
The main sources of potential bias (as estimated by 
Cochrane risk of bias tool) were selection bias (lack of 
allocation concealment) and attrition bias (where 
authors used per protocol analysis instead of an inten-
tion to treat analysis to assess changes in outcome mea-
sures), potentially leading to overestimation of the 
benefits of the intervention. To provide the most com-
prehensive synthesis of relevant studies we did not 
pre-specify a minimum threshold of methodological 
quality for included studies. However, we performed a 
sensitivity analysis removing the studies at high risk of 
bias to test whether the exclusions of some trials 
changed the overall findings. Omission of these did not 
significantly change the overall results (for example, 
removal of the 2006 study by Ramachandran and col-
leagues106 did not significantly alter the relative risk 
reduction).
Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the evi-
dence to be of moderate quality for progression to type 
2 diabetes with metformin versus control, low quality 
for lifestyle interventions of one to two years and three 
to six years’ duration versus control, and very low qual-

risk (oral glucose tolerance test) is not widely used in 
practice. A further downgrade was because of the sta-
tistical heterogeneity in two out of the four outcomes 
(lifestyle interventions with a three to six year fol-
low=up (I2=45%; downgraded once) and follow-up after 
intervention (I2=82%; downgraded twice)). This high 
degree of heterogeneity is probably because of differ-
ences in sample size and length and intensity of inter-
ventions included in this analysis, but the small 
number of trials contributing to the follow-up analysis 
after intervention limited our ability to explore this 
using subgroup analysis. Seven papers10

described at least one element of patient and partici-
pant involvement. Most interventions were inflexible, 
with a one-size-fits-all approach.
gestational diabetes
Nine trials assessed lifestyle interventions in women 
with a history of gestational diabetes (see tables B and 
D, appendix 3). These focused on diet, exercise, and 
increased uptake of breast feeding. None showed a sig-
nificant reduction in incidence of diabetes between the 
intervention and control groups. Attrition rates were 
high in these trials. Only three trials had sufficient data 
to be included in the meta-analysis.
Withdrawal and attrition rates
Sixteen studies had the necessary data available to 
assess withdrawal and attrition rates.10 78 81 92 96 97 101 103

126  Of the pre-diabetic population iden-
tified, only 27% went on to complete the trial (the rest 
were either not eligible, declined to participate, or with-
drew from the intervention (fig 9)). Therefore, relative 
risk reductions calculated from intervention trials 
reflect risk improvements seen in a limited proportion 
of the total pre-diabetic population.

This systematic review, commissioned by local policy-
makers who wanted to identify an effective “screen and 
treat” strategy for prevention of type 2 diabetes in an 
area of high prevalence, included 99 studies and pro-
duced four main findings. Firstly, the diagnostic accu-
racy of tests used to detect pre-diabetes in screening 
programmes is low. The most commonly used test 
(HbA1c) is neither sensitive nor specific; the fasting glu-
cose test is specific but not sensitive. Low sensitivity 
results in a high number of people with false negative 
results, resulting in a large number being falsely reas-
sured. Secondly, the diagnostic tests identify different 
pre-diabetic population groups with limited overlap. If 
the American Diabetes Association criteria are used 
instead of WHO ones, the prevalence of those with a 
diagnosis of pre-diabetes doubles. Thirdly, both indi-
vidually targeted lifestyle interventions and metformin 
have some efficacy in preventing or delaying the onset 
of type 2 diabetes, though the protective effect of the for-
mer is greatest in longer interventions (three to six 
years) and attenuates with time from intervention. We 
have only moderate to very low confidence in these esti-
mates, however, because study quality was often low. 
Finally, in women with a history of gestational diabetes, 
the evidence base for lifestyle interventions in prevent-
ing progression to type 2 diabetes is currently weak.

Most intervention trials included in this study used 
the oral glucose tolerance test to identify their study 
population. In practice, however, this test is not widely 
used. It is time consuming, requires fasting and inges-
tion of a sugary drink (which many people find 
unpleasant), and, because of variability within an indi-
vidual, needs to be done twice. HbA1c is estimated on a 
single non-fasting blood test but varies by ethnicity, 
leading to overestimation and underestimation of the 
result,131-133 and could be inaccurate in the presence of 
haemoglobinopathy. The fasting plasma glucose test is 
a single blood test but requires the person to have 
fasted for several hours so is impractical for mass 
screening.
Accuracy of tests depends on cut-off points. By using 
the International Expert Committee and WHO criteria 
for defining pre-diabetes, HbA1c correctly identifies only 
half the individuals with an abnormal result on an oral 
glucose tolerance test but also assigns the label of 
pre-diabetes to large numbers of individuals with a nor-
mal test result. Different diagnostic criteria result in a 
different estimate of the prevalence of pre-diabetes; this 
will have implications for which (and how many) indi-
viduals are eligible for lifestyle interventions. Further-
more, people identified with HbA1c might not have the 
same glycaemic abnormality as those entered into trials 
on the basis of an oral glucose tolerance test and might 
respond differently to interventions.
Systematic reviews assessing progression from at risk 
states to diabetes have shown that those at most risk of 
developing diabetes had both impaired fasting glucose 
and impaired glucose tolerance; HbA1c showed a lower 
progression rate, similar to impaired fasting glucose 
alone.134-136  Those with a history of gestational diabetes 
have the highest rates of progression to diabetes, with a 
sevenfold increased risk after the first diagnosis12  and a 
70% cumulative incidence at 10 years.137
Of the 50 intervention trials included in this review, 
34 used surrogate endpoints (most commonly, weight 
loss) as their primary outcome. While most found sig-
nificant changes in these endpoints, authors rarely 
commented critically on the sustainability or clinical 
importance of these. Weight reduction has been shown 
to correlate poorly with the reduction in incidence of 
diabetes in some populations.106 The trials in our sam-
ple that did show a significant reduction in the defini-
tive endpoint of incidence of diabetes lasted between 
three and six years and were intensive in nature with 
individuals closely monitored.
While reduced incidence of diabetes seems to be pos-
sible if the interventions are intensive, the relative risk 
reductions seen in trials apply only to those who enrol 
and adhere to the intervention. Given the number of 
people who will not meet eligibility criteria or who 
decline or do not complete the intervention (fig 9), there 
is no scientific basis for extrapolating percentage risk 
reductions seen in trials to an equivalent reduction in 
incidence of diabetes across an entire community. Poor 
enrolment and completion of lifestyle interventions will 
limit the impact national prevention programmes will 
have on the overall burden of disease.
Comparison with other systematic reviews
This systematic review is the first to combine the analy-
sis of diagnostic accuracy with efficacy of interventions 
to give an overall estimate of how screen and treat poli-
cies could play out in populations, focusing on the end-
point of progression to type 2 diabetes. Edwardson and 
colleagues reviewed the effectiveness of risk scores and 
lifestyle interventions but did not assess their accuracy 
and the implications of their use.138  Other systematic 
reviewers performed a more in-depth analysis of 
improvement in surrogate endpoints such as weight 
loss and improvements in glycaemic markers.11 139-142 
 
A review carried out by the Institute for Clinical and 
Economic Review, however, raised concerns regarding 
the clinical importance and sustainability of improve-
ments of these surrogate markers.143
Other systematic reviews have found similar rela-
tive risk reductions in incidence of diabetes with life-
style interventions and metformin in study 
populations.142  Previous meta-analyses showed a 
higher relative risk reduction when they included 
only the most tightly controlled trials with stringent 
population enrolment criteria.144 145  In contrast, Pub-
lic Health England’s meta-analysis of translational 
studies identified a lower relative risk reduction 
because of the inclusion of pragmatic trials and 
observational studies146  and showed high levels of 
statistical heterogeneity between primary studies. 
One systematic review assessed UK based community 
and national interventions whose participants were 
the most deprived, vulnerable, and socially excluded 
(groups often omitted from clinical trials).147 They 
found that the effects of the interventions were small 
in these groups, with no evidence of long term reduc-
tion in incidence of diabetes.
Labelling people as having “pre-diabetes” has 
important personal implications (medicalisation, intru-
sive testing, and stigma) for people who might never go 
on to develop diabetes. Other scholars have voiced sim-
ilar concerns to those raised in this systematic review 
with regards to the danger of inaccurate classification 
and/or overdiagnosis with tests for pre-diabetes,148 
 
effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in the real 
world,149  and the limited impact of screen and treat pol-
icies in the absence of a complementary population 
based approach.150
Whether these interventions reduce longer term car-
diovascular morbidity and mortality remains unclear. A 
meta-analysis and systematic review undertaken by 
Hopper and colleagues151  agreed with our findings that 
lifestyle interventions can reduce the relative risk of 
developing diabetes. While these interventions did 
result in a reduction in incidence of cardiovascular 
events, this did not translate into a significant reduction 
in all cause or cardiovascular mortality. Long term fol-
low-up studies undertaken by the Chinese Da Qinq 
study and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study found 
that there was no significant difference between inter-
vention and control groups in first cardiovascular 
events127  or cardiovascular morbidity,152 though the 
study was not powered to detect such a difference.

meaning and implications for policy makers, 
clinicians, and academics
This review was requested by a local clinical commis-
sioning group in an inner London borough where the 
local diabetes prevention programme has largely con-
sisted of a community prescription initiative offered to 
people classified as having pre-diabetes with a BMI of 
27 or above, a history of gestational diabetes, or a QRISK 
>20%. Intensive interventions lasting years, such as 
those included in this systematic review, are not an 
option given its limited budget.
Our findings indicate that in settings such as this, 
screen and treat policies for pre-diabetes will benefit 
individuals who are “true positives” and have sufficient 
personal, family, and community resources to enable 
them to attend and comply with preventive interven-
tions. Incentivised diabetes prevention programmes 
will also pick up people with undiagnosed diabetes (an 
estimated 2-10% of those screened38 
78 
81 
116 
126), who can 
be offered timely management. A considerable propor-
tion of people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, 
however, will go on to develop the condition despite 
such programmes. These include people who test “false 
negative” and those who, despite testing positive and 
being offered a lifestyle intervention, lack the personal 
resources and social connections to support and sus-
tain lifestyle change.
Because of the low accuracy of screening tests and 
the limited reach of intervention programmes, policy-
makers might want to consider supplementing screen 
and treat policies with population based approaches 
aimed at entire communities. WHO, for example, pro-
poses “multisectoral action that simultaneously 
addresses different sectors that contribute to the pro-
duction, distribution and marketing of food, while con-
currently shaping an environment that facilitates and 
promotes adequate levels of physical activity.” 153
strengths and limitations
This is the first systematic review to assess both the 
diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pre-diabetes 
and the efficacy of interventions in those classified 
through screening as having pre-diabetes. Further-
more, it is a comprehensive review synthesising a 
large volume of international literature, including 
translations from languages other than English. It was 
inspired by a question by front line policymakers and 
focused on producing a practical answer to that ques-
tion. As such, and unlike much secondary and pri-
mary research, it fulfils the important criterion of 
“usefulness.”154
The main limitation of the review was the number of 
exclusions because of incomplete data available in pub-
lished studies. Despite efforts to contact authors, we 
were unable to obtain the data needed to contribute to 
the meta-analysis in 18 potentially eligible papers. In 
the prevalence analysis, only five out of 28 papers com-
pared all three diagnostic tests, so these findings should 
be interpreted with caution. A high proportion of stud-
ies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of fasting 
plasma glucose did so in participants with a history of 
gestational diabetes—a bias that could influence the 
generalisability of this analysis.
Only half of the intervention studies were included in 
the meta-analysis because the lengths of the trial or 
intervention were too short to be able to capture inci-
dence of diabetes. Additionally, the analysis of the 
reduction in the risk of diabetes at various follow-up 
periods was limited because of the small number of pri-
mary studies that performed follow-up analyses. We 
recommend that primary studies of diabetes prevention 
programmes should be resourced to undertake long 
term follow-up to assess for sustained benefits includ-
ing incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular morbidity, 
and mortality.
Intervention studies that used risk scores to identify 
their population instead of blood tests do exist155 but 
were outside the scope of this systematic review. Fur-
ther synthesis of interventions using wider population 
eligibility criteria could provide additional insights into 
the benefits of these.
Future work
On the basis of the findings of this review, we suggest 
three avenues for further research. The first is prag-
matic real world effectiveness and cost effectiveness 
studies of interventions for pre-diabetes that have 
already been shown to be efficacious in trials.149 156 
 
Studies of the translational gap between evidence from 
randomised trials and real world uptake and impact is 
always important157  but particularly so when the “real 
world” seems unlikely to be able to replicate the condi-
tions (for example, health literacy, language fluency, 
and comorbidities of target population; intensity and 
duration of intervention; completeness of follow-up) 
that characterised the trials with the most positive 
results.149 
158  These real world studies should deal with 
the impact on behaviour of individuals who test posi-
tive for pre-diabetes (only a third of whom would be 
predicted to engage with interventions; fig 9) and the 
costs (to both participants and the health service). More 
specifically, effectiveness and cost effectiveness studies 
should explore the implications of screen and treat pro-
grammes for both commissioners and providers—
including the opportunity costs of spending a limited 
budget on a programme for which a variable proportion 
of the pre-diabetic population would be eligible for and 
engage with depending on locality.
The second avenue for further research is the evalua-
tion of population level and/or health system interven-
tions. Individual lifestyle choices are constructed by 
sociocultural, political, and economic influences, 
which might be more effectively deal with by using pop-
ulation-wide strategies such as protection of green 
spaces, increased walkability of the environment, 
affordable leisure activities, improved food labelling, 
independent regulation of food nutritional standards, 
regulation on food advertising, affordable fruit and veg-
etables, and school based programmes. Such system-
atic structural approaches dealing with “upstream” 
influences on the pathogenesis of diabetes require well

governments to improve the health of communities and 
could be vital components of a multifaceted long term 
primary prevention strategy.159
Currently, only a tiny fraction of the literature on dia-
betes prevention is informed by an appreciation of the 
social complexity underlying pathogenesis of diabe-
tes.160-162  The 2014 Foresight Report on Obesity was a 
model of good practice in teasing out the complex inter-
actions between genetic, physiological, psychological, 
sociocultural, economic, and political determinants of 
obesity; it provided a strong and consistent message 
that short term “behaviour change” interventions were 
unlikely to succeed in isolation.163 A comparable initia-
tive for type 2 diabetes could add richness to our current 
understanding of the condition and help to inform the 
design of evidence based strategies aimed at influenc-
ing its “upstream” determinants.
Conclusion
As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes rises inexorably in 
high, middle, and low income countries alike, contro-
versy continues to surround the questions of who is 
“at risk” and what preventive interventions to offer 
them. A screen and treat policy will be effective only if 
a test exists that correctly identifies those at high risk 
(sensitivity) while also excluding those at low risk 
(specificity); and an intervention exists that is accept-
able to, and also efficacious in, those at high risk. This 
review has shown that of the two screening tests for 
pre-diabetes that are available and acceptable to 
patients and clinicians, fasting glucose is specific but 
not sensitive and HbA1c is neither sensitive nor spe-
cific. Trial evidence suggests that lifestyle interven-
tions have a potential role in reducing individual 
progression to diabetes and could benefit those high 
risk individuals who have the motivation and social 
support to achieve sustained lifestyle change. Given 
that this is likely to be a limited proportion of the pop-
ulation identified with pre-diabetes, however, sub-
stantial research resources should be directed at the 
evaluation of upstream interventions aimed at the 
entire population.
