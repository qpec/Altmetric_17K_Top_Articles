Excessive food intake and the resulting excess weight gain is a
growing problem in human and canine populations. Dogs, due
to their shared living environment with humans, may provide
a beneficial model to study the causes and consequences of
obesity. Here, we make use of two well-established research
paradigms (two-way choice paradigm and cognitive bias test),
previously applied with dogs, to investigate the role of obesity
and obesity-prone breeds for food responsiveness. We found
no evidence of breed differences in food responsiveness due
to one breed being more prone to obesity than another. Breed
differences found in this study, however, can be explained by
working dog status, i.e. whether the dog works in cooperation
with, or independently from, humans. Our results also confirm
that overweight dogs, as opposed to normal weight dogs, tried
to maximize food intake from the higher quality food and
hesitated to do the task when the food reward was uncertain.
These results are very similar to those expected from the
parallel models that exist between certain personality traits and
being overweight in humans, suggesting that dogs are indeed
a promising model for experimentally investigating obesity in
humans.
1. Background
Just as in humans, obesity and overeating represent a steadily
growing problem in companion dogs. A recent survey from the
USA reported 34% of the examined dogs being overweight or
obese [1]. Three major factors which contribute to the excess fat

accumulation in dogs are: genetic predisposition, reproductive management (i.e. neutering of female
dogs) and suboptimal dietary/exercise conditions [2].
Among researchers, there is a vivid interest in the possible causes leading to obesity in dogs. First,
dogs cohabit with humans; therefore, members of the two species arguably experience approximately
the same external factors that cause obesity, which in turn gives less opportunity for differences caused
by gene–environment interactions. Because of this, dogs may serve as a more suitable model species
than rodents for investigating the causes and consequences of obesity in humans [3,4,5]. Second, the
negative effects of obesity on dogs’ health and welfare represent an important problem on its own.
In contrast to human studies (e.g. [6,7]), we mostly lack information on the behavioural/motivational
causes of overeating and obesity in dogs (but see [8]), while there is a growing body of literature about
the complex relationship between human obesity and certain psychiatric/mood disorders, including
depression (e.g. [9]). It was found that subjects with binge eating problems show characteristic symptoms
of weak inhibitory control and attention focus [10]. More importantly, several studies have shown that
obesity coincides with particular forms of cognitive biases, such as interest towards unhealthy food
items [11]. Cognitive biases may be tested by various methods (e.g. ‘emotional Stroop test’; ‘ambiguous
stimulus test’), where the core hypothesis is that an individual’s background affective state biases its
decision making in a task that is not directly related to the aforementioned inner state (e.g. [12]).
While genetic predisposition in dogs is considered an inevitable factor behind excess weight [13],
other factors including food-related behaviours, incentive value of food and the motivation to eat have
received very little attention in terms of canine obesity. In humans, the cognitive approach towards
obesity emphasizes the social implications of food as reward and focuses on the behavioural responses
to food rewards [14].
Although there is a vivid debate over the possible benefits and negative consequences of extrinsic
rewards on human creativity and motivation [15,16], the so-called primary rewards, such as food, drink
and positive social interactions, are considered almost unequivocally necessary for achieving higher
motivation level and learning performance in animals. Testing the effect of reward quality on dogs
proved to be surprisingly difficult, according to the last few decades’ ethological research. Although dogs
are definitely motivated in participating in tasks where food or object (e.g. toy) rewards are involved,
their performance is often more strongly affected by social factors such as human communicative actions
than the quality, quantity or the presence of a reward; therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that food
may not be the only motivation during different kinds of problem-solving tasks.
Food responsiveness (defined as part of someone’s appetite in terms of willingness to eat [17]),
voracity and indiscriminate food intake are commonly considered attributes of particular dog breeds,
which in turn provide a higher proportion of obese dogs than other, non-obesity-prone breeds. However,
there is a surprising lack of empirical studies that would investigate this assumption. In a controlled
feeding experiment, Hewson-Hughes et al. [18] tested whether dogs from five breeds (from toy to
giant size) chose differently, when they had the opportunity to ‘compose’ the macronutrient ratio of
their meals. Interestingly, all breeds showed a strikingly similar preference for a particular protein–fat–
carbohydrate ratio, although each breed ate quantitatively more than the actual nutritional requirement.
Recently however, Raffan et al. [19] showed in a questionnaire study, that dog owners experienced
marked differences among dog breed groups in the level of food responsiveness. According to this
survey, hounds and gundogs showed the highest food responsiveness, while pastoral and working
dog breeds were the least motivated to eat. This result is in line with studies investigating breed
differences in obesity (e.g. [20,21]). The hound and gun dog group (such as Labrador retrievers and
Basset hounds) were those that were most prone to obesity; meanwhile, working breeds (such as the
Doberman) were usually normal weight. Labrador retrievers were also the first dog breed in which a
gene mutation was found recently [13], affecting not only the accumulation of adipose tissue, but also
the food responsiveness of obese dogs (the latter result was derived via a questionnaire survey). Whether
this (or a similar) gene mutation can be found across a wide range of breeds is currently unknown [22],
but it provides a potential proximate mechanism for any breed differences in obesity.
In this study, we tested the behaviour of overweight and normal weight dogs from obesity-prone
and not obesity-prone breeds in two experiments in which food motivation plays an important role.
In the first experiment, we used the so-called two-way choice paradigm (e.g. [23–25]), in which the
experimenter indicates the location of hidden food reward with a pointing gesture. While at the indicated
location dogs can always find food reward with a low incentive value, depending on the experimental
group, the non-indicated (alternative) location contained either nothing or a high-quality reward. Dogs
did not know the content of the bowls; it was only revealed to them after they made a choice. Our
prediction was that overweight and obesity-prone dogs would perform more willingly in this test

paradigm, even for lower quality food. A complementary hypothesis, however, suggests a contrasting
effect, in that the higher food responsiveness of these dogs would result in a weaker point-following
response especially in that group where the non-indicated bowl contained a higher quality food.
In the second experiment, we used one of the so-called cognitive bias paradigms (e.g. [26,27]). This
method requires that subjects are first trained to expect at one site (left or right, consistently) the container
always being rewarded, while expecting it to be empty at the opposite site. Then, in the test phase, the
bowl is placed halfway between these two sites (i.e. at an ambiguous position). Based on the differences
in obesity proneness among dog breeds [13,20,21], we expected that overweight and obesity-prone dogs
would show higher/non-selective food responsiveness, so they will approach the ambiguous location
faster than the normal weight and non-obesity-prone dogs (i.e. they will show ‘positive expectancy’).
However, we can formulate an alternative hypothesis based on similarities in ‘pessimistic attitudes’
between human subjects with higher body mass indices [28] and obese dogs. This would predict
contrasting behaviour, i.e. overweight canine subjects would rather show a negative cognitive bias.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Subjects and assessment of body condition
Subjects were healthy adult family dogs from the following dog breeds: ‘obesity prone’ breeds—Beagle
N = 21, Golden Retriever N = 8, Labrador Retriever N = 14; ‘not obesity prone breeds’—Border Collie
N = 24, Mudi N = 24. Based on the similarity of breed histories, working functions and their proneness to
obesity (e.g. [29]), for the subsequent statistical analysis, we merged the Labrador and Golden Retrievers
to a single ‘Retriever’ group. All of the dogs that participated in the experiments were older than one year,
and accepted food in novel situations (a pre-requisite in our test). The body condition of the subjects was
determined by a combination of visual inspection and palpation (assessments were performed by one of
the authors with a DVM degree, O.T.). We used a three-level scoring system (thin, normal, overweight);
however, in our sample there were no thin dogs. Body condition score 2 (BCS 2) dogs were normal
weight: the ribs of the animals were easy to touch, they were covered by a thin layer of fat under the
skin and the waist section was also visible. BCS 3 dogs were overweight or obese: it was difficult or
impossible to locate the ribs because of the thick layer of fat under the skin and the waist section was
almost undetectable. In our sample, the following dogs were found to be overweight: Retrievers N = 8
(38%); Mudis N = 2 (8%); Border Collies N = 0 (0%); Beagles N = 6 (29%). With the exception of 12 dogs
(which we could not invite back to the second test), each subject was tested in the two-way object choice
and cognitive bias tests.
2.2. Experimental procedure
The subjects were tested indoors, in an empty experimental room, where only the dog, the dog’s owner
(O) and the experimenter (E) were present during the tests (figure 1). The tests were videotaped, and the
recordings were behaviourally coded using the Solomon coder (http://solomoncoder.com, by András
Péter) [30] and Observer XT (Noldus Information Technology).
Each dog participated in the two tests in a fixed order: first in the two-way object choice test and
then in the cognitive bias test. Testing in fixed order was necessary because the cognitive bias test may
form side bias in the subjects which would confound a subsequent two-way object choice test. Before the
two tests began, each dog participated in a pre-test (‘food preference’ henceforth), to ensure that without
any manipulation, dogs preferred high incentive value food over low incentive value food used in the
subsequent tests.
2.3. Pre-test for food preference
After entering the testing room, the subject had 1–2 min off leash to explore the experimental room.
When the time expired, two types of food were offered to the dog in a non-transparent plastic plate. One
of them was a low incentive value food (carrot or orange) and the other was a high incentive value food
(Frolic dog reward treat). The assigned locations of the different quality foods were marked by a piece
of tape, approximately 20 cm from each other. The relative position of the food items (i.e. left or right)
was randomly changed by turning the plate by 180°. The two food items were presented simultaneously.
The E offered the plate with the pieces of food to the dog holding the plate in her hand. The dog had to
choose ten times. The type of food the dog ate seven or more times was considered as ‘preferred’, and the

other type was considered as ‘non-preferred’. Between tests with different dogs, the plate was cleaned
with water and dish soap.
2.4. Two-way object choice test
2.4.1. Pre-test phase
The O held the dog by its collar/harness at the start point. The E placed one brown, non-transparent
plastic bowl (round, plastic flower pot, 20 cm tall and 20 cm wide) on the floor approximately 1 m from
the dog. The E conspicuously dropped a piece of the preferred food into the bowl. After this, the O let
the dog free and if it was needed, verbally encouraged it to eat the food. This action was repeated once
more.
2.4.2. Test phase
Dogs were randomly allocated to two experimental groups: an empty alternative group (EA) and a
reward alternative group (RA), based on the content of the non-indicated bowl. At the beginning of
each trial, the dog was held by its owner at the start point. Invisibly, for the dog and for the O, the E put
a piece of low incentive value food in one of the two identical bowls; and this was the indicated bowl
in the experiment, so that it always contained a low incentive value food regardless of the experimental
group of the dog. In the other (alternative) bowl, either a high incentive value food was placed for each
trial of a given dog (RA group) or no food was placed (EA group). The high incentive value food in the
RA group was placed into the alternative bowl the same way as the low incentive value food was placed
into the indicated bowl (i.e. invisibly for the dog and the O). The bowls were marked on their inside wall
so that the same bowl was used for the same type of food consistently. After placing the reward(s) in the
bowls, the E turned towards the dog and the O and held both bowls in front of her body then exchanged
the two bowls between her hands a few times. Then the E put the two bowls simultaneously on the floor
on her left and right side, 1.5 m from each other and 2.6 m from the subject. The left and right position
for the indicated and the alternative bowl was varied in a semi-random order (the same bowl was placed
no more than two times on the same side, and during the first two trials in each session the indicated
bowl’s position was alternated). Then the E stood up and held her hands in front of her chest and called
the dog by its name to attract the dog’s attention. After the E established eye contact with the subject,
she pointed towards the bowl with low incentive value food (‘indicated’ or ‘correct’ location) for 2 s with

extended arm (figure 1). After the pointing cue, the E put her hand back to the front of her chest and the
dog was released by the O (momentary distal pointing [25]). If the subject did not leave the start position
for 3 s after it was released, the E repeated the pointing gesture once more. As soon as the dog reached
one of the bowls, the E quickly took away the other one to prevent the dog from examining both bowls.
The dog was allowed to eat the content of the chosen bowl. The O called the dog back to the start point
and the next trial started. The maximum trial number in this experiment was 20. The dogs had to choose
within 30 s. If a dog did not choose within this time period in two subsequent trials, this experiment was
terminated for the given dog, and the last two trials (in which the dog did not choose) were excluded
from statistical analyses. We had two alternative predictions: (1) obese dogs/obesity-prone breeds will
show higher success rates in choosing the indicated bowl (they maximize the reward intake even if it
is a low quality one); or (2) obese dogs/obesity-prone breeds give up easier on the indicated bowl (low
quality food), especially after they noted that the alternative bowl contains high-quality food.
2.5. Cognitive bias test
Following a minimum one-week interval after the two-way object choice test, the same subjects were
invited to participate in the cognitive bias test.
2.5.1. Training phase (location discrimination task)
At the beginning of each trial, the O held the dog by its collar/harness on the start point. In the case of
each subject, one side of the experimental room was allocated to the ‘rewarded location’ and the other
side was the ‘non-rewarded location’. These were kept constant throughout the entire procedure for the
given subject. Left and right side was designated as ‘rewarded’ or ‘non-rewarded’ location in an equal
proportion of the subjects. The bowl at the ‘rewarded location’ always contained a piece of the preferred
food, while at the non-rewarded location the bowl was always empty. Before each trial, the E placed one
bowl on the ground either to the ‘rewarded’ or to the ‘non-rewarded’ location in semi-random order.
The bowl was 3 m away from the subject and neither the dog nor the O was able to see the content of
the bowl from the start point. After placing the bowl, the E went behind the O and touched his/her
shoulder, signalling that the dog can be released. The E measured the latency between the releasing of
the dog to reaching the bowl using a digital stopwatch. The trial was finished when the dog reached the
bowl, or 30 s after the O released the dog (whichever happened first). The training phase ended when the
threshold criterion was reached by the subject: the latencies of the last five ‘rewarded’ trials were shorter
than in the last five non-rewarded trials.
2.5.2. Test phase
Test trials started immediately after the training phase. Three trials were conducted in a fixed order;
after a rewarded and non-rewarded trial (in random order), the bowl was placed halfway between the
rewarded and non-rewarded locations (ambiguous location). Half of the dogs were tested in rewarded–
non-rewarded–ambiguous trial order and the other half in non-rewarded–rewarded–ambiguous trial
order. The testing procedure was otherwise the same as described above in the training phase. Our two,
competing predictions were: (1) obese dogs/obesity-prone breeds will show positive expectancy in the
case of the ambiguous location, because they have higher food responsiveness; or (2) these dogs would
be rather reluctant in approaching the ambiguous location due to their pessimistic predisposition.
2.6. Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were carried out in R statistical environment (https://www.R-project.org, v. 3.2.3,
R Core Team). We used linear mixed-effects models (LMMs; R package ‘lme4’), binomial generalized
linear models (GLMs), binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs; R package ‘lme4’) and
mixed-effects Cox models (MECMs; R package ‘come’).
In all analyses, backward model selection was based on Akaike information criterion (AIC), so that
the model with the lowest AIC value was kept and we considered a model better whenever delta AIC
was ≥2. The effects of explanatory variables were analysed by F-tests (in LMMs) and likelihood ratio
tests (in GLMs, GLMMs and MECMs); we provide F or χ2 and the corresponding p-values of tests of
models with and without the explanatory variable. For non-significant explanatory variables that were
in the focus of our research, we provide test statistics before exclusion from the final model. Parameter

estimates (for GLMs and GLMMs) and hazard ratios (Exp[β], for MECMs) with 95% confidence interval
are also provided between levels of a given significant fixed effect.
2.6.1. Two-way object choice test
We focused on three behavioural responses in the two-way object choice test, separately: endurance,
latency to choosing, and preference for the indicated bowl. Endurance (binary response: whether or not
the dog completed the 20 trials) was analysed using binomial GLMs. The full model included breed
(factor with four levels: Beagle, Retriever, Border Collie, Mudi), body condition (factor with two levels:
overweight, normal), experimental group (i.e. non-indicated bowl content; factor with two levels: empty,
rewarded) and all possible two-way interactions between these fixed effects.
Latency to choosing (time spent between the moment that the owner released the dog and when
it reached any of the two offered bowls) was inverse-transformed for normalizing residuals, and then
analysed in LMMs. The full model included the same independent variables as the endurance analysis
(breed, body condition, experimental group) in addition to trial as a covariate and dog ID as a random
term. Initial models also included all possible two-way interactions between independent variables.
A small number of trials (36 of 1593 or 2.3%) in which dogs did not go to any of the bowls within 30 s of
the trial were treated as censored observations and were excluded from this analysis.
Preference for the indicated bowl (i.e. number of times choosing it) was analysed using binomial
GLMMs with choosing and not choosing the indicated bowl as success and failure, respectively. The full
model included the same fixed effects as the latency to choosing analysis (i.e. breed, body condition,
experimental group, trial and their two-way interactions) and dog ID as a random term.
2.6.2. Cognitive bias test
In the cognitive bias test, probability of reaching the bowl was analysed in MECMs with latency to
reaching the bowl as response and reaching as terminal event. Dogs that did not reach the bowl within
30 s of the trial were treated as censored observations. Full models included test trial (factor with three
levels: rewarded, non-rewarded and ambiguous) and body condition (factor with two levels: normal,
overweight) and breed (factor with four levels: Beagle, Retriever, Border Collie, Mudi) and all possible
two-way interactions between them as fixed effects, in addition to dog ID as a random effect.
2.6.3. Inter-coder reliability
To assess the reliability of behavioural coding, the video footages of 12 randomly selected dogs that
participated in both experiments were independently coded by a second observer. Inter-coder reliability
was then investigated using the R package ‘rptR’ [31]. This analysis revealed strong agreement between
the two observers; in the two-way object choice test, endurance and preference (see above) were scored
identically by the two observers (i.e. 100% agreement between them), and the latency was scored almost
identically as well (repeatability estimate with 95% CI: r = 0.996 [0.995; 0.997], p < 0.001). Similarly,
latencies coded by the two observers in the cognitive bias test were highly repeatable (r = 0.999 [0.997;
0.999], p < 0.001).
3. Results
3.1. Two-way object choice test
From the 91 dogs involved in the study, 66 (or 73.33%) completed all 20 trials (range: 3–20,
mean ± s.d. = 18.0 ± 4.2 trials per dog). The endurance analysis revealed experimental group differences
(binomial GLM of endurance, effect of experimental group: χ2(1) = 12.72, p < 0.001; figure 2), because
dogs that were tested in reward alternative test conditions were more likely to complete all 20 test
trials than dogs that were tested in the empty alternative conditions (b = 1.78 [0.78; 2.90], z = 3.33,
p < 0.001). Endurance was not influenced by body condition and was not different between breeds
(both p > 0.134).
The analysis of latency to choosing revealed that the test trial had an experimental group and
breed-specific effect on how fast dogs reached any of the two offered bowls, reflected in significant
two-way interactions (LMM of latency to choose (inverse transformed), trial × experimental group
interaction: χ2(1) = 100.84, p < 0.001; trial × breed interaction: χ2(3) = 24.16, p < 0.001). The experimental
group-specific effect was driven by dogs choosing faster with increasing trial number in reward

0.008]; Beagle versus Retriever: b = 0.001 [−0.002; 0.003]). Body condition had no effect on latency to
choosing (p > 0.206).
Experimental group had a body condition-specific and breed-specific effect on preference for the
indicated bowl, i.e. the proportion of trials when choosing it (binomial GLM of number of times

dogs choosing less often the indicated bowl in the reward alternative test conditions than normal weight
dogs (overweight versus normal body condition, empty alternative versus reward alternative: b = −0.61
[−1.22; −0.01], z = −1.98, p = 0.048; figure 3b). Breed-specific effects of experimental groups were mainly
due to Beagles choosing the indicated bowl less frequently in the RA group than the other three breeds
(reward alternative versus empty alternative, Retriever versus Mudi: b = 0.39 [−0.22; 1.00], z = 1.26,
p = 0.209; Retriever versus Border Collie: b = −0.24 [−0.86; 0.37], z = −0.78, p = 0.435; Retriever versus
Beagle: b = −0.48 [−1.07; 0.10], z = −1.62, p = 0.104).

of body condition × test trial interaction: χ2(2) = 7.31, p = 0.026; figure 4). This interaction was mainly
driven by a decreased probability of reaching the bowl in overweight, as opposed to normal weight,
dogs in the ambiguous test trials compared to the non-rewarded test trials (overweight versus normal
body condition, non-rewarded versus ambiguous test: Exp[β] = 0.28 [0.11; 0.71], z = −2.67, p = 0.008).

A similar, albeit smaller, difference between the effect of body condition in rewarded as opposed to
non-rewarded tests also contributed to this interaction (overweight versus normal body condition,
non-rewarded versus rewarded test: Exp[β] = 0.40 [0.17; 0.96], z = −2.05, p = 0.040).

The probability of reaching the bowl was also different between test trials (MECM, effect of test
trial: χ2(2) = 94.38, p < 0.001; figure 5). The difference was driven by increased probabilities of reaching
the bowl in the rewarded and ambiguous, as opposed to the non-rewarded tests, with probability
of the ambiguous tests being between those of the rewarded and non-rewarded tests (ambiguous
versus non-rewarded tests: Exp[β] = 4.02 [2.57; 6.31], z = 6.07, p < 0.001; rewarded versus non-rewarded:
Exp[β] = 10.74 [6.71; 17.19], z = 9.88, p < 0.001).
In addition, this analysis revealed breed differences in the probability of reaching the bowl
(χ2(3) = 10.52, p = 0.015; figure 6), because Mudis and Beagles reached the bowl with a higher probability
than Retrievers and Border Collies (Mudi versus Retriever: Exp[β] = 2.89 [1.14; 7.35], z = 2.23, p = 0.026;
Border Collie versus Retriever: Exp[β] = 1.19 [0.47; 3.02], z = 0.37, p = 0.710; Beagle versus Retriever:
Exp[β] = 2.98 [1.26; 7.02], z = 2.49, p = 0.013).
4. Discussion
In two separate experiments, the possible effects of body condition and breed were tested on dogs’
performance in tasks where food responsiveness can be important. In the two-way object choice test,
we found that independent of their breed and body condition, dogs were less likely to quit the test (that
is, they were more prone to complete all 20 trials) when the alternative pot contained (high-quality)
food. Similarly, dogs in the rewarded alternative pot group chose faster towards the end of this test,
compared to the EA group. Again, body condition did not affect the latencies to choose. However,
body condition had an effect (in interaction with the reward-content of the non-indicated bowl) on how
often dogs chose the indicated bowl. Overweight dogs less often followed the experimenter’s pointing
when the alternative bowl contained a reward. A similar effect was found in the case of dog breeds,
because compared to the other breeds, Beagles were less likely to choose the indicated bowl when the
non-indicated bowl contained food.
In the cognitive bias test, we found a marked effect of body condition, because overweight dogs
reached the ambiguous bowl with a lower probability than the normal weight dogs did. In support of
expectations from the test paradigm, dogs in general reached the bowl at the non-rewarded location
with the lowest, and the bowl at the rewarded location with the highest probability, with the likelihood
of reaching the bowl at the ambiguous location falling between these two. Breed differences in the
probability of reaching the ambiguous bowl were also apparent in this experiment, as Beagles and Mudis
were more likely to reach it than Border Collies and Retrievers.
In contrast to some of our a priori hypotheses, overweight dogs did not show unselective food
responsiveness. It was recently found that obese people, even when satiated (i.e. ‘not hungry’) showed
increased interest in food images compared to normal weight controls [32]. Based on this finding, one
could predict that overweight dogs would follow human pointing more frequently, even if the signalled
bowl contained low-quality reward (i.e. ‘do not abandon the safe food’ strategy); as well as a more
positively biased response towards the ambiguous location in the cognitive bias test (i.e. ‘if it is different
than negative, it has to be positive’ strategy). However, in our tests, overweight dogs reacted more
sensitively to the presence of a high-quality reward in the non-indicated bowl than the normal weight
dogs did. In the cognitive bias test, overweight dogs were less eager to approach the ambiguous location
when compared with the normal weight subjects. The behaviour of overweight dogs indicated that
these subjects were more responsive to the possibility of consuming more rewarding food in the two-
way object choice test; and they showed a more conservative/cautious (or ‘pessimistic’) strategy in the
cognitive bias test. Although the results of the two-object choice test could theoretically be explained by
obese participants being less able to focus their attention, similar to humans [10], such an explanation
would not be in line with the results of the cognitive bias test (where the approach pattern of overweight
dogs showed that these subjects must have had a clear picture of the positively reinforced location).
The connection between being overweight and showing negative cognitive bias (pessimism) is often
explained on the basis of the relationship between depression and obesity in humans [33,34]. However,
with regard to our canine subjects, a model considering the association between particular personality
traits and obesity seems to be a more appropriate approach, in line with recent research discovering
the existence of human-analogous personality structure in dogs (e.g. [35,36]). In human participants,
personality traits were found to play an important role both in terms of risks and in terms of protective
factors in the development of overweight problems. Neuroticism, impulsivity and sensitivity to reward
turned out to be risk factors, but conscientiousness and self-control have been shown to contribute
as protective traits in relation to weight gain [37]. From our aspect, it is especially interesting that
 11

impulsivity (a personality trait also found in dogs [38,39]) shows strong connection to obesity and binge
eating disorder. Mobs et al. [38] found that overweight and obese subjects had higher levels of urgency,
lack of perseverance and sensitivity to reward, which are three from the five dimensions of impulsivity
[40]. In our tests, overweight dogs also responded with higher sensitivity to the reward, because they
were more often abandoning the low-quality food indicated by the experimenter for the sake of the high-
quality food in the non-indicated bowl. This behaviour may also be connected to the above-mentioned
lack of perseverance in obese subjects. If so, overweight dogs might have shown less perseverance in
following human pointing cues (that lead to an unsatisfying reward); therefore, they might have been
able to detect the presence of an alternative reward earlier in the non-indicated bowl. Negative cognitive
bias can also be explained on the basis of higher sensitivity to reward in the overweight dogs, because the
ambiguous location could have been assessed as a ‘less promising’ food source compared to the ‘positive’
location.
We found moderate effect of dog breeds in both experiments. Beagles behaved similarly to the
overweight dogs in the two-way object choice test, by less often choosing the indicated bowl when the
non-indicated bowl contained reward. Beagles are obesity-prone dogs (e.g. [1]); therefore, their present
strategy (i.e. maximizing energy intake by increased responsivity to higher quality food) could contribute
to the overweight problems in this breed. However, we should also consider that the Retrievers in our
sample did not show a similar reaction as the Beagles did, although in the Retriever group we had a
high occurrence of overweight subjects. Variable responses of the two obesity-prone breeds could be
explained by differences in their original function. While Beagles were selected for hunting on their
own (i.e. chasing game without human assistance), Retrievers traditionally work in close interaction
with humans. It was found that in a two-way choice task, similar to the one used in our experiment,
cooperative breeds follow human pointing with higher fidelity than the independent working breeds
do [41].
The prediction that obesity-prone breeds would react similarly in the cognitive bias experiment was
not supported. Retrievers and Beagles responded differently, and as was shown earlier, overweight
subjects in general showed negative bias in the ambiguous test condition. If we examine the results from
the aspect of selection for independent or cooperative work, we can conclude that both breeds with lower
probability to reach the ambiguous location (Border Collies and Retrievers) belong to the cooperative
breeds [41], meanwhile cooperative (Mudi—a Hungarian herding dog breed) and independent (Beagle)
dog breeds reached the ambiguous location with higher probability. This suggests that cooperative
breeds may be characterized mostly by a negative cognitive bias, resulting from the stronger effect
of being reinforced at the positive location. Independent working breeds, however, may approach
the ambiguous location with a higher probability, because their behaviour is less bound to patterns
reinforced by humans; this behavioural pattern and explanation are in line with the results of our
two-way object choice test.
5. Conclusion
The results of our experiments showed that normal and overweight dogs behave differently in tasks
that involve food and interaction with humans as motivation. We found that overweight dogs either
try to maximize the intake of higher quality food (two-way object choice test), or they hesitate when
they face a formerly untried location for obtaining food (cognitive bias test). Food choice patterns in
humans with overweight/obesity problems are complex and they are influenced by various genetic and
environmental factors, including social learning and cultural transmission [42]. However, it is a general
phenomenon that overweight/obese subjects show attraction towards energy-dense foods [43]. In our
study, dogs proved to be a useful model species to test characteristic patterns of food responsiveness
in normal and overweight subjects, showing similar strategies to those expected from human subjects.
Being an obesity-prone breed, however, did not have an effect, because, we argue, breed differences
reported in our study are rather driven by the cooperative/independent working dog status of these
particular breeds. Furthermore, we found that an independent breed (the Beagle) showed similar food
choice strategy to overweight dogs in general, adding a potential new risk factor to the already created
long list for canine obesity (e.g. [44]).
Ethics. The subjects of the experiments were privately owned companion dogs, which were tested in the presence
of their owners. All experiments were run in the laboratories of the Eötvös Loránd University (Hungary) and the
University of Padova (Italy); therefore, obtaining permissions and licences to conduct fieldwork was not necessary.
An a priori informed consent was signed by each participating dog’s owner with the details of the experimental

procedure, including the aims of the study, the circumstances and methods of the experiments. Owners were present
during the tests and we informed them beforehand that they could interrupt the experiment and withdraw their
dog from participation at any time if they found any of the tests too stressful for their dog. The Institutional Animal
Welfare Committee, as well as the National Scientific Ethical Committee on Animal Experimentation reviewed and
accepted the protocol of the experiment (Ref. no. PEI/001/1457-4/2015).
