We report the discovery that strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis produce 6-N-hydroxyaminopurine (6-HAP), a mol-
ecule that inhibits DNA polymerase activity. In culture, 6-HAP selectively inhibited proliferation of tumor lines but did
not inhibit primary keratinocytes. Resistance to 6-HAP was associated with the expressionof mitochondrial amidoxime
reducing components, enzymes that were not observed in cells sensitive to this compound. Intravenous injection of
6-HAP in mice suppressed the growth of B16F10 melanoma without evidence of systemic toxicity. Colonization of mice
with an S. epidermidis strain producing 6-HAP reduced the incidence of ultraviolet-induced tumors compared to mice
colonized by a control strain that did not produce 6-HAP. S. epidermidis strains producing 6-HAP were found in the
metagenome from multiple healthy human subjects, suggesting that the microbiome of some individuals may confer
protection against skin cancer. These findings show a new role for skin commensal bacteria in host defense.
INTRODUCTION
Mammalian skin harbors diverse microbial communities whose growth
is influenced by ecological factors on the body surface such as humidity,
temperature, pH, lipid content, and the presence of antimicrobials
produced by the host (1). Coagulase-negative staphylococcal species,
such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, and others,
are the predominant bacterial species that colonize normal human skin
(2), whereas Staphylococcus aureus frequently colonizes abnormal skin
such as that found in patients with atopic dermatitis (3). Some of these
organisms can alter epidermal function (4, 5) and, thus, interact with
the host to maintain or disrupt the local ecology of the skin (1, 6). This
interplay of microbe and host appears to be critical for establishing
homeostasis but is poorly understood.
Although the specific mechanisms through which skin surface mi-
crobes influence host function are incompletely understood, specific
strains of coagulase-negative staphylococcal species have been shown
to produce proteins that work together with endogenous host antimi-
crobial peptides (AMPs) to provide direct protection against infectious
pathogens (7–9). For example, the production of phenol-soluble mod-
ulins (PSMg and PSMd) by S. epidermidis can selectively kill bacterial
pathogens such as S. aureus and group A Streptococcus (GAS) (7, 8).
This species has also been shown to benefit skin immune function by
diminishing inflammation after injury (10), enhancing development of
cutaneous T cells (11–13) and promoting expression of host AMPs such
as cathelicidins and b-defensins (11, 12, 14–16). Germ-free mice are
more susceptible to skin infection than mice maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions or monoassociated with S. epidermidis (12).
Further evidence that commensal Staphylococcus species provide host
defense has come from observations that nasal colonization with either
a specific strain of S. epidermidis that produces a serine protease or a
strain of Staphylococcus lugdunensis that produces a thiazolidine-
containing cyclic peptide can inhibit nasal colonization by S. aureus
(17, 18). More recently, several strains of S. epidermidis, S. hominis,
and other coagulase-negative staphylococcal species that produce a va-
riety of previously unknown AMPs were found to be deficient in atopic
dermatitis patients colonized by S. aureus, and a clinical trial evaluating
the effect of reintroduction of these strains demonstrated that they di-
rectly reduced S. aureus colonization on humans (9). Thus, evidence is
increasing that the skin microbiome hasan important role in promoting
host defense.
Here, we report the results of a continued molecular analysis of the
metabolic products of human skin commensal bacteria. Unexpectedly,
specific strains of S. epidermidis were observed to produce a nucleo-
base analog with the capacity to inhibit DNA synthesis. When
administered intravenously or topically applied to mice, this molecule
or the live S. epidermidis strain itself suppressed tumor growth in vivo.
These observations suggest that the skin microbiome may contribute to
aspects of host defense that include resistance to tumor growth.
RESULTS
A strain of S. epidermidis produces 6-N-hydroxyaminopurine
In the course of testing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains for an-
timicrobialactivity isolated fromhealthy human skin (9), we identified a
strain of S. epidermidis that secreted a bactericidal activity against GAS.
However, unlike other organisms identified with this bioactivity, the ac-
tivity from this strain was heat-stable and protease-insensitive, suggest-
ing that this factor was not a protein (Fig. 1, A and B). Purification was
performed through five steps, yielding a single peak associated with an-
timicrobial activity on high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) (fig. S1). The final yield of purified compound was 7 mg from
6.4 liters of culture supernatant. The purified molecule had potent
capacity to inhibit growth of GAS in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1C). High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrome-
try (HR-ESI-MS) analysis deduced its molecular formula as C5H5N5O
(found, 151.0487; calculated, 151.0489) (fig. S2). To determine wheth-
er this was a de novo synthetic product of this S. epidermidis strain, we
cultured the bacterium in the presence of ammonium-15N chloride.
Incorporation of the 15N isotope confirmed that the molecule was
produced via de novo synthesis and not by fermentation or break-
down of components in the culture media (Fig. 1D). The proton nu-
clear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum of the purified

 compound displayed two proton signals in the aromatic region (dH =
8.19 and 8.17), whereas six signals in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–d5
(dH = 12.74, 1H; 10.87 0.7H; 9.50, 1H; 8.08, 1H; 7.75, 1H; and 7.48,
0.4H)(fig. S3A).The gradient-selected heteronuclearmultiple-bondcor-
relation (gHMBC) spectrum of purified compound revealed five carbon
signals in the aromatic region (dC = 113.60, 144.94, 148.17, 150.28, and
150.45) (fig. S4). The combined data from 1H NMR and gHMBC spec-
tra displayed the presence of a purine moiety with an additional oxygen
atom attached to one of the five nitrogen atoms. Given the chemical
formula as C5H5N5O, the structure was predicted as 6-HAP (Fig. 1E).
Chemical synthesis of 6-HAP and subsequent structural analysis and
comparison of bioactivity between purified and synthetic material
(figs. S3B and S5) supported the conclusion that 6-HAP was made by
this S. epidermidis strain.
6-HAP exerts selective antiproliferative activity against
tumor cell lines
Given that the structure of 6-HAP was similar to adenine, we next in-
vestigated the influence of 6-HAP on DNA synthesis. To directly exam-
ine the action of 6-HAP on DNA polymerase, we designed a 25-bp
(base pair) template and matching 18-bp fluorescence primer to
measure DNA extension in vitro by Klenow (exo−) DNA polymerase.
In the presence of 6-HAP, DNA extension occurred normally when
the template required cytosine for extension (X = G) but was blocked
when adenosine was required (X = T) (Fig. 1F). These data show that
6-HAP directly inhibits DNA synthesis by interfering with adenosine-
thymidine base pairing. Consistent with this observation, 6-HAP in-
hibited BrdU incorporation in several tumor cell lines, including B16F10
melanoma and L5178 and YAC-1 lymphoma (Fig. 1G). By contrast,
NHEKs were not affected by 6-HAP (Fig. 1H). These data suggest that
6-HAP exerts selective antiproliferative activity against several tumor
cells.
Selective antiproliferative activity of 6-HAP is mediated
by mARCs
To understand why 6-HAP showed selective inhibition of transformed
cells, we first examined the potential for selective cell penetration. 6-HAP
did not directly affect plasma membrane permeability of the primary or
transformed cell lines tested (fig. S6). Next, we evaluated the potential of
target cells to metabolize 6-HAP. The expression of mitochondrial am-
idoxime reducing components (mARC1 and mARC2) was much higher
in primary cultured skin cells than in cancer cell lines that were sensitive
to 6-HAP (Fig. 2A). mARCs 1 and 2 reduce N-hydroxylated nucleo-
base analogs to nucleobases (19). To validate whether this expression of
mARCs in the primary cells (NHEK) conferred resistance to 6-HAP, we
performed gene silencing with small interfering RNA (siRNA) to
mARC1 and mARC2 (Fig. 2B). This partially eliminated resistance to
6-HAP(Fig.2C)andsuggestedthattheexpressionofmARC1ormARC2
can partially explain selective resistance in nontransformed keratinocytes.
Some nucleobase analogs have the potential to exert mutagenic ac-
tivity. Previous studies of 6-HAP derived from synthetic chemical li-
braries of N-hydroxylated derivatives of purines concluded that it
could induce gene mutations (20, 21). However, these studies did
not test for tautomeric isoforms. Therefore, to more carefully evaluate
mutagenic potential with defined 6-HAP, we measured mutagenic
events by two independent approaches: a well-established assay of the

 thymidine kinase (tk) locus of L5178Y tk+/− mouse lymphoma cells (22)
and the Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium (TA100). Neither sensi-
tive assay of mutagenesis detected mutagenic activity for 6-HAP (table
S1, A and B).
6-HAP selectively suppresses melanoma in mice
We next evaluated the systemic activity of 6-HAP in vivo. Toxicity was
first assessed in mice by administration of repeated intravenous injec-
tions of 6-HAP at the maximal soluble dose of 20 mg/kg every 48 hours
for 2 weeks. This resulted in no apparent systemic toxic effects as as-
sessed by visual appearance and weight (Fig. 3A), and no change was
observed in complete blood count or liver function as assessed by aspar-
tate aminotransferase activity (table S2). Given the apparent lack of sys-
temic toxicity, 6-HAP was administered intravenously to mice
inoculated with the rapidly growing isogenic melanoma cell line
B16F10. Tumor size of this aggressively growing tumor was suppressed
by >60% in mice receiving 6-HAP compared to those that received in-
jections with vehicle alone (Fig. 3, B and C).
S. epidermidis strain producing 6-HAP suppresses
UV-induced skin tumor in mice
Our observation that 6-HAP was constitutively produced by a skin
commensal bacterium led us to hypothesize that the presence of these
strains on the skin surface could be protective against skin tumor for-
mation. To address this hypothesis, we used a two-stage ultraviolet (UV)
carcinogenesis model (23, 24). SKH-1 hairless mice were treated with
7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) for 1 week, followed by UV-B
irradiation twice a week. During UV exposure, these mice were colonized
by topical application of either a strain of S. epidermidis that produced
6-HAP or equal amounts of S. epidermidis 1457 that was used as a
control. The density of S. epidermidis applied was similar to that found
on normal human skin (25). Mice colonized with the control strain
of S. epidermidis had the expected high incidence of tumor formation
(Fig. 4, A to C). By contrast, mice colonized with S. epidermidis that
produced 6-HAP had a significantly decreased incidence and num-
ber of tumors (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). Histopathogenic examination of
samples of 81 of these tumors in 19 control mice identified all tumors

 as squamous papillomas (Fig. 4E). Microscopic evidence of papilloma
formation was not seen in normal-appearing skin of mice that received
epicutaneous application of the 6-HAP–producing strain (Fig. 4F).
S. epidermidis was observed to enter the skin as previously described
(25), and both the control and the 6-HAP–producing strains were seen
within the dermis at similar frequencies (Fig. 4, G and H). The 6-HAP–
producing strain of S. epidermidis and the control 1457 strain equally
induced a small increase in expression of Il-6, Cxcl2, and Camp in the
skin (fig. S7). This suggested that the antitumor activity of the 6-HAP–
producing MO34 strain was not due to a difference in immunomodu-
latory activity from this strain compared to control.
S. epidermidis strains producing 6-HAP are common in
human skin
6-HAP was detected by HPLC of culture supernatant from two dis-
tinct clinical isolates of S. epidermidis but not from the reference lab-
oratory S. epidermidis strains ATCC12228 and 1457 strains (Fig. 5, A
to D). This suggested that 6-HAP production was not rare but univer-
sal among all S. epidermidis strains. To further explore the frequency
of 6-HAP production in human commensal S. epidermidis stains, we
performed and used whole-genome sequencing of the MO34 strain for
analysisof existingmetagenomicdatasetsofthehumanskinmicrobiome
(26). Sequence analysis frequently identified S. epidermidis strains similar
to the 6-HAP–producing isolate within the human skin microbiome
but detected similar strains at a different frequency at distinct body sites
(Fig. 5E).
DISCUSSION
Here, we describe identification of unique strains of S. epidermidis that
produce a chemical compound that impairs tumor growth. Our data
suggest that this compound, 6-HAP, inhibits DNA synthesis and has
selective antiproliferative function against transformed tumor cell lines,
as well as the ability to suppress growth induced de novo by UV expo-
sure. This observation suggests that commensal skin bacteria may assist
in defending the host against neoplasia of the skin.
Biosynthesis of 6-HAP likely requires successive oxidation of the
amine group at the carbon C-6 of adenine to N-hydroxyl group, as well
as several additional catalytic steps that involve multiple enzymes such
as flavin-dependent N-oxygenases, cytochrome P450s, and iron- and
copper-containing N-oxygenases (27). Further studies are required to
understand the biosynthetic pathway of 6-HAP and the mechanisms

 by which6-HAPproduction isregulated. 6-HAPappearsto act by com-
peting with adenine to inhibit DNA synthesis, a well-known antiprolif-
erativemechanismfornucleobaseanalogs.Forexample,6-mercaptopurine
is converted in vivo to 6-thioguanine and is then incorporated into
DNA in place of guanine (28). 8-Azaguanine also suppresses DNA syn-
thesis by a similar mechanism (29). Nucleobase analogs constitute an
important class of antimetabolites used for the treatment of hematolog-
ical malignancies and solid tumors (30). In 6-HAP, the amino group at
the carbon C-6 position of the purine ring is replaced with an N-hydroxyl
group. This is a critical position for DNA synthesis because the hydrogen
of the amino group at the carbon C-6 position of adenine is required to
bind with oxygen at the carbon C-4 position of thymine (31).
The mechanism for selective activity of 6-HAP has not been defin-
itively proven for all cell types, but our data suggest that reduction of the
N-hydroxyl group by mARC enzymes can rescue primary keratinocytes
from the cytotoxic activity of 6-HAP. Previous reports have also re-
ported that activity of synthetic 6-HAP against HeLa cells could be re-
paired by inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (32). Other studies
have also reported that synthetic 6-HAP exhibited no toxicity to a
wild-type strain of Escherichia coli, whereas it inhibited growth of mu-
tant strains deficient in genes involved in molybdenum cofactors (33, 34).
This suggests that molybdoenzymes such as xanthine oxidase may also
be capable of detoxifying 6-HAP to protect some cells. Thus, it is likely
that multiple mechanisms for inactivation of 6-HAP occur in nature, a
finding consistent with our discovery that bacteria producing this mol-
ecule are commonly present in the normal skin microbiome. The in-
ability of transformed cells to inactivate the compound is the most
likely explanation for selective sensitivity to 6-HAP, although additional
work is required to firmly establish this conclusion. Given the selective
antiproliferative activity on tested cancer cell lines, 6-HAP may have
therapeutic potential as a selective antimetabolite for some tumors.
No mutagenic activity could be detected in 6-HAP produced by
S. epidermidis or in our preparations made by chemical synthesis. How-
ever, previous studies of 6-HAP derived from synthetic chemical libraries
of N-hydroxylated derivatives of purines concluded that it could induce
mutations in yeast and bacterial cells (20, 21). Because our results in
standard mutagenesis assays did not agree with these previous observa-
tions, we speculate that the previous positive results may have been due
to the presence of tautomeric isoforms of 6-HAP that were not detected
in the former synthetic preparations. Migration of hydrogen accompa-
nied by a switch of the adjacent double bond would not have been
detected by mass analysis. Therefore, we believe it is highly unlikely
that this common skin commensal produces a potent mutagen. How-
ever, if this was the case, then the current observations would remain
highly significant because this would identify a previously undetected
risk factorfor cancer. These observationsof the capacity of acommensal
skin microbe to produce a 6-HAP are important either way and need
further evaluation.
Previous observations have reported that dysbiosis (a state of altered
microbiome) may promote cancer. For example, observations associat-
ing bacteria in the gut with an increase in carcinogenesis suggested that
this effect was dependent on inflammation (35, 36). Intestinal inflam-
mation has also been reported to promote development of tumors
through increasing the capacity of microbiota to produce genotoxins
that elicit DNA damage (37). The present findings suggest an entirely
new concept that some members of our skin microbiome may suppress
tumor growth, and dysbiosis is potentially detrimental because of loss of
aprotective functioninstead of (orin addition to)a gain of adetrimental
microbial community. Other observations that support this perspective
include previous observations from the intestinal microbiome that sug-
gested microbes may suppress tumor growth by the production of
short-chain free fatty acids (38–40). In addition, it has been demon-
strated that skin microflora potentially produces cis-urocanic acid by
degrading L-histidine, which affects immune suppression induced by
UV exposure and suppresses melanoma growth (41, 42). Overall, in ad-
dition to the well-known mutagenic potential of several human viral
pathogens, several lines of evidence support the concept that skin bacte-
ria could promote tumor development. This study now shows for the
first time, to our knowledge, that a skin bacterium could protect against
neoplasia. It should be a high priority to better define the molecular
basis for this association to establish causation.
Inconclusion,wereportherethediscoverythatastrainofS.epidermidis,
a common microbe on healthy human skin, produces 6-HAP. This
interesting small molecule inhibits DNA synthesis and has the potential
to convey protection against neoplasia. Abeneficialrole forskin bacteria
in host defense is consistent with observations of a role for commensal
bacteria to resist S. aureus infection (9) but extends this concept to host
defense functions against cancer. Further study is needed to examine
whether a loss of S. epidermidis strains producing 6-HAP increases a
risk of skincancerinhumansorcouldbe usedasapreventative treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Characterization and purification of 6-HAP
S. epidermidis MO34 strain was cultured in TSB at 37°C for 24 hours
and was removed from culture supernatant with 0.22-mm filter. To ex-
amine heat stability and resistance to protease, we treated the filtrated
conditioned media at 100°C for 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min or incubated it
with proteinase K or papain (2 mg/ml) at 37°C for 3 hours, followed by
a 5-min incubation at 90°C to inactivate enzyme. The antimicrobial
activity in the treated conditioned media was measured by radial dif-
fusion assay as described below. To isolate the antimicrobial
component, we lyophilized the filtrated culture supernatant, and we
suspended the residue in methanol to precipitate proteins. The super-
natant was dried under vacuum, and the residual substance was dis-
solved in water. Because 6-HAP is weakly retained in the C18 reverse
phase column, the solution was applied on Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters
Co.), washed with H2O, and eluted with 5% acetonitrile in H2O. The
elution was lyophilized and suspended in 90% acetonitrile/10% water.
The supernatant was separated by HPLC. After each purification step,
activity was determined by radial diffusion assay against GAS (NZ131).
The purified compound was characterized by mass spectrometry and
NMR. Purified 6-HAP was lyophilized, and dry weight was measured
to measure specific activity.
Antimicrobial assays
Radialdiffusionassay wasperformed using GAS aspreviously described
(43). Briefly, melted Todd-Hewitt broth agar (10 ml) was mixed with
GAS (1 × 106 CFU) and poured in a 10-cm petri dish. Two to 4 ml of test
samples was applied in a small well punched on the agar plate. Plates
were incubated at 37°C overnight to allow visible growth of bacteria.
Antibacterial activity was indicated by the clear zone (no bacterial
growth) around the well.
Antimicrobial activity of 6-HAP was determined by incubating
1 × 105 CFU/ml bacteria with twofold serial dilutions of synthetic
6-HAP in Mueller-Hinton broth at 37°C for 24 hours. After incubation,
the number of viable bacteria was measured by counting CFU after
spreading 10-fold serial dilutions of bacteria on suitable agar plates.

 High-performance liquid chromatography
The active fraction from the Sep-Pak cartridge was separated by HPLC
in a hydrophilic interaction mode with Venusil XBP NH2 (5 mm, 100 Å,
10 × 250 mm) (Agela Technologies) with a linear gradient of H2O from
5 to 35% in acetonitrile at 4 ml/min. The active fraction was fraction-
ated, lyophilized, and dissolved in 90% acetonitrile in H2O. The active
fraction was further cleaned with PolyHYDROXYETHYL A (5 mm,
60Å, 9.4 × 250 mm) with a linear gradient of H2O from 5 to 35% in
acetonitrile at 3 ml/min. Elution profile was monitored with absorbance
at 270 nm. After each purification step, activity was determined by
radial diffusion assay against GAS (NZ131). The purified 6-HAP was
lyophilized, and dry weight was measured to measure specific activity.
Mass spectrometry
A Thermo Finnigan MAT900XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific)wasusedforbothlow-resolutionelectronimpact–MS(LR-EI-MS)
analysisandHR-ESI-MSusingdirectinsertionprobeforsampleintroduc-
tion. The electron energy was set at 70 eV with an emission current of
1.0mA.HR-ESI-MSanalysiswasperformedonaThermoLTQOrbitrap
XL mass spectrometer. The source voltage was set at 4500 V with a
heated capillary temperature of 250°C and a sheath gas flow rate of 60 U.
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance
1H NMR spectra of 6-HAP were recorded on a Mercury Plus 500 MHz
Varian instrument. Chemical shifts (d) are quoted in parts per million
referenced to the appropriate residual solvent peak (DMSO-d6 or D2O),
with abbreviations s and br s denoting singlet and broad singlet. The 1H
NMRspectrumof 6-HAPinAcOD-D2O (1:5 v/v) displayedtwo proton
signals in the aromatic region, whereas that in DMSO-d6 displayed six
signals. 1H NMR (500 MHz, AcOD-D2O) d 8.19 (s, 1H), 8.17 (s, 1H).
1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) d 12.74 (br s, 1H), 10.87 (br s, 0.7H),
9.50 (br s, 1H), 8.08 (br s, 1H), 7.75 (br s, 1H), 7.48 (br s, 0.4H).
Synthesis of 6-HAP
6-HAP was prepared according to the previously reported procedure
with slight modifications (Preparation of nucleobases and nucleosides
as antiparasitic agents, Loakes, D.; Too, K., PCT Int. Apl., 2007135380,
29 Nov. 2007). Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (1.20 g, 17.3 mmol) was
dissolved in 20 ml of boiling absolute ethanol, and a solution of potas-
sium hydroxide (1.12 g, 20.0 mmol) in 4 ml of hot absolute ethanol was
added. The precipitated KCl was filtered and washed three times with
2 ml of hot ethanol. Then, 6-chloropurine (300 mg, 1.94 mmol;
Sigma), dissolved in 7 ml of absolute ethanol, was added to the hy-
droxylamine solution. The reaction was refluxed for 2 hours then
cooled to room temperature and allowed to stand overnight.The white
precipitate formed was filtered and washed thoroughly with water and
then ethanol and was dried under high vacuum to provide 6-HAP
(230 mg, 78%) as a white solid. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) d
12.84 (br s, 1H), 10.92 (br s, 0.5H), 9.48 (br s, 1H), 8.08 (br s, 0.6H),
7.77 (s, 1H), 7.48 (br s, 0.7), in agreement with those reported. The
generated 6-HAP was purified by HPLC using Venusil XBP NH2
and PolyHYDROXYETHYL A, as described above.
In vitro DNA polymerization assay
To examine whether 6-HAP disrupts adenosine-thymidine base pair
matching in DNA extension, IRDye800-labeled 18-bp primer and
25-bp templates, which required adenosine (X = T) or cytidine (X = G)
atthe initialbase of overhang forextension, were designed(Fig. 3E). The
reaction mixture contained 100 nM primer/template, 0.1-U Klenow
fragment (exo−) DNA polymerase (Promega), and 1 mM deoxynucleo-
tide triphosphates in DNA polymerase buffer. The mixture was incu-
bated at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding stop
solution (98% formaldehyde and 20 mM EDTA). The extended DNA
was separated from primer by electrophoresis on a 20% denaturing
polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. Fluorescence was visualized
with the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).
Cell culture and cell proliferation assay
B16F10, Pam212, L5178, andYAC-1cell lineswere obtainedfromAmer-
ican Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Pam212, L5178, and YAC-1 cell
lines were maintained directly from the authenticated vial from ATCC
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with sodium pyruvate (1 mM), non-
essential amino acids (0.1 mM), penicillin (100 unit/ml), streptomy-
cin (100 mg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS)
or horse serum at 37°C under atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 in air.
B16F10 cell line was maintained directly from the authenticated vial
from ATCC in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with penicillin (100 unit/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10%
heat-inactivated FBS. NHEKs were obtained from Invitrogen (Life
Technologies) and maintained in EpiLife medium (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 60 mM calcium, epidermal growth factors, penicil-
lin, and streptomycin. After a 4-hour (tumor cell lines) or 24-hour
(NHEK) incubation with 6-HAP, proliferative activity of cells was col-
orimetrically determined by monitoring BrdU incorporation with Cell
Proliferation kit according to the manual (Roche).
Gene silencing of mARCs with siRNA
NHEK was cultured in EpiLife media containing predesigned siRNA
for mARC1 or mARC2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNAiMAX re-
agent for 24 hours. Cells were maintained in EpiLife for 72 hours and
incubated with 6-HAP (10 mg/ml) for 24 hours. Antiproliferative activ-
ity of 6-HAP was determined by measuring BrdU incorporation as de-
scribed above.
Animals
All experiments involving animal work were in accordance with the
approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Guidelines of the
University of California, San Diego (protocol number: S09074).
In vivo tumor growth assay
B16F10 were suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Shaved
mouse dorsalskin was intradermally injectedwith3 × 105 cells per 50 ml.
The C57BL6 mice were subsequently injected with 6-HAP dissolved in
2.5% DMSO/0.9% NaCl solution (2 mg/ml) at the dose of 20 mg/kg per
mouse via intravascular route every 48 hours for 2 weeks. Control mice
received an equal volume of vehicle. Tumor size was measured as the
two perpendicular diameters with a caliper, and volume was estimated
by the following formula: width2 × length/2. The mice were sacrificed
when tumor size reached >2 cm according to the animal protocol.
UV-induced tumor formation in SKH-1 mice
Female SKH-1 hairless mice (4 weeks old) were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories. The back skin of each mouse was topically
treated with a single application of DMBA (200 nmol/100 ml acetone)
as a tumor initiator. A week after tumor initiation, mice were irradiated
with 180 mJ/cm2 of UV-B twice a week. S. epidermidis MO34 or 1457
strains were cultured in TSB and diluted to 1 × 107 CFU/10 ml in TSB.
Ten microliters of either bacterial suspension was spread with a sterile

 spatula on the entire skin of mouse back six times a week for 12 weeks.
Tumor incidence and tumor number in each mouse were recorded
every week.
Immunostaining
To detect S. epidermidis in UV-induced tumor, we fixed, blocked, and
incubated cryostat sections of each tumor with anti–S. epidermidis
monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) (5 mg/ml; Clone 17–5, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour, followed by anti-mouse IgG-Alexa
488 conjugate (2 mg/ml; Invitrogen) for 30 min. To visualize epithelia,
we stained the sections with Goat–anti-K14 IgG (1 mg/ml; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), followed by rabbit anti-goat IgG-Alexa 568 (1 mg/ml;
Invitrogen).
Metagenomics
Genomic DNA was purified from S. epidermidis MO34 strain using an
UltraClean Microbial DNA Isolation kit (MO Bio). Whole-genome
DNA sequencing libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT
DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) following the vendor’s protocol.
The final library was sequenced paired-end (300 × 300 bp) on an
Illumina MiSeq. Sequenced reads were de novo assembled using
SPAdes 2.5.1 with k-mers of lengths 21, 33, 55, 77, and 127 and
the flag for “careful” turned on. On all of the produced scaffolds, a
six-frame translation was performed using translate Whole Genome
Multi Chromosome.pl (http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/).
To identify exclusive marker genes in S. epidermidis strains pro-
ducing 6-HAP, we predicted protein-coding genes from the genomes
of 2 6-HAP–producing strains and 62 strains that did not produce
6-HAP using prodigal v2.6.3 (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.
com) with default parameters. The amino acid sequences of the predicted
genes were used as input for the BPGA (Bacterial Pan Genome Analysis
tool) comparative genomics pipeline v1.3 (44), which identified unique
28marker genes that are present in 6-HAP–producing strains but not in
any of the other strains (table S3). Sequence reads from 694 human skin
metagenomic shotgun samples collected from 18 healthy individuals at
22 body sites (45) were individually aligned to the 6-HAP strain-specific
gene markers using Bowtie 2 v2.2.9 (46) under very sensitive mode. We
report the fraction of bases in the 28 specific gene markers that has at
least 1× coverage as an indicator of the presence of putative 6-HAP–
producing strains in the corresponding sample.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software
(GraphPad). Independent t test was used. Independent two-tailed t tests
were used to compare experimental and control groups for significance
of differences (P < 0.05).
