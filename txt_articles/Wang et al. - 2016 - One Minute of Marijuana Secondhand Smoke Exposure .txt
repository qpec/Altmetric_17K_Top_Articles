Background-—Despite public awareness that tobacco secondhand smoke (SHS) is harmful, many people still assume that
marijuana SHS is benign. Debates about whether smoke-free laws should include marijuana are becoming increasingly widespread
as marijuana is legalized and the cannabis industry grows. Lack of evidence for marijuana SHS causing acute cardiovascular harm
is frequently mistaken for evidence that it is harmless, despite chemical and physical similarity between marijuana and tobacco
smoke. We investigated whether brief exposure to marijuana SHS causes acute vascular endothelial dysfunction.
Methods and Results-—We measured endothelial function as femoral artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in rats before and after
exposure to marijuana SHS at levels similar to real-world tobacco SHS conditions. One minute of exposure to marijuana SHS
impaired FMD to a comparable extent as impairment from equal concentrations of tobacco SHS, but recovery was considerably
slower for marijuana. Exposure to marijuana SHS directly caused cannabinoid-independent vasodilation that subsided within
25 minutes, whereas FMD remained impaired for at least 90 minutes. Impairment occurred even when marijuana lacked
cannabinoids and rolling paper was omitted. Endothelium-independent vasodilation by nitroglycerin administration was not
impaired. FMD was not impaired by exposure to chamber air.
Conclusions-—One minute of exposure to marijuana SHS substantially impairs endothelial function in rats for at least 90 minutes,
considerably longer than comparable impairment by tobacco SHS. Impairment of FMD does not require cannabinoids, nicotine, or
rolling paper smoke. Our findings in rats suggest that SHS can exert similar adverse cardiovascular effects regardless of whether it
is from tobacco or marijuana. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003858 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.003858)

T
here is widespread belief that, unlike tobacco smoke,
marijuana smoke is benign.1 While the psychoactive
substance in marijuana is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) rather
than nicotine, marijuana smoke is still the result of biomass
combustion and contains many of the same toxins as tobacco
smoke,2 including fine particles that cause cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality.3–5 Tobacco secondhand smoke (SHS)
alone is responsible for �50 000 deaths in the United States
each year, with �46 000 from cardiovascular disease,6–8 and
implementation of laws prohibiting smoking in public places
and workplaces is followed by drops in hospital admissions for
acute myocardial infarction, other cardiac events, stroke, and
pulmonary diseases.9 However, due to the illegality of mari-
juana, it has been difficult to prospectively study the effects of
marijuana smoke, and the rare secondhand marijuana smoke
studies have focused on whether exposed people test positive

 on drug tests.10–12 The increasing number of states legalizing
medicinal and recreational marijuana, and increasing potential
for corporate expansion within the cannabis industry,13 make it
important to understand the health consequences of second-
hand exposure to marijuana smoke.
Vascular health can be evaluated by measuring arterial flow-
mediated dilation (FMD), the extent to which arteries vasodilate
in response to increased blood flow.14–16 FMD ensures
sufficient blood flow to peripheral tissues and the heart.
Decline in FMD precedes the development of atherosclerosis
and is likely important in its pathogenesis.14,16–19 FMD is
quantified in humans by ultrasound as the percent vasodilation
of the brachial artery in response to restoration of blood flow
after transient occlusion.14 Brachial artery FMD is a well-
established clinical prognostic indicator of endothelial function
that correlates with endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the
coronary arteries17 and other measures of cardiovascular
health.14,16,19,20 Decreased brachial FMD correlates with
adverse cardiovascular outcomes that are increased by
cigarette
smoke,
including
myocardial
infarction
and
atherosclerosis.21–23 FMD is impaired in tobacco smokers
relative to nonsmokers.24 People who report frequent SHS
exposure exhibit poor FMD even when smoke is not present
during the testing,24,25 and a 30-minute exposure to SHS at
real-world levels impairs FMD in humans.26–28 The nicotine in
tobacco is not responsible for the entire adverse effect of
tobacco smoke on FMD,29 and vasodilatory function is also
impaired by diesel exhaust and by smoke from incense and
candles.30,31 These observations, along with the similar chem-
ical composition of tobacco and marijuana smoke,2 led us to
hypothesize that marijuana smoke would also impair FMD.
We developed an animal model that uses micro-ultrasound
and a simple reversible surgical occlusion of blood flow to the leg
to measure FMD in the femoral arteries of living rats,32
analogous to the measurement of brachial artery FMD in
humans. We extensively validated this technique physiologically
and used it to demonstrate age-related changes in the mech-
anisms underlying FMD,32 and the beneficial vascular effects of
pharmacological preservation of bioavailable intracellular nitric
oxide.33 Subsequently, we showed that 30 minutes of tobacco
SHS exposure at real-world levels impairs FMD in rats, and that
even 1 minute of SHS impairs FMD.34 We observed similar
impairment from exposure to tobacco SHS from little cigars.35
We, therefore, used this rat model to determine whether
marijuana SHS also has adverse effects on the vasculature.
Methods
Animals
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (Simonsen Laboratory, CA; n=8/
group) were used at 9 to 10 weeks of age, with body weights of
200 to 250 g. Rats were anesthetized under ketamine/
xylazine with intraperitoneal injection. Starting doses were
ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (5 mg/kg). Repeated injec-
tions were required with one third to one half doses at a time
(approximately every 30 minutes). Experiments were terminal.
All procedures were approved by the University of California,
San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
FMD Measurement
FMD was measured in living rats as we have described
previously in detail32 by an investigator blinded to the
exposure condition when 2 or more groups were compared.
As described in the Results section, some groups were added
to the experiment afterward for confirmatory purposes and
those could not be blinded, but the diameter measurement
was performed by an automated system. Briefly, after surgical
isolation of the common iliac artery, an arterial loop occluder
consisting of a 5–0 Prolene filament was positioned under the
artery and passed through 15-cm PE-90 tubing to enable
transient occlusion of blood flow. After a 15-minute equili-
bration, the artery was transiently occluded for 5 minutes,
followed by release of the occluder and reperfusion of the
artery. A series of diameter images of the femoral artery and
accompanying Doppler blood flow images were recorded with
a 35-MHz ultrasound transducer (Vevo660, VisualSonics,
Toronto, Canada) before transient surgical occlusion (base-
line), immediately after blood reflow, and then every 30 s until
5 minutes. Diameter measurement was performed offline
from the recorded loops using an automated system (Brachial
Analyzer 5; Medical Imaging Applications, Coralville, IA).32 All
diameter readings were taken at diastole. FMD was calculated
as % change: (peak diameterpostischemia�diameterbaseline)/
diameterbaseline9100. The rats were kept at 37°C on a
thermal blanket throughout to avoid inconsistent vasodilation
from anesthesia-induced hypothermia.
Marijuana Cigarettes, Approvals, and Security
Considerations
Acquisition and possession of marijuana was approved by the
Drug Enforcement Agency, the Food and Drug Administration,
the Research Advisory Panel of California, and the University of
California, San Francisco Office of Environmental Health and
Safety. Marijuana cigarettes (regular marijuana at 4.5% tetrahy-
drocannabinol [THC] and “placebo” THC-free marijuana at
0.01% THC, each weighing 0.9 g) were supplied by RTI
International (Research Triangle Park, NC), contracted through
the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Marijuana was from
sinsemilla (seedless) plants with stems removed, and consisted
of leaf fragments, small leaves, bracts, and buds, and was grown
in the absence of pesticides. The cigarettes were machine rolled

 with the same dimensions as standard tobacco cigarettes and
fit in our cigarette smoking machine without further modifica-
tion. Upon arrival, marijuana cigarettes were individually
wrapped in plastic wrap and numbered, and were stored in
airtight containers at �20°C. In accordance with requirements
from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the cigarettes were stored
in a padlocked freezer with high-security lock and a code-
deactivated open-door alarm that communicated with the
University of California Police Department, physically attached
to a heavy Steelcase desk, in a controlled-access room outfitted
with a solid door with high-security lock, and hinge pins that
were nonremovable from the outside. Prior to each experiment,
marijuana cigarettes were humidified overnight at room
temperature by placing them in an airtight container over
50 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution as per instructions
on use from RTI, in a locked desk drawer. Logs documenting
removal of cigarettes from the freezer and desk were kept as
required by the Drug Enforcement Agency. Cigarettes were
used within 5 minutes after humidification.
Tobacco Cigarettes
Marlboro Red cigarettes were humidified overnight by place-
ment over 16% glycerol in water, as in our previous tobacco
studies.34,35
Exposure of Rats to SHS
We used a modified cigarette smoking system described
previously for tobacco SHS experiments.34 Briefly, the system
collects sidestream smoke from the burning tip of the
cigarette in a 21-L Plexiglas exposure chamber as a ventilator
pump simulates human puffing. (Sidestream smoke com-
prises the majority of SHS and is a well-accepted laboratory
model for it, and is referred to as SHS here.) A Sidepak
AM510 personal aerosol monitor (TSI, Shoreview, MN),
calibrated for cigarette smoke particles and excluding those
>2.5 lm, monitors the concentration of respirable suspended
particles (RSP) in the exposure chamber and exhausts back
into the chamber. Smoke is collected in the chamber and the
cigarette is extinguished, and excess smoke is then vented
from the chamber to obtain the desired starting concentra-
tion. Air in the chamber is mixed with a small fan. The wall of
the chamber contains a gasket through which the nose of an
anesthetized rat is inserted to breathe the smoky air. Because
the system requires the cigarette to be extinguished before
exposure of the rat, adsorption of smoke particles to surfaces
in the exposure chamber causes a continued progressive
decrease in the levels over time; thus, most of the exposure
occurs over the first several minutes.
Tobacco cigarettes were smoked according to standard
conditions (ISO Standard 3308:2012, one 35-mL puff of 2-s
duration once/min). Marijuana cigarettes were smoked using
the same protocol, with the exception that the puff duration
was 1 s for our initial 30-minute exposure experiment due to
an instrument calibration error discovered afterward. The
difference between a 1-s puff and a 2-s puff is not expected to
have a substantial effect on the sidestream smoke generated.
For each experiment, a single cigarette was lit, smoked for
3 minutes, and extinguished, and particle concentration in the
exposure chamber was adjusted until the desired RSP starting
concentration was reached (Figure 1). At that time, an
individual anesthetized rat, after baseline FMD measurement,
was exposed for the specified duration and was then returned
to the ultrasound system for postsmoke FMD measurement.
Negative controls consisted of the same duration of exposure
to nonsmoky air in the exposure chamber. As in our tobacco
study,34 it took roughly 10 minutes after the end of the
exposure period to prepare the rat for an initial postexposure
FMD measurement. For some experiments, we measured
FMD again 30 minutes later to evaluate recovery.
Generation of Marijuana Smoke in the Absence of
Paper Smoke
We wrapped a piece of stainless steel mesh (0.0055-inch wire
diameter, 80 9 80 openings/inch, 0.007-inch opening width;
McMaster-Carr,
Los
Angeles,
CA)
around
a
marijuana
cigarette, then opened the piece of mesh with the cigarette
remaining on top of it, sliced the paper longitudinally, and slid
the paper out while keeping the rod of marijuana intact,
Figure 1. Experimental design for FMD measurement and
smoke exposures. FMD was measured by micro-ultrasound
measurements of femoral artery diameter before and after
transient (5 minutes) surgical occlusion of the common iliac
artery. Anesthetized rats were exposed to SHS for varying
durations and FMD was measured 3 times (before exposure,
10 minutes after end of exposure to evaluate impairment, and
30 minutes later to evaluate recovery). As described in the
Results section for specific experiments, the smoke exposure was
either for 30 minutes or 1 minute, and initial FMD impairment or
baseline diameter changes were measured either within 10 min-
utes or 25 to 30 minutes after the end of exposure. In some
cases, FMD recovery was assessed every 30 minutes over a total
duration of 90 minutes. FMD indicates flow-mediated vasodila-
tion; SHS, secondhand smoke.

 preventing the packed marijuana rod from loosening so that
the burning of the mesh-rolled cigarette would be as similar as
possible to that of a paper-rolled cigarette. The mesh was
then rewrapped around the marijuana and the resulting rod
was inserted into the cigarette hole in the smoke system. The
regular protocol for smoking cigarettes was used from that
point.
Endothelium-Independent Vasodilation Induced
by Nitroglycerin
Endothelium-independent vasodilation was induced by intra-
venous injection of nitroglycerin at 8.8910�5 mol/L as a 0.1-
mL/100 g bolus into the tail vein.
Statistics
Power calculation based on standard deviations from within-
group comparisons in several of our previous repeated-
measures FMD experiments determined that n=8/group was
sufficient to detect FMD change of 3.5 percentage points
(absolute values) at a power of 0.8 and significance level of
0.05. For comparisons involving multiple groups and times,
we fit a 2-factor (exposure condition and time) repeated-
measures analysis of variance to all the data at once using a
mixed model estimated with restricted maximum likelihood
estimation with an unstructured covariance matrix of resid-
uals, then tested for differences over time and across
exposure conditions using contrasts and pairwise compar-
isons, adjusted for multiple comparisons using the �

Results
Marijuana SHS With and Without THC Impaired
FMD
As in our tobacco cigarette SHS study,34 we exposed groups
of rats to 30 minutes of marijuana SHS at 2 starting
concentrations (�670 and �210 lg/m3 RSP), typical of high
and moderate tobacco SHS levels in smoky restaurants,36 and
to smoke-free air in the exposure chamber as a negative
control (Figure 2A). Because THC can cause vasodilation
directly, which might interfere with a functional assay based
on vasodilation, we included an extra control group exposed
to SHS from THC-free marijuana (in which cannabinoids were
removed) at �670 lg/m3 RSP.
Marijuana SHS at both doses, but not control chamber air,
significantly and substantially impaired FMD (Figure 2B,
Table). FMD had not recovered at 40 minutes postexposure.
Exposure to THC-free marijuana SHS impaired FMD as much
as exposure to regular marijuana SHS, confirming that the
impairment was not caused by THC.
Mindful of the potential vasodilatory effects of THC,37 we
also compared the baseline (pre-occlusion) artery diameter
before and after smoke exposure to detect any vasodilation
not due to the transient occlusion and restoration of flow.
Significant baseline vasodilation was not observed in any
group (Figure 2C, Table).

Vascular Impairment by Marijuana Secondhand Smoke

 SHS-Induced Impairment of FMD Did Not Require
Rolling Paper
Our
hypothesis
that
FMD
is
impaired
by
combustion
products common to smoke from burned plant material
raises the question of whether FMD is impaired by smoke
from burned rolling paper, rather than the tobacco or
marijuana. The question is relevant because some people
smoke marijuana in pipes. We tested the hypothesis that
impairment is dependent on paper smoke by assembling
marijuana cigarettes in which the paper was replaced by a
fine stainless steel mesh (Figure 3A) to mimic the proper-
ties of rolling paper, which is ventilated. In a confirmatory
group of 4 rats, FMD was significantly impaired to a similar
extent as that by regular marijuana cigarettes (Figure 3B,
Table). Since these mesh cigarettes were prepared using
the THC-free marijuana, the results confirm that FMD is
impaired by SHS from marijuana lacking both THC and
rolling paper.
One Minute of Marijuana SHS Impaired FMD
Because most of the exposure during our 30-minute period
occurred during the first 10 minutes, the question remained
of whether a very brief exposure impairs FMD. We previously
reported that tobacco SHS exposure for 1 minute at the high
restaurant level (�670 lg/m3 RSP) impairs FMD,34 so we
repeated that experiment with marijuana SHS at comparable
particle concentration. FMD was substantially decreased by
1 minute of marijuana SHS with and without THC (Figure 4A,
Table). Measurement of pre-occlusion baseline diameter
revealed that the marijuana SHS directly induced vasodilation,
even with the THC-free marijuana. This result was in contrast
to our previous experiment (Figure 2) in which rats were
exposed to 30 minutes of declining RSP levels that fell to
roughly zero before postexposure FMD was measured, with
no observed smoke-induced vasodilation. To reconcile this
apparent contradiction, we exposed another group to mari-
juana SHS and waited a total of 25 minutes after the 1-minute
exposure before measuring FMD. This allowed the baseline
vasodilation to subside, but FMD still decreased (Figure 4B,
Table), confirming that 1 minute of marijuana SHS exposure
causes endothelial dysfunction that persists beyond any
transient vasodilatory effects of the marijuana.
All cannabinoids are missing from the THC-free marijuana,
and we did not observe significant baseline vasodilation after
1 minute of tobacco SHS in our previous report34 (P=0.23;
data not shown). The identity of the noncannabinoid vasodila-
tor in marijuana is unknown.
Marijuana SHS-Induced Endothelial Dysfunction
Lasted for at Least 90 Minutes
In our previous studies with tobacco SHS, FMD recovered
completely by 30 minutes after the initial postexposure
measurement.34 In contrast, when we exposed rats to THC-
free marijuana SHS for 1 minute and then measured FMD at
30-minute intervals, FMD remained depressed in most of the
rats until at least 90 minutes later (Figure 4C, Table).
Impairment of FMD by Marijuana SHS Did Not
Prevent Endothelium-Independent Vasodilation
To determine whether the substantial impairment of FMD
involved functional or physical inhibition of vascular smooth
muscle function, we performed a separate experiment in
which FMD was impaired by 1 minute of marijuana SHS as
before, and then after impaired FMD was confirmed, an
intravenous bolus of nitroglycerin was injected to induce
endothelium-independent vasodilation. This injection caused
vasodilation even while FMD was still impaired, as confirmed
by a subsequent FMD measurement after the nitroglycerin
effect had subsided (Figure 5, Table). Therefore, the impair-
ment of FMD by marijuana SHS was mediated by an
endothelium-dependent mechanism, not a direct effect on
the smooth muscle of the vessel wall.
Recovery of FMD Impaired by Marijuana SHS Was
Slower Than Recovery From Tobacco SHS
We previously observed that impaired FMD recovered within
30 minutes after exposure to tobacco SHS.34,35 In contrast,
1 minute of exposure to marijuana SHS in the experiment
shown in Figure 4 caused impairment of FMD that lasted
for at least 90 minutes. To follow up on this historical
observation with a direct comparison, we exposed 3 groups

ever, recovery of FMD to pre-exposure values was essen-
tially complete by 30 minutes postexposure to tobacco,
consistent with our previous results,34,35 whereas recovery
from marijuana SHS exposure had not yet occurred at
30 minutes, consistent with the results in Figures 4 and 5
that marijuana caused impairment that persisted for as long
as 90 minutes. The similar initial impairment of FMD by
marijuana and tobacco SHS, coupled with the longer time
to recovery from marijuana SHS exposure, together suggest
that marijuana SHS exposure may cause more cardiovas-
cular harm than tobacco SHS.
Discussion
There is growing awareness that marijuana use in general may
lead to cardiovascular complications,38–40 an effect normally
ascribed to THC, but little attention has been paid specifically
to the effects of the generic biomass combustion compo-
nents. Our inclusion of control groups exposed to SHS from
marijuana lacking cannabinoids confirms that THC was not
required for the impairment of FMD. Similarly and notably, the
finding that FMD is impaired by exposure to marijuana SHS,
which is chemically similar to tobacco SHS but does not
contain nicotine, confirms that the decrease in FMD caused
by tobacco SHS is not dependent on nicotine. Together, our
results demonstrate that in rats, FMD is impaired by 1 or

dose THC-free marijuana SHS (608�13 lg/m3; n=8); errors are SD. Because smoke levels did not decline substantially over 1 minute, the
average concentration over time is listed. Colors track individual rats through the FMD graphs and corresponding diameter graphs. FMD in rats
exposed to SHS from regular marijuana or THC-free marijuana decreased, whereas baseline diameter increased significantly by 8.2% for regular
marijuana and 9.2% for THC-free marijuana. B, Waiting for 25 minutes post-end of exposure before FMD measurement (562�16 lg/m3; n=7)
revealed substantial impairment of FMD without concomitant baseline vasodilation. C, FMD impairment for at least 90 minutes (617�10 lg/
m3; n=8) with no significant improvement. Removal of 1 potential outlier (red line) would result in a significant partial improvement at
90 minutes postexposure relative to 30 minutes (P=0.019), but all postexposure values would still be depressed relative to pre-exposure with
P<0.0005. FMD indicates flow-mediated vasodilation; SHS, secondhand smoke; THC, tetrahydrocannabinol.

 tobacco, either the products of combustion or other generic
plant chemicals that persist after combustion.
The mechanism by which tobacco smoke impairs endothe-
lial function, and by extension, how marijuana smoke exerts
similar effects, is incompletely understood. Chronic exposure
to tobacco smoke results in changes in the serum that can
directly lower the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase
in cultured endothelial cells, thereby lowering the production
of nitric oxide, in a manner involving increased oxidative
stress.41,42 However, the mechanism by which smoke induces
these changes, and the identity of the mediators of the effect,
are unclear. Given the chemical similarity between marijuana
and tobacco smoke,2 it is likely that the chemicals or the
ultrafine particles leading to these changes in the endothelium
are common to both kinds of smoke.
The gaps in our knowledge about how tobacco smoke
exerts its adverse cardiovascular effects have not prevented
the findings that tobacco SHS is harmful from having a
considerable impact on public health policy, smoke-free laws,
physician advice to their patients, and individual behavior. As
legal marijuana use increases, public exposure to marijuana
SHS may also increase. This demonstration that marijuana
SHS exerts adverse effects on endothelial function in rats
that are similar to effects of tobacco SHS on both rats and
humans should help to inform similar policy and behavioral
discussions. Recent policy debates in municipalities such as
Ontario, which initially proposed to allow people with
prescriptions to smoke marijuana in enclosed locations
including theaters43 and then reversed the policy,44 exem-
plify the risks of assuming that marijuana SHS is harmless,

 and illustrate the importance of evidence that marijuana SHS
shares at least some adverse health physiological effects
with tobacco SHS.
While the public health community has strongly advised
people to avoid tobacco SHS for many years, it has not made
comparable pronouncements about marijuana SHS, primarily
because the evidence has not been available that it could
elicit similar adverse effects. The public’s perception of risk
from marijuana SHS has thus been limited to a few publicized
studies. Marijuana SHS exposure was recently reported to
lead to minor increases in heart rate and mild impairment of
cognitive function in humans, but only under unventilated
conditions with high smoke levels,45 presumably due to the
THC. Mittleman et al38 reported that active marijuana use
increased the risk of experiencing a heart attack roughly 5-
fold within the next hour. Because THC has direct effects on
heart rate and blood pressure, the authors focused on the
potential link between the elevated heart attack risk and the
THC. It is also possible that the increased heart attack risk
was caused by the adverse effects of smoke on endothelial
function.
A limitation of the study is that the typical ambient levels of
marijuana SHS have not been systematically measured in real-
world situations, in contrast to what is known about tobacco
SHS. The exposure levels of tobacco SHS on which our
conditions were based can reasonably be expected to exist
for marijuana SHS at parties, rock concerts, and other
situations in which multiple people are smoking marijuana at
any given time, but this remains unconfirmed. Our under-
standing of the relative risks of exposure in different social
situations would benefit greatly from a comprehensive study
of particle levels under these circumstances. Nonetheless, the
smoke concentrations in our study were low enough that the
smoke was not visible during the exposures in the clear
exposure chamber (Figure 7).
Since this was a rodent model, specific parameters such as
the exposure times and exact durations of impairment may
not completely match the corresponding properties of
exposure in humans. However, the process of FMD in rats
as we measured it shows great similarity to FMD in humans,
as shown by extensive physiological and pharmacological
validation as we have described previously.32 Moreover, rats
and humans show comparable responses to similar tobacco
smoke exposure conditions.26–28,34,35 Because our under-
standing of human cardiovascular consequences of marijuana
use has been limited to retrospective association studies,38–40
our
ability
to
perform
prospective,
controlled
rodent
experiments fills a crucial gap in our understanding of the
rapid consequences of marijuana SHS exposure that can
be extrapolated to humans.
Increasing legalization of marijuana makes it more impor-
tant than ever to understand the consequences of exposure
to secondhand marijuana smoke. The similarity of the
chemical composition of SHS from tobacco and marijuana,
along with our observation that both kinds of smoke can
impair endothelial function, indicate that marijuana SHS has
adverse cardiovascular effects in rats and suggest that it may
have similar adverse effects in humans. It is important that
the public, medical personnel, and policymakers understand
that exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke is not
necessarily harmless. Our findings suggest that SHS should
be avoided whether the source is tobacco or marijuana.
