t is well-recognized that moderate alcohol intake has long-
term cardiovascular benefits, but even protective exposures 
can lead to acutely increased risk. Alcohol has biphasic and 
complex physiological effects that result in both higher and 
lower cardiovascular risk depending on the amount consumed, 
drinking frequency, and the outcome under study.1,2 For 
instance, moderate and high alcohol intake is associated with 
increased heart rate,3 electromechanical delay,4 and impaired 
fibrinolysis5 within hours of intake, but there are long-term 
improvements in blood pressure6 and coagulation.7 In addi-
tion, the risk of cardiovascular events triggered by alcohol 
may be modified by usual drinking patterns.1 There has been 
no comprehensive study to investigate the acute cardiovas-
cular risk following alcohol intake. Therefore, we conducted 
a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of the 
evidence on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic 
stroke (IS), and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) in the hours and days 
after alcohol intake. The primary hypothesis defined before 
initiation of the literature review was that, in comparison with 
no alcohol consumption, moderate alcohol consumption is 
associated with an immediately higher risk of cardiovascular 
events that becomes protective after 24 hours, whereas heavy 
alcohol drinking is associated with higher cardiovascular risk 
both immediately and in the following days.
Clinical Perspective on p 987
Methods
We performed a systematic review, meta-analysis, and dose–response 
meta-analysis in accordance with the Meta-Analysis of Observational 
Background—Although considerable research describes the cardiovascular effects of habitual moderate and heavy alcohol 
consumption, the immediate risks following alcohol intake have not been well characterized. Based on its physiological 
effects, alcohol may have markedly different effects on immediate and long-term risk.
Methods and Results—We searched CINAHL, Embase, and PubMed from inception to March 12, 2015, supplemented with 
manual screening for observational studies assessing the association between alcohol intake and cardiovascular events 
in the following hours and days. We calculated pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the association 
between alcohol intake and myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke using DerSimonian and Laird 
random-effects models to model any alcohol intake or dose–response relationships of alcohol intake and cardiovascular 
events. Among 1056 citations and 37 full-text articles reviewed, 23 studies (29 457 participants) were included. Moderate 
alcohol consumption was associated with an immediately higher cardiovascular risk that was attenuated after 24 hours, 
and even protective for myocardial infarction and hemorrhagic stroke (≈2–4 drinks: relative risk=30% lower risk) and 
protective against ischemic stroke within 1 week (≈6 drinks: 19% lower risk). In contrast, heavy alcohol drinking was 
associated with higher cardiovascular risk in the following day (≈6–9 drinks: relative risk=1.3–2.3) and week (≈19–30 
drinks: relative risk=2.25–6.2).
Conclusions—There appears to be a consistent finding of an immediately higher cardiovascular risk following any alcohol 
consumption, but, by 24 hours, only heavy alcohol intake conferred continued risk.

Studies in Epidemiology8 protocol throughout the design, implemen-
tation, analysis, and reporting for this study.
Data Sources and Searches
One person (Dr Mostofsky) performed a literature search of the 
CINAHL, Embase, and PubMed databases from January 1966 
through March 2015 by using free-text words and Medical Subject 
Headings terms without language restrictions. We also reviewed the 
reference lists of retrieved articles.
Study Selection
Using a standardized form, 2 readers (Dr Mostofsky and Mr Chahal) 
independently and in duplicate reviewed the list of identified articles 
and extracted data from selected articles with disagreements adju-
dicated by consensus. We selected studies with abstracts suggesting 
they were relevant. Studies were eligible for review if: (1) the design 
was a cohort, case-control, self-controlled case series or case-cross-
over study; (2) the investigators reported relative risks (RRs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between alcohol 
intake and MI, IS, or HS; (3) the investigators retrospectively evalu-
ated alcohol intake directly from the participant or by proxy for the 
1-week period before event onset. We excluded studies that evaluated 
the impact of laboratory-administered alcohol on myocardial isch-
emia, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, or intermediate outcomes such as 
blood pressure or cardiovascular reactivity.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
For each study, we recorded the following details: first author, year of 
publication, study location, hazard period, referent period or sample, 
number of cases and noncases at each level of alcohol intake, amount 
of alcohol consumed before event onset, RRs and corresponding 95% 
CIs, and covariates included in statistical models. When analyses of 
the same population were reported more than once, we included the 
largest study for the appropriate analysis. In case-control studies, 
cases and noncases were interviewed about recent alcohol consump-
tion, and potential confounding by between-person differences were 
addressed with matching and statistical adjustment. In case-crossover 
studies, each case was interviewed about recent alcohol intake and 
that same individual’s alcohol intake at other times. By comparing the 
same individual at different times, confounding by fixed character-
istics is eliminated. When case-crossover studies reported estimates 
using either a referent of usual frequency of alcohol intake over sev-
eral months or a referent of intake at the same time on the previous 
day, we included the estimates based on usual frequency. When stud-
ies reported estimates from several models, we included the estimates 
from the model with the greatest control for potential confounding. 
We also recorded information on whether the study was restricted to 
incident events, whether both fatal and nonfatal events were included, 
and whether the study was restricted to current drinkers.
We qualitatively assessed study quality by recording the timing 
between the onset of the cardiovascular event and ascertainment of 
alcohol intake, whether alcohol intake was assessed with an interview 
or questionnaire and whether proxy respondents provided informa-
tion on alcohol intake.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Details of the meta-analysis methods are provided in the online-only 
Data Supplement Appendix and are summarized briefly here.
Meta-Analysis of Any Alcohol Intake
For each outcome and hazard period, we included 1 RR and corre-
sponding 95% CI per study reporting the change in cardiovascular 
risk immediately following any alcohol intake in comparison with 
no alcohol intake. For studies that did not report an overall RR, we 
first pooled the RRs across sex and levels of alcohol consumption 
by using a random-effects model. We used DerSimonian and Laird9 
random-effects models to pool the RRs across studies for each out-
come and each hazard period.
Dose–Response Meta-Analysis
To examine the impact of the amount of alcohol consumed prior to 
event onset, we conducted a dose–response meta-analysis for each 
outcome and the risk in the day and week following intake. For each 
study, we assigned the median or mean grams of alcohol intake for 
each exposure level to the corresponding RR. To examine potential 
nonlinear relationships between alcohol intake and cardiovascular 
risk, we performed 2-stage random-effects dose–response meta-anal-
yses.10 We estimated the predicted relative risk by comparing specific 
levels of alcohol intake with no alcohol intake based on the linear or 
model or spline transformation, as appropriate.
For the analyses of any intake and the dose–response analyses, 
we evaluated heterogeneity across studies with the Cochrane Q χ2 
test11 and we calculated the I2 statistic to quantify the proportion of 
between-study heterogeneity attributable to variability in the associa-
tion rather than sampling variation.12
Statistical analyses were conducted with 2-tailed α set at ≤0.05 
for statistical significance. We used Stata (version 13.0, StataCorp, 
College Station, TX) packages to conduct the meta-analyses of any 
alcohol intake (metan), dose–response analyses (glst), and evalu-
ation of potential publication bias (metabias) and information bias 
(metainf).
Results
The literature search identified 1056 publications. We 
excluded 411 duplicates, and 623 articles were excluded after 
review of the title or abstract. An additional 15 articles were 
identified from manual searches and review of bibliographies 
of relevant studies. After reviewing the articles, another 14 
articles were excluded, resulting in a meta-analysis of 23 arti-
cles (Figure 1). The Table in the online-only Data Supplement 
summarizes the characteristics of the eligible studies. The 
meta-analysis included 16 case-control and 7 case-crossover 
studies published from 1987 to 2015. Combined, there were 
29 457 participants including 17 966 cases of MI, 2599 cases 
of IS, and 1262 cases of HS. Eleven studies were conducted in 
Europe, 1 in Russia, 4 in the United States, 2 in New Zealand, 
and 4 in Australia; 1 study included participants from 52 
countries worldwide. Two studies included men only, one 
included women only, and the remaining 20 studies enrolled 
men and women, but only 6 presented sex-specific estimates, 
with one reporting an infinite RR for women, so we included 
the estimate combining all participants. Fourteen studies 
were restricted to incident events. Alcohol consumption was 
assessed with a questionnaire in 3 studies and with interviews 
in all others. In 10 studies, the estimated median alcohol con-
sumption in the highest category was >4 drinks per day for 
men and women combined or for men but not women.

Myocardial Infarction
One study13 reported a higher risk of sudden cardiac death 
within 2 hours after alcohol consumption (RR, 3.00; 95% CI, 
1.61–5.68), but we did not include this estimate in our analy-
ses because the cause of death may have been attributable to 
cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias. Five case-crossover14–18 and 
4 case-control studies19–22 evaluated the association between

alcohol intake and the immediate risk of MI or major coronary 
event.20 There was a higher MI risk in the hour after alcohol 
intake than at other times and a modestly lower risk after 24 
hours. Two studies assessed MI risk within 1 week among 
men, with one21 reporting a lower MI risk (RR, 0.25; 95% 
CI, 0.13–0.50) after ≈18 g of alcohol in the past week and the 
other22 reporting higher risk of death from ischemic heart dis-
ease or MI after heavy alcohol intoxication for ≥2 days when 
the person is withdrawn from normal social life (RR, 3.57; 
95% CI, 1.65–7.73).
When accounting for the amount of alcohol consumed in 
the 24 hours before MI onset, there was a U-shaped associa-
tion (Pcurve<0.001) between alcohol intake and MI risk, with 
the greatest benefit following ≈28 g of alcohol (≈2 drinks) in 1 
day (RR, 0.67) and a higher risk following ≈108 g (≈9 drinks) 
in 1 day (RR, 1.59). Within a week following alcohol con-
sumption, there was a lower risk of MI with moderate alcohol 
intake but a higher risk following heavy alcohol consumption.
There was no indication of small-study effects for stud-
ies of MI risk in the day (Egger P=0.18) and week (Egger 
P=0.86) following alcohol consumption. Results were similar 
in sensitivity analyses excluding 1 estimate at a time.
Ischemic Stroke
One case-crossover23 and 8 case-control studies24–31 examined 
the association between alcohol intake and the immediate risk 
of IS. One study27 with RRs by level of alcohol intake could 
not be included in the dose–response meta-analysis because 
information on the sample size at each level of consumption 
was not reported. There was evidence of a higher IS risk within 
an hour of any alcohol intake, and a suggestion of protective 
benefits thereafter, although the results were inconsistent.
In the dose–response analysis, there was a higher IS risk 
with higher alcohol intake in the preceding day, although this 
linear association was only based on 2 studies with dose infor-
mation. There was a U-shaped association (Pcurve=0.007) for 
risk in the following week. In comparison with no alcohol 
consumption, there was a 19% lower risk of IS in the week 
following ≈75 g of alcohol (≈6 drinks/wk) but a 2.25-fold 
higher IS risk in the week following 225 g (≈19 drinks) that 
continues to climb with higher amounts of alcohol consump-
tion. The dose–response association was apparent for both 
men and for women. There was no indication of publication 
bias (Egger P=0.39). In sensitivity analyses excluding 1 study 
at a time, the RR for IS within 1 day was lower (RR, 0.82; 
95% CI, 0.66–1.01) when we removed 1 study’s results29 and 
higher (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.74–1.60) when we removed the 
estimate from another study,18 but a similar sensitivity analysis 
had no impact on the RR for IS risk within a week.
In sensitivity analyses, we included estimates from 
case-control studies that did not account for confound-
ers.24,32,33 The estimated risk in 24 hours was similar to the 
preliminary analysis. Five studies26,32,34–36 enrolled cases with 
either IS or HS, but after restricting the analyses to studies 
that accounted for potential confounders and at least some 
exposed cases and controls, only 1 study26 with a combined 
end point was included. Because the study was composed of 
81 cases of IS and only 9 cases of HS, the RR was included 
in the analysis of IS risk; results were similar when this esti-
mate was excluded.

Hemorrhagic Stroke
One case-crossover37 and 6 case-control studies22,27,38–41 exam-
ined the immediate risk of HS following alcohol intake, with 
most studies reporting a higher risk within a day or a week 
after any consumption.
In the dose–response meta-analysis, there was a U-shaped 
association (Pcurve=0.02) between alcohol consumption and HS 
risk after 24 hours. In comparison with no intake, consump-
tion of 48 g (≈4 drinks) was associated with a 38% lower HS 
risk, whereas drinking 81 g (≈7 drinks) was associated with a 
1.26-fold higher HS risk in the following day. This association 
was apparent for both men and women. There was a linear 
association for HS risk within a week of alcohol consumption, 
with no evidence of protective benefits.
There was no indication of publication bias for studies of 
HS risk in the day (Egger P=0.25) and week (Egger’s P=0.19) 
following any alcohol intake. Results were similar in sensitiv-
ity analyses excluding 1 estimate at a time.
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, moderate alcohol 
consumption was associated with an immediately higher risk 
of cardiovascular events, but, after 24 hours, there was a lower 
risk of MI and HS and, after 1 week, there was a lower risk of 
IS, consistent with previous research showing cardiovascular 
benefits of habitual intake. Heavy alcohol drinking was asso-
ciated with higher cardiovascular risk in the following hours 
and days.
Immediately following alcohol intake, there are both 
harmful and protective physiological responses.7 Within 1 to 
3 hours, a single dose of alcohol increases heart rate,3 inter-
arterial electromechanical delay,4 and plasminogen activator

inhibitor levels,5 but by 12 to 24 hours, an alcohol dose con-
sistent with 2 alcoholic beverages causes transient improve-
ments in flow-mediated vasodilatation, endothelial function,7 
and fibrinolytic factors.5
Within weeks of regular intake, there are improvements in 
inflammatory markers, lipid profile, and adipokines and insu-
lin sensitivity.7 Habitual moderate alcohol consumption (1–2 
drinks per day) is associated with improvements in high-den-
sity lipoprotein cholesterol, heart rate variability,42 endothe-
lial function, insulin sensitivity, coagulation and fibrinolytic 
cascades,7 and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and IS 
and HS.43 However, heavy drinking (3 to ≥4 drinks per day) is 
associated with a higher risk of hypertension,6 diabetes mel-
litus, cardiovascular disease, IS and HS, and mortality after 
MI.43–45 Usual drinking habits may modify the acute physi-
ological response to alcohol. Therefore, the 2015 Dietary 
Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended that, if alco-
hol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation—up 
to 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men.46 
The results of this meta-analysis show that there may also be 
an immediate risk of cardiovascular events even if moderate 
habitual consumption yields cardioprotective benefits.
Our dose–response analysis suggests that after 24 hours, 
moderate drinkers may experience a lower risk of a car-
diovascular event in comparison with other times, whereas 
heavy drinking is associated with a higher risk even after 24 
hours. This is supported by previous work showing that the 
health effects of alcohol intake depend on both the amount 
and the pattern of consumption. Heavy episodic drinking, 
defined as ≥4 alcoholic beverages within 1 to 2 hours, has 
harmful effects, even if individuals who binge only drink 1 
or 2 days per week, resulting in the same average alcohol 
intake per week that is known to yield cardioprotective 
benefits. Among men, drinking a small amount of alcohol 
regularly (eg, 1–2 drinks/d, 4 days/wk) lowers cardiovascu-
lar risk more than drinking the same total weekly amount 
but on fewer days per week.1 Therefore, it is possible that 
over time, individuals who frequently drink small amounts 
of alcohol may experience a temporarily heightened risk, but 
this may be offset in part by the subsequent protective bene-
fits in the hours after consumption, whereas consuming large 
amounts of alcohol at once may result in a sharply higher 
immediate risk, and consuming large amounts of alcohol in 
repeated bouts may result in a higher long-term risk, as well. 
The results of studies examining a 1-week risk period are 
unclear because most studies did not provide information 
on the pattern of drinking in the week before the event; it 
is possible that some people only drank early in the previ-
ous week, some only drank immediately before the event, 
and some drank alcohol on several occasions in the previous 
week. However, 1 case-control study31 reported that among 
women who drank alcohol in the past week, those who drank 
in the past 24 hours had a lower risk of stroke than never 
drinkers, and the risk was even lower for women who did not 
drink in the past 24 hours. This supports our hypothesis that 
there may be protective benefits in the 24 hours after moder-
ate alcohol intake, and perhaps the benefits are even greater 
in the following days.
The immediate impact of alcohol consumption may be 
influenced by usual alcohol intake. One study18 noted that 
the higher MI risk in the hour following alcohol consump-
tion was not apparent for daily drinkers. This may be attrib-
utable to alcohol tolerance whereby habitual intake leads to 
upregulation of enzymes that metabolize alcohol, resulting

response model. The lowest value of zero (nondrinkers) was used to estimate all relative risks. The vertical axis is on a log scale. The

in a lower physiological response to each drink.47 Although 
case-crossover studies are restricted to current drinkers 
by design because only cases reporting alcohol in the past 
year contribute information, only 2 case-control studies10,11 
conducted analyses restricted to current drinkers and 6 
studies19,20,28,29,31,39 adjusted for usual intake. In the remain-
ing studies, some of the former drinkers may have stopped 
drinking alcohol because of illness, previous alcohol abuse, 
or prescription medications that cannot be taken with alco-
hol, which would overestimate the health benefits of alco-
hol intake.48 It is possible that some people abstained from 
alcohol in response to prodromal symptoms before clinical 
onset of the cardiovascular event, resulting in an underesti-
mate of recent intake and a biased estimate. However, the 
results were similar in studies18,23 that used symptom onset 
rather than hospital admission time to define event onset 
and when they conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to 
cases with no preclinical symptoms. In 1 study,49 the results 
were weaker but still evident after accounting for prodromal 
symptoms.
Habitual moderate alcohol consumption is associated with 
lower risk of heart disease in both sexes, but the amount of 
alcohol associated with cardiovascular benefits is lower among 
women than among men. Only some of the studies reported 
results separately for men and for women, so we could not 
statistically evaluate whether sex modifies the magnitude or 
timing of heightened acute risk, but higher cardiovascular 
risk following higher levels of alcohol intake was apparent 
for both men and women. There were no studies that exam-
ined whether the immediate risk following alcohol intake was 
modified by medical history, but, in studies of habitual alcohol 
consumption, the benefits of moderate intake were similar for 
people with existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes mel-
litus and those in the general population.45
Previous studies have reported racial/ethnic differences 
in the magnitude of the association between habitual alcohol 
consumption and risk of cardiovascular events17,50 that may 
involve ethnic variations in the prevalence of genetic polymor-
phisms related to alcohol metabolism,51 cultural differences 
in past drinking, current drinking patterns, and associations 
between drinking patterns and other health risk factors and 
health problems.52 Future studies are needed to evaluate 
whether there is any racial/ethnic variation in the acute effects 
of alcohol intake on cardiovascular risk, and whether genetic 
differences may play a role.
Only 5 studies18,23,31,37,40 examined the association by drink 
type, so we could not evaluate whether the risk differs for 
wine, beer, or liquor consumption. In case-crossover studies 
of alcohol types and the acute risk of MI18 and IS,23 there was 
a suggestion that the acutely elevated risk in the hour after 
alcohol consumption was stronger for liquor than for beer or 
wine, and the protective association by 24 hours was appar-
ent for beer and wine but not for liquor. Other studies have 
reported that within 24 hours of intake, individuals drinking 
wine were protected from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and 
there was also a lower risk of ICH for those who recently con-
sumed liquor, but there was little association between either 
beer or fortified beverages and ICH,40 whereas another study 
reported similar risk of ICH by beverage type for the risk of 
ICH.37 However, none of the studies simultaneously evaluated 
beverage type and drinking patterns. Furthermore, previous 
studies have shown that all alcohol types have similar effects 
on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other biological 
markers of cardiovascular risk. Therefore, differences in the 
magnitude of the association between different alcohol types 
and cardiovascular outcomes are more likely to result from 
differences in lifestyle and the frequency and amount of alco-
hol intake rather than from different physiological effects of a 
specific beverage type.1,7,31
Some studies did not report enough details to be 
included in our dose–response meta-analysis, and none of 
the studies provided information on heavy episodic drink-
ing, defined as 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for men 
consumed within about 2 hours.53 However, our results sug-
gest that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with 
an immediately higher risk of cardiovascular events that 
is attenuated by 24 hours, whereas heavy alcohol drinking 
remains harmful.
We evaluated the influence of the timing and amount 
of alcohol on cardiovascular risk, but we could not address 
sources of bias in the original studies. However, although 
residual and unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out, 
most of the case-control studies accounted for many con-
founders and the self-matching in case-crossover studies elim-
inates confounding by slowly varying characteristics. All the 
included studies obtained information on alcohol intake after 
the cardiovascular event occurred, and alcohol intake may 
have been differentially misreported for cases and controls or 
in the case-crossover studies, for recent intake in comparison 
with usual intake. If recent alcohol intake impacted the cases’ 
ability or willingness to participate in the study, selection bias 
may have led to incorrect estimates, but many studies used 
proxy respondents when the case could not provide informa-
tion. Finally, we did not identify any unpublished studies and 
we cannot exclude the possibility that publication bias may 
have affected our results, but we found no evidence of such 
bias. There was no evidence of small study effects but tests for 
funnel plot asymmetry are not recommended when there are 
<10 studies. For some of the analyses, we observed between-
study heterogeneity and the results were slightly but not 
meaningfully altered when removing a single study, although 
the magnitude of the change was also impacted by the amount 
of alcohol. Although it may be tempting to infer that the het-
erogeneity in the magnitude of the association between differ-
ent cardiovascular events is attributable to different biological 
mechanisms linking alcohol and the outcome of interest, it 
may also be at least partially attributable to differences in the 
baseline risk and drinking patterns of the populations under 
study. Despite these limitations, this study is the first attempt 
to understand comprehensively the interplay between dose 
and timing of alcohol intake and the immediate risks and ben-
efits on both MI and stroke.
In summary, our results suggest that alcohol intake is 
associated with an immediately higher risk of cardiovascu-
lar events, but after 24 hours, there is a lower risk of MI and 
HS, and, within 1 week, there is a lower risk of IS, whereas 
heavy drinking continues to confer higher risk even after 
24 hours.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIvE
There is consistent evidence that habitual moderate consumption is associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease, 
whereas heavy alcohol consumption may be harmful. However, the acute risks following alcohol intake have not been well 
characterized. Based on its physiological effects, alcohol may have markedly different effects on immediate and long-term 
risk. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that evaluated the associa-
tion between alcohol intake and myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke in the following hours and 
days. Based on data from 23 full-text articles (29 457 participants), moderate alcohol consumption was associated with an 
immediately higher cardiovascular risk that was attenuated after 24 hours, and even protective for myocardial infarction and 
hemorrhagic stroke, and protective against ischemic stroke within 1 week. In contrast, heavy alcohol drinking was associated 
with higher cardiovascular risk in the following day and week.
