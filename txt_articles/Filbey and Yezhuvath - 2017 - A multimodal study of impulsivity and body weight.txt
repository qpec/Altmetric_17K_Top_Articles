 A Multimodal Study of Impulsivity and Body
Weight: Integrating Behavioral, Cognitive, and
Neuroimaging Approaches
Francesca M. Filbey1 and Uma S. Yezhuvath2
Objective: Dimensions of impulsivity are related to obesity. Accordingly, characterization of impulsivity in
individuals with overweight and obesity holds promise for more targeted and effective intervention.
Methods: Forty-five individuals (13 males, mean age 5 32.6, mean body mass index [BMI] 5 30.7) were
recruited to determine the role of impulsivity in elevated body weight by evaluating: (1) trait impulsivity via
impulsive sensation-seeking scale (ImpSS), (2) state impulsivity via continuous performance test, and (3)
activation and integration of brain cognitive control regions via functional magnetic resonance imaging
during a response inhibition task (i.e., stop signal task).
Results: Positive correlations were found between BMI and trait (ImpSS) as well as state impulsivity
(continuous performance test, b). BMI was negatively correlated with regional activation in the temporal
lobe and insula during successful response inhibition. Further, there was a positive association between
BMI and functional connectivity between the right inferior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus dur-
ing successful response inhibition. Mediation analyses revealed that ImpSS mediated the relationship
between BMI and neural response in the right inferior frontal gyrus.
Conclusions: This multimodal study provides concordant evidence for behavioral, cognitive, and neural
markers of impulsivity and elevated BMI, highlighting the need to address inhibitory control mechanisms
for more effective weight management programs.

Introduction
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 70.7%
of
Americans
have
overweight
or
obesity
(body
mass
index,
BMI � 25
kg/m2)
(https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/databases.html).
Given that elevated body weight is associated with chronic medical
problems and because current prevention and intervention strategies
are largely ineffective, the determination of the etiologies that lead to
problems with weight is important for the development of more effec-
tive treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated underlying cognitive
factors that contribute toward obesity, including mechanisms related
to reward sensitivity and impulsivity (1,2). Unlike the frequently
reported increased reward sensitivity in those with high BMI (3), stud-
ies of impulsivity in populations with elevated weight have been
inconsistent (4-6). Specifically, while stable characteristics of impul-
sivity, such as personality traits, have been associated with elevated
weight, state or transient measures have not been consistent (4).
Among the cognitive domains, however, poor inhibitory control has
been most frequently associated with elevated weight (4). A recent
review suggested that inhibitory control (as assessed by the stop signal
task, SST) may be an indicator of developing unhealthy behaviors
and nonresponsiveness to weight loss interventions (4).
Inhibitory control mechanisms in those with elevated weight have
been examined using response inhibition tasks during functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The few existing studies have
concordant findings of neural hypoactivation during response inhibi-
tion in those with elevated weight. For example, Batterink et al.
(2010) showed an inverse association between prefrontal cortical
areas during a Go/NoGo fMRI task and BMI in adolescent girls (7).
Similar findings were reported in women using the SST (8) where

 women with BMI >30 kg/m2 had less neural response during inhibi-
tory control compared with those with BMI <22 kg/m2 despite simi-
lar SST behavioral performance. These neuroimaging findings sug-
gest that the association between impulsivity and elevated weight
may be mediated by hypoactivation of prefrontal control areas dur-
ing inhibitory control (9,10). To date, a study including males
remains to be conducted.
Our review of the literature highlights the need to better understand
the relationship between impulsivity and high BMI by using a multi-
variate approach in a sample of male and female individuals with
elevated weight. To that end, we measured trait and state dimensions
of impulsivity and determined the neural response and network func-
tional connectivity during a response inhibition task as a function of
weight in a group of adults with elevated BMI. We hypothesized
that, similar to previous reports, BMI will be positively related to
trait and state impulsivity and negatively related to neural response
during an inhibitory control task. We also tested mediation models
of these variables to determine the relationship between impulsivity
and elevated weight.
Methods
This study was approved by the University of New Mexico and Uni-
versity of Texas at Dallas Institutional Review Boards.
Participants
Forty-five individuals from the Albuquerque, NM, metro area pro-
vided informed consent to participate in this study (Table 1). Inclu-
sion criteria included right-handedness, 18 to 50 years of age,
English-speaking, and BMI �19 kg/m2. Individuals with Axis I or
neurological disorder, loss of consciousness >5 min, or MRI contra-
indications were excluded.
Procedure
All experiments took place at The Mind Research Network in Albu-
querque. Participants were instructed to abstain from caffeine for
4 h before the scan. Before scanning, participants were weighed on-
site, and BMI was calculated using the NIH BMI calculator (https://
www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/bmicalc.htm). During the
MRI scan, we collected a high-resolution anatomical scan for regis-
tration and localization of the fMRI data, a stop signal fMRI task,
and a cue-exposure fMRI task (reported in Ref. 3)).
Behavioral measures of impulsivity
To assess stable trait impulsivity that may be an antecedent to the
development of high BMI in the participants, we collected the 19-
item impulsive sensation-seeking scale (ImpSS) (11). To determine
momentary or state impulsivity that is reflective of current manifes-
tations of elevated weight, we collected the Conner’s continuous
performance test (CPT) (12). CPT outcome measures included
detectability (d’) and response bias (b). Detectability or d’ evaluates
the ability to discriminate between target and nontarget stimuli and
is, therefore, an indicator of attentiveness. b values characterize the
individual’s response style based on speed and accuracy of their
response that indicates impulsive or cautious decision-making.
Neuroimaging measures of impulsivity
MRI images were collected using a 3T Siemens whole-body scanner
with a 12-channel head phased-array coil combined with body coil
transmission. High-resolution structural MRI scans were collected
with a multi-echo MPRAGE (MEMPR) sequence with the following
parameters:
TR/TE/TI 5 2,300/2.74/900
ms,
flip
angle 5 88,
FOV 5 256 3 256 mm2, slab thickness 5 176, voxel size 5 1 3 1 3
1 mm3, number of echos 5 4, pixel bandwidth 5 650 Hz. fMRI scans
were collected using a gradient echo, echo-planar sequence with ramp
sampling correction using the intercommissural line (AC-PC) as a ref-
erence (TR: 2.0 s, TE: 27 ms, a: 708, matrix size: 64 3 64, 32 slices,
slice thickness: 3.5 mm, voxel size: 3 3 3 3 4 mm3). In order to
improve the signal dropout and warping in the OFC, a tilting acquisi-
tion was applied (13). Images were collected in the oblique axial plane
and whole-brain coverage was achieved for all participants.
During the fMRI scan, all of the participants completed the SST as
described by Aron and Poldrack (2006) (14) (details in Supporting
Information). The SST has been used to detect neural alterations in
prefrontal control activation in those with high impulsivity, such as
substance using populations (15), as well as those with elevated
weight (8).
Behavioral data analysis
We performed Pearson’s correlations between BMI and behavioral
and cognitive measures of impulsivity (ImpSS, CPT b and d’).
Additionally, stop signal reaction time (SSRT) from the SST was
calculated by the method proposed by Logan et al. (1984) (16). We
established independence in our data before SSRT calculation using
the method outlined by Verbruggen and Logan (2009) (17). The
data were also checked for any reactive adjustment strategy in Go
response time (GoRT) following StopFail trials. Significance was
determined at two-tailed P 5 0.01.
Neuroimaging data analysis
Preprocessing.
Functional imaging time series data were prepro-
cessed in Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) software (Well-
come Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) running
on Matlab 7.1 (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). Before starting the
statistical analysis, the first seven volumes of each EPI run were

 discarded to allow for T1 saturation effects. Following this, motion
correction was implemented using SPMs realignment module (18).
For each subject, sessions with motion greater than 3 mm (transla-
tion) or 3 degrees (rotation) were excluded from further analysis
resulting in one exclusion. Four other participants had high motion
in one or two runs of imaging data. For these participants, available
runs with motion below the selected threshold were included for fur-
ther analysis. Functional images were corrected for differences in
EPI slice acquisition times within each volume using the central
slice (16th) as the reference slice. The data were then normalized
(19) into the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space using
the template provided in SPM. The resultant time series was
smoothed using a 6 mm (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.
Individual-level analysis.
fMRI signal intensity was scaled by
its grand mean and the data was high-pass filtered (filter frequency
1/128.0 Hz) to reduce low frequency MR signal drifts. Serial corre-
lations in the fMRI signal were modeled by a first-degree autore-
gressive AR(1) model (20). For each participant, explanatory varia-
bles were created by convolving the onsets of the StopSuccess,
StopFail, and successful Go (GoSuccess) trials by the canonical
hemodynamic response function (HRF). These were entered as
regressors into the model along with the temporal derivative of the
HRF (included to improve model fit). Effect of residual head motion
was accounted for by including the motion parameters from the
realignment step as nuisance variables in the model. Standard voxel-
by-voxel GLM analysis (21) of the preprocessed functional time
series was performed against the resultant model, generating b maps
corresponding to each modeled condition. Next, because we were
interested in evaluating neural response during inhibitory control,
contrast images were generated for StopSuccess > GoSuccess condi-
tions. These contrast images were used for further group-level (ran-
dom effects) analysis.
Group-level analysis.
We performed a one-sample t-test and
simple regressions of the StopSuccess > GoSuccess contrast map
against the following measures: (a) BMI, (b) ImpSS, and (c) CPT
scores (b and d’). Statistical maps were generated wherein whole-
brain activations were identified at a threshold of P < 0.005, uncor-
rected for multiple comparisons at the voxel level. At the cluster
level, an FWE correction for multiple comparisons, a < 0.05, was
applied by computing the extent threshold “k” using the latest ver-
sion of the 3dFWHMx and 3dClustSim subroutines in AFNI (http://
afni.nimh.nih.gov). Since the spatial autocorrelation function of
noise in real fMRI data is not purely Gaussian-shaped, these subrou-
tines now use a non-Gaussian model for autocorrelation function to
estimate global smoothness, generate noise random fields, and com-
pute the cluster size threshold for a given (p, a) combination. The
anatomical localization for all regions of activation was found using
the PickAtlas software (22). For visualization and display of signifi-
cant activation, the z-maps were overlaid on the T1 canonical Mon-
treal Neurological Institute template provided within SPM.
Functional connectivity analysis.
We conducted psychophysio-
logic interaction (PPI) analyses to determine functional connectivity
between brain regions as a result of experimental or psychological
context (23). We determined regions of greater functional connectiv-
ity with the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) during the SST (Stop-
Success > GoSuccess) using the gPPI toolbox (24). We chose the
rIFG seed region given its widely replicated role during inhibition
of a prepotent motor response, particularly using the SST (25). The
rIFG is thought to integrate bottom–up sensory information with
top–down response-related information (26) and has been shown to
be activated irrespective of subsequent response (27).
We defined the rIFG using an approach that is sensitive to individ-
ual variability as previously described in the literature (28,29). For
our
data,
results
of
the
one-sample
t-test
for
the
StopSuc-
cess > GoSuccess activation maps showed robust activation within
the rIFG ROI with the group maxima located at x 5 52, y 5 28,
z 5 30. To ensure that the seed region consisted only of voxels that
were activated for the condition of interest and that the same ana-
tomical region was selected across subjects, we selected seed region
voxels for each subject based on the following criteria: (a) signifi-
cant at uncorrected P < 0.05 and (b) within 10 mm of the group
maxima. Five subjects did not have activation within these selected
criteria and were excluded from the connectivity analyses. For the
remaining (n 5 29) subjects, a spherical VOI (radius 8 mm) was
defined around each local maxima. The mean coordinates of the
center of the VOI was x 5 50.8 6 2.8 mm, y 5 27.9 6 6.2 mm, and
z 5 28.6 6 4.6 mm (mean 6 SD).
The first eigenvariate of fMRI signal was extracted from within this
ROI, temporally filtered, and corrected for non-neuronal components
of the design (such as session-specific mean and estimated motion
parameters). This time series was deconvolved by the canonical
HRF, to estimate the time series for the neural activity, which
served as the physiological vector for further analysis. The psycho-
logical vector was obtained by encoding the onset of the StopSuc-
cess trials by delta functions. The physiological and psychological
vectors were multiplied to obtain the corresponding PPI vector. Sim-
ilar psychological and PPI vectors were also obtained for the
GoSuccess and StopFail conditions. The StopFail condition was
included in the model to improve the model fit. The single-subject
PPI GLM now comprised the PPI vectors (for StopSuccess, GoSuc-
cess and StopFail) and the corresponding psychological vectors and
physiological vector, each of which was convolved by the canonical
HRF before GLM analysis. Similar to the standard single-subject-
level GLM analysis, motion parameters were also included in the
model as nuisance variables. Following the analysis, PPI maps were
generated for each subject.
All PPI maps were entered into group-level analysis for one-sample
t-tests and regressions. As with the activation analysis, images were
assessed at a standard statistical threshold of P < 0.005, corrected
for multiple comparisons at cluster level to a < 0.05 (as imple-
mented in the latest version of 3dFWHMx and 3dClustSim, AFNI).
Mediation analyses
We tested the following mediation models to characterize the rela-
tionship between BMI and impulsivity factors: (i) brain mediator
model posits that inhibitory control neural response mediates the
relationship between trait impulsivity and BMI, (ii) trait mediator
model posits that our trait measure of impulsivity (ImpSS score)
mediates the relationship between inhibitory control neural response
and BMI, and (iii) state mediator model posits that the state measure
of impulsivity (CPT b value) mediates the relationship between
inhibitory control neural response and BMI. For the inhibitory con-
trol neural response variable, we extracted the BOLD response dur-
ing the SST StopSuccess > GoSuccess contrast in the rIFG (30). A

 rIFG anatomical ROI was created using binary masks available in
AAL (31). The averaged b values within this mask were generated
for each participant, which was then used in our analyses.
Mediation analyses were performed using an SPSS macro by
Preacher and Hayes (32) that calculates total, direct, and indirect
effects for each mediator while using both normal theory and boot-
strapping techniques. We report results for both normal theory and
bootstrap tests with resample procedure of 1,000 bootstrap samples.
Effect ratios were computed to express the amount of total effect
that is explained by the indirect mediator effect.
Results
Of the 45 participants recruited, 10 were excluded from further anal-
yses due to technical problems and excessive motion (i.e., >3
degrees rotation or >3 mm translation in any direction). One addi-
tional subject was excluded due to BMI >2.5 kg/m2 SD of group
mean (BMI 5 51.5 kg/m2). Thus, analyses were conducted on the
remaining 34 with an average BMI of 30.7 6 6.3 kg/m2.
Trait impulsivity
There was a significant positive correlation between BMI and
ImpSS total score (r 5 0.44 at two-tailed P 5 0.01).
State impulsivity
The group’s mean CPT b value was 0.84 6 0.97 and mean d’ was
1.1 6 1.2. The CPT b value showed a significant positive correlation
with BMI (r 5 0.595 at two-tailed P 5 0.01). The d’ value was not
significantly correlated to BMI (P > 0.1).
Neural mechanisms of impulsivity
Q-Q plots showed that all assumptions for all parametric tests were
met.
BOLD activation during inhibitory control.
The one-sample t-
test revealed significant activation difference during the StopSuc-
cess > GoSuccess (Table 2). The most significant activation was in
the
parietal
lobe
(total
cluster
size
k 5 56,250
voxels,
peak
t 5 10.81) with peaks in the right supramarginal and left superior
temporal lobe gyrus (FWE P < 0.05). Activations were observed
that encompassed the rIFG (peak voxel (52, 28, 30) with T value
8.28). For the opposite contrast, significant BOLD activations were
observed in two clusters of activations including the right medial
frontal gyrus (k 5 1,744 voxels, peak t 5 7.58) and temporal lobe
(FWE P < 0.05).
SST behavioral performance.
The group’s percentage of Stop-
Success trials was 67.3 6 13.5, while the GoSuccess trials was
96.3 6 5.4. The average GoRT was 529.9 6 100.1 ms, StopFail RT
was 308.9 6 80.6 ms, and SSRT was 199.9 6 49.0 ms. There was no
significant slowing in GoRT following StopFail trials compared
with GoRT following GoSuccess trials (two-tailed P > 0.2), indicat-
ing that the participants did not make any reactive adjustment strat-
egy or show learning effects during task performance. SSRT was
not significantly correlated with BMI (P > 0.5).
Brain-behavior correlations.
The correlation analyses between
neural activation during response inhibition and BMI revealed that
activation in the right superior temporal gyrus and insular cortices
(Table 3, Figure 1b) were negatively correlated with BMI during
StopSuccess > GoSuccess (FWE P < 0.05).
Since the behavioral analyses indicated that BMI and ImpSS total
score were significantly correlated, we examined how each variable
modulated this effect. When we controlled for ImpSS, no regions of
significant correlations emerged. On the other hand, when we con-
trolled for BMI, the ImpSS score remained negatively correlated
with BOLD response within right inferior frontal, middle frontal,
supramarginal, and inferior parietal gyrus (Table 3, Figure 1d; FWE
P < 0.05).
Functional connectivity.
The one-sample t-test revealed signifi-
cant positive connectivity between the rIFG seed region and the left
posterior cingulate cortex (peak at (28, 248, 18), t 5 5.06, k 5 722
voxels) along with right precuneus (secondary peak at (6, 248, 16),
t 5 3.79)
during
response
inhibition
(StopSuccess > GoSuccess)
(FWE P < 0.05) (Figure 2). There were no significant correlations
between functional connectivity maps and BMI at our a priori
selected threshold.

 Mediation models
We performed a stepwise regression for the b values (DV) against
potential mediator variables to determine a minimal set of signifi-
cant mediators to include in further analysis. BMI was correlated
with rIFG b values (b 5 20.031, P 5 0.037), so mediation analysis
was performed on BMI-BOLD data. There was a significant media-
tion effect of BMI on rIFG BOLD b values through total ImpSS
score with b 5 20.024, 95% CI (20.045 to 20.005) (Figure 3).
There was no significant mediation effect of rIFG BOLD b values
on total ImpSS score and BMI. Finally, CPT b (b 50.2564, P > 0.5)
was not significantly correlated with rIFG BOLD b values, so,
mediation analyses were not performed with CPT b.
Post hoc analyses
We examined how related demographic and behavioral factors may
modulate neural activation during response inhibition in high BMI
individuals. We found that age, sex, CPT d’, and b did not correlate
with regional neural response during response inhibition.
We also conducted a correlation analysis between functional connec-
tivity maps and total ImpSS scores. No significant correlations were
found.
Discussion
The link between impulsivity and elevated weight has been equivo-
cal. To address this, we conducted a multivariate study to elucidate
the role of impulsivity in body weight. We found associations
between BMI, and state and trait impulsivity as well as brain
regional activation during response inhibition. We further found that
trait impulsivity mediates the relationship between BMI and neural
response during inhibitory control. These findings support the litera-
ture demonstrating dissociable impulsivity factors, including person-
ality, cognitive, and neural measures of impulsivity that are associ-
ated with overweight and obesity (33).
Our findings of associations between trait impulsivity and BMI are
concordant with previous behavioral studies in adults (34) and chil-
dren (35) with high BMI suggesting that impulsive personality trait
is a risk factor for problems with weight. It has been proposed that
those who have impulsive personality may be more likely to expose
themselves to an obesogenic environment that fosters weight gain
(36). Although the ImpSS does not have a clinical cutoff that could
be used as a marker of risk, a total score of 8.8 in our sample is
greater than what we previously found in a healthy weight sample
(6.00), but lower than nicotine smokers (9.35) (37). We also found
associations between state measures and BMI that showed decreased
response tendency during an attention task. Higher b values during

 the CPT indicate a slower response style that could reflect more
cautious decision-making. On the other hand, because reports have
shown that individuals with obesity and binge-eating disorder tend
to have impaired focused attention, it is also possible that slower
responses during the CPT may reflect decreased vigilant attention or
arousal
(37).
Nevertheless,
impulsivity
has
been
attributed
to
interactions between cautiousness and arousal suggesting that impul-
sive behavior may be due to deficiencies in allocating attention (38).
We also found that BMI was related to decreased BOLD response dur-
ing inhibitory control in temporal and insular lobes. Attenuated neural
response in individuals with obesity is in line with existing neuroi-
maging studies in both adolescent and adult populations (7). The tem-
poral and insular lobes underlie attentional and salience processing
during tasks of response inhibition (8) as well as a more general role
during inhibitory control (39). Interestingly, there was no association
between BMI and behavioral performance on the SST. This absence
of behavioral deficits in the presence of altered neural function has
been noted by others (7) and may reflect the limited sensitivity of
behavioral tasks to detect BMI effects on inhibitory control (40). In
addition to decreased brain regional activation, we found significant
functional connectivity between a key region in the control network
(i.e., right IFG) and the precuneus during successful response inhibi-
tion. Greater connectivity between the rIFG and the precuneus sug-
gests that integrated inhibitory control (rIFG) and self-monitoring
(precuneus) processes underlie successful inhibitory control.

correlations

that
neural
activity
during
response inhibition was positively modulated by both ImpSS and
BMI.
Interestingly,
however,
the
relationship
between
neural
response to cues and BMI became nonsignificant when controlling
for ImpSS illustrating that the effects of BMI on brain response dur-
ing inhibitory control is in part due to impulsive personality. This
suggests that people who have a more impulsive personality are
more likely to show a characteristic pattern of brain response during
inhibitory control that is unrelated to body weight. This finding was
further supported by our mediation analyses that supported a trait
Figure 2 (a) During response inhibition, stronger functional connectivity was observed between right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
seed region and left posterior cingulate cortex (peak at 28, 248, 18). Slice overlay (z 5 18) of this cluster is shown at FWE-
corrected P < 0.05 (n 5 29). (b) Scatterplot showing the relationship between activation in the seed region (x-axis) and activated
voxels within the above region of interest (y-axis) for a representative subject. Stronger correlations are observed between BOLD
responses in these regions for StopSuccess (n 5 73, r 5 0.806, P < 1028, blue triangles) than in the GoSuccess (n 5283,
r 5 0.693, P < 1028, red circles) trials. BOLD signal has been mean corrected and normalized.
Figure 3 The trait mediator model examined the relationship between BMI (IV),
impulsivity (mediator), and the averaged b value (DV) within the right inferior frontal
gyrus region of interest (rIFG ROI) and tested the mediating role of impulsive sensa-
tion-seeking scale (ImpSS) total score. The total effect of BMI on observed b value
is indicated along with the direct effect (excluding the effect of mediator). The medi-
ation effect addressed the question whether impulsivity mediates this relationship,
that is, whether impulsivity explains a significant portion of the correlation between
BMI and rIFG b values.

 mediator model. Specifically, we found that total ImpSS score medi-
ates the relationship between BMI and neural response during
response inhibition. This suggests that the process by which elevated
BMI is correlated with rIFG hypoactivation is through an impulsive
trait personality.
Conclusion
Although trait impulsivity is a stable characteristic that may be pre-
morbid to elevated weight, we can only speculate on the directional-
ity of these effects given the cross-sectional nature of this study.
Future studies should incorporate a longitudinal design to address
the directionality of these effects. Additionally, given the multidi-
mensionality of impulsivity, future studies should consider using
cognitive tasks that include both control and reward-driven mecha-
nisms for better detection of the effects of state impulsivity.
To conclude, this multimodal examination of impulsivity provides con-
verging evidence that impulsivity factors play important roles in ele-
vated weight. We suggest that trait impulsivity (1) may be an anteced-
ent to and (2) may mediate elevated weight and neural alterations in
the PFC control network. Weight management programs that address
this factor may be effective in individuals with elevated weight.O
