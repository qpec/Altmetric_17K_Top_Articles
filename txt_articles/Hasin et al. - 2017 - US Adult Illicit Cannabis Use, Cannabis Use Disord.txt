IMPORTANCE Over the last 25 years, illicit cannabis use and cannabis use disorders have
increased among US adults, and 28 states have passed medical marijuana laws (MML). Little
is known about MML and adult illicit cannabis use or cannabis use disorders considered over
time.
OBJECTIVE To present national data on state MML and degree of change in the prevalence of
cannabis use and disorders.
DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND SETTING Differences in the degree of change between those
living in MML states and other states were examined using 3 cross-sectional US adult surveys:
the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES; 1991-1992), the National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; 2001-2002), and the
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions–III (NESARC-III;
2012-2013). Early-MML states passed MML between NLAES and NESARC (“
earlier period”).
Late-MML states passed MML between NESARC and NESARC-III (“later period”).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Past-year illicit cannabis use and DSM-IV cannabis use
disorder.
RESULTS Overall, from 1991-1992 to 2012-2013, illicit cannabis use increased significantly
more in states that passed MML than in other states (1.4–percentage point more; SE, 0.5;
P = .004), as did cannabis use disorders (0.7–percentage point more; SE, 0.3; P = .03). In the
earlier period, illicit cannabis use and disorders decreased similarly in non-MML states and in
California (where prevalence was much higher to start with). In contrast, in remaining
early-MML states, the prevalence of use and disorders increased. Remaining early-MML and
non-MML states differed significantly for use (by 2.5 percentage points; SE, 0.9; P = .004)
and disorder (1.1 percentage points; SE, 0.5; P = .02). In the later period, illicit use increased
by the following percentage points: never-MML states, 3.5 (SE, 0.5); California, 5.3 (SE, 1.0);
Colorado, 7.0 (SE, 1.6); other early-MML states, 2.6 (SE, 0.9); and late-MML states, 5.1 (SE,
0.8). Compared with never-MML states, increases in use were significantly greater in
late-MML states (1.6–percentage point more; SE, 0.6; P = .01), California (1.8–percentage
point more; SE, 0.9; P = .04), and Colorado (3.5–percentage point more; SE, 1.5; P = .03).
Increases in cannabis use disorder, which was less prevalent, were smaller but followed
similar patterns descriptively, with change greater than never-MML states in California
(1.0–percentage point more; SE, 0.5; P = .06) and Colorado (1.6–percentage point more; SE,
0.8; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medical marijuana laws appear to have contributed to
increased prevalence of illicit cannabis use and cannabis use disorders. State-specific policy
changes may also have played a role. While medical marijuana may help some,
cannabis-related health consequences associated with changes in state marijuana laws
should receive consideration by health care professionals and the public.

O
ver the last 20 years, laws and attitudes regarding can-
nabis have changed. As of November 2016, 28 states
have passed medical marijuana laws (MML). Many
adults now favor legalizing recreational use,1 and fewer view
cannabis as risky.2 Despite this view, while some can use can-
nabis without harm,3,4 potential consequences include im-
paired functioning,3-7 vehicle crashes,8-11 emergency depart-
ment visits,12 psychiatric symptoms,13-16 and addiction.3,17-19
Over time, the prevalence of adult illicit use and related conse-
quences has increased.10,12,17,19-26 Thus, identifying factors
underlying increased adult illicit use is important. State MML
may be one such factor.18
Little is known about MML and adult cannabis out-
comes. Two national studies17,27 showed greater use and
DSM-IV–diagnosed disorders in MML states but did not
examine differences before and after MML. One national
study28 did so, finding increased post-MML cannabis use and
cannabis disorders. However, this study only addressed 2004
to 2012, adults 20 years and older, and 10 states that changed
MML status.28 To our knowledge, no study of differences be-
fore and after MML has used adult national data predating all
MML, differentiated between earlier and more recent peri-
ods, or separately examined particular states. Differences be-
tween states that passed MML early vs late are important be-
cause the national normative context differed for early-MML
states, when few such laws existed, and late-MML states, en-
acted when more states had MML. Also, earlier data can show
if trends in cannabis use and disorder in late-passing states be-
gan prior to their MML. Further, California and Colorado war-
rant separate, secondary examination. In 1996, when Califor-
nia passed the first MML, its cannabis rates were higher than
other states,29 and thus its MML may have had little addi-
tional effect. Colorado (MML passed in 2000) experienced
unique policy changes in 2009-2010 (eAppendix 1 in the
Supplement) followed by increases in medical user applica-
tions from 500 per month to greater than 10 000 per month
and from no known dispensaries to greater than 900,30-34 po-
tentiallyexertingadditionalimpactoncannabisoutcomesdur-
ing the later period.35
We examined MML, illicit cannabis use, and cannabis use
disorders in 3 cross-sectional adult surveys: the 1991-1992 Na-
tionalLongitudinalAlcoholEpidemiologicSurvey(NLAES),36,37
the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
Related Conditions (NESARC),38-40 and the 2012-2013 Na-
tional Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi-
tions–III (NESARC-III).41,42 Over this period, the national con-
text for MML changed. In 1991-1992, no Americans lived in
MML states; in 2001, 18.9% lived in MML states,43 and in 2012,
more than one-third (34.3%) lived in MML states.44 We there-
fore addressed 3 questions. First, between 1991-1992 and
2012-2013(theoverallstudyperiod),werechangesinthepreva-
lence of illicit cannabis use and disorders greater in states that
ever had MML vs never had MML? Second, between 1991-
1992 and 2001-2002 (for convenience, termed the earlier
period), did changes in prevalence differ between states that
did and did not pass MML during this time, including and ex-
cluding California? Third, between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013
(for convenience, termed the later period), did changes in
prevalence differ between never-MML states, states passing
MML during the earlier period, and states passing MML dur-
ing the later period? In investigating the later period, we again
kept California separate and also separated Colorado, given its
2009-2010 changes.30-34
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The NLAES,36,37 NESARC,38-40 and NESARC-III41,42 surveyed
adults 18 years and older in households and group quarters,
using similar multistage sampling designs.20,36,39-42,45 Sample
weights were adjusted for selection probabilities and nonre-
sponse. Field procedures were similar across surveys, except
that the NLAES used paper-and-pencil interviews whereas the
NESARC and NESARC-III used computer-assisted interviews.
Becausetrainedinterviewersusedsimilarproceduresinallsur-
veys, respondents were similarly exposed to interview ques-
tions, permitting examination of trends over time.20,42,45-47
Quality assurance included training, supervision, and
callbacks to verify respondent data.36,39-42 The NLAES and
NESARC protocols and consent procedures were approved by
the institutional review boards at the US Bureau of the Cen-
sus and the Office of Management and Budget; written con-
sent was provided. The NESARC-III protocols and consent pro-
cedures were approved by institutional review boards at the
National Institutes of Health and Westat; consent was verbal
but recorded electronically, as approved by both institutional
review boards. Overall response rates were 60% to 84%.36,39-42
Eleven states in which primary sampling units were not ran-
domly selected in NESARC-III were excluded from analyses
(Table 1), yielding 41 764 participants from the NLAES, 41 184
from the NESARC, and 35 549 from the NESARC-III, totaling
118 497 participants. Sample demographic characteristics are
shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Measures
The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Inter-
view Schedule (AUDADIS), a structured diagnostic interview,
was used to assess substance use and DSM-IV substance use
Key Points
Question Are US state medical marijuana laws one of the
underlying factors for increases in risk for adult cannabis use and
cannabis use disorders seen since the early 1990s?
Findings In this analysis using US national survey data collected in
1991-1992, 2001-2002, and 2012-2013 from 118 497 participants,
the risk for cannabis use and cannabis use disorders increased at a
significantly greater rate in states that passed medical marijuana
laws than in states that did not.
Meaning Possible adverse consequences of illicit cannabis use
due to more permissive state cannabis laws should receive
consideration by voters, legislators, and policy and health care
professionals, with appropriate health care planning as such laws
change.

disorders. All 3 surveys included the same questions about il-
licit use in the prior 12 months, including cannabis. Illicit use
was defined to participants as use without a prescription or
other than prescribed, eg, to get high (eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement). In the NLAES, information about cannabis was
assessed only if participants used 12 or more times. For con-
sistency with the NLAES, we analyzed cannabis use and dis-
orders among NESARC and NESARC-III participants who used
cannabis 12 or more times. Any illicit cannabis use in the past
12 months was analyzed, providing a consistent timeframe for
use and disorders.
Participants with DSM-IV cannabis abuse or dependence
in the past 12 months were coded positive for cannabis use dis-
order (abuse and dependence combined because their crite-
ria reflect a single disorder48). All AUDADIS versions included
the same core questions covering cannabis disorder criteria.
A minor difference between the NLAES and NESARC was that
in the NLAES, criteria were assessed with 2 questions—1 on oc-
currence and 1 on recurrence—while in the NESARC and
NESARC-III, single questions were used.20,45 Also, the NLAES
but not the NESARC included 4 items assessing the “social im-
pairment” and “use despite health problems” dependence cri-
teria. Comparisons between DSM-IV cannabis diagnoses in the
NLAESwithandwithoutthese4questionsyieldednearlyiden-
tical prevalence (1.12% vs 1.06%, respectively) and near-
perfect concordance (κ, 0.98), so these differences had little
impact on results.
The NESARC and NESARC-III AUDADIS versions also had
only minor differences. Four items were slightly reworded, 1
item was in the NESARC but not NESARC-III, and 1 item was
in the NESARC-III but not NESARC. DSM-IV cannabis disor-
der diagnoses with and without these NESARC and NESARC-
III items had near-identical prevalence and near-perfect
concordance.20 Thus, these minor differences could not ac-
count for the substantial prevalence increases observed be-
tween surveys. Test-retest reliability and convergent validity
of AUDADIS DSM-IV cannabis disorder diagnoses is docu-
mented extensively.36,49-57
State-Level MML Variables
A team of legal scholars, policy analysts, and economists re-
viewed state policies to determine the year of MML
passage.58,59 Three variables were then created (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).OneindicatedparticipantsinstatespassingMML
between 1991 and 2012 (ever-MML states) vs others (never-
MML states), 1 indicated participants in early-MML states vs
non-early–MML states (ie, never-MML and late-MML states),
and 1 indicated participants in early-MML states, late-MML
states, and never-MML states. Early-MML states passed MML
between 1991 and 2001 (in the earlier period). Late-MML states
passed MML between 2002 and 2012 (in the later period).
Never-MML states had no MML by 2012. Additional variables
for secondary analyses represented California and Colorado
separately.
Individual-Level and State-Level Control Covariates
Covariates included sex, age, education (less than high school
vs others), race/ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and other; self-defined using US Census Bu-
reau categories), marital status (unmarried vs others), urban-
icity(metropolitanstatisticalareasvsothers),andpoverty(less
than 100%, 100% to 200%, and greater than 200% of the fed-
eral poverty level60). Following prior MML work,27,59,61,62 US
Census data were used to define 4 state-level covariates: per-
cent male, percent white, percent younger than 30 years, and
percent 25 years and older without a high school diploma.
Statistical Analyses
We examined whether the degree of change between surveys
differed in participants by state MML status using difference-
in-difference (DiD) tests.63,64 By assuming that trends in non-
MML states reflect what would have happened in MML states
if they had not passed MML, DiD tests provide information
about changes due to MML passage, with inferences strength-
ened if trends in MML and non-MML states did not differ

before MML passage (ie, previous parallel paths65). Difference-
in-difference tests advantageously “difference out” fixed un-
measured factors and control for preexisting between-group
differences66 that might bias results. By standardizing groups
across time to the overall weighted distribution of model co-
variates, use of predicted marginal prevalences in the DiD ap-
proach additionally eliminates varying measured covariates as
explanations of results.
The3surveydatasetswereconcatenated,addingavariable

Separate models tested MML effects during the overall pe-
riod (model 1), the earlier period (model 2), and the later pe-
riod (model 3). In model 1 (1991-1992 vs 2012-2013), we evalu-
ated MML effects by testing for differential changes between
ever-MML states and never-MML states. In model 2 (1991-
1992 vs 2001-2002), we evaluated early-MML effects by test-
ing for differential changes in early-MML states vs remaining
states (ie, late-MML and non-MML states), initially grouping
California with other early-MML states (model 2A) and then
examining California separately (model 2B). In model 3 (2001-
2002 vs 2012-2013), we tested for differential changes be-
tweennever-MMLstates(reference)andlate-MMLstates,Cali-
fornia, Colorado, and the other early-MML states.
We tested the parallel-path assumption65 of DiD estima-
tors for late-MML states and Colorado by comparing their
trends with non-MML states during the earlier period. Sensi-
tivity analyses testing robustness of findings included (1) add-
ing originally excluded NESARC and NESARC-III participants
who only used cannabis 1 to 11 times to models 1, 2, and 3; (2)
adding participants from all states included in each survey to
models 1, 2, and 3; (3) recoding cannabis disorder to include
withdrawal as a seventh criterion48; and (4) omitting partici-
pants aged 18 and 19 years for consistency with earlier
research.28 All analyses used SUDAAN version 11.0.1 (RTI
International)67 and included survey weights and stratifica-
tion variables to account for the complex survey design. Re-
sults were inspected for meaningful change from models 1, 2,
and 3 if DiD tests gained or lost significance. All P values were
2-tailed, and significance was set at P < .05.
Results
Descriptive Predicted Prevalences
of Illicit Cannabis Use and Disorder
Between 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, illicit use decreased and
disorderchangedlittle.Between2001-2002and2012-2013,use
and disorder increased. eTable 3 in the Supplement presents
predicted prevalences of use and disorder in the 39 states ana-
lyzed, by survey and MML status.
Change in Illicit Cannabis Use and Cannabis Use Disorder by
State MML Status: 1991-1992 to 2012-2013 (Model 1)
Between 1991-1992 and 2012-2013, the predicted prevalence
of illicit use increased by 3.6 and 2.2 percentage points in ever-
MML and never-MML states, respectively (Table 1) (Figure 1A),
a significantly greater increase in ever-MML than never-MML
states (P = .004). The predicted prevalence of cannabis disor-
der also increased (1.6 and 1.0 percentage points) in ever-
MML and never-MML states (Figure 2A), also a significantly
greater change in the ever-MML states (P = .03).
Change During the Earlier Period: 1991-1992 to 2001-2002
(Models 2A and 2B)
From 1991-1992 to 2001-2002, when grouping California with
other early-MML states in model 2A, the predicted preva-
lence of illicit use did not change significantly in early-MML
states and decreased by 1.7 percentage points in non-early–
MML states, which was not a significant difference. For can-
nabis disorders, change in all early-MML and non-early–MML
states also did not differ significantly (model 2A) (Table 2).
Separating California from the other early states pro-
duced very different results in model 2B (Table 2) (Figure 1B
and Figure 2B). Note that in 1991-1992, predicted prevalences
of use and disorder were higher in California than other early-
MML states (use: 7.59% vs 4.49%; P = .001; disorder: 2.08%
vs 1.15%; P = .02). Nevertheless, for use, decreases in Califor-
nia and non-early–MML states (−2.0 vs −1.7 percentage points)
did not differ significantly, nor did the slight decreases in can-
nabis disorder.
In contrast, in the other 5 early-MML states, prevalences
of use and disorder increased. The change in remaining early-
MML states differed from non-MML states for use (by 2.5 per-
centage points; P = .004) and disorder (1.1 percentage points;
P = .02).
Change During the Later Period:
2001-2002 to 2012-2013 (Model 3)
From 2001-2002 to 2012-2013, predicted prevalences of il-
licit cannabis use and cannabis disorder increased by the fol-
lowing percentage points: never-MML states, 3.5 and 1.0, re-
spectively; California, 5.3 and 2.0; Colorado, 7.0 and 2.7; other
early-MML states, 2.6 and 0.1; and late-MML states, 5.1 and 1.7.
Compared with change in never-MML states, increases in use
were significantly greater in late-MML states (P = .01), Cali-
fornia (P = .04), and Colorado (P = .03) (Table 3) (Figure 1C).
Comparing increases in prevalence of cannabis disorder with
never-MML states (the reference group), change in late-MML
states was not significant (P = .12) but was greater at a trend
level in California (P = .06) and significantly greater in Colo-
rado (P = .04) (Table 3) (Figure 2C).

MML states and late-MML states (eTable 4 in the Supplement)
as well as non-MML states and Colorado (eTable 4 and eFig-
ures 1 and 2 in the Supplement). Sensitivity analyses (eTable 5
in the Supplement) did not change results meaningfully, indi-
cating robust main findings.
Discussion
In 3 cross-sectional national surveys spanning 20 years, we in-
vestigated whether increases in US adult illicit cannabis use
and cannabis use disorders followed implementation of MML.
Over the entire period, predicted prevalences of illicit use and
disorders increased to a greater degree in states that passed
MML than in other states. Holding population size and demo-
graphic distributions constant from 1991 to 2012, an addi-
tional 1.1 million adult illicit cannabis users and an additional
500 000 adults with a DSM-IV–diagnosed cannabis disorder
may be attributable to medical marijuana law passage. Given
the potential consequences of use and persistent disability
associated with cannabis use disorders,3,68 this represents a
serious public health problem.
During the earlier period (1991-1992 to 2001-2002), preva-
lences in the 5 early-MML states (excluding California) in-
creased in contrast to decreases in non-MML states and Cali-
fornia. In 1991-1992, the sharply higher rates of cannabis use
anddisorderinCaliforniathaninotherstates(use,69%higher;
disorder, 80% higher) suggest that California, a bellwether
state, differed from other states from the start, consistent with
1995 findings of higher cannabis use in California communi-
ties than elsewhere.29 Therefore, an already permissive envi-
ronment in California may have overridden further MML ef-
fects. However, in other early-MML states, MML contributed
to increased illicit use and disorder, contrary to a nationally
decreasing trend.
Duringthelaterperiod(2001-2002to2012-2013),illicituse
increased significantly more in late-MML states than in never-
MML states. (The lack of significant differences in early-MML
states could be due to absence of strong lagged effects, waning
MMLeffectsovertime,orlocalfactors.)OurinferencethatMML
contributedtoincreasedillicituseinlate-MMLstatesisstrength-
ened by the lack of such differences in late-MML states during
theearlierperiod(eTable4intheSupplement).Further,greater
increasesincannabisuseanddisorderinColoradothaninnever-
MML states suggests that well-documented 2009-2010 policy
changesanddispensaryproliferation(eAppendix1intheSupple-
ment) contributed to increases in use and disorder, particu-
larly because similar increases did not occur there during the
earlier period (eTable 4 and eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supple-
ment). Substantial increases also occurred in California during

thelaterperiod,consistentwithqualitativeobservationsofmari-
juana dispensary proliferation,69 although centralized Califor-
nia dispensary documentation is lacking. Additional research
is needed on late MML and cannabis use disorder and how ma-
jor policy changes and their implementation58,70 relate to pub-
lic health consequences in MML states.
Increases in cannabis use associated with MML may have
resulted from increasing availability, potency,71 perceived
safety/acceptability,61 generally permissive attitudes (be-
cause other substance use and disorders also increased42,72,73),
greater use for coping with depression and anxiety (A.L.S.,
M.M.W., K.M.K., M.C., D.S.H.; unpublished data; 2017), or di-
minished economic opportunities.21 Future studies should in-
vestigate such mechanisms.
The previous study of pre-post MML changes in adults28
also found post-MML increases in cannabis use and disorder,
supporting our results. However, while this study had an
important advantage in that consecutive years of survey
data were analyzed, only 8 years were included, changes in
only 10 MML states were examined, early-MML vs late-MML
effects were not addressed, and the survey did not differen-
tiate between medical and illicit users, so medical use may
have been included in its estimates.28 Finally, the diagnostic
measure used in that study may have low sensitivity74 and
validity.75 Thus, our examination of MML effects on adult
illicit (ie, nonmedical) cannabis use contributes important
new information.
To our knowledge, studies using DiD methods have not
shownpost-MMLincreasesinadolescentcannabisuse.28,59,76-78
The reasons MML differentially affect adolescents and adults
merit investigation.
Since 2012, 8 states have legalized recreational cannabis
use.Researchisneededontheeffectsoftheselaws,whichmay

Limitations and Strengths
Study limitations are noted. Measures were self-reported. Di-

issues.79,80 However, numerous other cannabis-related con-
sequences also increased over this period,10,17,19,22,24,25 sup-
porting the validity of NESARC to NESARC-III comparisons.75
In any case, there is no reason to expect that such method-
ological issues would have influenced potential differences be-
tween medical marijuana states and other locations. Also, the
early and later periods were defined by dates of the surveys.
Exploring other definitions of early and later in suitable data
could contribute useful information, eg, before and after ma-
jor policy changes. The treatment of California and Colorado
is termed as secondary. While these results contribute impor-
tant information, further research is needed on these states
relative to the national context if suitable data can be found.
Ideally, all 3 surveys would have included all 50 states. How-
ever,approximatelyequalproportionsofever-MMLandnever-
MML states were excluded, and analyses suggested that omit-
ted states would not have changed the results. Additionally,
we used data sets from only 3 periods, precluding formal test-
ing of the prior parallel-path assumption for the early-MML
states. However, 2 smaller surveys conducted in 1984 and
199081 suggest descriptively that early-MML states other than
California did not begin their sharp increase prior to MML pas-
sage (eTable 6 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement; written per-
sonal communication, William Kerr, PhD, February 2017).
Studystrengthsincludethatresultscontributeknowledgefrom
more than 100 000 participants in 39 states across 2 decades.
Topicsforfutureresearchincludewhetherotheroutcomes(eg,
cannabis use frequency and other substance use) were af-
fected by MML and whether individual or state characteris-
tics modify MML effects.
Conclusions
This study suggests that MML contributed to increasing US
adult illicit cannabis use and cannabis disorders. Policy and
clinical professionals should recognize that cannabis disor-
ders can be severe,3,82 treatment needs are increasing, and
treatment can be effective.83-85 Medical marijuana laws may
benefit some with medical problems. However, changing state
laws (medical or recreational) may also have adverse public
health consequences. A prudent interpretation of our results
is that professionals and the public should be educated on risks
of cannabis use and benefits of treatment,3 and prevention/
intervention services for cannabis disorders should be
provided.20
