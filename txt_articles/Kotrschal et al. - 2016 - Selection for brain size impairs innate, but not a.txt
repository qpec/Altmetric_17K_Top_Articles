Both the brain and the immune system are energetically demanding organs,
and when natural selection favours increased investment into one, then the
size or performance of the other should be reduced. While comparative ana-
lyses have attempted to test this potential evolutionary trade-off, the results
remain inconclusive. To test this hypothesis, we compared the tissue graft
rejection (an assay for measuring innate and acquired immune responses) in
guppies (Poecilia reticulata) artificially selected for large and small relative
brain size. Individual scales were transplanted between pairs of fish, creating
reciprocal allografts, and the rejection reaction was scored over 8 days (before
acquired immunity develops). Acquired immune responses were tested two
weeks later, when the same pairs of fish received a second set of allografts
and were scored again. Compared with large-brained animals, small-brained
animals of both sexes mounted a significantly stronger rejection response to
the first allograft. The rejection response to the second set of allografts did
not differ between large- and small-brained fish. Our results show that selec-
tion for large brain size reduced innate immune responses to an allograft,
which supports the hypothesis that there is a selective trade-off between
investing into brain size and innate immunity.
1. Introduction
Organisms do not have unlimited resources and therefore when natural selection
favours increased investment into one trait, there are fewer resources to invest into
other traits [1]. This limitation is the basis for life-history trade-offs, and can poten-
tially restrict or bias evolutionary pathways [2–5]. Brain size varies dramatically
among species (over four orders of magnitude among vertebrates) [6], and the
focus of much research is to explain the evolution of brain size and the selective
trade-offs of large brains (e.g. [7–11]). There is evidence for selective benefits of
larger brains [12], which are likely to arise from improved cognitive abilities
[11,13–15], but then why does brain size vary so much? Why do not all animals
have large brains? It has long been assumed that large brain size imposes selective
trade-offs with other traits. Identifying these selective trade-offs is vital for
understanding brain evolution.
Uncovering functional trade-offs is difficult, and negative statistical corre-
lations between traits are generally used as indicators of such trade-offs [2].
Several traits show negative associations with brain size on the interspecific
level, such as gut size in primates [16], birds [17] and cichlid fishes [18], fat storage
in mammals [19] and a pipefish [20], and testes mass in bats [21]. For the evolution
of vertebrate brain size, those negative associations are usually interpreted to sup-
port the hypothesis that investment into one ‘expensive’ tissue is traded off against
investment into other energetically costly traits [16]. But the precise mechanisms
underlying trade-offs between brain size and other traits are still unclear. For
example, the negative association between brain and fat tissue in mammals may
arise due to biochemical constraints of mammalian energy generation rather
than a direct energetic trade-off where an increased investment into brain tissue
may lead to decreased fat deposition [22]. Also, a negative association between

 brain and testis mass is not apparent in all mammals [23].
Further, since comparative analyses are correlational, the
hypothesis that brain size has selective trade-offs with other
traits requires experimental testing. Artificial selection over
multiple generations provides one of the best approaches for
evaluating functional trade-offs between the trait that has
been selected and other trait(s) [24,25]. For example, a recent
series of experiments with guppies (Poecilia reticulata) artificially
selected for large and small brains confirmed a trade-off
between brain size and gut size, as large-brained animals also
evolved smaller guts [11]. Our aim here was to use fish from
these selection lines to test whether selection for increased
brain size similarly reduced the function of the immune system.
Increasing brain size may have negative trade-offs on the
immune system for at least two reasons [26]. First, like
the brain, the immune system is metabolically demanding
[27–29] and requires a large expenditure of an individual’s
acquired resource pool [30]. Therefore, these organs may
compete for energy, nutrients or other limited resources. For
example, mice artificially selected for maximal metabolic rate
have suppressed innate (though not adaptive) immune
function [31]. Second, the brain and the immune system
share many signalling molecules and pathways, such as steroid
hormones, cytokines, chemokines and major histocompati-
bility gene expression [32]. However, few studies have
investigated selective trade-offs between the brain and the
immune system. Support for such a trade-off comes from a
study of 108 avian families in which behavioural innovative
capabilities (used as proxy for brain size [33]) and the richness
of parasitic lice (as proxy for immune capability [34]) were
positively correlated [35]. A similar pattern was found in
seven species of bats, where parasite species richness correlated
positively with brain size [36]. By contrast, parasite species
richness (a debatable proxy for immune function) and brain
size were unrelated in rodent species [26], while in another
study the size of immune defence organs of various birds
was positively associated with brain size [37].
Our aim was to compare the immune function of guppies
that have been selectively bred for large and small brain size
[11] to better elucidate the possible trade-offs between brain
size and the immune system. We tested for the effects of
brain-size selection on the allograft rejection response in
male and female guppies selected for large and small
brains. We predicted that large-brained fish would show
reduced immune responses (tissue rejection) compared with
small-brained fish, though it is impossible to predict which
aspects of immune function should be affected by differences
in brain size. We did not predict sex differences in graft rejec-
tion (based on a previous study that found no sex differences
in guppies [38]), but there is almost nothing known about this
issue in fish. In mammals, sex-specific differences in immune
function are commonly found [39], and though females gen-
erally have more robust immune responses than males
(females are generally more resistant to parasites but suffer
from more autoimmune disease [40]), such findings cannot
be extrapolated to all species or other taxa.
2. Material and methods
(a) Directional selection on brain weight
We examined the relationship between brain size and immunologi-
cal response to scale allografts in laboratory lines of Trinidadian
guppies that were artificially selected for large or small relative
brain size [11,41]. Briefly, these selection lines were generated
using a standard bidirectional artificial selection design that con-
sisted of two replicated treatments (three up-selected lines and
three down-selected lines). Since brain size can only be quantified
after dissection, we allowed pairs to breed at least two clutches
first, then sacrificed the parents for brain quantification and used
the offspring from parents with large or small relative brain size
as parents for the next generation. More specifically, to select for
relative brain size (controlled for body size), we selected on the
residuals from the regression of brain size (weight) on body size
(length) of both parents. We started with three times 75 pairs (75
pairs per replicate) to create the first three up- and down-selected
lines (six lines in total). We summed up the male and female
residuals for each pair and used offspring from the top and
bottom 25% of these ‘parental residuals’ to form the next-generation
parental groups. We then used the offspring of the 30 pairs with the
largest residual sums for up-selection and the 30 pairs with the
smallest residual sums for down-selection for each following
generation. To avoid inbreeding,
full siblings were never
mated. See Kotrschal et al. [11] for full details about the selection
experiment. The selection lines differed in relative brain size by
9% in the F2 [11] and up to 14% in the F3 generation [42], and
body size did not differ between the lines [11,43]. All fish were
removed from their parental tanks after birth, separated by sex
at the first onset of sexual maturation and then kept in single-
sex groups with a maximum density of five individuals in 3 l
tanks containing 2 cm of gravel with continuously aerated
water. We allowed for visual contact between the tanks. The lab-
oratory was maintained at 268C with a 12 L : 12 D schedule. Fish
were fed a diet of flake food and freshly hatched brine shrimp 6
days per week. All measurements were done blindly since only
running numbers identified tanks. We used 60 fully grown and
mature F3 male and female guppies for our assays, balanced over
the three replicates, the two brain-size selection regimes and
both sexes.
(b) Allograft rejection
There are several methods commonly used to assess immune
function [44], and these techniques measure different aspects of
immunity, such as cellular and humoral immune response (to
non-replicative antigens). Most immunocompetence assays probe
either innate or adaptive immunity, rarely both. Furthermore,
most are of limited use for guppies because these fish are too
small to obtain blood or other tissue samples without inflicting
serious distress on (or even sacrificing) the animal. Scale allografts
are a standard technique in the study of fish immune competence
[45,46], and they overcome the previously described limitations
because they allow the evaluation of both innate and adaptive
immunity and have minimal invasiveness. Moreover, allograft
rejection has been previously used in guppies to show how
immune responses are modulated by dietary carotenoids [38].
To test for innate immunological response, we performed scale
allografts according to methods described by Grether et al. [38].
We placed individual guppies (sedated with MS-222) in reciprocal
pairs on wet gauze next to each other. Every pair consisted of one
fish from the large- and one from the small-brained lines, always of
the same replicate and same sex. This design excludes potential
biases due to genetic relatedness (and matching at major histo-
compatibility loci) that control rejection responses [47]. Under a
stereomicroscope, we then carefully removed a single scale
from the dorsal area of each fish and transferred the scales to the
so-created empty scale pocket of the other fish (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1). Fish were left to recover for
5 min in Petri dishes with fresh water to ensure settlement of the
allografts and then returned to their individual home tanks.

 During the experiment, all fish were kept in individual 10 l tanks
with gravel, java moss and a biological filter.
On days 2, 4, 6 and 8 after the allografting, we observed the
fish under a stereomicroscope for evidence of healing, swelling
and other signs of inflammation, using the criteria described
by Cooper [48] and modified by Grether et al. [38]. Briefly, the
‘rejection response’ variable is a composite variable incorporating
all observable morphological changes for scale allografts in
guppies: level 0, slight swelling only; level 1, swelling or melano-
cytes disrupted; level 2, swelling and melanocytes disrupted;
level 3, swelling, melanocytes disrupted and slight cloudiness;
level 4, swelling, melanocytes disrupted or partially absent,
and cloudiness; 5, swelling, melanocytes absent and strong clou-
diness. To assay rejection due to acquired immune responses, we
used the same pairs and repeated the allografting as described
above 21 days after the first allografting. We used a different
scale: two scale-rows caudal to the first allograft. We again
scored the rejection response on days 2, 4, 6 and 8 after allografting.
Scoring was made ‘blindly’ with regard to the brain-size selec-
tion line and replicate because only running numbers identified
holding tanks.
(c) Sample size
Of the 60 experimental animals, one individual lost the allografted
scale after day 4 during the first round of allografting, and one fish
died before the first allografting. Because one small-brained female
died before the second allografting, her large-brained partner fish
also could not be allografted. Finally, one fish died after day 6 of
the second allografting. Final sample sizes were therefore (first/
second allografting) 58/56 complete datasets, 1/1 incomplete
datasets and 1/3 missing datasets.
(d) Data analyses
To analyse our results of both innate and acquired immune rejec-
tion,
we
first
used
a
general
linear
mixed-effects
model
(GLMM1) with rejection score as dependent variable, brain-size
selection
regime,
sex
and
allograft
set
as
fixed
factors,
individual ID and replicate nested in
brain-size
selection
regime as random factors, and day of experiment and day of
experiment squared (to account for a nonlinear association [38])
as covariates. To investigate the innate and acquired immune
response, we used two separate analogous models (GLMM2
and GLMM3). To further investigate which days the immune
rejection differed between large- and small-brained individuals,
we used eight separate, day-specific GLMMs with immune
response as dependent variable, brain-size selection regime and
sex as fixed factors, and individual ID and replicate nested in
brain-size selection regime as random factors. For all models, we
used a stepwise model reduction, based on the lowest Akaike’s
information criterion, and excluded all non-significant interactions
( p . 0.3 in all cases). Note that the size of the dataset prevented
residual distributions from being perfectly normal; however,
they were always biased towards more central estimates. All
analyses were done in SPSS 22.0.
3. Results
Overall, the first set of allografts, used to assay innate immunity,
elicited a stronger rejection response than the second set of
allografts, used to measure adaptive immunity; small-brained
fish and males tended to show a stronger rejection response
than large-brained fish and females; we further found a signifi-
cant interaction between brain-size selection regime and set of
allograft (GLMM1: allograft set: F1,394 ¼ 127.302, p , 0.001; sex:

The first set of allografts elicited a rejection response with a
maximum on day 4 (figure 1a). In this set, small-brained
animals of both sexes showed an overall stronger rejection
than large-brained animals (GLMM2: sex: F1,55 ¼ 0.912, p ¼

When
analysing
all days separately, we found that on day 4 and day 6 the differ-
ence between large- and small-brained animals was significant
(figure 1a; electronic supplementary material, table S1). In the
second set of allografts, the rejection response showed a near-
linear decrease over time (figure 1b). While brain-size selection
regime did not influence this response (figure 1b), males
mounted a stronger response, and their response declined
more steeply over time compared with females (GLMM3: sex:
F1,177 ¼ 10.759, p ¼ 0.001; brain-size selection regime: F1,4 ¼
0.211, p ¼ 0.670; day of experiment: F1,167 ¼ 9.691, p ¼ 0.002;

p ¼ 0.003;
figure

Visual
inspection of figure 1d indicates that the faster decrease over
time in males compared with females is driven by greater
immune response on days 2 and 4.
4. Discussion
As predicted, we found that small-brained animals mounted
a significantly stronger rejection response to first-set allografts
than did large-brained animals. There was no such effect of
brain size, however, in the second-set allografts. These results
suggest that increased investment into the development of a
larger brain leads to a decrease in investment into the
innate, but not the adaptive immune system. Our findings
therefore support the hypothesis that evolving larger brains
has negative trade-offs for immune function, at least for
innate immunity.
It is somewhat surprising that the negative effects of
increasing brain size on immunity occurred rapidly (within
the first 8 days), and presumably via innate responses, since
allograft rejection is often assumed to be controlled by adaptive
immunity [46,49]. Innate responses to allografts, however, are
more important than is generally assumed [50,51].
There are a variety of mechanisms through which selection
for brain size can potentially influence immune (innate and
adaptive) responses, even directly, since there are several
mechanisms that surprisingly control both neurogenesis and
immunity [52,53]. For example, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are
crucially involved in innate immunity [54], neurogenesis [55]
and neurodegeneration [56]. While the transcriptome of adult
brains of the brain-size-selected guppies does not differ in
TLR expression [57], a detailed investigation of TLRs in several
tissues at different developmental stages is needed to elucidate
whether changes in TLRs indeed govern a decreased innate
immunity when animals evolve larger brains. In addition, the
effects we found might be due to changes in the complement
system [58], or neutrophils, the first responders to antigen
introduction [59,60]. Experiments are therefore planned to
investigate characteristics of TLR expression, complement
system, neutrophils and other lymphocytes in the large- and
small-brained guppies. Comparative analyses are needed to
further investigate the relationship between brain size and
immune competence, such as white blood cell counts, among
different vertebrate species.
Our results might also be due to correlated changes we
found in other traits, besides the brain, such as the gut or
hormonal system. Those are two non-mutually exclusive
explanations
of
potential
indirect
pathways
by
which
trade-offs may occur. First, the gut and its microbiome are
well-established players in mammalian immune function
[61], and recently the role of the gut in the immune defence
of fishes has also been emerging [62]. Thus, the fact that in
our brain-size-selected guppies the large-brained lines show
smaller guts than the small-brained lines [11] may help
explain the decreased rejection in large-brained animals.
However, whether the size of the gut directly relates to
immune competence is currently unknown. Second, we
recently found that selection for brain size alters hormonal
stress responses, such that large-brained fish secrete less cor-
tisol in a stressful situation compared with small-brained fish
[43]. Given that cortisol is immunosuppressive, one would
have expected stronger immune rejection responses in large-
brained fish due to their lower cortisol levels. The fact that we
found the opposite for first-set allografts suggests that the
effect of the trade-off between brain size and immunity may
override the immune-suppressive effects of elevated cortisol
levels. Scale autografts, where scales are transplanted between
different areas of the same individual, usually do not lead to vis-
ible rejection reactions [63]. It is therefore unlikely that bacterial
contamination contributed to the observed immune responses.
Even if so, our conclusion of decreased innate immune
responses in large-brained animals remains unchanged.
So what are the fitness consequences of the negative
association we detected between brain size and immune
rejection? Does impaired immune function constrain the evol-
ution of larger brains? (We use the term ‘constrain’ in the
sense of impeding an evolutionary trajectory, as obviously
such a trade-off has not stopped the evolution of large brains
[2,64,65].) Does increasing brain size confer advantages that
ameliorate the negative consequences of reduced immune
function, such as improved behavioural defences against
infectious
diseases
[66],
which
could
include
avoiding
contaminated foods [67], rejecting contagious sexual partners
[68] and avoiding parasite-infested areas [69]? It is unclear
whether
such
benefits
in
behavioural
strategies
could
compensate for impairments in innate immunity.
In addition to an apparent trade-off between brain size and
immune function, we observed a sex-specific difference in
rejection, as females tended to show less pronounced rejection,
and especially adaptive immunity was stronger in males com-
pared with females. Although the mechanisms underlying a
sex-specific innate immune response remains enigmatic, we
may speculate on the adaptive value of a decreased adaptive
immune response in females. Guppy males use a modified
anal fin as intromittent organ to internally fertilize females,
and females are frequently exposed to forced, often damaging,
copulation attempts [70]. Decreasing the responsiveness of the
adaptive immune system may be advantageous for females
because the constant development of specific antibodies
against each of the large number of males attempting to mate
with a female in its lifetime may simply be too costly. If so,
the level of coercive mating within a population may drive
the responsiveness of the female adaptive immune system.
This may help explain the discrepancy between our findings
and those of the only other study on scale allografts
in guppies, which reported that males and females show
equal levels of adaptive immunity [38]. The previous study
used animals that were descendants of fish from a low-
predation population, where coercive mating is less frequent
[71]. Our fish are descendants of animals from a high-
predation
site
[11],
where
coercive
matings
are
more
common. Population-level differences in the level of coercive

 mating, driven through differences in predation, may therefore
underlie variation in female adaptive immune response.
In conclusion, we found evidence for reduced immune
response in guppies selected for large brains, which provides
support for a functional trade-off between investment into
the brain versus immune function. While increased cognitive
abilities may ameliorate this trade-off, our findings suggest
that immune function is a potential factor constraining the
evolution of vertebrate brain size.
