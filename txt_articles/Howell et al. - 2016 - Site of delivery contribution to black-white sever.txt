Abstract
BACKGROUND—The black-white maternal mortality disparity is the largest disparity among all 
conventional population perinatal health measures and the mortality gap between black and white 
women in New York City has nearly doubled in recent years. For every maternal death, 100 
women experience severe maternal morbidity, a life threatening diagnosis or undergo a lifesaving 
procedure during their delivery hospitalization. Like maternal mortality, severe maternal morbidity 
is more common among black than white women. A significant portion of maternal morbidity and 
mortality is preventable making quality of care in hospitals a critical lever for improving 
outcomes. Hospital variation in risk-adjusted severe maternal morbidity rates exists. The extent to 
which variation in hospital performance on severe maternal morbidity rates contributes to black-
white disparities in New York City hospitals has not been studied.
OBJECTIVE—We examined the extent to which black-white differences in severe maternal 
morbidity rates in New York City hospitals can be explained by differences in the hospitals in 
which black and white women deliver.
STUDY DESIGN—We conducted a population-based study using linked 2011–2013 New York 
City discharge and birth certificate datasets (N= 353,773 deliveries) to examine black-white 
differences in severe maternal morbidity rates in New York City hospitals. Mixed-effects logistic

 regression with a random hospital-specific intercept was used to generate risk-standardized severe 
maternal morbidity rates for each hospital (N=40). We then assessed differences in the 
distributions of black and white deliveries among these hospitals.
RESULTS—Severe maternal morbidity occurred in 8,882 deliveries (2.5%) and was higher 
among black than white women (4.2% vs. 1.5%, p<.001). After adjustment for patient 
characteristics and comorbidities the risk remained elevated for black women (odds ratio=2.02; 
95% CI 1.89–2.17). Risk-standardized severe maternal morbidity rates among New York City 
hospitals ranged from 0.8 to 5.7 per 100 deliveries. White deliveries were more likely to be 
delivered in low morbidity hospitals: 65% of white versus 23% of black deliveries occurred in 
hospitals in the lowest tertile for morbidity. We estimated that black-white differences in delivery 
location may contribute as much as 47.7% of the racial disparity in severe maternal morbidity rates 
in New York City.
CONCLUSION—Black mothers are more likely to deliver at higher risk-standardized severe 
maternal morbidity hospitals than are white mothers, contributing to black-white disparities. More 
research is needed to understand the attributes of high performing hospitals and to share best 
practices among hospitals.
Keywords
disparities; hospital; severe maternal morbidity
Black women are 12 times more likely to suffer a pregnancy-related death than are white 
women in New York City.1 This disparity is three to four times greater than the US black-
white maternal mortality disparity.2 Not only are there striking racial disparities in maternal 
mortality rates but overall performance on the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) – the number 
of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births – in the US is poor compared to other countries: 
we rank 60th among World Health Organization member nations.3 For every maternal death, 
100 women experience severe maternal morbidity.4,5 Similar to racial/ethnic disparities in 
maternal mortality, black women are more likely to suffer from severe maternal morbidity 
than white women.4
Quality of health care in hospitals is a critical lever for improving outcomes as data suggest 
over one-third of maternal morbidity and mortality is preventable.6–9 Obstetrical 
complications are sensitive to the quality of care provided at delivery,10,11 and variations in 
the quality of maternal care across hospitals exists.12,13 The contribution of hospital quality 
to racial disparities in obstetrical outcomes has been less studied. The few studies that have 
examined this topic suggest that racial/ethnic minority women often deliver in lower quality 
hospitals.14,15 In our previous work investigating quality measures and severe maternal 
morbidity in New York City,16 we found wide variation in hospital performance. The 
objective for this study was to examine whether variation in hospital performance on severe 
maternal morbidity in New York City hospitals contributes to black-white disparities in this 
outcome. We focus on the black-white severe maternal morbidity disparity, as black-white 
maternal mortality represents the largest disparity among all the conventional perinatal 
health measures and the mortality gap between black and white women in NYC has nearly 
doubled in recent years.1,2

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA SOURCE
We used Vital Statistics birth records linked with New York State discharge abstract data - 
The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) for all delivery 
hospitalizations in New York City from 2011–2013. Data linkage was conducted by the New 
York State Department of Health and 98.8% of maternal discharge abstracts were linked 
with infant live birth certificates. Institutional Review Board approvals were obtained from 
the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the New York State 
Department of Health, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Delivery 
hospitalizations were identified based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes and 
DRG delivery codes.17 From linked records, four hospitals with annual delivery volumes 
less than five births and 1360 deliveries with missing hospital identifiers were excluded. The 
final sample included 353,773 deliveries at 40 hospitals.
SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY
We used a published algorithm to identify severe maternal morbidity, using diagnoses for 
life-threatening conditions (e.g. renal failure, eclampsia) and procedure codes for life-saving 
procedures (e.g. hysterectomy, ventilation, blood transfusion) defined by investigators from 
the Centers for Disease Prevention and Controls (CDC).5,18 As specified by the algorithm 
we excluded hospitalizations with a length of stay less than the 90th percentile as calculated 
separately for vaginal, primary, and repeat cesarean deliveries.5 All severe maternal 
morbidity hospitalizations associated with in-hospital mortality and transfer as well as 
severe complications identified by procedure codes were included regardless of the length of 
stay, as recommended.5 Transfers were defined as discharge disposition after delivery or 
source of admission for delivery as specified.5
COVARIATES
To risk-adjust hospital-level rates of maternal morbidity we used variables from the vital 
statistics records, including mothers’ sociodemographic characteristics (maternal age, self-
identified race and ethnicity, parity, education), prenatal care visits, and clinical and obstetric 
factors (multiple pregnancy, history of previous cesarean delivery, body mass index). New 
York City Vital Statistics collect self-identified race and ethnicity data. We ascertained 
patient insurance status from SPARCS. We also included diagnoses for patient risk factors 
that could lead to maternal morbidity but were likely present on admission to the hospital 
(e.g. diabetes, hypertension, obesity, premature rupture of membranes, disorders of 
placentation). These conditions have been used to risk-adjust for severe maternal 
morbidity,19 cesarean deliveries, and other maternal outcomes.16,20,21
We obtained teaching status from the American Hospital Association, ownership and 
nursery level from the New York State Department of Health, and volume of deliveries in 
each hospital from SPARCS to assess how other hospital characteristics are correlated with 
severe maternal morbidity.

 ANALYSIS
We compared the sociodemographic characteristics and clinical conditions of black and 
white women using Chi Square tests. We used mixed-effects logistic regression with a 
random hospital-specific intercept to generate risk-standardized severe maternal morbidity 
rates (SSMMR) for each hospital. The models included covariates described above. Hospital 
risk-standardized rates were computed from these models using methods recommended by 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Compare.16,22 These rates 
were the ratio of predicted to expected severe maternal morbidity rates, multiplied by the 
New York City average severe maternal morbidity rate. For each hospital, the numerator of 
the ratio is the number of severe maternal morbidity cases predicted on the bases of the 
hospital’s performance with its case-mix, and the denominator is the number of severe 
maternal morbidity cases expected on the bases of the New York City performance with that 
hospital’s case mix. We ranked hospitals from lowest to highest risk-standardized severe 
maternal morbidity rates. These analyses did not include hospital-level variables. We 
conducted a sensitivity analysis using observed to expected rates for hospital ranking and 
found that rankings differed very little between the CMS model and the standard observed to 
expected ratio. In addition, because blood transfusions are an important component of severe 
maternal morbidity, we examined the correlation between hospital rankings based on severe 
maternal morbidity with and without blood transfusion.
To assess racial disparities in the use of hospitals with the lowest morbidity rates, we 
calculated the cumulative distributions of births among hospitals ranked from the lowest to 
the highest standardized morbidity rate for black and white mothers. We used the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess whether the distributions of deliveries among hospitals 
differed for white and black women.23
To address the effects on black severe maternal morbidity rates of these differences in 
delivery location, we conducted a thought experiment and asked what would happen if black 
mothers went to the same hospitals as white mothers? We used the same risk-standardized 
morbidity model and kept all individual patient characteristics the same. We calculated the 
predicted probability of morbidity for each black mother at each hospital. For each black 
mother, we took the weighted average of these probabilities, where weights were the 
percentage of white mothers who went to each hospital. The difference between the 
predicted probability at the hospital a black mother went to and the weighted average 
probability if the black mother delivered at the white mother’s hospital is the decrease or 
increase in the probability of a morbid event. The sum of the difference in probabilities 
across all black women is the morbid events avoided if black mothers went to the same 
hospitals as white mothers, or the morbid events due to “between-hospital” disparities. A 
recent simulation study tested this approach against the more common approach of 
identifying “minority serving” facilities based on the percentage of black patients at a 
hospital and found that it more accurately measured the magnitude of between-hospital 
disparities, although both were successful at identifying the existence of disparities.24
To investigate the association between hospital characteristics and severe maternal morbidity 
rates, we estimated the mixed-effects logistic regression that included maternal 
sociodemographic and clinical factors as well as the hospital characteristics described above.

 All statistical analysis was performed using the SAS system software version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Black mothers accounted for 21% and white mothers for 32% of the 353,773 deliveries in 
New York City in 2011–2013. The remainder of the births were to Hispanics (29.9%), 
Asian/Pacific Islanders (16.7%) and others (1.6%). Table 1 shows the sociodemographic and 
clinical characteristics of black and white deliveries in our study sample. Severe maternal 
morbidity rates were higher among black (4.2%) as compared with white (1.5%) mothers. 
As shown in Table 1, maternal characteristics differed significantly between black and white 
women.
The majority of the 40 hospitals were private, had Level 3/4 nurseries, and were teaching 
hospitals.16 The median percent of black deliveries was 18.4 (IQR 9.5–35.8%). Hospitals 
were ranked according to risk-standardized morbidity rates, using a model that included 
maternal sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with severe maternal 
morbidity (Table 2, model 1). Unadjusted severe morbidity rates ranged from 0.6% to 11.5% 
and risk standardized rates from 0.8% to 5.7% (Figure 1). The risk standardized morbidity 
rate for the highest morbidity tertile of hospitals was 3.8% compared with 1.5% for the 
lowest morbidity tertile (p<0.001). Hospital rankings based on severe maternal morbidity 
with and without blood transfusion were strongly correlated (p<.0001).
The cumulative distribution of deliveries among hospitals ranked from lowest to highest 
morbidity rates differed for black and white mothers (p<0.001). The majority of white 
deliveries (65.3%) occurred in the hospitals in the lowest tertile for severe morbidity 
compared with 23.3% of all black deliveries. Eighteen percent of white deliveries and 37.3% 
of black deliveries occurred at hospitals in the highest morbidity tertile (Figure 2).
If black mother mothers delivered in the same hospitals as white women, our simulation 
model estimated that they would experience 940 fewer severe morbid events, leading to a 
reduction of black severe maternal morbidity rates by 47.7% from 4.2 to 2.9 (1.3 events per 
100 deliveries per year)
Results of our model fitting for severe maternal morbidity rates using maternal and hospital-
level variables revealed that teaching status, Level 3/4 nursery, private ownership, and very 
high volume status were associated with lower severe maternal morbidity rates, but did not 
fully account for the excess risk among black women.(Table 2, model 2)
COMMENT
Black women are more likely to deliver in New York City hospitals with higher risk-adjusted 
severe maternal morbidity rates. Severe maternal morbidity rates vary six fold across New 
York City hospitals. Our data demonstrate that racial differences in the distribution of 
deliveries may contribute to the black/white disparity in severe maternal morbidity rates in 
New York City Hospitals. If black women delivered at the same hospitals as white women

 our results suggest that nearly 1000 black women could avoid a severe morbid event during 
their delivery hospitalization annually in New York City.
While much of the focus on reducing racial disparities in obstetrics examines social 
determinants of health, our results highlight the need to address quality of care as an 
additional means to reduce racial disparities. Data suggest over one-third of maternal deaths 
and severe events are preventable. 6–9 Current efforts by the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists District II, Merck for Mothers, and the New York State 
Department of Health have made major efforts to standardize care on labor and delivery 
units and enhance quality.25–28 Data in obstetrics suggest that team building, specific clinical 
protocols, and improved communication are important targets for quality improvement in the 
setting of obstetrics and can improve outcomes.27 Our findings suggest quality improvement 
efforts targeting the lowest performing hospitals may both lower severe maternal morbidity 
rates for all mothers and narrow the black-white morbidity gap.
Our findings are consistent with a recent study using national data on delivery 
hospitalizations which found that blacks deliver in a concentrated set of hospitals and these 
hospitals have higher risk-adjusted severe maternal morbidity rates.14 Unlike this previous 
study, the current population-based study used a simulation method to quantify the impact of 
delivery location on the disparity. Others have also found that black-serving hospitals 
performed worse than other hospitals on delivery-related indicators using data from seven 
states.15 In pediatrics, investigators have found that black very low birth weight babies are 
more likely to be delivered in higher risk-adjusted very low birthweight neonatal mortality 
hospitals and in other areas of medicine including stroke and heart attack care, studies have 
documented that black and white patients are treated at different sites of care and black 
patients are often treated at higher mortality hospitals.12,13,29,30 Why hospitals that have a 
greater proportion of black deliveries experience higher risk-adjusted severe maternal 
morbidity is not known. Teaching status, level of nursery, volume, and ownership were 
associated with severe maternal morbidity rates in New York City hospitals but did not fully 
account for the excess risk among black women.
The reasons why women deliver at specific hospitals is complex and may be related to a 
number of factors, including where a patient lives, distance to the hospital, patterns of racial 
segregation, physician referral, risk perception, patient choice, access, insurance, and the 
management of possible medical emergencies during pregnancy.12,31 Previous studies 
examining delivery hospital and distance in the setting of very low birth weight births found 
that distance did not explain why black women were more likely to deliver at higher risk-
adjusted neonatal mortality hospitals.31 The extent to which other factors contributed to site 
of delivery in this study could not be fully evaluated.
Our analysis has some limitations. We used administrative data (ICD-9 procedure and 
diagnosis codes) that do not contain important clinical data on severity of illness. Both vital 
statistics and SPARCS have limitations with reliability of specific variables.32,33 We used a 
published algorithm to identify severe maternal morbidity cases and did not conduct a 
medical chart review for case ascertainment. Nevertheless we conducted a population-based 
study and were able to construct a robust risk-adjustment model that included important

 confounders available in our linked data set (e.g. maternal education, parity, body mass 
index). We used a simulation model and estimated the extent to which differences in the 
distribution of deliveries may contribute to disparities. However, similar to others, we were 
unable to account for unmeasured factors that are associated with both race and severe 
maternal morbidity. Further, we assumed that unmeasured factors such as social risk are 
conditionally independent of hospital choice and do not impact choice of hospital after 
adjusting for a patient’s measured factors, such as race, education, and insurance. If this 
assumption is false, our simulation results could exaggerate the role of hospital in black-
white severe maternal morbidity disparities. In other words, we would attribute higher rates 
of severe maternal morbidity to the hospital when some of the excess risk should be 
attributed to the social risk or other characteristics of the patient population. We focused on 
black-white differences in distribution of deliveries given the significant increase in maternal 
mortality among black women in New York City.1
We found that differences in the hospitals in which black and white women deliver 
contribute to the disparity in severe maternal morbidity rates between blacks and whites in 
New York City hospitals. The increasing excess of maternal deaths and high rate of severe 
morbid events among black women in New York City are concerning. Our data suggests that 
efforts to improve care at the lowest performing hospitals may be an important step to 
reduce these disparities
