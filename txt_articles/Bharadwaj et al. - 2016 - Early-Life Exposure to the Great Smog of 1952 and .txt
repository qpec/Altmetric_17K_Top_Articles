Abstract
Rationale:Littleisknownaboutthelong-termeffectsofairpollution
exposure and the root causes of asthma. We use exposure to intense
air pollution from the 1952 Great Smog of London as a natural
experiment to examine both issues.
Objectives: Todetermine whetherexposureto extremeairpollution
in utero or soon after birth affects asthma development later in life.
Methods: This was a natural experiment using the unanticipated
pollution event by comparing the prevalence of asthma between
those exposed to the Great Smog in utero or the first year of life with
those conceived well before or after the incident and those residing
outside the affected area at the time of the smog.
Measurements and Main Results: Prevalence of asthma during
childhood (ages 0–15) and adulthood (ages .15) is analyzed for
2,916 respondents to the Life History portion of the English
Longitudinal Study on Aging born from 1945 to 1955. Exposure to
the Great Smog in the first year of life increases the likelihood of
childhood asthma by 19.87 percentage points (95% confidence
interval [CI], 3.37–36.38). We also find suggestive evidence that
early-life exposure led to a 9.53 percentage point increase (95% CI,
24.85 to 23.91) in the likelihood of adult asthma and exposure in
utero led to a 7.91 percentage point increase (95% CI, 22.39 to 18.20)
in the likelihood of childhood asthma.
Conclusions: These results are the first to link early-life pollution
exposure to later development of asthma using a natural experiment,
suggesting the legacy of the Great Smog is ongoing.

At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: Although the
episodic triggers of asthma are widely known, the root causes of
the condition itself are poorly understood. Evidence on the
long-term impacts of exposure to air pollution is also limited.
The 1952 London Smog provides a natural experiment for
studying the underlying cause of asthma and the long-term
effects of air pollution exposure very early in life, while limiting
threats from statistical confounding.
What This Study Adds to the Field: We find that children
exposed to the intense air pollution within the first year
of life were more likely to develop asthma during both
childhood and adulthood. Extreme air pollution events
remain a concern today, with such places as Beijing
experiencing the highest recorded levels of air pollution as
recently as November 2015. Such events have an immediate
impact on population health and an effect on health many
years later. Evidence about the role of early-life exposure
to air pollution as a root cause of asthma provides policy
makers and physicians with new insights about how to
prevent and potentially address the growing prevalence of
the condition.

 The Great London Smog of 1952 changed the
course of environmental science and policy.1
Original analyses and reanalyses have
demonstrated that the air pollution
concentrations that resulted from an
unanticipated temperature inversion from
December 5–9, 1952, had immediate,
detrimental effects on population health
(1–3). During this incident, pollution
concentrations exceeded current regulations
and guidelines by a factor of 5–23 (3). Part
of what has made the study of this “killer
fog” so convincing is that its timing and
severity were unexpected, with the extent of
damage not recognized until after the smog
dissipated (4). This made the occurrence of
the elevated pollution concentrations “a
grand experiment” in the spirit of John
Snow (5, 6), ripe for understanding the
causal effect from exposure.
Although much research has examined
the immediate effects of exposure to the Great
Smog on outcomes, such as mortality and
respiratory disease, very little, if any, has
explored the long run effects from exposure.
Of particular interest are the potential long run
impacts on children exposed during the early
stages of life, because health insults during this
critical period may cause significant, long-
lasting harm (7, 8). In this paper, we examine
the relationship between early childhood
exposure to the Great Smog and the
development of asthma later in life. Asthma is
of particular interest because, although factors
leading to asthma exacerbation are well
understood, much less is known about the
underlying causes of asthma (9–11). The
results of this study have not been reported in
any prior abstract or paper.
Methods
Data
This study relies on a combination of
publicly available and special use data from
ELSA (the English Longitudinal Study on
Aging), a nationally representative survey of
the English population aged 50 years and
older (12). ELSA collects longitudinal data
relating to health, social, and economic
outcomes. The Life History survey, the
source of the asthma outcomes used in the
current study, was undertaken in 2007 as
part of the third wave of ELSA surveys.
The first wave of the survey,
undertaken in 2002, only covered those born
before March 1, 1952. With wave three of
ELSA, an additional sample of residents
older than 50 was added, randomly selected
from those born between March 1, 1953,
and February 28, 1956. Although the
random ELSA sample in wave three omits
people born between March 1, 1952, and
February 28, 1953, the partners of sampled
individuals born in this period are included
in the data and used in our analysis (13).
Focusing on children conceived within a
few years of the Great Smog, we use year and
month of birth, obtained from special use
data, to pinpoint the timing of the child’s
potential exposure to the smog. Special use
data on first place of residence is used to
identify children who resided in London at
the time of their birth. Individuals are coded
as “born in London” if their first residence
was reported within the current bounds of
the M25 London Orbital Motorway; we also
explore alternative definitions for whether
the respondent was born in London.
Of the 7,855 respondents to the Life
History interview, we focus on 2,916 born
between 1945 and 1955 with an identifiable
first place of residence (208 respondents
were dropped because of insufficient
information). In our main analysis, we
define early exposure to the Great Smog as
having a first place of residence in London
and being in utero or in the first year of life
at the time of the smog.
Our health outcomes of interest are
childhood and adulthood asthma. As part
of the Life History survey, respondents
were asked: “Did you have any of the
health conditions on this card during your
childhood (that is from when you were born
up to and including age 15)”? and “Which
conditions on this card, if any, accounted for
of ill health or disability (that you had as an
adult)”? For both questions, “Asthma” was
one of the health conditions listed on the
referenced card. Using these two questions,
we code individuals as having “childhood
asthma” or “adulthood asthma,” respectively.
Additional variables preselected for the
analysis are sex and housing characteristics
at age 10, the youngest available age. We
included sex to account for differential
asthma rates between genders and housing
characteristics to proxy for childhood
socioeconomic status (14, 15). Housing
characteristics included are number of
bedrooms; number of people living in the
house; and specific facilities available within
the accommodation, which include fixed
bath, cold and hot running water, inside
toilet, and central heating. Unfortunately,
no information on exposure to other
commonly cited risk factors for asthma,
such as maternal asthma, respiratory
syncytial virus infection, lower respiratory
infection, or flu in infancy, are available
before the reported development of asthma.
Analysis
We perform two complementary analyses to
explore the relationship between early
childhood exposure to the Great Smog and
later onset of asthma. In our first analysis, we
separately plot the rates of childhood and adult
asthma by date of birth and place of residence
using local polynomial regressions with
Epanechnikov kernel weights (16). If pollution
exposure during early childhood leads to later
disease development, we expect to see higher
rates of asthma in both childhood and
adulthood for children residing in London at
an early age during the Great Smog when
compared with (1) children born outside of
London, regardless of age, who were not
exposed to the smog; (2) older children born
within London, who did not experience early
exposure to the smog; and (3) younger
children born in London but conceived
after the smog, who were also not exposed.
All three comparisons are essential for
interpreting our results as consistent with the
long-lasting effects from early childhood
exposure.
This research design accounts for several
potential threats caused by confounding. For
example, children born in London were more
likely to experience asthma later in life for
reasons other than exposure to the smog,
because urban life in London posed many
threats to the health of a child; this is captured
by comparing early exposed London-born
children with other London-born children
who were born either after the smog or well
before it. Additionally, if some change in
health services or child rearing practices
impacted all children across England around
the time of the Great Smog, there is a danger
of misattributing any resulting secular effects
to the smog. The described analysis addresses
this potential concern through the
comparison of children living in London who
were exposed to the smog with those of
similar ages outside the city.
The second analysis supplements the
graphical one with a multivariate regression
analysis to provide estimates (and 95%
confidence intervals [CIs]) of the magnitude
1The term “smog” refers to a mix of pollutants
(smoke) and environmental factors (fog).

 of the relationship between exposure and the
development of asthma. In these models, we
regress the outcomes of interest (childhood
and adult asthma measured as binary
variables) on whether the respondent was
born in London, whether the respondent was
in utero or age 0–1 during the time of the
smog, and an interaction term between born
in London and in utero or age 0–1 during the
time of the smog. This regression analysis
amounts to a difference-in-differences analysis
(17). The first difference compares the asthma
prevalence of children born within London
at the time of the smog with the asthma
prevalence of children born within London
either greater than 1 year before or 9 months
after the smog. The second difference
performs the same comparison but for
children born outside of London, which is
then subtracted from the first difference
to obtain the estimate of interest.
In addition to the variables described
previously, we adjust these regressions for a
quadratic term in year of birth (to account
for flexible trends in asthma rates over time)
and a series of month indicators (to account
for the possibility of differential asthma rates
by season of birth). In sensitivity analyses,
we further adjust for the child’s sex and
characteristics of their home at age 10.
We also augment this regression
approach with an analysis that controls
for year of birth more flexibly by replacing
the quadratic terms with a series of
indicator variables, which are then
interacted with whether the respondent
was born in London; this approach allows
us to assess the differential effect from
exposure to the smog at various ages. The
Appendix E1 in the online supplement
describes both regression analyses in
more detail.
We use a linear probability model for
the estimation throughout. Under the linear
probability model the coefficient on the
interaction term (age at the time of the Great
Smog and place of birth) is the difference-in-
differences estimate described previously
(17), and should be interpreted as the
percentage point change in the likelihood of
developing asthma. Using a nonlinear
model complicates the interpretation of
such interaction terms (see Reference 18 for
more details).2
To account for the group nature of
exposure to the smog, SEs in all analyses
are clustered at the year-month of birth
level separately for those inside and
outside of London (19). All analyses were
conducted using STATA statistical
software, version 14.1 (STATA Corp,
College Station, TX).

 and year of birth. Note that the
substantially smaller number of births
in 1952 for both those born inside and
outside of London is caused by the
anomaly in the ELSA sampling procedure
described previously. Table 1 summarizes
covariates by respondent place of birth
and age at the time of the Great Smog;
characteristics of respondents are quite
similar across place and date of birth.
Table 2 summarizes the numbers of
respondents that reported suffering
from asthma during childhood and as
adults. Asthma prevalences in our
sample are 3.98% during childhood and
2.88% in adulthood, comparable with
other estimates of asthma rates at the
time (20).
Focusing first on childhood
asthma, Figure 1 shows a relatively
flat relationship between asthma and
date of birth for children born outside
London. For children born in London
outside of the smog period, the
prevalence of asthma is generally
similar to those born outside of London
throughout the study period. For
children born in London around the time
of the Great Smog, however, rates of
reported asthma are considerably higher.
Nearly 20% of children born in London
around the time of the smog reported
childhood asthma, whereas the rate never
exceeds 11% among any other birth
cohort. We also note that the spike in
asthma rates for those born in 1949 could
be a result of another smog incident that
occurred in London during November
1948 (21).3
Figure 2 presents graphical evidence
for adult asthma. Asthma rates in
adulthood are generally lower and
noisier, but a similar pattern emerges.
Those born in London around the time of
the smog have the highest rates of adult
asthma, roughly double those of other
cohorts. Otherwise, however, the rates
of adult asthma between the two birth-
location groups track one-another
closely, highlighting the quality of the
control group in this setting and
suggesting that exposure to risk factors
for adult asthma is more uniform within
birth cohort than those for childhood
asthma.
The multivariate regression results
are presented in Table 3. Shown in
column 1, those born in London who
were 0–1 years old when the smog
occurred have a 19.9 percentage point
increased (95% CI, 3.37–36.38) likelihood
of developing asthma during childhood
relative to the comparison group of
children born outside London and those
who were not exposed to the Great Smog
in utero or at age 0–1. Those in utero
during the smog have a 7.9 percentage
point increase (95% CI, 22.39 to 18.20)
in childhood asthma, although it is not
statistically significant. When we include
additional controls (respondent sex and
housing characteristics), shown in
column 2, the estimates remain virtually
unchanged.
For adult asthma, the results in
column 3 indicate that exposure to the
Great Smog at age 0–1 is associated with a
9.5 percentage point increase (95% CI,
24.85 to 23.90) in the likelihood of the
development of adult asthma compared
with baseline levels, and a 0.75
percentage point increase (95% CI,
25.34 6.84) for those exposed in utero.
Neither of these estimates, however, is
statistically significant at conventional
levels. The results in column 4, which
include additional controls, are again
very similar.
The results in the next set of figures
more flexibly control for age at the time
of exposure by interacting an indicator
variable for each year of birth with
whether each respondent was born in
London. Figure 3A shows a statistically
significant increase in the likelihood of
childhood asthma for those born in 1952
(i.e., aged 0–1 at the time of the smog)

 and those born in 1953 (i.e., a similar
group to those in utero at the time of the
smog). Furthermore, the estimate for
1952 births is the largest of all groups,
with the estimate for 1953 the third
largest. These estimates are also quite
comparable in magnitude with those
obtained using the quadratic specification
for year of birth.
Focusing on adult asthma in
Figure 3B, the difference in asthma
rates is also highest for those born
in 1952 (age 0–1 during the smog),
although the estimate is not statistically
significant (P = 0.111), likely caused by
sample size and related statistical power
issues. Again, the estimates for those
born around the time of the Great
Smog are comparable with those
in Figure 1 and those using the
quadratic in year of birth (presented
in Table 3).
Discussion
This study presents the first evidence
of long-lasting effects from early
childhood exposure to the Great
Smog of 1952, focusing on the
development of asthma through
childhood and in adulthood. Using
nonparametric plots of the raw data
and multivariate regression analysis,
we demonstrate that children born
in London around the time of the
Great Smog experienced dramatically
higher rates of self-reported asthma
during childhood. Although we
do not find statistically significant
effects for adult asthma, we generally
find similar patterns of results for
childhood and adult asthma in that they

 both peak among those in utero and
ages 0–1.4
Although we cannot address the
exact mechanism behind this finding,
the most consistent explanation rests
with the “fetal origins hypothesis” (7).
Rapid biologic development occurs
during the early childhood period
(23), which is particularly sensitive to
external stimuli (24, 25). Exposure to
such stimuli can lead to permanent
changes in human development, and
disease states as an adult (26). For
example, exposure to harmful stimuli
can lead to epigenetic changes through
DNA methylation, histone modifications,
and microRNA expression, thereby
affecting a human’s genetic expression
and susceptibility to disease (27).
Asthma is one such disease with
presumed fetal origins (28).
Air pollution is an external stimulus
that may affect fetal programming,
including genetic expression. For example,
DNA methylation of the FOXP3 gene affects
the population of regulatory T cells, which
are an essential driver of chronic asthma
(29). Exposure to fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) has been associated with
hypermethylation of the FOXP3 gene
(30). Although the precise pollutant mix
during the 1952 episode is unknown,
PM2.5, which was found in postmortem
examinations of lung tissues among those
exposed to the London Smog, was certainly
present (21).
A growing body of empirical
evidence using historical events suggests
that early exposure to negative stressors
affects various outcomes later in life
(8, 31, 32), with an emerging focus on
air pollution in particular (33–35). The
literature that directly explores the
relationship between early childhood
exposure to pollution and asthma
development is also growing rapidly,
but remains strictly correlational in
nature (14, 36–41) and hence can
do little to rule out the potential
threats from confounding that have
historically proven important in
pollution-related studies. Our
approach, by relying on the grand
experiment of the Great Smog,
overcomes many potential confounding
threats (42), and suggests a strong
possibility of a causal link between
early childhood exposure to air
pollution and the later development
of asthma.
One potential limitation of our
analysis concerns measurement error
related to our definitions of asthma
and exposure. The asthma data are
self-reported, which may result in
misclassification caused by recall bias.
However, because recall bias is
unlikely to differ across exposed and
comparison groups, it is unlikely to
bias our results. Moreover, the rates
of childhood asthma observed in our
study closely reflect those from a
survey and doctor examination of
primary school students in
Aberdeen, United Kingdom in 1964
(43, 44), suggesting that recall issues
are minimal.
Another measurement issue is
our demarcation of those within the
geographic bounds of the Great Smog. Our
definition of London includes the area now
bounded by the M25 Ring Road. If the
smog were concentrated in the inner
boroughs of London, we could be
misclassifying the extent of exposure by
including the outer boroughs. When we
restrict our analysis to include only
the inner boroughs (and omit those in the
outer boroughs), our estimates change
minimally. Conversely, because inversions
tend to cover large areas, it might be the
case that we are classifying too small an
area as affected by the smog. To the
extent that poor air quality affected
areas outside of London, the magnitude
of our estimated effects would be
biased downward and thus understate
the harmful effects of the Great
Smog. Finally, misreporting of a
respondent’s first place of residence,
although not possible to detect, would
again lead to downward bias in our
estimates (45).
Although confounding is always a
potential concern in nonexperimental
settings, this concern is greatly limited in
our analysis. The Great Smog was an
unexpected, short-lived event caused by

95% confidence intervals in parentheses are calculated using SEs clustered by born in London status and month of birth. All regressions control for a
quadratic term in year of birth, indicators for month of birth, indicators for in utero and 0–1 years old, and an indicator for born in London.
Covariate-adjusted regressions include controls for respondent’s sex and housing characteristics at age 10 (number of bedrooms, number of people living
in the house, cold running water, hot running water, inside toilet, central heat, and fixed bath). The first coefficient in column 1 reveals that exposure to the
Great Smog between birth and age 1 (i.e., being born in London between December 1951 and November of 1952) is associated with a 19.87 percentage
point increase in the likelihood of developing childhood asthma.
4Some differences in the childhood and adult
results clearly exist and may be attributable to the
different etiology of adult asthma (22). Figure 2
also suggests the adult asthma rates are much
noisier, indicating a potential role for background
factors.
5Several other studies have used inversion
layers to study the contemporaneous
effects of air pollution on health (46–48).

 with the use of multiple comparison
groups helps us to rule out alternative
explanations for the later rise in
asthma. The results we find are
unlikely to be an artifact from living
in an urban area because our estimate
is the change in differences between
asthma among those born in London
and others. Thus, the higher average
prevalence of asthma among urban
children is removed from
consideration in our estimates.
Similarly, our findings cannot be
attributed to other commonly cited risk
factors for the development of asthma
unless the prevalence of these factors
changed differentially within versus
outside of London only during
the Great Smog event. It is also unlikely
that the pattern we find is caused by
temporal or seasonal trends because
asthma rates only spike for the exposed
cohorts. Finally, our estimates do not
seem to be the result of nationwide
circumstances that coincided with the
timing of the smog because we do not
see a spike in asthma rates among
non-London-born children at the time
of the smog.
The only alternative explanation
that could generate the pattern of
results uncovered by our analysis is the
occurrence of another event that occurred
only in London at the same time as the
Great Smog and had latent health
effects only among children that were
very young at the time. We are unaware
of any other such event.
Rather, the dramatic spike in
asthma rates only among those
exposed at the most vulnerable ages
suggests that early childhood exposure
to high levels of pollution contributed
to the development of asthma later in
life. Thus, the legacy of the Great
Smog lives on in England today,
more than a half century on. The
implications of our results are quite
broad, raising concerns about sizeable
health burdens from present-day air
pollution that stretch far into the
future. Although the mix of pollutants
during the Great Smog may differ
from the mix in major pollution events
today, parallels have been drawn to
recent events in such places as Beijing
and Northeastern China (49, 50).
Going forward, the continued use of
natural experiments with better
surveillance of relevant outcomes,
through surveys or administrative
records, and improved measurement
of environmental exposure in utero and
in early childhood will further validate
this study. n
