IMPORTANCE Low income has been associated with poor health outcomes. Owing to
retirement, wealth may be a better marker of financial resources among older adults.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association of wealth with mortality and disability among older
adults in the United States and England.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and English
Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) are nationally representative cohorts of
community-dwelling older adults. We examined 12 173 participants enrolled in HRS and
7599 enrolled in ELSA in 2002. Analyses were stratified by age (54-64 years vs 66-76 years)
because many safety-net programs commence around age 65 years. Participants were
followed until 2012 for mortality and disability.
EXPOSURES Wealth quintile, based on total net worth in 2002.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality and disability, defined as difficulty performing an
activity of daily living.
RESULTS A total of 6233 US respondents and 4325 English respondents aged 54 to 64 years
(younger cohort) and 5940 US respondents and 3274 English respondents aged 66 to 76
years (older cohort) were analyzed for the mortality outcome. Slightly over half of
respondents were women (HRS: 6570, 54%; ELSA: 3974, 52%). A higher proportion of
respondents from HRS were nonwhite compared with ELSA in both the younger (14% vs 3%)
and the older (13% vs 3%) age cohorts. We found increased risk of death and disability as
wealth decreased. In the United States, participants aged 54 to 64 years in the lowest wealth
quintile (Q1) (�$39 000) had a 17% mortality risk and 48% disability risk over 10 years,
whereas in the highest wealth quintile (Q5) (>$560 000) participants had a 5% mortality risk
and 15% disability risk (mortality hazard ratio [HR], 3.3; 95% CI, 2.0-5.6; P < .001; disability
subhazard ratio [sHR], 4.0; 95% CI, 2.9-5.6; P < .001). In England, participants aged 54 to 64
years in Q1 (�£34,000) had a 16% mortality risk and 42% disability risk over 10 years,
whereas Q5 participants (>£310,550) had a 4% mortality risk and 17% disability risk
(mortality HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.7-7.0; P < .001; disability sHR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.1-4.2; P < .001).
In 66- to 76-year-old participants, the absolute risks of mortality and disability were higher,
but risk gradients across wealth quintiles were similar. When adjusted for sex, age, race,
income, and education, HR for mortality and sHR for disability were attenuated but remained
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Low wealth was associated with death and disability in both
the United States and England. This relationship was apparent from age 54 years and
continued into later life. Access to health care may not attenuate wealth-associated
disparities in older adults.

 A
lthough the past 50 years have seen significant over-
all increases in life expectancy worldwide,1 dispari-
ties in mortality along socioeconomic gradients con-
tinue to grow, both in the United States2,3 and Europe.4,5 As
the global population ages, there has been a concurrent rise
in the rates of disability, raising concerns over whether the
gains in longevity are actually contributing to “healthy life
expectancy.”6 In the United States, the burden of disability is
disproportionately borne by those of low socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES), and this disparity appears to be growing.7
PreviousstudiesoftheUSpopulationhavedemonstrateda
strong association between low SES and both increased risk of
mortality8-11 and increased risk of disability.12-18 The seminal
Whitehall study in the United Kingdom demonstrated similar
findings,19,20ashaveotherstudiesinEurope.21Mostresearchto

Methods
Study Population
We examined community-dwelling participants interviewed
in the 2002 wave of HRS, a nationally representative sample
of US adults older than 50 years,32 and ELSA, a nationally rep-
resentative sample of English adults older than 50 years that
is similar in design to HRS.33 Baseline response rates were
78.0% for HRS and 70.2% for ELSA.34 In both studies, partici-
pants were interviewed biennially on a range of social, health,
and economic circumstances. Respondents were followed
through2012fordeathandnewdifficultyinanactivityofdaily

(HRS,8891;ELSA,4712)wereincludedinthedisabilityanalysis
(see eFigure in the Supplement).
Measures
The outcome measures of interest were death and disability
(defined as the development of any ADL difficulty). In HRS,
the date of death was determined using an algorithm that used
the National Death Index, Medicare files, and HRS surviving
family member exit interviews. In ELSA, year of death was
available, but date of death was estimated using a standard ap-
proach developed for HRS. If there was no interview during
the death year, the date of death was assigned as July first. If
the last live interview occurred in the same year as death, the
date of death was assigned as the mean date between the last
interview date and the last day of the year.
The HRS and ELSA respondents reported difficulty, not ex-
pected to improve within 3 months, with any of 5 ADLs: dress-
ing, bathing, eating, getting in and out of bed, and using the
toilet. If the answer to any one of these 5 questions was any-
thing other than fully independent, they were considered as
having an ADL difficulty.

Key Points
Question Are different levels of wealth associated with death and
disability in older adults in the United States and England?
Findings In this cohort study of 12 173 older adults in the United
States and 7599 in England, those in the lowest wealth quintile
had significantly higher risk of death and disability than their
highest wealth counterparts at all ages studied. This relationship
was found across the wealth spectrum in both countries, despite
differing safety-net health care systems.
Meaning Policies geared toward decreasing wealth-related
disparities in death and disability in older adults should target
determinants of health outside of access to health care.

Results
Respondent Characteristics
A total of 6233 US respondents and 4325 English respon-
dents aged 54 to 64 years (younger cohort) and 5940 US
respondents and 3274 English respondents aged 66 to 76
years (older cohort) were analyzed for the mortality outcome
(see eFigure in the Supplement). Slightly over half of respon-
dents were women (HRS: 6570, 54%; ELSA: 3974, 52%).
A higher proportion of respondents from HRS were non-
white compared with ELSA in both the younger (14% vs 3%)
and the older (13% vs 3%) age cohorts (Table 1). We found a
more than 100-fold difference in wealth across quintiles. For
example, for US respondents aged 66 to 76 years, the lowest
wealth quintile (Q1) had a mean wealth of $8366, whereas
the highest wealth quintile (Q5) had a mean wealth of
$1 363 311. Baseline characteristics were similar between
cohorts with regard to marital status, comorbid medical con-
ditions, tobacco use, and number of ADL/IADL difficulties.
Inequality in wealth and income based on Gini coeffi-
cientswaslargerintheUnitedStatesthaninEngland,andlarger
for wealth than for income in both countries and both age
groups (see eTable 1 in the Supplement). For example, for the
older age group, the Gini coefficient for wealth in HRS was 0.65
compared with 0.57 in ELSA, and for these 2 groups the re-
spective coefficients for income were 0.49 and 0.35.
Wealth and Mortality, Ages 54 to 64 Years
In the younger cohort, decreasing wealth was associated
with increased hazard of death (Figure 1). The HRS respon-
dents in Q1 had a 3.3-fold increased hazard of death com-
pared with their Q5 counterparts (95% CI, 2.0-5.6) (Table 2).
The cumulative incidence of death over 10 years for Q1
respondents was 17%, compared with 5% among Q5 respon-
dents. In the ages 54 to 64 years ELSA cohort, Q1 respon-
dents had a 4.3-fold increased hazard of death as their Q5
counterparts (95% CI, 2.7-7.0). The cumulative incidence of
death for the lowest wealth quintile was 16%, compared
with 4% for the wealthiest. In both countries, the largest dif-
ference in mortality was found between Q1 and Q2, with
minimal difference between Q4 and Q5. The HRs from the
adjusted model were attenuated, but Q1 continued to have a
statistically significantly higher hazard of death compared
with Q5 (HRS: HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0-4.0; ELSA: HR, 2.6; 95%
CI, 1.5-4.5).
Wealth and Disability, Ages 54 to 64 Years
In the younger cohort, the relationship between wealth and
disability was similar to the relationship between wealth and
mortality (Figure 2). The US respondents in Q1 had a 4-fold in-
crease in the hazard of any ADL difficulty compared with re-
spondents in Q5 (sHR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.9-5.6) (Table 3). Forty-
eight percent of Q1 respondents had disability at 10 years,
compared with 15% of Q5 respondents. At 2 years, those in Q1
had similar rates of disability as those in Q5 at 10 years
(Figure 2). After 10 years, nearly half of all Q1 respondents had
developed an ADL difficulty. Younger English respondents in
Q1 had 3-fold increased hazard of any ADL difficulty than their
Q5 counterparts (sHR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.1-4.2). Forty-two per-
centofQ1respondentshaddisabilityat10years,comparedwith

(Q1 vs Q5 sHR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-3.8).
Similar Results in the Younger (54-64 Years)
and Older (66-76 Years) Cohorts
The wealth-outcomes relationship was similar between the
younger and older cohorts. After age 65 years, the absolute rate
of both death and disability increased in both HRS and ELSA,
but no changes were observed in the relationship between
wealth and mortality or ADL difficulty (Figure 1). Older US re-
spondents in Q1 had a significantly increased hazard of death
compared with those in Q5 (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8-2.6) (Table 2);
42% of older Q1 US respondents were dead at 10 years. A simi-
lar association was present in the older English cohort with a
2-fold increased hazard of death for those in Q1 vs those in Q5
(HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.6); 36% of older Q1 English respon-
dents were dead at 10 years.
The wealth-disability relationship was qualitatively simi-
lar to the wealth-mortality relationship and was strong in the
older cohort in both the United States and England. Absolute
rates of disability at 10 years were high for those with the low-
est wealth in both the United States and England, reaching
nearly 50% in both countries (Figure 2). In both the United
States and England, older respondents in Q1 had a 2-fold in-

their Q5 counterparts (HRS: HR; 2.1; 95% CI, 1.8-2.5; ELSA: HR,
2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.7). In both countries, the largest gap in death
and disability in the older cohort remained between Q1 and Q2,
with less difference between Q4 and Q5.

Discussion
We evaluated the relationship between wealth, mortality,
and disability among older adults in both the United States
and England. We found that for both 54- to 64-year old
adults and 66- to 76-year old adults in both the United
States and England, lower wealth was associated with
increased hazard of death and disability. Furthermore, the
absolute risk of death and disability among those with low-
est wealth was high in both countries.
Similar to prior research on more limited cohorts,24,27-29
this study found a strong inverse relationship between wealth
and mortality. In addition, this study extended prior work by
showing the strong inverse relationship between wealth and
disability. Disability is a critically important outcome in older
adults that is a strong predictor of quality of life,36 hospital-
ization and nursing home placement.37-40 We found high rates
of disability among the lowest wealth quintile, even in the
younger age cohort. The consequences of disability in this
groupmaybedisproportionatelyburdensome.Thosewithlow-
est wealth are likely least able to mobilize financial resources

In our study, the greatest improvements in health out-
comes were seen between the lowest wealth quintile (Q1) and
the second lowest wealth quintile (Q2). In both countries and
in both age groups, those in Q1 had a much higher hazard of
death and disability than those in Q2. Therefore, at the low end
of the wealth spectrum, relatively small increases in wealth
seem to contribute to substantial gains in life expectancy and
function. Our findings extend the results of previous studies
of income and mortality, which showed the greatest mortal-

 ity gradient at low income10 with a continuing but smaller gra-
dient at higher incomes.8 These results suggest that health sys-
tems should be designed to specifically target the needs of
individuals with lowest wealth. Policy interventions to de-
crease disparities will have the highest impact by focusing on
society’
s poorest members.
Though we did not perform direct statistical compari-
sons, one of the most surprising findings of our study was the
lack of major qualitative differences in the wealth-mortality
andwealth-disabilityrelationshipsintheUnitedStatesandEn-
gland despite drastically different health care systems in these
countries. Furthermore, although age 65 years heralds the ar-
rival of many social support programs in both the United States
and England, we found no evidence of lessened wealth-
associated disparities after age 65 years. Although some have
hypothesized that the initiation of these safety-net programs
may attenuate wealth-associated mortality and functionality
disparities,23,41 our study suggests otherwise.42-45 One poten-
tial explanation for our findings is that poor health outcomes
may stem from cumulative long-term stressors throughout life
resulting from low wealth, such as unstable housing, expo-
sure to trauma, and susceptibility to drug and alcohol addic-
tion. Our study suggests that the ability of health care to ame-
lioratethesestressorsandimprovehealthlaterinlifeismodest.
In fact, access to medical care has been estimated to account
for only about 10% of avoided preventable mortality in the
United States.46 Furthermore, with a focus on treatment of dis-
ease rather than prevention and health promotion, the point
of intervention of the health care system in both the United
States and England may be too late to change the health tra-
jectory for low-wealth individuals.47 Thus, our results sug-
gest that in planning for population health, countries should
focus on fiscal and social policy in addition to health policy,
andtargetinterventionsearlierinthelifespan.48,49Futurestud-
ies involving countries participating in the Survey of Health,
Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) consortium would
be of high value in extending this work to other nations.
Strengths and Limitations
This study has both strengths and limitations. Strengths of this
study include: (1) the use of wealth instead of income to better
capturefinancialresourcesinanolderpopulationmorelikelyto
be retired; (2) our focus on disability, which has been shown to
be critically important to patients36 and predict a wide variety
of outcomes37-40; and (3) our ability to compare between the
UnitedStatesandEngland.Onelimitationofthedisabilityanaly-
sis was a lack of follow-up data or baseline ADL difficulty data
for3282HRSparticipants(27%)and2887ELSAparticipants(38%)
included in the mortality analysis (see eFigure in the Supple-
ment). Another limitation was the differences between the US
and English comparison groups. While ELSA was patterned af-
terHRSandthereforecollectedsimilardata,differencesexistbe-
tweenthecountries(eg,education)thatnecessitatedifferentap-
proaches to gathering information on certain variables. Finally,

securityandMedicaid(UnitedStates)andStatePension(England)
can be started before or after age 65 years.
Conclusions
We found that lower wealth was associated with higher mor-
tality and disability in older adults in both the United States
and England. This relationship was apparent from age 54 years
andcontinuedintolaterlife.Thisstudyfoundnoevidencethat
providing state-sponsored health insurance from birth (En-
gland), or providing state-sponsored health insurance later in
life (United States), eliminated wealth-associated health dis-
parities. Our study suggests that policy makers interested in
decreasing mortality and function disparities in older adults
should take a broad view and consider interventions beyond
providing access to health care.
