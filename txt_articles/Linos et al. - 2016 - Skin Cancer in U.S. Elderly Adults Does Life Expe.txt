Abstract
Background—Non-melanoma Skin cancer, or Keratinocyte Carcinoma (KC) is the most 
common malignancy and the 5th most costly cancer to Medicare. Several treatment types are 
effective, but treatments differ in cost and burden to patients. Because KCs do not typically affect 
survival, and most do not effect quality of life, we would expect lower frequency of intensive 
surgical treatments in patients with limited life expectancy.
Objectives—To examine whether life expectancy influences treatment pattern.
Design and Setting—We analyzed data from the nationally representative Health and 
Retirement Survey, linked to Medicare claims.
Participants—We included 9,653 treatments from N=2702 patients ≥65 years treated for either 
basal or squamous cell carcinoma between 1992 and 2012. Limited life expectancy defined by 
advanced age >85, medical comorbidities, Charlson score of ≥3, difficulty in at least one activity 
of daily living (ADL) and Lee index ≥13.
Measurements—Treatment type, including Mohs micrographic surgery (most intensive, highest 
cost), excision, or ED&C (least intensive, lowest cost) by procedure codes.
Results—Most KCs (61%) were treated surgically. Rates of Mohs (19%), excision (42%) and 
ED&C (39%) were no different in patients with limited life expectancy compared to those with 
normal life expectancy. For example, 19% of patients with difficulty or dependence in ADLs, 20% 
of patients with a Charlson score >3 and 15% of patients in their last year of life, received Mohs 
surgery. In addition, patients who ultimately died within 1 year of diagnosis were treated in the 
same way as those who lived longer.

 Conclusion—Treatment for KC, a generally non-fatal condition, appears to be guided by a one-
size-fits-all approach in which advanced age, health status, functional status, or prognosis are not 
associated with intensiveness of treatment. While intensive treatment for skin cancer may be 
indicated regardless of life expectancy when they cause symptoms, persons with limited life 
expectancy should be given choices, to ensure the treatment matches their goals and preferences.

INTRODUCTION
Keratinocyte carcinoma (KC) including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC) is by far the most common cancer in the United States,(1) with over 3.5 
million new cases treated each year.(2) A range of treatments that vary in invasiveness and 
cost can effectively treat most KCs. Common treatments include topical chemotherapy 
creams, tumor destruction with electrodessication and curettage (ED&C), or surgery. 
Surgery for KC can involve either simple excision, or Mohs micrographic surgery. The 
rationale for Mohs is that it aims to remove as much of the skin cancer as possible and 
prevent tumor recurrence, which for these typically slow-growing tumors occurs several 
years later (mean 3.3 years).(3) Although randomized trial data is limited, prospective cohort 
studies suggest that all surgical treatments offer >95% cure rates for primary tumors.(3)
When choosing among treatments with comparable clinical outcomes, considerations of 
cost, risks, procedure duration and patient preference matter. Mohs costs about twice as 
much as excision, which is about twice as expensive as ED&C.(4) Mohs also takes an 
average of 3 hours (up to 8 hours with repair), compared to an average of 1 hour for surgical 
excision or 20 minutes for ED&C.(5) Complications and patient-reported problems after 
these treatments are common, especially in elderly patients.(6) Medical problems with 
treatment including bleeding, pain and poor wound healing, are reported by 14% of patients,
(6) and usually occur within the first year of treatment, while the potential benefit of more 
intensive treatment in preventing recurrence is several years in the future. This lag-time to 
benefit is an increasingly important consideration when making healthcare decisions in 
elderly individuals who may not live long enough to benefit from more intensive treatments, 
but may be at risk for short-term treatment related complications.(7, 8)
In some cases, KCs cause distress to patients, either because its location causes cosmetic 
concerns, or because it leads to symptoms. In these situations, even in patients with severe 
comorbidity, the most intensive treatment option is clearly appropriate if it is best treats KC 
related symptoms. However, previous research demonstrates that the large proportion of skin 
cancers cause no symptoms, and many are discovered incidentally. For the majority of skin 
cancer that causes no or minimal symptoms, a patient’s life expectancy should be a 
fundamental determinant of procedure choice in an older patients with skin cancer for two 
reasons a) patients with limited life expectancy often prefer more conservative treatment 
choices and b) patients with limited life expectancy may not live long enough to benefit

 from intensive treatments when there is significant time lag to benefit. Therefore, we would 
expect to see lower rates of Mohs surgery in patients at the end of life.
Although KC is the fifth most costly cancer for Medicare (over $500 million annually),(9, 
10) only one single-city study has examined how prognostic characteristics of older patients 
impact treatment selection for this cancer.(11) We conducted this national study in order to 
examine whether patients with limited life expectancy were more likely to receive less 
invasive treatments. We took advantage of a national representative study linked to Medicare 
claims that had extensive information on patient characteristics that strongly impact life 
expectancy.
METHODS
Population
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging 
(grant number NIA U01AG009740) and is conducted by the University of Michigan. It is an 
ongoing nationally representative longitudinal study of the health of community-dwelling 
participants aged 50 and older that started in 1992. New participants are recruited to the 
study every six years in order to keep the study representative of US population. Interviews 
are administered over the telephone or in person every 2 years. Proxy respondents are asked 
to provide the answers for participants with physical or cognitive limitations. HRS collects 
information on financial, social, medical and functional status.
Our objective was to compare treatment patterns for KC according to individual prognostic 
characteristics in a nationally representative sample of older adults. Over 80% of HRS 
participants agree to have their Medicare claims linked to their HRS interviews.(12) 
Medicare claims data was available for years 1992 – 2008. Since the cancer treatments were 
ascertained from Medicare claims, our study is focused on participants 65 years or older 
who were eligible for Medicare and who had HRS data linked to Medicare claims data. We 
included subjects who had at least 1 year of Medicar1e claims data prior to the skin cancer 
claim..
Skin cancer treatment
The primary outcome was skin cancer treatment, defined based on both ICD-9 and 
procedure code. Skin cancer diagnosis was defined by ICD9 codes 232.xx or 173.xx. We 
looked at three different types of treatments: excision, ED&C and Mohs micrographic 
surgery. All procedures were identified in Outpatient and Carrier files using following 
HCPC procedure codes: Excisions (11600–11606, 11620–11626, 11640–11646, 26117, 
11750); ED&C (17260–17266, 17270–17276, 17280–17286); Mohs micrographic surgery 
(17311, 17313, 17304).(13) Although radiation therapy for BCCs is becoming more 
common, this treatment modality was extremely rare in our study period, and not included.
We identified a total of 10739 Medicare claims that reported at least one potential skin 
cancer treatment. We excluded claims for which there was no ICD-9 diagnosis of skin 
cancer in the 90 days before the claim (n=1893, 17%) from the study. We excluded an 
additional 618 (6%) claims because there was no corresponding HRS interview within one

 wave before the claim. We limited our analysis to white participants (excluded N=164, 1.5% 
claims from non-white participants). Each patient could have multiple claims (because skin 
cancer patients tend to get multiple tumors) and each claim could have more than one 
treatment (e.g. two skin cancers removed at the same visit). Our final sample included 8064 
Medicare claims for skin cancer treatment, corresponding to 9653 distinct treatments from 
2702 individual patients (Figure 1).
Prognostic characteristics
We considered a number of variables for which there is strong evidence of a link to limited 
life expectancy in older patients:
A.
Advanced age, defined as ≥ 85 years, which is associated with a life expectancy 
of 6 years.(14)
B.
Comorbid disease burden, considering individual diagnoses (heart disease, 
stroke, cancer, lung disease, diabetes and hypertension identified by self report) 
and Charlson comorbidity score, an index of disease burden closely linked to 
survival(15). Charlson score was derived from Medicare claims data.
C.
Self-reported independence in activities of daily living (ADLs, which include 
ability to bathe, dress, walk across a room, transfer in and out of bed, use the 
toilet, and eat). We classified subjects as having no difficulty in ADL function, 
having difficulty with one or more ADL, but able to do ADL without help, or 
needing help with at least one ADL (ADL dependence). This classification has 
been previously validated and strongly linked to survival.(16)
D.
Lee Index score, a validated prognostic score combining information on age and 
comorbidities and function which is strongly linked to survival.(17) We classified 
subjects as having a score either above or below 13—a score of 13 is associated 
with 59% mortality at 4 years and 91% at 10 years. The prognostic indices used 
including the Charlson and Lee Index and ADL assessments have been 
extensively validated prognostic indices (14–17).
Statistical Analysis
We first performed descriptive analyses, summarizing the characteristics of our sample and 
the prevalence of the three treatments. Next, we did bivariate and multivariate analyses to 
examine the relationship between various prognostic characteristics and proportions of the 3 
procedures included. Because surgery is more intensive than non-surgical treatments, we 
compared the rates of surgical procedures (excision and Mohs) and non-surgical procedures 
(ED&C). We also calculated differences between Mohs and non-Mohs procedures. Bivariate 
analyses used chi square tests. In order to directly estimate risk ratios instead of odds ratios, 
we used modified Poisson regression in multivariate analysis. (18) (19) All analyses were 
done at the skin cancer treatment level, but also accounted for clustering of treatments within 
individual patients. Our multivariate analyses used treatment choice as the outcome variable 
and the following predictor variables: age (<75, 75–85, ≥ 85), gender, income and net worth 
(dichotomized at median), comorbid conditions and functional status (not dependent in any,

 dependent in one, dependent in two or more). Analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 and 
Stata 12.1.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the study participants (N=9653 claims from 
N=2702 patients). Most patients were older men (63% men, mean age 79 years) with 
sociodemographic and medical characteristics representative of this age group nationally. 
Nineteen percent of participants had some difficulty in at least one activity of daily living, 
30% had a Charlson score of ≥3 and 14% had a Lee index of ≥13.
Table 2 shows the proportion of patients in the sample treated with each of the 3 most 
common procedures. Overall 61% of tumors underwent surgery: 19% underwent Mohs 
surgery and 42% underwent excision. The remaining 39% were treated with ED&C. No 
significant difference was noted in treatment rates in groups divided according to patient 
advanced age, medical comorbidities, indicators of limited life expectancy, or difficulty or 
dependence in activities of daily living. Among patients who ultimately died within 1 year of 
treatment, 15% received Mohs surgery (compared to 17% among those who lived longer 
p=0.34 ) and 51% received excision (compared to 43% of those who lived longer p=0.06).
The multivariate relative risk (RR) of receiving Mohs comparing patients with and without 
limited life expectancy, did not differ from 1, even after adjusting for age, gender, 
socioeconomic status, medical comorbidities and ability to perform activities of daily living 
(Supplementary Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Choice of treatment for basal and squamous cell skin cancer should be influenced, at least in 
part, by patient life expectancy because KC is a non-fatal disease where the risks of intensive 
treatment may outweigh the benefits in some patients who have few years to live. In this 
nationally representative study of older Americans, we found that choices among types of 
KC treatments were not influenced by individual prognostic characteristics. In particular, 
patient life expectancy whether measured by advanced age, severe medical comorbidities or 
impaired functional status, does not seem to influence treatment choice, including the rates 
of Mohs surgery. We noted similar rates of Mohs surgery and higher rates of excision in 
patients who ultimately died within 1 year of treatment compared to those who lived longer. 
Together, these findings suggest that currently skin cancer treatment choice may not be 
tailored to the life expectancy and functional status of individual patients.
These findings build on our prior single-city study showing that treatment choice was not 
influenced by patient life expectancy even after adjusting for tumor characteristics 
(histology, location, degree of invasiveness). In our prior study, we found that most patients 
are not often bothered by their tumors (72%),(6) fewer than 5% of these tumors recur 
regardless of treatment type(3) and many patients die of unrelated causes within 5 years 
(43%), while no patients died of KC.(6) Meanwhile, a significant proportion of patients 
report a problem after treatment procedures (27%).(6)

 We acknowledge that there are selected circumstances in which a KC should be treated 
aggressively, even in patients with limited life expectancy. In some cases, a KC can cause 
cosmetic distress or symptoms or ulcerate. Even is such a KC does not impact life 
expectancy, whichever treatment best treats the symptoms is indicated. Our claims data did 
not have information on symptoms, and therefore, some of the Moh’s resections may have 
been indicated, even in those with limited life expectancy. However, prior research 
demonstrates that the majority of KCs cause no symptoms, and in this case, treatments that 
are the least burdensome to the patient should be given special consideration.
A major limitation of this study is that we only included skin cancers that were treated by a 
procedure; since our sample was defined by Medicare procedure codes. Therefore untreated 
tumors, and tumors treated by topical therapies (e.g. Imiquimod) or radiotherapy are not 
included. Because our dataset did not include untreated tumors, these findings pertain to 
decision making after a decision to treat a tumor—they do not deal with the decision to treat 
itself. However, based on other studies, the proportion of untreated tumors in the US is likely 
very small (20) (11)and imiquimod and radiotherapy were very rare modes of treatment in 
the years studied. While we show that limited life expectancy is not associated with 
treatment decisions, a limitation of this study is that we could not assess whether the 
treatments offered were appropriate. It is possible invasive procedures were appropriate, 
even at the end of life, because they were used on medically dangerous or symptomatic 
tumors. We did not have information on many factors that may have influenced treatment 
choices including tumor histology, location or size. We also did not have information on 
patient preferences, and it is possible that some elderly patients would have requested more 
intensive treatment options for their BCCs. Furthermore, we only evaluated procedures for 
KC and not the more recent topical treatments including Imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil. Our 
KC selection criteria relied on procedure codes, and therefore would not capture untreated 
tumors, although we expect this is a very small proportion of KCs.(11) We also did not have 
information on the specialties of physicians treating these tumors.
Despite these limitations, the main advantage of this study is that it includes nationally 
representative data spanning 16 years. Taken together with our prior cohort study, which did 
include detailed information on tumor and individual patient characteristics(11) including 
bother we likely have an accurate picture of US patterns of skin cancer treatment in patients 
with differing life expectancies. Determining appropriate care of non-fatal conditions for 
patients with limited life expectancy is challenging.(21) For example, rates of prostate 
cancer screening in patients with limited life expectancy are probably excessive, given the 
known risks of screening and limited benefits of treatment.(22, 23) Similarly, a significant 
proportion of patients with metastatic cancer receive routine screening tests that are unlikely 
to provide any benefit.(24) A study of Medicare beneficiaries showed that over 30% of 
patients underwent surgery in the last year of life.(25) Our study adds to the growing 
argument for prudent use of procedures toward the end of life.
Conclusion
In conclusion, choice of treatment for basal and squamous cell skin cancer is unaffected by 
many patient characteristics including advanced age, functional status, medical

 comorbidities or patient life expectancy. A more individualized approach to skin cancer 
treatment may be preferred and provide more optimal care for frail elderly patients. 
Although it is impossible to predict any individual’s precise life expectancy, and advanced 
age alone should not dictate or restrict treatment options as life expectancy varies 
tremendously among those of similar age, it is possible that some patients would chose less 
invasive treatments if they were given all relevant information. It is also possible that 
physicians would make different recommendations if they had more guidance (including 
decision tools or evidence based guidelines) on this topic. We hope that this study will add to 
the debate about optimal treatment decisions at the end of life.
