Introduction
Cancer patients often develop a chronic, clinically significant syn-
drome of psychosocial distress having depressed mood, anxiety, 
and reduced quality of life as core features, with up to 40% of 
cancer patients meeting criteria for a mood disorder (Holland 
et al., 2013; Mitchell et al., 2011). In cancer patients, depression 
and anxiety have been associated with decreased treatment adher-
ence (Arrieta et al., 2013; Colleoni et al., 2000), prolonged hospi-
talization (Prieto et al., 2002), decreased quality of life (Arrieta 
et al., 2013; Skarstein et al., 2000), and increased suicidality 
(Shim and Park, 2012). Depression is an independent risk factor 
of early death in cancer patients (Arrieta et al., 2013; Pinquart and 
Duberstein, 2010). Antidepressants and, less frequently, benzodi-
azepines are used to treat depressed mood and anxiety in cancer 
patients, although evidence suggesting efficacy is limited and 
conflicting, and benzodiazepines are generally only recommended 
for short-term use because of side effects and withdrawal (Grassi 
et al., 2014; Ostuzzi et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2014). Although 
psychological approaches have shown only small to medium 
effects in treating emotional distress and quality of life, with low 
quality of reporting in many trials (Faller et al., 2013), there are 
several promising interventions utilizing existential orientations 
to psychotherapy (Breitbart et al., 2015; Spiegel, 2015).
The classic hallucinogens, which include psilocybin (psilocin) 
and (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are a structurally 
diverse group of compounds that are 5-HT2A receptor agonists and 
produce a unique profile of changes in thoughts, perceptions, and 
emotions (Halberstadt, 2015; Nichols, 2016). Several unblinded 
studies in the 1960s and 70s suggested that such compounds 
might be effective in treating psychological distress in cancer 
patients (Grof et al., 1973; Kast, 1967; Richards et al., 1977); 
however, these studies did not include the comparison conditions 
that would be expected of modern psychopharmacology trials.
Psilocybin produces substantial and  
sustained decreases in depression and

Abstract
Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease 
depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of 
depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) 
vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. 
Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, 
and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and 
anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were 
sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed 
improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or 
greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on 
session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

Subsequently, human research with these compounds was 
halted for almost three decades because of safety and other con-
cerns raised in response to widespread non-medical use in the 
1960s. Recent resumption of clinical research with these com-
pounds has established conditions for safe administration 
(Johnson et al., 2008; Studerus et al., 2011).
Two recent double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with 
the classic hallucinogens psilocybin (Grob et al., 2011) and 
LSD (Gasser et al., 2014) examined effects in 12 patients with 
life-threatening illness, including cancer. Both studies showed 
promising trends toward decreased psychological distress. Of 
most relevance to the present study with psilocybin, Grob and 
colleagues showed that a low-moderate dose of psilocybin (14 
mg/70 kg) decreased a measure of trait anxiety at 1 and 3 
months and depressed mood at 6-month follow-up. Also rele-
vant, a recent open-label pilot study in 12 patients with treat-
ment-resistant depression showed marked reductions in 
depressive symptoms 1 week and 3 months after administration 
of 10 and 25 mg of psilocybin in two sessions separated by 7 
days (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016).
The present study provides the most rigorous evaluation to 
date of the efficacy of a classic hallucinogen for treatment of 
depressed mood and anxiety in psychologically distressed cancer 
patients. The study evaluated a range of clinically relevant meas-
ures using a double-blind cross-over design to compare a very 
low psilocybin dose (intended as a placebo) to a moderately high 
psilocybin dose in 51 patients under conditions that minimized 
expectancy effects.
Methods
Study participants
Participants with a potentially life-threatening cancer diagnosis 
and a DSM-IV diagnosis that included anxiety and/or mood symp-
toms were recruited through flyers, internet, and physician referral. 
Of 566 individuals who were screened by telephone, 56 were ran-
domized. Figure 1 shows a CONSORT flow diagram. Table 1 
shows demographics for the 51 participants who completed at least 
one session. The two randomized groups did not significantly dif-
fer demographically. All 51 participants had a potentially life-
threatening cancer diagnosis, with 65% having recurrent or 
metastatic disease. Types of cancer included breast (13 partici-
pants), upper aerodigestive (7), gastrointestinal (4), genitourinary 
(18), hematologic malignancies (8), other (1). All had a DSM-IV 
diagnosis: chronic adjustment disorder with anxiety (11 partici-
pants), chronic adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and 
depressed mood (11), dysthymic disorder (5), generalized anxiety 
disorder (GAD) (5), major depressive disorder (MDD) (14), or a 
dual diagnosis of GAD and MDD (4), or GAD and dysthymic dis-
order (1). Detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria are in the online 
Supplementary material. The Johns Hopkins IRB approved the 
study. Written informed consent was obtained from participants.
Study design and overview
A two-session, double-blind cross-over design compared the 
effects of a low versus high psilocybin dose on measures of 
depressed mood, anxiety, and quality of life, as well as meas-
ures of short-term and enduring changes in attitudes and 
behavior. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two 
groups. The Low-Dose-1st Group received the low dose of 
psilocybin on the first session and the high dose on the second 
session, whereas the High-Dose-1st Group received the high 
dose on the first session and the low dose on the second ses-
sion. The duration of each participant’s participation was 
approximately 9 months (mean 275 days). Psilocybin session 1 
occurred, on average, approximately 1 month after study 
enrollment (mean 28 days), with session 2 occurring approxi-
mately 5 weeks later (mean 38 days). Data assessments 
occurred: (1) immediately after study enrollment (Baseline 
assessment); (2) on both session days (during and at the end of 
the session); (3) approximately 5 weeks (mean 37 days) after 
each session (Post-session 1 and Post-session 2 assessments); 
(4) approximately 6 months (mean 211 days) after Session 2 
(6-month follow-up).
Interventions
Meetings with session monitors. After study enrollment and 
assessment of baseline measures, and before the first psilocybin 
session, each participant met with the two session monitors 
(staff who would be present during session days) on two or more 
occasions (mean of 3.0 occasions for a mean total of 7.9 hours). 
The day after each psilocybin session participants met with the 
session monitors (mean 1.2 hours). Participants met with moni-
tors on two or more occasions between the first and second psi-
locybin session (mean of 2.7 occasions for a mean total of 3.4 
hours) and on two or more occasions between the second session 
and 6-month follow-up (mean of 2.5 occasions for a mean total 
of 2.4 hours). Preparation meetings, the first meeting following 
each session, and the last meeting before the second session 
were always in person. For the 37 participants (73%) who did 
not reside within commuting distance of the research facility, 
49% of the Post-session 1 meetings with monitors occurred via 
telephone or video calls.
A description of session monitor roles and the content and 
rationale for meetings between participants and monitors is pro-
vided elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2008). Briefly, preparation meet-
ings before the first session, which included discussion of 
meaningful aspects of the participant’s life, served to establish 
rapport and prepare the participant for the psilocybin sessions. 
During sessions, monitors were nondirective and supportive, and 
they encouraged participants to “trust, let go and be open” to the 
experience. Meetings after sessions generally focused on novel 
thoughts and feelings that arose during sessions. Session moni-
tors were study staff originally trained by William Richards PhD, 
a clinical psychologist with extensive experience conducting 
studies with classic hallucinogens. Monitor education varied 
from college graduate to PhD. Formal clinical training varied 
from none to clinical psychologist. Monitors were selected as 
having significant human relations skills and self-described 
experience with altered states of consciousness induced by means 
such as meditation, yogic breathing, or relaxation techniques.
Psilocybin sessions. Drug sessions were conducted in an aes-
thetic living-room-like environment with two monitors present. 
Participants were instructed to consume a low-fat breakfast 
before coming to the research unit. A urine sample was taken to 
verify abstinence from common drugs of abuse (cocaine, ben-
zodiazepines, and opioids including methadone). Participants 
who reported use of cannabis or dronabinol were instructed not

to use for at least 24 h before sessions. Psilocybin doses were 
administered in identically appearing opaque, size 0 gelatin 
capsules, with lactose as the inactive capsule filler. For most of 
the time during the session, participants were encouraged to lie 
down on the couch, use an eye mask to block external visual 
distraction, and use headphones through which a music pro-
gram was played. The same music program was played for all 
participants in both sessions. Participants were encouraged to 
focus their attention on their inner experiences throughout the 
session. Thus, there was no explicit instruction for participants 
to focus on their attitudes, ideas, or emotions related to their 
cancer. A more detailed description of the study room and 
procedures followed on session days is provided elsewhere 
(Griffiths et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2008).
Instructions to participants and monitors to facilitate dose 
condition blinding and minimize expectancy effects. Expec-
tancies, on part of both participants and monitors, are believed to 
play a large role in the qualitative effects of psilocybin-like drugs 
(Griffiths et al., 2006; Metzner et al., 1965). Although double-
blind methods are usually used to protect against such effects, 
expectancy is likely to be significantly operative in a standard 
drug versus placebo design when the drug being evaluated pro-
duces highly discriminable effects and participants and staff

know the specific drug conditions to be tested. For these reasons, 
in the present study a low dose of psilocybin was compared with 
a high dose of psilocybin, and participants and monitors were 
given instructions that obscured the actual dose conditions to be 
tested. Specifically, they were told that psilocybin would be 
administered in both sessions, the psilocybin doses administered 
in the two sessions might range anywhere from very low to high, 
the doses in the two sessions might or might not be the same, 
sensitivity to psilocybin dose varies widely across individuals, 
and that at least one dose would be moderate to high. Participants 
and monitors were further strongly encouraged to try to attain 
maximal therapeutic and personal benefit from each session.
Dose conditions. The study compared a high psilocybin dose 
(22 or 30 mg/70 kg) with a low dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) adminis-
tered in identically appearing capsules. When this study was 
designed, we had little past experience with a range of psilocybin 
doses. We decreased the high dose from 30 to 22 mg/70 kg after 
two of the first three participants who received a high dose of 
 
30 mg/70 kg were discontinued from the study (one from 
 
vomiting shortly after capsule administration and one for 
personal reasons). Related to this decision, preliminary data from 
a dose-effect study in healthy participants suggested that rates of 
psychologically challenging experiences were substantially 
greater at 30 than at 20 mg/70 kg (Griffiths et al., 2011). The low 
dose of psilocybin was decreased from 3 to 1 mg/70 kg after 12 
participants because data from the same dose-effect study showed 
significant psilocybin effects at 5 mg/70 kg, which raised con-
cern that 3 mg/70 kg might not serve as an inactive placebo.
Outcome measures
Cardiovascular measures and monitor ratings assessed 
throughout the session. Ten minutes before and 30, 60, 90, 
120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min after capsule administration, 
blood pressure, heart rate, and monitor ratings were obtained as 
described previously (Griffiths et al., 2006). The two session 
monitors completed the Monitor Rating Questionnaire, which 
involved rating or scoring several dimensions of the participant’s 
behavior or mood. The dimensions, which are expressed as peak 
scores in Table 2, were rated on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4. Data 
were the mean of the two monitor ratings at each time-point.

Psychiatric symptom classification was based on SCID (DSM-IV) diagnoses. All had a DSM-IV diagnosis: chronic adjustment disorder with anxiety (11 participants), 
chronic adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (11), dysthymic disorder (5), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (5), major depressive disorder 
(MDD) (14), or a duel diagnosis of GAD and MDD (4), or GAD and dysthymic disorder (1). Depressed mood was defined as meeting criteria for MDD, dysthymic disorder, or 
adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood, chronic. Anxiety was defined as meeting criteria for GAD, adjustment disorder with anxiety, chronic, or adjustment 
disorder with anxiety and depressed mood, chronic.

Subjective drug effect measures assessed 7 h after psilocy-
bin administration. When psilocybin effects had subsided, 
participants completed four questionnaires: Hallucinogen Rating 
Scale (HRS) (Strassman et al., 1994); 5-Dimension Altered 
States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) (Dittrich, 1998); Mysticism 
Scale (Experience-specific 9-point scale) (Hood et al., 2001, 
2009); and the States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ) 
(Griffiths et al., 2006). Thirty items on the SOCQ comprise the 
Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30), which was shown 
sensitive to mystical-type subjective effects of psilocybin in lab-
oratory studies as well as survey studies of recreational use of 
psilocybin mushrooms (Barrett et al., 2015; MacLean et al., 
2012). Four factor scores (Mystical, Positive mood, Transcen-
dence of time and space, and Ineffability) and a mean total score 
(the mean of all 30 items) were assessed.
Therapeutically relevant measures assessed at Baseline, 5 
weeks after each session, and 6-month follow-up. Seven-
teen measures focused on mood states, attitudes, disposition, and 
behaviors thought to be therapeutically relevant in psychologi-
cally distressed cancer patients were assessed at four time-points 
over the study: immediately after study enrollment (Baseline 
assessment), about 5 weeks (mean 37 days) after each session 
(Post-session 1 and 2 assessments), and about 6 months (mean 
211 days) after session 2 (6-month follow-up).
The two primary therapeutic outcome measures were 
 
the widely used clinician-rated measures of depression, GRID-
HAM-D-17 (ISCDD, 2003) and anxiety, HAM-A assessed with 
the SIGH-A (Shear et al., 2001). For these clinician-rated meas-
ures, a clinically significant response was defined as ⩾50% 
decrease in measure relative to Baseline; symptom remission was 
defined as ⩾50% decrease in measure relative to Baseline and a 
score of ⩽7 on the GRID-HAMD or HAM-A (Gao et al., 2014; 
Matza et al., 2010).
Fifteen secondary measures focused on psychiatric symp-
toms, moods, and attitudes: BDI, self-rated depression meas-
ure (Beck and Steer, 1987); HADS, self-rated separate 
measures of depression and anxiety, and a total score (Zigmond 
and Snaith, 1983); STAI, self-rated measure of state and trait 
anxiety separately (Spielberger, 1983); POMS, Total Mood 
Disturbance Subscale, self-rated dysphoric mood measure 
(McNair et al., 1992); BSI, self-rated psychiatric symptoms 
(Derogatis, 1992); MQOL, self-rated measure of overall qual-
ity of life (total score) and meaningful existence (existential 
subscale) during life-threatening illness (Cohen et al., 1995); 
LOT-R, self-rated optimism measure associated with illness 
(Scheier and Carver, 1985); LAP-R Death Acceptance, self-
rated scale assessing absence of anxiety about death (Reker, 
1992); Death Transcendence Scale, self-rated measure of posi-
tive attitudes about death (VandeCreek, 1999); Purpose in Life 
Test, self-rated measure of life meaningfulness (McIntosh, 
1999); and LAP-R Coherence, self-rated scale assessing logi-
cally integrated understanding of self, others, and life in gen-
eral (Reker, 1992).
Community observer-rated changes in participant behavior 
and attitudes assessed at Baseline, 5 weeks after Session 2, 
and 6-month follow-up. Structured telephone interviews with 
community observers (e.g. family members, friends, or work col-
leagues) provided ratings of participant attitudes and behavior 
reflecting healthy psychosocial functioning (Griffiths et al., 2011). 
The interviewer provided no information to the rater about the 
participant or the nature of the research study. The structured 
interview (Community Observer Questionnaire) consisted of ask-
ing the rater to rate the participant’s behavior and attitudes using a 
10-point scale (from 1 = not at all, to 10 = extremely) on 13 items 
reflecting healthy psychosocial functioning: inner peace; patience; 
good-natured humor/playfulness; mental flexibility; optimism; 
anxiety (scored negatively); interpersonal perceptiveness and 
 
caring; negative expression of anger (scored negatively); com-
passion/social concern; expression of positive emotions (e.g. joy, 
love, appreciation); self-confidence; forgiveness of others; and 
forgiveness of self. On the first rating occasion, which occurred 
soon after acceptance into the study, raters were instructed to base 
their ratings on observations of and conversations with the partici-
pant over the past 3 months. On two subsequent assessments, rat-
ers were told their previous ratings and were instructed to rate the 
participant based on interactions over the last month (post-session 
2 assessment) or since beginning in the study (6-month follow-
up). Data from each interview with each rater were calculated as a 
total score. Changes in each participant’s behavior and attitudes 
after drug sessions were expressed as a mean change score (i.e. 
difference score) from the baseline rating across the raters. Of 438 
scheduled ratings by community observers, 25 (<6%) were missed 
due to failure to return calls or to the rater not having contact with 
the participant over the rating period.

Spirituality measures assessed at Baseline, 5 weeks after 
Session 2, and 6-month follow-up. Three measures of spiritu-
ality were assessed at three time-points: Baseline, 5 weeks after 
session 2, and at the 6-month follow-up: FACIT-Sp, a self-rated 
measure of the spiritual dimension of quality of life in chronic 
illness (Peterman et al., 2002) assessed on how the participant 
felt “on average”; Spiritual-Religious Outcome Scale, a three-
item measure used to assess spiritual and religious changes dur-
ing illness (Pargament et al., 2004); and Faith Maturity Scale, a

and perspectives align with “mainline” Protestant traditions

Persisting effects of the psilocybin session assessed 5 weeks 
after each session and 6-month follow-up. The Persisting 
Effects Questionnaire assessed self-rated positive and negative 
changes in attitudes, moods, behavior, and spiritual experience 
attributed to the most recent psilocybin session (Griffiths et al., 
2006, 2011). At the 6-month follow-up, the questionnaire was 
completed on the basis of the high-dose session, which was iden-
tified as the session in which the participant experienced the most 
pronounced changes in their ordinary mental processes. Twelve 
subscales (described in Table 8) were scored.
The questionnaire included three final questions (see Griffiths 
et al. 2006 for more specific wording): (1) How personally mean-
ingful was the experience? (rated from 1 to 8, with 1 = no more 
than routine, everyday experiences; 7 = among the five most 
meaningful experiences of my life; and 8 = the single most mean-
ingful experience of my life). (2) Indicate the degree to which the 
experience was spiritually significant to you? (rated from 1 to 6, 
with 1 = not at all; 5 = among the five most spiritually significant 
experiences of my life; 6 = the single most spiritually significant 
experience of my life). (3) Do you believe that the experience and 
your contemplation of that experience have led to change in your 
current sense of personal well-being or life satisfaction? (rated 
from +3 = increased very much; +2 = increased moderately; 0 = 
no change; –3 = decreased very much).
Statistical analysis
Differences in demographic data between the two dose sequence 
groups were examined with t-tests and chi-square tests with con-
tinuous and categorical variables, respectively.
Data analyses were conducted to demonstrate the appropriate-
ness of combining data for the 1 and 3 mg/70 kg doses in the 
low-dose condition and for including data for the one participant 
who received 30 mg/70 kg. To determine if the two different 
psilocybin doses differed in the low-dose condition, t-tests were 
used to compare participants who received 3 mg/70 kg (n = 12) 
with those who received 1 mg/70 kg (n = 38) on participant rat-
ings of peak intensity of effect (HRS intensity item completed 7 
h after administration) and peak monitor ratings of overall drug 
effect across the session. Because neither of these were signifi-
cantly different, data from the 1 and 3 mg/70 kg doses were com-
bined in the low-dose condition for all analyses.
Of the 50 participants who completed the high-dose condi-
tion, one received 30 mg/70 kg and 49 received 22 mg/70 kg. 
 
To determine if inclusion of the data from the one participant 
who received 30 mg/70 kg affected conclusions about the most 
therapeutically relevant outcome measures, the analyses for the 
17 measures shown in Tables 4 and 5 were conducted with and 
without that participant. Because there were few differences in 
significance (72 of 75 tests remained the same), that participant’s 
data were included in all the analyses.
To examine acute drug effects from sessions, the drug dose 
conditions were collapsed across the two dose sequence groups. 
The appropriateness of this approach was supported by an 
absence of any significant group effects and any group-by-dose 
interactions on the cardiovascular measures (peak systolic and 
diastolic pressures and heart rate) and on several key monitor- 
and participant-rated measures: peak monitor ratings of drug 
strength and joy/intense happiness, and end-of-session partici-
pant ratings on the Mysticism Scale.
Six participants reported initiating medication treatment with 
an anxiolytic (2 participants), antidepressant (3), or both (1) 
between the Post-session 2 and the 6-month follow-up assess-
ments. To determine if inclusion of these participants affected 
statistical outcomes in the analyses of the 6-month assessment, 
the analyses summarized in Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were con-
ducted with and without these six participants. All statistical out-
comes remained identical. Thus, data from these six participants 
were retained in the data analyses.
For cardiovascular measures and monitor ratings assessed 
repeatedly during sessions, repeated measures regressions were 
conducted in SAS PROC MIXED using an AR(1) covariance 
structure and fixed effects of dose and time. Planned comparison 
t-tests were used to assess differences between the high- and low-
dose condition at each time-point.
Peak scores for cardiovascular measures and monitor ratings 
during sessions were defined as the maximum value from pre-
capsule to 6 h post-capsule. These peak scores and the end-of-
session ratings (Tables 2 and 3) were analyzed using repeated 
measures regressions in SAS PROC MIXED with a CS covari-
ance structure and fixed effects of group and dose.
For the analyses of continuous measures described below, 
repeated measures regressions were conducted in SAS PROC 
MIXED using an AR(1) covariance structure and fixed effects of 
group and time. Planned comparison t-tests (specified below) 
from these analyses are reported. For dichotomous measures, 
Friedman’s Test was conducted in SPSS for both the overall anal-
ysis and planned comparisons as specified below. All results are 
expressed as unadjusted scores.
For the measures that were assessed in the two dose sequence 
groups at Baseline, Post-session 1, Post-session 2, and 6 months 
(Tables 4 and 5), the following planned comparisons most rele-
vant to examining the effects of psilocybin dose were conducted: 
Between-group comparisons at Baseline, Post 1, and Post 2; and 
within-group comparisons of Baseline versus Post 1 in both dose 
sequence groups, and Post 1 versus Post 2 in the Low-Dose-1st 
(High-Dose-2nd) Group. A planned comparison between 
Baseline and 6 months collapsed across groups was also con-
ducted. Effects sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d.
For measures assessed only at Baseline, Post 2, and 6 months 
(Table 7), between-group planned comparisons were conducted 
at Baseline, Post 2, and 6 months. Because measures assessed 
only at these time-points cannot provide information about the 
psilocybin dose, data were collapsed across the two dose 
sequence groups and planned comparisons were conducted com-
paring Baseline with Post 2 and Baseline with 6 months.
 Griffiths et al. 
1187
For participant ratings of persisting effects attributed to the 
session (e.g. Table 8), planned comparisons for continuous and 
dichotomous measures were conducted between: (1) ratings at 5 
weeks after the low versus high-dose sessions; (2) ratings of low 
dose at 5 weeks versus ratings of high dose at the 6-month fol-
low-up; (3) ratings of high dose at 5 weeks versus ratings of high 
dose at the 6-month follow-up.
As described above, clinician-rated measures of depression 
(GRID-HAMD) and anxiety (HAM-A) were analyzed as continu-
ous measures. In addition for both measures, a clinically significant 
response was defined as ⩾50% decrease in measure relative to 
Baseline; symptom remission was defined as ⩾50% decrease in 
measure relative to Baseline and a score of ⩽7. Planned compari-
sons were conducted via independent z-tests of proportions between 
the two dose sequence groups at Post-session 1, Post-session 2, and 
6 months. To determine if effects were sustained at 6 months, 
planned comparisons were also conducted via dependent z-tests of 
proportions between Post-session 2 versus 6 months in the Low-
Dose-1st (High-Dose-2nd) Group, and between Post-session 1 ver-
sus 6 months in the High-Dose-1st (Low-Dose-2nd) Group.
Exploratory analyses used Pearson’s correlations to examine 
the relationship between total scores on the Mystical Experience 
Questionnaire (MEQ30) assessed at the end of session 1 and 
enduring effects assessed 5 weeks after session 1. The Post-
session 1 measures were ratings on three items from the Persisting 
Effects Questionnaire (meaningfulness, spiritual significance, 
and life satisfaction) and 17 therapeutically relevant measures 
assessed at Baseline and Post 1 (Tables 4 and 5) expressed as dif-
ference from baseline scores. Significant relationships were fur-
ther examined using partial correlations to control for 
end-of-session participant-rated “Intensity” (item 98 from the 
HRS). To examine MEQ30 scores as a mediator of the effect of 
psilocybin dose on therapeutic effects, a bootstrap analysis was 
done using the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013) in SPSS. 
Bootstrapping is a non-parametric method appropriate for small 
samples, which was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals 
for the mediation effect. The PROCESS macro also calculated 
direct effects on outcome for both group effects and MEQ30.
Results
Adverse effects
No serious adverse events attributed to psilocybin administration 
occurred. A number of adverse events occurred during psilocybin 
sessions, none of which were deemed to be serious. Except as 
noted below, all of these adverse events had resolved fully by the 
end of the sessions. Consistent with previous research (Griffiths 
et al., 2006, 2011), there were transient moderate increases in 
systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after psilocybin. In this 
study, an episode of elevated systolic blood pressure (>160 mm 
Hg at one or more time-point) occurred in 34% of participants in 
the high-dose session and 17% of participants in the low-dose 
session. An episode of elevated diastolic blood pressure (>100 
mm Hg at one or more time-point) occurred in 13% of partici-
pants in the high-dose session and 2% of participants in the low-
dose session. None of these episodes met criteria for medical 
intervention. Nausea or vomiting occurred in 15% of participants 
in the high-dose session and none in the low-dose session. An 
episode of physical discomfort (any type) occurred in 21% of 
participants in the high-dose session and 8% in the low-dose ses-
sion. Also consistent with previous research (Griffiths et al., 
2006, 2011), transient episodes of psychological distress during 
psilocybin sessions (as rated by session monitors) were more 
common after the high dose than the low dose. Psychological 
discomfort (any type) occurred in 32% of participants in the 
high-dose session and 12% in the low-dose session. An episode 
of anxiety occurred in 26% of participants in the high-dose 
 
session and 15% in the low-dose session. One participant had 
 
a transient episode of paranoid ideation (2% of high-dose ses-
sions). There were no cases of hallucinogen persisting perception 
disorder or prolonged psychosis. One participant reported mild 
headache starting toward the end of the high-dose session and 
lasting until 9 p.m. that evening. Of the 11 participants for whom 
headache was assessed on the day after sessions, two reported a 
delayed moderate headache after the high-dose session.
Integrity of blinding procedures
After all psilocybin sessions had been completed, the eight study 
staff members who had served as primary monitors or as assistant 
monitors for four or more participants completed a questionnaire 
Table 3. Participant ratings on questionnaires completed 7 hours after 
psilocybin administration+.

that asked about their understanding of the experimental design. 
Although all correctly believed that psilocybin had been admin-
istered, five of eight made incorrect inferences about the study 
design or procedures, including possible administration of three 
or more dose levels of psilocybin across different participants 
(four monitors), an inactive placebo (one monitor), other psycho-
active compounds such as dextromethorphan (one monitor), or 
only low psilocybin doses (one monitor).
At the end of each session day, monitors rated their guess of the 
magnitude of drug dose administered in the capsule that day on a 
10 cm line. Although, as expected, the mean (±SE) monitor rating 
of the dose magnitude of the high psilocybin dose was signifi-
cantly larger than the low dose (7.0±0.29 vs. 1.7±0.21, p<0.001, 
planned comparison), the distributions of ratings overlapped, with 
more than 13% of the high-dose sessions being rated as 4 or less 
and more than 12% of the low-dose sessions being rated as 4 or 
more. Overall, we conclude that the blinding procedures provided 
some protection against a priori monitor expectancy strongly 
determining outcomes of the psilocybin dose manipulation.
Outcome measures
Psilocybin produced orderly dose- and time-related increases on 
blood pressure, heart rate, and all 16 monitor-rated dimensions of the 
participant’s behavior or mood assessed throughout sessions, with a 
generally similar time-course in both dose conditions (see Figure 2 
for illustrative time-course measures). Significant differences 
between the dose conditions generally first occurred at 30- or 
60-min, with the high dose usually showing peak effects from 90–
180 min and decreasing toward pre-drug levels over the remainder 
of the session. Table 2 shows mean peak effects for these measures.
End-of-session measures that assessed subjective experiences 
during the session were significantly greater after the high than 
the low dose (Table 3).

Post-session 2 (5 weeks after Session 2), and 6 months follow-up that fulfilled conservative criteria for demonstrating an effect of psilocybin+.

Group. Table 4 shows data for the 11 measures that fulfilled these 
criteria and Figure 3 shows results graphically for nine of these 
measures. For the 11 measures, the mean effect size (Cohen’s d) 
for the between-group difference at the Post-session 1 assess-
ment was 0.82, for the within-group difference between Post-
session 1 and Post-session 2 in the Low-Dose-1st Group was 
0.66, and, for both groups combined, the difference between 
Baseline and 6 months was 1.55 (see Table 4 footnotes).
Table 5 presents results from six therapeutically relevant out-
come measures that did not fulfill conservative criteria for dem-
onstrating an effect of psilocybin. Although none of the measures 
showed a significant difference between groups at Post-session 1, 
five of the six showed a significant difference between Post-
session 1 and Post-session 2 in the Low-Dose-1st (High-Dose-
2nd) Group, and all six measures showed large significant 
changes in a therapeutically relevant direction (decreases in neg-
ative affect and increases in positive attitudes about death and life 
meaning and coherence) from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up 
(mean effect size 1.35).
Rates of clinically significant response and symptom remis-
sion for the two primary outcome measures of clinician-rated 
symptoms of depression (GRID-HAMD-17) and anxiety (HAM-
A) showed large effects of psilocybin that were sustained at 6 
months (Table 6, Figure 4). For instance, 5 weeks after Session 1, 
92% of participants in the High-Dose-1st Group showed a clini-
cally significant response (i.e. ⩾50% decrease relative to 
Baseline) on the GRID-HAMD-17 compared with a 32% 
response rate in the Low-Dose-1st Group. At 6 months 79% of 
those in the High-Dose-1st Group continued to show a clinically 
significant response. Likewise, these percentages for the HAM-A 
were 76% and 24%, respectively, for the High-Dose 1st Group 
and Low-Dose-1st Group 5 weeks after Session 1, and 83% for 
the High-Dose-1st at 6 months. An analogous pattern of results 
was shown for symptom remission to normal range (i.e. ⩾50% 
decrease relative to Baseline and a score of ⩽7 on GRID-
HAMD-17 or HAM-A), with rates of symptom remission of 60% 
and 52% for depression and anxiety, respectively, 5 weeks after 
the high psilocybin dose in Session 1, and with rates of 71% and 
63%, respectively, sustained at 6 months. Collapsing across the 
two dose sequence groups, the overall rate of clinical response at 
6 months was 78% and 83% for depression and anxiety, respec-
tively, and the overall rate of symptom remission at 6 months for 
all participants was 65% and 57%, respectively.
Community observer ratings showed significant positive 
changes in participants’ attitudes and behavior at the two post-
psilocybin assessment time-points (Table 7). All three measures 
of spirituality showed similar increases (Table 7). As with the 
measures shown in Table 4, these measures show significant

changes in the expected directions at Post-session 2 that were 
generally sustained at the 6-month follow-up.
Table 8 shows participant ratings of persisting effects attrib-
uted to the session experiences rated 5 weeks after the low- and 
high-dose psilocybin sessions, and, again, for the high-dose ses-
sion at the 6-month follow-up. The high dose produced signifi-
cantly greater ratings of positive persisting effects on attitudes 
about life and self, mood changes, social effects, behavior, and 
spirituality. These effects were sustained at 6-month follow-up. 
Negative ratings of these dimensions were low and not signifi-
cantly different between conditions. The high-dose experiences 
were rated as producing significantly greater personal meaning, 
spiritual significance and increased well-being or life satisfac-
tion, with differences sustained at 6 months.

Mystical experience scores (MEQ30) assessed at the end of 
Session 1 correlated significantly with 18 of 20 measures assessed 
5 weeks after the session: ratings of meaningfulness (r = 0.77), 
spiritual significance (r = 0.75), increased life satisfaction (r = 
0.53), GRID-HAMD (r = −0.41), BDI (r = −0.30), HADS 
Depression (r = −0.36), HADS Total (r = −0.41), HADS 
Anxiety (r = −0.34), HAM-A (r = −0.59), STAI-Trait Anxiety (r 
= −0.31), POMS Total Mood Disturbance (r = −0.35) BSI (r = 
−0.38), MQOL (r = 0.32), MQOF-meaningful existence (r = 
0.41), LAP-R Death Acceptance (r = 0.38), Death Transcendence 
Scale (r = 0.31), Purpose in Life (r = 0.29), LAP-R Coherence (r 
= 0.41). Figure 5 shows some of these effects. To further examine 
the contribution of mystical experience to these outcome meas-
ures, partial correlations were conducted to control for the partic-
ipant-rated intensity of drug effect, which, like mystical 
experience, was assessed at the end of the session. This analysis 
continued to show significant effects of mystical experience on 
11 of these 18 measures (meaningfulness, spiritual significance, 
life satisfaction, GRID-HAMD, HADS Depression, HADS 
Total, HADS Anxiety, HAM-A, BSI, MQOL-meaningful exist-
ence and LAP-R Coherence). Finally, a mediation analysis 
showed that MEQ30 score was a significant mediator of the 
effect of psilocybin dose on seven of these outcome measures. 
Point estimates and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals 
 
for the indirect effects of the mediation analysis were: meaning-
fulness (1.43 [0.72–2.44]), spiritual significance (1.19 [0.59–
2.10]), life satisfaction (0.60 [0.218–1.19]), HADS Anxiety 
(−1.50 [−3.50 to −0.33]), HADS Depression (−1.11 [−2.79 to 
−0.02]), HADS Total (−2.62 [−5.74 to −0.72]), and HAM-A 
(−3.93 [−7.88 to −1.52]).
Discussion
The present study demonstrated the efficacy of a high dose of 
psilocybin administered under supportive conditions to decrease 
symptoms of depressed mood and anxiety, and to increase quality 
of life in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. Eleven 
of 17 therapeutically relevant measures fulfilled conservative cri-
teria for demonstrating efficacy of the high dose of psilocybin 
(Table 4, Figure 3). The data show that psilocybin produced large 
and significant decreases in clinician-rated and self-rated meas-
ures of depression, anxiety or mood disturbance, and increases in 
Figure 5. Relationship between the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) total score assessed at end of Session 1 and several illustrative 
outcome measures assessed 5 weeks after Session 1.
Each panel shows scores on an outcome measure assessed 5 weeks after Session 1 as a function of the total MEQ30 score obtained 7 h after psilocybin administration on 
Session 1. MEQ30 scores are expressed as a percentage of maximum possible score. Data points represent individual participants (n = 50 or 51); blue circles represent the 
group that received the low dose on the 1st session; red squares represent the group that received the high dose on the 1st session. Correlation coefficients and p-values

measures of quality of life, life meaning, death acceptance, and 
optimism. These effects were sustained at 6 months. For the cli-
nician-rated measures of depression and anxiety, respectively, the 
overall rate of clinical response at 6 months was 78% and 83% 
and the overall rate of symptom remission was 65% and 57%. 
Participants attributed to the high-dose experience positive 
changes in attitudes about life, self, mood, relationships and spir-
ituality, with over 80% endorsing moderately or higher increased 
well-being or life satisfaction. These positive effects were 
reflected in significant corresponding changes in ratings by com-
munity observers (friends, family, work colleagues) of partici-
pant attitudes and behavior.
The results substantially extend the findings of a recent dou-
ble-blind pilot study with a lower dose of psilocybin (14 mg/70 
kg) in cancer patients that showed non-significant trends for ben-
efits of psilocybin compared with placebo (niacin) on measures 
of depression and anxiety, with some significant decreases rela-
tive to baseline demonstrated at 1 to 6 months (Grob et al., 2011).
The time-course, magnitude, and qualitative features of the 
high dose of psilocybin on session days were consistent with 
those observed in previous studies in healthy volunteers (Griffiths 
et al., 2006, 2011; Johnson et al., 2012).
The significant association of mystical-type experience 
(MEQ30) during Session 1 with most of the enduring changes in 
therapeutic outcome measures 5 weeks later (Figure 5) is consist-
ent with previous findings showing that such experiences on ses-
sion days predict long-term positive changes in attitudes, mood, 
behavior, and spirituality (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014; Griffiths 
et al., 2008, 2011). For most measures, this relationship contin-
ued to be significant when the intensity of overall psilocybin 
effect was controlled in a partial correlation analysis. This sug-
gests that mystical-type experience per se has an important role 
apart from overall intensity of drug effect. Finally, a mediation 
analysis further suggested that mystical-type experience has a 
mediating role in positive therapeutic response.
The observed decreases in psychological distress and anxiety 
about death may relate to recent epidemiological findings that 
lifetime psilocybin use was associated with significantly reduced 
odds of past month psychological distress and suicidality 
(Hendricks et al., 2015).
An innovative feature of the study design was that participants 
and staff monitors were given instructions that obscured the actual 
psilocybin dose conditions to facilitate blinding and minimize 
expectancy effects, which are believed to be a significant determi-
nant of classic hallucinogen effects (Griffiths et al., 2006; Metzner 
et al., 1965). Evidence of some success of this blinding was pro-
vided in a post-study questionnaire completed by staff and by sig-
nificant treatment effects observed after Session 1 in participants 
who received the very low dose of psilocybin. Although it was 
assumed that 1 mg/70 kg would be largely pharmacologically 
inactive, some pharmacological activity of this dose cannot be 
ruled out entirely. Thus, it might have been preferable to use an 
even lower dose of psilocybin (e.g. 0.01 mg/70 kg) to assure phar-
macological inactivity while maintaining the benefit of the 
instruction that psilocybin would be administered on each session. 
Although the low-dose comparison condition and instructions to 
participants and staff facilitated blinding and minimized expec-
tancy effects, it should be noted that these experimental design 
features may be difficult to implement in research settings that 
require complete disclosure of specific study conditions or arms.
Several additional experimental limitations should be noted. 
Participants were crossed over to the alternative dose condition 
after 5 weeks. Although this allowed assessment of acute and 
persisting effects of psilocybin in all study participants, it pre-
cluded double-blind assessment of efficacy of the high dose of 
psilocybin based on across group comparisons after 5 weeks. As 
in previous research, the study documented enduring increases in 
positive changes in attitudes and mood on both the participant-
rated Persisting Effects Questionnaire and on the Community 
Observer Questionnaire (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2011). However, 
neither of these measures has been independently validated. 
Likewise, although the finding of significant decreases in depres-
sion and anxiety symptoms on both participant-rated and clini-
cian-rated measures is a strength, the inclusion of blinded 
clinician ratings would further strengthen the study. The rela-
tively small sample (n = 51) that was highly educated and pre-
dominately White limits the generality of conclusions.
Finally, it is important to note that the overall approach of 
treating cancer-related psychological distress with psilocybin is 
limited by a variety of exclusion criteria (see online Supplementary 
material) and by the significant time and cost of professional sup-
port provided before, during, and after the psilocybin session. 
Patients may also be reluctant to participate in such an interven-
tion because high doses of psilocybin have sometimes been asso-
ciated with transient episodes of psychological distress or anxiety 
in patients (current study and studies in healthy volunteers, 
Griffiths et al., 2006, 2011).
The neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of psilocybin 
therapeutic effects remain speculative (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2012, 2014; Nichols, 2016; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). 
As a 5-HT2A agonist, the psilocybin metabolite psilocin directly 
and indirectly affects various brain cortical and subcortical areas 
and alters brain network dynamics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 
2014; Vollenweider and Kometer, 2010). Precisely how the 
enduring therapeutically relevant psilocybin effects are reflected 
in long-term alteration of cortical networks or other neuroplastic 
changes remains to be established.
Conclusions
When administered under psychologically supportive, double-
blind conditions, a single dose of psilocybin produced substantial 
and enduring decreases in depressed mood and anxiety along 
with increases in quality of life and decreases in death anxiety in 
patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. Ratings by 
patients themselves, clinicians, and community observers sug-
gested these effects endured at least 6 months. The overall rate of 
clinical response at 6 months on clinician-rated depression and 
anxiety was 78% and 83%, respectively. A multisite study in a 
larger and more diverse patient population should be conducted 
to establish the generality and safety of psilocybin treatment of 
psychological distress associated with life-threatening cancer.
