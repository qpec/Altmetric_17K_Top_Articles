BACKGROUND: Maternal breast milk (MBM) is enriched in
microRNAs, factors that regulate protein translation through-
out the human body. MBM from mothers of term and preterm
infants differs in nutrient, hormone, and bioactive-factor
composition, but the microRNA differences between these
groups have not been compared. We hypothesized that
gestational age at delivery influences microRNA in MBM,
particularly microRNAs involved in immunologic and meta-
bolic regulation.
METHODS: MBM from mothers of premature infants (pMBM)
obtained 3–4 weeks post delivery was compared with MBM
from mothers of term infants obtained at birth (tColostrum)
and 3–4 weeks post delivery (tMBM). The microRNA profile in
lipid and skim fractions of each sample was evaluated with
high-throughput sequencing.
RESULTS: The expression profiles of nine microRNAs in lipid
and skim pMBM differed from those in tMBM. Gene targets of
these microRNAs were functionally related to elemental
metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. The microRNA profile of
tColostrum was also distinct from that of pMBM, but it
clustered closely with tMBM. Twenty-one microRNAs corre-
lated with gestational age demonstrated limited relationships
with method of delivery, but not other maternal–infant
factors.
CONCLUSION: Premature delivery results in a unique MBM
microRNA profile with metabolic targets. This suggests that
preterm milk may have adaptive functions for growth in
premature infants.
M
aternal breast milk (MBM) provides optimal nutrition
for growth and development of infants. However,
premature infants face a variety of physiological challenges
that differ from infants born at term, and therefore they
have different nutritional needs from maternal milk. When
compared with the milk of mothers with term infants
(tMBM), the milk of mothers with preterm infants (pMBM)
has
higher
concentrations
of
protein,
nitrogen,
fat,
phospholipids, and elements such as sodium, chloride, and
iron (1,2). Conversely, there are lower levels of lactose and
zinc in pMBM compared with those in tMBM (1–3).
Macronutrient profiles in MBM also vary with gestation of
delivery. An example of this includes lipids: medium-chain
fatty acids are higher in pMBM, but levels of oleic acid are
lower (1). Analysis of the nutritional sufficiency of pMBM
shows that nutrients received per volume of MBM exceed the
intrauterine requirements for a given gestational age. In
addition, preterm infants fed pMBM receive more nutrients
than if they were fed tMBM (1,2). The importance of these
differences in pMBM and tMBM is highlighted by findings
that preterm infants fed pMBM have improved health
outcomes compared with the preterm infants fed tMBM (4).
Micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are non-coding nucleic
acid sequences derived from inter- and intragenic DNA
regions. They reduce the efficiency of gene expression,
inhibiting protein translation through targeted degradation
of mRNA transcripts. A single miRNA can bind to multiple
mRNAs exponentially increasing its regulatory activity (5).
Although miRNAs regulate numerous processes and are
present in biofluids throughout the body, they are found in
the greatest concentrations in MBM (6). The miRNAs found
in MBM originate primarily from mammary gland epithe-
lium, where they have a role in mammary epithelial cell
function (7). A portion may also be derived from extra-
mammary tissue via the bloodstream (5,8,9). In MBM,
miRNAs are packaged into vesicles such as exosomes (6).
This accounts for the higher proportion of miRNAs in the
lipid fraction of MBM compared with that in the skim
fraction (5,9). Recent studies have identified 281–602 unique
miRNAs in human MBM, most of which are found in lipids
(5,8,10). Over 65% of MBM miRNAs are related to immune
(10) or metabolic function (9,11–13). For example, miR-181a
and miR-155 are abundant in breast milk and work together
to increase B- and T-cell proliferation, resulting in enhanced
adaptive immunity (5,9,10). In addition, miR-33 and miR-122
(which are expressed in MBM) regulate macromolecule
synthesis
via
cholesterol
and
lipid
homeostasis
(9,12).

Translational Investigation
 Therefore, investigators have suggested that MBM miRNAs
affect infant health and development (5,9,10). This idea is
supported by a study in which arthritic mice who fed milk
rich in immune-related miRNAs (miR-30a, miR-223, and
miR-92a) exhibited a reduction in cartilage depletion and
inflammation (14).
Although many components of pMBM have been des-
cribed, no study has examined how pMBM differs from
tMBM in its composition of miRNA. When considering
nutrient composition differences of pMBM and the proposed
importance of miRNAs on infant health, a functional
difference in miRNA content seems likely. This study tests
the hypothesis that miRNA profiles differ between pMBM
and tMBM samples collected 1 month post delivery, and that
miRNAs “altered” in pMBM will have functional relevance to
infant metabolism and immune regulation.
METHODS
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the
Penn State College of Medicine. All participants provided informed
consent before participation.
Term Milk Recruitment and Collection
tMBM was collected as part of a follow-up study to the Intervention
Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT)
investigation (15), which examined the influence of genetics and
environment on the growth and development of second-born
siblings. This cohort included multiparous mothers ⩾ 20 years of
age who had given birth to singleton, full-term infants (⩾38 weeks
gestation). Exclusion criteria for this group included medical
complications with delivery and prenatal ultrasound, suggesting
intrauterine growth retardation or newborn birth weight o2,500 g.
Basic health and demographic information was obtained for each
mother–infant dyad, including maternal age (years), pre-pregnancy
weight (kg), pregnancy weight gain (kg), basic metabolic index
(kg/m2) at delivery, maternal race/ethnicity, presence or absence of
maternal hypertension, delivery method (cesarean section or vaginal
delivery), infant gestational age (weeks), and infant sex (Table 1).
The 36 tMBM samples utilized from INSIGHT study participants
were chosen at random, and researchers were blinded to the
maternal–infant characteristics. The medical and demographic
characteristics of the present cohort are reflective of those present
in the larger INSIGHT investigation (15). Term MBM samples were
collected during the first 48 h after delivery (tColostrum; n = 13) and
3–4 weeks after delivery (tMBM)—both before feeding (foremilk;
n = 10) and after feeding (hindmilk; n = 13). No study has yet
identified differences in the miRNA content of foremilk and
hindmilk MBM, and none were identified in our subset of samples
(Supplementary Table S8 online). Therefore, foremilk and hindmilk
samples were combined as part of the tMBM analysis. MBM samples
were manually expressed by participants into 50 ml RNAse-free
conical collection tubes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) after self-cleaning the nipple with soap and water. Samples
were stored at − 4 °C for up to 24 h before collection by research staff
and storage at − 80 °C while awaiting analysis.
Preterm Milk Recruitment and Collection
pMBM was collected as a part of an ongoing larger study to identify
relationships between genetic variation, diet, and gastrointestinal
microbiota in preterm infants. This cohort includes both primipar-
ous and multiparous women, 18–40 years of age giving birth to
premature infants (28–37 weeks gestation) that require care in the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. All breast-feeding mothers involved in
the initial study were asked to provide an MBM sample as a part of
the ongoing microbiota investigation. A subset of those samples was
chosen at random for inclusion in the current study by researchers
blinded to maternal–infant characteristics. Mother–infant dyads
were not excluded from the pMBM cohort based on birth weight or
medical complications such as emergent Cesarean delivery. The
pMBM samples (n = 31) were all collected 3–4 weeks after delivery
by expressing milk from both breasts using an electric Medela
Lactina or Symphony breast pump (McHenry, IL, USA). No
distinction was made between fore- and hindmilk collection in this
cohort. A 10 ml aliquot of MBM was stored in a sterile container at
4 °C for up to 24 h and then frozen at − 80 °C until samples could be
retrieved for analysis. Basic health and demographic information was
obtained for each mother–infant dyad, including maternal age,
maternal race/ethnicity, presence of maternal hypertension, delivery
method (cesarean section or vaginal), infant gestational age (weeks),
and infant sex (Table 1).
RNA Extraction
RNA was extracted with a Norgen Circulating and Exosomal RNA
Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek, Ontario, Canada) as per manu-
facturer instructions. Samples were flash-thawed and spun for
20 min at 4 °C at 800 rpm to separate the lipid and skim fractions.
For each sample, 50 μl of lipid and 200 μl of skim milk were pipeted
into separate 50 ml tubes. When there was not a sufficient amount of
lipid or skim, the maximum amount that could be extracted was
used. All samples were diluted to 1 ml using PBS. A two-step elution
procedure was employed using 50 μl of Elution solution centrifuged
at 2,000 rpm for 2 min and then 3 min at 14,000 rpm. This was
followed by a second elution using the 50 μl of initial flowthrough
centrifuged for only 3 min at 14,000 rpm. The final RNA concentra-
tion was determined on a Nanodrop Spectrophotmeter (Thermo-
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the extracted RNA was
stored at − 80 °C before sequencing.
RNA Sequencing and Alignment
Yield and quality of the RNA samples was assessed using an Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer prior to library construction with the NEXTflex
Small RNA-Seq Kit v3 (Bioo Scientific; Austin, Texas). Multiplexed
samples were run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Instrument (San Diego,
CA, USA) at a targeted depth of one million reads per sample. FastQ
outputs were clipped, trimmed, and filtered to a maximum read
length of 30 base pairs using the FASTX Toolkit Module (Cold
Spring Harbor, NY, USA) in Mobaxterm (Toulouse, France). Reads
were aligned to the hg38 build of the human genome in Partek Flow
(Partek; St Louis, Missouri) using the Bowtie 2 algorithm. Total
miRNA counts within each sample were quantified with miRBase

 mature microRNAs v21, and read counts were normalized across
samples using a trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method. Only
miRNAs with raw read counts greater than five in at least 50% of
samples were evaluated in the differential expression analysis. A
multi-model approach employing gene set analysis (GSA) in Partek
Flow was used to identify individual miRNAs with differential
expression between tMBM and pMBM samples collected 3–4 weeks
post delivery (in lipid and skim fractions, respectively). Differential
expression was defined as a Benjamini Hochberg FDR o0.05. The

Functional Annotation
The miRNAs with differential expression across tMBM and pMBM
fractions underwent functional annotation analysis in DIANA
mirPath v3 online software (http://snf-515788.vm.okeanos.grnet.gr/).
The microT-CDS algorithm was used to identify mRNA targets for
each miRNA of interest. MicroT-CDS uses miRBase v18 and Ensembl
v69 for computational prediction of interactions between miRNAs
and protein-coding genes in a species-specific manner (16). DIANA
mirPath identified the KEGG pathways and GO categories with
significant enrichment (FDR o0.05) for the miRNA targets in each
MBM fraction. A list of high-confidence mRNA targets from each
MBM fraction (microT-CDS score 40.98) was interrogated for
protein–protein interaction networks using moderate stringency
settings (interaction score 40.40) in the String v10 software (http://
string-db.org). String employs BIP, BioGRID, HPRD, IntAct, MINT,
and PDP databases to identify biochemical interactions between
lists of mRNA–protein products (17). Biological pathways over-
represented in high-confidence target gene sets were reported. Finally,
for the lipid fraction of pMBM (which showed functional enrichment
for metabolic processes), a list of 22 genes highly implicated in human
obesity (18) were interrogated for target overlap with pMBM miRNAs
of interest using miRDB software (http://www.mirdb.org).
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of maternal/infant medical and demographic data with a
two-tailed student’s t-test was performed to identify differences
between term and preterm groups. A power analysis determined the
sample size necessary for differentiating miRNAs among pMBM and
tMBM cohorts. Assuming a logarithmic distribution of miRNA
expression, it was determined that 22 MBM samples per group
provided 80% power to detect 1.8-fold differences among 500
miRNAs (per-gene alpha = 0.002). On the basis of these a priori
calculations, we collected 23 tMBM and 31 pMBM samples and
examined differences across 465 miRNAs in lipid MBM fractions.
Individual miRNAs with significant differences between tMBM and
pMBM fractions were identified using GSA analysis with Benjamini
Hochberg FDR correction. Those miRNAs with FDR o0.05 were
considered to have significant changes between groups. Fold change
in miRNA levels between groups was reported as log2 values. The
mRNA targets and their biological pathways were analyzed for
functional enrichment with Fisher’s exact tests, using a 2 × 2 table to
compare the ratio of identified mRNA targets to the number of
targets expected by chance. A nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test was
used to examine differences in individual miRNAs across lipid
fractions of tMBM, pMBM, and tColostrum. Low volumes of
colostrum produced following delivery do not allow for separation of
skim and lipid fractions. Thus, tColostrum samples were compared
only with lipid fractions of tMBM and pMBM (given their similar
high-fat content). This comparison provided insight into how MBM
miRNA might evolve following delivery (tColostrum vs. tMBM at
1 month) while also investigating the influence of maternal and
infant characteristics on MBM miRNA profiles. Spatial relationships
between total miRNA profiles for each group were examined with a
two-dimensional
PLS-DA
using
the
MetaboAnalyst
software
(McGill; Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Hierarchical clustering was
performed for the three groups using a Pearson distance measure of
the top 20 miRNAs on Kruskal–Wallis testing with a complete
clustering algorithm. Finally, the relationship between maternal/
infant medical and demographic characteristics and MBM miRNAs
of interest were examined with Pearson correlation coefficients.
RESULTS
Medical and Demographic Characteristics
There was no significant difference in maternal age (P = 0.2),
maternal race/ethnicity (% white; P = 0.4), or infant sex
(P = 0.6) between the pMBM and tMBM groups. Within the
pMBM group, there was a higher percentage of mothers with
gestational hypertension (P = 0.0008) and a higher percentage
of cesarean deliveries (P = 0.008). Gestational age at the time
of delivery was significantly lower in the pMBM group
(P = 4E − 19) (Table 1).
Comparison of tMBM and pMBM Lipid Fractions
Of the 2,588 mature human miRNAs interrogated for
expression levels in pMBM and tMBM, 465 were measured
in the lipid fractions (Supplementary Table S1). There were
113 miRNAs with significant expression differences (false
discovery rate (FDR) o0.05) between tMBM and pMBM
lipid samples. Sixty-eight of the miRNAs were downregulated
in pMBM lipid fractions and 45 were upregulated. Eighty-two
of these miRNAs have been described in previous studies of
MBM (6,14). The 15 miRNAs with the most significant
differences across tMBM and pMBM lipid fractions (Table 2)
underwent functional analysis. Of these, two pairs of miRNAs
have overlapping seed sequences (miR-1260a/miR-1260b and
miR378a-3p/miR378c) and six miRNAs have been previously
described in breast tissue, breast milk, or breast discharge
(19–24).
The 15 miRNAs most altered in the lipid fraction of pMBM
had a total of 4,401 predicted mRNA targets in DIANA
mirPath v3. These mRNA targets were associated with 90
gene ontology (GO) categories and 24 KEGG pathways
(Supplementary Table S2). Notable GO categories with
targeted enrichment included cellular nitrogen compound
metabolic process, biosynthetic process, catabolic process,
symbiosis, and viral process. Filtering down to the top 247
high-confidence mRNA targets with target scores ≥ 0.980
revealed 15 mRNAs targeted by more than one miRNA on the
list. Analysis of the 247 mRNAs in String v10 revealed a
significant protein–protein interaction network (P = 8.1E − 4)
containing 230 nodes and 148 edges with a clustering
coefficient of 0.752 (Supplementary Figure S1). Analysis of
this network identified 13 biologic processes with enrichment
(Table 3). Of note, three of the top five GO processes were
involved in negative regulation of cellular macromolecule
biosynthesis and each included more than 30 genes. In
addition, an investigation of 22 unique genes implicated in
human obesity (18) revealed that 19 genes had predicted
miRNA interactions, and 13 of these were targeted by a
miRNA of interest in lipid pMBM. For two obesity-related
genes (adrenergic, beta-receptor 3, ARDB3; and Nuclear
receptor sub-family 3, group C, member 1, NR3C1), there was

 consistent upregulation of all target miRNAs present in lipid
pMBM. For three other obesity-related genes (Leptin, LEP;
tumor necrosis factor, TNF; and uncoupling protein 3,
UCP3), there was consistent downregulation of all target
miRNAs present in lipid pMBM.
Comparison of tMBM and pMBM Skim Milk Fractions
There were fewer miRNAs identified in skim milk fractions.
Thirty-two miRNAs showed robust expression in the skim
milk fractions of both tMBM and pMBM (Supplementary
Table S3). All 32 of the miRNAs measured in skim milk
fractions were also found in lipid fractions. In the skim
fractions, there were 12 miRNAs with significant expression
differences between pMBM and tMBM samples (Table 4).
Seven of the 12 miRNAs were downregulated in skim
fractions of pMBM and five were upregulated. Three of
these miRNAs have been described in previous studies of
MBM and nine are novel (6,9,10,14). Of these 12 miRNAs,
two pairs have overlapping seed sequences (miR-1260a/
miR-1260b
and
miR378a-3p/miR378c),
and
five
have
been previously described in breast tissue or breast milk
(19,20,25–27).
The 12 miRNAs with significant differences in expression in
pMBM had a total of 2,767 predicted mRNA targets in
DIANA mirPath v3. These mRNAs showed enrichment for
10 GO categories and 9 KEGG pathways (Supplementary
Table S4). The most significantly enriched GO class was
molecules involved in nitrogen metabolism. The top three
KEGG pathways included genes involved in glycosphingolipid
biosynthesis, lysine degradation, and calcium signaling. There
were 124 mRNA targets that survived the high-confidence
filter, and 10 of these were targeted by more than one mRiNA
on the list. Functional analysis of the 124 mRNAs in String
v10 demonstrated a significant protein–protein interaction
network (P = 0.034) containing 111 nodes and 23 edges with a
clustering coefficient of 0.892 (Supplementary Figure S2);
however, GO analysis of this network failed to identify a
protein–protein
interaction
pathway
with
significant
enrichment.

 Combined analysis of pMBM Skim and Lipid Fractions
When comparing both lipid and skim fractions of pMBM
with
tMBM
fractions,
we
identified
nine
differentially
expressed
miRNAs
(miR378a-3p,
miR378c,
miR-378g,
miR-1260a, miR-1260b, miR-4783-5p, miR-4784, miR-5787,
and miR-7975). All nine miRNAs were altered in the same
direction in skim and lipid fractions of pMBM with the
exception of miR-4783-5p (which was upregulated in the
skim pMBM fraction but downregulated in the lipid pMBM
fraction). Two miRNAs were upregulated in both fractions of
pMBM (miR-5787 and miR-4784) and six were down-
regulated. Functional analysis of the nine miRNAs with
differential expression patterns in both the lipid and skim
fractions of pMBM yielded 2,614 predicted mRNA targets in
DIANA mirPATH v3. These mRNAs showed enrichment for
42 GO categories and 5 KEGG pathways (Supplementary
Table S5). Top GO and KEGG targets included networks of
mRNAs
related
to
micronutrient
metabolism,
such
as
biosynthetic
processes,
cellular
nitrogen
metabolism,
glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and lysine degradation. Eight
of the nine miRNAs also targeted 62 genes involved in viral
process.
Comparison of pMBM with tMBM and tColostrum
A Kruskal–Wallis test was used to examine differences in
individual miRNAs between lipid tMBM (collected 3–4 weeks
post delivery), lipid pMBM (collected 3–4 weeks post
delivery), and tColostrum samples (collected within 48 h of
delivery). There were 127 miRNAs with significant differences
among these groups (Supplementary Table S6). For most of
the miRNAs interrogated, expression patterns in tMBM and
tColostrum trended together in the opposite direction of
pMBM (Supplementary Figure S3). Partial least squares
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) analysis achieved partial
separation of the three sample types based on total miRNA
profile (Figure 1). A hierarchical clustering analysis using the
20 miRNAs with the most significant changes across the three
groups demonstrated complete separation of pMBM samples
from both tMBM and tColostrum samples (Figure 2). Note
that duplicate (foremilk and hindmilk) tMBM samples (e.g.,
tMBM 1a and tMBM 1b) tended to cluster together. In
addition, tColostrum and tMBM samples from the same
mother (e.g., tColostrum 7 and tMBM 7a) often cluster near
one another.
Relationship of Medical/Demographic Characteristics and MBM
miRNA
A Pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the
relationships between medical/demographic variables and
miRNA
expression.
This
analysis
identified
significant
correlations between gestational age (measured as a contin-
uous variable) and 21 of the 26 miRNAs “altered” in lipid or
skim fractions of pMBM samples (Supplementary Table S7).
Six of the 26 miRNAs were correlated with method of
delivery, but none correlated with maternal race/ethnicity,
presence of maternal hypertension, twin gestation, or infant

 sex. Of the six miRNAs correlated with delivery method, three
were positively correlated, three were negatively corre-
lated, and all six showed inverse patterns compared with
gestational age. Heatmap visualization of Pearson’s correlations
demonstrated hierarchical clustering of gestational age with
lipid and skim fractions of miR-1260a/b as well as the lipid
fraction of miR-6763-3p and the skim fraction of miR-7975
(Figure 3). All these factors were positively correlated.
DISCUSSION
The expression of miRNAs in the lipid and skim milk
fractions of pMBM differs significantly from the expression in
tMBM fractions 1 month after delivery. There are nine
miRNAs “altered” across both fractions, and these miRNAs
target
a
number
of
transcripts
involved
in
metabolic
processes. The pathway with the most significant enrichment
in miRNA targets from pMBM is glycosphingolipid biosynth-
esis. Glycosphingolipids are important for neurodevelopment
(28), are essential to a functioning cell membrane, and have a
major role in signal transduction of lipid rafts (29). These
same lipid domains may aid in the protected delivery of
miRNAs to the infant gut, regulating gastrointestinal function,
metabolism, and energy utilization.
Potential Mechanisms for a Unique miRNA Profile in pMBM
Differences in miRNA composition of pMBM and tMBM
may result from regulation within the mammary epithelial cell
nucleus (through pri-miRNA expression or pre-miRNA
processing), or they may represent a response to environ-
mental changes (such as abrupt premature delivery), which
alters the way miRNAs are packaged and extruded into MBM.
MiRNAs are packaged in a variety of ways, including vesicles,

 shedding, exosomal transfer, and RICS–complex protein-
binding (30). Because individual miRNAs show preference for
specific packaging mechanisms (31), a change in the ratio of
carriers (e.g., exosomes or nucleoproteins) could affect the
secretion of certain miRNAs in pMBM. Given that tMBM and
pMBM differ in macronutrient and micronutrient composi-
tion (1,2), it is plausible that they might also differ in types of
miRNA carriers.
Alternatively, premature delivery might influence produc-
tion of miRNAs within the cell nucleus. Given the milieu of
hormonal changes occurring pre- and post-partum, a shift in
maternal hormones could influence miRNA transcription. For
example, lactogenic hormones alter expression and secretion
of miRNAs in cultured mammary cells (7). Mothers of
preterm infants have lower prolactin levels (32), and this may
alter expression and secretion of miRNAs. The miRNA profile
in breast cells is altered by exposure to estrogen (33), and
exposure to progesterone increases the levels of miRNA
processing machinery, which could result in an altered
miRNA profile (34). As estrogen and progesterone levels
increase throughout pregnancy, mothers of premature babies
have lower circulating levels of both hormones at delivery.
This could have a lasting impact on the miRNAs in pMBM,
providing potential evolutionary benefits for the premature
neonate.
Implications for Infant Health
Premature infants face increased risk for a number of medical
co-morbidities, including failure to thrive, sepsis, necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC), and neurodevelopmental delays. These
risks may be potentiated or mitigated by maternal–infant
transfer of MBM miRNAs. Notably, premature infants have a
vastly different growth trajectory than term infants have, and
metabolic pathways, such as the glycolytic pathway, are
affected by miRNAs “altered” in pMBM (Table 3 and
Supplementary Table S2). An investigation of miRNAs that
target obesity-related genes (18) reveals changes relevant to
growth and metabolism in the premature newborn. Interest-
ingly, the miRNAs that target UCP3, LEP, and TNF are
downregulated in lipid pMBM. UCP3 alters metabolism in
response to fuel depletion, whereas TNF increases LEP
production and adipocyte insulin resistance (35). Altogether,

 polymorphisms in UCP3 and TNF act synergistically to
increase the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (36). Thus,
widespread downregulation of miRNAs targeting these genes
might influence glucose homeostasis in the premature infant.
Conversely, upregulation of miRNAs in lipid pMBM that
target ADRB3 and NR3C1 could lead to downregulation of
their protein products in the premature infant. A decrease in
ADRB3 and NR3C1, which are both negative regulators of
adipogenesis (37,38), could increase fat production and have
functional benefits in the cachectic premature newborn.
Premature infants face increased risk of viral and bacterial
infections. Previous studies have described enrichment of
immune-related miRNAs in MBM (5,10), and the current
investigation identifies a pair of immune-related miRNAs
(miR-1260a and miR-1260b) that are downregulated in
pMBM compared with tMBM (Tables 2 and 4). Human-
activated B-cell lines demonstrate robust miR-1260 expres-
sion in comparison
to indolent germinal center cells,
suggesting that miR-1260 may influence B-cell proliferation
(39). Thus, downregulation of miR-1260 in pMBM may not
serve a protective function in premature infants, but it could
contribute to their immune-susceptible state. Coupled with
decreased miRNA-targeting of TNF in pMBM, these changes
could have pathophysiologic implications in NEC. Conver-
sely, robust expression of miR-1260a/miR-1260b in tMBM
may impart immune protection on the infant gut and have a
role in the decreased incidence of gastroenteritis in breast-fed
infants (40).
The Relative Influence of Prematurity on MBM miRNA
To account for the vast differences between a 35-week and a
27-week preterm infant, the current study investigated
relationships between MBM miRNA and gestational age as
a continuous variable. This approach reaffirmed that 21 of the
26 miRNAs altered in pMBM vs. tMBM samples were
significantly related to premature delivery. Furthermore, none
of the 26 miRNAs influenced by gestational age were
correlated with maternal race/ethnicity, maternal hyperten-
sion, twin gestation, or infant sex (Figure 3). Six of these
miRNAs were correlated with cesarean section delivery, and

 this may represent an important health factor contributing to
MBM miRNA shifts following premature delivery. These
results suggest that maternal factors may influence MBM
miRNA content. This is consistent with a previous study (13),
showing that the expression of miRNAs in MBM was
perturbed by a maternal high-fat diet. In fact, the miRNA
composition of MBM may be influenced more by maternal
factors than length of lactation (i.e., time since delivery). This
idea is supported by Figure 2, showing that miRNA profiles
for tMBM preferentially cluster alongside tColostrum from
maternal pairs, rather than pMBM samples taken at the same
duration post delivery. Premature delivery, acting as a health
factor, may influence the miRNA profile of MBM for a
substantial period of lactation. This has implications for infant
growth trajectory throughout the breast-feeding period. It
may explain why premature infants grow more appropriately
on their mother’s own milk compared with the donor milk
from mothers delivering at term.
Limitations
The current study is limited by utilization of pMBM and
tMBM samples collected from two separate investigations.
This approach introduces differences in MBM collection
methods (e.g., manual vs. machine-pump), which could
influence miRNA content. MBM miRNA arises primarily
from the mammary gland epithelium rather than maternal
circulation (9), and the compressive nature of manual
pumping could disrupt this epithelial layer, resulting in the
collection of intracellular miRNA. To control for this, we have
performed differential centrifugation to eliminate epithelial
components in both pMBM and tMBM samples, focusing the
analysis on extracellular miRNAs in lipid and skim milk
layers. Furthermore, the miRNAs in the present analysis
included only those miRNAs present in 450% of samples.
Thus, intracellular miRNAs introduced by a manual pumping
technique should effectively be excluded from consideration.
An additional limitation of this study is its reliance on both
foremilk and hindmilk samples within the tMBM cohort.
Hindmilk, which is enriched in lipid content, but not lactose
or protein, could demonstrate increased miRNA diversity
through the stability of lipid-bound miRNAs. However, raw
RNA read counts in hindmilk tMBM samples did not exceed
those observed in foremilk samples. In addition, such
differences should be eliminated by differential centrifugation
and analysis of skim fractions, which removes lipid-bound
miRNAs. One previous study examining differences in pre-
and post-feed miRNAs within human milk cells identified 33
miRNAs with “alterations” post feed (11). Only three of these
miRNAs (miR-1260b, miR-4454, and miR-671-3p) show
differences in our comparison of pMBM and tMBM. This
small overlap is likely related to removal of human milk cells
by centrifugation. This technique focuses on MBM fractions
with the highest likelihood for maternal–infant transfer.
A final limitation of the present investigation is its sample size.
Previous studies have utilized 4–10 MBM samples for exploring
miRNA profiles, but our a priori power analysis required a
minimum of 22 samples per group. To power a comparison of
tMBM and pMBM groups, we included 23 and 31 samples from
these cohorts, respectively. Thus, our investigation is well-
powered for an analysis of 465 miRNAs across term and preterm
cohorts, but is somewhat underpowered for comparison of
tColostrum samples (n =13), and comparisons between foremilk
(n=10) and hindmilk (n =13) samples. Thus, these findings
should be interpreted with caution.
CONCLUSION
This study has identified nine miRNAs with differences in
lipid and skim fractions of pMBM compared with tMBM
collected 3–4 weeks post delivery. Many of the genes targeted
by these miRNAs influence metabolic pathways and could
affect infant growth trajectory via maternal–fetal transfer. A
subset of miRNAs was correlated with delivery method, and
this may represent one medical factor that triggers changes in
the MBM miRNA profile. These findings underscore how
MBM, which is generally considered the optimum nutrition
for infants, may be individually adapted to specific infant
needs through the regulation of factors such as miRNA.
