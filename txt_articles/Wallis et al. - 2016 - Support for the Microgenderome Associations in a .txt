Support for the Microgenderome: 
Associations in a Human Clinical 
Population
Amy Wallis1, Henry Butt2, Michelle Ball1, Donald P. Lewis3 & Dorothy Bruck1
The ‘microgenderome’ provides a paradigm shift that highlights the role of sex differences in the 
host-microbiota interaction relevant for autoimmune and neuro-immune conditions. Analysis of cross-
sectional self-report and faecal microbial data from 274 patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) suggests that commensal gut microorganisms may play both 
protective and deleterious roles in symptom expression. Results revealed significant sex-specific 
interactions between Firmicutes (Clostridium, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus) and ME/
CFS symptoms (including neurological, immune and mood symptoms), regardless of compositional 
similarity in microbial levels across the sexes. Extending animal studies, we provide support for the 
microgenderome in a human clinical population. Applied and mechanistic research needs to consider 
sex-interactions when examining the composition and function of human microbiota.
Our growing knowledge of the host-microbiota interaction is rapidly informing translational research and ther-
apeutic approaches to an array of chronic health conditions. Flagged as ‘the microgenderome’
, gender differences 
and the critical role of sex hormones has been emphasized within the brain-gut-enteric-microbial axis1. Using 
an animal model, Markle et al. confirmed the bidirectional relationship between commensal gut microbiota, 
sex hormones and the immune system and provided an explanation of sexual dimorphism in Type 1 diabe-
tes2. Their results revealed evidence of sex-specific microbial communities, sex-specific responses to the same 
microbial communities, the role of sexual maturation impacting changes to microbial communities, and evidence 
that microbial communities can play a protective and therapeutic role by influencing hormonal, metabolic and 
immune pathways. Highlighting the need to examine sex-specificity in microbial composition and function, 
these findings and similar3,4 suggest that intestinal dysbiosis (marked alterations in gut microbiota5,6) may play 
causative and consequential roles in autoimmune diseases and other health conditions2.
Intestinal dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability (aberrations in the mucosal lining and musculature 
of the gastrointestinal tract) have been observed in the neuro-immune condition, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS7–9). The core feature of post-exertional fatigue and multi-systemic symp-
tomatology reflect dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS), immune systems and inflammatory path-
ways10–11. Overlapping symptom presentation and the 2:1 female-dominant incidence rates are comparative to 
those found in autoimmune diseases12. Researchers have tended to shy away from investigating this vulnerable 
population since the xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV) controversies13. However, future 
research is required to clarify aetiology for this complex and debilitating condition10. Applying the microgender-
ome lens to ME/CFS may provide future opportunities to elucidate unconfirmed pathophysiology and differenti-
ate treatment pathways for this heterogeneous clinical population.
Using a cross-sectional design with a retrospective clinical data sample (N = 
 274, 68.6% female, aged 6–81 
years), we were able to provide sex comparisons for a) symptom presentation; b) microbial composition and; 
c) interactions between microbial communities and ME/CFS symptoms (see Method for detailed explanation).
Results
Sex Differences in Symptom Presentation. 
To assess sex differences in symptom presentation, 
self-reported symptoms were categorised into thirteen factors; with twelve factors categorized according to 
the International Consensus Criteria (ICC10), plus a mood symptoms factor (Table S1). Patients rated symp-
tom severity (past 7 days) and frequency (past 12 months) using a 5-point Likert scale (0–4). Impact scores

(frequency × 
 severity of symptoms) were calculated as a measure of each factor with higher scores reflecting 
greater impairment. Mann-Whitney tests showed sex differences for nine of the thirteen factors with measures of 
central tendency indicating that females were more likely to report greater impairment (Table 1). Notwithstanding 
possible gender differences in self-reporting or coping styles, the upregulated serotonergic response observed in 
female patients with CFS14 and evidence in parallel clinical populations, e.g., pain (osteoarthritic15, migraine16, 
and deep tissue17, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS18); and depression19 indicate that an interaction between sex ster-
oids, neuroendocrine and immune systems is a plausible explanation for increased symptom severity and asso-
ciated functional impairment in women. These results prompted investigation of pathophysiological differences.
Sex Similarity in Microbial Composition. 
Comparison between sexes for each genus relied on 
culture-based methods of assessing faecal microbial content. Metagenomic advances provide superior detection 
of microbial diversity, however, culture-based methods continue to have utility to examine viable count within 
clinical and applied research settings6. Genera were quantified by viable count (frequency as per cfu/g expo-
nent) and relative abundance (RA; ratio of genera count divided by total detectable bacteria count expressed as a 
percentage). Anaerobic (Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus) and aerobic 
(Escherichia, Streptococcus, Enterococcus) genera were investigated.
Mann-Whitney tests revealed no significant sex differences in the frequency (count) or proportion (RA) 
of each genus (Table S2). Additionally, sex comparisons of the total detectable bacteria count (Total Bacteria: 
Mdnmales = 
 1010 cfu/g, Mdnfemales = 
 1010 cfu/g, U = 
 7097.5, P = 
 0.093, r = 
 − 
0.10) and the ratio between all detect-
able aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (Aerobic:Anaerobic Ratio: Mdnmales = 
 1.21, Mdnfemales = 
 1.10, U = 
 6844.5, 
P = 
 0.088, r = 
 0.10) did not differ significantly between the sexes. These results suggest sex-consistency in micro-
bial composition within this clinical sample.
Interactions between Microbial Community and Symptom Expression. 
Spearman’s rank order 
correlations (rs) were used to investigate sex-interactions between microbial RA and ME/CFS symptom factors 
(Table S3). Multiple significant associations between genera and ME/CFS symptoms indicated a pattern of results 
diverging between the sexes (Fig. 1). The sex-specific interactions observed for Clostridium, Lactobacillus and 
Streptococcus are discussed.
Clostridium. 
In females, the Clostridium genus was positively associated with eight of the thirteen 
 
ME/CFS symptoms. Significant small-medium positive correlations were shown for fatigue (F1: rs =

and total symptoms score (F13: rs = 
 0.29, n = 
 117, p = 
 0.002). For males, an opposite association was found, 
with a significant negative correlation between Clostridium RA and mood symptoms (F11: rs = 
 − 
0.25, n = 
 68, 
p = 
 0.039). Whilst not reaching significance, a similar pattern of results was observed for pain, gastro-intestinal, 
and energy production/transportation impairment factors for males (Fig. 2A and Table S3).
Lactobacillus. 
Figure 2B highlights the positive associations between the distribution of Lactobacillus and 
total ME/CFS symptom factors for males (F12: rs = 
 0.28, n = 
 58, p = 
 0.036; F13: rs = 
 0.29, n = 
 57, p = 
 0.028) in 
this sample (Table S3). However for females, no significant relationships were revealed between these varia-
bles. Notably, in males only, analyses recorded moderate effect sizes for neurocognitive (F2: rs = 
 0.34, n = 
 72, 
p = 
 0.003) and neurosensory factors (F5: rs = 
 0.35, n =

 0.002). Other symptoms associated with neuro-
logical impairment, including pain (F3: rs = 
 0.26, n = 
 70, p = 
 0.031) and mood factors (F11: rs = 
 0.28, n = 
 69, 
p = 
 0.019) also showed consistently significant associations and similar effect sizes for males. When considering 
the compositional similarity in the frequency and distribution of Lactobacillus across the sexes in this sample, the 
symptom expression differences in males may be best explained by a sex-specific response to the same microbial 
community.
Streptococcus. 
The sex-divergent pattern of associations between Streptococcus levels and ME/CFS symp-
toms was consistent across twelve of the thirteen symptom factors (Fig. 2C and Table S3). Correlations for 
Streptococcus RA suggested opposing protective or pathogenic qualities between the sexes. For males, analyses 
revealed small to moderate significant positive associations between Streptococcus RA and pain (F3: rs = 
 0.39, 
n =

relations between Streptococcus RA and pain (F3: rs =

Bifidobacterium: Possible sex consistency. 
Although only reaching significance in the female subgroup, 
analyses of Bifidobacterium RA provided an example of sex consistency in this sample (Fig. 2D and Table S3) and 
provided support for possible protective properties of these species. Significant, small negative correlations were

Discussion
Observations in this ME/CFS sample showed a) sex differences in symptom presentation; b) sex consistency 
in microbial communities and; c) sex-specific interactions with gut microbiota and symptom expression. 
Associations between symptom level and bacterial level, in the context of sex consistency in microbial commu-
nities, imply sex-specific interactions with gut microbiota. Precise mechanisms of sex interactions can only be 
hypothesized because the hormonal status of patients was not available for this sample. It has been suggested that 
changes in microbial composition and the associated imbalance in production of estrogen receptor agonists/
antagonists may contribute to immune disturbances and other symptoms observed in ME/CFS20. Specific bac-
terial taxa (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria) metabolise and consequently modulate homeostasis 
of sex steroid hormones through genes that encode hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) enzymes21. Particular 
species within the genera Clostridium, Bacteroides and Eubacterium are known to produce the enzymes 7α 
– and 
7β 
–hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase22,23, deconjugating primary bile acids enabling humans and animals to absorb 
cholesterol, the precursor of steroid hormones. The results from this study however question our current under-
standing of these processes and suggest the need to examine the host relationship with intestinal organisms at the 
species level of each of the three genera.
The relationship between microbiota and hormones appears bidirectional. In populations with intestinal 
dysbiosis, the consequence of changes to hormonal metabolism and dysregulation may help explain symp-
tom expression and variability. In reverse, hormonal imbalances may also perpetuate intestinal dysbiosis. The 
Firmicutes phylum of bacteria include Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus species, all of which showed 
interesting sex-interactions in our sample. Prospective studies should consider obtaining hormonal status and 
biomarkers to examine possible interactions with microbial composition in an attempt to delineate the physiology 
underlying these sex-differences.
Perhaps the associations between Clostridium composition and some ME/CFS symptoms in females may 
reflect the influence of diet and variation at the species level. An increase in Firmicutes has also been associated 
with a more typically ‘Western diet’ with opportunistic species Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens 
flourishing with increased refined sugar intake24. The sex-specific associations in the current sample raise further 
questions about intestinal dysbiosis in ME/CFS, particularly investigating whether higher levels of Clostridium

the size of the relationship between symptom factors and the relative abundance (RA) of A. Clostridium, 
B. Lactobacillus, C. Streptococcus, and D. Bifidobacterium. Positive correlations indicate that an increase in 
microbial relative abundance was monotonically associated with an increase in symptom scores. The direction 
of a positive association could also be explained in reverse. Negative correlations indicate an inverse monotonic 
relationship between the two variables. Correlations were classified as small (0.01), moderate (0.03) and large 
(0.05) effect sizes51. *P <

species exacerbate neurological symptoms in females and the potential benefits of targeting treatment to restore 
intestinal balance.
Observations across Lactobacillus and Streptococcus genera suggest support for D-lactate as a contributing 
factor to symptom expression, particularly in males. This hypothesis explains the neurological symptoms of 
 
ME/CFS as a consequence of neurotoxic effects of bacterial metabolites (i.e., D-lactic acid produced by most 
species of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus) on the brain and nervous system25. Increased D-lactic acid levels have 
been found in the serum of CFS patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth7, associated with cognitive and neu-
rological impairments26, and reduced in response to treatment in a sample of CFS patients27. The mechanisms of 
a sex-specific response to D-lactic acid have not been considered.
Potential sex differences in symptom expression as a consequential or contributing factor in microbial com-
position have clinical and research implications. Treatment aimed at restoring intestinal homeostasis, including 
faecal transplants, antibiotic and probiotic therapy require consideration of individual variation and poten-
tial sex difference affecting treatment responsiveness. Clinical trials need to be designed with appropriately 
sized samples to enable sex comparisons. Compositional similarity within a clinical population may be falsely 
interpreted without considering sex interactions. Notably, the findings for Lactobacillus spp. in males caution 
against premature probiotic supplementation with D-lactate producing bacteria. However, results support the 
health-promoting effects of Bifidobacteria as observed across diverse disease states including IBS28,29, cancer30, 
anxiety and depression31,32.
In combination, our results suggest support for the microgenderome in a human clinical population. The 
sex-interactions observed using genera analyses do not provide specificity and prompt the need for further exam-
ination at the species level. These results call for mechanistic research to examine the role of the sex steroid inter-
action with microbiota in the modulation of fatigue, pain, neural and immune responses seen within ME/CFS. 
This is a clinically complex but potentially advantageous research population with overlapping symptomatology 
relevant for diverse clinical groups. Research efforts that generate phenotypes and mechanistic understanding of 
the human microbiome require examination of potential sex and functional differences within compositionally 
similar communities.
Methods
Setting and Participants. 
The methods for this study were conducted in accordance with the approved 
guidelines for human experimental research. Ethics approval was obtained from Victoria University Human 
Research Ethics Committee in May 2013 (HRE13-109). As a retrospective sample, there was no direct contact 
with participants. Patients obtaining faecal assessment through Bioscreen (Aust.) signed informed consent to 
allow their microbial results and accompanying self-reported symptoms to be used for research purposes.
The dataset included 274 patients who had signed consent to participate in research during faecal micro-
bial assessment (FMA) through the NATA (National Association of Testing Authorities) accredited laboratory, 
Bioscreen. All patients received a diagnosis of CFS in accordance with the Canadian Definition Criteria33 or 
Fukuda criteria34 during treatment from one of the co-authors (DPL) between January 2011 and April 2013. Only 
the earliest available data were included when multiple FMA results were available for the same patient.
Sex representation within this study was equivalent to prevalence ratios amongst clinical ME/CFS popula-
tions10 with 86 male (31.4%) and 188 female (68.6%) participants. The age range of 6 to 81 years (M = 
 39.25, 
SD = 
 14.81) is consistently representative of the occurrence of ME/CFS across developmental stages10. Age was 
not provided for two participants. Additional demographic information or information about comorbid diagno-
ses were not available. Therefore, no additional exclusion criteria were applied.
Data sources/measurement. 
Faecal Microbial Analysis. Sample collection: Prior to faecal sample col-
lection, patients were instructed to cease antibiotic and/or probiotic treatment for four and two weeks, respec-
tively. Patients collected a sample of their first morning bowel motion in a faecal container (anaerobic pouch 
system) with a perforated lid to aid anaerobiasis (achieved by activating Anaero Gen Compact (Oxoid, Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Australia)). Samples were immediately transported to the laboratory in cold conditions (< 
12 °C) 
for analysis within 48 hours after collection. Laboratory protocol rejects samples subjected to inaccurate collec-
tion, transportation, anaerobiasis or refrigeration procedures. Internal quality assurance investigations validated 
the anaerobic transport and culture methods (see35).
Microbial identification and quantification: After removal from the anaerobic pouch system, all faecal samples 
were processed within 10–15 minutes. Between 0.5–1.0 g was transferred to 10 mL of 1% glucose-saline buffer36. 
Dilution factor was determined by the difference in the weight of the glucose-saline buffer with and without 
the sample. One hundred and one thousand fold dilutions (beginning from 10−1 to 10−7) of homogenised fae-
cal samples were prepared37. Dilutions (10 and/or 1 μ 
L amounts) were transferred onto dried Columbia horse 
blood agar (Oxoid), chromogenic medium (Oxoid), colistin and nalidixic acid blood selective agar (Oxoid), and 
chloramphenicol-gentamicin selective Sabouraud agar for aerobic incubation. Anaerobic incubation (4 day dura-
tion) in anaerobic jars (Oxoid) utilised pre-reduced Columbia horse blood haemin agar and Raka Ray medium. 
Aerobic media were incubated at 35 °C for 48 hours. A stereomicroscope was used to examine both aerobic and 
anaerobic culture plates for a minimum of 20 min/plate before bacterial identification. Each colony from each 
medium was microscopically examined and the colony/viable count were quantified for each plate. To assess 
purity prior to identification, similar morphotypes were sub-cultured onto horse blood agar.
Identification using MALDI-TOF MS analysis: Following overnight purity checks, index bacterial colonies 
were transferred to a target polished steel plate (MSP 96, Bruker Daltonics Inc.) for drying under exhaust ventila-
tion in a Class II Biohazard Hood (Gelman Sciences Australia) at room temperature. Air-dried samples were sub-
jected to protein extraction with 1 μ 
L 70% formic acid (Sigma). After repeat air-drying under exhaust ventilation,

samples were overlaid with 1 μ 
L of matrix solution (saturated solution of α 
-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid 
(HCCA) in a mixture of 47.5% ultra-pure water, 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and 50% acetonitrile). Dried samples 
were analysed using Microflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) 
equipped with a 60 Hz nitrogen laser. Spectra were recorded in the positive linear mode for the mass range 
of 2,000–20,000 Da at maximum laser frequency. The MALDI Biotyper 3.0 software package (default settings; 
Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) was used to automatically analyse and measure raw spectra without user 
intervention. This technology can detect approximately 5000 species. The most prevalent microorganisms are 
quantified (viable count detection limits include anaerobes > 
108 CFU/g, facultative anaerobes > 
105).
Data Used for Statistical Analysis. Genera investigated: Anaerobic (Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, 
Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus) and aerobic genera (Escherichia, Streptococcus, Enterococcus) were investigated. 
Species identified during FMA were classified according to genera (data provided is the combined total of spe-
cies identified within each genus). Species-level analyses were not included due to the heterogeneity of species 
identified during MALDI-TOF MS assessment and insufficient power to correlate less common species. Whilst 
genera-level investigations lack specificity, some evidence suggests similar metabolic and functional capacity 
within taxa and genera38.
Justifications for selected genera: A priori selection of genera was grounded in the literature. Some of the 
most abundant strains of enteric microbiota within healthy human samples fall within Bacteroides, Clostridium, 
Eubacterium, and Prevotella as the anaerobic genera and Escherichia and Streptococcus as the aerobic genera39. 
Within infants, some of the dominant enteric microbiota include Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus 
species40. Whilst the abundance of specific microbiota does not necessarily equate to their purpose, function or 
importance39, they provide an initial direction for examining specific genera.
The D-lactate hypothesis and relationship between increased D-lactate levels and neurocognitive impair-
ment26 further guided selection of genera investigated in this research. An association between D-lactic acido-
sis and an overgrowth of enteric lactic acid bacteria (including some species of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, 
Enterococcus and Streptococcus) has been shown7. An Australian sample of patients with ME/CFS showed signif-
icantly higher levels of Enterococcus and Streptococcus genera viable count compared with healthy controls7. This 
study also showed variable levels of Escherichia coli amongst ME/CFS samples compared with controls, hence the 
Escherichia genus was also investigated.
A possible cause of D-lactic acidosis is from abnormal metabolism of carbohydrate by enteric microbiota41. 
Although not a primary byproduct, Eubacterium species can also produce lactic acid42. Evidence of dietary influ-
ences on microbial composition supported the rationale for including examination of Eubacterium (associated 
with dietary fibre and starch43); and Clostridium (associated with increased refined sugar inake26). Additionally, 
some strains of Clostridium have been associated with health44 and others with pathology45.
Some strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria are frequently associated with optimal health and used for 
probiotic supplementation28–32,46. Health-promoting functions of these microbiota contrast the D-lactic hypoth-
esis and provided further justification for examining these genera.
The abundance of Prevotella as well as evidence of an association between colonic overgrowth and neurologi-
cal symptoms47 suggests the need to further investigate this genus. Unfortunately, Prevotella species were excluded 
from the analysis due to variable microbial identification and quantification methods during the data collection 
period.
Selection of the eight genera was supported by post-hoc analyses of the current dataset showing that they 
accounted for large proportions of detectable microbiota in the majority of stool samples. To assess the level 
of representation of selected genera within this ME/CFS sample, the Total RA was calculated as the combined 
proportion of the eight genera investigated within the total detectable bacteria (i.e., including all genera and not 
specifically limited to those analyzed in this study). From the 270 samples that were assessed for both aerobic 
and anaerobic bacteria, the eight genera represented between 5–100% of detectable microbiota (M = 
 92.60%, 
SD = 
 16.80%). The most common Total RA score was 100% with 90% of the sample showing a Total RA of equal 
to or above 72%. Sex comparisons of the Total RA indicated similarity in representation of the eight genera inves-
tigated (Mdnmales = 
 99.67%, Mdnfemales = 
 99.77%, U = 
 8529.0, P = 
 0.263, r = 
 0.068).
Count: Microbial frequency of each genus was measured in colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g). Genera 
exponent values were used as a measure of each microbial count per patient.
Total Bacteria: Exponent values for the microbial frequency of all detectable bacteria as measured in CFU/g.
Aerobic:Anaerobic Ratio: Total detectable aerobic bacteria divided by total detectable anaerobic bacteria multi-
plied by 1000. This includes all genera and not specifically limited to those selected for data analysis.
Relative abundance (RA): Percentages were calculated by dividing the viable count of each genus by the total 
detectable bacteria count (methods akin to39,48). The expanded whole numbers for both counts were used in this 
calculation.
Total RA: The sum of RA percentages for the eight selected genera.
Patient Questionnaire: Concurrently to faecal sample collection, patients completed an 88-item Bioscreen 
Patient Questionnaire (BPQ): The BPQ is used for all referring patients regardless of clinical presentation.

Items address diverse symptomatology similar to the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised49 and Beck Depression 
Inventory-II50. Patients rated symptom severity (past 7 days) and frequency (past 12 months) using a 5-point 
Likert scale (0–4). Frequency scores ranked from none at all (0) to extreme (4, severity) or constant (4, frequency). 
The BPQ showed high internal consistency within this ME/CFS population (Cronbach’s α 
 = 
 0.974).
ME/CFS Symptom Factors: Seventy-six BPQ items were clinically classified into 13 factors reflecting ME/CFS 
symptoms in accordance with the ICC (F1-F1010) and mood symptoms (F11; Table S1). Seventeen items were 
omitted that were inconsistent with the ICC, could be misinterpreted as representative of two or more factors, 
or did not pertain to mood symptoms. Whilst psychological or mood symptoms are not specified under the 
ICC, high comorbidity with depression and anxiety symptoms in the ME/CFS population provided the ration-
ale for further investigation of mood symptoms (predominantly depressive and anxiety symptoms). An impact 
score (severity × 
 frequency) was calculated for each item (possible range 0–16) and relevant items were added to 
form corresponding factors. As measures of combined symptomatology, an ICC Symptoms Score (summation of 
F1-10) and Total Symptoms Score (summation of F1-F11) were calculated.
Bias: To reduce item selection bias, the factor classification was performed according to face validity as assessed 
by A.W., D.B. and M.B. and confirmed by consultation with clinician, D.P.L. No changes to the factor structure 
were made after commencing data analysis.
As a retrospective data sample, FMA results were initially performed for clinical purposes. Hence, no a priori 
hypotheses influenced data collection methods reducing the potential for investigator bias or falsification of data.
Statistical Methods. 
Descriptive statistics were performed for all ME/CFS symptom (Table 1 and Table S1) 
and microbial variables (Table S2) for the total sample, males and females. No outliers were found for microbial 
variables. The heterogeneity of symptom scores influenced the decision to include any clusters of outliers identi-
fied by SPSS on the ME/CFS Symptom Factors. Pairwise exclusion was used for missing data. All variables defied 
normality, therefore, nonparametric analyses were employed.
Examining Subgroups and Interactions. Sex comparisons on ME/CFS symptom factors: Descriptive sta-
tistics confirmed that each symptom factor (total, females and males separately) defied normality. A series of 
Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the distribution of female and male symptom scores for each factor.
Sex comparison for microbial levels: Descriptive statistics confirmed that each microbial genus (count and 
RA) defied normality. A series of Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the distribution of female and male 
microbial levels for count and percentage distribution independently. Effect sizes were calculated using equation:

where N was the total sample used in the analysis. Effect sizes were classified as small (0.01), moderate (0.03) and 
large (0.05) according to Cohen’s (1988) guidelines51.
Associations between microbial level and ME/CFS symptoms: Spearman’s rank order correlations (rs) were used 
to investigate sex-interactions between microbial RA and ME/CFS symptom factors (Table S3). Missing data were 
excluded pairwise from the analyses. Correlations were deemed statistically significant at P < 
 0.05. Positive cor-
relations indicated an increase in microbial relative abundance was monotonically associated with an increase in 
symptom scores. The direction of a positive association could also be explained in reverse. Negative correlations 
indicate an inverse monotonic relationship between the two variables. Correlations were classified as small (0.01), 
moderate (0.03) and large (0.05) effect sizes51.
Observed z scores were calculated using equation (2)52 to examine whether there was a statistically signifi-
cant difference between the sexes for the strength of the correlation between symptom factor and microbial RA. 
Differences were deemed statistically significant when zobs < 
 − 
1.96 or zobs > 
 1.9652.

Design Limitations and Advantages. 
We caution against over-interpretation of these findings consid-
ering the limitations of cross-sectional, observational research design (unable to establish causation or con-
sequence, difficulty excluding confounding variables53) and categorical analysis of genera rather than species. 
Other genera that were not selected during this investigation may also have relevance for ME/CFS symptomatol-
ogy. Technological advancement enabling 16S amplicon sequencing of viable count will be able to identify and 
compare a broader range of genera and species. This will then allow comparison with other ME/CFS samples 
 
(e.g. 20) and the ability to examine the representative nature of these results whilst considering the impact of eth-
nic and geographic diversity on microbial composition. Applied human research has clinical relevance54 and can 
appropriately direct the pursuits in animal investigations where mechanistic studies are needed21. A symbiotic, 
interdisciplinary approach that integrates sex differences in clinical observational data and mechanistic data will 
inform therapeutic directions and treatment utility.
