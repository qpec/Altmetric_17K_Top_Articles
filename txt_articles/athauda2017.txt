Summary
Background Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has neuroprotective effects in preclinical 
models of Parkinson’s disease. We investigated whether these effects would be apparent in a clinical trial.
Methods In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with moderate Parkinson’s 
disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of exenatide 2 mg or placebo once weekly for 
48 weeks in addition to their regular medication, followed by a 12-week washout period. Eligible patients were aged 
25–75 years, had idiopathic Parkinson’s disease as measured by Queen Square Brain Bank criteria, were on 
dopaminergic treatment with wearing-off effects, and were at Hoehn and Yahr stage 2·5 or less when on treatment. 
Randomisation was by web-based randomisation with a two strata block design according to disease severity. Patients 
and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the adjusted difference in the 
Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor subscale (part 3) in the 
practically defined off-medication state at 60 weeks. All efficacy analyses were based on a modified intention-to-treat 
principle, which included all patients who completed any post-randomisation follow-up assessments. The study is 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01971242) and is completed.
Findings Between June 18, 2014, and March 13, 2015, 62 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 32 to exenatide 
and 30 to placebo. Our primary analysis included 31 patients in the exenatide group and 29 patients in the placebo 
group. At 60 weeks, off-medication scores on part 3 of the MDS-UPDRS had improved by 1·0 points (95% CI 
–2·6 to 0·7) in the exenatide group and worsened by 2·1 points (–0·6 to 4·8) in the placebo group, an adjusted mean 
difference of –3·5 points (–6·7 to –0·3; p=0·0318). Injection site reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were 
common adverse events in both groups. Six serious adverse events occurred in the exenatide group and two in the 
placebo group, although none in either group were judged to be related to the study interventions.
Interpretation Exenatide had positive effects on practically defined off-medication motor scores in Parkinson’s disease, 
which were sustained beyond the period of exposure. Whether exenatide affects the underlying disease pathophysiology 
or simply induces long-lasting symptomatic effects is uncertain. Exenatide represents a major new avenue for 
investigation in Parkinson’s disease, and effects on everyday symptoms should be examined in longer-term trials.

Introduction
Perhaps the most important unmet need in Parkinson’s 
disease is the development of a neuroprotective or 
disease-modifying therapy that can slow or halt disease 
progression. None of the compounds that had potential 
neuroprotective properties in in-vitro or animal models 
have shown any effects on disease progression in clinical 
trials.1
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are licensed 
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These drugs activate 
GLP-1 receptors to promote glucose-level-dependent 
insulin secretion, inhibit glucagon secretion, and slow 
gastric emptying.2 Exenatide is a synthetic version of 
exendin-4, a naturally occurring analogue of human 
GLP-1 that was originally discovered in the saliva of the 
Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and is resistant to 
the normal metabolic processes that degrade endogenous 
human GLP-1.3 In addition to effects on glucose 
homoeostasis, evidence from studies in toxin-based 
rodent models of Parkinson’s disease show that exenatide 
crosses the blood–brain barrier and exerts neuroprotective 
and neurorestorative effects via GLP-1 receptors at doses 
similar to those used in type 2 diabetes, resulting 
in improvements in motor performance, behaviour, 
learning, and memory.4–8
We previously did a small, proof-of-concept, open-label 
trial9 of exenatide in patients with Parkinson’s disease of 
moderate severity. 12 months’ exposure to exenatide led 
to improvements in motor and cognitive assessments in 
the intervention group compared with the control group, 
which persisted 12 months after drug withdrawal.10 On 
the basis of these encouraging findings, we aimed to do a 
randomised, placebo-controlled trial (NCT01971242) to 
assess further the potential disease-modifying effects of 
48 weeks’ exposure to exenatide, followed by a 12-week 
washout, on the motor severity of Parkinson’s disease.

Methods
Study design and participants
We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, single-centre trial of exenatide once 
weekly in Parkinson’s disease of moderate severity. The 
trial was done at the Leonard Wolfson Experimental 
Neuroscience Centre (London, UK), a dedicated clinical 
trial research facility and part of the University College 
London (UCL) Institute of Neurology and the National 
Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery. The study was 
coordinated by the UCL Comprehensive Clinical Trials 
Unit (London, UK). Clinical oversight was provided by a 
trial steering committee, and an independent data and 
safety 
monitoring 
board. 
Trial 
operations 
were 
supported by the Leonard Wolfson Experimental 
Neuroscience Centre and the National Institute for 
Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at the 
UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital 
for Neurology and Neurosurgery (London, UK).
Eligible men and women were aged 25–75 years, had 
idiopathic Parkinson’s disease as measured by Queen 
Square Brain Bank criteria,11 were on dopaminergic 
treatment with wearing-off effects, were judged able to 
administer the trial drug, and were at Hoehn and Yahr 
stage 2·5 or less when on treatment. We pre-screened 
patients over the phone against these criteria before 
formal in-person screening. Key exclusion criteria (see 
trial protocol for full list) included concurrent dementia 
(defined as a score <120 points on the Mattis-Dementia 
Rating scale), body-mass index (BMI) of less than 18·5, 
and 
diabetes 
(glycated 
haemoglobin 
[HbA1c] 
≥48 mmol/mol at screening). This trial was approved by 
the Brent NHS Research Ethics Committee, London. All 
patients provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were recruited from the pool of patients attending 
the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery, or 
approached us as a result of hearing about the trial on 
Clinicaltrials.gov 
or 
Fox 
Trial 
Finder. 
We 
used 
SealedEnvelope, an independent, commerical, internet-
based randomisation service that generated the online 
randomisation list on the basis of guidance from the trial 
IT manager (SH) and trial statistician (SSS). After 
extensive testing to ensure that the service worked 
perfectly, the trial recruiting team used it for 
randomisation, with a block design of two strata according 
to disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1·0–2·0 vs 
stage 2·5). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
subcutaneous exenatide once weekly or matched placebo 
injections, in addition to their regular drugs. The trial 
statistician (SSS) generated and uploaded unique 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed with the terms “Parkinson’s disease”, 
“glucagon-like peptide-1”, “exenatide”, “trial”, 
“neuroprotection”, and “disease modification” for articles 
published in English on or before Dec 4, 2016 (the date of our 
final search), in any field. We identified several preclinical 
studies of exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, which 
showed neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in 
experimental animal-toxin models of Parkinson’s disease. 
We also identified a proof-of-concept study of exenatide as a 
possible disease-modifying treatment in patients with 
Parkinson’s disease. In this open-label trial, 21 patients who 
received 12 months of exenatide injections in addition to their 
regular drugs had a mean improvement of 2·7 points on the 
Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale part 3, compared with a deterioration of 
2·2 points in 24 patients in the control group who received 
their regular drugs only (mean difference 4·9, 95% CI 0·3–9·4; 
p=0·037). Furthermore, patients treated with exenatide had a 
significant improvement on a cognitive assessment scale 
compared with those in the control group (mean 
difference 5·0, 95% CI 9·2–0·8; p=0·006). Persistent significant 
benefits were noted in the exenatide group compared with the 
control group in motor disability and cognitive function 
12 months after the withdrawal of exenatide. However, 
because a placebo control was not used, these data could not 
be interpreted as proof of efficacy.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, ours is the first randomised, 
placebo-controlled trial of exenatide as a potential 
disease-modifying drug in Parkinson’s disease. After 48 weeks, 
patients given 2 mg exenatide weekly had a significant 
advantage in terms of the primary outcome, the Movement 
Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale 
part 3, compared with those given placebo. This difference 
between groups was still significant after a 12-week drug 
washout period. Our study is also the first to show that 
exenatide, when given at licensed diabetes doses, crosses the 
blood–brain barrier and is detectable in cerebrospinal fluid in 
concentrations similar to those in preclinical models of 
Parkinson’s disease, which are associated with advantageous 
outcomes. Exenatide was well tolerated, although injection site 
reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted.
Implications of all the available evidence
We have replicated the results of our previous clinical study and 
shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease who were given 
exenatide had improvements in the practically defined 
off-medication motor scores of Parkinson’s disease compared 
with those given placebo. Whether exenatide affects the 
underlying pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease or simply 
induces long-lasting symptomatic effects remains uncertain. 
However, these results represent a major new avenue for 
investigation in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.

three-digit identifiers for every active and placebo drug kit 
to the randomisation service to allow allocation of masked 
study drug kits (sufficient for 12 weeks) at randomisation 
and follow-up visits by assessing clinicians. The 
randomisation service then provided the relevant kit 
numbers that were to be dispensed to the patient from 
the hospital pharmacy. Patients and investigators were 
masked to treatment allocation throughout the study. The 
study drug kit codes were known only to the qualified 
person at the Royal Free Pharmacy (London, UK), who 
ensured that exenatide and placebo kits were labelled 
with the appropriate codes, and to SealedEnvelope. Data 
were unblinded after data base lock, at which point the 
statistican analysing the data was unblinded.
Procedures
Our trial had a washout design, comprising a 48-week 
exposure period, in which patients self-administered 
exenatide 2 mg or placebo via subcutaneous injection 
once weekly, followed by study drug withdrawal and a 
final assessment 12 weeks later. At screening for trial 
entry, each patient underwent a physical and neurological 
examination, assessments of mood and cognition, and 
blood sampling for clinical laboratory tests; women of 
childbearing potential also had a pregnancy test. 
Electrocardiographic and [¹²³I]FP-CIT single photon 
emission CT (DaTscan) imaging were also done. After 
confirmation of patient eligibility, subsequent visits were 
held at baseline (week 0) and weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60. 
Immediately after completion of all baseline assessments, 
patients were instructed on how to assemble and self- 
administer 
the 
injections 
and 
were 
witnessed 
administering their first injection. At each visit, patients 
were supplied with study drug kits.
Patients were asked to attend each visit in an off-
medication state, which was defined as a period of 
withdrawal of levodopa for at least 8 h (ie, overnight) or 
36 h in the case of long-acting drugs such as ropinirole, 
pramipexole, rasagiline, and rotigotine. All assessments 
were done early in the morning. A dedicated trial team 
used the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s 
Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and timed motor 
tests (10 m timed walk, timed keyboard taps in 30 s with a 
novel internet-based program) to assess patients. Patients 
then underwent repeat motor assessments roughly 1 h 
after taking their regular Parkinson’s disease medications 
(to 
allow 
uniformity 
across 
patients), 
alongside 
assessments of cognition (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale), 
dyskinesia (Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale), quality of 
life (EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire, Parkinson’s 
Disease Questionnaire 39), mood (Montgomery-Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale), and non-motor symptoms 
(Non-Motor Symptoms Severity Scale). Empty drug vials 
and questionnaires were collected at each visit to assess 
compliance. Patients also kept Hauser diaries.
After 48 weeks, study drugs were withdrawn. We did a 
final clinical assessment and repeat DaTscan imaging at 
60 weeks. Blood and urine were collected at each visit, 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected at weeks 12 
and 48, for pharmacokinetic measurements. Assess 
ment 
of serum and CSF concentrations of exenatide was done 
in a blinded manner in duplicate across all samples by 
fluorescent ELISA immunoassay (FEK-070-94; Phoenix 
Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, USA) at the National 
Institute on Aging (Baltimore, MD, USA).  Levodopa 
equivalent dose (LED) was calculated at each visit.12 
Changes in concurrent medication were allowed 
throughout the trial to minimise drop out. To prevent the 
possibility of adverse events compromising rater blinding, 
all adverse events, biochemical results, blood pressure, 
heart rate, and weight were recorded separately, by 
clinicians who were also masked to treatment allocation.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was change in MDS-UPDRS part 3 
scores in the practically defined off-medication state at 
60 weeks (ie, after any possible symptomatic effects of 
exenatide should have washed out). Predefined secondary

outcomes were differences between exenatide and placebo 
in each subsection of the MDS-UPDRS in the on-
medication state and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale at 
weeks 48 and 60. Additional secondary measures included 
frequency of adverse events, changes in vital signs, weight, 
and clinical laboratory values. Exploratory outcomes 
included between-group differences in dopamine trans-
porter availability as measured by DaTscan,13 timed motor 
tests in both off-medication and on-medication states, LED, 
3-day Hauser diary of Parkinson’s disease state, and scores 
on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale, Montgomery and 
Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Non-Motor Symptoms 
Severity Scale, Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire 39, and 
EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire.
Statistical analysis
All study analyses were done according to a predefined 
statistical analysis plan. To analyse the effect of treatment 
allocation on the primary outcome, we used a regression 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach to adjust for 
stratification factors (Hoehn and Yahr stage) and baseline 
raw MDS-UPDRS part 3 values. On the basis of previously 
collected pilot data9 and with a two-sided 5% significance 
level, we estimated that a sample size of 60 patients would 
be required to detect a difference of 5·8 MDS-UPDRS 
points between the two groups. These calculations were 
based on a common SD of 13, 90% power, and an overall 
type 1 error rate of 5%. Additionally, we assumed a 
correlation of 0·85 between baseline and follow-up MDS-
UPDRS measurements. All efficacy analyses were based 
on a modified intention-to-treat principle, which included 
all patients who completed any post-randomisation 
follow-up assessments.
Differences in continuous motor and non-motor 
outcome measures in the on-medication state were 
estimated with the same regression approach, which was 
adjusted for stratification factors, baseline scores, and 
any change from baseline in LED to account for the 
possible confounding effect of changes in Parkinson’s 
disease medications during the trial. Comparison of 
gastrointestinal adverse events between treatment 
groups was done with χ² tests. We used Pearson’s 
correlation to investigate a possible relation between 
noted treatment effects and potential confounding 
factors, such as weight loss and change in LED. A post-
hoc exploratory analysis of the primary outcome 
additionally adjusted for change from baseline in LED 
was also subsequently done to address the possibility that 
differential increases in LED could have confounded 
motor assessments even in the off-medication state.
We used statistical parametric mapping to quantitatively 
analyse DaTscan data. Baseline and delayed images for 
each participant were smoothed and coregistered before 
spatial normalisation into Montreal Neurological Institute 
space via a DaTscan template. We used a fully flexible 
model after image scaling to assess between-group 
differences in loss of DaTscan uptake between baseline 
and 60-week scans by ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline 
differences in DaTscan signal, Hoehn and Yahr stage, and 
change in LED at 60 weeks. Further analysis was also 
done to assess the differences in the changes between the 
two allocations. The resulting statistical parametric maps 
were masked to restrict differences to bilateral caudate 
and putamen regions at a height threshold of p less than 
0·01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, and an 
extent threshold of ten voxels.
We did a planned interim analysis after 60 participants 
completed 24 weeks’ follow-up. The change in MDS-
UPDRS part 3 score between baseline and 24 weeks was 
compared between groups and analysed by the trial 
statistician at UCL’s Comprehensive Clinical Trials Unit, 
who ensured that the trial team remained blinded to 
treatment allocations. The results of the interim analysis 
were communicated to the independent data-monitoring 
committee only, and recommendations to continue the

only, were communicated to both the trial steering 
committee and the study funders. We used STATA/MP 
and SPSS for all analyses.
Role of the funding source
The study funder had roles in study design and data 
interpretation, but no role in data collection or analysis, 
or writing of the Article. After the planned interim 
analysis, recommendations to continue the trial based on 
recruitment, and details about adverse event profiles 
were communicated to the funder, who remained 
blinded to individual treatment allocation. All authors 
had full access to all study data, and the corresponding 
author had responsibility for the final decision to submit 
the Article for publication.
Results
Between June 18, 2014, and March 13, 2015, 68 patients 
were screened for eligibility, 62 of whom were randomly 
assigned to either exenatide or placebo (figure 1). Patients 
randomly allocated to exenatide were slightly older, had 
higher baseline MDS-UPDRS part 3 scores, and had 
lower LED than did those assigned to placebo (table 1). 
Questionnaire responses and collection of empty drug 
vials at each visit suggested that compliance with study 
drugs was very high: 58 patients reported not missing a 
single dose (data not shown).
At 60 weeks, off-medication scores in MDS-UPDRS 
part 3 had worsened by 2·1 points (95% CI –0·6 to 4·8) 
in the placebo group and improved by 1·0 points 
(–2·6 to 0·7) in the exenatide group, a significant 
adjusted difference of –3·5 points (–6·7 to –0·3) 
favouring exenatide (p=0·0318; figure 2; table 2). At 
48 weeks, scores in the placebo group had deteriorated by 
1·7 points (–0·6 to 4·0) and those in the exenatide group 
had improved by 2·3 points (–4·1 to –0·7) points (table 2), 
resulting in a significant adjusted between-group 
difference of –4·3 points (–7·1 to –1·6; p=0·0026). On-
medication scores on MDS-UPDRS parts 1–4 did not 
differ significantly between groups at 48 or 60 weeks 
(table 2). Data were missing for only one participant at 
60 weeks, so we did not do sensitivity analyses for the 
primary outcome.
We noted no significant differences between the 
exenatide and placebo groups in scores on the Mattis 
Dementia Rating Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression 
Rating Scale, Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale, Non-
Motor Symptoms Severity Scale, Parkinson’s Disease 
Questionnaire summary index, or EuroQol Five 
Dimensions Questionnaire, nor in results on timed 
motor tests or Hauser diaries (table 3). Although no

significant difference was noted in total LED at 60 weeks 
between the groups, the mean increase in LED was 
19·6 mg higher in the exenatide than in the placebo 
group (table 3). In our post-hoc exploratory analysis 
adjusted for differences in LED from baseline, off-
medication scores in part 3 of the MDS-UPDRS were 
3·6 points (95% CI –6·8 to –0·4; p=0·0294) lower at 
60 weeks and 4·4 points (–7·2 to –1·6; 0·0023) lower at 
48 weeks in the exenatide group than in the placebo 
group. We noted no significant correlation between 
change in LED and change in the primary outcome 
(ρ=0·17; p=0·3588).
Statistical parametric mapping analysis contrasted to 
show regions with decreased DaTscan binding between 
the first and the second scan showed declines in both 
groups (figure 3). The contrasts suggested a reduced 
rate of decline of DaTscan binding in the exenatide 
group compared with the placebo group in the right 
putamen (x 22, y 8, z 22; T=2·98, 24 voxels; uncorrected 
p=0·0018), left putamen (–26, –18, 10; 2·76, 12 voxels;

11·7 pg/mL at 48 weeks. The frequency of adverse effects 
did not differ significantly between groups (table 4). 
Weight change occurred in both groups, but was more 
common in the exenatide than in the placebo group. At 
48 weeks, patients in the exenatide group had lost a mean 
of 2·6 kg (95% CI –4·0 to –1·2), whereas those in the 
control group had lost 0·6 kg (–1·9 to 0·8). We noted no 
significant correlation between the degree of weight loss 
and change in the primary outcome (ρ=0·30; p=0·0986). 
Other 
gastrointestinal 
symptoms 
associated 
with 
exenatide occurred in both groups, and the presence or 
absence of weight loss, nausea, loss of appetite, or 
abdominal pain was not significantly associated with 
treatment allocation (χ²=0·388; p=0·5330). Eight serious 
adverse events were recorded, six in the exenatide group 
and two in the placebo group; none were judged to be 
related to the study interventions. No other clinically 
relevant changes in biochemical indices or vital signs.
Three patients discontinued the study drug before 
48 weeks but continued follow-up assessments as per 
protocol. One patient in the exenatide group had 
asymptomatic hyperamylasaemia at 12 weeks (predefined 
as a rise greater than 50% above baseline concentrations 
and the laboratory reference range), and thus study drug 
was withdrawn. Two patients in the placebo group 
discontinued injections, one after 9 weeks because of 
worsening anxiety, the other after 36 weeks because of 
dyskinesia. An emergency unblinding procedure was 
necessary for one patient in the placebo group, who 
developed pancreatic cancer shortly after the end of the 
trial monitoring period.
Discussion
In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, single-centre trial, patients with Parkinson’s 
disease of moderate severity given exenatide for 48 weeks 
had a significant advantage of 3·5 points on part 3 of the 
MDS-UPDRS in an off-medication state compared with 
those given placebo 12 weeks after stopping exenatide. 
However, no significant differences were noted between 
the exenatide and placebo groups in scores on parts 1–4 of 
the MDS-UPDRS (in the on-medication state), or in 
assessments of cognition, mood, dyskinesia, non-motor 
symptoms, or quality of life. Frequency and severity of 
adverse events did not differ significantly between the two 
groups and were not significantly related to changes in 
motor scores.
Because of the fluctuating nature of symptom severity 
according to dopaminergic treatment, we did all study 
assessments in the early morning in the practically defined 
off-medication state. Patients with moderate disease 
experiencing wearing-off effects were preferentially 
recruited over those with de-novo or early-stage disease to 
increase the speed of recruitment and to minimise 
inclusion of patients with atypical forms of parkinsonism, 
the number of recruiting centres (thereby reducing costs), 
the risk of differential dropout among treatment-naive 
patients receiving placebo, and floor effects on rating 
assessment scales.
The simple washout trial design enabled faster and 
more cost-efficient data collection than would have been 
possible with more complex and expensive pivotal trial 
designs, such as delayed start, randomised withdrawal,

or long-term simple approaches. The single-centre 
nature eliminated inter-site variability in data collection, 
thereby potentially facilitating the detection of significant 
effects despite the small sample size, and resulted in an 
extremely low dropout rate (data for only one participant 
were missing for the primary outcome). That patients 
could seek medication adjustments via their treating 
clinicians throughout the trial, similar to routine clinical 
practice in Parkinson’s disease, could also have 
contributed to patient retention.
Exenatide was well tolerated. Previously recognised 
adverse effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms and 
injection-site reactions, occurred in similar frequencies 
in this patient group as have been previously reported in 
trials of people with diabetes,14 and did not affect 
compliance. Early observational studies15,16 suggested that 
exenatide could be associated with pancreatic cancer; 
however, a recent study showed no significant 
associations.17 Asymptomatic hyperamyl 
asaemia was 
reported in one patient in the exenatide group, 
necessitating drug withdrawal. Exenatide can induce 
amylase secretion in vitro, and increased amylase 
concentrations have been reported in patients with type 2 
diabetes treated with similar drugs.18 This effect is a 
possible explanation for the hyperamylasaemia, although 
the contribution of other comorbid disorders cannot be 
excluded. Patients in the exenatide group lost a mean of 
2·6 kg, which reversed on drug cessation. Excessive 
weight loss (>10% of BMI during 12 weeks) necessitated 
temporary withdrawal of the study drug in only 
one patient, who was in the placebo group.
Our study had several limitations. To ensure preservation 
of blinding of the rating of Parkinson’s disease severity, 
recording of adverse events and measurement of vital 
signs and weight was done by independent clinicians. 
However, patients might have been partly unblinded to 
their treatment allocation as a result of adverse effects 
(although injection site reactions were similar across both 
groups). Furthermore, the small size of our study meant 
that, despite randomisation with a block design according 
to Hoehn and Yahr status, the exenatide group had higher 
MDS-UPDRS part 3 scores and lower LED at baseline 
than the placebo group, necessitating adjustment in the 
primary 
analysis 
(although 
this 
adjustment 
was 
prespecified). Our statistical analyses suggest that none of 
the differences in outcome measures can be explained by 
differences in adverse events, baseline disease severity, 
or adjustment to conventional Parkinson’s disease 
medications.
To allow us to recruit patients already treated with 
dopaminergic replacement, we were compelled to use the 
practically defined off-medication MDS UPDRS part 3 
scores as our primary outcome. Although this measure 
provides a better insight into disease severity than do on-
medication scores, additional variability in scores could 
be due to differences in timing since last dose of 
Parkinson’s disease medication, despite the consistent 
instructions given to patients and all assessments being 
done at consistent times in the morning. This possibility 
deserves consideration, especially because the differences 
we noted in off-medication scores were not supported by 
significant differences in clinical secondary outcomes. 
This absence of significant differences between groups is 
likely to be partly because of the major effects of 
dopaminergic replacement on any scores assessed in the 
on-medication state (which reflects the usual situation of 
patients). Whether the absences of significant differences 
between groups in off-medication timed tests or Hauser 
diaries could be related to differences in the sensitivity or 
precision within these measures, the small sample size, 
or disease stage of the population needs to be further 
explored.
We noted little evidence of any placebo effect in the 
control group. By contrast, in the exenatide group, 
improvements in MDS-UPDRS part 3 scores were already 
detectable at 12 weeks, suggesting possible symptomatic 
effects on Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, the benefits

noted in the exenatide group were greater at 48 weeks 
than at 60 weeks, which is again potentially indicative of a 
symptomatic 
effect. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
persisting 
improvements in MDS-UPDRS part 3 scores at 60 weeks 
suggests that exenatide could have a longer-lasting effect 
on disease severity beyond conventional drug effects on 
dopaminergic receptors.
The demonstration that exenatide might have novel 
symptomatic effects is an important discovery in treatment 
of Parkinson’s disease. Preclinical studies5,19 suggest that 
exenatide can normalise dopaminergic function in 
lesioned rodents, but whether symptomatic effects relate 
to improvement in functioning in surviving dopaminergic 
neurons or to changes to the pharmacokinetics of 
levodopa or other dopaminergic therapies requires further 
study. Beyond the identification of a drug that could have 
novel symptomatic effects in Parkinson’s disease, our 
original aim and study design was to assess whether the 
long-lasting advantages we previously noted in an open-
label trial might be reproducible in a placebo-controlled 
study. We have reported significant between-group 
differences in our primary outcome, and thus further 
investigation into exenatide as a disease-modifying 
treatment for Parkinson’s disease is warranted.
Distinguishing between long-lasting symptomatic 
effects 
and 
effects 
on 
underlying 
disease 
pathophysiology has been previously discussed, but no 
simple solutions have emerged.20,21 Most notably, 
rasagiline, which is approved for symptomatic 
treatment in Parkinson’s disease, showed inconclusive 
results in a delayed-start study22 designed to assess 
effects on disease progression. In our trial, it might be 
tempting to view persistent benefits detectable after the 
washout period as evidence of disease modification. 
Although exenatide was undetectable in the serum at 
60 weeks, the 12-week washout period might have been 
insufficient to eliminate unexpected long-lasting 
symptomatic effects, which could have contributed to 
the benefits in motor function and other modalities. 
Indeed, the severity of Parkinson’s disease can be 
altered 
by 
symptomatic 
therapies 
that 
induce 
preservation of healthy behaviours, such as exercise, 
which can have long-term effects without changing the 
underlying neuropathological process.23
The possibility that exenatide has neuroprotective 
effects is supported by robust preclinical studies, which 
suggest that exenatide affects pathological mechanisms 
relevant to Parkinson’s disease.24 These effects include 
inhibitory effects on inflammation,5,8 promotion of 
mitochondrial biogenesis,25,26 neurotrophic effects,27,28 
stimulation of neurogenesis,7 and restoration of neuronal 
insulin signalling.29 Whether some or all of these 
mechanisms contributed to the clinical effects in our 
study cannot be definitively established, but one or 
several of these mechanisms could have acted in synergy 
to promote cell survival, preserve compensatory 
responses, and prevent maladaptive responses.
In our DaTscan analysis, we used statistical parametric 
mapping, which is a modern approach for the statistical 
analysis of imaging changes that allows for adjustment 
of baseline differences30 and has been used previously in 
clinical trials in Parkinson’s disease.31 Although overall 
uptake of DaTscan fell in both groups, a quantitative 
analysis suggested a possible reduced rate of decline in 
the exenatide group. However, because this signal was 
detectable only at uncorrected height thresholds of 
p=0·0034 or less, these data would benefit from larger

confirmatory studies or studies of patients at an earlier 
disease stage when the rate of change of DaTscan uptake 
is greater,32 making group differences more readily 
detectable.
Exenatide did not seem to significantly improve 
disease severity or participants’ quality of life beyond 
effects resulting from dopaminergic replacement. A 
long-term simple multi-site trial design will be necessary 
to establish the long-term effects of exenatide treatment 
on daytime function in Parkinson’s disease and 
specifically whether exenatide can delay the development 
of levodopa-refractory symptoms. Furthermore, since 
the development of exenatide, additional GLP-1 receptor 
agonists have been developed that are based on the 
structure of either exendin-4 or human GLP-1. 
Comparative clinical efficacy data to support the use of 
one drug over another are scarce, but some studies33,34 
suggest significant differences in glycaemic control and 
frequency of adverse events with different GLP-1 
receptor agonists in diabetes trials, and preliminary 
data35,36 suggest that some might exert greater 
neuroprotective effects than others. Our study has 
shown for the first time (to our knowledge) that 
exenatide given at a dose licensed for type 2 diabetes can 
cross the blood–brain barrier and access the CSF in 
concentrations equivalent to those in preclinical models 
of Parkinson’s disease associated with advantageous 
outcomes.6,27 However, further studies of the safety, 
efficacy, and CNS penetration of other members of this 
drug class, in parallel with mechanism-of-action studies, 
will help to clarify the eventual role that GLP-1 receptor 
agonists 
might 
have 
in 
Parkinson’s 
disease. 
Furthermore, the potential relevance of these drugs to 
other neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Alzheimer’s 
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s 
disease, multiple sclerosis) and other neurological 
diseases (eg, cerebrovascular disorders, traumatic brain 
injury) is being assessed in preclinical studies and 
clinical trials.34
We have replicated the findings from our previous 
open-label study and shown that, compared with placebo, 
exenatide treatment is associated with positive and 
persistent effects on off-medication motor scores as 
measured by MDS-UPDRS part 3. Whether this drug acts 
as a novel symptomatic agent, influences compensatory 
responses or behaviours, or has neuroprotective effects 
on underlying pathology is unclear, but there is a strong 
indication that GLP-1 receptor agonists may have a useful 
role in future treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
