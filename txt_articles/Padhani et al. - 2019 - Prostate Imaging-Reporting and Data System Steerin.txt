Abstract
Context: The Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2 analysis system for
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) detection of prostate cancer (PCa) is
based on PI-RADS v1, accumulated scientific evidence, and expert consensus opinion.
Objective: To summarize the accuracy, strengths and weaknesses of PI-RADS v2, discuss
pathway implications of its use and outline opportunities for improvements and future
developments.
Evidence acquisition: For this consensus expert opinion from the PI-RADS steering
committee, clinical studies, systematic reviews, and professional guidelines for mpMRI
PCa detection were evaluated. We focused on the performance characteristics of PI-
RADS v2, comparing data to systems based on clinicoradiologic Likert scales and non–PI-
RADS v2 imaging only. Evidence selections were based on high-quality, prospective,
histologically verified data, with minimal patient selection and verifications biases.
Evidence synthesis: It has been shown that the test performance of PI-RADS v2 in research
and clinical practice retains higher accuracy over systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
biopsies for PCa diagnosis. PI-RADS v2 fails to detect all cancers but does detect the majority
of tumors capable of causing patient harm, which should not be missed. Test performance
depends on the definition and prevalence of clinically significant disease. Good performance
can be attained in practice when the quality of the diagnostic process can be assured,
together with joint working of robustly trained radiologists and urologists, conducting
biopsy procedures within multidisciplinary teams.
Conclusions: It has been shown that the test performance of PI-RADS v2 in research and
clinical practice is improved, retaining higher accuracy over systematic TRUS biopsies for
PCa diagnosis.
Patient summary: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-direct-
ed biopsies using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System improves the
detection of prostate cancers likely to cause harm, and at the same time decreases
the detection of disease that does not lead to harms if left untreated. The keys to success
are high-quality imaging, reporting, and biopsies by radiologists and urologists working
together in multidisciplinary teams.

Introduction
The diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) differs from that for
other solid organ cancers, where imaging is used to identify
patients who require biopsies and the lesions that need to
be targeted. Instead, the standard PCa diagnostic pathway
offers transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsies with
multiple needles, with systematic sampling of the entire
prostate gland without knowledge of the likely locations of
tumors. Patients chosen for this approach include biopsy-
naïve men with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE),
those deemed to be at persistent elevated risk of harboring
significant cancers despite prior negative TRUS biopsies,
and men with low-risk PCa undergoing active surveillance
(AS), who need repeated prostate gland sampling for
disease monitoring.
The noncancer specific causes of elevated PSA, the semi-
randomness and intrinsic sampling errors of the TRUS
biopsy procedure, the variable prevalence of PCa among
men at risk [1], and the wide genomic diversity and range of
prognoses for men with PCa lead to multiple clinical
impacts for men with elevated risks. (1) A large proportion
of men undergoing TRUS biopsies do not have any cancers
detected [2]; these unfruitful biopsies still incur attendant
morbidities [3] without giving complete surety on the
absence of significant disease capable of causing patient
harm. (2) Overdiagnosis of clinically unimportant cancers
occurs and contributes unnecessarily to patient anxieties
[4], leading to overtreatment and treatment-related harm,
with benefits for limited groups of patients [5,6]. (3)
Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of clinically important
cancers also occur because of tissue sampling and risk
stratification errors, contributing to diagnostic and treat-
ment failures, particularly for patients opting for AS.
2.
Clinical priorities for PCa diagnosis
2.1.
Minimizing overdiagnosis and detecting clinically
significant PCa are joint priorities for biopsy-naı
¨ve men
Low 10-yr PCa-specific mortality rates among menwith low-
risk PCa and the need to avoid overdiagnosis, overtreatment,
and treatment-related harm are the driving reasons for the
US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2017 draft
recommendations discouraging the use of PSA screening for
older men. On the other hand, there is also an important
need to improve the detection of prostate cancers that do
require active treatments, to decrease prostate cancer
specific death rates. These considerations were emphasized
by recent publications, of two large prospective observa-
tional studies (ProtecT 2016 and PIVOT 2017).
The ProtecT study showed that active treatment of low-
risk disease, had minimal patient survival benefits [6]. The
results showed no cancer-specific 10-years survival differ-
ences between active therapies (surgery and radiotherapy)
and active monitoring but did note that surgery delayed the
time-to-metastasis development. These data suggest that
TRUS biopsy-based pathologic misclassifications can have
long-term clinical impacts on monitored patients with
undiagnosed higher grades of disease. The updated PIVOT
study results on 731 patients, suggested that the benefits of
surgery compared to disease monitoring, occur in selected
patients. After a median 12.7 years (range, 12-19.5) of
follow-up, there was a non-statistically significant differ-
ence in prostate cancer specific mortality rates in favor of
surgery (hazard ratio (HR) of 0.63 (p = 0.06)). Sub-analyses
suggested, that surgery is most likely to achieve mortality
reductions in intermediate-risk patients (absolute differ-
ence, -14.5%, non-significant) but not for those with low or
high-risk disease.
2.2.
Detecting aggressive PCa locations is the clinical priority in
men with a prior negative biopsy and AS patients
The primary motivation for repeating biopsies in patients
with prior negative biopsies and persistently elevated or
rising PSA is the concern that clinically significant PCa
(csPCa) was missed on prior biopsies. Extended saturation
biopsies in patients with a prior negative biopsy have
shown that systematic 10–12-core TRUS biopsies miss
csPCa in anterior and apical locations in a substantial
proportion
of
patients
[7].
Uncertainty
in
accurately
assigning risk status also contributes to active management
for men with low-risk disease who might be suitable for AS.
For example, prostatectomy specimen examinations from
low-risk
patients
have
found
unfavorable
pathologic
characteristics in 20-36% [8,9]. Similarly, template mapping
biopsies in potential AS candidates or patients undergoing
AS demonstrate 30-40% pathologic misclassification rates
[10–12]. These pathologic misclassification errors contrib-
ute to high AS discontinuation rates of up to 52% by 5 yr,
many of which are because of pathologic upgrading or
upstaging detected on follow-up [13–15]. Improved risk
stratification tools are therefore needed to better direct
patient management [8].
3.
Addressing clinical needs in PCa diagnosis
Multiple universal clinical needs and priorities can be
identified for men who are at high risk of harms from PCa.
These include (1) determining the causes of elevated PSA,
and whether elevated PSA can be ascribed to the presence of
csPCa; (2) reducing the number of investigations, including
biopsies, needed to determine the cause(s) of elevated PSA,
while at the same time minimizing the number of men
overdiagnosed with low-risk disease; (3) improving the
detection and anatomic localization of csPCa to allow
appropriate, directed biopsy for improving risk stratifica-
tion for diagnosed patients and thereby customizing their
clinical care; and (4) minimizing the time taken to arrive at
final diagnoses and to start risk-appropriate treatment(s).
These priorities and clinical needs should be met at
reasonable costs.
Many tools are being developed to meet the clinical
needs for more accurate PCa diagnoses. The emerging
clinical paradigm is to use advances in both imaging and
molecular diagnostics [16–19] to better select patients
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 5 ( 2 0 19 ) 3 8 5 – 3 9 6

 requiring biopsy. The developing idea is that the combined
use of PSA metrics (PSA, PSA density [PSAD], PSA velocity),
PSA isoform assays such as the prostate health index (PHI)
and 4Kscore, and urinary PCa gene methylation tests can act
as multivariate risk estimators to identify patients likely to
harbor csPCa. However, patient selection methods based on
risk calculators cannot localize csPCa within the gland,
which may be missed by systematic biopsy. Diagnostic
yields of biopsy procedures can be increased by using
imaging to refine patient selections [20–23], and thereafter
to direct biopsies to suspicious locations, thus reducing the
number of men undergoing biopsy and consequently
overtreatments of men with insignificant disease [24]. Cen-
tral to these developments are the emerging roles of
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and
MR-directed biopsy (MRDB; refers to all biopsy methods
using prior mpMRI information) for PCa diagnosis and
treatment selection.
4.
Prostate mpMRI
A large body of research and clinical experience on
combined mpMRI-MRDB for PCa diagnosis supports the
value of mpMRI for the detection and localization of csPCa
[2,25–28].
The
mpMRI-MRDB
approach
increases
the
diagnostic yield of larger Gleason score (GS) 3 + 3 and
higher-grade (GS � 3 + 4) csPCa using fewer biopsy cores
[24,28–30]. This approach also decreases the detection of
insignificant disease [28,31] and improves risk stratification
for diagnosed patients
[32].
There
are challenges in
implementing prostate mpMRI-MRDB in clinical practice,
including heterogeneity of image quality between centers
[33] and consequently variations in the diagnostic perfor-
mance for PCa detection [34]. Specifically, prostate mpMRI
quality depends on MRI equipment capabilities (including
equipment vendor, magnet field and gradient strength, coil
set used, software and hardware levels, sequence parameter
choices), patient factors (medications, body habitus, mo-
tion, metal implants, rectal gas), biopsy-related prostate
gland hemorrhage, and most importantly the radiologic
interpretation of images (learning curve effects, subjectivity
of observations, interobserver variations, and reporting
styles).
To
address
these
challenges,
it
has
become
necessary to develop imaging, quality, and reporting
standards for prostate mpMRI, and accreditation standards
for the future.
5.
PI-RADS
The Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2
(PI-RADS v2) was designed by the joint steering committee
of the American College of Radiology (ACR), the European
Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) and the AdMeTech
Foundation [35]. The aims for PI-RADS v2 were to simplify
and standardize the terminology and content of mpMRI
prostate reports, to develop assessment categories that
summarize levels of suspicion for csPCa, to assist in the
selection of patients for biopsies and management, to
establish acceptable technical parameters for mpMRI, and
to reduce variability in imaging interpretations. It should
also be noted that PI-RADS v2 does not directly address the
quality standards needed for MR-guided biopsy (MRGB),
which is addressed elsewhere [36].
PI-RADS v2 was built on the foundation of PI-RADS v1
[37], but there are important differences between the two
systems [38]. For example, PI-RADS v2 does not include
spectroscopic imaging, and dynamic contrast enhancement
MRI (DCE-MRI) is relegated to a clarification role for
peripheral
zone
(PZ)
assessments.
Instead,
diffusion-
weighted imaging (DWI) has been given greater emphasis
for evaluation of the PZ and less emphasis in transition zone
(TZ) assessments. Likewise, T2-weighted (T2W) features
have a greater emphasis for TZ evaluations.
It is important to note that there are a range of malignant
and benign pathologies in the prostate gland that have
overlapping mpMRI characteristics [39]. Therefore, a low PI-
RADS assessment category of 2 does not completely exclude
the possibility of csPCa; rather, it simply indicates that it is
unlikely. Similarly, assessment category 5 is not proof that a
lesion is csPCa, but rather indicates that it is highly likely.
The range of likelihood of cancer depends on the study
population and the method(s) used for histologic verifica-
tion, as discussed in more detail below.
There are multiple distinguishing features between the
imaging-only PI-RADS
v2
system,
other
non–PI-RADS
imaging systems, and clinicoradiologic Likert impressions
[40–45], whose performance for disease detection has been
reported in the literature [2,26,44,45]. It is important to
note that PI-RADS v2 assessment categories are based on
combinations of predefined mpMRI features, weighted for
the likelihood of malignancy, to be evaluated in a specified
order, separately for lesions in the PZ and TZ. Other systems
use additional non–PI-RADS imaging criteria (such as
number of sequences on which abnormalities are visible
and the scaled likelihood of extraprostatic extension [43])
or subjectively incorporate clinical factors such as family
history, DRE findings, PSA, and PSAD to arrive at clinicor-
adiologic impressions of the likelihood of csPCa [36]. How-
ever, to promote standardization and reduce observer
variability,
PI-RADS
v2
reduces
flexibility
in
imaging
interpretations. Thus, PI-RADS has developed into the
universal standard for prostate mpMRI interpretation and
reporting. Note that PI-RADS v2 also does not assign specific
management
algorithms
for
the
PI-RADS
assessment
categories, acknowledging the essential contribution of
clinical features to patient decision-making.

Prostate mpMRI validation
6.1.
Radiologic-pathologic correlations
Detailed mpMRI-prostatectomy histologic correlation stud-
ies have shown improved visibility of larger [46–49],
higher-grade lesions [46,48,49] with noncribriform pattern
[50],
the
latter
applying
mostly
to
index
lesions
[46,51,52]. As a guide, GS 3 + 3 lesions with a solid growth
pattern need to have a volume of �0.5 ml (approx. 9–10-
mm-diameter sphere) to be detected. Index lesions with a
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 5 ( 2 0 19 ) 3 8 5 – 3 9 6
387
 primary GS � 3 + 4 pattern with a volume �0.2 ml (approx.
7–8-mm-diameter sphere) can also be identifiable in some
studies undertaken on modern 3-T scanners using endor-
ectal coils for signal reception [47,51,52]. However, it should
be noted that although most index lesions can be detected
[46], nonindex lesions are often overlooked, even if they are
of high grade, and the size of lesions is often underestimated
[53].
The PI-RADS v2 system does not aim to detect all
prostate tumors, with poorer sensitivity for lower-volume
(<0.5 ml) GS 3 + 3 disease, which is unlikely to cause patient
harm (low-risk PCa). This allows mpMRI-MRDB to address
the USPSTF concerns of overdiagnosis and overtreatment
(https://screeningforprostatecancer.org/ [5,6]) and to re-
duce the number of men undergoing biopsies while on AS.
Indeed, a negative mpMRI (PI-RADS 1 and 2 assessment
categories) in the context of selecting patients for AS
indicates likely patient suitability [54]. In the same way, a
negative mpMRI is an independent predictor for likely
downgrading of GS 3 + 4 at TRUS biopsy to GS 3 + 3 at
prostatectomy pathology [55].
As expected, larger, higher-grade lesions are more likely
to be detected and to have higher PI-RADS assessment
categories (PI-RADS categories 4 and 5) [53,56,57]. Detailed
radiologic-pathologic correlation studies using the PI-RADs
v2 system are not numerous, but do show that smaller,
nonindex csPCa foci with a cribriform pattern [50] go
undetected or their sizes are underestimated [53], which
can have significant implications for PCa detection and
gland-sparing therapies. There is an ongoing need to further
improve
our
understanding
of
the
characteristics
of
detected and undetected cancers by PI-RADS v2 assessment
categories, including sensitivity by size, GS, pathologic
pattern, and
index lesion status, using the
methods
described by Le et al [46].
6.2.
PI-RADS v2 test-performance
Multiple patient- and lesion-level analyses have shown that
PI-RADS v2 assessment categories are effective for in-situ
cancer detection, with increases in the predictive value for
each increment in PI-RADS assessment category for all
cancers and csPCa. The largest validation study reported on
data prospectively collected for biopsy-naïve patients at
three high-volume tertiary care centers and used both PI-
RADS systems [58]. Patients underwent 18–24-core sys-
tematic transperineal biopsies and additional targeted
biopsies for positive mpMRI findings (Ginsburg biopsy
scheme [59]). Among 807 patients there was a csPCa (GS �
3 + 4) prevalence of 49%. The investigators found that the
csPCa prevalence increased with the PI-RADS assessment
category: PI-RADS 1–2, 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]
15–25%), PI-RADS 3, 31% (95% CI 25–38%); and PI-RADS 4–5,
71% (95% CI 67–75%).
In a large retrospective analysis of in-bore targeted
biopsies among 1057 patients (first biopsy, n = 184; prior
negative biopsy, n = 649; active surveillance, n = 224), csPCa
(GS � 3 + 4) was found in 17%, 34%, and 67% of patients with
PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 lesions, respectively [27]. Another study
among 339 biopsy-naïve patients using TRUS targeting and
12-core systematic biopsy found csPCa (GS � 3 + 4) in
737 targets in 0%, 10%, 12%, 22%, and 72% of cases in the PI-
RADS 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 categories, respectively [25]. In a
retrospective
study,
Greer et
al
[60]
assessed
lesion
detection using PI-RADS v2 criteria for 163 patients
assessed by nine readers; 654 lesions (including 420 PZ
lesions) were compared with whole-mount prostatectomy
findings for 110 patients and systematic biopsies for
50 patients. The probability of cancer detection incremen-
tally increased with the PI-RADS v2 category (16%, 33%, 71%,
and 91% for PI-RADS 2, 3, 4, and 5 lesions, respectively). This
study also confirmed the dominant sequence concept
incorporated into the PI-RADS v2 system, but only for PZ
lesions and not for T2W over DWI in the TZ. Furthermore,
Greer et al [60] also documented meaningful contributions
by DCE-MRI to diagnostic yields in the PZ for assessment
categories 2–4. We encourage further studies evaluating the
multireader performance of the PI-RADS v2 criteria with
whole-mount
histopathology,
and
evaluations
of
the
dominant sequence concept and the contribution of DCE-
MRI to observer performance.
High PI-RADS v2 performance has also been confirmed
by systematic reviews and meta-analyses [61,62], including
an analysis of 3857 patients that showed that PI-RADS v2
had pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 86–92%) with
specificity of 73% (95% CI 60–83%) for PCa detection
[61]. Comparative data have also shown that PI-RADS v2
performs better than PI-RADS v1. For example, in a
retrospective study comparing PI-RAD v1 to PI-RADS v2
readings in guiding TRUS prostate biopsy in 401 consecutive
patients, both PI-RADS versions showed good diagnostic
performance, but in the TZ the performance of v2 was better
[63]. In a meta-analysis of six head-to-head PI-RADS v1 and
v2 comparison studies, PI-RADS v2 had higher pooled
sensitivity of 95% (95% CI 85–98%), compared to 88% (95% CI
80–93%) for PI-RADS v1 (p = 0.04). However, the pooled
specificity was not significantly different (73% [95% CI 47–
89%] vs 75% [95% CI 36–94]; p = 0.90) [61]. Further studies
using PI-RADS v2 and MRDB in various population groups
(biopsy-naïve, prior negative TRUS, AS cohorts, Eastern/
Western populations [61,62,64]) are needed to develop
robust estimates of PCa likelihood corresponding to the PI-
RADS assessment categories.
It is important to remember that the combined perfor-
mance of mpMRI-MRDB is strongly influenced by the
respective limitations of both procedures separately and in
combination. Heterogeneity of PI-RADS v2 results appears
to be related to multiple factors, including the definitions
used for csPCa, the prevalence of csPCa in different study
populations, mixing of study populations within studies,
reference standards used for verification, radiologic exper-
tise and variations in technical performance, and limitations
specific to the MRDB procedure used [61,62]. Limitations of
MRDB approaches relate to the method used for lesion
targeting (in-bore, MR-US fusion, cognitive) and biopsy
errors (fusion method, biopsy route, operator expertise,
number of cores taken, lesion sampling strategy, lesion
histology, and lesion and gland volumes) [30,65–68].

Supportive validation data from recent non–PI-RADS
studies
In an attempt to minimize multiple study biases in
literature data, the PROMIS study prospectively bench-
marked the diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI before a first
prostate biopsy [2]. PROMIS evaluated the accuracy of
mpMRI for detecting csPCa in biopsy-naïve patients in
comparison to the current standard of TRUS biopsy, using
transperineal prostate mapping biopsy (TPMB) for verifica-
tion. 576 men evaluated in 11 centers underwent three
tests: (1) PI-RADS–compliant mpMRI using 1.5-T systems
(no endorectal coil) with image interpretation by trained
radiologists who did not use the PI-RADS system (instead
using the University College London Likert impression
system); (2) standard TRUS biopsies; and (3) TPMB with 5-
mm sampling of the entire gland. Blinding to the three tests
allowed pairwise comparison of mpMRI and TRUS biopsy
results with a high level of confidence for assessing relative
diagnostic accuracy.
On TPMB, 408 of 576 men (71%) had PCa; 230 (40%) had
csPCa (according to a primary definition of GS � 4 + 3 and/or
any lesion with a maximum cancer core length of �6 mm).
The predictive value increased stepwise with increments in
the Likert impression score; for Likert scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5 scores, csPCa was found in 3%, 12%, 21%, 58%, and 81% of
cases, respectively. mpMRI was more sensitive (93%; 95% CI
88–96%) than TRUS biopsy (48%; 95% CI 42–55%) but less
specific (41%, 95% CI 36–46% vs 96%, 95% CI 94–98%). Since
there are differing views on the definition of csPCa on TPMB,
the results for other pathologic definitions were also
studied. For the most commonly used literature definition
of csPCa (GS � 3 + 4), TRUS biopsy had sensitivity of 48%,
meaning that TRUS misses 52% of csPCas, while mpMRI
missed 12% (sensitivity 88%). For clarity, it should be noted
that there was no spatial concordance between mpMRI
findings and TPMB positivity, which may have affected
lesion-based mpMRI sensitivity within PROMIS.
The consistently higher sensitivity and more variable
specificity in all mpMRI studies using PI-RADS v1, PI-RADS
v2, non–PI-RADS imaging systems, and clinicoradiologic
Likert impressions indicate that the “rule out” performance
of mpMRI is better than its “rule in” performance for csPCa,
meaning that biopsies are required for positive mpMRI
scans to confirm the presence of csPCa. The more powerful
“rule out” performance (higher sensitivity and negative
predictive value [NPV]) has important clinical implications
for men with negative scans, as discussed in the section on
mpMRI
pathway
impacts
and
in
the
Supplementary
material. A degree of caution is needed when applying
the results of the better “rule out” performance to clinical
practice. It must be remembered that the NPV is inversely
related to disease prevalence, which is highly variable,
meaning that patients selected for mpMRI assessments are
not uniform in the literature [1].
Practice-changing adoption of mpMRI-MRDB therefore
requires combined use of clinical parameters and mpMRI
findings if we are to take full advantage of the intrinsic
excellent sensitivity of mpMRI. It should also be noted that
most
reports
are
retrospective
evaluations
in
which
suboptimal image data sets are often excluded from
analyses. Therefore, more weight should be given to results
from prospective analyses. Furthermore, many studies use
histologic verification in prostatectomy specimens and thus
suffer from selection biases, while other studies use MRDB
as its own reference standard, which involves intrinsic
verification bias. In addition, studies performed at high-
volume expert centers with the advantages of state-of-the-
art equipment, optimized protocols, and radiologists highly
experienced in subspecialties reduce the generalizability of
published results.
7.
Addressing PI-RADS v2 limitations
PI-RADS v2 has been a major advance towards high-
precision PCa diagnosis, but accrued clinical experience has
highlighted limitations [69]. Of note, moderate interob-
server variability has been identified, even among expert
readers
[70–73]
and
particularly
for
TZ
evaluations
[73]. This appears to be related in part to the inherent
limitations of the accrued mpMRI data and ambiguities in
the application of some of the diagnostic criteria. For
example, PI-RADS v2 does not fully explain how to handle
lesions that appear to arise solely from the central zone
[74], and it does not provide separate guidance on
image interpretation of anterior-superior tumors substan-
tially involving the anterior fibromuscular stroma. In
addition, PI-RADS v2 is unclear regarding the distinction
between DWI scores of 3 and 4/5, and for DCE positivity for
nonfocal lesions in the PZ; both contributing to greater
inter-reader variability. Furthermore, PI-RADS v2 does not
sufficiently address how to classify likely nodular benign
prostatic hyperplasia, which does not have the classic
appearance of encapsulation. These limitations will be
addressed by PI-RADS v2.1, together with other minor
changes regarding data acquisition parameters and the
sector map. While the adoption of these PI-RADS v2.1
amendments will not change the overall test-performance,
it is hoped that PI-RADS v2.1 will improve the mpMRI inter-
reader variability.
PI-RADS remains a living document and continued
evolution is anticipated as further clinical experience and
investigative data are accrued. Efforts are already under way
to expand and adapt PI-RADS to meet a variety of needs in
the evolving paradigms for MRI use in PCa care. This
includes clinical recommendations on tissue sampling
needs and methods according to mpMRI findings, and the
use of mpMRI for selection of patients who are suitable for
gland-sparing therapies such as focal ablation and AS. It is
anticipated that the next major PI-RADS revision will be a
multiyear endeavor requiring additional research data on
PI-RADS criteria [43] and clinical usage. A variety of
proposals for inclusion have been tabled, but the literature
evidence for inclusion is highly variable to date. The PI-
RADS committee therefore encourages additional investi-
gations in areas highlighted in Supplementary Table 1; the
strength of evidence from investigations will inform future
PI-RADS guidance development.

Diagnostic pathway impacts
Multiple analyses have shown the ability of mpMRI-MRDB
to increase the effectiveness of PCa diagnosis pathways
[28,75–81], with the following benefits highlighted: (1)
greater precision in determining tumor grade and volume
(thus benefiting risk stratification); (2) potential increases
in the rate of detection of significant disease; (3) potential
reductions in diagnosis of indolent disease (thus reducing
overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and patients undergoing
biopsies on AS); (4) fewer targeted biopsies per patient,
potentially reducing complication rates; and (5) reducing
the total number of patients undergoing biopsies without
significantly reducing the overall detection rate of csPCa.
These advantages have been demonstrated in prospective
and retrospective analyses in all major PCa diagnostic groups.
For example, three of four single-institution randomized
controlled trials revealed higher diagnostic rates and higher
rates of csPCa detection in biopsy-naïve patients [81–84]. The
recently published PRECISION trial confirms these findings;
the results are generalizable owing to its international
multicenter design and pragmatism [28]. Nonrandomized
studies also indicate that mpMRI-MRDB limits the over-
detection of insignificant disease [2,26,31].
mpMRI can reduce overdiagnosis of indolent disease
because of its high NPV [1], and thus can potentially limit the
number of patients undergoing biopsy after a negative test.
However, as we have already noted, NPV is highly dependent
on the csPCa target definition (and its prevalence). The
PRECISION study showed that 28% of biopsy-naïve men
could
avoid
biopsy
after
a
negative
mpMRI
without
compromising the detection of csPCa [28]. This confirms
the literature projections for avoiding TRUS biopsy, overdi-
agnosis, and overtreatment [75–81]. The PROMIS trial results
suggest that for csPCa prevalence of 53% (GC � 3 + 4), 27% of
biopsy-naïve patients with negative mpMRI could avoid a
biopsy, with an underdiagnosis rate of 24% [2]. The large
study by Hansen et al [58] suggests that 29% of patients
might avoid biopsy, with an underdiagnosis rate of 20% for
GS � 3 + 4 prevalence of 49%.
Further prospective
studies are comparing targeted
mpMRI-MRDB using PI-RADS v2 and systematic 10–12-core
TRUS biopsy for biopsy-naïve patients. The multicenter
prospective MRI-First (NCT02485379) and 4 M (NTR5555)
studies are head-to-head comparisons of mpMRI-MRGB and
TRUS biopsy yields in the same patients, examining the
impact of biopsy strategy on detection of csPCa and
insignificant cancers, the number of men requiring biopsy,
and biopsy core number, with minimum follow-up of >1 yr
in the 4 M study. The Canadian Urology Research Consortium
PRECISE study (NCT02936258) has a similar design and
objectives to the PRECISION trial, but men will be followed
for 2 yr, compared to shorter follow-up in the PRECISION
trial. Other studies, including INNOVATE (NCT02689271) and
4 M (NTR5555), are evaluating the use of blood and urine
biomarkers for better selection of patients who would
benefit from diagnostic mpMRI-MRDB [85].
Accumulated data have been incorporated into decision
tree and decision-curve analyses [86,87] and cost-effec-
tiveness studies [75–77,79,88], and the results have helped

 to promote the uptake of mpMRI in clinical practice. As a
result, mpMRI use has been incorporated into multiple
national and international clinical care guidelines, mostly in
the clinical setting of a prior negative biopsy [89–91] and for
patients choosing AS [91]. Pathway benefits of mpMRI
inclusion can only accrue if there are mpMRI-directed
management impacts. Consensus guidance has emerged on
the practicalities of mpMRI-MRDB use in the care of
patients with a prior negative biopsy. Detailed recommen-
dations on acceptable actions for negative, indeterminate,
and positive mpMRI findings are outlined in Fig.1, discussed
in the Supplementary material, and summarized in Table 1
[91–93]. However, there are few established guidelines on
mpMRI-directed management actions for biopsy-naïve
patients. Guidance on mpMRI use for biopsy-naïve patients
may follow reports from the PRECISION, MRI-First, and 4 M
studies, although mpMRI is already being used in this
setting in some European countries and Australia [36]. Strat-
egies to mitigate overdiagnosis among biopsy-naïve men
might include the following: (1) risk-based preselection of
men to undergo mpMRI [94]; (2) most men at lower clinical
risk with negative mpMRI should not undergo biopsy and be
returned to appropriate clinical care [20]; and (3) at least
initially, MRDB should only target visualized abnormalities
(no systematic sampling) [28].
These proposed mpMRI-directed actions are contested
between radiologists and urologists [95], among urologists,
and between different guidelines because of insufficient
data on the full range and frequency of pathologies for PI-
RADS assessment categories. Clinicians point to the absence
of robust data showing that overall csPCa detection rates are
not compromised by the use of mpMRI-MRDB alone for
biopsy-naïve patients (although this criticism is now
tempered by the PRECISION trial data [28]), despite
acknowledging the disadvantages of overdiagnosis when
additional
systematic
TRUS
biopsies
are
incorporated
[26,31,96]. Discussions will be further clarified by the
upcoming data from the
MRI-First and
4 M
studies.
Therefore, decision-making on a patient, clinical center,
and health-system basis requires multidisciplinary engage-
ment with active stakeholders and consideration of the
central role of mpMRI-MRDB in the diagnostic process.
9.
Contributing to value-based health care
To demonstrate the heath value of mpMRI-MRDB in PCa
detection for greater clinical adoption and to obtain
reimbursement, it will be necessary to obtain robust
estimates of key performance measures that reflect the
effectiveness of incorporating mpMRI-MRDB in diagnostic
pathways. Value-based metrics are scarce in the literature,
but have been modeled in cost-effectiveness studies [75–
81,88]. Multiple real-world (as opposed to model estimates)
performance indices are needed to compare the mpMRI-
MRDB approach to the current pathway (Supplementary
Table 1) in relevant patient groups.
For example, given the potential for reducing overdiag-
nosis of insignificant cancer, the magnitude of the impact on
overtreatment and on AS programs must be accurately
assessed in a variety of health care delivery environments
(eg, public vs private health systems; underdeveloped vs
developed countries; Eastern vs Western populations). It
will also be necessary to obtain estimates of the time to
diagnosis and to treatment initiation within and between
health systems. Given that there is likely to be greater
confidence regarding the pathologic state of the prostate
[(Fig._1)TD$FIG]
Fig. 1 – Prostate cancer diagnostic pathway: benefits of incorporating mpMRI, PI-RADS scoring and MRDB sampling. (1) Greater precision in
determining tumor grade and volume (improved risk stratification and higher precision in making therapy choices). (2) Potential higher rates of
detection of clinically significant disease needing active treatments. (3) Potential reductions in diagnosis of indolent disease, thereby reducing
overdiagnosis and overtreatment. (4) Fewer targeted biopsies per patient required to make effective diagnoses and minimization of biopsy-related
morbidity. (5) Reduction in the number of patients undergoing biopsy. mpMRI = multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; PI-RADS = Prostate
Imaging-Reporting and Data System; MRDB = magnetic resonance–directed biopsy; MDT = multidisciplinary team; PSAD = prostate-specific antigen
density.

 gland, it is anticipated that there would be changes in the
number of patients undergoing gland-sparing procedures,
including rates of focal treatments and AS, which also needs
to be documented. The impact of mpMRI-MRDB on AS
because of better initial selection of patients will affect the
need for rebiopsy assessments, and ultimately on dropout
rates. Quality-of-life measures related to the avoidance of
biopsies and therapy-related side effects and anxiety must
also be evaluated [28].
10.
Need for quality standards
The ability to deliver patient pathway benefits in PCa
diagnosis in clinical practice is highly dependent on
attaining and maintaining high quality for the entire
diagnostic process. Examples of good practice that could
assure radiologic quality include attendance at teaching
courses on mpMRI-MRDB, reading a minimum number of
prescribed cases during supervised training and annualized
numbers thereafter, double reading of mpMRI scans in
equivocal cases, monitoring to minimize the number of
equivocal readings, multidisciplinary team participation
with
radiologic-pathologic
correlations,
benchmarking
performance via external audits, and monitoring of negative
histology for positive mpMRI scans [36,97]. Similar training
and performance measures need to be instituted for all
operators who perform MRDB procedures to improve
interoperator reproducibility.
Borrowing from quality control and assurance successes
for other cancers, including ACR accreditation activities
(www.acraccreditation.org/dmap-overview),
specific
guid-
ance needs be developed for multiple aspects, including
requesting, performing, and reporting of mpMRI scans
[98]. This includes relevant aspects of quality control and
assurance for scanners and MRI data acquisition (specifically,
PI-RADS compliance). Radiologist training, accreditation,
certification, and quality audits (including compliance with
structured PI-RADS templates) will be needed. There needs to
be agreement on local rules for the use of mpMRI assessments
in guiding patient management, including MRDB procedures
[36]. As far as possible, international standards should be
developed via collaborations among radiologic and urologic
professional organizations such as ESUR/EAU and ACR/AUA. It
may also be possible to develop country-by-country guidance
via collaborations between radiologists, pathologists, urolo-
gists, radiographers, and physicists [99].
11.
Conclusions
It is no longer questioned whether mpMRI can detect and
localize csPCa. An abundance of research and clinical
practice data has confirmed its clinical utility. In compari-
son to the current standard-of-care TRUS biopsy, in most
studies MRDB finds more clinically significant prostate
cancers and fewer low-risk ones. Widespread implementa-
tion of PI-RADS v2 has facilitated the standardization of
mpMRI acquisition, interpretation, and reporting, and
mpMRI use for the diagnosis and management of PCa
continues to accelerate. Multiple analyses have shown the
potential of mpMRI and MRDB in enhancing the effective-
ness of PCa diagnosis pathways. As a result, mpMRI has been
incorporated into multiple clinical care guidelines, mostly
in the clinical setting of prior negative biopsy. Many
potential advantages are also promoted for biopsy-naïve
men; however, the latter indication has yet to appear widely
in internationally urologic guidelines.
It is acknowledged, that mpMRI and MRDB also miss
some csPCa, and that PI-RADS v2 has some important
limitations. Thus, while mpMRI is a major advance and is
likely to play a central role in the emerging paradigm of high-
precision PCa diagnosis, additional work is needed before we
know exactly how the PI-RADS system will impact PCa
pathways. On the basis of ongoing research and accrued
clinical experience, further revisions of PI-RADS are envis-
aged. It is hoped that PI-RADS v2.1 will improve mpMRI
reading performance and decrease inter-reader variability.
Looking to the not too distant future, efforts are already
under way to expand and adapt PI-RADS to meet a variety of
clinical needs in the evolving field of PCa care. The next
major revision of PI-RADS is anticipated to be a multiyear
endeavor, because it will require additional research data on
the clinical use of mpMRI-MRDB, which the combined US-
European PI-RADS steering committee encourages.
