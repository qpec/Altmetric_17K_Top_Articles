abstract
BACKGROUND: Preschoolers in the United States are heavily exposed to unhealthy food 
advertisements. Whether such exposure promotes cued eating has not been documented in 
this age group.
METHODS: Randomized experiment among 60 children, aged 2 to 5 years, recruited in 
2015–2016 from New Hampshire and Vermont. Children completed the experiment at 
a behavioral laboratory. Children were provided with a healthy snack to consume upon 
arrival then randomized to view a 14-minute TV program embedded with advertisements 
for either a food or a department store. Children were provided 2 snack foods to consume 
ad libitum while viewing the TV program; 1 of those snacks was the food advertised. Eating 
in the absence of hunger (EAH) was operationalized as the kilocalories of snack foods 
consumed. t tests were used to compare EAH by advertisement condition; linear regression 
models assessed effect modification by the child’s age, sex, BMI percentile, and parental 
feeding restriction.
RESULTS: Mean age was 4.1 (SD 0.9) years, 55% of children were male, 80% were non-
Hispanic white, and 20% were overweight or obese. There were no differences in child 
or socioeconomic characteristics by advertisement condition. Child BMI was not related 
to EAH. Mean kilocalories consumed during the EAH phase was greater among children 
exposed to the food advertisements (126.8, SD: 58.5) versus those exposed to the nonfood 
advertisements (97.3, SD: 52.3; P = .04), an effect driven by greater consumption of the 
advertised food (P < .01). There was no evidence of effect modification.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that food advertisement exposure may encourage obesogenic-
eating behaviors among the very young.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Early childhood is 
an important time for children to learn healthy eating 
habits. Exposure to food advertisements infl
 uences 
the food preferences and requests of preschool aged 
children, yet no study has examined the effect on 
immediate cued-eating in this age group.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We documented that food 
advertisement exposure while viewing a typical 
children’s TV program led to increased cued eating 
among 2- to 5-year-olds. Findings suggest that food 
advertisement exposure at a young age may prime 
eating behaviors that promote weight gain.

US children are heavily exposed 
to marketing for energy-dense 
nutritionally poor foods, primarily 
via TV. 
1, 
 
2 Preschoolers average >3 
hours of traditional TV viewing each 
day, 
3 and TV food advertisement 
exposure may be increasing among 
this age group: preschoolers 
viewed 18% more TV snack food 
advertisements from 2010 to 2014. 
4 
Exposure to TV food advertisements 
prompts cued eating among school-
age children, 
5 even after consuming 
a satiating meal. 
6 This is concerning 
if such excess caloric consumption 
leads to excess weight gain 
7 or 
primes a preference for energy-dense 
foods. 
8 However, no study to date has 
tested whether food advertisements 
cue eating among preschool-age 
children.
Eating behaviors develop during 
early childhood 
9 and may form 
the basis for dietary preferences 
and habits later in life. 
10 According 
to the Reactivity to Embedded Food 
Cues in Advertising Model, 
 
11 
children have physiologic and 
psychological responses to food cues 
within advertisements that prompt 
children to eat that food or similar 
highly palatable foods, foods that are 
intrinsically rewarding. In turn, the 
consumption of such foods reinforces 
those responses. However, because 
of their age, young children have a 
limited lifetime exposure to food 
advertising and thus likely have a 
less developed conditioned response 
than older children. Therefore, 
findings of cued eating in response 
to food advertisements in older 
children do not necessarily extend 
to preschoolers, and it is important 
to understand how food marketing 
affects preschoolers specifically.
Here we present findings from a 
randomized experiment to test 
the effect of viewing TV food 
advertisements on cued eating 
among preschool-age children. We 
specifically address excess caloric 
consumption that is not driven 
by hunger using the “eating in the 
absence of hunger” (EAH) laboratory 
paradigm in which participants 
are fed a meal or snack to satiety 
and then immediately given the 
choice to consume additional snacks 
ad libitum. 
12 We hypothesized 
that children exposed to food 
advertisements while viewing 
a TV program would consume 
more snack foods than children 
exposed to nonfood advertisements. 
Importantly, we selected a food not 
typically marketed to young children 
to reduce confounding due to a 
child’s previous familiarity with the 
advertised product.
METHODS
Participants
Children aged 2 to 5 years and a 
parent or guardian were recruited 
from the greater Hanover, New 
Hampshire, community during 2015–
2016. Eligibility included English 
fluency, absence of food allergies 
and dietary restrictions, absence of 
health conditions or medication use 
that may affect appetite, willingness 
to participate in a 1-hour study, 
lack of familiarity with Bugles corn 
snacks, and no known previous 
exposure to Bugles advertisements. 
Of the 88 participants screened, 
81 were eligible, and 60 enrolled. 
 
Figure 1 presents the participant flow 
throughout the study. All enrolled 
children completed the study. The 
Committee for Protection of Human 
Subjects at Dartmouth College 
approved of all study procedures. 
Parents provided written consent 
at the study visit. Each parent 
completed a questionnaire while 
his or her child completed the 
experiment. Data were analyzed in 
2016.
Preload Phase
Study visits were completed at a 
behavioral laboratory space designed 
to reflect a comfortable home setting. 
Upon arrival at the laboratory, 
children were offered 50 g (45 kcal) 
of peeled banana, 58 g (214 kcals)

of sliced cheese, 28 g (140 kcals) of 
crackers, and a small cup of water 
and were given the choice to eat until 
satiated. After the preload snack, 
children self-reported their satiety 
level using a 3-point visual analog 
scale (1 = hungry, 2 = half hungry/
half full, 3 = full); satiety ratings were 
dichotomized as hungry (1) versus 
not hungry (2 or 3). Children were 
next asked to taste a piece of each of 
the 2 snacks that would be provided 
during the EAH phase and rate how 
much they liked each snack using a 
5-point visual analog scale anchored 
at “not at all” (1 = strong frown) to 
“very much” (5 = strong smile). For 
analyses, taste test responses were 
dichotomized as did not like the 
snacks (refused to taste or selection 
of a frown face, 1 or 2) versus liked 
the snacks (slight to strong smile, 
3–5).
EAH Phase
Children were randomized 1:1 
to view a 14-minute TV segment 
(“Elmo’s World” from Sesame Street, 
Sesame Workshop) embedded with 
a mix of TV advertisements for either 
1 food (ie, 9 advertisements, 15 or 
30 seconds each, for Bugles corn 
chips, food condition) or a national 
department store (6 advertisements, 
30 seconds each, nonfood condition). 
Total advertisement time in each 
condition was 3 minutes. The Bugles 
ads featured children playing and 
eating the product; the department 
store ads promoted a sale and food 
was not featured. Children viewed 
the program alone with the exception 
of 3 children who requested that 
their parent stay in the room with 
them. All advertisements were 
placed within the program to reflect 
a typical airing on traditional TV. 
Before beginning the TV program, 
children were provided with two 
bowls of snacks in separate bowls: 
32 g (139 kcals) of Nabisco Teddy 
Grahams (Nabisco, East Hanover, NJ) 
and 21 g (112 kcals) of Bugles corn 
snacks (General Mills, Minneapolis, 
MN). Children consumed the snacks 
ad libitum while viewing the TV 
program. When the program was 
finished, the remaining snacks 
were weighed, and the kcals 
consumed were calculated based 
on the manufacturer’s nutritional 
information.
Parental Feeding Restriction
Greater parental feeding restriction 
may lead children to overconsume 
palatable foods when in an 
uninhibited environment. 
5 Therefore, 
parents completed the parental 
feeding restriction subscale of the 
Child Feeding Questionnaire. 
13 The 
original scale includes 8 items to 
assess parental feeding practices 
related to regulating a child’s access 
to and intake of highly palatable 
foods. Item responses are on a 
5-point Likert scale, anchored at 
1 (disagree) and 5 (agree). The 
scale used in this study was slightly 
modified from the original, in that 
2 separate items assessing food as 
a reward (ie, I offer my child his/
her favorite foods in exchange for 
good behavior; I offer sweets to my 
child as a reward for good behaviors) 
were combined into 1 item (ie, I 
offer my child his/her favorite foods 
or sweets in exchange for good 
behavior). Thus, we used a modified 
7-item restriction scale (internal 
consistency, Cronbach’s α = 0.83). 
Consistent with the original scale, the 
final score was the average over the 
7 items and higher scores indicated 
greater parental restriction.
Additional Covariates
Parents reported their child’s 
age, sex, race, ethnicity, and their 
relationship to the child (eg, mother, 
father), marital status, household 
income, and educational attainment 
for themselves and their spouse 
as appropriate. The mother’s 
educational attainment was used in 
analyses because mothers often play 
a primary role in child feeding. 
14, 
 
15 
The child’s weight and height were 
measured at the end of the study 
visit using a Seca 763 Medical Scale 
and Seca 213 Stadiometer (Hamburg, 
Germany). All measurements were 
taken in light indoor clothing without 
shoes. Age- and sex-adjusted BMI 
percentiles were computed using 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention 2000 growth charts. 
16 
Overweight or obese was defined 
as ≥85th percentile. Parents also 
reported their child’s time engaged 
in physical activity (how much time 
does your child spend doing physical 
activity, such as running around, 
climbing, biking, dancing, swimming, 
playing sports, etc?) and TV or movie 
viewing (how much time does your 
child spend watching TV shows or 
movies?) on a typical weekday and 
weekend day; a weighted average 
was computed to reflect hours per 
day engaged in each activity.
Statistical Analyses
Child demographics and weight 
status, household socioeconomic 
characteristics, and parental 
feeding restriction were compared 
by advertisement condition using 
unpaired, 2-sample t tests for 
continuous measures, or χ2 or 
Fisher’s exact tests (when sample 
sizes were ≤5 for any 1 category) 
for categorical measures. Pearson’s 
correlation coefficients were 
computed to assess the associations 
between child characteristics 
and kcals consumed during the 
preload or EAH phase. The primary 
analysis compared total kcals 
consumed during the EAH phase by 
advertisement condition using an 
unpaired, 2-sample t test. We also 
assessed kcals consumed for the 
advertised and the nonadvertised 
snack foods separately. As a 
sensitivity check, we repeated the 
analyses (1) adjusted for the child’s 
satiety level after the preload snack 
using linear regression and (2) 
excluding children who refused to 
taste or did not like the snacks during 
the taste test before the EAH phase.

Test statistics for main effects were 
considered statistically significant 
if P < .05. Finally, because a child’s 
age, sex, BMI percentile, or parental 
feeding restriction may modify EAH 
among children, 
 
5 we used linear 
regression to assess whether any 
of those factors modified the main 
effects between food advertisement 
exposure and kcals consumed 
during the EAH phase. Specifically, 
we included an interaction term 
between each of those factors 
and advertisement condition; 
any P < .10 based on a Wald’s t 
test was considered evidence of a 
statistically significant interaction. 
All analyses were completed using 
the R Language and Environment for 
Statistical Computing, version 3.0.2.

RESULTS
 
Table 1 presents sample 
characteristics by advertisement 
condition. The sample reflected a 
population with a relatively higher 
socioeconomic status in comparison 
with the general US population, 
as reflected by the distribution of 
maternal education and household 
income. Most parents were mothers 
(88.3%), 6 (10.0%) were fathers, 
and 1 (1.7%) was a grandmother. 
Most (98.0%) parents were married. 
Overall, 20% of children were 
overweight or obese. Children 
engaged in >3 hours of physical 
activity and 1 hour of TV or movie 
viewing each day. Mean parental 
feeding restriction was 3.4 (SD: 0.9). 
Children consumed, on average, 87.1 
(SD: 80.0) kcals during the preload 
phase. There were no differences 
in any baseline characteristic by 
advertisement condition. Most (n = 
52, 86.7%) children reported they 
were not hungry after consuming 
the preload snack, which also did not 
differ by advertisement condition 
(Fisher’s exact test P > .99); satiety 
level was missing for 1 child.
The associations between kcals 
consumed during the preload phase 
and child’s age (r = 0.23; P = .08), 
child’s BMI percentile (r = –0.19; P = 
.15) and parental feeding restriction 
(r = 0.22; P = .09) did not reach 
statistical significance. Similarly, 
there were no statistically significant 
associations between kcals consumed 
during the EAH phase and the child’s 
age (r = 0.12; P = .35), the child’s 
BMI percentile (r = 0.02; P = .88), 
or parental feeding restriction (r = 
0.07; P = .59). There were also no 
differences in the kcals consumed 
during each phase by the child’s 
weight status when classified as 
healthy weight versus overweight or 
obese ( 
Fig 2).
 
Figure 3 presents the main findings 
of the study. Mean kcals consumed 
during the EAH phase are presented 
as unadjusted values because none of 
the baseline characteristics differed 
by advertisement condition. Children 
exposed to food advertisements 
consumed, on average, 29.5 kcals 
more during the EAH phase than 
children exposed to the nonfood 
advertisements (P = .04). The main 
effect was driven by a greater 
consumption of the advertised food 
(difference in group means: 21.7 
kcals; P < .01). Mean consumption of 
the nonadvertised food did not differ 
by advertisement condition (P = .43). 
We repeated each of those between 
group comparisons using linear 
regression, and the distribution of 
standardized residuals supported 
that each outcome was normally 
distributed. Findings were consistent 
when adjusted for the child’s satiety 
rating after the preload phase (data 
not shown) as well as when excluding

children who refused to taste or who 
did not like the snack foods provided 
during the pre-EAH taste test 
(Supplemental Fig 4).
Finally, there was no evidence to 
support that the child’s age, sex, 
BMI percentile, or parental feeding 
restriction modified the main effect 
of advertisement condition on total 
kcals or kcals of the advertised food 
consumed during the EAH phase 
(data not shown, all Ps for interaction 
terms >.20).
DISCUSSION
In this randomized experiment 
of 60 preschool-age children, 
exposure to a TV program with food 
advertisements resulted in greater 
ad libitum consumption of snack 
foods compared with exposure 
to the same TV program with 
nonfood advertisements. Findings 
are consistent with experimental 
studies among preadolescents that 
documented food advertisement 
exposure as part of viewing a TV 
program 
5, 
 
6 or while playing an 
Internet advergame 
5 led to increased 
ad libitum consumption of highly 
palatable snack foods. Our study 
reflects the first to assess this effect 
among preschool-age children.
The main effect of food 
advertisement exposure in our 
sample was driven by increased 
consumption of the advertised food. 
These findings of a brand-specific 
relationship mirror the results of 
our previous study among 178 
preadolescent children 
6 where TV 
food advertisement exposure led 
to increased cued eating during the 
EAH phase only for the advertised 
food. Previously, exposure to TV food 
advertisements had been shown to 
affect the brand-specific preferences 
and food requests among preschool-
age children. 
20 For example, in a 
randomized trial among 46 children 
aged 2 to 6 years, 
 
21 exposure to 
TV food commercials related to 
an increased preference for the 
advertised brands when given the 
choice of selecting the advertised 
item or a similar nonbranded 
item from a set of photographs. In 
another experimental study among 
57 children aged 3 to 5 years, 
 
22 
exposure to TV food commercials 
related to increased purchase 
requests for the advertised products 
by young children in a mock grocery 
store setting. Our study is the first to 
demonstrate that food advertisement 
exposure among preschool-age 
children increases cued consumption 
of food, findings that align with those 
among older children.
Our study used a food children 
were not familiar with, suggesting 
that relatively little exposure to 
a food brand through TV food 
advertisements can prime excess 
caloric consumption of that branded 
food among young children. Such 
initial exposure may initiate the 
reciprocal cycle of reactivity to food 
cues in advertisements and eating 
as proposed in the Reactivity to 
Embedded Food Cues in Advertising

Model. We further hypothesize that if 
children were to develop a familiarity 
with the food, the conditioned 
response of eating in reaction to cues 
for that food would increase. Future 
studies that incorporate repeated 
measures are needed to fully test that 
hypothesis.
Compared with our study, the 
majority of previous cued eating 
experiments among school-age 
children demonstrated a “beyond-
brand” effect: exposure to TV food 
advertisements resulted in increased 
consumption of highly palatable 
foods overall. However, in most 
of those studies, 
 
5 children were 
not provided with the advertised 
branded food as a snack choice as 
they were in our design. Previous 
studies that did provide that 
choice reported mixed findings 
related to brand-specificity. One 
study among 181 preadolescents 
23 
reported a brand specific effect on 
cued consumption where children 
consumed more branded potato 
chips versus nonbranded potato 
chips in response to viewing a TV 
advertisement for the branded chips 
with a celebrity endorsement. In 
comparison, a study among 270 
preadolescents found that exposure 
to advertisements for energy dense 
candies while playing an Internet 
advergame related to increased 
consumption of both the advertised 
and a nonadvertised candy offered 
after playing the game, 
 
24 while a 
similar study from the same research 
group among 92 preadolescents 
found that food advertisement 
exposure while playing an 
advergame related to an increased 
consumption of the nonadvertised 
candy only. 
25 Thus, although there is 
a consensus that food advertisement 
exposure relates to increased cued 
consumption of palatable foods 
among children, 
5 more studies 
are needed to better understand 
how that exposure might affect 
the development of brand-specific 
preferences both immediately and 
prospectively.
We did not observe an association 
between the child’s current BMI 
percentile and kcals consumed 
during the EAH phase. In our other 
study conducted among 9- to 
10-year-olds, 
 
6 current BMI percentile 
was strongly related to consumption 
during the EAH phase, suggesting 
that we were observing an existing 
behavioral pattern that may have 
contributed to the children’s current 
BMI percentile. There are known 
longitudinal associations between 
EAH behaviors and weight gain, 
 
7, 
 
12 
even among toddlers. 
26 It is critical 
to next understand how exposures 
that can prime cued eating might 
influence the establishment of EAH 
behaviors prospectively.
The marketing of food to children 
on media is unregulated in the 
United States. Instead, major food 
and beverage manufacturers have 
voluntarily pledged to limit child-
directed marketing of unhealthy 
foods as part of the Children’s 
Food and Beverage Advertising. 
27 
However, independent research 
groups have highlighted several 
limitations of that program, 
 
28, 
 
29 
and young children remain highly 
exposed to TV advertisements 
for foods that may contribute 
to unhealthy dietary patterns. 
Legislative efforts to reduce 
children’s exposures to TV 
advertising for unhealthy foods in the 
United States should be encouraged 
18 
if current self-regulatory efforts 
do not improve. Pediatricians can 
also play a vital role in helping to 
reduce a young child’s exposure 
to food advertisements. For 
example, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics screen time guidelines 
for children30 emphasize the role 
that media can play in disrupting 
healthy eating habits, such as when 
media is on during family mealtimes. 
Pediatricians can also emphasize the 
importance of reducing exposure to 
food advertisements as an additional 
way to promote the development of 
healthy dietary habits.
Strengths of our study include 
the randomized design, which 
reduced the effect of unmeasured 
confounders. We also optimized 
the ecological validity: children 
viewed the TV program in a 
comfortable room, we selected a 
popular children’s TV program, and 
advertisements were embedded 
to reflect a typical TV program. 
However, external validity is limited 
and epidemiologic studies are 
needed to assess generalizability 
to a real-world setting. Our sample 
was a convenience sample, and 
sample demographics reflected a 
rural, mostly white, non-Hispanic 
population of a relatively higher 
socioeconomic status. Additional 
studies are needed to determine 
how generalizable findings are 
among more diverse populations. 
Self-reported satiety ratings among 
young children are likely limited and 
should be cautiously interpreted. 
However, all children consumed a 
preload snack until they chose to 
stop, suggesting that children were 
satiated before the experiment. 
In addition, EAH may in part be 
driven by a genetic predisposition to 
increased food responsiveness, 
 
19, 
 
31 
and our work in preadolescents 
suggests a genetic predisposition to 
excess consumption after viewing 
food advertisements. 
6 Future work 
should explore the extent to which 
this genetic disposition manifests 
itself in young children.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study documented that exposure 
to TV food advertising as presented 
in a typical children’s TV program 
had an acute effect on cued eating 
among preschool-age children. 
Reducing a young child’s exposure 
to food advertisements is thus an 
actionable way to reduce the priming 
and reinforcement of obesogenic 
dietary behaviors during a critical

pediatricians are a trusted source

to parents and the public.
