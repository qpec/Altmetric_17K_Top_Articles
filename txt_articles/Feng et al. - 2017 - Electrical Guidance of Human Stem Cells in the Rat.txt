SUMMARY
Limited migration of neural stem cells in adult brain is a roadblock for the use of stem cell therapies to treat brain diseases and injuries.
Here, we report a strategy that mobilizes and guides migration of stem cells in the brain in vivo. We developed a safe stimulation paradigm
to deliver directional currents in the brain. Tracking cells expressing GFP demonstrated electrical mobilization and guidance of migration
of human neural stem cells, even against co-existing intrinsic cues in the rostral migration stream. Transplanted cells were observed at
3 weeks and 4 months after stimulation in areas guided by the stimulation currents, and with indications of differentiation. Electrical
stimulation thus may provide a potential approach to facilitate brain stem cell therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Neural stem cells/progenitor cells (NSCs) promise great
hope for various neurological diseases. Researchers have
demonstrated that NSCs are able to migrate and differen-
tiate into adult rat brain and spinal cord (Flax et al., 1998;
Snyder and Teng, 2012; Tabar et al., 2005). The human
brain, however, poses a particular challenge for migrating
NSCs or neuroblasts due to our larger brain size and the dis-
tances that cells must travel. Endogenous neuroblasts
reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus,
deep in the brain. Neuroblasts from these niches have to
migrate long distances to reach lesions in the cortex or
other extra-hippocampal regions. Another hurdle is that
transplanted NSCs have very poor motility due to suppres-
sion of migration by NSCs to each other and their pro-
genies (Ladewig et al., 2014). Expanding the limits of
migration of stem cells in brain is therefore a key step in
stem cell therapies for the human brain (Trounson and
McDonald, 2015). We aim to develop techniques that can
mobilize and guide stem cells in the brain in vivo, which
has not yet been achieved.
We chose the rostral migration stream (RMS) to develop
our stimulation technique because this is one of the most
active migratory paths in the brain, and its cellular and
molecular mechanisms are well understood (Anton et al.,
2004; Curtis et al., 2007; Mobley and McCarty, 2011; Sanai
et al., 2011; Staquicini et al., 2009). Newly born neuroblasts
and transplanted hNSCs placed at the SVZ normally
migrate directionally downstream to the olfactory bulb
(OB), guided by various cues, including multiple chemical
gradients and flow of cerebral spinal fluid (Flax et al.,
1998; Sawamoto et al., 2006; Snyder and Teng, 2012; Tabar
et al., 2005; Wu et al., 1999). This model allows us to test
whether our technique is able to guide hNSCs to travel up-
stream toward the lateral ventricle (LV) region on the ipsi-
lateral side, against endogenous directional cues.
Electric fields (EFs) provide a powerful signal with which
to stimulate and guide migration of many types of cells
in vitro, including NSCs (Cao et al., 2013; Feng et al.,
2012a; Li et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2008,
2009; Zhao et al., 2006). Normally, weak EFs in the brain
may aid in guiding the migration of neuroblasts from the
SVZ to the OB (Cao et al., 2013). We hypothesized that a
stronger applied EF would provide a signal sufficient to
guide some of the hNSCs injected in the middle of the
RMS to move upstream toward the SVZ, against the
intrinsic guidance mechanisms (Figure 1).
RESULTS
The Overall Research Design
First, we transplant human neural stem cells (hNSCs) into
the RMS (Figure 1A). The transplanted cells migrate to the
OB, following the endogenous directional signal (Fig-
ure 1B). We then apply electric currents along the RMS
with minimal effects on brain electrical activities and mo-
tor behavior (Figure 1C). If the EFs are applied against the
endogenous direction of neuroblasts (i.e., downstream of
the SVZ to the OB), and if the electrical guidance effect is
strong enough, we should see transplanted cells being

 guided to migrate against the endogenous cues and up-
stream to the SVZ (Figure 1D).
To Track NSCs in the Brain, We First Developed an
hNSC Line that Expresses EGFP
The previously described hNSCs from H9 (Feng et al.,
2012a) were transduced with MNDU3-luciferase-PGK-
EGFP, a lentiviral vector expressing EGFP. EGFP-positive
cells enriched by cell sorting provided a consistent number
of cells for transplantation (Figure S1). The transduced cells
maintained markers for NSCs and allowed us to differen-
tiate types of cells (Figures 2A–2D). We tested whether
expression of EGFP altered galvanotaxis. Applied EFs effec-
tively mobilized and guided the migration of the hNSCs ex-
pressing EGFP (EGFP-hNSCs) in the same way as their
parental cells, and that of neuroblasts from neonatal rat
brain and from the SVZ of adult mice (Figures 2E–2H and
S2; Movie S1) (Cao et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2012a; Li
et al., 2008).
We Then Optimized the Electrical Stimulation Scheme
to Effectively Guide Cells
Our setup had a unique modification of the classic galvano-
taxis chamber with a very small conductive volume
(�20 mL) over a large surface area (400 mm2), ensuring min-
imal electric currents at physiological voltages (less than
1 mA). This design efficiently dissipates heat generated
and minimizes changes in ions and perturbation of culture
conditions. Cells exposed to a field of 100–200 mV/mm re-
mained healthy and motile for several days (Song et al.,
2007). With this design, however, it was not possible to
deliver direct current (DC) EFs to the brain, because the
large conductive volume reduces resistance and allows cur-
rents of hundreds and thousands times higher to pass
through the tissues at similar voltage, inducing a signifi-
cant Joule effect, changes in pH and ion concentrations,
and electrode by-products. We developed optimal stimula-
tion schemes using intermittent EFs (iEFs) that minimized
detrimental effects while maintaining effective guidance
for migration of hNSCs. iEFs with specific on and off ratios
showed significant guidance effects on directional migra-
tion of hNSCs while maintaining cell viability after pro-
longed stimulation (Figures S3A and S3B; Movies S2 and
S3), and induced negligible changes in temperature and
pH in the culture chamber (Figures S3C–S3E3).
Electrode Pairs Were Used to Simultaneously Deliver
and Monitor Stable Currents at the Same Time
Based on the preliminary test, we chose carbon electrodes
to deliver current and silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) elec-
trodes to monitor the EF induced (Figures 3B and S4A). Two
configurations of electrodes were used: two plus four (2 + 4)

 (Figure 3C), and two pairs (2 + 2) (Figure 3D). The 2 + 4
electrodes have more detailed measurement points. Paired
electrodes were inserted and immobilized in the brain of
anesthetized animals with a stereotactic frame. The elec-
trical currents were delivered to the brain in animals under
continuous anesthesia or in free-moving status after recov-
ery from surgical anesthesia. After the rat head was immo-
bilized in a stereotaxic stage, the electrodes were inserted
into the brain from a window in the skull surgically made
to expos the dura. The electrodes were fixed to a holder
with a pre-determined depth and spacing that corre-
sponded to the points along the RMS (Figures 3 and S4A).
Histology sections confirmed that injection needle and
electrodes were correctly placed and secured using stereo-
tactic manipulation and electrode immobilization (Figures
4A, 4B, 4E, and 5A). Continuous monitoring of the EFs and
currents in the brain during stimulation allowed adjust-
ment to ensure stable voltage and currents in the brain (Fig-
ures S4B–S4E). During continuous anesthesia, the electric
currents were delivered to the brain along the RMS for up
to 10 hr (Figure 3D). For animals that recovered from anes-
thesia and moved freely in the cage, we developed a
portable miniaturized stimulator with a button battery
and a programmable chip to administer stimulation. The
battery and programmable chip were housed in a trans-
parent plastic tube. After stereotaxic electrode implanta-
tion, the battery-chip tube configuration was secured to
the skull with dental acrylic (Figure 3E).
Electroencephalographic and Motor Functions
Suggested Good Tolerance of the Rats to Surgery and
Electrical Stimulation
No seizures were observed in any animals during or after
the electrical stimulation. We placed two electroencepha-
logram (EEG) recording electrodes in the left and right
frontal bone next to the dura, using a modified method
described previously (Feng et al., 2012b) (Figures S5A
and S5B). Electrical stimulation used in our experiments
had negligible effects on the EEG. Post-stimulation
recording showed waveforms similar to those pre-stimula-
tion (Figure S5E). Quantitative analysis confirmed com-
plete overlap of the EEG recorded from rat before stimula-
tion and after intermittent EF stimulation (Figure S5D).
Frequency dependence of the power analysis based on
the harvested EEGs showed no statistically significant
changes in theta or beta waves, but slightly increased
the power of low gamma wave during iEF stimulation
(Figure S5E).
To determine the effects of electrode implantation and
stimulation on animal behavior, we recorded normal
movement of the animals after recovery from anesthesia
and for more than 3 weeks (Figure S5F). We evaluated
the effects on locomotor function (Rotarod) and fine
motor coordination function (horizontal ladder walk)
(Hamm et al., 1994; Metz and Whishaw, 2002, 2009).
The Rotarod performance of the cell transplantation
group alone and the cell transplantation plus electrodes
groups were essentially unchanged from baseline on all
post-surgery test days. There appeared to be a weak trend
for the cell transplantation with stimulation group to
have a shorter duration on the Rotarod at day 1 compared
with baseline, but differences were not statistically sig-
nificant (p = 0.33, t test). The horizontal ladder walk
performance of the cell transplantation group alone and
the cell transplantation plus electrode groups were essen-
tially unchanged from baseline on all post-surgery test
days. There appeared to be a weak trend for the cell
transplantation with stimulation group to have a greater
number of foot slips on the ladder walk on day 1 compared
with baseline, but differences were not statistically signif-
icant (p = 0.32, t test). These tests suggest that the surgery
and stimulation did not induce significant alterations of
motor function (Hamm et al., 1994; Metz and Whishaw,
2009; Stout et al., 2013).
We Stimulated and Guided Migration of hNSCs
Transplanted into the Middle of the RMS
With no electrical stimulation (no electrode insertion
control group, and electrode insertion with no electrical
stimulation sham group), hNSCs transplanted into the
middle of the RMS migrated uniformly toward the OB
(Figures 4A and 4E), consistent with previous reports of
migration of hNSCs toward the OB when transplanted
in the SVZ (Flax et al., 1998; Tabar et al., 2005). These re-
sults confirmed the robust intrinsic guidance signals to-
ward the OB. When an electrical stimulation was applied
toward the LV (upstream of the RMS), significant numbers
of cells were found near the ipsilateral LV region (Figures
4B and 4B00), which was not observed in any of the control
and sham brains (Figures 4A00 and 4E00). Serial sections of
the brain demonstrated consistent migration of hNSCs
upstream toward the ipsilateral SVZ (Figure 4D). Co-stain-
ing with human SOX2 antibodies confirmed the undiffer-
entiated status of the migrating hNSCs (Figure 4C). To
exclude the possibility of electrode insertion as a cause
of inducing migration of hNSCs toward the LV direction,
we positioned electrodes the same way without switching
on the field (sham group). No EGFP signals were observed
around the electrode near the LV region (Figures 4E
and 4E00). In brain sections with the injection sites with
electrode positions visible, we counted the EGFP-positive
cells and measured the distance between the transplant
site and cells furthest in the OB direction, and in the LV
direction. Following electrical stimulation, NSCs were
observed upstream near the LV region. No NSCs were
observed in the LV region in control group and sham

upstream to the LV region was found to be the same as
that to the OB when the electrical stimulation was applied
to the direction of LV (Figure 4G).
The Guided Migration and Enhanced Cell Motility in
the Brain Persisted Long after Stimulation
To determine longer-term cell survival, we examined serial
sagittal sections of the rat brains 3 weeks and 4 months
after electrical stimulation. Detailed examination of the
serial brain sections revealed that NSCs migrated from
the injection site to the LV region and to the contralateral
hemisphere (Figure 5B). EGFP signals were detected further
away from the transplant site even beyond the electrode in
the posterior region of the SVZ, and in the corpus callosum
of the contralateral hemisphere, which were not found in
the control and sham brains (Figures 5 and S6). The migra-
tion of transplanted cells beyond the attractive electrode to

Figure 4. Electrical Stimulation Mobilized and Guided Migration of hNSCs in Rat Brain
(A) hNSCs transplanted into the middle part of rostral migration stream (RMS) had a default migration toward the olfactory bulb (OB). EGFP
signals are evidently present on the OB side (A0), No EGFP signal was detectable on the lateral ventricle (LV) side (A00).
(B) Electrical stimulation (positive at OB and negative at LV side) induced significant amount of hNSCs to migrate to the LV side (B00)
against co-existing guidance cues which normally guide cells to the OB side in the RMS. Larger number of hNSCs kept migration to the OB
(B0). Electrodes were implanted and electrical stimulation was applied for 10 hr after 24 hr of EGFP-hNSC transplantation.
(C and D) Adjacent sections of the brain confirmed migration of hNSCs to the LV side.
(E) Sham stimulation, whereby stimulation electrodes were inserted without delivery of currents, showed no cell migration to the LV side (E00).
(F and G) Semi-quantification confirmed mobilizing and guidance effects of electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation toward the SVZ
guided a significant amount of hNSCs to the LV side, which was not seen in control groups. The maximum direct migration distance toward
LV was 2.4 mm.

 the LV region and contralateral side suggests that the mobi-
lizing effect of the electrical stimulation on hNSCs per-
sisted even after the stimulation.
Using the transplant site as the middle point, we counted
EGFP dots detected in the OB direction and that in the LV
direction on the ipsilateral side, the sum being 100% (Fig-
ures 5B and 5C). Three weeks later, predominant signals
of EGFP were in the LV region. Compared with the results
immediately after electrical stimulation, more hNSCs
were detected in the LV region than in the OB direction
(compare Figure 5A with Figure 4A). Consistently, brains
4 months after stimulation showed an even greater propor-
tion of hNSCs in the LV region (Figure 5C). The electrical
stimulation not only guided cells to the SVZ, but the cells
that traveled to in the LV region appeared to survive and
maintain EGFP expression longer than the cells without
stimulation.
We examined differentiation markers in hNSCs 3 weeks
after transplantation and stimulation. No glial fibrillary

b-tubulin (TUJ1) staining was found to co-localize with
EGFP signals (Figure 6A). Four months after transplanta-
tion and stimulation, sparse EGFP signals could be shown
to co-localize with antibodies against NEUN, GFAP, IBA1,
and myelin basic protein (MBP), suggesting differentiation
of some hNSCs to neuron, astrocytes, microglia, or oligo-
dendrocytes (in CA1/CA2 region of hippocampus, in OB,
in hippocampus, and in RMS, respectively.) (Figure 6B).
These results are consistent with previous reports that
transplanted hNSCs were able to differentiate in rodent
brains (Flax et al., 1998; Tabar et al., 2005).
DISCUSSION
One unmet need in brain regenerative medicine is to effec-
tively and safely mobilize and guide NSCs to migrate to the
appropriate brain lesion sites for repair. Researchers have
demonstrated the rich availability of NSCs both endo-
genously and through transplantation (Arvidsson et al.,
2002; Bond et al., 2015; Gage, 2000). Inefficient migration,
however, is one of the barriers to effective clinical use
(Kornblum, 2007). For efficient treatment, transplanted
stem cells must establish functional connections with the
host cells to repair damage and restore function (Karp
and Leng Teo, 2009; Khaldoyanidi, 2008; Laflamme and
Murry, 2005). In most cases, very few stem cells are able
to migrate to injured or diseased regions and integrate
structurally and functionally in the well-differentiated
host tissues (Rakic, 2004).
Our results demonstrated the feasibility of the applica-
tion of electrical stimulation directly in the brain in a
manner that stimulates and guides the migration of
NSCs. Our optimized stimulation strategy and electrode
system is able to deliver and monitor stable stimulation
to the brain with minimized detrimental effects to a
tolerable level, supported by assessment of EEG and
motor function. In the RMS, where intrinsic signals nor-
mally guide NSCs toward the OB, the applied electrical
signals were able to override the effect of intrinsic signals
and guided some NSCs toward the SVZ. Significantly,
electrical stimulation mobilized transplanted hNSCs to
migrate beyond the attractive electrode to the SVZ and
to a limited extent to the corpus callosum. hNSCs were
found in the SVZ 3 weeks and 4 months after transplan-
tation, long after EGFP signals disappeared in the OB.
The hNSCs appeared to colonize some sites in the SVZ.
Does this indicate that transplanted and electrically stim-
ulated cells were able to replenish the stem cell reser-
voirs? We believe that this is a very important question
to be answered in the future. A few transplanted cells ap-
peared to start to express nerve cell markers, suggesting
potential differentiation of those cells. The short-term
guidance effects, and potential long-term motility in-
crease and differentiation, suggest a useful aspect of elec-
trical stimulation in brain function regulation through
stem cells. We therefore provide proof-of-concept results
to use electrical stimulation to guide and mobilize NSCs
in the brain in vivo. One should note with caution that
the RMS is a specific permissive area for neuronal migra-
tion in the adult brain. The microenvironment in injured
brain is significantly different from that within the RMS.
Future investigation is therefore essential to test subse-
quent hypotheses about the use of electrical stimulation
to mobilize and guide migration of NSCs in diseased/
injured brains.
Some neuroblasts migrate long distances from their place
of origin to the resident destination throughout develop-
ment and into adulthood (Altman, 1969; Alvarez-Buylla
and Lim, 2004; Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994; Luskin,
1993). Experiments using rodent models have produced
significant insights into mechanisms that regulate NSC
migration and show that chemical gradients are important
guides in NSC migration (Aguirre et al., 2010; Duan et al.,
2007; Famulski et al., 2010; Gaiano, 2008; Ishizuka et al.,
2011; Li et al., 1999; McKay, 1997; Molnar and Clowry,
2012; Wang et al., 2011; Wu et al., 1999). Although power-
ful, chemical gradients are difficult to control in vivo.
Application of EFs has flexibility of varying strength,
time, and direction across long distances. The electric
signal can be immediately switched on and off, and
strength adjusted if so desired. Electrical guidance therefore
may provide a useful approach in human brain, which is
significantly larger—over a thousand times larger—than
that of mouse or rat. EFs may be able to help to unify
multiple cues in guiding cells as is currently being used in

 the treatment of epithelial migration in wound healing
(Zhao et al., 2006). Further testing and optimization of elec-
trical stimulation is needed in larger-brained animals and
eventually in human brains. Development of stimulation
technology in primates will lead to technology with
promising clinical applications in human patients. Recent
developments in deep brain stimulation technology and
in vivo wearable electrode arrays suggest promising tools
for regulation of function and structure of migrating
hNSCs (Santhanam et al., 2006; Viventi et al., 2011).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Derivation of hNSCs and Establishment
of EGFP-hNSCs
The use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) was approved by
UC Davis Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee. hNSCs were
derived from H9 hESCs as described in our previous publication
(Feng et al., 2012a), then stably transduced with lentiviral vectors
containing an EGFP reporter driven by the PGK promoter (EGFP-
hNSCs). The confirmation of EGFP-hNSCs is described in Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Electrotaxis of EGFP-hNSCs In Vitro
EGFP-hNSCs were seeded in an electrotaxis chamber in CO2-inde-
pendent medium (Invitrogen) plus 1 mM L-glutamine for 0.5–1 hr.
Cell migration was recorded using time-lapse digital video-micro-
scopy (Song et al., 2007). Directedness, migration speed, displace-
ment speed, and x axis distance are the four parameters used to
quantify cell migration, which are described in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Stimulation Schemes for Guidance of Cell Migration
with Tolerable Detrimental Effects
To minimize the side effects of traditional continuous DC EFs,
we optimized an intermittent DC EF stimulation scheme that
effectively guides cell migration with minimal changes in temper-
ature and pH. Additional information is provided in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Design of Electrodes for Implantation into the Brain
In Vivo
Processed carbon rod and silver wire were used for current delivery
electrode and the measuring electrode, respectively. The para-
meters and the electric circuit are described in Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures.
Design of a Programmable Stimulator to Deliver
Electrical Stimulation In Vivo
We developed a programmable stimulator and fixed it on rat heads
for stimulation in vivo with free movement of rats. Information in
detail is provided in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Implantation of Electrodes in the Brain
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UC Davis
approved all animal procedures in this study. Sprague-Dawley
rats (Harlan, weighing 310–350 g) were used in the in vivo
experiments. Animal preparation and care, and procedures of anes-
thesia and surgery are described in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Delivery of Electrical Stimulation to the Brain In Vivo
The electric circuitry was completed when the implanted elec-
trodes were connected with the power supply or battery and volt-
meter/ammeter, respectively. When electric current was delivered,
real-time tissue currents, voltage, and resistance were recorded at
indicated measuring positions. The animal grouping and observa-
tion for this section are described in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
EEG During Electric Field Stimulation
Six rats were used for this part of the experiment. A level of anes-
thesia was maintained with �1.5% isoflurane for minimizing the
anesthetic effect on the EEG. The electrodes for electrical stimula-
tion and recording, the positions of the electrodes, and the para-
meters applied in the EEG testing are described in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Transplant of EGFP-hNSCs and Animal Groups
EGFP-hNSCs were prepared at 50,000 cells/mL in NSC medium. At
a speed of 1 mL/min, 5 mL of cell suspension was injected to
the middle point of RMS (x = 3.7 mm, anterior from bregma;
y = 1.2 mm, lateral from midline; z = �5.9 mm). A burr hole was
then filled with bone wax and the scalp incision was sutured.
Rats were placed into clean cages for recovery (one rat per cage
post operation). After transplantation of cells, animals were
randomly divided into three groups: control group (no electrodes
implanted, n = 7), sham group (electrodes implanted with no elec-
trical stimulation, n = 7), and electrical stimulation group (n = 10).
For the long-term survival of rats, animal care was continued
including observations of vocalizations, seizures, hemiplegic
paralysis, and body weight. For sham-cell control, 5 mL of neuro-
basal medium with no cells was injected (n = 3, euthanized at
34 hr, 3 weeks, and 4 months post injection, respectively).
reconstruction form serial brain sections. Electrical stimulation mobilized cells not only to the LV (lv-side) in the injection hemisphere, but
also into the contralateral hemisphere.
(C) Electrical stimulation increased distribution and the percentage of hNSCs to the LV side, which became more significant 3 weeks
and 4 months after stimulation. Numbers of the EGFP cells in every brain section were increased on the LV side, especially in the SVZ.
Means ± SEM from three independent experiments.
(D) Post-stimulation effects on the increased the migration distance on both the LV side and contralateral hemisphere. Means ± SEM from
three independent experiments.
Scale bars, 1 mm (A) and 100 mm (A1–A6).

 Delivery of Electric Currents to Guide Migration of
Transplanted EGFP-hNSCs
Twenty-four hours after cell transplantation, electrode implanta-
tion was performed. The output of power supply was adjusted for
a target EF strength of 50–70 mV/mm during the 10-hr intermit-
tent EF stimulation. Parameters were read from voltmeter,
ohmmeter, and ammeter every 15 min. The animal grouping,
animal care, and other information is provided in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Fixation of the Brain, Tissue Sectioning,
and Immunohistochemistry
The procedure for the fixation of the brain and tissue sectioning is
described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Brain sec-
tions were rehydrated and then blocked with blocking buffer con-
taining 2% goat serum (Gibco), 1% BSA (Sigma), 0.1% cold fish
skin gelatin (Sigma), 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and 0.05% Tween
20 (Sigma). Primary antibodies were incubated at room tempera-
ture for 1 hr followed by the application of second antibodies

Figure 6. hNSCs Migrated over the Cathode Electrode and to the SVZ, which Appeared to Have the Ability to Differentiate
(A) EF stimulation reversed the migration of hNSCs to the SVZ. hNSCs resided in large area of the SVZ 3 weeks post EF stimulation. EGFP
signals are mainly detected in the SVZ. The cells in green are not co-labeled red for either GFAP or TUJ1, indicating no differentiation to
astrocyte or neuron of the graft cells.
(B) Four months after transplantation and electrical stimulation, hNSCs maintained EGFP. Co-localization of EGFP signals with NEUN (in
CA1/CA2 region of hippocampus), GFAP (mainly in OB), IBA1 (in hippocampus), or MBP (found in RMS) (red) suggests possible differ-
entiation of hNSCs to neuron, astrocyte, microglia, or oligodendrocyte, respectively.
All nuclei are labeled in blue with DAPI. White arrows show typical differentiated cells. hNSCs, human neural stem cells; SVZ, subventricular

 (Alexa Fluor 594, Invitrogen). After washing with PBS, the tissue
sections were mounted with an anti-fade mounting medium/
DAPI mounting medium. The primary antibodies used were
rabbit anti-human SOX2 (#3579, Cell Signaling Technologies,
1:200), mouse anti-human nuclei (#MAB1281, Millipore, 1:200),
rabbit anti-GFAP (#AB5804, Millipore, 1:200), rabbit anti-TUJ1
(#ab24629, Abcam, 1:200), mouse anti-Neu-N (#MAB377, Milli-
pore, 1:500), goat anti-IBA1 (#ab107159, Abcam, 1:1,000), and
mouse anti-MBP (#ab24567, Abcam, 1:500).
Motor Functional Evaluation
Animals were trained to criteria on the behavioral tasks 2 days prior
to cell transplantation, with the final day serving as the pre-surgery
baseline. Electrical stimulation or controlled or sham interventions
were applied 24 hr post cell transplantation. Animals were first
tested on the Rotarod (Hamm et al., 1994) followed by horizontal
ladder on post-electrical stimulation days 1, 4, 7, 11, and 15. Addi-
tional information for the Rotarod test and horizontal ladder-walk
test are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Migration Analysis for EGFP Signals in Rat Brain
Brain sections were examined and analyzed with a fluorescent
microscope system (Keyence, model BZ-9000 [BIOREVO]). For
each individual rat brain, the center sagittal section was defined
as most clearly showing the stem cell injection track and
with the highest accumulation of EGFP signals. Two additional
sections +16 mm and �16 mm away, respectively, were also selected
for further detailed analysis. Thus three sections for each brain
(hemisphere) were chosen for initial detailed analysis of cell migra-
tion. Additional information is provided in Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures.
