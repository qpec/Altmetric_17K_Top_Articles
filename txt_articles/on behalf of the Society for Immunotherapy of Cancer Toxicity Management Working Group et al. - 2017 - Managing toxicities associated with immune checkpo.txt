Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has transformed the treatment of cancer. However, increasing use of immune-based
therapies, including the widely used class of agents known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, has exposed a
discrete group of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Many of these are driven by the same immunologic
mechanisms responsible for the drugs’ therapeutic effects, namely blockade of inhibitory mechanisms that suppress
the immune system and protect body tissues from an unconstrained acute or chronic immune response. Skin, gut,
endocrine, lung and musculoskeletal irAEs are relatively common, whereas cardiovascular, hematologic, renal,
neurologic and ophthalmologic irAEs occur much less frequently. The majority of irAEs are mild to moderate in
severity; however, serious and occasionally life-threatening irAEs are reported in the literature, and treatment-related
deaths occur in up to 2% of patients, varying by ICI. Immunotherapy-related irAEs typically have a delayed onset and
prolonged duration compared to adverse events from chemotherapy, and effective management depends on early
recognition and prompt intervention with immune suppression and/or immunomodulatory strategies. There is an
urgent need for multidisciplinary guidance reflecting broad-based perspectives on how to recognize, report and
manage organ-specific toxicities until evidence-based data are available to inform clinical decision-making. The Society
for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) established a multidisciplinary Toxicity Management Working Group, which met
for a full-day workshop to develop recommendations to standardize management of irAEs. Here we present their
consensus recommendations on managing toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

 Background
Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment
of cancer [1, 2]. Currently, the most widely used ap-
proach is the administration of targeted monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) directed against regulatory immune
checkpoint molecules that inhibit T cell activation [1].
At present, six immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are
approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for use in a variety of solid tumors, and one
hematological malignancy (Hodgkin lymphoma) [3]. Ipi-
limumab, a fully human IgG1 mAb that blocks the cyto-
toxic T lymphocyte-antigen-4 (CTLA-4), a checkpoint
inhibitor of T cell activation, was the first ICI approved,
in 2011, for use in advanced melanoma [4]. Pembrolizu-
mab and nivolumab, both engineered IgG4 mAbs that
regulate T cell activation by blocking the protein pro-
grammed death 1 (PD-1), received FDA approval in pa-
tients with advanced melanoma in 2014 [5, 6] and the
indications for both have subsequently expanded consid-
erably. Indeed, in a landmark regulatory step, the FDA re-
cently approved both pembrolizumab and nivolumab for
use in certain patients with mismatch repair deficient
(dMMR) and microsatellite instability high (MSI-H)
cancers that have progressed following treatment with
chemotherapy – the first such ‘tissue-agnostic’
, biomarker-
driven approvals granted [5, 6]. Both anti-PD-1 agents
are associated with negligible antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), a process that could be det-
rimental to the activation of T effector cells. After approval
of nivolumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung car-
cinoma (NSCLC) in 2015, the first immunotherapy com-
bination of ipilimumab plus nivolumab was granted
approval later in 2015, again in advanced melanoma [5].
More recently, the FDA approved three new ICIs, ate-
zolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab, all of which are
antibodies directed against the protein programmed
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Both atezolizumab and durvalu-
mab are engineered IgG1 mAbs that include Fc modifica-
tions that eliminate ADCC, while avelumab includes a
wildtype IgG1 framework with intact ADCC. Since May
2016, atezolizumab and durvalumab have both been ap-
proved for the treatment of NSCLC and urothelial carcin-
oma, and avelumab was approved for use in Merkel cell
carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma [7–9].
Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are discrete
toxicities caused by non-specific activation of the im-
mune system, and can affect almost any organ system.
In some studies, the reported incidence is as high as 90%
for any-grade irAEs due to single-agent ICI therapy [10],
but meta-analysis indicates an overall incidence <75% with
anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy (ipilimumab) [11], and ≤30% in
phase 3 trials of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents [12–14]. IrAEs ≥
grade 3 severity occur in up to 43% of patients taking
ipilimumab [10] and ≤20% taking PD-1/PD-L1 agents
[12, 15]. The incidence of irAEs with ipilimumab and
pembrolizumab is dose-dependent, with greater toxicity at
higher dose levels; toxicity also varies between the adju-
vant and metastatic disease settings [10, 16–19]. There is
significant variance in definitions of toxicity severity across
disciplines, as well as variation in how symptoms and
signs that may be attributable to the same underlying
pathophysiology are reported. This causes considerable
difficulty in obtaining accurate data on incidence and
prevalence based on clinical trials [12]. Nonetheless, the
incidence of most irAEs with ICI monotherapy appears to
be broadly similar across tumor types [12]. Some of the
mechanisms that underpin the development of inflamma-
tory toxicity – in particular those driven by CD8 T cell
activity – overlap with those responsible for the drugs’
therapeutic effects. However, the exact pathogenesis of
immune toxicity is not clear, and many other inflamma-
tory cells, such as Th17 and other types of cells, are re-
ported to be involved. The mechanism of toxicity may
also vary by ICI, and may ultimately affect acuity, chron-
icity and management. In some cases, irAEs may occur in
patients with durable responses to treatment; this associ-
ation has not been fully ascertained [20, 21].
With increasing patient exposure to immunotherapy,
the nature and range of irAEs is becoming more clearly
defined, and several new but serious adverse events have
been reported [22]. Skin, gut, endocrine, lung and muscu-
loskeletal irAEs are relatively common, whereas, cardiovas-
cular, hematologic, renal, neurologic and ophthalmologic
irAEs are well-recognized but occur much less frequently
(Fig. 1). Although the majority of irAEs are mild to moder-
ate in severity, serious, occasionally life-threatening irAEs
(e.g., severe colitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, toxic epider-
mal necrolysis, myocarditis, and autoimmune type I dia-
betes mellitus [T1DM] presenting as diabetic ketoacidosis),
are reported in the literature, and treatment-related deaths
have been reported in up to 2% of patients in clinical trials
[14, 23, 24]. As life-threatening irAEs are rare, and may
mimic other better-known conditions, there is growing
recognition of the need to educate both the oncology and
general medical communities in recognizing and institut-
ing urgent and appropriate treatment of these conditions.
Immune-related AEs resulting from immunotherapy can
have a delayed onset and prolonged duration compared to
adverse events resulting from chemotherapy (Fig. 2), in
part due to pharmacodynamic differences. Moreover, the
relationship between irAEs and dose/exposure remains to
be fully established [25]. As such, clinicians must remain
vigilant to the diverse clinical presentations of irAEs and
the possibility that patients may present with irAEs late in
the course of treatment, and – in some cases – months or
even years after treatment discontinuation [26, 27].
Nonetheless, since diagnostic tests may be invasive and
potentially costly, investigations should be undertaken

 judiciously and reserved for situations when the results
will guide patient management. Table 1 provides a list of
recommended tests to consider in all patients prior to ini-
tiating checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Effective management of irAEs depends on early rec-
ognition and prompt intervention with immune suppres-
sion and/or immunomodulatory strategies appropriate
to the affected organ and the severity of toxicity. Special-
ist physicians, nurses and pharmacists familiar with
irAEs should be involved early, and hospitalization may
be necessary in serious (≥ grade 4) or grade 3 irAEs that
do not respond to therapy, or to expedite work-up and
prevent complications from potentially life-threatening
irAEs [28]. Patient education on the potential for irAE
development is a key component of any pre-treatment
discussion with patients considered suitable candidates
for immunotherapy. It is also important to establish
physician networks to share outcomes of successful irAE
treatment strategies. Short-term adverse events due to
the use of moderate to high dose corticosteroids (e.g.,
opportunistic infections, sleep disturbance, gastritis, and
hypertension) should be anticipated. Patients receiving
long-term or high dose corticosteroids are at risk of de-
veloping diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis and should
receive vitamin D and calcium supplementation and, in
some cases, antibiotic prophylaxis [28]. However, con-
flicting reports on the associated between antibiotic use
and ICI efficacy pose as yet unanswered about whether
routine antimicrobial prophylaxis is appropriate in pa-
tients receiving ICIs [29, 30]. For steroid-refractory cases
and/or when steroid sparing is desirable, management
should be coordinated with disease specialists. Other im-
munomodulatory
agents,
such
as
infliximab,
other
tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), mycophenolate
mofetil, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), calcineurin in-
hibitors, methotrexate, or intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) and plasmapharesis may be required. However,
besides TNFi for colitis, these immunosuppressive treat-
ments have not been evaluated in large numbers of pa-
tients. Some retrospective analyses suggest that use of
corticosteroids for the management of irAEs is not asso-
ciated with inferior results of therapy [31, 32] but, due

 to confounding, the association of irAEs with immuno-
logic activity from immunosuppression, and with individ-
ual patient efficacy, is not clear. The effects of alternative
forms of immunosuppression on the efficacy of ICIs have
not yet been sufficiently studied.
As physicians, nurses and patients become aware of the
value of immune-based treatments, including the syner-
gies offered by combination immunotherapy strategies,
there is a pressing need for guidance on how to recognize,
report and manage irAEs that arise in the course of treat-
ment. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE) [33], a descriptive lexicon of terms and
adverse event severity, was developed by the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), with the goal of standardizing AE reporting across
medical specialties. However, increasing use of immuno-
therapy has clarified limitations in how immune-related
toxicities are addressed and classified within the current
CTCAE, as well as in other databases such as the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Import-
antly,
the
need
for
formal
pathways
for
reporting
suspected irAEs has also highlighted the tendency for
CTCAE grading to under- or over-estimate true irAE inci-
dence and/or severity [28]. In certain settings, such as with
rheumatologic irAEs, CTCAE criteria are difficult to apply
and do not allow accurate recording of the severity and
impact of irAEs, especially as conditions may become
chronic [34]. These shortcomings present an opportunity
to improve and streamline irAE reporting in the next
versions of CTCAE and MedDRA. Similarly, since drug
labels for FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitors are based
on clinical trial data for individual drugs and do not
always align across therapeutic class, clinicians need
multidisciplinary, broad perspective guidance on how to
manage organ-specific toxicities.
To this end, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer
(SITC) established a Toxicity Management Working Group
to develop consensus recommendations on management
of irAEs that develop following ICI therapy until evidence-
based data are available to inform clinical decision-making.
This report represents the outcome of a recent workshop
to standardize toxicity management. The results represent
consensus thinking by a multidisciplinary group of experts
in the field but should not replace sound clinical judgment
or personalized drug management, as immunotherapy pa-
tients often require highly individualized management.
Methods
Consensus group representation
In response to the need for a collaborative, multidisciplin-
ary approach to the management of ICI toxicities, the SITC
convened a one-day workshop on March 31st, 2017, in
Washington D.C. The meeting was a multi-stakeholder ef-
fort with participation from approximately 85 experts from
academia, government, industry, scientific organizations
and other related entities. Representation was sought from
medical oncologists, surgeons, disease subspecialists, basic
scientists, pharmacists, industry clinical, regulatory and
safety experts and nurses. In order to streamline recom-
mendations across the range of organizations active in
the area of cancer immunotherapy, SITC invited rep-
resentatives from the American Society of Clinical

Society (ONS) to participate in the workshop. To ensure
that commercial interests did not influence the outcomes
of the workshop, industry representatives participated in
group discussions but final approval of the workshop out-
put, and of this manuscript, was the responsibility of the
organizing committee, none of whom are employed by a
pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. Representa-
tives from the Office of Hematology and Oncology Prod-
ucts, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER),
were invited to review and provide feedback on the
final manuscript. Individuals selected as authors were
workshop organizers and lead discussants for individual
organ-specific toxicity breakout groups. All participants
were required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest
prior to participation.
Workshop objectives and procedures
The overarching goals of the workshop were twofold: 1)
to develop treatment algorithms for managing common
and rare immunotherapy-related toxicities and 2) to de-
velop standardized templates, including inclusion and
exclusion criteria, for irAE management in clinical trial
protocols (which will be reported separately). More
broadly, participants were charged with describing the
spectrum of immune-related toxicities and providing
recommendations on recognizing, monitoring and man-
aging these toxicities. To facilitate discussion among ex-
perts in different medical fields, attendees broke out into
11 subgroups (‘breakout groups’) that focused on irAEs
identified by body system (dermatologic, gastrointestinal,
endocrine,
pulmonary,
rheumatologic,
cardiovascular,
hematologic, renal, neurologic and ophthalmologic) as
well as infusion reactions. These breakout groups were
generally supplemented with disease subspecialty expert-
ise focused on the area of interest. Each breakout group
received instructions to guide their discussion, a list of
recognized toxicities by system, relevant drug package
inserts, several key supporting references, and a copy of
CTCAE version 4.0. A working draft of the Friends of
Cancer Research/Parker Institute for Cancer Immuno-
therapy guidelines on monitoring, management and
follow-up of irAEs from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents was
also distributed [35].
After separate breakout group discussions, one repre-
sentative from each group presented their recommenda-
tions to all participants, and responded to questions and
additional suggestions from the wider group. Following
the meeting, recommendations made on-site were recir-
culated by email to participants from each breakout
group to ensure all views and opinions were captured.
The final recommendations on management of irAEs
presented in this paper therefore represent the views of
each multidisciplinary expert group. These recommen-
dations are not intended to provide comprehensive med-
ical guidance on the management of disorders that may
arise from use of immunotherapy treatment; specialist
care should be sought as necessary, and as indicated in
treatment-specific guidelines.
Strengths and limitations of the consensus
recommendations
These consensus recommendations represent the views
of a broad range of experts from multiple fields of
expertise, and from large cancer organizations with differ-
ing areas of focus. In some cases they are driven by evi-
dence from the published literature; in others, particularly
where data are lacking, they are guided by accumulated
clinical experience and practice. The participation of
stakeholders from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries is another strength, ensuring that those in-
volved in drug research and development are part of the
discussion and that there is access to large industry-
collected patient databases. However, it is important to ac-
knowledge that evidence gaps are considerable, consensus
was not reached on all issues, and many questions remain
unanswered. Furthermore, not all working groups had
representation from all specialist groups (oncologist, dis-
ease specialist, nurse, pharmacist). The recommendations
may not take into account reimbursement restrictions that
could limit access to recommended drugs for some pa-
tients. Lastly, but importantly, there was no patient repre-
sentation. Finally, the recommendations addressed in this
document reflect irAEs related to PD-1/PD-L1 and
CTLA-4 inhibitors, and do not address toxicity that may
ensue following administration of other classes of im-
munotherapy, including chimeric antigen receptor T cell
(CAR T) therapy. It is unclear to what extent the recom-
mendations can be generalized to immunotherapy agents
other than those addressed in this manuscript, including
agents in development.
Consensus recommendations
The recommendations for managing toxicities associated
with ICIs, below, represent the consensus views of par-
ticipants in the 11 body system groups. Overall, irAEs
are broken down into two major categories, based on
the opinions of the workshop organizers regarding the
frequency with which they are seen in clinical practice:
frequently reported (dermatologic,
gastroenterological,
endocrine, respiratory, and rheumatologic/musculoskel-
etal) and uncommon (cardiovascular, hematologic, renal,
neurologic and ophthalmologic). Infusion reactions, which
are more common with mAbs based on a wildtype IgG1
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 5 of 28
 backbone and less common with IgG4 antibodies, are also
addressed. Within each body system, information is di-
vided into three sections: clinical presentation and epi-
demiology, diagnostic evaluation, and guidance on when
to refer to a disease specialist.
Management of irAEs relies heavily on corticosteroids,
and other immunomodulatory agents, which should be
prescribed judiciously to reduce the potential for short
and long-term complications. It remains unclear whether
prophylactic antibiotics should routinely be prescribed to
reduce the potential for opportunistic infection in patients
receiving steroids. Broadly, corticosteroid management
can be approached as shown in Table 2, but treatment
should be individualized depending on each patient’s med-
ical history; co-morbidities; underlying disease status; type,
number and severity of adverse events; ICI administered;
and ability to tolerate corticosteroids.
Table 3 summarizes the recommended management of
recognized irAEs across body systems.
Frequently reported immune-related adverse events
Dermatologic adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology Maculopapu-
lar rash and pruritus are common reactions to ICIs but
lichenoid, eczematous, and bullous dermatitis, and psoria-
sis have also been reported, albeit less frequently. Vitiligo
is frequently seen in the melanoma patient population.
Dermatologic toxicity (all grades) is reported in 30–40%
of patients taking PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors [13, 15], and
approximately 50% of patients treated with ipilimu-
mab [13]. A systematic review of the literature reported
that 13–20% of patients taking pembrolizumab or nivolu-
mab developed rash or pruritus (all-grade) and approxi-
mately 8% (all with melanoma) developed vitiligo [36],
which is associated with tumor response [20]. More re-
cently, several cases of hair re-pigmentation have also been
described in patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1
therapy [37]. Onset of skin irAEs typically occurs within
days or weeks of treatment [38] although onset may be de-
layed, appearing after several months of treatment [39].
Most dermatologic irAEs are low-grade and manageable,
[13, 36] although rare, potentially life-threatening exfolia-
tive dermatological conditions such as Stevens-Johnson
Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and drug
rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
have been reported [28]. Severe irAEs tend to occur more
commonly with combination ICI therapy [40]. Any clinical
suspicion of such reactions should prompt immediate spe-
cialist referral. Permanent discontinuation of immunother-
apy is mandatory for grade 4 dermatologic irAEs, SJS/
TEN, or DRESS syndrome.
Diagnostic evaluation: Given the frequency and persist-
ence of skin toxicities with ICIs, dermatologic assess-
ments are warranted in patients with a known history of
immune-related skin disorders such as psoriasis, bullous
pemphigoid or lupus. Non-specific maculopapular erup-
tions are commonly reported, which may, in part, reflect
the limitations of CTCAE in the classification of specific
subsets of skin disorders. Whenever possible, the irAE
should be categorized since management algorithms re-
flect the approach to idiopathic skin disorders, beyond
systemic immune suppression with steroids. Patients

1
Asymptomatic; clinical or diagnostic
observations only; intervention not indicated
[Grade 1 diarrhea frequency ≤ 4/day]
• Close follow up within 24–48 h for changes or progression
• Continue ICI
• If symptoms persist, start routine stool and blood tests
• Bland diet advisable during period of acute diarrhea
• Anti-diarrheal medication is optional but not highly
recommended when infectious work-up is negative.
2
Abdominal pain; mucus or blood in stool
[Grade 2 diarrhea frequency 4–6/day]
• Hold ICI
• Outpatient stool and blood work; CRP, ESR, fecal calprotectin,
lactoferrin, imaging and endoscopy are optional
• If diarrhea only, observe for 2–3 days. If no improvement start
prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent dose of
methylprednisolone); anti-diarrheal medication is not
recommended
• If diarrhea and colitis symptoms (abdominal pain +/− blood in
BM), start prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent dose of
methylprednisolone)immediately
○ If no improvement in 48 h, increase corticosteroid dose
to prednisone 2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent dose of
methylprednisolone)
○ If patient improves
▪ Taper corticosteroid over 4–6 weeks may be needed
▪ Resume ICI when corticosteroid is tapered to ≤10 mg/
day and patient remains symptom-free (grade ≤ 1)*
▪ Continue anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monotherapy
▪ If using combination anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1
immunotherapy, continue anti-PD-1 agent only
▪ ICI dose reduction is not recommended
• If colitis returns on resuming ICI:
○ Grade ≤ 2: temporarily hold ICI
○ Grade ≥ 3: permanently discontinue ICI

4
Grade 3: Severe abdominal pain; change in
bowel habits; medical intervention indicated;
peritoneal signs
[Grade 3 diarrhea frequency ≥ 7×/day]
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences;
urgent intervention indicated
• Grade 3: withhold ICI; consider resuming ICI when
corticosteroid is tapered to ≤10 mg/day and patient remains
symptom-free (grade ≤ 1). Consider hospitalization
• Grade 4: permanently discontinue ICI and hospitalize
• Blood and stool infection work-up, inflammatory markers,
imaging, endoscopy and GI consult
• Start intravenous prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent
dose of methylprednisolone) immediately
○ If patient improves, follow instructions for ‘If patient
improves’ for grade 2
• If refractory or no improvement on IV corticosteroid, start
prednisone 2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent dose of
methylprednisolone) for 3 days
• Consider other anti-inflammatory agents e.g. infliximab 5 mg/
kg, which can be given again after two weeks if a second dose
is needed. Vedolizumab may also be used (see Note 4 below).
Notes:
1. CBC with differential, CMP, ESR and CRP are recommended before starting immunotherapy, to provide baseline values for comparison over time.
Despite the association between elevated ESR and CRP and colitis, some insurance companies may not cover these tests.
2. There is no proven role for prophylactic corticosteroids (budesonide) to prevent GI irAEs [45, 47].
3. Response to infliximab generally occurs within 1–3 days although some patients benefit from a second dose after 2 weeks. Prolonged oral
prednisone taper may be required after infliximab administration. Whether infliximab reduces the antitumor efficacy of ipilimumab remains
unknown [103].
4. Case reports of successful treatment of steroid-dependent immune-related colitis using vedolizumab indicate this may benefit certain patients.
5. A GI consult is warranted in any patient who meets criteria for grade 2 diarrhea/colitis with negative infectious stool work up.

 Table 3 Recommended management of CTCAE-based immune-related adverse events due to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy
(Continued)
• If confirmed cardiac injury or decompensation, hold ICI therapy
until stabilized.
• Optimally treat identified cardiac conditions
• Consider corticosteroids if myocarditis suspected (Note 2)
4
Moderate to severe decompensation,
intravenous medication or intervention
required, life threatening conditions
• Permanently discontinue ICI
• If myocarditis is identified, consider high-dose corticosteroids
(1 mg/kg methylprednisolone (IV) for at least several days) until
improved to grade ≤ 1, after that consider at least 4–5 weeks
of tapering doses (Note 2).
• Add additional immunosuppressive agents in severe refractory
cases.
• Give additional supportive treatments, including appropriate
treatment of heart failure. Additional treatment of detected
cardiac conditions should be provided.*
✓
Notes:
1. Grades outlined here are not drawn from CTCAE.
2. Patients with confirmed myocarditis (or in cases of reasonable suspicion) should receive emergent high-dose corticosteroids. Until data are
available (e.g., cut-off levels of troponin) to determine when to start corticosteroids in patients with possible (as opposed to confirmed)
myocarditis, this decision should be made on a case by case basis. The importance of active, ongoing consultation with a cardiologist to discuss
the risk/benefit of continuing ICI therapy, starting corticosteroids, or instituting other cardiac treatments, cannot be overstated.
* Other therapies for management of myocarditis or pericarditis (viral based therapy, immunoglobulins, or plasmapheresis) are speculative at this
point in time.

 should undergo full skin and mucosal exam, taking note
of the extent and type of lesions present.
When to refer In cases of non-urgent or emergent refer-
ral, photographic documentation is recommended when a
new dermatologic manifestation appears, prior to imple-
menting treatment. This facilitates later classification of the
AE when necessary. A same-day dermatology consult is
warranted in any patient with blisters covering ≥1% body
surface area (BSA), a rash with mucosal involvement, any
rash covering ≥30% BSA, and rash with skin pain with or
without blisters (excluding dermatomal varicella zoster).
For these latter cases, skin biopsy is recommended to help
classify the event. Non-acute dermatology referral is rec-
ommended for rashes where diagnosis is unclear, grade 2
rash that is worsening, erythema multiforme, blistering dis-
orders of any BSA or for a rash consistent with psoriasis or
lichenoid dermatitis that has not responded to topical
intervention. Any grade 3 dermatologic toxicity warrants a
same-day dermatology consult. Patients with suspected
SJS/TEN, severe mucocutaneous reactions characterized
by epidermal necrosis and detachment, should be hospital-
ized immediately and a dermatologist consulted for admin-
istration of systemic immunosuppression.
The recommended management of common dermato-
logic irAEs is presented in Table 3; recommendations for
managing uncommon dermatologic irAEs is presented
in Additional file 1:Table S1.
Gastrointestinal adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Colitis
Diarrhea is one of the most frequently reported irAEs in
patients taking ICIs. Mild, transient, self-limited diarrhea
that occurs on initiation of an immune response should
be distinguished from other presentations. Onset occurs
after an average of three infusions [11], although it may
occcur as soon as following the first infusion. Incidence is
higher among patients taking combination anti-CTLA-4/
anti-PD-1 therapy (44%) than those receiving anti-CTLA-
4 (23–33%) or anti-PD-1 (≤19%) monotherapy. The com-
binatorial approach is also associated with increased risk
of grade 3/4 symptoms compared with monotherapy, and
the proportion of patients experiencing high-grade symp-
toms is greater with ipilimumab than anti-PD-1 or anti-
PD-L1 agents [15, 40, 41]. The presence of diarrhea in
conjunction with abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, mucus
in the stool, and fever should alert the clinician to the
possibility of colitis, a potentially serious or even life-
threatening gastrointestinal (GI) complication of ICI ther-
apy. Reports differ on the primary location of ICI colitis,
with some finding a uniform distribution [42], and others
observing that inflammation preferentially affects the
descending colon [43, 44], although this may be due to
less frequent examination of the proximal colon [44, 45].
Diarrhea and/or colitis may recur months after discon-
tinuation of immunotherapy and can mimic chronic in-
flammatory bowel disease (IBD) [42, 46].
Hepatitis
Less frequently observed, but nonetheless well-recognized
in patients treated with ICIs, is a typically asymptomatic
immune-related hepatitis characterized by elevated ala-
nine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransfer-
ase (AST), with or without raised bilirubin. Median onset
of transaminase elevation is approximately 6–14 weeks
after starting ICI treatment [28]. A minority of patients
present with fever. The incidence of any-grade hepatic en-
zyme disturbance with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy
is <4% and up to 15% when dosed at 10 mg/kg [24, 47].
Incidence of hepatitis in patients treated with anti-PD-1
ICIs is approximately 5%, but this rises to 30% in
patients treated with combination ipilimumab and
nivolumab [13, 28].

 Acute pancreatitis has been reported but is rare [42];
asymptomatic elevation of lipase and amylase are more
common. The role of the gut microbiome in determin-
ing treatment response and risk of toxicities, including
colitis, in patients treated with ICIs is an area of active
investigation.
Diagnostic evaluation
In the setting of acute diarrhea, initial evaluation should
exclude an infectious etiology (consider stool culture,
Clostridium difficile, cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR), stool ova and parasites).
Inflammatory markers (fecal leukocytes/lactoferrin, fecal
calprotectin) and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) may
help indicate whether there is an inflammatory process
underlying the diarrhea. Screening tests for tuberculosis,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis A
and B should be considered if there is potential for use
of systemic immunosuppression e.g. infliximab in the
near future. Based on the IBD literature, risk of hepatitis
C exacerbation is minimal; as a result, testing for hepa-
titis C is not recommended [48, 49].
Colitis
Radiologically, two distinct patterns of anti-CTLA-4-as-
sociated colitis have been observed on computed tomog-
raphy (CT) imaging: a more common diffuse colitis
characterized by mesenteric vessel engorgement, and a
segmental colitis with moderate wall thickening and
associated pericolonic fat stranding in a segment of pre-
existing diverticulosis [50]. A fluorodeoxyglucose positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT study can also dem-
onstrate new FDG-avid diffuse colonic wall thickening in
patients with immune-related colitis [50]. Colonoscopy is
the most accurate means of evaluating the extent and se-
verity of colitis and is recommended in appropriate cases
since recent data suggest that the presence of ulceration
on endoscopy predicts steroid-refractory disease [51]. For
grade ≥ 2 diarrhea, systemic immunosuppression should
be initiated promptly after ruling out infectious etiology.
Colonoscopy can be considered if deemed clinically neces-
sary, although it is worth noting that certain types of
colitis may have a normal endoscopic appearance,
with significant inflammatory features on histology.
Therefore, routine mucosal biopsies should be per-
formed for histological examination. In addition, path-
ology with immunohistochemical staining to rule out
CMV infection is critical.
Histologically, colitis that follows treatment with anti-
CTLA-4 antibodies is characterized by neutrophilic in-
flammation with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes,
crypt epithelial cell apoptosis and few or no features of
chronicity. Similarly, anti-PD-1-related colitis typically
follows one of two patterns: active colitis with apoptosis
(active inflammation, neutrophilic crypt micro-abscesses,
increased crypt epithelial cell apoptosis, and presence of
crypt atrophy/dropout) or lymphocytic colitis (increased
intraepithelial lymphocytes in surface epithelium, surface
epithelial injury, and expansion of the lamina propria).
Pathological changes may also be visible outside the colon
in the duodenum, stomach and/or small bowel [52].
Hepatitis
Liver function testing prior to initiation of ICIs, and
again before each cycle of treatment, can help determine
patterns of liver enzyme disturbance. Hepatitis following
ICI therapy is typically detected on routine serum liver
function tests. Other causes of liver damage such as viral
infection, alcohol, other medications or cancer progres-
sion should be excluded. Other thromboembolic and
outflow obstructive etiology should also be excluded
through imaging. On radiologic evaluation, ipilimumab-
associated hepatitis has been shown to present with
non-specific and variable findings according to clinical
severity [53]. Hepatomegaly, edema and enlarged lymph
nodes in the periportal region, and attenuated liver paren-
chyma may be evident on CT and MRI. Liver biopsy, only
necessary in complicated cases, may reveal predominantly
hepatocyte injury (acute hepatitis pattern) with sinusoidal
histiocytic infiltrates, central hepatic vein damage and
endothelial inflammation similar to autoimmune hepatitis,
or predominant bile duct injury (biliary pattern, with por-
tal inflammation) [53, 54]; rarely, fibrin ring granulomas
have also been reported [55].
When to refer
If infectious work-up is negative, diarrhea due to previous
immunotherapy exposure should be considered a possible
etiology since colitis can wax and wane after an initial epi-
sode. Endoscopy and histology may provide further clarifi-
cation, and the patient should be referred promptly to a
gastroenterologist who is experienced managing patients
with gastrointestinal adverse events after immunotherapy.
There are reports about progression of colitis to chronic
IBD long term [56] and such patients should be followed
by a gastroenterologist long term.
Endocrine adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
The two most common endocrine irAEs are acute hypophy-
sitis resulting in hypopituitarism (central hypothyroidism,
central adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonad-
ism), and thyroid disease or abnormalities in thyroid func-
tion tests (primary hypothyroidism and thyroiditis). Other
endocrinopathies such as primary adrenal insufficiency,
T1DM, hypercalcemia, and hypoparathyroidism have
been reported but are rare. The prevalence of these disor-
ders varies greatly. This may be due to the non-specific
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 17 of 28
 presenting signs and symptoms, such as, headache, fatigue,
anorexia and nausea, coupled with the fact that hormonal
abnormalities are not uncommon in patients with advanced
cancer. Diagnosis is also complicated by the fact that base-
line screening for endocrine abnormalities is not routinely
performed (other than thyroid function tests, in some
cases), and corticosteroids may be initiated empirically
for suspected irAEs, which interferes with subsequent
endocrine testing. A low threshold of clinical suspi-
cion is therefore warranted and, in the absence of al-
ternate etiologies, a diagnostic work-up for endocrine
dysfunction should be initiated.
Diagnostic evaluation
Routine monitoring for clinical signs and symptoms of
endocrinopathies,
and
patient
education,
are
recom-
mended. All patients should be tested before starting treat-
ment for thyroid (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]
and free thyroxine [freeT4]), early morning adrenal
(adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] and cortisol)
function, and glycemic control (glucose and glycated
hemoglobin [HbA1c]). In situations where new elevation
in glucose is noted, testing for blood or urinary ketones
should be considered. Before each cycle, thyroid testing
TSH and free T4) should be repeated, along with a base-
line metabolic panel to allow monitoring of glycemic
trends.. Routine monitoring with early morning ACTH
and cortisol levels should be considered (every month for
6 months, then every 3 months for 6 months then every
6 months for 1 year).
Hypophysitis
Hypophysitis is most commonly seen with anti CTLA-4
antibody monotherapy (ipilimumab, with an incidence
of ≤10% at a dose of 3 mg/kg and up to 17% at
10 mg/kg), and with combination ipilimumab/nivolumab
(incidence ≤13%) [10, 13, 16, 17, 57]. The median time
from starting ipilimumab to diagnosis of hypophysitis is
8–9 weeks, or after the third dose of ipilimumab [15, 58].
Symptoms commonly include headache (85%) and fatigue
(66%); visual changes are uncommon. Clinical suspicion of
hypophysitis is frequently raised when routine thyroid
function testing shows a low TSH with low free T4,
suggestive of a central etiology. Patients have various
degrees of anterior pituitary hormonal deficiency, with
central hypothyroidism being most commonly seen
(>90%), followed by central adrenal insufficiency, which is
also found in the majority of patients [59–61]. Both
central hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency occur
in >75% of patients and approximately 50% of patients
present with panhypopituitarism (adrenal insufficiency
plus hypothyroidism plus hypogonadism) [61–63]. On
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella, pituitary
enlargement can precede the development of clinical and
biochemical evidence of disease. MRI abnormalities, such
as stalk thickening, suprasellar convexity, heterogeneous
enhancement, and increased height of the gland as com-
pared with baseline scans (when available) are present in
most patients at the time of diagnosis. Resolution of pitu-
itary enlargement is common, with all cases resolved on
follow up scans after two months [60, 64].
All patients with suspected hypophysitis based on clin-
ical findings (headache, fatigue) or biochemical evalu-
ation (routine thyroid function testing showing low free
T4 with low/normal TSH) should undergo further test-
ing for diagnostic confirmation. Recommended tests,
preferably conducted in the morning around 8 am, in-
clude thyroid function (TSH, free T4), adrenal function
(ACTH, cortisol or 1 mcg cosyntropin stimulation test),
gonadal hormones (testosterone in men, estradiol in
women), follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing
hormone [LH]) and MRI of the sella, with pituitary cuts.
This should be done prior to administration of steroids.
Strict criteria for diagnostic confirmation of hypophysitis
are not currently available. Proposed confirmation cri-
teria include ≥1 pituitary hormone deficiency (TSH or
ACTH deficiency required) combined with an MRI ab-
normality, or ≥2 pituitary hormone deficiencies (TSH or
ACTH deficiency required) in the presence of headache
and other symptoms.
Management of confirmed hypophysitis includes re-
placement of deficient hormones (physiologic doses of ste-
roids and thyroid hormone). In the presence of both
adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism, steroids should
always be started prior to thyroid hormone in order to
avoid an adrenal crisis. High doses of steroids are necessary
in the setting of severe headaches, vision changes or ad-
renal crisis. Both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism
appear to represent long term sequelae of hypophysi-
tis and lifelong hormonal replacement is needed in
most cases [59, 64–66]. All patients with adrenal in-
sufficiency should be instructed to obtain and carry a
medical alert bracelet.
Thyroid dysfunction
Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism,
and thyroiditis) was reported in 6–20% of patients in
large phase 3 clinical trials.
Hypothyroidism
Patients with unexplained fatigue, weight gain, hair loss,
cold intolerance, constipation, depression and other rec-
ognized
symptoms
should
be
suspected
of
having
hypothyroidism. Lab tests showing high TSH and low
free T4 are indicative of biochemical hypothyroidism
and, if present, additional testing for thyroid antibodies
such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody is warranted.
Patients with confirmed hypothyroidism should be started
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 18 of 28
 on thyroid hormone, with repeat TSH and free T4 levels
evaluated 6–8 weeks later. Once a maintenance dose is
identified (TSH within normal range) clinical and biochem-
ical re-evaluation should be undertaken every 12 months.
Thyrotoxicosis
Thyrotoxicosis (high free T4 or total T3 with low or nor-
mal TSH) may occur secondary to thyroiditis or Graves’
disease. Thyroiditis is the most frequent cause of thyrotoxi-
cosis and is seen more commonly with anti-PD1/PD-L1
drugs than with anti-CTLA-4 agents; Graves’ disease is
very rare and occurs more commonly with anti-CTLA-4
drugs. Thyrotoxicosis due to thyroiditis may present with
weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, tremors, anxiety,
diarrhea and other symptoms of hypermetabolic activity,
although these symptoms may be masked if the patient is
taking beta-blockers. Most commonly, patients are asymp-
tomatic (painless thyroiditis) and routine laboratory moni-
toring shows high free T4 or triiodothyronine (T3) levels,
with low/normal TSH. A thyrotoxic phase occurs an aver-
age of one month after starting the drug. Additional tests
can be undertaken when thyroiditis is suspected, primarily
to rule out other causes of thyrotoxicosis such as Graves’
disease. These include thyroid stimulating hormone recep-
tor antibody [TRAb] or thyroid stimulating immunoglobu-
lin (TSI) and TPO as well as images when feasible:
radioactive iodine uptake scan (RAIUS) or Technetium
(Tc)-99 m [pertechnetate] thyroid scan if recent iodinated
contrast was used. Thyroiditis is a self-limiting process and
leads to permanent hypothyroidism after an average
of 1 month after the thyrotoxic phase and 2 months
from initiation of immunotherapy. Conservative manage-
ment during the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis is sufficient.
Non-selective beta blockers, preferably with alpha receptor-
blocking capacity, may be needed in symptomatic patients.
Repeat thyroid hormone levels should be performed every
2–3 weeks and thyroid hormone replacement initiated at
the time of hypothyroidism diagnosis [59, 64].
Type 1 diabetes mellitus
Development of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, nausea
and/or vomiting should prompt investigation for possible
development or worsening of T1DM. Diagnosis and
management of T1DM is based on recognized guidelines
[67]. Tests for antibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase
[GAD65], anti-insulin, anti-islet cell A, zinc transporter 8
[Zn-T8]), C-peptide and insulin could distinguish between
type 1 and type 2 disease.
When to refer
An endocrinology consultation is recommended in all
cases of suspected or confirmed hypophysitis, primary
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, type 1 DM
and all rare endocrinopathies.
Pulmonary adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Pneumonitis
The most common lung toxicity observed in patients re-
ceiving ICI treatment is pneumonitis. The overall inci-
dence of pneumonitis associated with PD-1/PDL-1 and
CTLA-4-targeted therapies is <5%, with high-grade
(≥grade 3) events occurring in 1–2% of patients. Higher
rates have been reported for combinations of PD-1 and
CTLA-4 inhibitors [68]. These numbers are not clinic-
ally trivial, as pneumonitis is one of the most common
causes of ICI-related death. Moreover, the incidence of
pneumonitis is increasing as therapeutic indications for
ICIs expand, and more complex regimens are developed.
Pneumonitis may present on imaging studies as crypto-
genic organizing pneumonia (COP), nonspecific interstitial
pneumonitis (NSIP), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), or
usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP)/pulmonary fibrosis
(PF). Clinical and radiographic findings of ICI-related pneu-
monitis may closely mimic
pneumonia, lymphangitic
spread of disease, cancer progression, and diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage. The radiographic appearance of pneumonitis
may be clinically asymptomatic or, alternatively, associated
with new or worsening shortness of breath, cough, wheez-
ing, chest pain, reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue with ac-
tivities of daily living (ADL) and new or increasing
requirement for supplementary oxygen. Acuity of onset
and severity may also vary, suggesting the importance of
vigilance and rapid response in some cases. Studies have
suggested a higher incidence of any grade (3.6% vs. 1.3%)
and severe (1.1% vs. 0.4%) pneumonitis with PD-1 inhibi-
tors compared with PD-L1 inhibitors [69]. Combination
therapies with anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immuno-
therapy and with ICI/cytotoxic combinations also confer a
higher risk of pneumonitis versus ICI monotherapy
[68, 70]. Higher rates of pneumonitis have also been re-
ported among ICI-treated patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) compared to patients with melanoma
[71]. Pneumonitis onset appears earlier in cases of NSCLC
(median [range]: 2.1 [0.2–27.4] months) versus melanoma
(median [range]: 5.2 [0.2–18.1] months) [72]. IrAEs associ-
ated with other organ systems, including hepatitis, colitis,
duodenitis, esophagitis, thyroiditis, hypophysitis, arthritis,
myositis, vitiligo, nephritis, and anemia may occur in up to
50% of patients and confound therapy. These irAEs may
occur concomitantly, precede or follow the development of
pneumonitis. In patients with preexisting lung diseases,
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or
PF, the diagnosis of pneumonitis is particularly challenging
and failure to recognize and treat pneumonitis in a timely
manner could lead to poor clinical outcomes.
In addition to pneumonitis, ICI therapy has been associ-
ated with pleural effusions, pulmonary sarcoidosis and
sarcoid-like granulomatous reactions. Sarcoid-like reactions
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 19 of 28
 have been reported following both CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-
L1-targeted therapies. Increased numbers of T helper 17
(Th17.1) cells are seen in the bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) fluid of these patients, suggesting that TH17 cells
may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this dis-
ease [73]. Sarcoidosis may be asymptomatic or present
with cough, wheezing, fatigue and/or chest pain. Data in
this area are scant at present, although case reports sug-
gest that the development of sarcoidosis may be associated
with prolonged cancer response [74, 75].
Treatment strategies for ICI related pneumonitis, based
on pneumonitis grade, are detailed in Table 3. Patients with
grades 1–2 pneumonitis may be managed as outpatients
while those with pneumonitis grade 3 or higher typically re-
quire hospitalization. Drug withdrawal is the mainstay of
treatment for pneumonitis of all grades. For patients with
grade 1 pneumonitis, re-challenge following resolution of
infiltrates and close follow-up is reasonable. In these pa-
tients, symptoms should be monitored every 2–3 days. A
repeat chest CT should be performed prior to the next
scheduled dose of ICI and if the infiltrates have resolved,
ICI therapy may be cautiously resumed with close follow-
up. Bronchoscopy should be considered for evidence of
new or persistent infiltrates. Patients with grade 2 or higher
pneumonitis may require oral/intravenous corticosteroids.
Recrudescence of pneumonitis signs and symptoms has
been reported following rapid steroid taper; a minimum
4–6 week taper is therefore recommended. Additional im-
munosuppression with infliximab and/or cyclophospha-
mide is warranted among patients with recalcitrant disease.
Sarcoidosis
Once a diagnosis of sarcoidosis is established, immuno-
therapy should be withheld, particularly in patients with
extensive disease (stage ≥2), extrapulmonary disease in-
volving critical organ systems (ocular, myocardial, neuro-
logic, renal), or sarcoid-related hypercalcemia. Treatment
for irAE-related sarcoidosis should be considered if there
is 1) progressive radiographic change; 2) persistent and/or
troublesome pulmonary symptoms; 3) lung function de-
terioration (total lung capacity (TLC) decline of ≥10%,
forced vital capacity (FVC) decline of ≥15%; diffusing cap-
acity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) de-
cline of ≥20%); 4) concomitant involvement of critical
extrapulmonary organ systems; or 5) sarcoid-related hyper-
calcemia. These guidelines are extrapolated from standard
management guidelines for sarcoidosis in the general
population. Further investigations of sarcoidosis manage-
ment in the ICI setting are needed.
Diagnostic evaluation
Pneumonitis
The diagnosis of pneumonitis is suggested by the presence
of new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates and ground
glass changes on lung imaging studies. The infiltrates are
typically bilateral, but may be asymmetric. CT imaging is
more reliable than chest radiographs in identifying these
changes, and is the imaging modality of choice. Baseline
and ongoing oxygen saturation (at rest and on ambula-
tion) should be monitored in all patients, as well as chest
CT, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and a 6-min walk
test (6MWT). A pulmonology consult is warranted in any
patient with suspected pneumonitis. Atypical symptoms
such as fever and productive cough should also trigger an
infectious disease consultation. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
with BAL may be helpful in excluding competing diagno-
ses. Lung biopsies are typically not warranted, but may be
useful in the setting of suspicious lesions and unexplained
lymphadenopathy.
Sarcoidosis
The diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis is suggested by
radiographic evidence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy
and irregular densities, coupled with histologic evidence
of epithelioid non-caseating granulomas obtained from
endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), fine needle aspiration
(FNA) or transbronchial lung biopsy (TBBx). Since sar-
coidosis can mimic malignant disease progression, both
clinicians and radiologists should be aware of this possibil-
ity. Confirmation requires exclusion of infections and
other competing diagnoses. Patients may also present with
extrapulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis. Therefore,
once the diagnosis is established an eye examination and
baseline electrocardiogram should be considered to inves-
tigate involvement of other organ systems. The natural
history of irAE-related sarcoidosis is not known and treat-
ment strategies for sarcoid in this setting have not been
established.
When to refer
Referral to a pulmonary specialist for bronchoscopy should
be pursued in all patients with radiographic and/or clinical
evidence of pneumonitis. Such evidence includes new pul-
monary infiltrates on lung imaging, or new or worsened
hypoxemia, dyspnea or cough. Unexplained lymphadenop-
athy or atypical pulmonary nodules and densities should
also prompt a pulmonary referral. Infectious disease
consultation should be considered for patients with ≥
grade 2 pneumonitis. Long-term specialist follow-up is
also advisable in any patient with confirmed immune-
related lung disease.
Rheumatologic/musculoskeletal adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Recognizing rheumatologic and musculoskeletal irAEs in
the oncology setting is challenging due to the broad range
of potential presenting symptoms and the prevalence of
musculoskeletal complaints in the general population.
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 20 of 28
 Although a paucity of epidemiological data limits our un-
derstanding of the true incidence of these irAEs, they are
increasingly reported across care settings. Since delayed
diagnosis and treatment can lead to long-term disability,
and disorders may become chronic and require ongoing
immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy, it is im-
portant to understand typical symptom presentation and
recommended management. Preserving quality of life and
ability to perform ADL is a priority.
One of the most commonly reported rheumatologic
irAEs is an inflammatory oligo or polyarthritis that can
lead to rapid joint damage and may persist after discon-
tinuation of immunotherapy. Arthralgia has been re-
ported in approximately 15% of patients receiving ICIs,
but the incidence of inflammatory arthritis, which is
typically grade 2 or less, has not yet been systematically
reported [76]. Arthritis is rarely the sole irAE, with most
patients having other organ systems involvement. In a
small series, the median time to onset was five months
after starting ICI therapy. Clinically, three phenotypes
have been described: 1) predominantly large joint react-
ive arthritis that, on occasion, develops in association
with conjunctivitis and uveitis; 2) polyarthritis resem-
bling rheumatoid-like arthritis, affecting the small joints
of the hand (metacarpophalangeal [MCP], proximal in-
terphalangeal [PIP] joints or wrist), rarely associated
with typical rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated
protein antibodies (ACPA), but potentially erosive; and
3) seronegative, oligo and polyarthritis, typically starting
in the medium/large joints, characterized by synovitis
and involvement of tendons and entheses, with or without
joint erosions. Combination anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 ther-
apy is associated with a greater risk of arthritis than mono-
therapy, although incidence is unaffected by drug or type
of malignancy. Management often requires moderate-dose
corticosteroids, sometimes in conjunction with steroid-
sparing immunomodulators and disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including tumor necrosis
factor inhibitors (TNFi), methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfa-
salazine, and hydroxychloroquine. Persistence of inflamma-
tory arthritis up to two years after discontinuation of ICIs
has been seen, with ongoing requirement for immunomod-
ulatory therapy. Beyond arthritis, less commonly reported
rheumatologic irAEs recognized in the context of ICI ther-
apy include sicca, with severe eye and mouth dryness, and
parotitis; inflammatory myositis, most commonly resem-
bling polymyositis, occasionally resulting in rhabdomyoly-
sis; vasculitides including giant cell arteritis (GCA) and
polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR); systemic lupus erythema-
tosus (SLE) and sarcoidosis [76, 77].
One of the primary difficulties in ensuring accurate
reporting of rheumatologic irAEs is the nature of severity
grading in the current CTCAE. The current version (ver-
sion 4) classifies many clinically significant rheumatologic
events that require corticosteroids or immunomodulatory
treatment
as
grade
1/2,
whereas
the
rheumatology
CTCAE (rCTCAE) compiled by the Outcome Measures
in Rheumatology network (formerly Outcome Measures
in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials; OMERACT)
(RCTCAE version 2.0) [34] classifies similar symptoms
one or two severity grades higher. Of particular import-
ance, the current CTCAE classifies impairment in instru-
mental
ADLs
(taking
medications,
preparing
meals,
housework, using transportation) as grade 2, despite the
fact that this represents a considerable degree of func-
tional disability and loss of independence. This also has
implications for the detection of “clinically significant”
musculoskeletal irAEs in clinical trial databases.
Current CTCAE terms for musculoskeletal symptoms
(e.g. arthritis and myositis) are not easily converted to
clinically relevant descriptors. Lack of precision may result
in diffusion of an irAE signal, distorting the epidemio-
logical landscape. For example, oncologists must choose
between several different codes to document a swollen
joint (joint effusion, joint pain, joint function, arthritis) or
muscle weakness (myalgia, muscle weakness, change in
lower extremity function). As such, it may be more appro-
priate to aggregate similar coding subtypes to better re-
flect the true incidence of musculoskeletal irAEs.
Diagnostic evaluation
A diagnostic algorithm for inflammatory arthritis has re-
cently been reported [78]. The SITC Toxicity Management
Working Group evaluated and discussed this algorithm and
made suggestions for its modification. The revisions are
noted below.
Grade 1: Joint examination (swelling/tenderness), func-
tional assessment, consider rheumatology referral, espe-
cially if symptoms persist.
Grade 2/3: Joint examination, functional assessment,
consider laboratory testing (antinuclear antibody [ANA]
rheumatoid factor [RF], cyclic citrullinated peptide anti-
body [anti-CCP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]/
C-reactive protein [CRP]). Consider imaging (plain X-
ray of affected joints, joint MRI and/or musculoskeletal
ultrasound).
When to refer
All patients with CTCAE ≥ grade 2 inflammatory arthritis
should be referred to rheumatology. Also consider refer-
ring any patient whose symptoms persist for >6 weeks or
who requires >20 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily that
cannot be tapered to <10 mg/day within 4 weeks [78]. All
patients with suspected myositis, presenting with muscle
weakness and elevated creatine kinase (CK), should be
referred to rheumatology or neurology, as this can be a
life-threatening adverse event.
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 21 of 28
 Because erosive, irreversible joint damage has been seen
within weeks of symptom onset, early involvement of rheu-
matologists is recommended to determine if additional
disease-modifying therapy beyond steroids is required.
For other suspected rheumatologic manifestations (e.g.
vasculitis, myositis, scleroderma, etc.), rheumatology re-
ferral is advisable even if the symptoms are mild, to en-
sure that appropriate diagnostic testing and optimal
management can be coordinated to prevent permanent
organ damage.
Infusion reactions
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Infusion reactions may present with constitutional symp-
toms such as fever, rigor, pruritus, hypotension, dyspnea,
chest discomfort, rash, urticaria, angioedema, wheezing or
tachycardia, as well as the possibility of anaphylaxis re-
quiring urgent intervention. Infusion reactions (all grades)
are reported in 25% of patients receiving avelumab (pre-
medication with acetaminophen and an antihistamine is
recommended) [7] and in less than 10% of patients receiv-
ing other approved immune checkpoints inhibitors [5–9,
79–81]. Infusions of ipilimumab appear to be well-
tolerated, with a low incidence (<6%) of infusion reactions
even when the infusion is delivered over 30 min (as op-
posed to the standard 90 min timeframe) when patients
are pre-medicated with diphenhydramine and/or cortico-
steroids [82]. Severe/life-threatening infusion reactions oc-
curred in less than 2% of the patients. Mild to moderate
reactions are managed with symptomatic treatment
and by reducing the rate or temporarily interrupting
the infusion [4–9]. Severe/life-threatening reactions
should be managed promptly and in accordance with
the institutional guideline for infusion reactions; perman-
ent discontinuation is recommended for such cases
(grades 3 or 4) [80].
Diagnostic evaluation
Infusion reactions are common to many cancer treat-
ments and appropriate training and procedures should
be in place while patients are receiving an immunother-
apy infusion. The severity of an infusion reaction should
be rapidly assessed and appropriate treatment imple-
mented in accordance with the institutional guideline.
Life-threatening reactions with hypoxia and/or shock
should be aggressively managed [80].
When to refer
Cancer patients often receive more than one drug during
infusion; patients with severe or life-threatening reac-
tions (CTCAE grade 3 or 4) should therefore be referred
to an allergist. Appropriate assessment and counseling
could prevent future re-exposure to drugs that have pre-
viously caused severe reactions.
Uncommon immune-related adverse events
Cardiovascular adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Cardiac irAEs due to ICIs may present with non-specific
symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. However, more
typical cardiac symptoms of chest pain, shortness of
breath, pulmonary or lower extremity edema, palpita-
tions, irregular heartbeat, rapid onset of heart failure
symptoms or new heart block on electrocardiogram
(ECG) can occur at any time, more frequently within the
first few months of treatment. Other signs and symp-
toms may include muscle pain or syncope. Patients who
develop immune toxicities of other organ systems may
also develop cardiovascular toxicities, potentially with
symptoms that overlap with myositis (myalgias, rhabdo-
myolysis) or myocarditis or pericarditis (fever, chest pain
with inspiration, diffuse ST elevation on ECG), making
accurate diagnosis a considerable challenge. It is sug-
gested that there may be a link between rhabdomyolysis/
myositis, vasculitis and cardiac toxicity. However, myo-
carditis, pericarditis and cardiac dysfunction due to ICIs
are rare and the true incidence is unknown; current esti-
mates suggest less than 1% of patients [22]. Moreover, due
to varying definitions of cardiotoxicity [83], the obscurity
of CTCAE entries for some cardiac irAEs, especially myo-
carditis, and the absence of systematic monitoring or cod-
ing mechanism for cardiac events in immunotherapy
trials, cardiac irAEs are likely under-reported. In particu-
lar, myocarditis is a difficult diagnosis to make in any clin-
ical situation, but especially in a patient being actively
treated for cancer [84]. The expert consensus is to have
high vigilance for development of cardiac symptoms in all
patients, but especially in those with evidence of myocar-
ditis, vasculitis or myositis.
Cardiac irAEs are seen across the ICI drug class, with
higher incidence in patients taking combination anti-
CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 treatment compared to monotherapy.
Patients, including those with known cardiac comorbidi-
ties, should not be denied therapy with ICIs solely on the
basis of the potential for cardiotoxicity, but the level of
vigilance has to be raised. The non-specific presentation of
cardiac irAEs and potential to cause rapid clinical deterior-
ation with a higher than acceptable rate of mortality with
cardiac toxicity, make it imperative to maintain a low
threshold for clinical suspicion and early specialist referral.
Diagnostic evaluation
At baseline, prior to initiating ICI therapy, it is suggested
that a judicious combination of biomarkers (e.g., tropo-
nin I or T, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal
pro B-type natriuretic peptide [NT pro-BNP], total CK,
fasting lipid profile, total CK and an electrocardiogram
[ECG] be evaluated in all patients). Myocarditis is very
rare but other potentially serious cardiac manifestations
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 22 of 28
 (life-threatening rhythm disturbances and acute coron-
ary syndromes) are reported more commonly [85]. Since
the major indicator of suspicion for both myocarditis
and acute coronary syndrome is elevated troponin, a
fasting lipid profile serves as an important screening tool
to distinguish between atherosclerosis-related troponin
elevation and potential myocarditis. Two-dimensional
echocardiography (2-D Echo) may also be warranted in
high-risk patients with cardiac history, symptoms of
dyspnea, or if initial tests are abnormal. Serial ECGs
and cardiac biomarker testing should be considered,
particularly in patients with abnormal baseline investi-
gations or suspicious symptoms. There are no current
recommendations for the appropriate time interval
between tests. Patients who develop concerning symp-
toms while undergoing ICI therapy should have chest
imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism, pneumon-
itis, or pulmonary edema, as well as an ECG; cardiac
biomarkers done at baseline evaluation should be
retested. A repeat 2D Echo should be considered in
any patient who has significant dyspnea or abnormal
cardiac safety screening tests.
When to refer
An accurate baseline CV risk assessment should be
undertaken, including consultation with a cardiologist if
appropriate, in any patient who has multiple CV risk
factors or established CV disease at the onset of immune
therapy. Immediate referral is warranted for any patient
who develops abnormal cardiac test results during the
course of ICI therapy. Since myocarditis can rapidly lead
to death, patients with suspected or documented myo-
carditis should be admitted to the hospital for cardiac
monitoring. Patients with confirmed myocarditis should
receive emergent intervention with high dose corticoste-
roids, and immediate discontinuation of immunotherapy.
Until data are available (e.g., cut-off levels of troponin) to
determine when to start corticosteroids in patients with
possible (as opposed to confirmed) myocarditis, this deci-
sion should be made on a case by case basis. The import-
ance of active, ongoing consultation with a cardiologist to
discuss the risk/benefit of continuing ICI therapy, starting
steroids, or instituting other cardiac treatments, cannot be
overstated.
Hematologic adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Although rare, hematologic irAEs have been described fol-
lowing ICI treatment and the literature includes case re-
ports of hemolytic anemia, red cell aplasia, neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, myelodysplasia and hemophilia A
[15, 28, 86]. An active hematologic irAE also needs to
be distinguished from transient changes in laboratory
values that can occur during initiation of an immune
response. Post treatment lymphcytosis, eosinophilia, neu-
trophilia and monocytosis can be observed and are not typ-
ically clinically significant though some reports suggest they
may be prognostic [87]. Persistent post treatment cytope-
nias or progressive cytopenias should be evaluated for
autoimmune causes as well as with a peripheral smear, re-
ticulocyte count and assessment for hemolysis [88]. Causal
attribution is complicated by the fact that malignant disease
and its complications can also lead to cytopenias. Since the
CTCAE definition of thrombocytopenia describes absolute
platelet levels rather than an indication of changes in cell
number, it is not a reliable tool for evaluating potentially
life-threatening ICI-induced thrombocytopenia.
Diagnostic evaluation
Complete blood count (CBC) should be monitored at the
start of immune therapy, at intervals during treatment, and
periodically in long-term survivors who are no longer re-
ceiving treatment. Development of anemia should prompt
evaluation for common causes such as GI bleeding,
cancer-related anemia or cancer progression, or causative
drugs, including a work up for hemolysis. If the source of
anemia cannot be identified, bone marrow biopsy may be
indicated to rule out red cell aplasia. Similarly, any patient
who develops thrombocytopenia or neutropenia should be
evaluated for potential causes including medication-related
cell destruction or disease progression; in cases where an
obvious cause cannot be identified, an autoimmune cause
should be considered and investigated accordingly.
When to refer
In general, patients with unexplained cytopenias should
be referred to hematology for evaluation.
Renal adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Overall, renal irAEs are considered rare, occurring in 2%
(ICI monotherapy) to 5% (combination ipilimumab/nivolu-
mab) of patients taking ICIs, with underlying pathology
only beginning to be characterized and reported [89, 90].
Most reports document isolated cases of interstitial neph-
ritis with specific agents and regimens, such as anti-PD-1
monotherapy, and combination anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 treat-
ment, in melanoma [91, 92]. Nephritis has not been associ-
ated with anti-PD-L1 monotherapy to date. Three cases of
acute renal failure were also reported during a study of
nivolumab and doublet platinum chemotherapy in NSCLC
[93]. There are also case reports of lupus nephritis [94] and
granulomatous nephritis [95, 96] following ipilimumab
treatment, and a single case of nephritis described after
treatment with avelumab [97]. However, recent data suggest
the incidence of renal irAEs may be under-reported with
low-grade kidney injury affecting 25–29% of patients taking
certain ICIs [90]. The onset of renal injury seen with PD-1
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 23 of 28
 inhibitors usually occurs 3–10 months after initiation of
treatment, whereas irAEs secondary to anti-CTLA-4 agents
tend to have an earlier onset, after 2–3 months [90].
Renal toxicity from ICIs is usually asymptomatic, although
oliguria, hematuria, peripheral edema and anorexia are oc-
casionally reported. Management requires considerable
clinical judgment.
Diagnostic evaluation
Diagnosis of renal impairment may be complicated by
concomitant medications that precede, or are prescribed
during the course of, immunotherapy treatment. None-
theless, evidence of gradually rising serum creatinine
should prompt clinical suspicion. As such, serum cre-
atinine should be monitored on starting immunotherapy
treatment, and at intervals throughout the treatment
course. If creatinine remains elevated for >2–3 days,
monitor weekly (grade 1) or every 2–3 days (grade 2). It
is important to exclude other causes of renal dysfunction
through active inquiry about new medications, correc-
tion of dehydration and, possibly, additional investiga-
tions such as bladder and/or renal ultrasound, urinalysis,
assessment of serum electrolytes, or other studies based
on history. In suspected cases of immune-related renal
disease, renal biopsy should be considered to confirm
etiology and guide management. Because renal toxicity
typically resolves, treatment can resume if grade 2–3
adverse events resolve promptly, but therapy should be
discontinued in the face of persistent or recurrent grade
2–3 adverse events, or emergence of grade 4 toxicity. A
nephrology consult should be considered for any persist-
ent ≥ grade 3 renal impairment, or for recurrent renal
toxicity following a corticosteroid trial.
When to refer
A nephrology consult should be considered in patients
with persistent grade 2–3 elevation in creatinine, ≥ 3-fold
increase in creatinine over baseline, or whenever there is
evidence of metabolic change consistent with renal failure.
Neurologic adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Neurologic irAEs are uncommon, with an overall inci-
dence of <4% following treatment with anti-CTLA-4
antibodies, 6% with anti-PD-1 antibodies, and 12% with
combination therapy involving both [98]. Most events
are mild and present with non-specific symptoms such
as headache; irAEs grade 3 or higher occur in <1% of
patients [98]. Examples of neurologic irAEs include auto-
immune encephalitis, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia
gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, peripheral sensorimotor
neuropathies, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syn-
drome (PRES), aseptic meningitis and transverse myelitis
[99]. Relevant CTCAE terms include encephalopathy,
leukoencephalopathy, peripheral motor neuropathy, per-
ipheral sensory neuropathy reversible posterior leukoence-
phalopathy syndrome, and ‘nervous system not otherwise
specified’. Common presenting features of autoimmune
encephalitis, meningitis and encephalopathy include al-
tered mental status, headache, seizures, focal neurologic
abnormalities and PRES.
Diagnostic evaluation
Diagnostic work-up should include history and physical
examination with full neurologic exam in all patients.
Evaluation of possible autoimmune encephalitis, menin-
gitis and encephalopathy should include lumbar punc-
ture and brain MRI, with and without contrast; it is
important to rule out infection, screen for unsuspected
central nervous system (CNS) metastasis and/or lepto-
meningeal spread. Paraneoplastic syndromes should also
be considered. Diagnostic evaluation of suspected per-
ipheral sensorimotor neuropathies should include differ-
ential diagnosis of disorders including, but not limited
to, diabetic neuropathy and vitamin B12 deficiency. Con-
sider imaging as appropriate, as well as nerve biopsy;
this is a diagnosis of exclusion, but in most cases it is a
clinical diagnosis.
When to refer
Neurology consultation is recommended for all neuro-
logic irAEs grade 2 and higher.
Ophthalmologic adverse events
Clinical presentation and epidemiology
Ocular irAEs, predominantly uveitis (anterior more com-
monly than posterior or panuveitis) are reported in <1% of
patients taking ICIs [13, 15]. There have also been reports
of orbital inflammation, episcleritis, blepharitis, optic nerve
swelling, peripheral ulcerative keratitis and Vogt-Koyanagi-
Harada picture with localized serous retinal detachment
[100–102]. Patients prescribed ICIs should be advised to
alert the clinician to new onset of blurred vision, floaters,
flashing lights, changes in color vision, eye redness, photo-
phobia or light sensitivity, visual distortion and visual field
changes, scotomas, tender eyes or pain on eye movement,
eyelid swelling or proptosis or double vision. Patient coun-
seling is crucial to ensure that early signs and symptoms
are recognized in a timely manner.
Diagnostic evaluation
Although prompt ophthalmologic referral is important
in ALL cases of visual complaints, certain tests can be
performed by the oncologist in the office. These include
examination for visual acuity, which can be done using
an eye chart on a smart phone with the patient wearing
reading glasses for near vision or glasses for distant vi-
sion, as necessary; color vision; red reflex; pupils (equal,
Puzanov et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:95 
Page 24 of 28
 round, reactive), including testing for an afferent pupillary
defect, which can indicate optic nerve or extensive retinal
disease; and penlight inspection of the anterior part of the
eye. Direct ophthalmoscopy to examine the optic nerve
and retina is unlikely to be useful for diagnosis of ret-
inal or optic nerve issues when performed by a non-
ophthalmology-trained physician. Ocular irAEs may be
asymmetric so it is important to examine each eye separ-
ately. Ocular irAEs are frequently accompanied by irAEs
in other systems, especially colitis, so broader systems
inquiry is helpful.
When to refer
Complaints of red, painful, dry or irritated eyes, or visual
disturbance in a patient taking an ICI should alert the
clinician to the need for immediate ophthalmological re-
ferral for diagnosis, classification and management, which
can be difficult for the oncologist since different ocular
pathologies and grades may present with similar symp-
toms and detailed ophthalmological evaluation needs to
be performed by an ophthalmologist, including a slit lamp
exam and dilated fundus exam. Sometimes grade 2 or 3
severity irAEs may only present with asymptomatic or
mild changes in vision, and time to ophthalmology access
can vary depending on the setting (academic versus com-
munity hospital). Clinical suspicion and prompt referral
are therefore essential. Starting systemic or topical treat-
ment with corticosteroids prior to conducting an eye
exam should be avoided unless systemic steroids are indi-
cated for a concurrent, non-ophthalmological toxicity,
since it may worsen ocular conditions that are due to in-
fection (e.g., herpetic keratitis/uveitis) or may mask accur-
ate diagnosis and severity grading when the patient is
examined by an ophthalmologist. Urgent referral is war-
ranted for any grade 3 or 4 irAEs, but even patients with
grade 1 or 2 toxicities should undergo full ophthalmo-
logical evaluation, proper grading, work up and treatment
evaluation by an ophthalmologist within a few days.
Puffy eyelids may indicate early preseptal cellulitis,
which requires systemic antibiotic treatment. Warning
signs (eyelid swelling with pain and erythema, proptosis,
pain with eye movements, movement restriction/diplopia,
vision changes) should prompt urgent ophthalmology
referral.
Conclusions
As the number of patients treated with checkpoint inhibi-
tors grows, and the volume of real-world data increases,
the etiology and characterization of immunotherapy-
related toxicities will become clearer, and management
more targeted and effective. Since adverse events may
occur late, even after terminating active treatment, and
there is a potential for long-term chronic complications,
constant vigilance and early recognition and treatment of
immune-related adverse events is important. Until
prospective clinical data are available, the consensus
recommendations provided here, on the diagnosis and
management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related ad-
verse events, will hopefully serve as a starting point to
help clinicians provide timely and effective management
of immune-related toxicities in their patients with cancer.
