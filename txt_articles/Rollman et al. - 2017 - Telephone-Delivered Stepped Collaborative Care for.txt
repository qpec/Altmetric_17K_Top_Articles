BACKGROUND: Collaborative care for depression is more
effective in improving treatment outcomes than primary
care physicians’ (PCPs) usual care (UC). However, few
trials of collaborative care have targeted anxiety.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact and 12-month dura-
bility of a centralized, telephone-delivered, stepped collab-
orative care intervention (CC) for treating anxiety disor-
ders across a network of primary care practices.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with blinded out-
come assessments.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 329 patients aged 18–64 re-
ferred by their PCPs in response to an electronic medical
record (EMR) prompt. They include 250 highly anxious
patients randomized to either CC or to UC, and 79 mod-
erately anxious patients who were triaged to a watchful
waiting (WW) cohort and later randomized if their condi-
tions clinically deteriorated.
INTERVENTION: Twelve months of telephone-delivered
CC involving non-mental health professionals who pro-
vided patients with basic psycho-education, assessed
preferences for guideline-based pharmacotherapy, moni-
tored treatment responses, and informed PCPs of their
patients’ care preferences and progress via the EMR.
MAIN MEASURES: Mental health-related quality of life
([HRQoL]; SF-36 MCS); secondary outcomes: anxiety
(Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [SIGH-A], Panic Disorder
Severity Scale) and mood (PHQ-9).
KEY RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up, highly anxious
patients randomized to CC reported improved mental
HRQoL (effect size [ES]: 0.38 [95 % CI: 0.13–0.63]; P =
0.003), anxiety (SIGH-A ES: 0.30 [0.05–0.55]; P = 0.02),
and mood (ES: 0.45 [0.19–0.71] P = 0.001) versus UC.
These improvements were sustained for 12 months
among African-Americans (ES: 0.70–1.14) and men (ES:
0.43–0.93). Of the 79 WW patients, 29 % met severity
criteria for randomization, and regardless of treatment
assignment, WW patients reported fewer anxiety and
mood symptoms and better mental HRQoL over the full
24-month follow-up period than highly anxious patients
who were randomized at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Telephone-delivered, centralized,
stepped CC improves mental HRQoL, anxiety and mood
symptoms. These improvements were durable and partic-
ularly evident among those most anxious at baseline, and
among African-Americans and men.

ollaborative care strategies are effective for treating a
variety of mental health conditions within primary care
settings,1,2 and interest in these programs has grown with the
support for patient-centered medical homes under the Afford-
able Care Act (ACA).3 Collaborative care typically involves
non-physician care managers who use evidence-based treat-
ment protocols to proactively encourage provision of
guideline-based care, promote patients’ efforts to take a more
active role in their care, and monitor their clinical response
under the supervision of a primary care physician (PCP), with
specialty back-up as necessary.1,4 Still, overcoming logistic
challenges is critical to the efficient implementation of this
model of integrated behavioral health care at scale in routine
practice.5,6
While dozens of trials have demonstrated the effectiveness
of collaborative care for treating depression in primary care,
comparatively few have addressed anxiety, despite their sim-
ilar prevalence and adverse impact on health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) and excess health services utilization.1,7–10 We
previously completed a trial of collaborative care for patients
with panic (PD) and/or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
that utilized off-site non-behavioral health care managers who

 communicated with patients via telephone and with PCPs
through their practices’ electronic medical record (EMR) sys-
tem.7,11 Yet while we demonstrated significant 12-month im-
provements in anxiety compared to PCPs’ Busual care^ (UC),
which were similar to other collaborative care trials that uti-
lized behaviorally trained care managers who met face-to-face
with patients,9,10,12 these benefits largely accrued to the most
symptomatically anxious, and we did not monitor patients to
assess the durability of improvement. Moreover, we relied on
research assistants to screen and obtain consent from patients
in busy waiting rooms, and our trial was underpowered to
determine the effectiveness of our approach for African-
Americans.7
We designed the RELAX (REduce Limitations from AnX-
iety) trial to build upon the strengths of our initial study7,11 and
other collaborative care trials,9,10 while incorporating several
pragmatic features that have not previously been evaluated in
combination, in order to promote uptake of our intervention
into routine practice. These include (1) using EMR-generated
alerts to promote physician referrals to our study at the time of
the patient encounter; (2) actively monitoring patients with
moderate levels of anxiety for clinical deterioration before
offering care management services; (3) addressing comorbid
depressive symptoms; (4) monitoring the 12-month durability
of our intervention; and (5) powering RELAX to assess the
effectiveness of collaborative care among African-Americans.
METHODS
Study Setting
Implementing a protocol approved by the University of Pitts-
burgh institutional review board, we conducted our trial at six
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center-affiliated primary
care practices that shared a common EMR system (Epic).
They included three urban faculty practices staffed by board-
certified internists, and two suburban and one rural practice
each staffed by family practitioners.
Participants
We developed an EMR BBest Practice Alert^ (BPA) that exposed
PCPs to a reminder about our study at the time of the clinical
encounter.13 The BPA launched automatically for all patients
aged 18–64 whenever anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic, or
depression was on the electronic problem list or entered as an
encounter diagnosis. If the patient agreed to referral, the PCP
electronically Bsigned^ the BPA that forwarded the patient’s name
and telephone number to a study recruiter, who then contacted the
patient to confirm protocol eligibility.13
Physician Training
Prior to activating the BPA at each study site, we (BLR)
informed PCPs about our trial at an in-service meeting, where
we provided brief education about the diagnosis and treatment
of anxiety, and on how to refer patients to our trial. Later we
distributed pens, mugs, and email newsletters with our study
logo to PCPs to reinforce these messages and to promote
referrals.
Subject Eligibility
Study recruiters telephoned referred patients to screen for
anxiety disorders using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental
Disorders (PRIME-MD) anxiety module.14 Eligible patients
needed to meet criteria for PD and/or GAD, could not be in
active treatment with a mental health specialist (MHS), and
had to have reliable telephone access and no psychotic illness,
language or other communication barrier, or plans to leave the
practice within the year. If this was confirmed, the recruiter
administered the structured interview guide for the Hamilton
Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A)15 and the Panic Disorder
Severity Scale (PDSS)16 to determine symptom severity.
To remain protocol-eligible, patients were required to have
at least a moderately severe level of anxiety (SIGH-A score
≥14 or a PDSS score ≥7) and no alcohol dependence, as
determined by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
(AUDIT-C),17 followed by the Rapid Alcohol Problems
Screen18 for AUDIT-C scores ≥3. Afterwards, the recruiter
mailed a consent form to the patient and telephoned again to
review it and obtain the patient’s consent on a recorded line. If
consent was provided, the research assistant asked the patient
to sign and return the form, and then proceeded to administer
our baseline assessment.
Randomization Procedure
Following the baseline assessment, we randomized patients who
scored SIGH-A ≥20 or PDSS ≥14 to either our intervention or
UC control group at a 1:1 ratio in blocks of eight, according to a
computer-generated random assignment sequence prepared in
advance by our study statistician (SM) and concealed until after
the call. We assigned the remaining eligible patients to a watchful
waiting (WW) cohort. Afterwards, we informed all patients of
their treatment assignment via telephone and by letter, and noti-
fied their PCPs via an EMR message.
Usual Care
For ethical reasons,19 we informed UC patients, along with
their PCPs, of their anxiety severity. However, we provided no
treatment advice unless we detected suicidality on a follow-up
assessment.
Intervention
Over the course of the trial, we employed four non-
behaviorally trained college graduates with mental health re-
search experience to serve as our telephone care managers. We
first trained them in a basic understanding of anxiety, our
treatment algorithm, and how to use our study registry to track
246
Rollman et al.: RELAX Main Outcomes
JGIM
 patients,11 and reinforced this training in weekly case review
meetings with our study clinicians.
Following randomization, our care managers telephoned
their assigned patients to conduct a detailed mental health
assessment, provide basic psychoeducation about PD and
GAD, and assess their treatment preferences. As described
previously,11 all patients could choose any of the following:
(1) a workbook for self-managing PD20 or GAD21 (we encour-
aged those with both PD and GAD to choose the workbook for
the condition that most distressed them); (2) a trial of anxiolytic
pharmacotherapy, primarily a selective serotonin reuptake in-
hibitor, selected by patient preference and adjusted per patient
response; or (3) referral to a community MHS. In addition, our
care managers recommended such general lifestyle adjustments
as social engagement, exercise, and adequate sleep.
The care managers presented their patients to the study PCP,
psychiatrist, and psychologist-study coordinator in weekly 60-
min case review meetings. To efficiently focus these sessions, we
developed an electronic registry that could rapidly identify (1) all
newly randomized patients, (2) those whose anxiety scores
remained at a moderate level or higher, and (3) those the care
manager had not been able to contact within a specified period.
We typically recommended a trial of pharmacotherapy or a
dosage adjustment when the patient was symptomatically
anxious and interested or already using pharmacotherapy.11
In these cases, we advised the care manager to recommend a
specific medication name and dosage to the PCP and patient.
We also recommended referral to a MHS when the patient had
complex psychosocial issues (e.g., impending divorce) or
failed to recover despite three pharmacotherapy trials of ade-
quate dose and duration.
Following case review, the care manager forwarded these
treatment recommendations to the patient’s PCP via the EMR
for their consideration. The PCP was always free to reject this
advice, as they were required to prescribe and approve all
medications.
During the acute phase of treatment, the care manager
telephoned patients every other week to review workbook
assignments (e.g., read a chapter weekly and practice the
techniques imparted); monitor pharmacotherapy; administer
the PDSS, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale
(GADSS),22 or 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-
9)23 to assess treatment response; and inform the patient of
new treatment recommendations generated at our case review
sessions. Depending upon the patient’s treatment choice(s),
symptoms, and motivation, these contacts lasted 15–45 min
and continued for 2 to 4 months. Afterwards, the patient
transitioned to the Bcontinuation phase^ of care, during which
the care manager contacted him/her every 1–2 months until
the end of our 12-month intervention.
Watchful Waiting
We assigned patients who failed to meet severity criteria for
randomization at baseline (SIGH-A 14–19 or PDSS 7–13) to
our WW cohort. Because all cases of clinical deterioration
following randomization among UC patients in our previous
anxiety trial had occurred by the 4-month follow-up,7 we later
randomized all WW patients whose symptoms met our thresh-
old for randomization on either their 2- or 4-month
assessment.
Assessments
We blinded our telephone assessors to patients’ randomization
status, and used their ratings to determine the effectiveness of
our intervention. However, given the nature of our interven-
tion, neither patients nor their PCPs were blinded to the
patient’s treatment assignment. We used audiotapes, manuals,
and practice interviews to train our assessors and establish
inter-rater agreement for the SIGH-A, PDSS, and GADSS
on an annual basis, or sooner whenever there was a change
in personnel. Assessors also used a computer-assisted tele-
phone interview (CATI) system that guided them in standard-
ized administration of all study instruments. We further pro-
moted quality assurance by digitally recording assessment
contacts and conducting periodic spot-checks to confirm that
responses were rated accurately and corresponded with those
entered into our study database.
We collected information on patients’ self-reported race and
sociodemographic characteristics, and administered the SF-
3624 to determine HRQoL; the SIGH-A,15 PDSS,16 and
GADSS22 to measure anxiety; and the PHQ-923 to assess
mood symptoms at baseline and at 2-, 4-, 8-, and 12-month
conclusion of our intervention on all subjects, and at 18 and 24
months on those enrolled in the first 2 years of our 3-year
recruitment phase. Lastly, we abstracted each patient’s elec-
tronic medical record to collect information on their comorbid
medical conditions and health services utilization, and our care
managers’ electronic registry to document the number of
intervention contacts and other process measures of care.
Data and Safety Monitoring
We programmed our data management system to identify
those whose blinded SIGH-A or PDSS score increased
≥25 % above their baseline. If indicated following a review,
we wrote to the treating PCP and offered to provide the names
of local MHSs and additional treatment advice. Whenever our
care managers or blinded assessors encountered suicidality,
either spontaneously expressed or on routine administration of
the PHQ-9, our CATI system automatically launched our
suicide risk management protocol that provided triage advice
(e.g., contact the study psychiatrist).25 An independent data
and safety monitoring board appointed by our funding agency
also monitored the progress and safety of our trial.
Statistical Analyses

 measure, at 12-month follow-up. For a 2 (race) × 2 (gender) ×
time (baseline and 12-month) ANOV
A with a continuous mea-
sure outcome and assuming a two-tailed α = 0.05 and 15 % 12-
month attrition rate, we needed to randomize 48 African-
Americans to have 86 % power to detect a Cohen’s d effect size
(ES) of 0.50 or larger on the SF-36 MCS. We assumed minority
patients would constitute 25 % of our randomized study cohort,
and African-Americans would constitute 80 % of all minority
patients (20 % overall). Therefore, we estimated we needed to
randomize 240 highly anxious patients to randomize 48 African-
Americans (SIGH-A ≥20 or PDSS ≥14). Based on our earlier
anxiety trial,7 we assumed two-thirds of all enrolled patients
would meet severity criteria for randomization. Thus we estimat-
ed we needed to enroll 360 subjects.
We compared baseline sociodemographic, clinical, and
functional status measures by baseline anxiety severity and
randomization status using t tests for continuous data and chi-
square analyses for categorical data. All reported P values are
two-tailed, with significance levels for all tests at P ≤ 0.05.
Using established criteria,9,26 we defined a 40 % reduction
from the baseline level of anxiety as a significant treatment
response. We examined the impact of the intervention on our
continuous measures for HRQoL, anxiety, and depression using
repeated measures mixed-effect models to account for between-
subject variations and to permit inclusion of patients with one or
more missing follow-up assessments,27 and calculated standard
intent-to-treat ES differences between intervention and usual care
groups of highly anxious patients at 12-month follow-up with
95 % confidence intervals (CI). In these models, we considered
intercept and time as random effects, and group and group × time
interaction as fixed effects. We then repeated these analyses on
patients who completed their 24-month assessment in order to
examine the durability of our intervention.
Given the sensitivity of the PDSS, GADSS, and PHQ-9 for
panic, generalized anxiety, and mood symptoms, respectively,
we conducted secondary analyses involving participants who
met DSM-IV criteria for PD, GAD, or depression on their
baseline PRIME-MD. Finally, we used Wilcoxon non-
parametric rank-sum tests to examine differences in health
services utilization among treatment conditions, given the
non-normal underlying distribution of our data. All analyses
were performed with the SAS statistical program using the
PROC MIXED function for calculation of ES changes and
scores (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient Recruitment and Follow-Up
Over a 36-month period (01/2005–12/2007), PCPs referred 1338
patients to our trial in response to the EMR prompt, and 329
met all eligibility criteria and provided informed consent to enroll.
Following their baseline assessment, 250 (76 %) met severity
criteria for randomization (Bhigh anxiety^), and we assigned the
other 79 to our WW cohort (Bmoderate anxiety^) (Fig. 1).
Baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of
our highly anxious patients were similar by randomization
status. However, compared to WW patients, those who were
highly anxious were more likely to be female, unemployed,
and unmarried, with lower levels of education, social support,
and HRQoL, and higher levels of mood and anxiety symptoms
(Table 1). Twenty-three WW patients later experienced clini-
cal deterioration and met the severity criteria for randomiza-
tion. They were more likely to be African-American, have
lower levels of education, and score higher on their baseline
SIGH-A than WW patients whose conditions did not deterio-
rate (Table 2).
12-Month Effectiveness of Collaborative Care
Intent-to-treat analyses involving the 250 highly anxious pa-
tients randomized at baseline demonstrated small to medium
ES improvements for intervention patients versus UC on our
primary outcome measure, the SF-36 MCS (ES: 0.38; 95 %
CI: 0.13–0.63), and all secondary measures of anxiety and
mood (Table 3). The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve
one additional ≥40 % decline in symptoms ranged from 3 to 5,
depending on the measure (Table 4). Pre-planned subgroup
analyses involving African-Americans and men showed sim-
ilar ES improvements and NNTs (Table 3). Finally, we ob-
served no differences in symptom improvements among the
23 WW patients with clinical deterioration by randomization
status (Fig. 1), and adding these patients to those randomized
at baseline did not change our findings (not shown).
Intervention Durability
Twelve months following the conclusion of our intervention,
highly anxious African-Americans and men randomized to
our intervention continued to report significant ES improve-
ments on all primary and secondary measures of anxiety and
mood (Table 3). Figure 2 portrays these trajectories over the
full 24-month course of follow-up and illustrates that patients
assigned to WW at baseline continually reported improved
mental HRQoL and lower levels of anxiety than those ran-
domized at baseline.
Care Processes Following Randomization
Care managers had a median of 14 telephone contacts with
intervention patients over the 12-month intervention (range:
0-32), and compared to UC, intervention patients were
more likely to be using anxiolytic pharmacotherapy (97 %
vs. 85 %; P = 0.002) and less likely to go to the emergency
room two or more times over the first 12 months following
enrollment (8 % vs. 2 %; P = 0.05). However, the number
of visits to PCPs, MHSs, or hospitalizations by randomiza-
tion status was similar (Table 1). Finally, the number of
visits to PCPs, MHSs, and ERs, and the use of pharmaco-
therapy within our high anxiety intervention cohorts were
similar by race and gender (Table 2).

 DISCUSSION
The RELAX trial confirms that a centralized, telephone-delivered
collaborative care strategy provided by non-mental health pro-
fessionals is more effective than PCPs’ usual care at reducing
anxiety and improving HRQoL among highly anxious patients
referred by their PCP for treatment. It also extends our under-
standing of the effectiveness and durability of collaborative care
among African-Americans and those with comorbid depression.
Furthermore, RELAX promotes the implementation of collabo-
rative care into routine practice by demonstrating the effective-
ness and efficiency of (1) EMR-generated alerts at identifying
and then facilitating PCP referrals of distressed patients for further
evaluation; and (2) focusing care managers’ efforts on patients
who are most likely to benefit from their attention.
RELAX corroborates the primary findings from our earlier
trial that relied on hired research assistants to screen patients

 for study eligibility in practice waiting rooms (12-month SF-
12 MCS ES: 0.38).7 Moreover, perhaps because of our recruit-
ment of a larger and more symptomatic study cohort and our
use of the more sensitive GADSS for assessing generalized
anxiety symptoms than SIGH-A,22 we are now able to dem-
onstrate the effectiveness of our intervention for GAD. Yet,
perhaps most important to improving the efficiency, cost-
effectiveness, and subsequent adoption of our treatment strat-
egy into routine practice, our findings confirm post hoc anal-
yses from our previous trial, which suggested that patients
with just moderately elevated levels of anxiety tend to improve
regardless of active care management.6
The ES improvements we obtained were similar to those
described in a meta-analysis of collaborative care that involved
813 anxious primary care patients (ES: 0.33; 0.19–0.47)1, as well
as the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM)
study by Roy-Byrne et al., the largest trial of collaborative care
for anxiety.8 CALM randomized 1004 patients with PD, GAD,
social anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder to either their
PCPs’ usual care or an intervention that included anxiolytic
pharmacotherapy, a computer-assisted program to optimize
delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy,28 and both face-to-face
and telephone contact from a study care manager. At 18-month
follow-up, intervention patients reported ES improvements in
HRQoL (SF-12 MCS: 0.39) and mood (PHQ-8: 0.24)8 similar
to those in RELAX. However, neither CALM nor previous
collaborative care trials for anxiety9,10 have utilized an EMR
prompt to promote referrals, incorporated a WW cohort, sepa-
rately reported the impact of their treatment strategy on African-
Americans, specifically addressed the challenge of comorbid
depression, or assessed study subjects for a full year following
their intervention.
Our use of automated EMR-generated alerts to facilitate
identification of anxious patients enabled us to enroll study
patients from multiple practice locations simultaneously, and
without burdening busy clinical staff or deploying research
assistants in practice waiting rooms.7,29 Furthermore, it en-
abled us to exceed our randomization target within our trial’s
scheduled 3-year recruitment phase (114 %; 273/240). How-
ever, since PCPs may fail to recognize and enter the anxiety
disorder on the electronic problem list, we also programmed
our BPA to fire when depression was entered into the EMR.

 Perhaps as a result, we enrolled a larger proportion of subjects
with major depression (85 %; 279/329) than expected, given
the approximately 50 % comorbidity between mood and anx-
iety disorders.30 Still, given our focus on anxiety, we required
all study patients to meet criteria for PD and/or GAD on the
PRIME-MD and to express at least a moderate level of anxiety
symptoms. Given the widespread adoption of EMR systems
into large practice networks,31 these alerts have important
implications for (1) implementing evidence-based recommen-
dations for screening primary care32 and specialty popula-
tions33 for common mental health conditions, and (2) increas-
ing participation of minorities and other groups traditionally
underrepresented in clinical research.34–36
Although our care managers frequently discussed the use of
our anxiety workbooks with patients during calls, fewer than
one in five patients self-reported completing them, despite
multiple exhortations from our care managers, particularly
when the patient remained symptomatic (Table 1). Moreover,
we have no information on whether those who claimed to have
read it actually did so. Although the overall ES improvements
in anxiety and mood symptoms in RELAX are typical for
collaborative care,1 they are smaller than those generated by
experienced mental health professionals meeting face-to-face
with clients (ES: 0.57; 0.29–0.84).37 More recently, Internet-
delivered computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT)
provided under the direction of a Bclinical helper^ has been
shown to be as effective as in-person CBT (ES: 0.88
1.08).38,39 Thus, replacing patient workbooks with proven
effective CCBT programs could potentially enable a more
effective and standardized version of collaborative care to be
provided at scale.
Limitations
First, we did not systematically screen patients for a mental
health disorder. Thus our reliance on EMR-generated alerts to
identify patients for treatment is limited to settings with sys-
tems capable of generating these alerts and to clinician recog-
nition and entry of the proper diagnostic (or medication) codes
into the EMR. Second, a large proportion of patients failed to
complete the workbook, which may have limited the effec-
tiveness of our intervention. Third, we lacked claims to con-
firm patients’ use of services or to calculate any potential cost
offset. However, we estimate that they are similar to CALM’s
modest $245 additional cost over an 18-month period ($4.30/

 AFD)40 and to the $460 cost to provide a nurse-led, telephone-
delivered, centralized collaborative care intervention for
treating depression following coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.41 Finally, since RELAX was not cluster-
randomized, PCPs cared for patients in both treatment arms.
While this could have produced a spillover effect that dimin-
ished outcome differences between treatment arms, we ob-
served ES improvements similar to those in the cluster-
randomized CALM31 and other trials.1
In summary, a telephone-delivered, centralized collabora-
tive care intervention provided by non-mental health profes-
sionals to highly anxious patients referred by their PCP in
response to an EMR-generated prompt led to significantly
improved mental HRQoL, anxiety, and mood symptoms com-
pared to PCPs’ usual care. These improvements were durable
for up to 12 months, and were particularly evident among
African-Americans. Future collaborative care trials should
evaluate the effectiveness of replacing self-management work-
books with Internet-delivered CCBT programs that have the
potential to deliver more effective behavioral health treatment
at scale.
