Abstract: Before 2007, Zika virus (ZIKV) was generally considered as an arbovirus of low 
clinical relevance, causing a mild self-limiting febrile illness in tropical Africa and Southeast 
Asia. Currently, a large, ongoing outbreak of ZIKV that started in Brazil in 2015 is spreading 
across the Americas. Virus infection during pregnancy has been potentially linked to congenital 
malformations, including microcephaly. In addition to congenital malformations, a temporal 
association between ZIKV infection and an increase in cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome is 
currently being observed in several countries. The mechanisms underlying these neurological 
complications are still unknown. Emerging evidence, mainly from in vitro studies, suggests that 
ZIKV may have direct effects on neuronal cells. The aim of this study was to critically review 
the literature available regarding the neurobiology of ZIKV and its potential neuropsychiatric 
manifestations.
Keywords: Zika virus, microcephaly, Guillain–Barré syndrome, neurodevelopmental 
disorders
Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted by Aedes spp. 
In recent years, outbreaks of ZIKV infection have occurred, and the infection has been 
linked to severe neurological complications, including microcephaly and Guillain–
Barré syndrome (GBS).
In this article, we first briefly review the biology and epidemiology of ZIKV and then 
critically address the literature available regarding the neurobiology of ZIKV and its 
potential neuropsychiatric manifestations.
Virology of ZIKV
ZIKV is a positive single-strand enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family 
Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus. ZIKV genome includes two noncoding regions and 
one region encoding a polyprotein that is cleaved into capsid, membrane precursor, 
and envelope, and also seven nonstructural proteins.1,2 Based on the phylogenetic tree 
reported by Weaver et al,3 ZIKV differs from other Flavivirus by 20% nucleotide 
sequence divergence.
The prototype ZIKV MR 766 was first identified in Africa.4–7 In Asia, Lanciotti et al8 
described a coding region of ZIKV 2007 EC and the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) 
gene, corresponding to a Flavivirus sequence, showing a high homology of the Asian 
strain with the virus originally identified in Africa. Accordingly, it has been proposed 
that the Asian cluster was phylogenetically derived from the African ZIKV strain.2,8,9 
The first cases of ZIKV infection reported in Brazil were from a strain genetically 
related to the Asian lineage.10–12 The introduction of ZIKV in Brazil probably occurred 
in 2014 due to the arrival of foreign tourists and athletes during the Soccer World

Cup and/or other sport events.11,12 Giovanetti et al13 described 
the complete genome of ZIKV isolated in Brazil, confirm-
ing that this cluster is similar to the virus isolated in French 
Polynesia.13,14
Early studies and epidemiology 
of ZIKV
The denomination Zika came from a forested area in Uganda, 
where ZIKV was first identified in rhesus monkeys during 
a research about yellow fever cycle and other arboviruses.5 
The virus was also identified in mosquitoes.4,6,7 Later, 
Boorman and Poeterfield15 proved the transmission from 
laboratory-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to rhesus 
monkeys. Simpson16 reported the first proved case of vector 
transmission and human disease.
Dick6 inoculated ZIKV in mice and detected virus replica-
tion in the brain. Some mice exhibited motor weakness and 
paralysis, and susceptibility to infection appeared to decrease 
with age. Therefore, ZIKV was considered neurotropic since 
its original description.
The first evidence of human infection based on the iden-
tification of antibodies against ZIKV came from patients 
in Uganda and nearby areas.6 Later, Macnamara17 reported 
the isolation of ZIKV in one patient and the rise of anti-
body serum titles in two patients during an investigation of 
jaundice in Nigeria.
Sporadic cases of ZIKV infection had been reported in 
Africa and Asia until 2007, when an outbreak occurred in Yap 
State, Federated States of Micronesia.8,18 Lanciotti et al8 iden-
tified several cases of ZIKV infection by using serological and 
molecular analysis during this outbreak. Duffy et al18 investi-
gated suspected cases of ZIKV presenting macular or papular 
rash, arthritis or arthralgia, and non-purulent conjunctivitis. 
From 185 suspected cases, 49 (26%) cases were confirmed 
by positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) for ZIKV. In addition, 414 (74%) of 557 investi-
gated subjects had IgM anti-ZIKV in blood samples, but only 
156 of those reported clinical symptomatic illness.18
More recently, in October 2013, a “mild dengue-like 
illness” was described in French Polynesia.19,20 Approxi-
mately 19,000 suspected cases were estimated, but ZIKV 
infection was confirmed in only 294 (49.5%) of 584 patients 
submitted to serological tests.19 Subsequently, the virus 
spread to other countries, and several cases were described 
throughout the world, including Japan, Australia, Europe, 
and Latin America.12,21
The first autochthonous cases in Brazil were published 
in June 2015 that referred to patients who acquired the 
infection by March 2015.10 These patients exhibited fever, 
rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia with negative molecular 
and serological examinations for dengue and chikungunya 
viruses. ZIKV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR.10 
A case of ZIKV infection acquired in March 2015 by an 
Italian traveler returning from Brazil was also reported in 
June 2015.22 In the first semester of 2015, health services in 
two states of the northeast of Brazil (Pernambuco and Bahia) 
reported a significant rise in the frequency of patients with 
mild fever, maculopapular rashes, headaches, non-purulent 
conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and myalgia. Serological tests 
for dengue and chikungunya viruses were negative, and 
ZIKV was detected by RT-PCR.11,23 Another outbreak was 
described in the southeast region, in Rio de Janeiro, with the 
identification of 364 suspected cases.24 Among 262 cases 
tested for ZIKV infection, 119 (71.9%) had ZIKV RNA 
in serum collected during the acute phase of the disease.24 
Subsequently, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported that 
autochthonous transmission of ZIKV occurred in 18 states 
of the country from April to November 2015.25
In April 2016, a total of 91,387 cases of ZIKV infection 
had been reported in all Brazilian states, with an incidence 
of 44.7/100,000 inhabitants.26 Simultaneous infections of 
ZIKV and dengue virus were also described.27
From Brazil, ZIKV spread to other Latin American 
countries due to the large availability of the vector A. aegypti. 
Even in temperate regions with limited presence of the vector, 
there is great concern with possible autochthonous cases, 
especially through sexual transmission.28,29
Infection during pregnancy and 
vertical transmission of ZIKV
The first evidence of perinatal transmission of ZIKV was 
confirmed in two cases during the largest outbreak in French 
Polynesia.30 Both mothers presented cutaneous rash after 
delivery. One of the newborns presented a transient skin 
rash occurring 3 hours after phototherapy. Both mothers 
and newborns were serum positive by RT-PCR, and vertical 
transmission possibly occurred by transplacental route or 
during delivery.30
In October 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health issued 
an official communicate stating that 26 cases of neonatal 
microcephaly were notified from public and private services 
in Pernambuco state.31
Microcephaly is a neurological syndrome that can be 
associated with other malformations and is closely related to 
the development of the central nervous system (CNS).32 Its 
definition and clinical relevance vary among authors.33–35 For

instance, cutoff points of head circumference measures 2 
or 3 standard deviation (SD) (from the mean expected val-
ues for age and sex) have been adopted. Children with head 
circumference 3 SD are considered as having severe micro-
cephaly, and they are more likely to have other structural 
abnormalities, more severe developmental impairment, and 
cognitive and behavioral problems than those with milder 
microcephaly.34,35
Until November 17, 2015, 399 suspected cases of 
microcephaly were identified in seven states of the northeast 
of Brazil. The majority of cases were concentrated in 
Pernambuco. From that moment onward, the Brazilian 
Ministry of Health recommended that all cases of micro-
cephaly should be immediately reported.36 This event was 
reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) and clas-
sified as a potential public health emergency.37
It is worth mentioning that, until December 2015, the 
official parameter adopted for microcephaly definition in 
Brazil considered the cephalic perimeter 33 cm for term 
newborns.38 From that point until March 2016, the parameter 
adopted for microcephaly notification was changed to a 
cephalic perimeter 32 cm for term newborns of both 
sexes.38 This criterion change was proposed to increase the 
specificity of the test.39
In parallel to those official reports, confirmed cases 
of ZIKV infection in fetus and newborns have been 
published.40–42 The first reports identified virus genome in 
the amniotic fluid of two pregnant women whose fetuses 
had microcephaly,41,42 and in samples collected from a 
deceased neonate with 19 cm head circumference and 
severe hydrops who died just after birth.40 Calvet et al41 
and Oliveira Melo et al42 described two cases in which 
amniotic fluid was collected from two pregnant Brazilian 
women who developed symptoms compatible with ZIKV 
infection at 10 and 18 weeks of gestation and whose fetuses 
had microcephaly. Ultrasound (US)-guided transabdominal 
amniocentesis was performed at 28 weeks of gestation, and 
ZIKV genome was identified in the amniotic fluid of both 
pregnant women, but not in their urine or serum. Fetal US 
at 25–27 weeks of gestation revealed severe CNS abnor-
malities, including microcephaly, asymmetric hemispheres, 
ventriculomegaly, hypoplastic cerebellum, and hypoplasia/
absence of the cerebellar vermis. Calcification areas were 
seen in later examinations. One infant was born at 40 weeks 
of gestation with a head circumference of 30 cm, while 
the other newborn presented severe ventriculomegaly, 
microphthalmia, cataract, and severe arthrogryposis in 
legs and arms.41,42
Due to the temporal coincidence of these events, a pos-
sible association of microcephaly and ZIKV infection was 
hypothesized by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.40,43 Since 
then, a special task force was established to investigate the 
association between microcephaly and ZIKV infection during 
pregnancy. Notification of all cases of microcephaly became 
mandatory and in any case of pregnant women with suspected 
ZIKV infection pregnancy outcome must be monitored.
On December 1, 2015, given the increase in congenital 
abnormalities, GBS, and other neurological manifestations 
possibly related to ZIKV, the WHO released an epidemiologic 
alert with recommendations, including surveillance, case 
definition, diagnosis, vector control, and prevention mea-
sures for public health proceedings.37 On January 22, 2016, 
 
a report including the participation of the Brazilian Medical 
Genetics Society–Zika Embryopathy Task Force was posted 
in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.44 In this report, 
Schuler-Faccini et al44 described 35 infants with micro-
cephaly that had been born from August to October 2015 in 
eight among 26 states of Brazil. Four (11%) infants had low 
birth weight, while arthrogryposis, talipes, microphthalmia 
abnormalities in fundoscopic examination were also reported. 
All mothers had lived in and/or visited ZIKV-affected areas 
during pregnancy, and 74% presented a skin rash during the 
first (n=21) or second (n=5) trimesters of pregnancy. Tests 
for other congenital infections were negative. Results of 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis were not available. Computed 
tomography (CT) scans and transfontanellar cranial USs 
identified brain calcifications (periventricular, parenchymal, 
thalamic, and in the basal ganglia areas), lissencephaly, 
pachygyria, and ventricular enlargement.44
Other studies reported ZIKV infection during pregnancy 
with confirmation of the virus by RT-PCR in both mother 
and fetus samples. On February 10, 2016, in Slovenia, 
Mlakar et al45 described a 25-year-old woman who previ-
ously lived in the northeast of Brazil and exhibited, during 
the 13th week of gestation, a generalized maculopapular 
rash, high fever, severe musculoskeletal, and retro-ocular 
pain and itching, parallel to ZIKV epidemic in that com-
munity. The ultrasonography, at 29 weeks of gestation, 
identified intrauterine growth retardation (fetal weight at 
third percentile), microcephaly, moderate ventriculomegaly, 
and numerous calcifications in the placenta. Pregnancy 
was terminated at 32 weeks and fetal autopsy confirmed 
microcephaly, almost complete agyria, hydrocephalus, and 
multifocal dystrophic calcifications in the cortex and in the 
subcortical white matter.45 Simultaneously, another two cases

of fetal loses and two cases of early neonatal deaths were 
described by Martines et al.46 All four mothers presented 
rash during the first trimester of pregnancy, but they were 
not tested for ZIKV. The two newborns died within 20 hours 
of life, and the histopathologic evaluation of brain showed 
parenchymal calcification, microglial nodules, gliosis, cell 
degeneration, and necrosis. Brain tissues were positive for 
ZIKV in RT-PCR. Tissues of the two miscarriages were 
also positive for ZIKV in RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry 
also detected ZIKV antigen in tissues of two among four 
cases. Investigation for all other infectious agents related 
to vertical transmission was negative.46 On February 25, 
2016, Sarno et al47 reported a case of fetal death at 32 weeks 
of pregnancy, without a clear previous history of ZIKV 
infection. Obstetric ultrasonography showed microcephaly, 
hydranencephaly, intracranial calcifications, and destructive 
lesions of posterior fossa. Pregnancy interruption occurred at 
the 32nd week, and RT-PCR was positive for ZIKV in cere-
bral, cortex, and medulla, and in amniotic fluid.47 In March 
2016, Driggers et al48 published a case of a 33-year-old North 
American woman who had been in Mexico, Guatemala, and 
Belize with her husband on holidays. This woman developed 
fever, myalgia, ocular pain, and a skin rash in her eleventh 
week of gestation. Serologic analyses were positive for IgG 
antibodies and negative for IgM antibodies against dengue 
virus, and positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies against 
ZIKV, and the virus was also detected by RT-PCR assay at 
16 and 21 weeks of gestation. Diffuse atrophy of the cerebral 
mantle, especially in the frontal and parietal lobes, and of 
“corpus callosum” was identified at the 20th week by mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), and fetal head circumference 
decreased in sequential US images from the 47th to 24th 
percentile between 16 and 20 weeks of gestation. On post-
mortem analysis, the highest viral loads were found in fetal 
brain, but ZIKV was also identified in placenta, umbilical 
cord, and other fetal tissues, including muscle, liver, lung, 
and spleen.48 In March 2016, the CDC also published a ret-
rospective analysis of cases from the period of August 2015 
to February 2016.49 A total of 257 women were evaluated 
and 97% tested negative for recent ZIKV infection. Among 
the nine cases with confirmed ZIKV infection (RT-PCR, 
immunohistochemistry, and/or serologic tests in amniotic 
fluid, placenta, or serum), six pregnant women reported 
symptoms during the first trimester: two early pregnancy 
losses occurred, two pregnancies were electively terminated, 
one infant with microcephaly was born alive, and one preg-
nancy was still continuing when the article was published. In 
three women whose symptoms occurred during the second 
and third trimesters, no abnormalities were identified in the 
newborns.49
A cohort study from Rio de Janeiro/Brazil enrolled 
88 pregnant women (from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation) who 
had started with cutaneous rash within the 5 days prior the 
study recruitment.46 ZIKV infection was identified by real-
time RT-PCR in 72 (82%) of them in blood and/or urine 
samples. US was performed in 42 women with positive 
ZIKV infection, and fetal abnormalities (in utero growth 
restriction with or without microcephaly, ventricular cal-
cifications, abnormal amniotic fluid volume, or altered 
cerebral or umbilical artery flow) were detected in 29% 
of them. Two fetal deaths occurred at 36 and 38 weeks of 
gestation.50
In April 2016, three studies described image changes in 
Brazilian cases of microcephaly.51–53 A study from Recife, the 
capital of the state of Pernambuco/Brazil, evaluated 23 infants 
with congenital microcephaly and epidemiology suggestive 
of congenital ZIKV infection.51 ZIKV IgM antibodies were 
detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of seven infants. Other 
infections were excluded by serological analysis. Brain CT 
showed intracranial calcifications in all cases, mainly in fron-
tal and parietal lobes and at the corticomedullary junction, 
basal ganglia, and thalamus. Ventriculomegaly (severe in 
53%) and global hypogyration of the cerebral cortex were 
also found in all infants. Cerebellar hypoplasia and abnor-
mal hypodensity of the white matter were also described.51 
In another study from Pernambuco, neuroradiological 
examinations of children with a diagnosis of microcephaly, 
who were born during the ZIKV outbreak in 2015/2016, 
were retrospectively evaluated.52 After the exclusion of other 
known causes of microcephaly, the final sample with suspect 
ZIKV infection comprised 23 infants. In six cases, cerebro-
spinal fluid was analyzed and IgM antibodies against ZIKV 
were positive. In the remaining 17 infants, the diagnosis was 
suspected, but without laboratory confirmation. Descriptions 
of the radiological abnormalities identified in CTs included 
decreased brain volume, ventriculomegaly, and cerebral 
calcifications (in cortical and subcortical junctions, basal 
ganglia, and periventricular areas). Simplified gyral pattern, 
hypogenesis/hypoplasia of corpus callosum, and delayed 
myelination were also described in MRI examinations.52 
Cavalheiro et al53 evaluated 13 term newborns with micro-
cephaly, whose mothers presented cutaneous rash within the 
first 4 months of pregnancy. Other infectious agents were 
excluded. In all of them, decreased cerebral mantle, increased 
subarachnoid space and ventriculomegaly, lissencephaly, 
and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum were observed in

Zika virus challenges
brain CT and/or MRI. Only one case exhibited periventricular 
calcifications, whereas, in others, calcifications were mostly 
localized in the subcortical/cortical transition area and in the 
basal ganglia.53 In May 2016, another case report from Rio 
de Janeiro described a 27-year-old woman, within the 12th 
week of gestation exhibiting symptoms of fever, maculo-
papular rash, and arthralgia.54 Serology testing for congenital 
infections and dengue and chikungunya virus was negative. 
Normal fetal anatomy was seen in US examinations at 12 and 
21 weeks of gestation, but microcephaly was suspected 
at the 32-week scan. Microcephaly was confirmed at the 
37-week scan along with diffuse brain calcifications. Fetal 
MRI additionally revealed reduced gyration and asymmetric 
colpocephaly. Neonatal head circumference was 29.0 cm, and 
transfontanellar US examination identified subcortical and 
periventricular calcifications with ventricular dilatation. Post-
natal CT also revealed brain calcifications, cortical atrophy, 
small anterior fontanel, and premature closure of coronal and 
metopic sutures.54 Up to May 7, 2016, the Brazilian Ministry 
of Health reported 7,438 suspected cases of microcephaly, 
among which 2,679 cases were excluded and 3,433 were still 
under investigation. A total of 1,326 cases of microcephaly 
were confirmed, but only 205 of them had laboratorial con-
firmation of ZIKV infection.55
Studies also retrospectively evaluated the frequency 
of fetal abnormalities possibly due to ZIKV outbreak in 
French Polynesia that affected ∼66% of the population.56,57 
In the 23-month period included in the study, eight cases 
of microcephaly were identified, of which five resulted in 
termination of pregnancy by medical abortion.56 This study 
estimated the risk of microcephaly after ZIKV infection in 
pregnancy in 0.95%, and the first trimester seems to be the 
period at highest risk.56 It is worth mentioning that, based 
on the analysis of Brazilian data, Johansson et al57 proposed 
the risk of microcephaly ranging from 0.88% to 13.2% of 
ZIKV infection occurring in the first trimester of pregnancy, 
depending on the overall infection rate estimates. The lower 
end of this range was similar to the ∼1% risk estimated for 
French Polynesia. Still there, a retrospective evaluation of 
19 cases of congenital cerebral malformations, including 
five cases of microcephaly, described positive identifica-
tion of ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR in four of them.58 Another 
study reviewed the occurrence of fetal abnormalities in 
4,285 births in the Polynesia Hospital Center.59 Twelve 
cases of malformations were identified, and among them 
three cases of fetuses with severe CNS abnormalities and 
positive PCR for ZIKV in the amniotic fluid. Calcifications 
and ventriculomegaly were observed in all cases in fetal US. 
Microcephaly, low cerebellar biometry, occipital subependy-
mal pseudocysts, polymicrogyria with laminar necrosis and 
opercular dysplasia, absent/or hypoplastic corpus callosum, 
and hypoplastic brainstem were detected through MRI.59
The studies describing radiological abnormalities of the 
CNS in fetuses and neonates with presumed congenital ZIKV 
infection are summarized in Table 1.
Ocular abnormalities in neonates possibly associated 
with ZIKV infection have also been reported. In a sample of 
29 infants, from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, with microcephaly 
and a presumed diagnosis of congenital ZIKV infection, ocu-
lar abnormalities were found in ten children (34.5%), and, in 
seven, the alterations were bilateral. The authors described 
focal pigment mottling of the retina and chorioretinal atrophy, 
optic nerve abnormalities, bilateral iris coloboma, and lens 
subluxation. From this sample, 23 mothers reported symp-
toms compatible with ZIKV infection during pregnancy, of 
which 18 occurred in the first trimester, four in the second 
trimester, and one in the third trimester.60 A study from 
Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, showed ten infants with simi-
lar ocular abnormalities, including gross pigment mottling 
and/or chorioretinal atrophy and optic nerve abnormalities. 
Seven mothers (70%) referred symptoms during pregnancy, 
six of them in the first trimester.61 Unfortunately, the diag-
nosis of ZIKV infection was based on the clinical symptoms 
of the mother during pregnancy, and also the exclusion of 
other infections such as syphilis, HIV, toxoplasmosis, cyto-
megalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and rubella.
Controversies on causal association 
between ZIKV infection and 
microcephaly
The absence of a unified definition of microcephaly has 
had important epidemiological consequences. Since March 
2016, the official criteria used to diagnose microcephaly in 
Brazil have been based on the WHO recommendations:61,62 
1) for term babies, international parameters of the WHO 
should be used and 2) for preterm newborns, the intergrowth 
parameters should be used. Initially, the definition of cases 
of microcephaly in the surveillance system included all full-
term infants with a head circumference 33 cm, and later the 
inclusion criteria were modified to 32 cm.63 However, the 
National Live Birth Information System adopted a  
definition of 
microcephaly when head circumference measure was 3 SD 
from the mean expected for age and sex.64,65 Therefore, varia-
tions in the number of suspected cases may have occurred 
according to the definitions adopted and may have resulted in 
lower diagnostic specificity, leading to possible  
overestimation

Zika virus challenges
of affected infants.39,65 Furthermore, the real incidence of 
microcephaly in Brazil, prior to the occurrence of ZIKV 
infectious, was possibly underestimated, especially in the 
northeast region, and the obligatory notification of cases may 
falsely inflate the real incidence.39,66,67 In a communicate, the 
Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malforma-
tions (ECLAMC 2015) questioned the number of reported 
cases, stating that they were much higher than the expected 
considering the incidence of ZIKV infection in the Brazilian 
population.68
Other possible etiologies of microcephaly including 
environmental, alcohol-related, infectious or genetic, 
and/or associated factors (malnutrition, coinfection with 
other agents) also must be more carefully investigated.66 
Congenital microcephaly is clearly associated with genetic 
and acquired conditions (for review, refer Nunes et al69). 
Exposure to drugs, including alcohol, maternal infection, 
and nutritional deficiency is the major cause of acquired 
congenital microcephaly. Regardless of the cause, the etio-
pathogenic factor must influence the proliferation phase of 
the CNS development, around third and fourth months of 
pregnancy, to determine microcephaly. Accordingly, ZIKV 
infection could cause microcephaly only when occurring 
in the first months of pregnancy. In this regard, convincing 
epidemiological data are missing.70 Although this relation-
ship still needs further clarification, some of the evidence 
described so far suggests the possibility of ZIKV-related 
teratogenic effects.44,71,72 In terms of public health safety mea-
sures, while prospective studies are not finalized and/or more 
robust evidence is available, precautions to control vector 
multiplication and to reduce individual exposure to the virus, 
especially in fertile and pregnant women, are recommended 
throughout the world.31,37,73 The continuous surveillance of 
suspected cases is also maintained, and a recent report from 
the WHO74 enlists eight countries that have reported cases 
of microcephaly and/or CNS malformations that were poten-
tially associated with ZIKV infection: Brazil, Cape Verde, 
Colombia, French Polynesia, Martinique, Panama, Slovenia, 
and the USA. In the last two countries, the probable place of 
infection was located in South/Central America.
Table 2 depicts arguments for and against a causal asso-
ciation between ZIKV infection and microcephaly.
Neuronal damage by ZIKV: 
evidence from experimental models 
and unanswered questions
ZIKV infection has been linked to severe neurological 
complications, that is, microcephaly and GBS. While the 
first condition involves the CNS and the second is related to 
peripheral nerves lesion. The mechanisms by which ZIKV 
can determine these two distinct syndromes are still uncer-
tain. The virus could directly affect CNS and peripheral 
neurons. Alternatively, neuronal lesion could result from 
ZIKV-elicited processes, including immune response and 
loss of glial support. So far, studies have focused on the first 
hypothesis implicating a direct effect of ZIKV on neurons.
Although suggestive, the detection of ZIKV in the brain 
of microcephalic human fetus45 does not prove either causal-
ity or pathogenic mechanism. To overcome the limitations of 
human studies, in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches 
have been pursued.
Two independent studies showed that ZIKV can infect 
neural stem cells in vitro, inducing caspase-mediated cell 
death.75,76 The most compelling evidence for a direct role 
played by ZIKV in microcephaly came from an elegant study 
using induced pluripotent stem cells cultured as neurospheres 
and brain organoids, in in vitro models of embryonic brain 
development. Garcez et al76 showed that ZIKV reduced the 
viability and growth of neural stem cells in these models, 
disrupting the formation of both structures. To control for 
unspecific effects of viral infection on neurogenesis, the 
same experiments were performed with dengue virus 2, a 
flavivirus with genetic and serological similarities to ZIKV. 
Neurospheres and brain organoids exposed to dengue virus 2 
 
did not have their growth and development altered, suggest-
ing that neurogenesis impairment is not a general feature of 
the flavivirus family.76
Until recently, only a very limited number of studies had 
been performed in rodents, indicating that ZIKV can replicate 
and damage CNS cells.77,78 Among the concerns regarding 
these older studies, there is the use of the prototype MR 
766 strain of ZIKV that had undergone multiple passages 
in suckling mouse brains, possibly changing its biological 
properties, including virulence. Alterations in molecular 
components of ZIKV overtime could also be responsible for 
its increased neuropathogenicity lately. To overcome these 
limitations, Lazear et al79 assessed four ZIKV strains (three 
strains isolated from mosquitoes in Africa and one contem-
porary clinical isolate) in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice 
and immune-deficient transgenic mice. Four- to six-week-
old WT mice inoculated with ZIKV by subcutaneous route 
did not develop any clinical sign of disease, while different 
strains of mice lacking interferon α/β (or type 1) signaling 
developed neurological signs (muscle weakness) and suc-
cumbed to the infection. Ifnar1−/− mice, which cannot respond 
to interferon α/β, were highly vulnerable to the infection

and exhibited high levels of ZIKV in all tissues evaluated, 
including blood, spleen, testes, brain, and spinal cord. 
Interestingly, ZIKV could cause disease in non-weaned WT 
mice, that is, 1-week-old, when the innate immune response 
is not yet mature, indicating an age-dependent vulnerability 
to disease.79 Besides proposing a model for therapeutic and 
pathogenesis investigation, this study confirmed a pivotal 
role played by interferon α/β in restricting ZIKV infection, 
as already described for dengue virus infection.
Rossi et al80 also suggested a significant role played by 
type I interferon in the resistance against ZIKV infection. 
Using a Cambodian isolate inoculated by intraperitoneal 
route, they found that 3-week-old 129sv mice lacking the 
interferon α/β receptor (A129) succumbed to the infection, 
while immunocompetent mice survived. An age-dependent 
vulnerability to disease was also demonstrated in this model 
with 3-week-old mice exhibiting more severe signs of infec-
tion than 5- and 11-week-old mice. ZIKV was detected in 
the brain on day 3 postinfection and caused neurological 
signs (lethargy, tremor) by day 5 postinfection, especially 
in 3-week-old A129.80 Mice lacking both interferon α/β and 
γ (or type II) receptors (AG129) infected by intraperitoneal

Due to changes in microcephaly definition, obligatory notification, and 
absence of confirmation of etiology in several cases, an overestimation 
of ZiKv-affected infants should be considered in Brazil.39,65–67 Other 
etiologies of microcephaly should also be ruled out.69
Ideally, consistent findings should be performed by two or more high-
quality epidemiologic studies, with the control of confounding factors, 
sufficient numbers, exclusion of positive and negative bias factors, 
prospective studies if possible, and relative risk higher than 6.0.
However, literature until now includes only surveys and retrospective 
or short-term cohort studies. Therefore, until a large epidemiological 
study is published, it is not possible to confirm the association 
between maternal exposure and fetal involvement

Zika virus challenges
or intradermal routes also developed a severe disease, 
dying on day 6 postinfection. Given the antiviral activity 
of interferons, these results were not surprising, being also 
corroborated by an in vitro study showing the potential of 
interferons α/β and γ in controlling ZIKV replication.81 The 
major limitation of the models proposed so far pertains to 
the fact that susceptible animals lack a key component of 
the innate immune response against viral infection. This 
certainly influences how the immune system deals with the 
ZIKV infection, affecting the evaluation of the real role 
played by immune mechanisms on disease pathogenesis. 
In fact, mechanistic insights are still missing in in vivo 
studies, particularly those related to neuronal damage. In 
addition, it is uncertain whether ZIKV promotes widespread 
or localized brain damage, and careful neuropathological 
analysis coupled with behavioral assessment is warranted in 
these and future animal models of ZIKV. The age-dependent 
vulnerability to disease must be further explored, including 
intrauterine infection at different stages of fetus develop-
ment. This latter issue is of paramount importance taking 
into consideration the controversies regarding the associa-
tion between prenatal ZIKV infection and microcephaly. 
More importantly, it is uncertain the consequences of 
ZIKV infection after this critical period on CNS develop-
ment. Theoretically, neuronal migration, organization, and 
myelination could be impaired by CNS infection, leading to 
different conditions, including major (eg, lissencephaly and 
schizencephaly) and minor (eg, focal dysplasias) brain mal-
formations, and “functional” neuropsychiatric syndromes 
including intellectual impairment and autism. Longitudi-
nal cohorts of newborns from epidemic areas, involving 
systematic assessment of neurodevelopmental milestones, 
can help answering this issue.
GBS and other autoimmune-
mediated disorders
The first link between ZIKV infection and a neurological com-
plication occurred in the ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia 
from October 2013 to March 2014.82 Cao-Lormeau et al83 
reported 42 patients with GBS during this ZIKV outbreak, 
corresponding approximately to a 20-fold increase in the 
expected number of cases of GBS for that region. GBS is an 
acute autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy characterized by 
the development of ascending motor weakness associated with 
variable degrees of cranial nerves palsy, sensory changes, and 
dysautonomia.84 The disease is self-limiting, reaching its nadir 
after 2–4 weeks of onset. Depending on its severity, it can affect 
respiratory muscles, requiring artificial ventilation support.
In the reported cases, most patients (88%) had a previ-
ous history of a short-lasting viral syndrome characterized 
by fever, rash, arthralgia, and/or conjunctivitis, and all were 
positive for ZIKV serological tests. The GBS in these patients 
differed from the typical syndrome as it was marked by a fast 
progression to a nadir (1 week) and a short plateau phase. 
Facial palsy was a common manifestation (64%), and one-
third of patients required respiratory assistance. Besides the 
combination of fast onset and fast recovery, patients lacked 
the typical demyelinating pattern of the disease, exhibit-
ing the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) type.83 
In contrast with non-ZIKV-related AMAN cases, the patients 
did not show the characteristic anti-ganglioside antibodies. 
The atypical presentation along the lack of AMAN-related 
antibodies cast doubt on the anti-glycolipid antibody role on 
disease pathogenesis.83,85 In this scenario, a direct effect of 
ZIKV can be implicated again. All patients in Cao-Lormeau 
et al’s83 series were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, 
one of the standard treatments for GBS along with plasma-
pheresis.84 It remains to be defined whether the favorable 
clinical outcome observed in this study could be achieved 
with plasmapheresis and/or lack of specific treatment. The 
latter may happen in regions with limited economic and 
health resources.
As with obstetric complications, including microcephaly, 
there are several challenges ahead. First, the epidemiological 
data must be confirmed. Preliminary reports from different 
Latin American countries seem to corroborate the association 
between ZIKV and GBS.86 This also undermines an eventual 
role played by ethnic-related factors, such as Human Leuko-
cyte Antigen alleles, in post-ZIKV GBS.78 However, direct 
and/or indirect pathogenic roles for ZIKV must be proved. 
In this regard, animal models may be helpful, but so far no 
study has evaluated peripheral nerves lesion or dysfunction 
following ZIKV. It is also tempting to speculate whether 
ZIKV can be implicated in other autoimmune neurological 
diseases, as occurred with dengue virus.87 Mécharles et al88 
reported a case of acute myelitis possibly due to ZIKV 
infection. In 2016, at the American Academy of Neurology 
Meeting, Doctor Ferreira89 reported two Brazilian patients 
with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and ZIKV infec-
tion, calling great attention to this issue. To prevent unneces-
sary alarm, sporadic reports must be confirmed by careful 
epidemiological analysis, especially taking into consider-
ation the concurrent circulation of other arboviruses, such as 
dengue. To date, there is no evidence of an increased rate of 
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or related autoimmune 
conditions in regions facing ZIKV outbreak.

Conclusion
There is a clear temporal association between the increased 
reporting of cases of microcephaly and of GBS and the ZIKV 
outbreak. However, there are several unanswered questions 
that must be investigated (Table 3). For instance, studies 
addressing the mechanisms underlying ZIKV-induced neu-
ronal damage are warranted. Reliable diagnostic criteria for 
the identification of cases of microcephaly are still required. 
In addition, ongoing longitudinal cohort studies can show 
the long-term neurological and psychiatric consequences of 
congenital and after-birth ZIKV infection. From a personal 
perspective, as neither pharmacological treatment nor vac-
cines are available, prevention of ZIKV infection relies on 
protective measures against mosquito bites.
Further studies on ZIKV infection are urgently needed 
and may help the development of therapeutic strategies 
against ZIKV and other arboviruses, such as dengue and

Table 3 Unanswered questions regarding ZiKv infection and 
neuropsychiatric complications
what are the mechanisms underlying ZiKv-induced neuronal damage?
what is the role of the immune response against ZiKv in the 
pathogenesis of neurological complications?
what are the risk and protective factors related to the development 
of neurological complications after ZiKv infection?
Are there differences in ZIKV infection during the first trimester 
of pregnancy according to maternal immune response and/or viral load?
is there any neurological and/or psychiatric consequence for the fetus 
of ZiKv infection in the second half of pregnancy?
is the ZiKv infection associated with other immune-mediated 
neurological diseases?
Abbreviation: ZiKv, Zika virus.
