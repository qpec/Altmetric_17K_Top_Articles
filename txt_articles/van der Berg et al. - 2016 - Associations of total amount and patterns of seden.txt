Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The study investigated cross-sectional asso-
ciations of total amount and patterns of sedentary behaviour
with glucose metabolism status and the metabolic syndrome.
Methods We included 2,497 participants (mean age 60.0
±8.1 years, 52% men) from The Maastricht Study who were
asked to wear an activPAL accelerometer 24 h/day for 8 con-
secutive days. We calculated the daily amount of sedentary
time, daily number of sedentary breaks and prolonged seden-
tary bouts (≥30 min), and the average duration of the seden-
tary bouts. To determine glucose metabolism status, partici-
pants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Associations
of sedentary behaviour variables with glucose metabolism
status and the metabolic syndrome were examined using mul-
tinomial logistic regression analyses.
Results Overall, 1,395 (55.9%) participants had normal glu-
cose metabolism, 388 (15.5%) had impaired glucose metabo-
lism and 714 (28.6%) had type 2 diabetes. The odds ratio per
additional hour of sedentary time was 1.22 (95% CI
1.13, 1.32) for type 2 diabetes and 1.39 (1.27, 1.53)
for the metabolic syndrome. No significant or only
weak associations were seen for the number of seden-
tary breaks, number of prolonged sedentary bouts or
average bout duration with either glucose metabolism
status or the metabolic syndrome.
Conclusions/interpretation An extra hour of sedentary time
was associated with a 22% increased odds for type 2 diabetes
and a 39% increased odds for the metabolic syndrome. The
pattern in which sedentary time was accumulated was weakly
associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome. These
results suggest that sedentary behaviour may play a significant
role in the development and prevention of type 2 diabetes, al-
though longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings.

 Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with high
prevalence and incidence worldwide [1] that, next to its
classic complications such as cardiovascular disease and
retinopathy, can cluster with other chronic diseases such
as dementia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). During the last decades several risk factors,
including genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors,
have been identified as relevant for the development
of type 2 diabetes [2, 3], but these cannot fully explain
its development. Recent research interest is therefore
focusing on the role of newly identified determinants,
such as sedentary behaviour.
Sedentary behaviour, defined as any waking behaviour
characterised by an energy expenditure≤1.5 metabolic equiv-
alents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining posture, such as
watching TV or using the computer [4], can be objectively
measured using an accelerometer. A number of accelerometry
studies have shown unfavourable associations between total
amount of sedentary time and metabolic health outcomes,
including waist circumference [5–9], cholesterol and triacyl-
glycerol levels [5, 6, 10–13], markers of insulin resistance [5,
6, 9, 10, 13, 14] and the metabolic syndrome [8, 11, 15–17].
Apart from the total amount of sedentary time, the pattern of
sedentary time, i.e. the frequency with which sedentary time is
interrupted (sedentary breaks) or the duration of uninterrupted
periods of sedentary time (sedentary bouts), seems to be rele-
vant for health outcomes. In a few studies, more sedentary
breaks have been associated with better metabolic health
[15, 18, 19].
To date, large-scale studies that have objectively
measured sedentary behaviour in a population with
type 2 diabetes have been scarce [5, 17]. However,
given the large amounts of time people spend being
sedentary and the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes,
such studies are important. These studies can provide
more insights into the associations between sedentary
behaviour and diabetes, and contribute to the develop-
ment of strategies to prevent diabetes and its compli-
cations and comorbidities. Therefore, we measured the
total amount and patterns of sedentary behaviour with
an accelerometer in a large sample of adults with type
2 diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) or nor-
mal glucose metabolism (NGM), who participated in
The Maastricht Study. We used the thigh-worn
activPAL3 accelerometer, which classifies sedentary be-
haviour using data on posture, as this has been shown
to be an accurate means of assessing sedentary behav-
iour [20, 21]. The aim of the present study was to
examine associations of total amount and patterns of
sedentary behaviour with glucose metabolism status
and the metabolic syndrome.
Methods
In this study, we used data from The Maastricht Study, an
observational, prospective, population-based cohort study.
The rationale and methods have been described previously
[22]. In brief, the study focuses on the aetiology, pathophysi-
ology, complications and comorbidities of type 2 diabetes
mellitus and is characterised by an extensive phenotyping
approach.
Eligible participants were individuals aged between 40 and
75 years and living in the southern part of the Netherlands.
Participants were recruited through mass media campaigns
and from the municipal registries and the regional Diabetes
Patient Registry via mailings. Recruitment was stratified ac-
cording to known type 2 diabetes status for reasons of effi-
ciency. This study included cross-sectional data from 3,451
participants who completed the baseline survey between
November 2010 and September 2013. After excluding partic-
ipants who did not receive an accelerometer due to logistics
(n=673), whose accelerometer measurement failed (n=136)
or who had other missing data (n=145), a total of 2,497 par-
ticipants were included in the present analyses.
The study was approved by the institutional medical ethical
committee (NL31329.068.10) and the Minister of Health,
Welfare and Sports of the Netherlands, on the basis of the
Health Council’s opinion (permit 131088-105234-PG). All
participants gave written informed consent.
Measurements
Glucose metabolism status and the metabolic syndrome To
determine glucose metabolism status, all participants (except
those who used insulin) underwent a standardised 75 g oral
glucose tolerance test after an overnight fast, as described
elsewhere [22]. Glucose metabolism was defined according
to the World Health Organization’s 2006 criteria [23], and
participants were categorised as having NGM, impaired
fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 6.1–6.9 mmol/l and
2 h plasma glucose [after glucose load]< 7.8 mmol/l), im-
paired glucose tolerance (fasting plasma glucose<7.0 mmol/l
and 2 h plasma glucose [after glucose load] ≥7.0–11.1 mmol/l),
or type 2 diabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l
or 2 h plasma glucose [after glucose load] ≥11.1 mmol/l).
Participants on diabetes medication and without type 1
diabetes were also considered to have type 2 diabetes. For this
study, we defined having either impaired fasting glucose and/
or impaired glucose tolerance as IGM.
To determine the metabolic syndrome, we measured, as
described elsewhere [22]: waist circumference, triacylglycerol
levels, HDL-cholesterol levels, fasting glucose levels, blood
pressure and medication use. The metabolic syndrome was
defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III
710
Diabetologia (2016) 59:709–718
 guidelines by the presence of three or more of: (1) waist
circumference ≥102 cm for men or ≥88 cm for women; (2)
serum triacylglycerol level ≥1.7 mmol/l; (3) HDL-cholesterol
level <1.03 mmol/l for men or <1.30 mmol/l for women; (4)
fasting glucose level ≥5.6 mmol/l or use of glucose-lowering
drug medication (insulin or oral agents); or (5) systolic blood
pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure
≥85 mmHg, and/or use of blood-pressure-lowering
medication [24].
Sedentary behaviour variables Sedentary time was mea-
sured using the activPAL3 physical activity monitor (PAL
Technologies, Glasgow, UK). The activPAL3 is a small
(53 ×35× 7 mm), lightweight (15 g) triaxial accelerometer
that records movement in the vertical, anteroposterior and
mediolateral axes, and also determines posture (sitting or ly-
ing, standing and stepping) based on acceleration information.
The device was attached directly to the skin on the front of the
right thigh with transparent 3M Tegaderm tape, after the de-
vice had been waterproofed using a nitrile sleeve. Participants
were asked to wear the accelerometer for 8 consecutive days,
without removing it at any time. To avoid inaccurately identi-
fying non-wear time, participants were asked not to replace
the device once removed. Data were uploaded using the
activPAL software and processed using customised software
written in MATLAB R2013b (MathWorks, Natick, MA,
USA). Data from the first day were excluded from the analysis
because participants performed physical function tests at the
research centre after the device was attached. In addition, data
from the final wear day providing ≤14 waking hours of data
were excluded from the analysis. Participants were included if
they provided at least 1 valid day (>14 h of waking data).
The total amount of sedentary time was based on the sed-
entary posture (sitting or lying), and calculated as the mean
time spent in a sedentary position during waking time per day.
The method used to determine waking time has been de-
scribed elsewhere [25]. In brief, an automated algorithm iden-
tified wake and bed times on an individual level on multiple
days, i.e. different wake and bed times for each day for each
participant. The algorithm is based on the number and dura-
tion of sedentary periods to identify bed times, and on the
number and duration of active periods (standing or stepping)
to identify wake times. The algorithm showed high accuracy
in determining waking time compared with self-report, as the
intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.79 (p<0.001)
and the mean difference in waking time between both
methods was 0.02 h (1.2 min), with limits of agreement of
−1.1 to 1.2 h.
The number of sedentary breaks during waking time was
determined as each transition from a sitting or lying position to
standing or stepping, and the mean number of breaks per day
was calculated. Sedentary time accumulated in a consecutive
period ≥30 min was defined as a prolonged sedentary bout,
and the mean number of prolonged sedentary bouts during
waking time per day was calculated. Average bout duration
was calculated by dividing total sedentary time by the total
number of sedentary bouts. Minutes with a step
frequency>110 steps/min were classified as higher intensity
physical activity and this variable was used as a measure for
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) [26].
Covariates Covariates that were extracted from the question-
naire included sex, age, level of education, smoking status,
alcohol consumption, mobility limitation, health status and
diabetes duration. Level of education was categorised as
low, medium or high, and smoking status as never, former or
current smoker. Alcohol consumption was categorised as non-
consumer, low consumer (≤7 alcoholic drinks per week for
women and ≤14 alcoholic drinks per week for men), and high
consumers (>7 alcoholic drinks per week for women and >14
alcoholic drinks per week for men). Information on mobility
limitation was obtained from the EuroQol-5D questionnaire
and was defined as having any difficulties with walking in the
previous week. Health status was determined by the presence
or a history of one or more of the following conditions: car-
diovascular disease, COPD, cancer or Parkinson’s disease.
Medication use was assessed during a medication interview
and was defined as the use of glucose-lowering medication,
blood-pressure-lowering medication or lipid-modifying med-
ication. Other covariates included BMI and HbA1c, which
were obtained from physical examination and laboratory as-
sessment, as described elsewhere [22], and higher intensity
physical activity.
Statistical analysis Descriptive characteristics of the study
sample were summarised as mean with SD or as numbers
and percentages. Diabetes duration was described using the
median and interquartile range. To examine differences be-
tween the groups with NGM, IGM and type 2 diabetes, we
conducted χ2, ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis tests as appropri-
ate. General linear models were used to obtain adjusted means
of the amount of sedentary time, the number of sedentary
breaks, the number of prolonged sedentary bouts and the av-
erage bout duration, and these were compared between partici-
pants with NGM, IGM and type 2 diabetes. Bonferroni-
corrected pairwise comparisons were made between the
groups. Similar analyses were conducted to compare the ad-
justed means between participants without metabolic syn-
drome criteria, those with one or two metabolic syndrome
criteria and those with the metabolic syndrome (three or more
criteria). To examine associations of the sedentary behaviour
variables with glucose metabolism status and the metabolic
syndrome, multinomial logistic regression analyses were con-
ducted. Results are reported as ORs with 95% CIs. For both
general linear models and multinomial regression analyses an
unadjusted model and three adjusted models were fitted.

 Model 1 was adjusted for sex, age, level of education and
waking time. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for smoking
status, alcohol consumption, health status and mobility limi-
tation. For glucose metabolism status, model 2 was also ad-
justed for BMI. Model 3 was additionally adjusted for higher
intensity physical activity. For the exposure variables seden-
tary breaks, prolonged sedentary bouts and sedentary bout
duration, model 3 was also adjusted for sedentary time. The
exposure variables were checked for normality, which was
reasonable. Further, we tested multi-collinearity in our
models: no variables had diverged confidence intervals or
standard errors, or an unexpected change in the regression
coefficient, and the variance-inflating factors were<2.0. All
analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0
(IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
The overall study population consisted of 2,497 participants
with an average age of 60.0±8.1 years, 52% of whom were
men. Table 1 presents descriptive characteristics in the overall
study population and according to glucose metabolism status.
A total of 1,395 (55.9%) participants had NGM, 388 (15.5%)
had IGM and 714 (28.6%) had type 2 diabetes. Participants
with type 2 diabetes were more often current smokers, were
less often consumers of high levels of alcohol, had more often
a mobility limitation and had a higher BMI compared with
participants from the IGM and NGM groups. Those with type
2 diabetes had, on average, an HbA1c of 6.9% (51.9 mmol/
mol) and a median duration of diabetes of 6 years (Q1–
Q3=3.0–12.0). Participants in all groups provided, on aver-
age, more than 6 valid days of data with an average waking
time of almost 16 h. Figure 1 shows the percentages of waking
time spent sedentary, standing and stepping on an average
day; these were statistically significantly different between
the three groups (p<0.01).
Table 2 presents the unadjusted and adjusted means of the
sedentary behaviour variables according to glucose metabo-
lism status. After adjustment for several confounders, a statis-
tically significant difference of up to 26 min (0.43 h) in sed-
entary time was seen between the three groups (model 3). The
differences in number of sedentary breaks per day were, al-
though statistically significantly in the unadjusted model and
model 1, small between the groups in all analyses. The daily
number of prolonged sedentary bouts with a duration of

 30 min or longer differed significantly between groups in the
models up to model 3. After adjustment for sedentary time and
higher intensity physical activity in model 3, the number of
prolonged sedentary bouts became similar in the three groups.
As was seen for the number of bouts, there were statistically
significant differences in average sedentary bout dura-
tion between the groups in the models up to model 3,
but after adjustment for sedentary time and higher in-
tensity physical activity, the duration became compara-
ble between the groups.
The unadjusted and adjusted means of the sedentary behav-
iour variables according to number of metabolic syndrome
criteria are presented in Table 3. In all models, a gradual in-
crease in sedentary time was seen when more metabolic syn-
drome criteria were present. The difference in sedentary time
in model 3 was 40 min (0.66 h) per day between participants
with no criteria and those with three to five criteria, and this
was statistically significantly different even after adjustment
for several confounders. In addition, the number of sedentary
breaks per day was statistically significantly different in all
models, although the difference in model 3 was only two
breaks per day. The number of prolonged sedentary bouts
did not differ between the groups after adjustment for con-
founders. The average sedentary bout duration was statistical-
ly significantly different between the groups, but the differ-
ence was less than 1 min after adjustment for relevant
confounders.

CI 1.05, 1.22) times higher odds for IGM and a 1.46 (1.36,
1.56) times higher odds for type 2 diabetes compared with
NGM (model 1). After adjustment for BMI and other covari-
ates in models 2 and 3, the associations remained statistically
significant for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13,
1.32). The number of sedentary breaks, the number of
prolonged sedentary bouts and the average sedentary
bout duration were not statistically significantly associ-
ated with glucose metabolism status after adjustment for
relevant confounders (model 3).
For the number of metabolic syndrome criteria, longer
amounts of sedentary time were, after adjustment for several
confounders, significantly associated with increased odds of
13% (95% CI 1.04, 1.24) for having one to two criteria, and
39% (1.27, 1.53) for having three to five criteria compared with
participants without any criteria. After adjustment for relevant
confounders, the analyses of the sedentary behaviour patterns
resulted in statistically significant associations of sedentary
breaks and average sedentary bout duration with three to five
metabolic syndrome criteria in only model 3 (ORbreaks 0.99,
95% CI 0.98, 1.00; ORbout duration 1.09, 95% CI 1.03, 1.15).
Additional analyses with separate adjustments for higher inten-
sity physical activity and for sedentary time showed that for the
number of prolonged sedentary bouts and average sedentary
bout duration, the adjustment for sedentary time pre-
dominantly caused the change between models 2 and 3.
Additional analyses examining the number of sedentary
breaks with a duration of at least 1 min with glucose metabo-
lism status and the metabolic syndrome showed results similar
to those for sedentary breaks of any duration; a statistically
significant association was seen for three to five metabolic
syndrome criteria in model 3 only (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96,
1.00) (data not shown).
Discussion
To our knowledge, our study is the largest in which posture-
discriminating accelerometry was used to objectively measure
total amount and patterns of sedentary behaviour in a sample

 metabolic syndrome (three to five criteria), independent of
higher intensity physical activity. The number of sedentary
breaks per day was highly comparable and not significantly
different between the participants with type 2 diabetes, those
with IGM and those with NGM. A statistically significant
difference in the number of breaks was seen between partici-
pants with the metabolic syndrome and those without the met-
abolic syndrome, but the difference was only two breaks per
day. Also, the odds ratio for the metabolic syndrome was
statistically significant but small, and therefore not clinically
relevant. Similar results were found for average sedentary
bout duration: a statistically significant difference in bout du-
ration was seen between participants with the metabolic syn-
drome and those without the metabolic syndrome, but the
difference was less than 1 min. Also, the OR for the metabolic
syndrome was statistically significant: a 1.09 times higher
odds for three to five criteria when the average sedentary bout
was longer. Last, the number of prolonged sedentary bouts did
not differ between the groups according to diabetes status or
the groups according to the metabolic syndrome, and the odds
ratios were not statistically significant.
A major strength of our study was the use of posture-based
measurement with the activPAL accelerometer, worn on the
thigh, which has been shown to be a highly accurate method
for assessing sedentary behaviour [20, 21]. Thus, our esti-
mates of the amounts of sedentary time and the determination
of sedentary breaks are more accurate than data based solely
on acceleration, which cannot discriminate between postures.
Further, we used accelerometry in a large sample of middle-
aged and older adults with type 2 diabetes and IGM, which
enabled us to examine and quantify associations of several
objectively measured sedentary behaviour variables with type
2 diabetes. Also, waterproofed attachment of the activPAL on
the thigh enabled us to collect 24 h accelerometry data, which
not only resulted in complete data assessments, but could also
have improved wear-time compliance, as demonstrated in a
recently published study in children [27]. Wear time in our
study population was, on average, 6.3 days with 15.7 h of
waking time, and 85.3% of our study population provided at
least 6 valid days of data. Another strength was adjustment for
important confounders including BMI and high-intensity
physical activity, which excludes the possibility that these
factors account for the associations of sedentary behaviour
with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The adjust-
ment for BMI predominantly caused the differences between
models 1 and 2, yet BMI could be part of the pathway between
sedentary behaviour and type 2 diabetes. Consequently, the
analyses could have been subject to overadjustment.
A few limitations should also be mentioned, of which study
design is the most important. As our analyses were cross-
sectional in nature, causal relationships could not be exam-
ined. It may therefore be possible that participants with type
2 diabetes had more sedentary time because of their poorer
health. However, when participants with type 2 diabetes on
insulin medication (who may be considered to have more
severe type 2 diabetes and could for that reason have more
sedentary time) were excluded from the analysis, the results
did not change. This may suggest that sedentary behaviour at
least partly preceded type 2 diabetes, as the associations were
similar among participants who did not necessarily have to
spend more time sedentary because of their health (data not
shown). Furthermore, previous prospective studies have dem-
onstrated that sedentary behaviour predicts markers of insulin
resistance [5, 13]. Taken together, these findings support the
hypothesis that the direction of the association is predominant-
ly from sedentary behaviour to health outcomes, although
large-scale prospective studies are warranted to provide better
insights into the directions of the associations. Further, al-
though we adjusted for a broad range of confounding factors,
it is possible that some unmeasured factors, for example die-
tary intake, partly explain the associations. Finally, sedentary
behaviour was measured during 1 week only, and this may not
truly reflect habitual behaviour.
Several previous studies have used accelerometry to objec-
tively measure sedentary behaviour and examined its associa-
tions with the metabolic syndrome. In line with our results,
larger amounts of sedentary time have been associated with
metabolic risk, although the reported effect sizes were smaller
[8, 11, 15–17]. To date, no studies have reported associations
between objectively measured sedentary time as exposure var-
iable and type 2 diabetes as outcome measure. However, a
meta-analysis of studies with self-reported measures of seden-
tary behaviour showed a risk of 112% for type 2 diabetes in the
group with the highest compared with the lowest amounts of
sedentary time [28]. Furthermore, large amounts of objectively
measured sedentary time have been associated with (markers
of) insulin resistance [5, 6, 10] and, as mentioned earlier, the
metabolic syndrome. As these factors are precursors to type 2
diabetes, the results of these studies in combination with the
results of the meta-analysis may support our findings of an
increased risk for type 2 diabetes with increasing amount of
sedentary time. Physiological mechanisms that could explain
our findings have not yet been studied extensively, but results
from animal studies suggest that responses to contractile
(in)activity of muscle cells can play a role in glucose metabo-
lism as reductions in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme that
contributes to the metabolism and transport of lipids, were seen
after periods of inactivity [29, 30].
Few observational studies have reported associations
between patterns of sedentary behaviour and metabolic health,
but the findings that have been reported are inconsistent. Some
studies have shown associations between the number of seden-
tary breaks and metabolic risk factors [6, 15, 18], while others
have not [5, 16]. These inconsistencies could be caused by
different methods for measuring breaks, which can be based
on change in acceleration or on change in posture. Also,
716
Diabetologia (2016) 59:709–718
 differences exist in the definition of a break, which can be any
interruption of sedentary time or interruptions of at least 1 min,
although we did not find different results for sedentary breaks
of any duration and breaks of at least 1 min. Further, compara-
bility of studies is hampered by differences in adjustment strat-
egies and, furthermore, associations could be different among
younger and older adults and among adults with and without (a
higher risk for) type 2 diabetes, because their metabolic profiles
differ. Studies on prolonged sedentary bouts and sedentary bout
duration are scarce and no study on associations with type 2
diabetes has been reported. However, the studies of Bankoski
[15] and Healy [7] show no statistically significant associations
of bout length or number of bouts ≥30 min with metabolic
variables, except waist circumference. Further, in our study
we used three measures for expressing the sedentary behaviour
pattern, but other measures could also be used to study the
pattern of sedentary time [31]. In order to compare studies
examining associations of numbers of both sedentary breaks
and bouts, future studies should use similar measures, and ide-
ally adjust for similar confounders.
To conclude, this was the largest study that objectively
measured total amount and patterns of sedentary behaviour
in a sample of adults with type 2 diabetes, IGM or NGM.
The results showed that an extra hour of sedentary time was
associated with increased odds of 22% for type 2 diabetes and
of 39% for the metabolic syndrome, independent of high-
intensity physical activity. The pattern in which sedentary time
was accumulated, as expressed by number of sedentary
breaks, number of prolonged sedentary bouts and average
sedentary bout duration, was only weakly associated with an
increased risk for the metabolic syndrome. Future studies in
participants with type 2 diabetes should be conducted to con-
firm our results, and to explore dose–response relationships
and causality. Nevertheless, our findings could have important
implications for public health as they suggest that sedentary
behaviour may play a significant role in the development and
prevention of type 2 diabetes, independent of high-intensity
physical activity. Consideration should be given to including
strategies to reduce the amount of sedentary time in diabetes
prevention programmes.
