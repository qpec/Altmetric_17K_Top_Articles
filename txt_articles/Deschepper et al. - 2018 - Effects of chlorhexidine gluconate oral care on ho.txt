Abstract 
Purpose: Chlorhexidine oral care is widely used in critically and non-critically ill hospitalized patients to maintain oral 
health. We investigated the effect of chlorhexidine oral care on mortality in a general hospitalized population.
Methods: In this single-center, retrospective, hospital-wide, observational cohort study we included adult hospital-
ized patients (2012–2014). Mortality associated with chlorhexidine oral care was assessed by logistic regression analy-
sis. A threshold cumulative dose of 300 mg served as a dichotomic proxy for chlorhexidine exposure. We adjusted for 
demographics, diagnostic category, and risk of mortality expressed in four categories (minor, moderate, major, and 
extreme).
Results: The study cohort included 82,274 patients of which 11,133 (14%) received chlorhexidine oral care. Low-
level exposure to chlorhexidine oral care (≤ 300 mg) was associated with increased risk of death [odds ratio (OR) 2.61; 
95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32–2.92]. This association was stronger among patients with a lower risk of death: OR 
5.50 (95% CI 4.51–6.71) with minor/moderate risk, OR 2.33 (95% CI 1.96–2.78) with a major risk, and a not significant 
OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.90–1.41) with an extreme risk of mortality. Similar observations were made for high-level exposure 
(> 300 mg). No harmful effect was observed in ventilated and non-ventilated ICU patients. Increased risk of death was 
observed in patients who did not receive mechanical ventilation and were not admitted to ICUs. The adjusted num-
ber of patients needed to be exposed to result in one additional fatality case was 47.1 (95% CI 45.2–49.1).
Conclusions: These data argue against the indiscriminate widespread use of chlorhexidine oral care in hospitalized 
patients, in the absence of proven benefit in specific populations.

Introduction
Ventilator-associated pneumonia remains an impor-
tant threat to critically ill patients as it is associated 
with considerable morbidity, and possibly mortality, 
thereby contributing to a substantial economic burden 
[1–3]. Preventive strategies mainly target optimization 
of basic infection control measures, avoidance of delayed 
extubation, biofilm formation on the endotracheal tube 
and of micro-aspiration of subglottic secretions, pre-
vention of bacterial translocation from stomach to oro-
pharynx, and modulation of oropharyngeal colonization 
[4–8]. Regarding the last of these, the value of chlorhex-
idine oral care has been studied extensively. A meta-anal-
ysis including 12 randomized studies encompassing 2341 
patients reported a significant overall risk reduction in 
ventilator-associated pneumonia with chlorhexidine oral 
care [risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.55–0.94] [9]. The strongest effects were observed in 
cardiac surgery patients (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17–0.98) and

with higher (2%) chlorhexidine concentrations (RR 0.53, 
95% CI 0.31–0.91). Consequently, chlorhexidine oral 
care has become common practice. It is recommended 
for cardiac surgery patients in guidelines of the Cent-
ers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society 
of America (ATS/IDSA) [10, 11] and proposed as one of 
the five components of a core set of interventions in the 
ventilator bundle defined by the Institute for Healthcare 
Improvement (IHI) [12]. Although not always supported 
by evidence, chlorhexidine mouthwashes are nowadays 
widely used in a variety of patient populations, either 
critically or non-critically ill [13–15].
Recent studies, however, have incited controversy about 
chlorhexidine mouthwashes. Klompas et al. performed a 
meta-analysis involving 16 studies (including 3630 patients) 
that assessed the value of chlorhexidine oral care in the pre-
vention of nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumo-
nia [16]. The study indicated that chlorhexidine oral care is 
associated with a risk reduction for nosocomial pneumo-
nia in cardiac surgery patients (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41–0.77) 
while the risk reduction for ventilator-associated pneu-
monia in non-cardiac surgery patients was not significant 
(RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60–1.02). Unexpectedly, however, this 
meta-analysis suggested a trend towards increased mortal-
ity among patients receiving chlorhexidine oral care (RR 
1.13, 95% CI 0.99–1.28), an effect exclusively observed in 
non-cardiac surgery patients. In another meta-analysis, 
pooling the results from 11 randomized controlled trials in 
general intensive care units (including 2618 patients), Price 
et al. found chlorhexidine oral care to be associated with 
increased mortality (odds ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.05–1.50) 
[17]. Finally, in a retrospective study evaluating associations 
between ventilator bundle components and outcomes, 
chlorhexidine oral care appeared to be associated with 
increased ventilator mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.63, 
95% CI 1.15–2.31] [18]. Therefore, the international ERS/
ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT guidelines for the management of 
ventilator-associated pneumonia has not issued a recom-
mendation until more safety data become available [19].
These observations warrant further investigation of 
chlorhexidine in oral care. The objective of this study is 
to assess the effect of chlorhexidine oral care on hospital 
mortality in a large cohort. As chlorhexidine oral care is 
frequently used in a variety of hospitalized patients, and 
no mortality data in non-ICU patients are available, this 
study is explicitly conducted hospital-wide.
Methods
Study design and data source
This is a retrospective, observational cohort study includ-
ing patients hospitalized at Ghent University Hospi-
tal. Variables were extracted from data required by the 
Belgian government, including billing data for the obliga-
tory health insurance (Healthcare Fund/National Health 
Service), and administrative and medical data for the 
Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety, and 
Environment (Hospital Discharge Dataset). The study 
was approved by the ethics committee at Ghent Univer-
sity Hospital (Belgian registration no. B670201731386).
Study variables
The outcome variable is hospital mortality. The main 
explanatory variable is chlorhexidine oral care. Chlorhex-
idine oral care is covered by a protocol prescribing a rinse-
and-spit approach for autonomous patients and cleaning 
of the oral cavity by the nurse with chlorhexidine soaked 
sterile gauze in dependent patients. Chlorhexidine oral 
care is applied twice daily in general wards and thrice daily 
in ICUs. We used a dichotomic proxy for chlorhexidine 
exposure to adjust for the extent of exposure in individ-
ual patients, defining low (≤ 300 mg) or high (> 300 mg) 
exposure, respectively. The cutoff of 300 mg corresponds 
to the content of a standard bottle of 0.12% chlorhexidine 
of 250 mL. The average amount of chlorhexidine solution 
used per oral care provision is about 15 mL and hence 
in thrice-daily oral care, use of more than 300 mg trans-
lates into an exposure time of more than 5–6 days. This 
measure of chlorhexidine exposure covers chlorhexidine 
concentration (0.05% or 0.12%), frequency of oral care 
provision, and exposure time in a single variable. Indica-
tions for chlorhexidine oral care cover a wide spectrum of 
conditions ranging from pneumonia prevention to stoma-
titis and halitosis. Furthermore, chlorhexidine as a com-
ponent of oral care is often applied in dependent patients 
irrespective of a medical indication.
To correct for confounding the following patient charac-
teristics are considered: age at admission, sex, emergency 
admission (i.e., admission via emergency room), medical or 
surgical admission (based on principal diagnosis and pro-
cedure), and diagnostic category. Adjustment for diagnostic 
category is based on 25 classes of Major Diagnostic Cate-
gory (MDC), grouped according to the primary diagnoses 
as defined in the International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) sys-
tem [20]. Furthermore, adjustment for risk of mortality is 
based on the All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Groups 
(APR-DRG) [21]. The APR-DRG methodology has been

developed to permit outcome analysis across large cohorts 
and provides a means of relating the type of patients a 
hospital treats to the costs incurred by the hospital [22]. 
Patients are allocated to an APR-DRG group on the basis of 
principal diagnosis and procedures [21]. APR-DRGs extend 
the basic DRG structure by adding two sets of subclasses 
to each base APR-DRG, i.e., risk of mortality and severity 
of illness. These are based on the secondary diagnoses. The 
risk of mortality metrics are used for risk adjustment within 
each DRG [23–25]. Risk of mortality is expressed in four 
categories: minor, moderate, major, and extreme risk.
Patient selection
The study cohort includes patients hospitalized and dis-
charged between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014. 
Only patients aged 16 years or more at time of admission 
were taken into account. Hospitalized patients allocated 
to an APR-DRG category without risk of mortality were 
not considered. Therefore, we excluded all patients admit-
ted to psychiatric or rehabilitation wards. Additionally, 
we refined the data set by excluding all MDCs with less 
than six deceased patients: MDC02 (diseases and dis-
orders of the eye), MDC14 (pregnancy, childbirth, and 
puerperium), MDC15 (newborns and other neonates with 
conditions originating in the perinatal period), MDC20 
(alcohol/drug use and alcohol/drug induced organic men-
tal disorders). Appendix 1 describes the flowchart of the 
patient selection process. Multiple episodes of hospitali-
zations were considered as separate admissions.
Statistical analyses
Descriptives
Descriptive data are expressed as n (%) or median (25th–
75th percentile). The Pearson chi-square test was used for 
the comparison of categorical variables and the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test for the comparison of continuous variables.
Logistic regression
To assess relationships with mortality we used a logistic 
regression analysis with the logit link function. Specifica-
tions of the model are described in Supplementary Appen-
dix 2. The logistic regression models were validated by 
plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 
computing the sensitivity and specificity, and calculating 
the area under the curve. Therefore we split the cohort 
into a 2:1 random training and test data set. The model is 
fit (trained) using the training data set and then assessed 
by applying the model to the test data set. Results of the 
logistic regression analyses are reported as odds ratio (OR) 
and 95% CI; p < 0.05 denotes statistical significance.
We used the OR generated by the logistic regression 
analysis to calculate the “number needed to be exposed” 
to encounter one additional outcome with adjustment for 
confounding variables and using the multivariate delta 
method for calculating 95% CIs [26].
Effect of chlorhexidine oral care on mortality according 
to risk of mortality category
Because the effect of chlorhexidine oral care on the 
outcome may vary according to the risk of mortality, 
separate logistic regression models were performed in 
distinct risk of mortality categories. In these models 
patients with minor and moderate risk of mortality were 
merged because of the relatively low outcome events 
among patients with minor risk of mortality (91 deaths 
representing 0.17%).
Effect of chlorhexidine oral care on mortality in patients 
undergoing cardiothoracic and vascular surgery
We assessed the impact of chlorhexidine oral care on 
mortality in a subgroup of cardiothoracic and vascular 
surgery patients because of two reasons. First, the evi-
dence of a favorable effect of chlorhexidine oral care in 
the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia is most robust 
in cardiac surgery patients [9, 16]. Second, in the meta-
analysis by Klompas et al. the trend towards increased 
mortality could be completely attributed to the use of 
chlorhexidine oral care in non-cardiac surgery patients, 
whereas in cardiac surgery patients no effect on mor-
tality was observed (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.25–3.14) [16]. 
For this purpose we selected two subgroups of patients. 
The first group involves patients undergoing major car-
diothoracic and vascular surgery, while the second 
group encompasses the total spectrum of both major 
and minor cardiothoracic and vascular procedures. For 
the patient selection on major cardiothoracic and vas-
cular surgery we considered patients with the following 
APR-DRGs: APR-DRG 160 (major cardiothoracic repair 
of heart anomaly), APR-DRG 165 (coronary bypass with 
cardiac catheterization or percutaneous cardiac proce-
dure), APR-DRG 166 (coronary bypass without cardiac 
catheterization or percutaneous cardiac procedure), and 
APR-DRG 169 (major thoracic and abdominal vascular 
procedures). The broader selection involved all surgical 
patients included in MDC-05 (diseases and disorders of 
the circulatory system).
Effect of chlorhexidine oral care on mortality in patients 
with or without mechanical ventilation
Because chlorhexidine oral care is a particular indica-
tion for mechanically ventilated patients we assessed 
the impact of this practice in patients who did and did 
not experience mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the 
group of ventilated patients was dichotomized accord-
ing to length of mechanical ventilation (≤ 96 or > 96 h). 
We further analyze the non-ventilated patients with 
 1020
admission on an ICU department during their hospital 
stay.
All analyses are performed using R Statistical Software, 
version 3.3.
Results
Description of the study cohort and unadjusted 
relationships between chlorhexidine oral care 
and mortality
During the study period 107,308 patients were hospital-
ized and discharged. After exclusion of admissions as per 
protocol the final study cohort included 82,274 patients. 
Supplementary Appendix Fig. 1 describes the flowchart 
of the patient selection process.
Overall, 11,133 (14%) patients received chlorhexidine 
oral care during their hospitalization, either in a solu-
tion of 0.05% (n = 1175) or 0.12% (n = 9963). Table 1 
reports patient characteristics stratified for survivors 
and non-survivors. In this unadjusted analysis the use 
of chlorhexidine oral care was significantly higher in 
patients who died. Table 2 describes the mortality rates 
for patients with and without chlorhexidine oral care 
stratified for risk of mortality category.

and mortality
Total study cohort
Table 3 shows the results of the final logistic regression 
model assessing the effect of chlorhexidine oral care on 
mortality in the total study cohort, after selecting all rel-
evant variables based on AIC. The use of chlorhexidine 
oral care is significantly associated with increased risk of 
death. The ROC curve for the test cohort shows an area 
under the curve of 0.94 (Supplementary Appendix 3). 
The adjusted number of patients needed to be exposed 
to chlorhexidine oral care to result in one additional case 
fatality is 47.15 (95% CI 45.19–49.11).

To assess the impact of chlorhexidine oral care on the 
discriminative power of the logistic regression model we 
subsequently performed a logistic regression model but 
without chlorhexidine oral care as covariate. This model 
had less predictive value (χ2 = 307.75, degrees of free-
dom = 2, p < 0.001), thereby stressing the importance of 
chlorhexidine oral care as a predictor of mortality.

mortality. Among patients with a major risk of mortality 
(category 3) chlorhexidine oral care is significantly asso-
ciated with mortality, as in patients with a minor or mod-
erate risk of mortality (category 1 and 2).
Cardiothoracic and vascular surgery patients
The selection of major cardiothoracic and vascular sur-
gery patients encompassed 1106 patients of which 922 
received chlorhexidine oral care (83.4%). Mortality in 
this subgroup was 3.80% (n = 42). Logistic regression 
analysis revealed that chlorhexidine oral care had no 
effect on mortality in these patients (chlorhexidine expo-
sure ≤ 300 mg OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.20–2.89; p = 0.594, chlo-
rhexidine exposure > 300 mg OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.29–3.39; 
p = 0.594). Thereafter, we broadened the patient selection 
to all cardiothoracic and vascular surgery patients. This 
subgroup included 6334 patients of which 1915 received 
chlorhexidine (30.2%) and 156 died (2.47%). In this 
patient category the relationship between chlorhexidine 
oral care and mortality also did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (chlorhexidine exposure ≤ 300 mg OR 0.96; 95% 
CI 0.60–1.55; p = 0.874, chlorhexidine exposure > 300 mg 
OR 1.43; 95% CI 0.88–2.32; p = 0.146) (Supplementary 
Appendix 4). Subanalyses for all MDCs are reported in 
Supplementary Appendix 5.
Mechanical ventilation
Absolute numbers show that mortality in patients who 
did and did not receive chlorhexidine oral care is sub-
stantially different among the groups with and without 
mechanical ventilation.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that chlorhexidine 
oral care had no harmful effect on the group of ventilated 
patients. After splitting this group according to length of 
mechanical ventilation a beneficial effect was noted for 
patients ventilated ≤ 96 h. No effect was observed among 
patients ventilated for > 96 h.
Chlorhexidine oral care was associated with increased 
risk of death in patients who did not receive mechanical 
ventilation and were not admitted to the ICU during their 
hospitalization. Contrariwise, among non-ventilated ICU 
patients no deleterious effect of chlorhexidine oral care 
was observed. Absolute mortality figures and results are 
provided in Table 5.
Discussion
This large retrospective, cohort study revealed that chlo-
rhexidine oral care is associated with increased mortality 
in a general hospitalized population. While the deleteri-
ous impact is evident in all risk of mortality categories, 
the risk of death estimates stepwise increase with lower 
risk of mortality categories. Among patients undergo-
ing major cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, as well as 
among patients receiving mechanical ventilation, chlo-
rhexidine oral care was not associated with increased 
mortality.
This study has limitations. Firstly, this is an obser-
vational study and is therefore prone to bias. Also the 
observational study design did not allow an in-depth 
analysis of the microbiological effect of chlorhexidine. 
Secondly, adjustment for diagnostic category might be 
suboptimal as the categories are broad and may include 
wide ranges of diseases. However, the assignment of a 
risk of mortality subclass takes into consideration pri-
mary diagnosis, secondary diagnoses, including underly-
ing conditions, age, surgical/medical procedures, as well 
as interactions between these covariates [21]. This risk of 
mortality categorization previously proved to correlate 
strongly with observed mortality in a setting encompass-
ing a broad case-mix [25]. Also, when considering our 
total cohort, the observed mortality stepwise escalates

with increasing risk of mortality categories. Therefore, 
we assume that accurate risk adjustment for mortality 
was achieved. Nevertheless, this study remains a rough 
epidemiological exercise and risk adjustment might not 
be accurate for specific subgroups. Thirdly, this study is 
exclusively based on administrative data and may lack the 
subtleties of data collected from clinical files. Fourthly, 
we dichotomized the cumulative chlorhexidine dose. This 
implies that patients in the group ≤ 300 mg might have 
been exposed to a single oral care provision (approxi-
mately 15 mL or 18 mg) as well as to thrice-daily oral 
care for 6 days. We were not capable of adjusting for the 
exact length of exposure time. On the same line more 
specific analyses according to length of stay or length of 
mechanical ventilation were not possible as the database 
does not include any time-dependent variables. Finally, 
all patients were treated with a mouth rinse containing 
low concentrations of chlorhexidine (0.05% or 0.12%). 
We were unable to compare to outcomes associated with 
higher concentrations such as 0.2%, 1%, and 2% [27, 28]. 
Also, the number of patients receiving oral care with 
the 0.05% chlorhexidine solution was too low to allow a 
meaningful comparison with those exposed to the 0.12% 
concentration.
The adverse effect of chlorhexidine oral care on out-
come is greater among patients with an inherently more 
favorable prognosis. This might be explained by a rela-
tively greater attributable mortality due to chlorhexidine 
in moderately as compared to severely ill patients in 
which a substantial proportion of mortality can be attrib-
uted to disease severity.
In the subgroup of patients ventilated < 96 h a small 
beneficial effect was observed among those exposed to 
chlorhexidine, an observation that contradicts previous 
reports [16–18]. This result, however, must be inter-
preted with caution. A vast majority of ventilated patients 
did receive chlorhexidine oral care. Patients not receiving 
chlorhexidine oral care include those who died soon after 
ICU admission. As such, survival bias might have played 
a role in favor of those exposed to chlorhexidine.
Chlorhexidine oral care significantly reduces the risk 
of nosocomial pneumonia in cardiac surgery patients. 
In the meta-analysis by Klompas et al. the trend towards 
increased risk of death was not observed in cardiac sur-
gery studies [16]. Our data confirm this finding albeit 
that we enlarged this group to patients undergoing major 
cardiothoracic and vascular surgery.
Whether the absence of an increased risk of mortal-
ity can be attributed to a reduced risk of pneumonia 
could not be demonstrated. Therefore, it remains hard 
to explain why cardiac surgery patients are spared from 
an increased risk of mortality when exposed to chlorhex-
idine oral care.
The absence of a clear pathogenic mechanism lead-
ing to increased risk of death renders these data hard to 
interpret. In intubated patients micro-aspiration of sub-
glottic secretions containing chlorhexidine has been pre-
viously proposed as a potential mechanism [16]. Indeed, a

fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been 
reported in an elderly patient who accidentally ingested 
200 mL of 5% chlorhexidine after which the patient aspi-
rated gastric contents [29]. Additionally, experimental 
animal data have demonstrated the acute pulmonary 
toxic effects of chlorhexidine [30]. In both circumstances, 
however, the exposure to chlorhexidine was much higher 
than what might be expected in terms of silent micro-
aspiration along the folds in an inflated endotracheal 
tube cuff [6]. Moreover, our observation undermines the 
aforementioned hypothesis as the association between 
chlorhexidine and increased mortality was overt in non-
ventilated patients, while absent in ventilated patients. 
Life-threatening anaphylactic reactions following expo-
sure of chlorhexidine at mucous membranes have been 
described with the use of chlorhexidine-impregnated 
intravascular catheters and gel for bladder catheteriza-
tion [31–33]. Yet, such reactions are so explicit that they 
can hardly serve as a possible explanation for an adverse 
event that remained undetected for decades. Exposing 
the oral mucosa to chlorhexidine reduces colonization 
with important respiratory pathogens but undoubtedly 
affects the normal oral microbiome as well [34]. However, 
while the role of the oral microbiome to prevent local and 
systemic disease is proven, it seems unlikely that disturb-
ing the oral microbiota might give occasion to potentially 
lethal complications in the short term [35].
Although only marginally supported by evidence, the 
practice of chlorhexidine oral care has been generalized 
to a variety of patient populations beyond cardiac sur-
gery. Considering the present data, and those provided 
by Klompas et al., we believe that chlorhexidine oral care 
in non-cardiac surgery patients should be re-evaluated. 
One might indeed question whether the increased risk of 
mortality, albeit without a clear pathogenic mechanism, 
outweighs the marginal effect in pneumonia risk reduc-
tion. Likewise, since we observed the greatest associations 
among patients with a more favorable risk profile, one 
might question the safety of chlorhexidine mouth washes 
in ambulatory settings (e.g., dentistry) where this has been 
practiced for decades without any indication towards seri-
ous toxicity, but also without any monitoring of serious 
adverse events. In any case, these new data further fuel 
the controversy on a practice that was thought to be safe 
for many years. The reason why this increased mortal-
ity risk could remain undetected is undoubtedly the low 
occurrence rate of death as well as the powering of clini-
cal trials to detect differences in pneumonia, rather than in 
mortality. Future trials with chlorhexidine oral care, in any 
concentration studied, should be powered to detect differ-
ences in mortality. Furthermore, in order to bring insight 
into the pathogenic mechanism, careful observation and 
stricter recording of adverse events seem required.
In conclusion, in a general hospital population chlo-
rhexidine oral care is significantly associated with 
increased mortality. The risk estimates for death are 
higher among patients with an intrinsically more favora-
ble prognosis. In cardiac surgery patients and patients on 
mechanical ventilation no effect on mortality was found. 
These findings incite reconsideration of the practice of 
chlorhexidine oral care in patient populations for which 
an evidence-based benefit is lacking.
