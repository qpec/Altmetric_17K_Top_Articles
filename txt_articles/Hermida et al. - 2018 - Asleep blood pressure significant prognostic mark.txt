Aims
Sleep-time blood pressure (BP) is a stronger risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events than awake and
24 h BP means, but the potential role of asleep BP as therapeutic target for diminishing CVD risk is uncertain.
We investigated whether CVD risk reduction is most associated with progressive decrease of either office or am-
bulatory awake or asleep BP mean.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We prospectively evaluated 18 078 individuals with baseline ambulatory BP ranging from normotension to hyper-
tension. At inclusion and at scheduled visits (mainly annually) during follow-up, ambulatory BP was measured for
48 consecutive hours. During the 5.1-year median follow-up, 2311 individuals had events, including 1209 experienc-
ing the primary outcome (composite of CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure,
and stroke). The asleep systolic blood pressure (SBP) mean was the most significant BP-derived risk factor for the
primary outcome [hazard ratio 1.29 (95% CI) 1.22–1.35 per SD elevation, P < 0.001], regardless of office [1.03
(0.97–1.09), P = 0.32], and awake SBP [1.02 (0.94–1.10), P = 0.68]. Most important, the progressive attenuation of
asleep SBP was the most significant marker of event-free survival [0.75 (95% CI 0.69–0.82) per SD decrease,
P < 0.001], regardless of changes in office [1.07 (0.97–1.17), P = 0.18], or awake SBP mean [0.96 (0.85–1.08),
P = 0.47] during follow-up.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Asleep SBP is the most significant BP-derived risk factor for CVD events. Furthermore, treatment-induced decrease
of asleep, but not awake SBP, a novel hypertension therapeutic target requiring periodic patient evaluation by am-
bulatory monitoring, is associated with significantly lower risk for CVD morbidity and mortality.

Introduction
Specific features of the 24h blood pressure (BP) pattern determined
by ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring (ABPM) have been
explored as biomarkers or mediators of target tissue injury and trig-
gers of and risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.1
Various independent prospective investigations and meta-analyses
demonstrate the ABPM-derived asleep BP mean is a stronger risk fac-
tor for CVD events than the awake and 24 h BP means or daytime of-
fice blood pressure measurements (OBPM).2–7 On the basis of the
substantial evidence documenting ABP is a marker of long-term CVD
outcomes independently of OBPM,2,5–8 several international guide-
lines and recommendations now propose ABPM as requirement to
confirm the diagnosis of adult hypertension.9,10
All
previous
studies
addressing
the
merit
of
ABPM
vs.
OBPM as risk factor or even predictor for CVD events, except
the Monitorizacio
´n Ambulatoria para Prediccio
´n de Eventos
Cardiovasculares Study (MAPEC, Ambulatory Blood Pressure
Monitoring for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events),5,11 relied solely
upon a single, low-reproducible12 24h ABPM evaluation per partici-
pant. This approach is unsound because it presumes all features of
the baseline-determined ABP pattern are maintained without alter-
ation throughout the many years of follow-up despite institution or
modification of BP-lowering therapy, aging, and development of tar-
get organ damage and concomitant morbidity. Additionally, lack of
systematic and multiple ABPM evaluations of participants over time
in all previously reported long-term follow-up studies, except
MAPEC, precluded exploration of the potential relationship between
modification of specific ABP parameters by hypertension therapy and
reduction of CVD risk. Incorporation of periodic, at least annual,
ABPM patient assessment during follow-up in the single-centre
MAPEC Study first established therapeutic reduction of the asleep
BP mean and enhancement of the sleep-time relative BP decline to-
wards the normal dipper BP pattern lessen CVD risk,5 results yet
awaiting validation particularly in the routine primary care clinical
setting.
The Hygia Project is a research network established to extend the
use of ABPM in primary care to diagnose hypertension, evaluate re-
sponse to treatment, and assess patient CVD and other risks.13
Among the multiple ongoing ABPM-based studies within the net-
work, we here report the findings on two of the main objectives of
the Hygia Project, namely to: (i) compare the potential incremental
value of multiple ABPM-derived parameters with OBPM as risk
markers of CVD morbidity and mortality and (ii) most important
from the therapeutic point of view, prospectively investigate whether
specific treatment-induced changes in ABPM-derived parameters,
primarily the progressive decrease in asleep BP mean, reduce
CVD risk.
Methods
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The prospective multicentre Hygia Project was approved by the state
Ethics Committee of Clinical Research. Details of the study design, man-
agement, investigators’ training, quality control, safety and compliance as-
sessment, clinical and ABPM procedures, sample size calculations, follow-
up, and all other relevant methodological aspects of the Hygia Project are
extensively described elsewhere.13 Presently, the Hygia Project is com-
posed of 40 clinical sites (primary care centres) within the Galician Social
Security Health Service [Servicio Galego de Sau
´de (SERGAS), Northern
Spain] involving 292 investigators properly trained to ABPM and all study
procedures. The sample for testing the two specific hypotheses stated
above represents a population of Spanish men and women >
_18years of
age, adhering to a routine of daytime activity and night-time sleep,
referred for ABPM mainly to confirm/refute the diagnosis of hypertension
inferred by daytime OBPM of untreated individuals or to evaluate BP con-
trol in treated hypertensive persons, and who provided written informed
consent for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, history of drug/
alcohol abuse, night/shift-work employment, acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome, secondary hypertension, CVD disorders (unstable angina pec-
toris, heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, kidney fail-
ure, and Grade III–IV retinopathy), intolerance to ABPM, and inability to
communicate and comply with all study requirements. For the present
study, the targeted median follow-up was 5 years, with an a priori
required >
_1-year minimal follow-up per participant.13
Participants, treatment, and diagnostic
criteria
Between 2008 and 2015, we recruited 18 731 persons who fulfilled the
inclusion/exclusion criteria, with 18 158 providing all required informa-
tion for study. The other 573 individuals were excluded due to inad-
equate ABPM sampling at baseline and non-consent for follow-up ABPM
evaluations. Additionally, 80 participants were excluded due to lack of
the required 1-year minimum follow-up. Thus, the final evaluated popula-
tion for the hypotheses tested herein is 18 078 persons [9769 men/8309
women; 59.1± 14.3 (mean± standard deviation (SD)) years of age].
Hypertension was defined according to current ABPM criteria: awake
systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) mean
>
_135/85mmHg, or asleep SBP/DBP mean >
_120/70mmHg, or BP-
lowering treatment.14,15 According to these ABPM criteria, 15 674 partic-
ipants were hypertensive at the time of recruitment (9709 untreated)
and assigned, as previously described,13 either to ingest the entire dose of
at least one BP-lowering medication (ARB, ACEI, CCB, ß-blocker, and/or
diuretic) at bedtime (and the remaining ones, if any, upon awakening) or
all of them upon awakening (Supplementary material online, Table S1).
Participating physicians were given the choice of prescribing any medica-
tion of their choice from any of the five listed recommended therapeutic
classes as first-line therapy in untreated participants and combination
therapy for uncontrolled individuals. If, based on the ABPM threshold cri-
teria provided above, the ABP of a given patient remained uncontrolled
at any time during follow-up when treated with medication(s) at the max-
imum recommended dose(s), additional therapy could be added in keep-
ing with current clinical practice guidelines.15
Diabetes was defined as fasting glucose >
_126 mg/dL on at least two
clinical assessments >
_3 months apart in participants without prior history
of diabetes, or glucose-lowering treatment.16 Diagnosis of metabolic syn-
drome was established by the National Cholesterol Education Program
Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) revised definition.17 Chronic kidney
disease (CKD) was defined as either estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) <60mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria (albumin/creatinine ratio
>
_30mg/gCr), or both, on at least two occasions >
_3 months apart.18
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) was estimated by the CKD-EPI equation.19
Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea (apnoea/hypopnoea index >
_10)
was corroborated by overnight in-hospital polysomnography when the
participant reported significant daytime hypersomnia or he/she or bed-
mate reported loud snoring, choking, interrupted breathing, and/or mul-
tiple awakenings during night-time sleep.

Ambulatory blood pressure and other
assessments
At inclusion and thereafter at every scheduled clinic visit throughout
follow-up, trained investigators obtained at least three consecutive
OBPM from participants using a validated automatic oscillometric device
(HEM-705IT, Omron Health Care Inc., Vernon Hills, IL, USA) after rest-
ing in a seated position for >
_10min. Immediately thereafter, ABPM was
instituted with a properly calibrated and validated SpaceLabs 90207 de-
vice (SpaceLabs Inc., Issaquah, WA, USA) to measure SBP, DBP, and heart
rate every 20min between 07:00 and 23:00 h and every 30min during the
night for 48 consecutive hours. The BP cuff was always worn on the non-
dominant arm. Upper arm circumference was measured at each study
visit to ensure proper cuff size for OBPM and ABP assessment. The moni-
toring period was 48h, instead of the most usual 24h, to optimize repro-
ducibility of results, as accurate calculation of ABP characteristics
(including mean BP values), and dipping classification depends markedly
on ABPM duration.12 Individuals were instructed to adhere to their usual
activities with minimal restrictions, but to avoid daytime napping and
maintain a similar activity-rest schedule during the two consecutive days
of monitoring. Participants kept a diary to list, among other information,
time of retiring to bed at night, awakening in the morning, consumption
of meals, and ingestion of medications. Such individualized information
was used to derive the awake and asleep BP means of each person. In
keeping with current recommendations,14 BP series were considered in-
valid for analysis, and thus requiring repeated ABPM, if >
_30% of the meas-
urements were missing, data were lacking for an interval of >2h, data
were obtained when the rest-activity schedule was irregular or inconsist-
ent during the 2 days of monitoring, or the sleep span was <6 h or >12 h.
Blood and urine samples were obtained at every clinic visit for ABPM
evaluation. Participants arrived to the clinical centre between 08:00 and
09:00 h, after overnight fasting, for blood withdrawal from an antecubital
vein. Blood and urine samples were analysed using routine automatic
techniques at the corresponding laboratory facility of the SERGAS, all
complying with the same quality standards.
Follow-up
Identical above-described evaluation procedures were scheduled annual-
ly, or more frequently in uncontrolled hypertensive participants and
those affected by compelling clinical conditions associated with increased
CVD
risk—including
diabetes,
CKD,
and
past
CVD
events.13
Investigators, mainly those of the Hygia Project Scientific Committee,
reviewed the complete electronic clinical records of every enrolled par-
ticipant at least annually and at least 1 year following each person’s last
ABPM evaluation. Categorization of CVD and other events listed in the
electronic clinical records was accomplished by previously defined diag-
nostic criteria at the corresponding referring tertiary hospital services
and by external non-investigator medical specialists.13 The Hygia Project
Events Committee, composed of independent clinicians blinded to med-
ical records, ABPM findings, and treatment scheme of those with hyper-
tension, periodically and collegiately evaluated such clinical reports,
dissociated from the participant’s identification, to ascertain and certify
every documented event. Registered events include: death from all
causes, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary revascularization,
heart failure, lower extremities acute arterial occlusion, retinal artery
thrombotic occlusion, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, and transi-
ent ischaemic attack. The a priori defined primary vascular study endpoint
is CVD outcome (composite of CVD death, myocardial infarction, coron-
ary revascularization, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, and haemorrhagic
stroke).13
Statistical methods
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring profiles were automatically
edited according to conventional criteria to remove measurement errors
and outliers: SBP readings >250 or <70mmHg, DBP >150 or
<40 mmHg, and pulse pressure (PP, SBP - DBP) >150 or <20mmHg.
The ‘48 h ABP mean’ was calculated using all valid readings of the 48h as-
sessment span. Awake and asleep ABP means were calculated using all
valid readings of the actual hours, respectively, of daytime activity and
night-time sleep as differentiated by participant diary entries. To avoid
confounding by non-equidistant BP sampling on mean values,14 the 48h,
awake, and asleep spans were each divided into an integer number of
classes of identical time length. The respective 48h, awake, and asleep BP
means were then determined as the average of the corresponding BP
means obtained for each time-class. Sleep-time relative BP decline (index
of BP dipping), percent decrease in mean BP during night-time sleep rela-
tive to mean BP during daytime activity, was calculated as: [(awake ABP
mean - asleep ABP mean)/awake ABP mean]� 100, utilizing all valid data
of 48h ABPM. Participants were designated as dipper if the sleep-time
relative SBP decline was >
_10%, and as non-dipper otherwise.14,15
Cardiovascular disease risk was evaluated on the basis of the: (i) base-
line ABPM evaluation per participant, as customary in all previous ABPM
reports2–7; (ii) final ABPM evaluation, i.e. that just before (usually <1year)
each documented event or last ABPM evaluation in non-event cases; and
(iii) decrease from baseline during follow-up in OBPM and all potentially
relevant ABPM-derived parameters.
Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared among
groups of participants who did and did not experience an event by t-test
(quantitative variables) or non-parametric v2 test (proportions). The
Cox proportional-hazard model, adjusted for significant confounding vari-
ables, served to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for events per
tested potential prognostic BP parameter as well as their combinations.
We standardized these HR by expressing them in terms of 1-SD incre-
ments of the BP parameter. All demographic, anthropometric, and clinical
laboratory variables of Table 1 were tested as potential confounding vari-
ables by non-automatic (forward and backward) stepwise Cox survival
analysis. Adjustments were finally applied for the jointly significant influen-
tial characteristics of age, sex, type 2 diabetes, CKD, cigarette smoking,
high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, hypertension treatment-
time (either all BP-lowering medications upon awakening vs. the daily
dosing of at least one medication at bedtime), and history of previous
CVD event, as they were the only ones consistently significant in the
tested Cox regression models. On the other hand, the impact of BP re-
duction during follow-up on CVD risk was evaluated by entering the de-
crease from baseline in the analysed BP parameter at each subsequent
ABPM evaluation as a time-dependent covariate in the Cox regression
analysis, thus allowing also proper confirmation of the underlying hypoth-
eses for the analysis. For survival analysis, follow-up was established as
the time-interval from the date of the analysed ABPM assessment to ei-
ther the date of the confirmed event or that of the last clinical evaluation
in non-event participants.
We additionally compared the discriminative and predictive added
value of the different tested ABPM parameters to OBPM by the C statistic
(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve)20 and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC).21 Model selection was performed by evalu-
ating differences in AIC between tested ABPM parameters according to
the rules proposed by Burnham & Anderson.22 Lack of significant collin-
earity between the asleep BP mean and all other tested OBPM and ABP
parameters was ascertained by calculating tolerance coefficients and cor-
responding variance inflation factors. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R version 3.3.3
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

Results
Demographic characteristics and
laboratory variables
During the median follow-up period of 5.1 years (range 1.0–
8.4 years), 2311 individuals had any of the listed registered events,
including 1209 experiencing the main CVD outcome (CVD death:
227; myocardial infarction: 205; coronary revascularization: 217;
heart failure: 295; stroke: 265). Event-subjects were predominant-
ly men, of older age, and at baseline were likely to have type 2 dia-
betes, metabolic syndrome, anaemia, CKD, and/or history of
previous CVD event (Table 1). In addition, at baseline they had
greater OBPM SBP and PP (but lower OBPM DBP), plus labora-
tory findings of higher glucose, creatinine, uric acid, and urinary al-
bumin/creatinine ratio, but lower eGFR and HDL-cholesterol
(Table 1). At baseline, the 48 h mean of SBP was significantly
greater and that of DBP significantly lower among event-subjects
(Table 1). The largest difference between the event and non-event
cohorts was in the asleep SBP mean. Moreover, the sleep-time
relative SBP decline was significantly lower (P < 0.001) and preva-
lence of non-dipping significantly higher, 66 vs. 44%, among event-
subjects (P < 0.001; Table 1). All differences between groups
reported in Table 1 with a P-value <0.001 would remain significant
after correction for multiple testing.

associated with male gender [HR 1.56 95% confidence interval
(CI) (1.36–1.81), P < 0.001]; older age [1.32 (1.28–1.36), P < 0.001,
per 5 years]; presence of type 2 diabetes [1.20 (1.04–1.37),
P = 0.012]; presence of CKD [2.07 (1.79–2.39), P < 0.001]; cigar-
ette

[1.54
(1.26–1.89),
P < 0.001];
reduced
HDL-
cholesterol [0.90 (0.86–0.94), P < 0.001, per 10 mg/dL]; and his-
tory of previous CVD event [2.36 (2.03–2.75), P < 0.001].
Additionally, consistent with previous findings,11 hypertensive
patients assigned to take at least one BP-lowering medication at
bedtime (intention-to-treat analysis) had a significantly lower HR
of CVD outcome than those ingesting all such medications upon
awakening [0.47 (0.42–0.54); P < 0.001]. There were no statistical-
ly significant differences at baseline between these two balanced
treatment-groups in prevalence of metabolic syndrome, type 2
diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea, CKD, history of previous
CVD events, and obesity, plus all evaluated anthropometric and
clinical laboratory test variables (Supplementary material online,
Table S1). OBPM, average ABP values, and prevalence of non-
dipping at baseline were also not significantly different between
groups (Supplementary material online, Table S1). There were no
differences at the end of the study in the classes and number of
hypertension medications (usually at maximum doses) prescribed
for therapy between patients of the two treatment-time schemes
(Supplementary material online, Table S2). The most frequent
treatment-schemes in monotherapy were ARB or ACEI (69%)
and CCB (12%); combinations of ARB/ACEI with either diuretic
(43%) or CCB (26%) in double therapy; and combinations of ARB/
ACEI-diuretic with CCB (60%) or ß-blocker (28%) among patients
treated with >
_3 medications. Data of the last ABPM evaluation
revealed significantly lower asleep, but not awake, SBP/DBP
means in participants of the bedtime than morning-treatment regi-
men (P < 0.001; Supplementary material online, Table S2). The
sleep-time relative SBP/DBP decline was significantly greater
among those of the bedtime-treatment regimen; accordingly, the
proportion of patients with the non-dipper BP pattern was signifi-
cantly lower in the bedtime than the morning-treatment group
(32 vs. 50%; P < 0.001).
Table 2 (left column) reports the Cox proportional-hazard
model derived adjusted-HR of CVD outcome calculated on the
basis of the baseline OBPM and ABP evaluations per participant.
The asleep SBP mean was the most significant BP marker of CVD
risk [per 1-SD elevation, HR 1.34 (1.27–1.40), P < 0.001; Table 2,
left column]. Interestingly, a greater either morning or pre-
awakening BP surge calculated as previously defined23 was signifi-
cantly associated with lower, not higher, CVD risk (Table 2, left
column), a finding consistent with the highly significant association
between greater sleep-time relative BP decline and attenuated
risk. The merit of the asleep SBP mean as marker of CVD risk was
highly significant independent of absence/presence of hyperten-
sion therapy at baseline [HR 1.30 (1.18–1.42), P < 0.001; and 1.31
(1.24–1.38), P < 0.001, respectively] or treatment-time schedule
during follow-up, i.e. for hypertensive participants of the awaken-
ing [HR 1.27 (1.20–1.35), P < 0.001] vs. bedtime-treatment-sched-
ule groups [1.39 (1.27–1.53), P < 0.001] analysed separately. The
same conclusions regarding the significantly greater value of asleep
SBP as risk marker were also obtained from analysis of total events
(including death from any cause and all others listed above) as out-
come variable.
Table 2 (centre column) reports the HR of CVD based on OBPM
and ABPM of the final evaluation. The findings are similar to those
described above for the corresponding baseline evaluation (Table 2,
left column), thereby providing further evidence for the greater value
of the asleep BP mean and sleep-time relative BP decline compared
to any of the other ABP characteristics analysed separately as poten-
tial individual markers of CVD risk (Figure 1A).
We next explored the potential combined contribution to CVD
risk of the multiple BP parameters listed in Table 2. When the asleep
SBP mean was jointly evaluated as an additional confounding variable
with either OBPM-derived SBP or any other ABPM-derived SBP
parameter, only the former was a significant marker of CVD risk
[1.29 (95% CI 1.22–1.35) per SD elevation in asleep SBP, P < 0.001;
1.03 (0.97–1.09) per SD elevation in OBPM SBP, P = 0.32; and
1.02 (0.94–1.10) per SD elevation in awake SBP mean, P = 0.68;
Figure 1B]. The joint contribution with the asleep SBP mean to
CVD risk was significant only for the diminished sleep-time relative
SBP decline (P = 0.042, Figure 1B).
To further investigate the clinical relevance of the awake and
asleep BP means on CVD risk, participants were categorized for il-
lustrative purposes into four mutually exclusive cohorts according
to ABP level, i.e. normal or high awake and normal or high
asleep BP mean, independent of OBPM, using established
ABPM thresholds of 135/85 mmHg for awake SBP/DBP means and
120/70 mmHg for asleep SBP/DBP means.14,15 Figure 2A indicates:

CVD outcome: Composite of CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, and haemorrhagic stroke.
Baseline and final BP evaluation: Standardized adjusted HRs (95% CI) expressed per 1-SD elevation in each evaluated BP parameter either at the baseline evaluation upon recruit-
ment (left column) or at the last available evaluation per participant (centre column). For the individualized analysis of each listed BP parameter, adjustments were always applied for
significant influential characteristics of age, sex, diabetes, CKD, cigarette smoking, HDL-cholesterol, hypertension treatment-time, and history of previous CVD event.
Decrease during follow-up: Standardized adjusted HRs (95% CI) expressed per 1-SD decrease in each evaluated BP parameter during follow-up (right column). For the individu-
alized analysis of each listed BP parameter, adjustments were applied for significant influential characteristics of age, sex, diabetes, CKD, cigarette smoking, HDL-cholesterol,
baseline values of the tested BP parameter, hypertension treatment-time, and history of previous CVD event. Decrease in BP at each ABPM evaluation from baseline was
entered as a time-dependent covariate in the Cox regression models.
Sleep-time relative BP decline, index of BP dipping, is defined as percent decline in BP during night-time sleep relative to mean BP during daytime activity, and calculated as:
[(awake BP mean - asleep BP mean)/awake BP mean] � 100. Morning BP surge was calculated as difference between average BP during first 2 h after morning wake-up (i.e.
morning BP) and hourly BP average centred on lowest BP reading recorded during night-time sleep (i.e. lowest sleep BP). Pre-awakening BP surge was calculated as difference
between average BP during first 2 h after and average BP during 2 h just before morning wake-up. Sleep-time fall was calculated as difference between average BP during the 2 h
just before going to bed and hourly average centred on lowest BP reading recorded during night-time sleep.

mal asleep BP whether the awake BP mean is normal or elevated
(P = 0.32); (ii) equivalent HR in hypertensive patients with high
asleep BP whether the awake BP mean is normal or elevated
(P = 0.47); and (iii) significantly higher adjusted HR of CVD events
in participants with elevated than normal asleep BP mean, inde-
pendent of the awake BP mean being below or above 135/
85 mmHg (always P < 0.001).
Each of the four cohorts of participants categorized by awake and
asleep BP means in Figure 2A were further categorized according to
either normal or elevated OBPM using the most common 140/
90mmHg thresholds, i.e. yielding in total eight mutually exclusive
cohorts. Cardiovascular disease risk was significantly higher in all of
the four patient cohorts who had high asleep ABP mean, regardless
of whether OBPM or awake ABP mean was normal or elevated, than
in all of the other four cohorts of normal asleep ABP mean (Figure
2B). Additionally, there were no significant differences in HR for
CVD risk of participants with normal vs. high OBPM within each of
the four cohorts defined by awake and asleep BP means (always
P > 0.11, Figure 2B).
From the point of view of discrimination/prediction ability of
OBPM vs. ABPM, the adjusted Cox regression model that
included the asleep SBP mean had the lowest AIC among all other
BP parameters tested in Table 2. Moreover, difference in AIC with

respect to the model including asleep SBP mean was >
_25 for every
other tested BP variable, indicative of their considerably poorer
prognostic value. Furthermore, in the survival model including the
significant confounders listed above, the addition of asleep SBP
mean resulted in significantly better CVD outcome discrimination
[C-statistic 0.807 95% CI (0.793–0.821)] than inclusion of either
OBPM SBP or awake SBP mean [0.738 (0.723–0.752) and 0.728
(0.713–0.743), respectively, P < 0.001]; the discrimination ability
of either OBPM SBP or awake SBP mean was significantly
improved by adding the asleep SBP mean into the model [0.808
(0.794–0.822) and 0.810 (0.796–0.824), respectively; P < 0.001].
On the contrary, adding OBPM SBP or awake SBP to the model al-
ready including asleep SBP mean just marginally and non-
significantly improved prediction of CVD events (P > 0.87).

Cox regression analysis—adjusted by the significant confounders of
age, sex, diabetes, CKD, cigarette smoking, HDL-cholesterol, baseline
BP, hypertension treatment-time, and history of previous CVD
event—based upon progressive decrease in BP during follow-up, i.e.
difference between the values obtained per participant at recruit-
ment and each ABPM determination up to his/her final evaluation.
The decrease in the asleep SBP mean was the most significant marker
of increased event-free survival, i.e. absence of CVD outcome [0.75

ent of changes in office [1.07 (0.97–1.17), P = 0.18] or awake SBP
mean [0.96 (0.85–1.08), P = 0.47] during follow-up (Figure 3B). Only
the decrease in asleep SBP mean and increase in sleep-time relative
SBP decline towards the more normal dipper BP pattern remained
jointly and significantly associated with reduced CVD risk (Figure 3B).
The C-statistic of the model including the decrease in asleep SBP
mean during follow-up [0.827 (0.814–0.840)] was unchanged when
adding the decrease in OBPM SBP [0.827 (0.814–0.840); P = 0.92]
and reduced when adding the decrease in awake SBP mean [0.813
(0.800–0.827); P = 0.032], again reflecting the protective value of
increasing the sleep-time relative SBP decline.
Figure 4 shows, for the studied population divided into quintiles,
the relationship between CVD outcome and achieved OBPM and
ABP at final evaluation, thus suggesting potential outcome-based BP
therapeutic targets. For OBPM SBP, the adjusted HR was only slightly
higher in the last compared to the first four quintiles. There was a
slightly significant increase in CVD risk with progressively higher
awake SBP mean (Figure 4B). In contrast, across all quintiles there
was a highly significant exponential decrease in risk of CVD outcome
with progressively lower achieved asleep SBP mean (Figure 4C).
Additionally, the adjusted HR for CVD outcome increased progres-
sively and significantly when the achieved sleep-time SBP decline was
<13% (Figure 4D).

Discussion
The Hygia Project is the first outcomes study conducted within pri-
mary care-based customary clinical practice to assess prospectively,
in the so far largest cohort evaluated by repeated ABPM, the prog-
nostic value for CVD morbidity and mortality not just of OBPM and
ABP parameters upon recruitment but, of much more medical rele-
vance, changes in such during sufficient duration follow-up by period-
ic (at least annual) highly reproducible 48h ABPM in conjunction
with recorded patient diary information, as recommended,14,15 of
bedtime at night and awakening time in the morning to derive individ-
ualized awake and asleep BP means plus sleep-time relative BP de-
cline. Results document daytime OBPM is neither an independent
significant marker nor proper therapeutic target for reducing CVD
risk when the asleep BP mean is taken into account (Figures 1–3).
Figure 2 documents the assumed merit of elevated OBPM as risk fac-
tor of CVD events derives exclusively from the risk of those individu-
als who additionally have elevated BP during sleep. Analyses based on
the ABP profile obtained per participant both at baseline, as custom-
ary in all previous studies entailing ABPM as marker of CVD risk,2–7
as well as at final evaluation, usually within <1-year of every docu-
mented event, indicate the asleep SBP mean is the most significant
marker of CVD outcome among the various evaluated ABP parame-
ters (Table 2), both individually and jointly when combined with other
potential ABP-derived risk factors in the best possible Cox
proportional-hazard model (Figure 1). In fact, only the diminished
sleep-time relative SBP decline might add prognostic value to the
Cox model that already includes the asleep SBP mean and corrected
for relevant confounding variables (Figure 1B). Moreover, when the
asleep BP mean was adjusted for the OBPM or awake BP mean, only
the former remained a significant predictor of CVD outcome, regard-
less of whether the OBPM or awake BP mean was normal or ele-
vated (Figures 1B and 2). Both office and ambulatory DBP had
markedly lower prognostic value than SBP (Table 2), in keeping with
current knowledge10,15 and the recognized prognostic value of PP.
Relying on OBPM for diagnosing hypertension is associated with a
very high 47% misclassification (Groups 2, 4, 5, and 7 from left to right
in Figure 2B), rendering OBPM no better than flipping a coin to iden-
tify individuals at elevated CVD risk and in need of therapeutic
intervention.
Despite the limitations of the C-statistic to evaluate the predictive
value of highly variable and modifiable factors such as BP,20 our find-
ings further document asleep SBP mean provides significantly stron-
ger prediction/discrimination of CVD outcome than OBPM or any
other ABPM-derived parameter. Indeed, adding OBPM or awake SBP
mean to the model already including asleep SBP mean does not
improves prediction of CVD outcome, while inclusion of asleep SBP
mean significantly increases the prediction and discrimination pro-
vided by either OBPM or awake BP mean. Banegas et al.24 also found
significantly better prediction of CVD mortality with ABP than
Figure 4 Adjusted hazard ratio of cardiovascular disease outcome as a function of achieved clinic systolic blood pressure (A) and ambulatory
awake systolic blood pressure mean (B), asleep systolic blood pressure mean (C), and sleep-time relative systolic blood pressure decline (D). Studied
population was divided into five classes of equal size (quintiles). Adjustments were applied for the same variables as in Figure 1.

OBPM. On the contrary, Mortensen et al.25 concluded neither ABPM
added predictive value to OBPM, nor asleep to awake BP mean; these
findings, on a much smaller sample of patients evaluated only once by
24h ABPM, could be somehow biased, not only by the sparse sam-
pling during sleep (>30-min intervals) in half the patients, but mainly
by relying on inaccurate daytime and night-time values calculated
assuming arbitrary fixed clock hours that do not reflect the actual
rest/activity pattern of each individual. In a recent meta-analysis of
nine different cohorts,7 the difference between the HRs for asleep
and awake SBP means was indeed greater and much more significant
in studies where asleep was properly defined by either wrist-
actigraphy or individualized patient dairy than in those defined by
fixed clock-time spans. Nevertheless, taking into consideration,
among other facts, the multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenc-
ing BP regulation1 and its modification by hypertension treatment
and aging, we believe asleep BP should be preferably used as marker
of increased CVD risk, but not as a diagnostic test to attempt predic-
tion of future events.20
Beyond agreement on the limited, if any, prognostic value of
OBPM compared to ABPM, our findings differ from those by Banegas
et al.,24 as they report similar HRs for awake and asleep SBP means
(1.54 and 1.55, respectively; P < 0.001) when both were adjusted
jointly with the non-significant OBPM (HR 1.02, P = 0.08) in the same
Cox model for CVD mortality. These results, however, might be
questionable. First, the HR of awake SBP mean (adjusted by asleep
SBP mean and OBPM) reported by Banegas et al.24 for mortality due
to ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure (jointly accounting
for 80% of CVD deaths) were 1.025, 1.025, and 1.025, respectively
(their Supplementary material online, Table S3); accordingly, the
adjusted HR of awake SBP mean for total CVD mortality can hardly
be the reported 1.54, leading to the conclusion that indeed only
asleep SBP mean is a significant marker of CVD mortality. And second,
the HRs for OBPM and multiple ABPM-derived parameters reported
by Banegas et al.24 are fully identical for CVD mortality and total
mortality; this is unsound, as CVD mortality represented 34% of total
deaths and non-CVD mortality might not be associated with
increased BP in many cases (including cancer, accidents, neurological
conditions, etc.). In our study, also conducted in Spain and CVD mor-
tality accounting for a similar 36% of total deaths, the adjusted HRs of
OBPM, awake, and asleep SBP analysed jointly in the same Cox model
were: for CVD mortality 1.07 (0.94–1.22), P = 0.33; 0.89 (0.74–1.07),
P = 0.23; and 1.48 (1.26–1.73), P< 0.001, respectively; for non-CVD
mortality 0.87 (0.79–0.97), P = 0.010; 0.98 (0.85–1.13), P= 0.79; and
1.19 (1.04–1.35), P = 0.010; and for total mortality 0.94 (0.87–1.02),
P = 0.14; 0.94 (0.84–1.06), P = 0.32; and 1.30 (1.17–1.43), P < 0.001.
These findings document the expected strong difference in the prog-
nostic value of BP for CVD and non-CVD mortality, plus the highly
significant value of asleep SBP mean as marker not just of CVD out-
come (Figures 1–3) but also of CVD mortality in particular.
Most important from the perspective of prevention, evaluation of
changes in ABP parameters during follow-up documents the progres-
sive decrease in asleep SBP mean and increase in sleep-time relative
SBP decline (towards the more normal dipper BP pattern) are
significantly associated with reduced CVD risk (Figures 3 and 4). As
reported, the relationship between asleep SBP mean decrease and
CVD outcome attenuation is significant at all levels of baseline asleep
SBP mean, ranging from normotension to hypertension, suggesting
benefit even below the asleep SBP/DBP means of 120/70 mmHg,
the current diagnostic thresholds for sleep-time hypertension.14,15
Indeed, analysis of the adjusted HR for CVD outcome in terms of the
achieved asleep SBP mean at the last available evaluation per partici-
pant reveals significant risk reduction even when the sleep-time SBP
mean is <103mmHg (Figure 4C), a finding that requires further inves-
tigation specially in high-risk patients.26 Moreover, CVD risk was also
increased significantly in patients with achieved sleep-time relative
SBP decline at the final evaluation <13% (Figure 4D). This finding sug-
gests the sleep-time relative SBP decline, as a continuous variable,
and not just the dipping classification per se usually based on an arbi-
trary 10% threshold value, might be used, jointly with the asleep SBP
level, as novel clinical indices to assess and prevent risk for future
major CVD events.
The latest update of the guidelines for the clinical management of
adult primary hypertension from the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE)9 in Great Britain recommends ABPM
be conducted to corroborate the diagnosis of hypertension in all
adults with elevated OBPM. Despite available evidence, here
extended and qualified, on the greater prognostic value of asleep
than awake BP mean2–7 the NICE guidelines explicitly recommend
such diagnosis be based solely upon the ABPM-derived daytime SBP/
DBP means >
_135/85 mmHg.9 The recent 2015 US Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) report10 concludes: (i) ABPM predicts
long-term CVD outcomes independently of OBPM, and (ii) ABPM,
rather than OBPM, must be considered the reference standard in pri-
mary care medicine to diagnose hypertension in adults >
_18years of
age. On the basis of an exploratory meta-analysis showing no appar-
ent difference in HR for CVD risk per 10 mmHg increase between
the ABPM-derived night-time, daytime, and 24h SBP means, a finding
we believe is dubious because of methodological limitations of the
reviewed investigations,27 the USPSTF report concludes that anyone
of those means might be used to corroborate the diagnosis of hyper-
tension in adults.10 In contradiction with the recommendations of
the NICE and USPSTF reports, current guidelines of the European
Society of Hypertension and European Society of Cardiology state ‘it
is now generally accepted that out-of-office BP is an important
adjunct to conventional OBPM, but the latter currently remains the
‘gold standard’ for screening, diagnosis, and management of
hypertension’.15,28 The 2017 guidelines of the American College of
Cardiology and the American Heart Association also rely on OBPM
to define hypertension, although establishing lower values of 130/
80 mmHg for clinic SBP/DBP as new diagnostic thresholds and thera-
peutic targets.29 Using as reference the above discussed USPSTF re-
port,10 these guidelines state ‘out-of-office measurement of BP can
be helpful for confirmation and management of hypertension’.
Specifically, the guidelines address the importance of identifying per-
sons with masked normotension and masked hypertension; however,
these two categories are misleadingly defined by comparing OBPM
with daytime ABPM or home BP measurements, thus totally disre-
garding asleep BP as the strongest prognosticator of CVD risk.
Contrary to all these guidelines and recommendations, results of the
prospective Hygia Project collectively indicate: (i) the asleep SBP
mean is the most significant prognostic marker of CVD risk, inde-
pendent of the other conventional variables here corroborated to be
linked with increased CVD risk, such as elevated older age, male gen-
der, diabetes, CKD, and history of previous CVD event5; accordingly,

around-the-clock ABPM to derive the asleep SBP mean should be
the recommended protocol to diagnose true hypertension and prop-
erly assess CVD risk; and (ii) most important, decreasing the asleep
SBP mean is significantly protective, thus constituting a novel thera-
peutic target for reducing CVD risk over and above targeting OBPM
or awake BP mean (Figure 3B).
Among others, the major limitations of the Hygia Project are: (i) its
findings require validation and extrapolation to other ethnic groups;
(ii) OBPM was obtained in the presence of the investigator and thus
potentially overestimated, although this approach reflects current
medical practice also utilized in most previously reported studies2–7;
and (iii) with regard to the potential increase in CVD event-free sur-
vival time with progressive decrease in asleep SBP mean (Figures 3
and 4), a confirmatory study randomizing participants to at least two
different threshold goals in terms of achieved asleep SBP mean is
required to properly validate our findings. Such trial, already designed,
approved by the heath authorities, and registered (ClinicalTrials.gov,
number NCT03457168) will be conducted with the participation of
most clinical sites also involved in the Hygia Project. Yet, our study
has several strengths, mainly being the only large outcomes study
completely integrated into routine primary care and entailing period-
ic 48h ABPM evaluation at least yearly throughout the median
5.1 years of follow-up. This unique approach, used previously only in
the single-centre MAPEC study,5,11 allowed determination of the in-
fluence of changes during follow-up in relevant ABPM parameters on
CVD risk. Additional strengths of the Hygia Project are the use of: (i)
48h, instead of the most common 24 h, ABPM to increase reproduci-
bility of the BP findings12; and (ii) in the absence of wrist-actigraphy as
measured in the participants of the MAPEC study,5,11 properly
designed subject diary to ascertain the beginning and end of the activ-
ity and sleep spans and thus derive on an individual basis the awake
and asleep SBP/DBP means, rather than relying on inaccurate daytime
and night-time values calculated assuming common and arbitrary
fixed clock hours as used in many previous ABPM studies.2–4
In conclusion, according to this prospective evaluation, the asleep
SBP mean, but not daytime OBPM or awake ABP mean, is the most
significant BP marker of CVD outcome. This finding supports the crit-
ical importance of ABPM in routine clinical medicine, as recently con-
cluded by the USPSTF report,10 but more specifically to accurately
detect abnormal sleep-time BP and diagnose true hypertension.
More important, therapeutic targeting of elevated asleep SBP mean
and diminished sleep-time relative SBP decline, usually most effective-
ly achieved by bedtime ingestion of the full daily dose of one or more
hypertension medications11,30 as also corroborated in this prospect-
ive investigation, is associated with significantly lower risk for CVD
morbidity and mortality.
