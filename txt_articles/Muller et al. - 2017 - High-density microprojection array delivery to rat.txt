To secure a polio-free world, the live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) will eventually need to 
be replaced with inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV). However, current IPV delivery is less suitable for 
campaign use than OPV, and more expensive. We are progressing a microarray patch delivery platform, 
the Nanopatch, as an easy-to-use device to administer vaccines, including IPV. The Nanopatch contains 
an ultra-high density array (10,000/cm2) of short (~230 μ
m) microprojections that delivers dry coated 
vaccine into the skin. Here, we compare the relative immunogenicity of Nanopatch immunisation 
versus intramuscular injection in rats, using monovalent and trivalent formulations of IPV. Nanopatch 
delivery elicits faster antibody response kinetics, with high titres of neutralising antibody after just one 
(IPV2) or two (IPV1 and IPV3) immunisations, while IM injection requires two (IPV2) or three (IPV1 and 
IPV3) immunisations to induce similar responses. Seroconversion to each poliovirus type was seen in 
100% of rats that received ~1/40th of a human dose of IPV delivered by Nanopatch, but not in rats given 
~1/8th or ~1/40th dose by IM injection. Ease of administration coupled with dose reduction observed in 
this study suggests the Nanopatch could facilitate inexpensive IPV vaccination in campaign settings.
When the global poliovirus eradication effort began in 1988, poliovirus was endemic in over 125 countries caus-
ing >350,000 cases of paralysis each year. Through extensive use of the attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), 
polioviruses are on the verge of eradication – with only 37 cases of wild type poliovirus 1 reported in 2016, and 
with only 2 countries being endemic for poliovirus, Pakistan and Afghanistan1. The last case of wild type polio-
virus 2 was in 1999, with the virus officially declared eradicated in September 20152 and type 3 transmission has 
been interrupted since 20123 – leaving type 1 as the only wild poliovirus still circulating. While the oral vac-
cine is very safe, a small number of individuals (1 in 2.7 million vaccinees4) can suffer from vaccine-associated 
poliovirus paralysis (VAPP). Furthermore, after several rounds of replication in the gut, OPV can revert to a 
neurovirulent phenotype, which can be spread to naïve individuals in the community through faecal contamina-
tion. These events can result in the circulation of vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV), which were responsible 
for 32 cases of poliovirus vaccine associated disease in 20151. Although wild poliovirus type 2 has been eradi-
cated, vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 has been responsible for the majority of cVDPV and sporadic VAPP cases1,5. 
Therefore, in order to achieve a world free of circulating polioviruses, the live attenuated OPV will need to be

replaced with the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). As the first stage in this transition occurred in April 2016 
where there was a synchronised global shift from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (bOPV types 1 and 3). With 
type 2 immunity now being provided by at least one injection of IPV6 incorporated into all routine immunization 
schedules. This shift has put further demand on an already constrained IPV supply7.
To date, a large part of the success of the poliovirus eradication campaign has been due to the relative ease with 
which the vaccine can be administered in mass campaigns. The introduction of IPV poses several challenges to 
the eradication effort, not least because door-to-door campaigns will become more logistically difficult. Needle 
and syringe administration of IM injections will necessitate a campaign based on the efforts of healthcare profes-
sionals with more training than that needed for administration of OPV drops. In addition, as IPV is introduced to 
mass vaccination campaigns, the cost of the vaccine will be a major factor, with a single dose of IPV costing more 
than five times that of OPV8,9. As a result of these factors, there are several investigations are underway to make 
IPV more accessible, by reducing the cost of vaccination, through stretching the already constrained supply of 
IPV through dose-sparing and by increasing ease of administration10,11. These dose sparing approaches include: 
use of adjuvants12, ID injectors13–16, jet injectors17–22 and finally microarray patch (MAP) technologies10,11. The 
use of ID injection using standard ID needle and syringes is also being clinically investigated13 for poliovirus vac-
cination. These fractional dose approaches have a two-fold benefit: the cost per dose should decrease and more 
doses should become available. One form of MAP is the Nanopatch: designed to directly deliver vaccine to the 
skin’s abundant immune cell populations with a high density array, to improve vaccine potency and thereby open 
up significant dose sparing, compared to the needle and syringe23. Demonstrated clinical dose sparing, embodied 
in a practical, low-cost device could allow the Nanopatch to help improve vaccination campaigns in low resource 
regions24, including poliovirus eradication.
Here we examine a microneedle skin patch, the Nanopatch, as a viable alternative to the traditional needle and 
syringe to deliver IPV. The Nanopatch (prototype used in rats) is a 4 ×
 4 mm silicon microarray patch (Fig. 1a), 
containing 10,000 microprojections per cm2 at 230 μ
m in length to which vaccine is dry coated for delivery into 
the skin. The vaccine-coated Nanopatch is applied dynamically using a spring-loaded applicator to the skin25. This 
allows the projections to penetrate through the stratum corneum, depositing vaccine to antigen-presenting cells 
in both the viable epidermis and dermis. Previous studies have shown that localised cell death and inflammation 
associated with the dynamic application, coupled with vaccine delivery, results in improved immune responses as 
compared to traditional needle and syringe approaches26. In exploring the utility of this mode of action, delivery 
of multi-valent vaccines by Nanopatches to mice has generated improved immune responses and dose sparing to 
each strain of split, trivalent influenza vaccines23,24,27, virus-like particle HPV vaccine28, 9-valent subunit conju-
gated vaccine (pneumococcal)29, DNA vaccines (West Nile virus)30 and attenuated live-virus vaccines (adenovirus 
and MVA)31.
Turning to polio, recently we applied Nanopatches to demonstrate the induction of potent neutralising anti-
bodies directed against poliovirus type 2 using monovalent IPV2 vaccine with as little as 0.2 DU (1/40th of a

standard human dose) in the Wistar rat model11. However, the question of whether these benefits extend to triva-
lent poliovirus vaccine in the rat IPV immunogenicity model remains unanswered.
In this study, we extend our monovalent IPV2 studies to Nanopatch delivery of all three monovalent IPVs 
as well as a single Nanopatch application with trivalent IPV in Wistar rats. We show that using the Nanopatch 
enhances the anti-poliovirus antibody responses to all 3 types of poliovirus over that induced by intramuscular 
injection by needle and syringe.
Results
Nanopatch coating and application. 
Based on our previous studies11, we established IPV formulations 
containing either each IPV type individually, or all three poliovirus serotypes in a single formulation. We eval-
uated Nanopatch coating and application by SEM of coated Nanopatches before (Fig. 1b) and after application 
(Fig. 1c), to ensure consistent coating morphology and removal of coated vaccine after application. Nanopatch 
applications were performed as described below, with no serious adverse events noted. Immediately following 
application (n = 10), there was reddening and some petechiae with the greatest effect observed at the edges of the 
patched area (Fig. 1e). This is consistent with previous work26,32, both reporting greater rates of cell death at the 
edges of Nanopatch application sites generated by higher stresses33. During the course of one week, all observable 
local skin reactions following Nanopatch application were resolved (Fig. 1f), with the ear returning to a pre-vac-
cination appearance (as in Fig. 1d).
Triple monovalent IPV immunogenicity study. 
We performed a dose-matched immunogenicity study 
where rats received 3 immunisations with IPV spaced 21 days apart. On each occasion, three Nanopatches were 
applied (one serotype per patch) to each animal or the three monovalent formulations were given by separate 
intramuscular injections. We chose doses based on previous experience with monovalent IPV2 for which 1 and 
0.2 D-antigen units (DU) of IPV2 were delivered, and extrapolated the IPV1 and 3 doses using the same ratios as 
used in the full human IPV doses. Therefore we delivered 5 DU of IPV1, 1 DU of IPV2 and 4 DU of IPV3, which 
corresponds to 1/8th of a human dose. We also tested a low-dose of 1 DU IPV1, 0.2 DU of IPV2 and 0.8 DU of 
IPV3 (1/40th of a human dose). As a positive control, one group of rats received a full human dose (40:8:32 DU 
of types 1, 2, and 3, respectively) by IM injection. To confirm the desired dose of each IPV was deposited into 
the ear of the rats we performed D-antigen ELISAs on the coated formulation remaining on the Nanopatch post 
application. Results are presented in Figure s1a–b demonstrate our ability to deliver approximately 1/8th (IPV1: 
5.9 ± 0.6 DU, IPV2: 1.3 ± 0.25 DU, IPV3: 5.2 ± 0.3 DU) and 1/40th (IPV1: 1.3 ± 0.16 DU, IPV2: 0.17 ± 0.03 DU, 
IPV3: 0.89 ± 0.1) of a full human IPV dose by Nanopatch. Blood samples were collected prior to each vaccination 
for evaluation of poliovirus neutralising antibody titres.
All rats were negative for neutralising antibody (log2 titre < 3) before commencement of the study. Following 
the first vaccination, 40% of animals receiving 5.9 DU of IPV1 seroconverted (log2 titre ≥
 3) with relatively low 
titres; no rats receiving 1.3 DU of IPV1 seroconverted (Figure s2a). However, following the first boost, 100% of 
animals receiving IPV1 by Nanopatch seroconverted, whereas 60% and 80% seroconversion was observed for the 
1.3 and 5.9 DU IM groups, respectively. As compared to their IM counterparts, the Nanopatch groups produced 
higher antibody titres, with 1.3 DU Nanopatch producing a significantly higher (p < 0.05) titre of anti-poliovirus 
1 antibody (Fig. 2a). Following the second boost, all median titres increased again with the Nanopatch groups 
producing more anti-poliovirus 1 antibody as compared to IM injection. Median titres continued to rise with 
each boost, with 1.3 DU by Nanopatch producing significantly higher titres than its IM counterpart. For 5.9 DU 
the Nanopatch appeared to induce higher titres of neutralizing antibody compared to IM injection, albeit not 
statistically significant. Overall, Nanopatch delivery of IPV1 was superior to IM immunization with all animals 
seroconverting with high titres.
The antibody responses to monovalent IPV2 had similar kinetics and titres to results we previously reported11, 
suggesting that co-administration of the other IPV types on different Nanopatches did not result in either posi-
tive or negative immunological interference. Following the first dose, 100% and 80% of animals receiving 1.3 DU 
or 0.17 DU, respectively, by Nanopatch seroconverted, whilst 60% and 80% seroconverted in the equivalent IM 
groups (Figure s1b). Consistent with the IPV1 results, the animals receiving vaccine by Nanopatch had higher 
poliovirus neutralising antibody titres throughout the entire study (Fig. 2b), with each subsequent boost raising 
anti-poliovirus titres. All of Nanopatch animals seroconverted after the 2nd dose.
IPV3 produced the weakest immune response regardless of delivery method. Following the first vaccination 
only 20% and 40% of animals receiving 5.2 DU by Nanopatch or IM, respectively, seroconverted (Figure s2c). No 
animals receiving 0.89 DU seroconverted after the first dose. After the first boost, 100% of animals receiving the 
vaccine via the Nanopatch seroconverted while only 40% and 80% seroconverted following IM immunization 
for the 0.89 or 5.2 DU respectively. After the third dose, all titres continued to increase; however, there was no 
significant difference between the titres induced by IM or Nanopatch delivery at either of the dose levels (Fig. 2c). 
Intriguingly, one of the rats receiving Nanopatch 5.2 DU titre declined below the limit of detection to IPV3 while 
maintaining relatively high titres against IPV 1 and 2.
Trivalent IPV immunogenicity study. 
With ease of application in mind, we then endeavoured to for-
mulate all 3 types of IPV onto a single Nanopatch, to deliver either 5:1:4 or 1:0.2:0.8 DU of IPVs 1, 2 and 3, 
respectively; i.e. 1/8th and 1/40th of the standard human dose. In order to coat the required doses of antigen onto 
a single 4 ×
 4 mm Nanopatch, we concentrated the monovalent bulk vaccine stocks. The 10x bulk vaccine was 
formulated with a cellulose carrier and stabilizing sugars to final concentrations of 1% methylcellulose, 0.75% 
trehalose, 0.75% sucrose and 0.35% mannitol.
To confirm uniform distribution of each vaccine type within the coating formulation, we labelled 
live-attenuated poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 with dylight 647, 550 and 488, respectively, and introduced them to

the concentrated IPV as a tracer. Upon coating, each of the 3 types of poliovirus was visualised uniformly coated 
onto the projections (representative images seen in Fig. 3a–d). Following conformation we had developed a

uniform coating process with consistent dose delivery for both the 1/8th (IPV1: 4.7 ± 0.6 DU, IPV2: 0.8 ± 0.1 DU, 
IPV3: 4.1 ± 1 DU) and 1/40th (IPV1: 1.7 ± 0.25 DU, IPV2: 0.26 ± 0.06, IPV3: 0.7 ± 0.06 DU) Nanopatch groups 
(Figure s1c–d), we proceeded to immunize Wistar rats using the same doses and vaccination schedule as above.
After each vaccination, blood was collected and analysed for the presence of poliovirus neutralising antibody. 
For IPV1, following the first dose of vaccine delivered by the Nanopatch, protective levels of neutralizing anti-
body were seen in 60% of animals while no neutralization was seen in serum of animals receiving the vaccine 
by IM. Upon boosting, all animals receiving vaccine via the Nanopatch had significantly higher (determined by 
one-way ANOVA, alpha level 0.05, with a Sidak post test) poliovirus neutralising titres than their dose-matched 
IM counterparts (Fig. 4a), while seroconversion rates of 20 and 40% were found for the low and high IM doses, 
respectively (Figure s3a). Following the second boost, the median neutralizing titre of each group continued to 
rise, with the low-dose Nanopatch producing significantly (determined by one-way ANOVA, alpha level 0.05, 
with a Sidak post test) higher titres than the dose-matched IM group. Notably, even after three immunizations 
by the IM route, not all animals produced neutralising poliovirus 1 antibodies (40% and 60% for the low- and 
high-dose, respectively). By contrast, after the 3rd dose of Nanopatch-delivered vaccine, even the low-dose group 
showed high median neutralizing antibody titres comparable to, if not slightly higher than that of the high-dose 
Nanopatch group, a trend that was observed in the responses to all three poliovirus types.
All animals vaccinated by Nanopatch seroconverted to type 2 (Figure s3b) after a single dose (both 1/40th 
and 1/8th doses), producing significantly higher antibody titres than IM vaccination (determined by one-way 
ANOVA, alpha level 0.05, with a Sidak post test). With each subsequent boost, the median titres of all the groups 
continued to rise with the Nanopatch groups producing significantly higher neutralising antibody (determined 
by one-way ANOVA, alpha level 0.5, with a Sidak post test) responses than the dose-matched IM groups (Fig. 4b). 
Overall, the findings for IPV2, whether delivered in a monovalent, triple monovalent or trivalent formulation via 
the Nanopatch, showed the induction of potent neutralising antibodies from just a single dose.
Following the first dose, 20 and 40% of animals receiving the low and high dose of vaccine by Nanopatch 
(Figure s3c) seroconverted to poliovirus type 3. Type 3 neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates 
increased with each subsequent dose of vaccine (Fig. 4c). Following the final immunisation, 80% seroconversion 
was seen for the high dose of both Nanopatch and IM groups, while 100% and 60% seroconversion was achieved 
for the low-dose Nanopatch and IM groups, respectively. Consistent with the triple monovalent study, animals 
immunised with the Nanopatch tended to have higher antibody titres when compared to IM immunisation. 
Immunisation with both IPV1 and IPV2 elicit similar poliovirus neutralising titres and seroconversion rates 
when formulated in a single monovalent or trivalent IPV Nanopatch, but the monovalent IPV3 formulation 
resulted in higher overall median titres than when formulated in a trivalent IPV Nanopatch. However, similar 
rates of seroconversion were observed with both formulations.
Discussion
In this study we have demonstrated that IPV of all three poliovirus serotypes can be formulated onto a single 
MAP device, the Nanopatch, and elicit neutralising antibody responses to all three poliovirus strains in rats. 
Furthermore, we demonstrated that there is no difference in response if IPV is delivered in either a monovalent 
or trivalent formulation, suggesting no immune competition. The fractional doses (1/8th and 1/40th) used in this 
study when delivered by Nanopatch gave similar rates of seroconversion and median poliovirus neutralising titres 
to a full human dose delivered by IM injection, and after fewer doses. If the results from these studies translate 
from the rat model to humans, this could significantly reduce the dose required to produce an effective neutral-
ising antibody response.
Several studies by other groups seeking to evaluate dose sparing by skin injection using alternative delivery 
methods have been carried out. It has been demonstrated in a pre-clinical and clinical setting that ID vaccina-
tion using 1/5th of a dose can elicit similar responses as a full human dose delivered by IM injection13–15 and 
is now being used in India and Sri Lanka. Here we set out to improve upon our previous IPV2 monovalent11 
studies by extending Nanopatch immunization to all 3 poliovirus serotypes. We delivered 2 fractional doses of 
IPV via the Nanopatch, at 1/8th or 1/40th of a standard IPV dose, 40:8:32 DU of poliovirus 1, 2, and 3, respec-
tively. These doses were delivered in two formats, either with one IPV type per patch (therefore 3 patches/

measured time point. Reponses to IPV2 were similar to our previously published data, with bridging IPV2 stud-
ies in which 1 DU was given by either one or two Nanopatches demonstrating similar kinetics and titres as pre-
vious experiments11. While the same seroconversion rates and dose-sparing effects were not achieved for types 
1 and 3 as with IPV2, animals vaccinated by the Nanopatch still had overall higher titres, faster anti-poliovirus 
antibody kinetics, and higher seroconversion rates than their IM counterparts. In addition, the relative immu-
nogenicity of the three IPV types was the same regardless of whether they were delivered by Nanopatch or 
IM injection. Furthermore, after the full vaccination course, animals receiving a full human dose IM or by 
Nanopatch had no significant difference in terms of antibody titre or seroconversion rate. Within the triple 
monovalent and trivalent experiments the Nanopatch groups receiving a 1/8th fractional dose showed a faster 
initial induction of anti-IPV antibody responses in comparison to the 1/40th fractional dose. At the comple-
tion of both studies, however, animals achieved similar titres against all IPV types whether receiving the 1/8th 
or 1/40th fractional doses by Nanopatch. We hypothesize that once an initial immune response is established 
against IPV the Nanopatch may provide a booster effect to the pre-existing immune response - possibly through 
a physical immune enhancer effect within the skin’s immune environment by its dynamic application - resulting 
in an overall similar IPV titre being achieved by either fractional dose group. In support of this Soonawala, et 
al. demonstrated that a 1/5th fractional IPV dose delivered I.D. by Pharmajet inject was effective at boosting 
pre-existing polio immunity21. The studies presented here are the first microarray patch studies to demonstrate 
significantly higher antibody titres for poliovirus 1 and 2 from a single trivalent IPV formulation. While IPV3 
did not elicit a significantly higher antibody response when delivered by Nanopatch in comparison to IM, there 
was still significant dose sparing, with 1/40th dose of IPV3 producing similar titres to the full human IPV3 
dose. While the lack of immune enhancement observed in the IPV3 responses is somewhat unexpected given 
the higher immune responses elicited with the Nanopatch for IPV1 and 2, there is precedent for this result. 
Previously, it has been reported that IPV3 produces relatively low responses compared to IPV1 and 2, when 
using fractional doses and/or solid IPV formulations10,34,35. This suggests the IPV3 component of the vaccine 
is possibly (1) less immunogenic than IPV1 and 2, or (2) not in excess. Combined these results suggest there 
maybe a need to optimise the ratio of each IPV component for delivery by the Nanopatch to achieve maximal 
virus neutralising titres in vaccine recipients.
The introduction of IPV as a supplement to OPV in the routine vaccination schedule has presented sev-
eral challenges that the Nanopatch is designed to help address. Firstly, with utility in low resource settings in 
mind22, the Nanopatch is relatively easy to administer and conceptually can be delivered by minimally trained 
individuals, such as community health volunteers, as OPV is delivered now. Furthermore, while not the focus of 
this paper, with new developments in coating methods we have observed enhanced delivery efficiencies beyond 
85%36. Secondly, by uniquely targeting the rich environment of immune cells in the skin (e.g. as discussed in13,14), 
the Nanopatch potentially is only required to deliver a fractional dose of IPV to elicit a comparable rate of sero-
conversion and anti-poliovirus titres as observed for the traditional needle and syringe immunisations by the IM 
route. Effectively translating the results here in rats to humans could thus significantly reduce the cost of vaccina-
tion with IPV, increase the availability of the vaccine and facilitate its administration in door-to-door campaigns.
Materials and Methods
Inactivated poliovirus vaccine formulation. 
Monovalent bulk inactivated poliovirus vaccine types 1 
(1,553 DU/mL), 2 (763 DU/mL) and 3 (912 DU/mL) were supplied by Bilthoven Biologicals, Bilthoven, the 
Netherlands. In order to coat the required dose of IPV in an appropriately small volume, the IPV bulks were 
concentrated 10-fold by using a Centricon (Millipore) 100 kDa filter at 2,500 ×
 g at 4 °C. Final vaccine concen-
tration was determined by D-antigen ELISA to be 15,500 DU/mL, 7,600 DU/mL and 9,100 DU/mL for types 1–3 
respectively.
Nanopatch fabrication and coating. 
Nanopatch microprojection arrays were produced at a 230 
μ
m, 10,000 projections/cm2 density as previously described by Jenkins et al.37 at the Melbourne Centre of 
Nanofabrication. The IPV stocks were mixed into a solution with the final concentration of 1% methylcellulose, 
0.75% sucrose, 0.75% trehalose and 0.35% mannitol under a nitrogen gas jet stream, adapting methodologies 
described38,20.
Determination of delivered dose. 
To determine the vaccine delivered by the Nanopatch into the ear 
of the rat we performed the D-antigen ELISA. The amount of vaccine delivered was determined by applying 
the Nanopatch to the rat ear then eluting the remaining vaccine off the patch in 50 μ
l of PBS and comparing 
that sample to coated unapplied Nanopatches. The D-antigen ELISA was performed as previously described by 
Edens10 with the following changes: IPV3 antibody HYB 300-05-02(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the assay was 
developed as described by Muller et al.11.
Wistar rats. 
Female 6–8 week old Wistar rats were purchased from the Animal Resource Centre, Perth and 
housed in the AIBN animal facility. All methods performed in this study were carried out in accordance with 
National Health & Medical Research Council guidelines and approved by The University of Queensland Animal 
Ethics Committee.
Rat immunisation studies. 
Immunisation studies were based on previously published IPV studies11. 
Wistar rats (n = 5 in each group) were given 3 vaccinations 21 days apart by either Nanopatch or IM injection, 
with blood samples collected (tail tip bleed) one day before each vaccination and 21 days after the final dose. For 
the triple monovalent IPV study, rats received fractional doses of 5:1:4 (1/8th) or 1:0.2:4 DU of poliovirus types 
1–3, respectively, under Ketamine and xylazine sedation. An additional positive control group was included that 
received a full human dose of 40:8:32 DU by IM injection. Three Nanopatches (one for each serotype) were

applied for 2 minutes to the ventral ear pinnae using an applicator at a velocity of 3.1 m/s. IM injections were 
administered to the hind leg. For the trivalent IPV study, the vaccine doses and groups were kept the same as 
the triple monovalent study except the Nanopatches were formulated with all types of IPV delivered by a single 
Nanopatch.
Poliovirus neutralisation assay. 
To evaluate the immune responses to each of the 3 polioviruses following 
vaccination virus neutralising titres were determined at the CDC in Atlanta, GA, USA. Neutralisation assays were 
performed as described by Weldon et al.39.
Fluorescent labelling of poliovirus. 
The labeling of vaccine was done using Dylight Microscale antibody 
labeling kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, the buffers and columns, resin from the 550 kit (Catalogue # 84531)) 
and 50 μ
g vials of Dylight amine-reactive dyes of each colour used according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Briefly, vaccines were prepared by dialyzing 3 ml of each IPV vaccine was against 5 L PBS at 4 °C overnight 
and for 2–4 hours against 2 L PBS the next day in Slide-A-Lyzer G2 Dialysis cassettes (20 K MWCO, Catalogue 
#87735, Thermo Fisher Scientific), then buffer exchanged with 0.05 M borate buffer prepared from the provided 
0.67 M stock using Amicon Ultra-4 ml (Ultracel 30K®) centrifugal filter units (Merck-Millipore, Catalogue 
#UFC803024) at 4000 ×
 g for 5 min, five times.
Prepared vaccine (100 μ
L) was added to the vial of Dylight reagent, vortexed and mixed by gently pipetting 
up and down. Reaction was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. The reaction mixture was 
purified for labeled vaccine using provided columns pre-calibrated with purification resin spun at 1000 ×
 g, with 
labeled vaccine collected in tubes and stored at 4 °C protected from light prior to imaging.
Nanopatch imaging. 
Coated Nanopatches were visualised on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope, using a 
20 ×
 0.8 NA air objective (Zeiss). Dylight 647, 550 and 488 signals were acquired at 5 µm intervals with 1.28 µs 
pixel/dwell and 12-bit depth. All three channels were collected sequentially, using the following settings: red 
633 helium neon laser with a HFT 458/543/633 splitter and filter BP 650–710; blue 488 argon laser with a HFT 
488/KP700 and filter LP505; green 543 helium neon laser with a HFT 488/543 and meta detector set to 553–
692 nm. Image analyses including 3D reconstruction of the images were performed with Imaris software x64 6.3.1 
(Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland).
Statistical analysis. 
Graphpad Prism 7.0a for Mac. Multiple comparison analysis was performed using 
one-way ANOVA with the alpha level set at 0.05 and a Sidak post test to compare dose-matched groups.
