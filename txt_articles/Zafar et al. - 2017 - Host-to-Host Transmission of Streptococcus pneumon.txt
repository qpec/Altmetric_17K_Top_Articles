SUMMARY
Host-to-host transmission is a critical step for infection. Here we studied transmission of the 
opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae in an infant mouse model. Transmission from 
nasally colonized pups required high levels of bacterial shedding in nasal secretions and was 
temporally correlated with, and dependent upon, the acute inflammatory response. Pneumolysin, a 
pore-forming cytotoxin and major virulence determinant, was both necessary and sufficient to 
promote inflammation, which increased shedding and allowed for intralitter transmission. Direct 
contact between pups was not required for transmission indicating the importance of an 
environmental reservoir. An additional in vivo effect of pneumolysin was to enhance bacterial 
survival outside of the host. Our findings provide experimental evidence of a microbial strategy for 
transit to new hosts and explain why an organism expresses a toxin that damages the host upon 
which it depends.

 The requirements for host-to-host transmission of the leading respiratory pathogen Streptococcus 
pneumoniae were examined in an infant mouse model. Shedding of colonizing bacteria by the 
donor animal is increased by inflammation. The bacterial toxin pneumolysin promotes 
inflammation, increases bacterial survival after exit from the host, and is required for transmission.
INTRODUCTION
The mucosal surfaces of the airways are colonized by a complex and extensive flora (de 
Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2015). Many of these species are highly adapted to and reliant on 
their mammalian host. These microbes must overcome two fundamental challenges not 
encountered by organisms inhabiting the gut. Because their niche is not regularly exposed to 
food consumed by their host, they must depend on and compete with their host, as well as 
other resident microbes, for limited and required nutrients (Siegel and Weiser, 2015). 
Extensive investigation into the physiology and metabolism of respiratory tract bacteria has 
defined many of the ways in which respiratory tract colonizers obtain critical nutrients, such 
as iron, from within this environment (Bachman and Weiser, 2015). A further challenge is 
that the healthy host does not regularly expel contents of the airways to allow for the transit 
of microbes from one host to another. Therefore, the process of transmission for inhabitants 
of the respiratory tract is likely to be inherently different and less efficient compared to 
inhabitants of the gut. Although a critical step for organisms that reside within the 
respiratory tract of their obligate host, there is currently minimal understanding of either 
microbial or host factors involved in host-to-host transmission.
A paradigm for our understanding of transmission is the opportunistic pathogen Vibrio 
cholerae. Local production of cholera toxin within the gut lumen stimulates secretions 
causing profuse diarrhea that promotes transmission through direct fecal-oral contact and by 
spread of organisms into the environmental reservoir as another source of contagion (Nelson 
et al., 2009). In contrast, for the leading opportunistic pathogen of the human respiratory 
tract, Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus), person-to-person transmission from

 its niche in the upper respiratory tract (URT) occurs largely from asymptomatic individuals 
(carriers), particularly young children, and is thought to require intimate contact with nasal 
secretions or contaminated surfaces (Hodges et al., 1946; Musher, 2003). Pneumococcal 
transmission is more common in the setting of concurrent respiratory viral infection, 
especially during seasonal or pandemic influenza (Gwaltney et al., 1975; Vu et al., 2011). 
The contribution of influenza to pneumococcal transmission has been modeled in an infant 
mouse model of co-infection, whereby intranasally (IN) inoculated pups become colonized 
and transmit the bacterium to their littermates (Diavatopoulos et al., 2010; Richard et al., 
2014). There are several effects of influenza that contribute to bacterial transmission in this 
model. Viral infection induces inflammation that may render the ‘‘recipient pups’’ more 
susceptible to acquiring the bacteria (Short et al., 2012). Viral inflammation also increases 
the availability of nutrients, such as sialic acid, resulting in greater proliferation of 
colonizing pneumococci (Siegel et al., 2014). The density of colonizing pneumococci is also 
elevated during episodes of viral rhinitis in children (Rodrigues et al., 2013). In the infant 
mouse model, the higher density of colonizing bacteria, together with increased nasal 
secretions triggered by influenza, leads to greater numbers of shed organisms exiting from 
the co-infected ‘‘donor pups’’ (Richard et al., 2014). Analysis of this model suggests that 
very few organisms succeed in transiting from one host to another, and increased shedding in 
the setting of influenza A virus (IAV) allows the pneumococcus to overcome the constraints 
of this tight population bottleneck (Kono et al., 2016).
Pneumococcal colonization of the URT also induces an acute inflammatory response in the 
infected nasal spaces, albeit more mild than during IAV infection, when modeled in mice 
(Kadioglu et al., 2008; Weiser, 2010). Several factors are known to contribute to the host 
response to the pneumococcus. These include the expression of a pore-forming, cholesterol-
dependent cytotoxin (pneumolysin [Ply]) and recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 
chiefly TLR2 (Matthias et al., 2008; Mitchell and Dalziel, 2014; Zhang et al., 2009). 
Pneumococci, like other successful opportunistic bacterial pathogens of the URT, stimulate 
the expression of and modulate the activity of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent 
phospholipid mediator of neutrophil recruitment and function (Hergott et al., 2015). Other 
proposed inflammatory pathways—such as signaling through TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9 and 
the cytotoxity of hydrogen peroxide produced during aerobic growth—are of unknown 
significance during carriage (Albiger et al., 2007; Malley et al., 2003; Rai et al., 2015; 
Spelmink et al., 2016).
We recently described modifications of the infant mouse model that allows for the study of 
pneumococcal transmission during mono-infection (Zafar et al., 2016). Since it remains 
unclear how pneumococci are transmitted in the absence of viral co-infection, in this report, 
we addressed whether pneumo-coccal-induced inflammation is sufficient to promote its 
shedding and transmission. Here we show that inflammation induced by pneumococcal 
colonization, particularly in response to pneumolysin, promotes bacterial shedding that 
allows for transmission between hosts.

 RESULTS
Role of URT Inflammation in Pneumococcal Shedding
Initially, we examined the relationship between pneumococcal shedding and mucosal 
inflammation in the URT. After colonization was established with streptomycin-resistant 
mutant of strain TIGR4 (T4S) in 4-day-old C57/BL6J (wild-type [WT]) mice, daily 
shedding was measured by gently tapping the nares onto an agar surface for quantitative 
culture (Figure 1A). Shedding peaked between days 5 and 7 of age and was followed until it 
began to decline at 9 days of age (Figure 1B). Events greater than ~300 colony-forming 
units (CFUs)/pup were considered a threshold, since in a prior study, intralitter transmission 
from colonized pups was observed only under conditions in which shedding exceeded this 
level (Richard et al., 2014). The gradual decrease in shedding over the 5 days post-challenge 
occurred despite continued robust colonization as assessed by quantitative culture of nasal 
lavages (Figure 1C). Thus, the pattern of shedding following inoculation could not be 
attributed to differences in the density of colonizing organisms. Maximal shedding was 
temporally correlated with acute inflammation as assessed by numbers of neutrophils in 
nasal lavages, which peaked at age 7 days (Figure 1D). The peak inflammatory response was 
also characterized by increased URT expression of chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL2) and 
the proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1β (IL-1β ) that contribute to neutrophil 
recruitment and activity (Figure 1E). Elevated expression of CXCL2 and IL-1β persisted 
through age 9 days. Although heavily diluted in the process of collecting URT lavages, 
increased levels of IL-1β were detectable in colonized pups as measured by a sensitive 
ELISA (Figure 1F).
Having established a correlation between acute inflammation and above-threshold shedding 
events, we examined whether modulation of URT inflammation impacts shedding. Pups 
were treated twice daily with an IN dose of dexamethasone or PBS as vehicle control. 
Overall mean shedding on days of age 5–9, and in particular events >300 CFUs/pup, was 
significantly reduced by dexamethasone treatment (Figure 2A) and was not attributable to an 
effect on colonization density (Figure 2B). The anti-inflammatory effect of dexamethasone 
treatment was confirmed by lack of upregulation of URT expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, 
and IL-1β (Figure 2C). Similarly, in the absence of PAF-mediated inflammation, which was 
tested by comparison of pafr−/−to WT mice, there was also diminished mean shedding 
without a concomitant effect on colonization (Figures 2D and 2E). The diminished 
inflammatory response in colonized pafr−/− mice was confirmed by the lack of increased 
URT expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, or IL-1β compared to mock-infected controls (Figure 
2F).
How Pneumococci Stimulate Inflammation and Shedding
We then examined whether pneumococcal products known to stimulate inflammation are 
involved in increased shedding. Inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils are 
impaired in tlr2−/− mice that are unable to sense and respond to pneumococcal lipoproteins 
(Tomlinson et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2009). In tlr2−/− mice, mean shedding and the number 
of high-shedding events were reduced without an effect on colonization density compared to 
WT controls (Figures 3A and 3B). Without TLR2 signaling, there was no increase in

 neutrophil numbers in nasal lavages or elevated URT expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, and 
IL-1β during early colonization (Figures 3C and 3D).
The effect of the pneumolysin toxin was initially tested by daily IN dosing and compared to 
PBS (vehicle control). In pilot studies, we tested a range of recombinant Ply doses from 20 
to 200 ng/day (Figures S1A and S1B, related to Figure 3). Once daily administration of 100 
ng/pup was sufficient to increase mean shedding above PBS controls (Figure 3E). Ply 
treatment increased numbers of neutrophils in nasal lavages and the expression of CXCL2 
and IL-1β but had no impact on colonization density (Figures 3F–3H). The requirement for 
pore formation by Ply was assessed in experiments using a recombinant toxoid containing a 
W433F mutation affecting conformational changes following membrane insertion (Rossjohn 
et al., 1998). In contrast to the toxin, the same dose of the toxoid (PdB) did not elevate 
shedding, neutrophil recruitment, or expression of chemokines/cytokines. Studies with Ply, 
PdB, and PBS were carried out using a strain carrying an unmarked, in-frame deletion of the 
pneumolysin gene (ply−) to avoid any confounding effects of endogenous toxin expression.
Experiments described above suggest that Ply expression during colonization could 
contribute to inflammation and shedding. During the period of peak shedding (days of age 
5–7), there was a significantly lower proportion of shedding events of >300 CFUs/pup for 
the ply− compared to parent strain (Figure 4A). A strain containing the W433F modification 
in ply leading to expression of a pore-formation-deficient toxin showed reduced shedding. 
Parental levels of shedding were restored when this mutation was corrected with the native 
ply gene (ply+). Reduced shedding of the ply− and plyW433F mutants and its restoration in 
the ply+ strain was not associated with altered colonization density (Figure 4B). Both the ply
− and plyW433F mutants failed to stimulate neutrophil recruitment or increased expression of 
IL-1β unlike the parental strain and corrected mutant (Figures 4C and 4D).
Contribution of Pneumolysin to Pneumococcal Transmission
Next, we determined whether the acute inflammatory response to the products of colonizing 
pneumococci that promote shedding also allowed for pup-to-pup transmission. We had 
previously reported that transmission of strain T4S during mono-infection requires a high 
ratio (~1:1) of ‘‘index’’ pups colonized at day 4 of age to uncolonized ‘‘contact’’ littermates 
(Zafar et al., 2016). Under these experimental conditions, T4S transmission from index to 
contact pups was observed in 28% of pups (Figure 5A). In tlr2−/− pups with diminished 
inflammation and lower average shedding, no transmission events were detected (Figure 
5C). Likewise, in the absence of endogenous expression of Ply (ply− mutant) or in a strain 
expressing a non-pore-forming toxin (plyW433F mutant), there was no detectable 
transmission. Restoration of the deletion with the full ply gene (ply+) allowed for parental 
levels of transmission, confirming the requirement for toxin expression (Figure 5A). The 
increased inflammation and shedding from IN treatment with exogenous Ply to index pups 
was sufficient to allow for transmission of the ply− mutant, whereas no transmission was 
seen from the PBS-treated index pup controls (Figure 5B). These findings demonstrated that 
inflammation induced by its toxin (Ply) is necessary and sufficient to drive pneumococcal 
transmission.

 Our results suggested that conditions in which there is elevated URT inflammation could 
enable transmission in the absence of Ply. This was tested in pups co-infected with IAV at 
age 8 days (Figure 6A). Following viral inoculation, shedding increased and, although 
significantly higher for the T4S compared to the ply− mutant, generally exceeded the 
threshold level for both strains despite similar levels of colonization (Figures 6B and 6C). 
Accordingly, there was no longer a requirement for Ply expression for pneumococcal 
transmission in IAV co-infected pups (Figure 5B).
Pneumolysin toxoids have been evaluated as components of protein-based pneumococcal 
vaccines (Chen et al., 2015; Odutola et al., 2016). Since ~90% of estimated overall efficacy 
of currently licensed pneumococcal vaccine is due to reduced transmission within the 
population (Odutola et al., 2016), we tested whether immunization with PdB could block 
transmission among infant mice. We induced high serum and detectable mucosal IgG titers 
to PdB inpups by systemic immunization of dams prior to delivery (Figure S1C, related to 
Figure 5). There was no reduction, however, in transmission among immune pups (Figure 
5C).
Mechanisms of Pneumolysin-Mediated Transmission
Secretions containing shed pneumococci from an index pup could directly access the nasal 
mucosa of a littermate to establish colonization in a contact pup. Alternatively, organisms 
might be acquired by contact pups from the surface of the dam or via a fomite, such as the 
cage bedding. To test these later possibilities, we kept colonized index pups with different 
dams in separate cages from uncolonized contact pups. These experiments were carried out 
with IAV co-infection because the transmission rate without co-infection was limiting. Three 
times a day, only the pups were switched between cages so that the index and contact pups 
were never in direct contact. The transmission rate exceeded 50%, demonstrating the 
importance of an environmental reservoir for transmission in this model (Figure 6D). 
Switching of the dams, but not the bedding, was sufficient to observe transmission in the 
absence of direct contact with colonized index pups (Figures 6E and 6F).
Since transmission via the surface of the dam requires some period that the organism must 
survive after exiting the nasal mucosa, we tested whether Ply expression in vivo affects 
viability of the pneumococcus when tested ex vivo. Colonizing pneumococci were collected 
from nasal lavages and incubated in PBS at 30° C with viable counts followed over time. 
Viable counts dropped more rapidly over the first hours in lavages obtained from ply− 
colonized, compared to T4S colonized, pups (Figure 7A). Restoration of the native ply gene 
(ply+ strain) increased ex vivo survivability to a level equivalent to T4S, confirming the role 
of Ply expression. In contrast, for pneumococci grown in vitro in nutrient broth, collected, 
and then followed for their viability in PBS, survival was more prolonged, and there was no 
difference between the T4S and ply− strains (Figure 7B). Similarly, daily IN administration 
of Ply (100 ng/dose) increased ex vivo viability significantly more compared to the PBS- or 
PdB-treated controls (Figure 7C).
Finally, we tested whether these differences in ex vivo survival affected the ability of 
pneumococci to establish in the naso-pharynx of a new host. Lavages from T4S or ply− 
colonized pups were diluted in PBS, incubated for 4 hr, and then used to compare the

 infectious dose (ID) needed to colonize 4-day-old pups (Figure 7D). The infectious dose 
(ID50) for ex vivo organisms obtained from T4S or ply− colonized mice was <30 CFUs 
versus >200 CFUs, respectively. Thus, the expression of Ply improved infectivity for 
pneumococci surviving outside the host.
DISCUSSION
The success of the pneumococcus depends on its commensal relationship with its obligate 
human host, since none of the multiple invasive diseases it causes facilitate its transmission 
between individuals (Musher, 2003). Colonization studies in mice have shown that the 
increased inflammation induced by its sole toxin, pneumolysin, accelerates the eventual 
clearance of the organism from its niche on the mucosal surface of the URT (Das et al., 
2014; Matthias et al., 2008; van Rossum et al., 2005). This raises the question of why an 
organism dependent on a commensal lifestyle expresses a toxin that is both damaging to its 
obligate host and promotes its clearance (Weiser, 2010). This report demonstrates the 
importance of Ply, long recognized as one of the major virulence factors of the 
pneumococcus, to its ability to transit between hosts (Kadioglu et al., 2008; Mitchell and 
Dalziel, 2014). We propose that the benefit to the organism of a higher rate of transmission 
compensates for the non-beneficial within-host effects of the toxin.
Our findings suggest that it is the inflammatory response to Ply, through its potent lytic, 
pore-forming function, that mediates its effect on transmission. Although we could not 
quantify secretions directly, our results showed that shedding of the organism to levels 
permissive for transmission is increased by inflammation and that Ply promotes 
inflammation and is both necessary and sufficient for levels of shedding that allow for 
transmission. The effects of Ply were apparent despite the variability of the shedding assay, 
as during pneumococcal mono-infection, non-pore-forming mutants showed fewer high-
shedding events, and during IAV co-infection, mean shedding was lower in the absence of 
Ply. For transmission, Ply expression was a requirement unless complemented by exogenous 
Ply or another source of URT inflammation, such as concurrent IAV infection.
Several aspects of Ply-dependent inflammation merit further comment. Ply is unusual for a 
bacterial toxin because it lacks an N-terminal signal sequence or known secretion 
mechanism, leaving it unclear how it is released from the bacterial cytosol to access its 
mammalian target (Price et al., 2012). We have suggested that the release of Ply occurs 
primarily within professional phagocytes, following bacterial uptake through the degradative 
activity of lysozyme and other components of the phagolysosomes (Davis et al., 2011; 
Lemon and Weiser, 2015). In this manner, toxin release and pore formation from within the 
phagolysosome causes cytosolic access of bacterial products that trigger inflammasome 
activation and eventual pro-inflammatory death of the phagocyte. Thus, the organism may 
utilize the cellular host immune response that is capable of eliminating it as a signal of a 
hostile environment and means of inducing secretions that facilitate its exit and 
establishment in a new more hospitable host.
The nature of specific host pathways that increase URT secretions consisting mostly of fluid 
and mucus in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli remain incompletely understood. In this

 study, we followed the influx of neutrophils and chemokines involved in their recruitment 
since shedding was temporally correlated with the acute inflammatory response. It is 
technically challenging to completely eliminate neutrophils at mucosal surfaces using 
standard depletion protocols and so the requirement for these cells on the effects described 
in this study have not been established. Ply has been shown to be a potent inducer of CXC-
motif chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment in human dendritic cells (Bernatoniene 
et al., 2008). IL-1β , another proinflammatory mediator detected in our study, is secreted 
through activation of the inflammasome, in conjunction with a TLR2-dependent increase in 
its transcription, during colonization in a Ply-dependent manner (Lemon et al., 2015).
Rare pneumococcal isolates express non-hemolytic forms of Ply, while other strains display 
reduced pore-forming activity because of minor sequence variations (Jefferies et al., 2007; 
Lock et al., 1996). Our observations with strain T4S suggest a requirement for Ply and its 
pore-forming activity in transmission. Strains deficient in Ply hemolytic activity may escape 
innate immune surveillance at the expense of a lower transmission rate. Our study depended 
on a model where high levels of shedding are needed to detect transmission from pup to pup 
(Zafar et al., 2016). Transmission rates during natural carriage could be higher or lower, and 
this could reflect the volume or type of secretions the organism induces. Strains that are 
most common because of high rates of transmission might be more likely to cause disease 
since the expression of Ply provides a molecular link between the ability of the organism to 
damage its host and its transmission. The association of microbial virulence and 
transmissibility has been considered previously (Lipsitch and Moxon, 1997).
Our data suggest the possibility of a second role for Ply apart from its enhancement of 
bacterial shedding. Transmission among infant mice did not require direct contact between 
donor and recipient. Switching of the dam between cages was sufficient for cage-to-cage 
spread among pups. Since the dams do not become nasally colonized from the pups, this 
result suggests that the surface of the dam is the source of contagion in this model as 
previously proposed (Diavatopoulos et al., 2010). Pneumococci are known to survive 
desiccation in the environment for substantial periods (Walsh and Camilli, 2011), and it is 
proposed that the organism may be acquired from fomites and that bio-film growth 
characteristics affect how long it remains infectious outside of the host (Marks et al., 2014). 
Although the absence of Ply has previously been linked to inferior in vitro formation of 
biofilm structures, this effect did not involve its hemolytic activity, a characteristic required 
in our report for inflammation and transmission (Shak et al., 2013). Evidence present herein 
suggests that growth on the nutritionally poor mucosal surface of the URT limits the survival 
of secreted organisms. Endogenous or exogenous Ply provided during in vivo growth 
partially rescued this ex vivo survival deficiency. We speculate that the damaging effects of 
host cell lysis from pore formation releases critical nutrients in vivo that reprogram the 
organism to protect it when metabolically stressed in the environment. Minor differences in 
viability outside of the host could have a major impact on the transmission rate, since 
experimental evidence suggests there is a tight population bottleneck for pneumococci in 
passage between hosts (Kono et al., 2016). Findings from our study demonstrate a 
relationship between pneumolysin-dependent ex vivo survival and infectivity.

 Despite its critical role in the life cycle of infectious agents, there is little understanding of 
microbial factors involved in transmission, especially for organisms residing in the 
respiratory tract. This gap in knowledge is largely a consequence of a lack of tractable 
models to study transmission. Our study took advantage of a model that recapitulates many 
of the key features of pneumococcal transmission, including higher rates among infants, 
increase by concurrent IAV, and requirement for close contact (Zafar et al., 2016). Our report 
details the contributions of a specific bacterial factor in respiratory transmission. 
Considering the importance of transmission to the infectious life cycle, it is likely there will 
be other mediators of transmission expressed by the pneumococcus as well as by other 
respiratory pathogens. These could be attractive targets of prevention since interfering with 
this key step would greatly amplify the effectiveness of vaccination. We were, however, 
unable to block transmission by generating antibody to pneumolysoid in pups via maternal 
immunization in this study. This could be because the important toxin-mediated events occur 
inside host cells where they are shielded from the immune response. Alternatively, maternal 
immunization may have failed because of insufficient levels of mucosal immunity in their 
offspring. In fact, there may already be a precedent for blocking transmission through 
immunization with a toxoid. A retrospective epidemiologic analysis of diphtheria toxoid 
concluded that the dramatic decline in disease incidence from immunization must be due to 
herd immunity through a reduction in host-to-host transmission (Chen et al., 1985).
In summary, Ply has two effects that each could impact transmission success. Ply 
contributed to the numbers of bacteria shed in secretions—an effect that correlated with the 
potent local inflammatory effect of the toxin. Additionally, the activity of Ply in vivo 
enhanced survival of the pneumococcus outside of the host. Both the effects on 
dissemination and viability of the organism could increase its chances of accessing and 
establishing in a new host.

Matthias et al., 2008). To construct the corrected mutant (ply+), we obtained the PCR 
product using genomic DNA from T4S as template. The genotype of each construct was 
confirmed via PCR/sequencing. The pore-forming phenotype of each construct was 
confirmed with a horse erythrocyte lysis assay (Lemon and Weiser, 2015). Hemolysis of the 
ply minus; and plyW433F mutants was <1% of strain T4S.
Shedding and Colonization in Infant Mice
C57BL/6J mice or congenic knockout mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory or 
were previously described and bred and maintained in a conventional animal facility 
(Hergott et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2009). The pups were housed with a dam (mother) for the 
duration of the experiment and gained weight similar to uninfected animals.
4-day-old pups were given an IN inoculation without anesthesia containing ~2,000 CFUs of 
S. pneumoniae (Sp) suspended in 3 μL of PBS as described previously (Richard et al., 
2014). Shedding was quantified by gently tapping the nares (20 taps/pup) on TS agar plate 
supplemented with streptomycin (200 μg/mL) to prevent the growth of contaminants and 
spreading the secretions over the agar surface with a sterile cotton-tipped swab. To measure 
colonization density, we euthanized pups at the age indicated by CO2 asphyxiation followed 
by cardiac puncture. The upper respiratory tract was lavaged with 200 μL of sterile PBS 
from a needle inserted into the trachea, and fluid was collected from the nares. The limit of 
detection in lavages was 33 CFUs/mL unless otherwise noted.
Where indicated, pups within a litter were treated IN with 20 ng of dexamethasone 21-
phosphate disodium salt (Sigma) or PBS (vehicle control) twice daily in a 3 μL volume 
beginning at age 3 days. Pups were colonized with T4S at age 4 days and shedding 
measured each day beginning at age 5 days immediately prior to the first daily dose.
In other experiments, strain ply minus; colonized pups were treated with purified Ply or its 
toxoid (PdB) administered IN (20–200 ng/3 μL) once daily to half the pups in a litter with 
the remaining pups receiving PBS (3 μL). Shedding was collected from days 5 to 9 of life 
prior to the daily treatment.
To determine the effect of IAV, we inoculated colonized pups at age 8 days IN with IAV/
HKx31 strain (2 × 104 TCID50) suspended in 3 μL of PBS as previously described (Richard 
et al., 2014).
Transmission in Infant Mice
The transmission model for mono- and IAV co-infection was described in previous studies 
(Richard et al., 2014; Zafar et al., 2016). Briefly, half the pups in the litter were randomly 
selected and, at age day 4, infected with the strain indicated. These index mice were then 
returned to the dam and the other uninfected pups (contact mice). To detect bacterial

 transmission from the index to contact pups, we euthanized all pups at age 14 days and 
cultured nasal lavages. For transmission experiment with IAV co-infection, at 8 days of age, 
all pups in the litter were inoculated IN with IAV virus/HKx31 strain as described above. All 
the pups were euthanized at age 14 days to determine the rate of transmission. Where 
indicated, index pups infected with strain ply minus; were given a daily IN dose of Ply (100 
ng/3 μL) or PBS (vehicle control) beginning at age 4 days until sacrifice at age 14 days. Pilot 
experiments established no transmission from colonized pups to the URT of dams.
For cage-switch transmission experiments, pups were randomly divided into index and 
contact groups and kept in two separate cages with their dam. At age 4 days, index pups 
were infected with T4S as described above. At age 8 days, pups of both index and contact 
groups were then infected with IAV. From days 9 to 13, both the pups and dam, the dam 
only, or the pups only were switched between the two cages 2–3 times per day so that index 
and contact mice never had direct contact but shared only the cage bedding, only dam, or 
both the cage bedding and the dam. Transmission rate was determined by quantifying 
colonization in pups sacrificed at age 14 days as described above.
qRT-PCR
The URT of pups was lavaged using RLT lysis buffer (QIAGEN) to obtain RNA from the 
epithelium. Total RNA and cDNA generation was carried out as previously described 
(Lemon et al., 2015). qRT-PCR reactions were performed with Power SYBR Green Master 
Mix (Applied Biosystems) using 10 ng cDNA and 0.5 μM primers per reaction. Samples 
were run in duplicate, and each experiment run was repeated. Samples were run on a 
StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primers directed toward gapDH 
were used as an internal control. RNA expression was quantified using the ΔΔCT method. 
Primers used in this study were previously described (Lemon et al., 2015; Siegel et al., 
2015).
Flow Cytometry
To quantify neutrophils, we pelleted nasal lavage samples from individual pups at 500 × g 
for 5 min and resuspended them in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). 
Samples were blocked with a 1:200 dilution of a rat anti-mouse CD16/32 (clone 93; 
BioLegend). Cells were stained for 30 min at 4° C with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies 
(diluted 1:150) against the following surface markers: CD11b-V450 (BD), Ly6G-peridinin 
chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-Cy5.5 (BD), and CD45-allophycocyanin (APC)-Cy7 (BD). 
Samples were run on BD LSR II flow cytometer and analyzed with BD FACSDiva software.
Protein Purification and Immunization
Purification and activity of recombinant pneumolysin (Ply) and its toxoid (PdB) containing 
the W433F point mutation were carried out as previously described (Gelber et al., 2008; 
Lemon et al., 2015). Proteins were stored at −20° C with 50% (w/v) glycerol to maintain 
biological activity.
4-week-old female C57BL6J mice were immunized via subcutaneous injection of purified 
PdB protein (10 μg) using Freud’s adjuvant. Mice in control group received PBS and

 adjuvant. Mice were immunized three times at an interval of 14 days. 1 week after third 
immunization, serum samples were collected from tail vein to measure anti-PdB IgG titers 
by ELISA. Immunity in pups born to immunized dams was determined by ELISA on serum 
obtained at time of sacrifice by cardiac puncture.
ELISA
Purified PdB protein was diluted at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL in PBS and used to coat 
Immulon 1B 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following overnight incubation at 4° 
C and washing with PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), the plates were blocked for 1 hr at 
37° C with 1% BSA in PBS. Serially diluted serum samples in PBS containing 1% BSA 
were applied to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37° C for 2 hr. Subsequently, the 
wells were washed, 100 μL of AP-conjugated secondary antibody goat-anti-mouse IgG 
(1:4,000 diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA) was applied to each well, and the plate was 
incubated at 37° C for 1.5 hr. The wells were then washed and secondary antibody 
quantified using pNPP substrate (Sigma).
To quantify Interleukin-1β (IL-1β ) levels in nasal lavages, we used a mouse ELISA kit 
(Abcam) in accordance with manufacturer’s directions. The limit of detection was 2.7 
pg/mL.
Ex Vivo Viability and Infectivity Assays
Nasal lavages (PBS, 200 μL/pup), obtained at age 9 days from pups colonized with the strain 
indicated at age 4 days, were serially diluted 10-fold in PBS and plated to determine the 
starting CFU. The time course of viability was assayed using microtiter plates with serial 
dilutions with PBS of the nasal lavage incubated at 30° C, and every 30 min aliquots were 
plated on selective media to determine survival relative to T = 0. For other ex vivo viability 
assays, lavages were obtained from pups treated IN with Ply or PdB (100 ng/day) or PBS 
vehicle control. To compare viability in TS broth, we grew the strain indicated until reaching 
an OD620 = 1.0. Pneumococci were then pelleted, serially diluted in PBS, and incubated at 
30° C to follow viability over time as described above. To compare infectivity of ex vivo 
pneumococci, we diluted lavages to the desired density in PBS and incubated for 4 hr at 30° 
C. 3 μL aliquots were used to inoculate IN 4-day-old pups, and colonization density was 
assessed in lavages at age 6 days.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad). Unless 
otherwise specified, differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test 
(comparing two groups) or the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-analysis (comparing 
multiple groups).

 Figure 5. Pneumolysin Increases Host-to-Host Transmission
(A) At age 4 days, half the pups in a litter were colonized with the strain indicated (index 
pups, I) and the other half left uncolonized (contact pups, C). At age 14 days, nasal lavages 
were obtained to quantify colonization density with each pup, and median values are shown. 
Intralitter transmission is shown by acquisition of the strain by contact pups.
(B) Index pups colonized with the ply− strain were treated daily from age 4 days with either 
purified Ply (100 ng/dose) or PBS-vehicle control. For IAV co-infection, both index and 
contact pups were infected with strain x31 at age 8 days.
(C) Summary of transmission data for the strain indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the 
pups were C57/Bl6 (WT). The p value was calculated using the Fisher’s exact test. * in 
comparison to ply− without IAV. ns, non-significant.

 Figure 6. Experiments with IAV Co-infection Showing Increased Shedding with Pneumolysin 
Expression and the Route of Pup-to-Pup Transmission
(A) WT pups were colonized at age 4 days with the T4S or ply− strain and at age 8 days co-
infected IN with IAV virus strain x31.
(B) Daily shedding was quantified in secretions from ages 9 to 14 days from nasal secretions 
with median values indicated and each symbol representing the CFU observed from a single 
pup on a single day. Dashed line represents the 300 CFU threshold level described in the 
Results. *p < 0.05.
(C) Colonization density in URT lavages obtained with the median value shown.
(D–F) WT index pups in one cage were colonized at age 4 days with T4S. At age 8 days, 
both index pups and contact pups (housed in a separate cage) were inoculated with IAV. 
Colonization was measured in cultures of nasal lavages at age 14 days after index and 
contact pups were switched between cages 2–3 times/day (D), cages containing the bedding 
material were switched 3 times/day (E), or the dams only were switched between cages (F). 
Horizontal line indicates limit of detection.

 Figure 7. Pneumolysin Expression Promotes Bacterial Survival and Infectivity outside of the 
Host
(A–C) To compare ex vivo survival, we incubated pneumococci in PBS and viable counts 
determined at the times indicated. Prior to incubation in PBS, bacteria were obtained from 
nasal lavages obtained at age 9 days from mice colonized at age 4 days with the strain 
indicated (A), broth culture in nutrient medium (B), or nasal lavages at age 9 days from mice 
colonized at age 4 days with ply− and then treated daily with an IN dose of Ply or PdB (100 
ng/day) or PBS control (C). Statistical comparisons are to the group(s) without pneumolysin. 
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
(D) Nasal lavages obtained from T4S or ply− colonized mice were diluted to the desired 
density in PBS and incubated for 4 hr at 30° C. Aliquots then used to compare the infectious 
dose by IN inoculation of 4-day-old pups. Colonization density at age 6 days is shown 
relative to the inoculum size.
