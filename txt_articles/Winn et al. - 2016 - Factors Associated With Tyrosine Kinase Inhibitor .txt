Purpose
There is substantial concern surrounding affordability of orally administered anticancer therapies,
particularly for Medicare beneficiaries. We examined rates of initiation and adherence to tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) among Medicare beneficiaries with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with and
without cost-sharing subsidies. We selected TKIs given their effectiveness and strong indication for
use among patients diagnosed with CML.
Patients and Methods
Using SEER-Medicare data, we identified individuals diagnosed with CML from 2007 to 2011. We used
Cox proportional hazards regression to assess time from diagnosis to TKI initiation. We used generalized
estimating equations to examine treatment initiation within 180 days and TKI adherence among ini-
tiators. We defined adherence as at least 80% of days covered during the 6 months after TKI initiation.
Results
Among 393individuals diagnosed withCMLfrom 2007to 2011, 68% initiatedTKItreatment within 180days
after diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, individuals with cost-sharing subsidies, younger age, lower com-
orbidity, and later year of diagnosis were significantly more likely to initiate TKIs. Among TKI initiators, 61%
were adherent; adherence was lower for individuals age 80 years or older versus 66 to 69 years.
Conclusion
Only 68% of Medicare beneficiaries with CML initiated TKI therapy within 6 months of diagnosis.
Delayed initiation among individuals without cost-sharing subsidies suggests that out-of-pocket
costs may be a barrier to timely initiation of therapy among individuals diagnosed with CML.

INTRODUCTION
There has been a dramatic increase in the number
of orally administered oncology treatments in
recent years.1,2 With this transition away from
office-based infusions, it is important to identify
potential gaps in adherence to therapies, because
the risks for primary nonadherence (never filling)
and secondary nonadherence (discontinuing or
using less supply than expected) increase when
patients are obtaining drugs outside of the in-
fusion center. There is a broad literature doc-
umenting nonadherence to medications across
many conditions, including some cancers.3-5 How-
ever, most prior work examining medication ad-
herence among patients with cancer has examined
use of relatively affordable treatments, such as en-
docrine therapy,6 or use among privately insured
individuals with relatively generous prescription
drug coverage.7-9 Furthermore, because of the lim-
itations of available data, most population-based
studies of medication adherence have evaluated
use among patients who had initiated therapy and
have not considered factors associated with never
starting therapy. Given the expense of newer oral
oncologic treatments (most of which are priced
at $ $10,000 per month), out-of-pocket costs for
initiating therapy may be high and could act as
a barrier to starting treatment.10
In the United States, nearly all adults older
than age 65 years qualify for enrollment in Medi-
care, the national insurance program. On reaching
Medicare eligibility, beneficiaries are enrolled in
hospital coverage at no charge, and they have the
option to purchase coverage for outpatient medical
and prescription drug benefits separately. Recent

 work has demonstrated that individuals insured through the Medicare
drug benefit program (ie, Part D) may face out-of-pocket costs of
nearly $3,000 when initiating tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),10,11
which potentially limits access to treatments.12,13 This high
upfront cost is a result of the Medicare Part D benefit design,
which requires patients to pay a higher proportion of medication
costs until they reach a catastrophic spending threshold ($4,850
out of pocket in 2016), after which patients pay 5% of the ap-
proximate $11,000 monthly drug costs, or $550. Studying pa-
tients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) can provide insight
into the impact of expected out-of-pocket spending on use of oral
anticancer medications among individuals insured through Medi-
care prescription drug plans. Specifically, the average age at di-
agnosis of CML is 64 years (Medicare eligibility begins at age
65 years), TKIs are highly recommended for individuals with
Philadelphia chromosome–positive disease (nearly all of CML di-
agnoses), and individuals using these therapies are expected to take
them for a long period of time. In addition, clinical guidelines
recommend initiating a TKI immediately after a diagnosis of
CML.14,15 Finally, low adherence to TKI therapy can decrease
response to treatment, which can result in patients requiring stem-
cell transplantation, worse clinical outcomes, and potentially
shorter life expectancy.16
The objectives of this study were to estimate rates of TKI
initiation among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with CML
between 2007 and 2011 and to evaluate factors associated with
initiation of and adherence to TKIs. Given the critical role of TKIs
for patients with CML, it is important to understand whether cost
sharing or other patient- or provider-level factors act as a barrier
to treatment use.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Sample and Data Sources
We used SEER-Medicare linked data for this study. The SEER-
Medicare data combine data obtained from cancer registries covering
28% of the US population and Medicare administrative claims for patients
age older than 65 years who are included in the registry and enrolled in
traditional (ie, fee-for-service) Medicare plans.17,18 The linked data source
broadly represents the health care experiences of older adults in the United
States who are diagnosed with incident cancers and who are insured
through traditional fee-for-service Medicare plans. Importantly, claims for
individuals enrolled in Medicare health maintenance organizations are
available (approximately 30% of Medicare beneficiaries in the United
States as of 2015).19
We identified individuals age 66 years or older with a diagnosis of
Philadelphia chromosome–positive CML (International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology [third edition] code 9863 or 9875) from 2007 through
2011 who were continuously enrolled in Medicare inpatient and outpatient
medical coverage for 1 year before diagnosis (N = 405). We excluded in-
dividuals who were not continuously enrolled in a prescription drug plan
(Part D) after diagnosis through death or through 1 year after initiation of
treatment or who had missing values for geographic factors (census tract
poverty level and urbanicity; n = 12), resulting in a cohort of 393 patients
(cohort 1; Fig 1) for the analysis focused on time to TKI initiation. For
evaluating any use of a TKI within 180 days after diagnosis we further
restricted our sample to individuals alive during the full 180-day follow-up
period (n = 296; cohort 2; Fig 1). Finally, for examining adherence to TKIs,
we restricted analysis to individuals who ever initiated a TKI and were alive
for 180 days after their first TKI fill (n = 202; cohort 3; Fig 1).
TKI Initiation
We identified TKIs available for treating CML during our study
period: imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. We evaluated treatment initi-
ation in two ways. First, we evaluated rates of and time to TKI initiation
after CML diagnosis (diagnosis date was estimated as the first day of the
month of diagnosis) among the full cohort, treating death as a competing
risk. Second, we evaluated initiation within 180 days of diagnosis among
those who survived for at least 180 days after diagnosis to avoid including
individuals who may have been close to death and thus were less likely to
benefit from therapy.
TKI Adherence
Among individuals who initiated TKIs, we used the days of supply
and dispensing date to create a supply diary for whether a person had
prescription drug supply available during each day of follow-up. Because
patients may switch from one TKI to another if they are intolerant to one
TKI, all TKIs were treated as interchangeable, so if a person had over-
lapping supply of more than one TKI (eg, he or she filled a prescription for
nilotinib before exhausting his or her supply of imatinib), then use of the
second medication was assumed to start the day after the end of the prior
fill. We summarized the proportion of days covered (PDC) by dividing the
number of days covered during the 180-day period after TKI initiation by
180 days. Individuals were considered adherent if their PDC was greater
than 80%.
Covariates
Covariates included age at diagnosis, marital status, race, comorbidity
(measured during the year before diagnosis using the Klabunde adaptation
of the Charlson comorbidity index20), year of diagnosis, poverty level
(based on census tract of residence from US Census data), and urbanicity.
Individuals were classified as receiving cost-sharing subsidies if they were
eligible for both Medicaid (US health insurance program for low-income
individuals) and Medicare or if they had a low-income subsidy for
Medicare Part D drug costs, either of which would result in significantly
lower out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries. Because out-of-pocket ex-
penses for drugs were similar for both groups, we combined these groups
and identified them as receiving cost-sharing subsidies. Variables were
categorized as listed in Table 1.

 Statistical Analysis
Time to initiation of TKIs. To determine factors associated with TKI
initiation, we tested unadjusted differences using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.
Our adjusted analysis used multivariable Cox proportional hazards re-
gression and allowed for competing risks resulting from death. From these
models, we present adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with bootstrap-estimated
95% CIs.
Treatment initiation and adherence. Among the patients who sur-
vived for 180 days or longer, we estimated the risk of not initiating
treatment within 180 days of diagnosis. We also estimated the risk of being
nonadherent to therapy among the subset of patients who initiated
treatment. For both models, we used generalized estimating equations with
log links, Poisson distributions, and robust SEs,21,22 and we included all
covariates listed in Covariates section. Adjusted risk ratios (RRs) with
bootstrapped 95% CIs were estimated from each model. Statistical sig-
nificance was assumed as P less than .05. The study protocol was con-
sidered exempt by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review
Board.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the 393 individuals included in our cohort are
listed in Table 1. The mean age at diagnosis was 77 years (standard
deviation, 7.6), with more than 40% of the population being older
than age 80 years. The majority of the population was white (85%),
and 47% were married. Approximately 40% of individuals were
classified as receiving cost-sharing subsidies.
The unadjusted time to TKI initiation within 180 days after
diagnosis is presented in Figure 2. The median time to initiation
among initiators was 75 days. Factors associated with earlier
treatment initiation were receipt of cost-sharing subsidies (HR,
1.35; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.84), being diagnosed in more recent years
(HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.22), and living in a big metropolitan
area (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.00 to 3.78) or metropolitan area (HR,
1.84; 95% CI, 1.02 to 3.89) compared with an urban area. Those
with higher levels of comorbidity (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.89)
and those age older than 80 versus younger than 70 years (HR,
0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.72) experienced later initiation of TKIs
(Table 2). Analyses were repeated among the cohort of patients
who lived through 180 days after diagnosis, and results were
consistent with the primary analysis (Appendix Table A1, online
only).
Because of the difference observed between those who did and
did not receive cost-sharing subsidies, we examined the unadjusted
difference in time to initiation of TKIs (Fig 3). We found the
median time to initiation of treatment after CML diagnosis was
58 days among individuals who received cost-sharing subsidies
and 108 days among beneficiaries who did not receive cost-sharing
subsidies (P = .04).
Initiation of TKIs Within 180 Days
Overall, 68.2% of patients with newly diagnosed CML initi-
ated TKI therapy within 180 days after diagnosis. When restricting
to patients who were alive during the full 180-day follow-up
period, we found that year of diagnosis (adjusted RR, 1.06; 95%
CI, 1.00 to 1.11) and living in a large metropolitan area versus an
urban area were associated with increased use of TKIs (adjusted
RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.49), and age older than 80 years
compared with younger than age 70 years was associated with
a reduced use of TKIs (adjusted RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.85;
Table 2). When looking at use at 180 days, in contrast with the
time-to-event analysis, the effect of cost-sharing subsidies on TKI
initiation was not statistically significant (adjusted RR, 1.08; 95%
CI, 0.92 to 1.27).
TKI Adherence
Among individuals who ever initiated TKIs, 61% were ad-
herent (PDC . 80%) to therapy during the first 180 days post–TKI
initiation. When examining factors associated with adherence,
individuals age older than 80 years compared with those younger
than age 70 years (adjusted RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.94) were
less likely to adhere to therapy, and year of diagnosis was asso-
ciated with higher adherence (adjusted RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01 to
1.13; Table 2). No other patient factors were associated with
adherence.

TKI Use and Adherence Among Medicare Beneficiaries With CML
 DISCUSSION
Medicare beneficiaries’ use of TKIs was far lower than expected,
with approximately 30% of patients with newly diagnosed CML not
initiating treatment within 6 months of diagnosis. Low-income
beneficiaries who received cost-sharing subsidies for prescription
drugs seemed to initiate treatment sooner than Medicare beneficiaries
without cost-sharing subsidies. However, when restricting to those
patients who lived for at least 180 days after diagnosis, there was no
longer a statistically significant difference between individuals with
and without copay subsidies for the probability of staring a TKI or in
adherence among those who had initiated TKI treatment. Further-
more, we found that individuals diagnosed who were older than age
80 years (. 40% of the cohort) were less likely to initiate treatment
and were less adherent to treatments.
During the study period of 2007 to 2011, there were three US
Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments for CML
(imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib). Imatinib was the only TKI
approved for first-line use between 2007 and 2010, with the other
TKIs approved for first-line use starting in 2010. Although these
newer products were more expensive than imatinib at the time
they were approved, estimated out-of-pocket spending for 1 year
of therapy for patients using one of these drugs long term in 2010
would have been similarly high across products, ranging from
$9,062 to $10,083.10 Furthermore, in multivariable adjusted
models, we found that the time to TKI initiation was faster
and adherence was higher across more recent years of our
study, suggesting that changes in recommendations for first-
line treatment over time did not negatively affect use of TKIs.
Prior work evaluating older patients’ ability to manage high
health care costs has shown that roughly half of the elderly
population has $13,800 or less in liquid assets available, and this

 amount decreases as patients age.23 Assuming a list price of $10,000
for a standard dose or supply of drug, Medicare beneficiaries without
cost-sharing subsidies are expected to pay close to $3,000 to initiate
their first month of therapy with a TKI and $550 for their remaining
fills over 1 calendar year once they reach the catastrophic phase of
their plan benefit (with 5% coinsurance for each fill after that point).
It is possible that patients without prescription drug cost-sharing
subsidies may delay initiating treatment as they work to obtain funds
to cover these high upfront costs.10,24 Additionally, these individuals
may also delay treatment initiation in the hope of receiving financial
assistance from a patient assistance program or foundation. This
may explain the longer time to initiation among individuals who
were not receiving cost-sharing subsides. Specifically, differences in
initiation between patients with and without cost-sharing subsidies
were largest in the early postdiagnosis period and narrowed over
time (Fig 3). Our findings are consistent with recent work that has
also found low overall use of TKIs within the Medicare population
and more generally that prescriptions with copays more than $500
are four times as likely to never be picked up from a pharmacy when
compared with oral oncologics with lower copays.25
This study has several limitations. First, we compared TKI use
and adherence among patients with and without cost-sharing sub-
sidies. Historically, individuals with cost-sharing subsidies have had
lower rates of initiation of therapy and similar or lower adherence to
medications than individuals without such support.26-28 This may
understate our findings, resulting in a conservative estimate of the
impact of cost sharing in this setting. Additionally, we were unable to
determine reasons for delaying or not initiating treatments, nor were
we able to account for physician or patient preferences regarding use
of TKIs. However, there are few, if any, clinical reasons for patients to
delay initiation, and guidelines encourage a trial of TKIs among all
individuals with CML. Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that
there would be differences between patients’ need for therapy on the
basis of their eligibility for cost-sharing assistance. Nevertheless,
additional studies that collect information from patients and physi-
cians will be important to understand barriers to initiation. Another
limitation of this study is our reliance on International Classification
of Diseases for Oncology (third edition) codes to identify patients with
Philadelphia chromosome–positive CML. However, because nearly all
CML cases are associated with the Philadelphia chromosome,29,30 this
limitation is unlikely to have affected our findings. There are no
validation studies that have empirically tested if this code completely
captures all cases. Another limitation of this study is that less than 1%
of patients who did not receive cost-sharing subsidies had low ex-
pected out-of-pocket spending at the time of initiating TKI therapy,
and thus, we were unable to assess whether the relatively lower ex-
pected spending among this group led to higher TKI initiation rates.
Furthermore, we were not able to discern if patients were receiving
free samples, which may have delayed their observed start date. Fi-
nally, we were limited by the small number of individuals who were
newly diagnosed with CML during our time period and by the large
proportion of patients diagnosed at older ages ($ 80 years) and who
died within the study period. Although the SEER registries capture all
incident cancers in areas covering 28% of the US population, we were
limited to studying older adults who were insured by the fee-for-
service Medicare program and enrolled in a Medicare prescription
drug benefit plan. Although our cohort was relatively large for an
incident CML cohort, we had relatively low power for some analyses.
With the recent loss of patent protection for imatinib (2016),
there is anticipation that generic entry will result in lower prices.
Recent research has suggested that in the United States, the price of
specialty oral cancer drugs typically falls by roughly 50% to 75%
after generic entry (price reductions of approximately 75% have
been estimated for imatinib in the Canadian market).31-33 If prices
for generic imatinib fall by 75% from the branded product price to
approximately $2,500 per month, patients will still face high out-
of-pocket spending of at least $125 per month, which may con-
tinue to inhibit access to TKIs.7 Even in light of imatinib losing
patent protection, we believe our general finding that high cost
sharing may result in delays in initiation of these life-saving
medications remains valid for this and other cancers for which
orally administered drugs are recommended.
In summary, we found that approximately 40% of older adults
with CML did not initiate TKIs within 180 days after their di-
agnosis. Furthermore, we found that individuals with cost-sharing
subsidies initiated TKIs sooner than those without cost-sharing
subsidies; however, among TKI users, adherence was similar be-
tween these groups. Our findings highlight important gaps in TKI
use among Medicare beneficiaries with CML and suggest that high
cost sharing may result in delays in initiation of these life-saving
medications.
