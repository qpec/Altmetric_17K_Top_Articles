Activation of heat shock response (HSR) improves accumulated visceral adiposity and metabolic 
abnormalities in type 2 diabetes. To identify the optimal intervention strategy of the activation of the 
HSR provided by mild electrical stimulation (MES) with heat shock (HS) in type 2 diabetes. This study 
was a prospective, frequency-escalating, randomized, open-label, triple-arm trial in Japan. A total of 
60 obese type 2 diabetes patients were randomized into three groups receiving two, four, or seven 
treatments per week for 12 weeks. No adverse events were identified. MES + HS treatment (when 
all three groups were combined), significantly improved visceral adiposity, glycemic control, insulin 
resistance, systemic inflammation, renal function, hepatic steatosis and lipid profile compared to 
baseline. The reduction in HbA1c was significantly greater among those treated four times per week 
(−0.36%) or seven times per week (−0.65%) than among those treated two times per week (−0.10%). 
The relative HbA1c levels in seven times per week group was significantly decreased when adjusted by 
two times per week group (−0.55%. p = 0.001). This research provides the positive impact of MES + HS 
to treat obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The pandemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus has negative health impacts worldwide, and is associated with the sig-
nificant expansion of obesity, which is particularly characterized by increased visceral adiposity with chronic 
systemic inflammation. As anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy usually becomes insufficient to control glucose 
metabolism against the progression of insulin resistance and β 
-cell failure, many patients require additional 
interventions such as multiple oral drugs and/or injection therapies1, which do not reverse the fundamental 
pathophysiology of diabetes.
One underlying mechanism supporting the development of type 2 diabetes among obese individuals and the 
worsening of glucose control is the attenuation of the heat shock response (HSR), which is closely associated with 
heat shock protein (HSP) 72 expression. HSP72 acts as an anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and cell-protective 
molecule2 and the regulation of HSP72 expression is tightly related to insulin signaling3. Chronic systemic inflam-
mation caused by visceral adiposity promotes insulin resistance. The impaired insulin signaling in turn reduces 
the cytoplasmic abundance of HSP72, resulting in damage to the pancreatic β 
-cells and further attenuation of 
insulin signaling4.
Adding to HSP72 levels with various modalities, including mild electrical stimulation (MES) plus heat 
shock (HS), improved visceral adiposity, glucose homeostasis, and chronic systemic inflammation5–9. We have 
conducted a preliminary intervention study using MES + 
 HS for subjects with metabolic syndrome or obese 
type 2 diabetes, and identified that this method activates the HSR and improved visceral adipose mass, glucose

homeostasis, and inflammatory surrogate markers including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
 and C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP)6, which are quite similar to the effects observed in diabetic animal models treated with MES + HS7,9.
In this manuscript, we investigate the optimal clinical applications of this MES + HS treatment for obese sub-
jects with type 2 diabetes to bring this intervention into clinical settings.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the obese type 2 diabetes patients. 
Demographic characteristics, 
including concomitant medications, adiposity, blood pressure, glucose control, systemic inflammation, renal 
function, and hepatic steatosis, were not significantly different among the three treatment groups (Table 1). No 
serious adverse effects or hypoglycemia over the 12 weeks of intervention were found.
Primary endpoints: the amount of visceral adiposity, glucose control, and insulin resistance. 
 
Effects of MES + HS over time compared with the baseline. From randomly selected 6 subjects, HSP72 expres-
sion after the treatment was increased approximately 1.5 times in isolated monocytes compared to before the 
treatment (Fig. 1. lower right panels) Table 2. This indicates that the activation of HSR was similar levels in our 
previous study6.
Adiposity. The visceral fat area (VFA), measured by computed tomography scan, decreased by 11.69 cm2 (from 
166.12 ± 
 7.75 to 154.44 ± 
 6.76 cm2; p < 
 0.001) following MES + 
 HS treatment compared with the baseline value, 
while the subcutaneous fat area (SFA) was not changed (from 207.11 ± 
 11.95 to 204.04 ± 
 12.14 cm2; − 
3.07 cm2; 
p = 
 0.205). As a result, the total fat area decreased significantly by 14.75 cm2 following MES + 
 HS treatment. Body 
mass index (BMI: from 29.14 ± 
 0.56 to 28.88 ± 
 0.58 kg/m2; − 
0.25 kg/m2; p = 
 0.001) and waist circumference (Wc: 
from 100.10 ± 1.33 to 97.86 ± 1.23; − 
2.24 cm. p < 0.001) both also decreased.
Glucose control and insulin resistance. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) reduced from 159.38 ± 
 5.30 to 144.45 
± 
 4.21 mg/dL (− 
14.93 mg/dL, p < 
 0.001). Fasting immune-reactive insulin also decreased, from 9.77 ± 
 0.74 to 
7.91 ± 
 0.59 μ 
IU/mL (− 
1.86 μ 
IU/mL, p < 
 0.001). Hence, HOMA-IR improved from 4.08 ± 
 0.42 to 2.99 ± 
 0.29 
(− 
1.09, p < 
 0.001). HbA1c declined from 7.64 ± 
 0.08% to 7.28 ± 
 0.08% (− 
0.36 ± 
 0.07%, p < 
 0.001) and glycated 
 
albumin (GA) also dropped from 19.15 ± 
 0.41 to 18.40 ± 
 0.39% (− 
0.75%, p = 
 0.004). As a result, the clini-
cal target of HbA1c less than 7.0% was achieved by 38.3% (n = 
 23) of participants after MES + 
 HS treatment. 
Adiponectin increased from 7.54 ± 
 0.47 to 8.47 ± 
 0.54 μ 
g/mL (+ 
0.93 μ 
g/mL, p < 
 0.001). Furthermore, multiple 
regression analysis indicated that the decrease of VFA was significantly correlated with the amount of VFA before 
the treatment (r = 
 0.565, p < 
 0.001) and the reduction of HbA1c was significantly correlated with baseline HbA1c 
(r = 0.485, p = 0.002).
Effects of MES + HS depending on treatment frequency. MES + HS treatment does not have appropriate placebo 
control because this apparatus transmits heat and electric stimulation simultaneously, and these different fre-
quencies of intervention may be necessary to identify the exact clinical effects of MES + HS (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
Adiposity. VFA was compared among two, four, and seven treatments per week, and the amplitude of reduction 
was − 
5.37, − 
14.24, and − 
16.45 cm2, respectively (Fig. 1). The trend of VFA decreases in seven treatments per 
week group was observed compared with that in two treatments per week group (p = 0.054). This trend was also 
observed in four treatments per week group compared with the two treatments per week (p = 0.071). There were 
no significant differences between the four and seven treatments per week groups. The changes in Wc showed 
similar trends, but SFA did not.
Glucose control and insulin resistance. FPG indicated a trend toward decreasing in the seven treatments per 
week group compared with that in the two treatments per week group (− 
8.32 vs. − 
20.47 mg/dL, p = 
 0.093. 
Fig. 1). HOMA-IR showed a significant decline in the four treatments per week group compared with that in the 
two treatments per week group (p = 
 0.043). Reductions in HbA1c following MES + 
 HS in two, four, and seven 
treatments per week were − 
0.10 ± 
 0.11%, − 
0.36% ± 
 0.12 and − 
0.65% ± 
 0.10, respectively (Fig. 1). The decrease 
of HbA1c in the seven treatments per week group was significantly greater than that in the two or four treatments 
per week group (2 vs. 7, p = 
 0.001; 4 vs. 7, p = 
 0.036). GA showed a similar trend in reduction, but did not reach 
a significant difference. Adiponectin levels were increased over time in all groups, but were not different among 
the three groups.
Effects of MES + HS in sex differences. Adiposity. VFA significantly decreased from 177.28 ± 
 10.25 to 161.72 
± 
 8.87 cm2 (− 
15.55 cm2, p < 
 0.001, n = 
 48) in male but not female participants (− 
2.66 cm2, p = 
 0.262, n = 
 22). The 
amplitude of VFA reduction was significantly larger in male than in female participants (p = 0.017). SFA showed 
a trend toward reduction in female participants (− 
10.59 cm2, p = 
 0.068), but not in male participants (+ 
0.16 cm2, 
p = 
 0.485). BMI (− 
0.30 kg/m2, p = 
 0.003) and Wc (− 
2.67 cm, p < 
 0.001) were both decreased only in men, but the 
sex differences were not obvious (Table 4).
Glucose control and insulin resistance. FPG (from 167.50 ± 
 6.86 to 145.31 ± 
 5.27 mg/dL, − 
22.19 mg/dL, 
p < 
 0.001) and HOMA-IR (from 4.23 ± 
 0.56 to 2.92 ± 
 0.37, − 
1.31, p < 
 0.001) both significantly improved only 
in males. The sex difference in FPG was significant (p < 
 0.001). HbA1c showed a minor trend toward reduc-
tion in female participants (Δ 
 = 
 − 
0.17 ± 
 0.15%, p = 
 0.140) and a significant decrease in male participants 
 
(Δ 
 = 
 − 
0.44 ± 
 0.07%, p < 
 0.001). The difference in the reduction of HbA1c was obvious (p = 
 0.033). GA indicated

a similar change of + 
0.12% (p = 
 0.384) in female and − 
1.12% (p < 
 0.001) in male participants, and the difference 
was significant (p = 0.017). However, the level of adiponectin increased both in female (+ 
1.07 μ 
g/mL; p = 0.011) 
and male participants (+ 
0.87 μ 
g/mL; p < 0.001).
Secondary outcomes: blood pressure, systemic inflammation, renal function, hepatic steatosis, and lipids. 
 
Effects of MES + HS over time compared with baseline. Systemic inflammation. Tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α 
 levels in serum decreased from 1.64 ± 
 0.11 to 1.24 ± 
 0.08 pg/mL (− 
0.40 pg/mL; p < 0.001). Interleukin 
(IL)-6 was not changed significantly (from 3.17 ± 
 0.29 to 2.78 ± 0.31 pg/mL, − 
0.44 pg/mL; p = 0.105). C-reactive 
protein (CRP) decreased from 1968.77 ± 
 442.90 to 1305.17 ± 
 246.04 ng/mL (− 
663.60 ng/mL; p = 
 0.008) and the 
counts of white blood cells (WBC) also decreased from 6751.67 ± 
 204.86 to 6315.00 ± 
 183.01/μ 
L (− 
436.67/μ

Renal function. 
The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was elevated from 76.52 ± 
 2.23 to 
79.48 ± 
 2.35 mL/min/1.73 m2 (+ 
2.96 mL/min/1.73 m2; p < 
 0.001). Renal albumin excretion, estimated by urinary 
albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) was reduced from 75.30 ± 
 20.87 to 56.47 ± 
 15.82 mg/g Cre (− 
18.73 mg/g Cre; 
p = 0.015). Oxidative stress marker in renal tubules, evaluated by liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), 
was decreased from 5.42 ± 0.53 to 4.38 ± 0.49 μ 
g/g Cre (− 
1.04 μ 
g/g Cre; p = 0.007) as well.
Hepatic steatosis and lipids. The AST/ALT ratio increased from 0.86 ± 
 0.03 to 0.92 ± 
 0.04 (+ 
0.06; p = 
 0.007). 
Uric acid (UA) slightly, but significantly, decreased from 5.58 ± 
 0.19 to 5.43 ± 
 0.18 mg/dL (− 
0.15 mg/dL; 
p = 
 0.042). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) showed a trend toward reduction (from 109.30 ± 
 3.54 
to 105.80 ± 
 3.45 mg/dL, − 
3.50 mg/dL, p = 
 0.055). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and free fatty 
acid (FFA) were not changed by MES + 
 HS treatment. Triglyceride (TG) levels were significantly reduced from 
183.40 ± 18.75 to 153.38 ± 12.46 mg/dL (− 
30.02 mg/dL; p = 0.015).
Effects of MES + HS depending on frequency of treatment. Blood pressure. A decrease in diastolic blood pres-
sure (DBP) but not systolic (SBP) was observed in the seven treatments per week compared with that in the two 
or four treatments per week group (p = 0.050 and 0.033, respectively. Figure 1) (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
Systemic inflammation. Although chronic inflammatory markers such as TNF-α 
, IL-6, CRP, and the WBC 
count decreased over time in all intervention groups, the differences among groups were not statistically signif-
icant (Fig. 1).
Renal function. eGFR was elevated and ACR and L-FABP were decreased in every intervention group, but a 
significant difference was observed only in L-FABP in the seven treatments per week group compared with that 
of two treatments per week group (p = 0.046 Fig. 1).

Hepatic steatosis and lipids. Almost all markers of hepatic steatosis (AST/ALT ratio), UA, and lipid profiles 
showed favorable trends of changes in all groups. Significant reductions in LDL-C were observed in the seven 
treatments per week compared with that in the two treatments per week group (p = 0.028. Fig. 1).
Effects of MES + HS in sex differences. Blood pressure. The decreases in SBP (− 
4.38 mmHg; p = 
 0.012) and 
DBP (− 
2.74 mmHg; p = 
 0.006) were observed only in male participants, and the sex differences were statisti-
cally significant (p = 
 0.030 and p = 
 0.029, respectively). Heart rates were also reduced only in male participants 
(− 
2.31 beats/min; p = 0.044) (Table 4).
Systemic inflammation. Although TNF-α 
 decreased in both female (− 
0.36 pg/mL; p = 
 0.020) and male par-
ticipants (− 
0.42 pg/mL; p < 
 0.001), IL-6 (− 
0.87 pg/mL; p < 
 0.001), CRP (− 
907.26 ng/mL; p = 
 0.001), and WBC 
(− 
478.57/μ 
L; p < 
 0.001) were reduced only in males. The sex difference in reduction of IL-6 was significant 
(p = 0.008).
Renal function. eGFR (+ 
2.33 mL/min/1.73 m2 in women, p = 
 0.034; + 
2.66 mL/min/1.73 m2 in men, p = 
 0.001) 
and L-FABP (− 
0.97 μ 
g/g Cre in women, p = 
 0.025; − 
1.06 μ 
g/g Cre in men, p = 
 0.032) were ameliorated in female 
as well as male participants. A sex difference was not observed.
Hepatic steatosis and lipids. Amelioration of the AST/ALT ratio (+ 
0.07; p = 
 0.019), UA (− 
0.18 mg/dL; p = 
 0.043), 
HDL-C (+ 
2.14 mg/dL; p = 
 0.037), TG (− 
22.07 mg/dL; p = 
 0.036), and free fatty acid (FFA: − 
70.40 μ 
Eq/L; 
 
p = 
 0.038) was observed only in male participants. Significant sex differences were observed in the increases of 
HDL-C (p = 0.011).

Sub-analysis with or without DPP-4 inhibitors. In most cases, the favorable changes in biophysical and biochem-
ical parameters were not influenced by concomitant anti-diabetic medications. However, FPG was significantly 
reduced from 162.16 ± 
 6.96 to 142.29 ± 
 5.41 mg/dL (− 
19.87 mg/dL; p < 
 0.001) in subjects prescribed with DPP-4 
inhibitors, but only a trend in those without DPP-4 inhibitors (− 
6.41 mg/dL; p = 
 0.082). The reduction in FPG 
was significantly greater in subjects with DPP-4 inhibitors than those in without DPP-4 inhibitors (p = 
 0.030). 
A significant difference was observed in the decrease of L-FABP (− 
1.56 μ 
g/g Cre; p = 
 0.049 vs. without DPP-4 
inhibitors) and in the increase of the AST/ALT ratio (+ 
0.09; p = 
 0.031 vs. without DPP-4 inhibitors) in subjects 
with DPP-4 inhibitors (Supplementary Table 3).
Discussion
For patients who are obese and have type 2 diabetes, a therapeutic strategy to modify the progression of the dis-
ease and complications beyond the control of glucose levels may provide additional long-term health benefits. The 
preferable metabolic effects of MES + 
 HS treatment in obese patients with type 2 diabetes were regulated by the 
frequency of intervention. In particular, the effect on HbA1c levels was clearly intervention frequency dependent 
(− 
0.10%, − 
0.36%, and − 
0.65%, respectively). Another primary endpoint, VFA also showed a trend in reduc-
tion depending on the treatment frequency (− 
5.37 cm2, − 
14.24 cm2, and − 
16.45 cm2, respectively). Although 
MES + 
 HS treatment cannot set a precise placebo control, these frequency-dependent favorable results indicate 
that MES + HS correctly functions to improve metabolic abnormalities in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.
Reductions in adiposity. 
Visceral obesity is considered to be harmful to health as compared with sub-
cutaneous fat, it is most commonly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality10. Compared with 
baseline, MES + 
 HS reproduced specific reductions in visceral adiposity in obese type 2 diabetes as observed in 
the results of a preliminary crossover intervention6.
HSP72 induction increases lipolysis rates and activates oxidative enzymes, such as citrate synthase (CS) and 
β 
-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) in liver as well as muscle11. Hyperthermia at 42 °C increases mito-
chondrial oxidative capacity with increased CS activity and cytochrome c oxidase activity in rat skeletal muscle12. 
It is also reported that HSP72 induction increases AMPK activation6. As AMPK knockdown increased fat mass 
and exacerbates the inflammatory phenotype13, activation of AMPK by MES + 
 HS may reduce visceral adiposity. 
Indeed, lipid accumulation in C. elegans was attenuated by MES alone through liver kinase B1-AMPK signaling 
activation14. These lines of evidence suggest that HSP72 stimulates fat oxidation, resulting in reduced fat storage 
and adiposity. Indeed, whole body knockout of HSP72 mice exhibit obesity, insulin resistance, and marked lipid 
accumulation in skeletal muscle15.
The reason for preferential decreases in visceral fat versus subcutaneous fat by MES + 
 HS treatment may be 
explained by the nature of those fat tissues. Using lifestyle modification interventions, obese men have signifi-
cantly greater reductions in visceral fat mass16. Aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce visceral adipose mass 
in obesity, independent of weight loss. As activation of HSR by MES + 
 HS stimulates similar pathways on exer-
cise—such as activation of AMPK, sirt1, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ 
 coactivator-1α 
17 —this 
may explain the similar results of MES + HS treatment in preferential reductions in visceral fat.
Greater improvements in men: sex differences. 
In the present study, improvements in metabolic 
parameters and body composition were mostly greater in male than in female participants. Although most male 
participants in this study presented a slight VFA dominant obesity (VFA/SFA = 
 50.1%), female patients exhibited 
far more SFA dominant (VFA/SFA = 29.8%). The distribution pattern of the accumulated fat may explain the sex 
differences. Another possibility would be a sex difference in basal HSP72 expression, which is higher in women 
than in men18. Hence, the activation of HSR may not fully influence the metabolic advantages in women. In 
addition, heat treatment activates androgen effects especially in lipid peroxidation in men6. These hypotheses of 
sex differences have to be elucidated in the near future. Of note, the reduction in HbA1c in male participants was 
0.44% (n = 
 42) in the present study. Our previous report showed comparable decreases of HbA1c (0.43%) in male 
participants (n = 40)6, suggesting that MES + HS treatment reproduced reliable effects in glucose control in male 
subjects with type 2 diabetes.
Amelioration of glucose control, inflammation, and insulin resistance. 
The major reason for the 
amelioration of glucose homeostasis using this intervention is the attenuation of insulin resistance, which is 
tightly associated with chronic systemic inflammation. Obese type 2 diabetes patients develop visceral obesity 
with insulin resistance mainly because of inflammatory cytokine production by activation of c-jun N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κ 
B). These molecules interfere with insulin signaling, resulting in 
inactivating downstream targets such as glucose transporter (GLUT) 4 and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β 
. 
GSK3β 
 is a key molecule to activate heat shock factor (HSF)-1, which is a transcription factor for HSP72. HSP72 
is a significant inhibitor of cytokine production by attenuating stress molecule JNK via multiple aspects19, such 
as direct association between HSP72 and JNK20, blocking upstream kinase signal-regulated kinase 120, suppres-
sion of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 1/721, and enhancement of ubiquitin ligase C-terminus 
of Hsc70 interacting protein mediated dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase 1 ubiquitination22 and activation of 
MAPK phosphatase 1/323.
Another important inflammatory activator is NF-κ 
B, which is a transcription factor for CRP and TNF-α 
. 
 
We observed decreased expression and fewer nuclear localization of NF-κ 
B in monocytes extracted from 
MES + HS treated type 2 diabetes patients compared with those before the treatment6. The decreased expression 
of NF-κ 
B may be the result of reduced TNF-α 
 expression because these two molecules positively regulate each 
other. Moreover, NF-κ 
B nuclear translocation by metabolic stress is regulated by activation of Iκ 
B-kinase (IKK)

and phosphorylation of NF-κ 
 light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor α 
( 
Iκ 
Bα) 
, which are negatively 
regulated by HSP7224. When MES + HS treatment is performed, cytoplasmic HSP72 levels are increased and act 
as an inhibitor of JNK and NF-κ 
B signals, resulting in the attenuation of cytokine production, thereby improving 
insulin resistance. In addition, activation of AMPK by MES14 may directly activate GLUT4 translocation inde-
pendent of insulin signaling. To note, the reduction in visceral adiposity is not correlated with the decrease in 
HbA1c, glucose levels or HOMA-IR, indicating that MES + 
 HS treatment may directly attenuate the inflamma-
tory signaling cascade to improve glucose homeostasis.
Improvement in blood pressure, renal function, hepatic steatosis, and lipid profile. 
Systolic 
blood pressure showed a small but significant decrease in MES + 
 HS treatment. This observation is supported that 
heat shock has been observed to improve blood pressure in primates25. Glucose normalization, as well as attenua-
tion of inflammation, is an important intervention for diabetic nephropathy. We found that MES + HS treatment 
has a protective role for renal function in a mouse model of Alport syndrome by attenuation of inflammatory 
cytokine expression26. In a diabetic mouse model and in humans, we observed significant reductions in inflam-
matory signaling and urinary albumin excretion by MES + 
 HS treatment6,7. These results indicate that MES + 
 HS 
intervention has renal protective effects in addition to glucose control. MES + 
 HS therapy also improves surrogate 
markers of hepatic steatosis and lipid profiles in this study. HSP72 may function to activate fatty acid oxidation 
as a result of activation of CS and β 
-HAD in liver and muscle, thereby reducing hepatic steatosis. AMPK acti-
vation and mitochondrial activation may also contribute to improved hepatic lipid accumulation. Additional 
effects of MES + HS with current DPP-4 inhibitor treatment are observed in FPG, L-FABP, and hepatic steatosis. 
DPP-4 inhibitors exert anti-inflammatory effect and anti-accumulation of hepatic lipids in mice27, suggesting that 
MES + HS treatment may enhance the benefits of DPP-4 inhibitors.
The limitation of this study is relatively small sample size and no setting of appropriate placebo control because 
this apparatus simultaneously delivers heat and mild electric stimulation, both of which are easily recognized by 
subjects. To overcome these problems, we are planning to design a larger clinical trail containing appropriate 
placebo setting of this MES + 
 HS. Despite the lack of placebo control, two times treatment frequency could be 
used for the adjustment of the results in seven times per week of MES + HS treatment. As in Table 3, HbA1c was 
significantly decreased when adjusted by two times per week group (− 
0.55%. p = 
 0.001), indicating MES + 
 HS 
did indeed improve glucose control in obese type 2 diabetes.
In summary, this research provides additional evidence to support the positive impacts of MES + 
 HS treat-
ment in improving metabolic outcomes in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. As most of these patients were 
already treated with anti-diabetic medications including DPP-4 inhibitors, patients who did not reach the gly-
cemic control goal of HbA1c 7.0% could be offered additional personalized medical care including MES + 
 HS 
treatment.
Methods
Study participants. 
A total of 63 obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (43 men and 20 women) were 
recruited at six Japanese hospitals (online only material). Obesity with type 2 diabetes was defined as a waist 
circumference (Wc) > 
85 cm in men and > 
90 cm in women, with HbA1c levels from 7.0% to 9.3%. Participants 
ranged in age from 40 to 74 years and had been receiving stable medication(s) for at least 3 months. Exclusion 
criteria were shown in online only material (Supplementaly Table 1).
The study protocol complied with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed 
consent was obtained from each subject. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Kumamoto 
University (Ethics No. 794). The trial was registered with an approved ICMJE clinical trial registry, UMIN (ID: 
UMIN 000016309) and the date of registration is Jan.23/2015.
MES + HS treatment. 
The devices (BioMetronome® 
) for producing MES + HS were provided by Tsuchiya 
Rubber Co. Ltd. (Kumamoto, Japan). The description of the MES + 
 HS device has been provided previously6. 
Briefly, MES + 
 HS produces electrical stimulation of 1.4 ± 
 0.1 V/cm. The pads were positioned on the front and 
back of the abdomen and delivered 55 pulses per second, 0.1 msec duration with 42 °C heat. The padded area 
was 15 cm in length × 
 25 cm in width. MES + HS treatment was taken place at each subject’s home, and complete 
adherence were confirmed by logs that the subjects were instructed to fill out when they treated.
Randomization and masking. 
Sixty-two eligible type 2 diabetes subjects were randomly assigned using 
computer-generated random numbers into three groups by block randomization. Finally, a total 60 subjects com-
pleted the study and were analyzed. All subjects or investigators were masked to treatment allocation at the time 
of enrollment.
Study design and clinical protocol. 
This study was a prospective, randomized, open-label, triple-arm 
trial. The final 60 participants were randomly assigned into 12-week intervention period of MES + 
 HS twice 
(n = 
 22), four times (n = 
 19) or seven times (n = 
 19) per week for 60 min per single treatment. Exercise and diet 
alterations were prohibited during the entire period. At 0 and 12 weeks, body compositions, abdominal adiposity, 
and metabolic and biochemical examinations were investigated.
The primary endpoints were the amount of visceral adiposity measured as described below, glucose control 
assessed by HbA1c, and insulin resistance estimated by HOMA-IR. Other outcomes include blood pressure, 
systemic inflammation, renal function, hepatic steatosis, and lipids. For the primary outcome, we estimated the 
need to enroll 54 subjects to detect changes in the visceral fat area of 15% with MES + 
 HS as compared with no

treatment, with statistical power of 80%, allowing for a type I (α 
) error of 0.05. Allowing for a loss to follow-up 
rate of 10%, 60 subjects were required to undergo randomization.
Monocytes isolation and analysis. 
To investigate the HSP72 expression in monocyte from T2DM sub-
jects, 6 subjects were randomly selected. Before and after 12 weeks of MET treatment (seven times per week 
group), blood samples were collected during fasted state. First, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were 
isolated using BD VacutainerTM CPTTM (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Monocytes were subsequently isolated from 
the PBMCs magnetically by depletion technique (Miltenyl Biotech. Auburn. CA). Western blot was performed to 
confirm the expression levels of HSP72 as described in elsewhere6.
Statistical analysis. 
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). All 
values were expressed as means ± 
 standard error of the mean. The treatment effects of MES + 
 HS were ana-
lyzed using a paired t-test or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Multiple comparisons were performed using one-way 
ANOVA. Two-sided p-values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.
