Deciphering cell-intrinsic mechanisms of metastasis progression in vivo is essential to
identify novel therapeutic approaches. Here we elucidate cell-intrinsic drivers of metastatic
prostate cancer progression through analyses of genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMM) and correlative studies of human prostate cancer. Expression profiling of lineage-
marked cells from mouse primary tumors and metastases defines a signature of de novo
metastatic progression. Cross-species master regulator analyses comparing this mouse
signature with a comparable human signature identifies conserved drivers of metastatic
progression with demonstrable clinical and functional relevance. In particular, nuclear receptor
binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2) is robustly expressed in lethal prostate cancer in
humans, while its silencing inhibits metastasis of mouse allografts in vivo. We propose that
cross-species analysis can elucidate mechanisms of metastasis progression, thus providing
potential additional therapeutic opportunities for treatment of lethal prostate cancer.

etastasis is a complex process that culminates in the
progressive accumulation of molecular alterations of
cancer cells, which allow them to escape the confines of
the tumor, survive during dissemination, and ultimately reside at
distant sites, wherein requisite adaptive changes ensue in their
new microenvironment1,2. Therefore, it would be most infor-
mative to study the biological processes and molecular mechan-
isms underlying metastatic progression as occur in the context of
the whole organism in vivo. However, inherent challenges in
accessing primary tumors and their metastases from cancer
patients have made it difficult to study de novo metastasis for-
mation. Moreover, most in vivo studies of metastasis have utilized
transplantation models wherein cells or tumors are implanted
into host organisms, usually immune-deficient ones. While such
investigations have advanced our understanding of metastasis
mechanisms and have elucidated factors that promote organ
tropism3, they may not ideally model the cell-intrinsic mechan-
isms of de novo metastatic progression. Analyses of genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) can overcome these obsta-
cles, since they enable access to tumors and their resultant
metastases as they arise de novo during cancer progression in the
whole organism4–7.
Virtually all prostate cancer deaths are due to metastasis, which
arises at advanced disease stages and is often resistant to treat-
ment. Indeed, while patients with locally confined disease have
highly favorable outcomes (>95%), the 5-year survival for meta-
static prostate cancer is less than 30%8. Standard treatment for
advanced prostate cancer involves androgen deprivation therapy,
which is initially effective but ultimately leads to disease recur-
rence in the form of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC),
which is highly aggressive and prone to metastasis9–12. While
second generation anti-androgens, such as enzalutamide and
abiraterone acetate, are now being used for treatment of
CRPC10,11, treatment failure is often associated with progression
to even more aggressive subtypes, including neuroendocrine
prostate cancer (NEPC)12–15. Frequent sites of prostate cancer
metastasis are bone and lymph nodes, however, visceral metas-
tasis, such as to lungs and liver, are becoming more prevalent in
aggressive variants and associated with increased lethality and
poor prognosis16.
Several recent studies have identified the landscape of recurrent
genomic alterations in prostate tumors and metastases17–30. The
culmination of these analyses has revealed that metastatic pros-
tate cancer has a significantly higher burden of mutational and
somatic
copy
number
alterations
compared
with
primary
tumors20,21,25,27–30. These include increased frequency of altera-
tions of key oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes such as AR,
PTEN, TP53, and RB1, and aberrant activation of key signaling
pathways such as the PI-3 kinase, FGF receptor, and RAS sig-
naling pathways5,31,32. However, functional analyses of causal
drivers of metastatic prostate cancer progression have been hin-
dered by the lack of experimental models that enable biological
and molecular investigations of de novo metastasis in context of
the whole organism.
In the current study, we have investigated metastatic progres-
sion in vivo in a GEMM of prostate cancer. Employing lineage
tracing to isolate tumor and metastatic cells, we have defined a
molecular signature of metastasis progression. Cross-species
computational analyses comparing this mouse signature with a
comparable human signature of metastatic prostate cancer pro-
gression have identified conserved master regulators of metastasis
progression that drive these processes. In particular, we have
identified NSD2 as a conserved master regulator of metastatic
prostate cancer progression and a robust marker of lethal prostate
tumors. Our findings suggest that cross-species investigations
based on analyses of de novo metastasis in GEMMs can be
broadly used to elucidate mechanisms of metastatic progression
and identify potential new therapeutic opportunities for treat-
ment of lethal cancer.
Results
A molecular signature of de novo metastasis progression. To
elucidate mechanisms of metastasis progression, we utilized a
previously described GEMM of highly penetrant metastatic
prostate cancer based on an inducible Cre (CreERT2) expressed
under the control of the promoter of the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene5.
This Nkx3.1CreERT2 allele drives Cre-mediated recombination in
an appropriate cell of origin of prostate cancer33,34 while simul-
taneously resulting in heterozygosity for Nkx3.1, which is pre-
valent
in
human
prostate
cancer17,27.
We
crossed
the
Nkx3.1CreERT2 allele with a Pten floxed allele (Ptenflox/flox) and an
activatable mutant K-Ras allele (KrasLSL-G12D/+) to generate NPK
mice (for Nkx3.1CreERT2; Ptenflox/flox; KrasLSL-G12D/+). Tumor
induction of these NPK mice leads to co-activation of PI3K and
RAS signaling, as frequently occurs in lethal prostate cancer in
human5,32, while these mice develop metastasis with 100%
penetrance5. These NPK mice also contain a conditionally acti-
vatable fluorescent reporter allele, R26RYFP, which enables in vivo
lineage tracing of primary tumors and their resultant metastases
with high efficiency and specificity (Fig. 1a)5.
To identify a molecular signature of metastatic progression, we
compared expression profiles of primary tumors and metastases
from NPK mice. Since these mice exhibit temporal progression
from pre-invasive (~1 month), to invasive prostate cancer
(~3 months), and ultimately to metastasis (~5 months)5, we
analyzed expression profiles of primary tumors from mice prior
to the occurrence of overt metastasis (pre-metastatic, <3 months,
n = 8), as well as primary tumors from mice that had developed
overt metastases (post-metastatic, ~5 months, n = 8). Further,
since these NPK mice metastasize primarily to soft tissues,
including lung, liver, and lymph node5, we analyzed metastases
from these various sites (n = 8, 5, 7, respectively); however, since
lung is the most prevalent metastatic site5, we focused our
molecular analyses primarily on lung. As controls, we performed
comparable analyses using non-metastatic primary tumors from
NP mice (for Nkx3.1CreERT2; Ptenflox/flox; n = 7)35.
To focus on cell-intrinsic molecular features of primary tumor
and metastatic cells free of the surrounding stromal or other
components of the microenvironment, which are likely to differ
for each tissue, we isolated YFP-lineage-traced cells from tumors
and metastases using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)
(Fig. 1b). We then performed RNA sequencing on the purified
YFP-labeled cells to generate expression profiles corresponding to
pre- or post-metastatic primary tumors (n = 8/group) as well as
lung, liver, and lymph node metastases (n = 8, 5, 7, respectively;
Supplementary Data 1).
Interestingly, we found that the expression profiles of the pre-
and post-metastatic primary tumor cells were highly dissimilar,
whereas expression profiles from the post-metastatic primary
tumors were very similar to those from lung, liver, and lymph
node metastases (Supplementary Data 1; Fig. 2, Supplementary
Fig. 1). Specifically, unsupervised principal component analysis
(PCA) revealed that expression profiles from the post-metastatic
NPK primary tumors clustered more closely with the lung
metastases, as well as the metastases to other sites, and further
from the pre-metastatic tumors from these NPK mice, whereas
the pre-metastatic NPK tumors tended to cluster more closely
with non-metastatic NP primary tumors (Fig. 2a; Supplementary
Fig. 1a). This relationship was further confirmed by gene set
enrichment analyses (GSEA) wherein a differential expression
signature comparing post- versus pre-metastatic primary tumors

 was significantly enriched with a signature of lung metastases
versus pre-metastatic tumors in both the positive (NES = 19.64, p
< 0.001) and negative (NES = −7.52, p < 0.001) leading edges
(Fig. 2b). Moreover, expression signatures from the other
metastatic sites, namely lung, liver and lymph nodes, were also
highly enriched relative to each other (Supplementary Fig. 1b–d),
providing further evidence of their similarity.
These observations suggest that the most prominent cell-
intrinsic
molecular
changes
that
occur
during
metastatic
progression in the NPK mice are those that distinguish pre-
metastatic from post-metastatic tumors. Hence, taking into
consideration: (1) the distinct molecular changes between pre-
and post-metastatic NPK tumors; (2) the overall similarity of gene
signatures of metastatic cells at the various tissue sites (i.e., lung,
liver and lymph node); and (3) that the lung is the major
metastatic site in the NPK mice, our subsequent analyses was
done using a signature of metastasis progression based on the
differentially expressed genes between the pre-metastatic tumors
and lung metastases (n = 8/group, respectively; two-sample two-
tailed Welch t-test; Supplementary Data 1).
Notably, this mouse metastasis progression signature shares
molecular features that have been associated with the hallmarks
of
metastasis
progression
in
other
cancer
contexts1,2.
In
particular, differentially expressed genes from the positive leading
edge of the GSEA (from Fig. 2b) include those associated with
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (e.g., Vim, Zeb1, and Twist2),
cell and focal adhesion (e.g., Itga5, Col4a1, and Col4a2),
membrane type matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., Mmp14), and
developmental pathways (e.g., Wnt5A) as well as other genes
known to promote metastasis of prostate (e.g., Etv45) or other
cancers (e.g., Hmga27) (Fig. 2c). Similarly, genes from the
negative leading edge (from Fig. 2b) include genes associated with
the immune response, such as the interferon regulatory factor Irf7
which has been shown to be a critical regulator of immuno-
surveillance in cancer metastasis36 (Fig. 2d).
Furthermore, GSEA of biological pathways comparing the
mouse metastasis progression signature with the MSigDB Hall-
marks dataset revealed a significant enrichment of pathways that
are commonly associated with metastatic progression in other
tumor contexts, including epithelial to mesenchymal transition,
E2F targets, Myc targets, TGF beta, and P53 pathway among
others (p < 0.05; Fig. 2e; Supplementary Data 2). Notably, many of
the pathways enriched in this metastasis progression signature
based on tumor versus lung metastases from the NPK mice were
also enriched in analogous signatures based on tumor versus liver
or lymph node metastases (p < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 1e, f),
further
emphasizing
the
overall
similarity
of
cell-intrinsic
molecular programs associated with metastasis progression across
these various organ sites.
Most notably, the mouse metastasis progression signature was
highly conserved with a corresponding signature of human
metastatic prostate cancer progression reported by Balk and
colleagues, which compares primary tumors with metastatic bone
biopsies37
(Supplementary
Table
1).
In
particular,
GSEA
comparing a “humanized” version of the mouse metastasis
progression signature with the Balk human prostate cancer
metastasis progression signature demonstrated their significant
similarity in both the positive (NES = 8.02, p < 0.001) and
negative (NES = -3.38, p = 0.002) leading edges (Fig. 2f). Further-
more, GSEA comparing a “humanized” version of the mouse
post-metastatic versus pre-metastatic progression signature with
this human prostate cancer metastasis progression signature also
demonstrated strong enrichment in both the positive (NES =
12.12, p < 0.001) and negative (NES = −2.67, p = 0.0035) leading
edges (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Further, the leading edge genes
between these GSEA comparisons (i.e., from Fig. 2f and
Supplementary Fig. 1g) were highly similar (overlap of the
positive leading edges was 90.5% and the negative leading edge
was 80%; Χ2 p < 0.0001). Taken together, these molecular analyses
define a cell-intrinsic signature of de novo metastasis progression
in the NPK mouse model that is highly conserved with metastasis
progression of human prostate cancer.

 conserved master regulators (MRs) of metastasis progression by
interrogating genome-wide regulatory networks, or interactomes,
for mouse and human prostate cancer38, using the master reg-
ulator inference analysis (MARINa) algorithm39. First, we inter-
rogated the individual mouse and human prostate cancer
interactomes with their respective metastatic progression sig-
natures, which defined independent lists of mouse and human
MRs of metastatic progression (Fig. 3a). We subsequently inte-
grated these individual mouse and human MR lists using Stouffer
integration to define the subset of conserved candidate MRs (n =
485 MRs with Stouffer integrated p < 0.0001; Supplementary
Data 3). Gene ontology analysis of these integrated MRs revealed
an over-representation of genes associated with all aspects of
epigenetic regulation, including histone modification, DNA
methylation, and chromatin remodeling40–42 (n = 136/485 genes,
28%; Supplementary Data 3). Because of the potential significance
of
perturbations
of
epigenetic
regulation
for
metastatic
progression43,44, particularly in lethal prostate cancer21, and since
epigenetic regulators are potential therapeutic targets40–42, we
focused on the subset of conserved MRs that are predicted to
function as epigenetic regulators.
To further prioritize these candidate MRs, we used a Cox
proportional hazard model to assess the association of their MR
activity with prostate cancer-specific survival (where activity for a
given MR is defined based on the expression levels of its MR
transcriptional targets, see Methods). In particular, we used a
human prostate cancer cohort described by Sboner et al., which
has more than 30 years of clinical follow-up data based on death
due to prostate cancer45 (Supplementary Table 1). These analyses
identified a subset of 41 MRs whose activities were significantly
associated with prostate cancer-specific survival (Wald test Cox p
< 0.05; Fig. 3b). Among these, we focused our subsequent analysis
on 8 candidate MRs: (1) that are associated with adverse disease
outcome and prostate-cancer specific lethality (Fig. 3b, c); (2) that
are broadly activated in multiple metastatic organ sites (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2a); and (3) whose activities are up-regulated (rather
than repressed) in metastasis progression (Fig. 3b, c; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2a), and therefore are potentially targets for treatment
inhibition. In particular, these 8 candidate MRs are predicted to
be highly activated across multiple metastatic sites, namely lung,
liver and lymph node (MARINa p < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 2a),
and are significantly associated with adverse disease outcome
(Wald test Cox p ≤ 10−5; Fig. 3c).
We further assessed the clinical relevance of these 8 candidate
metastasis MRs using several independent cohorts of advanced
prostate cancer patients, including those with clinical endpoints
of metastasis or lethality due to prostate cancer (Supplementary
Table 1). First, we performed hierarchical clustering on the
activity levels of the 8 candidate MRs using the Grasso et al.
cohort46, which showed that each of these MRs robustly stratify
metastases (n = 35) from primary tumors (n = 59) (Fig. 3d). We
observed similar findings with a second cohort that included
primary tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n =
497)27
and
metastases
from
the
SU2C
cohort
(n = 51)21
(Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Additionally, using two independent patient cohorts with
clinical follow-up, we found that these 8 candidate MRs predict
disease outcome as evidenced by Kaplan–Meier survival analyses
based on MR activity levels. In particular, activity of the candidate
MRs stratified prostate cancer patients based on their risk of
biochemical recurrence using the Glinsky et al. cohort47 (n = 79
primary prostate tumors; log-rank p = 0.00605; Hazard ratio =
2.452; Fig. 3e). Furthermore, we found that the activities of these
candidate MRs also stratified patients based on the risk of death
due to prostate cancer in the Sboner et al. cohort45 (n = 281
primary tumors; log-rank p = 8.66 × 10−8; Hazard ratio = 2.635;
Fig. 3f). Notably, the predictive ability of the 8 candidate MRs for
adverse disease outcome in both of these cohorts was highly
specific when compared to other MRs selected at random
(significance for 8 candidate MRs versus randomly selected
MRs was p-value = 0.0011 for Sboner et al. and p-value = 0.0214
for Glinsky et al.; Supplementary Fig. 2c, d).
To evaluate the functional relevance of the 8 candidate MRs for
tumor growth and metastasis progression in vivo, we used an
allograft
cell
model
derived
from
the
NPK
mice,
which
recapitulates the pattern of NPK primary tumor growth and
metastasis when engrafted into host mice5. In particular, we
performed shRNA-mediated silencing of each of the candidate
MRs using a minimum of 2 shRNAs for each gene (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 3). Analysis in vitro revealed
that NPK cells having individually silenced MRs displayed
reduced
colony
formation
and
reduced
invasive
potential
compared with the control cells, albeit to varying extents for
each MR (p < 0.05, two-tailed Student's t-test; Supplementary
Fig. 3b–d). Furthermore, when engrafted in vivo, these MR-
silenced NPK cells displayed reduced tumor growth (p < 0.05,
two-way ANOVA) and/or reduced incidence of metastasis
compared with the control cells, also to varying degrees for each

NSD2 is a driver of metastatic prostate cancer progression.
Among the candidate MRs, the highest level of MR activity
(Fig. 3c) as well as experimentally determined functional activity
(Supplementary Fig. 3) were observed for the histone methyl-
transferase, Nuclear receptor binding SET Domain protein 2
(NSD2). Notably, NSD2 is a putative cofactor of androgen
receptor48 that has been previously implicated in advanced
prostate cancer49–51, and has been shown to collaborate with RAS
signaling in other tumor contexts52. Therefore, we examined the
expression of NSD2 at the mRNA and protein levels in non-
metastatic and metastatic contexts in both mouse and human
prostate cancer (Fig. 4). In the mouse prostate, we found that
Nsd2 protein is expressed at low levels in non-metastatic tumors
from the NP mice, while it is highly expressed in metastatic
tumors from the NPK mice, as well as corresponding metastases
from these mice (n = 4/group; Fig. 4a). Notably, Nsd2 was
robustly expressed in nuclei of NPK tumors and lung metastases,
coincident with high levels of Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation,
strong expression of nuclear androgen receptor (AR), and robust
expression of pan-cytokeratin (Pan-Ck) (Fig. 4a).
In human prostate cancer, we found that NSD2 expression is
increased during cancer progression at both the mRNA and
protein levels (Fig. 4b–e). In particular, expression of NSD2
mRNA levels were significantly higher in more advanced
(Gleason ≥ 4 + 4; n = 104) versus earlier stage (Gleason <4 + 4;
n = 173) prostate primary tumors reported in TCGA27 (p =
2.65 × 10−9 two-sample two-tailed Welch t-test; Fig. 4b). Further,
NSD2 expression was significantly higher in prostate cancer
metastases reported in the SU2C cohort21 (n = 51) as compared
with primary tumors from TCGA (n = 333; p = 1.64 × 10−10
two-sample two-tailed Welch t-test; Fig. 4c).
To evaluate expression of NSD2 protein in human prostate
cancer, we performed immunohistochemistry on a human
prostate cancer tissue microarray (n = 100) comprised of benign
tumors (n = 26), non-lethal prostate adenocarcinoma (n = 25),

 examined matched sets of primary tumors and metastases from
the same patient (n = 3). Whereas expression in the primary
tumors was scattered and focal, NSD2 was robustly expressed in
metastasis from these patients (Fig. 4f). These findings extend
previous studies showing increased expression of NSD2 in
advanced prostate cancer49.
To evaluate the functional consequences of NSD2 for disease
progression and metastasis, we used the mouse NPK metastatic
allograft model, as described above, as well as human DU145
prostate cancer cells, which model aggressive disease5,38. In
particular, we used lentiviral gene delivery to introduce a
minimum of two independent shRNAs to silence NSD2 in either
the mouse or human cells, which resulted in effective silencing of
NSD2 as evident both at the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5a–c).
NSD2 has been reported to function as a histone methyl-
transferase that targets the histone H3 di-methyl mark on lysine
36 (H3K36me2)51,53–55. Accordingly, we found that silencing of
NSD2 in either human or mouse cells resulted in a modest but
reproducible reduction of the H3K36me2 mark, while not altering
the mono-methyl marks on lysine 36 (H3K36me1) or other
histone marks such as tri-methyl lysine 27 (H3K27me3) or lysine
9 (H3K9me3) (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, NSD2 silencing in either
mouse NPK cells or human DU145 cells in vitro resulted in a
5–10 fold inhibition of colony formation (p < 0.0001, two-tailed
Student's t-test), as well as significantly decreased invasion (p <
0.01, two-tailed Student's t-test; Fig. 5d–g).
Moreover, analyses of NPK metastatic allografts in vivo
revealed that Nsd2 silencing resulted in increased overall survival
(n = 10/group; p = 0.0005, log-rank; Fig. 6a) as well as a
significant reduction of metastatic burden while not affecting
primary tumor growth (n = 9/group; p < 0.03, Mann–Whitney U
test; Fig. 6b–d). Notably, these Nsd2-silenced tumors had
profoundly reduced expression of Nsd2 protein compared with
the control tumors, as well as reduced expression of the
corresponding H3K36me2 mark, but not other histone marks,
such as H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 (Fig. 6e, f). Taken together,
these observations demonstrate that increased expression of
NSD2 is associated with lethal and metastatic prostate cancer, and
establish the functional relevance of NSD2 for metastatic prostate
cancer progression.
To consider whether it might be feasible to pharmacologically
target NSD2 activity to inhibit prostate cancer progression and
tumor growth, we used a small molecule inhibitor of NSD2 called
MCTP-39 (3-hydrazinoquinoxaline-2-thiol), which has been
reported to be a lysine-HMTase inhibitor that is a competitor
of the SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) domain56. We found that
MCTP-39 inhibited the H3K36me2 mark, while not affecting
other histone marks such as H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 (Fig. 7a);
notably, the degree of reduction the H3K36me2 mark following
treatment with MCTP-39 in vitro was comparable to the degree
that the H3K36me2 mark was reduced following silencing of
NSD2 in vitro (Fig. 5c).
Treatment with MCTP-39 in human DU145 cells in vitro
resulted in a significant dose-dependent reduction in colony
formation (>10 fold; p < 0.01 two-tailed Student's t-test; Fig. 7b).
Since we found that this inhibitor was well tolerated in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. 4), we evaluated the effect of MCTP-39 on
tumor growth of human prostate cells in vivo by establishing
DU145 xenografts (Fig. 7c–f). We found that DU145 xenografts
treated with MCTP-39 had a significant decrease in tumor
volume (n = 14 vehicle-treated and n = 15 MCTP-39-treated; p <
0.001, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 7c, d). The resulting MCTP-39
treated tumors had reduced expression of the H3K36me2
mark, but not other histone marks such as H3K9me3 or
H3K27me3 (Fig. 7e, f). Together with the results of silencing
NSD2 in vivo, these findings regarding MCTP-39 treatment
suggest that NSD2 may be a target for intervention in advanced
prostate cancer.
Discussion
Our study demonstrates the value of cross-species integration of
molecular data from genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMM) and human cancer to elucidate cell-intrinsic mechan-
isms of de novo metastasis progression. Notably, our current
study, which identifies conserved drivers of metastatic progres-
sion by isolation of lineage-marked cells directly from tumors and
metastases from a prostate cancer GEMM, complements and
extends previous work that identified mechanisms of lung cancer
metastasis using cell lines generated from tumors and metastases
of lung cancer GEMM7. Among its advantages for our current
investigations, the NPK mouse model displays a highly penetrant
metastatic phenotype with consistent temporal progression, and it
incorporates in vivo lineage tracing of the primary tumors and
metastases. Thus, by comparing metastasis progression signatures
from NPK mice with comparable signatures from human prostate
cancer, we have identified conserved master regulators (MRs) of
metastasis progression that are associated with adverse disease
outcome. We propose that the general strategy of integrating
molecular analyses of tumors and metastases from relevant
GEMMs with cross-species computational analyses of human
cancer can be broadly adopted to identify new targets for pre-
vention, detection, and potentially treatment of metastasis pro-
gression for other cancer types.
The capability of generating transcriptomic data from lineage-
marked tumor and metastatic cells from different organ sites that
are free from other stromal and tissue-specific cells, allowed us to
elucidate cell-intrinsic gene expression changes that occur during
cancer progression. Surprisingly, we found that the predominant
gene expression differences that occur during metastasis pro-
gression arise in the transition from pre-metastatic to metastatic
tumors and are shared among metastases from various organs.
This is similar to findings of a recent study of metastasis pro-
gression in mouse model of pancreatic cancer6.
Notably, our analyses of purified tumor and metastatic cells
free of other tissue components reveals an overall similarity of
cell-intrinsic metastasis progression across the various metastatic
sites, thus supporting the concept that organ-site tropic factors
may be contributed by the tumor microenvironment at the
metastatic site2. We speculate that organ-site specific factors act
in collaboration with cell-intrinsic drivers of metastasis progres-
sion, such as those identified herein. Furthermore, our findings,
which suggest that there are common cell-intrinsic drivers of
metastasis progression across organ sites in the mouse model, is
consistent with a study of human prostate cancer, which reported
the inherent similarity of tumors and metastases from the same
patient25, and therefore support the feasibility of investigating
agents that target metastatic progression in advanced prostate
cancer patients.
Interestingly, we find that conserved master regulators of
metastasis progression are highly enriched for genes that are
predicted to function as regulators of the epigenome, including
those that modify DNA and histones, or remodel chromatin
architecture. Consistent with our findings, genomic sequencing of
prostate tumors has identified several mutations in epigenetic
genes particularly in advanced prostate cancer20,21,27. Further-
more, dysregulation of the epigenome is associated with meta-
static progression of human prostate cancer57,58.
In particular, we have demonstrated that the Nuclear receptor
binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2) is a robust marker of
lethal metastatic prostate cancer and a key driver of prostate
cancer metastasis, extending previous studies that have reported

 regulated in advanced tumors coordinating with the activation of
PI-3 kinase signaling49, and to be a cofactor of androgen
receptor48.
Notably, the role of NSD2 in cancer has been shown to be
dependent on its activity as a histone methyltransferase for the
histone H3 di-methyl K36 (H3K36me2)50,61,62. In the current
study, we show that MCTP-39, a putative inhibitor of NSD256,
inhibits prostate tumor growth in vivo. However, several caveats
preclude us from drawing the direct conclusion that MCTP-39 is
acting to inhibit NSD2 activity in this context, including the
potential activity of unknown metabolites and the potential lack
of specificity of MCTP-39 given its relatively simple chemical
structure56.
Nonetheless, our study demonstrates that NSD2 is a functional
driver of prostate cancer metastasis and suggests that it may be
target for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Notably, the
activity of NSD2 as a histone methyltransferase has been shown to
be coordinately regulated by EZH251, a major component of the
histone
methyltransferase
polycomb
repressive
complex
2
(PRC2), which is also dysregulated in prostate cancer. Addi-
tionally, in multiple myeloma, NSD2 has been shown to be a
regulator of DNA damage response that impacts resistance to
chemotherapy62. These previous studies suggest that combination
therapy targeting NSD2 together with inhibition of PI-3 Kinase,
AR, EZH2, and/or DNA repair mechanisms, all of which are
themselves targetable and highly relevant for prostate cancer, may
prove to be efficacious for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.
We further proposed that these combination treatments can be
evaluated in co-clinical assays using the NPK mouse model
described herein.

 Methods
Expression profiling of lineage-marked cells. All experiments using animals
were performed according to protocols approved by and following all ethical
guidelines required by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
at Columbia University Irving Medical Center or the Ethics Committee for Animal
Research (CEIC) at Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute. For molecular profiling
analyses, lineage-marked cells from primary tumors and/or metastases were col-
lected from Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Ptenfloxed/floxed; R26RYFP (NP) and Nkx3.1CreERT2/+;
Ptenfloxed/floxed; Kraslsl-G12D/+; R26RYFP (NPK) mice, which have been previously
published5,33,35. Note that inclusion of the lox-stop-lox R26YFP allows for lineage
tracing specifically in prostate cells at the time of tumor induction5. These NP, and
NPK mice have been maintained in our laboratory on a predominantly C57BL/6
background. All studies were done using littermates that were genotyped prior to
enrollment; mice were randomly enrolled to treatment or control groups and only
male mice were used because of the focus on prostate.
Mice were induced to form tumors at 2–3 months of age by administration of
tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, Allentown, PA) using 100 mg/kg once daily for 4
consecutive days and monitored for 1 to 9 months, during which time the NPK
mice develop prostate adenocarcinoma that progresses to overt metastasis5. At the
time of killing, prostate tumors from NP or NPK mice, as well as tissues with overt
metastases from the NPK mice, as detected by ex-vivo fluorescence, were collected
in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tissues were digested in one part of
collagenase/hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Cambridge, MA) and nine
parts of DMEM-F12 and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C for 3 h. Samples
were pelleted at 350XG in an Eppendorf 5810 R tabletop centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °
C, re-suspended in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Stem Cell Technologies, Cambridge,
MA), and incubated for 1 h on ice. Cells were collected by centrifugation as above,
and incubated in a cocktail of pre-warmed dispase (5 mg/ml) plus DNaseI (1 mg/
ml) (Stem Cell technologies, Cambridge, MA) for 10 min at 37 °C; after which, cells
were filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer, pelleted and re-suspended in 1% PBS/
FBS and proceed to the sorter. The YFP-lineage marked cells were purified using a
BD FACS Aria II sorter and the YFP + population isolated using the PE/FITC (R-
Phycoerytrin/Fluorescein isothiocyanate) channels to gate the YFP + population.
Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of Trizol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
RNA was prepared using a MagMAX-96 total RNA isolation kit (Life
technologies). Total RNA was enriched for mRNA using poly-A pull-down; only
samples having between 200 ng and 1 μg with an RNA integrity number (RIN) > 8
were used. Library preparation was done using an Illumina TruSeq RNA prep-kit,
and the libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 by multiplexing
samples in each lane, which yields targeted number of single-end/paired-end 100
bp reads for each sample, as a fraction of 180 million reads for the whole lane. Raw
counts were normalized and the variance was stabilized using DESeq2 package
(Bioconductor) in R-studio 0.99.902, R v3.3.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, ISBN 3-900051-07-0). A complete list of differentially expressed genes
is provided in Supplementary Data 1.
Cross species computational analyses. Differential gene expression signatures
were defined as a list of genes ranked by their differential expression between any
two phenotypes of interest (e.g., metastases vs primary tumors) estimated using a
two-sample two-tailed Welch t-test. For cross species analyses, the human gene
expression signatures were defined based on published prostate cancer cohorts
(Supplementary Table 1) and the mouse gene expression signatures were generated
from the RNA sequencing analyses as described above (Supplementary Data 1). For
the mouse signatures, a minimum of 5 samples were used for each group as
necessary to estimate statistical significance in the two-sample two-tailed Welch t-
test and GSEA.
For comparison with human genes, mouse genes were mapped to their
corresponding human orthologs based on the homoloGene database (NCBI) so
that mouse-human comparisons were done using the “humanized” mouse
signatures. For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) normalized enrichment score
(NES) and p-values were estimated using 1,000 gene permutations. Pathway
enrichment analysis was done using GSEA to query the Hallmark Pathways dataset
from the MSigDB (i.e., Molecular Signatures Database) collections available from
the Broad Institute, where NES and p-value were estimated using 1000 gene
permutations (Supplementary Data 2). Master regulator (MR) analysis was
performed using the MAster Regulator INference algorithm (MARINa) to query
the mouse and human prostate cancer interactomes, respectively, as published
previously38 (Supplementary Data 3).
Master regulator activity analyses. Transcriptional activity of master regulators
(MRs) was estimated using expression levels of their transcriptional targets and
reflects their enrichment in the signature being queried. In particular, targets of a
particular MR are used as a query gene set to estimate their enrichment in the
reference signature of interest (e.g., metastatic progression signature). If positive
targets are overexpressed (i.e., enriched in the overexpressed tail of the reference
signature) and/or negative targets are underexpressed (i.e., enriched in the
underexpressed tail of the reference signature), such MR is considered active (i.e.,
its transcriptional activity is positive). If the converse is the case, the MR is
repressed (i.e., its transcriptional activity is negative).
The relationship of MR activity levels for clinical outcome was assessed using
four independent datasets (Supplementary Table 1): Sboner et al., which reports

 death due to prostate cancer as the clinical end-point45; Grasso et al., which reports
metastases versus primary tumors as a binary outcome46; Glinsky et al., which
reports biochemical recurrence (BCR) as the clinical end-point47; and a combined
SU2C21 and TCGA27 cohort (i.e., cohorts were combined on raw count levels and
normalized using DESeq2 package), which report castration-resistant metastases
and primary prostate tumors as a binary outcome, respectively. Sboner et al. was
utilized for Cox proportional hazard model analysis (MR filtering/discovery step)
and subsequent confirmatory Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Glinsky et al. was
utilized as an independent validation dataset for Kaplan–Meier survival analysis.
Grasso et al. and combined SU2C and TCGA cohort were utilized to evaluate the
efficacy of MRs stratification of primary tumor versus metastasis.
Immunohistochemical analysis. All studies involving human subjects were
approved by the Institutional Review Board at Weil Cornell Medical School. Only
anonymized tissues were used and patient consent was obtained. The cohort
included benign prostate tissue (n = 26), untreated localized adenocarcinoma (with
a representative range of different Gleason scores) (n = 25), castration-resistant
adenocarcinoma (CRPC-Adeno) (n = 31) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer
(NEPC) (n = 18). Subtype and grading were assigned as defined by pathology and
clinical criteria as described63. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded sections using a Bond III automated immunostainer and
the Bond Polymer Refine detection system (Leica Microsystems, IL, USA). Slides
were de-paraffinized and heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed using the
Bond Epitope Retrieval 2 solution at pH9 and incubated with the anti-NSD2
primary antibody (Supplementary Table 2). Nuclear staining intensity was eval-
uated by a pathologist and scoring was done blinded and defined as negative (or
present in <5% of nuclei), weak, moderate, or strong. Immunostaining of mouse
prostate tissues and metastases was done as described previously5,35. Briefly, 3 μm
paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene, followed by antigen retrieval in
antigen unmasking solution (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Slides were blocked in
10% normal goat serum, then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C,
followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h. For immunostaining, the
signal was enhanced using the Vectastain ABC system and visualized with
NovaRed Substrate Kit (Vector Labs). All antibodies used in this study, as well as
antibody dilutions, are described in Supplementary Table 2.
Functional validation studies. Mouse cell lines were isolated from lung metastases
from NPK mice and their genotype was authenticated as described previously5.
Human cell lines were purchased from and authenticated by ATCC (American
Type Culture Collection). Cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented with
10% FBS (ThermoFisher, Bridgewater, NJ). Only early passage cells were used for
all studies herein. Cells were routinely tested to ensure that they are free of
myoplasma using the MycoFluor Mycoplasma Detection Kit (InvitrogenTM,
Carlsbad, CA). For shRNA-mediated silencing, a minimum of two independent
shRNA clones were used for each gene using the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector system
following manufacturer´s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, Allentown, PA). The
sequences for all mouse and human shRNA used in this study are provided in
Supplementary Table 3. As a control, we used a pLKO.1 lentiviral vector with
shRNA targeting the Luciferase gene (SHC007, Sigma-Aldrich).
Analysis of RNA expression was done by quantitative real time PCR using the
QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) using mouse or
human GADPH as the control5,35. Sequences of all primers are provided in
Supplementary Table 3.
Western blot analysis was performed using total protein extracts as
described5,35. Briefly, cells were lysed with 1X radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate sodium salt, 1.0% Triton-X 100, 0.15 M
NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11 836 153 001), 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3
(Sigma, P0044), and 0.5 % PMSF (Sigma). Protein lysates (5 μg per lane) were
resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare,
Amersham), then blocked with PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1 Tween-
20) containing 5% non fat dry milk. Incubation with primary antibody was done at
4° overnight, followed by incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. Detection was performed using the ECL Plus Western Blotting
Detection Kit (GE Healthcare/Amersham, New York). A list of all antibodies and
antibody dilutions is provided in Supplementary Table 2. Uncropped images are
provided in Supplementary Figures 5 and 6.
Colony formation and invasion assays were done as described5. Briefly, for
colony formation, 1 × 103 cells were seeded in triplicate in three independent
experiments (aggregate total n = 9) in 60-mm plates and grown for 10 days in
RPMI-1640 media (Gibco, Bridgewater, NJ) supplemented with 10% FBS
(BenchMarkTM Gemini Bio-Products, Sacramento, CA). Colonies were visualized
by staining with crystal violet and quantified using ImageJ software (National
Institute of Health website). For matrigel invasion assays, 2.5 × 104 cells were
seeded in three independent experiments (aggregate total n = 9) in BD FluoroBlok
inserts (BD Biosciences, Billerica, MA) in FBS-free media and media supplemented
with 10% FBS was used in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant.
For in vivo assays, 1 × 106 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of
immunodeficient NCr nude mice (male, Taconic, Rensselaer, NY); we performed
two independent experiments each done using 10 mice/group. Tumors were
monitored by caliper measurement twice weekly for approximately 4 weeks and
tumor volumes were calculated using the formula [Volume = (width)2 x length/2].
At the time of euthanasia, tumors were harvested and weighed, and the number of
lung metastases was documented ex vivo by visualizing their fluorescence using an
Olympus SZX16 microscope equipped with epifluorescence capabilities. The total
number of metastatic nodules in the lung was assessed for each mouse and the p-
value was calculated by comparing the control and each shRNA silences using a
two-tailed Student's t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test.
For analyses of NSD2 inhibition, MCTP-39 (3-hydrazinylquinoxaline-2-thiol)
was purchased from Enamine L.t.d. (Ukraine)56. For studies performed in mice, the
MCTP-39 was further purified at the Organic Synthesis Core Facility (OSCF) at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The MCTP-39 was subjected to silica gel
chromatography, microfiltered on a 0.2 μ Teflon membrane and lyophilized. The
resulting solid was analyzed by UPLC (ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography)
on reverse phase C18 silica gel in addition to 1H and 13C NMR (Bruker 600 MHz
machine).
For in vitro assays, 3 × 105 DU145 cells were seeded in triplicate in three
independent experiments (aggregate total n = 9) in a 100 mm dish. 24 h following
plating, the compound MCTP-39 (5 mM in DMSO) was added to a final
concentration of 2.5 μM or 5 μM and incubated for 72 h; DMSO was used as a
vehicle control. Cells were collected and lysed for western blot analysis or were
seeded for colony formation assays as described above.
For in vivo studies, 5 × 106 DU145 cells in 50% matrigel were injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice. When tumors reached 200 mm3, mice
were allocated into the vehicle (1% Carboxymethylcellulose, 0.1% Tween80, 5%
DMSO) or MCTP-39 (10 mg/kg in vehicle) groups using cage-based
randomization, which were administered by oral gavage daily for 3 months. Tumor
volume was measured by calipers twice weekly, and estimated by the formula
[Volume = (width)2 x length/2]. Total mice analyzed were: vehicle = 14; MCTP-
39 = 15 (two independent experiments). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used to calculate the significance (p-value) of the difference between the vehicle
and treatment groups.
Statistical analyses. The Cox model and Kaplan–Meier analysis were done using
the surv and coxph functions from the survcomp R package (Bioconductor). Sta-
tistical significance was estimated with Wald test and log-rank test, respectively.
For Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, k-means clustering was done on the activity
levels of the MRs to cluster patients into two groups: one group with increased
activity of the candidate MRs and one group with decreased MR activity. To
compare the predictive ability of candidate MRs to results at random, we selected a
random (equally sized, n = 8) group of MRs and utilized their activity levels for
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. This procedure was repeated 1000 times and log-
rank p-values from all iterations were used to build a Null model. The empirical p-
value was then estimated as a number of times log-rank p-values for a random
group of 8 MRs reached or outperformed our original log-rank p value for the
identified 8 MRs. R-studio 0.99.902, R v3.3.0, were used for statistical calculations
and data visualization.
