ABSTRACT
Background: The use of electronic cigarettes (ECs) has increased drastically over
the past five years, primarily as an alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes.
However, the adverse effects of acute and long-term use of ECs on the microbiota
have not been explored. In this pilot study, we sought to determine if ECs or
tobacco smoking are associated with differences in the oral and gut microbiota, in
comparison to non-smoking controls.
Methods: We examined a human cohort consisting of 30 individuals: 10 EC users,
10 tobacco smokers, and 10 controls. We collected cross-sectional fecal, buccal
swabs, and saliva samples from each participant. All samples underwent V4 16S
rRNA gene sequencing.
Results: Tobacco smokers had significantly different bacterial profiles in all sample
types when compared to controls, and in feces and buccal swabs when compared to
EC users. The most significant associations were found in the gut, with a higher
relative abundance of Prevotella (P = 0.006) and lowered Bacteroides (P = 0.036) in
tobacco smokers. The Shannon diversity was also significantly reduced (P = 0.009)
in fecal samples collected from tobacco smokers compared to controls. No
significant difference was found in the alpha diversity, beta-diversity or taxonomic
relative abundances between EC users and controls.
Discussion: The current pilot data demonstrate that tobacco smoking is associated
with signicant differences in the oral and gut microbiome in humans. However,
validation in larger cohorts and greater understanding of the short and long-term
impact of EC use on microbiota composition and function is warranted.

 INTRODUCTION
Tobacco cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable diseases in the world (Cahn &
Siegel, 2011). Smoking increases the risk for development of several diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (Lubin et al., 2016), various cancers (Jacobs et al., 2015),
especially lung cancer (Montserrat-Capdevila et al., 2016), and inflammatory bowel
disease (Higuchi et al., 2012). Electronic cigarettes (ECs) offer promise as a tool to quit
or an alternative to tobacco smoking. It is estimated that over 12% of adults in the
US have used ECs (Kosmider et al., 2016). Use of ECs is tripling annually with consumers
including non-tobacco smoking adolescents and adults (Moon, Lee & Lee, 2015;
Bostean, Trinidad & McCarthy, 2015). While ECs primarily contain propylene glycol,
vegetable glycerin, and nicotine, tobacco cigarettes are composed of over 4,000 other
chemicals and particulate matter (You et al., 2015). Studies reporting negative health
effects relating to ECs are scarce and ECs remain unregulated, but commercial ECs have
been reported to contain low levels of toxic compounds (Cahn & Siegel, 2011; Varlet et al.,
2015; Kosmider et al., 2016; Allen et al., 2016).
There are relatively few studies exploring the effects of tobacco smoke on the
microbiota and we are not aware of any study to date that has compared the bacterial
communities in tobacco smokers and EC users. In one human study, the oral microbiota
was different between healthy non-smokers and tobacco smokers, with lower
Porphyromonas, Neisseria, and Gemella in tobacco smokers, but the lung communities
were not affected (Morris et al., 2013). Smoking has also been shown to drive changes in
the sputum microbiota more than other lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise and alcohol),
increasing the relative abundance of Veillonella and Megasphaera (Lim et al., 2016). A
recent large-scale sequencing study of the oral microbiota in current, previous, or
non-smokers demonstrated current smokers had distinct oral communities, with lower
relative abundance of Proteobacteria (Wu et al., 2016). Notably, the significant taxa vary
between studies and a recent analysis of numerous sites within the mouth found no
significant difference between smokers and controls in any site, with the exception of
the buccal mucosa (Yu et al., 2017). Quitting smoking has been shown to increase bacterial
diversity and alter community composition in both the mouth (Delima et al., 2010)
and gut (Biedermann et al., 2013). Besides human cohort research, the gut microbiota
has been shown to differ in tobacco smoke exposed mice, in comparison to air-only
exposure (Wang, 2012; Allais et al., 2016).
The current study represents the first exploration of EC vapor and tobacco smoke
exposure on the oral (buccal and saliva) and gut bacterial communities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and cohort
The study was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board
(IRB H-38043). Written informed consent was obtained prior to collection of data
and samples.

 The cohort consisted of 30 individuals in three distinct exposure groups; EC users
(n = 10), tobacco smokers (n = 10), and matched controls (n = 10). All participants
were recruited from the Houston area. Inclusion criteria for EC users included daily
use of ECs for at least six months. Inclusion criteria for tobacco smokers included an
Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence �4 and smoked a minimum of 10 cigarettes
per day. Subject variables between the three exposure groups were comparable, with
no significant difference in the sex, age, diet, height/weight, or race (Table 1). Notably,
only 2/30 samples were from female participants. One EC user (EC7) reported
occasionally smoking one tobacco cigarette per week and no other EC users reported use
of tobacco cigarettes. EC7 had a comparable carbon monoxide (CO) ppm to other EC
users and controls. No tobacco smokers reported use of EC. EC users vaped regularly
throughout the day, used ECs daily, and had been actively using ECs for a median of three
years.
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from 125 mg of fresh fecal samples using the AllPrep Bacterial kit
(Mo Bio 47054; Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as per the manufacturers’
protocol. Entire buccal swabs and 500 ml saliva samples were extracted using the

CA, USA) as per the manufacturers’ protocol, omitting the necessary steps for co-elution
of DNA and RNA, and with elution of nucleic acids in 50 ml.
16S rRNA gene sequencing
The bacterial 16S rRNA gene V4 region was amplified by PCR using barcoded Illumina
adapter-containing primers 515F and 806R (Caporaso et al., 2012) and sequenced with the
2 � 250 bp cartridges in the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The read pairs
were demultiplexed and reads were merged using USEARCH v7.0.1090 (Edgar, 2010).
Merging allowed zero mismatches and a minimum overlap of 50 bases, and merged
reads were trimmed at the first base with a Q � 5. A quality filter was applied to the resulting
merged reads and those containing above 0.5% expected errors were discarded. Sequences
were stepwise clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a similarity cutoff value
of 97% using the UPARSE algorithm (Edgar, 2013). Chimeras were removed using
USEARCH v7.0.1090 and UCHIME. To determine taxonomies, OTUs were mapped to a
version of the SILVA database (Quast et al., 2013) containing only the 16S V4 region using
USEARCH v7.0.1090. Abundances were recovered by mapping the merged reads to the
UPARSE OTUs. A rarefied OTU table was constructed from the output files generated in the
previous two steps for downstream analyses of alpha diversity, beta diversity (including
UniFrac), and phylogenetic trends (Lozupone & Knight, 2005).
Statistical analysis
Samples were rarefied to 4,000 reads and rarefaction resulted in the loss of all negative
controls for each DNA extraction kit. Analysis and visualization of bacterial communities
was conducted in R (R Development Core Team, 2014). For analysis of alpha diversity
and taxonomic relative abundance, the Kruskal–Wallis test (Kruskal & Wallis, 1952)
was first applied to determine the overall statistical significance of the three groups. Only
if the Kruskal–Wallis test showed a P < 0.05, pairwise significance was determined based
on the Mann–Whitney test (Mann & Whitney, 1947). Differences in beta diversity
(weighted Unifrac distance) were assessed using PERMANOVA. Linear regression was
performed in R using the lm() function. When comparing more than one measure, such
as multiple measures of alpha diversity or for multiple taxonomic genera, P-values were
adjusted for multiple comparisons with the false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm
(Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).
All data and metadata files, as well as the R code used in the analysis, are provided in
the Supplemental Information.
RESULTS
Microbiota specific to sample site
Feces had a distinct bacterial profile compared to the oral samples (buccal swab and
saliva) (Fig. S1A). The Shannon diversity indices were higher in saliva (P < 0.001)
and feces (P < 0.001) in comparison to buccal swab samples (Fig. S1B). Dominant
bacterial genera were also significantly different (P < 0.001) between the three
Stewart et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4693
4/16
 sample types (Fig. S1C). Thus, analyses exploring tobacco smoking or EC use were
stratified by sample type.
Alpha diversity of feces is lower in tobacco smokers
The Shannon diversity was significantly lower in fecal samples collected from tobacco
smokers compared to controls (P = 0.009), but the number of observed OTUs was
comparable between all groups (Fig. 1A). No significant difference was found in the
number of OTUs or Shannon diversity between the groups in buccal swabs and saliva
samples (Figs. 1B and 1C).
Bacterial profiles of feces and oral sites are significantly different in
tobacco smokers
Weighted UniFrac PCoA, a quantitative distance metric incorporating phylogenetic
distances between taxa, showed tobacco smokers had significantly different fecal bacterial
profiles compared to controls (P = 0.027) and EC users (P = 0.009), but controls
and EC users were not significantly different (P = 0.261) (Fig. 2A). This was consistent
in buccal swabs, where bacterial profiles were significantly different between tobacco
smokers compared to controls (P = 0.049) and EC users (P = 0.033), but controls
and EC users were comparable (P = 0.886) (Fig. 2B). In saliva samples, the microbiota
profiles of tobacco smokers and controls were significantly different (P = 0.046) and
EC users were comparable to both tobacco smokers and controls (Fig. 2C).
The relative abundance of bacterial genera was significantly
associated with tobacco smoking in feces only
Fecal samples had a total of two genera significantly different between the three groups, with
higher Prevotella (P = 0.006) and lower Bacteroides (P = 0.036) in tobacco smokers (Fig. 3).
Further pairwise comparisons of these genera showed Prevotella had significantly higher
relative abundance in tobacco smokers compared to controls (P = 0.008) and EC users
(P = 0.003), but no difference between EC users and controls (P = 0.99). Whereas
Bacteroides showed significantly lower relative abundance in tobacco smokers compared to
controls (P = 0.017) and EC users (P = 0.003), but no difference between EC users and
controls (P = 0.684). No significant difference in any bacterial genera was observed between
the different groups in saliva or buccal swab samples (Fig. S2). These findings were also
supported by correlations with CO levels, which reflect the amount an individual smoked
tobacco cigarettes. Specifically, no genus was significantly associated with saliva or buccal
swab samples, but Bacteroides was negatively correlated with CO level (P = 0.042) and
Prevotella was positively correlated with CO levels (P = 0.011) (Table S1; Fig. S3).
DISCUSSION
This pilot study aimed to characterize EC vapor and tobacco smoke exposure on the
bacterial profiles at multiple distinct and relevant body sites in a human cohort. To our
knowledge this work represents the first study to concurrently explore the associations of
EC vapor and tobacco smoke exposure on the microbiota. With users of ECs increasing at

 an unprecedented rate, it is imperative to understand the potential influences on host
well-being, for which the oral and gut microbiota may have important consequences.
We report, for the first time, that people who regularly use ECs do not have measurably
different oral or gut bacterial communities compared to non-smoking controls. However,
compared to non-smoking controls, tobacco smokers had significantly different bacterial
profiles in all samples analyzed, with the most significant associations found in the gut.
This is in accordance with existing data showing the gut microbiota changes following
smoking cessation (Biedermann et al., 2013, 2014). This is reflected in the alpha diversity
analyses, where the fecal microbiota of tobacco smokers had significantly lower Shannon
diversity compared to controls. Previous studies have also showed the Shannon diversity
is lower in tobacco smokers compared to matched non-smokers in the gut (Opstelten
et al., 2016), but recovers upon smoking cessation (Biedermann et al., 2013). Although
smoking was recently reported to reduce buccal diversity (Yu et al., 2017), we found no
difference in the diversity between the groups in buccal swabs. Overall, such studies
provide further evidence for a direct effect of tobacco smoke in restricting microbial
diversity and/or providing favorable conditions for specific taxa. The low bacterial
diversity in the gut was striking, which may have important consequences for health and
the risk of certain diseases. While inconclusive, low bacterial diversity has been associated
with a range of conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (Ott & Schreiber, 2006;
Durba
´n et al., 2012; Sha et al., 2013), obesity (Turnbaugh et al., 2009), colorectal cancer
(Ahn et al., 2013), and asthma (Abrahamsson et al., 2014).

 Only the fecal microbiota was found to have specific genera significantly different
between exposure groups, with higher relative abundance of Prevotella, in accordance
with existing data (Benjamin et al., 2012). Conversely, smoking tobacco cigarettes was
associated with significantly lower relative abundance of Bacteroides compared to EC users
and controls. Prevotella and Bacteroides are dominant members of the human gut
microbiome (Arumugam et al., 2011; Koren et al., 2013; Gorvitovskaia, Holmes & Huse,
2016). Prevotella is associated with a high fiber diet and living in rural conditions (De
Filippo et al., 2010; Ou et al., 2013; Tyakht et al., 2013; Kovatcheva-Datchary et al., 2015),
whereas high Bacteroides abundance in the gut is generally attributed to a protein, fat, and
sugar rich diet and a Western lifestyle (De Filippo et al., 2010; Ou et al., 2013). Prevotella
and Bacteroides may have important implications for health and disease, with several
species of the Bacteroides genus considered beneficial or probiotic (Xu & Gordon, 2003;
Backhed et al., 2005) though some are considered opportunistic human pathogens.
Existing evidence suggests intestinal inflammation, such as in Crohn’s disease, is
associated with reduced abundance of Bacteroides (Guinane & Cotter, 2013). Furthermore,
a reduced Bacteroides abundance has been associated with obesity in both humans (Ley
et al., 2006) and mice (Ley et al., 2005; Turnbaugh et al., 2006) studies, but the direct role of
the microbiome in obesity causality remains an area of active discussion (Sze & Schloss,
2016). Conversely, high Prevotella in the gut has been associated with human colon cancer
(Chen et al., 2012; Sivaprakasam et al., 2016) and susceptibility to colitis (Elinav et al.,
2011; Chow, Tang & Mazmanian, 2011).
No taxa were significantly different in the oral (both buccal swab and saliva)
microbiota. These results were surprising given the immediate proximity of the oral
environment, relative to the gut, in smoke/vapor exposure. Indeed, smoking tobacco
cigarettes has previously been shown to significantly alter the bacterial community in oral
and lung samples (Charlson et al., 2010; Kozlowska et al., 2013; Mason et al., 2014; Wu
et al., 2016). Conversely, existing studies have also reported no changes in smokers (Morris
et al., 2013) and the taxa driving the separation vary between studies, which may reflect
the differences in cohorts or methods, such as in specific site of sample collection,
extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatics (Yu et al., 2017). Thus, further research in
large multi-location cohorts is necessary to ascertain the direct effects of smoking across
respiratory sites. Notably, both Prevotella and Bacteroides were highly specific to fecal
samples (Table S2; Fig. S3), further demonstrating the precise effects of tobacco smoke
exposure on taxa endogenous to the gut.
This study has several potential limitations. First, the cohort information was collected
by questionnaire and while one EC user reported occasional use of tobacco cigarettes (one
per week maximum), it is possible other participants used tobacco cigarettes and did not
report this. However, to control for this we tested the CO levels (reflective of smoke
inhalation) in all individuals and found tobacco smokers had higher CO ppm compared
to EC users and controls, which would be expected (Table 1). Second, it is possible that
the study was underpowered to detect subtle changes in the different sample sites and
within some of the patient demographics. Third, only 2/30 participants in the study were
female and, given the potential for sex-specific microbiota profiles (Haro et al., 2016),
Stewart et al. (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4693
9/16
 additional work is needed to determine if the findings differ between males and females.
Further longitudinal work with frequent sampling in larger human cohorts is needed to
validate the associations reported in this study and determine the potential mechanism
and impact on host health. Despite an absence of taxonomic change in EC vapor
exposure, determining potential changes to microbial and host functioning also
represents an important area for subsequent research.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we found that tobacco smoking was associated with significant differences in
the bacterial profiles in feces, buccal, and saliva samples. Compared to controls, exposure
to ECs made no difference to the oral or gut microbial communities. Differences in the gut
communities of tobacco smokers were associated with higher relative abundance of
Prevotella and lower relative abundance of Bacteroides. Other end points besides the
microbiota will be important to consider when determining the impact of ECs on human
health and disease. At a time when EC use continues to rise, we highlight the need for
greater understanding on the direct short and long-term impact of exposure to vapor on
the microbiome composition and function.
