Abstract
Objective—To evaluate the effectiveness of four commonly used induction methods.
Methods—This randomized trial compared four induction methods: Misoprostol alone, Foley 
alone, Misoprostol–cervical Foley concurrently, and Foley–oxytocin concurrently,. Women 
undergoing labor induction with full term (≥37 weeks), singleton, vertex presenting gestations, 
with no contraindication to vaginal delivery, intact membranes, Bishop score ≤6, and cervical 
dilation ≤2cm were included. Women were enrolled only once during the study period. Our 
primary outcome was time to delivery. Neither patients nor providers were blinded to assigned 
treatment group since examinations are required for placement of all methods; however, research 
personnel were blinded during data abstraction. A sample size of 123 per group (N=492) was 
planned to compare the four groups pairwise (P≤.008), with a 4-hour reduction in delivery time 
considered clinically meaningful.
Results—From May 2013 through June 2015, 997 women were screened and 491 were 
randomized and analyzed. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar among the four 
treatment groups. When comparing all induction method groups, combination methods achieved a 
faster median time to delivery than single-agent methods, (misoprostol–Foley: 13.1 hours, Foley–
oxytocin: 14.5 hours, misoprostol: 17.6 hours, Foley: 17.7 hours, p<0.001). When censored for 
cesarean and adjusting for parity, women who received misoprostol–Foley delivered almost twice 
as likely to deliver before women who received misoprostol alone (hazard ratio (HR, 95% CI) 1.92 
[1.42–2.59]) or Foley alone (HR, 95%CI: 1.87 [1.39–2.52]), whereas Foley–oxytocin was not 
statistically different from single-agent methods.

 Conclusion—After censoring for cesarean and adjusting for parity, misoprostol–cervical Foley 
resulted in twice the chance of delivering before either single-agent method.
Introduction
Four million women give birth each year in the United States with more than 20 percent of 
them undergoing an induction of labor.1 As such, induction is one of the most common 
procedures performed during a woman’s pregnancy. Despite this, the fastest and most 
effective method of inducing labor is unknown. 2, 3–5
Both mechanical and pharmacologic agents are used for induction of labor.3–5 These agents, 
when used individually, reduce the incidence of cesarean delivery in women undergoing 
induction. 3, 4 Plausibly, combining both mechanical and pharmacologic methods may have 
a synergistic effect in achieving labor. Some studies have shown promise in reducing labor 
time and risk of cesarean delivery with combination methods,6, 7 while others have not. 8–11
Therefore, the objective of our study was to compare the time to delivery among four 
different, routinely utilized cervical ripening methods for induction of labor, including two 
different combination methods. Our hypothesis was that women who undergo an induction 
with combined methods will have a shorter time to delivery than those who undergo 
induction with a single method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted this randomized clinical trial (The ‘FOR MOMI’ trial: Foley or Misoprostol 
for the Management of Induction) at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania to 
compare time to delivery among four different methods of induction: misoprostol alone, 
Foley alone, misoprostol–cervical Foley concurrently, and cervical Foley–oxytocin 
concurrently. Prior to initiation of the study, approval was obtained from a convened 
Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania and registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01916681).
Participants were at least 18 years of age with a full term (≥37 weeks), singleton gestation in 
cephalic presentation. Both nulliparous and multiparous women were included. Women 
were required to have intact membranes, a Bishop score of ≤6 and cervical dilation ≤2cm to 
be eligible. Women were excluded if there was a contraindication to a vaginal delivery or to 
misoprostol, fetal demise, or major fetal anomaly. Non-English speaking women, women 
with HIV, and women with medical conditions requiring an assisted second stage were also 
excluded. Additional exclusion criteria were as follows: category 3 fetal heart rate tracing, 
hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome or eclampsia, 
growth restriction <10th percentile (based on Hadlock growth curves) with reversal of flow 
in umbilical artery Doppler studies, and growth restriction <5th percentile with elevated, 
absent, or reversal of flow in umbilical artery Doppler studies. No woman had a prior 
attempt at induction in this pregnancy. Women were included in the study only once. 
Gestational age was determined using routine obstetrical guidelines. 12

 Patients were approached in the obstetrical unit by providers trained in the study consenting 
process prior to the start of their induction. Once written consent was obtained, the 
participants were randomized to one of the four treatment groups. An internet based clinical 
trial management system, Research Electronic Data Capture, REDCap, 13 was accessed to 
enter enrollment information, ensure eligibility, and request randomized treatment 
allocation. An independent consultant created a computer-generated randomization scheme 
that used balanced treatment allocation in blocks of 20. Randomization was stratified by 
parity.
Each of the four treatment groups had a standardized protocol for induction and active phase 
labor management. A brief description of the protocols is described below. The complete 
algorithm for the induction groups and active labor management can be found in the 
supplemental information (Appendixes 1–5, available online at http://links.lww.com/xxx). 
Neither the patients nor the providers were blinded to the assigned treatment group as this 
would not be practical. However, trained research personnel were blinded to study group 
during data abstraction.
Women in the misoprostol only group received 25 micrograms of misprostol per vagina 
every 3 hours, repeated up to five additional times for a maximum of 24 hours. Oxytocin 
was initiated if there was a contraindication to another misoprostol dose or if additional 
cervical ripening was not indicated (Appendix 1, http://links.lww.com/xxx).
Women in the cervical Foley only group had a 18F Foley catheter with 30cc balloon inserted 
digitally or by direct visualization with a speculum. The Foley bulb was placed just above 
the level of the internal os and inflated with 60cc of sterile water.6, 7, 11, 14 The catheter was 
taped to the inner thigh with gentle traction and deflated and removed after 12 hours if still 
in place. The oxytocin protocol was initiated once the Foley bulb was no longer in place 
(Appendix 2, http://links.lww.com/xxx).
Women in the misoprostol–cervical Foley group had both misoprostol and a cervical Foley 
placed concurrently using the same procedures as noted for the individual groups (Appendix 
3, http://links.lww.com/xxx).
Women in the cervical Foley–oxytocin group had a cervical Foley placed using the same 
protocol as described in the cervical Foley only group. Oxytocin was initiated concurrently 
at the start of induction (Appendix 4, http://links.lww.com/xxx).
For all participants, our hospital based oxytocin protocol was utilized. The protocol begins 
with 2 milliunits/minute of oxytocin increasing by 2 milliunits every 15 minutes until regular 
uterine contractions occur. Forty milliunits of oxytocin is considered the maximum dose 
with no limit as to the length of time a participant can remain at 40 milliunits.
Providers were able to perform an amniotomy at any point during the labor course. If the 
patient had not yet had membranes ruptured and cervix was ≥4 cm dilated, it was 
recommended that an amniotomy be performed at this time, if clinically feasible. Once 
cervical dilation was ≥5cm, providers were instructed to proceed with the active labor 
management protocol (Appendix 5, http://links.lww.com/xxx) although active labor itself

 was defined as cervical dilation ≥6cm. Labor interventions including amnioinfusion, fetal 
scalp electrode, tocolysis, and management of the second stage (including operative 
delivery) were at the discretion of the managing provider. All patients had continuous fetal 
monitoring throughout induction, labor and delivery. Cesarean delivery was at the discretion 
of the provider. Recommendations specific for this study included cesarean if not in active 
labor after 36 hours of cervical ripening, or if the patient was undelivered 12 hours after 
achieving active labor.
The primary outcome measure was time to delivery (hours) defined as time from initiation 
of induction method to delivery time, regardless of mode of delivery. Secondary outcome 
measures were Cesarean delivery rate, time to vaginal delivery (hours), time to delivery 
censored for cesarean section, time to active labor (defined as dilatation ≥5cm), delivery 
within 12 hours, delivery within 24 hours, and maternal length of stay (defined as length of 
time from admission for induction to discharge postpartum, days) and indication for 
cesarean delivery. A composite maternal morbidity outcome was pre-specified to include ≥1 
of the following during labor, delivery, or in the 4 weeks postpartum: 3rd/4th degree perineal 
laceration, blood transfusion, endometritis, wound separation–infection (defined by the need 
for additional wound closure or the need for antibiotics), venous thromboembolism, 
hysterectomy, intensive care unit admission, or death. Other maternal secondary outcomes 
analyzed were chorioamnionitis (defined by the presence of maternal fever ≥100·4°F in the 
presence of maternal or fetal tachycardia or fundal tenderness), use of terbutaline, 
intrauterine pressure catheter, amnioinfusion, or analgesia use.
A composite neonatal morbidity outcome was pre-specified to include ≥1 of the following 
prior to neonatal discharge: severe respiratory distress syndrome (defined as intubation and 
mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 12 hours), culture proven–presumed neonatal 
sepsis, neonatal blood transfusion, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, intraventricular 
hemorrhage grade 3 or 4, necrotizing enterocolitis, or receipt of head cooling. Other 
neonatal outcomes analyzed were neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, NICU 
admission >48 hours, and neonatal length of stay (days).
Trained research staff, uninvolved with the clinical care, collected all induction, labor and 
delivery information, maternal demographics, and maternal and neonatal outcomes.
A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) was established to independently evaluate the 
safety of the study. An interim safety analysis was performed for pre-defined adverse 
outcomes with recommendations to continue the study without changes.
A 4 hour reduction in time to delivery was considered clinically meaningful. In the 
literature, the mean time to delivery for patients undergoing induction of labor was 18 hours 
±8.5 6–8. Since there is not one method of induction that is thought to be standard of care, 
we chose to compare all four groups with 6 separate comparisons. Therefore, a type-I alpha 
error rate of 0.008 was selected. Assuming 80% power, equal group sizes, and a two sided p-
value, we would need 112 patients in each group for a total sample size of 448. A crossover–
dropout rate of 10% was assumed leading to a final desired sample size of 492.

 Descriptive statistics for the primary and secondary labor outcomes are reported both overall 
and by parity. Statistical analyses were performed using an intention-to-treat principle. 
Bivariate analyses were carried out using ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis for normally and non-
normally distributed continuous variables, respectively, and Pearson Chi-square or Fisher 
exact for categorical variables, as appropriate. Time to event regression analysis for labor 
length (regardless of delivery mode) was modeled with a Cox proportional hazard model. 
Labor Length with censoring at the time of cesarean delivery was also modeled using a Cox 
proportional hazards model. Risk of cesarean delivery was estimated using a generalized 
linear model with robust error variance 15. Final models were adjusted for parity. Hazard 
ratios (HR) and risk ratios (RR) with the 95% confidence interval are reported. Statistical 
significance for the primary outcome was set at p<0.008.
A sensitivity analysis was also performed using the induction methods that the patient 
actually received in order to determine whether crossovers may have influenced the results.
RESULTS
There were 2056 inductions of labor during the study period of May 2013 to June 2015.. Of 
the 997 women who met eligibility criteria and were approached for enrollment, 502 
declined enrollment, and 492 were randomized into one of the four treatment groups (Figure 
1). One woman was excluded post-randomization after it was discovered that she was <18 
years old, yielding a final sample size of 491 women.
Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar among the four treatment groups 
including Bishop score, cervical dilation at induction, or indication for induction among the 
groups (Table 1).
Overall, combination methods achieved a faster median time to delivery than the single 
agents, p<0.001, (misoprostol–Foley: 13.1 hours, Foley–oxytocin: 14.5 hours, misoprostol 
alone: 17.6 hours, Foley alone: 17.7 hours, Table 2, Figure 2). The faster time to delivery for 
combined methods was observed in both nulliparous and multiparous women and remained 
true when analysis was restricted to women who had a vaginal delivery (Table 2). The 
proportion of women delivered by 24 hours and by 12 hours was significantly greater for the 
combined induction methods.
Assumptions for proportional hazard were met for all analyses. When censoring for cesarean 
delivery and adjusting for parity, the Foley–oxytocin group is no longer significantly faster 
than single agent methods and the misoprostol–Foley group is superior (Table 3). When 
using misoprostol alone or cervical Foley alone as the reference group, women with 
combined misoprostol–Foley are twice as likely to deliver earlier (HR 1.92, HR 1.87, 
respectively, Table 3). In other words, among women who have not yet delivered, women 
with misoprostol only or Foley only were almost 50% less likely to deliver before women 
with misoprostol–Foley concurrently (HR 0.52, HR 0.53, respectively). There was no 
significant difference between Foley–oxytocin and any of the three other groups.
There was no statistical difference in the cesarean delivery rate among the groups, both 
overall and when stratified by parity (Table 2). There were no statistically significant

 differences in the indication for cesarean delivery or the composite maternal morbidity 
among the four groups. There were no cases of thromboembolism, hysterectomy, intensive 
care unit admission, or death (Table 4).
There were no statistically significant differences in neonatal outcomes among the four 
groups. There were no cases of neonatal blood transfusion, hypoxic ischemic 
encephalopathy, intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or 4, necrotizing enterocolitis, or need 
for head cooling and therefore the initial a priori composite neonatal outcome was not 
evaluated (Table 4).
There were 31 (6.3%) women that received a different induction method than assigned by 
randomization. The main reasons for starting with a different agent were inability to place 
the cervical Foley or patient unable to tolerate Foley placement (n=9) and rapid 
advancement in cervical dilation from randomization to induction of labor, precluding the 
need for cervical ripening (n=10). There were 11 (2.2%) women that received the correct 
initial induction agent but had their method changed prior to active labor. When analyses 
were repeated using the “as treated” method, results were unchanged (data available upon 
request).
DISCUSSION
This randomized clinical trial compares four different labor induction methods in a head to 
head trial. After censoring for cesarean and adjusting for parity, we demonstrated 
misoprostol–cervical Foley to be the superior method, with women twice as likely to deliver 
before those who received either misoprostol alone (HR 1.92) or cervical Foley alone (HR 
1.87). Additionally, there were a higher proportion of women delivered by 12 hours and by 
24 hours with combination methods.
Our findings of a faster delivery with combined methods are consistent with other studies 67. 
However, these studies only included two treatment groups (one combination method, one 
single agent method). The optimal way to determine whether there is a superior method is to 
evaluate all four methods under the same conditions, in a head to head trial, as we have in 
our study. Additionally, in contrast to our study, previous studies that did not find a 
difference in time to delivery were limited by small sample size, different dosing of 
misoprostol, and heterogeneous labor management. 8–11
Our study has significant clinical implications for obstetrical care. Induction of labor is one 
of the most common procedures among pregnant women. Most recently, the induction rate 
in the United States was estimated to be 23.3%, 1 which equates to 932,000 women 
undergoing an induction annually. If combination methods were used for all of these 
women, there would be more than 3 million fewer hours, or more than 125,000 fewer days 
that women spend in labor in the US alone, which has large implications for healthcare 
utilization and delivery. The ability to shorten the length of time women spend in labor 
without increasing morbidity has large clinical and financial implications given the cost and 
known maternal–neonatal risks associated with both prolonged labor and cesarean delivery. 
Additionally, this may have an important impact on patient satisfaction as a recent survey of

 women’s experiences after an induction showed that 40% of women who underwent an 
induction stated that the speed of induction was the most important aspect of their induction 
they would have liked to have changed. 16
Strengths of this study include that it was a large, appropriately powered, randomized trial 
that compared, head to head, four common methods of induction. The management of 
induction and active labor was standardized so differences among the four methods can be 
attributed to the methods themselves and not the labor management. Our study took place at 
one institution that limits practice variation and more easily ensures compliance with the 
labor protocol. Additionally, we excluded very few indications for induction, increasing the 
generalizability of our findings.
Limitations are as follows: neither patients nor providers were blinded to the assigned 
treatment since examinations are required for placement of all methods. However, the use of 
labor protocols for all enrolled patients should have reduced variations in practice by the un-
blinded providers. Another important limitation of this study is that although we were 
powered to detect differences in time to delivery, for most outcomes, including cesarean 
delivery and maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, we lacked statistical power to discern 
potentially important differences across groups.
Future studies should focus on validating our findings in studies where protocols or patient 
populations may be different than those in the current study and should be large enough to 
evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes which could not be adequately evaluated in this 
study.
