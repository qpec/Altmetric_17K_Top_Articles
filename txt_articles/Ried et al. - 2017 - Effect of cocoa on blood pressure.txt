Background
High blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, contributing to about 50% of cardiovascular events worldwide
and 37% of cardiovascular-related deaths in Western populations. Epidemiological studies suggest that cocoa-rich products reduce the
risk of cardiovascular disease. Flavanols found in cocoa have been shown to increase the formation of endothelial nitric oxide which
promotes vasodilation and therefore blood pressure reduction. Here we update previous meta-analyses on the effect of cocoa on blood
pressure.
Objectives
To assess the effects on blood pressure of chocolate or cocoa products versus low-flavanol products or placebo in adults with or without
hypertension when consumed for two weeks or longer.
Search methods
Thisisanupdatedversionof the reviewinitiallypublishedin2012. In thisupdatedversion, we searchedthe followingelectronicdatabases
from inception to November 2016: Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We
also searched international trial registries, and the reference lists of review articles and included trials.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of chocolate or cocoa products on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
adults for a minimum of two weeks duration.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risks of bias in each trial. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses
on the included studies using Review Manager 5. We explored heterogeneity with subgroup analyses by baseline blood pressure, flavanol
content of control group, blinding, age and duration. Sensitivity analyses explored the influence of unusual study design.
Main results
Thirty-five trials (including 40 treatment comparisons) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, we added 17 trials (20 treatment compar-
isons) to the 18 trials (20 treatment comparisons) in the previous version of this updated review.

Effect of cocoa on blood pressure (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Trials provided participants with 30 to 1218 mg of flavanols (mean = 670 mg) in 1.4 to 105 grams of cocoa products per day in the
active intervention group. The control group received either a flavanol-free product (n = 26 treatment comparisons) or a low-flavanol-
containing cocoa powder (range 6.4 to 88 mg flavanols (mean = 55 mg, 13 treatment comparisons; 259 mg, 1 trial).
Meta-analyses of the 40 treatment comparisons involving 1804 mainly healthy participants revealed a small but statistically significant
blood pressure-reducing effect of flavanol-rich cocoa products compared with control in trials of two to 18 weeks duration (mean nine
weeks):
Mean difference systolic blood pressure (SBP) (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.76 (-3.09 to -0.43) mmHg, P = 0.009, n = 40 treatment
comparisons, 1804 participants;
Mean difference diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (95% CI): -1.76 (-2.57 to -0.94) mmHg, P < 0.001, n = 39 treatment comparisons,
1772 participants.
Baseline blood pressure may play a role in the effect of cocoa on blood pressure. While systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly
by 4 mmHg in hypertensive people (n = 9 treatment comparisons, 401 participants), and tended to be lowered in prehypertensive
people (n= 8 treatment comparisons, 340 participants), there was no significant difference in normotensive people (n = 23 treatment
comparisons, 1063 participants); however, the test for subgroup differences was of borderline significance (P = 0.08; I2 = 60%), requiring
further research to confirm the findings.
Subgroup meta-analysis by blinding suggested a trend towards greater blood pressure reduction in unblinded trials compared to double-
blinded trials, albeit statistically not significant. Further research is needed to confirm whether participant expectation may influence
blood pressure results. Subgroup analysis by type of control (flavanol-free versus low-flavanol control) did not reveal a significant
difference.
Whether the age of participants plays a role in the effect of cocoa on blood pressure, with younger participants responding with greater
blood pressure reduction, needs to be further investigated.
Sensitivity analysis excluding trials with authors employed by trials sponsoring industry (33 trials, 1482 participants) revealed a small
reduction in effect size, indicating some reporting bias.
Due to the remaining heterogeneity, which we could not explain in terms of blinding, flavanol content of the control groups, age of
participants, or study duration, we downgraded the quality of the evidence from high to moderate.
Results of subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution and need to be confirmed or refuted in trials using direct randomised
comparisons.
Generally, cocoa products were highly tolerable, with adverse effects including gastrointestinal complaints and nausea being reported by
1% of participants in the active cocoa intervention group and 0.4% of participants in the control groups (moderate-quality evidence).
Authors’ conclusions
This review provides moderate-quality evidence that flavanol-rich chocolate and cocoa products cause a small (2 mmHg) blood pressure-
lowering effect in mainly healthy adults in the short term.
These findings are limited by the heterogeneity between trials, which could not be explained by prespecified subgroup analyses, including
blinding, flavanol content of the control groups, age of participants, or study duration. However, baseline blood pressure may play a
role in the effect of cocoa on blood pressure; subgroup analysis of trials with (pre)hypertensive participants revealed a greater blood
pressure-reducing effect of cocoa compared to normotensive participants with borderline significance.
Long-term trials investigating the effect of cocoa on clinical outcomes are also needed to assess whether cocoa has an effect on
cardiovascular events and to assess potential adverse effects associated with chronic ingestion of cocoa products.

 We assessed the effect of cocoa products on blood pressure in adults when consumed daily for at least two weeks. We found 35 studies,
covering 40 treatment comparisons.
Background
Dark chocolate and cocoa products are rich in chemical compounds called flavanols. Flavanols have attracted interest as they might help
to reduce blood pressure, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (disorders of the heart and blood vessels). The blood pressure-
lowering properties of flavanols are thought to be related to widening of the blood vessels, caused by nitric oxide.
Study characteristics
Studies were short, mostly between two and12 weeks, with only one of 18 weeks. The studies involved 1804 mainly healthy adults.
They provided participants with 30 to 1218 mg of flavanols (average of 670 mg) in 1.4 to 105 grams of cocoa products per day in the
active intervention group. Seven of the studies were funded by companies with a commercial interest in their results, and the reported
effect was slightly larger in these studies, indicating possible bias. The evidence is current to November 2016.
Key results
Meta-analysis of 40 treatment comparisons revealed a small but statistically significant lowering of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
of 1.8 mmHg. This small reduction in blood pressure might complement other treatment options and might contribute to reducing
the risk of cardiovascular disease.
We investigated whether participants’ blood pressure at the start of the study, their age, an awareness of group allocation (active or
control), the flavanol content used in the control group, or how long the study lasted may explain variations between trials. While
blood pressure status (high blood pressure or normal blood pressure) is a likely factor in the effect size of cocoa on blood pressure, the
impact of other factors needs to be confirmed or rejected in further trials.
Side effects including digestive complaints and dislike of the trial product were reported by only 1% of people in the active cocoa
intervention group and 0.4% of people in the control groups.
Longer-term trials are needed to establish whether regularly eating flavanol-rich cocoa products has a beneficial effect on blood pressure
and cardiovascular health over time, and whether there are any side effects of long-term use of cocoa products on a daily basis.
Quality of evidence
The evidence is of moderate quality. We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials that tested the effect of long-term
daily use of cocoa products on blood pressure, and there were no trials that measured the health consequences of high blood pressure,
such as heart attacks or strokes.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1.Downgraded to moderate quality due to high heterogeneity which cannot be explained by subgroup analyses. SBP/ DBP: I2 =
87%/ 78%.
2.Good quality across 40 treatment comparisons. Only 5 trials (12.5%) had 2 items at high risk of bias, 19 trials (47.5%) had
1 item at high risk of bias, and 16 trials (40%) had no items at high risk of bias. 17 trials were unblinded or single-blinded.
7 industry-sponsored trials had authors employed by industry. Only 4 trials (10%) had more than 20% attrition. We explored
influence of trials with items at high risk of bias by subgroup and sensitivity analysis.
3.Statistically significant SBP: P = 0.009; DBP: P < 0.001.
4.Sensitivity analysis excluding treatment comparisons (n = 7) with authors employed by trials sponsoring industry revealed
reduced effect size and statistical significance.

Dark chocolate and flavanol-rich cocoa products have attracted in-
terest as an alternative treatment option for hypertension, a known
risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Even small reductions in
blood pressure may substantially reduce cardiovascular risk. Cur-
rent guidelines strongly recommend integration of lifestyle mod-
ification and complementary treatment with the use of conven-
tional blood pressure medications.
The interest in the effect of cocoa on blood pressure (BP) started
with the discovery that an island population in Central America,
the Kuna Indians, had a distinctively low rate of hypertension cou-
pled with a consistent healthy low blood pressure unaffected by age
(Hollenberg 2006; Kean 1944). The majority of the Kuna Indians
live on the San Blas Island off Panama (population approximately
35,000); those Kuna Indians who migrated to the mainland had
a higher prevalence of hypertension as well as an age-dependent
rise in blood pressure, implying that lifestyle factors such as diet
rather than genetics play a protective role (McCullough 2006).
Island-dwelling Kuna Indians consume about three to four cups
of cocoa drinks on average per day, while the mainland-dwelling
Kuna Indians consume up to 10 times less cocoa (McCullough
2006; Schroeter 2006). Average high salt intake was not associated
with the differences in blood pressure (McCullough 2006). Mean
blood pressure of the island-dwelling adult Kuna Indians hovers
around 110 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic, while on
the mainland the observed age-related rise in blood pressure and
prevalence of hypertension is comparable with that of Western
populations (Hollenberg 2006).
Description of the condition
High blood pressure is a critically important risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease, attributable for 47% of ischaemic heart disease
and 54% of stroke events worldwide (Lawes 2008). More than a
third (37%) of cardiovascular deaths are attributed to hyperten-
sion in Western populations (Martiniuk 2007), and 13.5% glob-
ally (Lawes 2008). The association between cardiovascular risk and
blood pressure levels is continuous (McInnes 2005) with the risk
of ischaemic heart disease and stroke halved for every 20 mmHg
reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 10 mmHg diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) (Lewington 2002). Even small reductions
in blood pressure may therefore reduce cardiovascular events at a
population level.
However, a steady increase in SBP with age is expected, whereas
DBP tends to fall after middle age, with studies in elderly and
middle-aged populations suggesting a nonlinear J- or U-shaped
relationship between blood pressure and mortality (Bangalore
2010; Denker 2013). Appropriate assessment of an individual’s
BP status is important to guide whether antihypertension therapy
is indicated or to avoid potential overtreatment.
Blood pressure levels are defined as:
Primary hypertension: SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mm-Hg
Prehypertension: SBP 120 - 139 mmHg or DBP 80 - 89 mmHg
Normotension:SBP<120mmHgorDBP<80mmHg, secondary
hypertension
Description of the intervention
Cocoa is extracted from cacao beans, the fatty seeds of the Theo-
broma cacao tree. Cocoa is rich in flavanols, particularly epicate-
chin, catechin and procyanidins, proposed to be responsible for
the blood pressure-lowering effect (Corti 2009; Heiss 2010a). Fla-
vanols are also found in other plant-derived produce, including
beans, apricots, blackberries, apples and tea leaves, albeit in a lower
concentration than in cocoa products (460 - 610 mg/kg of flavanol
monomers; 4 - 5 g/kg of flavanol polymers) (Fernandez-Murga
2011; Hammerstone 2000). Flavanol intake is, however, also de-
pendent on serving size, and flavanol content depends on the pro-
cessing of the cacao beans and raw cocoa.
Traditionally cocoa was consumed as a cold unsweetened drink
of raw dried cacao powder, often mixed with starch and spices
by the native Latin-American Indians, but this was considered
bitter and unpalatable by the early European explorers, including
Christopher Columbus in 1502 and Hernando Cortes in 1519.
The Spanish broughtcocoatoEurope,addedsugarto itandheated
the drink(Dillinger 2000; Lippi 2009). Subsequentroasting(upto
120 °C), mixing (conching), alkalising (dutching), adding sugar,
milk, vanilla and lecithin emulsifiers make chocolate as we know it
today (Beckett 2008). Various chocolate manufacturers have fine-
tuned the processing, leading to different flavours and smoothness
of chocolates, but also to altered cocoa and flavanol content in
various cocoa products.
Dark chocolate contains larger amounts of cocoa (50% - 85%)
than milk chocolate (20% - 30%). Different processes influence
the flavanol content of the cocoa in the chocolate; a 70% cocoa-
containing chocolate bar from one company therefore might not
contain the same amount of flavanols and flavanol composition as
a 70% chocolate bar from another company. Content and com-
position of flavanols depend on the variety and ripeness of cocoa
beans used, as well as the manufacturing steps.
Fresh and fermented cocoa beans contain about 10% of flavanols
(100 mg/g). The cocoa powder consumed by the Kuna Indians
contains about 3.6% of flavanols, and cocoa-rich dark chocolate
on the market about 0.5% of flavanols (Chaitman 2006; Chevaux
2001). Moreover, heavy dutching (the alkalising of chocolate to
pH 7 - 8) can reduce the flavanol content to less than 10 mg per
100 grams (0.001%).
Research suggests that the monomeric portion of cocoa flavanols,
epicatechin and catechin and to a lesser extent the polymeric fla-
vanols, the procyanidins, are linked to blood pressure and vasoac-
tive effects (Schroeter 2006). Modern processing of cacao reduces
the monomeric flavanol content and influences the epicatechin/
catechinratio(Payne 2010). Fresh andfermentedcocoabeanscon-

 tain between 2.5 and 16.5 mg of epicatechin per gram, depending
on the variety, the growing region and harvesting practices (Kim
1984; Wollgast 2000), whereas processed cocoa retains only 2%
- 18% of the original epicatechin, due to roasting and dutching
(Payne 2010). Because of the large variation in flavanol content in
chocolate and cocoa products, it is critical to compare the dosages
of flavanols rather than simply the amounts of chocolate or ad-
ministered cocoa products in clinical trials investigating the effect
of cocoa on blood pressure.
How the intervention might work
The blood pressure-lowering properties of cocoa have been linked
to the formation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) which promotes
vasodilation and consequently lowers blood pressure. Increased
NO production might be triggered by upregulation of NO-syn-
thase through the insulin-mediated signalling pathway (Addison
2008). Insulin sensitivity has been shown to be improved after
cocoa intake in a number of trials (Davison 2008a; Faridi 2008;
Grassi 2005a; Grassi 2008), although Muniyappa 2008 did not
confirm this. Secondly, cocoa flavanols have been shown to inhibit
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and hence reduce
blood pressure (Actis-Goretta 2006; Persson 2011). Thirdly, there
is evidence to suggest that cocoa flavanols have an indirect antiox-
idant effect within the cardiovascular system, upregulating NO-
synthase activity and hence reducing blood pressure (Fraga 2011;
Keen 2005).
Why it is important to do this review
In the last decade, several clinical trials have investigated the ef-
fect of chocolate and cocoa products on blood pressure. This sys-
tematic review updates previous meta-analyses by Taubert 2007a
(including five trials), Desch 2010a (10 trials), Ried 2010 (15
trials), and updates a previous version of this Cochrane Review
(20 treatment comparisons) (Ried 2012). In addition, we explore
the influence of baseline blood pressure, type of control (flavanol
dosage), age, duration, and trial quality, in particular blinding, on
blood pressure outcomes.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled parallel or cross-over, single-blind, dou-
ble-blind or open-label trials of 14 days or longer duration that
reported the clinical mean or median with or without standard
deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) SBP or DBP at baseline,
before and after intervention.
Types of participants
Adults, with no further restrictions.
Types of interventions
We included trials if the control group received an intervention,
e.g. a placebo or a minimal dose of flavanol-containing cocoa prod-
uct.
We excluded:
1. Trials in which the control dose exceeds 25% cocoa
polyphenols of the active dose
2. Trials testing isolated flavanols on blood pressure
3. Trials with a very high attrition rate (loss to follow-up
greater than 50%)
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
Difference between cocoa and control group in systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressure at final follow-up, and adjusted for baseline
differences.
Secondary outcomes
Number of participants who withdrew due to adverse effects or
intolerance, and total adverse events.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following electronic databases on OVID for pri-
mary studies:
1. Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register (1948 -
Nov 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 - Nov 2016),
Embase (1980 - Nov 2016), and Food Science and Technology
Abstracts (1969 - Nov 2016).

 trials.com; www.apps.who.int/trialsearch/WHO clinical trials)
for unpublished but completed studies investigating chocolate/
cocoa for blood pressure.
We searched the electronic databases using a strategy combin-
ing the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying
randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximising version
(2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free-text terms,
including cocoa, chocolate, blood pressure, and hypertension,
with no language restrictions. The MEDLINE search strategy
(Appendix 1) was translated into the Hypertension Group Spe-
cialised Register (Appendix 2), CENTRAL (Appendix 3), Em-
base (Appendix 4), and Food Science and Technology Abstracts
(Appendix 5), using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as ap-
plicable, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness
(DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for re-
lated reviews.
Searching other resources
1. We identified reference lists of all papers and relevant
reviews.
2. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding any
further published or unpublished work.
3. We searched ISI Web of Science for papers which cite
studies included in the review.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts of
search results for relevant articles, and critically appraised the full
text of relevant articles according to the inclusion criteria listed
above. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors independently extracted data using a stan-
dardised data extraction form and then cross-checked them.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors assessed the risks of bias for each trial by using
the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias. This covers random
sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (se-
lection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective
reporting (reporting bias), blinding of participants and personnel
(performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection
bias), and source of funding (other bias).
Measures of treatment effect
Mean difference in SBP/DBP in mmHg at final follow-up, ad-
justed for baseline differences. We estimated the precision of mean
differences as the standard deviation (SD) at final follow-up.
When blood pressure measurements were reported in more than
one position, the order of preference was: 1) sitting; 2) standing;
and 3) supine.
When both clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurements
were available, the order of preference was: 1) clinical; 2) ambula-
tory.
Unit of analysis issues
If results are reported for several periods of follow-up, we preferred
the longest follow-up from each study for comparison with base-
line.
We conducted meta-analysis of cross-over trials by the generic
invariance method, using mean differences and standard errors
between outcome measurements (blood pressure) of experimental
(cocoa) versus control groups. We extracted the mean (SE) blood
pressure before and after intervention from tables, graphs, and text
from individual studies included in the meta-analysis.
In multiple-arm studies, we included only the intervention arms
and their comparable control arms in the meta-analysis. Compara-
ble intervention/control groups in multiple-arm studies may have
been stratified by age, body mass index (BMI), or blood mark-
ers. We avoided double-counting of individual participants in the
meta-analysis.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted the authors of studies with missing information on
mean SBP/DBP or SD or both in intervention and control groups
and asked them to provide the missing data.
If standard errors were given instead of standard deviations, we
calculated standard deviations at one time point with the formula
SD = SE x square root of n. We assumed a correlation of 0.68
betweenthe final follow-upSBP/DBPresultsforthe twotreatment
arms in a cross-over trial, similar to previous meta-analyses by
Taubert 2007a and Desch 2010a.
If both standard deviations and standard errors were missing, we
imputed standard deviations based on the information in the same
trial or from other trials using the same intervention. We used the
following hierarchy to impute standard deviation values:
1. standard deviation of blood pressure at end of treatment
taken in a different position from that of the blood pressure data
used
2. standard deviation of blood pressure at baseline
3. mean standard deviation of blood pressure at end of
treatment from other trials using the same intervention

 Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed heterogeneity by the I2 statistic (Higgins 2003). We
testedthe followingvariablesbysubgroupanalyses: baseline SBPor
DBP
, dosage of flavanols in the control group, age, study duration,
and blinding.
Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed small-study effects by funnel plots.
Data synthesis
For each study, we recorded the number of participants, mean dif-
ference, andthe SEof interventionandcontrol groupsinCochrane
Review Manager 5 software. We used the generic inverse variance
method to combine both parallel-group and cross-over trials, and
the random-effects model to incorporate heterogeneity.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We required at least four studies to conduct subgroup analysis.
We performed the following subgroup analyses:
1. Baseline SBP ≥ 140 mmHg versus SBP 130 - 140 versus
SBP < 130 mmHg
2. Baseline DBP ≥ 80 mmHg versus DBP < 80 mmHg
3. Flavanol-free control versus low flavanol control
4. Double-blind versus single-blind/unblinded trials
5. Mean age < 50 years versus ≥ 50 years
6. Trial duration two to four weeks versus more than four
weeks
We considered evidence of the differences found between sub-
groups to be stronger when the variation of the mean effects in
the different subgroups was higher, as measured by the I2statistic
for subgroup differences (e.g. I2 = 90% was considered more sig-
nificant than I2 = 70%).
Sensitivity analysis
We tested the robustness of the results using the following sensi-
tivity analyses:
Exclusion of trials using a unique study design compared to other
trials (e.g. high flavanol content in the control group (20% - 25%)
compared to active group, close to threshold level for excluded
trials (> 25% flavanol content in control group).
’Summary of findings’ table
The Summary of findings for the main comparison summarises
the magnitude of the effect of cocoa on systolic and diastolic
blood pressure of the 35 RCTs including 40 treatment compar-
isons and 1804 adults, and rates the quality of the evidence using
the GRADE system, by assessing potential within-study biases and
between-study heterogeneity (Guyatt 2008).

Description of studies
Results of the search
The updated Cochrane search strategy (inception to October
2015) using Scopus, PubMed and Embase, identified 254 poten-
tially relevant publications which we assessed at the title/abstract
level,in addition to the 136 articles in the previous review. Of 26
new potentially relevant trials (in 27 articles) assessed at the full-
text level, 17 new trials (20 new treatment comparisons, active vs
control) met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Adding these
to the 20 treatment comparisons in 18 trials from the previous
version of this review (Ried 2012) gives a total of 40 treatment
comparisons (from 35 trials) in the updated meta-analysis. (Figure
1).

 Included studies
We include 35 trials involving 1804 participants in this updated
review.
Of the 35 trials, five contained two treatment arms with com-
parable non-overlapping control groups, resulting in 40 bring-
ing the number of treatment comparisons in the updated re-
view. Trials with multiple treatment arms provided results strat-
ified on the basis of blood pressure (normotensive/hypertensive)
(Grassi 2005a), exercise (treatment only or in addition to exercise)
(Davison 2008a), BMI (< 25, > 25 kg/m2) (Almoosawi 2012a),
cholesterol (high, normal) (Sarria 2014), or age (young, elderly)
(Heiss 2015a).
Eleven trials used commercially available chocolate and 24 trials
used flavanol-rich cocoa powder (tablet, bar, or powder mixed with
water or milk) and compared the effect to a control group, which
either took flavanol-free placebo (white chocolate, milk or placebo
pill) or low-flavanol powder. The active intervention group re-
ceived either dark chocolate of 3.6 to 105 grams (6 grams are equal
to one piece of a 100-gram dark chocolate bar) containing 50%
to 90% cocoa, milk chocolate-based confectionary (105 grams of
< 10% cocoa) or flavanol-enriched cocoa powder, containing a
dosage of 30 to 1218 mg (mean = 670 mg) of flavanols per day.
Trials ran between two weeks and 12 weeks, with a single trial ran
18 weeks.
Excluded studies
We excluded 24 trials from our meta-analysis, because:
1. Trials investigated the acute effects within two hours after
cocoa ingestion (n = 2)
2. The intervention period was less than two weeks (n = 7)
3. Trials did not have a true control group (n = 6)
4. The intervention was cocoa plus another active ingredient
(n = 3)
5. Data required for meta-analysis were not available (n = 5)
6. The trial was of low quality (n = 1)
See Figure 1; Characteristics of excluded studies table.
Ongoing studies
Eleven unpublished trials were identified in trial registries, they
were either not completed at time of meta-analysis or data were
not yet available (Characteristics of ongoing studies).
Studies awaiting classification
Eightrecentadditional studieswere foundjust before finalizing the
updated review for publication (Characteristics of studies awaiting
classification). These could potentially meet the inclusion criteria
but in order to establish that it would require careful assessment.
We chose not to include these studies in this update to avoid
further delays in publication, but this will be done in a future
update.

 Allocation
Random sequence generation
Sixteen trials adequately described random sequence generation
(Bogaard 2010; Crews 2008; Davison 2010; Desideri 2012;
Esser 2014; Ibero-Baraibar 2014; Massee 2015; Mogollon 2013;
Muniyappa 2008; Neufingerl 2013; Njike 2011; Ried 2009;
Rostami 2015; Rull 2015; Sansone 2015; Taubert 2007).
Random sequence generation was unclear in 19 trials (Al-Faris
2008; Almoosawi 2012a (two treatment comparisons); Davison
2008a (two treatment comparisons); Engler 2004; Fraga 2005;
Grassi 2005a (two treatment comparisons); Grassi 2008; Heiss
2010; Heiss 2015a (two treatment comparisons); Khan 2012;
Koli 2015; Mastroiacovo 2015; Monagas 2009; Murphy 2003;
Nickols-Richardson 2014; Sarria 2014 (two treatment compar-
isons); Shiina 2009; Sorond 2013; Taubert 2003).
Allocation concealment
Eighteen trials described adequate allocation concealment (
Bogaard 2010; Crews 2008; Davison 2010; Desideri 2012; Esser
2014; Fraga 2005; Grassi 2008; Heiss 2015a (two treatment
comparisons); Massee 2015; Mogollon 2013; Monagas 2009;
Muniyappa 2008; Neufingerl 2013; Ried 2009; Rostami 2015;
Sansone 2015; Taubert 2007).
Seventeen trials provided insufficient information regarding allo-
cation concealment (Al-Faris 2008; Almoosawi 2012a; Davison
2008a (two treatment comparisons); Engler 2004; Grassi
2005a (two treatment comparisons); Heiss 2010; Ibero-Baraibar
2014; Khan 2012; Mastroiacovo 2015; Murphy 2003; Nickols-
Richardson 2014; Njike 2011; Rull 2015; Sarria 2014 (two treat-
ment comparisons); Shiina 2009; Sorond 2013; Taubert 2003).
Allocation was unconcealed in one trial (Koli 2015).
Blinding
Performance bias
Unblinded/ single-blinded trials
Thirteen trials compared the cocoa group with unblinded controls
using commercially available white chocolate, or only milk or wa-
ter (Al-Faris 2008; Fraga 2005; Grassi 2005a (two treatment com-
parisons); Grassi 2008; Khan 2012; Koli 2015; Monagas 2009;
Nickols-Richardson 2014; Rostami 2015; Sarria 2014 (two treat-
ment comparisons); Shiina 2009; Taubert 2003; Taubert 2007).
One trial (Almoosawi 2012a; two treatment comparisons) re-
ported a single-blind design, with participants but not investiga-
tors probably blinded, as the placebo dark chocolate was matched
in taste, texture, colour and macronutrient composition.
Double-blinded trials
Thirteen trials used a low-flavanol cocoa product as the control
aiming to facilitate ‘blinding’ or ‘masking’ of participants to min-
imise any expectation bias or placebo effect (Crews 2008; Davison
2008a (two treatment comparisons); Davison 2010; Desideri
2012; Esser 2014; Heiss 2010; Mastroiacovo 2015; Mogollon
2013; Muniyappa 2008; Murphy 2003; Njike 2011; Rull 2015;
Sorond 2013).
Eight trials used a blinded design with flavanol-free control groups
(Bogaard 2010; Engler 2004; Heiss 2015a (two treatment com-
parisons); Ibero-Baraibar 2014; Massee 2015; Neufingerl 2013;
Ried 2009; Sansone 2015).
Blinding was achieved in seven of the eight trials by matching taste,
colour, texture, energy and nutrient components of the cocoa and
placebo products. In addition, one trial (Ried 2009) compared
the effect on blood pressure of dark chocolate or tomato extract
capsules with placebo capsules. In this trial, blinding of the control
group but not the dark chocolate group was assured, as participants
in the control group did not know if they were allocated into an
active or placebo capsule group.
Detection bias
One trial (Almoosawi 2012a; two treatment comparisons) re-
ported adequate outcome assessment (n = 21), or did not report
details but used standard blood pressure monitoring procedures
(n = 16).
Incomplete outcome data
All but three trials (Davison 2008a (two treatment comparisons);
Muniyappa 2008; Rull 2015) had less than 20% attrition.
Selective reporting
None of the trials was biased due to selective reporting. However,
industry-funding may have introduced a bias.
Other potential sources of bias
We found a small risk of publication bias, with slightly asymmet-
rical funnel plots, probably due to high heterogeneity of the 35
trials included in the meta-analysis.
Involvement of industry-sponsored studies may have influenced
results. We therefore conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding
trials (n = 6 trials) in which authors were employed by industry
(Desideri 2012; Fraga 2005; Heiss 2010; Heiss 2015a (two com-
parisons); Mastroiacovo 2015; Sansone 2015) (see Analysis 7.1
and Analysis 7.2).

Baseline blood pressure - hypertensive, prehypertensive, nor-
motensive
The previous versions of our review had revealed a difference in
effect of cocoa products on blood pressure, depending on hyper-
tension status at baseline. While blood pressure was significantly
lowered in people with systolic hypertension (≥ 140 mmHg) or
diastolic prehypertension (≥ 80 mmHg), there was no significant
effect of cocoa on people with normal blood pressure (120/80
mmHg) (Ried 2010; Ried 2012).
Systolic blood pressure
The updated meta-analysis (Analysis 2.1; Figure 5) shows a signif-
icant systolic blood pressure-reducing effect in the hypertensive
subgroup, a trend towards blood pressure reduction in the pre-
hypertensive subgroup, and a small non-significant effect in the
normotensive subgroup:

 Hypertensive subgroup (baseline SBP > 140 mmHg): mean SBP
difference (95% CI): -4.00 (-6.71 to -1.30) mmHg, P = 0.004, 9
comparisons, 401 participants;
Prehypertensive subgroup (baseline SBP > 130 mmHg): mean
SBP difference (95% CI): -2.43 (-5.02 to 0.17) mmHg, P = 0.07,

Normotensive subgroup (baseline SBP < 130 mm Hg): mean SBP
difference (95% CI): -0.65 (-2.13 to 0.84) mmHg, P = 0.39, 23

The ’Testforsubgroupdifferences’ (hypertensive/prehypertensive/
normotensive) provided a trend between the subgroups with bor-
derline significance: SBP: I2 = 60%, P = 0.08.
Notably, effect sizes in the hypertensive and prehypertensive sub-
groups were larger than the effect size of the main meta-analysis
including 40 trial comparisons (mean SBP differences (SE): -1.76
(1.3) mmHg).
Diastolic blood pressure
None of the trials in this meta-analysis involved participants with

Effect of cocoa on blood pressure (Review)

 While a significant effect of cocoa on DBP was evident in both
subgroups, there was no difference between the subgroups (I2 =
0%, P = 0.64).
Prehypertensive subgroup (baseline DBP > 80 mmHg): mean
DBP difference (95% CI): -1.98 (-3.38 to -0.57) mmHg, P =
0.006, 16 comparisons, 735 participants;
Normotensive subgroup (baseline DBP < 80 mmHg): mean DBP
difference (95% CI): -1.57 (-2.54 to -0.61) mmHg, P = 0.001,
23 comparisons, 1037 participants.
Dosage of flavanols and type of control group
Dosage of flavanol content was determined by two common stan-
dardised methods (Adamson 1999; Singleton 1965). We are rea-
sonably confident that flavanol dosages are comparable.
Trials provided participants in the active group with 30 to 1218
mg of flavanols (mean = 670 mg) in 3.6 to 105 grams of cocoa
products per day. The control group received either a flavanol-free
product (n = 26 treatment comparisons) or a low-flavanol cocoa
powder (n = 14 treatment comparisons). Flavanol dosage of low-
flavanol products in the control group ranged between 6.4 and 88
mg (mean = 45 mg), with one trial (Esser 2014) providing 259
mg flavanols in the control group per day.
Meta-analysis 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 of trials with true (flavanol-free)
control groups revealed a significant blood pressure-reducing ef-
fect:
Mean difference SBP (95% CI): -1.80 (-3.46 to -0.13) mmHg, P
= 0.03, 26 comparisons, 1116 participants;
Mean difference DBP (95% CI): -1.82 (-2.95 to -0.68) mmHg,
P = 0.002, 26 comparisons, 1116 participants.
Subgroup 3.1.2 and 3.2.2 analysis of trials with low-flavanol con-
trol groups provided similar effect sizes:
Mean difference SBP (95% CI): -1.67 (-4.03 to 0.69) mmHg, P
= 0.17, 14 comparisons, 688 participants;
Mean difference DBP (95% CI): -1.62 (-2.56 to -0.68) mmHg,
P < 0.001, 13 comparisons, 656 participants.
Similarity of subgroup findings was confirmed with the ’Test for
subgroup differences’ (flavanol-free trials compared with low fla-
vanol trials):
I2 = 0%, P = 0.9 (no heterogeneity, no difference).
Sensitivity analysis of subgroup 2 (low-flavanol control group)
excluding the trial with very high flavanol content in the control
group (Esser 2014), 1078 mg (active) versus 259 mg (24% of
flavanol in the active group), did not change results appreciably.
Mean difference SBP (95% CI): -1.73 (-4.35 to 0.90) mmHg, P
= 0.20, 13 comparisons, 606 participants;
Mean difference DBP (95% CI): -1.71 (-2.77 to -0.65) mmHg,
P = 0.002, 12 comparisons, 1690 participants.
Participants in nine of the 14 trials using low-flavanol control
groups received higher or similar dosages of flavanols (33 - 259 mg
flavanols) (Crews 2008; Davison 2008a; Davison 2010; Desideri
2012; Esser 2014; Mastroiacovo 2015; Mogollon 2013; Rull
2015) than the active intervention group in the trial by Taubert
2007 (30 mg flavanols; 0 mg flavanol control).
Blinding
We investigated whether blinding of participants and investigators
may have played a role in the overall effect.
Subgroup analysis 4.1.1 and 4.2.1 of double-blind trials provided
a small effect size:
Mean difference SBP (95% CI): -0.95 (-2.77 to 0.86) mm Hg, P
= 0.30, 23 comparisons, 1059 participants;
Mean difference DBP (95% CI): -1.16 (-2.05 to -0.27) mm Hg,
P = 0.01, 21 comparisons, 927 participants.
In contrast, subgroup analysis 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 of unblinded and
single-blinded trials revealed a greater effect size:
Mean difference SBP (95% CI): -2.71 (-4.66 to -0.76) mmHg, P
< 0.001, 17 comparisons, 745 participants;
Mean difference DBP (95% CI): -2.33 (-3.62 to -1.04) mmHg,
P < 0.001, 18 comparisons, 845 participants.
Nine out of the 23 comparisons (39%) in the double-blind sub-
group had flavanol-free (0 mg) control groups, so differences be-
tween the blinding subgroups cannot be explained only by the
type of control group. Instead, small changes in blood pressure can
easily be influenced by participant expectation, as well as outcome
measurement by unblinded investigators.
However, the ’Test for subgroup differences’ (double-blinded ver-
sus unblinded/single-blinded) did not provide sufficient evidence
foragenuine difference betweenthe subgroupsof SBP: I2 =40.4%,
P = 0.20.
Age
Subgroup differences by age were not statistically significant (I2 =
0%, P = 0.6).
Subgroup analysis 5.1.1 and 5.2.1 of trials with younger partici-
pants (< 50 years):
Mean difference SBP (95% CI): -1.79 (-4.05 to 0.48) mmHg, P
= 0.12, 18 comparisons, 726 participants;
Mean difference DBP (95% CI): -2.01 (-3.45 to -0.58) mmHg,
P 0.006, 18 comparisons, 726 participants.
Subgroup analysis 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of trials with older participants
(≥ 50 years):
Mean difference SBP (95% CI): -0.98 (-2.87 to 0.90) mmHg, P
= 0.30, 20 comparisons, 1036 participants;
Mean difference DBP (95% CI): -1.28 (-2.32 to -0.24) mmHg,
P = 0.02, 19 comparisons, 962 participants.
One trial (Almoosawi 2012a; 2 treatment comparisons) did not
provide participants’ age details and was therefore excluded from

 this subgroup analysis.
Duration
24 treatment comparisons were of two to four weeks duration,
while 16 treatment comparisons were of six to 18 weeks duration
(mean = 9 weeks).
We found no statistically significant difference between the sub-
groups by duration (I2 = 0%, P = 0.5).
Subgroup analysis 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 of trials of two to four weeks
duration:
Mean SBP difference (95% CI): -1.37 (-3.23 to 0.49) mmHg, P
= 0.15, 24 comparisons, 1043 participants;
Mean DBP difference (95% CI): -1.55 (-2.71 to -0.39) mmHg,
P = 0.009, 23 comparisons, 1011 participants.
Subgroup analysis 6.1.2 and 6.2.2 of trials of 6 to 18 weeks du-
ration:
Mean SBP difference (95% CI): -2.37 (-4.30 to -0.44) mmHg, P
= 0.02, 16 comparisons, 761 participants;
Mean DBP difference (95% CI): -2.04 (-3.18 to -0.91) mmHg,
P < 0.001, 16 comparisons, 761 participants.
Analysis 6.1; Analysis 6.2
Sensitivity analyses of all trials excluding those in which au-
thors were employed by industry (n = 6) revealed a marked dif-
ference in results, reducing effect sizes and statistical significance,
in particular for systolic blood pressure.
Mean difference SBP (95% CI): -1.08 (-2.60 to 0.43) mmHg, P
= 0.16, 33 comparisons, 1482 participants;
Mean difference DBP (95% CI): -1.37 (-2.31 to -0.43) mmHg,
P = 0.004, 33 comparisons, 1482 participants.
Analysis 7.1; Analysis 7.2
Summary of secondary outcomes
We did not meta-analyse withdrawals and adverse effects across
trials, but we summarise them in Table 1.
Four trials did not provide any information on reasons for with-
drawals or adverse effects (Rostami 2015; Rull 2015; Sansone
2015; Sarria 2014).
Out of 31 comparisons (1514 participants, cocoa groups: n = 760;
control groups: n = 754) which provided information on with-
drawals and adverse effects, eight trials reported no withdrawals
and no adverse effects (Engler 2004; Grassi 2005a; Grassi 2008;
Heiss 2015a; Koli 2015; Nickols-Richardson 2014; Taubert 2003;
Taubert 2007).
In the remaining 23 comparisons, reasons for withdrawal included
personal and trial-unrelated reasons or adverse effects.
Withdrawals due to adverse effects were reported in nine trials
(Bogaard 2010; Crews 2008; Davison 2010; Desideri 2012; Esser
2014; Khan 2012; Mogollon 2013; Neufingerl 2013; Ried 2009),
including gastrointestinal complaints (cocoa groups: n = 8/760
(1%), control groups: n = 3/754 (0.4%)); dislike of the trial prod-
uct (cocoa: n = 4/760; control: n = 1/754), headache (cocoa: n
= 2/760; control: n = 1/754), and jitteriness (cocoa: n = 1/760,
control: n = 0/754).
The product with a high theobromine content in one trial
(Bogaard 2010) had a laxative effect (cocoa: n = 12/41, control:
n = 2/41), but the affected participants completed the trial. In-
terestingly, two additional study groups in Neufingerl 2013, not
included in this review, tested high theobromine content (850 mg
or 1000 mg) and reported a high incidence of nausea, vomiting,
headache, and diarrhoea (n = 7/20 participants).
While the potential effect on blood pressure is rather small, cocoa
may have other cardiovascular benefits, including improved en-
dothelial function and reduced vascular stiffness (Davison 2008a;
Engler 2004; Grassi 2005a; Grassi 2008; Heiss 2010; Heiss 2015a;
Mogollon 2013; Sansone 2015; Shiina 2009), as well as improved
glucose metabolism and reduced insulin resistance, in particular
in overweight or obese individuals (Almoosawi 2012a; Desideri
2012; Grassi 2005a; Grassi 2008; Mastroiacovo 2015; Muniyappa
2008; Nickols-Richardson 2014). It may reduce triglyceride levels
and oxidised LDL-cholesterol (Almoosawi 2012a; Ibero-Baraibar
2014; Khan 2012; Rostami 2015; Sarria 2014), decrease platelet
aggregation (Murphy 2003; Rull 2015), reduce inflammation
(Esser 2014; Monagas 2009), and improve cognitive function
(Desideri 2012; Massee 2015; Mastroiacovo 2015; Sorond 2013).

Summary of main results
Our updated meta-analysis of 35 short-term trials with 40 treat-
ment comparisons involving 1804 mainly healthy individuals sug-
gests flavanol-rich cocoa products (mean 670 mg flavanols) to have
a small but statistically significant effect in reducing blood pressure
compared with control by 1.8 mmHg.
Heterogeneity was generally high. We explored reasons for hetero-
geneity in subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
Whilst subgroup meta-analyses by baseline blood pressure indi-
cated a larger average effect of cocoa in systolic hypertension com-
pared with systolic prehypertension or normotension, the test for
interaction was of borderline significance (Test for subgroups dif-
ferences: I2 = 60%, P = 0.08). Further studies with hypertensive
people are needed to confirm any significant interaction between
baseline blood pressure and effect size.
A significant blood pressure-lowering effect of cocoa was evident
in diastolic blood pressure, independent of status at baseline.
We investigated whether blinding may play a role. While meta-
analysis of trials with unblinded/single-blinded trials revealed a
greater systolic blood pressure-reducing effect, compared to dou-
ble-blinded trials, the test for subgroup differences was statistically
not significant. In addition, any differences cannot be explained
by the type of control alone (flavanol-free versus low flavanol
control ), and may suggest an influence of participant expectations
when unblinded to the intervention.

Effect of cocoa on blood pressure (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 We foundthe effectof cocoatobe slightlyattenuatedbyage, sothat
blood pressure reduction tended to be greater in younger individ-
uals (mean age range 18 to 49 yrs; 18 trials) compared with older
individuals (mean age range 50 to 73 yrs; 20 trials). While there
was no statistically significance difference between subgroups, an
age-related difference in the effect of cocoa on blood pressure is
biologically plausible. The age-related effect might be associated
with structural and biochemical changes in the arterial wall asso-
ciated with aging (O’Rourke 1990) and subsequent vascular re-
activity to stimuli. Age-related changes include arterial stiffening
together with decrease of elastin, and increase of collagen and gly-
cosaminoglycans (O’Rourke 1990). In addition, endothelin-1, a
potent vasoconstrictor protein, is elevated in older adults (Donato
2009) and endothelial oxidative stress compromising nitric oxide
availability is more pronounced in the elderly (Taddei 2001). Co-
coa flavanols have been shown to reduce vascular resistance and
arterial stiffness, and are potent scavengers of free radicals (Loke
2008; Schroeter2006), which may lead to improved vascular func-
tion. In the short-term studies included in our review the effect of
cocoa on blood pressure might be more pronounced in younger
individuals, due to the age-related decrease in vascular reactivity
to physiological stimuli such as cocoa flavanols.
Trial duration slightly influenced results, with greater effect sizes
observed in the longer trials of six to 18 weeks compared to the
shorter trials of two to four weeks, albeit not a statistically signifi-
cant difference.
In this review, we assessed the flavanol content of cocoa products.
Cocoa also contains the stimulant theobromine, which has been
suggested to affect vasoactivity and thus blood pressure reduction
in cocoa products (Kelly2005). Theobromine is the bitter alkaloid
of the cacao plant, and is also found in other plants, such as tea
and the cola nut. Other similar compounds, the methylxanthines,
include caffeine in coffee. However, analysis of the effect of cocoa
on blood pressure by theobromine content was hindered by the
lack of reporting of the theobromine content in a number of trials.
Instead, ingestion of higher concentrations of theobromine have
been associated with a higher rate of adverse effects, in particular
nausea,vomiting, dizziness, anddiarrhoea,asreportedinanumber
of trials.
It is also questionable whether chocolate and cocoa products are
palatable if large amounts of theobromine are included. While
some animals, such as dogs, might succumb to theobromine poi-
soning from as little as 50 grams of chocolate for a smaller dog
and 400 grams for an average-sized dog due to slow metabolism of
theobromine (Strachan 1994), it is estimated that a 60 kg human
would need to consume about 4.5 kg of dark chocolate containing
natural theobromine to be poisoned (Rusconi 2010).
Sensitivity analysis of 33 treatment comparisons, excluding those
with at least one of the authors employed by the trial sponsoring
industry and with a commercial interest in the test cocoa product,
revealed a reduced effect size and reduced statistical significance,
alerting to a potential bias in reporting of results, and may explain
some of the heterogeneity.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Data were available for the 35 identified trials with 40 treatment
comparisons fitting the inclusion criteria. We excluded two tri-
als due to lack of data (Balzer 2008; Farouque 2006). Most trials
studied healthy people with or without elevated blood pressure,
including one trial of healthy pregnant women (Mogollon 2013).
One trial (Heiss 2010) included people with coronary artery dis-
ease, three trials assessed individuals with impaired glucose toler-
ance or diabetes (Grassi 2008; Khan 2012; Rostami 2015), and
one trial studied elderly people with mild cognitive impairment
(Desideri 2012). Our findings are therefore applicable largely to
healthy adults with or without hypertension. Our review included
all types of cocoa products.
Our meta-analysis contributes to the evidence for flavanol-rich
cocoa products being beneficial to cardiovascular health, albeit
a modest effect. No long-term trials investigating the effect of
cocoa products on clinical outcomes are available to shed light on
the effects of cocoa on cardiovascular events or long-term adverse
effects.
Quality of the evidence
We found a sufficient number of trials (35, with 40 treatment
comparisons) and a reasonably large sample size (1804 partici-
pants) to generate meaningful meta-analysis and to allow several
subgroup analyses, exploring heterogeneity. Because of the large
number of trials, many of high quality, and despite unexplained
high heterogeneity, we consider the quality of the evidence to be
moderate (Summary of findings for the main comparison). We
explored heterogeneity in several subgroup analyses with a reason-
able number of trials.
Potential biases in the review process
A strength of this updated review is the comprehensive literature
search including several databases, trial registries and reference lists
of included trials.
While we investigated heterogeneity in several subgroup analyses,
we could not fully explain the variations in effect of cocoa on blood
pressure. Continuing high levels of heterogeneity within subgroup
analyses suggest that there may be a combination of factors, or
additional ones beyond those we considered. It is possible that
subgroups by age and hypertension status at baseline might be
subject to ecological bias. The effect we found between studies
might not hold within studies. However, analysis of individual
patient data was not an approach that we adopted for this review.

 studies or reviews
While the effect on cocoa on systolic blood pressure is signifi-
cant, noticeably, the effect sizes became smaller with the increas-
ing number of studies compared to previous meta-analyses. It is
likely that a larger sample size provided a more unbiased result by
reducing the influence of individual studies.

Implications for practice
Our updated review provides moderate-quality evidence that fla-
vanol-rich chocolate and cocoa products lower both systolic and
diastolic blood pressure in mainly healthy adults by an average of
1.8 mmHg in the short term.
Our findings are limited by the heterogeneity between trials, which
could not be explained by prespecified subgroup analyses, includ-
ing blinding, flavanol content of the control groups, age of partic-
ipants, or study duration. However, baseline blood pressure may
play a role in the effect of cocoa on blood pressure, with subgroup
analysis of trials with (pre)hypertensive participants revealing a
greater blood pressure-reducing effect of cocoa compared to nor-
motensive participants.
Implications for research
More trials are needed, designed to directly compare the effect
of cocoa on specific population groups (e.g. hypertensive versus
normotensive) to test the findings of our subgroup analyses.
Long-term trials are needed investigating the effect of cocoa on
clinical outcomes, to assess whether cocoa has an effect on cardio-
vascular events.

“Seated systolic and diastolic BP recorded in the morning with a validated oscillometric
device with appropriately sized cuffs (Omron 705 CP; Omron Matsusaka) on the non-
dominant upper arm. These evaluations were performed by staff blinded to the study
protocol. At each visit, participants rested 15 mins in a seated position, the first blood
pressure measurement was taken but discarded, and the subsequent 3 consecutive blood
pressure readings, taken at 3-min intervals, were recorded. The average of these latter
measures was considered for statistical analysis.”

Notes
Noad 2016
Methods
12-week randomised controlled, single-blinded dietary intervention design
Participants
92 participants aged 40-65years, with documented grade I (140-159/90-99mmHg) or grade II (160-179/100-
109mmHg) hypertension
Interventions
The study commenced with a four-week ‘run-in phase’ for all participants, during which they were asked to consume
two portions or less of F&V, and to exclude berries and dark chocolate (low-polyphenol diet). At the end of this
period, subjects were randomised to continue with the above low-polyphenol diet for a further 8-week ‘intervention
period’ or to consume a high-polyphenol diet of six portions F&V (including one portion of berries per day) and
50g of dark chocolate per day
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was between-group change in maximum FBF response to the endothelium-dependent va-
sodilator, ACh. Secondary endpoints included between-group change in self-reported polyphenol-rich food intake,
between-group change in biochemical markers of nutritional status and between-group change in SBP and lipid
profile

We added to the exclusion criteria: Trials of very low quality, specifically high losses to follow up of more than 50%, were excluded
from meta-analysis.
For clarity, we provided more detail of the approach for data analysis.
We modified:
1. Primary outcome measure: ’Difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at final follow-up between cocoa and control
group, adjusted for baseline.’ Previously, the protocol had read: ’Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline
compared with control.’
2. Measurement of treatment effect: ’Mean difference in SBP/DBP in mmHg from baseline to final follow-up, adjusted for baseline
differences.’ Previously, the protocol had read: ’Change of mean difference in SBP/DBP from baseline to follow-up in mmHg.’
3. Dealing with missing data: ’....We assumed a correlation of 0.68 between the final follow-up SBP/DBP results for the two
treatment arms in a cross-over trial.’ Previously, the protocol had read: ’We will assume a correlation of 0.68 for the standard deviation
of the differences from baseline to follow-up.’
4. We modified the imputation of standard deviations as follows:
i) standard deviation of blood pressure at end of treatment taken in a different position from that of the blood pressure data
used
ii) standard deviation of blood pressure at baseline
iii) mean standard deviation of blood pressure at end of treatment from other trials using the same intervention.
Differences in versions of this review
The Ried 2012 version of this review incorporated a meta-regression analysis which we have not conducted for this update, for practical
reasons.
