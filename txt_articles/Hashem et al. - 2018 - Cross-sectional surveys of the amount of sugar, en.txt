Objectives To investigate the sugar, energy and caffeine 
content of sugar-sweetened drinks marketed and 
consumed as energy drinks available in the UK.
study design We carried out a cross-sectional survey in 
2015 and 2017 of energy drinks available in the main UK 
retailers.
Methods The sugar (sugars g/100 mL), energy 
(kcal/100 mL), caffeine (mg/100 mL) and serving size were 
collected from product packaging and nutrition information 
panels of energy drinks available in the nine main UK 
grocery retailers, three health and beauty retailers and one 
convenience store.
results The number of formulations (per 100 mL) 
and number of products (per serving) have fallen 
(from 75 to 49 and from 90 to 59) between 2015 and 
2017, respectively. Energy drinks surveyed showed 
a 10% reduction in sugar, from 10.6 to 9.5 g/100 mL 
(P=0.011) and a 6% reduction in energy content 
(P=0.005) per 100 mL between 2015 and 2017. The 
average caffeine content of energy drinks, with a 
warning label, has remained high at 31.5±0.9 in 2015 
and 31.3±1.0 mg/100 mL in 2017. Despite there being 
reductions, sugar, energy and caffeine content remain at 
concerning levels in 2017.
Conclusions To reduce the harmful impact of energy 
drinks, further reduction in sugar and a reduction in 
caffeine by reformulation are urgently needed. Other 
measures such as ban on the sale of energy drinks to 
children and smaller product sizes should also be explored, 
while warning labels should be kept. A reduction in sugar, 
energy and caffeine content and overall energy drinks 
consumption could be beneficial in reducing sugar, energy 
and caffeine intake of consumers of energy drinks.
IntrOduCtIOn
In July 2015, the Scientific Advisory Committee 
on Nutrition (SACN) recommended that 
average free sugars (sugar) intake, across 
the UK population, should not exceed 5% 
of total energy intake.1 This is in line with 
the World Health Organisation’s conditional 
new guideline on sugar intake.2 3 SACN also 
advised that consumption of sugar-sweetened 
drinks, including energy drinks, should be 
minimised in children and adults,1 because 
high intake of sugar is contributing to obesity, 
type 2 diabetes and dental caries,3–11 major 
public health problems in the UK,12–19 with 
significant healthcare costs.20 
The average intakes in 2014 of sugar 
exceeded recommendations in all age 
groups.21 The mean sugar intake in adults 
was 60 g per day and contributes to 12% of 
daily energy intake. In children the average 
sugar intake was 54g (13%) per day in 4–10 
year olds and 73g (15%) per day in 11–18 
year olds.21
Soft drinks are the main contributor of 
sugar intake in children (4–10 years) and 
teenagers (11–18 years) as well as the second 
main contributor in adults (18–64 years), 
contributing to 30%, 40% and 25% of sugar 
intake, respectively.21 Within soft drinks, 
energy drinks are a booming subcategory.22–25
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This paper for the first time investigates and doc-
uments the sugar, energy and caffeine content of 
products marketed as energy drinks sold in the UK.
 
► The results demonstrate that the amount of sug-
ar and energy has fallen, without technical issues, 
while caffeine levels remain high.
 
► This paper shows that serving sizes of energy drinks 
are large and should be reduced.
 
► The study was based on the levels provided on ener-
gy drinks packaging labels in store; hence, we relied 
on the accuracy of the data provided on the label.

Products described as ‘energy drinks’ by the industry 
are typically glucose-based energy drinks: functional 
or stimulation energy drinks which claim a particular 
energy boost from caffeine, guarana, taurine, ginseng or 
other herbs or some combination of these ingredients, 
which are known to have stimulant properties and are 
distinct from sports drinks (which are often described as 
‘sports’, ‘isotonic’ or ‘hypotonic’ and ‘hypertonic’).22 26 
Besides the health concerns around sugar content, the 
high levels of caffeine in some energy drinks are asso-
ciated with chronic sleep loss, addiction/dependence, 
withdrawal and intoxication.26–29
In the UK, sales of energy drinks have increased by 
155% between 2006 and 2014, from 235 to 600 million 
L, with an average per capita consumption of 9.4 L in 
2014.30 The leading brands’ shares in the UK energy 
drinks market, by value in 2013–2014, were Red Bull 
(25%), own label (12%), Monster (10%), Relentless 
(6%), Rockstar (5%), Mountain Dew (2%), Boost (2%) 
and Emerge (2%).31
Energy drinks consumption in the UK is a growing 
problem, particularly among children and teenagers. 
In 2011, a study by the European Food Safety Authority 
found young people in the UK consumed more energy 
drinks than in other EU countries (3.1 L per person per 
month, compared with 2 L)32 and market research data 
suggest a potential increase in purchase among children 
aged 10–14 years.31
The increase in consumption and popularity of energy 
drinks has raised concerns among the scientific commu-
nity, governments and the general public about the health 
effects of these products, particularly among children and 
adolescents.26 33 34 There have been two policies to tackle 
sugar and caffeine content of energy drinks. In terms 
of sugar content, a two-tiered Soft Drinks Industry Levy 
(SDIL) on the production and importation of sugar-sweet-
ened drinks, including energy drinks, will be introduced 
in 2018.35 The policy is intended to drive product refor-
mulation and lower sugar consumption. Reformulation 
is commonly described as efforts by the manufacturer to 
lower the ‘unhealthy’ components (eg, saturated fat, trans 
fat, sugar, salt) of a product at the time of production, 
without worsening the profile of other ingredients (eg, 
increasing calorie content).36 The reformulated products 
become a replacement of an existing product (eg, the 
same brand of energy drink with less sugar). The SDIL 
aims to incentivise manufacturers of sugar-sweetened 
drinks with more than 8 g of sugar, per 100 mL, to reduce 
the levels to below 8 g and pay a lower tax rate and manu-
facturers of drinks with more than 5 g of sugar per 100 mL 
and to lower the sugar levels to less than 5 g and pay 
 
no tax.35
In terms of caffeine content, the EU Food Information 
Regulation requires specific labelling for high caffeine 
drinks (over 150 mg/L).37 The warning states that the 
product is not recommended for children. However, 
these products can be easily purchased and consumed by 
children.
This cross-sectional survey has been conducted to docu-
ment levels of sugar and energy in energy drinks, as well 
as caffeine in the UK. The data available to monitor the 
energy drinks market, including whether reformulation 
is taking place, are generally the preserve of companies 
and not in the public domain. The main purpose of this 
research was to (1) report the variability in sugar and 
energy content in 2015 and 2017, (2) assess the sugar 
content in relation to the UK’s new daily recommenda-
tion for sugar intake and by energy drinks brands, (3) 
quantify the levels of caffeine in energy drinks and deter-
mine the products on the market with the back of pack 
high-caffeine warning, (4) assess the number of products 
that will be taxed based on the criteria suggested in the 
SDIL35 and (5) evaluate reformulation of energy drinks.
MethOds
The data were collected from product packaging and 
nutrient information panels in January 2015 and January 
2017. The survey was designed as a comprehensive survey 
of all energy drinks available in a snapshot in time, using 
one large outlet for each of the nine main grocery retailers, 
three health and beauty retailers and one convenience 
store. This study used the same study design and procedures 
as reported in our previous work on carbonated sugar- 
sweetened drinks, which excluded energy drinks.38
definition
Energy drinks were defined as any drink with ‘energy’, 
‘energise’, ‘energiser’, ‘caffeine’ and ‘stimulation’ in 
the product name or description, for example, Red Bull 
Energy Drink, Monster Energy Drink, Relentless Origin 
Energy Drink and Tropicana Energy Mango and Guava 
with passion fruit or products with high-caffeine warning 
label including products not described as 'energy drinks' 
(such as Mountain Dew).
Since the focus of this study is on product reformula-
tion, products labelled ‘zero’ or ‘light’ or ‘no added sugar’ 
were excluded. We also excluded products described 
solely as ‘sports’ drinks, which consist primarily of carbo-
hydrates and electrolytes and are intended for athletes 
to rehydrate after exercise, for example, ‘Lucozade 
Sports’.22 However, ‘Lucozade Energy’ was included.
data collection
For each energy drink, the data collected included the 
company name, product name, pack weight, serving size, 
sugars (g), energy (kcal) and caffeine (mg) per 100 mL 
and per serving. Where data were not available per 
serving, it was calculated from pack size and per 100 mL 
data. Caffeine content was only collected in a subsample 
of the 2015 products.
Where products only labelled 'carbohydrate' content in 
2015 but labelled 'sugars' content in 2017 and the content of 
all nutrients and ingredients were the same, it was assumed 
that the sugar content from 2015 was the same as 2017 
(applied to only one product).

The data were double checked after entry and a further 
5% of entries were checked against the original source in 
a random selection of products by the lead author.
stores
Data were collected from each of the major UK grocery 
retailers in store (Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Marks and Spencer, 
Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, The Co-operative and Wait-
rose), which altogether hold 93.2% of the grocery market 
share in the UK.39 Three health and beauty retailers 
(Boots, Superdrug and Holland and Barrett) and one 
convenience store (Costcutter) were also included since 
they sell a wide variety of branded energy drinks.
Analysis
Per 100 mL
Some brands sell the same formulation in different 
serving sizes. Therefore, the 100 mL data only included 
an example of one formulation regardless of the different 
serving sizes.
Per serving
The per-serving data included all the different serving 
sizes available apart from 1 L bottles. One-litre products 
were excluded from the per-serving analysis since it was 
deemed that the industry standardised serving of 250 mL 
was too little and that consumers are likely to overcon-
sume. Any product with up to 500 mL can or bottle size 
was considered as one serving, regardless of what is stated 
on the packaging as a serving size for example, often a 
500 mL bottle is split into two servings, but we consider 
that most consumers drink these drinks as one serving.
Caffeine
Separate analysis was conducted on the products with the 
high-caffeine warning label (over 150 mg/L).
High, medium and low criteria for sugars content
The sugar content was compared with the UK front 
of pack colour-coded labelling for drinks. Portion 
size criteria applied to portion/serving sizes greater 
than 150 mL. Colour coding is based on the following 
front of pack colour-coded nutrition labelling criteria 
(sugars: red/high >13.5 g/portion or >11.25 g/100 mL, 
amber/medium >2.5 to ≤11.25/100 mL, green/low 
≤2.25 g/100 mL).40
In addition to the above analyses, the sugar content 
was compared with the UK’s recommendation for sugar 
intake for adults (30 g/day) and children aged 7–10 years 
(24 g/day).40 The highest energy-containing products 
were compared with women’s daily energy intake (2000 
kcal).41 Also, we assessed the number of products that will 
be taxed based on the criteria suggested in the SDIL.35
statistical analysis
Comparison among products within each survey
Independent samples Mann-Whitney U Test was used to 
compare the levels of sugar between supermarket own 
label and branded products.
Comparison of the same products between the 2 years
For the purpose of assessing reformulation, only the prod-
ucts with data available in both surveys were included in 
this analysis. Paired t-test was used to examine whether 
there was a significant change in the sugar and energy 
content of energy drinks from 2015 to 2017.
Data are reported as mean, SD, range as indicated. 
Significance in all tests carried out was deemed signif-
icant as being P<0.05. All data were analysed using 
 
SPSS V.22.
results
sugar, energy and caffeine content per 100 ml in 2015 and 
2017
A total of 75 and 49 energy drinks met the per 100 mL inclu-
sion criteria in 2015 and 2017, respectively. The average 
sugar content was 10.6±2.9 g and 9.7±3.0 g/100 mL, with 
a large variation in sugar content between different 
energy drinks ranging from 1.9 to 15.9 g and 2.1 to 
16.0 g/100 mL in 2015 and 2017, respectively (table 1). 
There were no significant differences in sugar content 
between supermarket own label and branded products 
in 2015 (P=0.397) and 2017 (P=0.245). The product with 
the highest and lowest sugar content per 100 mL in 2015 
and 2017 are highlighted in table 2.
The average energy content in energy drinks was 
47±13 kcal/100 mL ranging from 10 to 70 kcal/100 mL 
in 2015 and 44±13 kcal/100 mL, ranging from 10 to 70 
kcal/100 mL in 2017 (table 1). There were no significant 
differences in energy content between supermarket own 
label and branded products in 2015 (P=0.872) and 2017 
(P=0.113).
Among all of the manufacturers with three or more 
formulations of energy drinks in 2015, Rockstar and 
Lucozade product ranges contained the highest average 
sugar and energy per 100 mL, respectively (table 3). 
However, in 2017 the Rockstar product range contained 
the highest average sugar and energy content per 100 mL 
(table 3), which suggests Lucozade have been reformu-
lating their products.
Since not all ‘energy drinks’ have a high-caffeine content, 
we analysed the caffeine, sugar and energy content of the 
products with the warning label separately. A total of 23 
and 39 energy drinks formulations had caffeine content 
labelled on pack in 2015 and 2017 (there may have 
been more that were labelled but not all were collected 
in 2015). The average caffeine content in energy drinks 
was 30.7±2.9 in 2015 and 31.6±0.8 mg/100 mL in 2017 
(table 1). The levels of sugar, energy and caffeine were 
similar to the levels in the full sample of energy drinks.
sugar, energy and caffeine content per serving in 2015 and 
2017
A total of 90 and 59 energy drinks products met the inclu-
sion criteria in 2015 and 2017, respectively (table 4). The 
total number of products available has fallen between 
2015 and 2017. The total number of products analysed

per serving is different to the per 100 mL data because 
some brands sell the same formulation in different 
serving sizes. The serving data included all the different 
serving sizes available apart from 1 L bottles. The serving 
size varied from 150 to 500 mL in 2015 and 250 to 500 mL 
in 2017. Most products were in a 500mL can/bottle (42% 
in 2015 and 47% in 2017).
The average sugar content in energy drinks was high 
41.1±17.9 in 2015 and 38.5±18.2 g/serving in 2017 
(table 4), more than the entire maximum daily recom-
mendation for sugar intake in the UK for an adult 
(30 g). Indeed, 59% of products in 2015 and 54% in 
2017 exceeded the maximum UK’s recommendation 
for sugar intake per serving for an adult (30 g/day). 
Additionally, 86% in 2015 and 78% in 2017 of prod-
ucts exceeded the maximum daily recommendation 
for sugar intake for a child aged 7–10 years (24 g/day). 
About 96% and 95% would receive a ‘red’ (high) label 
for sugars per serving (>13.5 g/serving) in 2015 and 
2017, respectively.
The serving size was significantly larger in branded 
versus supermarket own label products in 2015 (P=0.003) 
and 2017 (P=0.003), and as a result, the branded products 
contained on average higher levels of sugar compared 
with supermarket products per serving in 2015 (P=0.028) 
and 2017 (P=0.026) (figure 1 and table 4).
The average energy content in energy drinks was 
185±81 kcal and 176±76/serving in 2015 and 2017, 
respectively. There was a large variation in energy content 
between different energy drinks ranging from 50 to 350 
and 50 to 335kcal/serving in 2015 and 2017, respectively 
(figure 2 and table 4).
The energy drink products with the highest energy 
content in 2015 and 2017 can contribute up to 17%–17.5% 
of a woman’s daily energy intake (2000 kcal).41
A total of 22 and 43 energy drinks formulations had 
high-caffeine labels on pack (table 4) in 2015 and 2017, 
respectively. 
soft drink industry levy in 2017
A total of 36 products (73%) would be taxed at the higher 
SDIL rate (>8 g/100 mL), nine products (18%) at the 
lower rate (8–5g/100 mL) and four products (8%) would 
not be taxed (<5 g/100 mL).35
Comparison of the same products between the 2 years
The overall number of energy drinks formulations has 
decreased between 2015 and 2017, from 75 to 49 products.
reformulation
There were 30 products surveyed repeatedly in 2015 and 
2017. The average sugar content per 100 mL for these 
products was 10.6±3.2 g in 2015 and 9.5±3.3 g in 2017 
(P=0.011 for comparison between the 2 years). This 
represents a reduction of 10%. The sugar content has 
fallen in 12 products, remained the same in 16 and has 
increased in 2. The average energy content per 100 mL 
was 47±14 kcal in 2015 and 44±15 kcal in 2017, (P=0.005

for comparison between the 2 years) representing a 6% 
reduction.
There were 12 products surveyed repeatedly in 2015 
(31.5±0.9) and 2017 (31.3±1.0 mg/100 mL) displaying 
the high caffeine warning label. The caffeine content of 
these products stayed the same, apart from one product, 
where the caffeine content was reduced, from 32 mg to 
30 mg.
Note that these averages are slightly different from 
those when all products were included in each year, and 
this trend analysis reflects reductions made in the same 
products rather than the overall products available, giving 
a better reflection of reformulation, for a full list of prod-
ucts refer to online supplementary file.
dIsCussIOn
These cross-sectional surveys have documented the levels 
of sugar, energy and caffeine in energy drinks in the 
UK between 2015 and 2017, a topic which has not been 
previously documented for easy access by researchers and 
policy-makers. It will allow for evaluation of trends in the 
energy drinks market in the future.
The surveys have shown early changes in the energy 
drinks market. Formulations (per 100 mL) and number 
of products (per serving) have fallen between 2015 and 
2017. This may be due to the pressure on the soft drinks 
industry to reduce sugary drinks offerings.42 Furthermore, 
the energy drinks surveyed showed a small but statistically 
significant reduction in sugar content; this is likely due 
to the 12 products which have reduced sugar content 
between 2015 and 2017, probably as a result of reformula-
tion due to the impending SDIL.35 Manufacturers of the 
reduced products have either only reduced sugar or have 
alternatively reduced sugar and replaced it with non-ca-
loric sweeteners without changing the product name, for 
example, by calling the product ‘light’ and so on. Given 
the volume consumed,22 even small reductions in sugar 
content of energy drinks would have a significant impact 
on sugar and energy intake among regular consumers of 
energy drinks.43

This survey suggests the early success of the impending 
SDIL. Even though the SDIL is yet to come in, manu-
facturers have started to reformulate their products in 
advance to avoid paying the levy. However, we are yet to 
see if the SDIL will have an impact on overall consump-
tion of energy drinks by reducing sales.44 Other coun-
tries have imposed taxes on soft drinks, including energy 
drinks, and have seen reductions in sales.45 46
Despite this, sugar content remains at concerning 
levels, 95% would receive a ‘red’ (high) label for sugars 
per serving in 2017. There was also a large variation in 
sugar content between different energy drinks ranging 
from 2.1 to 16.0 g/100 mL, which suggests further reduc-
tions are possible.
As well as the concerns around the sugar and energy 
content of energy drinks, there are also concerns 
about caffeine levels, particularly in the products 
labelled as high caffeine. In 2017, average caffeine 
content in energy drinks was 124.3±39.3 mg/serving 
among the 43 products labelled, almost equivalent to 
two cups of coffee or four cans of cola.37 There is also 
some evidence to suggest that the caffeine content 
increases sugar-sweetened drinks consumption further 
and therefore sugar intake too.47 Since children and 
teenagers are the main consumers of energy drinks,

manufacturers should consider reducing levels of 
caffeine—again through reformulation. The removal 
of caffeine also allows for the removal of 10.3% of 
sugar without affecting taste, which has the potential 
to reduce body weight of adults by 0.6 kg, without any 
change in sugar-sweetened drinks consumption.48
It important to note that not all manufacturers label 
the amount of caffeine on their energy drinks, and this 
is likely because their products do not exceed the cut-off 
for adding the warning label.37 Among the manufacturers 
that do, a warning is stated on the pack, acknowledging 
the potential danger these products can pose to children. 
However, these products can be easily purchased and 
consumed by children. Perhaps the UK should consider 
restrictions like other countries. In Lithuania, sales of 
energy drinks (containing at least 150 mg of caffeine per 
litre) are banned to under 18 years of age.49 A similar 
law applies in Sweden where sales of energy drinks are 
banned to children under 15 years of age and sales of 
some energy drinks are restricted to pharmacies.26
Furthermore, serving sizes of energy drinks matter 
since the larger the serving size, the more sugar, energy 
and caffeine is consumed. Indeed, typical serving sizes 
of energy drinks are larger than other sugar-sweetened 
drinks38; this survey showed that the most common 
serving size was 500 mL. The average sugar content 
in energy drink in both surveys per serving was more 
than an adult’s entire maximum daily recommen-
dation for sugar intake in the UK. Likewise, 86% in 
2015 and 78% in 2017 of the products exceeded the 
maximum daily recommendation for sugar intake 
for a child aged 7–10 years (24 g/day).1 The prod-
ucts with the highest sugar and energy content per 
serving could contribute up 17.5% of a woman’s total 
daily energy intake. Therefore, to reduce the amount 
of sugar, energy and caffeine consumed from energy 
drinks, there is scope for introducing restrictions on 
larger serving sizes (500 mL bottles and cans). This is a 
growing problem, which must be tackled, particularly 
since the Grocer recently reported an increase in sales 
of larger cans of energy drinks on the UK market.23
Our study was based on sugar, energy and caffeine 
content data provided on the available energy drinks 
packaging labels in store on the dates of collection; 
hence, we relied on the accuracy of the data provided 
on the label and the availability of products in store. 
It is assumed that the manufacturers provide accurate 
and up-to-date information in line with EU regula-
tions. However, future studies should include sugar 
and energy content determined through laboratory 
analysis to achieve a better understanding of the true 
sugar and energy content and breakdown of the types 
of sugars. Furthermore, an analysis of what are the best 
selling products in the UK would allow for an accurate 
estimate of the potential impact of reformulation.
Also, the data collection process of caffeine content 
was slightly different in the two surveys. In 2015, 
caffeine was collected in a subsample of products, 
since the aim was not to collect caffeine at the time, 
but the data that were collected were included in the 
analysis, this may not give a full reflection of caffeine 
content of all products on the market in 2015.
Still, the results of this study are relevant and serve 
to document the sugar, energy and caffeine content of 
energy drinks sold the in UK, underpinning future studies 
and providing evidence for the treasury, policy-makers 
and the soft drinks industry, who are reformulating.50 51
COnClusIOn
Factors such as an increase in sales,24 25 30 concerning levels 
of sugar, energy and caffeine (assessed in this study), ease 
of access,33 large serving sizes, as well as limited regulation 
have created an environment where energy drinks could 
pose a major threat to public health.
To reduce the impact of energy drinks, sugar (and 
therefore energy) reformulation should continue and 
begin regarding caffeine content. Other measures such 
as a ban on the sale of energy drinks to children should 
be explored, while warning labels should be kept. Can 
and bottle sizes of energy drinks should also be decreased 
to reduce the overall consumption of sugar, energy 
and caffeine. A reduction in sugar, energy and caffeine 
content and overall energy drinks consumption could be 
beneficial in reducing sugar, energy and caffeine intake 
of consumers of energy drinks.
