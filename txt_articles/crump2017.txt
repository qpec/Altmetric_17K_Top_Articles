Key Points
• SCHOLAR-1 is the first
patient-level analysis of
outcomes of refractory
DLBCL from 2 large
randomized trials and 2
academic databases.
• SCHOLAR-1 demonstrated
poor outcomes in patients
with refractory DLBCL,
supporting a need for more
effective therapies for these
patients.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. Although 5-year survival rates in the first-line setting range from 60% to 70%,
up to 50% of patients become refractory to or relapse after treatment. Published analyses
of large-scale outcome data from patients with refractory DLBCL are limited.SCHOLAR-1,
an international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research study,
retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with refractory DLBCL which, for this
study, was defined as progressive disease or stable disease as best response at any point
during chemotherapy (>4 cycles of first-line or 2 cycles of later-line therapy) or relapsed at
£12 months from autologous stem cell transplantation. SCHOLAR-1 pooled data from
2 phase 3 clinical trials (Lymphoma Academic Research Organization-CORAL and Canadian
Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center and
University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence).
Response rates and overall survival were estimated from the time of initiation of salvage
therapy for refractory disease. Among 861 patients, 636 were included on the basis of
refractory disease inclusion criteria. For patients with refractory DLBCL, the objective
response rate was 26% (complete response rate, 7%) to the next line of therapy, and the
median overall survival was 6.3 months. Twenty percent of patients were alive at 2 years. Outcomes were consistently poor across
patient subgroups and study cohorts. SCHOLAR-1 is the largest patient-level pooled retrospective analysis to characterize response
rates and survival for a population of patients with refractory DLBCL. (Blood. 2017;130(16):1800-1808)
Introduction
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with 27 650 estimated new cases
diagnosed in the United States in 2016 and an annual incidence of 3 to
4 per 100 000 persons in Europe.1,2 Survival rates have improved over
the last several decades, with the most recent 5-year relative survival
rate reported as 62.0% in the United States and 55.4% in Europe.3,4
In the immunochemotherapy era, more than 50% of patients with
advanced-stage de novo DLBCL are cured with rituximab com-
bined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
(R-CHOP).5 However, depending on the number of adverse prognostic
factors from the International Prognostic Score (IPI), 20% to 50% of
patients with DLBCL will be refractory to R-CHOP or will relapse
after achieving complete response (CR).6,7 Among patients who progress
during initial immunochemotherapy or soon after a brief CR, only 30% to
40%willrespondtosalvagechemotherapyandmaysubsequentlyundergo
consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).8-10
EvenamongpatientswithrelapsedorrefractoryDLBCLwhorespondto

From 
 post-ASCT, have poor overall survival (OS) rates; however, there is a
paucityofpublisheddatareportingoutcomesinthispatientpopulation.13
Previous studies of patients with refractory DLBCL included small
cohortsofpatients.13,15-17Despitetheclinicalawarenessofpooroutcomes
inpatientswithrefractorydisease,therehasneverbeenalarge-scaleeffort
to specifically characterize response to therapy and survival outcomes in
these patients. Results from clinical trials and retrospective cohort
analyses identified by using a similar definition of refractory showed
that these patients have consistently poor clinical outcomes.13,15-23 In
6 studies that assessed different chemotherapy regimens for 251 patients
who had aggressive lymphoma refractory to first-line therapy, the
objective response rate ranged from 0% to 23%, and the median OS was
,10 months.15,17-20,22 In an additional 3 studies of 135 patients whose
lymphoma was refractory to second-line therapy, the objective response
rate ranged from 1% to 14%, and the median OS was 5 months.18,21,24
Finally, in 2 studies of patients who relapsed after ASCT, median OS of
8 months (n 5 45) and 10 months (n 5 75) were reported.13,23
There is an urgent need for effective treatments for patients with
refractory DLBCL whose disease fails to respond to immunochemo-
therapy or any subsequent salvage regimen and for those whose dis-
ease relapses early post-ASCT. A key component of any such effective
treatment would be a high response rate, either durable unto itself or
potentially offering the opportunity for consolidation with SCT. With
many promising therapies under development for refractory DLBCL,
there is a need for more precise understanding of the expected response
andOSrateswithcurrentlyavailabletherapiesinthispatientpopulation
to establish a benchmark for future studies. We constructed an inter-
national, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research
study (SCHOLAR-1), which represents the largest patient-level pooled
analysis to evaluate responses and OS rates in patients with refractory
NHL, including DLBCL-transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and
primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL).
Methods
Study design
For SCHOLAR-1, patient-level data were collected for patients with refrac-
tory DLBCL from 4 sources: observational cohorts from MD Anderson Cancer
Center(MDACC)25andtheMolecularEpidemiologyResourceoftheUniversity
of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence
(IA/MC)26,27 and follow-up of 2 large phase 3 randomized controlled trials,
Canadian Cancer Trials Group study LY.12,8 and the Lymphoma Academic
Research Organization (LYSARC) Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggres-
sive Lymphoma (CORAL) study.9,12 Cohort details have been previously
described.8,9,25,27,28 Briefly, the MDACC observational cohort included patients
with DLBCL and TFL who were relapsed or refractory to initial rituximab-
containing chemotherapy, had failed salvage platinum-containing chemother-
apy, and received a second salvage therapy at MDACC.25 The IA/MC is a
Midwest US observational cohort that enrolled unselected, newly diagnosed
patientswithlymphomawhothenenteredprospectivedocumentationof primary
and subsequent treatments and outcomes.26,27 In the international random-
ized LY.12 study, 619 patients (from 4 countries) were enrolled at the time of
relapse after anthracycline-containing therapy and were randomly assigned to
1 of 2 salvage regimens with a goal of consolidative ASCT. The CORAL study
enrolled 477 patients (from 11 countries) with DLBCL who were in their first
relapseorwhoselymphomawasrefractorytofirst-linetherapy,andpatientswere
randomlyassignedto1of2salvageregimenswithagoalofconsolidativeASCT.
In the latter 2 studies, eligible patients with CD201 lymphoma were randomly
assigned to rituximab maintenance or observation after ASCT (supplemental
Table 1, available on the Blood Web site). The primary abstraction method
included patients with relapsed or refractory disease who were selected from the
4 study cohorts (N 5 861). The authors at each institution abstracted the data
according to guidelines given in the research project proposal. Upon receipt of
data from individual institutions, Kite Pharma personnel programmatically
applied the specific refractory search criteria to derive the SCHOLAR-1 analysis
set (N 5 636; Figure 1). Institutional authors were consulted for clarification of
ambiguous patient cases during this process. Patient cases that were excluded
were fed back to the participating authors. Abstraction criteria were pro-
grammaticconfirmationofrefractorystatusdefinedasprogressivediseaseasbest
response to any line of chemotherapy, stable disease as best response to
$4 cycles of first-line therapy, or 2 cycles of later-line therapy or relapse
#12 months(365 days) after ASCT;initiation of a line of therapyafter refractory
status was determined; and evidence (response outcome and/or date or response)
of disease assessment after initiation of therapy for refractory disease.
Patient selection
All patients from each data source who met criteria for refractory DLBCL,
including TFL and PMBCL, who received subsequent therapy were considered
for analysis. Refractory DLBCL (including subtypes PMBCL and TFL) was
defined as progressive disease (received $4 cycles of first-line therapy) or stable
disease (received 2 cycles of later-line therapy) as best response to chemotherapy
or relapse #12 months after ASCT. TFL and PMBCL were included be-
cause they are histologically similar and are clinically treated as large-cell
lymphoma.29-31 Patients must have received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
and an anthracycline as 1 of their qualifying regimens. For IA/MC, LY.12, and
CORAL, patients were included at first instance of meeting refractory criteria,
whereas for MDACC, patients who first met refractory criteria from second-line
therapy onward were included. Patients with primary central nervous system
lymphoma were excluded.
Assessments
Response to therapy for refractory disease was determined by the 1999
International Working Group response criteria per local review for randomized
studies.8,9,32 Response to therapy for the observational cohorts was determined
by investigator assessment also using International Working Group response
criteria. In the clinical trials, patients determined to be refractory were assessed
for survival approximately every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months
for 3 years in CORAL and at least annually for LY.12 per protocol. For the
observational studies, patients were followed up for disease response and
survivalperinstitutionstandardprocedures.Patientswhowerealiveatthetimeof
data extraction were censored at the date of last contact.
Covariates
Covariates included IPI risk category (low risk, 0-1 point; low-intermediate risk, 2
points; high-intermediate to high risk, $3 points), Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Groupperformancestatus(ECOGPS),stageofdisease,andline oftherapybefore
refractory status. For the observational cohorts, covariates were determined at
diagnosis. For the randomized study cohorts, covariates were determined at
random assignment. For all cohorts, in some cases, covariates were also measured
later in the treatment course, depending on data availability and accessibility or
study design. The determination of refractory status may have been distant in time
from the measurement of the covariate. For summaries of patient characteristics,
thecovariatemeasuredclosestintime tothedeterminationofrefractorystatuswas
used. For subgroup analyses, patients were included in the covariate subgroup
analysis only if the covariate was measured within 3 months of the determination
of refractory status. Refractory subgroups were defined as refractory to first-line
therapy, refractory to second-line or later-line therapy, or relapsed #12 months
after ASCT. Categorization of refractory subgroup was defined by the first time a
patient met the criteria for refractory disease in the IA/MC, LY.12, and CORAL
study cohorts. Patients in the MDACC study cohort were categorized as either
refractorytosecond-lineorlater-linetherapyorrelapsed#12monthsafterASCT.
The line of therapy before refractory status was determined according to the first
time a patient was determined to be refractory.

From 
 studies, responses were prospectively evaluated per the study schedule of
assessments. For the observational cohorts, responses were determined at the
time of patient treatment or management. Responses were obtained from an
electronic medical record or patient medical record.Higgin’s Qstatistic was used
to assess the heterogeneity of response rate between the source databases.33 This
statistic describes the percentage of variability in the effect estimates that is a
result of heterogeneity rather than sampling error. A nonsignificant P value
suggests that the heterogeneity does not have a strong influence on the variability
in the analysis and that the data may be combined for analysis without further
adjustment.Inthisanalysis,aHiggin’sQstatisticprespecifiedvalueofP. .1was
used to determine whether significant heterogeneity was present; the P value was
. .1, and thus the data were pooled for analysis. Data were pooled at the patient-
record level, and response rates were estimated from the pooled data with a
random effects model.34 Covariates for response were evaluated with a Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by institution. Survival was estimated, and
covariates were assessed by a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by data
source. When covariates assessed after the start of therapy for refractory status
were used in survival models, survival time was calculated from the day of
covariate assessment. A nominal P value of .05 from the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel tests and Cox models was used to evaluate the effect of covariates on
response and survival.

From 
 criteria (Figure 1). Most patients had ECOG PS #1 and stage III-IV
disease (Table 1). Approximately one-fourth of patients had high-
intermediate or high-risk IPI risk classification. There was variability
among data sets; most patients (90%) from the MDACC study were
refractory to second-line or later-line therapy compared with approx-
imately half the patients in the IA/MC and CORAL studies. Less than
one-third of patients in LY.12 were refractory to second-line or later-
line therapy. Notably, the response rates in the DLBCL refractory
groups from this analysis were lower than those from the primary
analyses of LY.12 (26% for DLBCL refractory vs 45.1% for the
gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatintreatment group and 44.1%
for the dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin treatment group) and
CORAL (31% for DLBCL refractory vs 63.5% for the rituximab,
ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin treatment group and 62.8% for
the rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin treatment
group).8,9
Response rates
Response rates were similar across the 4 data sets, ranging from 20% to
31%, with a pooled response rate of 26% (Table 2). CR rates ranged
from2% to15%,witha pooledCRrate of7%.Pooled responseratesby
refractory subgroup (primary refractory, refractory to second-line
or later-line therapy, and relapsed #12 months after ASCT) ranged
from 20% to 39%. Response rates were consistently low across all
subgroups, with the lowestresponse rates inthe primary refractory and
high-risk IPI subgroups (Figure 2). Patients who relapsed #12 months
after ASCT had higher response rates (34%) than those in the primary
refractory (20%) or second-line therapy or greater (26%) groups
(Table 2).
OS
Survival from the start of salvage therapy for refractory disease was
consistently poor in patients with refractory DLBCL, with a median
OS of 6.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9-7.0 months)
from the start of therapy (Figure 3A). The 1-year survival rate was
28%, and 20% remained alive at 2 years (Table 3). OS rates were
similar regardless of refractory subgroup, with a slightly lower
median OS among patients who were refractory to second-line or
later-line therapy or who relapsed #12 months after ASCT (6.1 and
6.2 months, respectively) than among primary refractory patients
(7.1 months; Figure 3B). Although a higher response rate among
patients in the post-ASCT group was observed, the survival in the
post-ASCT group was similar to that of the other refractory sub-
groups evaluated.
To better characterize factors driving the long-term survival rates,
we evaluated OS within different patient subgroups (tumor response,
post-refractory transplantation status, age, ECOG PS, and IPI risk
category). Although they represent a relatively small proportion
of patients, those who achieved a CR after last salvage chemotherapy
had longer survival (median OS, 14.9 months) compared with

From 
 nonresponders (median OS, 4.6 months; Figure 3C). The 2-year
OS rate for nonresponders was 14% (Figure 3C). Median OS
was higher among the 180 patients who had undergone ASCT
(14.4 months) than among the 423 patients who had not undergone
ASCT; the median OS of the latter group was 5.1 months
(Figure 3D), and the 2-year OS rate was 11% (95% CI, 8%-14%;
Figure 3D). Thirty-one patients who achieved a CR underwent
ASCT, and their median OS was more than 6 years at the time of
this analysis. Of the 54 patients who achieved a partial response
(PR) and underwent ASCT, the median OS was 17.8 months
(supplemental Figure 1). For the 89 patients (18%) who were
unable to achieve a CR or PR and who underwent ASCT after
receiving an intervening line of therapy, the median OS was 8.7
months. Fifty-seven patients who received ASCT were alive at last
follow-up (range, 1-14 years). Other factors that were significantly
different for OS included ECOG PS (0-1 vs $2, P , .0001), disease
stage (I-II vs III-IV, P , .0001), and IPI risk groups (low vs low-
intermediate, P , .0001; low-intermediate vs high-intermediate,
P , .01) (Table 4; supplemental Figure 2). Age younger than
65 years or age 65 years or older did not impact OS.
Discussion
Although individual clinical observations suggestthat survival rates are
poor among patients with refractory DLBCL, published comprehen-
sive data are limited for this patient population. Previous studies have
included only small numbers of patients, indicating a need for a larger
analysis of outcomes in patients with refractory DLBCL. The results
of studies of patients with DLBCL refractory to second-line therapy
or who relapsed after ASCT have shown poor clinical outcomes
(median OS, 5 months and 8-10 months, respectively).10,13,16,18 The
SCHOLAR-1 study is the largest, patient-level pooled analysis to
evaluate responseandsurvivalratesinpatientswithrefractoryDLBCL.
These data are particularly important because they represent a large

outcome. Response to therapy was significantly associated with longer
survival, particularly for patients who submitted to ASCT thereafter.
These results showed that 20% of patients remained alive at 2 years;
however, these long-term durable responses were primarily driven by
the minority of patients who received ASCT and/or achieved a CR or
PR and who represent the tail of the Kaplan-Meier curve of OS. Most
patients (73%) did not respond to salvage therapy or were not able to
receive ASCT, resulting in particularly poor outcomes. As expected,
patients with higher stage disease, worse ECOG PS, and more IPI risk
factors had shorter survival. There is an urgent unmet need to improve
salvage regimens that may increase the percentage of patients eligible
for SCT and also to develop novel and effective therapeutic options to
treat this patient population.10,35
This study used a definition for refractory disease that included
patients who relapsed early (within 12 months of ASCT). Smaller
studies have shown that, similar to patients with DLBCL re-
fractory to therapy in the more traditional sense, those who relapse
early after receiving ASCT have poor outcomes.13,23 This study
was intended to globally characterize outcomes of patients for
whom the most recent therapy was minimally effective. Our
results confirm our assumptions built on these earlier studies, that
patients do indeed have poor outcomes, regardless of refractory
subgroup.
The strength of this study is the use of individual patient data
from 2 large clinical observational cohorts (IA/MC and MDACC)
that provided follow-up for patients from case ascertainment to
death and from 2 large, prospective, randomized phase 3 trials
(LY.12 and CORAL) that evaluated salvage therapy and ASCT
in DLBCL. A patient may be refractory at many times during the
course of his or her disease, such as primary refractory, refractory to
second-line therapy, or refractory to third-line therapy. For this
analysis, a patient was considered refractory at the first possible
time at which refractory criteria were met, because this maximized
the information available for response and survival after de-
termination of refractory status. A proportion of patients in this
study (27%) underwent salvage therapy and ASCT for primary
refractory DLBCL and remained in remission. Sensitivity analyses
that excluded this cohort suggest that outcomes are worse in the
remaining patients who are not successfully rescued with second-
line therapy and ASCT.

From 
 Despite potential differences in patient populations and study
design, outcomes were quite homogeneous. To understand the
relatively favorable outcomes of some of the clinically defined
subgroups in this data set, biomarkers such as cell of origin or
the presence of chromosomal translocations involving BCL-2 and
C-MYC (double-hit lymphomas) would be required36; such an
evaluation of biology of patients in the SCHOLAR-1 study cohorts
is planned. The incidence of C-MYC rearrangement was 17%
in patients analyzed in the CORAL study population and was
associated, alone or in combination with BCL-2 and or BCL-6
translocations, with a significantly inferior prognosis with standard
salvage therapy.28,31 Results of a study of patients with DLBCL
who experienced primary treatment failure showed that primary
progression, intermediate-high or high IPI at the time of primary
treatment failure, or MYC translocation predicted a 2-year OS
rate of 13.6% and constituted ultra-high risk features.8 Although
these high-risk populations were not specifically assessed in our
evaluation, the poor outcomes among patients observed in this
study mirror those observed in patients with high-risk factors and
support the homogeneous and strikingly grave prognosis for
patients with refractory DLBCL.
Although future prospective studies may be conducted in select
subgroups of this patient population, this report provides extensive
subgroup analyses based on patient characteristics and treatment
patterns that investigators may use to provide benchmarks for
future prospective studies in selected patient populations. Like
all retrospective studies, limitations of the direct applicability of
the results to future studies may exist. For example, the time period
of patients’ treatment may influence the applicability of the
benchmark to future studies. Nevertheless, the SCHOLAR-1 study
provides a historical benchmark for future studies in refractory
DLBCL, TFL, and PMBCL. The consistently poor outcomes shown
here indicate a significant unmet need for effective therapies for
patients with refractory NHL.
