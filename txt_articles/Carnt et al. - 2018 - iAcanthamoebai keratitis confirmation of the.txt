AbsTrACT
background/aims Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a 
chronic debilitating corneal infection principally affecting 
contact lens (CL) users. Studies were designed to test 
claims that the UK incidence may have increased in 
2012–2014 and to evaluate potential causes.
Methods Annualised incidence data were collected 
from January 1984 to December 2016. Case-control 
study subjects were recruited between 14 April 2011 and 
05 June 2017. Reusable CL users with AK were recruited 
retrospectively and prospectively. Controls were reusable 
CL users, recruited prospectively, with any disorder other 
than AK. Multivariable analysis of questionnaire data 
measured independent risk factors for AK.
results The current outbreak of AK started in 
2010–2011 with an incidence threefold higher than in 
2004–2009. Risk factors for AK were: Oxipol disinfection, 
CLs made of group IV CL materials, poor CL hygiene, 
deficient hand hygiene, use of CLs while swimming 
or bathing, being white British, and for those in social 
classes 4–9.
Conclusion AK is a largely preventable disease. The 
current outbreak is unlikely to be due to any one of the 
identified risk factors in isolation. Improving CL and hand 
hygiene, avoiding CLs contamination with water and use 
of effective CL disinfection solutions, or daily disposable 
CLs, will reduce the incidence of AK. In the longer-term, 
water avoidance publicity for CL users can be expected 
to reduce the incidence further. Ongoing surveillance of 
AK numbers will identify changes in incidence earlier. 
Evaluation of Acanthamoeba contamination in end-user 
drinking water would contribute to our understanding of 
regional variations in the risk of exposure.
InTroduCTIon
Acanthamoeba spp are free-living cyst-forming 
protozoans, ubiquitous in air, soil, dust and 
water, to which 50%–100% of us develop anti-
bodies. However, infections are uncommon, rarely 
involving the brain but more often the cornea. 
Acanthamoeba exist as a vegetative trophozoite, 
usually feeding on other microorganisms, whereas 
in the cornea, they probably feed on keratocytes. In 
adverse environments, including the nutrient defi-
ciency and noxious treatments that the organisms 
are exposed to in keratitis, trophozoites encyst. 
The cysts are extremely resilient and are the form 
of the organism responsible for persistent relapsing 
keratitis.1
Despite its comparative rarity, and status as an 
orphan disease, Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is 
of concern because of its severe and prolonged 
morbidity in the young and economically active 
contact lens (CL) users who constitute 90% of 
affected patients in the UK. The most severely 
affected quartile require more than: 10 months 
treatment, 38 months follow-up, 31 hospital visits, 
have less than 6/24 vision after resolution and 
require corneal transplants.2 Established indepen-
dent risk factors for developing the disease have 
been exposure to water; in the context of CL use, 
this risk has been related to exposure to domestic 
tap water both in the home,3 4 and while swimming 
or bathing when wearing CLs.4 5 Others have been 
poor CL hygiene,4–6 orthokeratology use of rigid 
CLs6 and lens disinfection solution failures which 
have resulted in previous outbreaks of AK both in 
the UK and USA.7 8 Following the last UK outbreak 
in 1991–1995, a national incidence study reported 
a mean of 53 cases per annum (p.a.) of which 88% 
were in CL users4; less than half the annual inci-
dence at the peak of that outbreak.7
Since then, no increase in annual AK incidence 
has been noticed until concerns expressed in 2012–
2014.9 10 As a result, we initiated the two studies 
reported here. Our results are likely to have rele-
vance to the whole UK given that in 1997–1999, 
Moorfields Eye Hospital (Moorfields) treated 
>75% of AK cases in the south east and >35% of all 
UK cases.4 The incidence study was to measure the 
annualised incidence at Moorfields. The case-con-
trol study was designed to identify potential causes 
of AK, which we hypothesised might be largely due 
to ineffective CL solutions given the findings from 
previous outbreaks.7 11

Incidence study of AK at Moorfields 1984–2016
The data collection methodology for the numbers of 
cases of AK cases seen at Moorfields from January 
1984 to December 2016 has differed for different 
periods and are not directly comparable. The meth-
odology is described in figure 1.4 7 12 13

Figure 1 The total number of cases from 1984 to 2016 (33 years) totalled 709. The data collection methodology varied for different periods labelled 
(A)–(E) in the text below and by colour in the figure. The colours identify the periods for which the same data collection methodology was used. The 
references retain the numbering they have in the text: (A) 1984–1996 data (blue bars) were published in a letter as a bar chart12 and was collected 
using the clinical and/or microbiological (culture or histology) criteria used in a previous study.7 (B) 1997–1999 data (red bar) were available from a 
national survey4 for a 24-month period 01 October 1997 to 30 September 1999 for which annual figures are not available: there were 37 cases in this 
2-year period. (C) From 2000 to April 2012 (green bars) cases were identified from our current microbiology laboratory electronic database, and an 
electronic letter search of our electronic patient database, both of which started in 2000. Criteria for inclusion were a positive Acanthamoeba culture, 
histopathological confirmation of trophozoites and/or cysts, culture-negative cases shown to have Acanthamoeba cysts on confocal microscopy, 
and those with a typical clinical course and response to treatment.4 (D) From March 2012 to December 2013 (yellow bars) cases were identified 
prospectively as part of studies being carried out on Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) using the criteria described for the (C) period. (E) From 01 January 
2014 to 31 December 2016 (black bars) cases were identified by retrospective audit, using the same criteria as for (C) but with the addition of 
Acanthamoeba DNA identification by PCR as an additional inclusion criterion. ‘*’ represents https://www.statista.com/statistics/429790/wearers-of-

and frequency of disposal, lens wear experience, frequency of 
practitioner aftercare, showering and bathing when wearing CLs 
and smoking.
Cases were reusable daily wear CL users diagnosed with AK 
having an initial attendance in the Moorfields A&E service. 
These included both self-referrals, secondary (general prac-
titioner and optometric) and tertiary (other ophthalmology 
centres) referrals. These were identified between 14 April 2011 
and 28 August 2014. Cases diagnosed before ethics approval 
was given on 18 February 2013 were recruited after diagnosis, 
subsequent to ethics approval cases were recruited at the time of 
diagnosis. Inclusion criteria for AK cases were the same as those 
used for the incidence study and are described in figure 1C,E.
Controls were recruited prospectively. Like the cases, these 
were attending Moorfields A&E. Inclusion criteria were daily 
wear CL wearers using CL solutions as part of the hygiene routine 
for reusable CL’s having any disorder other than AK. Controls 
were identified in two separate periods. This definition excluded 
users of true daily disposable and overnight (also known as 
continuous or extended) wear soft lenses for which no CL solu-
tions were used. A first set of controls was collected between 
17 February 2014 and 11 June 2015 and a second between 22 
November 2016 and 05 June 2017. A diagnosis for each ques-
tionnaire respondent was derived from the hospital notes. Disor-
ders in the control CL user populations were classified into two 
subsets: those with CL-related diseases and those with diseases 
thought to be unrelated to CL wear. These conditions are listed 
in online supplementary table 1). CL-related diseases included 
all CL-associated keratitis, other than AK, defined using criteria 
from previous studies.14–16
CL solutions were classified and analysed by the principal 
active ingredient using information derived from the packaging 
or manufacturers where possible or retailers when we could not 
establish the formulation from the first two sources. The classifi-
cation is in online supplementary table 2.
CLs were classified and analysed by their material using a 
simplification of the American National Standards Institute 
Terminology for Contact Lenses Reference Z80.20–2016 and 
checked for each CL brand, or rebranded lens, against the UK 
Association of Contact Lens Manufacturers Annual Handbook 
for the years of the study. These data are summarised in online 
supplementary table 3.

statistical methods
The main analysis sample included all eligible controls collected 
during 2016–2017. A sample size of 60 cases and 180 controls 
was expected to provide 85% power (alpha 0.05) to detect 
a minimum odds ratio (OR) of 2.7% assuming 20% of the 
controls were exposed. Initial assessment of potential risk factors 
was carried out one at a time using logistic regression without 
adjustment for confounding and is described in online supple-
mentary table 4. CL hygiene compliance is an important poten-
tial risk factor and the methodology for calculating the score 
used for this analysis is described in online supplementary table 
5. Following this initial assessment, multiple logistic regression 
models were constructed to obtain estimates of ORs adjusted 
for confounding effects. ORs are reported in this study as esti-
mates of relative risk. Variables selected initially for inclusion in 
the model building process were those having p values of <0.2 
from the unadjusted analysis together with variables thought a 
priori to be risk factors for AK: hygiene score, hand washing 
before lens handling and the principal active ingredient of the 
disinfection solution. The distribution of cases and controls for 
these variables are shown in table 1. In constructing each final 
multivariate (MV) model, one exposure variable was consid-
ered as the ‘exposure of main interest’ and all others as ‘auxil-
iary factors’ (potential confounders). The final MV model was 
thus optimised to estimate the adjusted OR for the ‘exposure 
of main interest’; covariate adjustment is described in online 
supplementary table 6. The performance of logistic models—
goodness-of-fit and discriminatory ability—were assessed by 
calculating the Hosmer-Lemeshow p value and area under the 
receiver operating characterisitic (ROC) curve, respectively. The 
statistical package used was Stata V
.14.2 (StataCorp).
resulTs
Incidence study
Figure 1 shows the numbers of cases from 1985 to 31 December 
2016. Annual numbers were 8 to 10 p.a. from 2000 to 2003, 
after which there was an annual increase from between 15 and 
23 p.a. from 2004 to 2009, rising from 2010 to the current level 
of between 36 and 65 cases p.a. Estimates of CL wear prevalence 
are given for datapoints throughout this period.
Case-control study
There were 63 confirmed AK cases in reusable CLs wearers, with 
no exclusions: 18 cases, diagnosed up to 22 months before 18 
February 2013 (when ethical approval was obtained), completed 
the study questionnaire retrospectively. The remaining 45 AK 
cases and all the controls completed the questionnaires at the 
time of diagnosis. Cases were compared independently with the 
two different control datasets; one additional case was excluded 
when the initial clinical diagnosis of AK was not confirmed on 
follow-up. There were 56 eligible controls from the first control 
dataset from which CL using controls were excluded if they 
had CL-related disease. Following the analysis of this dataset, 
concern was expressed by an external advisor about a potential 
bias in the selection of these controls. As a result, we reopened 
the study to obtain the second and fourfold larger control dataset 
of 213; exclusions were true daily disposable and overnight wear 
lens users, CL users with AK, 15 with missing CL solution or 
CL brand information (despite three contact attempts), one who 
left the hospital before being seen for diagnosis and two whose 
records could not be retrieved to confirm the outcome. The find-
ings from the analysis of the first dataset were similar to those 
of the second. The second dataset was chosen for the analysis 
reported here as giving a more conservative estimate of some 
ORs. Differences between the two datasets made their combi-
nation inappropriate. The results of the assessment of putative 
risk factors for AK, carried out independently for each exposure 
without adjustment for confounding, are shown in online supple-
mentary table 4 for the 63 AK cases compared with the entire 
second control dataset of 213. This control dataset includes both 
subsets with (n=109) and without (n=104) CL-related diseases. 
Both of these subsets of controls were included in the analysis 
as being likely to give a conservative estimate of the relative risk 
of exposures for AK, given that these may be shared with the 
risks for some of the non-Acanthamoeba CL-related keratitis 
conditions listed in online supplementary table 1 which made up 
64/109 (59%) of the diagnoses in this subset. The mean age in 
the whole sample was 33.9 (SD 12.26). The median age was 30 
(range 13–76), with 25th and 75th percentiles of 25–40 (IQR). 
The distribution was similar in cases and controls: median of 30 
in both and IQR 25–49 and 25–38, respectively. Thirty-three of 
63 (52%) of the cases and 152/213 (71%) of the controls were 
women.
MV analysis for the control dataset of 213 controls
The results of the analysis for reusable soft CLs, adjusted for 
confounding, are shown in table 2. These show significantly 
increased risks of AK as a result of the following:
 
►
The use of Oxipol disinfection of 4.74 (CI 1.83 to 12.30, p 
0.001).
 
►
Wearing group IV (high water content, ionic hydrogel lenses) 
of 6.71 (CI 1.31 to 34.29 p 0.022).
 
►
Poor CL hygiene practice of 3.34 (CI 1.52 to 7.38 p 0.003).
 
►
No, or uncertain, hand washing before lens handling of 3.65 
(CI 1.52 to 8.77 p 0.004).
 
►
Wearing CLs in swimming pools or hot tubs of 3.49 (CI 1.51 
to 8.04 p 0.003).
 
►
British (white) ethnicity of 4.82 (CI 1.61 to 14.46 p 0.005).
 
►
Occupation other than professional/director/senior official 
of 3.51 (CI 1.52 to 8.11 p 0.003).
Rigid gas permeable CL solutions were included in the lens 
disinfectant analysis, and these solutions were associated with a 
higher risk of keratitis compared with the referent: this does not 
imply a higher risk for AK associated with rigid lens use per se.
dIsCussIon
The current outbreak of AK in south east england and the uK
The incidence study has confirmed a current UK outbreak in 
south east England starting in 2010/2011, resulting in a mean 
of 50.3 p.a. (range 36–65) treated at Moorfields for the years 
2011–2016 compared with the most accurate estimate of the 
numbers between outbreaks, of 18.5 p.a. at Moorfields from 
the prospective national audit carried out over 2 years in 1997–
1999.4 Given the limitations of the data collection methodology, 
particularly for the earlier years of the period 2000 to 2012, it is 
possible that the numbers of cases between 2000 and 2003 are 
underestimates. On the other hand, the apparent rise in cases in 
2004, that was subsequently maintained until a further rise in 
2010–2011, may relate to the outbreak in the USA due to the 
failure of the CL disinfectant AMO Complete Moisture Plus. The 
latter resulted in a 17-fold rise in cases in the USA but, following 
withdrawal of the solution, numbers have remained at similar 
levels for reasons that are unclear.11 The industry data on CL 
user numbers in figure 1 suggest that this current UK outbreak is 
independent of changes in the prevalence of CL wear.

risk factors for AK
Between 80% and 90% of AK cases are potentially avoidable if 
effective disinfection systems are used, good CL hygiene practice 
followed and exposure to water while using lenses is avoided.4 7 
This current study confirms these previous risk factors and iden-
tifies new independent risk factors including deficient hand 
washing, race and occupation-associated risks (which are prob-
ably surrogates for safe CL lens use either from not receiving 
or following appropriate instruction). It has also confirmed our 
initial hypothesis that a CL solution may have been associated 
with the outbreak given that Oxipol-based disinfection was also 
an independent risk factor (OR 4.74, CI 1.83 to 12·30, p 0.001). 
This risk is relatively low compared with that of the previous 
outbreaks of AK associated with CL solution failures: a 40-fold 
higher risk of AK for users of chlorine-based disinfection systems 
in the UK7 and 17-fold higher for users of AMO Complete Mois-
ture Plus in the USA.8 11 The occurrence of AK in an individual 
patient who has used Oxipol cannot be attributed only to the 
Oxipol disinfection because: AK develops in some patients 
who do not use Oxipol (not a necessary cause), and also many 
patients who use Oxipol do not develop AK (not a sufficient 
cause). The same applies to the other risk factors. Since the time

Clinical science
of the investigation Oxipol solution has been phased out by the 
manufacturer.
Although most manufacturers test their solutions for activity 
against Acanthamoeba, this is not mandatory, largely because 
there is no standard methodology for reproducible in vitro 
sensitivity testing; this has resulted in a wide range of results for 
different solutions depending on the strains tested, their age and 
the storage and encystment methodology used.17 Independent 
testing, using rigorous methods, has shown that most multipur-
pose CL disinfection solutions in vitro may be ineffective against 
Acanthamoeba.17 The issue of mandatory testing of CL disinfec-
tion solutions for activity against Acanthamoeba is being actively 
addressed in the USA17, and an international testing standard 
is being developed by the ISO TC 172/SC 7/WG 9 committee 
for CL care products. However, disinfection is not sterilisation, 
and current antimicrobial test standards demand log reductions 
not elimination. It is also important to understand that CL 
disinfection solution efficacy is not just related to the principal 
active ingredients, which is how the analysis in this study was 
performed, but is the sum of a complex interaction of the disin-
fectants with the excipients; storage bottle; CL case; debris in 
the CL case and the CL material. All of these may affect disinfec-
tion capability, a topic beyond the scope of this report but rele-
vant to the fact that in this study, we found polyhexanide-based 
disinfection systems to be the most effective whereas polyhexa-
nide was also the disinfectant in AMO Complete Moisture Plus; 
the principal cause of the last USA outbreak, but for which the 
disinfectant failure was attributed to other components.8
Another novel independent risk factor identified in this 
study was the association with the use of group IV CLs (OR 
6.71, CI 1.31 to 34.29, p 0.022). This had been identified as 
a borderline risk in our study of the previous UK outbreak.7 
Etafilcon A is one of many group IV materials and is one of the 
most widely used in CL manufacture. However, in a previous 
study on the risks of CL-associated keratitis etafilcon A, when 
used as a daily disposable lens, was found to be less associated 
with (predominantly bacterial) keratitis than other lens types.14 
We think that the potential reduction in the risk of the much 
more common problem of bacterial keratitis is likely to offset 
a possible increase in the risk of AK associated with group IV 
CL materials. Therefore, we suggest that group IV lens mate-
rial users, rather than changing lens material, should optimise 
their lens hygiene and avoid wearing CLs when exposed to 
water to minimise their risk of developing AK (which is already 
very small). Lens cleaning has the capacity to remove adherent 
Acanthamoeba.18 This paradoxical finding for group IV lens 
materials, associated with potentially higher risks for AK but 
lower risks for bacterial keratitis, may be explained by differ-
ences in adhesion of Acanthamoeba and bacteria to different 
CL materials. Although not always consistent, and also strain 
dependent, bacteria generally adhere less to etafilcon A than 
to hydrophobic lens surfaces (on group III and many group 
V silicone hydrogels).19 Conversely, Acanthamoeba adherence 
has been shown to be greater to high water content and ionic 
hydrogel CLs (group IV lenses) compared with low water 
content hydrogel CLs (groups I and III)20 although this may 
also be strain dependent.18 On the other hand, Acanthamoeba 
adhesion was shown to be higher to first and second gener-
ation group V CLs than to etafilcon A (group IV) in another 
study, which demonstrates some of the limitations of the in 
vitro investigation of microorganism adherence to unworn CL 
surfaces given that this difference was reduced by the effects of 
lens wear deposits and bacterial biofilm (both of which enhance 
Acanthamoeba trophozoite adhesion).21
Research findings that support the risks of exposure to 
contaminated water are numerous. Deficient hand washing 
(including drying after washing) and water activities while using 
CLs have been associated with AK in this and other studies. 
Showering in CLs was not a statistically significant independent 
risk factor in this study but, given known risks of exposure to 
contaminated water while wearing lenses in other contexts, this 
should be avoided. Contact lens case contamination by Acan-
thamoeba spp has been found in 1%–7% of asymptomatic CL 
users.22 Most water that CL users are exposed to may be contam-
inated by Acanthamoeba; domestic tap water in Turkey,23 South 
Korea,24 Hong Kong22 and the UK3 as well as swimming pool, 
hot tub and lake water.25 Furthermore, in a UK study, genetically 
identical organisms were isolated in the domestic water supply 
of six patients having AK. In the UK the disease is more common 
in hard water areas,3 probably because limescale in taps provides 
an optimal environment for the organism.4 A seasonal associa-
tion with AK has been related to increased participation in swim-
ming in the summer months.11 To establish whether there might 
have been a ‘London Olympic effect’ since 2012, resulting from 
increased participation in swimming by CL users, we compared 
control data from a 2004/2005 study14 with this current data, 
but have shown no difference in swimming activity amongst CL 
users for these two periods (online supplementary table 7).
Given the importance of contaminated domestic water supplies 
in these studies, it follows that small changes in the disinfection 
of domestic water supplies, that might lead to an increase in the 
exposure of the population to water contaminated by Acan-
thamoeba, could have a substantial effect on incidence of AK. 
The incidence of AK among CL users has historically been 5 to 
15-fold higher in the UK than in other countries, probably as a 
result of contaminated domestic tank stored tap water.3 4 In the 
USA implementation of US Environmental Protection Agency 
legislation in 2002, designed to reduce chlorine generated, 
potentially carcinogenic, disinfection by-products, was tempo-
rally related to an outbreak of AK in the Chicago suburbs. This 
legislation had resulted in treatment plants introducing a number 
of measures to minimise disinfection by-products including a 
reduction in the amount of chlorine used and a switch to the use 
of chloramine, a less potent disinfectant than chlorine. These 
measures may have resulted in increased microbial contamina-
tion of the water delivery pipes, providing a larger food source 
for Acanthamoeba and resulting in increased Acanthamoeba 
contamination at end-user sites.26 However, the use of chloram-
inated water supplies (not implemented and therefore not rele-
vant to the Chicago outbreak) was excluded as a potential cause 
of the 2004 national outbreak of AK in the USA.8 In the UK, 
the 1998 European Council Directive 98/83/EC shared similar 
aims. Although the directive was not introduced formally into 
UK national law until January 2010,27 coinciding with the start 
of the current outbreak of AK, informal discussion with three 
of four major suppliers of water to the south east, and scrutiny 
of the Drinking Water Inspectorate website,27 has not identified 
any changes in disinfection procedures in 2010–2011 which 
might have led to increased end-user exposure to contamination 
by Acanthamoeba, above what are probably historically high 
levels due to both the widespread use of domestic tank stored 
water in the UK and the hard water supplies which dominate in 
south east England.
A potential weakness of this study is the difference in recruit-
ment periods for cases and controls. We do not think that this is 
likely to have resulted in significant bias, due to changes in expo-
sure to CL solutions, as there was overlap between the recruit-
ment periods for the cases and that for the first control group

for which findings were confirmed. Unfortunately, changes in 
market share of CL disinfection solutions are proprietary to the 
manufacturers who have not felt able to make these available 
to us. On the other hand, one of the strengths of this study is 
our proven rationale for the choice of both cases and controls 
from patients attending Moorfields A&E service. This minimises 
potential recruitment bias by recruiting both from a similar 
catchment area. We have followed this practice in previous 
studies.7 14 28 In the 2008 study, we used community-derived CL 
controls chosen from the postal code areas in which the cases 
were living for comparison with the A&E control population. 
However, the results of the analyses were no different for the 
community controls (both time consuming and costly to recruit) 
compared to those from the controls derived from the A&E 
Department.14 As a result we chose to use only A&E Department 
controls in the current study.
This study has confirmed a persisting outbreak of AK in the 
south east of England, starting in 2010–2011. This probably 
reflects the situation elsewhere in the UK, at least for hard water 
areas. AK should be a largely preventable disease with over 90% 
of CL users developing AK having identifiable, avoidable risk 
factors.4 We think it unlikely that the current outbreak results 
from any of these current risk factors in isolation. However, if 
the following measures are taken the risk of developing AK is 
likely to be very low: improving CL and hand hygiene when 
inserting lenses, avoiding the contamination of CLs with water 
including when engaging in water activities while using CLs, 
avoiding the use of CL solutions by switching to daily disposable 
CL use or, for those continuing to wear reusable lenses, main-
tenance of optimal lens care with effective solutions. Publicity 
for these measures, as in the 1991–1995 UK outbreak,12 can be 
expected to rapidly reduce the incidence of AK. Water avoidance 
publicity for CL users (by water companies, water sports facili-
ties, the CL industry and eye care professionals) can be expected 
to reduce the incidence in the longer term. The addition of ‘no 
water’ labelling on all CL packaging29 should become mandatory. 
Ongoing surveillance of AK incidence by major UK ophthalmic 
units will identify future changes in incidence more rapidly 
than for this current outbreak and trigger the establishment of 
a case control study to identify avoidable causes. Surveillance of 
end-user domestic water contamination by the water companies 
is currently limited to measuring faecal bacterial contamination: 
the addition of Acanthamoeba to this panel can be expected to 
contribute to our understanding of local variations in the risk of 
exposure and make CL users aware of the importance of main-
taining preventive measures.
