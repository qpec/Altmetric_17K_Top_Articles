Rotavirus is the most common cause of moderate-to-severe infant diarrhoea in developing countries,
resulting in enormous morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. A bovine-human reassortant pentava-
lent rotavirus vaccine (BRV-PV) targeting the globally most common strains was developed in India and
tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled end-point driven Phase III efficacy clinical trial
implemented at six sites across India. Infants 6 to 8 weeks of age were randomized (1:1) to receive three
oral doses of BRV-PV or placebo at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age along with routine vaccines. Home visit
surveillance was conducted to detect severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (SRVGE) and safety outcomes until
the children reached two years of age. A total of 3749 infants received BRV-PV while 3751 received pla-
cebo. At the time of the primary end-point (when the minimum number of cases needed for analysis were
accrued) the vaccine efficacy against SRVGE was 36% (95% CI 11.7, 53.6, p = 0.0067) in the per protocol
(PP) analysis, and 41.9% (95% CI 21.1, 57.3, p = 0.0005) in the intent to treat (ITT) analysis. Vaccine efficacy
over the entire follow-up period (until children reached two years of age) was 39.5% (95% CI 26.7, 50,
p < 0.0001) in the PP analysis and 38.8% (95% CI, 26.4, 49, p < 0.0001) in the ITT analysis. Vaccine efficacy
against the very severe rotavirus cases (VSRVGE, Vesikari score � 16) was 60.5% (95% CI 17.7, 81,
p = 0.0131) at the time of the primary analysis and 54.7% (95% CI 29.7, 70.8, p = 0.0004) for the complete
follow-period in the PP population. The incidence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events
were similar in both the vaccine and placebo groups. Likewise, the number of intussusceptions and
deaths were similar between both groups. Thus, BRV-PV is an effective, well tolerated and safe vaccine
in Indian infants. (Trial registration: Clinical Trials.Gov [NCT 02133690] and Clinical Trial Registry of

 1. Introduction
As per an estimate for 2013, 37% of the 578,000 diarrhoeal
deaths worldwide in children less than 5 years of age were caused
by rotavirus that year, leading to 215,000 deaths in this age group;
most of which were in Asia and Africa, with around 22% in India
[1]. In India alone, it is estimated that 11.37 million episodes of
rotavirus gastroenteritis occur every year, requiring 3.27 million
outpatient visits and 872,000 inpatient admissions [2].
Currently two rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix and RotaTeq) are
licensed
internationally
and
are
World
Health
Organization
(WHO) prequalified [3,4]. A third vaccine (ROTAVAC) was recently
licensed in India [5]. Despite this, there remains an overwhelming
need for cost-effective and safe rotavirus vaccines for the countries
that need them the most.
Using indigenous manufacturing technology at Serum Institute
of India Pvt Ltd (SIIPL), a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (BRV-PV)
was developed from five Bovine (UK) X Human Rotavirus Reassor-
tant strains (serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9) received from the
US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Initial studies on a quadri-
valent formulation of the G1, G2, G3, and G4 reassortants con-
ducted in the US and Finland demonstrated that they are safe,
well tolerated, immunogenic, and efficacious [6–8]. Three clinical
studies (one Phase I and two Phase II) were conducted with the
BRV-PV in India. The vaccine was found safe and immunogenic in
these studies, and the immunogenicity results were similar to
those reported for the licensed vaccines in India [9].
We conducted a large Phase III study to assess the clinical effi-
cacy of the vaccine in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis
(SRVGE) and expand on the safety observations made in the earlier
trials. This paper gives results from the complete analysis of the
study.
2. Material and methods
The trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
endpoint-driven study to assess the efficacy and safety of the
BRV-PV in healthy Indian Infants. Subjects were followed from
the time of vaccination until 2 years of age for efficacy and safety
outcomes. During this period, there were 8 visits by subjects to
the study clinics, in addition to active surveillance consisting of
weekly home visits by the field workers (FWs) to detect, character-
ize and collect stool specimens from all occurring episodes of gas-
troenteritis (GE). The study was initiated in May 2014 and
conducted at clinical sites across six cities in India (Pune, Kolkata,
Sewagram, Delhi, Manipal, and Jammu). The results presented in
this paper represent all the safety data gathered for the vaccine,
as well as efficacy data collected when the primary efficacy end-
point was met and efficacy data for the entire follow-up, i.e.,
through 2 years of age. The subjects were randomized to receive
three oral doses of BRV-PV or placebo at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of
age along with the routine DTP-HB-Hib and oral polio vaccines.
There was no restriction on breastfeeding around the time of vac-
cination. The parents were provided with mobile phones to ensure
prompt contact with the study team in case the infants had gas-
troenteritis or any other illness. The parents were also given a diar-
rhoea diary card (DDC) to capture signs and symptoms of
gastroenteritis including diarrhoea, vomiting, and fever, instructed
in its completion, and provided with a digital thermometer to
monitor body temperature. Diarrhoea was defined as 3 or more
watery or looser than normal stools within 24 h. Parents were
instructed to notify the study team on the onset of diarrhoea, com-
plete the DDC and collect a stool sample in containers provided to
them. The FWs visited the families of all subjects with GE and
reviewed the DDCs; GE cases were evaluated for dehydration
based on the WHO criteria [10] by trained FWs or study physicians.
Sick subjects received prompt medical care by study physicians
and by the referral hospitals. Visits continued on alternate days
until the GE episode resolved to ensure the wellbeing of the child
as well as appropriate data capture on the DDC. A GE episode
was considered resolved when the child was free from diarrhoea
for at least 5 consecutive days.
The information from the DDC was used to grade the GE epi-
sodes as per the Vesikari Scoring System [11]. An episode of GE
with a score of �11 was classified as ‘severe’ and constituted an
endpoint for the primary analysis. Episodes with a �16 score were
classified as ‘very severe,’ 7–10 as ‘moderate,’ and less than 7 as
‘mild’ GE.
Stool samples were tested at the Welcome Trust Research Lab-
oratory, Christian Medical College, Vellore for rotavirus by a vali-
dated ELISA assay [12]. Rotaviruses detected in stool samples
were further characterised for genotypes by reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). If an ELISA positive sample
was found un-typable for both VP7 and VP4 genes, the sample
was tested for VP6 gene by PCR. If the VP6 was negative in RT-
PCR, the result of the ELISA was considered false positive. If the
VP6 was positive, nucleotide sequencing was attempted in order
to complete the genotyping. All of the tests were conducted under
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards.
A case of SRVGE constituted a clinical endpoint for the primary
analysis of the study. For children experiencing more than one epi-
sode of SRVGE, only the first episode was counted towards the pri-
mary endpoint.
This was an event-driven study in which the primary analysis
was assessment of efficacy against SRVGE occurring after 14 days
from the last dose among subjects who received all 3 doses. This
primary analysis was to take place when at least 122 cases of
SRVGE were accrued or when all the subjects reached 2 years of
age, whichever was earlier. This report provides vaccine efficacy
data collected up to 11 October 2015, when 155 cases had accrued
(primary analysis), as well as a full 2-years of efficacy data (com-
plete analysis).
2.1. Safety assessment
The enrolled subjects were followed for safety outcomes
through 2 years of age, including severe unsolicited adverse events
(AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and the occurrence of
intussusception. Close monitoring for post-vaccination safety was
conducted in a sub-cohort of 1009 infants (reactogenicity cohort).
Parents of children in this reactogenicity cohort were given a post-
immunization diary card (PIDC) to record solicited reactions
(diarrhoea, fever, vomiting, decreased appetite, decreased activity
level, and irritability) daily for 7 days post vaccination. To ensure
compliance, FWs made home visits on Day 3 (+2) after each vacci-
nation, when the PIDC was reviewed and the parents were ques-
tioned about unsolicited events. An additional home visit was
made on Day 7 (�1 to +2) to review and collect the PIDC. Infants
in the reactogenicity cohort were closely monitored until 28 days
after the third investigational product dose and all unsolicited
AEs of any severity grade were documented.
A protocol safety review team (PSRT) comprised by physicians
from SIIPL, PATH, and DiagnoSearch Pvt Ltd (the contract research
organization supporting the study) continuously monitored the
safety findings in the study. An independent data safety monitor-
ing board (DSMB) comprised of independent physicians and bio-
statistician provided additional oversight on the study subjects’
safety.
Surveillance for intussusception was maintained throughout
the study. Study physicians were trained to identify warning signs
and ensure prompt evaluation and treatment as indicated. All
potential cases were reviewed by an independent intussusception

6229
 adjudication committee (IAC) that included a paediatric surgeon, a
paediatrician, and a radiologist. Cases determined by the IAC as
meeting criteria for Level 1 of diagnostic certainty according to
the Brighton Collaboration definition of intussusception [13] were
reported as intussusception.
2.2. Study vaccines
The BRV-PV is a live attenuated pentavalent rotavirus vaccine
containing five single gene substitution reassortants between
human strains G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 and the bovine UK strain.
The viruses were grown in VERO cells at a titre of �105.6 FFU/
serotype/dose. The vaccine was formulated as a lyophilized pow-
der containing5% sucrose and glycine as stabilizer. The placebo
was a lyophilized powder containing all the vaccine constituents
except the viruses. Citrated sodium bicarbonate containing 25.6 g
of sodium bicarbonate and 9.6 g citric acid per litre available in a
separate vial was used as diluent for both vaccine and placebo.
The vaccine and placebo were visually undistinguishable. The
BRV-PV is stable at 25 �Cfor 30 months and at 40 �Cfor 18 months.
Since this was the pivotal trial to support licensure, the study vac-
cines were transported and stored at 2–8 �C out of caution. All the
study vaccine containers looked identical with unique vial num-
bers printed on them to maintain blinding.
Four batches of BRV-PV were used during the study; 145O2001,
145O2002, 145O2003, and 145E40010Z. The batches were consistent
in virus titres of all five serotypes as follows: Batch 145E0010Z-

5.934–6.027 Log10FFU/vial, Batch 145O2003-titre range 5.971–
6.033 Log10FFU/vial.
Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive vaccine or
placebo in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated allocation sched-
ule. Randomization was stratified by sites and a block size of 6 was
used to ensure 1:1 balance within each site. The assignments were
provided to the sites by a validated interactive web response sys-
tem (IWRS). After obtaining consent, a unique subject identification
code (Subject ID) was allocated to each subject through IWRS and a
corresponding study vaccine kit was used for that subject.
Each kit contained one vial of lyophilized vaccine/placebo, one
vial of diluent, one vial adapter and one 5 mL syringe for vaccine
reconstitution. For reconstitution, the adapter was fixed to the syr-
inge and the syringe/adapter was connected to the diluent vial. By
pulling the plunger back, diluent was aspirated into the syringe.
The assembly was removed from diluent vial and was connected
to the vaccine/placebo vial. The entire content of the syringe was
injected into the vial. By pulling the plunger back, 2.5 mL of recon-
stituted solution was aspirated from vial into the syringe. Then the
syringe was removed from the adapter and was ready for adminis-
tration. The vaccine was used within one hour of reconstitution
though the reconstituted vaccine is stable for 24 h at 2–8 �C and
at room temperature and for 3 h at 40 �C. If the subject drooled
or spit the product, the dose was not repeated. If a subject vomited
within 5 min after study vaccination, or if the kit was damaged, a
backup kit was allocated to the subject through the IWRS system.
2.3. Study participants
The study was conducted at six urban/semi-urban/rural study
sites across India that represent different climatic, geographical,
and sociocultural environments. The subjects were 6- to 8-week-
old healthy infants whose parents gave written informed consent
and who were residents of the study area. Infants with ongoing
diarrhoea or vomiting, fever, or any acute disease were temporarily
excluded. Other key exclusion criteria were: significant malnutri-
tion (weight-for-height Z score � �3 SD, median) [14]; any
systemic disorder; congenital abdominal disorder; history of
persistent diarrhoea, intussusception, or abdominal surgery; sus-
pected immune compromised status; allergy to any components
of the study vaccines; or known major congenital defect. If a study
subject suffered from an immediate hypersensitivity reaction fol-
lowing vaccination, significant illness, underwent major surgery,
had a protocol violation, or received licensed rotavirus vaccine
prior to receipt of all study doses, the infant did not receive subse-
quent vaccination, though the safety follow up continued.
2.4. Immunological assays
A sub-cohort of 219 randomly selected infants from among
those enrolled early in the study (immunogenicity cohort) was
examined for IgA seroresponses against rotavirus and neutralizing
antibody responses against the three poliovirus vaccine serotypes.
Serum samples from these infants were obtained just before vacci-
nation and 4 weeks after the third vaccine dose. A seroresponse for
rotavirus was defined as �3-fold increase in IgA titre between
post-vaccination and pre-vaccination sera. The IgA was analysed
at the Welcome Trust Research Laboratory, Christian Medical Col-
lege laboratory in Vellore by a conventional ELISA assay using
rotavirus-infected cell culture lysate [15]. The polio neutralization
assays were conducted at the Enterovirus Research Centre in
Mumbai following WHO-recommended procedures [16].
2.5. Statistical analysis
The trial was event-driven with the primary efficacy analysis
to be triggered by the accrual of 122 SRVGE cases (primary end-
point). Under the assumptions of 50% true vaccine efficacy (95%
CI lower bound 10%), attack rate of SRVGE of 2.5%, and drop-
out rate of 15%, 7500 infants were required to achieve statistical
power of 90%. The point estimate of the vaccine efficacy (VE) for
SRVGE, i.e., (1-Hazard Ratio of the vaccine group, relative to the
placebo group) � 100%, and the 95% CI were calculated using
the Cox Proportionate Hazards model. The World Wald Test based
on the Cox model was calculated at a 1-sided level of 0.025 (this
test rejects H₀ if and only if the 2-sided 95% CI for VE lies above
10%). A successful outcome for the vaccine was defined as lower
bound of two sided 95% CI more than 10%, thus demonstrating
efficacy of the vaccine.
Two efficacy populations were analysed. The Per Protocol (PP)
population included all subjects who received all three doses of
study vaccine/placebo as per the randomization by 32 weeks of
age and were free from any major protocol deviation. The RVGE
endpoints in this population were counted from 14 days after the
third vaccination. The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population included
all randomized subjects receiving at least one vaccine/placebo dose
(including those receiving an incorrect product). Primary end-
points in this population were counted from the time of the first
vaccination. The safety population included all the enrolled
subjects.
The PP population was the dataset for the primary efficacy anal-
ysis. Secondary efficacy endpoints were tested on both the PP pop-
ulation and the ITT population and included: VE against RVGE of
any severity, VE against SRVGE in the first year of life, VE against
SRVGE over the entire follow-up period, VE against SRVGE associ-
ated with rotavirus serotypes included in the vaccine, VE against
SRVGE with hospitalization (�24 h), VE against SRVGE with dehy-
dration (defined as per WHO criteria [10]), and vaccine impact on
the incidence of SRVGE. An additional post hoc analysis of vaccine
efficacy against very severe RVGE (VSRVGE) was conducted on the
subset of cases with a Vesikari score �16.
Safety endpoints were analysed for all infants enrolled (safety
population). They included: immediate AEs within 30 min of each
6230
P.S. Kulkarni et al. / Vaccine 35 (2017) 6228–6237
 vaccination; severe unsolicited AEs; SAEs; GE events; death; and
intussusceptions. In addition, solicited AEs within 7 days of each
vaccination and unsolicited AEs of any grade until 28 days after last
vaccination were examined in the reactogenicity cohort of infants.
Exact p values were computed for solicited AEs and selected unso-
licited AEs. All safety endpoints were presented in numbers and
percentages. Gender was presented in percentages while age,
weight, and length were presented with mean, median, and stan-
dard deviation. All analyses were performed using SAS� version
9.2.
For the immunological assays, the number and percentage (%)
of subjects with seroresponses to rotavirus and polio serotypes 1,
2, and 3 are presented by study arm along with two-sided exact
95% CI based on the Clopper-Pearson method. Seroconversion for
rotavirus vaccine was defined as percentage of subjects with �3-
fold increase in rotavirus IgA titres at Day 28 (±7 days) post dose
3 with respect to baseline values. Seroconversion for polio antibod-
ies was defined as (a) for participants seronegative at the baseline
time point, neutralizing antibody titres >1:8; and (b) for partici-
pants seropositive at the baseline time point, neutralizing antibody
titres that are �4-fold higher than the expected titre of maternal
antibodies based on the pre-vaccination titre declining with a
half-life of 28 days. The comparison of the study arms was carried
out by constructing the rate difference between the study arms
and the corresponding two-sided 95% CI using the Wilson Score
method.
2.6. Ethical considerations
The study was performed in accordance with the International
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical
Practice (GCP) E6 (R1), GCP guidelines by the Central Drug Stan-
dard Control Organization Government of India, Schedule Y,
Amended 2005 under Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules, and
the Declaration of Helsinki, 2013. All subjects were enrolled only
after written consent of their parents. The process of consent was
recorded audio-visually as required by prevalent regulations in
India. The study was approved by the Drugs Controller General of
India as well as by the respective Institutional Ethics Committees
of all the participating sites and the Western Institutional Review
Board, Puyallup, Washington, USA. All subjects were given prompt
medical care for any health issues.
3. Results
Of the 7505 subjects randomized, 5 did not receive any doses
(parents withdrew consent before vaccination). A total of 7500
infants were enrolled in the study, of which 3749 received the
BRV-PV and 3751 received placebo (Fig. 1). Of the 7500 infants,
252 received only the first dose, 88 received only two doses, and
7161 (95.4%) went on to receive all three doses (Table 1). A total
of 3781 participants (50.4%) were male. The mean age at baseline
was 48 days in both groups. No differences in weight at birth, or
weight or length at enrolment, were observed between the vaccine
and placebo groups (Table 2). At the time of the primary analysis,
7237 subjects were part of the study. Of these 7025 subjects were
available for PP analysis. (Table 1). A total of 7034 subjects com-
pleted the study and 466 subjects discontinued the study before
completion due to reasons like withdrawal of consent, migration,
death, investigator discretion and lost to follow up (Fig. 1). A total
of 7035 subjects were part of PP population for the final efficacy
analysis (Table 1).
3.1. Primary efficacy analysis
For the primary endpoint, the PP population analysis of efficacy
included 61 cases of SRVGE reported in the vaccine group and 94
cases reported in the placebo group for a vaccine efficacy of 36%
(95% CI 11.7, 53.6, p: 0.0067) (Table 3). For the corresponding ITT
analysis, including all 7500 infants receiving at least one dose, 65
cases of SRVGE were reported in the vaccine group and 110 cases
in the placebo group for a vaccine efficacy of 41.9% (95% CI 21.1,
57.3, p: 0.0005). For VSRVGE (Vesikari score � 16) in the PP popu-
lation, 10 and 25 cases were reported in the vaccine and placebo
groups, respectively, for an efficacy of 60.5% (95% CI 17.7, 81.0, p:
0.01); the corresponding VE for VSRVGE in the ITT population
was 61.3% (95% CI 22.2, 80.7, p: 0.007) (Table 3).
By the time of the primary analysis, a total of 144cases of RVGE
of any severity had been reported in the vaccine group and 197 in
the placebo group for an efficacy of 28.3% (95% CI 11.1, 42.2, p:
0.0024). The corresponding VE in the ITT population was 35.5%
(95% CI 21.4, 47.1, p: <0.0001) (Table 3). The levels of efficacy
improved as the severity of RVGE increased (Fig. 2 and Supplemen-
tal Table 1).

 By the time of the primary analysis 35 cases of SRVGE had been
hospitalized in the vaccine group and 53 cases in the placebo group
(efficacy 34.8%, 95% CI 0.0, 57.4, p = 0.05) For the ITT population,
the efficacy against SRVGE with hospitalization was 42.2% (95%
CI 13.2, 61.5, p = 0.008) (Table 3).
3.2. 2-year efficacy analysis
Over the entire follow-up period (through 2 years of age) the
efficacy analysis included 171 cases of SRVGE reported in the vac-
cine group and 275 cases reported in the placebo group for a vac-
cine efficacy of 39.5% (95% CI 26.7, 50, p < 0.0001) (Table 4). For the
corresponding ITT analysis, 186 cases were reported in the vaccine
group and 296 in the placebo group for a vaccine efficacy of 38.8%
(95% CI 26.4, 49.0, p < 0.0001) (Table 4). For VSRVGE (Vesikari
score � 16) in the PP population, 29 and 63 cases were reported
in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively, for an efficacy of
54.7% (95% CI 29.7, 70.8 p = 0.0004); the corresponding VE for
VSRVGE in the ITT population was 52.9% (95% CI 28.2, 69.1,
p = 0.0005) (Table 4).
For the 2-year analysis, 492 cases of RVGE of any severity
were reported in the vaccine group and 614 in the placebo group
for an efficacy of 22.6% (95% CI 12.9, 31.3, p < 0.0001) in the PP
population. The corresponding VE in the ITT population was
24.2% (95% CI 15.1, 32.4, p < 0.0001) (Table 4).
Over the entire follow-up period the SRVGE cases with hospi-
talization were 95 in the vaccine group and 140 in the placebo
group (VE 33.4% 95% CI, 13.6, 48.7, p = 0.002) in the PP population,
and 101 cases in the vaccine group and 153 in the placebo group
(VE 35%, 95% CI, 16.6, 49.5, p = 0.0007) in the ITT population
(Table 4).
Overall, vaccination resulted in a drop in SRVGE incidence of
1.77 cases per 100 person-years from 4.56 in the placebo group
to 2.79 in the vaccine group (ITT population) over the two years
of follow-up.
The great majority of SRVGE cases (�90%) over the entire period
of follow-up were associated with the serotypes included in the
vaccine, i.e., serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 (range: 34–74 cases).
Only a few cases ofG10 and G12 rotaviruses were identified. The

SRVGE
cases
due

the
G
serotypes
represented in the vaccine included 185 cases reported in the vac-

cacy of 38.2% (95% CI 25.7, 48.6, p<0.0001) in the ITT population
(Table 4 and Supplemental Table 2). The corresponding vaccine
efficacy for primary analysis in the ITT population was 40.8%
(95% CI 19.5, 56.5, p = 0.0008) (Table 3).

 3.3. Safety results
There were two AEs occurring within 30 min of vaccination
among vaccine recipients, one each of discoloration of oral mucosa
observed after the second dose and decreased appetite following
the first dose. The events were mild in severity and brief indura-
tion. Such events did not recur with subsequent doses. There were
19 and 12 episodes of vomiting within 5 min of receiving BRV-PV
and placebo, respectively.

 during the 7 days post each vaccination for subjects in the reacto-
genicity cohort (n = 1009). A total of 1347 solicited AEs in 399 sub-
jects were observed in the vaccine group and 1281 events in 400
subjects in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects report-
ing solicited events of fever, decreased appetite, decreased activity,
vomiting,
and
diarrhoea
were
similar
between
study
arms
(p = 0.386–1.0,
Fisher’s
exact
test),
however
irritability
was
reported with higher frequency in the vaccine group (42.6%) in
comparison to the placebo group (36.1%). Most of the cases of irri-
tability were mild and there were no grade 3 cases of irritability in
the study. The results are presented in Table 5 and Supplemental
Table 3. The solicited reactions were generally mild, and of short
duration except for 5 cases of severe fever, defined as a tempera-
ture of �39.5 – <40.5 �C (4 in the BRV and 1 in the placebo group).
The incidence of solicited reactions was lower after the second and
third dose as compared to the first (Supplemental Table 3). Unso-
licited AEs were observed up to 28 days post-last dose in the reac-
togenicity cohort. A total of 361 subjects in the BRV-PV group and
321 subjects in the placebo group (p = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test)
reported a total of 1476 unsolicited events up to 28 days post-
last dose. Lower respiratory tract infections occurred in greater
number of subjects in BRV-PV group (n = 60) as compared to pla-
cebo group (n = 38) (p-0.019, Fisher’s exact test). These findings
were not corroborated in the safety population which included
all the randomized children (see below).
3.5. Safety population
Safety evaluations in the safety population, which included all
randomized children, were only recorded for grade 3 or higher
AEs. A total of 250 subjects (6.6%) in the placebo group and 222
subjects (5.9%) in the vaccine group reported 269 and 241 severe
non-serious AEs, respectively, through the end of the study. The
proportions of subjects with non-serious unsolicited events were
similar in both groups (p-0.199, Fisher’s exact test).
A total of 3320 SAEs were reported in 2225 of the 7500 enrolled
subjects (29.6%) by the time of final analysis; they were experienced
by 1109 subjects in the BRV-PV group and 1116 subjects in the pla-
cebo group (Table 6). The proportion of subjects with SAEs between
the study arms was similar (P = 0.879, Fisher’s exact test). The type
and incidence of unsolicited events and SAEs observed from the time
of the first vaccination through the time of the primary analysis are
typical of the background morbidity in the Indian infant population
and included lower respiratory tract infection (8.38% of vaccine
recipients, 8.42% in placebo recipients); gastroenteritis (8.24% of vac-
cine recipients, 9.09% of placebo recipients); pyrexia (2.77% of vac-
cine recipients, 2.69% of placebo recipients); bronchiolitis (2.32% of
vaccine recipients, 2.08% of placebo recipients) and bronchopneumo-
nia (2.00% of vaccine recipients, 2.21% of placebo recipients). None of
the SAEs led to study discontinuation over this period. There were 16
deaths in the BRV-PV arm and 16 deaths in the placebo arm, and
none were related to the study products. Causes of deaths were
diverse and included infections such as meningitis, pneumonia,
encephalitis, dengue, aspiration, acute leukaemia, septic shock, sud-
den infant death syndrome, and multi-organ failure following sur-
gery for congenital heart defect (Supplemental Table 4). Thirteen
cases of intussusception were diagnosed; 6 occurred in the BRV-PV
arm and 7 in the placebo arm. None occurred within 28 days of
receiving a dose of BRV-PV or placebo. None were related to study
vaccination or led to discontinuations from the study.
IgA seroresponses were demonstrated in 39 of 116 (33.6%) vac-
cine recipients in the immunogenicity cohort, and 10 of 103 pla-
cebo recipients (9.7%) (Table 7). Seroconversions to poliovirus
serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were observed in 96.6%, 96.6% and 92.2% of
infants, respectively, in the vaccine group, and 97.1%, 100%, and
94.2%, respectively, in the placebo group (Table 8).

 4. Discussion
The study demonstrated efficacy of BRV-PV against SRVGE
(36%), the primary study endpoint, as well as against RVGE of
any severity (28.3%). These efficacy levels were maintained
through the second year of life, with an overall efficacy of 39.5%
against SRVGE and 22.6% against RVGE of any severity. All of the
pre-established secondary efficacy endpoints confirmed these find-
ings as well as the ITT analyses. The vaccine prevented 42.5% of
hospitalizations due to SRVGE in the primary analysis, and 35.1%
over the full 2-year follow-up (ITT analysis). This has great signif-
icance in countries like India where access to medical care is often
difficult. Another significant finding was that BRV-PV prevented
more than 50% of very severe rotavirus infections, which represent
the highest risk of dehydration, hospitalization, and death. This
was shown both, at the time of the primary analysis as well as at
the completion of the follow-p through two years.
RotaTeq and Rotarix have shown high levels of efficacy in devel-
oped countries, ranging from 98% (95% CI 88–100) in the United
States and Finland [17] to 85% (95% CI42-97) in Finland alone
[18]. A quadrivalent vaccine containing four of the five strains pre-
sent in the BRV-PV showed a high level of efficacy (90%) in a small
study in Finland [8]. However, when tested in the developing
world, the efficacy of RotaTeq and Rotarix has been shown to be
diminished. The efficacy of RotaTeq has been as low as39.3%
(95% CI 19.1–54.7) in Africa [19] and 48.3% (95% CI 22.3–66.1) in
Asia [20]; while the efficacy of Rotarix in Malawi was 49.4% (95%
CI 19.2–68.3) [21]. ROTAVAC, the only other rotavirus vaccine
tested for efficacy in India, showed an efficacy of 53.6% (95% CI
35.0–66.9) [5]. Our results with BRV-PV in India are in line with
these results. A recent study conducted in Niger with the same
BRV-PV and under a design similar to that of our study, showed
66.7% efficacy against SRVGE and 78.8% against VSRVGE [22].
Differences in the population, the epidemiology of the disease,
age at the time of SRVGE, and treatment practices may account
for the observed difference in efficacy of BRV-PV between the
two studies.
The reasons for the lower efficacy figures between developed
and
resource-limited
countries
have
not
been
completely
elucidated, however they may include high levels of transplacen-
tally transmitted antibodies in the child gut, malnutrition, breast
feeding, interfering gut flora, and co-infections, all common in
resource-limited countries [23].
Of interest, the efficacy of RotaTeq against very severe, poten-
tially life-threatening RVGE was 40.7% (95% CI 3.3–64.2) in Africa
[19] and 70% (95% CI 31.8, 88.3) in Asia [20]. The corresponding fig-
ure for BRV-PV was 60.5% (95% CI 17.7, 81.0) in the period up to the
primary analysis, when the children averaged 12.4 months of age
and 52.9% for the entire 2-year follow-up period. The correspond-
ing figures for ROTAVAC in India was 54.4% (95% CI 18.3–82.6) at
the time of primary analysis [5] and 57.2% (95% CI 0.3 to 81.9)
for the entire 2-year follow-up period [24]. At the other end of
the severity spectrum, it is well known that even in developed
countries RV vaccine efficacy is lower against less severe GE epi-
sodes; in our study, the efficacy of BRV-PV against RVGE of any
severity at the time of the primary analysis (28% in the PP analysis,
35% in the ITT analysis) was in line with similar analysis for Rota-
Teq in Africa (30.5%) [19], ROTAVAC in India (36.4%) [5], Rotarix in
Malawi (34.7%) [21], and BRV-PV in Niger (34.5%) [22]. The equiv-
alent analysis for the entire follow-up period revealed an efficacy
of 22.6% in the PP analysis and 24.2% in the ITT analysis, which is
also in line with the results of observed with other vaccines.
Comparison of efficacy levels across trials of different rotavirus
vaccines is challenging given the multiple variables involved (e.g.,
trial design, data collection, populations, disease epidemiology,
burden of GE, associated interventions, etc.). An important factor
to take into account in such comparisons is the type of surveillance
applied to detect GE episodes. For example, in the RotaTeq studies
in Africa where surveillance was passive (cases were detected
when brought to medical facilities), a larger percentage of cases
were of greater severity (61.6% of the cases were �11 with the
Vesikari score) than those in this trial (43% of the cases scored
�11). As noted above, vaccine efficacy estimates are typically
higher for the cases of greater severity within the same study.
Another factor that affects comparisons of data across trials is
the indiscriminate use of the Vesikari score whose application
may differ widely across studies, and even across sites within a
given study. There are seven scoring parameters included in the

 system:
diarrhoea, vomiting, fever,
dehydration, duration
of
diarrhoea, duration of vomiting, and treatment (rehydration and
hospitalization) [11]. While evaluation of the first six parameters
would appear to be objective, evaluation of the treatment param-
eter can vary greatly among health care providers. In our study,
in which we were very cautious with respect to participant safety,
we instituted oral rehydration therapy immediately at the onset of
diarrhoea, a practice that may have influenced the course of the
episode and thus lowered the potential score. Also, hospitalization
and intravenous rehydration may have happened in some non-
severe cases which might have inflated scores resulting in reduced
vaccine efficacy for SRVGE. To avoid the potential biases intro-
duced by these practices in the future, there is a need for more
objective ways to assess disease severity in GE clinical trials, espe-
cially before interventions are started.
BRV-PV consists of G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 serotypes, and our
study found that G1, G2, G3, G9, and G12 were responsible for
about 90% of the SRVGE in the study population, indicating that
the vaccine can induce broad protection. This finding is important
for potential use of the vaccine globally.
The BRV-PV was well tolerated when given together with
DTP-HB-Hib and oral polio vaccines. The incidence of immediate
solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and deaths were similarly dis-
tributed in both the groups. The incidence of irritability was higher
in the vaccine group, though this may be an incidental finding.
The only SAEs for which the vaccine was assessed by site inves-
tigators as causally related to study products were 12 cases of gas-
troenteritis that occurred within 7 days post-vaccination. Of these,
7 were in the BRV-PV group and 5 were in the placebo group. Inci-
dentally, of these 12, only one tested positive while 11 tested neg-
ative for rotavirus antigen in stool by ELISA, thus making it unlikely
that the illnesses were caused by the vaccine. Genotyping analysis
of the single rotavirus positive case revealed it not to be the vac-
cine strain.
In some settings, post-marketing surveillance of the currently
available rotavirus vaccines has detected a small increased risk of
intussusception of about 1–2/100,000 infants vaccinated [25–28].
In our study, no cases of intussusception occurred within 28 days
of vaccinations. The incidence was also similar in BRV-PV and pla-
cebo groups. Though the study is not powered to discriminate for
events of rare incidence, these findings are reassuring.
The rate of IgA seroresponses observed in this population (33%),
while low, is similar to that of other rotavirus vaccine studies in
India [29]. Responses to all three serotypes in the concomitantly
administered oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) were similar among
placebo and vaccine recipients, demonstrating that BRV-PV did
not interfere with OPV takes, a general concern that has been
raised for other rotavirus vaccines, but which has not been sub-
stantiated for any [30,31].
Transport and storage of vaccines at 2–8 �C has become an
important challenge due to the introduction of newer vaccines
[32–35], especially for countries with insufficient cold-chain
capacities [36–39]. As a result, WHO has shown a preference for
heat- and freeze-stable vaccines for supply to United Nations agen-
cies [40]. BRV-PV is a highly heat-stable vaccine [41]. Based on the
stability data, the recommendation for post-licensure use will be to
store the vaccine below 25 �C. This will be very important in set-
tings where power failures are common and where immunizations
in remote villages are conducted in outreach programmes.
One potential ethical concern related to our study was that it
was conducted as a placebo-controlled study. However, at the time
of study launch, no licensed rotavirus vaccines that had undergone
efficacy testing in India were available, and rotavirus vaccines were
not yet a part of the routine immunization programme. Moreover,
we maintained a high safety network in the study to ensure
prompt and free treatment in case of any medical events. In
addition, a WHO consultation held in 2013 confirmed this study
design as ethically acceptable [42].
5. Conclusions
The BRV-PV developed in India was found efficacious and safe
in Indian infants and can be a cost-effective and heat-stable option
in the global strategy for diarrhoea prevention.
