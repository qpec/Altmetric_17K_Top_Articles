Abstract
In October, 2015, China’s one-child policy was replaced by a universal two-child policy. The 
effects of the new policy are inevitably speculative, but predictions can be made based on recent 
trends. The population increase will be relatively small, peaking at 1·45 billion in 2029 (compared 
with a peak of 1·4 billion in 2023 if the one-child policy continued). The new policy will allow 
almost all Chinese people to have their preferred number of children. The benefits of the new 
policy include: a large reduction in abortions of unapproved pregnancies, virtual elimination of the 
problem of unregistered children, and a more normal sex ratio. All of these effects should improve 
health outcomes. Effects of the new policy on the shrinking workforce and rapid population ageing 
will not be evident for two decades. In the meantime, more sound policy actions are needed to 
meet the social, health, and care needs of the elderly population.
Introduction
In October, 2015, China announced that the iconic one-child policy had finally been 
replaced by a universal two-child policy. This change is highly significant because, for the 
first time in 36 years, no one in China is restricted to having just one child. In this Review, 
we examine the evidence for the potential effects of this shift in policy. The consequences 
are inevitably speculative, but a body of research has developed that aims to foresee the 
demographic, health, social, and policy effects of the universal two-child policy. Because 
much of this research is based on the effects of the preceding policy, we start with an 
analysis of the impact and controversies surrounding the one-child policy.
The one-child policy
The one-child policy was introduced in 1979 by the Chinese Government who considered 
population containment as essential to lifting China out of severe poverty caused by decades

 of economic mismanagement.1 Between 1950 and 1970, the population had increased from 
540 million to more than 800 million.2 In response, the government introduced the mostly 
voluntary later-longer-fewer policy in the 1970s, which encouraged later childbearing, 
longer spacing between children, and fewer children. This policy led to a large fall in the 
total fertility rate from an estimated 5·9 births per woman in 1970, to 2·9 births per woman 
by 1979. Despite this downward trajectory in fertility, fears of overpopulation persisted, and 
so the one-child policy was introduced. Following the introduction of the policy, the total 
fertility rate continued to fall but less precipitously. Data from numerous sources showed 
that by the late 1990s the total fertility rate had fallen to between 1·5 and 1·7, and it has 
remained at this level since (figure 1).4,5
The one-child rule was strictly enforced for urban residents, who in 1980 accounted for 
about 20% of the population, but nearly half by 2010. In rural areas, this rule was 
particularly unpopular and deemed virtually unenforceable,6 so from 1984 rural couples in 
most provinces were allowed to have a second child if their first was a girl, the so-called 1·5-
child policy. In the six northwestern provinces, all rural couples were allowed a second 
child, irrespective of the sex of the first child. Two or more children were allowed for ethnic 
minorities, who account for around 9% of the total population.2 These variations created a 
substantial difference in total fertility rate between rural and urban regions.7 Enforcement 
was the responsibility of the then powerful National Family Planning Commission. The 
system of penalties was unpopular and inconsistently applied, with wide variations across 
the country, often at the discretion of local officials.8
As one of the most controversial policies in history, debate has raged over the positive and 
negative effects of the one-child policy. The authorities claim that 400 million births have 
been prevented, which contributed to increasing per capita GDP.9 But this asssertion is 
contested by claims that the higher number of prevented births includes the effects of the 
later-longer-fewer policy, and that the one-child policy has prevented closer to 200 million 
births.10 In addition, many scholars believe that rapid economic development alone would 
have reduced fertility substantially, as has been the case in many other developing countries, 
such as Thailand where the total fertility rate decreased from 5·6 in 1970, to 2·1 in 1990.11 
This possibility, together with the very rapid fall in fertility during the later-longer-fewer 
policy, raises the obvious question of whether the one-child policy was ever necessary at all.
The health outcomes of the one-child policy are also debated. Women have benefited from 
fewer pregnancies and births, which has contributed to a fall in the maternal mortality rate 
over the past three decades.12 However, this advantage has been at the cost of deprivation of 
reproductive choice, not only in family size, but also in contraceptive choice. The insertion 
of intrauterine devices post partum without formal consent was routine in rural China, with 
permission needed for removal to have a second child.13 Pregnancies that were unapproved 
under the policy (including any occurring outside marriage) have always been problematic. 
Most women undergo abortions voluntarily, but there are many accounts of forced abortions 
and sterilisations ordered by over-zealous local officials. Such atrocities peaked in the early 
years of the one-child policy, but have been rare over the past decade.8

 There have been social benefits for women, with an acceleration of movement towards 
gender equality. The traditional preference for a son led many Chinese parents to invest 
relatively little in their daughters, but in the absence of brothers, household resources could 
focus on daughters.14 Studies have found no significant differences between single-girl and 
single-boy families in relation to health outcomes and education (in terms of access, 
aspiration, or achievement), although differences have been recorded between brothers and 
sisters, with boys attending school on average 6 months longer.15,16 Women now account for 
52% of undergraduates and 48% of postgraduates.17 Low fertility has also increased the 
chances of well-paid work and career advancement for women. More than a quarter of CEOs 
of medium and large Chinese companies are women.18 This improvement in gender equality 
has contributed to improved health outcomes for young and middle-aged women.
A further controversy is the degree to which the one-child policy has contributed to the 
highly skewed sex ratio at birth. The sex ratio at birth, defined as the number of male births 
for every 100 female births, started to rise after the onset of the one-child policy, but this 
trend accelerated further after diagnostic ultrasound for sex determination became available 
from the late 1980s.19 Although sex determination is illegal in China,20 the high sex ratio at 
birth shows the lack of effective enforcement. The sex ratio at birth peaked at 121 in 2005, 
with latest estimates showing a fall to 116 in 2014, but with ratios as high as 140 in parts of 
rural central China.20,21 In rural areas, the ratio rises greatly with second births, as couples 
try to ensure a male birth within the two-child limit. By 2020, there will be around 30 
million excess, and hence unmarriageable, men of reproductive age in a country where 
getting married and having children is still a strong cultural expectation.20,22 This situation 
could have considerable mental health consequences: never-married middle-aged and older 
men have significantly higher levels of depression,23,24 they are more prone to aggression 
than married men, and may be more easily drawn into crime, leading to concerns about 
social instability.21,25,26
There is also considerable debate around the effects of the one-child policy on the wellbeing 
of children. These effects have been characterised by a stereotype of parents and 
grandparents overindulging the only-child, creating spoiled, selfish, unsociable, and obese 
so-called little emperors.27 But the evidence is mixed. For example, studies that control for 
confounders show that only children have higher academic achievement, higher self-esteem, 
and greater confidence,28–31 all of which might contribute to better health outcomes. These 
effects are partly attributed to household resources being directed towards the only child 
with overall beneficial effects on education and health.32 However, there is also evidence to 
the contrary: a series of studies in young adult soldiers have shown that soldiers with 
siblings are significantly more motivated, hard working, obedient, sociable, and mentally 
stable than are those who are only children.33–37
There is less controversy about the effects of the one-child policy on the rapidly growing 
ageing population.38 Indeed, fears about the ageing population have probably been the most 
influential factor in the decision to lift the one-child policy. Although ageing populations are 
increasing worldwide, the one-child policy has rapidly accelerated the process in China. The 
effect of large numbers of only children on family structures has its own name in China: the 
4:2:1 effect, referring to couples who are responsible for the care of their four older parents

 and one child. Despite the state-sponsored New Rural Old Age Insurance Programme, which 
started in 2009, most Chinese elderly people, especially those in rural areas, still lack full 
pension coverage, so are largely dependent on their children for financial support.7,39 
Confucian tradition still dictates that care of the elderly parents is a filial duty. China is 
perhaps unique in having laws that adult children can be compelled to provide financial 
support to their elderly parents.40 This culture places a considerable burden on 4:2:1 
families. Although sons have traditionally supported parents financially,41 daughters (and 
sons-in-law) have generally cared for their older parents.42,43 Thus, the shortage of women, 
partly caused by the one-child policy, is affecting the quantity and quality of elderly care, 
especially in rural areas. The growth in the elderly population is also putting serious 
pressures on the health system, which is not yet adapted to deal with the complex and 
expensive comorbidities of an ageing population.44
The introduction of the universal two-child policy
Demographers warned of the negative consequences of the one-child policy almost from the 
outset.45–51 Their arguments centred on the fact that the demographic dividend—ie, the 
accelerated economic growth that results from a decline in fertility and mortality—was 
reversing. Soon, the negative consequences were beginning to outweigh the positive. The 
negatives include accelerating population ageing, the skewed sex ratio, and the decline in the 
working-age population, which would threaten economic growth. Moreover, in 1980 the 
government had pledged that the one-child policy would last for just one generation, so 
change was overdue. But contrary to the views of most demographers,7,51–55 the government 
feared that lifting the policy would lead to a baby boom, so the government’s response has 
been cautious with a series of gradually introduced exemptions. By 2007, all provinces 
(except Henan, which followed in 2011) had started to permit couples who were both only-
children to have two children. In November, 2013, came a policy allowing couples in which 
at least one of the marital partners was an only-child to have two children. But by May, 
2015, only 1·45 million (13·2%) of 11 million eligible couples applied for permission to 
have a second child.56 The low uptake has been attributed to the high cost of rearing children 
in cities, because the overwhelming majority of these eligible couples were urban residents.
57 The couples who applied for a second child were younger, had higher household income, 
a young first child more likely to be girl, and parents who wanted a second grandchild.58 
This low uptake, together with appeals from scholars and the media, have probably 
accelerated the announcement of the universal two-child policy.
The potential effects of the universal two-child policy
Effects on fertility
The fertility level after the universal two-child policy is a key factor that will affect 
population growth, the proportion of elderly people, the workforce and economic 
development, the sex ratio, public health, health systems, and the environment. But the 
effects of the new policy may be less than expected. There is now clear evidence that the role 
of fertility policy is diminishing fast, and that fertility in contemporary China, as elsewhere, 
is socioeconomically determined.8,11

 Surveys of fertility preference59–61 undertaken over the past two decades show that China 
has indeed become a low fertility culture, and such surveys are generally thought to 
somewhat overestimate actual fertility.62,63 The overall consensus from these studies is that 
around 90% of women report they want one or two children, whereas in large cities nearly 
two-thirds of women state a preference for only one child. Reasons given include the high 
cost of rearing children, especially for education, and the effect on parental lifestyle and on 
the mother’s career.64–66
The challenge is that future fertility cannot be accurately forecast, because of its various 
uncertain determinants. For example, the lower fertility preference in urban areas together 
with the current drive towards urbanisation (70% urbanisation planned by 2030), is likely to 
keep fertility low. However, several scholars believe the preference for two children will 
gather momentum.67 We present here the most likely scenario of changes in Chinese fertility 
in the next few decades based on various demographic analyses. Given the lower 
socioeconomic level in rural areas, and the fact that minority ethnic groups are allowed three 
or more children, the total fertility rate is assumed to rise from the current 2·01 in rural areas 
and 1·24 in urban areas, to 2·15 and 1·67, respectively, in the next decade. The combined 
rural–urban total fertility rate is estimated to be 1·88 in 2017, and 1·81 in 2030.7
In the discussion to follow, we explore the projected effects of the universal two-child policy, 
drawing comparisons with the scenario of the one-child policy remaining in place. These 
projections are based on population projections using the assumed total fertility rates 
outlined above, and with the same background demographic parameters (such as medium 
mortality and rural–urban migration).7
Effects on population ageing
The Chinese population would age quickly under either policy scheme (figure 2). The 
percentage of over-65s under the universal two-child policy is expected to reach 18% in 
2030, with the proportion about twice as high in rural areas than in urban areas.7,68 
Population ageing is a global occurrence: today, the UK’s over-65s account for 17% of the 
total population, and Japan’s 26%.69 The rapid acceleration in the ageing population 
associated with the one-child policy has created a significant challenge for China and 
population ageing will be substantially less serious with the universal two-child policy than 
if the one-child policy remained unchanged (figure 2). There are two particularly vulnerable 
groups of elderly people in China. The first is the so-called empty-nesters (living in 
households without children), mainly caused by the large out-migration of young people 
during rapid urbanisation and job mobility.7,38 Around half of these empty-nesters live alone 
and half with a spouse.70 Their numbers will rise over the next two decades and the 
proportion in rural areas will grow to twice of that in urban areas by 2050.7 Empty-nesters, 
especially those living alone, are particularly prone to mental health problems.71 The second 
vulnerable group is disabled elderly people. The number of disabled people aged older than 
65 years is predicted to increase rapidly from 8·4 million in 2010, to 19 million in 2030, and 
37 million in 2050.72 Many of these people are in the extreme elderly age group (≥80 years) 
and their health care, personal, and social care needs present a huge challenge.

 Effects on population size, workforce, and economic development
The universal two-child policy is predicted to lead to a peak population of around 1·45 
billion in 2029 and then gradually decline (table). Under a continuing one-child policy 
scenario, the population would peak at around 1·40 billion in 2023 and then rapidly decline 
(table). The total population size under the one-child policy would be smaller than under the 
universal two-child policy (table), which would cause serious problems for ageing, pension 
fund deficiencies, and labour shortages.73,74 Under a continuing one-child policy, two-fifths 
of the reduced population size in 2030, and one-half in 2050, would be aged 18–64 years (ie, 
of working age), and the other reductions would be in children aged 0–17 (ie, the 
forthcoming workforce; figure 3).7 The workforce will not be affected by the new policy in 
the short term. It will slowly decline until 2020 and moderately decline from 2020 to 2030, 
with no difference between the two policies. But beyond 2030, increased births under the 
universal two-child policy would lead to a substantially larger workforce, by 30 million in 
2040, and 60 million in 2050, compared to the unchanged one-child policy (figure 3). A 
large working-age population has been shown to be crucial to economic growth. About 27% 
of the increase in Chinese GDP from 1982 to 2000 is estimated to be due to the large 
working-age population, which resulted from the baby boom of the 1950s and 1960s.75 
Elsewhere in Asia, plentiful labour contributed substantially to the rapid growth of GDP in 
South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in the 1970s and 1980s.76 These factors 
add strength to the positive and economic effects of the universal two-child policy.77,78
The elderly dependency ratio will increase sharply under either policy scenario. Defined as 
the number of people aged older than 65 years divided by number of working-age people 
aged 18–64 years, it is desirable that this figure remains low in any population. Only after 
2030 will the demographic benefits of the two-child policy become evident in producing a 
considerably lower elderly dependency ratio than the one-child policy (figure 4).7 Further, 
the universal two-child policy transition will result in greater consumption and job 
opportunities associated with childbearing and child-rearing, which will contribute to 
economic growth.
Effects on the sex ratio
The 2000 census data show that in areas with a 1·5-child policy, the sex ratio at birth was as 
high as 125 compared with 109 in areas with a two-child policy, which suggests that the 1·5-
child policy has specifically exacerbated China’s high sex ratio at birth.79 This policy was 
interpreted by many Chinese people as implying that one boy was sufficient to ensure family 
welfare, but one girl was not, and thus that female children had lesser value, reinforcing the 
culture of preference for sons and increasing China’s sex ratio at birth.5,80,81 Evidence of 
this effect emerged from an experimental programme in four rural areas (with a total 
population of 8 million) in four provinces. In these areas, a two-child policy operated from 
the mid-1980s. The result was substantially lower sex ratios than those in the surrounding 
rural areas where the 1·5-child policy had been implemented.82 Furthermore, slightly more 
than one-quarter of the excess sex ratio at birth in the 1·5-child policy areas is due to the 
structural effects of not allowing couples whose first child is a boy to have a second birth.5 
On this evidence, adopting the universal two-child policy will make significant contributions 
to reducing the sex ratio at birth in China, but it is unlikely to totally normalise for many

 years to come, because of the long-standing preference for sons, especially in rural areas, 
and continued access to sex-selective technologies.
Effects on population health
Replacing the one-child policy with the universal two-child policy will have positive effects 
on health for children, adults, and elderly people.
The new policy will greatly reduce or eliminate some of the most serious effects on children 
of the one-child policy. Although already uncommon, the practice of abandonment of 
unwanted girls soon after birth, with institutionalisation in orphanages and negative health 
and social consequences, should become much rarer. Similarly, so-called blacklisted, out-of-
quota children should cease to exist. These are children without household registration, 
caused by their parents’ violation of the one-child policy and their refusal or inability to pay 
the penalty. Lacking registration creates barriers to the child’s educational opportunity and 
social status, with consequent poorer mental health outcomes in many cases.83 In fact, with 
the announcement of the two-child policy, the status of existing blacklisted children is being 
normalised.84 The new policy is also likely to reduce discrimination in nutrition, education, 
and health care against girls, which persists in some rural areas.85
With respect to the health of adults, the new policy should substantially reduce the tragedy 
of many millions of abortions due to so-called out-of-quota second pregnancies. In addition, 
there will be a substantial reduction in sex-selective abortions, which presents a considerable 
health risk since they are of necessity done late, during the second trimester.86 As the sex 
ratio at birth decreases with the new policy, there will be a concomitant reduction in the 
numbers of unmarriageable men with higher rates of depression and other mental health 
problems.21,24
Perhaps the most feared family tragedy under the one-child policy was the premature death 
of an only-child. Data from the 2000 census showed that the average probability of the only-
child’s death was 4% before their mother reached age 45 years, 12% before they reached 80 
years, 16% before 85 years, and 21% before they reached 90 years.87 Permanent 
childlessness for a couple or lone parent can have potentially serious consequences for their 
mental and physical health,88 especially when many elderly Chinese people depend on 
offspring for care. Demographers have estimated that there were about 1 million 
permanently childless families because of death of the only-child in 2010, and the number 
has been increasing by about 78 000 every year.89 It is expected that this socially undesirable 
trend will substantially decline under the universal two-child policy.
Evidence from longitudinal healthy ageing surveys42,90 indicates that elderly people cared 
for by daughters (and sons-in-law) rather than sons (and daughters-in-law) have a lower 
mortality and lower probability of declining cognitive capacity. Further evidence suggests 
that older parents are more satisfied with care provided by daughters than by sons, and that 
older parents have better relationships with their daughters than sons.43 The implementation 
of the one-child policy, especially in cities, prevented almost half of all couples from having 
a daughter; the new policy will afford many more couples the opportunity of a daughter. The

 outcome will eventually be more elderly parents benefiting from the care of daughters, thus 
enhancing their mental and physical health.42,43
Effects on health systems
Although the new policy is unlikely to lead to a very large increase in the average birth rate 
for China as whole, highly heterogeneous development across the country means that 
increases in fertility may be greater in particular regions, such as in some rural areas and 
small towns. The authorities will need to monitor these changes locally, so that increased 
capacity in health services, especially maternal and child health services, can be planned as 
necessary.
A major concern is the acute shortage of paediatricians and paediatric nurses across the 
country, which has worsened over the past decade.91 Lower incomes, highly pressured 
working conditions, and demanding parents all contribute to the unpopularity of paediatrics 
as a specialty.92 So any increase in birth rate resulting from the two-child policy will 
exacerbate pressures on an already stressed system. A study93 based on birth rate predictions 
until 2020 estimated that around 190 000 more paediatricians are needed. Although overall 
numbers of personnel in maternal and child health services are sufficient, there are concerns 
for the quality of these services.92 Quality could deteriorate if pressure on these services 
increases with the birth rate.
Effects on natural resources and environment
In the past few decades, growth in the Chinese population has been widely assumed to 
threaten natural resources and the environment. However, evidence suggests that this is 
unlikely to occur as a consequence of the universal two-child policy. First, the overall 
increase in population will be modest, with a peak of approximately 3% higher total 
population than would occur under the one-child policy. Second, it is true that in 2011, water 
and land resources per person in China were reduced by 30% and 36%, respectively, 
compared with 1979, attributable to population growth. But the declines levelled off after 
2000. Under the universal two-child policy, the Chinese average water resource per person 
and average arable land per person would reach the lowest value around 2029 (reduced by 
about 2% and 6%, respectively, compared with 2011), and then start to gradually increase as 
the total population size decreases after 2029.7
The other effects
The new policy will allow almost all couples to meet their reproductive preference.59,60 No 
longer will couples face the consequences of penalties and stress associated with having an 
unapproved second child. A divisiveness was created by the one-child policy, with different 
rules applying to neighbours and friends, as well as resentment towards the wealthy who 
were able to afford the penalties for having two children. These negative effects are expected 
to be totally eliminated. Further, the new policy will greatly reduce the corruption associated 
with the enforcement of the one-child policy. This corruption included bribing of officials 
for permission for more than one child, and the often unregulated collection of fines from 
birth control violators.51 All of these outcomes will help to create a more harmonious 
society, an attribute highly regarded by the Chinese Government and the people.

 Policy implications and recommendations
Population ageing
The universal two-child policy was introduced principally to address the serious challenges 
of population ageing, one of the greatest challenges for China in the 21st century. However, 
in the next 20 years the universal two-child policy will have only a marginal effect on the 
rapid acceleration in population ageing if no other adequate policy actions are taken. 
Compared with some industrialised countries, where room is very limited for increasing 
fertility, raising retirement age, and expanding pension programmes in rural areas, China has 
three unique opportunities to address the challenge of rapid population ageing. First, the 
universal two-child policy will substantially increase fertility in some localities, especially in 
rural areas and small towns. Second, the exceptionally low compulsory retirement age can 
be raised. The retirement age in China, 55 years for women and 60 years for men, is among 
the lowest in the world. Increasing the retirement age improves physical and mental health 
outcomes.94 It prolongs pension contributions, improving the financial stability of the 
pension system,95 while increasing post-retirement payments. It will also ameliorate the 
predicted labour shortage, seen as a consequence of 36 years of the one-child policy, while 
also buying the time needed for the benefits of the universal two-child policy to be fully 
realised. Third, state-sponsored pension systems must be strengthened, especially in rural 
areas, where rapid ageing will be a greater problem in the coming decades, due to continuing 
rural–urban migration of young people.7 These new rural old age insurance programmes will 
not only enhance senior citizens’ welfare, but also create a huge amount of capital by 
collecting premiums from hundreds of millions of new programme participants. This 
increased capital will contribute to further economic development. Greater financial 
independence for the elderly will also reduce reliance on sons, resulting in a more 
enlightened attitude towards the relative value of sons and daughters.
In addition to these three fundamental policy actions, the authorities should improve 
awareness and actively encourage change in a number of areas. Three-generation living 
arrangements (either co-residence or close proximity) should be encouraged. Such 
arrangements are perhaps especially appropriate in China, given the long and deep-rooted 
tradition of filial piety to old people.96 Older parents who live with their adult children have 
better cognitive function, self-rated health, and life satisfaction.97 Since grandparents 
traditionally assume childcare responsibilities, such arrangements increase the workforce 
participation of female adult children, with consequent financial and health benefits.98 They 
also decrease home-based care expenditures for disabled elderly.99 A policy encouraging 
three-generation living was very successful in Singapore.100 In particular support for rural 
elderly people to go to live with, or near, city-dwelling children should be a priority.
Further, the benefits of daughters rather than sons for old age care42,43 should be widely 
publicised. Older parents should be encouraged to live with (or nearby) an adult daughter 
and son-in-law, even if they have both son and daughter. This strategy would gradually 
change the tradition of daughters marrying-out of their own families, would be beneficial for 
older adults, and also help to reduce the preference for sons, with obvious effects on the sex 
ratio at birth.

 Finally, although the sex ratio at birth will decline with the beneficial effects of a more 
balanced sex ratio in the reproductive years, especially in rural areas, these effects can only 
be gradual. In the meantime, the needs of ageing single men, as an especially vulnerable 
group, will require recognition in policy. Overall, if sound policy actions are taken promptly 
and effectively, China should be able to successfully address the challenges of an ageing 
population.
Health systems
The shortfall in health personnel, especially in paediatrics, requires short-term and long-term 
solutions. In the short term, much of the work currently done by paediatricians in acute 
hospitals is primary care in nature, and could be provided by maternal and child health 
doctors in community health centres. Such personnel would need to undergo enhanced 
short-term training in paediatrics, to upgrade their skills and thus improve service quality. In 
the longer term, measures should be taken to make paediatrics more attractive as a specialty, 
for example through bonus systems, improved working conditions, and incentives (linked to 
lower copayments) for parents to use primary care services and thus reduce the huge 
pressures on specialist paediatric services.
In addition, the opportunity to harness and redeploy the huge family planning workforce 
seems obvious. There are more than 5 million administrative bureaucrats and fieldworkers.6 
There will be considerable spare capacity under the universal two-child policy, because the 
bureaucratic infrastructure for birth approvals and punishments for out-of-quota second 
births will no longer be required. Training and redeployment of the current family planning 
workforce in elderly care and healthy ageing social work would seem an obvious solution to 
address the challenges of the continued growth of an ageing population while providing 
productive jobs for these workers.
Conclusion
Since the onset of the one-child policy massive socioeconomic change in China has led to a 
low fertility culture. The two-child policy will therefore not result in a baby boom, but rather 
a moderate increase in fertility. But the many negative effects of the one-child policy will 
disappear and nearly all Chinese people will have their desired family size. The next step, 
the total removal of the fertility control policy, needs to be considered sooner rather than 
later.
In short, in the coming decades the universal two-child policy will help to address the 
challenge of population ageing, reduce the sex ratio at birth, remove the more oppressive 
elements of the one-child policy, contribute to economic growth, and allow the 
overwhelming majority of couples to have the number of children they want. The birth rate 
must be monitored locally, so that improved capacity in maternal and child health services 
can be planned as necessary. We believe that the introduction of the universal two-child 
policy was a necessary and highly desirable action that will be beneficial for all sectors of 
Chinese society.
