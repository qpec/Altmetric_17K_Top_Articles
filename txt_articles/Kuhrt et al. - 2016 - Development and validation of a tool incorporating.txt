ABSTRACT
Objective To develop a predictive tool for spontaneous
preterm birth (sPTB) in asymptomatic high-risk women
that includes quantification of fetal fibronectin (fFN)
along with cervical length (CL) measurement and other
clinical factors.
Methods Data were analyzed that had been collected
prospectively from 1249 women at high risk for sPTB
attending preterm surveillance clinics. Clinicians were
blinded to quantitative measurements of fFN (qfFN),
although they were aware of qualitative fFN results.
Parametric survival models for sPTB, with time-updated
covariates, were developed and the best was selected using
the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. The model
was developed on the first 624 consecutive women and
validated on the subsequent 625. Fractional polynomials
were used to accommodate possible non-linear effects of
qfFN and CL. The estimated probability of delivery before
30, 34 or 37 weeks’ gestation and within 2 or 4 weeks
of testing was calculated for each patient and analyzed as
a predictive test for the actual occurrence of each event.
Predictive statistics were calculated to compare training
and validation sets.
Results The
final
model
that
was
selected
used
a
log-normal survival curve with CL, √qfFN and previous
sPTB/preterm prelabor rupture of membranes as predic-
tors. Predictive statistics were similar for training and
validation sets. Areas under the receiver–operating char-
acteristics curves ranged from 0.77 to 0.99, indicating
accurate prediction across all five delivery outcomes.
Conclusions sPTB in high-risk asymptomatic women
can be predicted accurately using a model combining
qfFN and CL, which supersedes the single-threshold fFN

INTRODUCTION
Every year 15 million babies are born prematurely
worldwide (before 37 weeks’ completed gestation)1, and
1.1 million die from associated complications2. Survivors
face greater risk of serious health problems2. Neonatal
intensive care and ongoing medical and educational
support is expensive – $26 billion annually in the USA3
and, despite advances in prenatal care, the rate of preterm
birth has not declined2.
Prediction of preterm birth in women at risk should
allow targeted intervention. Both cerclage and proges-
terone have shown promise in reducing spontaneous
preterm birth (sPTB) in asymptomatic women, partic-
ularly in those with a short cervix4–7. More recently
fetal fibronectin (fFN) and cervical length (CL) assess-
ment have superseded previous risk assessments, not
only in women with symptoms of preterm birth, but in
asymptomatic women in whom prophylactic preventative
therapies can be attempted8,9. Cervicovaginal fluid (CVF)
quantitative fFN (qfFN) concentration measurement adds
value over the qualitative test in both symptomatic and
high-risk asymptomatic women10–12, and is now avail-
able as a simple point-of-care test that can be carried out in
10 min.
We evaluated prospectively clinical risk factors, qfFN
and CL measurements taken from high-risk women
attending a preterm surveillance clinic to create an optimal
risk algorithm. This was then validated on a separate
dataset of high-risk women.

METHODS
This was a prospective secondary analysis of a population
of women enrolled in the ongoing Evaluation of Fetal
Fibronectin with a Quantitative Instrument for the
Prediction of Preterm Birth (EQUIPP) study involving
1249 consecutive asymptomatic women deemed to be at
high risk of sPTB, defined as one or more of the following:
previous sPTB or previous preterm prelabor rupture of
membranes (PPROM) < 37 weeks’ gestation, previous
late miscarriage (16 + 0 to 23 + 6 weeks’ gestation),
previous cervical surgery or CL measuring < 25 mm in
the current pregnancy.
Asymptomatic women attending high-risk preterm
surveillance clinics were offered longitudinal fFN testing
using a novel quantitative rapid fFN analyzer (Hologic,
Marlborough, MA, USA) every 2–4 weeks in addition
to routine transvaginal ultrasound CL measurement. All
high-risk women between 22 + 0 and 30 + 0 weeks’ ges-
tation asymptomatic of threatened sPTB were considered.
From this group, exclusions were performed sequentially
to provide a more uniform population for comparative
analysis. Women with a blood-stained swab or sexual
intercourse within the last 24 h were excluded from the
study due to known interference with fFN measurement13.
Women with multiple pregnancy, those without CL mea-
surement, or those with insufficient or absent qfFN
sample, incomplete outcome data or offspring from the
current pregnancy with a congenital abnormality were
also excluded.
Participants were recruited from five high-risk antenatal
clinics in the UK between 5 October 2010 and July
2014. The study was approved by South East London
Research Ethics Committee, and the local research ethics
committees of all participating centers. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants. Gestational
age was confirmed with standard early ultrasound scans
in each case.
The fFN sample was obtained prior to CL measurement,
because cervical manipulation may in itself cause release
of fFN, during a sterile speculum examination in which
a polyester swab was used to collect cervicovaginal
secretions from the posterior fornix of the vagina. One
aliquot (200 μL) of the sample contained in a buffer
solution was analyzed with the conventional qualitative
fFN TLiIQ
analyzer (Hologic) and another aliquot
(200 μL) of the same sample using the quantitative Rapid
fFN 10Q analyzer (Hologic). Clinicians trained in the use
of both fFN analyzers ran the two tests concurrently.
Clinicians were made aware of the Categoric TLiIQ
result (positive/negative), but both patient and clinician
remained blinded to 10Q results until after delivery (a
random result code was generated by the analyzer).
Participants’ demographic characteristics, risk factors
and obstetric and gynecological history were entered into a
secure online database (www.medscinet.net/PTBstudies).
Three CL measurements were taken at each visit using
transvaginal ultrasonography and the minimum CL
was used.

Women were managed in the clinic as per unit pro-
tocols. History-indicated cerclage was performed when a
woman had experienced three or more late miscarriages
or previous sPTB < 34 weeks and ultrasound-indicated
cerclage was performed if a short cervix was detected
on ultrasound (n = 140; training set = 79; validation
set = 61). Progesterone (or placebo) was used only as part
of an ongoing double-blinded randomized controlled trial
(n = 63; training set = 41; validation set = 22; i.e. half of
these received 200 mg of vaginal progesterone daily from
22–34 weeks’ gestation).
Any model performs optimally on the dataset that has
been used to generate that model. In order to provide a
true assessment of the usefulness of the model it should be
validated on another dataset from a similar population. To
this end the study population was split to form a training
set, consisting of 624 women with 1245 visits, which was
used to develop the model, and a validation set, which
included 625 women with 1243 visits. A predictive model
was run using the validation set to assess the performance
of the algorithm.

sion. All test results from all women were included in

Model generation
Survival analysis with time-updated covariates was used
to identify the principal predictors of premature delivery
with premature onset of labor or PPROM. For each set
of results, women were considered at risk of an event
only from the time of the visit to the earliest of their
next test, delivery or 37 weeks’ gestation. Deliveries after
37 weeks’ gestation or preceded by induction of labor
or elective Cesarean section were regarded as censored.
fFN, CL, gestational age at test and previous preterm
delivery/PPROM were considered as possible predictors.
We performed an initial analysis in which other predictive
variables including body mass index, smoking, ethnicity,
previous cervical surgery and previous late miscarriage
were excluded as not significant.
Six parametric survival models were compared for
each combination of predictors: exponential, Gompertz,
log-logistic, Weibull, log-normal and gamma. The best
survival function was determined by having the lowest
values of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria
(AIC and BIC)14,15. A log-normal survival function with
terms for qfFN, CL and previous sPTB/PPROM was
selected, using time of conception as time zero, however
women were observed only from time of test. The
continuous measures qfFN and CL were then investigated
for non-linearity using fractional polynomials16 and a
series of qfFN cutpoints at standard values: 10, 20, 50,
100, 200 and 500 ng/mL.
Model validation
The estimated probability of delivery before five clinically
important points in time (30, 34, 37 weeks of pregnancy
and within 2 and 4 weeks of testing) was calculated for
each patient and were analyzed as a predictive test for
the actual occurrence of each event. Receiver–operating
characteristics (ROC) curves were drawn, and areas under
the curve (AUC) calculated.
The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm was
investigated using a probability above 10% as indicating
a positive test. This value was chosen as being practically
useful for separating low-risk women (probability around
5%) from high-risk women (probability around 20%) for
the purpose of clinical management.
RESULTS
After exclusions, as illustrated in Figure 1, the final
high-risk population studied consisted of 1249 women
and, including longitudinal sampling, 2488 fFN measure-
ments were recorded. This final group was split into a
training set, consisting of 624 women with 1245 visits,
and a validation set of 625 women and 1243 visits. The
mean gestational age of visit was 23.4 weeks in both sets
of women.
The rate of sPTB was 15%, 8%, 4%, 1% and 2%
for delivery at < 37, < 34 and < 30 weeks’ gestation and
within 2 and 4 weeks of test, respectively, in both the
training and validation sets.
The proportion of women in each fFN concentration
category and CL values were similar between training and
validation sets (Table 1). The demographic characteristics
of the two sets were comparable (Table 2). In the
total study population, 143 (11%) women received
ultrasound-indicated cerclage as per preterm surveillance
clinic management protocols and 63 were part of an
ongoing randomized controlled trial in which half of the

women were in the treatment arm and received 200 mg of
vaginal progesterone daily from 22 to 34 weeks’ gestation.
Model generation (using the training set only)
Of the predictors considered, qfFN, CL and previous
sPTB/PPROM were significant in the stepwise model at
P < 0.01. The best parametric survival model (determined
by AIC and BIC) was a log-normal survival function
with terms for qfFN, CL and previous sPTB or PPROM
(Appendix S1). The best fractional polynomial model was
linear in CL and the square root of fFN concentration,
outperforming those using cutpoints. These findings were
confirmed by consistent improvement in AIC and BIC.
Therefore the final model included linear CL, the square
root of fFN concentration and previous sPTB/PPROM as
predictors.
Model validation
Table 3 summarizes predictive statistics calculated using
an estimated probability > 10% as indicating a positive
test, to allow comparison of training and validation sets
for prediction of delivery at each of the five clinically
important points in time: < 30, < 34 and < 37 weeks’
gestation and delivery within 2 or 4 weeks of qfFN testing.
Overall, predictive statistics including sensitivity, speci-
ficity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR–) likelihood ratios
were similar for training and validation sets across all five
time points considered. Furthermore the prediction of
sPTB using the prediction model was good. The negative
predictive value was > 90% for all five time points, which
means that < 10% of women with a negative test would
deliver preterm. This is clearly in line with the defini-
tion of a negative test (calculated probability < 10%),
and confirms that the calculated probabilities behaved as
intended. The LR+ and LR– were all much greater than
1 or less than 1, respectively, which indicates that positive
test results were strongly associated with sPTB and neg-
ative tests results with its absence17. LR+ values in the
validation set were highest for delivery at < 30 weeks and
within 2 and 4 weeks of test at 5.7 (95% CI, 3.6–8.9),
33.3 (95% CI, 15.5–71.6) and 15.0 (95% CI, 8.4–27.0),
respectively, meaning that women with a positive test were
approximately 6, 33 and 15 times more likely to deliver
before these three time points than women without a
positive test.
The ROC curves in Figure 2 are an indication of overall
test performance regardless of fFN threshold. The AUC
values, ranging from 0.77 to 0.99 in the validation set,
indicate that the model accurately predicts sPTB across
all five delivery time points investigated.

validation set. The ROC curves are an indication of overall
test performance regardless of qfFN or CL threshold.
Evaluation of previous models has been constrained by
limiting prediction into categories above and below a
threshold. This model will give the optimal prediction
throughout the range of values, and therefore can be more
appropriately applied to an individual. The AUCs show
that overall prediction for the model is extremely good
with values ranging from 0.77 to 0.99 in the validation set.
This represents a marked improvement on ROC curves in
previously published literature for fFN testing to predict
sPTB at < 34 and < 37 weeks in asymptomatic women in
which AUC values of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.59–0.63) and 0.65
(95% CI, 0.63–0.66), respectively, were reported18.
It
has
been
shown
consistently
that
additional
useful information is provided when fFN results are
quantified10–12,19. In addition combined qfFN testing
and CL measurement has been shown to lead to improved
prediction of sPTB20. This could explain the improved
AUCs observed for the new predictive model, which incor-
porates information obtained from the measurement of
qfFN and CL compared to qfFN testing alone. Combining
CL and qfFN is likely to be best, and this is consistent with
our data and probably supersedes any other variables.
The superiority of combined qfFN and CL measurement
as predictors of preterm birth was further implied by
stepwise regression in which all proposed variables, except
for qfFN, CL and previous sPTB/PPROM, were rejected
as non-significant. However, the list of variables was not
exhaustive and there may be others that affect prediction
of sPTB. For example, there is evidence to suggest that
having a cervical cerclage in situ may affect the fFN
result. Duhig et al. showed that for delivery at < 30 weeks
the specificity of fFN testing was significantly lower in
asymptomatic high-risk women with cervical cerclage
compared with those without (77 vs 90%; P < 0.00001),
and this was attributed to an increase in the number
of false-positive results21. Further work is required to
establish whether cervical cerclage and other variables
could be included in the model to improve its performance.
Currently, with 17% of the women in this cohort receiving
cerclage, the model is good and can be used.
The fact that the data were derived from a rigorously,
prospectively collected dataset (used for the EQUIPP
study), the largest of its kind, is a strength of this
study, which is the first to develop a model including
quantifiable fFN for the creation of an algorithm
to predict sPTB in asymptomatic high-risk women.
Furthermore, the parametric method used to generate
the model, combined with appropriate censoring, makes
full use of the available data, without introducing
biases. As a result the sPTB rate in this study, which is
similar to that reported in recent studies analyzing qfFN
in asymptomatic women9,11,12, is likely to be a good
representation of sPTB in asymptomatic high-risk women
in the general population. This further suggests that the
model generated in this study will be relevant beyond this
study population and an accurate predictive tool.
A potential limitation of the study is that predictive
statistics were based on results derived from women
managed in preterm surveillance clinics as per protocols,
which included interventions such as ultrasound-indicated
cerclage (11%) and progesterone (5%) as part of
OPPTIMUM, an ongoing randomized controlled trial.

 Predicting preterm birth
109
The predictive model remains good even under these
circumstances,
i.e.
women
both
with
and
without
intervention can rely on it to predict outcome. As
interventions are not only to prolong gestation, e.g. the use
of steroids and magnesium sulphate to improve neonatal
morbidity, the information remains potentially valuable.
Further work needs to ascertain if interventions improve
outcome when targeted to women identified with the
algorithm, but some interventions may be withheld in
women deemed to be high risk because of their medical
history, but determined to be low risk by the algorithm.
Determining risk without these interventions would be
unethical, and the algorithm remains pragmatic and
valuable for this reason.
Further work has been done to update the model for
use in symptomatic as well as asymptomatic women.
Ultimately, the algorithm will be made widely available to
clinicians through an application (QUiPP) accessed from
a smart phone or via the internet. It performs significantly
better than does any previous predictive tool.
