 Noninvasive Detection of Cocaine and Heroin Use
with Single Fingerprints:
Determination of an Environmental Cutoff
Mahado Ismail,1* Derek Stevenson,1 Catia Costa,2 Roger Webb,2 Marcel de Puit,3,4 and Melanie Bailey1
BACKGROUND: Recent publications have explored the
possibility of using fingerprints to confirm drug use, but
none has yet dealt with environmental contamination
from fingertips. Here we explored the possibility of es-
tablishing an environmental cutoff for drug testing from
a single fingerprint.
METHODS: Fingerprint samples (n � 100) were collected
from the hands of 50 nondrug users before and after
handwashing to establish separate environmental cutoff
values and testing protocols for cocaine, benzoylecgonine,
heroin, and 6-monoacetylmorphine. The cutoff was chal-
lenged by testing the fingerprints of drug-free volunteers
after shaking hands with drug users. Fingerprints from pa-
tients who testified to taking cocaine (n � 32) and heroin
(n � 24) were also collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: A different cutoff value needed to be applied,
depending on whether the fingerprints were collected as
presented or after handwashing. Applying these cutoffs gave
a 0% false-positive rate from the drug-free volunteers. After
application of the cutoff, the detection rate (compared to
patient testimony) for washed hands of patients was 87.5%
for cocaine use and 100% for heroin use.
CONCLUSIONS: Fingerprints show enhanced levels of co-
caine, heroin, and their respective metabolites in patients
who testified to taking the substances, compared with the
population of naı
¨ve drug users surveyed, and a cutoff
(decision level) can be established. The cutoff is robust
enough to account for small increases in analyte observed
after secondary transfer.

The possibility of drug testing from a fingerprint has
become the subject of many recent research articles, due
to the ease and noninvasive nature of sample collection,
as well as the fact that the donor’s identity is embedded
within the ridge detail of the fingerprint itself (1, 2). This
provides, in prospect, the possibility of rapidly and non-
invasively carrying out drug testing in a way that is diffi-
cult to falsify. Several methods have been proposed for
detection of drugs in fingerprints, mostly focused on con-
tact residues or standards (3–9). A few reports have dealt
with excreted drug metabolites (10–12) by use of direct
or surface mass spectrometry approaches. While these
approaches are attractive from the point of view of a fast
turnaround (in some cases �2 min per sample), their
quantitative capabilities are still limited. In contrast,
LC-MS is the technique of choice among toxicologists
for drug testing in other matrices owing to its superior
selectivity and quantitative power, afforded by the chro-
matographic separation of analytes before mass spectro-
metric analysis (13–15). Analysis of fingerprint drug
residues by LC-MS has been demonstrated previously
(16–18). The limitation of LC-MS for fingerprint resi-
due analysis is that the fingerprint must first be extracted
from the deposition substrate, which reduces sample
throughput compared with direct mass spectrometry
methods. Nonetheless, attempts have been made to ex-
plore the detection window of both lorazepam and caf-
feine in fingerprints (16, 17) and to relate the fingerprint
level of caffeine to a blood or oral fluid sample (19).
Despite the interest in testing for drugs from a fin-
gerprint, to our knowledge, no studies have explored the
robustness of fingerprint testing itself. Cocaine is an es-
pecially common environmental contaminant (20), and
this deserves attention before fingerprints could be con-
sidered a credible testing matrix. In hair analysis, cutoff
levels (21, 22) are used to ensure that environmental ex-
posure can be eliminated as a possible source, but this has
never been considered for a fingerprint test, probably
because fingerprint testing is far less mature.
Here we report on a new LC-MS protocol that de-
termines the relative mass of heroin, cocaine, and the

 respective metabolites, 6-monoacetylmorphine and ben-
zoylecgonine, in fingerprint samples. Benzoylecgonine
rather than ecgonine methyl ester was monitored owing
to its longer half-life in urine and for compatibility with
current drug testing regimes (23, 24). The method has
been applied to the fingerprints (n � 99) from 50 indi-
viduals who testified to be nondrug users to establish an
environmental cutoff value. The fingerprint samples of
13 cocaine users and 12 heroin users were then measured
against these cutoffs to determine drug use over the en-
vironmental level. The cutoff was challenged by testing
nondrug users after shaking hands with drug users.
Materials and Methods
SAMPLE COLLECTION
A favorable ethical opinion for collection and analysis of
samples was received from the National Research Ethics
Service (NRES-REC reference: 14/LO/0346).
Fingerprints were collected on 2- � 2-cm squares of
Whatman 1-Chr-grade chromatography paper, with a
single fingerprint collected per sample. Kitchen scales
(Sainsbury’s Color) were used to measure the pressure ap-
plied during collection (800–1200 g for 10 s). Fingerprint
samples from the right thumb and right index finger were
collected(a)aspresentedand(b)afterhandwashingfrom50
participants who testified not to be drug users.
Fingerprints were collected from individuals seeking
treatment at drug rehabilitation clinics who testified to
taking either cocaine (n � 13) or heroin (n � 12) in the
past 24 h. A fingerprint from each finger of the right hand
(n � 5) was collected as described above. To investigate
different sampling strategies, 8 of the participants were
instructed to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and
water followed by wearing nitrile gloves for 10 min to
induce sweating, followed by removal of the gloves and
finally depositing fingerprint samples.
Corresponding oral fluid samples were collected
with a QuantisalTM (AlereTM) collection device. Oral
fluid samples were analyzed at Claritest. Claritest screen-
ing uses immunoassay testing followed by LC-MS/MS
quantification if screening is positive.
To test the possibility of secondary transfer of parent
drug or metabolites, fingerprints (n � 5, right hand) were
collected from drug-free volunteers. Hands were shaken
with a drug user for approximately 2 s. Fingerprints (n �
5, right hand) were then collected from the drug-free
volunteers after contact with the drug user.
MATERIALS
Drug standards (cocaine, benzoylecgonine, heroin,
6-monoacetylmorphine, cocaine-d3, benzoylecgonine-d3,
heroin-d9, and 6-monoacetylmorphine-d3) were prepared
from certified reference materials (Cerilliant). Optima
LC-MS grade solvents [methanol, dichloromethane, ace-
tonitrile (ACN),5 and water] were used to prepare all
solutions and solvent mixtures (Fischer Scientific). For-
mic acid (Fischer Scientific) was added to the mobile
phase at 0.1% v/v. Artificial eccrine perspiration was pur-
chased from Pickering Laboratories.
SAMPLE EXTRACTION AND PREPARATION
The paper samples were placed in a 2-mL Eppendorf
microcentrifuge tube, following which the extraction
solution (1.5 mL of 10% dichloromethane in metha-
nol) was added. The tube was then centrifuged for 2
min (at 9500g centrifugal force). The paper was re-
moved from the microcentrifuge tube and discarded.
The solvent extract was evaporated to dryness under a
stream of nitrogen at room temperature (20 °C) and
reconstituted in 100-�L mobile phase solution [50
ng/mL cocaine-d3, benzoylecgonine-d3, heroin-d9,
and 6-monoacetylmorphine-d3 in 5% (v/v) ACN in
water � 0.1% formic acid] before being vortex-mixed
and transferred to a 300-�L glass microinsert vial,
with 5 �L being injected onto the LC-MS/MS system.
Chromatographic separation was performed on a
Thermo Scientific™ Ultimate3000 UHPLC system
equipped with a binary solvent manager, column man-
ager, and autosampler. Separation was performed on a
Kinetex XB-C18 column (100 � 2.1 mm, 5 �m) oper-
ated at 30 °C at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. Gradient
analysis was performed with an initial mobile phase com-
prising 95% water (0.1% formic acid) and 5% ACN
(0.1% formic acid) increased to 80% ACN (0.1% formic
acid) and 20% water (0.1% formic acid) over 2 min and
kept constant for 0.5 min before returning to the initial
mobile phase composition (see Table 1 in the Data Sup-
plement that accompanies the online version of this arti-
cle at http://www.clinchem.org/content/vol64/issue6).
The samples were introduced to a Thermo Orbitrap
Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer by the standard elec-
trospray ionization interface with a capillary temperature
of 320 °C and spray voltage of 3 kV (see Table 2 in the
online Data Supplement). Positive mass spectra were ac-
quired in full scan mode within a range of m/z 50–500 at
a mass resolution of 70000 at m/z 200.
METHOD VALIDATION
Extracted ion chromatograms for m/z 304.15 (assigned
to cocaine), m/z 290.14 (assigned to benzoylecgonine),
m/z 370.16 (assigned to heroin), and m/z 328.15 (as-
signed to 6-monoacetylmorphine) for supplemented
(10 �L at 600 ng/mL) samples extracted from chromatog-
raphy paper are shown in Fig. 1 in the online Data Supple-

ternal standard.

 ment. Peak assignment was confirmed by verifying that the
corresponding m/z peak was within 5 ppm of the expected
value and by MS/MS fragmentation. The run time for each
sample was 3 min, and the retention times for cocaine, ben-
zoylecgonine, heroin, and 6-monoacetylmorphine were
2.12, 2.00, 1.85, and 2.06 min, respectively.
A linear calibration curve of added drugs in ACN
was prepared with a working range of 500 pg/sample to
10 ng/sample. Each calibrator was prepared from a stock
solution containing cocaine, benzoylecgonine, heroin,
and 6-monoacetylmorphine in ACN at 5000 ng/mL.
The stock solution was prepared from the certified refer-
ence material of the individual analyte at 1 g/L. Calibra-
tors then were prepared at 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800,
and 1000 ng/mL in ACN by dilution of the stock solu-
tion. Ten microliters of the calibrator were added to the
sample substrate (Whatman 1-Chr-grade chromatogra-
phy paper, 2 � 2 cm) and allowed to dry overnight in the
fume hood before being extracted and analyzed as de-
tailed above. Each calibrator was reinjected 5 times. The
mean peak area of the 5 repeated measurements was used
to calculate the ratio analyte/internal standard (A/IS) and
is shown in Fig. 2 in the online Data Supplement. The R2
value was �0.9995 for all analytes, and the precision was
greater than �1% (n � 25).
To determine limits of detection, 10 �L of solutions
of the drug standard at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 ng/mL was
pipetted onto paper substrates (2 � 2 cm) and allowed to
dry in the fume hood. The subsequent sample was then
extracted by using the developed extraction and analysis
procedure. The limit of detection was determined as the
mass of standard below which the analyte signal was no
longer observed. The limits of detection, (provided in
Table 3 in the online Data Supplement) were 10, 30, 40,
and 40 pg for cocaine, benzoylecgonine, heroin, and
6-monoacetylmorphine, respectively.
MATRIX EFFECTS
To test the matrix effects, samples were prepared as fol-
lows: 10 �L of supplemented drug standard (500 ng/mL)
was deposited on a paper substrate in (a) ACN, (b) arti-
ficial eccrine sweat, (c) ACN after deposition of a finger-
print from each of 4 participants after washing hands
with soap, and (d) ACN after deposition of a fingerprint
from each of 4 participants after wiping hands. In each
case, extraction was performed as described earlier. Four
replicate samples for each of the above sample were pre-
pared and 5 injections of each were performed.
Results and Discussion
MATRIX EFFECTS
Fig. 3 in the online Data Supplement shows the ratio
A/IS obtained in each sample type, described in the pre-
vious section. For cocaine and benzoylecgonine, no sub-
stantial difference was observed between the standards in
the presence of ACN only and the standards in the pres-
ence of a fingerprint, and therefore no matrix effects were
observed. For heroin and 6-monoacetylmorphine, how-
ever, the presence of a fingerprint increased the ratio A/IS
by 29% and 17%, respectively, showing that the matrix
effects needed to be considered for absolute measure-
ments (i.e., mass per fingerprint). However, the close
distribution of values (�5% variability) between the 4
participants studied here implied that there was no donor-
dependent matrix effect. Additionally, given the small num-
ber of participants studied for matrix effects, a more thor-
ough evaluation of participant dependence and fingerprint
aging on matrix effects should be completed in the future.
The presence of artificial eccrine sweat increased the ratio
A/IS by a factor of 3, showing that this standard was not
representative of a fingerprint matrix. Therefore, in the ab-
sence of a validated standard, we took a previously used
approach (16, 18, 19) and opted to not use a matrix-
matched calibration curve. Subsequent results are therefore
stated in terms of A/IS rather than ng/fingerprint.
COCAINE AND BENZOYLECGONINE DETECTION IN
FINGERPRINTS FROM THE BACKGROUND POPULATION
Fingerprint samples (right thumb and right index) were
taken from 50 participants who testified not to be drug
users. These were extracted and analyzed with the
LC-MS method described earlier. Fig. 1 displays the ratio
A/IS peak areas (5 replicate injections) corresponding to
cocaine and benzoylecgonine. The limit of detection of
the method (dashed line) shows detection of cocaine in
13 out of the 99 fingerprint samples and that of benzo-
ylecgonine in 5 of the 99 fingerprint samples analyzed
using this method. Note that for 1 sample, the LC-MS
run failed—SUB016 (right index finger). There was
clearly a requirement to impose an environmental cutoff
on the data, particularly in the case of cocaine, as the
method readily detected cocaine even in the fingerprints
of nondrug users. We propose an A/IS cutoff of 0.026 for
cocaine and 0.018 for benzoylecgonine on the basis of a
99% confidence limit calculated from the background
samples, as indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 1.
COCAINE AND BENZOYLECGONINE DETECTION IN
FINGERPRINTS FROM INDIVIDUALS SEEKING TREATMENT FOR
DRUG DEPENDENCY
Fingerprint samples (all fingers of the right hand) were
taken from 13 participants who testified to taking co-
caine in the past 24 h. These samples were extracted and
analyzed with the same LC-MS method. Fig. 4 in the
online Data Supplement shows the ratio A/IS (5 replicate
injections) corresponding to cocaine and benzoylecgo-
nine for all 5 fingerprint samples collected. The data
show the considerable variability between the fingerprint
samples collected from the same participant, which could

 be expected owing to various factors that include the
difference in surface area of the different fingers. Fig. 2
displays the same data, but for the same 2 fingers (right
thumb and right index) as those presented for the back-
ground study. There was, in general, good agreement
with patient testimony and the detection of cocaine and
benzoylecgonine, with these compounds being detected
above the cutoff in 100% and 85% of the fingerprint
samples, respectively. There are of course obvious limita-
tions of patient testimony—the patient may not have
known what they were taking, may have forgotten when
they had taken a substance, or deliberately falsified their
information. This could be the case for participant 4,
who tested negative in oral fluid and benzoylecgonine in
the fingerprint samples. Benzoylecgonine was detected
above the proposed cutoff only in 1 out of 2 fingerprints
for participants 3 and 5, despite a positive oral fluid test
result and cocaine detection in both fingerprints. This
therefore shows an inevitable limitation of imposing an
environmental cutoff, as benzoylecgonine was above the
limit of detection in both fingerprints.
Table 4 in the online Data Supplement compares
the oral fluid testing results to the fingerprint test results
(based on the presence of a signal above the environmen-
tal cutoff). For participants 1 and 13, both cocaine and
benzoylecgonine were detected at levels considerably greater

 than the environmental cutoff, despite the negative oral
fluid test result. Sweat has a longer detection window than
oral fluid (25), and therefore, we provide this as an explana-
tion for the discrepancy in fingerprint and oral fluid results
observed here. This is consistent with previous observations
with paper spray mass spectrometry (12).
The model was challenged by the collection of fin-
gerprints from 5 nondrug users working at the clinic
before and then directly after shaking hands with 5 dif-
ferent drug users (Fig. 3). The levels of cocaine exceed the
proposed cutoff for SUB002 (right thumb), SUB054
(right thumb), and SUB055 (right thumb and right in-

 dex) after shaking hands (Fig. 3). Benzoylecgonine was
never observed to exceed the cutoff. This is important
given that cocaine can chemically convert to benzo-
ylecgonine (26, 27). This was even true after shaking
hands with participant 7, who also had the highest levels
of drug present in their fingerprints (Fig. 2). Therefore, if
the testing regime requires benzoylecgonine to be present
in a fingerprint sample for a positive test result, the test is
robust enough that secondary transfer presented here
would return a negative result. This would result in a
reduced detection rate (of 85%), but no false positives,
from the data presented here.
EFFECTS OF HANDWASHING ON THE DETECTION OF
COCAINE AND BENZOYLECGONINE
The results showed good agreement with patient testi-
mony for cocaine use but have so far only considered
unwashed hands. Discrimination of contact residue from
excreted drugs and metabolites would be essential for any
quantitative test. Also, any test from a fingerprint must be
robust enough to have a good detection rate even if an
individual has washed their hands before being tested,
otherwise the test would be easily falsified. Therefore, 8
patients who testified to taking cocaine were asked to
wash their hands with soap and water after initial depo-
sition of fingerprints. The signals corresponding to co-
caine and benzoylecgonine are plotted in Fig. 5 in the
online Data Supplement. Cocaine was present in all fin-
gerprints even after handwashing (Table 1), and benzo-
ylecgonine was present in all but in the fingerprints of
participant 4, consistent with the data for unwashed
hands for this participant. It is noteworthy that for par-
ticipant 1, whose oral fluid tested negative, both benzo-
ylecgonine and cocaine were still detected in the finger-
prints, even after handwashing. Imposing the same
environmental cutoff conditions as for the unwashed
hands on these data is of course not appropriate here,
because the background population had not washed their
hands. Therefore, a cutoff based on the fingerprints of the
background population after handwashing was imposed.
The limit of detection was used here as the cutoff, be-
cause cocaine and benzoylecgonine were detected in only
1 out of 100 and 0 out of 100 fingerprint samples, re-
spectively. The detection rate was therefore 87.5% and
the false-positive rate was 0%, based on the detection of
benzoylecgonine.
HEROIN AND 6-MONOACETYLMORPHINE DETECTION FROM
FINGERPRINTS
Fingerprint samples (right thumb and right index) were
taken from 50 participants who testified to not being drug
users and extracted and analyzed by the same LC-MS
method described in previous sections. No signals corre-
sponding to heroin were observed in any sample, and a
signal above the limit of detection (0.007 compared with
0.003)wasobservedfor6-monoacetylmorphineinonly1of
the 99 fingerprints tested.
As detailed in the previous section, fingerprint sam-
ples (all fingers of the right hand) were taken from 12
participants who testified to taking heroin in the past
24 h. These samples were extracted and analyzed by the
LC-MS method described in the previous sections. Fig. 6
in the online Data Supplement shows the ratio A/IS for
peak areas (5 replicate injections per sample) correspond-
ing to heroin and 6-monoacetylmorphine for all 5 fin-
gerprint samples collected. The data again show the
considerable variability between the fingerprint samples
collected from the same participant. It is perhaps surpris-
ing to see the parent drug together with the metabolite in
the fingerprint samples, as heroin is quickly metabolized
by the body (28). It is possible that the detection of
heroin and its metabolite in these fingerprint samples

 therefore arose from a combination of drug contact and
excretionofmetabolites,asthefingerprintsweretakenwith-
out handwashing before deposition. Fig. 4 displays the same
data, but for the 2 fingers (right thumb and right index)
corresponding to those used for the background study.
Here, there was excellent agreement with patient testimony,
with heroin and 6-monoacetylmorphine detected at levels
above the limit of detection for all samples.
Table 5 in the online Data Supplement compares
the oral fluid test results to the fingerprint testing results.
The fingerprints of participants 1, 2, 3, and 8 tested
positive for both heroin and 6-monoacetylmorphine at
levels considerably greater than the background popula-
tion, despite negative oral fluid test results for these par-
ticipants. This can be explained by either a longer detec-
tion window for heroin in sweat than in oral fluid or the
prevalence of contact residue on the patients, as finger-
prints were deposited without handwashing.
To investigate the potential for contact residue and
secondary transfer, fingerprints from researchers working
at a clinic session were taken before and directly after
shaking hands with 3 different heroin users (participants
6–8). The level of heroin observed exceeded the limit
of detection in only 1 case after working at the clinic
and after contact with a drug user (see Fig. 7 in the
online Data Supplement). It is therefore likely that

 the heroin present in the fingerprints collected from
the patient population would have come from a source
other than contact with other users or surfaces within
the clinic.
EFFECTS OF HANDWASHING ON THE DETECTION OF HEROIN
AND 6-MONOACETYLMORPHINE
The eight patients who testified to taking heroin were
asked to wash their hands with soap and water after initial
deposition of fingerprints. The signals corresponding to
heroin and 6-monoacetylmorphine are plotted in Fig. 8
in the online Data Supplement. 6-Monoacetylmophine
was present in all fingerprints, and heroin was present in
all fingerprints except those from participant 3, even after
handwashing, as shown in Table 2. Therefore, a testing
protocol that requires 6-monoacetylmorphine to be pres-
ent in a fingerprint sample for a positive test would give a
100% detection rate with 0% false positives.
In summary, we have developed an LC-MS method
for testing both cocaine and heroin use from a single
fingerprint. Testing from a fingerprint is rapid and af-
fords the opportunity for biometric identification di-
rectly from the sample, ensuring traceability. Although
this is not explored here, the development of a fingerprint
ridge detail before mass spectrometry analysis has been
demonstrated (12) and could in theory be applied to
fingerprint testing with the method presented here.
This is, we believe, the first study to explore the
significance of testing for drugs from a fingerprint, and
therefore, the first effort dedicated to establishing an en-
vironmental cutoff. By testing the fingerprints from 50
nondrug users, and fingerprints from nondrug users after
shaking hands with patients, we have constructed and
tested an environmental cutoff for cocaine and heroin use
from a fingerprint. The cutoff used here cannot be ap-
plied universally but it serves to illustrate the distinction
between the fingerprints of drug users and nondrug users
of cocaine and heroin.
