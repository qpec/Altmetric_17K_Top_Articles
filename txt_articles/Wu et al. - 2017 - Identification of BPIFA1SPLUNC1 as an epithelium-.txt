Asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and
abnormal airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction. Bacterial permeability family member
A1, BPIFA1, is a secreted innate defence protein. Here we show that BPIFA1 levels are reduced
in sputum samples from asthmatic patients and that BPIFA1 is secreted basolaterally from
healthy, but not asthmatic human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs), where it suppresses
ASM contractility by binding to and inhibiting the Ca2 þ influx channel Orai1. We have
localized this effect to a specific, C-terminal a-helical region of BPIFA1. Furthermore, tracheas
from Bpifa1 � / � mice are hypercontractile, and this phenotype is reversed by the addition of
recombinant BPIFA1. Our data suggest that BPIFA1 deficiency in asthmatic airways promotes
Orai1 hyperactivity, increased ASM contraction and airway hyperresponsiveness. Strategies
that target Orai1 or the BPIFA1 deficiency in asthma may lead to novel therapies to treat this
disease.

 A
sthma affects B334 million people worldwide, yet little
is known regarding the underlying aetiology of the
exaggerated airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction
that leads to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). More recently,
research has focused on the role of airway epithelia in
driving
asthma.
In
ASM,
the
degree
of
contraction
is
directly proportional to the cytosolic Ca2 þ levels1,2. As such,
ASM Ca2 þ homeostasis is tightly regulated and often involves
store-operated Ca2 þ entry (SOCE), a process whereby stromal
interacting
molecule
1
(STIM1)
relocates/aggregates
at
the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-plasma membrane junction
where it activates Orai1 to allow Ca2 þ
influx, leading to
contraction3,4.
SOCE
is
defective
in
ASM
from
asthma
patients and in murine asthma models, which show increased
Orai1 activity5,6. For over 30 years, researchers have predicted
that an epithelium-derived smooth muscle relaxing factor
(EDSMRF)
exists
in
normal
subjects
where
it
regulates
ASM Ca2 þ levels, and that EDSMRF is deranged in asthmatics,
leading to an exaggerated Ca2 þ response to agonists such
as methacholine (Mch). The existence of an EDSMRF was
first proposed when researchers demonstrated that trachea
denuded of epithelia induced AHR and that placing epithelia
from
another
animal
in
the
same
organ
bath
reduced
contractility7. Candidate molecules for EDSMRF have included
NO,
arachidonic
acid
metabolites,
and
cytokines,
but
all
have been ultimately rejected since they do not meet the
necessary criteria of (i) being secreted directly into the media
and (ii) being modulated by inflammatory mediators8. Bacterial
permeability family member A1 (BPIFA1), also known as
short palate and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1), secreted
protein from the upper respiratory tract, LUNg-specific protein-X
and nasopharyngeal carcinoma-related protein, is a multi-
functional protein that is secreted by airway epithelia and
has both antimicrobial activity and regulates ion channels9.
BPIFA1 production has previously been shown to be inhibited
by Th2-type cytokines that are upregulated in asthma, such as
IL-13, and in allergic mouse models, suggesting that it plays a role
in the allergic response to allergens10. However, its effects on
ASM have not previously been described. We observed that
BPIFA1 protein levels were diminished in sputa from asthma
patients. Surprisingly, we found that BPIFA1 was secreted
basolaterally from normal human bronchial epithelial cultures
(HBECs)
and
that
basolateral
BPIFA1
secretions
were
significantly reduced in asthma-derived HBECs. On the basis
of these data, we tested the hypothesis that BPIFA1 was
the EDSMRF.
In support of this hypothesis, we found that serosal media
from normal but not asthmatic HBECs lowered cytosolic
ASM Ca2 þ levels and prevented ASM contractions. We also
found that Bpifa1-deficient (Bpifa1 � / �) mice exhibited sponta-
neous AHR and that excised tracheas from Bpifa1 þ / þ but
not Bpifa1 � / � mice were capable of reducing ASM contraction.
Furthermore,
recombinant
BPIFA1
blocked
Ca2 þ
influx
and bound specifically to the plasma membrane Ca2 þ channel
Orai1, leading to Orai1 internalization. Thus, we propose
that BPIFA1 (SPLUNC1) is the EDSMRF and it functions
by internalizing Orai1.
Results
BPIFA1 levels inversely correlate with asthma and AHR.
To investigate the role of BPIFA1 in asthma pathogenesis,
we measured sputum BPIFA1 levels in healthy donors, asthmatic
patients,
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
patients
and atopic individuals without asthma, the latter two cohorts
serving as disease controls. Immunoblot analyses indicated
significantly decreased BPIFA1 protein levels in asthmatic
patients’ samples compared with the other donors (Fig. 1a,b,
Supplementary Table 1). To determine whether a decrease
in BPIFA1 levels was associated with abnormal ASM activity,
we
next
tested
whether
Bpifa1 � / �
mice
exhibit
AHR.
These mice showed a significant increase in airway resistance
following Mch challenge compared with their Bpifa1 þ / þ litter-
mate controls (Fig. 1c), indicating an inverse correlation between
Bpifa1 expression and ASM contraction. Haematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining and quantification of smooth muscle
mass of tracheas from these mice showed no obvious difference in
ASM morphology between Bpifa1 þ / þ and Bpifa1 � / � animals
(Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting that the increase
in airway resistance in Bpifa1 � / �
mice was not due to
ASM hypertrophy. To further study the effect of Bpifa1 on
ASM, we excised tracheas from these mice and mounted
them on wire myographs to measure contractility ex vivo.
Tracheal rings from Bpifa1 � / � mice showed significant hyper-
contractility
compared
with
wild-type
controls
following
exposure to acetylcholine (Ach) or KCl (Fig. 1e). Since this effect
was seen with both Ach, which stimulates Muscarinic/Ach
receptors and KCl, which depolarizes the plasma membrane to
induce Ca2 þ influx11,12, we concluded that this effect was
not due to abnormal receptor function. Furthermore, pretrea-
tment with recombinant BPIFA1 protein at a physiologically
relevant dose13 (10 mM) for 1 h suppressed contraction (Fig. 1f),
suggesting that BPIFA1 is an EDSMRF.
BPIFA1
regulates
ASM
contraction
in
vitro.
Due
to
the potential importance of this observation, we further investi-
gated the ASM–BPIFA1 interaction in ASM cells (ASMCs)
cultured in collagen matrices. We observed that ASMC contrac-
tion was significantly reduced in the presence of Bpifa1 þ / þ
tracheas with intact epithelium. In contrast, denuded tracheas
from both genotypes and whole Bpifa1 � / � tracheas showed
no inhibitory effect on ASMC contraction (Fig. 2a,b). Similarly,
pre-incubation with recombinant BPIFA1 for 1 h reduced ASMC
contraction
(Fig.
2c,d),
suggesting
that
epithelium-derived
BPIFA1
is
responsible
for
modulating
ASM
contractility.
In ASMC, contraction is regulated by cross-bridge formation
between
phosphorylated
myosin
light
chain
(MLC)
and
actin. Ach enhances MLC phosphorylation in a Ca2 þ-dependent
manner and therefore enhances contraction14. MLC phos-
phorylation was increased by Ach, whereas pre-treatment with
BPIFA1 decreased both basal and induced MLC phosphorylation
(Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Fig. 2).
BPIFA1 levels are reduced in asthma-derived HBECs. We next
measured BPIFA1 protein levels in primary HBECs derived
from healthy and asthmatic donors. Consistent with our data
from the sputum samples (Fig. 1a,b), immunoblot analyses
revealed significantly decreased levels of BPIFA1 in lysates,
basolateral media and apical lavage of HBECs derived from
asthma patients compared with non-asthmatic controls (Fig. 3a
and Supplementary Table 2). Normal HBECs exposed to the
asthma-associated T-helper 2 cell (Th2) cytokine IL-13 showed
similar decreases in BPIFA1 levels (Fig. 3b). Consistent with the
previous studies10, we also detected a decrease in BPIFA1 mRNA
after IL-13 exposure (Supplementary Fig. 3). On the basis of these
data, we hypothesize that diminution of BPIFA1 in asthmatic
tissue may be closely associated with the Th-2 response. Of note,
exposure
to the b2-adrenergic
agonist albuterol enhanced
BPIFA1 secretion in both basal media and apical lavage
of normal HBECs without affecting overall BPIFA1 mRNA and
protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 4).

 BPIFA1 inhibits store-operated Ca2 þ entry in ASM. Since
BPIFA1 downregulated MLC phosphorylation, we next investi-
gated whether BPIFA1 regulated ASMC Ca2 þ signalling. When
ASMCs were exposed to serosal media from healthy HBECs,
or to recombinant BPIFA1, the thapsigargin (TG)-induced
Ca2 þ increase was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent
manner
(Fig.
3c,d
and
Supplementary
Fig.
5a–c).
After
TG exposure, Ca2 þ enters the cytoplasm from multiple sources
including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the extracellular
milieu15. In the absence of extracellular Ca2 þ, TG triggered
ER Ca2 þ release and only moderately raised cytoplasmic Ca2 þ,
whereas reintroduction of Ca2 þ extracellular Ca2 þ induced
SOCE
and
further
elevated
cytosolic
Ca2 þ
(Fig.
3e).
Pre-treatment with BPIFA1 had no effect on ER Ca2 þ release,
but significantly suppressed SOCE (Fig. 3e and Supplementary
Fig. 5d). Since SOCE supports intracellular Ca2 þ oscillations16,
we also examined the role of BPIFA1 in regulating this
phenomenon. Pre-treatment with BPIFA1 for 1 h significantly
attenuated Mch-induced Ca2 þ oscillations (Fig. 3f,g), indicating
that BPIFA1 inhibits the Ca2 þ entry required for oscillations.
To map out the structural region within BPIFA1 that
was responsible for these effects, we used a series of BPIFA1
mutants/peptides
and
tested
their
ability
to
suppress
Ca2 þ
signalling.

 ENaC-independent. BPIFA1 lacking its N-terminal S18 region
(D44BPIFA1) or deletion of alpha helix 4 (Da4BPIFA1) still
inhibited Ca2 þ signalling. However, deletion of alpha helix
6 (Da6BPIFA1) significantly abolished its ability to inhibit
Ca2 þ
signalling (Fig. 3h), indicating that the C-terminal
a6 helix is required to inhibit SOCE.

Since

these proteins interact. BPIFA1 and Orai1, but not an alternate
Ca2 þ channel (transient receptor potential cation channel 3,
TRPC3), could be co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4a and Supple-
mentary

 (Fig.

To
verify
that
Orai1
was
BPIFA1’s
target,
we knocked down endogenous ORAI1 in ASMCs by shRNA,
as
confirmed
by
both
qPCR
(Fig.
4f)
and
immuno-
blot (Supplementary Figs 7a and 8a). ORAI1 knockdown
decreased
BPIFA1
binding
to
ASMC
plasma
membranes
(Supplementary Fig. 7) and the ability of BPIFA1 to inhibit
Ca2 þ influx and ASMC contrition in vitro were also lost
(Fig. 4g,h, Supplementary Figs 9 and 10). Additionally, phos-
phorylation
of
myosin
light
chain
phosphatase
(MYPT1)
at threonine 583, which was reportedly induced by Ach in
mice tracheas21, was downregulated by BPIFA1 (Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 8). Taken together, our data suggest that BPIFA1
binds
to
and
inhibits
Orai1
to
block
Ca2 þ
influx
in
ASMC, resulting in a decrease in MLC phosphorylation and
ASM contractility.
Discussion
Our
previous
studies,
and
those
conducted
elsewhere,
have focused on BPIFA1’s secretion into the lung lumen18,22,23.
For example, BPIFA1 negatively regulates Na þ absorption across
airway epithelia by binding extracellularly to b-ENaC18,24.
We note that BPIFA1’s S18 region, which inhibits ENaC,
is located N-terminally12, while the a6 helix, which antago-
nizes Orai1, lies close to BPIFA1’s C terminus. Thus, these
domains are in distinct regions of BPIFA1, which may support

 their differing functions. Chu and colleagues demonstrated that
Bpifa1 � / �
mice
have
a
more
severe
phenotype
than
WT mice when sensitized by ovalbumin, including eosino-
philic inflammation25. These authors hypothesized that apically
secreted
BPIFA1
normally
‘mopped
up’
excess
bacterial
lipopolysaccharide and that after allergen exposure, reduced
BPIFA1
levels
increased
lipopolysaccharide,
leading
to
an
exaggerated allergen response. However, they did not factor
basolaterally secreted BPIFA1 into their model. It is likely
therefore, that the ovalbumin-induced decrease in BPIFA1
levels also
contributed
to
AHR via
the dysregulation
of
BPIFA1–Orai1 interactions. We found that BPIFA1 levels were
significantly diminished in sputum derived from asthma patients
(Fig.
1a,b)
and
that
a
similar
decrease
in
BPIFA1
levels was observed in apical secretions from both asthmatic
and IL-13-exposed HBECs (Fig. 3a,b). Perhaps surprisingly, we
demonstrated that BPIFA1 was also basolaterally secreted
from airway epithelia, and that basolateral BPIFA1 secretions
were
greatly
diminished
in
asthmatic
and
IL-13
exposed
HBECs (Fig. 2a,b). Mirroring these decreases, we found that
asthma
and
IL-13
downregulated
BPIFA1
mRNA
and intracellular protein levels (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary
Fig 3). Why asthmatic HBECs continued to display reduced
BPIFA1 levels remains to be determined. They may have
a ‘memory’ of the host inflammation and/or exhibit as yet
unknown genetic variations that predispose them to reduced
BPIFA1 levels.
BPIFA1 binds extracellularly to Orai1, leading to Orai1’s
internalization,
inhibition
of
SOCE
and
a
decrease
in
ASM contraction (Figs 2 and 4), a process that is deranged in
asthmatic airways (Figs 1 and 3). Consistent with these data,
we have also discovered a hitherto unnoticed phenotype of
the
Bpifa1 � / �
mice,
that
is,
they
exhibit
spontaneous
AHR that is reversed in excised tracheas by the addition
of recombinant BPIFA1 (Fig. 1c–f). The inhibitory effect
of BPIFA1 on ASM contraction also requires an intact of
airway epithelia. Indeed, denuding tracheas from Bpifa1 þ / þ
mice abolished their ability to suppress ASM contraction
in vitro, an effect that was absent from whole or denuded
Bpifa1 � / � tracheas (Fig. 2a,b). Taken together, these data
strongly suggest that BPIFA1 is indeed an EDSMRF. BPIFA1
is expressed in epithelia of the trachea and bronchi, but
not the alveoli26,27, suggesting that is able to function as an
EDSMRF in the conducting airways. However, whether other
EDSMRFs exist remains to be determined.
We
focused
on
basolaterally
secreted
BPIFA1’s
ability
to regulate ASM. However, the lack of apically secreted
BPIFA1 may also have consequences for airway epithelia.
Indeed, mucus is dehydrated in asthmatic airways28 and
since a lack of BPIFA1 is also predicted to increase ENaC
activity, this may indicate that mucus dehydration in asthma
patients is in part driven by BPIFA1 deficiency and abnormal
ENaC-led transepithelial Na þ and water absorption. In addition,
since mucus secretion from goblet cells is Ca2 þ-dependent29,
increased SOCE in the absence of BPIFA1 may also contribute
to the mucus hypersecretion phenotype seen in asthma patients.
For example, our data predict that in BPIFA1’s absence, the
purinergic stimulation of goblet cells would result in a greater
cytosolic
Ca2 þ
response
and
increased
mucin
secretion.
BPIFA1 notwithstanding, Th2-driven goblet cell metaplasia
helps
drive
the
mucus
hypersecretion
component30.
The
transcription factors SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS-like
factor
(SPDEF)
and
forkhead
ortholog
A3
(FOXA3)
are
abnormally
regulated
in
asthma
leading
to
goblet
cell
metaplasia31,32. Whether SPDEF/FOXA3 activity is involved in
reducing BPIFA1 expression in asthmatic patients remains to be
determined. b2-agonists, which are a common asthma treatment,
can increase BPIFA1 expression33, whereas our data suggest
that
the
short-term
b2-agonist
albuterol
only
enhances
BPIFA1
secretion
(Supplementary
Fig.
4).
Therefore,
a
better understanding of how BPIFA1 expression is modulated
by different categories of b-agonists and other mainstream
therapies including glucocorticoids in asthma-derived airway
epithelia is needed to develop novel, targeted therapies for
treating asthma.
Although our study focused on the diminished expression
of BPIFA1 and its target Orai1 in ASM, it is worth noting
that other research groups have demonstrated the dysregulation
of other plasma membrane proteins. For instance, calcium-
sensing receptor (CaSR) is upregulated in asthmatic ASM leading
to AHR and inflammation34. CD38 is also elevated in asthmatic
ASM and influences Ca2 þ homeostasis/ASM contractility35.
It is unclear whether BPIFA1 interacts with these proteins.
However, replacing BPIFA1 may normalize Ca2 þ homeostasis
and reduce AHR irrespective of CaSR and CD38 activity.
Perhaps surprisingly, we found that BPIFA1 also abrogated
KCl-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2 þ and ASM contractions
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 9). We also observed that
Orai1 is involved in the KCl response and indeed, we find
that
knockdown
of
Orai1
reduces
KCl-induced
increases
in cytosolic Ca2 þ (Supplementary Fig. 9). While these data
are unconventional, it has been previously been demonstrated
that elevations in extracellular KCl trigger ATP release36,37. This
is not entirely surprising since many factors (including but not
limited
to
mechanical
and
osmotic
stress
also
induce
ATP release). Furthermore, the ATP release channel PANX1
is also stimulated by extracellular K þ (ref. 38). Thus, while
further experimentation will be required, we propose that
KCl-induced ATP release stimulates purinergic receptors to
actives SOCE/Orai1.
Beyond asthma, altered BPIFA1 expression is associated with
several types of cancer including nasopharyngeal carcinoma39
and salivary gland cancers40. Changes in Orai1 are also
associated
with
increased
cancer
metastasis41.
Thus,
we
speculate that altered BPIFA1 expression may contribute to
abnormal
Orai1-dependent
cell
growth,
although
further
mechanistic studies will be required to confirm or refute this
link. In conclusion, our findings that BPIFA1 is secreted
basolaterally, where it acts as an EDSMRF to modulate SOCE
and
ASM
contraction,
are
fundamentally
novel
advances
in understanding asthma pathogenesis that provide a direct
link
between
epithelial
dysfunction
and
AHR,
and
for
future treatments for asthma.
Methods
Human sputum sample collection. All studies were approved by the
UNC Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from
all subjects. Demographic information is included in Supplementary Table 1.
Sputum induction was performed as previously published42,43, either by
spontaneous expectoration or via sputum induction for different protocols.
Spontaneous expectoration was performed as follows: subjects were informed
not to deliver saliva or nasal secretions into the specimen cup labelled ‘sample’,
but rather if present, they were expectorated into the specimen cup labelled ‘waste’.
Before any attempt to deliver a spontaneous sputum sample, all subjects underwent
a three-step cleansing routine as follows: (1) rinse the mouth and gently gargle with
water and expectorate the contents into the ‘waste’ cup; (2) scrape and clear the
back of the throat and expectorate the contents into the ‘waste’ cup; (3) blow the
nose. Following these three cleansing steps, coughing attempts from the chest
(and not the throat) were attempted. Subjects were instructed not to scrape the
back of the throat while coughing up sputum from the chest. All sputum specimens
were delivered into the specimen cup marked ‘sample’. The cough attempts
were repeated until no further sputum was being expectorated from the chest.
The spontaneous sputum sample was kept on ice (4 �C) during the entire
spontaneous sputum procedure. The induced sputum procedure was administered
as follows: following the acquisition of a baseline FEV1, a 10 and 20% fall from this

7
 baseline FEV1 value was calculated and recorded. Subjects then were administered
successive increasing concentrations of saline (3, 4 and 5%) using a Devilbiss
UltraNeb 99 ultrasonic nebulizer (Sunrise Medical) where the nebulizer flow
rate and aerosol generation rate were adjusted to each subject’s tolerance level
to allow inhalation without discomfort. Each saline inhalation period lasted
7 min and subjects inhaled saline at tidal volume. Subjects were instructed to
not swallow saliva or saline during the inhalation periods but rather expectorate
it into the ‘waste’ cup if there was a need. At the end of each 7 min inhalation
period, subjects underwent the three-step cleansing procedure followed by
chesty (not throat) cough attempts as described above for spontaneous
sputum expectoration. When no further sample could be expectorated, as
typically indicated by a dry sounding cough, FEV1 was assessed. If the fall in
FEV1 was o10% from the pre-procedure baseline FEV1, the next highest dose of
saline was administered and the next 7 min inhalation period commenced. If the
fall in FEV1 was 410% but o20%, the same saline concentration was
administered for the next 7 min inhalation period. If the fall in FEV1 was 20% or
greater, the sputum induction procedure was terminated and not restarted and
the patient was given rescue therapy as needed. The collected sputum sample
after each 7 min inhalation period was pooled into one specimen cup and kept
on ice (4 �C) during the entire induction procedure. All three saline inhalation
periods were performed unless the FEV1 fell by 20% or greater, or a subject
wished to terminate the procedure early. All subjects’ FEV1 had to return to
within 5% of baseline before discharge.
Animals and measurement of airway resistance. Animals were cared for
according to the guidelines, and all procedures were approved by UNC Animal
Care and Use Committee. Bpifa1 � / � knockout and Bpifa1 þ / þ littermate control
mice were kind gifts from Dr Paul B. McCray Jr at University of Iowa, and were
bred and housed in a vivarium at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Airway resistance was measured in anaesthetized 8-week-old male mice similar
to previously described44. Basal resistance measurements were made every
10 s for 1 min before serially challenging mice with aerosolized methacholine
(Mch) at the following concentrations: 10 mg and 20 mg ml � 1. Mice were
administered each concentration of Mch for 10 s before recording, using a
flexiVent (SCIREQ) at 12.5 s intervals for 2.5 min immediately following each
challenge period.
DNA constructs. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged human ORAI1 and
Myc-tagged TRPC3 were gifts from Dr Craig Montell (Addgene plasmid # 25902)
and Dr Anjana Rao (Addgene plasmid # 19756), respectively. HA-tagged human
ORAI1 was a generous gift from Dr Patrick G. Hogan at La Jolla Institute for
Allergy & Immunology. pcDNA3.1( þ )-V5-BPIFA1 was generously provided
by Dr Colin D. Bingle at the University of Sheffield.
Cell culture and transfection. Human ASMCs were generous gift from
Dr Raymond B. Penn at Thomas Jefferson University. Rat ASMCs were kindly
provided by Dr Mohamed Trebak at Pennsylvania State University. ASMCs
were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture
F-12 (DMEM/F12; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Sigma Aldrich) and 0.1% penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher).
HEK293T cells (catalogue number: CRL-3216) were purchased from ATCC and
maintained in DMEM (Thermo Fisher) in the presence of 10% FBS and
0.1% penicillin–streptomycin. HBECs were obtained from freshly excised
bronchial specimens derived from normal and asthmatic subjects and were
harvested as previously described under protocol #03-1396 approved by the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Biomedical Institutional Review
Board45. Informed consent was obtained from all donors or authorized
representatives of the donors. Briefly, HBECs were extracted from excess
surgical pathology or autopsy specimens procured through cooperating surgeons
and pathologists using protocols in accordance with relevant regulations. Airways
were dissected by removing all excess connective tissue and cutting into
5–10 cm segments. Specimens were dissociated over 4–24 h, depending on the size
of the tissue, in a 15 ml tube containing 9 ml tissue wash medium (Joklik Minimum
Essential Medium oJMEM4 supplemented gentamicin o50 mg ml � 14 and
amphotericin o0.25 mg ml � 14) plus 1 ml protease solution (1% Protease
XIV with 0.01% DNase o10 � stock4, Sigma Aldrich). HBECs were then
cultured at an air–liquid interface in a modified bronchial epithelial growth
medium with 5% CO2 at 37 �C and were used 3–4 weeks after the seeding on
12 mm T-clear inserts (Corning). Demographic information for healthy and
asthmatic donors is included in Supplementary Table 2. Short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) plasmid against ORAI1 and scrambled control shRNA plasmid were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Transfections of all plasmid DNA and shRNA
were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Fisher) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Rabbit anti-Orai1 (1:1,000),
anti-HA epitope (1:2,000) and anti-myc epitope (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz), anti-GFP
(1:1,000), anti-phospho-myosin light chain (S19) (1:1,000), anti-total myosin light
chain (1:1,000), anti-phospho-myosin light chain phosphatase (T853) (1:1,000),
anti-phospho-myosin light chain phosphatase (T696) (1:1,000), anti-total
myosin light chain (1:1,000), anti-total-myosin light chain phosphatase (1:1,000),
anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1:3,000) (Cell Signaling
Technology); mouse anti-V5 epitope (1:2,000, Thermo Fisher); goat anti-BPIFA1
(1:2,000, R&D Systems); peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H þ L),
peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H þ L), peroxidase-conjugated
donkey anti-goat IgG (H þ L) (all 1:3000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were
purchased from commercial sources. To detect protein expression in total cell
lysates, cells were lysed in Pierce IP lysis buffer with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, supplemented with
1 � proteinase inhibitor cocktail (PIC) (Roche), followed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide electrophoresis and immunoblot. For immunopre-
cipitation, cell lysates were collected at 48 h post transfection in Pierce IP lysis
buffer in the presence of 1 � PIC. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein
A/G agarose beads and then incubated 1 mg of antibodies against HA or
V5 with protein A/G agarose beads on a rotator at 4 �C overnight. After three
washes with IP lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted in
sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% (v/v)
b-mercaptoethanol (BME), 0.1% bromophenol blue) by heating the samples
at 95 �C for 5 min, electrophoresed through SDS–polyacrylamide gels, and
subjected to immunoblot analysis. All the uncropped scans are provided in
Supplementary Fig. 11.
Calcium imaging. Calcium imaging using fura-2 was adapted from a previously
published protocol with minor modifications46. Briefly, ASMCs were loaded
with 2 mM fura-2-AM (Thermo Fisher) and 24 h old serosal media from
HBECs or media containing recombinant BPIFA1 at 37 �C for 1 h. ASMCs were
then washed with a standard Ringer’s solution (101 mM NaCl, 12 mM NaHCO3,
1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM KCl, 24 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH
7.4) or with Ca2 þ-free Ringer’s solution as indicated. Cultures were then placed
in the Ringer’s solution, and images were collected with a 40 � 1.4 NA Plan Fluor
oil objective on a Nikon Ti-S inverted microscope. Fura-2 fluorescence was
acquired alternately at 340 and 380 nm (emission 4450 nm) using LUDL filter
wheels, obtained with an Orca FLASH 4.0 CMOS camera (Hammamatsu) and
controlled with HCImageLive software (Hammamatsu). Cell bodies were identified
as individual regions of interest (ROIs). Background subtraction was performed
using a cell-free region as the background region. Signals were converted
to relative changes (F/F0) where F0 was the ratio of the average fluorescent
intensity (340/380) of ROIs at 0 time point. Typically, 20 cells per coverslip
were recorded. DF/F0 represents average peak fluorescent intensity changes
of three independent experiments.
Myography of murine tracheal rings. Tracheas were excised from 8 weeks
old male Bpifa1 þ / þ and Bpifa1 � / � mice. After removing excessive connective
tissue, the trachea was cut into B4 mm rings, mounted on a DMT 620M
myography apparatus (DMT) and allowed to rest in modified Ringer’s solution
(119 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.17 mM MgSO4, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2,
25 mM NaHCO3, 0.027 mM EDTA, 5.5 mM glucose) with continuous oxygenation
(95% O2/5% CO2) at 37 �C for 20 min with no applied tension. Optimal passive
tension (1 mN) was then applied to the rings. After stable tension was achieved,
the baseline force was then recorded. The induced contractile force of each ring
was assessed by measuring contraction stimulated by 60 mM KCl or 100 mM
Ach (unless indicated otherwise), respectively. Rings were bilaterally exposed to
recombinant BPIFA1 or vehicle control for 1 h before Ach/KCl addition.
Cell contraction assay. The cell contraction assay was performed using
a standard commercially available kit (Cell Biolabs). Human ASMCs were
harvested and re-suspended in DMEM, two parts of cells were mixed with eight
parts of collagen gel lattice mixture and plated for 1 h at 37 �C. After the gel
solidified, 1 ml of medium was added and incubated for 48 h. Next, the gels were
released from the sides of wells, and the images were taken using a ChemiDoc
MP imager (Bio-Rad) at 0 and 1 h after adding indicated reagents. The changes of
collagen gel surface areas were analysed using ImageJ software and normalized to
the gel’s area at t ¼ 0 min.
Protein purification and fluorescent labelling. cDNA of full length and
truncated BPIFA1 was transformed in BL21-Codon Plus competent cells
(Agilent Technologies), and purified as previously described24. S18 peptide was
synthesized and purified by the UNC Microprotein Sequencing and Peptide
Synthesis Facility, as described previously17. Fluorescent labelling was done
using DyLight 594 or DyLight 633 NHS ester (Thermo Fisher) by following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Surface labelling and super resolution microscopy. Human ASMCs were grown
on 22 mm2 glass coverslips and transfected with HA-ORAI1 DNA. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
PBS, followed by surface labelling with mouse anti-HA antibody (BioLegend)
and Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (Thermo Fisher) at 4 �C. After washing

 5 � with ice-cold PBS, cells were incubated with 5 mM BPIFA1-DyLight 594 for
1 h at 4 �C before imaging. Before mounting, 90 ml b-Mercaptoethylamine (MEA)
was added to the cavity of a depression slide to deplete oxygen. Coverslips were
sealed with twinsil (Picodent). Super-resolution images were captured with a
commercial Leica GSD super-resolution microscope using a 160 � 1.43 NA
objective. GSD was performed by exciting the fluorophore with 488 and 642 nm
solid-state lasers. In some cases, to facilitate exit from the ground state, back
pumping was applied using the 405 nm laser as per the manufacturer’s instruction.
Fluorescent BPIFA1 binding assay. Human ASMCs were transfected with
scrambled (control) shRNA or ORAI1 shRNA, respectively. Seventy-two hours
post transfection, cells were treated with or without BPIFA1-DyLight 633 for 1 h,
then washed 5 � with ice-cold Ringer’s solution. ASMC-bounded BPIFA1-Dylight
633 was detected using a Leica TCS SP8 63 � 1.4 NA oil immersion objective
using the Leica Application Suite X software (Leica). In addition, fluorescent
intensity of ASMC-bounded BPIFA1-Dylight 633 was detected by a fluorescent
plate reader (Infinite M1000, Tecan). Cells were also stained with calcein
AM (Thermo Fisher) as a cell number control. Relative fluorescent intensity was
calculated by normalizing fluorescent intensity at 658–526 nm.
Surface biotinylation. Human ASMCs were treated with or without BPIFA1 for
4 h. Cells were then washed with prechilled PBS þ þ (phosphate-buffered saline
supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2), and then labelled with
0.5 mg ml � 1 sulfo-NHS-biotin (Thermo Fisher) in borate buffer (85 mM NaCl,
4 mM KCl, 15 mM Na2B4O7, pH 9.0) while tumbling gently for 30 min on ice.
ASMCs were incubated in PBS þ þ buffer supplemented with 10% FBS for
20 min at 4 �C to quench free biotin. Cells were washed again three times with
chilled PBS þ þ and proteins were extracted as previously described using lysis
buffer (0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 50 mM EGTA, 10 mM Tris-Cl,
pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 � PIC. Total inputs were taken from whole-cell
samples representing 4% of total protein. Solubilized proteins were incubated with
100 ml of neutravidin beads (Thermo Fisher) overnight while rotating at 4 �C.
Samples were washed three times with lysis buffer. Bead-bound proteins were
then eluted and subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Statistical analysis. All data are presented as the mean±s.e.m. for n experiments.
Differences between means were tested for statistical significance using paired
or unpaired t-tests or their non-parametric equivalent as appropriate to the
experiment. Differences between groups were judged using analysis of variance.
From such comparisons, differences yielding Pr0.05 were judged to be significant.
GraphPad Prism software was used for statistical analysis.
Data availability. All raw and analysed data are available from the authors upon
request.
