ABSTRACT: Although ibuprofen is one of the most widely used nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it exhibits poor solubility in aqueous and
physiological environments as a free acid. In order to improve its oral
bioavailability and rate of uptake, extensive research into the development of
new formulations of ibuprofen has been undertaken, including the use of
excipients as well as ibuprofen salts, such as ibuprofen lysinate and ibuprofen,
sodium salt. The ultimate goals of these studies are to reduce the time required
for maximum uptake of ibuprofen, as this period of time is directly proportional
to the rate of onset of analgesic/anti-inflammatory effects, and to increase the
half-life of the drug within the body; that is, the duration of action of the effects
of the drug. Herein, we present a pharmaceutical cocrystal of ibuprofen and the
biocompatible metal−organic framework called CD-MOF. This metal−organic
framework (MOF) is based upon γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) tori that are coordinated to alkali metal cations (e.g., K+ ions) on both
their primary and secondary faces in an alternating manner to form a porous framework built up from (γ-CD)6 cubes. We show
that ibuprofen can be incorporated within CD-MOF-1 either by (i) a crystallization process using the potassium salt of ibuprofen
as the alkali cation source for production of the MOF or by (ii) absorption and deprotonation of the free-acid, leading to an
uptake of 23−26 wt % of ibuprofen within the CD-MOF. In vitro viability studies revealed that the CD-MOF is inherently not
affecting the viability of the cells with no IC50 value determined up to a concentration of 100 μM. Bioavailability investigations
were conducted on mice, and the ibuprofen/CD-MOF pharmaceutical cocrystal was compared to control samples of the
potassium salt of ibuprofen in the presence and absence of γ-CD. From these animal studies, we observed that the ibuprofen/
CD-MOF-1 cocrystal exhibits the same rapid uptake of ibuprofen as the ibuprofen potassium salt control sample with a peak
plasma concentration observed within 20 min, and the cocrystal has the added benefit of a 100% longer half-life in blood plasma
samples and is intrinsically less hygroscopic than the pure salt form.

■ INTRODUCTION
The development of new formulations that enhance water
solubility and bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients (APIs) is an important area of modern drug delivery
technology, given that a large number of highly active potential
drug candidates are relatively hydrophobic in nature.1,2
Additionally, oral administration routes are highly preferred
as a result of increased patient compliance3 as well as the
avoidance of needles/pain and sterile conditions during
formulation. Numerous types of oral formulations have been
proposed in order to overcome the obstacles related to poor
bioavailability of hydrophobic APIs, which include making use
of (i) micelles,4 (ii) micro/nanoemulsions,2 (iii) liposomes,5
(iv) dendrimers,6 (v) biodegradable polymer and mesoporous
silica nanoparticles,3,7,8 and (vi) water-soluble excipients, such
as cyclodextrins.9,10 The macrocyclic nature of cyclodextrins
(CDs), which consist of a central lipophilic cavity and a
hydrophilic outer surface, in addition to the truncated cone or
“bucket” shape of this class of molecules, facilitates the binding
and solubilization of hydrophobic guest molecules in hydro-
philic media. The ability of CDs to form inclusion complexes
with APIs is not only of interest for the development of
pharmaceutical formulations of poorly water-soluble drugs in
order to improve solubility and bioavailability, but additionally,
CDs (i) act as masking agents in oral formulations to disguise

 any bitter tastes,11 (ii) increase the drug “shelf life” by
protecting the API from various degradation processes,12 (iii)
can be used to develop sublingual and orally fast-dispersing/
disintegratable dosing forms,13,14 and (iv) enable liquid and oily
APIs to be formulated as a powered product.15 As a result of
their many facets, CDs are found in at least 35 pharmaceutical
formulations with β-CD used in the majority of these
products,16 and furthermore, natural cyclodextrins have been
classified as “Generally Recognized as Safe” by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.17
An alternative formulation strategy for APIs that is currently
being pursued takes advantage of the porous nature of metal−
organic frameworks (MOFs) and the ease with which the
porosity of these materials can be modified. Although MOFs
traditionally contained components that may be toxic, newer
generations of MOFs have been prepared with biocompatible
metals and organic linkers,18−21 wherein the pore size can be
tuned to accommodate a wide variety of drug molecules, the
metal can be used as an imaging contrast agent22 and the
organic linker itself can be transformed20 to the API.
Encapsulation within MOFs is not limited to drug delivery
applications, with the encapsulation of catalysts23−25 and
photosensitizers26 within MOFs to promote specific reactions
in confined spaces, and recently, the inclusion27,28 of molecular
switches within MOFs, in order to increase the robustness of
these systems, also being areas of intense research. Recently, we
reported29,30 the syntheses and structures of “green” porous
materials produced from γ-CD and alkali metal cations, namely,
CD-MOFs (Figure 1a−c). These materials are easily prepared
in the laboratory on a large scale from food-grade reagents. This
porous structure is based upon six γ-CD tori that are
coordinated to alkali metal cations on the primary face in an
alternating manner, forming (γ-CD)6 cubes. These cubes are
linked together in three dimensions by coordination of alkali
metal cations on the secondary faces of the γ-CD tori, leading
to an extended porous superstructure. Previous investigations
of this material have shown that CD-MOF (i) is very effective
in the sequestration of CO2 as a result of both chemisorption
and physisorption processes,31−33 (ii) can incorporate photo-
catalysts and metal nanoparticles within the framework,34−36
(iii) is amenable to postsynthetic functionalization, leading to
the synthesis of gel-like materials,37 and (iv) can be used as a
separation medium for the purification of a wide variety of
petrochemicals, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, the
regioisomers of xylene, and haloaromatic and alicyclic
compounds, as well as for the resolution of enantiomers.38,39
CD-MOFs are water-soluble, and given the fact that they are
constructed from γ-CD, they may also possess some of the
properties that are favorable for the development of oral drug
formulations that have been realized with both the naturally
occurring and chemically modified cyclodextrins. Additionally,
γ-CD can be hydrolyzed by salivary α-amylase,17 whereas α-
and β-CD are essentially stable to this enzyme but are instead
digested by intestinal microflora,9 leading to the possibility that
drug formulations based on CD-MOFs could result in rapid
dispersal dosing. To probe CD-MOF as a potential candidate
for formulation technologies, a recent Monte Carlo simulation
study40 of the loading of CD-MOF-1 with the ubiquitous
nonsteroidal antiflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen showed
that it is possible to incorporate a maximum of 27 wt % of this
drug within this porous framework.
Ibuprofen (Figure 1d) is a widely available and moderately
potent NSAID that has a low systemic toxicity, and, unlike
some other NSAIDs, such as aspirin, indomethacin, and
piroxicam, it has a relatively low risk of side-effects caused by
gastric damage.41 The mode of action of ibuprofen is believed

 to be through inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)
enzymes, particularly the COX-2 enzyme,41 which is localized
mainly in inflammatory cells and tissues. Ibuprofen has not only
been considered for acute pain relief, but it has also been used
to treat chronic inflammatory and degenerative diseases42 and is
also under consideration for treating a variety of cancers.43,44 It
has even been shown to extend the lifespans of yeast, worms,
and flies.45 This API has also been entrapped in a variety of
MOFs, including UiO-66 that had been modified with a variety
of functional groups resulting46 in loading ranges from 13 to 36
wt %, MIL-101(Cr) and 10% NH2-MIL-101(Cr) with
loadings47 of 46 and 47 wt %, respectively, MIL-53(Cr) and
MIL-53(Fe) that show48 loading capacities of around 20 wt %,
and MIL-100 and MIL-101 with ibuprofen loadings19 of 26 and
58 wt %, respectively. Very few investigations, however, have
considered the use22,49−53 of MOFs in vivo, as a consequence of
the toxic nature of the transition metal ions and/or the organic
linkers. The investigations that have probed in vivo activity have
focused mainly on intravenous, rather than oral, dosing as a
result of the poor water solubility of the MOFs that were used.
Herein, we discuss the loading of ibuprofen within CD-
MOF-1 using two protocols, cocrystallization and absorption,
and show that it is experimentally possible to achieve loadings
that match the theoretically calculated capacity. Additionally,
we performed IC50 cell viability studies on CD-MOF and
ibuprofen and found these materials to be nontoxic up to a
concentration of 100 μM. The pharmaceutical cocrystal was
tested on mice in order to assess the oral bioavailability and
pharmacokinetics, against control samples containing the
potassium salt of ibuprofen, by measuring the concentration
of ibuprofen found in blood plasma samples over time. It was
found that oral administration of the CD-MOF-1-based
cocrystal results in the same rapid uptake of ibuprofen that is
typically found for ibuprofen salts; yet the CD-MOF-1-based
cocrystal results in a statistically significant increase (over 2-
fold) of the half-life of ibuprofen in blood plasma. These results
suggest that the CD-MOF-1/ibuprofen cocrystal may be
suitable for dosings that require both rapid and sustained
pain relief. In addition, the preparation of the CD-MOF-1-
based pharmaceutical cocrystals by absorption of the free-acid
of ibuprofen into the framework is less intensive than
production of pure ibuprofen salts. Also, the CD-MOF-1-
based cocrystal does not appear to be as susceptible to
atmospheric moisture as the potassium salt of ibuprofen, which
is one of the reasons why this ibuprofen derivative has yet to be
used in commercial formulations in the form of a tablet, yet it is
available in the form of a liquid-filled gelatin capsule. The
potassium salt of ibuprofen, unlike the free-acid form, is soluble
in water, and the enhanced solubility of this salt and others,
such as the lysinate and sodium salts, is known to increase the
rate of uptake of ibuprofen compared to the free-acid, which
generally reaches peak blood plasma concentration after 1.5−2
h.54

 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Ibuprofen can be incorporated into CD-MOF-1 using two
methods. They are (i) crystallization of the CD-MOF-1 with
the potassium salt of ibuprofen as the source of alkali metal
cations required to form the framework, with charge balance
achieved by the incorporation of ibuprofen anions and (ii)
absorption of the free-acid form of ibuprofen into CD-MOF-1.
The first method is identical in principle to the synthesis of
edible CD-MOF-1 using potassium benzoate and making use of
EtOH vapor diffusion into the aqueous solution in order to
generate appropriate conditions for crystallization. In this case,
two ibuprofen anions are expected to be present per γ-CD ring:
this molar ratio is confirmed to be the case by using 1H NMR
(Figure 2) and comparing the integration of the signals
corresponding to the anomeric proton of γ-CD to the signals
arising from ibuprofen. This loading level equates to 23 wt % of
ibuprofen within CD-MOF-1. Furthermore, powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD, Figure 3) confirmed that the sample
crystallized by diffusion of EtOH vapor into an aqueous
solution of γ-CD and the potassium salt of ibuprofen is indeed
CD-MOF-1. It is important to note that this sample crystallizes
in the I432 space group, a situation that is usually observed for
samples prepared from alkali metal hydroxides, rather than the
R32 space group that is observed when potassium benzoate is
used29,30 as the alkali metal source with EtOH vapor diffusion.
Although large single crystals suitable for analysis by single-
crystal X-ray diffraction were readily obtained, the ibuprofen
anions could not be located within the porous framework as a
result of a large amount of disorder within the porous structure,
which has previously been observed in the case of CD-MOFs
grown with guest organic anions within the framework.30
The second approach relies on the crystallization of CD-
MOF-1 using potassium hydroxide as the alkali metal source.
For the purposes of preparing a pharmaceutical cocrystal,
EtOH, rather than MeOH, was used to generate the conditions
required for crystallization. After washing the prepared CD-
MOF crystals with EtOH and drying them under high vacuum
at room temperature overnight, the crystals were suspended in
a range of different solvents containing ibuprofen in the free
acid form, and this solution was left to equilibrate for 5 days.
The loading of ibuprofen within CD-MOF-1 was determined
by dissolution of the crystals in a 50% v/v H2O/EtOH solution
followed by analysis using UV−vis absorption spectroscopy. It
was found that the solvent used during the absorption process
is critical in controlling the amount of ibuprofen that is taken
up by CD-MOF-1. When relatively nonpolar solvents are used,
the uptake of ibuprofen within CD-MOF-1 is low, approx-
imately 5 wt % ibuprofen is loaded within the MOF using
hexanes and CH2Cl2. When EtOH is used as the solvent during
absorption, however, the loading of ibuprofen within CD-
MOF-1 increases substantially to 26 wt %, very close to what is
predicted40 by Monte Carlo simulations to be the maximum
loading capacity of ibuprofen within the MOF. Given that
maximum loading of ibuprofen within CD-MOF-1 is achieved
in the presence of more polar solvents, it is highly likely that the
mechanism of loading is associated with an anion exchange
process, wherein the free acid of ibuprofen is deprotonated by
the hydroxyl anions present in CD-MOF-1, and this newly
formed anion now acts to balance the positive charge of the
framework. Further evidence of this loading process is seen
when loading is attempted on CD-MOF-1 that has undergone
prior anion exchange with HCl, or CD-MOF-1 that has been

cocrystals. (b) PXRD patterns of CD-MOF-1/ibuprofen formulations after storage in ambient conditions for three months revealing that these

 grown from KCl (see Supporting Information, Figure S2),
which reveals less than one percent by weight loading of
ibuprofen in EtOH. When loading of ibuprofen into CD-MOF-
1, where Cl− is the counteranion for the framework (henceforth
referred to as CD-MOF-1-Cl), is undertaken in hexane, rather
than EtOH, a loading of 11−15 wt % is achieved. When the
framework is dissolved in H2O, a fine white precipitate is
observed, indicative of the presence of the free acid of
ibuprofen; however, exposure of the framework to a 50%
mixture of EtOH and H2O results in complete dissolution of
both CD-MOF-1 and ibuprofen.
In both of the loading scenarios that were tested, a racemic
mixture of ibuprofen was used. Although the (S)-(+)-enan-
tiomer of ibuprofen is the pharmaceutically active isomer, the
(R)-(−)-enantiomer is not toxic, unlike other NSAIDs, such as
naproxen, and, moreover, it can be metabolized in such a
manner that it undergoes unidirectional chiral inversion to the
(S)-(+)-enantiomer.55 Since we have previously shown39 that
CD-MOF has the ability to resolve enantiomers using HPLC
techniques, it was our hope that it might be possible to
crystallize or absorb the pharmaceutically active enantiomer
selectively within CD-MOF-1. Enantioselective absorption has
also been simulated56 to take place within the chiral framework
HMOF-1. Circular dichroism experiments, however, show no
enantioselectivity upon uptake of a racemic mixture of
ibuprofen within CD-MOF-1 using the loading conditions
described previously in EtOH where the ibuprofen anion is
formed. It is possible, however, to crystallize and absorb the
pure enantiomers into the CD-MOF, which gives similar
loading results as the racemic mixture of ibuprofen. The use of
the (S)-(+)-enantiomer for commercial formulations has not
been seen to be necessary as (i) a result of the low toxicity of
the (R)-(−)-enantiomer, (ii) the inversion of the (R)-
(−)-enantiomer to the pharmaceutically active enantiomer,
and (iii) the additional cost associated with the resolution of
enantiomers, either by separation or enantioselective synthesis.
Enantioselective uptake of ibuprofen is observed within CD-
MOF-1-Cl where the loading experiments were performed in
hexane. Circular dichroism studies (see Supporting Informa-
tion, Figure S3) on the mixtures created upon dissolution of
CD-MOF-1-Cl/ibuprofen cocrystals in 50% H2O/EtOH reveal
that the framework preferentially absorbs the (R)-(−)-enan-
tiomer in an enantiomeric excess of ∼58%. Although this
framework does not preferentially absorb the pharmaceutically
active enantiomer, this result indicates that the MOF could be
used to readily separate enantiomers, not only of ibuprofen, but
of other drugs where it is critical that only one enantiomer is
administered to a patient, i.e., naproxen. It can also be inferred
that the anion exchange process is not enantioselective, and the
nature of the counteranion within CD-MOF is an important
factor when considering applications of this framework.
Viability studies (Figure 4) of both CD-MOF-1 and
ibuprofen were carried out in vitro on two cell lines: MCF-
10A (human mammary epithelial cells) and MDA-MB-231
(human breast adenocarcinoma). In the case of both cell lines,
no IC50 value could be obtained for CD-MOF-1 and ibuprofen
up to concentrations of 100 μM. Therefore, we can conclude
that CD-MOF-1 does not appear to be toxic, and formulations
including CD-MOF-1 should be safe for use in animal studies.
Animal studies were conducted on 25 g female CD-1 IGS
mice (Crl:CD1(ICR)), and the pharmaceutical mixtures and
cocrystals were administered at a dose of 75 mg/kg ibuprofen
by oral gavage using a suspension in vegetable oil. Three mice
per time point for each mixture or cocrystal were euthanized,
and blood samples were collected after 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90,
120, and 240 min, which were then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for
10 min at 4 °C to obtain plasma. Blood plasma samples were
stored at −80 °C for transport for analysis by LC/MS.
Three mixtures or cocrystals of ibuprofen were tested: the
potassium salt of ibuprofen and a physical mixture of 23 wt %
ibuprofen, potassium salt with γ-CD (which is analogous to a
stoichiometric loading of ibuprofen within CD-MOF-1 created
by cocrystallization) were used as control samples, and the third
sample consisted of bulk CD-MOF-1 loaded with 26 wt %
ibuprofen by the absorption protocol. The potassium salt of
ibuprofen was considered to be the most appropriate control
for ibuprofen in this study, as the results of the solvent-
dependent absorption loading of ibuprofen suggest that an
anion exchange process is occurring within CD-MOF-1, i.e.,
deprotonation of the free-acid form of ibuprofen, which is
facilitated by water-miscible polar solvents. In fact, this method
of generating the potassium salt of ibuprofen is very simple and

IC50 value could be determined up to a concentration of 100 μM.

 results in a cocrystal that is stable under atmospheric
conditions, unlike the potassium salt of ibuprofen alone,
which is very hygroscopic, inhibiting tabletability. It is used,
however, in rapid release gelatin capsules. After storage under
ambient conditions for several months, the CD-MOF-1
cocrystal shows no signs of hygroscopicity, and the crystallinity
of the porous extended framework is maintained; however, the
intensities of the X-ray signals are rather different. Although the
pharmaceutical cocrystals show no visible signs of degradation
from ambient humidity, it is possible that the change in X-ray
intensities observed in the PXRD data are a result of interaction
of the CD-MOF with water vapor.
Pharmacokinetic data are shown in Figure 5 and Table 1.
The Microsoft Excel Add-in, PKSolver,57 was used to
determine the pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUC0‑t,
AUC0‑∞ (area under the curve until the last time point and
infinity, respectively), and the half-life (t1/2), and results are
reported as mean ± standard deviation. One-way analysis of
variance was carried out to evaluate the difference of the
pharmacokinetic parameters between different samples, fol-
lowed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test in order to
determine which means are statistically significantly different (P
= 0.05).
The maximum concentration of ibuprofen in plasma samples
for all three samples is reached rapidly, between 10−20 min,
which is ideal for analgesic drugs as this time interval
corresponds to a rapid onset of pain/inflammation relief.
Unexpectedly, the control sample, consisting of a physical
mixture of 23 wt % ibuprofen, potassium salt with γ-CD, shows
a statistically significant difference in the maximum concen-
tration of ibuprofen. This observation would tend to suggest
that γ-CD, or the byproducts of γ-CD hydrolysis, acts as an
excipient for the absorption of ibuprofen, most likely by
enhancing the solubility of ibuprofen after protonation in the
digestive tract to the free-acid form. A large standard deviation
for ibuprofen concentration in blood plasma is observed for this
particular control sample, suggesting that preparation of this
mixture may play a large role on its performance. The plasma
concentration data from the CD-MOF-1-based cocrystal has
less variance, indicating that this sample may be a more reliable
means of delivery of ibuprofen. The half-lives of the mixtures or
cocrystals containing γ-CD, as either the free molecule or as
part of CD-MOF-1, are statistically significantly longer than the
potassium salt of ibuprofen alone. This difference leads to the
interesting prospect of the development of a rapid acting
formulation of ibuprofen that is also effective for long periods
of time. Although the AUC0‑t and AUC0‑∞ values for the
samples containing γ-CD are higher than those for the pure
potassium salt of ibuprofen, which would indicate greater
bioavailability of ibuprofen in the formulations containing γ-CD
(either as a free molecule or CD-MOF-1), they are not
statistically significant (P = 0.05) in this study.
Salts of ibuprofen are used in commercially available
formulations, including the lysinate, arginate, and sodium
salts. These derivatives are typically more expensive than the
free-acid form of ibuprofen, particularly the amino acid
derivatives, but these derivatives all show faster rates of uptake
than the free-acid form. The potassium salt is only used in
liquid-filled gelatin capsules as a solution to the very
hygroscopic nature of the potassium salt. Incorporation of the
ibuprofen anion within CD-MOF-1 provides an alternative
method for preparing rapidly bioavailable versions of ibuprofen,
and given that it uses renewable and inexpensive ingredients, it
may be more cost-effective than the currently available means
of delivery. Additionally, CD-MOF-1 could be used as a fast-
dispersing pharmaceutical cocrystal since γ-CD can be
hydrolyzed by salivary α-amylase, which is another potential
advantage over current liquid filled capsules. Apart from the
need for further pharmacological testing, particularly compar-
isons to commercially available formulations, other consid-
erations regarding the use of CD-MOF-1/ibuprofen cocrystals
for oral dosages include the compactability of the formulation
in order to be able to produce suitable tablets as well as the
presence of potassium ions, which could lead to hyperkalemia.
Conversely, very high doses of ibuprofen can lead to
hypokalemia,58 in which case the presence of potassium ions
may be beneficial. Previous work has suggested that it is
possible to prepare CD-MOFs from sodium salts,30 particularly
sodium carbonate, which upon crystallization with γ-CD and
MeOH produces crystals with similar unit cell dimensions in
the I432 space group. On-going development of CD-MOF as a
formulation technology, created using either sodium or

■ CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that the NSAID ibuprofen can be incorporated
within the porous architecture of CD-MOF-1 in pharmaceuti-
cally relevant quantities. Although MOFs have been frequently
discussed as potential drug-delivery vehicles, very few instances
of in vivo studies involving MOFs have been reported to date.
In this instance, CD-MOF-1 is a nontoxic, biocompatible MOF,
and as a result of its assembly employing well-tolerated alkali
cations, as opposed to transition metals, it is able to incorporate
pharmaceutically active anions readily within its extended
structure. Pharmacokinetic data reveal that, following oral
administration, CD-MOF-1 cocrystals of the potassium salt of
ibuprofen exhibit similar bioavailability and rapid uptake in
blood plasma as the pure potassium salt of ibuprofen. The
samples that include the presence of γ-CD, however, show a
statistically significant increase in the half-life of ibuprofen when
compared to the ibuprofen salt alone. These results suggests
that CD-MOF-1 is effective as a delivery vehicle for NSAIDs
that could result in quick pain relief and extended duration of
the analgesic effect. Furthermore, the ease of creating this CD-
MOF-1-based cocrystal, by absorption of the free-acid of
ibuprofen directly within the framework, resulting in a stable
powder of the potassium salt, could be advantageous for
creating salts of other acid forms of NSAIDs such as naproxen,
as well as other drug molecules that are prone to limited salt
form tabletability. Given that CD-MOF-1 is assembled from γ-
CD, it is expected that drug formulations based on CD-MOF-1
will (i) exhibit the same advantages that have been reported
when using free cyclodextrins, as well as (ii) enhancing the
bioavailability of a wide range of poorly water-soluble drugs and
(iii) may even be used to generated solid formulations of liquid
and oily APIs. The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of
ibuprofen across different species are known59 to differ. It is
clear that, given the promising results obtained for CD-MOF-1-
based ibuprofen pharmaceutical cocrystals in mice, further
studies focused on a broader range of CD-MOF and API
combinations using significantly larger data sets and different
species, eventually including humans, appear to be warranted.
