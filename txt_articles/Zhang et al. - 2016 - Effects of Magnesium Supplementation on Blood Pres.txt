ABSTRACT 
The antihypertensive effect of magnesium (Mg) supplementation remains controversial. We 
aimed to quantify the effect of oral Mg supplementation on blood pressure (BP) by synthesizing 
available evidence from randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials. We searched trials of 
Mg supplementation on normotensive and hypertensive adults published up to February 1, 2016 
from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases; 34 trials involving 2,028 participants were eligible for 
this meta-analysis. Weighted mean differences of changes in BP and serum Mg were calculated 
by random-effects meta-analysis. Mg supplementation at a median dose of 368 mg/day for a 
median duration of 3 months significantly reduced systolic BP by 2.00 mmHg (95% CI: 0.43, 
3.58) and diastolic BP by 1.78 mmHg (95% CI: 0.73, 2.82); these reductions were accompanied 
by 0.05 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.03, 0.07) elevation of serum Mg compared to placebo. Using a 
restricted cubic spline curve, we found that Mg supplementation with a dose of 300 mg/day or 
duration of 1 month is sufficient to elevate serum Mg and reduce BP; and serum Mg was 
negatively associated with diastolic BP but not systolic BP (all P < 0.05). In the stratified 
analyses, a greater reduction in BP tended to be found in trials with high quality or low dropout 
rate (all P-values for interaction < 0.05). However, residual heterogeneity may still exist after 
considering these possible factors. Our findings indicate a causal effect of Mg supplementation 
on lowering BPs in adults. Further well-designed trials are warranted to validate the BP-lowering 
efficacy of optimal Mg treatment.

Introduction 
Magnesium (Mg), an essential element in the human body, may have beneficial health effects 
for the primary prevention of hypertension. Given the increasing prevalence and incidence of 
hypertension, the identification of effective and safe preventive measures that offer even modest 
blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects could have a significant public health impact. Several lines 
of evidence from laboratory research have suggested some underlying mechanisms. Mg may 
play a critical role in blood pressure (BP) regulation, through directly stimulating prostacyclin 
and nitric oxide formation 1, modulating endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent 
vasodilation 2, 3, reducing vascular tone and reactivity 4, and preventing vascular injury via its 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions 5, 6. Numerous experimental studies have implicated 
a pathophysiological link between lower Mg content in the blood (hypomagnesemia) or tissue 7-9 
and hypertension in various animal models. 
There is long-standing interest in the promising yet unproven role of Mg in the regulation of 
BP for the prevention of hypertension, while evidence from human studies has been both 
inconsistent and controversial. Observational epidemiologic evidence also suggested a negative 
association between dietary Mg intake and BP 10; however, Mg effects on both systolic and 
diastolic BPs were not consistent among individual trials of Mg supplementation 11. Previous 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on randomized trials have also been less conclusive 
for both systolic and diastolic BP 11-13. For instance, a recent meta-analysis reviewed 23 trials 
with a total of 1,173 participants and reported a significant decrease in systolic BP of 2-3 mmHg 
and diastolic BP of 3-4 mmHg elicited by a median dose of 410 mg/day Mg supplementation for 
an average of 11 weeks14. Nevertheless, there was considerable heterogeneity across trials in 
terms of trial quality, sample sizes, and participant characteristics. In particular, whether trial 
 4 
 
quality, treatment compliance, or participants’ baseline Mg status would modify the effects of 
Mg on lowering BPs remained unexplored in all previous studies, possibly due to the limited 
number of suitable trials, especially well-designed and conducted RCTs.  
To reliably test the BP-lowering effects of oral Mg supplementation, we therefore conducted 
a comprehensive meta-analysis to synthesize only direct evidence from randomized double-blind 
placebo-controlled trials. To evaluate the robustness of the overall results, we also examined 
whether and to what extent changes in BP were related to elevation in serum Mg levels elicited 
by Mg supplementation. 
Methods 
Search strategy 
We electronically searched and identified all relevant articles evaluating the anti-
hypertension effect of Mg based on randomized controlled trials of Mg supplementation from the 
MEDLINE and EMBASE databased published up to February 1, 2016. We separately searched 
“magnesium” or “Mg” for magnesium, “hypertension” or “blood pressure” for blood pressure, 
“supplementation”, “supplement”, “intervention”, “randomized controlled trial”, “randomized 
clinical trial”, “randomized trial”, “controlled trial”, or “clinical trial” for RCTs in article texts or 
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and then combined these three search results using the 
Boolean logic operator “AND”. All searches were limited to English language and human adults. 
Additionally, all bibliographies of related articles and current review articles were manually 
screened for additional potentially relevant articles.  
Selection criteria 
We included RCTs that assessed the response of BPs to Mg supplementation. To minimize 
 5 
 
potential bias and confounding, we focused solely on randomized controlled trials of oral Mg 
supplementation. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1). studies including pregnant or lactating 
women; 2). studies including patients with malignancy, severe infectious disease, active liver or 
renal disease, or other severe illnesses; 3). supplements combined with other minerals that affect 
BP and duration of Mg supplementation less than or equal to 1 week; and 4). nonrandom, open-
label, or self-controlled trials. Trials with combined supplements were eligible only when the 
combined antihypertensive drugs or mineral were applied identically in control and treatment 
groups.  
Study selection 
Title and abstract screening was performed for each article to remove obviously irrelevant 
and duplicated reports. Articles deemed potentially eligible by title and abstract screening were 
re-examined by full-text review according to the above standard inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
The eligibility of articles was finally determined by two independent authors (X Zhang and Y 
Li). Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion. 
Data extraction 
Two researchers (X Zhang and A. Rosanoff) independently extracted available data and 
relevant information into a standard form, which included: general information on the 
publication (first author’s last name and first initial, year of publication, and study location), 
participants (sex proportion, mean age or age range, number of participants, comorbidities, and 
combination therapy), study design (follow-up years, Mg formulation and dosage), as well as 
serum Mg and BP measures at baseline and after treatment. If repeated measures of Mg levels 
and BP at several time points were reported in a single trial, the last measures were selected for 
 6 
 
overall analysis; they were both included in the subgroup analysis only if they were stratified 
into different separate subgroups. The accuracy of extracted data was double-checked by another 
researcher (Y Li). 
Quality of trials 
We applied the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria (AHRQ) for quality 
assessment of RCTs to evaluate the risk of bias in all identified trials 15, 16. These criteria 
assessed adequate sequence generation for randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of 
outcomes assessors, similarity of groups at baseline, selective reporting, incomplete outcome 
data, and description of losses and exclusions by three different degrees for risk of bias (high, 
low, or unclear). We also assessed overall trial quality according to the five-point Jadad score of 
randomization, double-blinding, and withdrawals and dropouts. Points were awarded from 0 to 5. 
We sorted all trials into high-quality (> 3) and low-quality (≤ 3) groups, which were used for 
subgroup analysis stratified by trail quality.  
Statistical methods 
To evaluate the overall effects of Mg supplementation on BP, we compared the mean 
changes of systolic and diastolic BP between treatment and placebo groups after treatment by 
calculating weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidential intervals (CIs) using a 
random-effects meta-analysis model 17. We also estimated WMDs for serum Mg concentrations 
to assess the effectiveness of Mg supplementation on Mg status. We assessed the between-study 
heterogeneity by calculating both τ statistic and I2 statistics. The percentages of I2 around 25% 
(I2 = 25), 50% (I2 = 50), and 75% (I2 = 75) indicate low, medium, and high heterogeneity, 
respectively. Tau, τ, is the estimate of between-study standard deviation which indicates the 
 7 
 
extent to which such heterogeneity affects the final meta-analysis results.  
To explore major sources of heterogeneity and assess the robustness of the overall meta-
analysis results, we conducted subgroup analyses stratified by predefined subgroups, including 
age (< 65 or ≥ 65 y), sex (trials with women ≥ 50% or men > 50%), study location (America, 
Asia, Europe, or Latin America), Mg formulation (organic: Mg lactate, Mg citrate, Mg pidolate, 
Mg asparate; or inorganic: MgO, MgCl2, Mg(OH)2), elemental Mg dosage in mg (< 300, 300-  
399, ≥ 400 mg/day) and duration (< 30, 30 - 89, ≥ 90 days) of trials, baseline Mg (quartiles 
categories of baseline serum Mg), prior BP status (hypertensive or normotensive), medication 
use history (taking antihypertensive or diabetic drugs or off medication), methods of BP 
measures (sphygmomanometer or automatic monitor), and crossover design (yes or no), were 
conducted. Furthermore, to assess whether trial quality contributed to between-study 
heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analyses stratified by quality assessment of RCTs, 
including overall trial quality (high vs. low), sample size (< 50 vs. ≥ 50), dropout rate (< 10% vs. 
≥ 10%), and success of randomization. Success of randomization was assessed by examining the 
comparability of basal serum Mg and BPs between the randomly assigned Mg group and the 
placebo group in individual trials or according to the description of randomization in the 
individual article. Publication bias was evaluated first by visual inspection of the funnel plots and 
then by Begg’s adjusted rank correlation test 18.  
A restricted cubic spline regression analysis was performed to assess possible dose- and 
time-responses of BPs and serum Mg to Mg supplementation. For systolic or diastolic BPs or 
serum Mg, we calculated restricted cubic spline with three fixed knots at 10%, 50%, and 90% 
percentiles through the overall distributions based on all included studies for each eligible trial, 
separately, and then combined them to depict possible dose- and time-dependent relations of BPs 
 8 
 
and serum Mg levels to Mg supplementation 19, 20.  
Stata (Version 14; StataCorp, College Station, TX) software was used for all statistical 
analyses. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Results  
Our electronic and manual search identified a total of 615 potentially relevant publications. 
After excluding duplicative and irrelevant publications by screening titles and abstracts and 
reviewing the full-texts, 34 RCTs from 34 published articles met our inclusion criteria (Figure 
S1).  
Characteristics of included trials and participants  
We identified 34 eligible randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials that included a 
total of 2,028 normotensive or hypertensive participants (range: 13 to 461), aged between 18 and 
84 years, with 1,010 participants receiving Mg supplementation and 1,018 placebo (Table 1). 
Among them, 27 studies also measured serum Mg.  
Eleven trials used a crossover study design, and others were parallel designed; 55% (908) of 
the study population were women, and 45% (751) were men. The studies were conducted in 
America (4 trials), Asia (3 trials), Europe (17 trials), Latin America (9 trials). Most of the 
participants were either clearly hypertensive or normotensive (16 and 18 trials, respectively), and 
only one trial included participants with borderline hypertension 21. Most of the trials required 
that hypertensive patients go off medications ≥ 1 month (22 of 34 trials); and patients in four 
trials were still taking medications during the trials 22-25. Additionally, two trials included 
participants with low serum Mg (< 0.74 mmol/L) 25, 26. BPs were generally measured by 
sphygmomanometer (14 trials) or automatic monitor (9 trials) and only two trials applied 
 9 
 
ambulatory monitor recording of 24-h BPs 27, 28.  
The trial durations varied from 3 weeks to 6 months, though the vast majority (30 of 33 
trials) were longer than 1 month. Mg supplements differed between studies in formulation and 
dosage. A total of seven types of organic (15 trials) and inorganic Mg (18 trials) supplements 
were used: MgO, Mg(OH)2, MgCl2, Mg aspartate, Mg lactate, Mg citrate, and Mg pidolate. The 
daily dosage of Mg supplements in elemental Mg ranged from 240 to 960 mg, most of which (28 
trials, 82%) were equal or higher than the levels of U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance for 
adults (310 - 320 mg/day for women, and 400 - 420 mg/day for men 29). The characteristics of all 
identified trials are presented in Table S1. 
Effects on lowering BPs and elevating serum Mg 
Compared with the placebo groups of 34 trials, Mg supplementation at a median dose of 368 
mg/day (range: 238 - 960 mg/day) for a median duration of 3 months (range: 3 weeks - 6 
months) led to overall reductions in systolic BP (WMD = 2.00 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.43, 3.58; P = 
0.01 and τ = 3.1, I2 = 61.8) (Figure 1) and diastolic BP (1.78 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.73, 2.82; P = 
0.001 and τ = 2.2, I2 = 63.8) (Figure 2), while concomitantly elevating serum Mg levels by 0.05 
mmol/L (95% CI: 0.03, 0.07; P < 0.001 and τ = 0.03, I2 = 86.2) among 27 trials (Figure S2). 
Begger’s tests did not reveal substantial publication bias for the overall effects of Mg on systolic 
BP, diastolic BP, or serum Mg (P Begger’s > 0.05). 
 
 
 
 
Sources of between-study heterogeneity by subgroup analyses 
As shown in Table 1, non-significant differences in Mg effects on BPs were found by 
subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, study location, hypertensive status, baseline Mg status, 
antihypertensive or diabetic medication use history, method, times and position for BP measures, 
 10 
 
study design, Mg formulation, dosage, and trial duration (all P-values for interaction > 0.05). 
Systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly decreased by 5.69 mmHg (95% CI: 1.00, 10.37; τ = 
4.5, I2 = 54.3) and 2.55 mmHg (95% CI: 0.19, 4.92; τ = 1.9, I2 = 37.0), respectively, among 
participants taking anti-hypertensive or antidiabetic drugs (n = 7 trials), while reduction in BPs 
was non-significant among participants off antihypertensive or antidiabetic medications (systolic 
BP: -0.13 mmHg; 95% CI: -4.25, 4.00; τ = 5.6, I2 = 73.1; and diastolic BP: 1.52 mmHg; 95% CI: 
-1.09, 4.12; τ = 3.7, I2 = 80.5; n = 11 trials). However, P-value for interaction was > 0.05. The 
overall effects of Mg on serum Mg varied depending on the study location, Mg formulation, and 
baseline Mg status (all P-values for interaction ≤ 0.01).  
Additionally, in the sensitivity analysis, inclusion or exclusion of any individual trial did not 
substantially change the overall results for BPs and serum Mg. 
Dose- and time-responses of BPs to Mg supplementation 
Our dose- and time-response analyses of data from 27 trials showed that oral Mg 
supplementations at a dose of 200 mg/day or with a duration of one month was sufficient to 
significantly raise serum Mg (all P-values < 0.001). Higher doses (≥ 300 mg/day) or longer 
durations (≥ 2 months) were required to achieve maximal levels of serum Mg by 
supplementation (Figure 3 A and Figure 4 A). Consistently, there was a significant reduction in 
systolic BP accompanying rises in serum Mg levels in a similar non-linear time- and dose-dependent 
manner (both P-linearity = 0.07; n = 34 trials) (Figure 3 B and Figure 4 B) while dose- and time-
dependent reduction in diastolic BP seemed to be linear (all P- linearity = 0.02) (Figure 3 C and 
Figure 4 C). Furthermore, a positive relation between serum Mg elevation and the degree of 
diastolic BP lowering was found, neither the linear nor curvilinear dose- and time-dependent 
relationship was significant for systolic BP. On average, each 0.1 mmol/L increment in serum 
Mg was associated with a reduction of 2.26 mmHg (95% CI: 0.27, 4.26; n = 20 trials) in diastolic 
 11 
 
BP (Figure 5).  
Quality assessment of included trials  
Trial quality may have an impact on the overall results of diastolic and diastolic BP (Table 
1). However, the process of randomization was insufficiently described in identified studies, i.e., 
only 30% seemed to have adequate sequence generation and 15% had low risk of bias in 
allocation concealment (Figure S3). Of 24 high quality trials, both systolic and diastolic BP were 
significantly decreased by Mg treatment (systolic BP: -3.37 mmHg; 95% CI: -5.34, -1.40 and 
diastolic BP: -2.50 mmHg; 95% CI: -3.65, -1.36). In contrast, changes in systolic and diastolic 
BP were nonsignificant in the data from the ten low quality trials (systolic BP: 0.83 mmHg; 95% 
CI: -0.89, 2.56 and diastolic BP: 0.35 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.45, 2.15). The interactions were 
statistically significant between trials with high quality and trials with low quality for both 
systolic and diastolic BP (P-values for interaction < 0.05). Also, greater reductions in BPs tended 
to be observed among trials with low dropout rate (≥ 10% vs. < 10%; P for interaction < 0.05 for 
both systolic and diastolic BP).  
Discussion 
In this meta-analysis of 34 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving a 
total of 2,028 participants, we found that oral Mg supplementation led to a significant reduction 
in both systolic and diastolic BPs (2.00 and 1.78 mmHg, respectively), while systolic BP and 
diastolic BP responses differed slightly in dose- and duration-dependent manners, respectively. 
The BP-lowering effects of Mg supplementation were accompanied by elevated serum Mg 
levels. Greater reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP also tended to be present in trials with 
high quality, or low dropout rate. Taken together, our findings support a causal antihypertensive 
 12 
 
effect of Mg supplementation in adults.    
The mechanism of the anti-hypertension effects of Mg has been confirmed by laboratory 
studies. Mg plays a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension mainly through alerting vascular 
smooth muscle cell function and the peripheral vascular resistance. As a cofactor of enzymes in 
signal transduction pathways involved in vascular contraction, Mg is able to inhibit the 
vasoconstriction induced by cytosolic accumulation of calcium concentrations 30. And high 
levels of extracellular Mg were correlated with the improvements in hemodynamic status, such 
as blood flow, vascular resistance and capacitance function of vessels, which contributes to the 
pathoetiology of hypertension 31-34. Additionally, Mg has shown its antioxidant benefits in 
prevention of hypertension through attenuating the damage of vasculature from oxidative stress 
and preventing vascular injury 5, 6.  
Although accumulating evidence from such studies has indicated that low dietary or 
circulating Mg may be related to the development of hypertension due to its calcium antagonist 
and endothelial effects 35, epidemiologic evidence for a relationship between Mg intake and 
hypertension has been controversial. Several observational studies have suggested an inverse 
association between Mg intake and BP 10, 36-39, although, evidence from observational studies is 
indirect because of potential selection bias, residual confounding, measurement errors of Mg 
intake, and statistical uncertainty due to highly correlated dietary or lifestyle factors. Many small 
and short-term randomized trials have been conducted to directly test the effect of Mg 
supplementation in normotensive and hypertensive participants, but those results were 
inconsistent and inconclusive. Nonsignificant associations between dietary Mg and systolic or 
diastolic BP were found based on a meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials 40. In 
contrast, Jee et al. showed a small overall dose-dependent BP reduction with Mg 
 13 
 
supplementation from a meta-analysis involving 20 small randomized trials (13 to 461 
participants per trial) of short duration (3 to 24 weeks per trial) 12. A recent meta-analysis of 22 
trials, including 1,220 normotensive or hypertensive patients, reported a mean reduction of 2-3 
mmHg in systolic BP and of 3-4 mmHg in diastolic BP 14. The results were consistent with our 
findings of 2.00/1.78 mmHg reduction in systolic/diastolic BP from 34 randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trials. Our data indicated that provision of Mg may slightly lower BP 
and might be effective in preventing hypertension in the general population.  
Furthermore, our pooled results from 16 trials among hypertensive patients showed a 2.11 
mmHg (95% CI: 4.17, 0.05) decrease in diastolic BP, but a non-significant decrease in systolic 
BP (-2.16 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.71, 1.40). A significant reduction in diastolic BP but not in systolic 
BP was consistently identified by a Cochrane review of 12 RCTs among hypertensive patients 13. 
In our study, data from seven trials among 136 “treated” patients (those taking anti-hypertensive 
or diabetic drugs), suggest that both systolic (5.69 mmHg) and diastolic (2.55 mmHg) BP were 
significantly reduced. This discrepancy between “treated” and “untreated” patients might be 
partially caused by possibly lower baseline Mg status among treated patients, since loop and 
thiazide diuretics, mainly used among hypertensive and diabetic patients, may deplete potassium 
and Mg 41. On average, serum Mg was 0.74 mmol/L for “treated” patients, slightly lower than 
the current lower limits of the clinical normal range for serum Mg, 0.75-0.96 mmol/L 42. 
Moreover, our subgroup analysis indicated that the anti-hypertensive effect of Mg was 
significant only among the subgroup with Mg deficiency. Current evidence has also suggested 
that the anti-hypertensive effect of Mg might be valid only among patients with Mg deficiency or 
insufficiency 43. However, this conclusion needs to be confirmed by further specific research.  
Our dose-response analysis of 34 trials provided sufficient power to depict the dose-response 
 14 
 
analysis for both BPs and serum Mg. Due to relative low power and limited information 13, a 
previous meta-regression analysis of 14 double-blind randomized trials showed that a 240 
mg/day increase in Mg intake was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in systolic BP and 
diastolic BP among hypertensive patients 12. In addition, a relative large numbers of identified 
RCTs let it possible to explore the possible dose- and time-responses of BPs to Mg 
supplementation. And we found curvilinear dose- and time-dependent relationships for Mg 
supplementation and BPs and serum Mg levels. Furthermore, we quantified the associations 
between changes in serum Mg and BPs based on data from 27 of the 34 trials reported changes in 
serum Mg levels in our meta-analysis; we found that a 0.1 mmol/L increment in serum Mg was 
associated with a 2.26 mmHg reduction in diastolic BP. However, the association of changes in 
serum Mg with systolic BP was non-significant. Meanwhile, the significant relations between 
elevated serum Mg and BP-lowering effects indirectly supported the causal hypothesis of 
antihypertensive effect of Mg.  
Of note, there was considerable heterogeneity across the Mg studies in terms of trial quality, 
sample sizes, and participant characteristics, any of which could influence the accuracy of the 
pooled estimates. Although previous meta-analyses noted that heterogeneities might be induced 
by sex 13, study location, and types of study design 14, we found no evidence of modification 
from these factors on the effects of Mg supplementation on BPs. Non-significant heterogeneities 
were also found for age, Mg supplements, and methods of BP measurements. The results from 
high-quality trials (Jadad > 3) or trials with low dropout rates (< 10%) were more likely to show 
a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP after Mg supplementation than trials with 
low quality scores and high dropout rates. These findings provide strong support for the 
robustness of our results, indicating the BP-lowering effects of Mg.    
 15 
 
A major strength of this meta-analysis is the inclusion of only randomized double-blind 
placebo-controlled trials. With 34 trials, we achieved sufficient power to capture overall effects 
and assess the dose- and time-dependent relationships between BPs and Mg supplementation. 
Major sources of heterogeneity were explored by including 15 factors, including age, sex, study 
location, Mg formulation, dosage, trial duration, baseline Mg and BP status, antihypertensive or 
diabetic medication use history, methods, time, and position of BP measurements, and crossover 
design.  
However, several limitations merit consideration. First, most trials included were small with 
relatively high dropout rates. Second, we used serum Mg to reflect Mg status, though it may not 
be an optimally sensitive biomarker of Mg status in the human body 44, because only 0.3% of 
total body Mg is present in serum and serum Mg levels are normally maintained within a very 
narrow range. Therefore, the measurement of serum total Mg may not accurately reflect Mg 
bioavailability. Third, the benefits of Mg supplementation may be most dramatic in individuals 
with insufficient Mg status and might have enhanced effects by antihypertensive or antidiabetic 
drugs. However, we have insufficient data to test this hypothesis. Also, detailed information on 
diet and lifestyles of subjects is unavailable. Fourth, significant heterogeneity was present among 
RCTs; despite this, results were generally consistent across trials. Furthermore, our subgroup and 
sensitivity analysis results suggested that overall treatment effects did not differ appreciably by 
most specified factors. Fifth, nearly all identified trials measured BP by sphygmomanometer or 
automatic monitor; there are spare studies using 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring. Sixth, lack of 
detailed information cannot allow us to disentangle acute versus chronic effects by taking Mg 
supplements. Seventh, the observational nature of our subgroup analysis and spline regression 
analysis require cautious interpretation of their results. Also, our subgroup analyses stratified by 
 16 
 
study-level covariates, such as gender proportions and mean or median of ages, may be prone to 
aggregation bias or ecological bias because study-level covariates with limited variability may 
not precisely represent those at the individual or patient levels. We cannot completely rule out 
the possibility of a nonrandom impact of heterogeneity on the summary estimates, which cannot 
be easily handled by traditional statistical approaches. And residual heterogeneity may still exist 
after considering these possible factors. Finally, as in any meta-analysis, publication bias is 
possible. 
Perspectives 
The meta-analysis, based on evidence from 34 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 
trials, showed a significant antihypertensive effect of Mg supplementation on both systolic and 
diastolic BP among normotensive or hypertensive adults. The significant BP reduction by Mg 
supplementation was accompanied by elevated levels of serum Mg, and also tended to be evident 
in trials with high quality or low dropout rate, indicating a causal BP-lowering effect of Mg 
supplementation. Our findings suggested that oral Mg supplements can be recommended for the 
prevention of hypertension or as adjuvant antihypertensive therapy, although future rigorously 
designed RCTs with BP assessment as primary outcomes are warranted to yield confirmatory 
evidence.

Novelty and significance  
1. What is new?

This study is much larger with 34 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials
than previous meta-analyses. Therefore, we were able to achieve sufficient power to
detect an overall modest effect and reliably assess the dose- and time-dependent
relationships between Mg supplementation and BP changes.

Major sources of heterogeneity were explored thoroughly by subgroup analyses
stratified by 15 potential factors, which may potentially modulate the BP-lowering
effects by Mg supplementation.

Overall trial quality was qualitatively evaluated by AHRQ criteria and quantitatively
assessed by the Jadad score. Also, we further performed subgroup analyses stratified
by trial quality, trial sample size, randomization status, and dropout rate to evaluate
the robustness of our results.

Considering both intervention compliance and effectiveness, we evaluated changes in
serum Mg levels produced by Mg supplementation and found a close association with
concomitant BP reductions, indicating a causal effect.
2. What is relevant?

The findings support that Mg supplementation provides a moderate lowing-BP effect
among normotensive or hypertensive adults.

The study indicates that future large and rigorously designed randomized controlled
 25 
trials among participants at risks for Mg insufficiency and hypertension will be 
required to reliably confirm the antihypertensive effects of Mg supplementation 
before it can be recommended for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. 
3. Summary

This meta-analysis, based on reliable data from 34 rigorously randomized double-
blind placebo-controlled trials, provided robust evidence to support a causal effect of
Mg supplementation on lowering BPs in adults.
