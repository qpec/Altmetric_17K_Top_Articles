Abstract
Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic α- 
herpesvirus that causes chickenpox 
and establishes life- 
long latency in the cranial nerve and dorsal root ganglia of 
the host. To date, VZV is the only virus consistently reported to have an inverse 
association with glioma. The Glioma International Case- 
Control Study (GICC) 
is a large, multisite consortium with data on 4533 cases and 4171 controls col-
lected across five countries. Here, we utilized the GICC data to confirm the 
previously reported associations between history of chickenpox and glioma risk 
in one of the largest studies to date on this topic. Using two- 
stage random- 
effects 
restricted maximum likelihood modeling, we found that a positive history of 
chickenpox was associated with a 21% lower glioma risk, adjusting for age and 
sex (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.65–0.96). Furthermore, the protective effect 
of chickenpox was stronger for high- 
grade gliomas. Our study provides additional 
evidence that the observed protective effect of chickenpox against glioma is un-
likely to be coincidental. Future studies, including meta- 
analyses of the literature 
and investigations of the potential biological mechanism, are warranted.

Chickenpox & Glioma Risk
E. S. Amirian et al.
Introduction
Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic α- 
herpesvirus 
that causes chickenpox by initially infecting the respiratory 
mucosa and then progressing into viremia, during which 
the virus is transported to and replicates in the skin [1]. 
Prior to the licensing of the live attenuated VZV vaccine 
in the 1990s, chickenpox was an extremely common child-
hood illness, affecting over 90% of individuals [2, 3]. 
After acute infection, the virus establishes life- 
long latency 
in the cranial nerve and dorsal root ganglia of the host, 
and may later reactivate in about 10–20% of VZV- 
infected 
individuals, causing shingles. Viral reactivation can also 
result in other neurological complications, such as encepha-
litis and myelitis [2, 4].
Because of its neurotropism and its ability to establish 
decades- 
long latency across the neuraxis, [4] VZV is par-
ticularly interesting to investigate in relation to gliom-
agenesis. In fact, of the many viruses previously suspected 
to be involved in glioma susceptibility (i.e., simian virus 
40, BK virus, JC virus, human cytomegalovirus, human 
herpesvirus- 
6) [5–7], VZV is the only virus consistently 
reported to have an inverse association with glioma [3]. 
The observed inverse relationship between VZV infection 
and glioma risk has remained relatively consistent across 
studies with different VZV exposure assessment methods, 
such as self- 
reported history of chickenpox [8, 9], total 
anti- 
VZV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels [9–12], and 
levels of antibodies against specific VZV proteins [13]. 
Furthermore, because of its ability to replicate rapidly 
and lyse malignant glioma cells in vitro, VZV has even 
been proposed as a novel candidate for glioma virotherapy 
[14].
The Glioma International Case- 
Control Study (GICC) 
is a large, multisite consortium with data on 4533 cases 
and 4171 controls collected across five countries [15]. 
The GICC provides an unparalleled opportunity to confirm 
the previously reported associations between history of 
chickenpox and glioma in the largest study to date on 
this topic.
Materials and Methods
Study population
Details on the GICC study population and recruitment 
methods are available elsewhere [15]. Briefly, the GICC is 
an international consortium with 14 recruitment sites: 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, MA, USA), Case 
Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio, USA), 
Columbia University (New York, NY, USA), Danish Cancer 
Society Research Centre (Copenhagen, Denmark), The 
Gertner Institute (Tel Hashomer, Israel), Duke University 
(Durham, NC), University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer 
Center (Houston, TX, USA), Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA), Mayo Clinic 
(Rochester, MN, USA), NorthShore HealthSystem (Chicago, 
IL, USA), Umeå University (Umeå, Sweden), University of 
California, San Francisco (San Francisco, CA, USA), 
University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA, USA), 
and The Institute of Cancer Research (London, United 
Kingdom). All participating institutions received Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) or ethical board approval for the study, 
and informed consent was obtained from participants.
Cases were defined as individuals within 18–80 years of 
age (at diagnosis) who had one of the following types of 
histologically confirmed, supratentorial, intracranial gliomas: 
fibrillary astrocytoma (9420/3), protoplasmic astrocytoma 
(9410/3), gemistocytic astrocytoma (9411/3), oligodendro-
glioma (9450/3), oligoastrocytoma (9382/3), anaplastic 
astrocytoma 
(9401/3), 
anaplastic 
oligodendroglioma 
(9451/3), anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (9382/3), gliosarcoma 
(9442/3), and glioblastoma (9440/3). All cases were recruited 
within a year of diagnosis and consented at their clinic 
visits. All sites started recruiting participants in April 2010.
Controls were 18–80 years of age. Because not all sites 
were able to recruit controls using the same methods 
(due to issues related to existing infrastructure and 
resources), four sites recruited clinic- 
based controls, three 
sites recruited population- 
based controls, and seven sites 
recruited visitors of cancer patients as controls [15].
Data collection
All 14 sites used a common study protocol and the same 
risk factor questionnaire. Study coordinators were trained 
to ensure site- 
to- 
site homogeneity in data collection prac-
tices. Data were stored in a centralized database, and were 
managed by the lead statistician. More details on our 
data collection methods have previously been published 
[15].
The GICC risk factor questionnaire included demo-
graphic characteristics, past medical history, and occupa-
tional exposure history. Questionnaires were administered 
through phone and/or in- 
person interviews, or through 
mailed self- 
administered forms. Specifically with regard 
to VZV- 
related conditions, participants were asked whether 
they had ever had any of a list of viral infections, which 
included chickenpox and shingles. If they answered yes, 
they were asked their age or what year it was when they 
had chickenpox or shingles.
Statistical analysis
The overall GICC analysis plan, as well as details of key 
sensitivity analyses, are available elsewhere [15]. Here, we

compared cases and controls on selected characteristics, over-
all, by study site [not shown], and by tumor grade (high- 
grade: WHO Grade IV; lower grade: Grade II and III) among 
cases. Self- 
reported history of chickenpox and self- 
reported 
history of shingles were the exposures of interest.
Site- 
specific unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs), 
and their corresponding 95% Wald confidence intervals 
(CIs), were calculated, using unconditional logistic regres-
sion. Sites with less than five cases or controls in the exposed 
or unexposed groups were excluded from the meta- 
analyses. 
To calculate the meta- 
analysis ORs (mOR), we utilized both 
two- 
stage random- 
effects maximum likelihood and two- 
stage 
random- 
effects restricted maximum likelihood (REML) mod-
eling [15]. Only final results from the two- 
stage REML are 
presented, as results were very similar using the other method. 
The I2 statistic was used for each meta- 
regression model 
to evaluate the proportion of variability in the effect esti-
mates due to heterogeneity, and the τ2 statistic was calculated 
to assess the intersite variance. In some stratified analyses, 
the numbers became too sparse to calculate mORs, and 
thus pooled ORs (pORs) had to be provided instead.
Age and sex were considered potential confounders 
(determined a priori) and were adjusted for in all mul-
tivariable models, though adjustment for these factors did 
not meaningfully alter effect estimates. Education, race/
ethnicity, allergy status, and cigarette smoking history were 
evaluated as potential data- 
based confounders and were 
not found to be such, based on a 10% change- 
in- 
estimate 
criterion. These variables were therefore not included in 
the final models. We also stratified our models by age 
at chickenpox development (<6, 6–9, and >9 years of 
age), and separately by glioma diagnosis/study enrollment 
age groups (<40, 40–59, and >59 years of age).
Sensitivity analyses were conducted in which we included 
and excluded proxy respondents in the final models and 
compared the results to ensure that there were no mean-
ingful differences between the ORs. Possible patterns or 
discrepancies in effect estimates between sites with different 
control types (visitor, clinic- 
, or population- 
based) or dif-
ferent questionnaire administration methods (in- 
person, 
mailed, or telephone) were also evaluated [15]. All analyses 
were conducted in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) or 
R version 3.1.2 (Vienna, Austria, http://www.R-project.org).

total controls). A table of the study population demo-
graphics by site has previously been published [15]. The 
majority of the study population was non- 
Hispanic white, 
but there was a slightly higher preponderance of non- 
Hispanic black race/ethnicity among controls. The age 
distribution was similar among cases and controls, but 
as expected, high- 
grade glioma cases were slightly older.
Approximately, 79% of cases and 83% of controls 
reported a positive history of chickenpox. Overall, a posi-
tive history of chickenpox was associated with a 21% 
lower glioma risk, controlling for age and sex (Fig. 1A; 
mOR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65–0.96). A significant adverse OR 
was not observed at any site, and most site- 
specific ORs 
were in the protective direction, though many did not 
reach statistical significance (possibly due to small num-
bers/inadequate statistical power). Two sites, Case Western 
Reserve University and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, 
were excluded due to having cell counts below five.
Restricting to high- 
grade gliomas, the mOR was slightly 
stronger and remained statistically significant (Fig. 1B; 
Figure 1. Forest plots for the associations between history of chickenpox and glioma: Findings from the Glioma International Case- 
Control Study

mOR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.58–0.96), whereas among lower 
grade gliomas, the effect was attenuated and no longer 
statistically significant (Fig. 1C; mOR: 0.83, 95% CI: 
0.66–1.05). Further stratifying by glioma diagnosis/study 
enrollment age group, we found that the strongest inverse 
association of chickenpox with high- 
grade glioma risk was 
observed among the youngest age group (pOR: 0.53, 95% 
CI: 0.31–0.90, among participants <40 years of age at 
diagnosis/enrollment) [data not shown]. While the pORs 
among the older age groups remained similar to the overall 
estimate for high- 
grade glioma risk (pOR: 0.81 and pOR: 
0.79, for 40–59 and >59 years of age, respectively), they 
did not attain statistical significance. No patterns were 
observed by glioma diagnosis/study enrollment age for 
lower grade glioma risk, and none of the age- 
stratified 
pORs were statistically significant.
The age at which participants developed chickenpox 
was also considered in our analyses [not shown]. A posi-
tive history of chickenpox was associated with an approxi-
mately 20–30% lower glioma risk, regardless of whether 
the participants developed chickenpox under age six (mOR: 
0.70, 95% CI: 0.55–0.89), between the ages of six and 
nine (mOR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.59–0.93), or above age nine 
(mOR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59–0.98).
In the overall study population, 10.3% of cases and 
9.2% of controls reported having at least one episode of 
shingles. About 28% of participants reported having their 
first episodes of shingles before age 30 (overall median 
age: 44; median among cases: 44; median among controls: 
43). A positive history of shingles was not significantly 
associated with glioma risk (mOR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.89–1.38). 
The mORs were similar stratified by tumor grade.
Discussion
In our study, a positive history of chickenpox was associ-
ated with a 21% lower glioma risk, adjusting for age and 
sex. The protective effect of chickenpox was stronger for 
high- 
grade glioma, particularly among those under age 
40. Our findings, which represent the results of the largest 
study to date on this topic, confirm the inverse associa-
tions previously reported in the literature on VZV and 
glioma.
The majority of published studies on VZV infection 
and glioma risk are from the San Francisco Bay Area 
Adult Glioma Study (SFBAGS) series [8–11, 13]. Using 
both self- 
reported and serologic (anti- 
VZV IgG) data to 
assess history of chickenpox, findings from this series have 
indicated that prior exposure to VZV is associated with 
an approximately 40% lower glioma risk [9–11]. Although 
the odds ratio presented here is not quite as strong as 
those reported from the SFBAGS series, our estimate is 
based a larger study population and may possibly be more 
precise. However, additional studies, including meta- 
analyses of all published findings, are necessary to estimate 
the true magnitude of effect.
Like our study, the SFBAGS analyses have implied that 
the inverse association with prior VZV infection may be 
stronger for high- 
grade glioma [9, 11]. For example, 
Wrensch et al. reported an OR of 0.6 for the association 
between anti- 
VZV IgG positivity and any glioma (95% 
CI: 0.3–1.3), whereas their effect estimate when restricting 
to glioblastoma was stronger and attained statistical sig-
nificance (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.1–0.9) [11]. Additionally, 
in a follow- 
up study, the SFBAGS investigators observed 
that mean log anti- 
VZV IgG levels were higher for con-
trols than glioma cases, but were actually lowest for glio-
blastoma cases [9].
Besides the SFBAGS series, a few other epidemiologic 
studies have found similar associations between chickenpox 
and glioma risk [3, 12]. Sjostrom et al. utilized specimens 
from three Scandinavian cohorts to investigate the asso-
ciation between VZV antibodies and glioma risk [12]. 
Again, lower levels of anti- 
VZV IgG were more common 
in glioma cases than in controls, particularly 2 years before 
diagnosis (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.37–1.08; inter- 
quartile P 
for trend = 0.03). Because of the use of prediagnostic 
specimens, this study provided further evidence that VZV 
antibody- 
glioma associations reported in the literature are 
unlikely to be a result of postdiagnostic or treatment- 
related factors (e.g., steroid use). Furthermore, such sero-
logic studies also suggest that the associations observed 
between self- 
reported history of chickenpox and glioma 
risk are unlikely to be completely attributable to memory 
problems or cognitive deficits in glioma patients.
A particularly interesting finding of our study is that 
the protective effect of chickenpox against high- 
grade 
glioma was strongest among the youngest (<40) age group. 
Median age at glioma development is 55 years [16]. It 
is possible that high- 
grade gliomas that develop in younger 
individuals are etiologically heterogeneous from those that 
develop in older individuals. In fact, recent evidence indi-
cates that potentially etiologically distinct glioma subtypes 
(defined by specific tumor molecular markers) have dif-
ferent ages at presentation [17]. Nevertheless, our finding 
needs to be confirmed in other studies before definitive 
conclusions can be drawn, especially given that this obser-
vation was made among the smallest sample size of the 
three age groups examined.
In our study, shingles was not associated with glioma 
risk. Some previous studies have found an inverse asso-
ciation with glioma risk, though shingles has not been 
studied as frequently as chickenpox and has often been 
combined with chickenpox, rather than examined separately 
[9]. In our study, the age at first shingles episode was 
skewed toward a younger distribution, compared to 
 1357

Chickenpox & Glioma Risk
E. S. Amirian et al.
previous reports [18–20]. In the U.S. and Europe, median 
age for shingles has been reported to be between 60 and 
70 years. The median age in the GICC data was much 
younger (44 years). Although the incidence of shingles 
at younger ages may be increasing [21, 22], we believe 
that the age distribution reflected in our study is unlikely 
to be completely accurate. It is possible that some indi-
viduals are unsure of what shingles is or believed it to 
be synonymous with chickenpox or another viral rash. 
Unfortunately, there is no way to verify these data, and 
thus 
we 
must 
interpret 
our 
results 
on 
shingles 
cautiously.
The biological mechanism through which chickenpox 
may confer protection against glioma is currently unclear. 
One proposed mechanism is that VZV antibodies may 
demonstrate some cross reactivity to tumor cells (or 
other oncogenic viruses), and are thus capable of helping 
mount a protective immune response against existing 
tumor cells [9]. Conversely, it is also possible that indi-
viduals who are more likely to develop cancer may be 
unable to mount strong immune responses to infections 
such as VZV [23].
A limitation of our study is the amount of intersite 
heterogeneity 
between 
our 
14 
international 
sites. 
Accordingly, we have provided site- 
specific odds ratios 
and have used random- 
effects meta- 
regression in an effort 
to account for some of this heterogeneity. Because ques-
tionnaire administration methods and control types differed 
between sites, we have also conducted a number of sen-
sitivity analyses (methods described in reference 15) to 
ensure that these differences did not detectably bias the 
results of our analyses.
Findings from the previous literature, bolstered by 
those of our study, provide strong epidemiologic rationale 
for continued investigation of the potential role of 
chickenpox (or other manifestations of VZV infection) 
in glioma development [3, 8–13]. Future studies will 
need to account for the potential impact of the VZV 
vaccine, which was licensed in 1995 in the U.S. for use 
among children [2] (and therefore cannot be evaluated 
in the older population of the GICC). Prior serologic 
analyses have demonstrated that antibody composition 
differs between children who experience a wild- 
type VZV 
infection versus those who were received the vaccine 
[24]. Some evidence indicates that antibodies against 
specific VZV- 
encoded proteins (i.e., VZV ORF2 and 
IE63) may be more important than others in conferring 
protection against glioma [13], but the vaccine does 
not contain antigens corresponding to all 70 VZV open 
reading frames [1, 3, 24]. Thus, future research ascer-
taining whether the vaccine confers similar protection 
against glioma as the wild- 
type VZV infection is of 
high importance and may lend insight into the biologi-
cal mechanisms at play.
