ureteroscopy (URS; 86%) and percutaneous nephrolithoto-
my (149%). Emergency URS procedures have increased by 
38%. Day-case rates for ureteric and renal URS, in 2013/2014, 
were 22 and 21%, respectively.  
Conclusions: Over the last 
7 years, there is a rising prevalence of kidney stone disease 
with associated increase in the number of interventions re-
lated to it. Both elective and emergency URS procedures are 
increasing, with a rising trend for day-case URS. Similar trends 
are seen worldwide and future resource planning for uroli-
thiasis is needed to match the increase in demand.

Introduction 
 
With a global incidence of around 10%, urolithiasis 
and its management is becoming a major healthcare issue 
 
[1–5] 
. Technological advances have resulted in ever in-
creasing treatment options, enabling us to achieve im-
proved stone-free rates and offering our patients the best 
quality care.

Abstract 
 
Aims: The study aimed to determine the current trends in 
urolithiasis-related admissions and associated interventions 
in England between 2006/2007 and 2013/2014 utilizing 
 
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) online data.  
Material and 
Methods: Data was extracted from the online HES data set for 
each year from 2006/2007 to 2013/2014 inclusive. Admis-
sions and procedural interventions were identified from their 
corresponding OPCS-4 and ICD-10 codes.  
Results: Finished 
consultant episodes (FCEs) for urolithiasis have increased by 
20% over the last 7 years, with 93,039 FCEs in the year 
2013/2014. Based on English population statistics, the life-
time prevalence of urolithiasis based on hospital-related ad-
mission/intervention data for 2013/2014 is 14%. The biggest 
increases were seen in those aged  
≥ 
75 years (up by 51%, n = 
2,853). Total interventions have increased from 28,624 to 
42,068, with increased rates of shock wave lithotripsy (26%),

In England, the National Health Service (NHS) col-
lects Hospital Episodes Statistic (HES) data that report on 
trends in English health utilization. Initially set up in 
1987, HES data are reported on an annual basis. Classifi-
cation of diseases (ICD-10) and surgical procedures and 
interventions are coded (using the OPCS-4) that is man-
datory for admitted patient care commissioning data 
sets. Every hospital-related admission or procedure in 
 
England is coded in the secondary care setting, by an in-
dependently trained clinical coder. Data from each orga-
nization can then be collated nationally to derive the HES 
data set. HES data can be used for multiple purposes, 
 
including health resource planning, analysis of trends in 
admissions and interventional procedures, as well as fu-
ture work force planning needs.
 
HES data are freely available online (http://www. 
hesonline.nhs.uk) and can be accessed, downloaded and 
analyzed independently via the website. In 2012, Turney 
et al. 
 [2] 
 reported on current trends in stone disease, uti-
lizing English HES data over a 10-year period up to 2010. 
They reported increases in the prevalence and treatment 
of stone disease in England, concluding that such increas-
es will have important implications for workforce plan-
ning, training, service delivery and research in the stone 
disease.
 
In the past few years, endourological advances and in-
creasing sub-specialization have helped improve stone 
management for our patients. In view of the ever-increas-
ing healthcare demands, limited financial funding and in-
creased patient expectations, we believe it is imperative 
that we know the current trends in stone disease. Our aim 
is to update and further examine trends in kidney stone 
disease in England, using HES data, for disease preva-
lence and management.
 
Methods 
 
All data were exported from the HES online data set (http://
www.hesonline.nhs.uk). Data were collected on a yearly basis, 
from 2006/2007 to 2013/2014, inclusive of a 7-year period. The 
prevalence of stone-related admissions, using the ICD-10 diagno-
sis codes, was collected. Reported data relate to finished consultant 
episodes (FCEs). Using the OPCS-4 procedural codes, we were 
able to identify all stone-related procedures  
[6–10] 
. Data collected 
included the following: age, demographics, location and nature of 
the procedures, emergency workload, length of stay (LoS) and pro-
cedural day-case rates.
 
Extrapolating these data to population statistics gives an esti-
mate of urolithiasis requiring FCEs in England. According to the 
Office of National Statistics, the mid-year estimate of the popula-
tion in England was 51.0 million people in the year 2005 and 
53.9 million in the year 2013  
[3] 
, representing a 6% increase. This 
gives an annual prevalence of stone disease requiring a hospital 
visit of 0.153% in 2006 rising to 0.172% in 2013. With an average 
life expectancy, across both sexes, of 79.7 years in 2005–2007 and 
of 81.25 years in 2012–2014 in England  
[4] 
, this estimates an in-
crease in the lifetime prevalence of urolithiasis from 12.19 to 
13.98% over that time period. As these figures are based on coded 
hospital data, if stone-related community episodes are accounted, 
the lifetime prevalence is likely to be much higher.
 
Results 
 
Finished Consultant Episodes 
 
FCE for urolithiasis increased from 77,868 procedures 
in the year 2006/2007 to 93,039 in the year 2013/2014. 
This represents an increase in activity of 20% over the last 
7 years. Across all age groups, except those less than 14 
years, there was an increase in the total number of FCE. 
The percentage increase during these time periods was 
most significant in the >75 years age group (51%, from 
5,611 to 8,964). FCE urolithiasis for 60–74 years in-
creased by 35% (from 16,777 to 22,644), while it in-
creased by only 12% (from 55,007 to 61,310) for those of 
15–59 years. Meanwhile, the number of FCEs in those <14 
years decreased marginally by 6% during the period of 
analysis.
 
Analysis of total interventions for urolithiasis per FCE 
including shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), percutaneous 
nephrolithotomy (PCNL), ureteroscopy (URS) and open 
surgery has demonstrated a significant increase too. In 
2006/2007, there were a total of 28,624 FCE interventions 
for urolithiasis in total; this figure increased to 42,068 in 
2013/2014, an increase of 47%. Perhaps the most stagger-
ing increase was in the rates of PCNL that rose from 678 
in 2006/2007 to 1,687 in 2013/2014, representing an in-
crease of 149%. It should be noted, however, that the 
PCNL rate increased from 678 in 2006/2007 to 1,209 in 
2007/2008 representing an increase of nearly 79% in 
1 year. The number of open procedures for urolithiasis 
decreased by 38% (from 328 to 202) during the study pe-
riod. Both SWL and URS demonstrated increases in FCE 
by 26 and 86%, respectively.
 
Further sub-analysis of trends in SWL and URS, by 
location of stone, confirms an increasing trend across all 
modalities and locations. There was, in total, a 45% in-
crease in SWL and URS for renal and ureteric stones from 
2006/2007 to 2013/2014. Notably during the study peri-
od, interventions for renal stones using URS had in-
creased from 2,597 in 2006/2007 to 6,048 in 2013/2014, 
an increase of 133%. At the same time, SWL for ureteric

stones remained relatively static when taking the popula-
tion variance into account, which rose marginally from 
3,130 to 3,307 (6% increase) during the time period. In 
contrast, ureteric URS increased by 67%.
 
Analysis of emergency procedures for urolithiasis con-
firms the commonest intervention to be ureteric URS, 
with ureteric SWL and renal URS also prevalent but at 
much lower rates ( 
table 1 
). The total number of emer-
gency ureteroscopic interventions increased by 38% from 
1,048 in 2006/2007 to 1,447 in 2013/2014, the highest to-
tal number of interventions to date. Renal URS showed 
the most significant rate of rise with a 90% increase in 
procedures. However, it should be noted that they ac-
counted for only 15% of all emergency ureteroscopic pro-
cedures in the year 2013/2014.
 
Length of Stay 
 
Throughout the time period, the median overall LoS 
for URS and PCNL have decreased by an average of 36%. 
Interestingly, the LoS for PCNL decreased from 5 to 
4 days between 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 and has stayed 
consistently at 4 days since. Ureteric and renal URS LoS 
have decreased from 2.21 to 1.17 and 4.33 to 2.25 days, 
respectively (47 and 48% decrease LoS). This is largely 
due to the almost exponential increase in day-case proce-
dures for both renal and ureteric URS.
 
Day-Case URS 
 
The rate of day-case ureteric URS increased 3-fold, 
while the rate of day-case renal URS increased by over 
6-fold ( 
table 2 
). Despite such increases in day-case rates,

Discussion 
 
Findings of Our Study 
 
Trends of Urolithiasis and Interventions 
 
Our data demonstrate that there has been a significant 
increase in FCEs as a result of urolithiasis. Certainly, the 
lifetime prevalence of urolithiasis has historically been re-
ported at 10%  
[2] 
; these current data put that figure at clos-
er to 14%, meaning roughly 1 in 7 of the population will 
require a hospital-based intervention for urolithiasis. Sim-
ilar trends of increased intervention for urolithiasis has 
also been demonstrated in a Canada-based study, which 
demonstrated a 48% increase in patients undergoing kid-
ney stone procedures between 1991 and 2010  
[11] 
. It must 
be noted that the prevalence data are based on FCEs, and 
one patient may have had multiple FCEs over a year and 
therefore, these estimates will vary. The increasing preva-
lence of urolithiasis is likely to be a result of increased prev-
alence in obesity, associated metabolic syndrome and type 
2 diabetes  
[12] 
. The increasing age of patients presenting 
with stones, as well as the postulated underlying causes of 
obesity, and the metabolic syndrome pose significant prob-
lems for those commissioning healthcare. Whilst no cost-
ing analysis has been performed for this paper, there is 
clearly a significant and growing challenge to the provision 
of care for patients with urolithiasis both in terms of health 
expenditure and resource utilization.
 
Interestingly, in our study, the most significant rate of 
rise in FCEs for urolithiasis occurred in the >75 years age 
group (51% increase) over the study period. This was also 
demonstrated in an American study, reporting signifi-
cantly increased hospital admissions for stones in older 
patients  
[13] 
. Certainly, this contradicts the classical 
teaching that stone disease affects the young and middle 
aged. This may have significant clinical and resource im-
plications, particularly with an aging population. A recent 
analysis in the US has demonstrated an increasing trend 
of short-stay hospitalizations in the elderly population 
 
[14] 
. No correlation with the increasing incidence of uro-
lithiasis was made; however, the importance of these 
2 findings is related to the fact that the average LoS in the 
emergency department is 20% longer in older adults com-
pared to younger patients and the use of laboratory and 
radiology services is 50% higher, with a 4-fold increase in 
need for social service input  
[14] 
. This has significant im-
plications for those involved with the planning and provi-
sion of healthcare.
 
Our data demonstrate an increase in the number of 
FCEs for PCNL of 79% between the years 2006/2007 and 
2007/2008. Care should be taken in the interpretation of 
this result. PCNL has only had its own OPCS-4 code 
(M16.4) since 2006  
[5] 
; it is therefore likely that there was 
an under-representation of PCNL procedures within that 
year. Nevertheless, there has been an increase in the num-
ber of PCNLs performed between 2007/2008 and 
2013/2014 to the tune of 70%. In contrast, a recent, re-
gional, study in New Zealand demonstrated a decrease in 
PCNL procedures over a similar time period  
[15] 
. It is, 
however, possible that the number of PCNLs performed 
in England will continue to rise. Recent advances in the 
technologies associated with performing PCNL, includ-
ing the use of mini-PCNL,  
ultramini-PCNL and micro-
PCNL, have resulted in percutaneous access to kidney 
stones via a 4.8F tract  
[16] 
. However, a recent systematic 
review and meta-analysis comparing PCNL (including 
mini-PCNL and micro-PCNL) advocated against the use 
of these new technologies pending further randomized 
studies  
[17] 
. It is therefore difficult to accurately predict 
the future of PCNL within England.
 
 
The cost of URS and lithotripsy has decreased and has 
become more cost-effective over the last few years with 
more centers performing it  
[18] 
. Nevertheless, with a ris-
ing trend of urolithiasis, primary prevention seems to be 
more cost-effective for a national healthcare system and 
contributes to a significant cost saving and reduction in 
stone burden to society  
[19] 
.
 
Trends of Emergency Procedures for Urolithiasis 
 
The number of ureteroscopic stone procedures within 
England has increased significantly over this study period 
with an associated increase in emergency ureteroscopic 
procedures. This is likely to be as a result of an increase in 
the availability of equipment, access to laser machines 
and semi-rigid ureteroscopes, as well as access to time in 
the emergency theatre over the study period. Further-
more, there is increasing data to support the utilization of 
emergency URS; recently, it has been found to be feasible, 
safe and effective with a success rate of 72%  
[20] 
. It is 
therefore likely that emergency URS rates will continue 
to increase relative to SWL.
 
Trends in Length of Hospital Stay 
 
During the study period, the median LoS has demon-
strated a decreasing trend. However, despite the advance-
ments in PCNL technology, the median LoS has re-

mained, constantly, at 4 days since 2007/2008. With the 
aforementioned developments in PCNL technology and 
the increasing utilization of tubeless PCNL, this trend will 
hopefully fall. The increase in day-case URS, for both re-
nal and ureteric stones, was significant but not unexpect-
ed given the increased sub-specialization among the urol-
ogists. Despite this, only 21–22% of ureteroscopic proce-
dures are performed as a day-case. These proportions will 
hopefully increase over the next few years, especially as 
pressure on elective in-patient beds increase in the health-
care system.
 
Strengths of Our Study 
 
As with all databases, the quality of output is commen-
surate with the quality of data that has been inputted. In 
the past, criticism has been leveled at HES data in terms 
of its accuracy as it relies largely upon coding data, re-
corded from patient notes, by non-clinicians in NHS hos-
pitals, at the time of patient discharge  
[5] 
. Furthermore, 
a recent paper that investigated the accuracy of clinical 
coding for upper tract URS found that up to 55% of the 
coding data can be erroneous, with the particular error of 
renal URS being coded as ureteric URS  
[6] 
. In spite of this, 
a recent systematic review demonstrated a median accu-
racy of 84.2% for recorded procedure data within the HES 
database  
[7] 
. There is an increasing body of literature that 
interrogates HES data, with increasing degrees of com-
plexity, to offer a ‘
real world’
 insight into patient out-
comes rather than randomized controlled trials in spe-
cialized units  
[8] 
. HES data are also utilized by the Gov-
ernment to provide the basis for national indicators of 
clinical quality as well as to develop, monitor and evaluate 
government policy  
[9], 
 and therefore, are seen to hold 
significant importance.
 
Limitations of Our Study 
 
A limitation of the data available from HES is that only 
episodes of urolithiasis that required treatment by a hos-
pital consultant are included in the database. The num-
ber of patients managed conservatively by their general 
practitioners cannot be captured with this data set. It is 
therefore likely that overall prevalence rates of urolithia-
sis within the UK are higher than those reported in this 
paper. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the 
 
British Association of Urological Surgeons recently pub-
lished, online, PCNL data from the whole of the UK for 
2014  
[10] 
. On an estimated capture of 90% of PCNL data, 
they recorded 2,042 procedures throughout the UK from 
 
January 2014 to December 2014. Looking more closely at 
this data, only 56 procedures were performed outside of 
 
England giving a total of 1986 PCNLs within England 
during that time period. This finding gives further rise to 
concern as to the absolute accuracy in data capture with-
in the HES system. However, as the time periods studied 
between the 2 data sets are significantly disparate, it is 
difficult to make any meaningful conclusions between 
them.
 
Conclusion 
 
The HES data presented here demonstrate the increas-
ing prevalence and intervention of urolithiasis within 
England over the last 7 years. There is a rise in both elec-
tive and emergency urolithiasis interventions, with a ris-
ing trend for day-case URS. Similar trends are seen world-
wide, and future resource planning for primary and sec-
ondary intervention for urolithiasis is needed to match 
the increase in demand.
