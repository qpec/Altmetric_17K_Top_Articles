Abstract
Vitamin D, a fat-soluble prohormone, has wide-ranging roles in the regulation of many physiological processes
through their interactions with the vitamin D receptors (VDR). It plays a major role in bones and calcium
metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency is not uncommon and it has been associated with many health-related issues,
including skeletal and non-skeletal complications. The association of low vitamin D and cardiovascular diseases and
risk factors has been explored in both animal and human studies. However, studies and trials on the effect of
vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors and hypertension are conflicting with inconsistent results.
Therefore, large, well-powered randomized controlled trials are warranted. If successful, supplementation with easy
and low-cost vitamin D can impact our health positively. Here, we summarized the evidence for the association of
vitamin D, cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, including coronary artery diseases, stroke, and hypertension, and
mortality, with special consideration to resistant hypertension.

Background
Vitamin D is metabolized by hepatic 25-hydroxylase
then renal 1a-hydroxylase into its active form, calcitriol,
which exerts its function on the vitamin D receptor
(VDR) in nearly 30 different tissues [1]. Most of the
nutritional requirements of vitamin D are derived from
cutaneous solar ultraviolet radiation (80–100%) [2] and
to a lesser extent from foods naturally containing or
fortified with vitamin D [3]. The best measurement for
vitamin D status is its metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25[OH]D) level [1, 4].
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to several health
outcomes [5], including musculoskeletal (rickets, bone
fractures, osteomalacia, osteopenia, osteoporosis and
muscle weakness) [3] and non-skeletal complications [6].
Non-skeletal complications include cardiovascular dis-
eases and risk factors [7, 8] such as congestive heart
failure [9], impaired systolic and diastolic function [10],
myocardial infarction [11], peripheral vascular disease
[12], abdominal aortic aneurysm in older men [13], non-
valvular AF [14, 15] and hypertension [16]. In addition,
it was also associated with tuberculosis, rheumatoid
arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases,
cancers [1], schizophrenia [2], depression, cognitive defi-
cits [17], common obesity [18], non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease [19], cystic fibrosis [20], burn injuries [21], type
1 diabetes [4], type 2 diabetes [22, 23], insulin resistance
and metabolic syndrome [24–26].
In this narrative review, we aimed to summarize the
evidence for the association of vitamin D deficiency with
cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, including coron-
ary artery diseases, stroke, and hypertension.
Epidemiology
Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, the lowest vitamin
D levels are commonly found in regions such as the
Middle East and South Asia and the main risk factors
were attributed to elderly women, higher latitude, winter
season, less sunlight exposure, skin pigmentation, dietary
intake and low vitamin D fortified foods [27]. It was
estimated that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is
approximately 30–50% of the general population [28].
Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency is still common in
sunshine countries [29]. In a large Middle Eastern study
of 60,979 patients from 136 countries with yearlong

 sunlight, 82.5% of studied patients were found to have
vitamin D insufficiency [30].
There is an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency world-
wide, which represents a major factor of many chronic
diseases and has led some authors to suggest annual
vitamin D measurement coupled with adequate intake
and greater awareness of its consequences [4, 31]. In the
United States, there was an increasing prevalence of
vitamin D deficiency observed from a sample of 18,158
individuals between 1988 and 1994 compared with a
sample of 20,289 individuals between 2000 and 2004
with 5–9 nmol/l decrease in vitamin D levels [32].
Vitamin D levels were found to be lowest in Blacks,
followed by Hispanics and Chinese, and adequate in
Whites (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis MESA)
[33]. Another study done by Yetley in 2008 demonstrated
that non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans tend to
have lower levels of vitamin D in comparison with
non-Hispanic whites [34]. He also found vitamin D to be
significantly lower among obese and non-college educated
individuals, as well as those with poor health statuses,
hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein levels and low
milk consumption. Furthermore, the level of vitamin D
deficiency was found to be alarmingly lower in winter and
spring in a study done in British adults [35].
Vitamin D and cardiovascular diseases
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to several cardio-
vascular risk factors [36, 37]. Through increased renin
and angiotensin II synthesis, vitamin D deficiency can
increase the production of reactive oxygen species and
G protein RhoA, resulting in inhibition of the pathways
necessary for intracellular glucose transporter and thus
the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syn-
drome [25]. In addition, direct effects of vitamin D upon
smooth muscle calcification and proliferation could con-
tribute to their effects on cardiovascular health [38]. In
the Inter99 study of 6784 individuals, high vitamin D
level was associated with a favorable lipid profile and
lower incidence of metabolic syndrome [39].
Furthermore, in an analysis of NHANES III 1988–
1994, low vitamin D was associated with cardiovascular
disease (CVD) [7] and select CVD risk factors, including
diabetes
mellitus
(DM),
obesity,
and
hypertriglyc-
eridemia [24]. In a prospective nested case-control study
between 1993 and 1999 of 18,225 US men (Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study), low vitamin D was
associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction in
comparison with sufficient 25(OH)D after multivariate
adjustment [11]. Kim and colleagues have found a high
prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in individuals with car-
diovascular diseases, namely coronary heart disease and
heart failure, after controlling for age, race and gender,
using data from NHANES 2001–2004 [8].
Additional prospective study of the Integrated Inter-
mountain Healthcare system database of 41,504 patients
has shown an association between vitamin D deficiency
and an increase in the prevalence of DM, HTN, hyperlip-
idemia, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (P < 0.0001)
as well as with incident death, heart failure, coronary
artery disease/myocardial infarction, stroke and their com-
posite [40]. Also, low serum 25(OH)D was identified as
casually associated with increased risk for CVD on the
basis of Hill’s criteria for causality in a biological system
[41]. In a meta-analysis of 19 prospective studies in 65,994
participants, Wang et al. have demonstrated a linear and
inverse association between circulating vitamin D level
and risk of cardiovascular diseases [42].
Vitamin D deficiency and coronary artery disease
The association of vitamin D deficiency with coronary
artery diseases (CADs) have been investigated in many
studies [43–45]. In 1978, a Danish study found that low
vitamin D levels were significantly associated with an-
gina and myocardial infarction [46]. In a multicenter US
cohort study evaluating patients admitted with acute
coronary syndrome (ACS), about 95% of patients were
found to have low vitamin D levels [47]. In a study con-
ducted by Dziedzie et al., low vitamin D levels were ob-
served in patients with myocardial infarction history
[48]. In a case-control study (n = 240), Roy et al. re-
ported that severe vitamin D deficiency was associated
with increased risk of acute myocardial infarction after
adjusting for risk factors [49]. Similar findings were re-
ported from Health Professionals Follow-up Study which
included 18,225 participants. In this study, at 10-year
follow-up, participants with normal vitamin D level had
about half the risk of myocardial infarction [11]. In a
large prospective study (n = 10,170), low vitamin D levels
were found to be associated with increased risk of ische-
mic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and early death
during 9 years of follow-up [50]. Additionally, in a
meta-analysis of 18 studies, low vitamin D levels were
found to have an increased risk of ischemic heart disease
and early death [50].
Vitamin D and hypertension
Hypertension is the most common presentation to pri-
mary care providers [51] and represents a major chronic
health disease in developed countries [52]. The preva-
lence of hypertension in adults is approximately 29%
[53] with an estimated 1.6 billion cases of hypertension
expected in 2025 [54].
Pathophysiology
It is hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency increases
blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system.
Earlier animal studies demonstrated that vitamin D

 receptor-null
(VDR-null)
mice
have
a
several-fold
increase in renin expression and plasma angiotensin II
production, which leads to hypertension, cardiac hyper-
trophy and increased water intake. In addition, renin
suppression
was
observed
in
wild-type
mice
after
1,25(OH)2D3 injection. Therefore, 1,25(OH)2D3 was
considered a novel negative endocrine regulator of the
renin-angiotensin axis [55]. A later study showed pro-
found heart hypertrophy in vitamin D receptor knockout
(VDR-KO) mice, which suggested direct blunting of car-
diomyocyte hypertrophy by calcitriol [56]. Through a
central antioxidative mechanism, 1,25(OH)2D3 has nor-
malized overactivation of the central renin-angiotensin
system in 1-alpha-hydroxylase knockout mice [57]. Fur-
thermore, using mouse models, the elimination of VDR
in vascular endothelial cells resulted in a reduction of
endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and im-
paired endothelial relaxation [58].
In 2011, a study conducted by Argacha et al. revealed
that vitamin D-deficient male rats have increased systolic
blood pressure, superoxide anion production, angioten-
sin II and atrial natriuretic peptide with observed
changes in 51 cardiac gene expressions important in the
regulation of oxidative stress and myocardial hyper-
trophy [59]. Also, another study of vitamin D-deficient
mice showed increased systolic blood pressure, diastolic
blood pressure, high plasma renin-angiotensin activity
and reduced urinary sodium excretion, which was re-
versed after 6 weeks of a vitamin D-sufficient chow diet
[60]. In the same study, vitamin D-deficient mice on a
high-fat diet had increased atherosclerosis in their aorta
with increased macrophage infiltration, fat deposition,
and endoplasmic reticulum stress activation. These re-
sults indicate vitamin D deficiency is associated with the
development of hypertension and accelerated athero-
sclerosis [60]. In another study on double-transgenic
rats, vitamin D-depleted rats were shown to exacerbate
hypertension (HTN) and impact the renin-angiotensin
system, which can contribute to end-organ damage [61].
For the first time in humans, a prospective cohort
study
of
3316
patients
(1997–2000)
in
southwest
Ludwigshafen (Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular
Health LURIC Study) showed a steady increase of
plasma renin concentration with declining levels of
25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, as well as a similar increase
in angiotensin 2 [62]. Another study showed increased
renin-angiotensin system activity in obese hypertensive
individuals with low 25(OH)D [63]. Furthermore, an-
other study, which included 375 hypertensive and 146
normotensive individuals, showed that genetic variation
at the Fok1 polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor
gene and 25(OH)D levels were associated with plasma
renin activity in hypertension, a finding that supports
the vitamin D-VDR complex as a renin regulator in
humans [64]. Therefore, vitamin D analogs have been
suggested to be used as renin inhibitors similar to ACE
inhibitors and ARBs for patients with hyperreninemia,
which can benefit patients with metabolic syndrome
and/or hypertension [25]. Other mechanisms that can
lead to hypertension in vitamin D-deficient patients are
arterial stiffness [65, 66], endothelial dysfunction [67],
and hyperparathyroidism [68].
Studies regarding vitamin D and hypertension
There is accumulating evidence for the association
between vitamin D and blood pressure. An earlier ana-
lysis of NHANES III 1988–1994 of 12,644 participants
aged > 20 years showed an inverse association between
vitamin D level and blood pressure [69]. Similar results were
obtained from analysis of NHANES 2003–2006 of 7228 par-
ticipants [70], the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Family
Study (IReSFS) [71], and the Kaiser Permanente Southern
California health plan [72].
Forman and colleagues have also demonstrated an in-
verse association between vitamin D and risk of incident
hypertension from two prospective cohort studies in-
cluding 613 (followed for 4–8 years) and 38,388 (followed
for 16–18 years) men from the Health Professionals’
Follow-Up Study and 1198 (followed for 4–8 years) and
77,531 (followed for 16–18 years) women from the Nurses’
Health Study. Their results, combining men and women
with measured 25(OH)D levels, showed a pooled relative
risk of 3.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39–7.29) [73].
Worldwide studies have also demonstrated such an as-
sociation. In a cross-sectional study of 833 Caucasian
males in Uppsala (central Sweden), a threefold higher
prevalence of confirmed hypertension was found in
participants with 25(OH)D levels < 37.5 nmol/L [74].
Additionally, a cross-sectional analysis of 1460 partici-
pants in Shanghai showed high prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency (55.8%) in middle-aged and elderly Chinese
men [75]. In adolescents (aged 13–15), a study of 1441
Peruvians
showed
an
inverse
association
between
vitamin D deficiency and blood pressure, which may
predispose risk of HTN later in adulthood [76].
Vitamin D and aging related cardiovascular disease and
hypertension
Older adults are at increased risk for vitamin D defi-
ciency, largely due to reduced vitamin D intake and de-
creased cutaneous synthesis [77, 78]. Beyond skeletal
health, accumulated evidence has linked vitamin D defi-
ciency to cardiovascular diseases and hypertension in
older patients. Advancing age is associated with in-
creased cardiovascular diseases due to vascular endothe-
lial dysfunction as indicated by decreased peripheral
arterial
endothelium-dependent
dilatation
[79].
The
mechanisms underpinning this association have been
Kheiri et al. Clinical Hypertension  (2018) 24:9 
Page 3 of 9
 attributed mainly to the reductions in nitric oxide syn-
thesis and increases in oxidative stress with aging [79].
Furthermore, advancing age is associated with reduced
blood vessels walls compliance and increased incidence
of hypertension [80]. Vitamin D deficiency has been
found to modulate the vascular endothelial function with
aging [79] and, therefore, increase the incidence of hyper-
tension. In a study conducted by Kestenbaum et al., 2312
older participants (≥ 65 years) without cardiovascular dis-
ease at baseline were followed for a median period of
14 years [81]. Their results showed that low 25(OH)D was
associated with incident cardiovascular disease and mor-
tality. Furthermore, in a cross-sectional study conducted
by Dorjgochoo et al., low 25(OH)D levels were associated
with hypertension among older adults [75].
Vitamin D and resistant hypertension
Resistant hypertension is an increasingly common health
problem and considered as a strong risk factor cardio-
vascular disease [82]. It is defined as any blood pressure
above the target despite adherence to three antihyper-
tensive agents, including a diuretic, with optimal doses
or the use of at least four antihypertensive agents re-
gardless of the blood pressure level [83, 84]. Over the
past 2 decades, the prevalence of resistant hypertension
has almost doubled from 5.5% in 1988–1994 to 11.8% in
2005–2008 [82]. Many factors have been attributed to
resistant hypertension such as obesity and excessive
adipose tissue as well as hyperaldosteronism [85]. Low
vitamin
D
was
linked
to
resistant
hypertension
secondary to increased adiposity and metabolic distur-
bances, including insulin resistance [86]. Furthermore,
vitamin D deficiency was found to be associated with in-
creased aldosterone levels [87].
Several studies have demonstrated the relation be-
tween vitamin D and resistant hypertension. In a study
of 150 patients, lower vitamin D level was associated
with resistant hypertension [88]. Additionally, in a study
of patients with resistant hypertension (N = 101) who
underwent renal sympathetic denervation (RD), low vita-
min D was associated with a decreased systolic blood
pressure response to RD [89].
Vitamin D and cerebrovascular accident
Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is the most devastating
neurological conditions which can cause physical impair-
ment and even death. Accumulating evidence suggests
that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased
risk of CVA [90]. The underlining mechanisms have
been largely attributed to the association of vitamin D
with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension
and DM. In addition, epidemiological studies have sug-
gested that vitamin D deficiency is an independent risk
factor for CVA [42]. In a study conducted by Sun et al.
(n = 464), low vitamin D levels were associated with in-
creased risk of developing CVA in comparison with high
levels [91]. In the Reasons for Geographic and Racial
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, vitamin D defi-
ciency was found to be a risk factor for incident CVA
unrelated to race [92]. Furthermore, vitamin D level was
found to be a predictor of both severity at admission
and favorable functional outcome in patients with ische-
mic CVA [90].
Vitamin D and mortality
In a prospective cohort study of 3258 patients in south-
west Germany (Cardiac Center Ludwigshafen) with a
median follow-up of 7.7 years showed that low vitamin
D level is independently associated with higher all-cause
mortality (HR 2.08; 95% CI 1.60–2.70) and cardio-
vascular mortality (HR 2.22; 95% CI 1.57–3.13) [93].
Additionally, in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult
Men of 1194 elderly men, both low and high serum
25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of
overall and cancer mortality, however, only low level was
associated with cardiovascular mortality [94]. In Finland,
a study of 1136 participants from Kuopio Ischaemic
Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study showed that
vitamin D deficiency was associated with a higher risk of
death [95].
The rate of all-cause mortality of 13,331 adults > 19 years
from the NHANES III Linked Mortality Files (1988–994)
was independently higher by 26% for individuals with low
vitamin D levels (25[OH]D < 17.8 ng/ml) compared to the
highest quartile [96]. Additionally, in a sample of 3408
individuals aged > 64, low baseline 25(OH)D levels were
associated with increased all-cause mortality risk after
adjusting for demographics, season, and cardiovascular
risk factors (hazard ratio 0.95; 95% CI 0.92–0.98, per
10 nmol/L 25[OH]D) [97]. A similar result was obtained
from NHANES 2001–2004 analysis with an increase in
all-cause and CVD mortality [98, 99]. A large meta-ana-
lysis of 8 prospective cohort studies across the US and
Europe
of
26,018
individuals
showed
a
remarkable
consistency of the association between 25(OH)D level and
all-cause and cause-specific mortality [100]. Additionally,
a meta-analysis found a nonlinear decrease in mortality
with increasing 25(OH)D levels in 14 prospective cohort
studies (n = 62,548) [101].
Management
Vitamin D supplementation
Multiple studies were done to evaluate the effect of
Vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular disease
and mortality. In a randomized clinical trial of 5108
community-residents adults aged 50–84 year, monthly
high-dose vitamin D supplementation (100,000 IU) did
not prevent cardiovascular disease compared with placebo
Kheiri et al. Clinical Hypertension  (2018) 24:9 
Page 4 of 9
 [102]. Furthermore, the EVITA (Effect of Vitamin D on
All-cause Mortality in Heart Failure) randomized trial, did
not show a reduction of mortality in patients with ad-
vanced heart failure received a daily vitamin D of 4000 IU
compared with placebo [103]. Also, in a systematic review
and meta-analysis of 18 trials and 13 observational studies,
there were uncertain associations between vitamin D
status and cardiometabolic outcomes [104]. In addition,
another meta-analysis by Wang et al. showed a linear in-
verse association between 25(OH)D and risk of CVD
[105]. While Ford et al.’s meta-analysis showed some bene-
fits of vitamin D supplementation on cardiac failure, it did
not show benefits on myocardial infarction/stroke [106].
With the proven association between vitamin D and
hypertension, several studies were conducted to see
whether vitamin D supplementation would help in treat-
ing hypertension. However, these studies resulted in dif-
ferent outcomes and recommendations. Some studies
have shown some beneficial outcomes with vitamin D
supplementation in reducing blood pressure in patients
with low baseline vitamin D levels [39, 106–109]. In a
study of 112 patients conducted in Denmark, a 20 weeks’
supply of 3000 IU cholecalciferol in winter resulted in a
nonsignificant reduction of 3/1 mmHg (P 0.26/0.18),
however, significant results were obtained in patients
with low baseline 25(OH)D (< 32 ng/ml) of 4/3 mmHg
(P 0.05/0.01) [108]. Another study targeted females over
69 years old showed the benefit of 8 weeks’ supplemen-
tation of vitamin D3 (800 IU) and calcium (1200 mg) on
systolic blood pressure by a 5 mmHg or more decrease
in SBP in 60 subjects (81%) (P = 0.04) [107]. In a ran-
domized controlled trial of 283 African Americans be-
tween 2008 and 2010 showed for each 1 ng/ml increase
in 25(OH)D there was a 0.2 mmHg reduction in SBP
(P = 0.02)
after 3 months’ supplementation of (doses
1000, 2000 or 4000 IU) cholecalciferol [106]. On the other
hand, some studies did not show any reduction in blood
pressure with vitamin D supplementation [110–112]. As
we see in a randomized controlled trial of 161 predomin-
ately white individuals, large doses of vitamin D3 (200,000
for 2 months then 100,000 monthly) up to 18 months
showed no effect on BP [111]. Also, the DAYLIGHT ran-
domized controlled trial showed no benefit of vitamin D
supplementation on BP [112]. A similar result was found
in Austria in the Styrian Vitamin D Hypertension Trial
(2011–2014) of 200 participants after 8 weeks of vitamin
D3 2800 IU [110].
Therefore, multiple meta-analyses were conducted to
study the benefit of replacing vitamin D in hypertensive
patients. But again, these meta-analyses also had mixed
results. Beveridge et al. did a meta-analysis of 46 trials
and concluded there was no effect of vitamin D supple-
mentation on blood pressure [113]. A meta-analysis
done by Wu et al. of 8 randomized controlled trials
studying the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplemen-
tation on blood pressure showed no meaningful effect
on daytime office BP [114]. Furthermore, two systemic
reviews and meta-analyses attributed the inconsistency
in evidence regarding vitamin D supplementation’s effect
on blood pressure to the heterogeneity in study design
[115, 116]. However, in a mendelian randomization
study, Vimaleswaran et al. have found a genetic evidence
that increased vitamin D concentrations are causally as-
sociated with reduced blood pressure and the risk of
hypertension [117].
With regards to the efficacy of vitamin D supplemen-
tation on reducing CVA, available evidence are conflict-
ing [118]. However, in a recent small scale randomized
clinical trial, a single dose of 6 lac IU of Cholecalciferol
Intramuscular (IM) injection was associated with a sig-
nificant improvement in the stroke outcome after three
months [119]. We hope that the ongoing Vitamin D and
Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) would shed some light on the
role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing cardio-
vascular events, including CVA [120, 121].
With the above mentioned evidence, the inconsisten-
cies between those studies could be due to the differ-
ences in vitamin D preparations, follow-up length,
patient compliance with the medications, differences in
study populations’ baseline characteristics, sample size
and the metabolic heterogeneity among the included
patients [122]. So, there is a worldwide call for a larger
randomized control trial [12, 123–136].
Conclusions
With high prevalence globally, vitamin D deficiency is
not uncommon. It is associated with adverse health-re-
lated problems. Current evidence suggests a higher risk
of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors with lower
vitamin D levels. Furthermore, low vitamin D is associ-
ated with hypertension and higher cardiovascular and
all-cause mortality. The benefit of vitamin D supplemen-
tation to ameliorate the major adverse cardiovascular
diseases and hypertension are conflicting with many
confounding biases. Therefore, larger randomized clin-
ical trials are warranted to explore the benefits of
vitamin D supplementation, which would at least reduce
the impact of such high health problems.
