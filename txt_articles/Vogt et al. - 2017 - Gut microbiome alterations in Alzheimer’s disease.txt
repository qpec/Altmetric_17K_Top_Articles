Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. However, the etiopathogenesis of this 
devastating disease is not fully understood. Recent studies in rodents suggest that alterations in the 
gut microbiome may contribute to amyloid deposition, yet the microbial communities associated with 
AD have not been characterized in humans. Towards this end, we characterized the bacterial taxonomic 
composition of fecal samples from participants with and without a diagnosis of dementia due to AD. Our 
analyses revealed that the gut microbiome of AD participants has decreased microbial diversity and is 
compositionally distinct from control age- and sex-matched individuals. We identified phylum- through 
genus-wide differences in bacterial abundance including decreased Firmicutes, increased Bacteroidetes, 
and decreased Bifidobacterium in the microbiome of AD participants. Furthermore, we observed 
correlations between levels of differentially abundant genera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers 
of AD. These findings add AD to the growing list of diseases associated with gut microbial alterations, as 
well as suggest that gut bacterial communities may be a target for therapeutic intervention.
Despite decades of research, the etiology underlying the development of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD) remains unknown, and there are currently no preventative or disease-modifying treatments available. In 
the brain, AD pathology is characterized by extracellular plaques composed of amyloid-β
 (Aβ
) peptide and intra-
cellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein1. However, what causes these hall-
mark features is unexplained. In recent years, researchers have proposed a potential role for pathogenic microbes, 
including those derived from the gut, in the development or exacerbation of AD pathology2–5.
Humans harbor complex communities of microbes, with the vast majority of the microbial population resid-
ing in the distal gut. Gut microbes perform key functions for human health including energy extraction, biosyn-
thesis of vitamins, protection against pathogen overgrowth, and education of the immune system6. Microbial 
colonization of the gut occurs during birth, is highly dynamic through infancy, and resembles adult structure 
by about 3 years of age7. Thereafter, the composition of the microbiome within an individual remains generally 
stable8, albeit with substantial interpersonal variation, particularly in elderly individuals9.
Alterations in the composition of this complex ecosystem have been associated with the development of a 
variety of gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, diabetes, 
and insulin resistance10. More recently, the influence of gut microbiota on central nervous system function – 
often referred to as the gut-brain axis – has received significant attention, and alterations in the gut microbiome 
have been associated with neurological conditions including autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, and 
Parkinson’s disease11–13.
With respect to dementia, a recent study in cognitively impaired elderly participants investigated a limited 
number of pro- and anti-inflammatory gut bacterial taxa and found altered abundance in individuals with

positive amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging14. In addition, recent studies in transgenic mouse 
models of AD have demonstrated that manipulating gut microbiota can influence cerebral amyloid deposi-
tion15,16. However, to date there have been no comprehensive surveys of whole gut microbiota in humans with 
AD. In this study, we performed bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of DNA isolated from 
fecal samples in order to characterize the gut microbial communities in individuals with and without a clinical 
diagnosis of dementia due to AD. In addition, we examined the relationship between gut microbiota and AD 
pathology as measured by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD.
Results
Study Design and Participant Characteristics. 
Participants were recruited from the Wisconsin 
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) 
study (see Methods). Gut microbiome compositional analysis was performed on fecal samples collected from 
home-dwelling participants with dementia due to AD (n = 25), and age- and sex-matched Control participants 
(n = 25). Table 1 reports participant characteristics. AD and Control groups did not differ with respect to age, 
sex, ethnicity, BMI, or diabetes status. There was no difference between groups in total score on a 15-item food 
questionnaire based on the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) Diet17, 
which provided a semi-quantitative measure of dietary intake and allowed us to asses dietary differences. As 
expected, the APOE ε
4 genotype was more prevalent in the AD group. The majority of AD participants had very 
mild or mild dementia, with clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores ranging from 0.5–2. Medication information 
is reported in Supplementary Table S1. The AD group had a greater number of participants taking selective ser-
otonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and all but one AD participant was taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor 
(donepezil or rivastigmine) and/or memantine.
Composition of the Gut Microbiome of Control and AD Groups. 
Sequencing of the V4 region of 
the 16S rRNA gene generated a total of 4.8 million sequence reads (mean ± SD: ~96,000 ± 32,000 reads/par-
ticipant), which were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity and assigned taxo-
nomic classifications down to the lowest phylogenetic level possible (see Methods). The final OTU dataset for 
AD and Control groups consisted of 972 OTUs classified to 95 genera, 46 families, 24 orders, 17 classes, and 9 
phyla. Between groups, there were no differences in percentages of sequences classified to the phylum (Control: 
99.6 ± 0.5%, AD: 99.6 ± 0.9%) or genus level (Control: 79.6 ± 7.4%, AD: 83.1 ± 8.1%). Across all 50 participants, 
the dominant phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, which respectively made up 78% (78.1 ± 8.7%) and 15% 
(14.9 ± 8.4%) of total abundance, with lower contributions from Actinobacteria (2.6%), Verrucomicrobia (2.6%), 
and Proteobacteria (1.1%) (Supplementary Fig. S1). The predominant bacterial families for all participants were 
Lachnospiraceae (39.1%), Ruminococcaceae (29.6%), and Bacteroidaceae (9.8%), followed by Verrucomicrobiaceae 
(2.6%), Clostridiales (1.9%), and Bifidobacteriaceae (1.5%) (Supplementary Fig. S1).
AD is Associated with Changes in the Gut Microbiome. 
The composition of the gut microbiome was 
characterized using traditional ecological measures including richness (the number of unique OTUs present in 
a participant), alpha diversity (the richness and abundance of OTUs within each participant), and beta diversity 
(the similarity or difference in composition between participants). For microbiome richness estimates, we used 
the Abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) and Chao1; these metrics use non-parametric modeling to cal-
culate a conservative estimate of total OTU richness for each participant. The microbiome of AD participants had 
reduced richness, with both ACE and Chao1 significantly decreased in the AD group compared to the Control 
group (t-test; ACE: DF = 48, t = 3.05, p = 0.004; Chao1: DF = 48, t = 2.98, p = 0.004) (Supplementary Fig. S2). For 
alpha diversity metrics, we used the Inverse Simpson and Shannon Indexes, and Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity 
(PD), an alpha diversity metric that also incorporates phylogenetic relationships. While there was a trend towards 
a decrease in the Inverse Simpson Index between Control and AD groups (Mann-Whitney; U = 227.0, p = 0.097),

both the Shannon Index and Faith’s PD were significantly decreased in AD participants compared to Control par-
ticipants (t-test; Shannon: DF = 48, t = 2.44, p = 0.019, PD: DF = 48, t = 2.59, p = 0.013) (Fig. 1A, Supplementary 
Fig. S2). With respect to beta diversity, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and UniFrac analysis (weighted and unweighted) 
demonstrated compositional differences in the microbiome between AD and Control groups (PERMANOVA, 
Bray-Curtis: F = 2.87, p < 0.001, weighted UniFrac: F = 3.84, p < 0.001; unweighted UniFrac: F = 2.60, p < 0.005) 
(Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S3).
Differential abundance analysis of taxa at the OTU level revealed that the microbiome of AD participants 
showed significantly altered abundance of 82 OTUs relative to the Control group, with 14 OTUs more abundant 
and 68 OTUs less abundant in AD (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Table S2). Plotting these 82 OTUs as a phylogenetic 
tree-ordered and diagnosis-grouped heat map shows clear differences in OTU abundance distributions between 
Control and AD groups (Supplementary Fig. S4).
OTUs were taxonomically grouped and differential abundance was analyzed at the phylum, family, and genus 
levels using Metastats (Supplementary Table S3). At the phylum level, AD participants had decreased abun-
dance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and increased abundance of Bacteroidetes compared to Control par-
ticipants (Fig. 1D). Within Firmicutes, the families Ruminococcaceae, Turicibacteraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, 
Clostridiaceae, and Mogibacteriaceae, and the genera SMB53 (family Clostridiaceae), Dialister, Clostridium, 
Turicibacter, and cc115 (family Erysipelotrichaceae) were all less abundant in AD participants, while the family 
Gemellaceae and the genera Blautia, Phascolarctobacterium, and Gemella were more abundant in AD participants 
(Fig. 2). Within Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae at the family level, and Bacteroides and Alistipes 
at the genus level were more abundant in AD participants. The decrease in Actinobacteria was reflected by 
decreased Bifidobacteriaceae at the family level and by decreased Bifidobacterium and Adlercreutzia at the genus 
level. Additionally, the genus Bilophila in the phylum Proteobacteria was more abundant in AD participants.
Predictive metagenomics analysis (PICRUSt18) identified potential functional changes in the gut microbiome 
of AD participants. These include increases in predicted gene content in KEGG pathways related to metabolism 
and biosynthesis, including oxidative phosphorylation, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism 
(Supplementary Fig. S5), and decreases in predicted gene content in KEGG pathways related to signal transduc-
tion and cell motility, including bacterial chemotaxis pathways, secretion systems, bacterial motility proteins, and 
two-component signal transduction systems.

Differentially Abundant Genera Are Correlated with CSF Biomarkers of AD Pathology. 
Our 
primary microbiome compositional analysis identified 13 genera as differentially abundant between AD and 
Control groups. We next examined the relationship between the relative abundance of these 13 taxa and levels 
of CSF biomarkers in a subset of participants who had also undergone lumbar puncture. This analysis included 
microbiome and CSF data from 9 AD group participants, and 31 non-demented (ND) participants (10 from the 
Control group, and an additional 21 largely younger participants not selected in the original random matching 
with AD participants). Correlations were calculated using data from the total group of 40 participants, as well 
as separately for ND participants and AD participants. CSF biomarkers included Aβ
42/Aβ
40, phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau), the ratio of p-tau/Aβ
42, and chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40). CSF Aβ
42/Aβ
40 is an indicator of amy-
loid burden, with lower levels in the CSF reflecting greater amyloid deposition in the brain; p-tau is a marker of 
neurofibrillary tangles, with higher levels reflecting greater tangle pathology in the brain; the ratio of p-tau/Aβ
42 
incorporates both aspects of pathology, with higher values implying greater AD pathology19. YKL-40 is a marker 
of astroglial and/or microglial activation, and has been shown to be elevated in CSF of individuals with dementia 
due to AD20–22. Supplementary Table S4 reports participant characteristics, CSF biomarker levels, and relative 
abundances of genera.
Across all 40 participants included in this analysis, we observed generally consistent trends between bacterial 
relative abundance and CSF biomarkers of AD pathology (Fig. 3). The direction of these trends was largely similar

for both AD participants and healthy non-demented participants. For genera that are more abundant in AD, we 
observed a relationship between increased bacterial abundance and greater AD pathology, which was indicated 
by predominantly negative correlations between bacterial abundance and CSF Aβ
42/Aβ
40 (suggesting greater 
abundance is associated with greater amyloid burden in the brain), and predominantly positive correlations 
between bacterial abundance and CSF p-tau and p-tau/Aβ
42. These relationships were especially strong in those 
genera with overall greater relative abundance, particularly in Bacteroides and Blautia. Similarly, for those genera 
that are less abundant in AD, we observed a relationship between decreased bacterial abundance and greater 
AD pathology, with levels of SMB53 and Dialister showing the strongest correlations with CSF AD biomarkers. 
Notably, in both more and less abundant genera, the strongest correlations between bacterial abundance and CSF 
AD biomarkers were in the same direction whether including only AD participants, only healthy non-demented 
participants, or all participants. Additionally, in AD participants, we observed a relationship between increased 
abundance of Bacteroides and increased CSF YKL-40 levels, and a relationship between decreased abundance of 
both Turicibacter and SMB53 and increased CSF YKL-40 levels (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Discussion
Despite the proposed role of gut microbiota in the development or progression of AD4,5,23, there have been no 
comprehensive surveys of the gut microbiome in individuals with AD. In this study, we performed bacterial 
16S rRNA gene sequencing on DNA isolated from fecal samples in order to compare the composition of the gut 
microbiome in participants with and without a diagnosis of dementia due to AD. We discovered that the gut 
microbiome of AD participants has decreased microbial richness and diversity and a distinct composition com-
pared to asymptomatic age- and sex-matched Control participants. We also identified several broad taxonomic 
differences between AD and Control groups, and determined that levels of differentially abundant genera corre-
late with CSF biomarkers of AD pathology.
The decreased richness and diversity in our study broadly parallels results observed in other conditions linked 
to gut microbiome alterations, including obesity, diabetes, IBD, and Parkinson’s disease13,24–26. Furthermore, 
PICRUst analysis revealed broad functional changes in predicted metabolism, bacterial cell motility, and signal 
transduction pathways in the gut microbiome of AD participants. While the specific bacteria responsible for

Figure 3. Bacterial taxa correlate with CSF biomarkers of AD pathology. 13 genera identified as differentially 
abundant in AD were correlated with CSF biomarkers of AD including the Aβ
42/Aβ
40 ratio (with lower CSF 
levels reflecting greater amyloid deposition in the brain), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and the p-tau/Aβ
42 ratio 
(which incorporates both facets of AD pathology). Correlations were calculated separately for all 40 participants 
(All), 31 non-demented participants (ND), and 9 AD participants (AD). In general, genera identified as more 
abundant in AD were associated with greater AD pathology, while genera identified as less abundant in AD 
were associated with less AD pathology. Genera are ordered from most to least abundant. Shape and color of 
ellipses represent strength of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (rho). Bolded ellipse borders represent 
significant correlations (two-sided, p < 0.05 uncorrected).

these compositional and functional alterations may differ between conditions, it has been proposed that these 
broad-scale changes in gut microbiota (often referred to as “dysbiosis”) may play important roles in disease 
progression and maintenance, potentially through immune activation and systemic inflammation27. While it is 
unclear how the gut influences the development of neuropathology, substantial evidence supports the existence 
of a gut-brain axis that allows bi-directional communication between the gut and brain through several pathways 
including neural, endocrine, and immune mechanisms11,28. Within this framework, alterations in gut micro-
bial communities in patients with AD may result in pathophysiological changes in the brain. In support of this 
hypothesis, a recent study showed that transgenic AD mice raised under germ-free conditions have less cerebral 
amyloid deposition than conventionally-raised AD mice, indicating that gut microbiota influence the develop-
ment of amyloid pathology16.
In our study, the phylum Firmicutes as a whole, as well as several families, genera, and 61 OTUs classified 
within Firmicutes were decreased in the AD group. A reduction in Firmicutes has been reported in the microbi-
ome of individuals with type 2 diabetes25 as well as obesity29 (although others have reported increased Firmicutes 
in obesity24,30). Notably, diabetes and insulin resistance increase the risk of developing AD31–33. We have recently 
reported that insulin resistance is associated with decreased cerebral glucose metabolism and increased amyloid 
deposition in asymptomatic middle-aged adults enriched for risk of AD34,35. Thus, a potential mechanism by 
which microbial alterations in the gut may influence AD pathology is through promoting the development of 
insulin resistance and diabetes. While AD and Control groups did not differ with respect to diabetes prevalence 
(Table 1), sub-clinical differences in insulin or glucose metabolism cannot be ruled out. Further investigation will 
be needed to explore the relationship between microbiota and insulin resistance in AD.
In participants with AD, we observed an increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes, which was reflected by 
increased Bacteroidaceae at the family level, and increased Bacteroides at the OTU and genus level. The phylum 
Bacteroidetes encompasses a diverse and abundant group of gram-negative commensal bacteria in the gut36, 
including the genus Bacteroides, which has been detected at higher levels in the gut of individuals with type 2 
diabetes25 and in patients with Parkinson’s disease13, a neurodegenerative disorder. The major outer membrane 
component of gram-negative bacteria is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is capable of triggering systemic inflam-
mation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines after translocation from the gut to systemic circulation37. 
Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated an association between bacterial endotoxins (e.g. 
LPS) and AD pathology. Co-incubation of Aβ
 peptide with LPS potentiates amyloid fibrillogenesis38, and sys-
temic injection of LPS in wild-type and transgenic AD mice results in greater amyloid deposition and tau pathol-
ogy39–42. In humans, intestinal permeability increases with age43, and elderly individuals show an association 
between increased LPS-binding protein (a marker of microbial translocation) and inflammation44. Moreover, a 
recent study involving postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD showed that LPS and gram-negative E. 
coli fragments co-localize with amyloid plaques45. Thus, increased abundance of gram-negative intestinal bac-
teria such as Bacteroides in participants with AD may result in increased translocation of LPS from the gut to 
systemic circulation, which in turn may contribute to or exacerbate AD pathology through inflammation or other 
mechanisms.
Additionally, compared to control participants, AD participants in our study exhibited decreased 
Actinobacteria. These differences were mostly driven by changes in Bifidobacterium. Actinobacteria, particularly 
members of the Bifidobacterium genus, are an important bacterial inhabitant of the human gut across the lifespan, 
and their beneficial health effects have been well-documented46,47. In particular, certain species of Bifidobacterium 
are associated with anti-inflammatory properties and decreased intestinal permeability48. Additionally, supple-
mentation with Bifidobacterium has been shown to decrease LPS levels in the intestine and improve gut mucosal 
barrier properties in mice49,50. Interestingly, in germ-free mice colonized with human gut microbiota, increased 
levels of Bifidobacterium are associated with decreased bacterial translocation to systemic circulation, while 
increased levels of Bacteroides have been shown to increase bacterial translocation51. Considering our present 
findings, increased Bacteroides and decreased Bifidobacterium in AD participants may represent a gut microbial 
phenotype with particular propensity for translocation of pro-inflammatory bacterial components. Furthermore, 
several Bifidobacterium species are widely used as probiotics. A small study of probiotics that included 
Bifidobacterium demonstrated a change in Mini-Mental State Examination scores after a 12-week intervention 
among participants with severe dementia52. Taken together with the decreased abundance of Bifidobacterium in 
AD participants observed in our study, larger trials may be warranted, particularly in earlier disease stages.
Finally, we observed correlations between levels of differentially abundant gut microbiota and CSF biomarkers 
of AD pathology in a subset of participants that had also undergone lumbar puncture. In general, genera identi-
fied as more abundant in AD were associated with greater AD pathology while genera identified as less abundant 
in AD were associated with less AD pathology. These effects were most prominent when examining CSF p-tau/
Aβ
42, a composite measure of AD pathology. Interestingly, even among non-demented participants who had 
undergone lumbar puncture, we found a relationship between genera that were either more or less abundant 
in AD and markers of amyloid and tau protein, even in the absence of dementia. In particular, Dialister and 
SMB53 showed the strongest correlations in non-demented participants, with greater abundance of these bacte-
ria associated with less AD pathology, suggesting these bacterial taxa may be protective against development or 
progression of AD pathology. We also observed significant associations in AD participants between CSF YKL-40 
and abundance of Bacteroides, Turicibacter, and SMB53 (family Clostridiaceae). While these findings support a 
link between altered gut bacterial abundance and glial activation in AD, this relationship is less clear in healthy 
non-demented individuals and requires further investigation.
A limited number of studies have attempted to address the role of gut microbiota in AD. A recent inves-
tigation in cognitively-impaired older adults (without an AD diagnosis) reported increased abundance of the 
pro-inflammatory bacteria Escherichia/Shigella and decreased abundance of the anti-inflammatory bacteria 
Eubacterium rectale in individuals with evidence of amyloid deposition on PET imaging compared to individuals

who were amyloid negative14. While those results support a link between gut microbiota and brain amyloidosis, 
the study only investigated the abundance of six pre-selected bacterial taxa using quantitative PCR rather than 
the broader approach used here. Additionally, in a recent AD mouse microbiome study using 16S rRNA sequenc-
ing, APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed increased Helicobacteraceae and Desulfovibrionaceae at the family level, 
increased Odoribacter and Helicobacter, and decreased Prevotella compared to wild-type mice53. However, while 
the anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and mice share many characteristics54, there 
are also substantial differences with respect to resident bacterial communities30, which makes comparing taxa and 
changes in abundance between these studies difficult.
While AD participants were well-matched to our Control participants (suggesting that the gut microbiome 
differences we observed were not likely the result of age, sex, BMI, or dietary differences between groups), they 
did differ with respect to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and AD medications. We did 
not find differences in microbial richness, diversity, or relative abundance of the 13 genera identified as altered 
in AD between AD participants taking SSRIs and AD participants not taking SSRIs (Supplementary Table S5), 
suggesting that these medications are not influencing our results. Nearly all AD participants in our study were 
taking the AD medications donepezil or rivastigmine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors), and/or memantine (an 
NMDA receptor antagonist). It is unknown how these medications affect the gut microbiome. The most common 
side effects reported for acetylcholine esterase inhibitors are gastrointestinal upset55, both nausea and diarrhea, 
which could influence microbiota composition. It is worth noting that our participants did not report chronic 
constipation or diarrhea, and there was no difference between groups on the Bristol stool scale (Table 1), which 
can be used as a surrogate for stool transit time. Still, we recognize that we cannot completely rule out the effect 
of AD medication use on our results. Further work, including animal experiments and longitudinal human stud-
ies, will be needed to determine the cause-effect relationship between gut microbiota and pathogenesis of AD. 
Determining the role of gut bacteria in the progression or maintenance of AD may lead to novel interventional 
approaches that alter or restore healthy gut bacterial composition, or identification of microbial metabolites that 
are protective against AD.
Methods
Participants. 
Participants with dementia due to AD (n = 25) were recruited from the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s 
Disease Research Center (ADRC). Non-demented participants (n = 94) were recruited from both the ADRC and 
the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) study56. The University of Wisconsin Health Science 
Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures, and all experiments were performed in accordance 
with relevant guidelines and regulations. All participants provided written informed consent to be involved in 
this study.
Exclusion criteria for this study included any significant neurologic disease, history of alcohol/substance 
dependence, major psychiatric disorders (including major depression), or any other significant medical illness. 
Microbiome-specific exclusion criteria included: the use of systemic antibiotics in the previous 6 months prior 
to providing the fecal sample; corticosteroid use (oral, IV, nasal, or inhaled); immune stimulating medications; 
immunosuppressive agents; large doses of commercial probiotics consumed (greater than or equal to 108 cfu 
or organisms per day); major dietary change during previous month (defined as eliminating or significantly 
increasing a major food group); major GI tract surgery in past 5 years (with the exception of cholecystectomy 
and appendectomy); major bowel resection at any time; active uncontrolled GI disorders or diseases including 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), indeterminate colitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), persistent, infectious 
gastroenteritis, colitis or gastritis, persistent or chronic diarrhea of unknown etiology, Clostridium difficile infec-
tion (recurrent) or Helicobacter pylori infection (untreated), or chronic constipation.
At the time of fecal sample collection, participants completed a short questionnaire regarding recent antibi-
otic or probiotic use, as well as current and past gastrointestinal/metabolic conditions. Additionally, participants 
also completed a 15-item self-report diet questionnaire developed by Martha Clare Morris (Rush University) 
and based on the MIND Diet17, which allowed us to assess dietary differences between groups. We also used 
information/data collected from participants at annual and bi-annual ADRC and WRAP study visits including 
medication use, medical conditions/diagnoses, clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores, and CSF biomarker data 
(see below). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the height and weight of each participant at their most 
recent ADRC or WRAP study visit. APOE ε
4 genotyping procedures have been described previously57, and par-
ticipants were categorized as non-carriers (zero ε
4 alleles) or APOE ε
4 carriers (one or two ε
4 alleles). Participants 
with AD were diagnosed using the NINDS/ADRDA criteria58, and confirmed by a multidisciplinary consensus 
diagnostic panel.
Of the 119 participants recruited, six non-demented participants were excluded from analyses due to antibiotic 
or probiotic use at the time of fecal sample collection that was not reported during initial screening. Participants 
recruited from the WRAP study were largely younger than those recruited from the ADRC, thus for our primary 
compositional analysis we age- and sex-matched the 25 AD participants 1-to-1 from the remaining 88 asymp-
tomatic control participants using case-control matching in SPSS with an age tolerance of 4.5 years to create an 
equal-sized Control group. For secondary CSF correlational analysis, we used microbiome and CSF data from 9 
AD cohort participants, and 31 non-demented (ND) participants, including 10 from the age- and sex-matched 
Control cohort, and an additional 21 largely younger participants not included in the primary analysis.
Fecal sample collection and bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and processing. 
All participants 
involved in the study resided at home, where fecal sample collection occurred. Participants returned by overnight 
delivery sample collection kits, packaged within insulated containers and chilled with frozen gel packs; all sam-
ples included in this study arrived chilled and 92% were processed and frozen (see below) the day following home

collection by an individual who was blind to the participant’s cohort/diagnosis. Upon receipt, chilled samples 
were weighed, scored on the Bristol stool scale59, subsampled (~100 mg) into prepared sterile bead beating tubes, 
and stored at −
80 °C until processing.
Fecal samples, suspended in lysis buffer/phenol:chloroform, were processed by bead beating24 and the 
genomic DNA in the recovered aqueous phase then precipitated with the addition of 0.1-volume 3 M sodium ace-
tate and 1-volume isopropanol, incubated on ice, and centrifuged (4 °C, 20 min at 18,000 x g). After rinsing with 
100% ethanol and drying, the DNA pellet was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) then 
column-purified using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel Inc., Bethlehem, PA). DNA 
concentration was measured using the Qubit BR dsDNA assay (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). The variable region V4 
amplicon of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified in duplicate reactions/sample (plus a no-template control 
for each primer set) using 8-bp barcoded forward and reverse primers (0.4 μ
M)60, 12.5 ng template, and KAPA 
HiFi HotStart DNA polymerase (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Reactions were agarose gel-checked and 
duplicates combined, purified (NucleoSpin columns), and the DNA quantified (Qubit). The final equimolar pool 
was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (paired end, 2 ×
 250-bp).
Sequence processing and cleanup was performed using mothur v1.39.161 and a previously described protot-
col60. Briefly, quality-filtered, paired-end duplex sequence reads were combined into contigs, and sequences with 
ambiguous base pairings, sequences longer that 275-bp, and homopolymers greater than 8-bp were removed. 
Sequences were then aligned to the SILVA 16S rRNA gene reference alignment database, and chimeric sequences 
were identified and removed. Finally, remaining sequences with 97% similarity were clustered into operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs) using the OptiClust algorithm62 and assigned the lowest possible taxonomic classifica-
tions from the GreenGenes reference database (v13.8) using a naive Bayesian classifier requiring an 80% confi-
dence score. As it has been demonstrated that quality-filtering 16S amplicon sequence reads can greatly improve 
accuracy of microbial community analysis63, OTUs with <0.001% of total sequence reads were filtered out from 
the dataset to account for sequencing errors.
Microbial community composition and differential abundance statistical analysis. 
Richness 
(ACE, Chao1) and alpha diversity (Inverse Simpson, Shannon Index) metrics were calculated at the OTU-level 
in mothur by performing 1000 iterations of random subsampling to 31,396 reads (the lowest single partici-
pant number of sequences) from each participant. Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) was calculated from a 
neighbor-joined phylogenetic tree created in R v3.3.2 using normalized OTU-level data and the vegan, phyloseq, 
and ape packages. Beta diversity metrics were computed using normalized OTU-level data in R and included 
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and weighted and unweighted UniFrac. To detect differences in richness and alpha 
diversity between groups, we used independent two-sample t-tests for normally distributed measures or 
Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed measures in SPSS. To detect statistical differences in beta 
diversity metrics between groups, we used permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) in 
the vegan package in R.
Differential abundance of taxa between AD and Control groups was determined at the OTU level using the 
DESeq2 package in R. DESeq2 is a statistical method developed to detect differential expression in RNA-seq count 
data while accounting for library size differences and biological variability64. It has recently been demonstrated 
that applying these methods to microbiome OTU count data leads to improvements in detecting differential 
abundance compared to simple proportions or rarefying65. Results were expressed as log2 fold change in AD par-
ticipants relative to Control participants. Relative abundance comparisons at the genus, family, and phylum levels 
were performed on normalized data in mothur using 10,000 iterations of Metastats, a statistical method employ-
ing non-parametric t-tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and false discovery rate (FDR) correction to detect differentially 
abundant features66. OTUs present in less than 20 participants and those OTUs that could not be classified down 
to the desired level were excluded from the Metastats analysis.
PICRUSt predictive functional metagenomics analysis. 
We used PICRUSt18 to detect predicted 
functional differences in microbial communities between AD and Control participants. Briefly, OTUs were 
re-assigned PICRUSt-compatible taxonomic classifications using the GreenGenes version 13.5 reference data-
base, and then normalized by 16S rRNA copy number. The resulting normalized OTU table was then used for 
prediction of KEGG orthologs (KOs) based on bacterial composition. The weighted nearest sequenced taxon 
index (NSTI), a quality metric of the phylogenetic distance between the input OTUs of our samples and the 
reference OTUs used for metagenomic prediction, was 0.07 ± 0.01 (mean ± SD) for our samples. KOs were col-
lapsed into hierarchical KEGG pathways using the categorize by function command in PICRUSt, and the linear 
discriminate analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe)67 implementation in mothur was used to detect differences in level 
2 and level 3 KEGG pathways. LDA scores (log 10) of significantly different pathways were plotted as bars using 
ggplot2 in R.
CSF collection and microbiome correlation statistical analysis. 
CSF was collected via lumbar punc-
ture in the morning after a 12hr fast with a Sprotte 25-or 24-gauge spinal needle at the L3/4 or L4/5 interspace 
using gentle extraction into propylene syringes. CSF (~22 mL) was then combined, gently mixed and centrifuged 
at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes. Supernatants were frozen in 0.5 mL aliquots in polypropylene tubes and stored at 
−
80 °C.
CSF measures included the Aβ
42/Aβ
40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and the p-tau/Aβ
42 ratio. Using the 
Aβ
42/Aβ
40 ratio normalizes CSF Aβ
42 for the total amount of Aβ
 peptides that are present in CSF and shows better 
correspondence with brain amyloid deposition as well as superior diagnostic performance than CSF Aβ
42 alone68. 
For the Aβ
42/Aβ
40 ratio, CSF Aβ
42 and CSF Aβ
40 were quantified separately by electrochemiluminescence (ECL)

using an Aβ
 triplex assay (MSD Human Aβ
 peptide Ultra-Sensitive Kit, Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, 
MD). For p-tau and the p-tau/Aβ
42 ratio, CSF P-tau and Aβ
42 were quantified using commercially available sand-
wich ELISAs (INNOTEST β
-amyloid1–42, and Phospho-Tau[181 P], respectively; Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, 
Belgium). YKL-40 was quantified using sandwich ELISAs (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., USA). CSF assays 
were performed in two batches and corrected for batch differences as previously described69,70. For correlational 
statistical analysis, we used the “cor.test” function in R to calculate Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients 
between CSF biomarker levels and normalized relative abundances for the 13 differentially abundant genera. The 
correlation matrix was plotted as ellipses using the ellipse package in R.
