Objective. To assess whether more frequent fish consumption is associated with lower rheumatoid arthritis (RA) dis-
ease activity scores among participants in an RA cohort.
Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data from participants in the Evaluation of Subclini-
cal Cardiovascular Disease and Predictors of Events in Rheumatoid Arthritis cohort study. Frequency of fish consump-
tion was assessed by a baseline food frequency questionnaire assessing usual diet in the past year. Multivariable, total
energy–adjusted linear regression models provided effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for fre-
quency of fish consumption (i.e., never to <1 time/month, 1 time/month to <1 time/week, 1 time/week, and ≥2 times/
week) on baseline Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) using the C-reactive protein (CRP) level. We also esti-
mated the difference in DAS28-CRP associated with increasing fish consumption by 1 serving per week.
Results. Among 176 participants, the median DAS28-CRP score was 3.5 (interquartile range 2.9–4.3). In an adjusted
linear regression model, subjects consuming fish ≥2 times/week had a significantly lower DAS28-CRP compared with
subjects who ate fish never to <1 time/month (difference �0.49 [95% CI �0.97, �0.02]). For each additional serving of
fish per week, DAS28-CRP was significantly reduced by 0.18 (95% CI �0.35, �0.004).
Conclusion. Our findings suggest that higher intake of fish may be associated with lower disease activity in RA patients.
INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease
characterized by synovial inflammation leading to pain,
functional impairment, and joint erosions. Use of disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) reduces systemic
inflammation, improves symptoms, and prevents long-term
joint damage. While DMARDs are the standard-of-care for
RA, other antiinflammatory therapies have been studied.
Omega-3 fatty acids downregulate proinflammatory cyto-
kines, and thus have been of interest for decades (1–4). Several
randomized trials tested the effect of fish oil supplements
on RA disease activity (5–7), using doses of omega-3 fatty
acids (≥3 grams/day eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosa-
hexaenoic acid [DHA]), exceeding the omega-3 content in 1
serving of fish (8). In double-blind placebo-controlled trials,
subjects receiving fish oil had improved tender joint counts
(7) and higher rates of remission on triple nonbiologic (nb)
DMARD therapy (6). While those nutrient-focused interven-
tions showed benefit on disease activity, potential benefits
of eating whole fish could not be detected given the study
design. We hypothesized that greater fish consumption
would be associated with lower RA disease activity scores
and tested this hypothesis in an RA cohort.

 in the Evaluation of Subclinical Cardiovascular Disease and
Predictors of Events in Rheumatoid Arthritis (ESCAPE-RA)
cohort study, which investigated subclinical cardiovascular
disease in RA (9). From October 2004 to May 2006, the
ESCAPE-RA study enrolled adults ages 45–84 years, meeting
American College of Rheumatology 1987 RA classification
criteria (10), and living near Baltimore, Maryland. Entry
criteria for ESCAPE-RA mirrored entry criteria for the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) (11); thus, subjects
with a prior cardiovascular event or weighing >300 pounds
were excluded. All study procedures were approved by the
appropriate institutional review boards.
Our outcome was the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints
(DAS28), using the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, calcu-
lated at baseline using joint counts performed by a single
trained assessor, and normally distributed based on the
Shapiro-Wilk test (P = 0.14) (12,13).
Food frequency questionnaire and exposure. At base-
line, participants completed a 120-item food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) assessing usual diet in the past year.
This FFQ was originally developed for MESA and was
modeled on a validated FFQ (14). For each item, participants
recorded frequency of use on a 9-point scale ranging from
“never to <1 time/month” to “≥2 times/day.” Participants
indicated small, medium, or large serving size for each item.
Missing frequency was assigned as never to <1 time/month.
Missing serving size was assigned as medium. For each food
item, the product of frequency of consumption and serving
size represented the average energy/day from that item (15).
Total average energy/day was calculated as the sum of
average energy/day from all 120 items. Participants reporting
extreme total average energy/day (men <800 kcal/day or
>4,200 kcal/day, women <600 kcal/day or >3,500 kcal/day)
were excluded (n = 10) (16,17). Thus, the range of total
average energy intake/day was 800–4,200 kcal/day for men,
and 600–3,500 kcal/day for women.
Frequency of fish consumption was calculated as the
sum of frequencies of 2 items in units of times per day:
“tuna fish, salmon, sardines (cooked or raw including
sashimi or sushi),” and “other broiled, steamed, baked or
raw fish (trout, sole, halibut, poke, grouper, etc.).” These
2 items represented nonfried fish consumption, and were
selected due to higher omega-3 fatty acid content com-
pared to the other seafood items included on the MESA
FFQ (15,18). Among MESA study participants, plasma
EPA + DHA levels were significantly correlated with
nonfried fish consumption (r = 0.38, P < 0.05) but not
with consumption of fried fish, nonfried shellfish, or fish
in mixed dishes (such as “stir-fried shrimp or fish with
vegetables”) (15). Therefore, we did not include fried
fish, nonfried shellfish, or fish in mixed dishes in our
assessment of fish intake. Fish consumption was catego-
rized in 4 groups using cutoffs representing meaningful
differences in frequency of consumption. These 4 cate-
gories were: never to <1 time/month (FFQ category:
never to <1 time/month), 1 time/month to <1 time/week
(FFQ categories: 1 time/month and 2–3 times/month), 1
time/week (FFQ category: 1 time/week), and ≥2 times/
week (FFQ categories: 2 times/week, 3–4 times/week, 5–6
times/week, 1 time/day, and ≥2 times/day). Prior studies
using MESA FFQ data have also focused on frequency of
consumption of food items of interest, rather than serv-
ing size (15,19). In sensitivity analyses, we evaluated 3
groups of consumption, as studies of fish and RA risk
have tested various categorizations (20). The 3 groups
were: never to <1 time/month, 1 time/month to <1 time/
week, and ≥1 time/week (FFQ categories: 1 time/week, 2
times/week, 3–4 times/week, 5–6 times/week, 1 time/
day, and ≥2 times/day).
Covariates. Baseline covariates included race, dichoto-
mized as white/nonwhite, and body mass index (BMI),
assessed as continuous (kg/m2) and categorical (<25, 25 to
<30, and ≥30 kg/m2). Education, smoking, annual income,
employment status, marital status, depression symptoms,
and Charlson comorbidity score were reported.
RA features included anti–cyclic citrullinated protein
antibody, rheumatoid factor, HLA-shared epitope, symp-
tom duration, years since RA diagnosis, and functional
status (Health Assessment Questionnaire) (21). Current
use of nbDMARDs, biologic (b)DMARDs, glucocorticoids,
and fish oil supplements were recorded.
Statistical methods. Baseline characteristics were sum-
marized by fish consumption categories using descriptive
statistics. Univariate linear regression models were con-
structed to assess the relationship between covariates and
DAS28-CRP. Covariates with a 2-sided P value less than
0.20
were tested
for confounding
(>10%
change in
coefficient for fish consumption) using linear regression
models and adjusted for total average energy per day and
fish consumption.
Linear regression models were constructed to test the
relationship between frequency of fish consumption and
DAS28-CRP. For each category of fish consumption we
reported the mean difference in DAS28-CRP (b coefficient
and 95% confidence interval [95% CI]) compared to con-
suming fish never to <1 time/month. All models were
adjusted for total average energy consumed per day (22).
Significance & Innovations
• This is a novel analysis of the relationship between
consuming fish as a whole food, rather than con-
suming fish oil supplements, and rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) disease activity.
• We report a statistically and clinically significant
reduction in the Disease Activity Score in 28
joints (DAS28) using the C-reactive protein (CRP)
level among subjects with RA who consumed fish
≥2 times/week compared to those who consumed
fish never or <1 time/month, after adjustment for
confounders.
• Our observed difference in DAS28-CRP of 0.49
between the highest and lowest categories of fish
consumption is approximately one-third the magni-
tude of previously reported pre- and posttreatment
differences in DAS28 among methotrexate users.

Tedeschi et al
 Multivariable models first included age and sex, followed
by additional adjustment for confounders. To test for
trend across categories of fish consumption, we calculated
the difference in DAS28-CRP associated with increasing
fish consumption (an increase of 1 serving/week) by
including a term representing median frequency of fish
consumption/week in each category. The coefficient and
95% CI of this term represented the difference in mean
DAS28-CRP per 1 additional serving of fish per week.
Prespecified sensitivity analyses adjusted for bDMARDs,
fish oil supplements, and pack-years; excluded subjects
taking fish oil supplements; and evaluated 3 categories of
fish consumption. We also examined the impact of out-
liers, defined as DAS28-CRP >95th percentile of each fish
consumption group, on the primary analysis by excluding
those subjects in a sensitivity analysis. Simple imputation
was performed by assigning zero for categorical variables
or the sample median for continuous variables. Seven
subjects (4.0%) had missing data for “tuna fish, salmon,
sardines (cooked or raw including sashimi or sushi),” and
6 (3.4%) lacked data for “other broiled, steamed, baked or
raw fish (trout, sole, halibut, poke, grouper, etc.).” For the
variable representing overall frequency of nonfried fish
consumption, obtained by summing the frequencies of
these 2 food items, 9 subjects (5.1%) had missing data.
For each of the covariates included in multivariable mod-
els, fewer than 5 subjects had missing data.
RESULTS
We included 176 ESCAPE-RA participants in this analysis;
Table 1 presents baseline traits. The majority were middle-
aged, college-educated white females taking DMARDs for
seropositive, longstanding RA. Thirty-five subjects (19.9%)
reported infrequent fish consumption (never to <1/month),
while 31 (17.6%) were frequent consumers (≥2 times/week).

Fish Consumption and Disease Activity in RA

 Pack-years were highest, and depression scores lowest
(best), among the most frequent consumers. Median (inter-
quartile range) DAS28-CRP was 3.5 (2.9–4.3) among all
participants, reflecting moderate disease activity (23). Distri-
bution of DAS28-CRP by fish consumption group is pre-

(available

wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23295/abstract). Fish oil supple-
ment use was most frequent (20%) among subjects eating
fish never to <1 time/month.
Adjusting for age and sex, DAS28-CRP was significantly
lower by an average of 0.65 (95% CI �1.15, �0.15) among
subjects consuming fish ≥2 times/week compared to those
eating fish never to <1 time/month (Table 2). With addi-
tional adjustment for confounders, subjects consuming
fish ≥2 times/week had significantly lower DAS28-CRP
compared with never to <1 time/month by an average of
0.49 (95% CI �0.97, �0.02). For each additional serving
of fish per week, DAS28-CRP was significantly reduced
by an average of 0.18 (95% CI �0.35, �0.004).
In sensitivity analyses, we obtained similar results after
additional adjustment for bDMARDs and fish oil supple-
ments (Table 2). Upon excluding outliers of DAS28-CRP
(n = 6), we obtained similar results; subjects consuming fish
≥2 times/week had significantly lower DAS28-CRP by an
average of 0.54 (95% CI �0.99, �0.09) compared to those
eating fish never to <1 time/month. Fish oil supplement use
itself was also associated with lower DAS28-CRP (�0.22
[95% CI �0.72, +0.29]). Further adjustment for smoking
produced similar results; subjects consuming fish ≥2 times/
week had significantly lower DAS28-CRP by an average of
0.49 (95% CI �0.98, �0.003) compared with never to <1
time/month. Among 160 subjects not using fish oil supple-
ments, DAS28-CRP was lower by an average of 0.41 (95%
CI �0.92, +0.11) among those eating fish ≥2 times/week
compared with never to <1 time/month. In this subgroup,
each additional serving of fish per week was associated
with a lower DAS28-CRP of 0.14 (95% CI �0.32, +0.04).
In analyses evaluating fish in 3 groups, subjects con-
suming fish ≥1 time/week had significantly lower mean
DAS28-CRP by 0.44 (95% CI �0.85, �0.04) compared
with never to <1 time/month in the fully-adjusted model
(Table 3). For each additional serving of fish per week,
the difference in mean DAS28-CRP was significantly
lower by 0.26 (95% CI �0.51, �0.02).
DISCUSSION
In this cross-sectional analysis of fish consumption in a
cohort of RA patients, DAS28-CRP was significantly lower
among subjects consuming fish ≥2 times/week compared
with those eating fish <1 time/month after adjusting for
confounders. One additional serving of fish per week was
associated with significantly lower DAS28-CRP. Further
adjustment for bDMARDs, fish oil supplements, and pack-
years, and excluding outliers, produced similar results.
The observed difference in mean DAS28-CRP between
the highest and lowest categories of fish consumption is of
clinically important magnitude. During the Swedish Phar-
macotherapy trial run-in period, mean DAS28 decreased
by 1.2 among 258 subjects after 3–4 months of methotrex-
ate. In a cohort of 307 longstanding RA patients with mod-
erate to high disease activity treated with methotrexate
(without bDMARDs), mean DAS28 decreased by 1.6 after 6
months (24). Our observed difference of 0.49 between the
highest and lowest categories of fish consumption is
approximately one-third the magnitude of these observed
differences in DAS28 among methotrexate users.
In a recent randomized controlled trial of fish oil supple-
mentation among RA subjects with disease duration <12
months and taking triple DMARD therapy, treatment with
high-dose fish oil (EPA + DHA 5.5 gm/day) versus low-dose
fish oil (EPA + DHA 0.4 gm/day) produced no significant
difference in the change in DAS28 using the erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) over 12 months (6). At 12 months,
both groups had a significant decrease in DAS28-ESR

 compared to baseline, which may account for the fact that a
between-group difference in DAS28-ESR was not observed.
Nonetheless, the time to remission was significantly shorter
in the high-dose versus low-dose fish oil group. Earlier
studies of fish oil supplementation in RA were conducted
in the decades before the DAS28 was commonly used; thus
we are unable to compare outcomes between our analysis
and those studies.
In our analysis, omega-3 fatty acid consumption among
subjects in the highest group of fish consumption (≥2 times
per week) was almost certainly less than 5.5 gm/day, given
that one 8-ounce (225 gram) serving of fatty fish generally
provides around 2–4 gm EPA + DHA (8). Our analysis
focused on 2 FFQ items describing nonfried fish, which
have the highest omega-3 content of the FFQ fish items; we
excluded fried seafood and shellfish due to lower omega-3
content. Potential reasons for lower omega-3 fatty acid con-
tent in fried fish include low omega-3 content of the fish
selected for frying, and deterioration of long-chain fatty
acids during the frying process (15). Our observation that
baseline consumption of fish ≥2 times per week was associ-
ated with lower DAS28-CRP at the same point in time may
either reflect a generally healthier lifestyle among those
who eat fish most often, or an effect of consuming fish as a
whole food that contains various macronutrients and
micronutrients in addition to omega-3 fatty acids. While
the group consuming fish ≥2 times per week had some base-
line traits that might be associated with improved disease
activity, such as lower BMI and higher socioeconomic sta-
tus, the prevalence of smoking was also highest in this
group, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the
way that these potential confounders could affect the rela-
tionship between fish consumption and DAS28-CRP. How-
ever, we must also bear in mind that causal inferences are
always limited in cross-sectional, nonrandomized studies.
In the primary analysis we divided subjects into 4 groups
reflecting realistic differences in fish consumption. In a
study of MESA subjects who completed the same FFQ as
ESCAPE-RA subjects, a threshold effect of fish consump-
tion on plasma levels of EPA + DHA was observed for fish
intake ≥2 times per week (15), providing rationale for our
highest category in the primary analysis. Multiple studies
have reported decreased risk of incident RA associated
with greater fish consumption, although categorizations
of fish intake varied (20). In a sensitivity analysis, we
categorized fish consumption into 3 groups and observed
similar results to the primary analysis. Meta-analysis of 7
studies found a nonsignificant decreased risk of develop-
ing RA for each additional serving of fish per week (20).
While beyond the scope of the present analysis, some
have wondered if lower RA incidence rates in some
countries may be related to cultural or environmental
differences, including differences in frequency of fish
consumption. In our cross-sectional analysis, each addi-
tional serving of fish per week was associated with 0.18
lower DAS28-CRP.
We observed the highest percentage of smokers and longer
disease duration among subjects consuming fish most fre-
quently, which one might expect to be associated with worse
disease activity scores. However, despite increased preva-
lence of these potential confounders, the group consuming
fish ≥2 times/week had significantly lower DAS28-CRP
scores compared to the reference group, stimulating further
interest regarding the importance of fish consumption as it
relates to lower disease activity. While the magnitude of dif-
ference in DAS28-CRP was striking between the highest and
lowest categories of fish consumption, this was a cross-
sectional study and we cannot draw firm conclusions about
the impact of frequent fish consumption on RA disease
activity. Reverse causation is a possible explanation for
observing an association between frequent fish intake and
lower disease activity; thus prospective studies are needed
to minimize this potential source of bias. Cohort studies can-
not control for unmeasured confounders, and a randomized
controlled trial would be required to provide firm evidence
that greater fish consumption lowers RA disease activity.
The ESCAPE-RA cohort was predominantly white, well-
educated married patients with longstanding RA, and thus
our results may not generalize to other populations.
In conclusion, we observed significantly lower DAS28-
CRP among subjects consuming fish ≥2 times/week com-
pared to those eating fish never or <1 time/month.
Prospective assessment of disease activity in relationship
to fish consumption is warranted.
