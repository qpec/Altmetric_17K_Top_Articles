ABSTRACT
Objective: In Japan, the possible adverse events upon HPV vaccination was widely reported in the media.
MHLW announced the suspension of aggressively encouraging HPV vaccination in 2013, and inoculation
rate has sharply declined. The aim of the present study was estimation of future cervical cancer risk.
Methods: The latest data on vaccination rate at each age in Sakai City were first investigated. The rate of
experiencing sexual intercourse at the age of 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and throughout lifetime is assumed to
be 0%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 15%, 25%, and 85% respectively. The cervical cancer risk was regarded to be
proportional to the relative risk of HPV infection over the lifetime. The risk in those born in 1993 whom
HPV vaccination was not available yet for was defined to be 1.0000.
Results: The cumulative vaccination rates were 65.8% in those born in 1994, 72.7% in 1995, 72.8% in
1996, 75.7% in 1997, 75.0% in 1998, 66.8% in 1999, 4.1% in 2000, 1.5% in 2001, 0.1% in 2002, and 0.1% in
2003. The relative cervical cancer risk in those born in 1994–1999 was reduced to 0.56–0.70, however, the
rate in those born in 2000–2003 was 0.98–1.0, almost the same risk as before introduction of the vaccine.
Discussion: The cumulative initial vaccination rates were different by the year of birth. It is confirmed
that the risk of future cervical cancer differs in accordance with the year of birth. For these females,
cervical cancer screening should be recommended more strongly.

Introduction
Worldwide, the frequency and the death rate of cervical cancer
are the fourth highest among female cancers,1 with estimated
530,000 people newly contracting this disease in 2012, making
up 7.5% of cancer deaths among women.2 In the United States,
the estimated number of new cases of cervical cancer in 2016 is
12,900, with 4,120 of these cases leading to death.3
Most cervical cancers are known to be caused by persis-
tent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) including
HPV types 16 and 18. While cervical cancers caused by
HPV-16 and 18 infection are preventable with vaccination,
the inoculation rate varies depending on the country4 and
remains low despite recommendation by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States.
With regard to this, the American Society of Clinical Oncol-
ogy (ASCO) has announced that the ASCO strongly supports
efforts to markedly increase the proportion of boys and girls
receiving the HPV vaccine in the United States and world-
wide.5 According to several studies, the obstacles to vaccina-
tion
involve
multiple
possible
factors,
such
as
safety
concerns about the vaccine, a lack of clear recommendations
from health care providers, etc.5 The issue of adverse events,

 although not markedly different from those of other vac-
cines, has made this problem worse worldwide.6
In Japan, the HPV vaccine was approved in 2009, after which
an urgent promotion project for vaccination was initiated by the
Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in 2010. HPV
vaccinations were provided free of charge or at low cost for 13
to 16-year-old girls. From April 2013, periodical vaccination of
12 to 16-year-old girls was initiated, typically for 12-year-old
girls. However, the occurrence of so-called serious adverse events
upon HPV vaccination after initiating periodical vaccinations
was widely reported in the media and a picture of a patient who
exhibited symptoms was repeatedly broadcast. As a consequence,
MHLW decided for the “suspension of aggressively encouraging
vaccination” in June 2013.7 As a result of this determination, the
inoculation rate has sharply declined.8
Hanley et al. reported that, after the suspension of the govern-
mental recommendation, the completion rate of HPV vaccination
plummeted to just 0.6% in Sapporo, Japan in 20149. Sekine et al.
reported that the vaccination rates of the 12 to 16-year-olds in Nii-
gata City, Japan, in 2014 and 2015 were 3.5% and 0.19% respec-
tively.10 The news of Japan’s suspension of the HPV vaccine
recommendation has traveled globally through online media and
social media networks, being applauded by anti-vaccination groups
but not by the global scientific community. Larson HJ described
that the longer the uncertainty around the Japanese HPV vaccine
recommendation persists, the further the public concerns are likely
to travel.11 The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that
policy decisions based on weak evidence, leading to lack of use of
safe and effective vaccines, can result in real harm.12
Cervical cancer patients number 8,000 people a year in Japan,
and 3,500 die per year.13 Furthermore, a marked increase in the
incidence rate of cervical cancer in 20 to 49-year-olds has been
seen.13,14 This is assumed to be a result of a decline in the age of ini-
tial incidence of HPV infection due to a decline in the age of first
sexual intercourse, in addition to low screening rate. Among 22
developed countries, the cervical cancer screening rate in Japan is
the lowest at 37.7%, compared with that of 85.0% in the United
States and more than 65.0% in all European countries.15 A greater
decline in cervical cancer screening rate is observed in young
women and is 10.2% in 20 to 25-year-olds in Japan.16 Although
the WHO points out that the benefit of HPV vaccine is particularly
great in countries having a low cervical cancer screening rate.12
We previously predicted that if aggressive encouragement of
vaccination were not resumed going forward, the significant dif-
ference in the HPV infection rate would be observed according
to the year of birth, and it would vary significantly in accordance
with the year of restart of the governmental recommendation,
using an assumed inoculation rate.17 In the previous study, all
female children were hypothesized to be vaccinated at the youn-
gest targeted age. However, all the girls did not undergo vaccina-
tion at the youngest targeted age in practice. Moreover, the most
serious public and medical concern should be future cervical can-
cer risk caused by infection of HPV without vaccination. The life-
time risk of cervical cancer does not correlate with the risk of
HPV-16 and 18 infection at the age of 20. The aim of the present
study was estimation of the lifetime cervical cancer risk by the
year of birth, based on the latest real data on vaccination rate.
Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the vaccination rate and the resulting change in
cervical cancer relative risk that could actually occur in the future
and was already being determined, confirming that our previous
prediction is now becoming a reality and severity. Figure 2

data of the HPV vaccination rates were provided from the Sakai City Government to our study team.

 demonstrates a sample of risk calculation. The initial vaccination
rates of the youngest children every year were 10.8% (age 13) in
2010, 62.7% (age 13) in 2011, 65.4% (age 13) in 2012, 1.1% (age
12) in 2013, 0.1% (age 12) in 2014, and 0.1% (age 12) in 2015. It
is clear that after the suspending of encouragement by MHLW,
the vaccination rate significantly decreased and has currently
almost ceased. Furthermore, the cumulative initial vaccination
rates were 0.0% in 1993, 65.8% in 1994, 72.7% in 1995, 72.8% in
1996, 75.7% in 1997, 75.0% in 1998, 66.8% in 1999, 4.1% in
2000, 1.5% in 2001, 0.1% in 2002, and 0.1% in 2003.
The future cervical cancer risk in those born in 1993 was
defined to be 1.0000. As a result, it was found that the rela-
tive risk in those born in 1994 was 0.70, that in those born
in 1995 was 0.63, that in those born in 1996 was 0.59, that
in those born in 1997 was 0.56, that in those born in 1998
was 0.56, that in those born in 1999 was 0.60, that in those
born in 2000 was 0.98, that in those born in 2001 was 0.99,
that in those born in 2002 was 1.0, and that in those born
in 2003 was 1.0. It was clear that those born between 1994
and 1999 were part of the generation in which the preven-
tion of future cervical cancer by HPV vaccine would be
achievable to some extent, while those born after 2000
would be exposed to the same risk as before introduction of
the vaccine. For these females, cervical cancer screening
should be recommended more strongly.
The real inoculation rates showed how the reporting of pos-
sible adverse events in the media and the suspension of encour-
agement by MHLW influenced girls of the targeted age. From
the above, at present, it is confirmed that the cumulative initial
vaccination rates were different by the year of birth, leading to
the realistic fear of differences in the risk of developing cervical
cancer depending on the year of birth. It is a very unfortunate
prediction that the different risks of cervical cancer depending
on the year of birth will be caused by the governmental deci-
sion. The change in cervical cancer relative risk could actually
occur in the future and was already being determined. In fact,
Ozawa et al. demonstrated the significant reduction of the rate
of abnormal cervical cytology among the vaccinated women
aged 20–24 compared with those who had not received HPV
vaccine in Japan.18
It is necessary for us to face the reality that the risk of
the HPV infection and cervical cancer increases every day
for girls who refrain from vaccination and begin to have
sexual intercourse without it. For these females, cervical
cancer screening should be recommended more strongly. In
regard to HPV vaccine, catch-up vaccinations for females
who missed the opportunity of HPV vaccination due to the
suspension of the governmental recommendation, and use
of 9-valent HPV vaccines (currently, only bi- and quadriva-
lent
HPV
vaccines
are
licensed
in
Japan)
should
be
considered.19
There are some limitations in the present study. We used
the data from Sakai City in this study; however, the vaccina-
tion situation will vary depending on the local government,
and it appears that there are local governments which face a
much worse reality than Sakai City. Moreover, we hypothe-
sized that HPV infection risk is proportional to the rate of
having sexual intercourse without HPV vaccination at every
age and over the lifetime, and that the relative risk of cervical
cancer could be determined by the relative risk of HPV
infection over the lifetime. HPV infection risk is not regu-
lated only by the rate of experiencing of sexual intercourse
without vaccination, and cervical cancer risk is different by
the type of HPV. Uncertainty of these hypotheses was mini-
mized by demonstrating the relative risk compared with the
risk of those born in 1993 whom HPV vaccination was not
available yet for. One more limitation is assumption of the
rates of having experienced sexual intercourse at each age,
which are not derived from official data.
In conclusion, the risk of future cervical cancer differs in
accordance with the year of birth. This is a problem that must
be overcome not only in Japan but in all countries where the
HPV inoculation rate is not increasing.
Methods
The lifetime risk of cervical cancer was estimated using the lat-
est real data on vaccination rate at each age (2010 through
2015) in Sakai City, Osaka, a government-designated city with
a population of 839,128 (2012), regarding the situation on vac-
cinations. In Sakai City, public funding was initiated in October
2010 and 13 to 16-year-olds were vaccinated. Because vaccina-
tions were initiated mid-year, eligible 16-year-olds could
receive public funding by the following September. Periodical
vaccinations were initiated from 2013 and 12 to 16-year-olds
were vaccinated. The statistical data of the HPV vaccination
rates were provided from the Sakai City Government to our
study team after approval of the Institutional Review Board of
Osaka University Hospital.
Calculation to estimate the lifetime risk of cervical cancer
was based on the following hypothesis:
1) The rate of having experienced sexual intercourse at the
age of 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 is assumed to be 0%, 1%,
2%, 5%, 15%, and 25%, respectively. The lifetime rate is
assumed to be 85%.
2) HPV infection risk is calculated based on the rate of hav-
ing sexual intercourse without HPV vaccination at every
age and over the lifetime.
3) The relative risk of cervical cancer is proportional to the
relative risk of HPV infection over the lifetime.
4) Protective effect against HPV infection is provided by a
one-time vaccination (because only the data of the first
vaccination was provided)
5) Cervical cancer is caused by HPV infection. The rate of
cancer caused by HPV type 16/18 infection is 60%, and
40% by other types, not including infections of HPV
type 16/18 in combination with other types.
6) Even if inoculated, the incidence rate of cervical cancer
caused by types other than HPV type 16/18 does not
change.
7) During the analysis period, the population according to
each year of birth does not change.
8) If the vaccine does not exist, the incidence rate of cervical
cancer does not change over the course of the analysis
period.
9) The presence of vaccination and sexual activity are inde-
pendent of each other, with sexual activity not changing
during the analysis period.
