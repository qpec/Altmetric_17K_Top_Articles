OBJECTIVES: To provide updated prevalence data on obesity trends among US children and 
adolescents aged 2 to 19 years from a nationally representative sample.
METHODS: We used the NHANES for years 1999 to 2016. Weight status was determined 
by using measured height and weight from the physical examination component of the 
NHANES to calculate age- and sex-specific BMI. We report the prevalence estimates 
of overweight and obesity (class I, class II, and class III) by 2-year NHANES cycles and 
compared cycles by using adjusted Wald tests and linear trends by using ordinary least 
squares regression.
RESULTS: White and Asian American children have significantly lower rates of obesity than 
African American children, Hispanic children, or children of other races. We report a 
positive linear trend for all definitions of overweight and obesity among children 2–19 
years old, most prominently among adolescents. Children aged 2 to 5 years showed a sharp 
increase in obesity prevalence from 2015 to 2016 compared with the previous cycle.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite previous reports that obesity in children and adolescents has remained 
stable or decreased in recent years, we found no evidence of a decline in obesity prevalence 
at any age. In contrast, we report a significant increase in severe obesity among children 
aged 2 to 5 years since the 2013–2014 cycle, a trend that continued upward for many 
subgroups.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: The US 
prevalence of child and adolescent obesity has 
been increasing for 4 decades. Some reports reveal 
stabilization across the population and decreases 
among young children aged 2 to 5 years, although 
severe obesity has increased, with adverse health 
effects.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: We detail the prevalence 
of obesity and severe obesity by age and race and/
or ethnicity, including Asian American youth, in a 
nationally representative sample. Despite significant 
public health initiatives, obesity and severe obesity 
continue to increase, with a sharp increase being 
noted in preschool-aged children.

 The prevalence of childhood obesity 
has increased dramatically among all 
age groups since 1988.1 Over the past 
several years, some researchers have 
reported stabilization in the obesity 
prevalence overall among youth1 
– 
3 
and decreases in 2- to 5-year-old 
children.3, 
 
4 However, others report 
no decrease in any age group since 
19995, 
 
6 but rather a sharp increase 
in the prevalence of severe obesity, 
particularly among adolescents 
and non-Hispanic African American 
children.5
Previously, severe obesity had 
been defined as having a BMI >99th 
percentile.7 Recent analyses suggest 
that BMI SD scores (z scores) poorly 
reflect adiposity among children and 
adolescents with severe obesity.8 
– 
10 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) recommend using 
a relative BMI measure to describe 
youth with severe obesity.11 A new 
classification system recognizes BMI 
≥95th percentile as class I obesity, 
BMI ≥120% of the 95th percentile 
as class II obesity, and BMI ≥140% 
of the 95th percentile as class III 
obesity. Class II and III obesity are 
strongly associated with greater 
cardiovascular and metabolic risk.12
Despite intense focus on reducing 
the US childhood obesity epidemic 
over the past 2 decades, our 
progress remains unclear. Ongoing 
surveillance is critical to gauging 
population-level prevalence changes 
that result from overarching policy or 
public health changes. Our objective 
is to provide the most up-to-date 
data on the national prevalence 
of all obesity classes, including 
severe obesity, among children and 
adolescents in the United States. A 
recent CDC report has provided a 
summary statement on these recent 
trends.13 We build on that report 
here by providing prevalence rates 
for severe obesity, more specific 
age subgroups, and adding context 
to these trends by providing a long-
term prevalence report. We report 
youth obesity and severe obesity 
prevalence from the most recent 
cycle of the NHANES (2015–2016) 
and provide long-term trends from 
the NHANES 1999–2016 cycle.
MethODs
We are using methods and analyses 
that are similar to those of previous 
studies, 
5, 
 
6, 
 
12 which are detailed in 
brief as follows.
Data
The data source is the NHANES 
for years 1999–2016. The 
NHANES is a stratified, multistage 
probability sample of the civilian, 
noninstitutionalized US population. 
Although the NHANES contains 
multiple components, we used the 
in-home interview and physical 
examination here, including 
measured height and weight. We 
included all children aged 2 to 19 
years. For the present analysis, we 
used only deidentified secondary 
data, so it was therefore deemed 
exempt from further review by the 
Duke University Health System 
Institutional Review Board under 
federal regulation 45CFR§46.101(b).
Measures
Weight status is directly measured 
by using height and weight 
measurements gathered from the 
physical examination component of 
NHANES to calculate age- and sex-
specific BMI. We defined overweight 
and obesity, hereby referred to as 
class I obesity, to contrast with class 
II and class III (more severe forms 
of obesity) by using CDC criteria, 
which define overweight as age- and 
sex-specific BMI ≥85th percentile 
and class I obesity as BMI ≥95th 
percentile.14 We defined class II  
and class III obesity to be consistent 
with previous reports, 
6, 
 
12, 
 
15  
with class II obesity defined as a 
BMI >120% of the 95th percentile 
for age and sex or a BMI of ≥35 
(whichever is lower) and class III 
obesity defined as a BMI ≥140% of 
the 95th percentile for age and sex or 
a BMI of ≥40 or greater (whichever 
is lower). These categories were not 
mutually exclusive; for example, any 
children or adolescents meeting the 
criteria for overweight include all the 
children and adolescents with a BMI 
≥85th percentile (even if they are 
also in the ≥95th percentile).
For years 1999–2010, the NHANES 
characterized race and ethnicity as 
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic 
African American, Hispanic, and other 
race and/or ethnicity. Beginning in 
2011, the NHANES included an Asian 
American oversample, allowing for 
a more detailed characterization of 
this group. We include estimates for 
Asian Americans in years when this 
information is available. Before 2011, 
the inclusion of Asian Americans in 
the other race category made that 
category different from the other 
race category of 2011–2016, when 
Asian Americans were categorized 
separately. Therefore, we present 
other race separately for years when 
Asian Americans were included in the 
category and present them as their 
own category from 2011 to 2016, 
when they were oversampled.
statistical approach
We report the prevalence estimates 
of overweight and each obesity 
definition by 2-year NHANES 
cycles. To test the trends from 
1999 to 2016, we report P values 
from ordinary least squares 
regression, with the NHANES year 
as a continuous variable predicting 
obesity and severe obesity 
prevalence. To compare the 2 most 
recent NHANES cycles, we present 
P values from adjusted Wald tests 
to compare differences between 
the most recent cycles, 2013–2014 
and 2015–2016. We adjusted all 
analyses for the complex survey 
design of the NHANES, including 
strata, primary sampling units, and 
probability weights, by using the 
survey estimation commands in Stata

Readers should use the following 
information as guidance when 
interpreting our findings. We 
present results from multiple 
significance tests but do not make 
any adjustments for multiple testing, 
which reduces the chance of a type 
II error but increases the chance 
of a type I error. Readers should 
consider the chance for both type 
I and type II errors. To reduce the 
chance of a type II error (indicating 
as significant a relationship that 
does not exist), we present all ad hoc 
data without choosing only those 
that are significant. We include P 
values for reference but encourage 
readers not to focus on P < .05 and 
instead to consider the body of data. 
In the supplemental appendices, we 
present confidence intervals (CIs) 
to allow readers to draw their own 
conclusions about more nuanced 
comparisons. The chance of a type I 
error (not identifying a relationship 
that does exist) should be considered, 
particularly in our comparisons 
between the 2013–2014 and 2015–
2016 cycles. Although the sample 
size allows for the identification 
of relatively small differences in 
the prevalence of the full sample, 
subgroup analyses should be 
considered more carefully. We have 
provided sample sizes throughout 
the tables to assist readers in their 
assessments.
Results
Prevalence
 
Table 1 presents the prevalence of 
overweight and all classes of obesity 
by demographic characteristics in the 
most recent NHANES cycle, 2015–
2016. Non-Hispanic African American 
and Hispanic children had higher 
prevalence rates of overweight 
and all classes of obesity compared 
with other races. Asian American 
children had markedly lower rates of 
overweight and all classes of obesity. 
The prevalence of overweight 
and obesity increased with age, 
with 41.5% of 16- to 19-year-old 
adolescents having obesity and 4.5% 
meeting criteria for class III obesity.
trends in the 1999–2000 and  
2015–2016 cycles
 
Table 2 shows the prevalence 
of overweight and all classes of 
obesity by ordinal 2-year cycles 
(1999–2016) for females, males, 
and both sexes. A positive linear 
trend is significant for overweight 
(P = .003), class I obesity (P = .008), 
class II obesity (P = .019), and 
class III obesity (P < .001) for both 
sexes, with all ages combined. The 
increasing linear trend from 1999 
to 2016 is most apparent among 
Hispanic females (Table 3). Similar 
to those of females, there are large 
increases in overweight and class 
II obesity among Hispanic males 
(Table 4). All 95% CIs are included 
in Supplemental Tables 5–9.
Differences From the last cycle
There are few differences in the 
prevalence of overweight and all 
classes of obesity since the last 
NHANES cycle, 2013–2014 and 
2016–2016. One exception is a sharp 
increase in the prevalence of class 
I obesity among 2- to 5-year-olds, 
particularly in young males. Another 
notable increase is for overweight, 
from 36% to 48%, in among older 
adolescent females. There were 
no other significant changes from 
the 2013–2014 and 2015–2016 
cycles for any of the race and/or

Despite reports that obesity in 
children and adolescents in the 
United States has stabilized in 
recent years, 
1 our more nuanced 
view highlights the continued 
upward trend for this nationally 
representative sample (Fig 1). 
Significant increases in obesity and 
severe obesity in children aged 2 
to 5 years and adolescent females 
aged 16 to 19 years from 2015 to 
2016, compared with previous years, 
show that obesity is increasing in 
these subgroups. Whether this year-
over-year change represents a trend 
remains to be seen because shifts per 
cycle can be large. We recommend 
that readers consider both the long-
term trends as well as changes over 
2-year cycles when considering the 
effects in specific populations.
The prevalence of childhood obesity 
in the United States remains high, 
with ∼1 in 5 children having obesity. 
By applying updated obesity 
classifications16 to data starting in 
the 1999–2000 cycle of the NHANES, 
there continue to be increases in 
most categories of obesity across 
all age groups. By age, adolescents 
have had a significantly increased 
prevalence across all obesity 
categories since the 1999–2000 cycle. 
Substantial racial-ethnic differences 
remain, with African Americans and 
Hispanics having a higher prevalence 
across nearly all classes of obesity 
and all years between 1999 and 
2016. Notably, Asian Americans have 
a much lower prevalence of obesity 
in all age and sex categories. There 
were few differences in obesity 
prevalence from the previous cycle 
(2013–2014), with the exception of 
Hispanic males, who saw significant 
increases, and boys ages 2 to 5 years, 
who have had a 40% increase in 
prevalence since 2011.
Despite intense clinical and public 
health focus on obesity and weight-
related behaviors during the past 
decade, obesity prevalence remains 
high, with scant evidence that these 
efforts are counteracting the personal 
and environmental forces that 
contribute to excess weight gain in 
children, at least on a national scope. 
These findings are disappointing in 
light of reported decreases in obesity 
prevalence in younger children,

which was the only age group as a 
whole to see a significant increase 
in prevalence since the 2013–2014

Downloaded from 
 NHANES cycle. Most disconcerting 
are the substantial disparities 
in obesity by race and ethnicity; 
statistical and clinical differences 
in prevalence between Hispanics 
and all other races are astounding, 
with nearly half of all Hispanic 
youth having overweight or obesity. 
Building on our previous work, 
5, 
 
6, 
12  
we have been able to document 
the steadily rising levels of severe 
obesity, modeled on adult criteria  
of class I, II, and III obesity, with the 
rise of children with severe  
obesity having been the most 
significant.
Public health efforts to address 
obesity in children have been 
extensive, from Michelle Obama’s 
Let's Move campaign to the American 
Academy of Pediatrics establishing 
a Section on Obesity in 2013 that 
is distinct from other groups in 
the academy as well as countless 
efforts led by states, hospitals, 
and communities. Despite these 
efforts, which may have had greater 
impact in defined populations, more 
resources are clearly necessary. 
The obesity epidemic is becoming 
endemic, and this decline in 
Americans’ health is occurring 
without impactful policy at the 
national level. Evidence-based efforts 
focused on policy, family-based 
change, and health improvement 
(versus weight loss alone) may 
take another decade to see positive 
results; effective prevention and 
treatment interventions remain 
undeveloped or have not been 
effectively disseminated, and more 
insight is needed into the moderators 
and mediators of excessive weight 
gain. Additionally, evidence that 
behaviors in high-risk groups start 
at a young age suggests that efforts 
need to focus early in children’s 
lives.22
There are few long-term studies of 
obesity development or treatment 
outcomes because this work 
is occurring in a Biggest Loser 
environment, with the focus being 
on short-term changes in weight 
that we are only beginning to see 
as an erroneous pursuit in adult 
populations.23 These efforts are 
hampered by declining research 
dollars, limited or nonexistent 
reimbursement for prevention and 
treatment, and difficulties in changing 
local and national policies that impact 
environmental health. Finally, there 
is some evidence of an association 
between poverty and obesity,

Downloaded from 
 children nationwide. Activities with 
the aim of decreasing the prevalence 
of childhood obesity should not cease 
but redouble as an effort to improve 
the health of children and families 
and stem the rising costs of health 
care in the United States.
There are several important 
limitations to note. First, the 
NHANES data are repeated cross-
sections and do not allow for 
the examination of within-child 
changes over time. However, this 
approach allows for a richer picture 
of obesity prevalence across the 
United States. A second limitation 
is that the sample sizes prevent 
detailed subgroup analyses. We 
present prevalence rates by age, 
sex, and race, but caution should 
be used when interpreting these 
results. Readers should consider 
the body of evidence rather than 
focusing on individual tests of 
significance. Finally, the inclusion 
of Asian Americans in this report 
highlights questions about the 
reference ranges that define obesity. 
The current reference charts were 
developed by using data from a 
more homogenous group than what 
is seen in the United States today. 
It is not clear if the definitions of 
obesity represent similar levels of 
adiposity across racial and ethnic 
groups or if they confer similar 
levels of health risk.
cOnclusIOns
Nationally representative 
data provided by the NHANES 
demonstrates clearly that childhood 
obesity continues to be a significant 
concern for the United States. The 
past 18 years have seen increases 
in the levels of severe obesity in 
all ages and populations despite 
increased attention and efforts across 
numerous domains of public health 
and individual care. Groups that 
are historically disenfranchised are 
affected the most by this epidemic, 
predicting increased morbidity 
across a lifetime. Previously reported 
improvements seen in younger 
children were either an anomaly 
or transient because national data 
presented here demonstrate a 
sharp increase from the last cycle. 
Present efforts must continue, as 
must innovation, research, and 
most importantly at this juncture, 
collaboration among clinicians, 
public health leaders, hospitals, and 
all levels of government.
