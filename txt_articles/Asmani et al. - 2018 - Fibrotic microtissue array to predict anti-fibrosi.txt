Fibrosis is a severe health problem characterized by progressive stiffening of tissues which
causes organ malfunction and failure. A major bottleneck in developing new anti-fibrosis
therapies is the lack of in vitro models that recapitulate dynamic changes in tissue mechanics
during fibrogenesis. Here we create membranous human lung microtissues to model key
biomechanical events occurred during lung fibrogenesis including progressive stiffening and
contraction of alveolar tissue, decline in alveolar tissue compliance and traction force-induced
bronchial dilation. With these capabilities, we provide proof of principle for using this fibrotic
tissue array for multi-parameter, phenotypic analysis of the therapeutic efficacy of two anti-
fibrosis drugs recently approved by the FDA. Preventative treatments with Pirfenidone and
Nintedanib reduce tissue contractility and prevent tissue stiffening and decline in tissue
compliance. In a therapeutic treatment regimen, both drugs restore tissue compliance. These
results highlight the pathophysiologically relevant modeling capability of our novel fibrotic
microtissue system.

ung fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or
radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis, frequently leads to
organ failure and death and currently has no cure1, 2.
Candidates for anti-fibrotic therapies such as inhibitors directed
against TGF-β and LoxL2 have been identified; however, trans-
lation of these laboratory discoveries into clinical practice is
facing major obstacles1,3. The main bottlenecks are slow pro-
gression of the disease, high cost and the need for large sample
sizes associated with animal studies and clinical trials. To justify
the development of new therapies in prolonged and expensive
clinical trials, in vitro screening assays are needed to provide early
evidence of the efficacy of anti-fibrotic therapies.
Progression of lung fibrosis is characterized by stiffening of the
membranous tissue that makes up the alveolar air sacs, caused by
the accumulation of highly contractile and collagen-producing
myofibroblasts4–6. To model the physio-pathological character-
istics of lung fibrosis in vitro, different experimental systems have
been developed. Planar 2D culture-based assays such as high-
content screening performed in multi-well plates offer image-
based, multi-parameter readout of fibrotic cellular markers, but
they have very limited capacity to measure or reproduce tissue
mechanics7–9. Centimeter-scale, thick-engineered tissues are not
suitable for the drug screening due to inherent low-throughput
and diffusional limitations10–12. Recently, microfabricated culture
systems such as organ-on-chip systems have emerged as high-
throughput and resource-saving approaches for drug screening13–
15. These systems, to some extent, mimic the structure and
composition of human tissues and allow to test drug responses
under in vivo-like conditions. In an existing lung-on-chip device,
an alveolar epithelial cell-lined air chamber and a capillary
endothelial cell-lined fluidic chamber is separated by a porous
silicone membrane to mimic the alveolar–capillary interface13.
This system is able to model inflammatory responses and pul-
monary edema and has been used to identify potential ther-
apeutics for edema16. However, extracellular matrix (ECM)
components are lacking in this construct which eliminates the
tissue remodeling aspect of fibrosis. This limits the capability of
this device to modulate and/or assess tissue mechanical properties
and reduces the utility in pulmonary fibrosis studies.
To address these limitations that are common to all planar cell
cultures adhering to 2D substrates, we and others have developed
arrays of 3D microtissues that are suspended over multiple flex-
ible poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) micropillars17–19. These
microtissues form through cell-mediated ECM remodeling and
undergo morphological and structural changes that are guided by
micropillar-defined mechanical boundary conditions. The sys-
tem’s ability to control tissue morphogenesis opens up possibi-
lities to engineer biomimetic tissue morphology and structures
that are important to tissue’s biological functions. Previous
designs focused on rod-shaped microtissues where uniaxial stress
was achieved to facilitate the alignment of cells along tissue’s
longitudinal axis. Such stress-mediated cell alignment has been
shown to promote the development and maturation of engi-
neered skeletal and cardiac muscles20–22. In another study, thick
microtissue mimicking the stromal tissue layer of the skin were
created to study the fibroblast migration during the closure of an
artificial wound opening20. However, these microtissue designs
do not recapitulate the thin, membranous morphology of lung
alveolar tissue. This specific architecture is important for the
development of pathological features in fibrotic lung, such as the
decline in tissue compliance and traction force-induced bronchial
dilation5,23.
By controlling the morphogenic process of suspended micro-
tissues, here we create membranous lung microtissues that reca-
pitulate key biomechanical properties of both healthy and fibrotic
lung alveolar tissues. The microtissue is composed of lung
fibroblast-populated collagen matrix that allows robust response
to fibrosis induction and therapy. We demonstrate pathological
transition of this originally compliant, membranous lung inter-
stitial microtissue to fibrotic stiff tissue, caused by contraction and
activation of myofibroblasts. Further integration of this fibrotic
microtissue with patterned stress distribution and tissue stretch-
ing allow the modeling of other pathological features of the
fibrotic lung, such as the decline in tissue compliance and traction
force-induced bronchial dilation. In proof of principle tests, we
then document the utility of this system for multi-parameter,
phenotypic analysis of the therapeutic efficacy of two FDA-
approved anti-fibrosis drugs, Pirfenidone and Nintedanib. While
Pirfenidone and Nintedanib have different inhibitory effects on
myofibroblast activation and tissue contractility in preventative
treatments, both drugs effectively inhibit fibrotic tissue stiffening
and decline in tissue compliance. Both anti-fibrosis drugs restore
tissue compliance to different degree in a therapeutic treatment
regimen. Together, these studies highlight the pathophysiologi-
cally relevant modeling capability of our innovative fibrotic
microtissue system. The application of this system will not only
expedite the efficacy analysis of anti-fibrotic therapies but also
help to unveil their potential mode of action.
Results
Development of arrays of membranous lung microtissues.
Human lung alveoli are interlinked air sacs, each surrounded by
membranous interstitial tissue with large surface area and small
thickness. This unique morphology, characterized by high span
length (S) to thickness (t) ratio that ranges from 30:1 to 50:1
(Fig. 1a)24,25, not only facilitates gas exchange but is also critical
to the development of pathological features during lung fibrosis.
To recapitulate this unique alveolar morphology, we created
membranous human lung microtissues by leveraging the dynamic
remodeling capability of a novel microtissue system (Fig. 1b).
Using finite element (FE) models, we first determined how
microtissue design, geometry, and boundary conditions will affect
the formation of membranous yet structurally stable microtissues.
We explored various microtissue designs, including a large-size,
multi-leaflet design that mimics the shape of multiple alveoli and
single-leaflet designs with varied sizes (Fig. 1c; Supplementary
Fig. 1). FE models of microtissues were constructed using a
constitutive formulation that allows for large tissue deformation
under cell-generated isotropic contractile force26. We showed that
under such contractile forces, tissue compacted freely through its
thickness (Z-axis, Supplementary Movie 1), but the compaction
in X–Y plane was restricted by micropillar-defined boundary
conditions, leading to stress concentration, a localized increase in
stress, around the micropillars (Supplementary Movie 2). We
observed that these high stresses dissipated towards the tissue
center along the diagonal axis of the microtissue, as shown by the
direction of the principal stress vectors in highlighted area
(Fig. 1c). Comparison between different microtissue designs
showed that although large-size and medium-size designs both
result in relatively high S/t ratios, which are ideal to model
alveolar tissues, they are associated with different levels of stress
concentrations that may affect the structural integrity of the
microtissues differently (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Figs. 1, 2).
Therefore, further experimental validation of these microtissue
designs is needed to determine their actual performance.

 microwells, cells started to spread and compact the ECM
(Supplementary Movie 3), leading to the formation of shape-
defined, membranous microtissues (Fig. 1d–f, Supplementary
Fig. 4). We observed that actin stress fibers of cells within the
leaflets of a multi-leaflet microtissue aligned along the diagonal
axis of the microtissue, matching with the direction of the
principal stress. This suggests that actomyosin-based cellular
contractility drove tissue morphogenesis under pre-defined
boundary conditions, as predicted by the FE model. Cross-
sectional
measurement
of
the
microtissue

a
thickness ranging from 35 to 55 µm. For a large-size, four-
leaflet microtissue with a diagonal span length of 1380 µm, the
resulting S/t ratio is 28:1, corresponding well to alveolar sac
geometry (Fig. 1g). In addition to the four-leaflet design (Fig. 1h),
we also tested large three-leaflet design (Fig. 1i; Supplementary
Fig. 4) and medium-size single-leaflet designs. While these
designs all supported the formation of microtissues, the rate of
microtissue failure, as measured by the rates of micropillar
breakage and microtissue detachment from the micropillar head,
increased with increased design complexity and microtissue size.
Therefore, we chose the medium-size, single-leaflet design for our
drug screening system to ensure robust performance and easy
handling. To enable parallel testing of multiple pharmacological
conditions, we created microtissue arrays in a 12-well plate
format with 8 × 8 microtissues per well and a total of 768
microtissues per plate (Fig. 1j, k). The large number of samples

 Recapitulation of tissue fibrogenesis in lung microtissues.
Progression of fibrosis in lung interstitial tissue involves tissue
stiffening and fibroblast activation into contractile myofibroblasts,
characterized by expression of smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).
Since TGF-β1 has been shown to play a key role in the devel-
opment of fibrosis5,27,28, we tested whether TGF- β1 induces
fibrosis
in
lung
fibroblast-populated
and
SAECs-populated
microtissues (Fig. 2a). Continuous TGF-β1 treatment for 6 days
induced strong expressions of α-SMA stress fibers and cytosolic
pro-collagen and substantial increase in the deposition of highly
aligned EDA fibronectin fibers in fibroblast-populated collagen
microtissues (Fig. 2b). Measured fluorescence intensities of α-
SMA, cytosolic pro-collagen, and EDA fibronectin in TGF-β1-
treated condition were approximately two to eight times higher
than those in untreated condition (Fig. 2c). These phenotypic
changes were associated with significant increase in the con-
tractile force generated by fibroblast-populated microtissues, as
demonstrated by micropillar deflections (Fig. 2d; Supplementary
Fig. 5). Time-lapsed force measurement showed that microtissue
contractile force continuously increased under TGF-β1 treatment
to around 210 µN over a 6 day culture period. In contrast, the
force developed by untreated samples plateaued after 2 days at
around 95 µN (Fig. 2e). Together, these measurements indicated
the
pathological
transition
of
fibroblast-populated
collagen
microtissue to a contractile state as a result of myofibroblast
differentiation.
In SAECs-populated collagen microtissues, we did not observe
significant increase in either the expression of biomarkers or the
contractile force in TGF-β1-treated samples (Supplementary
Figs. 6, 7), suggesting that airway epithelial cells are less
responsive to TGF-β1 induction29. Next, we tested the effects of
different ECM proteins on the fibrosis induction
of the
microtissues. Microtissues were fabricated using collagen, mixed
ECM of collagen and fibrin and mixed ECM of collagen and
matrigel, all populated with lung fibroblasts. There was no
significant difference in either the expression of biomarkers or the
contractile force between different ECM compositions with or
without TGF-β1 treatment (Supplementary Figs. 8, 9). Together,
these results showed that lung fibroblast-populated collagen
microtissue is a compositionally simple yet effective model for
lung interstitial fibrosis, and thus we chose this model for the
study of the efficacy of the anti-fibrosis drugs.
Significantly increased lung tissue stiffness, often manifested by
reduced lung interstitium compliance, is a major clinical indicator
and outcome of pulmonary fibrosis5. Reducing or halting the
decline in lung tissue compliance is used to evaluate efficacy of
anti-fibrosis drugs30,31. To characterize these mechanical proper-
ties of our microtissues, we measured compliance and stiffness

 using mechanical stretching-enabled tensile tests (Fig. 3a).
Stretching was performed in microtissue arrays casted on a thin,
transparent silicone substrate to be stretched on a motor-driven
loading frame (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 10). Owing to its
membranous morphology, the microtissue deformed uniformly
across its surface under stretching, mimicking the respiratory
distention of lung interstitial tissues32. In tensile tests, microtissue
strain was calculated as the tissue extension (ΔL1 + ΔL2) along the
stretch direction divided by original tissue length (L), and tensile
force was calculated based on the micropillar deflection caused by
stretching (F = k (δ1′ + δ2′)). Elastic modulus (E, stiffness) of the
microtissue was calculated as tensile stress divided by tensile
strain (Fig. 3c). Microtissue compliance was calculated as
stretching-induced tissue extension divided by tensile force
(Supplementary Fig. 11). As shown in Fig. 3d, induced extension
of TGF-β1-treated microtissues (ΔL1 + ΔL2) was less than that of
untreated microtissues (ΔL1′ + ΔL2′), indicating reduced com-
pliance for TGF-β1-treated samples (Fig. 3e). While the stiffness
of untreated microtissues was found to be 5.5 ± 2.8 kPa (mean ±
SD), matching that of healthy lung tissue33,34, the stiffness of
TGF-β1-treated tissues (24.0 ± 8.0 kPa) was substantially higher
and matched with those of human and mouse fibrotic lung tissues
(Fig. 3f)33,34. Hence, these alterations in the cellular phenotype,
ECM protein expression, and tissue mechanics reproduced
features of lung fibrosis in the human lung microtissues.
Modeling the biomechanics of traction bronchiectasis. In
fibrotic lung, traction bronchiectasis occurs when small bronchial
openings dilate due to traction force exerted by the surrounding
fibrotic tissue (Fig. 4a)23,35. To model this unique fibrosis feature
of the lung, we patterned stress concentrations to induce the
dilation of tissue openings in our engineered microtissues
(Fig. 4b). We first explored microtissue designs that will create
regions with high level of stress concentration. Using FE models,
we compared two square microtissue designs, supported on either
flexible (Fig. 4c) or rigid micropillars (Fig. 4d). Increased
micropillar rigidity restricted microtissue contraction on the
edges and thereby significantly increased the level of stress con-
centration around micropillars (Fig. 4c, d; Supplementary
Fig. 12). To further increase local stress levels, we designed a long
microtissue supported on rigid micropillars. The unique geo-
metry of the long microtissue with a high x/y aspect ratio of 8
resulted in the formation of a high stress band in the belly of the
microtissue (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Fig. 12). The uniaxial stress
filed in this band induced the dilation of openings in the
microtissue belly. In contrast, artificially created wound has been
found to heal in square microtissues where biaxial stress field
dominates20. To experimentally model the mechanical process of
traction bronchiectasis, lung fibroblast-populated long micro-
tissue was fabricated and then induced to fibrosis using TGF-β1
treatment (Fig. 4f). Continuous TGF-β1 treatment for 6 days
induced expression of α-SMA stress fibers across the entire
microtissue in addition to dilated tissue openings around the
micropillars and in the tissue center. However, these effects were
absent in untreated conditions (Fig. 4g; Supplementary Fig. 13).
Such differences observed in TGF-β1-treated and untreated

 conditions was predicted by FE models of identical geometry but
assigned with different levels of tissue contractility (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 13), suggesting that fibrosis-associated high tissue con-
tractility played a critical role in the formation of tissue openings.
This point was further validated by the matching distribution of
contractile myofibroblasts (Fig. 4h) and simulated principal ten-
sile stresses (Fig. 4i) around the tissue openings. Quantitative
measurement of microtissue area showed that tissue opening area
in TGF-β1-treated sample is significantly larger than that in
untreated sample at day 6 (Fig. 4j). Therefore, we propose to use
this measurement as a phenotypic parameter for the efficacy
analysis of anti-fibrosis drugs.

 microtissue array as fibrosis disease models for predicting the
efficacy of anti-fibrosis drugs in humans. Pirfenidone and Nin-
tedanib were selected for proof-of-concept as they are the only
anti-fibrosis drugs approved by FDA to treat IPF; both drugs were
shown to reduce the decline in lung compliance in IPF
patients30,31. We performed both preventative and therapeutic
treatments on diseased microtissue model using these drugs at
commonly used in vitro concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 14).

were then administered and remained to the end of experiment.

 Pirfenidone and Nintedanib inhibited myofibroblast activation
in a preventative anti-fibrosis treatment regimen to different
degrees. Expressions of α-SMA, pro-collagen, and EDA Fn were
increasingly inhibited by increasing pirfenidone concentrations
with maximum effect at 5.3 mM (Fig. 5b, c; Supplementary
Fig. 15). In contrast, Nintedanib inhibited the stress fiber
assembly but not fluorescence intensity of α-SMA at all
concentrations, and only high Nintedanib concentration (3 µM)
inhibited pro-collagen and EDA Fn expressions (Fig. 5b, c;
Supplementary Fig. 15). Only pirfenidone at 5.3 mM was found to
modestly affect cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Pirfenidone in high dosage (5.3 mM) almost entirely abolished
tissue contractility after 3 days culture in time-lapsed tissue
contractile
force
measurements
(Fig.
5d).
Loss
of
tissue
contractility was associated with severely reduced collagen ECM
compaction, as demonstrated by the microtissue area that is
larger than that of untreated samples (Supplementary Fig. 17a).
Low dosage pirfenidone (1.6 mM) was overall less effective but
was able to inhibit TGF-β1-induced force increase and maintain
the tissue force at a level similar to untreated sample (Fig. 5d).
Compared to pirfenidone, the inhibitory effect of Nintedanib on
contractile force was moderate (Fig. 5d), consistent with its
limited inhibition of TGF-β1-induced α-SMA expression in
myofibroblasts.
Despite
the
moderate
inhibition
on
tissue
contractile force, Nintedanib at 3 µM was able to substantially
inhibit the compaction of collagen ECM, as demonstrated by the
microtissue area that is larger than that of TGF-β1-treated
samples (Supplementary Fig. 17a). Since Nintedanib has been
shown to also act on the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
pathway36, we induced microtissue contraction using PDGF with
simultaneous
addition
of
Nintedanib.
Nintedanib
strongly
inhibited PDGF induced tissue contractility (Supplementary
Fig. 18), demonstrating the power of the assay to discriminate
between drug actions on different fibrosis pathways.
Next, we performed preventive anti-fibrosis treatments in long
microtissues to study drug effects on traction bronchiectasis-like
tissue opening formation. Pirfenidone at 5.3 mM almost com-
pletely inhibited TGF-β1-induced opening dilation (Fig. 5e, f;
Supplementary Fig. 19). This pirfenidone dosage also strongly
inhibited TGF-β1-induced tissue stiffness increase and compli-
ance decrease, and maintained tissue stiffness and compliance
comparable to untreated samples. Similar inhibitory effects on
tissue stiffness/compliance was also observed on Nintedanib at 3
µM (Fig. 5g, h; Supplementary Fig. 20).
For therapeutic drug treatments, i.e., treatments after onset of
fibrosis, we treated microtissues with TGF-β1 for 3 days, followed
by drug treatment for another 3 days in the absence of TGF-β1
(Fig. 6a). Removing TGF-β1 in the later 3 days alone (TGF-β1
+3/−3) had no effect on already-established α-SMA expression,
pro-collagen
expression
(Fig.
6b,
c),
EDA
Fn
expression
(Supplementary Fig. 21), tissue contractility (Fig. 6d), or tissue
stiffness (Fig. 6e) as compared to continuous TGF-β1 treatment
for 6 days. Pirfenidone at 5.3 mM but not at 1.6 mM significantly
reduced the expression of α-SMA, pro-collagen and EDA Fn
(Fig. 6b, c; Supplementary Fig. 20), tissue contractility (Fig. 6d),
and
collagen ECM compaction (Supplementary
Fig.
17b).
Nintedanib at 3 µM moderately reduced pro-collagen expression
but did not reduce the expression of α-SMA and EDA Fn (Fig. 6b,
c; Supplementary Fig. 21), tissue contractility (Fig. 6d) or collagen
ECM compaction (Supplementary Fig. 17b). Pirfenidone (5.3
mM) treatment also strongly reduced tissue stiffness by ~50%
after 3 days of therapeutic treatment (Fig. 6e). As a result,
fibrosis-induced decline in tissue compliance was rescued, and
compliance increased from 0.35 µm/µN at day 3 to 0.66 µm/µN at
day 6 (Fig. 6f). Together, these data showed the reversal of fibrosis
by pirfenidone treatment. We also observed 17% reduction in
tissue stiffness from day 3 to 6 by Nintedanib at 3 µM.
Correspondingly, the compliance increased from 0.35 µm/µN at
day 3 to 0.41 µm/µN at day 6 (Fig. 6e, f).
Discussion
Fibrosis is one of the leading causes of death in developed
countries, but effective medical therapies remain elusive30,31.
Even though several anti-fibrotic drug candidates, such as TGF-β
inhibitors, αvβ6 integrin blockers, IL-4 and IL-13 antibodies,
LoxL2 inhibitors and microRNAs, have been identified, the
clinical translation is slow due to the lengthy and costly nature of
the clinical trials1,2. The approval of Pirfenidone and Nintedanib
is a major progress in anti-fibrotic treatment, but these drugs are
only approved to treat IPF and the cost is high. Furthermore, the
mode of action of these drugs is not fully understood3,37,38.
Therefore, continued research and development of anti-fibrotic
treatments, including the screening and evaluation of new drugs
and repurposing of the existing drugs, is urgently needed. Here
we provide a human lung fibrotic microtissue array that allows
multi-parameter, phenotypic screening of the anti-fibrosis drug
candidates in a relatively high-throughput manner. The adoption
of the microtissue array format offers orders of magnitude scale-
up advantages over tissue biopsy samples and conventional
engineered
tissues10,11,
leading
to
improved
experimental
throughput. Further integration of the microtissue array with
multi-well plate enabled parallel analysis of multiple drug con-
ditions. In this system, all the measurements including those
performed on fluorescence intensity, tissue mechanical properties
and tissue opening formation were image-based and were per-
formed using a conventional epi-fluorescence microscope. The
easy readout of multiple physiologically relevant parameters from
a large sample population under a variety of biochemical treat-
ments makes this system well suited for the application of high-
content drug screening9.
Tissue fibrosis progresses along with substantial changes in the
tissue mechanics. While broadly used planar 2D cell assays can be
configured into high-throughput, high-content format and are
useful in the study of the molecular mechanisms of the anti-
fibrosis drugs7,36, they do not recapitulate the biomechanical

 changes occurred in the fibrotic tissue and organ. The contraction
of fibroblast/myofibroblast spheroids has been used as a pheno-
typic parameter in anti-fibrosis screening8,39; however, the lack of
morphological control and stiffness measurement of this model
resulted in limited prediction power and accuracy for drug effi-
cacy. Tissue slices prepared from different organs allowed the
study of anti-fibrosis drug efficacy on multiple cell types in well-
retained anatomical structures, but the low-throughput of this
model limited its application in drug screening40,41. The fibrotic
lung microtissue array system presented in the current study
recapitulated key biomechanical properties of both healthy and
fibrotic lung alveolar tissues, allowing for simultaneous bio-
chemical and biomechanical analysis of the efficacy of the anti-
fibrosis drugs; therefore, it represents a novel approach for drug
screening with improved physiological relevance, accuracy and
throughput. Due to the similar pathology between different
fibrotic diseases, the current fibrotic microtissue array system
can potentially be used to model the fibrotic disease in other
organ systems, such as liver cirrhosis, renal fibrosis and cardiac
fibrosis, and help to develop the anti-fibrosis treatment for these
diseases.
We tested the utility of this system for the prediction of anti-
fibrosis drug efficacy and showed results of Pirfenidone and
Nintedanib as a proof of principle. We showed that while these
two drugs displayed different degrees of inhibition of myofibro-
blast activation and tissue contractility, they both can effectively
inhibit tissue stiffening and the decline in tissue compliance
through potentially preventing cell-mediated ECM strain stif-
fening. Previous studies on reconstituted cell-laden collagen/
fibrin gels have shown that cell contraction pulls out thermal
bending undulations of the ECM fibril meshwork to cause
meshwork compaction and gel stiffening42,43, a phenomenon
broadly known as strain stiffening18,44,45. In this study, using
microtissue area as a measurement of ECM compaction, we
showed strong and moderate inhibition of TGF-β1-induced
microtissue contractility and ECM compaction by preventative
treatment with pirfenidone at 5.3 mM and Nintedanib at 3 µM,
respectively. In both cases, tissue stiffening was inhibited. These
data suggest that a threshold ECM compaction level, which is
similar to that of untreated samples, is critical to the inhibition of
microtissue stiffening, and tissue stiffening can be prevented if the
microtissue area is maintained equal to or larger than that of the
untreated sample (Supplementary Fig. 17). This finding started to
unveil the potential biomechanical mechanism of action of Pir-
fenidone and Nintedanib on fibrosis treatment. Future studies on
tissue mechanics such as tissue microstructure under the treat-
ment of these two drugs and other anti-fibrosis drugs will help to
deepen the understanding of the mode of action of anti-fibrosis
treatments.
The high span length to thickness ratio (S/t ratio) of the pre-
sented microtissues is critical to the modeling of the biomecha-
nical properties of both healthy and fibrotic lung interstitial
tissues. Like other cell-laden ECM hydrogels42,43, a microtissue
gains its stiffness through cell-contraction-mediated ECM com-
paction. During microtissue formation, the membraneous tissue
morphology formed because tissue compacted freely through its
thickness, but its compaction in the x–y plane was restricted by
the micropillars. In untreated condition, this resulted in a rela-
tively loosely compacted microtissue whose low tissue stiffness
(~5 kPa) matched to that of the in vivo lung tissue33,34. But under
TGF-β1 treatment, high contraction induced further tissue
compaction, as demonstrated by the reduced microtissue area
(Supplementary Fig. 17), resulted in the stiffness increase to
around 20 kPa, matching well with that of the fibrotic lung tis-
sue33,34. In the long microtissue that models the biomechanics of
traction bronchiectasis, the thin, membranous morphology of the
microtissue allowed easy dilation of tissue openings under
myofibroblasts-generated traction forces. The stretching of the
membranous tissue, which mimics forced alveolar distention32,
enabled mechanical tensile tests on the microtissue. These tests
allowed for the measurement of the stiffness and compliance of
the microtissues, which are major biomechanical parameters used
to assess the therapeutic efficacy of the anti-fibrosis drugs. Owing
to motorized control of the stretching system, it can be easily
adopted to apply long-term, cyclic stretching to the microtissue
array. Since cyclic loading has been shown to increase the bio-
mechanical activity of lung cells in 2D culture7,8, its application in
microtissue may shed new light on the study of anti-fibrosis
therapies. Furthermore, the current microtissue system can be
used to model the physiology and pathology of other membrane-
like tissue types, such as the fibrosis in the retina and intestinal
fibrosis associated with Crohns disease. Owing to the high level of
stress concentration generated around micropillars, currently
presented microtissue model for drug screening is limited to
medium-size and simple geometry. Future design improvements
that reduce stress concentration, potentially through increasing
the contact area between tissue and PDMS supports, could allow
the design and construction of microtissue models with more
complex geometry.
In conclusion, we have leveraged the unique remodeling cap-
ability of suspended microtissues to develop a fibrotic microtissue
array system that recapitulates the key aspects of fibrogenesis in
lung interstitial tissues. We utilized this system for predicting the
efficacy of anti-fibrosis drugs and showed the results of Pirfeni-
done and Nintedanib as a proof of principle. We showed that
while these two drugs acted differently on the fibrotic cells, they
are both effective in restoring the fibrotic tissue compliance. Such
findings across different length scales from cells to organ started
to unveil the potential mode of action of these anti-fibrosis drugs.
It is expected that the multiscale and pathophysiologically rele-
vant modeling capability of the fibrotic microtissue system will
expedite the translation of anti-fibrotic therapies from the
laboratories to the clinics. Future work that includes diseased lung
cells such as those isolated from IPF patients, vascular cells such
as pericytes, immune cells, and other ECM components such as
elastin may shed new light on the cell–ECM interaction involved
in fibrosis and further expand the physiological relevancy of the
current system.
Methods
Cell culture. Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were purchased
from Lonza and were maintained in manufacturer supplied growth medium
(FGM-2 BulletKit, CC3132, Lonza). NHLFs were cultured up to six passages with
media change every 3 days. Human primary SAEC (PCS-301-010, ATCC) were
maintained in manufacturer supplied growth medium (PCS-300-030 and PCS-300-
040, ATCC) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.
FE modeling of microtissue formation. FE model of the microtissues with various
geometries was constructed in FEBio46. Microtissue geometry was discretized by
3D quadratic tetrahedral elements capable of large deformation. The active con-
traction of the cell population was represented by a solid mixture constitutive
material consisting of a neo-Hookean solid component and an isotropic contractile
stress component26. The compressive neo-Hookean solid allows compaction of the
microtissue model under active contraction. In the comparison between four-leaflet
microtissue and single-leaflet microtissues, individual micropillars were considered
to be flexible (Fig. 1); but in the comparison between long microtissue and square
microtissues, micropillars in the long microtissue and rigidly-supported square
microtissue were considered to be rigid (Fig. 4). Simulated first principal stress
contour was plotted over deformed model geometry in the results, with overlaid
plot of stress vectors, where applicable. To compare the stress level in different
microtissue designs, the histograms of the first principal stress were plotted and
compared.
Micropillar device fabrication and microtissue seeding. The layout of the
micropillar array was designed based on FE models. Micropillar arrays were fab-
ricated using a multi-layer microlithography technique similar to that described

 previously18,19. Briefly, SU-8 masters were created through spin coating, alignment,
exposure and baking of multiple layers of SU-8 photoresists. The cross-sectional
difference between the micropillar head and leg sections was achieved through
depositing a thin layer of SU-8 doped with S1813 that served to prevent UV light
penetration to the leg section. UV exposure was performed on an OAI maskaligner
with a U-360 band pass filter. PDMS (Sylgard 184, DowCorning) stamps were
casted over the SU-8 master at 10:1 mixing ratio. Micropillar devices were then
produced through replica molding from stamps in P35 petridishes or 12 well plate.
Microtissue seeding was performed following a protocol previously established17,18.
Briefly, micropillar device was sterilized and treated with Pluronic F-127 (P2443,
Sigma) to prevent non-specific cell adhesion to the PDMS surface. NHLFs or
SAECs cells were mixed with collagen type-I (rat tail, Corning) at a final con-
centration of 3 mg/ml, and the mixture was introduced into the microwells through
centrifugation. Collagen solution was crosslinked and then maintained in appro-
priate growth media in a CO2 incubator. For the purpose of testing the combi-
nation of ECMs, NHLFs were mixed with either a ECM mixture containing
neutralized collagen (3 mg/ml) and 20% v/v Matrigel (356231, CORNING) or a
ECM mixture containing neutralized collagen (3 mg/ml) and 2.5 mg/ml human
Fibrinogen (FIB1, Enzyme Research Laboratories). The cell-laden ECM mixture
was then seeded and polymerized in a manner similar to cell-laden collagen.
Pharmacological treatment. Anti-fibrotic drugs Pirfenidone (P1871, TCI Amer-
ica) and Nintedanib (S1010, Selleckchem) were purchased from commercial sup-
pliers. In pharmacological tests, F-12k media (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with
2% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin was used as a base
medium and negative control for NHLF-populated microtissues. To induce myo-
fibroblast differentiation of the NHLFs, 5 ng/ml of TGF-β1 (T5050, Sigma) was
added to the base media and maintained for different durations. Pirfenidone at 1.6
and 5.3 mM and Nintedanib at 0.5 and 3 µM were used in two treatment
approaches. For direct comparison, the high concentrations we selected for both
drugs are approximately 50 times of their concentrations in human plasma47.
These concentrations were broadly used in previous in vitro studies and are not
toxic to cultured cells36,38,47. The absorption of drugs by PDMS is negligible
(Supplementary Note 1). In preventative treatment, anti-fibrosis drugs were co-
administered with TGF- β1 at the beginning of microtissue formation and main-
tained for 6 days, and in therapeutic treatment TGF-β1-induced fibrosis was
allowed to progress for the first 3 days and TGF-β1 was removed, and anti-fibrosis
drugs were then administered and remained for another 3 days. In SAEC-
populated microtissues, manufacturer supplied basal medium (PCS-300-030,
ATCC) supplemented with 1% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml strepto-
mycin was used as a base medium and negative control. 5 ng/ml of TGF-β1 was
added to the base media for the fibrosis induction of SAEC-populated microtissues.
Live/dead assay was performed to examine the effects of anti-fibrosis drugs on lung
fibroblast viability.
Microtissue contraction force measurement. The spontaneous contraction force
generated by individual microtissues was determined from the deflection of
micropillars based on cantilever bending theory (Supplementary Fig. 5). Micro-
pillar deflection was measured using phase contrast microscopy, by comparing the
deflected position of the centroid of each pillar top to the centroid of its base.
Microtissue contraction force was measured for the same batch of samples on a
daily basis for each pharmacological condition. Image analysis was performed in
ImageJ and the absolute values of calculated force from each micropillar were
added up and divided by 2 to reflect the collective force generated by one
microtissue. Micropillar’s spring constant, which is 0.66 µN/µm for flexible
micropillars in four-leaflet microtissue and single-leaflet square microtissues and
1.99 µN/µm about x axis and 7.94 µN/µm about y axis for rigid micropillars in long
microtissues, was determined based on the actual geometry of the micropillar and
the elastic modulus of the PDMS.
Stretching of microtissue array. A mechanical stretching system has been
developed to stretch membranous lung microtissues, which mimics the respiratory
motion of lung interstitial tissues. A transparent stretchable silicone substrate (SMI
silicone sheeting, 0.01-inch NRV G/G 40D, Saginaw, MI) was mounted on a
custom-made loading frame driven by a DC motor controlled by an Arduino
microcontroller. The stretchable substrate was fixed at one end and was allowed to
move at the other end. By controlling the displacement of the moving end, we were
able to achieve single step stretching or cyclic stretching of the microtissue device.
The mounting fixture allows the silicone substrate to be lowered to close to the
bottom of a P100 petri-dish, enabling real-time measurement of the microtissue
deformation and micropillar deflection of multiple microtissues through optical
imaging. Before stretching, empty microtissue array device was casted on the
silicone substrate, and microtissue seeding and culture were performed following
the same procedure as described in earlier sections. All microtissues in each 8 × 8
array were stretched simultaneously, which represents a significantly higher
throughput than conventional tissue stretching experiments. The tensile strain
transfer from the silicone substrate to microtissue and the strain variation across
different microtissue samples were characterized, and consistent tensile strain has
been found in individual microtissues across different regions of the device.
Microtissue stiffness and compliance measurement. Tensile tests were per-
formed using the stretching system on untreated, TGF-β1-treated and anti-fibrosis
drug treated microtissues to measure their stiffness and compliance. After 6 days of
culture, microtissue array-mounted silicone substrate was mounted on the
stretching machine and was stretched to 120% of initial length. Phase images of the
microtissue and the micropillars before and after tensile test were taken. Micro-
tissue strain was calculated as the tissue extension (ΔL1 + ΔL2) along the tensile
direction divided by original tissue length (L) (Fig. 3c). Stretching-induced tensile
force was calculated based on the micropillar deflection caused by stretching (F = k
(δ1′ + δ2′)) (Fig. 3c). Summation of the tensile forces from all micropillars was
divided by 2 and then divided by the cross-section area of the microtissue to obtain
the tensile stress. Elastic modulus (E, stiffness) was calculated as tensile stress
divided by tensile strain. The thickness of microtissues was obtained using confocal
microscopy. Microtissue compliance was calculated as stretching-induced tissue
extension (ΔL1 + ΔL2) divided by tensile force (F).
Immunofluorescence and image analysis. Human lung cell-populated micro-
tissues were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized by cold methanol at −20 °
C, blocked by 3% BSA, incubated with primary antibodies against α-smooth muscle
actin (Abcam, ab7817, 1:300), pro-collagen type-I (Millipore, MAB1913-C, 1:400),
EDA-Fibronectin (Abcam, ab6328, 1:400) and rat collagen type-I (Millipore,
AB755P, 1:300), and labeled with fluorophore-conjugated, anti-IgG antibodies
(Thermo Fisher, AlexaFluor, 1:400). The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst
33342 (Thermo Fisher, 1:1000). To measure the fluorescence intensity of α-SMA
and pro-collagen type-I in different microtissues under varied pharmacological
conditions, images were taken on a Nikon Ti-U microscope equipped with a
Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera using 10× Plan Fluor objective under iden-
tical imaging condition. Fluorescence intensity was measured in ImageJ by taking
the integrated intensity of a region of interest bounded by the inner edge of
micropillars and then subtracting the background intensity. Fluorescence intensity
was normalized by the cell number in each microtissue. Confocal images of the
microtissue were taken on an Andor Technology DSD2 confocal unit coupled to an
Olympus IX-81 motorized inverted microscope equipped with Plan-Apochromat
×10 air objective. Optical slice of 1 μm was used for all channels. The stack of
images was processed using the Z stack tool in ImageJ to obtain the projected 2D
views.
Scanning electron microscopy. The microdevices seeded with normal HLFs were
fixed using 2% glutaraldehyde (ACROS organics) for 1.5 h. Next they were dehy-
drated through series of ethanol treatment at 15, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%. Finally,
Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, Alfa Aesar) was added to the samples to prepare
them for SEM. The SEM was done with the Hitachi SU70 Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscope (FESEM).
Statistics. Data are presented as the mean with error bars showing the standard
deviation (SD). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (Minitab 17 software).
Significance difference was verified by the post-hoc Tukey method with certainty of
P < 0.05 unless otherwise mentioned.
Data availability. All data supporting the findings of this study are available within
the article and its supplementary information files or from the corresponding
