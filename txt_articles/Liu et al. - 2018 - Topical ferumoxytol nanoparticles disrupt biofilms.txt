Ferumoxytol is a nanoparticle formulation approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration for systemic use to treat iron deficiency. Here, we show that, in addition, ferumoxytol
disrupts intractable oral biofilms and prevents tooth decay (dental caries) via intrinsic
peroxidase-like activity. Ferumoxytol binds within the biofilm ultrastructure and generates
free radicals from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), causing in situ bacterial death via cell mem-
brane disruption and extracellular polymeric substances matrix degradation. In combination
with low concentrations of H2O2, ferumoxytol inhibits biofilm accumulation on natural teeth
in a human-derived ex vivo biofilm model, and prevents acid damage of the mineralized
tissue. Topical oral treatment with ferumoxytol and H2O2 suppresses the development
of dental caries in vivo, preventing the onset of severe tooth decay (cavities) in a rodent
model of the disease. Microbiome and histological analyses show no adverse effects on oral
microbiota diversity, and gingival and mucosal tissues. Our results reveal a new biomedical
application for ferumoxytol as topical treatment of a prevalent and costly biofilm-induced
oral disease.

ne of the first nanoparticle formulations to be Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for clinical use
was an iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent for mag-
netic resonance imaging (Feridex), while another similar pre-
paration (ferumoxytol) was subsequently approved for treatment
of iron deficiency1–3. Recently, additional biomedical applications
have started to emerge for experimental iron oxide nanoparticles,
including tumor prevention and biofilm disruption4,5. Most
human infections are caused by microbial biofilms that are
notoriously challenging to remove or treat because the micro-
organisms are embedded in a protective matrix of extracellular
polymeric substances, such as exopolysaccharides (EPS)6,7. The
matrix reduces drug access, triggers bacterial drug tolerance,
while enhancing the mechanical stability of the biofilm6,7.
Therefore, more effective antiinfective therapies will need to
target the biofilm matrix, as well as the individual microbial cells
within.
Dental caries is a classic biofilm-induced disease that causes the
destruction of the mineralized tooth tissue8. It remains the most
prevalent human health condition affecting 3.5 billion people
globally, mostly underprivileged children and families, costing >
$120 billion in the USA alone9,10. In particular, severe childhood
tooth decay is often associated with iron deficiency anemia,
posing a serious public health challenge10–13. The disease-causing
biofilms develop when pathogens such as Streptococcus mutans
and other cariogenic bacteria assemble an extracellular matrix
rich in EPS and acidify the biofilm microenvironment14. The
bacteria embedded in the biofilm matrix produce highly acidic
microenvironments with pH values close to 4.5, which erode the
tooth apatite leading to the onset of dental caries. Current anti-
microbials and clinical modalities are incapable of degrading EPS,
and have limited killing activity against biofilm cells7. New
therapeutic strategies that could activate substances in situ to
target the vital structural and biological traits of biofilms, e.g., the
matrix and embedded cells in acidic pH conditions may lead to
localized effects without damaging the surrounding tissues.
Experimental iron oxide nanoparticles have been shown to
exhibit an intriguing enzyme mimetic activity5,15,16. These cata-
lytic nanoparticles have high peroxidase-like activity at patho-
genic acidic pH values, thereby locally activating free-radical
generation from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to provide anti-
biofilm effects17. Thus, the catalytic properties of nanoparticles
can be exploited to achieve a more focused and biofilm-specific
antiinfective therapy. However, the potential for catalytic-
therapeutic action has been largely assumed to be absent when
formulated for medical use (e.g., ferumoxytol) due to passivating
coatings5. Interestingly, a recent study reported that ferumoxytol
nanoparticles, administered systemically, inhibited tumor growth
in mice by enhancing the production of macrophage associated
reactive oxygen species4.
Here,
we
show
that
ferumoxytol
can
display
intrinsic
peroxidase-like
properties
in
a
pH-dependent
manner,
be
retained within biofilm following topical treatment, and provide
localized catalytic activity to prevent a costly and prevalent oral
disease in vivo. Time-lapsed studies reveal that ferumoxytol
nanoparticles efficiently catalyze H2O2 under acidic condition for
simultaneous bacterial killing and breakdown of EPS structure.
The nanoparticles bind within the biofilm ultrastructure, causing
bacterial membrane damage and polymer matrix degradation
in situ upon exposure to low concentrations of H2O2. Using
ex vivo biofilm and rodent models of severe early childhood
caries, we find that topically applied ferumoxytol effectively
suppresses biofilm accumulation and acid damage of the enamel
surface, thereby preventing the onset of tooth cavitation without
impacting the surrounding mucosal tissues and oral microbiota
in vivo. Considering that ferumoxytol has been used off-label for
treatment of iron deficiency in pediatric population18, its use
against biofilms could be directly clinically applicable as a novel
topical agent to prevent childhood dental caries.
Results
Catalytic properties and in vitro bioactivity of ferumoxytol.
Ferumoxytol is a nanoparticle comprised of iron oxide cores
coated
with
carboxymethyl-dextran.
Transmission
electron
microscopy (TEM) shows the cores of ferumoxytol to be some-
what amorphous and 7.15 ± 0.95 nm in diameter (Fig. 1a). The
negative staining indicated that the coating was 1.71 ± 0.47 nm
thick. It has a hydrodynamic diameter of 23.0 ± 0.7 nm as
determined by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 1a). In addition, we
determined that for every 1 mg of iron in ferumoxytol, there is
1.06 ± 0.07 mg of carboxymethyl-dextran (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The enzyme-like properties of ferumoxytol are illustrated in
Fig. 1b–e. Ferumoxytol can rapidly catalyze H2O2, displaying
peroxidase-like functionality in a pH-dependent manner as
determined by a colorimetric method using 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-
methylbenzidine (TMB). The hydroxyl radicals produced from
H2O2 can oxidize colorless TMB (which serves as a peroxidase
substrate) to blue colored reaction products whose concentration
can be assayed by measuring the absorbance at 652 nm16.
To determine the effect of pH on this observed peroxidase-like
activity, ferumoxytol nanoparticles were incubated with TMB at
several pH values (4.5–6.5). The absorbance of these solutions
upon the addition of H2O2 is plotted against time in Fig. 1b, and
photographs in the inset of Fig. 1b shows the color changes in
each condition. Clearly, the ferumoxytol catalytic action is high at
acidic
pH
(4.5),
but
is
minimal
at
pH
6.5
(Fig.
1b).
Michaelis–Menten steady-state kinetics of ferumoxytol iron
nanoparticles were also determined (Fig. 1b inset). The data
were plotted against the corresponding concentrations of H2O2
and fitted to a Michaelis–Menten curve. The Km value of
ferumoxytol for H2O2 is 40.89 µM, indicating strong catalytic
property (peroxidase-like activity), which is several folds better
than that for horseradish peroxidase (HRP)16, suggesting that
ferumoxytol has a much higher affinity for H2O2 than HRP. Next,
we studied the peroxidase-like activity of ferumoxytol at different
concentrations (Fig. 1c). We found that ferumoxytol highly
catalyzes the reaction of the substrate in the presence of H2O2 for
each concentration (0.1–1 mg ml−1) showing increasing perfor-
mance with concentration. In addition, the catalytic activity of
ferumoxytol at pH 6.5 is negligible compared to acidic pH at all
concentrations tested.
We also examined whether the activation of H2O2 by
ferumoxytol is due to catalytic activity from nanoparticles
themselves or from released iron ions via the Fenton reaction.
We found only trace amounts of free iron ions leached from
ferumoxytol in acidic pH buffer (pH 4.5, Fig. 1d). Importantly,
the catalytic activity of the solution phase is low (Fig. 1e), showing
that
the
observed
activity
is
primarily
derived
from
the
nanoparticle itself. Thus, ferumoxytol displays high catalytic
activity despite the presence of carboxymethyl-dextran coating.
To further understand the role of carboxymethyl-dextran, we
performed experiments using iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) of
similar core size to ferumoxytol, that were coated with citrate, a
labile coating molecule that should allow reagents access to the
IONP surface. As expected, citrate-coated IONP had higher
catalytic activity than ferumoxytol due to better access to the
IONP surface16 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Carboxymethyl-dextran
alone had negligible catalytic activity and its addition did not
affect the activity of the citrate-coated IONP.
The ferumoxytol activation of H2O2 indicated that it could,
therefore, function as a bacterial killing and EPS degrading

 system for targeting the acidic biofilm microenvironment. To
assess the bioactivity of ferumoxytol-mediated H2O2 catalysis, we
conducted high-resolution time-lapsed imaging using fluores-
cently labelled bacterial cells (Streptococcus mutans) and insoluble
α-glucans (Fig. 2). Ferumoxytol (1 mg ml−1) was added to an
actively growing bacterial cells suspension followed by exposure
to H2O2 at a concentration of 1%, under acidic (4.5) or near
neutral pH (6.5) conditions. To visually observe the distribution
of viable and dead bacteria, intact S. mutans cells were labelled
with SYTO 60 and propidium iodide (PI) was used to determine
bacterial killing over time at the single-cell level. The fluorescence
images show that S. mutans viability was affected as early as

Bacterial cells are labelled in blue by SYTO 60 and the purple
color indicates dead cells labelled by PI, a cell-impermeant
molecule that can only enter cells with damaged membranes,
rapidly gaining intracellular access following treatment (Fig. 2a).
Conversely, S. mutans cells remained mostly viable at pH 6.5
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). In addition, close-up views of individual
bacterial
cells
with
high
magnification
show
ferumoxytol
nanoparticles (labelled with Alexa Fluor 488, in yellow) located
on the cell surface (Fig. 2b, c).
Insoluble glucans are key virulence factors as they form the
core of the extracellular matrix in cariogenic biofilms14. Thus, we
also assessed whether these EPS can be broken down following
incubation with ferumoxytol and H2O2. The EPS were labelled by
Alexa Fluor 647-dextran conjugate during glucan synthesis as
detailed previously19, allowing structure visualization and degra-
dation monitoring via time-lapse imaging. As shown in Fig. 2d,
the glucans (in red) were readily degraded when exposed to
ferumoxytol and H2O2 in acidic pH. To further understand the
EPS breakdown process over time, we applied computational
analysis that generates geometrical scaffolds based on connectiv-
ity, topology, and length of the glucan structure. Intact glucans
show a web-like structure, forming a meshwork of interwoven
“EPS filaments” (Fig. 2d, blue lines). However, after exposure to
ferumoxytol and H2O2, we observed gradual dismantling of the
matrix structure by degrading the interconnected branches (see
white arrowheads), resulting in a smaller EPS core with most of
the shorter fragments completely degraded after 40 min (Fig. 2d).
Comparatively, EPS glucans remained structurally intact when
incubated with ferumoxytol and H2O2 at pH 6.5 (Supplementary
Fig. 3b). These results indicate efficient bacterial killing with EPS
degrading capabilities when ferumoxytol-mediated H2O2 catalysis
is triggered at acidic pH.
Antibiofilm activity of ferumoxytol in vitro. Localized biological
efficacy requires retention of ferumoxytol within biofilm struc-
tures and bioactivity in pathological (acidic) microenvironment.
S. mutans, an established biofilm-forming, acidogenic, and EPS-
producing oral pathogen14, was used to form biofilms on saliva-
coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) surfaces (tooth enamel-like mate-
rials) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The retention and catalytic activity
of ferumoxytol within biofilms were determined following topical
treatments. To mimic a pathogenic situation, biofilms were
formed in the presence of sucrose, which provides a substrate for
EPS synthesis and acid production. The pH values in our model
reach ~4.5, congruent with human plaque-biofilm pH at sites of
active caries20,21. We used this model to determine both the
amounts of ferumoxytol bound to biofilms and their peroxidase-
like activity in situ.
Quantitative analysis via inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) shows that the amount of
ferumoxytol bound to biofilms increased in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, we examined whether the
nanoparticles bound within biofilms are catalytically active.
Consistent with the amount of ferumoxytol adsorbed within the
biofilm, the highest catalytic activity was achieved at concentra-
tion 1 mg ml−1 under the conditions tested (Fig. 3b). The
representative photograph in Fig. 3c shows the color change
caused by TMB oxidation (blue) in a biofilm treated with
ferumoxytol 30 min after H2O2 addition, similarly to the
nanoparticles in solution. Moreover, scanning electron micro-
scopy with corresponding elemental mapping was conducted for
analysis of ferumoxytol content within biofilm structures (Fig. 3d).
These data show that Fe element is distributed throughout the
biofilm structure, indicating the effective binding of ferumoxytol.
We have also examined biofilms grown without sucrose to assess
ferumoxytol accumulation in nonpathogenic conditions. As
expected, the resulting lack of EPS caused reduced biomass and
negligible amounts of ferumoxytol binding and minimal catalytic
activity (below detection level; Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition,
we
used
citrate-coated
IONP
to
examine
whether
the
carboxymethyl-dextran coating of ferumoxytol would play a
protective role to the iron oxide core to help maintain catalytic
activity in the presence of the EPS matrix. We found that the
activity of citrate-coated IONP mixed with carboxymethyl-
dextran was better than that of citrate-coated IONP alone
(Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting a beneficial role of dextran-
coating for the catalytic activity of the nanoparticle within the
biofilm structure.
To examine ferumoxytol binding in situ, we employed TEM
and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to visually observe and
confirm the nanoparticles within the biofilm ultrastructure.
Cross-sectional images of a control biofilm show abundant
extracellular matrix (Fig. 4a: white box is a representative area of
EPS) containing strands of fibrilar polysaccharides (white arrow-
heads) interspersed with amorphous substances surrounding
individual bacterial cells similar to those observed in dental
biofilms;22 no Fe signal is detected by EDS in control biofilms
(Fig. 4b). In biofilms treated with ferumoxytol, we observed
electron-dense nanoparticle-like structures associated with the
extracellular matrix (Fig. 4a yellow box and yellow arrowheads).
The existence of Fe signals is found in the EDS spectra of
ferumoxytol-treated biofilm (Fig. 4b), consistent with ferumox-
ytol localization in the biofilms as determined by the elemental

3d),
additionally
illustrating
the
successful
incorporation of ferumoxytol into biofilms following topical
treatment.
Considering the effective ferumoxytol binding and catalytic
activity within biofilms, we investigated whether the bound
nanoparticles could catalyze H2O2 to breakdown the EPS matrix
and kill the embedded bacteria in situ. TEM analysis of
ferumoxytol-treated biofilms followed by H2O2 exposure reveals
physical disruption of bacterial cell membranes and extrusion of
the intracellular content (Fig. 4a, red box and red arrowheads).
This is consistent with membrane damage caused by free radicals
via lipid peroxidation23,24 and PI labelling of membrane-
compromised S. mutans cells as observed via confocal imaging
(Fig. 2a). Moreover, the matrices of the treated biofilms are highly
degraded and devoid of structured and fibrilar polysaccharides,
while mostly amorphous and scattered EPS were observed in the
TEM images (Fig. 4a). In marked contrast, the biofilms treated
with vehicle control or ferumoxytol alone were intact without
significant disruption of either bacteria or EPS matrix (Fig. 4a).
To further confirm the bioactivity of ferumoxytol, the number
of viable cells and EPS content were determined in the treated
biofilms (Fig. 4c, d). The results show potent biocidal activity
against S. mutans within biofilm, with >99.9% killing in 5 min
(Fig. 4c). Consistent with biofilm binding and catalytic activity,
ferumoxytol at 1 mg ml−1 was most effective with 1% H2O2
(Supplementary Fig. 4b–c, P < 0.01–0.001 by paired t test) causing
>6-log reduction of viable cells compared to vehicle control and
>1000-fold more effective than H2O2 alone (Fig. 4c, P <
0.01–0.001
by
paired
t
test).
Importantly,
the
treatment
significantly reduced the amount of insoluble glucans compared
to control and to H2O2 or ferumoxytol alone, further indicating
the EPS-degrading capability of ferumoxytol-mediated H2O2
catalysis (Fig. 4d, P < 0.001 by paired t test). Horseradish
peroxidase and glucanohydrolases were also tested as additional

 controls. As expected, peroxidase (at equivalent activity to
ferumoxytol) catalyzed H2O2 to kill planktonic bacteria (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7a), while glucanohydrolases digested insoluble
glucans (Supplementary Fig. 7b) in our test system, thereby
confirming that ferumoxytol-mediated H2O2 catalysis exhibit
both antibacterial and EPS degradation properties. However,
experiments performed in biofilms also highlighted the advan-
tages of ferumoxytol, given the lack of antibacterial activity of
glucanohydrolases25 and low efficacy of peroxidase in biofilms
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The limited peroxidase bioactivity may be
due to the poor stability of natural enzymes (vs. inorganic enzyme
mimetics) when exogenously added in biological systems5,15.
Altogether, the data indicate that ferumoxytol is retained in
biofilms following topical exposure, and display pH-dependent
catalysis of H2O2 in situ, which can enhance killing potency
against the embedded bacteria and degrade the EPS matrix under
acidic conditions.
Disruption of ex vivo biofilms and human enamel deminer-
alization. We next developed a combination therapy consisting of
topical application of ferumoxytol (at 1 mg ml−1) immediately
followed by H2O2 (at 1%) exposure, twice daily to simulate oral
use. Using this treatment regimen, our preliminary studies show
that topical ferumoxytol with H2O2 exposure strongly disrupted
S. mutans biofilm accumulation on sHA surfaces (Supplementary
Fig. 9, P < 0.001 by paired t test). To gain further insight into the
therapeutic potential of our approach, we used an ex vivo human
biofilm model to assess whether ferumoxytol/H2O2 can disrupt
cariogenic biofilm and prevent enamel surface damage. In this
model, plaque-biofilm samples were collected from diseased
patients affected by severe childhood caries, and inoculated for
biofilm development on natural human tooth-enamel (see dia-
gram in Fig. 5a). The microscale spatial distribution and struc-
tural organization of the biofilm components were determined via
a multilabeling approach using total bacteria and S. mutans
specific fluorescent probes, with EPS-matrix labeling via an Alexa
Fluor 647-dextran conjugate. The control human-derived bio-
films had ‘dome-shaped’ bacterial clusters (in blue) spatially
arranged with EPS (in red) matrix (Fig. 5b) that are typically
found when grown under cariogenic conditions in the presence of
sucrose. Cross-sectional confocal images reveal localized bacterial
aggregates comprised mostly of S. mutans cells (in green, Fig. 5b
bacteria panel) that are surrounded by an interconnected EPS-
matrix (in red, Fig. 5b EPS panel) forming cohesive and densely
packed microbial structure. In a sharp contrast, only small cell
clusters with sparsely distributed EPS were detected in the fer-
umoxytol/H2O2 treatment group (Fig. 5f).
The striking differences in both bacterial density and structural
organization could inflict differential damage of the mineralized
tooth tissue underneath the distinctive biofilms. Macroscopically,
we observed large areas of enamel surface demineralization in the
control group; close-up views show chalky and white spot-like
demineralization, similar to early caries lesions seen clinically
(Fig. 5c). In contrast, the enamel surface from ferumoxytol/H2O2
treatment was essentially devoid of such opaque demineralized
areas (Fig. 5g). The observed visual differences were confirmed
with confocal topography imaging and transversal microradio-
graphy analysis. The enamel surfaces from the control group have
eroded forming micro-cavities resulting in ~10 times higher
surface roughness (Sa values) than that treated with ferumoxytol/
H2O2, whose enamel surface was mostly intact and smooth
(Fig. 5e, i). Importantly, the lesion depth as determined by
microradiography is significantly deeper in the control group (vs.
ferumoxytol/H2O2 group, Fig. 5d, h, P < 0.01 by paired t test).
Collectively, these findings reveal that ferumoxytol-mediated
H2O2 catalysis can potently disrupt the development of cariogenic
biofilms and prevent localized demineralization and caries-like
lesions on tooth-enamel surface.
In vivo inhibition of dental caries. We next sought to determine
whether topical ferumoxytol/H2O2 treatment could suppress
tooth decay using an established rodent model that mimics the
characteristics of severe early childhood caries, including S.
mutans infection of rat pups and protracted feeding of sugar-rich
diet26. We simulated the conditions that might be experienced
clinically in humans by applying the test agent solutions topically
(orally delivered; 100 μl per animal) twice daily with a brief, 1min
exposure time (Fig. 6a)27 to mimic the use of a mouthwash. Using
this treatment regimen, we assessed the incidence and severity of
caries lesions on teeth of rat pups. During the 3-week experi-
mental period, the rats remained in apparent good health and no
significant differences in body weights between control and all
test groups were detected (Fig. 6b). Treatments with ferumoxytol/
H2O2 resulted in potent suppression of caries development at all
relevant sites (both smooth and sulcal surfaces).
Quantitative caries scoring analyses reveal that ferumoxytol/
H2O2 greatly attenuated the initiation and severity of caries
lesions (vs. vehicle control, Fig. 6c, P < 0.001 by one way ANOVA
with post hoc Tukey HSD test), and completely blocked extensive
enamel damage, preventing the onset of cavitation on both
smooth and sulcal dental surfaces. Furthermore, the efficacy of
combination therapy was significantly higher than H2O2 or
ferumoxytol alone (P < 0.05–0.001 by one way ANOVA with post
hoc Tukey HSD test), reducing more effectively the number and
severity of caries lesions, supporting the catalytic-therapeutic
mechanism of ferumoxytol activation of H2O2. We also observed
proportionally greater effects on moderate and extensive carious
lesions than on initial caries, which may be related to the
conditions mimicking severe childhood caries. Considering the
dynamics of caries development, it is possible that the effects on
less severe lesions could have been observed at earlier time points.
It is also noteworthy that ferumoxytol targets the biofilm and
inclusion of agents that interfere with demineralization and
enhance remineralization, such as fluoride, could enhance the
therapeutic effects on initial carious lesions.
To evaluate the overall effects on oral microbiota and
surrounding tissues after 21 days of topical treatment, the
microbiome sequencing and histopathological images of soft oral
tissues are presented in Fig. 7. All treatment groups showed
similar oral microbial composition (Fig. 7a) with no significant
differences in alpha diversity among each other (Fig. 7b; P > 0.05
by Wilcoxon rank sum test), suggesting our treatments did not
disrupt the ecological balance of the microbiota. Interestingly,
weighted Unifrac distances analyzed of principal coordinate
analysis (PCoA) by treatment groups revealed that ferumoxytol/
H2O2 group has similar composition with lowest dispersion
(Fig. 7c, blue dots; P < 0.001 by PERMANOVA test) than other
groups. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images of gingival and
palatal tissues from all experimental groups showed no visible
signs of harmful effects, such as proliferative changes, inflamma-
tory responses, or necrosis (Fig. 7d), indicating high histocom-
patibility of ferumoxytol/H2O2 treatment. Taken together, the
data
show
that
topical
ferumoxytol/H2O2
treatments
can
efficiently suppress the development of a costly and prevalent
oral disease without affecting the oral microbiota composition or
showing deleterious effects in the surrounding soft-tissues in vivo.

severe tooth decay under a topical treatment regimen. We found
an
alternate
catalytic-therapeutic
mechanism
governed
by
intrinsic “peroxidase-like” activity, which can be achieved with
low doses of topical ferumoxytol with H2O2 applications.
Importantly, this mechanism is pH-dependent so that the
catalysis is activated under the specific acidic pH values found in
cariogenic biofilms but attenuated at pH values close to neutral
(physiological), avoiding unmitigated free radical production.
Ferumoxytol retained within biofilms can locally activate H2O2
for in situ bacterial killing via membrane disruption and EPS
matrix degradation through glucan structure cleavage. Such

 properties thwarted cariogenic biofilm accumulation and pre-
vented enamel surface damage, suppressing the onset of severe
caries lesions, without deleterious side effects in vivo. This ther-
apeutic approach may have broader reach as EPS are important
components of matrices in most biofilms6 and acidic pH
microenvironments can be found in other pathological condi-
tions, such as in cystic fibrosis and Staphylococcal infections28,29.
Thus, exploitation of catalytic actions by clinically approved
nanomaterials could open up a new avenue for prevention of
infectious diseases.
Current antimicrobial approaches, including silver nano-
particles, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, and other chemical
biocides are incapable of degrading EPS and ineffective against
dental caries7,30. Fluoride, introduced over 60 years ago, as well as
more recent nanoapatites can reduce demineralization and pro-
mote remineralization but has limited antibiofilm effects30. We
have thus discovered a topical use for ferumoxytol that can be
repurposed to expand the few clinically available options for
caries-preventive therapy. Immediate clinical applications of
ferumoxytol-mediated catalysis could entail potentiating the
efficacy of existing peroxide-based modalities, including mou-
thrinses and toothpastes, which contain 1.5–10% H2O2. Fer-
umoxytol could be locally delivered using containers with
separate chambers that can keep the iron oxide nanoparticles and
H2O2 separated in storage, but allowing mixing at the time of
product delivery (rising or brushing). In terms of dosage, the
rodent caries model has contributed to the development of
clinically effective toothpastes and related caries-preventive pro-
ducts, including assessment of optimal fluoride concentration26.
Thus, the currently tested topical dosage may achieve therapeutic
effects clinically, although further optimization of ferumoxytol
and H2O2 concentrations may be required to develop a cost-
effective, safe and efficacious treatment.
Furthermore, the presence of commensal H2O2-producing
organisms may provide internal substrate for ferumoxytol. The
activation of locally produced H2O2 could modulate the compe-
tition between commensals and cariogenic pathogens to help
maintain a healthy microbiota14. Conversely, Candida albicans,
an opportunistic fungal pathogen, has been found to promote the
development of plaque-biofilms associated with early childhood
caries14. Our preliminary experiments show that such ‘ecological
modulation’ concept may be tenable whereby the presence of
Streptococcus gordonii (a commensal H2O2 producer) disrupted S.
mutans overgrowth in biofilms treated with ferumoxytol (Sup-
plementary Fig. 10), while also showing potential antifungal
activity (Supplementary Fig. 11, P < 0.05–0.001 by paired t test).
However, further enhancement in the catalytic performance
would be required to improve the overall efficacy to kill the

 cariogenic pathogens. This can be achieved by taking advantage
of the flexibility of iron oxide chemistry that allows the produc-
tion of different nanoparticle size and shapes as well as chemical
doping and surface modifications to enhance catalytic activity5.
Importantly, inclusion of fluoride may further enhance the car-
iostatic effects, which could lead to improved and more effective
formulations.
Finally, topical use of ferumoxytol may be particularly useful
for patients with severe childhood caries, who are often linked
with iron deficiency11–13. Recent reports from World Health
Organization and Global Burden of Disease Study have pointed
out that anemia caused by iron deficiency and dental caries
continue to be the two most prevalent childhood health dis-
abilities worldwide9,10. The possibility that major public health
problems could be alleviated by the inclusion of iron oxide
nanoparticle-based therapy is indeed attractive, which could lead
to a therapeutic platform tailored to these severely diseased
populations. Since ferumoxytol has been used off-label for

 treatment of pediatric patients18, future clinical studies to assess
whether repeated topical applications of ferumoxytol, in con-
junction with its systemic use, can help reduce iron deficiency and
prevent severe childhood caries are worthy of exploration.
Methods
Characterization of ferumoxytol iron oxide nanoparticles. Ferumoxytol iron
oxide nanoparticles were purchased from AMAG Pharmaceuticals (Waltham,
MA). TEM was done using a Tecnai F-20 and dynamic light scattering was con-
ducted with a Malvern Zetasizer Nanoseries (Nano ZS90) for hydrodynamic par-
ticle size determination. The thickness of carboxymethyl-dextran coating was
measured by ImageJ using TEM images with 2% uranyl acetate negative stain. The
peroxidase-like activity was tested via an established colorimetric assay using TMB
as substrate, which generates a blue color with specific absorption at 652 nm after
reacting with free-radicals catalyzed by ferumoxytol in the presence of H2O2 over
time at different pH values16. Briefly, the reaction mixture of 500 μl 0.1 M sodium
acetate (NaOAc) buffer (pH 4.5, pH 5.5, or pH 6.5) containing 20 μg ferumoxytol
nanoparticles, 0.1% H2O2 (w/w) and 100 μg of TMB was incubated at room
temperature and the colorimetric reaction assayed spectrophotometrically.
Michaelis–Menten reaction kinetic was carried out with 20 µg ferumoxytol in 1 ml
reaction buffer (0.1 M NaOAc, pH 4.5) in the presence of H2O2 at different con-
centrations, using 100 µg TMB as substrate. All the reactions were monitored in
timescan mode at 652 nm using a Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer.
Michaelis–Menten kinetic curve of ferumoxytol was acquired by plotting the
respective initial velocities against H2O2 concentrations. The Michaelis constant
(Km) were calculated via the Lineweaver–Burk plotting16. In a separate experiment,
the catalytic activity of ferumoxytol and the leached iron ions at acidic pH were
also tested. Ferumoxytol nanoparticles (500 μg) in 0.1 M NaOAc (pH 4.5) were
incubated for 0, 5, 30, 60, and 120 min. After the incubation time, the free iron ions
and nanoparticles were separated using ultrafiltration tubes (10 kDa, MWCO), and
the iron amounts from nanoparticles and supernatant were determined by ICP-
OES. The nanoparticles (resuspended in 0.1 M NaOAc buffer, pH 4.5) or super-
natant were incubated with 0.5% H2O2 and 100 μg TMB, and the colorimetric
reaction was also assessed as described above.
Bacterial killing and EPS degradation by ferumoxytol activated H2O2. Time-
lapse high-resolution confocal fluorescence imaging was performed to assess the
dynamics of bacterial killing and glucan structure breakdown. Streptococcus mutans
UA159 (ATCC 700610), a virulent cariogenic pathogen and well-characterized
biofilm-forming strain, was grown in ultra-filtered (10-kDa cutoff; Millipore)
tryptone-yeast extract (UFTYE) broth at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to mid-exponential
phase. Ferumoxytol was added to actively growing S. mutans (108 CFU ml−1) at a
concentration of 1 mg ml−1 in the presence of 1% H2O2 at pH 4.5 or pH 6.5. SYTO
60 (652/678 nm; Molecular Probes) and propidium iodide (PI, 535/617 nm;
Molecular Probes) were used for labelling live and dead cells. In addition, we
conjugated ferumoxytol with Alexa Fluor 488 (490/525 nm; Molecular Probes) to
visualize nanoparticle binding and localization on the cell surface. Confocal images
were acquired in the same field of view at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min using Zeiss LSM
800 upright single photon laser scanning microscope with a 40× (numerical
aperture = 1.2) water immersion objective. Images were analyzed by ImageJ. For
EPS degradation, insoluble glucans were produced by purified S. mutans-derived
exoenzyme glucosyltransferase B (GtfB) immobilized on poly-L-lysine coated
MatTek dish, and labelled with 1 μM Alexa Fluor 647-dextran conjugate (647/
668 nm; Molecular Probes) as described previously31. The preformed fluorescently
labelled glucans were then incubated with ferumoxytol (1 mg ml−1) and 1% H2O2
(in 0.1 M NaOAc buffer at pH 4.5 or 6.5), and time-lapsed confocal imaging was
performed as described above using a 20× (numerical aperture = 1.0) water
immersion objective. To further examine the glucan degradation process, we also
employed computational analysis (Amira and ImageJ) that generates structural
scaffold based on geometrical and topological properties of the EPS, including
length and width31.
In vitro biofilm model on sHA. Biofilms were formed on sHA discs (surface
area = 2.7 ± 0.2 cm2) vertically suspended in 24-well plates using a custom-made
wire disc holder, mimicking the smooth surfaces of the pellicle-coated tooth19 (also
see Supplementary Fig. 4a). Each sHA disc was inoculated with ~2 × 105 CFU of S.
mutans per ml in UFTYE containing 1% (w/v) sucrose at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The
culture medium was changed twice daily (at 19 and 29 h) until the end of the
experimental period (43 h). The biofilms were collected and analyzed for fer-
umoxytol binding and catalytic activity as well as bioactivity as described below.
Ferumoxytol binding and catalytic activity within biofilm. Quantitative assess-
ment of ferumoxytol binding into biofilm was performed with ICP-OES. Biofilms
were exposed to 2.8 ml of ferumoxytol (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 Fe mg ml−1) in 0.1 M
NaOAc (pH 4.5) topically for 10 min at specific time-points as described in Sup-
plementary Fig. 4a. The treated biofilms were dip-washed three times in 0.89%
NaCl to remove excess and unbound agents, and then transferred to fresh culture
medium. At the end of the experimental period (43 h), the biofilms were removed
and homogenized by sonication (water bath sonication followed by probe soni-
cation at an output of 7 W for 30 s; Branson Sonifier 150, Branson Ultrasonics) as
detailed elsewhere19. The homogenized suspension was centrifuged and the biofilm
pellet was washed twice with water to remove unbound material. The pellet was
then dissolved in 250 μl aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 = 3:1) at 60 °C overnight1,32. The
next day, 4.75 ml of MilliQ water was added and the sample was analyzed by ICP-
OES (Spectro Genesis ICP) for iron content. In a separate experiment, the catalytic
activity of ferumoxytol bound within intact biofilms was also assessed. Briefly,
ferumoxytol or vehicle-control (buffer) treated biofilms (at 43 h) were dip-washed
with 0.1 M NaOAc buffer (pH 4.5) three times and transferred to the reaction
buffer 0.1 M NaOAc (pH 4.5) containing TMB and H2O2. After 30 min, the bio-
films were removed and the colorimetric reaction was assessed as described above.
Intact biofilms were also examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM,
Quanta 600 FEG, FEI) and iron analyzed via EDS with corresponding elemental
mapping on the same SEM.
We also visualized the spatial distribution of ferumoxytol, bacterial cells and the
EPS-matrix using a TEM protocol optimized for high-resolution imaging of oral
biofilm ultrastructure22. Briefly, ferumoxytol or vehicle treated biofilms
(Supplementary Fig. 4a) were washed with 0.89% NaCl to remove unbound
materials and treated with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.89% NaCl for 2 h. Then, the
biofilms were washed in 0.89% NaCl and treated with 0.05 M sodium periodate in
0.12 M NaCl for 6 h at 4 °C in the dark. The biofilms were then washed with 0.89%
NaCl and reacted with 0.1 M DL-methionine in 0.12 M NaCl at room temperature
overnight. The next day, the biofilms were incubated with 1% OsO4 for 90 min and
dehydrated in a graded series of ethylene glycol/1,2-pentanediol: once 75% and
90% 1,2-pentanediol, twice 100% 1,2-pentanediol. Finally, the biofilms were treated
in premixed 1:1 Epon/1,2-pentanediol for 90 min, and twice for 2 h in 100% Epon
with slight agitation. The samples were then transferred to flat, polystyrene wells
covered with fresh 100% Epon, and polymerized at 60 °C for 3 days. The hardened,
embedded biofilms were then sectioned into ultra-thin sections (~70 nm) using a
DiATOME diamond knife. Grids were poststained with 1% uranyl acetate and
SATO lead staining solution. Images were taken by JEOL 1010 TEM fitted with a
Hamamatsu digital camera and AMT advantage image capture software.
Biofilm treatment and quantitative analysis. The biofilms were topically treated
twice daily by placing them in 2.8 ml of ferumoxytol (1 mg ml−1) in 0.1 M NaOAc
(pH 4.5) or vehicle-control (buffer only) for 10 min as described in Supplementary
Fig. 4a. At the end of the experimental period (43 h), the ferumoxytol and vehicle
treated biofilms were placed in 2.8 ml of 1% H2O2 or buffer for 5 min. After H2O2
exposure, the biofilms were removed and homogenized by sonication as described
above; the sonication procedure provides optimum dispersal and maximum
recoverable counts in our biofilm model without killing bacterial cells19. The
homogenized suspension was subjected to microbiological and biochemical
methods19,27. The total number of viable cells in each of the treated biofilms was
determined by colony forming units (CFU), while insoluble extracellular poly-
saccharides was extracted and quantified using colorimetric assays19,27.
Human derived ex vivo biofilm model on natural teeth. To further assess the
antibiofilm efficacy of ferumoxytol-mediated H2O2 catalysis, we examined whether
daily topical treatments can disrupt cariogenic biofilm development and prevent
enamel surface damage using an ex vivo biofilm model. Plaque-biofilm samples
were collected from children (age between 36 and 72 months) diagnosed with
severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) as defined by the 2014 Conference Manual of
the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Ethical approval of the study and
the written consent/permission forms were obtained from Institutional Review
Board (IRB) at University of Pennsylvania (IRB 824243) prior to the study com-
mencement. For each child, written permission form was reviewed and signed by
their legal guardians. Pooled plaque samples were collected from the available
smooth tooth surfaces using a sterilized periodontal scaler and transferred into 1 ml
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a sterilized Eppendorf tube. After collection, the
plaque samples were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory, and then
gently vortexed and sonicated (three 10-s pulses with 30-s intervals at 7 W) to
disperse the aggregates before inoculation33. Different pooled samples were
checked for S. mutans, which is frequently found in high numbers in cariogenic
plaque-biofilm associated with S-ECC34, and total cultivable bacteria to ensure
similar S. mutans proportion for the inoculum (Supplementary Fig. 12). The
human-derived ex vivo biofilms were formed on sterilized human enamel blocks (4
mm × 4 mm) mounted vertically in 24-well plates using a custom-made wire holder
(Fig. 5a). Each enamel block was inoculated with homogenized pooled plaque in
UFTYE containing 1% sucrose at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 115 h (5 days) as described
previously19. To mimic topical treatment regimen, the enamel blocks and biofilms
were topically treated twice-daily by placing them in 2.8 ml of ferumoxytol (1 mg
ml−1) in 0.1 M NaOAc (pH 4.5) for 10 min immediately followed by 1% H2O2
exposure for 5 min. After each treatment, the biofilms were dip-washed with 0.89%
NaCl and transferred to fresh culture medium. Biofilm were removed at 115 h for
three-dimensional (3D) structural analysis and the enamel blocks were collected for
surface analysis via surface topography, roughness measurement and transversal
microradiography35.

 Analysis of ex vivo derived biofilm. The biofilms formed on enamel blocks were
gently washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS, pH
7.4) at 4 °C for 4 h. After fixation, the biofilms were washed twice with PBS, then
transferred into 50% ethanol (in PBS, pH 7.4) and stored at −20 °C. The biofilm
3D architecture was analyzed via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as
detailed previously35–37. FISH oligonucleotide probes used in this study were:
EUB338, 5′-GCTGCTCCCGTAGGATG-3′ with Cy3 for all bacteria; Smu587, 5′-
ACTCCAGACTTTCCTGAC-3′ with Alexa Fluor 488 for S. mutans. The sample in
the hybridization buffer (30% formamide, 0.9 M NaCl, 0.01% sodium-dodecyl
sulphate (SDS), 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) with the probes was incubated at 46 °C
for 2 h. After incubation, the hybridized cells were washed with washing buffer (0.2
M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS), and further
incubated at 46 °C for 10 min35–37. The EPS were labeled with 1 μM Alexa Fluor
647-dextran conjugate (647/668 nm; Molecular Probes)19. The 3D biofilm archi-
tecture was acquired using Zeiss LSM 800 with a 20× (numerical aperture =1.0)
water immersion objective. The biofilms were sequentially scanned using diode
lasers (488, 561, and 640 nm), and the fluorescence emitted was collected with
GaAsP or multialkali PMT detector (475–525 nm for Alexa Fluor 488, 540–580 nm
for Cy3, and 645–680 nm for Alexa Fluor 647-dextran conjugates, respectively.
Amira 5.4.1 software (Visage Imaging) was used to create 3D renderings to
visualize the architecture of the biofilms.
Enamel surface analyses. The surface topography and roughness of the tooth
enamel surface (after biofilm removal) were analyzed by a nondestructive confocal
contrasting method using Zeiss LSM 800 with a C Epiplan-Apochromat 50×
(numerical aperture = 0.95) nonimmersion objective. The images were processed
using ConfoMap (Zeiss) to create 3D topography rendering and measure the
surfaces properties in 3D. After surface analyses, enamel blocks were mounted on
plastic rods and sectioned with a hard tissue microtome (Silverstone-Taylor Hard
Tissue Microtome, Series 1000 Deluxe) for transversal microradiography. One 100-
μm section was obtained from the center of each specimen, mounted on X-ray
sensitive plates (Microchrome Technology) and subjected to X-ray, along with an
aluminum step wedge. Microradiographic images were analyzed with Inspektor
TMR 2000 software (ver. 1.25) with sound enamel defined at 87% mineral volume
to obtain mean lesion depth (µm)35.
In vivo rodent model of severe childhood caries. The therapeutic efficacy of
ferumoxytol-mediated H2O2 catalysis were assessed on a well-established rodent
caries model as detailed elsewhere26,27. Briefly, 15 days-old female Sprague–Dawley
rat pups were purchased with their dams from Harlan Laboratories (Madison).
Upon arrival, animals were screened for S. mutans and were determined not to be
infected with the pathogen by plating oral swabs on mitis salivarius agar plus
bacitracin. The animals were then infected by mouth with actively growing
(midlogarithmic) culture of S. mutans UA159, and their infections were confirmed
at 21 days via oral swabbing. To simulate clinical situation, we developed a com-
bination therapy consisting of 1 min topical treatment of ferumoxytol at 1 mg ml−1
(or buffer) immediately followed by 1% H2O2 (or buffer) exposure. All the pups
(equal numbers) were randomly placed into treatment groups, and their teeth were
treated topically twice daily using a custom-made applicator (Fig. 6a)27. The
treatment groups were: (1) control (0.1 M NaOAc buffer, pH 4.5), (2) ferumoxytol
alone (1 mg ml−1), (3) 1% H2O2 only, and (4) ferumoxytol/H2O2. The treatments
were blinded by placing the test agents in color-coded vials. Each group was
provided the National Institutes of Health cariogenic diet 2000 and 5% sucrose
water ad libitum. The experiment proceeded for 3 weeks (21 days). All animals
were weighed weekly, and their physical appearances were noted daily. At the end
of the experimental period, the animals were sacrificed, and the jaws were surgically
removed and aseptically dissected, followed by sonication to recover total oral
microbiota38. All jaws were defleshed and the teeth were prepared for caries scoring
according to Larson’s modification of Keyes’ system26,27. Determination of caries
score of the jaws was performed by a calibrated examiner who was blind for the
study by using codified samples. Furthermore, both gingival and palatal tissues
were collected and processed for H&E staining for histopathological analysis by an
oral pathologist at Penn Oral Pathology. This study was reviewed and approved by
the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC #805529).
16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Dispersed oral microbiota samples were
eluted in PBS with cell lysis buffer from a DNeasy kit (Qiagen) as described by the
manufacturer. After a 60 s vortex, DNA present in the buffer was isolated with the
DNeasy PowerSoil HTP kit and quantitated with a spectrophotometer (Tecan).
The 27F/338R primer with Golay-barcode in the reverse primer was used to
amplify the V1–V2 region of 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA; IDT). Four replicate
PCR reactions were performed for each sample using Q5 Hot Start High Fidelity
DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs). Each PCR reaction contained: 4.3 µl
microbial DNA-free water, 5 µl 5× buffer, 0.5 µl dNTPs (10 mM), 0.17 µl Q5 Hot
Start Polymerase, 6.25 µl each primer (2 µM), and 2.5 µl DNA. PCR reactions
without template or with synthetic DNAs were performed as negative and positive
controls, respectively. PCR amplification was done on a Mastercycler Nexus Gra-
dient (Eppendorf) using the following conditions: DNA denaturation at 98 °C for
1 min, then 20 cycles of denaturation 98 °C for 10 s, annealing 56 °C for 20 s and
extension 72 °C for 20 s, last extension at 72 °C for 8 min. PCR replicates were
pooled and then purified using a 1:1 ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP beads
(Beckman Coulter), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The final library was
prepared by pooling 10 µg of amplified DNA per sample. Those that did not reach
at the DNA concentration threshold (e.g., negative control samples) were incor-
porated to the final pool by adding 12 µl. The library was sequenced to obtain 2 ×
250 bp paired-end reads using the MiSeq Illumina39. Sequence data was analyzed
with the QIIME pipeline (ver. 1.9.1)40. The forward and reverse reads were joined
with no mismatches permitted. Read quality lower than Q29 or more than 3
consecutive low-quality base calls were discarded. Sequences were clustered into
operational taxonomic units (OTU) at a 97% similarity threshold using the
UCLUST method41. Taxonomic assignments were obtained based on GreenGenes
16S rRNA gene database42. To test the differences between communities, library
vegan, and Unifrac distances were used43,44. Diversity, richness, and bacterial taxon
abundances were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. PCoA was per-
formed using library APE for R programming language45.
Statistical analysis. All the results are presented as means ± s.d. Data were ana-
lyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey HSD
test for multiple comparison. A pairwise comparison was conducted using Stu-
dent’s t test. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant
when P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
18.0 software.
Ethics statement. The animal experiment was conducted in strict accordance with
the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act of the United States, under the protocol
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Pennsylvania (IACUC#805529). The plaque-biofilm samples collec-
tion from ECC children were approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) at
University of Pennsylvania (IRB 824243) and were used only for the sole purpose
of biofilm formation on enamel surfaces. The written permission form for each
child was reviewed and signed by their legal guardians. The whole saliva is a
convenient sample (with no identifiers) collected for the sole purpose of coating the
hydroxyapatite discs for the in vitro biofilm studies. All adult subjects provided
written informed consent (no children participated in the saliva collection) under
the protocol reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania Research
Subject committee (IRB#818549).
Data availability. The 16S rRNA gene sequences are available in the NCBI
sequence read archive under accession code SRP136459. All the other data that
support the findings of this study are available within the paper and its Supple-
mentary Information Files.
