Key Points
• PF-06747143, a novel
CXCR4 antagonist
IgG1 Ab, mobilizes ma-
lignant cells from the
BM and induces their
death via Fc-effector
function.
• PF-06747143 reduces
tumor burden in NHL,
AML, and MM models,
both as a monotherapy
or in combination with
standard-of-care
agents.
The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis in
multiple malignancies. Upon engagement by its ligand, CXCL12, CXCR4 triggers intracellular
signaling pathways that control trafficking of cells to tissues where the ligand is expressed,
such as the bone marrow (BM). In hematologic cancers, CXCR4-driven homing of malignant
cells to the BM protective niche is a key mechanism driving disease and therapy resistance.
We developed a humanized CXCR4 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody (Ab), PF-06747143,
which binds to CXCR4 and inhibits CXCL12-mediated signaling pathways, as well as cell
migration. In in vivo preclinical studies, PF-06747143 monotherapy rapidly and transiently
mobilized cells from the BM into the peripheral blood. In addition, PF-06747143 effectively
induced tumor cell death via its Fc constant region–mediated effector function. This Fc-
mediated cell killing mechanism not only enhanced antitumor efficacy, but also played a
role in reducing the duration of cell mobilization, when compared with an IgG4 version of
the Ab, which does not have Fc-effector function. PF-06747143 treatment showed strong
antitumor effect in multiple hematologic tumor models including non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and multiple myeloma (MM). Importantly, PF-
06747143 synergized with standard-of-care agents in a chemoresistant AML patient-derived
xenograft model and in an MM model. These findings suggest that PF-06747143 is a potential
best-in-class anti-CXCR4 antagonist for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, including
in the resistant setting. PF-06747143 is currently in phase 1 clinical trial evaluation
(registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02954653).
Introduction
The 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4, also known as CD184, is normally
expressed in various tissues and predominantly in hematopoietic cells.1,2 Moreover, CXCR4 is overexpressed
in .75% of cancers, including hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, and its expression correlates with
poor prognosis.3-7 The chemokine CXCL12, also known as SDF-1, is the only CXCR4 ligand identified to
date. It is highly expressed by mesenchymal stromal cells in the liver, lungs, bone marrow (BM), and lymphatic
tissues.8 CXCR4 and CXCL12 have strong chemotactic activity and play a critical role in the cross talk
between cancer cells and the local tumor microenvironment.9 Upon ligand binding, CXCR4 triggers signaling
pathways that promote malignant cell survival, migration, and invasiveness.10,11 Furthermore, chemotherapy

 treatment upregulates expression of CXCL12 in BM cells and the
receptor in tumor cells.12,13 The collective evidence suggests that the
CXCR4 signaling axis protects malignant cells from spontaneous and
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the BM niche,14-16 promoting resis-
tance and minimal residual disease in hematologic malignancies.17-19
The CXCL12-CXCR4 interaction is crucial for attracting tumor cells
to the BM. Thus, disruption of the pathway using CXCR4 antagonists
as a way to mobilize tumor cells from the protective BM, and to
sensitize them to chemotherapy, has been proposed as an attractive
therapeutic approach in hematologic malignancies.13,20-23 In that
regard, several CXCR4 antagonists are currently undergoing clinical
evaluation. It is important to note that the ability of anti-CXCR4 agents
to simply mobilize cells appears to be insufficient to drive antitumor
activity. For instance, the CXCR4 peptide antagonists LY251092424
and BKT140/BL8040/TN1400325 induce cell mobilization as mono-
therapies but failed to reduce tumor burden in clinical trials.25,26
Interestingly, the CXCR4 partial agonist small molecule AMD3100
(Plerixafor; Mozobil), which induces mobilization of leukemic blasts
from the BM, is undergoing clinical evaluation in hematologic malig-
nancies in combination with chemotherapy, as a means to eliminate
the mobilized cancer cells.18,19,23
In addition to small molecules and peptides, a humanized immunoglob-
ulin G4 (IgG4) antibody (Ab) targeting CXCR4, ulocuplumab, has been
evaluated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, and multiple myeloma (MM) phase 1 clinical trials.20,27-29
Therapeutic Ab’s may induce target cell killing via immune-mediated
effector functions (Fc-effector function), such as Ab-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxic-
ity (CDC).30 Human Ab subclasses effector function is dictated by
their differential binding to Fc receptors in immune effector cells.
Human IgG1 and IgG3 Ab’s mediate potent Fc-effector function,
whereas human IgG2 and IgG4 Ab’s display little or no Fc-effector
function.30 In line with this, ulocuplumab, an IgG4 Ab, was recently
reported to have no Fc-effector tumor cell–killing activity.31 In the clinic,
this Ab causes cell mobilization, as do other CXCR4 antagonists;
however, because of its longer half-life (3 days in humans) and lack of
Fc-effector function, the mobilized cells survive and stay in the
peripheral blood (PB) for several days, resulting in at least 1 incidence
of hyperleukocytosis.28,29 Extensive leukocyte mobilization presents a
safety risk associated with respiratory and neurological distress.32
All therapeutic CXCR4 antagonists currently in the clinic have been
shown to mobilize cancer cells from the BM niche, facilitating their
elimination by chemotherapy and other anticancer drugs. Therefore,
we hypothesized that by developing a CXCR4 Ab capable of both
mobilizing and rapidly killing CXCR4-expressing cancer cells through
Fc-effector function, it would be possible to enhance antitumor
activity and mitigate the safety risk associated with prolonged cell
mobilization, previously observed with other anti-CXCR4 agents in the
clinic. Here we describe the generation of a novel humanized IgG1
CXCR4 antagonist Ab, PF-06747143, that displays those properties.
PF-06747143 potently inhibited hematologic tumor growth as a
monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care (SOC) agents
in various preclinical models, including chemotherapy-resistant ones.
Studies comparing PF-06747143 with the IgG4 version of the Ab
showed that the Fc-effector function activity contributed to improved
efficacy and prevented prolonged cell mobilization. Based on its
unique mechanisms of action, PF-06747143 has broad therapeutic
potential in hematologic malignancies.
Methods
Functional assays
The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assay was performed
using CHO-K1 cells expressing human CXCR4 (hCXCR4; Discov-
eRx) (3 3 105 per well) in triplicates. The cAMP Hunter eXpress
GPCR assay kit (DiscoveRx) was used to perform the assay,
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Tumor cell migration assays
were performed plating 0.5 3 106 cells per well (in quadruplicates) in
the top chamber of transwell plates (Corning), in serum free RPMI
1640. CXCL12 (100 ng/mL) was added to the bottom wells. After 24
hours, tumor cells in the bottom well were measured using CellTiter-
Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The percent of
migration inhibition was calculated relative to control (IgG1 Ab)–
treated cells, using the following formula: % migration inhibition 5

ADCC activity was determined using the NK-92 FcgRIIIA 158V
(NK92 158V) cell line (Conkwest) as effector cells. Ab’s were
incubated for 4 hours, with tumor cells and effector cells, NK-92

cytotoxicity assay (Lonza) was used to detect cell lysis. CDC activity
was determined using 10 000 Daudi cells per well in duplicates,
incubated with 5 mg/mL (33 nM) of Ab’s, in the presence of 2.5%
human donor complement (Sigma), for 4 hours. Cytotoxicity was
measured using CytoTox 96 nonradioactive kit (Promega).
In vivo efficacy studies
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subcutaneous xenograft model was gen-
erated by subcutaneous implantation of 5 3 106 Ramos tumor cells on
the right hind limb of SCID beige female mice (Charles River). Tumors
were measured by caliper, and volumes were calculated by (length 3
width2)/2. MM and AML disseminated xenograft tumor models employed
tumor cells stably transduced with the luciferase gene. Cells were
implanted IV in the tail vein of NSG female mice (Jackson Laboratory).
Tumor burden was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (IVIS 200).
According to the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee protocol,
mice were euthanized once hind leg paralysis was observed (survival end

 Nonhuman primate (NHP) cell mobilization
Cynomolgus monkeys were administered with Ab’s or vehicle by
IV bolus injection. A control group of animals received vehicle
(phosphate-buffered saline). Blood samples were collected in K2
EDTA for hematology analysis, and mean absolute white blood cell
(WBC) numbers were determined using an Advia 2120 (Siemens)
hematology analyzer.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc.).
Two-group comparisons were analyzed with a 2-tailed Student t
test, and a greater number of groups were analyzed using 1-way
analysis of variance with Tukey multiple comparison test. A P value
,.05 was considered significant. Survival analyzes were performed
using Kaplan-Meier followed by a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. All
mouse and NHP studies were conducted under a Pfizer Institutional
Animal Use and Care Committee approved protocol.
Results
PF-06747143 binds CXCR4 with high selectivity
and affinity
Binding specificity of PF-06747143 to hCXCR4 was assessed by flow
cytometry. PF-06747143 bound specifically to CHO cells expressing
hCXCR4 (CHO-hCXCR4), whereas no binding was observed to cells
transfected with empty vector (CHO-parental) (supplemental Figure 1).
Consistent with these findings, PF-06747143 bound to the hCXCR4-
positive hematologic malignant cells Ramos (99%), OPM-2 (71%),
and MV4-11 (80%), but not to hCXCR4-negative TF-1 cells33 (3%)
(supplemental Figure 2; supplemental Table 2).
PF-06747143 binding to hCXCR4 and cynomolgus monkey
CXCR4 was evaluated in CXCR4-expressing human Raji and
HSC-F (transformed cynomolgus monkey fetal splenocytes) cells
by flow cytometry. The 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) for
hCXCR4 and cynomolgus monkey CXCR4 were 3.05 and 2.59 nM,
respectively, indicating similar binding affinities to CXCR4 protein of
both species (supplemental Figure 3).
PF-06747143 inhibits CXCL12-induced signaling
pathways and cell migration
We next analyzed how PF-06747143 affects CXCR4-driven cellular
functions. CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 inhibits adenyl cyclase and
intracellular cAMP levels. Consistent with CXCR4 antagonism, PF-
06747143 dose-dependently induced cAMP in the presence of
CXCL12 (EC50 of 7.75 nM) (Figure 1A). Furthermore, in accordance
with the important role CXCR4 and its ligand, CXCL12, play in
migration of tumor cells, PF-06747143 inhibited CXCL12-induced
migration of Ramos cells, with an 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)
of 0.24 nM (Figure 1B). Potent migration inhibition by PF-06747143
was also observed in other cell lines such as AML MV4-11 (supplemental
Figure 4). Taken together, these results show that PF-06747143
functionally antagonizes ligand-induced activity of CXCR4.
PF-06747143 induces cell death through its
Fc-effector function (ADCC and CDC)
To evaluate the role of Fc-effector functions in ADCC and CDC
assays, the variable domains of PF-06747143 parental Ab, m15,
were cloned into human IgG1 (m15-IgG1) and human IgG4 (m15-
IgG4) Ab backbones. Rituximab, a component of the SOC treatment
regimen for NHL, was used as positive control because its clinical
activity depends on both ADCC and CDC.34 In the ADCC assay
in the Ramos NHL cell line, in the presence of NK92 158V ef-
fector cells, m15-IgG1 showed strong cytotoxicity, with an IC50 of
124 pM, when compared with no significant activity with m15-IgG4
(Figure 2A). This is in agreement with the expected diminished ADCC
activity of the IgG4 Ab. In addition, PF-06747143 exerted similar
cytotoxicity as m15-IgG1 with an IC50 of 115 pM (Figure 2A),
confirming that the parent Ab and its humanized derivative have
similar ADCC properties. Moreover, both CXCR4 IgG1 Ab’s showed
similar ADCC activity to the CD20 Ab rituximab. ADCC-induced cell
death was also observed in MV4-11 (AML) and OPM-2 (MM) cell
lines treated with PF-06747143 (Figure 2B).
The CDC activity of m15-IgG1 and m15-IgG4 was assessed in
NHL cells, in the presence of human donor complement. m15-IgG1
induced complement-dependent cell lysis (32%), similar to the
positive control rituximab (25%), whereas m15-IgG4 had no activity
(Figure 2C), consistent with the hypothesis that the human IgG1 Ab
has more potent effector function than the human IgG4 Ab. When
CDC activities of m15-IgG1, PF-06747143, and rituximab were
compared, all 3 Ab’s triggered similar levels of complement fixation-
driven cell lysis (Figure 2D).
PF-06747143 induces dose-dependent tumor growth
inhibition (TGI) in an NHL xenograft model
We next assessed the in vivo efficacy of PF-06747143 in the
subcutaneous NHL Ramos xenograft model, which expresses
CXCR4 (99% positive) (supplemental Figure 2; supplemental
Table 2). Both PF-06747143 and its parental IgG1 Ab, m15-IgG1,
were equally effective at inhibiting tumor growth, compared with
IgG1 control Ab (P , .0001) (Figure 3A). The number of animals
exhibiting tumor regressions was similar in both parental m15-IgG1
Ab–treated and PF-06747143 Ab–treated groups, with 80%
and 70% of animals showing tumor volumes below their initial
sizes at the end of the study, respectively. The in vivo exposures of
Figure 4. PF-06747143 greatly reduces BM tumor burden as a monotherapy and in combination with SOCs in a disseminated MM model. OPM-2-Luc MM cells were

 PF-06747143 and m15-IgG1 were similar, with mean serum
concentrations of 400 nM and 424 nM 1 week after the first dose,
respectively. These results indicate that the parental m15-IgG1 Ab
and PF-06747143 Ab have comparable exposure and antitumor
activity in vivo.
PF-06747143 dose-dependent response was demonstrated in the
Ramos subcutaneous model, with similar TGI relative to initial tumor
volume observed at the highest doses, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg
(Figure 3B). These effects were sustained until the end of the study
(day 38), even after Ab treatment was suspended (day 21).
Fc-effector function plays a role in TGI
To evaluate the role of the Ab effector function in TGI, m15-IgG1 and
m15-IgG4 Ab’s were compared in the Ramos subcutaneous model,
at 1 and 10 mg/kg. The antitumor activity of m15-IgG1 was greater
than that of m15-IgG4 at each of the doses tested (Figure 3C). m15-
IgG1 at 10 mg/kg exhibited significantly greater TGI than m15-IgG4
Ab at the same dose (P 5 .014), with complete tumor regressions in
50% of m15-IgG1-treated (10 mg/kg) animals, compared with partial
TGI responses observed in the m15-IgG4 group at the same dose.
Moreover, TGI achieved by m15-IgG1 at 1 mg/kg was comparable to
the TGI seen with m15-IgG4 at a 10-fold higher dose (10 mg/kg)
(P 5 .63). The mean serum concentration of m15-IgG1 and m15-IgG4
were comparable for both doses, suggesting both Ab isoforms have
similar exposure in vivo (Figure 3D).
Treatment-induced cell death was assessed by characterizing
caspase-3 activation in tumors collected from Ramos xenograft
mice treated with a single dose of m15-IgG1 or m15-IgG4 at 10
mg/kg. Cleaved caspase-3 was observed as early as 48 hours
postdose in m15-IgG1–treated animals and increased over time
(72 hours), whereas minimal caspase-3 activation was detected in
tumors of animals treated with the m15-IgG4 Ab at similar time
points (Figure 3E). Taken together, these results suggest that Fc-
effector function is an important factor driving in vivo efficacy,
contributing to the superior antitumor effect of m15-IgG1 relative to
that of m15-IgG4 Ab.
PF-06747143 inhibits tumor growth, increases
survival, and synergizes with bortezomib in a
disseminated MM model
In hematologic diseases, malignant cells proliferate in protective
niches such as the BM. To determine if PF-06747143 is effective in
eliminating cells from the BM environment, a disseminated MM
model, in which the OPM2-Luc tumor cells are implanted IV and
migrated spontaneously to the BM, was used (Figure 4A). The
activity of PF-06747143 was compared with that of melphalan,
a component of the SOC regimen for MM treatment.35 PF-
06747143 significantly inhibited BM tumor growth compared with
the IgG1 control Ab and melphalan on day 30 (P , .0001)
(Figure 4B-C). Importantly, the strong antitumor response trans-
lated into a significant survival benefit. The human IgG1 control Ab
and melphalan-treated animals showed median survival of 33.5 and
36 days, respectively, whereas the PF-06747143–treated group
showed no deaths by the end of the study (day 50) (P , .0001)
(Figure 4D).
Given the robust single-agent activity of PF-06747143 in the OPM-
2 model at the 10 mg/kg dose, we next evaluated efficacy of
PF-06747143 at a lower dose (1 mg/kg), both as a monotherapy
or in combination with bortezomib (Velcade), a therapeutic agent
approved for the treatment of MM36 (Figure 4E). Tumor burden
(Figure 4F-G) in the combination group was significantly reduced
compared with either agent alone. This translated into a survival
benefit in the combination arm, with no deaths observed (P , .0003)
at the end of the study (day 51) (Figure 4H). The IgG1 control median
survival was 34 days, and single-agent treatments with PF-06747143
or bortezomib showed median survivals of 47 and 44 days,
respectively. Taken together, these results show that PF-06747143
reduces BM tumor burden, improves survival as a monotherapy, and
has potent synergistic activity with bortezomib in a disseminated
MM model.
Efficacy of PF-06747143 in an AML disseminated
tumor model
Next, PF-06747143 activity was investigated in a staged, dissemi-
nated AML model, using MV4-11 cells. The activity of PF-06747143
at 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg was compared with that of daunorubicin,
a chemotherapeutic used for the treatment of AML patients,37 and
crenolanib, a FLT-3 inhibitor currently in phase 2 clinical trials in
AML38 (Figure 5A). Bioluminescence imaging showed that
PF-06747143 treatment decreased tumor burden in a dose-
dependent manner, compared with human IgG1 control Ab (P , .05)
(Figure 5B-C). Daunorubicin was efficacious at reducing tumor
burden, with similar activity to PF-06747143 at 10 mg/kg.
To evaluate the effect of PF-06747143 in BM and PB tumor burden,
the percentage of human CD45 (hCD451) and human CD33
(hCD331) positive cells was determined (Figure 5D). Treatment with
PF-06747143, daunorubicin, and crenolanib resulted in a significant
reduction in the number of tumor cells in both PB and BM, compared
with human IgG1 control Ab (P , .05). PF-06747143 induced dose-
dependent reduction in the number of human AML cells (hCD451
and hCD331) in both PB and BM. Importantly, the reduction in the
number of human AML cells in the BM with PF-06746143 treatment
at 10 mg/kg (95.9%) was similar to that achieved by the AML ther-
apeutic agents daunorubicin (84.5%) and crenolanib (80.5%).
A PF-06747143 dose-dependent increase in survival was observed
(Figure 5E). PF-06747143 at 10 mg/kg resulted in a median survival of
63 days, and animals treated with PF-06747143 at 1 mg/kg showed
median survival of 47 days. PF-06747143 at 0.1 mg/kg and the
IgG1 control Ab–treated groups showed similar median survival of
36 and 41 days, respectively. The increase in survival observed for
PF-06747143 at 10 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg was statistically significant
(P , .05) when compared with the IgG1 control Ab group. Taken
together these results demonstrate that treatment with PF-06747143
as a monotherapy translates into dose-dependent BM tumor burden
reduction and significant survival benefit in a disseminated AML model.
PF-06747143 has a strong combinatorial effect with
daunorubicin and cytarabine (Ara-C) in a
chemotherapy-resistant AML PDX model
To investigate the activity of PF-06747143 in an AML chemo-
resistant model, in combination with the AML SOC agents
daunorubicin and Ara-C, we used the disseminated PDX model
(BM012407L). This model was derived from an AML patient who
developed resistance to induction chemotherapy, consisting of
daunorubicin and Ara-C, the main components of AML SOC
treatment. Animals were treated according to the dosing scheme in

 Figure 6A. Of note, CXCR4 expression in this PDX model is lower
than in the xenograft cell line models. Only 36% of the BM cells are
positive for CXCR4, as indicated by the percentage of CXCR41
AML (CD451CD331) cells observed in the IgG1 control Ab group
(Figure 6B). Treatment with PF-06747143 as a monotherapy
significantly decreased the total number of CXCR41 AML cells
(CXCR41CD451CD331) in the BM to 2.9%, compared with IgG1

 with Ara-C reduced the BM CXCR41CD451CD331 AML cells to
9.3%. Importantly, a strong combinatorial effect was observed with
the triple combination of PF-06747143 added to the SOC agents,
daunorubicin and Ara-C, resulting in minimal levels of CXCR41
CD451CD331cells in the BM (group average 0.04%) (Figure 6B),
with 2 out of 5 animals exhibiting undetectable malignant cells in the
BM or no minimal residual disease.
When the BM results were analyzed based on the number of AML
cells (CD451CD331), irrespective of CXCR4 expression (Figure 6C),
we observed that treatment with the SOC agents daunorubicin and
Ara-C resulted in partial response, with 27% of malignant AML cells
remaining in the BM (Figure 6C) (P , .05). This is in line with the
chemoresistant nature of this PDX model. Treatment with PF-06747143
as a monotherapy was not very effective, with a group average of 80%
CD451CD331 AML cells remaining in the BM. This is expected based
on the fact that ;65% of BM AML cells do not express CXCR4 in this
PDX model. Importantly, the number of BM CD451CD331 AML cells
was significantly reduced by the combination of PF-06747143 with the
2 AML SOC agents, with 0.3% residual AML cells in the BM
(Figure 6C) of animals in this combination group.
Overall, the levels of CD451CD331 AML cells were lower in PB than
in the BM, with similar trends to inhibition with PF-06747143 and
SOC alone and synergistic effect with the triple combination
(Figure 6C). Higher sensitivity to treatment is expected for malignant
cells circulating in PB because they are not protected by the growth
factors and chemokines present in the BM. Taken together, these
data support clinical use of PF-06747143 in combination with
SOC in AML, including patients who have developed resistance to
chemotherapy.
CXCR4 Ab–induced cell mobilization duration is
dependent on Fc-effector function
Mobilization of malignant cells from growth factor–rich BM niches
into the PB increases the sensitivity of these cells to therapy.
However, prolonged mobilization has the potential to redistribute
the malignant cells and may lead to safety-related issues, such as
hyperleukocytosis.32 To determine the ability of PF-06747143 to
mobilize tumor cells in vivo, we used the MV4-11 AML disseminated
mouse model. Animals with high tumor burden (day 12) postimplant
were treated with a single dose of PF-06747143 (10 mg/kg). PB
samples were evaluated at various time points postdose to determine
human AML malignant cell mobilization in PB by flow cytometry
(hCD451hCD331) and Ab exposure by enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (Figure 7A). PF-06747143 induced MV4-11 cell
mobilization, with a peak observed at 3 hours postdose, followed
by a rapid decrease in PB mobilized cells observed at 16 and
24 hours postdose. These results demonstrate that PF-06747143
has the ability to induce malignant cell mobilization, as expected for
a CXCR4 antagonist, but the mobilization is followed by a rapid
reduction in PB cell number, with levels similar to baseline at 24 hours
postdose. Because PF-06747143 serum concentration was high
and sustained over the 24-hour study duration (supplemental Figure 5),

From 
 we hypothesized that malignant AML cell number reduction at 16 and
24 hour time points is likely because of the cytotoxic Fc-effector
function of the Ab.
CXCR4 antagonists have been shown to mobilize leukocytes or
WBCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) (CD341) in NHPs
or patients.28,29 In order to evaluate the role of Fc-effector function in
cell mobilization, we compared m15-IgG1 and m15-IgG4 effects in
WBCs in NHPs. After a single dose, mobilization of WBCs in the PB
was observed with both Ab’s; however, there were some sharp
differences observed. The mean peak concentration of WBCs in m15-
IgG1–treated animals (40 3 103 cells per mL) was lower than that for
the m15-IgG4 group (54 3 103 cells per mL). Moreover, m15-IgG1
peak mobilization occurred at 1 hour postdose, which was earlier than
that for the m15-IgG4 group (6 hours) (Figure 7B). Furthermore,
transient mobilization, with a rapid decline to baseline levels, similar to
that of vehicle-treated animals, was observed with m15-IgG1 at 24
hours postdose, and m15-IgG4 led to prolonged and sustained
mobilization, with high WBC counts 2.6-fold above baseline, at 4 days
(96 hours) postdose. In a separate WBC mobilization study in NHPs,
the ability of PF-06747143 to induce rapid and transient WBC cell
mobilization was evaluated (Figure 7C). Two weekly doses of PF-
06747143 Ab (days 1 and 8 [168 hours]) were administered. The
PF-06747143 mobilization profile was very similar to its parent Ab
(m15-IgG1); WBCs were rapidly mobilized between 1 and 6 hours
postdose, and mobilized levels came down to baseline at 24 hours
postdose. The HPCs (CD341) mobilization profile was charac-
terized in NHPs treated with 2 weekly doses of PF-06747143
(Figure 7D). The CD341 cells followed a similar mobilization
pattern to that of the WBCs, with rapid mobilization into PB
between 1 and 6 hours postdose, returning to baseline levels after
24 hours, and no significant depletion of the CD341 cells relative
to baseline was observed.
The differences between the IgG1 and IgG4 CXCR4 Ab’s observed
in these studies are most likely related to the ability of the IgG1 Ab to
induce cell killing through Fc-effector function (ADCC/CDC),
whereas such activity is not observed with the IgG4 Ab (Figure 2A,C).
PF-06747143 induced cell mobilization followed by rapid reduction
of mobilized cell numbers in PB. The WBCs or HPCs numbers did
not reach levels significantly below baseline, indicative of an adequate
safety profile related to leukocytes.

 Discussion
One of the major limitations of chemotherapy-based treatments for
AML and other hematologic malignancies has been the failure to clear
cancer cells protected by the BM environment. The CXCR4 receptor
and its ligand, CXCL12, control processes critical for tumor cell
homing and retention in the BM niche. Consistent with the protective
role that this pathway plays, increased activity of this signaling axis is
correlated with poor prognosis.4,7,8,39,40 CXCR4 inhibitors currently
being evaluated in the clinic, including small molecules,23 peptides,24,25
and an IgG4 Ab,27-30 can mobilize tumor cells, sensitizing them to cell
killing by chemotherapy.17,41 PF-06747143, a novel humanized IgG1
Ab, binds to CXCR4 and potently inhibits CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated
cell signaling pathways such as cAMP and cancer cell migration.
These characteristics are in line with those of other CXCR4 inhibitors.
However, here we demonstrated that PF-06747143 has an additional
potent mechanism of action, related to the ability to induce tumor
cytotoxicity via Fc-effector function (ADCC and CDC), which is not
present in the other CXCR4 inhibitors currently in clinical trials.
Moreover, the Fc-effector activity of PF-06747143 in vitro was com-
parable to that of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal Ab, whose main
mechanism of action in the clinic relies largely on effector function.34
The importance of effector function for antitumor activity was de-
monstrated comparing the in vivo activities of PF-06747143 parent Ab,
m15-IgG1, to that of its IgG4 version, m15-IgG4, which is deprived of
Fc-effector function. The m15-IgG1 Ab had superior TGI, associated
with a significant increase in cell death in tumors.
Furthermore, the antitumor effect observed with PF-06747143
across multiple hematologic malignancy in vivo models suggests
that the Fc-effector function activity translates into strong efficacy.
As a monotherapy, PF-06747143 induced sustained tumor re-
gression, dramatically reduced BM tumor burden, and improved
survival in NHL, MM, and AML staged mouse tumor models.
Importantly, PF-06747143 had robust combinatorial efficacy with a
wide range of SOC agents, including bortezomib in an MM model
and daunorubicin plus Ara-C in an AML chemotherapy-resistant
PDX model. Overall, these data support a potential for effective use
of PF-06747143 in combination regimens and in patients that
develop resistance to chemotherapy.
The ability of CXCR4 antagonists to mobilize tumor cells into the PB
and to sensitize them to chemotherapy was previously described in
AML and MM patients.18,41,42 However, strategies that simply mobilize
malignant cells into circulation, without prompt elimination of these
cells, have the potential to lead to serious safety-related issues, such as
hyperleukocytosis.32 Our results show that PF-06747143, and its
parent Ab m15-IgG1, mobilized cells to the PB in both mice and NHPs,
as monotherapies; yet this mobilization was rapid and transient, with the
number of mobilized cell levels returning back to baseline at no later
than 24 hours postdose. In contrast, treatment with m15-IgG4 induced
a sustained level of mobilized WBCs in the PB, lasting for at least
4 days. This is similar to reports of prolonged WBC mobilization
observed in NHPs following monotherapy treatment with the IgG4
CXCR4 Ab, ulocuplumab, where the WBC levels returned to baseline
only after 15 days postdose.28 Sustained malignant cell mobilization
was also reported in MM and AML patients treated with ulocuplumab
as a monotherapy.20,28,29 These observations indicate that Fc-effector
function may decrease the risk of prolonged cell mobilization in patients.
In summary, in comparison with CXCR4 antagonists currently being
evaluated in clinical trials, PF-06747143 exhibits a differentiated
product profile because of its unique mechanisms of action.
Treatment with PF-06747143 is a one-two punch therapeutic
approach, resulting in (1) disruption of CXCR4/CXCL12 axis
leading to rapid malignant cell mobilization from protective niches
(2) and tumor cell killing via Fc-effector function. Taken together, the
robust efficacy and safety margins observed in preclinical models
suggest the potential of PF-06747143 as a best-in-class CXCR4-
targeted treatment of hematologic cancers. A phase 1 clinical trial
evaluation of PF-06747143 is currently underway (registered at
www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02954653).
