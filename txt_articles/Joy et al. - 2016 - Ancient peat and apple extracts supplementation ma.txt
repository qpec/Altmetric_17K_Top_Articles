Abstract
Background: Increased cellular ATP levels have the potential to enhance athletic performance. A proprietary blend
of ancient peat and apple extracts has been supposed to increase ATP production. Therefore, the purpose of this
investigation was to determine the effects of this supplement on athletic performance when used during 12 weeks
of supervised, periodized resistance training.
Methods: Twenty-five healthy, resistance-trained, male subjects completed this study. Subjects supplemented once
daily with either 1 serving (150 mg) of a proprietary blend of ancient peat and apple extract (TRT) or an equal-volume,
visually-identical placebo (PLA) daily. Supervised resistance training consisted of 8 weeks of daily undulating periodized
training followed by a 2 week overreach and a 2 week taper phase. Strength was determined using 1-repetition-
maximum (1RM) testing in the barbell back squat, bench press (BP), and deadlift exercises. Peak power and peak
velocity were determined during BP at 30 % 1RM and vertical jump tests as well as a 30s Wingate test, which also
provided relative power (watt:mass)
Results: A group x time interaction was present for squat 1RM, deadlift 1RM, and vertical jump peak power and
peak velocity. Squat and deadlift 1RM increased in TRT versus PLA from pre to post. Vertical jump peak velocity
increased in TRT versus PLA from pre to week 10 as did vertical jump peak power, which also increased from pre
to post. Wingate peak power and watt:mass tended to favor TRT.
Conclusions: Supplementing with ancient peat and apple extract while participating in periodized resistance
training may enhance performance adaptations.

Background
Adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP) and ATP metabolites are
involved in numerous biological processes including car-
diac function, neurotransmission, blood flow, and muscle
contraction [1, 2], and it has been suggested that increased
ATP levels correlate with improved health and perform-
ance [3–5]. Direct supplementation with exogenous ATP
has demonstrated divergent results in terms of increasing
ATP when measured in whole blood [3, 6, 7]. Therefore,
supplementation strategies for increasing endogenous ATP
levels may be desirable. Previously, oral supplementation
with a proprietary blend of ancient peat and apple extracts
have been demonstrated to increase intracellular ATP
levels in whole blood and intramuscular levels of ATP in
resting subjects, suggesting increased activity of bodily pro-
cesses that lead to endogenous ATP production [8, 9].
Previous research has found oral supplementation with
a proprietary blend of ancient peat and apple extracts to

 increase ATP concentrations in whole blood of resting
subjects as well as intramuscular concentrations in one
volunteer [9]. Preliminary reports from this laboratory
suggest this occurs without an increase in reactive oxy-
gen species, which may be associated with increased
ATP production [10]. In fact, ancient peat and apple
extracts may actually decrease reactive oxygen species
[8], possibly blunting a potential increase caused by re-
sistance training [11].
Another nutritional supplement that has been well
documented as an ergogenic aid via modulation of the
phosphagen energy system is creatine monohydrate.
While it would be bold to suspect another supplement
to match the myriad of athletic performance benefits of
creatine at present, it stands to reason that other ATP-
enhancing supplements would be the premier candi-
dates. In brief, creatine has demonstrated efficacy for
improving maximal strength, peak power, and fatigue
resistance [12, 13]. The primary mechanism for crea-
tine’s ergogenic effects is via rephosphorylation of ad-
enosine diphosphate to ATP via creatine phosphate
[14, 15]. Thus, the potential exists for ATP increased
through alternative means to also increase strength,
power, and exercise tolerance.
Despite these observations, supplementation for indirect
ATP enhancement is yet to be evaluated for potential to
augment performance in response to resistance training.
However, the existing data on ancient peat and apple ex-
tracts for increasing both whole blood and muscle ATP
levels [8, 9] and muscle mass [16] support the plausibility
for chronic supplementation yielding positive augmenta-
tion of performance following resistance training. There-
fore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects
of a proprietary blend of ancient peat and apple extracts
on athletic performance. It was hypothesized that supple-
mentation would improve strength and power over the
duration of the training program as well as blunt a decre-
ment in performance due to overreaching.
Methods
Participants
Twenty-five healthy, resistance-trained, male subjects
(28 ± 5y; 176.0 ± 6.5 cm; 83.2 ± 12.1 kg) completed this
double-blind study. 33 subjects were recruited, and 3
subjects did not complete the study due to scheduling
conflicts, 3 were not compliant with protocols, and 2
sustained injuries during the study unrelated to training
or supplementation. All subjects were prohibited from
using any supplements not provided in the study except
for a multivitamin or protein powder food substitute,
which they were not permitted to use within 2 h before
or after resistance training sessions. Each subject was re-
quired to be capable of lifting 1.5x their bodyweight in
the squat and deadlift and 1x bodyweight in the bench
press. At baseline, the placebo (PLA) group was able to
squat 1.71 ± 0.21, bench press 1.45 ± 0.19, and deadlift
2.17 ± 0.25 times their bodyweight, and the treatment
(TRT) group was able to squat 1.66 ± 0.24, bench press
1.31 ± 0.20, and deadlift 1.93 ± 0.27 times their body-
weight. Approval for research with human subjects was
obtained from the MusclePharm Sports Science Institute
IRB (accredited by the United States Department of Health
and Human Services), and protocols conformed to the
standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of
Helsinki. No members of the IRB were involved in study
conception, design, data collection, data analysis, or data
interpretation. Subjects provided their written informed
consent prior to participation in the study.
Experimental design
Subjects were randomly assigned to either the PLA (n = 11)
or TRT (n = 14) groups. They were instructed to consume
1 serving (2 mL) of either PLA or TRT (elevATP®, VDF
FutureCeuticals Inc., Momence, IL; 150 mg) 45 min prior
to training on training days or at a similar time of day on
rest days. The supplement was provided as a liquid with li-
posomes (QuSomes, BioZone Laboratories Inc., Pittsburg,
CA), and the instructed dose was marked on the dropper
provided with the vial. PLA consisted of a flavor-matched
liquid with identical liposomes added. A third-party,
BioZone Laboratories Inc., assembled the TRT and PLA
supplements and provided disclosure as to their exact
composition to verify subjects received the supplement as
described and nothing more. Despite this assumption, the
ingredients were not independently verified, and thus,
exact contents cannot be confirmed. Supplement vials
were weighed to ensure compliance. Subjects were resist-
ance trained under the guidance of a certified strength
and conditioning specialist 3 days per week for 8 weeks
followed by a 2 week overreach and 2 week taper phase
corresponding to weeks 9–10 and 11–12, respectively, in a
design identical to that previously described [16]. A euca-
loric diet consisting of 50 % calories from carbohydrates,
25 % from protein, and 25 % from fat was prescribed to all
subjects at the onset of the study, and diets were tracked
weekly via 3-day food logs. Total calories were deter-
mined for each individual based on the Mifflin St. Jeor
equation adjusted for activity level [17]. Subjects were
measured at weeks 0, 4, 8, 10, and 12 for all perform-
ance variables. Variables collected consisted of upper
and lower body power, upper and lower body maximal
strength, maximal and average anaerobic power, upper
and lower body strength endurance, irisin, interleukin-6
(IL-6), IL-15, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21), myo-
nectin, cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and growth
differentiation factor-11 (GDF-11). Blood draws were con-
ducted at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.

 Resistance training program
The resistance training program performed by all sub-
jects has been previously reported [16]. Briefly, weeks
1–8 (standard resistance training phase) consisted of
one muscle hypertrophy-oriented workout, one power-
oriented workout, and one strength-oriented workout
featuring cycle ergometer Wingates following strength
training. The back squat, bench press, and deadlift exercises
were performed on each day along with several other multi-
and single-joint exercises. Participants rested 48–72 h
between each training day. During the overreach phase
(weeks 9 and 10), participants performed high volume
workouts on Monday through Thursday with a strength-
oriented workout or performance testing conducted on
Friday for weeks 9 and 10, respectively. The taper phase
(weeks 11 and 12) consisted of one power day on Mondays
then strength and power days on both Wednesdays and
Fridays performed at low volume for back squat, bench
press, and deadlift only. One serving (35 g) of a whey pro-
tein supplement
(Combat, MusclePharm Corporation,
Denver, CO) providing 25 g of protein, 5 g of carbohydrate,
and 1.5 g of fat was provided to all subjects immediately
following exercise on all training days.
Measurements
Measurements rotated between upper and lower body ex-
ercises to provide localized rest (about 15–20 min), and
they were conducted in the order which they are pre-
sented herein. Maximal strength was determined using 1-
repetition maximum (1RM) tests in the barbell back
squat, bench press (BP), and deadlift exercises. Subjects
were required to descend such that the anterior hip crease
descended below the top of the knee during the squat
1RM test, to make contact with their chest without boun-
cing or removing their hips from the bench during the BP
1RM test, and they were prohibited from hitching motions
in the deadlift. Total strength was calculated as the sum of
squat, BP and deadlift 1RMs. All 1RMs were monitored
by a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist who
is also a competitive powerlifter. Lower and upper body
power was determined using a linear force transducer
(weightlifting analyzer, TENDO Sport Machines, Slovak
Republic) during a vertical jump and BP test. The great-
est value out of 3 tests for jump height, peak power,
and peak velocity were recorded while using a Vertec to
measure height. Upper body power was determined via
the BP exercise at 30 % 1RM. Subjects performed 3 sets
of 3 repetitions under the same rules as the 1RM test.
The greatest value for peak power and peak velocity
was recorded. Strength endurance was determined
using 50 % of each subject’s 1RM and by having them per-
form repetitions until reaching muscular failure in the
squat and bench press exercises. A repetition was sub-
tracted if the participant rested greater than 1 s at the top
for squat or at the top or bottom for bench press. Repeti-
tions performed were recorded, and repetitions x load was
used to calculate total work performed. Anaerobic power
output was determined using a 30s Wingate anaerobic
cycle ergometry test (WattBike, Woodway, Waukesha,
WI). Each Wingate test consisted of 1 min of light pedal-
ing (50–60 rpm), a 5 s sprint, 2 min of light pedaling,
another 5 s sprint, and another 2 min of light pedaling all
against no resistance prior to the 30s test. Seat height was
recorded during the first visit for each participant and
kept constant for every measure. Subjects were provided
strong verbal encouragement throughout the test. Peak
power, average power, watt:mass, and average speed were
recorded. Measurements were conducted at baseline and
repeated following weeks 4, 8, 10, and 12. The week 8, 10,
and 12 measurements were taken corresponding to the
end of the standard resistance training, over reach, and
taper phases, respectively. Test-retest separated by 7 days
resulted in an intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.965 for
all measures.
Serum analysis
Blood draws were performed via venipuncture by a trained
phlebotomist. Following a 10-h fast, all subjects submitted
a blood sample for analysis in the morning to control for
diurnal variations. Blood was drawn from the antecubital
vein into dry serum tubes (Vacutainer, Becton, Dickinson
and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Upon clotting, blood
was centrifuged and serum was collected for analysis.
Serum was centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min to pellet debris.
Irisin (Biovision, Milpitas, CA); myonectin (Aviscera Bio-
science Santa Clara, CA); GDF-11 (San Diego, CA); corti-
sol (Spring Valley, CA); FGF-21, IL-6, IL-15, and CRP (R &
D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were measured using quan-
titative sandwich ELISA kits, following the instructions
provided for each kit. Final reactions were measured using
a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)
at 450 nm optical density and final concentration of the
samples was calculated using SoftMax Pro 5.4 (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) via standard curves for reference.
Statistical analyses
Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to assess
group, time, and group by time interactions with a signifi-
cant p-value considered as ≤0.05. A Fisher LSD post-hoc
analysis was used to locate differences. Significant inter-
actions were further analyzed using dependent and in-
dependent T-tests for differences between time and
group, respectively. Observed power has been included
for variables with a significant interaction. Statistica
(Version 10, Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) was used for all statis-
tical analyses.

 Results
Baseline, diet, and training volume measurements
No significant differences were present at baseline for the
means or variances of the measured variables (p > 0.05),
nor were any differences found for total calories, carbohy-
drates, proteins, or fats consumed (p > 0.05). Total train-
ing volume (weight x repetitions x sets) was not different
between groups when analyzed as a gross score or by
weekly averages (p > 0.05).
Standard resistance training phase
Squat, BP, and deadlift 1RMs as well as total strength sig-
nificantly increased in both groups from baseline to week
8 (p < 0.05). However, no group x time interactions were
found for strength variables in this phase (p > 0.05). Verti-
cal jump peak power and BP peak power significantly in-
creased in both groups from baseline to week 8, and
vertical jump peak velocity also increased in PLA during
this time (p < 0.05), while TRT did not (p > 0.05). However,
no group x time interactions were found for power var-
iables in this phase (p > 0.05). A trend was observed for
irisin (p = 0.061). Analysis of the delta values indicate
irisin decreased to a greater extent in PLA versus TRT
from week 4 to week 8 (p < 0.05), but no group x time
interaction was detected (p = 0.06).
Overreach and taper phases
Significant time and group x time interactions (p < 0.01)
were present for squat and deadlift 1RM as well as total
strength (observed power > 0.6809). Squat 1RM increased
to a greater extent in TRT than PLA from week 8 to
weeks 10 and 12; deadlift increased to a greater extent in
TRT than PLA from week 8 to week 12; and total strength
increased in TRT versus PLA from week 8 to week 12
(Fig. 1). There were significant time and group x time ef-
fects (p < 0.05) for vertical jump peak power and peak vel-
ocity (observed power > 0.8169). vertical jump peak power
significantly (p < 0.05) increased in TRT from week 8 to
weeks 10 and 12 (Fig. 2), and vertical jump peak velocity
increased from weeks 8 to 10, while PLA experienced dec-
rements in both variables at these time points. There were
significant time and group x time interactions (p < 0.01)
for bench press strength endurance and strength endur-
ance total volume (observed power > 0.8229). Wherein,
TRT performed more repetitions and total work than
PLA at week 10.
Pre to post
Significant time and group x time interactions (p < 0.05)
were found for deadlift 1RM, which increased to a greater
extent in TRT than PLA from week 0 to week 12 (ob-
served power = 0.9714). Wingate-determined peak power
(p = 0.059) and watt:mass (p = 0.054) tended to increase
to a greater degree in the TRT group. Performance data
is presented in Table 1, and blood data is presented in
Table 2. Individual changes in total strength are pre-
sented in Fig. 3.
Discussion
In agreement with the hypotheses, the supplement ap-
peared to beneficially augment strength and power adap-
tations to resistance training and attenuate power loss
during overreaching. Squat and deadlift 1RM both in-
creased to a greater degree in TRT than in PLA, but no ef-
fect was observed for bench press 1RM. However, a lack
of effect for bench press did not prevent total strength
from significantly increasing. Peak power in the vertical
jump seemed to increase as a result of training and sup-
plementation, and vertical jump peak power and peak vel-
ocity did not decline following overreaching. Moreover,
strength endurance was preserved during overreaching in
TRT compared to PLA. Blood markers were measured as
an exploratory, secondary measure. While significant in-
teractions were not anticipated, supplementation with a
proprietary blend of ancient peat and apple extracts may

 affect irisin levels. However, further research with blood
markers as a main outcome is necessary for confirmation.
It is also imperative to discuss the supplement as it per-
tains specifically to the overreaching phase of the study.
The overreaching phase might be defined as a period of
exercise training which increases the training stimulus to
an amount that exceeds recovery, and the most sensitive
and applicable measures of overreaching are temporary
decreases in performance [18]. By temporarily, but largely
increasing training volume for 2 weeks from week 8 to
week 10 in the present study, significant interactions were
found for vertical jump peak power and peak velocity be-
tween the TRT and PLA groups, in which TRT increased
from the beginning to end of the overreach phase while
PLA decreased. While it would be expected for both
groups to decrease power output during this phase, only
PLA had a small decrease compared to a notable increase
in TRT, suggesting that the training stimulus meagerly
exceeded normal recovery capacity, but the TRT group
was able to adequately recover during this time and ex-
perience improvements in performance. This may not
only have implications for athletes, but also for military
and other situations involving an abnormally great phys-
ical demand [19].
While it is possible that circulating irisin mediated some
effects of supplementation [20], it is unlikely that it was
largely responsible for the present observations. ATP has
long been believed to enhance vasodilation and blood flow
[21–23], and recently direct ATP supplementation has
been reported to enhance the blood flow and vasodilatory
response to exercise [24]. This may enhance nutrient deliv-
ery and waste product removal, thereby enhancing recov-
ery [25, 26]. Moreover, the present supplement has been
reported to enhance mitochondrial ATP production [8, 9].
Thus, it is also possible that the proprietary blend of an-
cient peat and apple extracts increased intracellular ATP
and provided more substrate for the phosphagen energy
system, such as the mechanism of supplemental creatine
which has well documented effects on strength and power
[27, 28]. Although in opposition of this potential mechan-
ism, we did not observe any differences in total training
volume between groups apart from a difference in BP
strength endurance volume following the overreach phase,
so this prospective must also be examined more closely
with further research, as increased training volume would
be expected with a supplement with a similar mechanism
to creatine [12]. Furthermore, the strength and power ad-
aptations observed were likely facilitated through increases
in muscle mass [16]. Collectively, increased blood flow
may enhance the substrate pool and increased intracellular
ATP each create a greater energetic, and possibly anabolic
environment through inhibition of adenosine monopho-
sphate kinase [29], which may enhance acute and chronic
resistance training performance.
A secondary hypothesis for the present observations
could be linked to reactive oxygen species and oxidative
stress, which ancient peat and apple extracts may reduce
[8]. Previous research with flavanol- and/or catechin-based
ingredients have reported improved athletic performance
markers, potentially due to a reduction in oxidative stress
and improved mitochondrial function. Epigallocatechin-3-
gallate supplementation has previously demonstrated
efficacy for improving maximal oxygen consumption
[30], and green tea extracts have reduced peroxide for-
mation in response to exercise [31]. Therefore, ancient
peat and apple extracts may have an antioxidant effect,
lending insight to the ingredient’s potential to improve
fatigue resistance.
The present study is in agreement with previous re-
ports on direct ATP supplementation and the resistance
training-induced effects on performance variables. Wherein,
strength increased as a result of supplementation. Similarly,

Page 5 of 9
 vertical jump peak power was preserved during the over-
reach phase. However, the proprietary blend of ancient
peat and apple extracts may be better suited to resist per-
formance decrements, as a decline in performance was
only observed in the PLA group in the present study,
whereas both the supplemented and placebo groups de-
clined in previous observations of direct ATP supplemen-
tation [32]. Additionally, the present study observed an
increase in Wingate watt:mass ratio, indicating the TRT
group may have increased power output independent of
any potential changes in body composition.
While it may not be appropriate to compare direct and
indirect ATP enhancement due to their dissimilar composi-
tions and dosage levels, and because their respective mech-
anisms of action are likely different, the ergogenic effects of
direct ATP supplementation have also been reported in dif-
ferent settings. Rathmacher et al. [33] observed an effect of
supplementation for improving set 2 minimum peak torque

 and decreasing set 3 muscle fatigue. Moreover, Jordan et al.
[3] indicated beneficial effects for total repetitions and total
volume performed following 2 weeks supplementation with
oral ATP. Each of these studies supports the present find-
ings of an effect for bench press strength endurance. In the
present study, bench press strength endurance only reached
significance following the overreach phase, suggesting sup-
plementation maintains strength endurance. No effects
were observed for squat strength endurance, and this may
be due to a more rapid increase in squat 1RM compared to
BP 1RM resulting in an inability to maintain work output.
Moreover, the lack of effects observed for upper body
strength and power is more likely a result of the lower-
body emphasis of training versus a local effect of supple-
mentation. The present study is also limited by the volume
of performance testing performed within a single day, such
that variables from the strength endurance or Wingate tests
may have undergone a more robust change than observed

 due to accumulated fatigue despite the measurements hav-
ing a high degree of reliability. Moreover, examination of
blood or tissue ATP levels would strengthen the present
study, as blood or tissue levels of ATP have not be con-
firmed to increase with chronic use of ancient peat and
apple extracts.
Conclusion
This is the first study examining the ergogenic potential of
endogenous ATP enhancement with supplementation. The
proprietary blend of ancient peat and apple extracts were
capable of increasing lower body and total strength as well
as lower body power output compared at an equal-volume,
visually-identical placebo. Moreover, the supplement was
able to prevent performance decrements commonly asso-
ciated with increased training volume and overreaching.
However, the supplement does not appear to augment
cortisol and other blood markers of recovery aside from
possibly altering irisin. Future research should seek to
evaluate the acute effects of the supplement as well as the
effects of the supplement in an endurance exercise setting,
as the current purported mechanism is mitochondrial
ATP production.
