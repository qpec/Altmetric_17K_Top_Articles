AbstrAct
background This study evaluates changes in sales of 
non-alcoholic beverages in Jamie’s Italian, a national 
chain of commercial restaurants in the UK, following the 
introduction of a £0.10 per-beverage levy on sugar-
sweetened beverages (SSBs) and supporting activity 
including beverage menu redesign, new products and 
establishment of a children’s health fund from levy 
proceeds.
Methods We used an interrupted time series design 
to quantify changes in sales of non-alcoholic beverages 
12 weeks and 6 months after implementation of the 
levy, using itemised electronic point of sale data. 
Main outcomes were number of SSBs and other non-
alcoholic beverages sold per customer. Linear regression 
and multilevel random effects models, adjusting for 
seasonality and clustering, were used to investigate 
changes in SSB sales across all restaurants (n=37) and 
by tertiles of baseline restaurant SSB sales per customer.
results Compared with the prelevy period, the 
number of SSBs sold per customer declined by 11.0% 
(−17.3% to −4.3%) at 12 weeks and 9.3% (−15.2% 
to −3.2%) at 6 months. For non-levied beverages, sales 
per customer of children’s fruit juice declined by 34.7% 
(−55.3% to −4.3%) at 12 weeks and 9.9% (−16.8% 
to −2.4%) at 6 months. At 6 months, sales per customer 
of fruit juice increased by 21.8% (14.0% to 30.2%) 
but sales of diet cola (−7.3%; −11.7% to −2.8%) and 
bottled waters (−6.5%; −11.0% to −1.7%) declined. 
Changes in sales were only observed in restaurants in 
the medium and high tertiles of baseline SSB sales per 
customer.
conclusions Introduction of a £0.10 levy on SSBs 
alongside complementary activities is associated with 
declines in SSB sales per customer in the short and 
medium term, particularly in restaurants with higher 
baseline sales of SSBs.
IntroductIon
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) 
is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardio-
vascular disease and dental caries.1–5 In the UK, 
an adult consumes an average of 50 kcal per day 
and children consume an average of 100 kcal from 
SSBs.6 SSBs may account for half of the excess calo-
ries consumed per day by children.7 Randomised 
controlled trials show that decreasing consumption 
of SSBs can reduce weight gain and body mass index 
in children and adolescents.6 7 Reducing intakes of 
SSBs has therefore been identified as an important 
in improving cardiometabolic health.3 8
In recent years, there has been increasing interest 
in the use of fiscal measures as instruments to reduce 
the consumption of SSBs as part of wider popula-
tion-based strategies to prevent non-communicable 
disease.9–11 However, there is limited primary 
evidence on the effectiveness of fiscal measures on 
either the sale or consumption of SSBs.9 Research 
in this area mainly comprises modelling studies, 
laboratory experiments and small field studies in 
cafeterias in schools and workplaces.7 9 State-level 
regulation is relatively rare, with evaluations of 
these rarer still, but where excise taxes on SSBs have 
been introduced and evaluated, such as in Mexico 
or Berkeley, California, they have been associated 
with short-term reductions in SSB purchases.10 12–18
On the 1 September 2015, Jamie’s Italian, a 
national chain of UK restaurants, added a £0.10 
levy to the price of non-alcoholic SSBs sold within 
them. The prelevy price of SSBs ranged from £2.60 
to £3.25 (excluding the levy), thus addition of the 
levy equated to a price increase of 3.1%–3.8%. 
Other non-alcoholic beverages were similar in 
price, ranging from £2.00 and £3.95. In combi-
nation with the introduction of the levy, Jamie’s 
Italian reorganised the non-alcoholic beverage 
menu into two sections: SSBs and other beverages 
(juices, bottled waters and diet cola). In addition, 
fruit spritzers (fruit juice mixed with water) were 
added to the main non-alcoholic beverage menu. 
Text (see figure 1) on the SSB section of the non-al-
coholic beverage menu explained the decision to 
implement the levy and that proceeds from the levy 
would go directly to a Children’s Health Fund that 
offered grants for children’s health initiatives. Intro-
duction of the levy was supported by a Channel 4 
television documentary ‘Jamie’s Sugar Rush’, first 
broadcast on 3 September 2015.19 Thus, the levy 
can be seen as a complex ‘intervention’ comprising 
a fiscal component (a price rise) in combination 
with other non-fiscal components that could plau-
sibly help reduce purchases of SSBs.
We take advantage of this natural experiment to 
assess whether the implementation of the levy in

research report
combination with non-price activities (for convenience referred 
to as the ‘intervention’) is associated with changes in sales of 
non-alcoholic beverages. We use an interrupted time series (ITS) 
design to compare the number of SSBs, and other non-alco-
holic beverages, sold per customer before implementation of 
the intervention with sales at 12 weeks and 6 months after. We 
use itemised electronic point of sale (EPOS) data and investigate 
the effect of the intervention across all restaurants and whether 
this effect varies by tertiles of baseline restaurant SSB sales per 
customer.
Methods
In evaluations of natural experiments, the researcher has no 
control over the design and delivery of the intervention.20 The 
intervention was implemented in all restaurants simultaneously 
by Jamie’s Italian for logistical and commercial reasons and was 
outside the control of the research team. For this study, rando-
misation was therefore not possible and as no suitable control 
condition existed, a pragmatic evaluation using an ITS design21 
was employed. ITS approaches are considered as the strongest 
design available in such contexts and have been widely used in 
evaluations of public health interventions.12 Here, we use Jandoc 
et al’s recommended guidance for the transparent reporting of 
studies using ITS designs.22
data
Itemised time-series data on the number of all non-alcoholic 
beverages sold in each of 37 eligible restaurants were extracted 
from the Jamie’s Italian EPOS system (MICROS Retail Systems) 
and provided to the authors by the company. To be eligible for 
inclusion, restaurants had to be operating between 23 June 2014 
and 28 February 2016. To assess short-term (12 
weeks) changes 
in sales, we used restaurant-aggregated itemised weekly data on 
the number of beverages sold from 8 June 2015 to 22 November 
2015 in 37 restaurants. This equated to a time series of n=24 
weeks, with 12 weeks of data either side of the implementation 
date of the intervention. To assess medium-term changes in sales 
at 6 months, we analysed the itemised number of beverages sold 
over 23 periods of 4 weeks each, starting from 23 June 2014 
to 28 February 2016, from each of the 37 restaurants. These 
4 
weekly periods are standard company accounting periods, 
and we used data from the maximum number of periods avail-
able through the EPOS system. As the implementation date 
(1 September 2015) of the levy fell in the middle of a 4-week 
accounting period, data for that period were split into 2-week 
periods to allow for the specification of an exact implementa-
tion date in analyses. The numbers of beverages sold were stan-
dardised by adjusting for the number of customers visiting each 
restaurant. To do this, we divided the number of beverages sold 
by the number of ‘covers’ for each restaurant (one cover is equal 
to one adult or child customer) in each period, including the 
period split in two.
Non-alcoholic beverages were separated into two main groups: 
on-menu and off-menu. On-menu refers to beverages present on 
the restaurant beverage menu (see figure 1). Off-menu refers 
to beverages that could be requested by the customer but were 
not listed on the menu. For the on-menu group, beverages were 
split into five categories: (1) SSBs subject to the levy, (2) fruit 
juices, (3) fruit juices on the children’s menu, (4) diet cola and 
(5) bottled water (see online supplementary appendix 1). Bever-
ages not listed on the menu were split into two categories: (6) 
SSBs subject to the levy and (7) ‘mixers’, which were not levied. 
In addition, separate categories were created for fruit spritz (a 
mix of water and fruit juices), beverages, introduced to the main 
menu when the intervention was implemented and children’s 
‘fruity water’ and milk, introduced to the children’s menu in 
June 2015. This categorisation allowed assessment of the main 
effect of the intervention on sales of SSBs and exploration of 
possible substitution effects. Data on tap water orders were not 
recorded through the EPOS system. A further 1.3% of all drinks 
sold during the study period were excluded as they did not fit 
the categories above (eg, slim-line tonics, smoothies and cordial 
drinks).
First, changes in the number of non-alcoholic beverages sold 
per customer across all restaurants at 12 weeks and 6 months 
were explored. Second, these analyses were stratified by tertiles 
of baseline restaurant on-menu SSB sales per customer (low: 
n=12 restaurants; medium: n=13 restaurants; and high: n=12 
restaurants) and assessed at 6 months only. Online supplemen-
tary appendix 2 lists the locations of included restaurants.
statistical analysis
Changes in non-alcoholic beverage sales associated with the 
intervention in the ITS were modelled as an immediate step 
change in the log-transformed number of beverages sold per 
customer. The step change was defined as a categorical vari-
able equal to zero before implementation (up to 31 August) and 
one afterwards. This assumes an immediate and stable effect 
of the intervention.21 We did not analyse changes in trends 
as the postintervention period was too short for meaningful 
interpretation.
Estimates using weekly data were adjusted for time trend 
in number of beverages sold per customer and estimates using 
4 
weekly data additionally adjusted for quarterly seasonal effects 
(see online supplementary appendix 3). Analyses of aggregated 
weekly data were conducted using simple linear regression as data 
were only available at the aggregate level (ie, for 37 restaurants 
combined). Analyses of 4 
weekly data were conducted using a hier-
archical multilevel model with restaurant-specific random effects 
in intercept and trend. We report robust standard errors to account 
for residual autocorrelation and clustering. Magnitude and statis-
tical significance of the coefficient of the categorical variable 
was used to assess the changes associated with the intervention 
(see online supplementary appendix 3 for details on the model). 
Estimated coefficients were exponentiated and expressed as a 
percentage change in the number of beverages sold per customer. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted that tested the robustness of 
the timing of the effect by varying the date of implementation to

results
In the 12 months prior to the introduction of the intervention 
2 058 581 non-alcoholic beverages were sold within study-eli-
gible restaurants, of which 38% (n=775 
230) were SSBs. Table 1 
shows the mean number of beverages sold per 4-weekly period 
in each category per restaurant and per customer. Before and 
after the introduction of the intervention, SSBs were the most 
commonly purchased non-alcoholic beverage per restaurant 
and per customer, followed by bottled water and diet cola. On 
a per-customer basis, after introduction of the intervention, an 
increase in the mean number of fruit juices (main menu) sold 
and reductions in the SSB, diet cola and children’s fruit juice 
categories were observed. Table 2 reports the mean number of 
newly introduced beverages (fruit spritz, children’s fruity water 
and children’s milk) sold per 4-weekly period by restaurant and 
by customer. Compared with existing beverages, overall sales of 
these new beverages were low.
changes in sales of ssbs
Table 3 reports the percentage change in the mean number of 
beverages sold per customer at 12 weeks and 6 
months after 
introduction of the intervention across all restaurants, compared 
with the preintervention period (see online supplementary 
appendix 4 for graphs of time series data). At 12 weeks, the 
intervention was associated with an 11.04% (95% CI −17.30% 
to −4.30%; p=0.003) decrease in the mean number of on-menu 
SSBs sold per customer compared with the 12-week period 
preceding the intervention, adjusting for trend. At 6 months, 
change in sales was smaller, with the intervention associated with 
a 9.34% (95% CI −15.21% to −3.15%; p=0.004) decrease in 
mean number of on-menu SSBs sold per customer. No changes 
in sales of off-menu SSBs were observed. Changes in sales at 
6 
months differed by tertile of baseline restaurant SSB sales 
per customer. Table 4 shows that the intervention was associ-
ated with a 12.8% (95% CI −19.27% to −5.82%; p=0.001) 
reduction in the number of on-menu SSBs sold per customer in 
high SSB sales restaurants and a reduction of 16.47% (95% CI 
−20.55% to −12.19%; p<0.001) in medium SSB sales restau-
rants, compared with the preintervention period. No changes in 
sales were observed in low SSB sales restaurants. In medium SSB 
sales restaurants, introduction of the intervention was associated 
with a 11.40% (95% CI −17.30% to −4.97%; p=0.001) fall in 
the number of off-menu SSBs sold per customer, but no associa-
tion was found in either low or high SSB sales restaurants.
changes in sales of other non-alcoholic beverages
Table 3 shows that the intervention was associated with 
increases and decreases in the number of non-levied beverages 
sold per customer at 12 weeks and 6 months, compared with 
the preintervention period. At 12 weeks, the intervention was 
associated with a 21.53% (95% CI 8.22% to 36.62%; p=0.002) 
increase in the number of off-menu mixers sold per customer 
and a 34.69% (95% CI −55.43% to −4.30%; p=0.031) 
decrease in the number of children’s menu fruit juices sold per 
customer. At 6 months, the intervention was associated with an 
increase of 21.77% (95% CI 14.00% to 30.21%; p≤0.0001) 
in the number of fruit juices (main menu) sold per customer. 
However, the number of children’s menu fruit juices sold per 
customer decreased by 9.88% (95% CI −16.81% to −2.37%; 
p=0.011), diet cola decreased by 7.32% (95% CI −11.66% 
to −2.76%; p=0.002) and bottled water decreased by 6.48% 
(95% CI −11.04% to −1.69%; p=0.009). Stratified analysis 
(table 4) showed that the intervention was associated with 
an increase in the mean number of fruit juice (main menu) 
beverages sold per customer across all tertiles, with the largest

increase of 34.99% (95% CI 18.77% to 53.42%; p<0.001) 
observed in restaurants with the lowest baseline SSB sales per 
customer. There were decreases in the numbers of diet colas 
and bottled waters sold per customer, but associations were 
primarily observed in restaurants with medium baseline SSB 
sales. An association between the intervention and a decrease 
in the mean number of children’s fruit juices sold was observed 
in restaurants with the highest baseline SSB only (−14.36; 
95% CI −22.04% to −6.01%; p=0.001).
Sensitivity analyses of the robustness of the timing of the 
changes associated with the intervention confirmed the stron-
gest effects at the actual time of the implementation (see 
online supplementary appendix 5 for supplementary data).
dIscussIon
The introduction of a the £0.10 levy on SSBs combined with other 
supporting activities in Jamie’s Italian restaurants was associated 
with an 11.04% decrease in the mean number of on-menu SSBs 
sold per customer at 12 weeks and a 9.34% decrease at 6 
months. 
Decreases at 6 
months were only observed in restaurants with 
medium and high baseline SSB sales per customer, suggesting that 
the intervention may be more effective in restaurants with higher 
underlying sales of SSBs. Our analyses show a step decrease in 
number of SSBs sold per customer, and sensitivity analyses suggests 
this decrease occurred at time of implementation. This locates our 
observed changes at the point of the intervention’s introduction 
and strengthens the case for it being the likely explanation for our 
observed changes, rather than a general secular decline or as a 
result of other unobserved external factors.
We observed a general decrease in numbers of non-alco-
holic beverages sold per customer, with the exception of fruit 
juice, postintervention. This is counter to evaluations in other 
settings, such as Mexico, where there have been increases in 
sales of diet beverages and bottled water as substitutes for 
SSBs.12 Here, the provision of new beverage options and orders 
of tap water may have acted as substitutes and may partially 
account for the decline in sales of levied SSBs and other soft 
drinks. However, this is unlikely to be the sole explanation 
for the observed decline. Declines in SSBs sales were greater 
than declines in sales of other beverages, suggesting that 
other elements of the intervention (beyond provision of new 
beverage options) may be important.

research report
comparison with literature on fiscal interventions targeting 
ssb consumption
The changes observed in this study are relatively large given 
the size of the levy. However, recent evidence from Berkeley, 
California,18 showed that changes of the magnitude reported 
here may be plausible even when price rises are relatively small 
(21% decrease in sales in response to a penny-per-ounce tax18). 
Economic modelling and other evaluations suggest that sales 
reductions are similar in magnitude to the price change (a price 
elasticity of 0.8–1.2).12 23–27 In this study, we observed a decline 
in sales of 10%–12% in response to an average price increase of 
3.5%. While this difference could be due to price elasticities cited 
above being estimated using supermarket purchase data in more 
aggregated groupings and where such drinks are considerably 
cheaper, it could also suggest that changes observed here may not 
be entirely due to the price increase. A range of complementary 
activities were implemented alongside the levy, including beverage 
menu redesign, donation of proceeds to a children’s health fund, 
new beverages and widespread media coverage. The Jamie Oliver 
‘brand’ is also associated with campaigning on food and health 
issues. These factors may have acted in combination with the 
price increase suggesting that multifaceted interventions with a 
fiscal measure at their core may plausibly affect behaviour and 
have greater effects than interventions comprised solely of a fiscal 
component.
Importance of non-fiscal components for behaviour change
Research on the introduction of nominal taxes on single-use 
plastic bags suggests that psychological processes are important 
contributors to intervention effectiveness by modifying habitual 
behaviours through contextual change.28–30 In the case of plastic 
bags, contextual change comprises a nominal tax and a prompt 
at point of sale asking customers if they wish to purchase them. 
In economic studies of taxes on alcohol, price tags marked as 
‘tax-included’ on the shelf reduces sales at a greater rate than 
when supplementary taxes are applied at the cash register only.31 
Similar processes may be in operation here. In addition to the 
levy on SSBs (the price component), the non-price components 
can be seen as important elements of ‘contextual change’ that 
may prompt customers to adapt their behaviour either to avoid 
the levy for economic reasons or to bring their behaviour in line 
with underlying latent values.
The mean number of SSBs sold per customer was relatively small 
(0.174 beverages per customer) signifying that average absolute 
effects across the chain at 12 weeks and 6 months are correspond-
ingly small. However, as the consumption of SSBs is patterned 
by individual-level factors, such as age and socioeconomic posi-
tion,26 32 effects may be relatively larger in certain customer groups 
(such as children). As reductions observed here are per visit, repeat 
customers would likely see larger cumulative declines. As eating 
out of the home has increased over the last 40 years,33 the applica-
tion of such interventions across the commercial restaurant sector 
could have meaningful population health impact.34
strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. First, we use itemised objec-
tive data on all non-alcoholic beverage sales to assess changes in 
numbers of drinks sold after the intervention was introduced. 
This allowed categorisation of individual beverages into appro-
priate analytical groups. Second, using a panel format, we were 
able to control for variations in customers in different restau-
rants via restaurant specific random effects over time. Third, we 
were able to analyse changes using weekly and 4-weekly data. 
Both showed robust associations between the intervention and 
decreases in SSB sales, accounting for underlying trend.
Limitations included being only able to adjust numbers of bever-
ages sold by the overall number of customers, as disaggregated 
data on the number of adults and children visiting each restaurant 
are not routinely collected. Variations in the number of children 
visiting restaurants, beyond time and seasonal influences, may have 
biased estimates of changes in sales. Second, we could not model 
impacts using a price variable, as beverage prices did not vary across 
restaurants. Third, while for most restaurants the model fitted 
the 4-weekly data well, for three restaurants the fit was poorer. 
These were retained in the sample, as there was no indication that 
systematic errors were present in the data. As data are in 4-weekly 
periods that did not correspond to calendar months, we could not 
use external control variables to adjust for wider trends in beverage 
or hospitality sector sales. Finally, this study was undertaken in one 
chain of restaurants, limiting generalisability.
conclusIon
There is consistent evidence that reducing consumption of 
SSBs would be beneficial to health.1 2 14 15 Fiscal measures could 
discourage SSB purchases, and even small price changes may plau-
sibly reduce sales.18 35 Our findings suggest that the introduction 
of a small levy on SSBs combined with non-fiscal complementary 
activities is associated with declines in SSB sales when delivered 
at scale in a commercial restaurant setting. Further research 
evaluating such interventions in other restaurant settings, with 
a longer follow-up, is required to assess whether this is trans-
ferable, whether decreases in sales are sustained and whether 
reductions in sales translate into reductions in SSB consumption 
and to explore whether changes differ by population subgroups.
What is already known on this subject
 
► The WHO recently advocated the use of fiscal measures, such 
as taxes, to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened 
beverages (SSBs).
 
► While the potential impacts of SSB taxes on sales and 
consumption of SSBs have been estimated using modelling 
studies, primary studies evaluating the effects of such 
interventions delivered in a real-world settings are rare 
and have only been undertaken in countries with high 
consumption of SSBs (USA and Mexico).
 
► No evaluations of fiscal interventions have been undertaken 
in the UK where SSB consumption is lower or have been 
delivered at scale in commercial restaurant settings.
What this study adds
 
► At 12 weeks, sales per customer of SSBs had declined 
by 11% and at 6 months by 9.3% compared with the 
preintervention period. Reductions were the greatest in 
restaurants with higher SSBs sales per customer.
 
► The effects observed in this study were relatively large, 
which suggests that complementary activities associated 
with its introduction (eg, menu redesign, introduction of 
new beverages and information) may have the potential to 
augment changes induced by price increases.
