D
ry needling is a technique in which a fine needle 
is used to penetrate the skin, subcutaneous tis­
sues, and muscle, with the intent to mechanically 
disrupt tissue without the use of an anesthetic.42 
Dry needling is often used to treat myofascial trigger 
points (MTrPs), which 
are described as local-
ized 
hypersensitive 
spots in a palpable taut 
band of muscle. These 
hyperirritable spots can 
be classified as active MTrPs when they 
produce spontaneous pain and, when 
palpated, reproduce a patient’s familiar 
pain. Latent MTrPs do not produce spon-
taneous pain and are only painful upon 
palpation.1 Myofascial trigger points are 
commonly found in patients with muscu-
loskeletal pain.25
The 
physiological 
mechanism 
underpinning the effects of dry needling 
remains to be elucidated. However, it has 
been suggested that dry needling may 
produce both local and central nervous 
responses to restore homeostasis at the site 
of the MTrPs, resulting in a reduction of 
both peripheral and central sensitization 
to pain.13,17,18 Tsai et al41 demonstrated 
that needling of distal trigger points 
causes a reduced sensitivity of proximal 
trigger points. Centrally, dry needling may 
activate descending control mechanisms 
in the brain or spinal cord.18,19 Dry 
needling has been shown to immediately 
increase pressure pain threshold (PPT) 
and range of motion, decrease muscle 
tone, and decrease pain in patients with 
musculoskeletal conditions.17,24,28,32
T
TSTUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-
analysis.
T
TBACKGROUND: An increasing number of physi-
cal therapists in the United States and throughout 
the world are using dry needling to treat musculo-
skeletal pain.
T
TOBJECTIVE: To examine the short- and long-
term effectiveness of dry needling delivered by a 
physical therapist for any musculoskeletal pain 
condition.
T
TMETHODS: Electronic databases were 
searched. Eligible randomized controlled trials 
included those with human subjects who had 
musculoskeletal conditions that were treated with 
dry needling performed by a physical therapist, 
compared with a control or other intervention. The 
overall quality of the evidence was assessed using 
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation.
T
TRESULTS: The initial search returned 218 
articles. After screening, 13 were included. Phys-
iotherapy Evidence Database quality scale scores 
ranged from 4 to 9 (out of a maximum score of 
10), with a median score of 7. Eight meta-analyses 
were performed. In the immediate to 12-week 
follow-up period, studies provided evidence that 
dry needling may decrease pain and increase pres-
sure pain threshold when compared to control/
sham or other treatment. At 6 to 12 months, dry 
needling was favored for decreasing pain, but the 
treatment effect was not statistically significant. 
Dry needling, when compared to control/sham 
treatment, provides a statistically significant effect 
on functional outcomes, but not when compared 
to other treatments.
T
TCONCLUSION: Very low–quality to moderate-
quality evidence suggests that dry needling 
performed by physical therapists is more effective 
than no treatment, sham dry needling, and other 
treatments for reducing pain and improving pres-
sure pain threshold in patients presenting with 
musculoskeletal pain in the immediate to 12-week 
follow-up period. Low-quality evidence suggests 
superior outcomes with dry needling for functional 
outcomes when compared to no treatment or 
sham needling. However, no difference in functional 
outcomes exists when compared to other physical 
therapy treatments. Evidence of long-term benefit 
of dry needling is currently lacking.

Six4,5,11,20,23,30 of the 831,40 systematic 
reviews since 2013 concluded that dry 
needling is more effective in the short 
term for decreasing pain when compared 
to sham or placebo treatment. There is 
currently weak evidence (only 24,5 of the 
8 systematic reviews) for dry needling’s 
effect on functional outcomes or qual-
ity of life. The evidence to support dry 
needling in the long term for decreasing 
pain or improving functional outcomes 
is currently lacking, as no previous re-
views included evidence of long-term 
effects.
An increasing number of physical 
therapists in the United States and 
throughout the world are using dry 
needling 
to 
treat 
musculoskeletal 
pain.9,10 As dry needling becomes more 
commonly used by physical therapists, it 
is important to continually appraise the 
existing evidence to support or refute its 
effectiveness.
Previous reviews have commonly 
focused on a specific anatomical region 
rather than the entire body,20,23,30,31 and 
have not examined the effectiveness 
of dry needling applied by a single 
health professional. To improve its 
generalizability to physical therapy 
practice, the available evidence on 
dry needling, as applied by physical 
therapists, must be examined. Therefore, 
the purpose of this systematic review 
and meta-analysis was to determine the 
short-term and long-term effectiveness 
of dry needling delivered by a physical 
therapist for any musculoskeletal pain 
condition.
METHODS
T
his systematic review and meta-
analysis was performed following 
the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines.29
Search Strategy
Eligible studies in this systematic review 
included human subjects with mus-
culoskeletal conditions who had been 
treated by a physical therapist with dry 
needling, compared with a control, sham, 
or other intervention. Only randomized 
controlled trials were included. Studies 
were excluded if patients were less than 
18 years of age and if the full text was not 
published in English.
The electronic databases MEDLINE, 
AMED, CINAHL, and Embase were 
searched independently by the primary 
investigator in consultation with a bio-
medical librarian. The terms “dry nee-
dling” or “intramuscular stimulation,” 
paired with “random,” “group,” “trial,” 
“randomized controlled trial,” or “con-
trolled clinical trial,” were used to search 
the electronic databases. Results were 
limited to human studies. An example 
of the search strategy is included in the 
APPENDIX (available at www.jospt.org). 
Bibliographic reference lists from iden-
tified articles were hand searched for any 
other potential study not identified dur-
ing the database searches. Search results 
are displayed in FIGURE 1.
Study Selection
After the duplicate articles retrieved from 
the different databases were removed, 2 
independent reviewers (E.G. and Kelly 
Lavallee) screened titles and abstracts to 
determine which studies met the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria. Studies that 
appeared to meet the inclusion criteria 
or whose eligibility could not be deter-
mined from the title/abstract screening 
were retrieved for full-text review by 2 
independent reviewers (E.G. and Sebas-
tian Sabadis). Disagreements between 
reviewers were resolved by consulting 
a third reviewer (J.C.) who was blind to 
other reviewers’ decisions on whether

the study should be included. Once study 
selection was complete, primary authors 
of included studies were e-mailed and 
asked if they were aware of any other 
studies that would satisfy eligibility 
requirements.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Data extraction was performed by the 
primary investigator (E.G.), and the data 
were compiled into a standardized data-
extraction form. Data included sample 
size, diagnosis, inclusion/exclusion crite-
ria, duration of symptoms, type of nee-
dling intervention (location, technique, 
and duration), main outcomes, time to 
outcome, and harm reported.
Included studies were analyzed by 2 
independent reviewers (E.G. and Sebas-
tian Sabadis), using the PEDro (Physio-
therapy Evidence Database) quality scale. 
The PEDro scale is based on 11 criteria, of 
which 10 contribute to the score, repre-
senting methodological quality and risk 
of bias. The first item is not included in 
the score, as it relates to external validity 
of the study. The PEDro scale has been 
shown to have fair to good interrater re-
liability, with an intraclass correlation 
coefficient of 0.55 (95% confidence inter-
val [CI]: 0.41, 0.72)26 and higher scores

RevMan (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, 
Copenhagen, Denmark). For analysis of 
continuous data, standardized mean dif-
ferences (SMDs) with 95% CIs were used, 
as this method has been reported to be 
more generalizable39 and allows for assess-
ment of studies utilizing different scales to 
assess the same outcome. The random-ef-
fects model was used to account for vari-
ability between studies and its effect on 
the intervention. The I2 statistic was used 
to measure the heterogeneity between tri-
als.15 An I2 value of 25% represents a small, 
50% a moderate, and 75% a large degree 
of heterogeneity.16 Effect size was inter-
preted using Cohen’s criteria for pooled es-
timates.8 Cohen described 0.2 as small, 0.5 
as moderate, and 0.8 as large effect sizes.8
To assess for risk of publication bias, 
funnel plots were constructed.22 A sym-
metrical funnel plot indicates a lower risk 
of publication bias, whereas an asymmet-
rical funnel plot indicates a high risk of 
publication bias.
A 2-point change in pain on a visual 
analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 
was considered a clinically meaningful 
change in pain for between-group com-
parisons, as this criterion was also used in 
a previous systematic review of dry nee-
dling,20 enabling comparisons with the 
previous literature. As we were unable 
to find evidence describing the minimal 
clinically important difference for PPT, 
between-group comparisons were not 
performed for PPT.

tion (GRADE) approach,3 performed an 
analysis of the studies included in each 
meta-analysis independently. After ap-
praising the evidence, each meta-analysis 
was classified as 1 of the following levels 
of evidence to support its findings14:
•  
High-quality evidence: further re-
search is very unlikely to change our 
confidence in the estimate of effect
•  
Moderate-quality evidence: further 
research is likely to have an impor-
tant impact on our confidence in the 
estimate of effect and may change the 
estimate
•  
Low-quality evidence: further re-
search is very likely to have an im-
portant impact on our confidence in 
the estimate of effect and is likely to 
change the estimate
•  
Very low–quality evidence: any esti-
mate of effect is very uncertain
Randomized controlled trials began 
with a high-quality evidence classifica-
tion but were downgraded based on 5 
domains: (1) study design and risk of 
bias (downgraded if greater than 25% of 
the participants were from studies with 
a high risk of bias, which we defined as 
PEDro scale scores of less than 6); (2) 
inconsistency of results (downgraded 
if significant heterogeneity was present 
on visual inspection or the I2 value was 
greater than 50%); (3) indirectness (gen-
eralizability of the findings downgraded if 
greater than 50% of the participants were 
outside the target group); (4) imprecision 
(downgraded if fewer than 400 partici-
pants were included in the comparison 
for continuous data); and (5) other (pub-
lication bias).37 We reduced the quality of 
evidence by 1 level for each domain not 
met in the comparison to determine the

RESULTS
Study Selection
T
he database search returned a 
total of 218 articles after dupli-
cates were removed. Following title 
and abstract screening, 88 manuscripts 
were selected for full-text review. FIGURE 
1 illustrates the flow of papers through 
the review. After the full review pro-
cess, 12 studies were selected for inclu-
sion.2,7,12,24,27,28,32,33,35,36,38,43 After contact 
with primary authors of included studies, 
1 further study was identified for inclu-
sion,6 resulting in a total of 13 studies. 
The absolute degree of rater agreement 
for the first and second stages of the study 
selection was 86% and 93%, respectively. 
The chance-corrected degree of agree-
ment was good for screening by title 
and abstract (κ = 0.717; 95% CI: 0.629, 
0.806) and good for screening by full text 
(κ = 0.759; 95% CI: 0.575, 0.943). For the 
title and abstract screening, the third re-
viewer resolved 38 disagreements, most 
commonly over whether the study met 
the inclusion criteria for dry needling 
(31%). For the full-text screening, the 
third reviewer was needed to resolve 3 
disagreements, all regarding the type 
of health practitioner who provided the 
needling.
Study Characteristics
This systematic review focused on 
musculoskeletal pain and included 13 
studies: 6 on neck pain (5 on mechanical 
neck pain6,24,28,32,43 and 1 on chronic 
whiplash-associated disorder38), 1 on 
postoperative shoulder pain,2 1 on 
chronic lower back pain,33 1 on total 
knee arthroplasty,27 1 on chronic ankle 
instability,35 2 on myofascial pain,12,36 
and 1 on fibromyalgia.7 Inclusion and 
exclusion criteria varied greatly across 
the studies. The characteristics of the 13 
studies are included in TABLE 1.
The 13 trials in this systematic review 
included a total of 723 participants. The 
majority (85%) of the included studies 
examined the effects of dry needling in 
participants with chronic musculoskel-
etal conditions. Two trials (15%) exam-
ined dry needling either coinciding with

intervention.
Two of the studies utilized control 
groups that did not receive dry needling, 
3 used control groups that received sham 
dry needling, 6 compared dry needling 
to other treatments, and 2 used a variety 
of comparison groups (TABLE 1). All dry 
needling and comparison treatments 
were performed by physical therapists. 
Follow-up periods ranged widely from 
immediate to 12 months.
The risk of bias within studies was 
assessed with PEDro scale scores (TABLE 
2). The absolute percent of rater agree-
ment for PEDro scale scoring was 94%, 
and the chance-corrected degree of 
agreement was very good (κ = 0.863;

95% CI: 0.771, 0.955). The PEDro scale 
scores for included studies ranged from 
4 to 9 (out of a maximum score of 10), 
with a median score of 7 and an inter-
quartile range of 2 (6-8). None of the 
trials were able to blind the treating 
therapist, and only 3 (23%) of the tri-
als were able to blind subjects through 
the use of sham dry needling. Only 8 
(62%) studies included concealed al-
location. All studies specified eligibility 
criteria, randomized patients, provided 
results of between-group statistical 
comparisons for at least 1 key outcome, 
and provided both point measures and 
measures of variability for at least 1 key 
outcome. Most studies (n = 12, 92%) 
scored well on having similar groups 
at baseline. Nine (69%) of the studies 
collected measures of at least 1 key out-
come from more than 85% of the sub-
jects initially allocated to groups. The 
risk of bias across studies is displayed 
in FIGURE 2.

of findings and quality of evidence for all

Dry Needling Versus Control/Sham: 
Immediate to 12-Week Effects
Seven studies7,12,27,28,32,36,38 examined the 
immediate to 12-week effects of dry nee-
dling, and 67,12,27,28,32,38 were able to be 
grouped for meta-analyses to determine 
the effect on pain (FIGURE 3). There is 
low-quality evidence suggesting a mod-
erate effect8 (SMD, –0.7; 95% CI: –1.06, 
–0.34) favoring dry needling over con-
trol/sham. Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 
78%). All 7 studies favored dry needling 
over control/sham at all assessment 
points for reducing pain, except for Ster-

ling et al38 at 6 weeks. The 2 studies with 
the largest treatment effect were Pecos-
Martín et al32 at 1 and 4 weeks and Me-
juto-Vázquez et al28 at 1 week, with a raw 
treatment effect size of 2.7, 3.0, and 2.6 
on a VAS, respectively, which are con-
sidered clinically meaningful changes in 
pain. The raw treatment effect sizes for 
the remaining studies7,12,27,38 on pain (1.7, 
0.35, 0.85, 1.5, 0.58, 0, 1.2, 0.47, 0.3) are 
of questionable clinical meaningfulness 
(FIGURE 3).
Five studies7,12,28,32,38 examined the im-
mediate to 12-week effects of dry needling 
on PPT and were able to be meta-ana-
lyzed (FIGURE 4). There is very low–qual-
ity evidence suggesting a moderate effect 
(SMD, 0.8; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.27) favoring 
dry needling over control/sham. Hetero-
geneity was high (I2 = 87%). On 9 of 11 
occasions that PPT was assessed in the 
12 weeks after intervention, dry needling 
increased PPT to a greater degree than 
control/sham.
Five studies7,27,32,36,38 assessed func-
tional outcomes versus control/sham 
during the immediate to 12-week follow-
up (FIGURE 5). There is low-quality evi-
dence suggesting a small effect8 (SMD, 
–0.44; 95% CI: –0.85, –0.04) favoring 
dry needling over control/sham. Het-
erogeneity was high (I2 = 79%). Three 
out of the 5 studies (60%) found that 
dry needling improved functional out-
come scores more than control or sham 
treatment.
Dry Needling Versus Control/Sham:  
6- to 12-Month Effects
Two studies27,38 examined the long-term 
effect of dry needling and were meta-
analyzed to determine effect on pain 
(FIGURE 6). There is moderate-quality evi-
dence suggesting a small effect8 (SMD, 
–0.26; 95% CI: –0.58, 0.06) favoring dry 
needling over control/sham in the long 
term. The 95% CI crosses the line of no 
difference, and heterogeneity was low 
(I2 = 11%). Two time points analyzed by 
Sterling et al38 were in favor of dry nee-
dling, whereas that of Mayoral et al27 was 
in favor of control/sham. The raw VAS 
scores in the Sterling et al38 trial indicate 
a reduction in pain in favor of dry nee-
dling at 6 months of 1.2 points, and at 12

months of 0.5 points. The raw VAS score 
at 6 months in the Mayoral et al27 trial 
was 0.26 in favor of the control (FIGURE 6).
Two studies27,38 assessed long-term ef-
fectiveness of dry needling on functional 
outcomes versus control/sham (FIGURE 7). 
There is low-quality evidence suggest-
ing a small effect (SMD, –0.32; 95% CI: 
–0.62, –0.02) favoring dry needling over 
sham/control. Heterogeneity was low (I2 
= 0%).
Dry Needling Versus Other Treatment: 
Immediate to 12-Week Effects
Eight studies2,6,12,24,33,35,36,43 examined the 
immediate to 12-week effects of dry nee-
dling, and 6 were able to be included in 
meta-analyses to determine the effect on 
pain (FIGURE 8). There is moderate-quality 
evidence suggesting a small effect8 (SMD, 
–0.43; 95% CI: –0.77, –0.10) favoring dry 
needling over other treatment. Heteroge-
neity was moderate (I2 = 67%). On 9 of 12 
occasions when pain was assessed, results 
favored dry needling compared to other 
treatment (FIGURE 8). Only Salom-Moreno 
et al35 found a raw effect size on pain of 
greater than 2 points (2.1) at 12 weeks, in 
favor of dry needling. All other raw effect 
sizes on pain are of questionable clinical 
meaningfulness when compared to other 
treatments (FIGURE 8).
Four studies6,12,24,43 examined the 
immediate to 12-week effects of dry 
needling on PPT compared to other 
treatments and were meta-analyzed (FIG-
URE 9). There is very low–quality evidence 
suggesting a moderate effect (SMD, 0.61; 
95% CI: 0.08, 1.14) favoring dry needling 
over other treatment. Heterogeneity was 
high (I2 = 85%). On 7 of 10 occasions of 
measurement, PPT results were in fa-
vor of dry needling compared to other 
treatment.
Six studies2,6,24,35,36,43 assessed func-
tional outcomes versus other treatment 
over various periods ranging from 1 
week to 12 weeks (FIGURE 10). There is 
very low–quality evidence suggesting no 
treatment effect (SMD, –0.01; 95% CI: 
–0.49, 0.47) of dry needling over other 
treatments. Heterogeneity was moder-
ate (I2 = 70%). Only 135 of the 6 stud-
ies (17%) that compared dry needling 
to other treatment reported that dry 
needling led to greater improvement in 
functional outcome.

(FIGURE 11F) are symmetrical, suggesting 
a lower likelihood of publication bias. 
However, the asymmetrical funnel plots 
for PPT (FIGURES 11B and 11G), the effects 
of dry needling versus control/sham on 
functional outcomes for 6- to 12-month 
follow-up (FIGURE 11E), and the effects of 
dry needling versus other treatment on 
functional outcomes for immediate to 
12-week follow-up (FIGURE 11H) suggest a 
possible risk of publication bias.
DISCUSSION
T
he results of the current sys-
tematic review and meta-analyses 
suggest that there is very low–
quality to moderate-quality evidence 
that dry needling performed by physi-
cal therapists is more effective than a 
no-treatment control or sham dry nee-
dling for reducing pain (low-quality 
evidence; effect size [SMD], –0.7; 95%

(very low–quality evidence; effect size 
[SMD], 0.8; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.27) dur-
ing the immediate to 12-week follow-up 
period. During this same immediate to 
12-week follow-up period, there was also 
a small but significant effect for improv-
ing functional outcomes (low-quality 
evidence; effect size [SMD], –0.44; 95% 
CI: –0.85, –0.04); however, due to the 
varied outcome tools and musculoskel-
etal conditions examined, it is not clear 
whether this treatment effect was clini-
cally meaningful. At all follow-up occa-
sions during the immediate to 12-week 
period, dry needling showed moderate 
to large treatment effects on both pain 
and PPT. On average, within the immedi-
ate to 12-week period, the raw treatment 
effect on pain was 1.27 points better on 
the VAS in the dry needling group than 
in the control/sham group. Although 
this value does not exceed the clinically 
meaningful change in pain of 2.0,20 the 
overall raw effect on pain, combined with 
the moderate treatment effect observed 
in the meta-analyses, suggests that dry 
needling may be more effective when 
compared to a no-treatment control or 
sham needling based on low- to moder-
ate-quality evidence.34 At 6 to 12 months, 
dry needling appears to be favored when 
compared to the no-treatment control or 
sham needling, but the 95% CI crosses 
the line of no difference, suggesting that 
this difference between treatments is not 
significant. Yet, at 6 to 12 months, there

was a small but significant treatment ef-
fect in favor of dry needling compared to 
a no-treatment control or sham needling 
on functional outcomes. Only 2 stud-
ies27,38 with 6- to 12-month follow-up 
periods met our inclusion criteria. The 
lack of studies examining the long-term 
outcomes of dry needling performed by 
physical therapists on musculoskeletal 
pain warrants caution when interpreting 
these findings. Results of meta-analyses 
within this review support a statisti-
cally significant treatment effect of dry 
needling for improving pain, PPT, and 
functional outcomes when compared 
to no-treatment control or sham treat-
ment during the immediate to 12-week 
follow-up period. At the 6- to 12-month 
follow-up periods, the treatment effect is 
no longer statistically significant for pain 
and is small and of questionable meaning 
for functional outcomes.
When dry needling performed by 
physical therapists is compared to other 
treatments, primarily soft tissue manual 
therapy techniques, there is moderate-
quality evidence to suggest that it is more 
effective at reducing pain (effect size 
[SMD], –0.43; 95% CI: –0.77, –0.10) and 
very low–quality evidence to suggest that 
it increases PPT (effect size [SMD], 0.61; 
95% CI: 0.08, 1.14) during the immedi-
ate to 12-week period. The treatment ef-
fect is largest at 4 and 12 weeks in regard 
to pain and appears to have a moderate 
treatment effect on PPT when immedi-
ate to 12-week results are meta-analyzed. 
Although the raw effect sizes for pain and 
PPT compared to other treatments are of 
questionable clinical meaningfulness, the 
CI does not cross the no-difference line, 
suggesting a true treatment effect favor-
ing dry needling. Compared to other 
treatments, dry needling does not have a 
significant treatment effect on functional 
outcomes (very low–quality evidence; ef-
fect size [SMD], –0.01; 95% CI: –0.49, 
0.47). Yet, it does not appear that there 
is any significant effect in favor of other 
interventions that were utilized in the 
studies included in this review.
To our knowledge, this review is the 
first to investigate dry needling per-
formed by a single health profession 
(physical therapy). This improves the 
generalizability of our findings to physi-
cal therapists, and provides evidence that 
dry needling may be an effective treat-
ment technique when used by physical 
therapists trained in its use in an ap-
propriate patient for the management of 
musculoskeletal pain.
The findings of this review are 
in agreement with those of previous 
reviews,4,5,11,20,23,30 in that dry needling 
may be superior to no treatment or 
sham needling in reducing pain in the 
immediate to 12-week follow-up period. 
Results from this review differ from those 
of previous reviews20,23,40 showing an 
overall treatment effect of dry needling 
compared 
to 
standard 
care/other 
treatment; the present review found 
that dry needling performed by physical 
therapists provided a small treatment 
effect compared to other interventions 
performed by physical therapists for 
reducing pain and increasing PPT. It is 
possible that differences between dry 
needling and other physical therapy 
interventions were found in the current 
review because previous reviews4,5,20,23,31 
commonly have compared dry needling 
to other types of needling (eg, wet 
needling, which is not performed by 
physical therapists). In the current 
review, dry needling was compared to (1) 
exercise/soft tissue mobilization/joint 
mobilization for postsurgical shoulder 
pain,2 (2) proprioception/strengthening 
for 
ankle 
pain,35 
(3) 
ischemic 
compression techniques in 4 studies on 
neck pain,6,24,36,43 (4) orthopaedic manual 
therapy consisting of joint mobilization 
of the cervical and thoracic spine for 
neck pain,6 (5) active stretching for neck 
pain,12 and (6) percutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation for chronic lower back 
pain.33
Dry needling is a passive modality, 
and this review suggests that it may 
be most effective in reducing pain 
and increasing PPT and functional 
outcomes in the immediate to 12-week 
treatment period. When dry needling 
is utilized in appropriate patients, it 
may aid in decreasing musculoskeletal 
pain, allowing for additional, more 
active physical therapy interventions 
to maximize functional outcomes and 
reduce patient disability.
Limitations
This systematic review has some 
limitations. 
The 
included 
studies 
were limited to those investigating 
dry needling performed by physical 
therapists, which might have excluded 
articles reporting the effects of dry 
needling 
on 
musculoskeletal 
pain 
performed by other practitioners. This 
was intentional, as the study examined 
evidence specific to physical therapists 
performing dry needling. Another 
limitation is the high heterogeneity in 5 of 
the 8 meta-analyses performed. This may 
be explained by the inclusion of studies 
investigating any type of musculoskeletal 
pain, where participant samples differed, 
comparison groups varied, and follow-up 
times for outcomes were different. The 
heterogeneity was one of the reasons we 
elected to use the random-effects model, 
allowing for improved internal validity 
of the results. We included all types of 
musculoskeletal conditions because this 
is typical of physical therapy clinical 
practice, where therapists treat a variety 
of clinical conditions. Also, only studies 
published in English were included in 
this review.
Though we only included randomized 
controlled trials, the actual overall 
quality of the evidence was considered 
to be very low to moderate using the 
GRADE approach. This quality of 
evidence suggests that further research 
is likely to have an important effect and 
is likely to change the estimate; therefore, 
the findings should be interpreted 
accordingly. Also, our results are limited 
to the studies included in the review. The 
present findings cannot be generalized 
to different patient populations treated 
by different practitioners with varied 
training in dry needling.

CONCLUSION
B
ased on the GRADE approach,3 
very low– to moderate-quality evi-
dence from studies in a variety of 
musculoskeletal conditions strongly sug-
gests that dry needling performed by 
physical therapists is more effective than 
no treatment or sham dry needling for 
reducing pain, improving PPT, and im-
proving functional outcomes in the im-
mediate to 12-week follow-up period.
Although findings of this review 
provide 
very 
low– 
to 
moderate-
quality evidence for the effectiveness 
of dry needling for reducing pain and 
improving PPT when compared to other 
physical therapy interventions during 
the immediate to 12-week follow-up 
period, the small effect sizes and the 
varied study populations and comparison 
interventions utilized do not support a 
strong recommendation of dry needling 
over other physical therapy interventions. 
For functional outcomes, there was no 
effect of dry needling compared to other 
treatments. Further high-quality studies 
with long-term outcomes are needed to 
determine the long-term effectiveness 
of dry needling compared to other 
commonly utilized physical therapy 
interventions on musculoskeletal pain, 
as few of the included studies reported 
long-term outcomes.
KEY POINTS
FINDINGS: Very low– to moderate-quality 
evidence suggests that dry needling 
performed by physical therapists is 
more effective than no treatment, 
sham dry needling, or other treatments 
for reducing pain and improving 
PPT in patients presenting with 
musculoskeletal pain in the immediate 
to 12-week follow-up period. Very 
low– to low-quality evidence suggests 
superior outcomes with dry needling for 
functional outcomes when compared to 
no treatment or sham needling, but no 
difference in functional outcomes when 
compared to other physical therapy 
treatments. Evidence of the long-term 
benefit of dry needling is currently 
lacking.
IMPLICATIONS: Dry needling appears to be 
at least as effective as other treatments 
included in this review, and more 
effective than sham or no treatment 
for reducing pain and increasing PPT 
during the immediate to 12-week 
treatment period in patients with 
musculoskeletal pain.
CAUTION: The overall quality and 
limited number of studies reporting 
on dry needling performed by physical 
therapists at this time, combined with 
the high heterogeneity found in the 
results of the meta-analyses, indicate 
that readers should use caution when 
interpreting these results.

jospt perspectives for practice
Trigger Point Dry Needling
I
ncreasingly, physical therapists in the United States and 
throughout the world are using dry needling to treat 
musculoskeletal pain, even though this treatment has 
been a controversial addition to practice. To better gen-
eralize to physical therapy practice the findings about 
dry needling thus far, the authors of a study published in the 
March 2017 issue of JOSPT1 identified the need for a sys-
tematic review examining the effectiveness of dry needling 
performed by physical therapists on people with musculo-
skeletal pain. Their review offers a meta-analysis of data 
from several included studies and assesses the evidence for 
risks of bias.
WHAT WE KNEW
Previous reviews support the effectiveness of dry 
needling on reducing pain when compared to sham 
or placebo treatments, but are not specific to dry 
needling performed by physical therapists.
WHAT WE ASKED
“Is dry needling delivered by a physical therapist 
an effective treatment for reducing pain, improving 
pressure pain threshold, and improving functional 
outcomes for patients with musculoskeletal pain?”
WHAT WE FOUND
The authors scrutinized 13 randomized controlled 
studies that examined the effectiveness of dry 
needling on musculoskeletal pain. They found 
that, to date, most of the evidence is of very low to 
moderate quality. There are also risks of bias in the 
available research. Further, very little evidence exists 
regarding the longer-term benefits of dry needling, 
or that guides optimal treatment techniques and 
dosing.
WHAT WE KNOW NOW
At present, only a small number of trials have 
examined dry needling in physical therapy, and 
these are of very low to moderate quality. When 
considering data from physical therapist practice 
and compared with sham or no treatment, dry 
needling appears to be effective for reducing pain, 
increasing pressure pain threshold, and improving 
function during the immediate to 12-week treatment 
period in patients with musculoskeletal pain, but 
not during the longer term. Further, dry needling 
seems no more helpful than other treatments 
included in this review for improving function—
treatments such as exercise/soft tissue mobilization/
joint mobilization, proprioception/strengthening, 
ischemic compression techniques, orthopaedic 
manual therapy, active stretching, and percutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation. More rigorous 
research is needed to confirm the efficacy of dry 
needling overall, and to investigate its longer-term 
effectiveness.

EVIDENCE SHOWS SHORT-TERM EFFECTIVENESS. The available evidence suggests that dry needling helps 
reduce pain, increases pressure pain threshold, and improves function in the immediate to 12-week treatment 
period for patients with musculoskeletal pain.
BOTTOM LINE FOR PRACTICE
The results of this systematic review indicate that dry needling may be an effective 
intervention for appropriate patients with musculoskeletal pain. At the same time, 
the very low to moderate quality of the evidence limits the strength of conclusions 
that can be drawn, and optimal treatment techniques and dosing are not known. 
Dry needling appears to be more effective than sham, control, or other assessed 
treatments for improving pressure pain threshold, and more effective than sham 
or control for reducing pain in the short term. However, dry needling is neither 
more successful than other assessed treatments beyond 12 weeks nor more helpful 
for improving functional outcomes.
