 Temporal changes in myocardial infarction
incidence rates are associated with periods of
perceived psychosocial stress: A SWEDEHEART
national registry study

Background Psychosocial stress might trigger myocardial infarction (MI). Increased MI incidence coincides with
recurrent time periods during the year perceived as particularly stressful in the population.
Methods A stress-triggering hypothesis on the risk of MI onset was investigated with Swedish population data on MI
hospital admission date and symptom onset date (N = 156,690; 148,176) as registered from 2006 through 2013 in the
national quality registry database Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart
disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART). Poisson regression was applied to analyze daily
MI rates during days belonging to the Christmas and New Year holidays, turns of the month, Mondays, weekends, and
summer vacation in July compared with remaining control days.
Results Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for MI rates were higher during Christmas and New Year holidays
(IRR = 1.07 [1.04-1.09], P b .001) and on Mondays (IRR = 1.11 [1.09-1.13], P b .001) and lower in July (IRR = 0.92 [0.90-
0.94], P b .001) and over weekends (IRR = 0.88 [0.87-0.89], P b .001), yet not during the turns of the month (IRR = 1.01
[1.00–1.02], P = .891). These findings were also predominantly robust with symptom onset as alternative outcome, when
adjusting for both established and some suggested-but-untested confounders, and in 8 subgroups.
Conclusions Fluctuations in daily MI incidence rates are systematically related to time periods of presumed psychosocial
stress. Further research might clarify mechanisms that are amenable to clinical alteration. (Am Heart J 2017;191:12-20.)
Extraordinary stimuli that induce stress in individuals,
such as earthquakes or national sporting events, may
increase the risk of acute cardiovascular disease (CVD)
events such as acute myocardial infarction (MI).1,2 More
common psychosocial stressors of daily living are also
associated with increased MI risk in both men and
women of different age, ethnicity, and nationality.3
Furthermore, the widespread job-strain model predicts
that low control coupled with high demand at work
induces “mental strain”,4 a condition associated with
increased risk of MI.5,6
The incidence of MI varies over time. Previous studies
have reported regularities in the temporal fluctuations of
CVD incidence rates. The higher CVD-related death and
MI rate during the Christmas and New Year holidays is
well documented.7,8 Previous data also indicate a
beginning of month,9 week,10 and day11 increase in MI
incidence, which tends to coincide with particularly
stressful periods of modern life (eg, Christmas prepara-
tions, having bills to pay, returning to work after the
weekend, and traveling to work in the mornings).
Conversely, a nadir in incident MI has been identified
during weekends12 and during summer vacation in July13
when psychosocial stress is relatively low.
Our internal biological clock, the circadian system, is
partially out of synchrony with these periods, having
genetically evolved over millions of years to become adapted
to smooth changes in the diurnal light-dark cycle.14
Modern life is therefore likely to challenge this primordial
biological rhythm with its artificial light and often arbitrary
timing of behavioral requirements, be it shift-work, early
Monday mornings, or late night Christmas preparations.
Accordingly, previous research suggests that even slight
shifts of societal time-keeping precedes increased MI rates,

Clinical Investigation
 through daylight saving time when we “lose” 1 hour in the
spring but not when we “gain” 1 hour in the fall.15
Interestingly, a psycho-neuro-endocrinological study found
the morning cortisol peak to be larger for weekdays
compared with weekends and that the study cohort
accordingly rated themselves as being more stressed during
weekdays compared with weekends.16
We thus hypothesized that stress triggering of MI
insofar as time periods of particularly high and low stress
would align with periods of particularly high and low MI
rates in the unselected Swedish MI population, respec-
tively. Using previous research and sociocultural knowl-
edge, we defined periods of both high and low stress
whose MI rates can then be compared with MI rates on
remaining control days representing the time- period of
intermediate or “more average” stress. This contrasts
with previous studies that tend to only compare high
versus control periods.2,8 Accordingly, we presumed
particularly high stress and MI rates during (1) Mondays
when the workweek begins, (2) the turn of the month
due to possible financial or administrative deadline stress,
and (3) the often stressful turn of the year coinciding with
family gatherings during the winter holidays. Conversely,
we presumed particularly low stress and MI rates during
(4) weekends and (5) the Swedish 4- to 6-week paid
summer vacation. Because Swedes spend most of their
summer vacation in July, 17 a yearly trough in population
MI rates is predicted in July versus other months.
Similarly, the weekend is the least time-constrained
period of the week, and therefore, we presumed that
weekends would have the lowest MI rates during the
week. We also hypothesized that the Monday increase in
MI rates would be more pronounced in the working
compared with the retired patients.
Methods
Data
From 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013, 156,690
MIs were registered prospectively in the unselected
national quality database Register of Information and
Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive care Admis-
sions (RIKS-HIA), covering 90% of all MIs in Sweden for
individuals b80 years old and 70% for individuals ≥80
years old. RIKS-HIA was the first of the SWEDEHEART
registries to be established as a national quality registry in
1995 and enrolls consecutive patients from all coronary
care units (CCUs) in the country admitted for symptoms
suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Information is
collected prospectively on N100 variables including date
and
time
of
symptom
onset
and
admission.
SWEDEHEART/RIKS-HIA data are randomly audited and
monitored regularly by specialized monitors who visit
hospitals for source data verification of the health records
versus registry data for quality checks. Overall, the data
agreement rate is N95%. The registry is approved by an
ethics committee, the Swedish National Board of Health
and Welfare, and the Swedish Data Protection Authority.
Patients are informed of their inclusion and that they are
free to be excluded and have their data erased. No patient
requested exclusion between 2011 and 2013, and only a
handful did so before 2011.18 This opt-out procedure is a
rare strength of this registry because it effectively reduces
sampling bias. The present study was approved by the
regional ethics committee in Uppsala and complies with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The present manuscript
follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.19
Main outcome was the acute hospital admission date,
calculated from whichever time stamp for percutaneous
coronary intervention laboratory arrival or CCU arrival
(dependent on MI type) came first. Alternative outcome
was the registered symptom onset date. Inclusion
criterion was confirmed discharge diagnosis of MI
(International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision,
codes I21-I23),20 as decided by the local hospital
cardiologist based on symptoms, biomarkers, electrocar-
diogram, and additional information.
Temperature data (°C) were retrieved from the
Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute mea-
surement station closest to the local CCU that registered a
particular MI (median distance to CCU = 6.57 km). Air
pollution data (NO2, μg/m3) were gathered the Swedish
Environmental Protection Agency from the closest urban
background measurement station to the local CCU
(median distance to CCU = 1.91). Data on the monthly
number of individual passengers traveling in and out of
the country by air as registered by all airports in Sweden
were retrieved from the Swedish Transport Agency.
Classification of exposure and statistical analyses
Unless further specified, we present continuous
variables as mean ± SD and categorical variables as
count (%). Poisson regression was used to model daily
MI rates, defining a day from 00:00 to 23:59 hours.
Presumed stress increases (−I) were defined a priori and
categorically as days belonging to the Christmas and New
Year holidays (Holidays-I) = 15 December-6 January, the
turns of the month (Month-I) = 4 days before and 4 days
after the turn, and Mondays (Monday-I) = Mondays.
Presumed decreases in stress (−D) were defined, also a
priori, as days belonging to the summer vacation
(Summer-D) = 1 July-31 July and the weekends (Week-
end-D) = Saturdays and Sundays. The remaining days
were used as control days. The 3-week time span for the
Holidays-I is motivated by our aim to investigate possible
stress triggering of MI, partially different from previous
studies more specifically focused on studying the twin
peaks during this period. Naturally, there is some
arbitrariness in choosing these time spans, although
choosing periods of both particularly low and high stress
Wallert et al 13
American Heart Journal
Volume 191
 would automatically select control periods that should be
intermediate to high/low periods. Importantly, the chosen
periods are unambiguously defined for future replication.
Daily MI counts were high enough to avoid problems with
excess zeros and low counts per unit (median = 53,
interquartile range = 47-60). Overdispersion was present
(main analysis grand variance/mean = 1.19), and quasi-
Poisson regression was therefore applied. The exponents
of the estimated coefficients and their 95% CIs provided the
mean and uncertainty of the adjusted incidence rate ratios
(IRRs) relative to control days. These IRRs are interpretable
as factor changes in the outcome variable relative to control
days (eg, IRR = 1.20 [1.10-1.30] = between 10% and 30%
increase relative to control with 20% being the most
probable point estimate). We report IRRs and associated
statistics for the whole population main analysis and for
predefined subgroup analyses in Figure 2 and for additional
analyses in text. Statistical significance was set to 5%
(2-tailed). The Holm-Bonferroni method was applied to
correct the main analysis P values for multiple compari-
sons. Covariates were checked for log-linearity against the
outcome. Model appropriateness was confirmed in several
ways, for instance, with F tests and through inspecting the
standardized deviance residuals versus the log-predicted
values. Statistical power allowed for comprehensive
subgroup analyses. Subgroup z test comparisons assumed
approximate normality of parameter estimates and inde-
pendence of observations. Unadjusted daily MI rates are
also presented descriptively.
Covariates for the adjusted analyses were prepared and
used as follows: For temperature, a locally weighted daily
average was calculated. For a particular date, each MI was
registered at a specific hospital. Each MI in the data set
was then matched with the corresponding local daily
mean temperature. Temperature values were then
averaged for each date according to where in the country
the MIs of that date occurred. To control for possible
short-term delayed effects of temperature on MI rates,
delayed temperature averages for the 3 days preceding
the outcome were also included in all adjusted analyses.
In addition, NO2 data were available for a subgroup of
39,634 MIs for which data from some stations for some
hours were missing (~5% missing of total). Average daily
mean values from complete days were imputed if
missing. NO2 was then prepared as temperature for this
subgroup. To control for changes in the population base
due to traveling abroad, the total amount of abroad
traveling by air was available as monthly net numbers of
abroad travelers from all Swedish airports and modeled as
such with both no delay and 1-month delay. To
complement the whole population analysis, we repeated
the regression analyses in the 8 predefined subgroups:
male, female, working, pensioners (retired), first MI,
recurrent MI, ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and non-STEMI
(NSTEMI). We chose to stratify these analyses because
weighted averages of categorical variables would have
been artificial and less interpretable. Stratification on
work status also meant comparing relatively young and
old patients. When included, the locally weighted
covariates (eg, temperature) had to be recalculated for
each of the 8 subgroup analyses and for the alternative
outcome symptom onset because daily MI locations and
counts were different.

Results
After excluding 163 duplicates and 1 case with missing
hospital admission date, a total of 156,690 MIs were
analyzed. For reference, patient event characteristics are
presented in Table which shows high similarities across
compared periods.
The predefined time periods and unadjusted daily MI
rates aggregated over days of the week, days of the
month, and months of the year are available in Figure 1.
Regarding weekdays, most MIs were registered on
Mondays (60.6 ± 8.6) and least on Saturdays (47.5 ±
7.9). For monthly days, the 28th (55.8 ± 9.8) and the 18th
(52.0 ± 8.6) held the most and least MIs, respectively. For
months, December had the highest MIs per day (56.0 ±
10.6) and July the lowest (48.1 ± 8.1).
Next, the main analysis was performed. The adjusted
whole population result showed highly significant
increases in adjusted daily MI rates during the Holidays-I
and the Monday-I, and highly significant decreases during
the Summer-D and Weekend-D, compared with control
days. The only hypothesis that was not supported was
that adjusted daily MI rates during the Month-I did not
differ compared with control days. See Figure 2 for
explicit parameter values. Daily temperature was nega-
tively associated with MI rates (IRR = 0.98 [0.97-0.99] per
10°C increase, P b .001).
Secondary analyses considered possible confounding
variables. Repeating the regression procedure in the
subgroup for which both temperature and NO2 air pollution
were available (n = 39,634) showed that the previously
identified significant MI rate changes during the defined
periods remained in the predicted direction and were also
highly significant with the exception of the Holidays-I
which was rendered borderline significant (IRR = 1.04
14 Wallert et al

 [1.00-1.09], P = .049). NO2 was not associated with MI rates
(IRR = 1.00 [0.99-1.00] per 10 μg/m3 increase, P = .38) in
this model and is not reported further.
We also ran the regression analysis in 8 subgroups.
Figure 2 shows results by sex (male [n = 99,827], female
[n = 56,825]) and working status (working [n = 30,131],
pensioner [n = 111,931]). Adjusting for temperature and
age, men had a larger Monday-I compared with women.
Those working had a larger Monday-I but a smaller
Weekend-D compared with pensioners. Also, the pen-
sioners exclusively drove the Holidays-I relative to those
working. Workers and pensioners were therefore also
analyzed as 1 group controlling for age, which resulted in
a highly significant Holidays-I (IRR = 1.07 [1.05-1.10],
P b .001) but no significant influence of age on daily MI
rates (IRR = 1.00 [1.00-1.00] per year increase, P = .79).
Subgroup results for STEMI (n = 34,138), NSTEMI (n =
73,858), first MI (n = 106,724), and recurrent MI (n =
48,960) are also displayed in Figure 2. The Weekend-D
was smaller for STEMIs compared with NSTEMIs.
Comparisons of first MIs versus recurrent MIs showed a
smaller Holidays-I, a larger Monday-I, and a smaller
Weekend-D for first MIs. Regardless of infarct type, all
but the Month-I were in their respective hypothesized
directions and highly significant.
To investigate if our main results were related to a
systematic delay of seeking appropriate care, we ran the
regression procedure with symptom onset date as

 alternative outcome (n = 148,176; 95.6% of total). This
analysis rendered a diminished but still highly significant
Weekend-D (IRR = 0.96 [0.95-0.97], P b .001) and
Monday-I (IRR = 1.09 [1.07-1.11], P b .001) and a significant
Month-I relative to control days (IRR = 1.01 [1.00-1.03], P =
.041), whereas the rest of the main model did not change.
Additional control for traveling by air from all Swedish
airports only attenuated the Summer-D minimally (IRR
without traveling = 0.920 [0.900-0.941]; IRR with travel-
ing = 0.925 [0.903-0.946]), which remained highly sig-
nificant (P b .001); the other model coefficients did not
change, and traveling itself was nonsignificant in the
model (P = .82).
Discussion
The present study investigated the coincident temporal
variation in daily MI rates that can possibly be triggered
by psychosocial stress. Eight years of accumulated
national SWEDEHEART/RIKS-HIA registry data on MI
incidence in Sweden was used to test the predictions. In
correspondence with the idea of stress triggering of MI
and the bulk of previous research,7-12,26 our results
showed significantly higher daily MI rates during
Mondays and the Christmas and New Year holidays
versus rates during control days. Furthermore, there were
significantly lower daily MI rates during the weekends
and summer vacations in July compared with control
days. These findings remained largely robust after
adjusting for temperature and air pollution; abroad
traveling; when using symptom onset as alternative
outcome; and in male, female, working, pensioner,
STEMI, NSTEMI, first MI, and recurrent MI subgroups.
Sex differences in the incidence of acute cardiovascular
event rates have been reported, such as higher MI rates
among men than women during World Cup soccer,
suggesting that watching sports may engage more men or
that men might be more susceptible to MI triggering
during World Cup Soccer.2 The present study found that
men had a greater increase in MIs during Mondays than
women. Congruently, men in this age group spend more
time than women doing paid work in Sweden,27 implying
that men are more exposed to work stress.
Previous studies suggest that time-bound effects on MI
rates might be caused by delays in seeking appropriate
health care.7 The present study partially supports this.
The SWEDEHEART/RIKS-HIA registry contains almost
complete data on symptom onset date, collected by
nurses guided by explicit instructions to clarify and
confirm the time when MI symptoms started. This
allowed for repeating the regression analysis with
symptom onset date as alternative MI outcome, resulting
in attenuated Monday and weekend IRRs, yet still
significant and substantial relative to control days. This
might suggest that MI rate changes during these periods
are partly related to both particularly high and low stress
and delays in seeking appropriate care.
Routine traveling abroad in the Swedish population
peaks in the summer and could thus in theory explain
part of the present lower MI rates during the month of
July. However, controlling for the monthly net amount of

 traveling abroad by air from all Swedish airports did not
change our modeling results. The highest monthly net
deficit of Swedish citizens due to traveling constitutes
~1%-2% of the total Swedish population, which in itself
makes abroad traveling highly unlikely as explanatory for
the 8% whole population MI rate decrease in July
observed in the present study.
Three interesting deviations from the predictions were
evident. First, the MI increase during Christmas and New
Year holidays was driven by the pensioners. This is in part
at odds with previous research indicating a general
winter increase in MI for both workers and pensioners,
and over age strata, although smaller in younger
strata.11,12 From a stress perspective, one interpretation
of the present finding might be that those working are
considerably younger and healthier, and perhaps stress
during the holidays has an exclusive triggering effect on
the more fragile pensioners. The higher MI rates during
the holidays among the older NSTEMI/recurrent MI
versus the younger STEMI/first MI patients lend some
support to this suggestion. However, age was nonsignif-
icant in the combined subgroup analysis of workers and
pensioners, which is inconsistent with this interpreta-
tion. Those still working might also experience both
increased winter holiday stress and decreased stress from
temporary work leave, which cancel each other out. In
contrast, pensioners might—relative to their normally
quite calm lifestyle in Sweden—be exposed to particular
winter holiday stress which could hypothetically gener-
ate their MI rate increase. Data are not available to test
this possibility. Holiday changes in alcohol, food, and
tobacco consumption—known MI triggers—might also
be related to the exclusive increase in MI rates among
pensioners.28 This is however contradicted by the
present finding of particularly low MI rates in both
workers and pensioners during both weekend and
summer days—the time periods when weekly and yearly
alcohol consumption peaks in Sweden. 29,30 Second, with
additional adjustment for NO2, the winter holidays
increase diminished to borderline significance. Air
pollution is more extensive and variable from day-to-day
in the large cities and predominantly lower in other parts
of Sweden, and it is seems reasonable that air pollution
would exert a particularly strong influence on MI
triggering in these densely populated areas and addition-
ally more so for the more fragile pensioners. The winter
holiday period typically includes 2 peak days (spikes)
within a 2-week period starting with the celebration of
Christmas and including New Year's Eve, and the 3-week
time span in the present study may have diluted the
holidays increase. The twin spikes were also present in
these data. However, separating them from the longer
3-week period under study would imply that these spikes
would be independent of stress, which is highly unlikely.
The winter holiday increase in both mortality and MI has
been extensively studied,7,8,11,12,31,32 for which psycho-
social stress is probably a partial explanatory factor.
Third, the predicted turn of the month increase was
consistently nonsignificant. This finding deviates from a
previous study suggesting increased MI rates during the
first week of the month9 but corroborates a later study.7
The selected period in the present study was also
somewhat different. We do not attach particular weight
to the very small and marginally significant increase in MI
rate during the turn of the month when symptom onset
was used as regression outcome. Overall, our study
suggests that the turn of the month is unlikely to be
particularly related to stress-triggered MI. As we should
reason about our findings, peak monthly stress might
instead be related to salary and pension payment,
suggesting a different time span of dates surrounding
the 17th and the 25th of each month when payments are
most common in Sweden. Considerable variation in
payment timing precludes testing this possibility.
Regarding confounding by environmental factors, previ-
ous research has shown a generally positive association
between increased MI risk and exposure to common air
pollutants (eg, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, PM10, SO2),33 of
which NO2 seems especially important for MI triggering,34
but results have been conflicting.35 The present study used
high-quality data on temperature that allowed control for
0- to 3-day lagged temperature in all adjusted analyses.
The present findings align well with a previous study
that identified a small but robust increase in MI incidence
rates during the first week following the artificial daylight
saving shift during spring when we “lose” 1 hour but not
during fall when we “gain” 1 hour.15 The spring loss
entails only 1 hour of artificial manipulation of time,
suggesting considerable somatic sensitivity in MI patients
to artificial time manipulations. In our study, the adjusted
20% increase in MI rates during Mondays for the relatively
young, working subgroup is substantial and warrants
further research, as do several of the other estimates. In
general, the present study lends additional support to
stress triggering of MI and suggests that it is probably
beneficial to minimize manipulations of our innate
biological rhythms, also keeping in mind that a substantial
portion of time constraints imposed on us by culture is
necessary and harmonizes well with our biological
predisposition. The suggested cascade of sociocultural
norms instigating the human stress response that in turn
triggers MI appears reasonable.
Main limitations/strengths
The observational study precludes definite causal
conclusions, mainly because of possible unmeasured
confounding. The observed temporal variation in MI rates
might not be causally related to psychosocial stress.
However, the present control for both previously
established and suggested-but-untested confounders
with novel high-quality data suggests that psychosocial
stress is a quite plausible contributing cause of these MI

 rate changes. Another limitation is that patients from a
single country were included and general conclusions for
other countries cannot be drawn. Also, perceived stress
was not directly measured in the population, as this was
practically unfeasible. A smaller population-representative
study with direct measurement of stress variables may
therefore prove valuable. On the other hand, self-reported
stress may not be more valid because subjective measures
are notoriously unreliable, and effective stress levels may
be subliminal or obscured by emotional and cognitive
states, such as anticipations of holiday pleasures. Stress is
arguably an extremely difficult concept, being partly a
multifaceted biopsychosocial phenomenon and partly a
psychological construct. It is nevertheless of profound
real-life relevance. Studying stress therefore means making
do with proxies of stress. If necessary data are made
available, ethnic and/or religious minorities in Sweden
could fruitfully be studied to confirm the stress-MI
relationship, as they celebrate holidays at different times
than do the secular Christian majority population. Because
stress is also socially “contagious”, stress levels in the
cultural majority would probably also influence stress
levels in cultural minorities. Another limitation was the
lower inclusion of patients that are ≥80 years old, many of
whom suffer an MI in dementia care. Regarding psycho-
social stress, these patients' group context is quite
different, their cognitive functioning is severely deteriorat-
ed, and clinical interventions are limited. The lower
coverage of the very old might also have attenuated the
Holiday-I because it is evidently driven by pensioners in
Sweden. Furthermore, the analysis including NO2 used a
subgroup of urban and suburban dwellers for which NO2
data were available. This selection may have biased the
result beyond controlling for the influence of NO2 on MI
rates. The present findings should also be tested with
non-Western population data for which high or low stress
periods might differ. Climate-different Western countries in
the Southern Hemisphere (eg, Australia, New Zealand) are
particularly interesting, and research might then be
focused on the alternative outcome of MI symptom onset
date because both hospital admission and death likely have
comparatively more systematic error from registration
delay. The main strengths of the present study include the
use of both the more trigger-relevant, alternative outcome
symptom start date and the hospital admission date; the
control for both established and some previously
suggested-but-untested confounders; and that it reflects
incidence rates of MI during different time periods in both
the whole population and 8 subgroups based on a large,
almost complete, nationwide registry with high measure-
ment accuracy and statistical power.
Conclusion
Incidence rates of MI were higher on Mondays and over
the Christmas and New Year holidays and lower in
weekends and during the vacation month of July. The
observed variability of incident MI at different time
periods during the year may be systematically related to
psychosocial stress levels. Further research should seek
to delineate possible pathways and might clarify mech-
anisms that are amenable to clinical intervention.
