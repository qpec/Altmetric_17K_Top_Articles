Abstract
Background: Setting personal targets is an important behavioural compo-
nent in weight management programmes. Normal practice is to encourage
‘realistic’ weight loss, although the underlying evidence base for this is lim-
ited and controversial. The present study investigates the effect of number
and size of weight-loss targets on long-term weight loss in a large commu-
nity sample of adults.
Methods: Weight change, attendance and target weight data for all new UK
members, joining from January to March 2012, were extracted from a com-
mercial slimming organisation’s electronic database.
Results: Of
the
35 380
members
who
had
weight
data
available
at
12 months after joining, 69.1% (n = 24 447) had a starting body mass
index (BMI) ≥30 kg m–2. Their mean (SD) weight loss was 12.9% (7.8%)
and, for both sexes, weight loss at 12 months was greater for those who set
targets (P < 0.001). Those that set ≥4 targets achieved the greatest loss
(P < 0.001). The odds ratio for weight loss ≥10% at 12 months was 10.3
(95% confidence interval = 9.7–11.1, P < 0.001) where targets had been set
compared to none. At the highest quintile of target size, the size of the first
target explained 47.2% (P < 0.001) of the variance in weight loss achieved
at 12 months. The mean (SD) BMI reduction in those with a target >25%
was 7.6 (4.0) kg m–2. A higher percentage of obese members did not set tar-
gets (P < 0.001) compared to those with a BMI <30 kg m–2.
Conclusions: Much of the variance in weight loss achieved in this popula-
tion was explained by the number of targets set and the size of the first tar-
get. Although obese people were less likely to set targets, doing so increased
the likelihood of achieving clinically significant weight loss and, for some
‘unrealistic’ targets, improved the results.
Introduction
Behaviour change strategies are perceived as important
components of the underlying treatment for obesity,
namely lifestyle modification through diet and exercise (1).
The setting of targets and goals is considered to be an
important behavioural change technique
(2). Both the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (3) and the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(4)
recommend that an intervention should encourage indi-
viduals to set a weight-loss target of 5–10% of initial body
weight. This has been associated with clinically significant
health benefits (5,6) and is described as ‘realistic’ (4). More
recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) guidance suggests that a 3% weight loss is desir-
able and should be the aim for a 12-week intervention (1).
However, health improvement is only one reason for
people wanting to lose weight and maintain weight loss.

 Physical appearance, social factors such as social pressure
and events, improving self-esteem, energy levels and work
performance can also motivate individuals to lose weight
and maintain a healthier weight (7,8).
Weight-loss targets, goals and expectations are all
described as motivators for weight loss (4), although the
terms are often confused and used interchangeably, both
in practice and in the literature. A weight-loss target or
goal may be defined as the total amount of weight an
individual would like to lose (9), whereas expectations are
more realistic than targets and should ideally be fluid and
change as weight loss occurs (10). Clients will inevitably
come into a weight-loss programme with an idea of the
amount of weight that they are aiming to lose. These
weight-loss targets are important because they regulate
behaviour by affecting attention, decisions, effort and task
persistence (11). They energise and direct behaviour (12),
and create the framework through which the behaviour is
perceived and evaluated (13).
Evidence suggests that effective diet and exercise modi-
fication interventions over a 12–24 week period can result
in a weight loss of 5–10% of initial body weight (14) and
yet this is unsatisfactory to many obese individuals (15).
Weight-loss targets are often much higher than recom-
mended and influenced by many individual factors,
including baseline body mass index (BMI) (16) and sex (17).
Weight-loss targets and expectations are also influenced
by the environment, with higher targets in clinical com-
pared to community settings (18).
Targets set by clients are often much higher than
what is actually achieved16, which has led to high targets
being considered ‘unrealistic’
(4) and a cause for con-
cern. The ‘false hope’ syndrome/hypothesis (19) suggests
that very ambitious targets relating to weight loss are
less likely to be met, and that the subsequent failure will
to
lead
to
disappointment,
dissatisfaction,
decreased
effort and relapse. However, evidence demonstrates that
non-attainment of goals does not necessarily stop success-
ful weight losers from maintaining their weight loss (9,20).
With many individuals being more satisfied by smaller
weight losses than they expected, it is suggested that
weight-loss goals become less important in the long-
term
(14,21) and maintenance may become easier
(22).
A recent meta-analysis concluded that there was no
empirical evidence to suggest that setting realistic goals
led to greater weight loss, or that unrealistic goals had
any negative impact on weight loss (6). Others have gone
further and suggested that higher targets may be motiva-
tional to some participants who wish to avoid the
feeling of disappointment
(9). A review looking at the
effect of expectations on weight-loss outcomes concluded
that higher targets may lead to higher weight loss at
6–12 months (14).
Indeed, Locke & Latham (11) suggest that goals act in
an energising capacity and setting higher targets results in
greater effort being made, resulting in a better perfor-
mance than a lower set target. In addition, goals have an
impact on the level of persistence, again with harder tar-
gets leading to prolonged effort. Setting realistic targets is
claimed to be one of the seven myths about current obe-
sity treatment with insufficient evidence to support the
practice (23).
Thus, there is much debate as to the effect that weight-
loss targets have on long-term weight loss. In the present
study, their effect within a large community-based, com-
mercial weight management group that positively encour-
ages target weight setting was considered to provide
further fuel for the debate. The aim was to consider
whether self-imposed target setting predicts weight loss at
12 months
in
group
members
with
an
initial
BMI ≥30 kg m–2. Three aspects of targets were investi-
gated
as
predictors:
(i)
whether
target
setting
was
reported by the group member or not; (ii) the number of
targets set over the 12-month data collection period; and
(iii) the size of the first target set. It was hypothesised
that setting weight-loss targets leads to a greater amount
of weight loss in the long-term (12-month period) and
significantly more members reaching ≥10% weight loss.
For those who do set targets, it was also hypothesised that
larger targets and setting a greater number would lead to
greater weight loss over 12 months.

(2014) guidance for programme content and constant
efforts are made to evaluate and thus improve the sup-
port offered to members. SW weekly groups are held
throughout the UK and members are further supported
by a magazine and website. At SW, weight-loss targets
are referred to as personal achievement targets. Mem-
bers are strongly encouraged to set their own weight-
loss target, although it is not compulsory and the
health benefits of losing 10% initial weight are empha-
sised. The trained group facilitator may offer advice if
requested and will ensure that the target does not lead
to a weight below the healthy range. Those who choose
to do so have the freedom to set interim and final
weight targets, which can be fluid, to suit their own
requirements.
Data on new members aged ≥18 years and not preg-
nant, who joined between January 2012 and March 2012
inclusive, were extracted from the SW electronic database.
Data were collected for all members up to either their
leaving the group or, for members still attending, up to

 September 2013. Data available in the SW database were
electronically collected from registration forms and group
meetings. Members were weighed at the group in light
clothing without shoes using calibrated scales (Seca Ltd,
Birmingham, UK) to the nearest 200 g. Personal informa-
tion on each new member included date of recruitment,
date of birth, region, sex, self-reported height, number of
attendances, initial weight and weight at 12 months. In
addition, any reported interim/final weight-loss targets
and the date of target achievement were also recorded.
Names and membership numbers were removed from the
database to ensure the anonymity of participants. Ethical
approval for the secondary data analysis was approved
through the School of Sociology and Social Policy,
University of Nottingham.
Data screening
Any non-UK members within the database were removed,
as were any members who only attended the initial group
meeting or for whom data on any variable were missing
(Fig. 1). Age at baseline was calculated for each member
based upon their date of birth and the date of recruit-
ment. Initial BMI and BMI at 12 months, respectively,
was calculated by dividing initial weight and weight at
12 months (converted to kg) by the square value of self-
reported height (m). Initial BMI was categorised into
normal
weight
(20–24.9 kg m–2),
overweight
(25–
29.9 kg m–2), obese (30–39.9 kg m–2) and morbidly obese
(>40 kg m–2). Weight change at 12 months is reported as
a percentage of the start weight. The targets achieved are

Number and size of target increase weight loss
 reported as a percentage of the starting weight. Weeks to
achieve the first target were calculated from the difference
between date of achievement and date of recruitment.
Participants were categorised as ‘target set’ and ‘non-tar-
get set’ members based upon whether they had target
weights reported. Outliers were screened out using stan-
dard SW parameter checks: members were excluded if
any of the following applied <18 and >80 years, height
<1.35 and >2.1 m, start weight <36 and >273 kg or start
BMI <20 and >90 kg m–2. Finally, data were screened for
any abnormal weight changes >70 kg or > 50% weight
loss or >10% weight gain. The original dataset of 376 186
members extracted generated a useable dataset of 308 890
individuals (Fig. 1). An analytical group was then created
comprising members from this dataset with 12-month
weight
data
available
and
who
had
an
initial
BMI ≥30 kg m–2. This resulted in an analytical sample of
24 447
individuals
(Fig. 1)
used
to
test
the
study
hypotheses.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was carried out in SPSS, version 22.0
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All continuous variables
were tested for normality as determined by the level of
skew and kurtosis. Unless stated otherwise, continuous
data are Gaussian and are described using the mean (SD)
and bivariate analyses were conducted using independent
samples
t-tests
and
Pearson’s
correlation
coefficient.
Binominal data were described using frequencies and
bivariate analyses were conducted using a chi-squared
test. Data are reported as the mean (SD).
To test the hypothesis that setting weight-loss targets
leads to a greater amount of weight loss in the long-term
(12-month period), ‘target set’ members and ‘non-target
set’ members in the analytical group were analysed using
one-way analysis of variance (with post-hoc Bonferroni
correction). To test the hypothesis that the size of the
first target leads to a greater amount of weight loss in the
long-term (12-month period), the population was divided
into quintiles based upon the size of the first target. To
investigate the relative importance of the size of the first
target and the number of targets as predictors of percent-
age weight change at 12 months, stepwise linear regres-
sion analysis was performed using adjusted r2 values and
standardised coefficients (b values) to determine the level
of significance. Collinearity statistics were used to deter-
mine the level of tolerance. Finally, to determine the pre-
dictors of a ≥10% weight loss at 12 months, odds ratios
(OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were determined in the analytical sample as a whole, and
within each quintile of the size of the first target.
Results
Characteristics of ‘target set’ and ‘non-target set’
members in the total data set
The mean (SD) initial BMI for the total data set (n = 308
890) was 33.1 (6.39) kg m–2 and the mean (SD) age at
joining was 43.1 (13.6) years. Some 46.6% (n = 143 940)
were ‘target set’ members and 53.4% (n = 164 950) were
‘non-target set’ members. The majority of members in
the total data set were female: 95.2% in the ‘target set’
group and 95.9% in the ‘non-target set’ group. Members
in the ‘target set’ group were significantly older than
those in the ‘non-target set’ [mean (SD) age at joining of
43.4 (13.7) years
versus
42.8 (13.5) years,
P < 0.05].
Members in the ‘target set’ group had a significantly
lower
initial
BMI
[mean
(SD)
32.1 (6.0)
versus
33.8 (6.6) kg m–2, P < 0.05] compared to members in
the ‘non-target set’ group. A significantly higher percent-
age of members with normal weight and overweight ini-
tial BMI were in the ‘target set’ group (54.9% versus
45.1% in the non-target set group, P < 0.001), whereas a
lower percentage of members with an obese or morbidly
obese initial BMI (n = 197 271) were in the ‘target set’
group (58.1% versus 41.9%, P < 0.001). Members in the
‘target set’ group were significantly more likely to attend
SW for a longer period [mean (SD) 21.0 (21.4) versus
12.7 (14.4) weeks, P < 0.05]. 11.5% (n = 35 380) of the
total sample had weight data available at 12 months after
joining. Significantly more ‘target-set’ members had a
12-month weight recorded than ‘non-target set’ members
(18.5% versus 5.4%, P < 0.05).
Analytical group
Of the 35 380 members who had weight data available at
12 months after joining, 69.1% (n = 24 447) were obese
on joining SW. For this analytical group, the mean initial
BMI was 37.1 (5.9) kg m–2 and age at joining was
47.6 (13.7) years. Mean (SD) weight loss at 12 months
was 12.9% (7.8%). 68.2% (n = 16 663) were ‘target set’
members and 31.8% (n = 7784) were ‘non-target set’
members (Table 1). Initial BMI, weight loss and BMI at
12 months were influenced by significant interactions of
sex and target setting (P < 0.001). Both males and
females in the ‘target set’ group had lower initial BMI
compared to those in the ‘non-target set’ group, and men
had significantly higher initial BMI in both the ‘target set’
and ‘non-target set’ group (P < 0.001). For both sexes,
those in the ‘target set’ group were significantly older
than those in the ‘non-target set’ group (P < 0.01). There
was no significant difference in percentage weight loss at
12 months between men and women in either the ‘target

 set’ or ‘non-target set’ group. However, for both sexes,
the percentage weight loss at 12 months was significantly
greater for members in the ‘target set’ compared to the
‘non-target set’ group (P < 0.001). For both sexes, mem-
bers in the ‘target set’ group attended more sessions than
those who did not (P < 0.001) (n = 62.8% of ‘target set’
members set 1 target; n = 23.7% set 2 targets; n = 8.7%
set 3 targets; and n = 4.8% set 4 or more targets over the
12-month study period). Those members that set more
than four targets over the year achieved significantly
greater weight loss (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2).
For the 16 663 ‘target set’ members in the analytical
group, the mean (SD) size of the first target was
19.4 (9.0)% weight loss (Table 2). To extend the analysis,
the population was divided into quintiles on the basis of
the size of first target (Q1: <10.41%; Q2: 10.42–16.35%;
Q3: 16.36–20.86%; Q4: 20.87–26.48%; and Q5: >26.48%
of weight loss). Members setting the highest first targets
were significantly younger than those setting lower first
weight-loss targets. Members setting the highest first tar-
gets had significantly higher initial BMI [Q5 mean (SD)
39.4 (5.5) kg m–2] than those setting targets in any other
quintile [Q1: 36.9 (6.0); Q2: 34.9 (4.9); Q3: 34.8 (4.7);
and Q4: 35.7 (4.8) kg m–2, respectively, P < 0.001]. The
mean weight loss at 12 months for all those setting tar-
gets was 14.3 (7.9) %. Members setting the highest first
target achieved a significantly greater percentage weight
loss at 12 months compared to members in other quin-
tiles [13.9 (6.1), 16.1 (7.0) and 19.0% for all of the mean
values and sds could we please have mean(sd) and then

presented (9.4) for the third, fourth and fifth quintiles,
respectively, compared to 11.4 (7.6) and 11.1 (6.0) for
the first and second quintiles, P < 0.001]. A mean (SD)

of
36.3 (5.5)
to

was
achieved
by

compared
to
38.8 (6.4) to 34.7 (5.6) kg m–2 in the group with no tar-
gets reported, a difference of 1.1 kg m–2 (P < 0.001). The
higher weight losses achieved at 12 months in those set-
ting higher first weight-loss targets was reflected in
greater BMI changes achieved (Table 2). Members setting
higher first targets took significantly longer to achieve
their target weight (Table 2). There was no significant
difference in terms of the total number of attendances
between the quintiles.
To identify predictors of percentage weight loss at
12 months, stepwise linear regression was used. Prior to
analysis, the data set was screened for missing values and
examined for fit between the variables and the assump-
tions of multivariate analysis. The dependent and inde-
pendent

 associated with the dependent variable, although only the
size of the first target demonstrated an effect that
accounted for more than 30% of the variance (r = 0.66).
Initial BMI, sex and age accounted for minimal variance
(Table S5).
The stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that
65.9% of the variance in weight loss at 12 months was
explained by variation in the size of the first weight-loss
target (44.1%), the number of targets set (12.5%), weeks
to achieve first target (4.2%) and the total number of
attendances (3.3%). Initial BMI, sex and age predicted
significant but small percentages of variance (Table 3).
Greater weight loss at 12 months was therefore predicted
by a greater first target weight loss, more targets being set
and greater attendance. Additional stepwise linear regres-
sion analyses were conducted on members categorised by
the size of the first target, divided into quintiles. Across
each of the four lower quintiles, the number of targets set
predicted the greatest amount of variance in percenatge
weight loss at 12 months (Q1: 15.9%; Q2: 26.4%; Q3:
24.0%; and Q4: 18.8%, respectively, P < 0.001). Only at
the highest quintile of first target was the size of the first
target a significant predictive variable, predicting 47.2%
of the variance, with the number of targets set predicting
3.5%. The odds of achieving ≥10% weight loss at
12 months were greater for the ‘target set’ group com-
pared to the ‘non-target set’ group and were progressively
greater with an increasing size of initial weight-loss target
compared to a non-target set member (Table 4).
Discussion
The maintenance of extensive records by a major com-
mercial slimming organisation presents an opportunity to
conduct an analysis of a large community sample. Our
analysis of a predominantly female population shows that
if people with a BMI ≥30 kg m–2 maintained attendance
of a weight management group, then they were likely to
achieve a clinically significant weight loss (≥10% weight
loss) at 12 months irrespective of whether they set targets
or
not.
This
indicates
that
maintaining
engagement
through attendance is very important within this type of
weight-loss setting. The mean weight loss achieved in the
present study is very similar to that reported by Lavin
et al. (24), where 45 395 ‘high-engagers’ from a separate
SW data set achieved a mean 13.2 (7.4)% weight loss at
12 months and thus this should be considered as a nor-
mal weight-loss outcome in slimmers accessing and
engaging with community support programmes. In a ran-
domised controlled trial where 377 adults were referred
to community Weight Watchers groups, 33% achieved a
weight loss greater than 10% at 12 months (25). The real-
ity is that, particularly for the morbidly obese patient,
they will need to achieve a weight loss greater than 5–
10% to maximise the clinical benefits gained from weight
loss.
Although obese and younger people were less likely to
set weight-loss targets, those that did were significantly
more likely to achieve a greater weight loss at 12 months
than those who did not. Among the obese population in

Number and size of target increase weight loss
 this sample, those who set targets were 10 times more
likely to be at least 10% lighter at 12 months. Setting a
higher first weight-loss target, in the range of 20–30% of
initial weight, was associated with further improvement
in weight-loss outcomes, although the actual weight loss
was nearer 20% at 12 months, equating to a BMI mean
reduction of 7.6 kg m–2 in those with a target >25%. The
combination of the number of targets set and the size of
the first target predicted much of the variance seen in
weight-loss outcomes at 12 months irrespective of age,
sex, number of attendances and starting BMI, although
relationships between all of the variables are seen to some
extent. It was observed that, when initial BMI was
≥30 kg m–2, those setting high first weight-loss targets
(>26.5%) were younger and heavier at the time of joining
the weight management group. This group were 4.5 times
more likely to lose ≥10% of their starting weight than
those not setting a target. The data suggests that obese
people could either set a greater number of smaller
weight-loss targets or choose a higher first weight-loss
target achieved over a longer time, aiming to achieve a
clinically beneficial weight loss and healthier BMI at
12 months. Although the findings of this analysis support
the benefits of setting targets as part of a behavioural
strategy to improve weight-loss outcomes, the reported
data challenge the belief that these targets should be real-
istic as defined by a 5–10% weight loss. Four-fifths of
those who set a target were aiming for a greater weight
loss than this and were still engaged with the weight-loss
programme at 12 months, with clinically beneficial weight
losses.
The present study, with a larger study population, sup-
ports and builds on the findings of De Vet et al. (18),
where, in a nonclinical sample, new year’s weight-loss tar-
gets of 13.6% were reported, with approximately two-
thirds of the 447 participants setting targets that exceeded
10%. It was suggested that not providing any moderating
guidelines on setting weight-loss targets may yield positive
attainment outcomes and that the amount of weight loss
individuals strive for may lead to more effort. Casazza
et al. (23) cited setting realistic targets to be one of the
seven myths about current obesity treatment with insuffi-
cient evidence to support the practice. The present study
further fuels this claim and suggests that national guid-
ance on weight management needs to be reviewed with
the emphasis on setting realistic targets being removed.
For a number of people, setting ambitious weight-loss
targets will be motivating and meaningful. Houser-Marko
& Sheldon(26)cite higher-level targets as being more self-
relevant and holistic, providing a sense of direction and
purpose.
The present study adds to current knowledge by exam-
ining the association between the number of targets set
and the size of the first weight-loss target and weight
loss-outcomes at 12 months for both men and women.
Undeniably, the group of participants setting the highest
weight-loss targets (Q5) achieved the greatest weight loss
at 12 months, although the data also suggest that, for
both sexes, there will be some individuals who may bene-
fit from setting a greater number of smaller weight-loss
targets and the balance between the two approaches may
need to be fluid according to personal circumstances (27).
Crawford & Glover(14), in their review, highlighted the
lack of published evidence examining the fluidity of target
setting in relation to weight-loss outcomes, with data par-
ticularly lacking for men.
One of the definitions for weight-loss maintenance
described by Elfhag & Rossner(28) is ‘achieving an inten-
tional weight loss of at least 10% and maintaining this
body weight for at least one year’. In their review, they
identified successful weight maintenance being associated
with, along with other factors, more initial weight loss,
reaching a self-determined target weight and social sup-
port. One of the benefits of enrolling with a commercial
slimming organisation is the social support offered to all
members and this may facilitate the higher individual tar-
get weights to be set, leading to improved weight loss at
12 months (29).
The major strength of the present study is that it pre-
sents data from a large community sample of both men
and women, albeit with a small percentage of men that is
representative of enrolment and attendance at commercial
slimming organisations
(24,25). However, the study size
was sufficiently large to detect any outcome differences
between the sexes. A limitation is that the data set was
unfortunately incomplete, with 12-month weight being
not recorded for a significant number of people in the
original sample. This most likely arose because members
may have had successful or unsuccessful weight-loss jour-
neys and were longer attending the slimming group at
12 months. It is also possible that some people may have
left and re-joined after a more than 4-week break and this
is not captured in the data analysis.
With the finding that 12-month weight change is influ-
enced by target setting, it would be of future interest to
perform analyses that consider weight change over longer
periods (24 or 36 months) aiming to determine whether
the successful weight losses are maintained. The time-
frame for data collection precludes such analysis at pre-
sent. Other, smaller hospital-based studies suggest that
achieving weight-loss targets is associated with the main-
tenance of weight loss over a 24-month period (29). The
present study did not consider the relationship between
weight-loss expectations and target setting and no data
were collected to establish whether the people in the sam-
ple were satisified with the weight losses that they

 achieved, or whether they hoped to achieve their targets
in a shorter time period. It would be of benefit to know
why the study population did or did not set targets, as
well as what influenced this decision, because such infor-
mation could be used to refine current guidance or pro-
grammes that assist in weight loss. In particular, it would
be beneficial to know more about what influenced some
people to set very high targets (>20% weight loss), which
appeared to be a successful strategy for achieving greater
weight loss over 12 months. Further studies are required
to answer some of these unknowns.
To date, no study based in a community setting has
investigated weight-loss targets on this scale and detail,
with both the size of the target and the number of targets
being reported. Obese people are less likely to self-impose
targets but, if they do, the more targets they set, they
more likely they are to achieve a greater weight loss at
12 months. Setting an ambitious first weight-loss target is
going to further improve weight-loss outcomes. This con-
tradicts current national guidance and it is proposed that
the current approach to set ‘realistic’ weight-loss targets is
indeed a myth and should be questioned and reviewed.
The combination of the size of the first target and the
number of targets set predicts much of the variance seen
in weight-loss outcomes at 12 months, irrespective of
baseline BMI, sex and age.
