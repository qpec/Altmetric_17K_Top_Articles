Increased tissue stiffness is a driver of breast cancer progression. The transcriptional reg-
ulator YAP is considered a universal mechanotransducer, based largely on 2D culture studies.
However, the role of YAP during in vivo breast cancer remains unclear. Here, we find that
mechanotransduction occurs independently of YAP in breast cancer patient samples and
mechanically tunable 3D cultures. Mechanistically, the lack of YAP activity in 3D culture and
in vivo is associated with the absence of stress fibers and an order of magnitude decrease in
nuclear cross-sectional area relative to 2D culture. This work highlights the context-
dependent role of YAP in mechanotransduction, and establishes that YAP does not mediate
mechanotransduction in breast cancer.

nhanced mammographic density, associated with a tenfold
increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, is one of
the strongest risk factors for breast cancer progression
(Fig. 1a)1–6. Previous studies show that increased ECM stiffness
promotes a proliferative and invasive phenotype in mammary
epithelial cells7–10. During breast cancer progression, cancer cells
invade through the basement membrane (BM) allowing meta-
static dissemination to begin11, resulting in decreased patient
survival. Thus, there is a critical need to understand how
enhanced ECM stiffness drives invasion.
Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional regulator that is
deregulated in diverse cancers, has been implicated as a universal
mechanotransducer12. Mammary epithelial cells (MECs) cultured
on increasingly stiff 2D polyacrylamide (PAM) gel substrates
show YAP accumulation in the nucleus, activating expression of
YAP target genes (Fig. 1b, c)13. On stiff 2D substrates, stress fibers
mediate flattening of the nucleus, which results in stretching of
nuclear pores and YAP accumulation in the nucleus14–16. How-
ever, cell morphology and signaling are significantly altered by
culture dimensionality17–20, and 3D culture has been reported to
be crucially important when modeling breast cancer19. In fact,
several recent studies implicate YAP as a tumor suppressor
during in vivo breast cancer21–23. As such, the role of YAP in
mechanotransduction during breast cancer is unclear.
Here, we examine the role of YAP in mechanotransduction
using breast cancer patient samples and mechanically tunable 3D
culture models of the mammary epithelium. Strikingly, we find a
lack of YAP activity with increased 3D culture and in vivo stiff-
ness, in contrast with 2D PAM controls. Mechanistically, this
discrepancy is related to the absence of stress fibers and a sig-
nificant decrease in nuclear cross-sectional size between cells
under 3D and 2D conditions. Together, these studies reveal that
breast cancer progression is regulated by a YAP-independent
mode of mechanotransduction.
Results
YAP-independent mechanotransduction in patient samples. To
determine if YAP is responsible for mechanotransduction during
breast cancer invasion we examined DCIS patient samples, a
carcinoma state marked by increased ECM stiffness preceding
BM invasion. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains of patient
samples show that YAP does not localize to the nucleus in DCIS
samples (Fig. 1d, e). In addition, 3SEQ analyses of patient samples
for canonical YAP target genes (Fig. 1f) and additional YAP
targets (Fig. 1g) show a lack of YAP activation. Further, analyses
of publicly accessible gene expression datasets similarly showed
no increase in YAP target gene expression with breast cancer
(Supplementary Fig. 1a–e). However, expression of a subset of
YAP target genes was increased in IDC samples (Supplementary
Fig. 1f), which occurs post-BM invasion, suggesting that YAP
activation may be relevant to post-invasion stages of breast can-
cer. Together, these analyses of three independent sets of patient
data establish that YAP is not activated during early stages of
breast cancer, when increased stiffness is reported to drive
invasion.
YAP-independent mechanotransduction in 3D culture. We
next examined whether YAP is responsive to increased ECM
stiffness using a mechanically tunable 3D culture model of the
mammary epithelium. Traditional mechanically tunable 3D cul-
ture models commonly incorporate col-1, which is highly relevant
to post-invasion IDC20. However, col-1 is not present in the BM
and
can
activate
tumorigenic
signaling
independently
of
stiffness24,25. Therefore, to mimic increased stiffness in a BM
microenvironment without confounding col-1 signaling, we
generated interpenetrating networks (IPNs) of reconstituted BM
(rBM) with alginate10. Addition of Ca2+ cross-links the alginate
network, increasing matrix stiffness without altering protein
concentration, matrix architecture, or pore size10. Elastic moduli
of hydrogels ranged from ~0.04 kPa for soft to ~2 kPa for stiff
gels, covering the range of stiffness observed during breast cancer
progression (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2). We also gener-
ated traditionally used rBM and col-1 gels as controls (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). All hydrogels were used to encapsulate MCF10A
cells, a nontransformed MEC line, in 3D culture acinar formation
assays (Supplementary Fig. 2). Surprisingly, cells embedded in
stiff IPNs or stiff col-1 gels, conditions that robustly promoted
proliferation, invasion, and other markers of malignancy (i.e., β1
integrin and p-FAK) showed cytoplasmic YAP (Fig. 2a, b and
Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Localization of YAP paralog TAZ
mirrored YAP under all hydrogel conditions (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Importantly, positive-control experiments treating cells in
3D culture with nuclear export inhibitor Leptomycin B (LepB)
showed strong YAP nuclear localization, similar to that of
cells seeded on stiff 2D col-coated PAM gels, demonstrating that
3D cultured MCF10A cells are competent for YAP activation
(Fig. 2c, d).
We explored the possibility that YAP activation requires a
higher range of stiffness. Although 1–2 kPa stiff hydrogels are
sufficient to induce proliferation and invasion (Supplementary
Fig. 3) and are physiologically relevant for malignant mammary
tissue4,5, we generated 20 kPa hydrogels, an order of magnitude
stiffer than malignant mammary tissue. 20 kPa gels similarly
failed to induce nuclear localization of YAP in MCF10A cells
under 3D culture conditions, in contrast to identical hydrogels
and cells cultured under 2D conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c).
In addition, increasingly malignant MEC lines, MCF10AT, and
MCF10CA1a26, and preformed acinar structures transplanted
into stiff hydrogels also did not display increased YAP nuclear
localization (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e).
In addition to examining YAP localization, we assessed YAP
activity through analysis of YAP phosphorylation and gene
expression. Western blot (WB) analysis of cells harvested from
soft
and
stiff
IPNs
showed
similar
levels
of

S127
phosphorylation, a mark of cytoplasmic retention and thus
inactivity (Fig. 2e; and Supplementary Fig. 7). RNA-seq was next
performed to assay expression of YAP transcriptional targets,
using the YAP target gene list used to identify YAP as a
mechanotransducer in 2D culture (Supplementary Table 1)13.
In agreement with IF results, expression of YAP target genes did
not trend with increased stiffness (Fig. 2f; and Supplementary
Table 1) or col-1 density (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Notably,
expression of canonical YAP target genes ANKRD1, CTGF,
CYR61, and ITGB2 were not differentially regulated by enhanced
stiffness (Fig. 2g) or col-1 density (Supplementary Fig. 8b). This is
in contrast to the robust YAP activation and target gene
expression demonstrated by the same MEC line in 2D culture
(Supplementary Fig. 9)27.
Inducible CRISPR/Cas9 YAP knockout. Given the surprising
lack of YAP activation by increased 3D culture stiffness, we
generated
doxycycline
(dox)-inducible
CRISPR/Cas9
YAP
knockout (ΔYAP) MCF10A cells to test the dispensability of YAP
in mechanotransduction. As absence of YAP may impact cell
growth in 2D culture prior to encapsulation, cells stably expres-
sing dox-inducible Cas9 and sgRNA targeting YAP (MCF10A::
Cas9/sgYAP) were first encapsulated in 3D culture without Cas9
induction. Following encapsulation, cells were treated with dox to
induce Cas9 expression and sgRNA-directed editing. Dox treated
MCF10A::Cas9/sgYAP cells showed depletion of YAP protein

 compared to untreated and MCF10A::Cas9/sgGAL4 controls
(Fig. 2h; and Supplementary Fig. 7). As Cas9 induction results in
a mixed population of KO cells, only cells verified for ΔYAP by IF
were assayed for mechanotransduction (Fig. 2i). Interestingly,
ΔYAP cells did not reduce stiffness-induced invasion (Fig. 2j) or
proliferation (Fig. 2k) compared to ΔGAL4 controls. As YAP did
not regulate mechanotransduction during breast cancer pro-
gression, we explored other transcriptional regulators whose tar-
get genes were identified by RNA-seq to be modulated by stiffness
(Supplementary Figure 10–12). Bioinformatics, small molecule

experiments strongly implicate STAT3 and p300 as mechan-
otransducers during breast cancer (Supplementary Figs. 10 and
11). Taken together, our analyses of YAP and TAZ nuclear
localization, YAP phosphorylation state, expression of YAP target
genes, and inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cells conclusively
show that YAP does not mediate mechanotransduction in 3D
culture.

 Relevance of 3D culture model to breast cancer. To assess the
relevance of this 3D culture model to DCIS, we compared our
RNA-seq data of cells encapsulated in soft or stiff IPNs (Fig. 2f) to
3SEQ data from normal and DCIS patient samples28 (Fig. 2f, g).
Importantly, a set of genes was identified that showed similar
regulation in stiff IPNs as DCIS samples (Fig. 2l; and Supple-
mentary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, RNA-
seq of cells isolated from stiff col-1 containing gels show a distinct
gene expression profile compared to BM stiffness, and captures
key aspects of the gene-expression profile in IDC patient samples
(Supplementary Fig. 12). Plotting fold change in vitro (i.e., stiff
IPNs) against fold change in vivo (i.e., DCIS patient samples)
revealed the most highly upregulated target from stiff IPNs,
S100A7, as the most relevant stiffness-regulated gene in DCIS
(Fig. 2l). S100A7 has been implicated in DCIS with roles in
proliferation and apoptosis-resistance, and tumor-associated
immune cell recruitment29–31. RNA-seq results were confirmed
by WB analysis of S100A7 in cells harvested from soft and stiff
IPNs (Fig. 2m; and Supplementary Fig. 7), IHC of S100A7 in
breast cancer patient tissues (Fig. 2n), and qPCR of cells harvested
from soft and stiff IPNs (Supplementary Fig. 13). Together, these
results demonstrate that 3D culture of MECs in stiff IPNs is
highly relevant to modeling DCIS, and provides a gene signature
of stiffness-induced carcinoma progression.
Cells in 3D culture and in vivo show decreased nuclear size. To
elucidate the mechanism underlying the confounding result that
YAP is responsible for mechanotransduction in 2D, but not 3D
culture nor primary tissue, we examined nuclear morphologies.
This analysis was motivated by the recent finding that stiffness-
induced YAP activation requires nuclear flattening and opening
of nuclear pores15,16. Analysis of nuclear morphologies showed
drastic differences in DCIS primary tissues and cells in 3D culture
compared to 2D culture (Fig. 3a). Strikingly, nuclear area in cells
from 2D culture show a tenfold increase in cross-sectional area
compared to 3D culture and patient samples (Fig. 3b, Supple-
mentary Fig. 6b). These changes in nuclear morphology also
occur when cells are cultured on top of (2D) rather than
encapsulated
in
(3D)
the
identical
substrate:
20 kPa
alginate–RGD hydrogels (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c).
A threefold increase in nuclear perimeter was also observed
(Fig. 3c), in addition to a significant increase in solidity, a
measure of the smooth nature of the perimeter (Supplementary
Fig. 14a). During progression from normal to DCIS to IDC,
patient samples showed interesting, but comparatively small,
differences in nuclear morphology (Supplementary Fig. 14b–e).
Notably, YAP nuclear intensity scales with nuclear area, with
nuclei from patient samples and 3D culture deviating from the
size range observed for positive nuclear YAP intensity (Fig. 3d).
Similarly, nuclear YAP intensity scales with nuclear perimeter
(Fig. 3e). Positive nuclear YAP intensity also correlated with high
solidity, which is almost exclusively observed in nuclei from 2D
culture (Supplementary Fig. 14f). However, some nuclei from soft
2D PAM reach the required size ranges but fail to show positive
nuclear YAP intensity, suggesting that nuclear morphology is not
the only factor required for YAP activation.
MECs fail to form perinuclear stress fibers in 3D culture. As
nuclear morphologies and YAP activation in 2D culture has been
linked to stress fiber contractility, we investigated the role of stress
fibers in 3D culture. Recent studies showed mechanical coupling
of stiff ECM to the nucleus through stress fibers, with fiber
contractility causing nuclear flattening and subsequent nuclear
pore stretching15,16. Further, the enrichment of perinuclear stress
fibers was required for YAP nuclear translocation in 2D culture16.
To examine if stress fibers contribute to the observed changes in
nuclear morphology, we assayed stress fibers in cells cultured in
2D and 3D. The presence of robust perinuclear stress fibers was
observed in cells cultured on stiff PAM gels, in which nuclear
localization of YAP was observed, but not soft PAM gels nor stiff
or soft IPNs, in which nuclear localization of YAP was not
observed (Fig. 3f, g). This is in agreement with previous reports
that cells cultured in 3D substrates fail to form robust stress
fibers32,33, and instead adopt a predominantly cortical F-actin
architecture (Fig. 3g). This suggests a model where the presence
of perinuclear stress fibers, coupled with distinct nuclear
morphologies, is the basis of differences between YAP 2D and 3D
activation (Fig. 3h).
In this study, we examined the role of YAP in mediating
mechanotransduction during ductal carcinoma progression using
patient samples and 3D culture models. Cancer has historically
been thought of as a genetic disease, with tumors arising from
genetic mutations in DNA. However, it has been increasingly
recognized that the microenvironment plays a key role in
regulating cancer progression. Our study provides compelling
evidence that 2D YAP mechanotransduction studies do not
recapitulate the conditions seen in clinical samples, and suggests a
critical need for the use of 3D culture models in studying breast
cancer. Finally, our findings reveal new therapeutic targets,
including STAT3 and p300, for preventing breast cancer invasion.
Methods
Cell culture and cell lines. MCF10A cells obtained from the ATCC (cat. #CRL-
10317; ATCC) were cultured in DMEM/F12 50/50 medium (cat. #11330057;
Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% horse serum (cat. #16050122;
Thermo Fisher Scientific), 20 ng/ml EGF (cat. #AF-100-15; Peprotech, Inc.), 0.5 µg/

 Cas9 cells were maintained in MCF10A growth medium as above, supplemented
with 5 µg/ml blasticidin (cat. #R21001; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following a
second round of infection with indicated sgRNAs (see Cloning and lentiviral
generation below)., MCF10A::Cas9/sgRNA cell lines were maintained in medium
supplemented with 5 µg/ml blasticidin and 1 µg/ml puromycin (cat. #A1113803;
Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Reagents. EdU incorporation assay (cat. #C10337; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was
performed according to manufacturer’s instructions with a 24 h incubation of 10
µM EdU.
For inhibitor studies, MCF10A cells encapsulated in hydrogels were incubated
in Genentech p300 inhibitor GNE-049 at a final concentration of 0.5 µM
(Genentech, Inc.; MTA OR# 216339) or STAT3 peptide inhibitor PY*LKTK at a
final concentration of 500 µM (cat. #ab142104; Abcam). p300 inhibitor C646
(cat. #SML0002; Sigma) was also used at the indicated concentrations.
CRISPR/Cas9 MCF10A cell lines were generated by first producing a
doxycycline-inducible Cas9/blast MCF10A cell line. Cas9/blast transfer vector
(cat. #CAS11229; Dharmacon) containing virus was produced and used to infect
WT MCF10A cells. Stably expressing cells were selected using 5 µg/ml blast.
MCF10A::Cas9/blast cells were infected with lentivirus harboring sgRNA against
GAL4/mCherry/puro, YAP/mCherry/puro, or STAT3/mCherry/puro. Doubly
stably expressing cells were selected using 5 µg/ml blast with 1 µg/ml puro.
CRISPR/Cas9 editing was induced by adding 2 µg/ml dox (cat. #AAJ6042206;
Alfa Aesar) and knockout verified by WB and IF.
Cloning and lentiviral generation. All plasmids in this study have been banked in
Addgene using the following ID numbers:
pLenti-GAL4 (121514), pLenti-sgYAP-2 (121423), pLenti-sgYAP-10 (121424),
pLenti-sgSTAT3-1 (121425), pLenti-EGFP (121426), and pLenti-STAT3-linker-
EGFP (121427).
sgRNAs were expressed using a lentiviral mouse U6 (mU6) promoter-driven
expression vector that coexpessed Puro-T2A-mCherry from a CMV promoter.
sgRNA sequences were generated by PCR and introduced by InFusion cloning into
the sgRNA expression vector digested with BstXI and XhoI. sgSTAT3-1 sequence:
GTCAGGATAGAGATAGACCAG. For YAP, 2 sgRNA sequences were used and
pooled during lentiviral production. sgYAP-2 sequence: GAGATGACTTCCTGA
ACAGTG; sgYAP-10 sequence: GTGCTGTCCCAGATGAACGTC.
To assemble pLenti-STAT3-linker-EGFP for overexpression, STAT3 was
amplified from pLEGFP-WT-STAT3, with the forward primer containing the
linker sequence, and inserted using Infusion Cloning into MluI and EcoRI digested
pLenti-Origene-Nrf21. To assemble pLenti-EGFP control, EGFP was amplified
from pLenti-Origene-Nrf21 and inserted into XhoI and EcoRI digested pLenti-
Origene-Nrf21.
For lentiviral generation, HEK293T cells were seeded at 1 × 107 cells/10 cm dish.
The next day 70–90% confluent cells were transfected. For each dish, 9 μg of
lentiviral transfer vector, 8 μg of packaging vector pCMV-dR8.91, and 1 ug of
packaging vector pMD2-G were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection
Reagent (cat. #L3000008; ThermoFisherScientific) Opti-MEM Reduced Serum
Medium (cat. #31985062; Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Medium was replaced with complete medium 4 h following transfection. Forty-
eight hour following transfection, lentivirus-containing supernatant was harvested
and filtered through a 0.22 μm Steriflip (Millipore). Filtered supernatant was
concentrated using Lentivirus Precipitation Solution (cat. #VC100; AlStem)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following concentration, lentiviral
pellets were resuspended in 1/100 of original volume using cold DMEM/F12 and
stored at −80 °C. For MCF10A transduction, concentrated lentivirus was added to
complete medium containing 8 µg/ml polybrene (cat. #SC134220; Santa Cruz
Biotech) at a volume of 1:100.
Hydrogel formation. Matrigel (cat. #354230; Corning) was purchased for use as
rBM matrix and used at a final concentration of 4.4 mg/ml for all experiments.
Collagen-1, derived from rat tail, (cat. #354236; Corning) was lyophilized and
reconstituted in 20 mM acetic acid. Immediately before cell encapsulation, recon-
stituted col was supplemented with 10× PBS, neutralized with 0.1 M NaOH, and
pH adjusted with 0.1 N HCl. rBM and col were mixed with cells and DMEM/F12 to
the reach the indicated final concentrations. MCF10A cells were trypsinized,
strained through a 40 µm cell strainer to enrich for single cells, counted on a Vi-
CELL (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences), and seeded at a final concentration of

 1 × 105 cells/ml hydrogel. Hydrogel-cell mixtures were quickly deposited into wells
of a 24-well plate precoated with 50 µl gelled rBM. Hydrogels containing cells were
placed in a 37 °C incubator with CO2 to gel for 30 min before a transwell insert
(Millipore) was placed on top to prevent floating and 1.5 ml complete medium
added.
IPNs were formed as previously described10. LF20/40 alginate (FMC
Biopolymer) was solubilized, dialyzed, charcoal filtered, sterile filtered, lyophilized,
and reconstituted to 2.5% w/v in DMEM/F12. Alginate was mixed with rBM, cells,
and DMEM/F12 and loaded into a 1 ml Luer lock syringe (Cole-Parmer), on ice.
For crosslinking, a second 1 ml syringe was loaded with 125 mM CaSO4 or DMEM/
F12, on ice. Syringes were connected with a female–female Luer lock coupler
(ValuePlastics), rapidly mixed with four to six pumps of the syringes handles back
and forth, and quickly deposited into precoated wells, as above. IPNs containing
cells were allowed to gel before adding transwell filters and medium, as above.
For 20 kPa alginate–RGD hydrogels, alginate–RGD hydrogels were prepared as
described previously34. LF20/40 alginate (FMC Biopolymer) was dialyzed, filtered
and lyophilized, and then was coupled to RGD oligopeptide GGGGRGDSP
(Peptide 2.0) using carbodiimide chemistry35. The final density of RGD in the
alginate hydrogel was matched as 150 mM RGD in a 2% wt/vol alginate gel. The
modified alginate was dialyzed, charcoal filtered, sterile filtered and lyophilized
again. Alginate–RGD was reconstituted to 2.5% w/v in DMEM/F12 and mixed with
MCF10A cells. The cell–alginate solution was then mixed with DMEM/F12
containing 24.4 mM CaSO4, and then deposited between two glass plates spaced
2 mm apart. The cell–alginate mixture was allowed to gel for 45 min, and then disks
of hydrogel were punched out and immersed in complete growth medium.
For 2D PAM gels, the surface of coverslips was functionalized accoring to a
previous method36. Coverslips were cleaned with ethanol, immersed in 0.5% (3-
aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (in dH2O) at room temperature for 30 min and
washed with dH2O. Coverslips were then immersed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in
dH2O at room temperature for 30 min and dried. A prepolymer solution was
prepared containing acrylamide, N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide, 1/100 volume of
10% ammonium persulfate, and 1/1000 volume of N,N,N′,N′-
tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). The final concentration of acrylamide and
bis-acrylamide was varied to control substrate stiffness37. For 0.1 kPa hydrogels,
3%/0.02% were used. For 1 kPa hydrogels, 3%/0.1% were used. For 2 kPa hydrogels,
4%/0.1% were used. Prepolymer solutions were deposited on a Sigmacote-treated
hydrophobic glass plate, and functionalized coverslips placed on top of the
prepolymer solution. Polyacrylamide solutions were allowed to polymerize for 30
min between the hydrophobic glass plate and the functionalized coverslip. When
polymerization was completed, PAM gels were carefully separated from the glass
plate.
To enable cell adhesion to the PAM gel, col-1 and rBM were conjugated to
the gel surface using sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(4′-azido-2′-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate
(sulfo-SANPAH) as a protein-substrate linker. PAM gels were incubated in
1 mg/ml sulfo-SANPAH in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5, activated with UV light
(wavelength 365 nm, intensity 4 mW/cm2) for 20 min, washed in HEPES, and then
incubated in 100 µg/ml col-1 and rBM in HEPES overnight at room temperature.
The protein cross-linked PAM gels were washed with PBS before use.
Mechanical testing. Stiffness measurements of 3D culture rBM, col, and IPN
hydrogels were performed using an AR-G2 stress-controlled rheometer with 25-
mm top- and bottom-plate stainless steel geometries (TA Instruments). Hydrogel
solutions without cells were mixed and immediately deposited onto the bottom
plate of the rheometer and the top plate lowered such that the gel formed a uniform
disk between the two plates. Exposed hydrogel surfaces were coated with mineral
oil (Sigma) and covered with a hydration chamber to prevent sample dehydration.
The storage modulus was monitored at 37 °C with 1% strain at a frequency of 1 Hz
and measurements taken once the storage modulus reached an equilibrium value.
The storage and loss moduli were then used to calculate the Young’s modulus (E).
Young’s moduli (i.e., elastic moduli) were calculated using the equation E = 2 G* ×
(1 + v), where v is Poisson’s ratio, assumed to be 0.5, and G* is the bulk modulus
calculated using the equation G* = (G’2 + G”2)1/2 where G’2 is the storage and G”2
is the loss modulus.
To measure substrate stiffness of 2D PAM gels, unconfined compression tests
were performed using an Instron MicroTester 5848. PAM gels were compressed at
a rate of 1 mm/min. The tangent elastic modulus of the measured stress-strain
curves was calculated between 5 and 15% strain4,7. Stiffness of 3D culture alginate
hydrogels was measured using unconfined compression tests according to a
previously published method34. Alginate disks (15 mm in diameter, 2 mm thick)
were submerged in DMEM for 1 day to fully equilibrate. The gel disks were
compressed to 15% at a rate of 1 mm min−1 and the slope of the stress–strain curve
from 5% to 10% strain was used to obtain the stiffness of alginate hydrogel.

MCF10A cells encapsulated for 7 days were harvested from IPNs by incubation in
cold PBS containing 50 mM EDTA (Sigma) for 5 min while pipetting to break up
gels. Cells were centrifuged at 500g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and
the cells with remaining matrix material were treated with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco)
for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 500g. Cell pellets were washed with 20%
serum-containing resuspension buffer to neutralize trypsin and washed twice with
PBS. For sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell
lysates, MCF10A cells were lysed in Pierce RIPA buffer (cat. #89900; Thermo
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets (cat.
#11836170001; Roche) and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets (cat.
#04906845001; Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein con-
centration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (cat. #23227;
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Laemmli sample buffer (cat. #1610747; Bio-Rad) was
added to lysates and samples boiled for 10 min before loading 25 µg protein in each
lane of a 4–15%, 15-well, gradient gel (cat. # 4561086; Bio-Rad). Proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose at 100 V for 105 min, blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T
(137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 19 mM Tris base, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.4), incubated in
primary antibody overnight, IRDye 680- or 800-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Li-COR Biotechnology) for 1 h, and visualized with the Li-COR Odyssey imaging
system (Li-COR Biotechnology). Quantitative analysis of western blots was per-
formed using the Li-COR Odyssey software (LI-COR Biotechnology).
Immunofluorescence. Cells encapsulated in hydrogels for seven days were fixed
for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in DMEM/F12. Gels containing cells were
washed with PBS and incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS with calcium and mag-
nesium overnight followed by incubation in 50/50 30% sucrose/OCT for 6 h. Gels
were embedded in OCT and frozen prior to cutting 40 µm sections using a Microm
HM 550 Cryostat. Sections were blocked in PBS-BT+: PBS pH 7.4 (Gibco) sup-
plemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% Triton X-100
(Sigma-Aldrich), 0.3 M glycine (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% goat serum (Gibco), and
0.05% sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were incubated in primary anti-
bodies diluted in blocking solution as indicated in “antibodies” section for 1 h, and
then Alexa 488-, 555- or 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution for 30 min. Sections of gels containing
cells were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Inc.) with an HC PL APO 63× (1.40 NA Oil CS2) objective. Images
were collected from HyD and PMT detectors using LasX software and processed
using Photoshop (Adobe Systems).
For morphology analyses, ImageJ was used to trace cell clusters and circularity
measured using the Measurements function. Circularity, C, was calculated as,
C = 4π(A/p2), where A is the area and P is the perimeter. A perfect circle would
have a circularity of 1. Solidity was calculated as area enclosed by outer contour
of object divided by area enclosed by convex hull of outer contour.
Cell Profiler was used to quantify YAP nuclear/cytoplasmic intensity in IF
images. ImageJ was used to trace cell nuclei using DAPI images using the following
macro (pixel/µm of image was first determined and replaced in “Set Scale” distance;
found pixel/µm of image by drawing line over scale bar embedded in image and
using the function Analyze - > Set Scale). Doublets or cell debris were then
manually excluded. Nuclear traces were then overlaid on YAP images to measure
mean nuclear YAP intensity using the following macro.

Tissue immunohistochemistry. IHC staining was performed on paraffin-
embedded tissue microarray (TMA) sections (Stanford TA419, 445, 424). Anti-
S100A7 polyclonal antibody at 1:100 (Millipore-Sigma St. Louis, MO, catalog #
HPA006997) was used as primary antibody for IHC staining. Antibody was diluted
in PBS. TMA sections measuring 4 µm were deparaffinized in 3 changes of xylene
for 10 mins each and hydrated in gradient series of ethyl alcohol. Following target
retrieval in 10 mM citrate pH6 (Dako/Agilent, Carpinteria, CA, USA, catalog
#S2369) to retrieve antigenic sites at 116 °C for 3 min. Staining was then performed
using the VectaStain ABC anti-rabbit kit (Vector Laboratories Burlingame CA,
USA, catalog #PK6101). Diaminobenzidine (DAB) (DAKO/Agilent, Carpinteria,
CA, USA, catalog #K3468) was used at room temperature for 10 min for color
development. The IHC Profiler macro for ImageJ was used to quantify YAP and
S100A7 intensity in IHC samples38.
RNA extraction and next generation sequencing. Gels containing MCF10A cells
were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and treated with ice-cold PBS supple-
mented with 50 mM EDTA to break up IPNs. RNA was harvested using a com-
bination of TRIZOL reagent and GenCatch Total RNA Extraction Kit (Epoch).
RNA-seq experiments were performed in biological replicate and cDNA libraries
constructed using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2. Libraries were sequenced
on a single lane of the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform with 50 bp paired end reads.
Following quality assessment via FastQC, adapter and quality trimming was exe-
cuted with Trim Galore. Reads were subsequently aligned to the hg19 genome
assembly via Bowtie2 with ~97% concordant alignment rate in all samples. After
filtering for unmapped, low quality, and multimapped reads, mapped reads were
summarized to gene features by HTSeq. Sequencing depth ranged from 30 to 42
million postfiltered reads. We used DESeq2 to evaluate significant cases of dif-
ferential expression between a given pairwise comparison. Before adjusting p-
values for multiple testing, DESeq2 implements independent filtering using mean
expressions of each gene as a filter. Adjusting via the Benjamini & Hochberg
method, differentially expressed genes with FDR < 0.05 were called significant.
Prior to clustering, we used DESeq2’s implementation of regularized logarithm
transformation (rlog) to stabilize the variance of genes across samples. Mean
expression values were used as input to hierarchical clustering of the differentially
expressed genes between soft v. stiff IPN. Gene ontology and TF association
analysis using ChIP-seq data from ENCODE was implemented via EnrichR39.
Adjusted p values, which take into account differing sizes of data sets, are reported.
Statistical analysis. Multiple comparisons were conducted with one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey post hoc comparison and pairwise comparisons performed
using Student’s t tests. Bars represent mean ± SEM and symbols represent each
experiment (for EdU assays), cell cluster (for invasion assays), patient (for 3SEQ
expression), and nucleus (for nuclear morphology assays). For graphs of RNA-seq
normalized counts from 3D culture, bars represent mean ± SD and symbols
represent each RNA-seq experiment using two independent trials. Values with
p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, indicated by **.
