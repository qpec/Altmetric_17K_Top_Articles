abstract
OBJECTIVES: Children do not eat enough servings of vegetables, underscoring the need for 
effective interventions encouraging this behavior. The purpose of this research was to 
measure the impact that daily exposure to branded vegetable characters has on vegetable 
selection among boys and girls in elementary schools.
METHODS: In a large urban school district, 10 elementary schools agreed to participate in the 
study. They were randomly assigned to a control condition or 1 of 3 treatment conditions: 
(1) a vinyl banner displaying vegetable characters that was fastened around the base of 
the salad bar; (2) short television segments with health education delivered by vegetable 
characters; or (3) a combination of the vinyl banner and television segments. We collected 
22 206 student-day observations over a 6-week period by tallying the number of boys and 
girls taking vegetables from the school’s salad bar.
RESULTS: Results show that 90.5% (from 12.6% to 24.0%; P = .04) more students took 
vegetables from the salad bar when exposed to the vinyl banner only, and 239.2% (from 
10.2% to 34.6%; P < .001) more students visited the salad bar when exposed to both the 
television segments and vinyl banners. Both boys and girls responded positively to the vinyl 
banners (P < .05 in both cases).
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this study highlights the positive impact of branded media 
on children’s vegetable selection in the school cafeteria. Results from this study suggest 
potential opportunities for using branded media to encourage healthier choices for 
children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children do 
not eat enough fruits and vegetables and are often 
inundated with advertisements for less nutritious 
foods. In fact, many experts have called for bans on 
food advertising to children.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This research builds on 
previous work that illustrates how branded media 
that appeal to children can lead both boys and girls 
to take more fresh vegetables.

Despite the health benefits of fruits 
and vegetables, 
1 children still do not 
eat the recommended amounts.2 To 
increase fruit and vegetable intake 
in school-aged children, lawmakers 
passed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids 
Act of 2010, which granted the US 
Department of Agriculture authority 
to update nutrition regulations for 
the National School Lunch Program. 
All public and nonprofit-private 
schools are eligible to participate in 
the National School Lunch Program, 
and if they choose to participate, 
they are required to comply with the 
prescribed standards.
Nutrition requirements associated 
with the new act include increasing 
the variety of vegetables served, 
ensuring that each lunch includes a 
serving of fruit or vegetables, serving 
more whole grain breads and pastas, 
and serving only 1% and fat-free milk 
varieties and only fat-free flavored 
milk.3 These new requirements aim 
to increase students’ exposure to 
healthier foods at lunch with the 
expectation that increased exposure 
will lead to increased intake.4–7 
Recent research highlights some 
success in low-income schools, 
8, 
9 
although the evidence indicates that 
more food is wasted when choices 
are eliminated.10
In contrast to the regulatory 
approach, modifications to a child’s 
external environment can influence 
food choice. For example, retrofitting 
1 of 2 lunch lines to serve healthier 
foods only can decrease caloric 
intake among children, 
11 and 
simply paying children to eat their 
vegetables can also be effective.12 
Furthermore, there is evidence that 
peer pressure and serving foods in 
more attractive bowls increase fruit 
and vegetable uptake.5, 
13, 
14 However, 
there is less evidence documenting 
the impact of conventional marketing 
techniques in increasing fruit and 
vegetable selection among children. 
The primary objective of the present 
research was to measure the effect 
of a vegetable marketing campaign 
in elementary school cafeterias to 
increase uptake of salad and other 
vegetables.
Influential individuals and 
organizations have recently 
advocated for marketing healthy 
food choices. In the same year 
(2013) the Institute of Medicine 
called for companies and marketers 
to promote healthier diets, 
15 the 
Produce Marketing Association 
joined forces with Sesame Workshop 
and the Partnership for a Healthier 
America in a 2-year collaborative 
effort to promote fruit and vegetable 
consumption among children through 
a no-licensing fee use of the Sesame 
Street brand. This collaboration 
stems in part from research 
illustrating the positive impact media 
can have on consumption of fruits 
and vegetables.16–18 In addition, use 
of iconic characters can also increase 
fruit and vegetable consumption in 
children, 
19–21 although these studies 
often have small sample sizes and 
limited scope. Furthermore, there 
is mixed evidence documenting the 
differential impact of marketing 
interventions among boys and 
girls.22, 
23 At baseline, however, boys 
often eat fewer vegetables than 
girls24, 
25; thus, it is worth studying if 
an asymmetric response to marketing 
technique exists between sexes.
Despite the evidence supporting 
marketing strategies to encourage 
healthier food choice among 
children, critics such as Susan Linn 
of Campaign for a Commercial-Free 
Childhood, Michele Simon of Eat 
Drink Politics, and others continue 
to push for complete elimination 
of marketing to children.26–28 
These critics argue that children 
are already too frequently exposed 
to advertisements, especially for 
energy-dense foods, 
29–33 leading to 
poor food choices.6, 
34, 
35 Consistent, 
however, with the Institute of 
Medicine call, a more general 
consensus is to regulate marketing to 
children for the time being, leaving 
open the option to advertise healthy 
foods to them.24, 
36 Thus, there is 
opportunity to build on previous 
research by identifying effective 
marketing tactics to promote 
vegetables to children on a larger 
scale than has previously been done.
In a collaborative effort between 
Cornell University’s Center for 
Behavioral Economics in Child 
Nutrition Programs, Founder’s 
Farms, Super Sprowtz, and schools 
in a large urban school district, 
researchers worked with 10 
elementary school cafeterias to study 
the impact marketing media using 
branded vegetable characters have 
on vegetable uptake, and if boys and 
girls respond differently to the media.
METHODS
Study Design
This study was conducted over 
6 weeks (April 8, 2013–May 24, 
2013). Researchers’ availability 
for collecting data and schools’ 
willingness to participate limited 
the duration of the study to this 
time frame. In weeks 1 and 2, no 
changes were made, and data were 
collected for baseline measures. 
The interventions were then 
implemented and maintained 
throughout weeks 3 through 6. A 
4-week intervention period was 
scheduled to minimize novelty 
effects.
A total of 12 schools initially agreed 
to participate in the study, although 
2 schools chose to withdraw during 
the data collection phase. To identify 
the causal impact of branded media 
on student behavior, schools were 
randomly assigned into a control 
condition (n = 2) or 1 of 3 treatment 
conditions: (1) a vinyl banner (n = 
2); (2) television segments (n = 3); 
or (3) a vinyl banner and television 
segments (n = 3). The weekend 
before the treatment period began, 
volunteer researchers visited the 
schools assigned to a treatment 
and assisted food service staff in

installing the banners and televisions, 
which remained in the cafeterias 
during the entire treatment period. 
Students enrolled in the schools 
were blinded to the group 
assignments. With this study design, 
the following hypotheses were 
generated:
Hypothesis 1: Children in schools 
with the vinyl banners will select 
more vegetables.
Hypothesis 2: Children in schools 
with the television segments 
playing will select more vegetables.
Hypothesis 3: Children in schools 
with both types of media will select 
more vegetables, although the 
effects are not additive.
Given the mixed results in previous 
research illustrating sex differences 
in behavioral responses to 
interventions, 
24, 
25 the goal of the 
analysis was to help us understand 
what differences, if any, might arise.
Branded Media Interventions
For this study, the branded media 
consist of a vinyl banner with 
vegetable characters printed across 
the front and short segments 
shown on a flat screen television. 
Researchers fastened each vinyl 
banner to the metal casing on the 
lower portion of the salad bar just 
below the area where the salad 
components are served and wrapped 
the banner around the whole salad 
bar. They also placed small stands 
above the sneeze shield to hold a 
second rectangular banner (Fig 1). 
Second, flat screen televisions were 
placed on small tables near the 
school’s salad bar to attract children’s 
attention. Short video segments with 
the branded vegetable characters 
delivering nutrition education 
messages ran on the televisions. In all 
the intervention schools, small decals 
printed with the vegetable characters 
were placed on the floor to direct 
traffic to the salad bars.
The characters shown in the branded 
media are vegetables with human 
attributes such as arms, legs, and 
a mouth, as well as super-human 
strength. Vegetables promoted by 
the characters are broccoli, carrots, 
spinach, peas, onions, garlic, zucchini, 
tomatoes, eggplant, and mushrooms. 
Independent from this research, 
these vegetable characters were 
conceived, developed, and licensed 
by Super Sprowtz. Through 
Founder’s Farm, Super Sprowtz 
donated the vinyl banners, 
televisions, television segments, 
and floor decals to the participating 
schools. In addition, Founders Farm 
recruited volunteers to assist in 
carrying out the study.
School Characteristics
Schools in this study were selected 
from a large urban northeastern 
US school district and agreed 
to participate in a randomized 
controlled field study. Median 
household income in this district is 
just under $52, 
000, and 82% of the 
students receive a free or reduced 
price lunch.37, 
38 Schools in the 
control group had the lowest average 
enrollment at 465 students, whereas 
schools in the combined intervention 
had the highest enrollment at 
668 students. Furthermore, the 
percentage of students receiving 
a free or reduced price lunch was 
lowest in the schools with the 
3

HANKS et al 
combined intervention at 70% and 
highest in schools with the television 
segment–only intervention at 91%. 
Finally, the percentage of black or 
Hispanic students in the schools 
varied from 73% in the control 
schools to 94% in the schools with 
a vinyl banner. These summary 
statistics suggest systematic 
differences in the sampled treatment 
schools, although it is not clear how 
these differences affect the direction 
of changes under the treatments. It 
is difficult to claim our comparisons 
as a complete randomization check, 
39 
but it does suggest some caution in 
interpreting the results. The Cornell 
University institutional review board 
approved this research.
Data and Analysis
Two types of data were collected 
to measure the impact of media 
on student behavior. First, food 
preparation records were collected 
for all 10 schools. These records 
report the number of servings taken 
for each food item as well as the 
number of children receiving lunch. 
Vegetable servings taken met the 
requirement that children in grades 
kindergarten through 8 receive 
three-quarters cup of vegetables 
each day.3 The outcome measures 
of interest are the number and 
percentage of students taking salad 
and vegetables during lunch. The 
percent measure was calculated by 
dividing the number of students 
taking salad and vegetables by the 
number of students receiving lunch.
We also collected counts of the 
number of boys and girls serving 
themselves vegetables at the salad 
bar. To collect these counts, trained 
researchers visited 4 randomly 
selected schools (1 from each 
treatment condition or the control 
condition) during the school’s lunch 
period. With a hand clicker in each 
hand, these researchers used the 
right clicker to tally male students 
and the left clicker to tally female 
students visiting the salad bar. 
These data were collected during the 
baseline period on April 16–17 and 
during the treatment periods on April 
25–26, April 30, May 1, May 6–7, and 
May 14–15.
The count data generated 3 outcome 
measures: (1) number of students 
taking vegetables from the salad 
bar; (2) percentage of students 
taking vegetables from the salad 
bar, calculated by dividing count 
values by the total number of 
children receiving lunch; and (3) 
separate counts of girls and boys 
taking vegetables from the salad bar. 
Because the total number of boys or 
girls in the school was not provided, 
we could not calculate the percentage 
of boys or girls visiting the salad bar. 
Based on the total number of lunches 
taken each day, the total number 
of student-day observations was 
22 206. Notably, the count data are 
different from the food preparation 
records because the count data only 
tally the number of students taking 
vegetables from the salad bar. In 
contrast, food preparation records 
track the number of vegetable and 
salad servings taken from both the 
salad bar and from the lunch line.
For analysis, we used a random 
effects regression model with 
random effects at the school level. A 
random effects model was considered 
appropriate to adjust the SEs based 
on unobservable characteristics at 
the school level and because there 
was no a priori reason to test for 
significance of school-level fixed 
effects. The independent variables in 
the model indicate the intervention 
group to which a school is assigned, 
whether the observation is measured 
during the intervention or baseline 
period, and the interaction between 
these 2 variables; no other covariates 
were included. We report results 
first for food preparation records 
and then for the count data. Reported 
values in the figures and calculated 
percent changes were derived from 
estimated means resulting from the 
fitted regression model. Reported 
P values correspond to interaction 
effects from the regressions.
RESULTS
The data reported in Fig 2 were 
extracted from food preparation 
records, and they illustrate the 
increase in average daily vegetable 
and salad servings taken. Most 
notable is the increase in vegetable 
and salad servings taken by students 
in schools with the branded media 
relative to schools in the control 
group. Analyses of food preparation 
records reveal an increase from 60 
to 185 in average daily vegetable 
and salad servings taken (P = .028) 
by students in schools with vinyl 
banners and television segments. 
Although schools with only the vinyl 
banners or television segments 
experienced increases in servings 
of salad and vegetables taken, the 
increases were not statistically 
significant. These percent increases 
were compared with a statistically 
insignificant change in vegetable and 
salad servings taken in the control 
schools.
Different than food preparation 
records, count data measure 
the frequency of children taking 
vegetables from the salad bar only. 
In schools with the vinyl banners, 
an increase from 12.6% to 24.0% 
(P = .04) (Fig 3) of students took 
vegetables from the salad bar. 
In schools with both television 
segments and vinyl banners, there 
was an increase from 10.2% to 
34.6% of students taking vegetables 
from the salad bar (P < .001). These 
increases are compared with a 
statistically insignificant change in 
the percentage of students taking 
vegetables from salad bars in control 
schools.
The count data also differentiate 
students according to sex. 
Specifically, more girls took 
vegetables from the salad bar (from 
42 to 95; P = .02) (Fig 4) when 
vinyl banners were installed, and 
4

more girls took vegetables from the 
salad bar (from 35 to 126; P < .001) 
when both television segments and 
vinyl banners were installed. Male 
students were only influenced by 
vinyl banners such that in schools 
with this intervention alone, 
an increase from 25 to 66 took 
vegetables from the salad bar (P = 
.01) (Fig 5).
DISCUSSION
In this field experiment, branded 
media exposure dramatically 
increased the percentage of students 
taking vegetables overall and at the 
salad bar. In fact, across all media 
types, there was a 134.6% increase 
in the percentage of students taking 
vegetables from the salad bar, and 
schools with the vinyl banners only 
and those with both media types 
experienced the most significant 
behavioral response, supporting 
hypothesis 1. Given that the television 
segments alone did not have a 
significant impact, we do not have 
evidence to support hypothesis 2. It 
thus seems that the increase resulting 
from the combined intervention 
is mostly driven by exposure to 
the vinyl banner, which supports 
hypothesis 3. Some marketing 
research suggests print advertising is 
more effective at capturing attention 
relative to television advertising.40 
In addition, the vinyl banners were 
consistently located at the point of 
selection, whereas the television 
location was constrained by space 
and available power outlets.
This 6-week field study builds on 
previous research16–19, 
21, 
22, 
29 by 
studying how children respond to 
new branded media in a familiar food 
environment. In addition, exposure 
lengths of 4 weeks exceed media 
exposure in previous research. The 
strongly positive results highlight the 
value of marketing healthy options

to children and are consistent with 
the suggestions from groups such as 
the Institute of Medicine to leverage 
marketing strategies in a positive way.15
Similar to previous literature, the 
present study found differences 
at baseline in vegetable selection 
among boys and girls.24, 
25 We also 
found some differences in their 
responses to the branded media. 
Specifically, both boys and girls 
were more likely to take vegetables 
from the salad bar when a vinyl 
banner is in place, but only girls 
responded when both the television 
segments and vinyl banners were 
used. Because data from the food 
preparation records (Fig 2) indicate 
that the combination of the 2 media 
methods is effective for all children 
combined, it is possible that this 
combination is effective for boys 
in terms of increasing the overall 
amount of vegetables taken. Finally, 
in a separate set of analyses testing 
for a novelty effect, we found that 
boys responded positively to the 
combination of media types in 
weeks 1 and 2 of the intervention, 
but this effect wore off by the third 
week. These discrepancies in the 
results provide interesting avenues 
for research, at least in terms of

identifying if and when boys and girls 
respond differently to various types 
of media.
Most of the Super Sprowtz characters 
used in this study represent food 
items often found on school lunch 
lines and in school salad bars. Notably, 
the vegetable characters represent 3 
of the categories outlined in the new 
requirements, promoting uptake of 
a variety of vegetables. Each week 
schools are required to serve dark 
greens such as spinach or broccoli, 
red and orange vegetables such as 
tomatoes or carrots, beans or peas 
(or other legumes such as lentils), 
or starchy vegetables such as corn 
or potatoes.3 Furthermore, based on 
data from preparation records, there 
is general consistency between what 
children saw through the branded 
media and what was offered both on 
the lunch line and in the salad bars, 
resulting in increases in vegetable 
uptake among the children.
The strength of these findings 
should be considered in context 
of the following limitations. First, 
the 4-week intervention may not 
have been long enough to eliminate 
novelty effects, and thus there is need 
for additional research to test longer 
term effects of similar interventions. 
In addition, actual food and nutrient 
intake and longer term habit-forming 
measures were not gathered, but 
they are of great interest given the 
importance of child nutrition and 
the need to help children develop 
healthy eating habits. Furthermore, 
this study did not examine the 
potential link between media in the 
school lunch room and behavior 
outside of school or the potentially 
differential impact of animal versus 
vegetable characters, both of which 
are interesting areas for future 
research. In addition, the characters 
in this study are less well known 
relative to other characters, such as 
those from Sesame Street, and it is 
unknown whether the familiarity of 
the characters has an impact on food 
choice.
We note that in the participating 
schools, 82% of students receiving 
lunch received it for free or at a 
reduced price, thus biasing the 
results toward lower income 
children. We also note that the 
small sample of schools limits the 
generalizability of the results and 
renders it difficult to determine 
how well balanced the treatment 
groups are. Finally, even though 
all 10 schools in the study already 
had a salad bar before the study, 
this feature is uncommon (although 
advocates are pushing to bring salad 
bars to more schools).41,

CONCLUSIONS
The research presented here 
highlights an opportunity for 
marketers and children to both 
benefit from branded media. 
Persuasive influences of marketing 
media can be leveraged in a 
positive way, encouraging children 
to make more nutritious choices. 
In addition, school food service 
managers can use these findings and 
other marketing opportunities in 
relatively inexpensive ways, such as 
providing descriptive names for the 
foods they offer and making them 
more convenient to take.14, 
43 With 
childhood nutrition as the ultimate 
goal, the synergistic combination 
of marketing strategies and healthy 
choices has great potential for 
improving what children take and 
eat, both in and out of school.
