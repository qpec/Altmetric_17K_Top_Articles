Objectives:
 Malignant
 pleural
 effusion  (MPE)
 has  a poor  prognosis.
 Most  patients
 are  treated
 with  tube
thoracostomy
 and  sclerotherapy,
 although
 its success
 rate  is  around  64%.
 We have  investigated
 intrapleu-
ral
 perfusion
 with  hyperthermic
 chemotherapy
 (IPHC)
 using  cisplatin
 in  a study  with
 a  pharmacokinetic
evaluation.
Methods:
 Patients
 with  MPE,  performance
 status  of  0–1,  possibility
 of  good  lung  expansion
 and
Cr
 <  1.2  mg/dL
 were  treated
 with  IPHC.  The  circuit  was  filled  with  2000  mL  of  normal
 saline  contain-
ing
 cisplatin
 at
 a dose  of
 80  mg/m2.
 Under  video-assisted
 thoracoscopic
 surgery,  the  thoracic
 cavity  was
filled
 and  perfused
 at  a speed
 of  approximately
 1 L/min  at
 a  temperature
 of  43 ◦C  for  1  h.  Perfusion
 solution
and
 plasma
 samples
 were  periodically
 collected,
 and  concentrations
 of
 protein-unbound
 (free)
 platinum,
which
 was  the  active  derivative
 of  cisplatin,
 and  total  platinum
 were  determined  by  flameless
 atomic
absorption
 spectrometry.
Results:
 Twenty
 patients  with  MPE  (8
 lung  cancers,
 7
 mesotheliomas,
 and  5 others)
 were
 enrolled
 in  this
study.
 Rate  of  free  platinum
 concentration
 relative  to  total  platinum
 concentration
 in  perfusion
 solution
after
 1hr  IPHC  at  43 ◦C  was  61.1  ±
 12.9%.  Area under
 curve  (AUC)  of
 free  platinum
 in the  pleural
 space  was
calculated
 to be  26.3  �g/mLxh,  resulting
 in  complete
 control  of  pleural  effusion
 for  3
 months
 after
 IHPC
in
 all
 cases
 (95%  confidence
 interval:
 83–100%).
 While,  absorption
 rate  of  total  platinum  from  the  pleural
space
 was 33.8  ±  17.0%  (27.4  ±
 13.6  mg/m2),
 and  the  maximum
 concentration
 of
 total
 platinum
 in serum
was
 low,  0.66  ± 0.31  �g/mL,  resulting
 in  controllable
 side  effects;  grade
 1  renal
 toxicity:
 6  patients,
 grade
1  emesis:
 7
 patients.
Conclusions:
 IPHC  with
 cisplatin
 showed
 favorable
 pharmacokinetic
 profiles
 for  an  optional
 treatment
 to
control malignant
 pleural  effusion.

 Introduction
Although
 malignant
 pleural
 effusion
 (MPE)
 is
 not
 a
 rare
 occur-
rence,
 the
 preferred
 treatment
 for
 patients
 with
 MPE
 and
 pleural
dissemination
 has
 not
 been
 determined.
 Lung
 cancer
 is
 the
 most
common
 primary
 neoplasm
 that
 metastasizes
 to
 the
 pleura,
 but
although
 pleural
 mesothelioma
 is
 rare,
 it
 is
 also
 an
 important
 cause
of
 MPE.
 Current
 treatment
 options
 for
 malignant
 pleural
 effusion
are
 limited;
 we
 usually
 use
 minocycline,
 OK432
 and
 talc
 for
 pleu-
rodesis.
 But
 the
 success
 rate
 of
 pleurodesis
 using
 these
 agents

reported
 to
 be
 around
 64%
 [1],
 indicating
 insufficient
 control
 by
 this
modality.
Hyperthermia
 was
 found
 to
 increase
 the
 cytotoxicity
 of
chemotherapeutic
 agents,
 including
 cisplatin
 (CDDP),
 in
 vitro
 [2,3]
and
 in
 vivo.
 [4]
 Wallner
 KE
 et
 al.
 [2]
 and
 Hettinga
 JV
 et
 al.
 [3]
reported
 that
 the
 hyperthermia
 reinforces
 the
 cytotoxicity
 reaction
of
 CDDP
 synergistically,
 and
 heated
 CDDP
 at
 43 ◦C
 was
 effective
 in
both
 CDDP
 hypersensitive
 and
 hyposensitive
 tumors.
 Urano
 et
 al.
[4]
 observed
 that
 the
 cytotoxic
 effect
 of
 CDDP
 was
 enhanced
 at
elevated
 temperatures
 in
 vivo.
 In
 humans,
 hyperthermic
 intraperi-
toneal
 chemotherapy
 (HIPEC)
 with
 CDDP
 was
 first
 developed
 in
peritoneal
 mesothelioma
 [5]
 followed
 by
 ovarian
 canrcinoma.
 [6]
 It
was
 suggested
 that
 HIPEC
 with
 CDDP
 might
 improve
 the
 treatment
outcome
 of
 patients
 with
 peritoneal
 mesothelioma
 or
 ovarian
 can-
cer
 as
 salvage
 therapy,
 which
 let
 researchers
 investigate

intrapleural
 perfusion
 with
 hyperthermic
 chemotherapy
 (IPHC)
worked
 in
 subjects
 with
 malignant
 pleural
 effusion.
In
 order
 to
 obtain
 adequate
 control
 of
 MPE,
 IPHC
 using
 CDDP
 has
been
 reported
 and
 introduced
 [7–9].
 Matszaki
 et
 al.
 [7]
 performed
IPHC
 with
 CDDP
 for
 2
 h
 at
 43 ◦C,
 and
 reported
 that
 the
 control
 of
pleural
 effusion
 of
 lung
 cancer
 was
 100%
 in
 12
 cases.
 Ratto
 GB
 et
 al.
[8]
 showed
 that
 IPHC
 with
 CDDP
 100
 mg/m2 at
 a
 temperature
 of
41.5 ◦C
 for
 1
 h
 had
 feasible
 to
 10
 patients
 with
 pleural
 mesothe-
lioma.
 Ried
 M
 et
 al.
 [9]
 reported
 that
 extended
 thymoma
 resections,
including
 adjacent
 structures
 and
 pleurectomy/decortication,
 with
IPHC
 using
 CDDP
 provided
 a
 low
 recurrence
 rate
 and
 acceptable
median
 survival,
 11%
 (1
 out
 of
 9
 patients)
 and
 25
 months,
 respec-
tively.
These
 reports
 for
 IPHC
 using
 CDDP
 employed
 limited
 number
 of
patients.
 And,
 although
 a
 few
 reports
 investigated
 pharmacokinet-
ics
 (PK)
 of
 CDDP,
 pharmacodynamics
 (PD)
 was
 considered
 not
 to
 be
enough.
 In
 this
 study
 for
 cases
 with
 MPE,
 we
 have
 investigated
 the
PK
 of
 IPHC
 using
 CDDP
 with
 a
 focus
 on
 side
 effects
 and
 effective-
ness.
 And
 we
 make
 a
 comparison
 of
 PK/PD
 of
 CDDP
 between
 IPHC
and
 intravenous
 administration
 measured
 in
 our
 previous
 study.
2.
 Patients
 and
 methods
2.1.
 Study
 protocol
 and
 actual
 methods
 of
 IHPC
This
 open-label
 prospective
 study
 investigated
 pharmacokinet-
ics,
 safety
 and
 effectiveness
 of
 IPHC
 using
 CDDP
 at
 a
 dosage
 of
80
 mg/m2 for
 1
 h
 in
 patients
 with
 MPE.
 This
 study
 was
 performed
in
 accordance
 with
 the
 Helsinki
 Declaration
 (1964,
 amended
 in
2004)
 of
 the
 World
 Medical
 Association,
 and
 the
 study
 protocol
was
 approved
 by
 the
 institutional
 review
 board
 of
 Saitama
 Medical
University
 (#329).
 The
 main
 eligibility
 criteria
 included
 inpatients
with
 MPE,
 who
 were
 20
 years
 or
 older,
 had
 performance
 status
 (PS)
of
 0–1
 and
 had
 ALT
 <
 100
 IU/L
 and
 AST
 <
 100
 IU/L,
 serum
 creatinine
<1.2
 mg/dL
 and
 body
 temperature
 <
 37 ◦ Celsius.
 Furthermore,
 they
should
 be
 expected
 to
 have
 high
 possibility
 for
 good
 lung
 expan-
sion
 after
 removing
 MPE.
 After
 obtaining
 informed
 consent
 was
obtained,
 they
 underwent
 IPHC
 using
 CDDP.
After
 investigating
 the
 pleural
 space
 under
 video-assisted
 tho-
racoscopic
 surgery
 (VATS),
 perfusion
 was
 performed
 with
 a
 roller
pump
 and
 heat
 exchanger
 (Fig.
 1).
 The
 circuit
 was
 filled
 with
2000
 mL  of
 normal
 saline,
 the
 thoracic
 cavity
 was
 filled
 and
 per-
fused
 with
 the
 saline
 solution,
 which
 was
 heated
 by
 the
 heat
exchanger,
 under
 general
 anesthesia
 with
 both-lung
 ventilation.
CDDP
 at
 a
 dose
 of
 80
 mg/m2 was
 added
 to
 the
 circuit
 fluid
 when
the
 temperature
 stabilized
 at
 42.5 ◦C
 (range
 42.0–43.5 ◦C).
 IPHC
 was
then
 performed
 for
 60
 min
 with
 a
 pump
 flow
 rate
 of
 1
 L/min.
 Subse-
quently,
 all
 fluid
 containing
 CDDP
 was
 removed
 from
 the
 thoracic
cavity.
Patients
 were
 systematically
 given
 hydration
 of
 2000
 mL/day
on
 the
 day
 when
 IPHC
 was
 done,
 and
 continued
 the
 hydration
 of
2000
 mL/day
 for
 4
 days.
 Patients
 were
 also
 given
 antiemetic
 treat-
ments,
 such
 as
 5HT3
 antagonist.
 Chest
 drainage
 was
 maintained
during
 one
 week.
2.2.
 Pharmacokinetics
 and
 analytical
 method
Heparinized
 blood
 samples
 (5
 mL)
 for
 the
 pharmacokinetic
study
 were
 obtained
 before
 and
 at
 0.5,
 1,
 24,
 and
 48
 h
 (h)
 after
adding
 CDDP.
 The
 blood
 was
 centrifuged
 immediately,
 and
 plasma
samples
 to
 measure
 total
 platinum
 concentrations
 were
 stored
 at
−20 ◦C.
 In
 addition,
 5
 mL  of
 the
 perfusion
 solution
 was
 collected
after
 completion
 of
 IPHC.
 In
 order
 to
 measure
 protein-unbound
(free)
 platinum
 in
 the
 perfusion
 solution,
 1
 mL  of
 the
 solution
 was
centrifuged
 using
 an
 Amicon
 Centrifree
 4104
 (Amicon
 Corporation,
Mass.)
 at
 1980
 g
 for
 20
 min.
 The
 concentrations
 of
 free
 platinum
 and
total
 platinum
 were
 determined
 by
 flameless
 atomic
 absorption
spectrometry.
 [10]
Maximum
 peak
 concentrations
 (Cmax)
 of
 CDDP
 in
 blood
 were
obtained
 directly
 from
 the
 serum
 concentration-time
 data.
 The
 area
under
 concentration
 (AUC)
 of
 total
 platinum
 in
 plasma
 from
 0
 to
1
 h
 (AUC0-1)
 and
 the
 AUC
 from
 1
 h
 to
 the
 last
 measurable
 sampling
point
 (AUC1-48)
 was
 calculated
 by
 the
 trapezoidal
 rule.
 To
 calculate
systemic
 absorption
 rates
 of
 total
 platinum
 from
 the
 pleural
 space,
the
 following
 formula
 was
 used;
Systemic
 absorption
 rate
 =
 (administered
 total
 platinum
 −
 total
platinum
 concentration
 in
 the
 perfusion
 solution
 x
 solution
 volume
after
 IPHC)/administered
 total
 platinum
 ×
 100.
The
 rate
 of
 free
 platinum
 per
 total
 platinum
 in
 the
 perfusion
solution
 after
 1
 h
 of
 IPHC
 was
 calculated.
2.3.
 Adverse
 events
 and
 effectiveness
To
 evaluate
 patients’
 morbidity,
 we  evaluated
 changes
 in
 body
temperature
 in
 the
 rectum
 and
 the
 esophagus.
 All
 adverse
 events
were
 reported,
 and
 severity
 was
 graded
 by
 the
 National
 Cancer
Institute
 Common
 Toxicity
 Criteria
 (version
 3.0).
 Routine
 clinical
and
 laboratory
 assessments
 were
 performed
 on
 days
 2,
 4,
 6,
 and
 8
during
 the
 inpatient
 period,
 then,
 at
 least
 on
 day
 15
 at
 the
 outpatient
clinic.
As
 to
 the
 treatment’s
 effectiveness,
 we
 evaluated
 the
 complete
control
 of
 pleural
 perfusion,
 which
 was
 defined
 as
 no
 pleural
 effu-
sion
 3
 months
 after
 IPHC.
2.4.
 Statistical
 analysis
Statistical
 significance
 of
 differences
 among
 3
 groups
 was
 deter-
mined
 by
 Kruskal-Wallis
 one-way
 analysis
 of
 variance
 on
 ranks.
Multiple
 comparisons
 for
 all
 the
 paired
 groups
 were
 further
 per-
formed
 by
 Dunn’s
 method.

 Patient
 characteristics
Between
 August
 2005
 and
 March
 2008,
 20
 patients
 with
 MPE
were
 enrolled
 in
 this
 study.
 The
 demographic
 features
 of
 these
patients
 are
 summarized
 in
 Table

 The
 patients
 comprised
 13
males
 and
 7
 females,
 38–78
 years
 old,
 with
 PS
 0–1.
 There
 were
 8
patients
 with
 lung
 carcinoma,
 and
 7
 patients
 with
 pleural
 mesothe-
lioma.
 Of
 the
 other
 5
 patients,
 2
 patients
 had
 thymic
 malignancy,
1
 had
 renal
 cell
 carcinoma,
 and
 1
 had
 ovarian
 carcinoma.
 One
patient’s
 primary

 Pharmacokinetics
 of
 CDDP
 under
 IPHC
Systemic
 absorption
 rates
 of
 total
 platinum
 from
 the
 pleural
space
 were
 measured
 and
 calculated
 in
 all
 patients.
 (Table

The
 systemic
 absorption
 rates
 of
 patients
 with
 lung
 cancer
 and
mesothelioma
 were
 higher
 than
 those
 with
 other
 malignancies
of
 thymic

 Discussion
All
 of
 our
 20
 patients
 achieved
 complete
 control
 of
 their
 pleural
effusion.
 We  have
 found
 [10]
 that
 CDDP
 is
 not
 a
 concentration-
dependent
 drug,
 but
 an
 AUC
 dependent
 drug.
 Thus,
 its
 antitumor
effect
 is
 determined
 by
 concentration
 x
 time
 of
 free
 platinum
derived
 from
 CDDP
 as
 protein-bound
 platinum
 is
 deactivated.
 In
this
 study,
 we  first
 clarified
 the
 AUC
 of
 free
 platinum
 in
 the
 pleu-
ral
 space
 under
 IPHC
 and
 its
 pharmacodynamics.
 We  found
 that
free-platinum
 from
 CDDP
 in
 the
 pleural
 space
 under
 IPHC
 was
 very
stable
 compared
 to
 that
 in
 plasma.
 [11]
 In
 our
 calculation,
 the
 AUC
of
 free
 platinum
 from
 CDDP
 in
 the
 pleural
 space
 is
 26.3
 �g/mLxh.
While,
 it
 was
 reported
 that
 intravenous
 administration
 of
 CDDP
80
 mg/m2 produced
 AUC
 of
 free
 platinum
 was
 3.47
 �g/mLxh.
 [11]
Much
 higher
 AUC
 value
 of
 free
 platinum
 in
 the
 pleural
 space
 could
produce
 a
 strong
 antitumor
 effect
 in
 the
 pleural
 space
 and
 explain
the
 complete
 control
 of
 the
 20
 patients
 with
 MPE.
The
 major
 toxic
 side
 effect
 related
 to
 IPHC
 using
 CDDP
 was
nephrotoxicity.
 Richards
 et
 al.
 [12]
 studied
 IPHC
 using
 CDDP
 at
dosages
 from
 50
 to
 250
 mg/m2,
 and
 found
 that
 3
 patients
 receiv-
ing
 CDDP
 at
 175–225
 mg/m2 experienced
 grade
 3
 renal
 toxicity.
Zimm
 S
 et
 al.
 [13]
 also
 reported
 that
 patients
 receiving
 CDDP
 doses
higher
 than
 200
 mg/m2 were
 likely
 to
 have
 renal
 side
 effect.
 While,
we
 observed
 no
 renal
 toxicities
 at
 grades
 2–4
 in
 our
 study.
 In
the
 present
 study,
 the
 maximum
 concentration
 of
 total
 platinum
in
 serum
 was
 relatively
 low,
 0.66
 ±
 0.31
 �g/mL.
 Absorption
 rate
of
 total
 platinum
 from
 the
 pleural
 space
 to
 the
 body
 was
 33.8%,
and
 this
 value
 indicated
 that
 IPHC
 with
 CDDP
 80
 mg/m2 for
 1
 h
 at
43 ◦C
 gave
 the
 body
 a
 dose
 of
 27.4
 mg/m2 of
 CDDP
 in
 average.
 We
reported
 before
 that
 intravenous
 weekly
 administration
 of
 CDDP
at
 doses
 of
 27,
 33,
 or
 40
 mg/m2 with
 1500
 mL  hydration,
 and
 this
weekly
 treatment
 did
 not
 produce
 severe
 renal
 toxicity.
 [14]
 How-
ever,
 the
 data
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3
 demonstrated
 the
 slow
 elimination
of
 CDDP
 from
 the
 body
 after
 IPHC,
 indicating
 importance
 of
 post
hydration
 during
 several
 days.
Another
 toxicity
 is
 lung
 edema.
 In
 animal
 experiments,
 Yoshida
M
 et
 al.
 [15]
 observed
 that
 lung
 edema
 could
 develop

hyperthermia
 at
 43 ◦C
 for
 3
 h.
 In
 humans,
 Matsuzaki
 et
 al.
 [7]
performed
 IPHC
 for
 2
 h
 at
 43 ◦C,
 and
 administered
 1000
 mg  methyl-
prednisolone
 intravenously
 to
 prevent
 pulmonary
 edema.
 In
 19
patients,
 2
 showed
 transient
 pulmonary
 infiltrates
 on
 the
 affected
side.
 In
 Shigemura’s
 series
 [16],
 4
 patients
 of
 7
 with
 2
 h
 circula-
tion
 perfusion
 showed
 pulmonary
 edema.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 it
was
 reported
 that
 none
 of
 5
 patients
 with
 1
 h
 circulation
 perfu-
sion
 showed
 pulmonary
 edema
 [17].
 Likely,
 our
 dosage,
 80
 mg/m2,
of
 CDDP
 using
 1
 h
 perfusion
 actively
 controlled
 malignant
 pleural
effusion
 with
 acceptable
 toxicity
 in
 regard
 to
 lung
 edema.
Our
 procedure,
 IPHC
 with
 CDDP
 at
 a
 dose
 of
 80
 mg/m2 for
 1
 h,
was
 safe
 and
 effective.
 Due
 to
 no
 serious
 clinical
 complications
 and
good
 control
 of
 MPE,
 post
 treatments
 after
 IPHS
 were
 performed
within
 37
 days
 in
 all
 patients;
 17
 patients
 received
 chemotherapy
and
 3
 patients
 received
 chemotherapy
 followed
 by
 extra-pleural
pneumonectomy.
In
 conclusion,
 IPHC
 with
 CDDP
 showed
 favorable
 pharmacoki-
netic
 profiles
 for
 an
 optional
 treatment
 to
 control
 malignant
 pleural
effusion.
