CONTEXT: Reimmunizing patients who had an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) 
is sometimes a challenge because there are limited data on the risk and severity of AEFI 
recurrence.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the literature on the risk of AEFI recurrence.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library.
STUDY SELECTION: We included articles in English or French published before September 30, 
2016. Articles were selected if they estimated the risk of AEFI recurrence in at least 5 
individuals. Studies with experimental vaccines were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data on study design, setting, population, vaccines, and AEFI recurrence were 
extracted.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles were included. Among patients with a history of hypotonic 
hyporesponsive episode (n = 398), anaphylaxis (n = 133), or seizures (n = 60) who were 
reimmunized, events recurred in 0% to 0.8%. Allergic-like events recurred in 30 of 
594 reimmunized patients. Fever recurred in 0% to 84% of 836 reimmunized patients, 
depending on the vaccine and dose number. Among children with extensive limb swelling 
after the fourth dose of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine, recurrence was 
higher when the fifth dose was given withthe full-antigen formulation (78%) compared with 
the reduced-antigen formulation (53%, P = .02)
LIMITATIONS: Many studies, included few patients, and those with severe AEFIs were often not 
reimmunized.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite vaccines being administered to millions of people annually, there are 
few studies in which researchers evaluated AEFI recurrence. Published studies suggest 
that reimmunization is usually safe. However in these studies, severe cases were often not 
reimmunized.

Downloaded from 
 For vaccines to be fully effective 
and induce long-term protective 
immunity, individuals should 
receive all recommended doses. 
Vaccine recipients who experienced 
an adverse event following 
immunization (AEFI) are sometimes 
afraid that the adverse event might 
recur with future immunizations, and 
this can lead to avoidance or delay 
of subsequent immunizations. Most 
existing recommendations regarding 
the management of patients who had 
an AEFI are based on expert opinion 
and supported by limited scientific 
data.1, 
 
2
The aim of this systematic review 
was to summarize the literature on 
the risk of AEFI recurrence (defined 
as an occurrence of the same AEFI 
after the administration of another 
dose of the same vaccine or vaccines 
sharing common antigens) and 
identify predictors of recurrence. 
In addition, we sought to determine 
if the risk of an adverse event 
following reimmunization was 
higher in patients who already 
had the same adverse event at the 
previous immunization compared 
with those who did not. These results 
are expected to inform physicians 
when discussing continuation of 
immunization with patients who 
previously experienced an AEFI and 
to support future immunization 
guidelines for these patients.
MeThods
We conducted a systematic review 
of studies published in English and 
French before September 30, 2016 
in Medline via PubMed, Embase, 
and the Cochrane library. Ethical 
approval was not required because 
only published articles were included 
in this review.
The search strategy was developed 
in consultation with an experienced 
medical library scientist using 
the preferred reporting items 
for systematic reviews and 
meta-analysis of observational 
studies recommendations.3, 
 
4 
The search combined keywords 
(with corresponding synonyms, 
Medical Subject Headings and 
Emtree terms) referring to our 
intervention (ie, “reimmunization” 
and “immunization”) and outcome 
(ie, “adverse events”). No restriction 
on study type or population was 
used to get a full perspective of the 
research that has been done to date. 
The search strategy in Medline via 
PubMed is available in Supplemental 
Table 5.
The titles and abstracts of the 
publications identified were 
independently screened for 
eligibility by 2 investigators (J.G.Z., 
M.K.); interrater discrepancies 
were resolved by discussion and 
consensus. Additional articles 
were identified by reviewing the 
reference lists of retrieved articles. 
J.G.Z. selected the full-text articles. 
A flow diagram outlining the 
selection process is presented in Fig 
1. We included all studies in which 
researchers estimated the risk of 
AEFI recurrence or that described 
the outcome of reimmunization 
among patients with a history of 
AEFI. Exclusion criteria were the 
following: experimental vaccines 
(eg, malaria), cancer vaccines, 
vaccines administered at more 
than 5-year intervals (eg, yellow 
fever) and studies in which fewer 
than 5 patients were reimmunized. 
Recurrence was defined as the 
occurrence of the same adverse 
event following reimmunization. 
Reimmunization was defined as 
administration of vaccine(s) that 
had common antigens with those 
implicated in the initial AEFI. The 
case definitions of each evaluated 
AEFI are presented in Table 1.
For each study, the risk of bias with 
respect to our review question was 
assessed by using a standardized 
form adapted from the guidelines 
of the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence6 and Risk Of 
Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of 
Interventions7 (Supplemental Tables 
6, Supplemental Fig 3 and 4). Risk of 
bias was rated as “low, 
” “moderate, 
” 
“serious, 
” “critical, 
” or “unclear.” 
7
Data on country, year of publication, 
study design, vaccine(s), population, 
duration of follow-up, and AEFI 
recurrence were extracted from 
the articles that met eligibility 
criteria and were entered into a 
spreadsheet. Risk of AEFI recurrence

 was calculated as follows: the 
number of patients with recurrence 
divided by the total number of 
patients reimmunized. Owing to the 
differences between the studies, a 
DerSimonian and Laird random-
effects approach was used for the 
pooled estimates. The variances of 
the risks estimated in the individual 
studies were stabilized with the 
Freeman-Tukey transformation 
before pooling.8 Heterogeneity was 
assessed by using the I2 statistics, 
interpreted as low (0%–40%), 
moderate (30%–60%), substantial 
(50%–90%), and considerable  
(75%–100%) heterogeneity.9 
Subgroup analyses per vaccine dose 
number and type (eg, whole-cell or 
acellular pertussis) were conducted 
to explore clinical heterogeneity.
We compared the occurrence 
of adverse events following 
reimmunization in various subgroups, 
including vaccine recipients with a 
history of AEFI versus those without, 
type of vaccine administered, 
and severity of the initial AEFI. 
Comparisons were performed by 
using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs), 2-tailed 
χ2 tests, or Fisher’s exact tests with 
statistical significance defined as P < 
.05. Pooled analyses were performed 
with Stata version 13.0 and the 
remaining with SAS, version 9.3.
ResULTs
Among the 3883 articles retrieved,  
29 met the inclusion criteria, 6 of 
which (20%) were identified from  
the reference lists of other articles  
(Fig 1).5, 
 
10 
–37 The articles were 
published between 1982 and 2016. 
Most (n = 27, 93%) studies were 
observational, 
5, 
 
10 
– 
24, 
 
27 
– 
37 and 14 
(48%) were prospective (Table 2). 
In the various studies, AEFIs were 
collected through patient and/or 
parental reports (n = 12), physician 
report or patient and/or parental 
report (n = 7), hospital records  
and/or chart review (n = 7), passive 
surveillance database (n = 2),  
or physician report (n = 1) (Table 2).  
Most studies included only children 
aged <18 years (n = 18, 62%), of 
which 12 (67%) studies included  
only children ≤6 years. The  
remaining studies included adults 
aged 18 years or older (n = 3, 10%) or 
both children and adults (n = 8,  
28%). All studies included both 
sexes, except for 2 studies in which 
researchers described adverse events 
following human papilloma virus 
(HPV) immunization in girls.14, 
 
30 
Researchers evaluated the recurrence 
risk of the following AEFIs: allergic-
like events (ALEs) (n = 13), hypotonic 
hyporesponsive episodes (HHEs) 
(n = 7), fever (n = 5), extensive limb 
swelling (ELS) (n = 3), seizures (n = 3), 
pain (n = 3), apnea (n = 2), decreased 
appetite (n = 2), persistent crying  
(n = 2), drowsiness (n = 2), vomiting 
(n = 2), and Henoch-Schonlein 
purpura (n = 1). Typically, several 
vaccines or adverse events were 
evaluated in the same study; 
researchers in 9 studies assessed the 
risk of recurrence of 1 specific AEFI 
(fever, apnea, ELS, oculorespiratory 
syndrome [ORS], ALE, or HHE) after 
administration of 1 or several vaccines 
(Table 2). Among the studies in which 
researchers assessed vaccine-specific 
risks of AEFI recurrence, the most 
frequently studied vaccines were the 
diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis 
vaccine (full-antigen, DTaP or 
reduced-antigen, dTap formulations) 
or diphtheria-tetanus whole-cell 
pertussis vaccine (DTwP) (n = 12), 
followed by inactivated influenza 
vaccine (IIV) (n = 6), HPV vaccine 
(n = 2), diphtheria-tetanus toxoids 
vaccine (DT) (n = 1), and New Zealand 
meningococcal B vaccine (n = 1).
Overall, the risk of bias in the 
individual studies was rated as low in 
8 (28%) of the studies, moderate in 15 
(52%), and serious in 6 (21%) (Fig 2).
ALes
Allergic-like signs and symptoms 
can be caused by a variety of 
conditions. Three of these conditions 
were described in the studies 
retrieved: ALEs, anaphylaxis, and 
ORS. ORS is a non–immunoglobin 
E–mediated adverse event that 
typically starts 2 to 24 hours after 
influenza immunization and often 
affects 2 systems, causing bilateral 
conjunctivitis, facial edema, and 
upper respiratory signs and 
symptoms (cough, sore throat, 
hoarseness, dyspnea, chest tightness, 
and lingual and/or pharyngeal 
edema).38
Researchers in 8 studies described 
reimmunization of patients 
with a history of ALEs after 
immunization.16 
–20, 
 
22, 
 
30, 
 
37 Before 
reimmunization, all patients 
underwent a clinical evaluation 
(description of the ALE and 
medical history) by a specialist (an 
allergist, pediatrician, or emergency 
physician), with or without skin 
testing with the vaccine. Overall, 
594 children and adults were 
reimmunized at a hospital or clinic: 
148 were reimmunized with a single 
full dose, 59 received 2 graded 
doses, and for 389 patients, the 
reimmunization protocol was not 
described. However, for 373 (96%) of 
these patients, the authors specified 
that individualized precautions (eg, 
premedication, temporally separated 
single injections, and alternative 
brand and/or administration in 
a hospital as a single dose or 4 
graded doses) were applied when 
deemed necessary. Among the 
594 patients reimmunized, ALEs 
recurred in 30 (5% [95% CI, 3.3 to 
6.8]), none of whom experienced 
anaphylaxis. All recurrences were 
mild and self-limited except for 1 
female child with severe food and 
respiratory allergies who developed 
urticaria and bronchospasm after 
being reimmunized with measles-
mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Her 
symptoms subsided immediately 
after treatment. The risk of 
recurrence of ALEs was higher in 1 
study based on the German passive

 surveillance system17 (61.5%, 8 of 
13) than in the 7 hospital- or clinic-
based studies (3.8%, 22 of 581,  
P < .0001).
Researchers in 2 studies evaluated 
the risk of recurrence of anaphylaxis 
in 133 patients receiving various 
vaccines16, 
 
21 (Table 3). All but 1 had 
negative skin testing with the vaccine. 
Ninety-five (71%) were reimmunized 
with a single dose, and 38 (29%) were 
reimmunized with 3 graded doses 
(10%, 30%, and 60% of the total dose 
at 1-hour intervals). No anaphylaxis or 
ALEs occurred after reimmunization.
The risk of recurrence of ORS after 
immunization only with IIV was 
evaluated in 4 studies.23 
– 
26 The 
risk of recurrence estimated by 
the 2 randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs)25, 
 
26 was higher than that 
estimated by researchers in the 2 
retrospective studies23, 
 
24 (67 of 180 = 
37% vs 48 of 488 = 10%, P < .001). 
The estimated risk of recurrence 
varied from year to year depending 
on the manufacturer of the vaccine 
but was not influenced by age, 
sex, number of previous influenza 
vaccine doses, or the severity of 
the previous ORS episode. Patients 
with a history of ORS were 3.3 to 4 
times more likely to develop ORS 
compared with vaccine recipients 
without such history. In the study 
by Skowronski et al, 
24 4 of 6 
patients described their recurrence 
as milder, and the remaining 2 
considered their recurrence as 
being of the same severity as the 
first episode. Recurrences did not 
dissuade patients from continuing 
immunization.
Injection site Reactions
Three types of injection site reactions 
were assessed: ELS, pain, and redness 
and/or swelling at the injection site. In 
3 studies, 55 of 98 (56% [95% CI, 9.8 
to 46.3]) children with ELS after the 
fourth dose of DTaP had a recurrence 
after the fifth dose (DTaP/ reduced-
antigen diphtheria-tetanus-acellular 
pertussis vaccine [dTap]).5, 
 
9, 
 
10 Among 
the 55 children who had a recurrence, 
none had fever >38.5°C. The injected 
arm was spontaneously painful 
(without touch or movement) in 3 
subjects, and symptoms were severe 
enough to prevent daily activities in 
3 patients. In the study conducted by 
Quinn et al, 
12 64% of patients reported 
spontaneous resolution of the ELS 
within 4 days of immunization. All 
55 children recovered completely 
within 19 days of immunization. In 
2 studies, children were reimmunized 
with either the full- (DTaP) or reduced-
antigen (dTap) vaccine.12, 
 
14 The risk 
of recurrence of swelling was 1.5-fold 
higher when using DTaP (31 of 40, 
78%) compared with dTap (20 of 38, 
53%) P = .02. After reimmunization, 
patients in both the DTaP and dTap

Pain at the injection site was 
evaluated in 3 studies.10, 
 
15, 
 
28 
Moderate to severe pain recurred 
more frequently in children 
reimmunized with whole-cell 
pertussis vaccines (DTwP2: 36% 
[95% CI, 26.1 to 45.4]; DTwP3: 
35% [95% CI, 23.1 to 46.7]) than 
acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP2: 
12% [95% CI, 4.2 to 20]; DTaP3: 9% 
[95% CI, −0.7 to 18.9]). A history 
of moderate to severe pain at the 
previous immunization increased 
the risk of having it again at the next 
immunization, especially in patients 
receiving acellular pertussis vaccine 
(RR: 6.3 [95% CI, 3.4 to 11.5] for 
DTaP and 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2 to 4.0] for 
DTwP) (Table 4).
Analysis of redness and swelling  
at the injection site by Baraff et al10 
showed that the risk of recurrence 
was inversely proportional to the size 
of the initial reaction (Table 3).
Apnea
The risk of recurrence of apnea was 
evaluated in 2 studies.34,

first study, Flatz-Jequier et al35

Downloaded from 
 preterm infants (mean birth weight 
of 886 g, gestational age <32 weeks) 
during their first 3 immunizations  
at 2, 3, and 4 months of age,  
whereas Clifford et al34 monitored  
30 preterm (gestational age <37 
weeks) and 8 term (gestational  
age ≥37 weeks) infants during their 
first 4 immunizations at 2, 4, 6, 
and 12 months of age. At the first, 
second, and third immunizations, 
all infants received DTaP–injectable 
polio vaccine (IPV)–Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib)–hepatitis B 
(HepB) and pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines, and some additionally 
received rotavirus vaccine, influenza 
vaccine, and respiratory syncytial 
virus monoclonal antibody. At 
the fourth immunization, infants 
received MMR vaccine, Hib, and 
meningococcal C vaccines. At the 
second immunization, 13 (18% [95% 
CI, 9.3 to 27.3]) of 71 preterm infants 
had a recurrence of apnea that was  
as severe as the initial episode  
(Table 3). No recurrences of apnea 
occurred among the 8 term infants  
(4 had underlying conditions, 
including metabolic disorder, cardiac 
disease, probable viral meningitis, 
and multiple allergies). Five of the  
13 children with recurrences 
received subsequent immunizations, 
and none experienced additional 
episodes of apnea. Clifford et al34  
identified 2 predictors of recurrent 
apnea: lower birth weight and 
ongoing hospitalization for 
complications related to prematurity. 
A 10-g increase in birth weight was 
associated with a 6% reduction in the 
odds of recurrent apnea (odds ratio 
0.94 [95% CI, 0.89 to 1.00]). The odds 
of recurrence were 23 times higher in 
infants hospitalized for complications 
related to prematurity (odds ratio 23 
[95% CI, 2 to 272]).

The 6 studies in which researchers

children, of whom 3 (0.8% [95%

the 4 studies in which researchers 
specifically identified the risk of 
HHE recurrence after DTaP or 
DTwP vaccines, only 1 of the 306 
reimmunized children experienced  
a recurrence (0.3% [95% CI, 0 to

recurrence of fever after the second 
dose (vaccine recipients aged 4 
months) or third dose (vaccine 
recipients aged 6 months) ranged 
from 33% to 64%.10, 
 
15, 
 
28 The risk was 
highest after the fourth dose (84%)28 
(Table 3). Fever was also more likely 
to occur among children with a 
history of fever after a previous dose 
versus children without previous 
fever (pooled RR 1.9 [95% CI, 1.6 to 
2.2] Table 4). In the study by Baraff 
et al, 
10 the severity of initial fever 
(<39°C vs ≥39°C) had no impact on 
the risk of recurrence.
For DTaP vaccine, the risk of 
recurrence of fever was estimated at 
21% and 18% after the second and 
third doses, respectively. Fever was 
more likely to occur among children 
with a history of fever after the 
previous dose compared with those 
without previous fever (RRs of 4.7 
[95% CI, 2.3 to 9.9] and 2.6 [95% CI, 
1.6 to 4.4] after DTaP2 and DTaP3, 
respectively) (Table 4). In the study 
by Deloria et al, 
11 recurrence of fever 
was higher among DTwP recipients 
compared with DTaP recipients after 
dose 3 (RR: 2.1 [95% CI, 1.2 to 3.7]) 
but not dose 2 (RR: 1.5 [95% CI, 0.7

of whom 3 received 1 additional dose 
and 3 received 2 additional doses. 
Among the 6 reimmunized children, 
1 presented with mild self-limited 
proteinuria after the second dose. 
He received his third vaccine dose 
without further events.
seizures
Researchers in 3 studies evaluated 
the risk of recurrence of seizures 
after immunization.19, 
 
30, 
 
33 Nicolosi 
et al19 and Gold et al30 evaluated the 
risk of seizures after various vaccines 
(hepatitis A or B, meningococcal 
vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, 
and MMR; DTaP with or without Hib, 
HepB, and poliomyelitis antigens 
[DTaP±Hib/HepB/IPV]); none 
of the 52 children reimmunized 
between 1 month and 16 years of 
age had a recurrence (Table 3). In 
the third study, Crawford et al33 
reported no recurrences of syncopal 
seizures among 8 girls aged 8 to 
26 years who were reimmunized 
in the supine position with HPV 
vaccine. The authors of the studies 
described above did not specify if any 
additional measures (eg, antipyretics 
or anticonvulsants) were taken to 
reduce recurrence of seizures.
other AeFIs
Overall, vomiting, persistent crying, 
decreased appetite, and drowsiness 
recurred in 15%, 24%, 25%, and 
35% of the reimmunized patients, 
respectively (Table 3).
Pooled estimates
For most AEFIs, pooled estimates 
displayed substantial heterogeneity 
(I2 > 80%, Tables 3 and 4) that 
remained high in all subgroup 
analyses (data not presented).
dIscUssIon
In this review of 29 studies presenting 
the outcome of reimmunization of 
patients who experienced AEFIs, it 
appears that the risk of recurrence of 
serious AEFIs (anaphylaxis, seizures, 
or apnea in term infants) was low 
(<1%). For minor to moderate AEFIs 
(fever, ELS, ORS, ALEs, sleepiness, 
thrombocytopenia, decreased 
appetite, vomiting, or persistent 
crying), the risk of recurrence ranged 
from 4% to 48%, and recurrences 
were generally less severe or equally 
severe compared with the initial 
episode.
Researchers in 7 of 8 studies reported 
a low risk of recurrence of ALEs. 
The high risk of recurrence (62%) 
observed by Zent et al20 may be 
explained by a reporting bias related 
to professionals being more likely 
to report severe or recurrent cases 
to the passive surveillance system 
of the German Pharmacovigilance 
Department, thus leading to an 
overestimation of the risk of 
recurrence. None of the 727 patients 
with a history of ALE or anaphylaxis 
in the included studies developed 
anaphylaxis after reimmunization. 
This finding supports the Joint Task 
Force on Practice Parameters 2012 
practice guidelines, which state that 
patients who experienced an ALE 
after immunization can be safely 
reimmunized when appropriate 
precautions are taken.39 However, 
these findings may not apply to 
patients with severe ALEs or positive 
skin tests because they were often 
not reimmunized in the studies 
reviewed. There was great variability 
in the management of patients with 
an ALE after immunization. Seitz 
et al21 reimmunized patients with 
graded doses despite negative skin 
testing to the vaccine, suggesting that 
the ALE was not an immunoglobulin 
E–mediated reaction. There may 
be a need for guidelines39– 
41 to 
be evaluated and validated to 
standardize practices.
Approximately half of children with 
ELS after the fourth dose of DTaP had 
a recurrence at reimmunization, but 
few patients with recurrent events 
developed systemic signs, symptoms, 
or an altered general state, and all 
cases resolved without sequelae. 
ELS reactions after immunization 
are dramatic but usually painless. 
Parents should be reassured that 
these reactions are usually benign 
and should not prevent subsequent 
immunizations that will protect their 
children against severe diseases. 
There was no study in which 
researchers directly compared the 
risk of ELS among children with 
and without a past history of ELS, 
but recurrences appear to occur 
more frequently than the expected 
background frequency of 2% to 5% 
among children 4 to 6 years of age.42, 
 
43 
Vaccines with lower diphtheria and 
pertussis antigens content (dTap and 
dTap-IPV), which confer protective 
immunity while reducing the risk of 
occurrence and/or recurrence of ELS, 
should be recommended in these 
patients.12, 
 
14, 
42 
– 
46
Recurrence of moderate to severe pain 
at the injection site varied with the 
type of vaccine. Whereas the absolute 
risk of pain was higher with DTwP 
(35%–36%) compared with DTaP 
(9%–12%), the relative risk comparing 
patients with versus without a 
previous event was higher in DTaP 
recipients (RR: 4.6 to 7.7 for DTaP and 
3 for DTwP). Physical interventions 
(eg, no aspiration, simultaneous 
injections, or injection in the buttock) 
and psychological interventions (eg, 
verbal, video, or music distraction) 
should be considered to reduce the 
severity or perception of pain.47

 higher risk of developing fever 
after subsequent immunizations, 
especially with DTaP (RR 2.6 to 4.7 
for DTaP versus RR 1.5 to 1.8 for 
DTwP).10, 
 
15, 
 
28 For both vaccines, 
the risk of recurrence of fever after 
dose 2 and 3 was similar within each 
study.10, 
15, 
 
28 One study revealed 
an increased risk of recurrence 
after DTwP dose 4, 
28 but we could 
not evaluate if the difference was 
statistically significant because the 
number of patients reimmunized 
was not reported. Severe fevers 
(≥39°C and ≥40°C) did not recur, 
and recurrent febrile episodes 
were usually milder than the initial 
episode. Prophylactic antipyretics 
or reduced-antigen formulation 
vaccine (ie, dTap) can be used to 
reduce either the occurrence or 
the severity of fever, 
51 
–53 but their 
effect on recurrence is still to be 
evaluated. Both measures have been 
associated with a decreased vaccine 
immunogenicity response, and this 
should be taken into consideration in 
the risk/benefit evaluation.44, 
 
45, 
 
53, 
 
54
In this review, researchers reported 
a risk of recurrence after DTaP ±Hib/
HepB/IPV and DTwP vaccines of <0.8%  
in all the studies that included patients 
with HHE.5, 
 
29, 
 
31, 
 
32 However, the risk of 
recurrence after DTwP combined with 
Hib, injectable poliomyelitis, or HepB 
antigens, which is currently used in 
low- and middle-income countries, 
was not evaluated.
This systematic review has 
limitations. Although every effort 
was made to ensure a comprehensive 
search, some articles may have been 
missed. Our search was limited to 
articles published in English or French 
and did not include the gray literature. 
Despite the large number of AEFIs 
targeted in our search, we did not 
find any studies with 5 individuals 
or more that estimated the risk of 
recurrence of several AEFIs. Studies 
on the recurrence of serious or rare 
AEFIs are unlikely to be conducted 
for ethical reasons (risk of death or 
permanent sequelae) or feasibility 
(too few patients). All studies were 
conducted in developed countries; 
a different pattern of the risk of 
recurrence might be observed in low- 
and middle-income countries because 
of differences in vaccine products, 
schedules, or ethnicities. Only 2 of 
the 29 studies reviewed were RCTs. 
AEFI case definitions, study design, 
age groups, and targeted vaccines 
varied from one study to another, 
which limited the comparability of 
results. As a result of these clinical 
and methodological differences, most 
of the pooled estimates displayed 
substantial heterogeneity and should 
be considered with caution. Most 
study participants were children; 
adults and especially the elderly 
may have different recurrence risks. 
With severe cases being less often 
reimmunized, the risk of recurrence 
may have been underestimated. 
The number of patients per AEFI 
was frequently small, leading to 
estimates with broad CIs and limited 
statistical power to detect a small 
risk of recurrence. The largest 
studies (including >500 vaccine 
recipients with and without a history 
of an AEFI) were performed before 
1995. The paucity of recent large 
studies is all the more regrettable 
given that most vaccines currently 
in use were introduced after 1995 
and underwent large pre- and 
postlicensure safety evaluations. To 
guide clinicians, prelicensure clinical 
RCTs should report not only the risk 
of occurrence of AEFI but also the 
risk of recurrence when the vaccine 
requires several doses. In a context 
of vaccine hesitancy and growing 
concerns regarding vaccine safety, 
evaluating the risk of recurrence of 
all AEFIs should become part of the 
standard evaluation of vaccine safety. 
Specialized immunization networks 
such as the Clinical Immunization 
Safety Assessment (United States), 
the Surveillance of Adverse Events 
Following Vaccination In the 
Community (Australia), and the 
Specialized Immunization Clinics 
(Canada) are ideal platforms for 
the continuous and prospective 
evaluation of AEFI recurrence.
concLUsIons
Despite vaccines being administered to 
millions of people annually, few studies 
have been conducted by researchers 
seeking to evaluate the risk of AEFI 
recurrence. Based on the published 
literature, reimmunization appears 
to be safe for patients with mild to 
moderate AEFIs. However, the data are 
insufficient to draw firm conclusions 
regarding the safety of reimmunization 
after a severe AEFI. High-quality 
studies by researchers estimating the 
vaccine-specific risk of recurrence 
and predictors of recurrence for each 
AEFI are needed to inform evidence-
based immunization practices in this 
population.
