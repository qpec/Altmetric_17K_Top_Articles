introduction: Since the first live birth from oocyte cryopreservation three decades ago, oocyte cryopreservation has become an
important component of ART. Cryopreservation techniques have evolved, leading to higher success rates and the introduction of oocyte
cryopreservation into IVF clinics worldwide. Concurrently, there has been an increase in patient demand, especially for so-called ‘social egg
freezing’ that allows women to preserve their fertility in anticipation of age-related fertility decline. This review addresses a need to evaluate
the current status of oocyte cryopreservation. It explores current techniques and success rates, clinical applications, the rise of elective
oocyte cryopreservation, and future implications.

 conclusion: Oocyte cryopreservation is an established component of ART, with vitrification now being the cryopreservation technique of
choice. Increasing numbers of women undergo oocyte cryopreservation for both medical and social reasons. It is important to continue auditing
outcomes and reporting long-term follow-up of children born from frozen–thawed oocytes.
Key words: oocyte cryopreservation / oocyte vitrification / fertility preservation / egg freezing / ART
Introduction
The scope of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has widened
greatly since the birth of Louise Brown in 1978 (Steptoe and Edwards,
1978). Both embryo and sperm cryopreservation are well-established
procedures, but it was not until relatively recently that oocyte cryo-
preservation has become available as an additional fertility preservation
option for women. Significantly, oocyte cryopreservation challenges the
ethical, legal and religious concerns surrounding embryo cryopreserva-
tion, making it preferable in many situations.
Since the first birth from a frozen oocyte was achieved in Australia
in 1986 (Chen, 1986), many advances have been made in the field.
Research has been accelerated because of legal restrictions and ethical
concerns relating to embryo storage. Now, improved techniques and
success rates have led to the application of oocyte cryopreservation
for many different indications, including age-related fertility decline.
Methods
This literature review will discuss the current status of oocyte cryopreserva-
tion, considering its history, clinical indications, and the efficacy of techniques.

A history of oocyte
cryopreservation
Successful pregnancies from frozen oocytes were first achieved in the late
1980s, using slow-freeze and rapid-thaw cryopreservation techniques
(Chen, 1986, 1988; Van Uem et al., 1987). However, there was a lack
of progress in the field owing to technical concerns and low success
rates (Bernard and Fuller, 1996). Oocytes are notoriously difficult cells
tocryopreserve,duetotheirlowsurfaceareatovolumeratioandhighsus-
ceptibility to intracellular ice formation (Paynter et al., 1999). Early papers
highlighted difficulties in predicting the membrane permeability character-
istics of human oocytes along with other biophysical parameters (Fuller
et al., 1992; Hunter et al., 1992a, b). Studies also revealed the negative
effects of cryopreservation on the stability of microtubules and microfila-
ments in mammalian oocytes (Pickering and Johnson, 1987; Sathananthan
et al., 1988; Vincent et al., 1989; Pickering et al., 1990; Joly et al., 1992),
which are vital for normal chromosomal segregation (Glenister et al.,
1987). Hardening of the zona pellucida, and subsequent low fertilization
rates, were further difficulties associated with cryopreservation (Johnson
et al., 1988; Vincent et al., 1990). Later papers produced more promising
results, suggesting that human oocytes had the potential to retain their
morphology and chromosomal integrity post cryopreservation (Gook
et al., 1994; Van Blerkom and Davis, 1994). However, a reliable protocol
for the clinical cryopreservation of oocytes was still lacking.
Research into oocyte cryopreservation was accelerated by legislative
restrictions surrounding the storage of embryos, particularly those in
Italy that prevented the cryopreservation of excess embryos (Benagiano
and Gianaroli, 2004). The introduction of vitrification as an alternative to
slow freezing reduced damage to internal structures and led to superior
success rates (Antinori et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2009; Fadini et al., 2009;
Smith et al., 2010). Further, the use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI) as an insemination method for vitrified oocytes was found to
rectify fertilization issues due to zona pellucida hardening (Kazem et al.,
1995; Porcu et al., 1997; Fabbri et al., 1998).
TheHumanFertilisationandEmbryologyAuthority(HFEA)hasallowed
the use of frozen oocytes for infertility treatment in the UK since 2000
(Wise, 2000). HFEA regulations allow the storage of gametes for a stand-
ard 10-year period, which can be extended under certain circumstances
(HFEA, 2015). In 2013, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine
(ASRM) lifted the experimental label applied to oocyte freezing, following
four randomized controlled trials (Cobo et al., 2008, 2010a, Rienzi et al.,
2010; Parmegiani et al., 2011) that suggested that in-vitro fertilization
(IVF) using vitrified/warmed oocytes could produce similar fertilization
and pregnancy rates to IVF with fresh oocytes (ASRM, 2013). This has
prompted the introduction of oocyte cryopreservation into a growing
number of IVF clinics worldwide.
Cryopreservation techniques
Cryopreservation involves the preservation of cells and tissues for
extended periods of time at sub-zero temperatures. Cryoprotective
additives (CPAs) are used in order to reduce cryodamage by preventing
ice formation. They are classified into permeating or non-permeating
CPAs, depending on their ability to cross the cell membrane. Various
combinations of permeating (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol,
1,2 propanediol (PrOH)) and non-permeating (e.g. sucrose, glucose,
fructose, trehalose) CPAs can be used.
There are two basic techniques applied to the cryopreservation of
human oocytes: controlled slow freezing, which was favoured in early
protocols, and ultrarapid cooling by vitrification, which is now well-
established. Slow freezing results in a liquid changing to a solid state
whereas vitrification results in a non-crystalline amorphous solid.
Duringslowfreezing,cellsareexposedtoalowconcentrationofCPAs
and slow decreases in temperature. Oocytes are first cooled to a tem-
perature of 258C to 278C, at which equilibration and seeding take
place. Oocytes are then cooled at a slow rate of 0.3–0.58C/minute,
until a temperature of between 2308C and 2658C has been reached,
before being added to liquid nitrogen for storage (Saragusty and Arav,
2011). Multiple studies have demonstrated success using slow freeze
techniques to cryopreserve oocytes (Porcu et al., 1997; Tucker et al.,
1998; Fabbri et al., 2001; Winslow et al., 2001; Boldt et al., 2003;
Borini et al., 2004; Bianchi et al., 2007; Grifo and Noyes, 2010). Although
various alterationsto slowfreeze protocols (e.g. Boldt et al., 2006; Borini

 et al., 2006) have contributed to higher success rates, there are still con-
cerns surrounding the clinical efficiency of this technique. Comparisons
between success rates using slow frozen and fresh human oocytes
have suggested poorer outcomes with frozen/thawed oocytes (Levi
Setti et al., 2006; Borini et al., 2010; Magli et al., 2010).
VitrificationrequireshigherconcentrationsofCPAs,loweringtheriskof
icenucleationandcrystallization,andcoolingratesof100sto10 0008Cper
minutebefore submersionintoliquid nitrogen(SaragustyandArav,2011).
The first live birth following vitrification was achieved in 1999 (Kuleshova
et al., 1999), whilst Kuwayama et al. developed the widely used
‘Cryotop’ vitrification method in 2005 (Kuwayama et al., 2005).
There are two main classes of vitrification protocol: open and closed
vitrification. Open vitrification involves direct contact between oocytes
and liquid nitrogen, using low volume devices such as capillary glasses,
cooper devices, pulled straws, and loops (Glujovsky et al., 2014). In
contrast, closed vitrification involves indirect contact between oocytes
and liquid nitrogen using tubing systems (Glujovsky et al., 2014).
Open versus closed vitrification
The randomized controlled trials supporting similar success rates
between IVF with vitrified/warmed oocytes and IVF with fresh oocytes
(Cobo et al., 2008, 2010a; Rienzi et al., 2010; Parmegiani et al., 2011)
have all used open vitrification systems. Despite their proven proficiency,
concernshave beenraisedover thesterilityofopensystemsdueto poten-
tial cross-contamination between the vitrification sample and liquid nitro-
gen. Accordingly, studies have highlighted the potential of liquid nitrogen
sterilization using ultraviolet light (Parmegiani et al., 2010) or oocyte
storage in vapour phase liquid nitrogen, which contains a lower density
of environmental airborne contaminants (Cobo et al., 2010b).
Theintroductionofclosedvitrificationhasofferedasolutiontocontam-
inationconcerns(Vajtaetal.,2015).Afterexposuretocontaminatedliquid
nitrogen,Criado etal. (2011)foundthatclosed deviceswerebacteriafree,
whereas bacteria were present in 45% of open devices. However, the use
of closed systems raises new concerns about the efficiency of oocyte vit-
rification, due to their decreased cooling rates. One study suggested that
the use of closed vitrification might not preserve the oocyte ultrastructure
aswellasin open systems(Bonetti etal., 2011). Another study, comparing
an open and closed vitrification system, found reduced fertilization, cleav-
age, and clinical pregnancy rates in the latter (Paffoni et al., 2011).
Contrarily,otherstudieshavesuggestthatclosedvitrificationcanleadto
excellent clinical outcomes whilst also providing an aseptic environment
(Smithetal.,2010;Stoopetal.,2012;Papatheodorouetal.,2013).Across-
section of UK clinics in 2011 suggested that 75% used closed containers
rather than open containers for vitrification (Brison et al., 2012). Which-
ever vitrification protocol is favoured, it is important to consider the
warming rate. Observations have indicated that the warming rate is, in
fact,moreimportantthanthecoolingrateforoocytesurvivalinvitrification
protocols (Seki and Mazur, 2009; Leibo and Pool, 2011; Mazur and Seki,
2011). It has also been noted that optimal outcomes are more likely to
be achieved if vitrification and warming are carried out in the same clinic
or by matched protocols (Brison et al., 2012).
The trend towards vitrification
Studies in the past few years have suggested the superiority of vitrification
compared to slow freeze protocols. In 2006, a meta-analysis of oocyte
cryopreservation implied that pregnancy rates with cryopreserved
oocytes could be improved with the use of vitrification, although at this
point few pregnancies had been recorded (Oktay et al., 2006). Subse-
quently, comparisons of IVF outcomes from slow-frozen and vitrified
oocytes have demonstrated that vitrificationleadsto bettersurvival, fertil-
ization, and pregnancy rates (Cao et al., 2009; Fadini et al., 2009; Smith
et al., 2010), although only Fadini et al. (2009) reported pregnancy rates
that were significantly higher (18.2 versus 7.6%). Increasing evidence on
the efficacy of IVF with vitrified oocytes has suggested that it could
achieve similar outcomes to IVF using fresh oocytes, with oocyte survival
rates of over 84% (Nagy et al., 2009; Almodin et al., 2010; Ubaldi et al.,
2010; Rienzi et al., 2012). Whereas in 1999, close to 100 cryopreserved
oocytes were needed to achieve one pregnancy (Porcu et al., 1999),
now only 20 vitrified oocytes are required (Donnez and Dolmans,
2013), although this is highly dependent on the age of the oocyte (Cobo
et al., 2015a,b).Randomized controlled trialshave produced clinicalpreg-
nancy rates (CPRs) per transfer ranging between 35.5 and 65.2% (Cobo
et al., 2008, 2010a; Rienzi et al., 2010; Parmegiani et al., 2011). A recent
meta-analysis of five studies found that the rates of fertilization, embryo
cleavage, high quality embryos and ongoing pregnancy did not differ
between vitrification and fresh oocyte groups (Cobo and Diaz, 2011).
Many IVF programmes now favour vitrification as a technique to cryo-
preserveoocytes (Rudick et al., 2010; Brison et al., 2012; Glujovskyet al.,
2014), and a 2013 update to the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guidelines states: ‘In cryopreservation of oocytes and
embryos, use vitrification instead of controlled-rate freezing if the neces-
sary equipment and expertise is available’ (NICE, 2013).
Outcomes of oocyte
cryopreservation
Studies have considered the longer term obstetric and perinatal out-
comes associated with vitrification. An analysis of 165 pregnancies and
200 infants found that the mean birthweight and incidence of congenital
abnormalities (2.5%) were similar in infants born following oocyte vitrifi-
cation to those born from spontaneous conceptions or through regular
IVF (Chian et al., 2008). Another review of 936 infants, born following
either slow freezing or vitrification of oocytes, also found a comparable
incidence of congenital abnormalities (1.3%) (Noyes et al., 2009).
Cobo et al. (2014) have reported that vitrification does not increase
adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. No long-term follow-up of
these children has yet been published.
Despite the reassurances surrounding the efficacy and safety of oocyte
cryopreservation, it is important to continue auditing the data whilst the
number of cycles increases worldwide. Fresh concerns were highlighted
in a recent review that compared outcomes of fresh and cryopreserved
donation cycles in the USA in 2013. Live birth rates per recipient cycle
were found to be significantly lower when cryopreserved oocytes were
used (43.3 versus 49.6%) (Kushnir et al., 2015). However, it must be
emphasized that this study did not adjust for important confounding
factors such as donor and recipient ages or cryopreservation protocols.
Clinical applications of oocyte
cryopreservation
Whilst the technique was initially reserved for women with medical indi-
cations who had no other fertility options (European Society of Human
Argyle et al.

 Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) Task Force on Ethics and Law,
2004; ASRM, 2008), oocyte cryopreservation now plays a role in many
different circumstances. Perhaps most notable is the introduction of
‘social egg freezing’, as a means to preserve fertility in anticipation
of age-related fertility decline (Baldwin et al., 2014; Stoop et al., 2014).
Other applications of oocyte cryopreservation include donation pro-
grammes and storage of ‘spare’ gametes during IVF.
In the UK, the HFEA reports that up to 2012, around 18 000 oocytes
have been stored for the patients’ own use, while 160 thawing/warming
cycleshavebeenperformed,resultingin20livebirths.Alargeproportion
of IVF centres worldwide offer ‘social egg freezing’.
Oocyte versus embryo
cryopreservation
Embryo cryopreservation is an established ART technique with many
advantages. The ability to store surplus embryos can reduce the number
of embryos transferred during a fresh cycle and thus minimize the risk of
multiple pregnancy, reduce the need for repeated stimulation cycles,
and increase cumulative pregnancy rates. However, embryo cryopreser-
vation is not an option for all couples, because of personal religious or
moral objections, or restrictive legislation in certain countries. Decisions
over the fate of stored embryos can also lead to major disagreements or
legal disputes, particularly in the case of divorce or separation (Pennings,
2000; Lee et al., 2006). Oocyte cryopreservation may be a feasible alter-
native to embryo cryopreservation for many couples undergoing IVF
(ASRM and Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, 2013).
There tends to be less moral sensitivity surrounding the storage and fate
of gametes, and since the genetic material originates from one individual,
there are fewer issues surrounding ownership.
Oocyte donation
Oocyte donation has become an integral part of ART. It was initially
accepted in the treatment of women with premature ovarian insuffi-
ciency (Kawwasset al., 2013). In recent years the demand for oocyte do-
nation has increased, as it has become a treatment option for large
numbers of women experiencing age-related infertility. Owing to the
careful selection of young and healthy oocyte donors, pregnancy rates
in donation cycles often surpass those achieved by conventional IVF
(Sauer and Kavic, 2006). However, traditional fresh donation cycles
present some difficulties (Cobo et al., 2011). One is the requirement
for menstrual cycle synchronization between donor and recipient, so
that oocytes can be collected and transferred within a certain time
frame. Another concern is the absence of proper quarantine measures
which are adhered to during sperm donation, using semen cryostorage
(Cobo et al., 2011). As the demand for oocytes increases (Kawwass
et al., 2013), recipient waiting times also lengthen. This is not helped
by the fact that in fresh donation cycles, all donor oocytes tend to be
allocated to a single recipient (Cobo et al., 2011).
The introduction of oocyte cryopreservation into donation pro-
grammes overcomes these challenges. It simplifies the logistics of ART
cycles as there is no need for menstrual cycle synchronization between
donor and recipient; it allows for the testing of donors for infectious dis-
eases during quarantine; and it potentially reduces cost through the effi-
cient allocation of oocytes from a pool of donors to many recipients
(Cobo et al., 2011). Oocyte cryopreservation has also led to the devel-
opment of donor oocyte banks, which allow recipients to review a list of
donors, and minimize waiting times (Cobo et al., 2011; Quaas et al.,
2013). As well as cryopreserved oocytes from individual donors,
surplus oocytes from infertile couples may be cryopreserved and subse-
quently donated, which proves particularly significant in countries where
embryo donation is not allowed (Li et al., 2005).
A growing proportion of donor oocyte cycles now utilize cryopre-
served oocytes (Kawwass et al., 2013). As of 2013, according to a
study in the USA, 3130oocytesfrom294 donors were in storage in com-
mercial oocyte banks. Six out of seven oocyte banks were using vitrifica-
tion rather than slow freezing and all were expanding their donor
databases (Quaas et al., 2013).
Oocyte donation programmes are particularly useful for auditing the
success of oocyte cryopreservation. The potential utility of cryostoring
oocytes for donation was demonstrated by preliminary results from a
donor oocyte bank that used slow freezing, achieving a pregnancy rate
of 50% per cycle (Akin et al., 2007), and a case series of four donor-
recipient cycles using slow freezing yielded a clinical pregnancy rate of
75% (Barritt et al., 2007). Nagy et al. (2009) compared the outcomes
of fresh and vitrified oocyte donation cycles using the same 20 donors;
the cumulative pregnancy rates were 78 and 85% respectively. Oocyte
donation cycles in paired patients receiving fresh or vitrified oocytes
from the same donor have led to similar ongoing pregnancy rates per
embryo transfer: fresh 43.9% versus vitrified 47.2% (Trokoudes et al.,
2011). Sole
´ et al. (2013) found comparable live birth rates (fresh,
38.4% versus vitrified, 43.4%, P . 0.05) in their study on sibling
oocytes from 99 donors. A larger randomized study compared
success rates in recipients of freshand vitrified oocytes; each group com-
prised 300 couples (Cobo et al., 2010a). Ongoing pregnancy rates were
41.7 and 43.7% in the fresh and vitrification groups, with an odds ratio of
0.921 (95% CI 0.667–1.274), showing no significant difference.
The largest reported series to date of oocyte recipients undergoing
treatment using vitrified donor oocytes (3610 warming procedures)
demonstrated an oocyte survival rate of 90%; it was not possible to
develop a predictive model for oocyte survival. The reported clinical
pregnancy rate of 48% represents an ‘oocyte-to-baby’ rate of 6.5%
(Cobo et al., 2015a).
Insummary,comparisonsoffreshandfrozencycleshavedemonstrated
the efficacy of oocyte ‘cryobanking’; satisfactory pregnancy rates are
achieved, and oocyte donation programmes are increasingly relying on
vitrified oocytes. Of course, new ethical concerns have been raised by
the development of commercial oocyte banks and the ease with which
oocytes can be shipped between countries with varying or inadequate
regulation, (Quaas et al., 2013). However, with careful management,
oocyte banks may change the dynamic of oocyte donation for the better.
Fertility preservation in cancer
patients
Cancer treatment regimes can have a detrimental effect on female fertil-
ity, due to the removal of reproductive organs or the use of radiation
therapyandcytotoxicagents.Theextentofdamagedependsonfollicular
reserve, patient age, and the type and dose of treatment, with alkylating
agents being particularly gonadotoxic (Knopman et al., 2010b; Fleischer
et al., 2011).
Oocyte cryopreservation

 Around 10% of cancers occur in women under the age of 45 (Donnez
and Dolmans, 2013), and the demand for fertility preservation amongst
these patients has increased with improving cancer survival rates
(Fleischer et al., 2011; Noyes et al., 2011). Embryo cryopreservation
has been an option for some time (Ethics Committee of the ASRM,
2005; Lobo, 2005; Lee et al., 2006; Kim, 2006), but has disadvantages
as explained above, with the risk of dispute if couples separate. It is
also not appropriate for single women or young patients without a
stable partner (Noyes et al., 2011).
Advances in oocyte cryopreservation mean that it can now be
offered routinely for fertility preservation. In a study of 108 breast
cancer patients undergoing fertility preservation treatment between
2005 and 2010, 16.7% opted for oocyte cryopreservation (Kim et al.,
2012). In another study, 71.6% of cancer patients enquiring about fer-
tility preservation underwent oocyte cryopreservation (Garcia-
Velasco et al., 2013). At present, there are few reports of cancer
patients returning to use their oocytes, but successful live births have
been achieved (Martinez et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2011b; Garcia-Velasco
et al., 2013).
The disadvantage of cryopreserving mature, metaphase II (MII),
oocytes in cancer patients is the need for ovarian stimulation. This can
delay cancer treatment by several weeks, and may carry particular risk
for those patients with a hormone receptive cancer (Kim et al., 2011a).
These problems can be reduced by the introduction of ‘anytime start’
protocols (Cakmak et al., 2013), to reduce delay, and the use of anti-
estrogens during stimulation for women with breast cancer (Reddy and
Oktay, 2012). Alternatives include the cryopreservation of oocytes at
thegerminalvesicle(GV)stage(Tothetal.,1994)orretrievalofimmature
oocytes followed by in-vitro maturation (IVM) (Rao et al., 2004; Huang
et al., 2008; Oktay et al., 2010), neither of which require ovarian
stimulation.
Analternativetooocytecryopreservation,whichdoesnotdelaycancer
treatment, isovariantissue banking. Anovariancortical biopsyoroophor-
ectomy isperformedasa day-casesurgicalprocedure,independent ofthe
menstrual cycle. The disadvantages are that the patient must be fit for
surgery, and that the tissue must subsequently be regrafted, with potential
risk of reintroducing malignant cells (Hoekman et al., 2015). In-vitro mat-
uration of oocytes from human ovarian tissue has not yet been achieved.
To date, however, relatively few births have beenreported after regrafting
frozen ovarian tissue (Donnez and Dolmans, 2015). A combination of
oocyte cryopreservation with ovarian tissue banking may be the most
effective fertility preservation technique in cancer patients (Donnez and
Dolmans, 2013).
Now that oocyte cryopreservation for oncology patients is available,
it is crucial that women are referred quickly to fertility specialists in
order to discuss their options and initiate treatment (Kim et al.,
2011a). Lee et al. (2010) found that both fertility preservation cycles
and chemotherapy could be started earlier in breast cancer patients re-
ferred before breast surgery. Additionally, 9 of 35 patients referred
before surgery were able to undergo two fertility preservation cycles,
compared to only 1 of 58 patients referred after surgery. Multiple
cycles areadvantageous as more oocytes (orembryos) can be cryopre-
served, potentially leading to greater success rates. Papers which have
assessed the characteristics of oncological patients receiving fertility
counselling (Lee et al., 2011) and undergoing fertility preservation
(Kim et al., 2012) have highlighted the need to improve overall
patient access.
Elective oocyte cryopreservation
In almost all countries, an increasing number of women are postponing
motherhood, resulting in rising numbers experiencing childlessness
which they had not necessarily intended (Kneale and Joshi, 2008).
Now that the cryopreservation of oocytes for age-related fertility
decline is considered acceptable (ESHRE Task Force on Ethics and
Law, 2012), ‘social egg freezing’ has become a popular subject within
the media, and demand for the procedure has increased rapidly (Garcia-
Velasco et al., 2013). Although the procedure is relatively new, there is
already a growing debate surrounding its use.
Theuseofyoungeroocytescanreducetheriskoffetallossandaneuploi-
dies associated with ageing oocytes (Goold and Savulescu, 2009). The use
of cryopreserved, autologous oocytes also allows the mother to have a
genetic relation to her child that could not be achieved through oocyte do-
nation(DondorpandDeWert,2009;GooldandSavulescu,2009),andwill
provide a higher chance of pregnancy than the use of standard IVF at an
older age (Sauer et al., 1990). A recent report of the largest series to
date, 1468 women undergoing elective oocyte cryopreservation for non-
oncologic reasons, of whom 137 returned to use them, showed that preg-
nancy rates were age-dependent and the optimal number of stored MII
oocytes was at least 8–10 (Cobo et al., 2015b).
Age-related fertility decline
The fertility decline experienced by women, which accelerates after the
age of 35, is a well-known phenomenon (Dunson et al., 2004; Sozou and
Hartshorne,2012).Thisdeclineislargelyattributabletoadecreaseinfol-
licular number and oocyte quality (Faddy et al., 1992). If older women do
conceive, they are at a significantly higher risk of fetal chromosomal ab-
normalities (Hook, 1981) and fetal loss (Nybo Anderson et al., 2000).
Reproductive potential can be extended by the use of donated
oocytes from younger women (Sauer et al., 1990; Navot et al., 1991)
Arecentstudyreviewedtherelationshipofage-relatedfertilitydecline
and the chance of realizing a desired family size (Habbema et al., 2015).
Using a computer simulation that took into account natural fertility rates
and current IVF success rates, it was suggested that women should start
trying to conceive at 35 for a 90% chance of a one-child family, and at 28
for a 90% chance of a three-child family. In the absence of IVF, these ages
dropped to 32 and 23 respectively. Studies have highlighted that many
women are unaware of the effect of age on fertility (Lampic et al.,
2006; Hashiloni-Dolev et al., 2011; Daniluk et al., 2012), and are thus
compromising their reproductive future.
OlderwomenaccessingARTexperiencelowersuccessrates,andthere-
fore often undergo multiple cycles when using their own oocytes (Leridon,
2004) before considering different options. With the use of donated
oocytes, they can experience similar success rates to their younger coun-
terparts (Sauer et al., 1990). However, offspring from oocyte donation
are not genetically related, and the process can be psychologically, emo-
tionally, and financially challenging. A recent survey of 183 women found
that 15% would rather remain childless than embark on oocyte donation
(Hodes-Wertz et al., 2013).
For those women who choose gamete donation, there may be further
hurdles; there is a worldwide shortage of oocyte donors (Trokoudes et al.,
2011). By electing to undergo oocyte cryopreservation in anticipation of age-
related fertility decline, women can effectively become their own oocyte
donor (Knopman et al., 2010a), avoiding the challenges described above.

 The rise of ‘social’ oocyte
cryopreservation: social and
ethical implications
Oocyte cryopreservation has been described as a ‘breakthrough for re-
productive autonomy’ (Harwood, 2009) and an ‘emancipation’ for
women (Homburg et al., 2009). There is an obvious gender inequality
in reproduction, since men are able to reproduce at much older ages
than women (Dondorp and De Wert, 2009). However, there are
various reasons for which women may wish to delay motherhood, for
example to focus on their career, to find a suitable partner or because
they simply do not feel ‘ready’ (Goold and Savulescu, 2009). Oocyte
cryopreservation can givewomen the ability to make more reproductive
choices; to decide when and with whom they wish to have children.
Many concerns have also been raised in response to oocyte cryopreser-
vation. There are risks involved in the process of ovarian stimulation and
oocyte retrieval themselves (Goold and Savulescu, 2009; Bayliss, 2015).
Additionally, when older women come back to use oocytes, they are also
more likely to experience pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia,
hypertension and gestational diabetes and to be delivered by Caesarean
section (Ziadeh and Yahaya, 2001; Joseph et al., 2005). However, it has
been highlighted that these risks are the same as those in older women
using conventional IVF (Goold and Savulescu, 2009). Another concern is
whether the availability of oocyte cryopreservation encourages women
to become complacent about their declining fertility (Goold and Savulescu,
2009). It is paramount that women receive the correct information about
oocytecryopreservationanditssuccessrates,anddonotacceptitasan‘in-
surance policy’ as it is often portrayed (Lockwood, 2011). Further, the de-
cision by companies such as Apple and Facebook to offer ‘social egg
freezing’ to their employees, may lead to women feeling pressured to
delay childbirth (Bayliss, 2015), undermining the concept of reproductive
autonomy. Whilst it has been emphasized that oocyte cryopreservation
should be providing women with a back-up for conception into their 40s
(Dondorp and De Wert, 2009), there are concerns that women will
delay motherhood until their late 50s or 60s.
Therearealsoworriesaboutthehighcostofoocytecryopreservation.
AstudybyHirshfeld-Cytronetal.(2012)determinedthatifwomenwere
to cryopreserve their oocytes at the age of 25 and return to them at 40,
this would be a less cost-effective strategy than simply undertaking ART
attheageof40ifdifficultieswerefoundtryingtoconceivenaturally.More
recently, a study suggested that oocyte cryopreservation before the age
of 38 reduces the cost of achieving a live birth aged 40 and beyond
(Devine et al., 2015). A similar study found that oocyte cryopreservation
was a more cost-effective strategy than IVF (Van Loendersloot et al.,
2011). In a response to high costs and a shortage of oocyte donors,
some clinics now provide a ‘freeze and share’ programme, whereby
women can donate a proportion of their frozen oocytes in order to
receive free or discounted treatment. It could be argued, however,
that women should be encouraged to have children early, rather than
to invest in an expensive technique with no guarantee of pregnancy.
Attitudes surrounding ‘social’
oocyte cryopreservation
Although it is still unclear exactly how many women will access elective
oocytecryopreservation(Stoopet al.,2014),thereis increasing research
to indicate the perceptions of reproductive-age women. A survey of
1049 Belgian women found that 77.6% had been previously aware of
the technique and 31.5% of women would potentially cryopreserve
their oocytes (Stoop et al., 2011). A smaller survey of 129 medical stu-
dents in Singapore found that 36.4% of respondents had heard of the
technique and 26.4% would consider it (Tan et al., 2014). Hodes-Wertz
et al. (2013) surveyed 183 patients who had undergone elective oocyte
cryopreservation in the USA. The main reason stated for delaying child-
birth(88%)wasthelackofapartner.Interestingly,84%ofthosesurveyed
were over the age of 35. This is significant, since age at time of oocyte
cryopreservation is an important determinant of outcome. Of these
women, 79% of the women wished that they had frozen their oocytes
earlier and 83% of patients believed that the media had given them a
false impression of the reproductive lifespan. Following oocyte cryo-
preservation, 53% of women stated that they felt more secure about
their reproductive future (Hodes-Wertz et al., 2013). In two further
studies, women banking oocytes were of a similar age (means of 36.7
and 36.9 years) (Baldwin et al., 2015; Stoop et al., 2015). In one cohort
of 65 women, 65% reported that they were motivated to cryopreserve
their oocytes as an ‘insurance’ against future infertility, and 49% wanted
more time to find a partner (Stoop et al., 2015).
Follow-up of ‘social-freezers’
Information about the outcomes of elective oocyte cryopreservation is
scarce, as there are few data about women returning to use them
(Stoop et al., 2014). In the survey by Hodes-Wertz et al. (2013), only
6% of women (11 respondents) had used their oocytes during the
6-yeartimeframe. Ofthese, threepatientsreportedhavingsubsequently
achievedapregnancyfromathawcycle,whilstfivewereunsuccessfuland
three others failed to comment. Stoop et al. (2015) found that 50.8% of
women who cryopreserved their oocytes anticipated using them at
some point. Interestingly, when their relationship and reproductive
choices following oocyte cryopreservation were compared with those
who did not cryopreserve their oocytes, no significant differences
were found. In a follow-up of 23 women who had cryopreserved their
oocytes, two had returned to use them with one successful pregnancy
(Baldwin et al., 2015).
Other indications
Alongside oocyte donation, fertility preservation for cancer patients and
‘social egg freezing’, there are a growing number of other indications for
oocyte cryopreservation.
Oocyte cryopreservation can be an important fertility option for
women with a range of medical conditions other than cancer (Donnez
and Dolmans, 2013) for example, women with endometriosis who
may experience reduced ovarian reserve post surgery (Elizur et al.,
2009), women with autoimmune diseases requiring gonadotoxic treat-
ment (Elizur et al., 2008), and women with genetic aberrations leading
to subfertility or risk of early menopause (Goswami and Conway,
2005). Oocyte cryopreservation can also provide an option for fertility
preservation in gender reassignment surgery.
In addition, now that assessment of ovarian reserve is widely available
using biophysical (antral follicle count) and biochemical (Anti-Mullerian
hormone, early follicular FSH) measures, many women who are asymp-
tomatic are identified as being at risk of early menopause. Although
Oocyte cryopreservation
445
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-abstract/22/4/440/2573626 by guest on 04 June 2019
 ovarian reserve measurement has not been shown to have predictive
value for spontaneous pregnancy, it is a reasonable strategy for these
women to consider elective oocyte cryopreservation.
Another useful application of oocyte cryopreservation arises in the
situation where a male partner fails to produce a sperm sample on the
dayof oocyte retrieval for IVF (Emery et al., 2004). The efficacy of ‘emer-
gency’ oocyte cryopreservation was demonstrated in cases during which
sperm extraction from male partners with non-obstructive azoospermia
had failed (Song et al., 2011). Following emergency vitrification, 15
couples chose to warm the oocytes and use donor sperm for insemin-
ation, resulting in a clinical pregnancy rate of 53.3%. Vitrification has
alsobeenproposedasanefficientstrategyformanaginglow-responders,
allowing the storage and accumulation of oocytes from multiple ovarian
stimulation cycles before IVF and embryo transfer (Cobo et al., 2012).
Where are we now?
Oocyte cryopreservation is now an established technology with a wide
range of indications. As the number of oocyte cryopreservation cycles
increases, there is a real need to monitor why it is being done, the tech-
niques being used, and the success rates achieved. Ideally national and
international registries should be established to monitor the process.
The increase in patients and oocyte cryopreservation cycles should be
an advantage for carrying out future research. This should include the
long-term follow-up of children born following oocyte vitrification. As
with all ART techniques, there are ethical questions that need to be con-
sidered, particularly in the case of ‘social egg freezing’. Oocyte cryo-
preservation is an exciting technique that will prove beneficial to many
patients in the future.
