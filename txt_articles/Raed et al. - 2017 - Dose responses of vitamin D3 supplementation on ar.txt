Abstract
Background
Clinical trials are scant and equivocal on whether vitamin D can ameliorate arterial stiffness,
particularly in populations at high risk for vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular disease
(CVD). This study determined the dose-response effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on
arterial stiffness in overweight African Americans with vitamin D deficiency.
Methods
Seventy overweight African Americans (aged 13–45 years) with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
D [25(OH)D] levels � 20 ng/mL were randomized to monthly oral supplementation of
18,000 IU (~600 IU/day, n = 17), 60,000 IU (~2000 IU/day, n = 18), or 120,000 IU (~4000 IU/
day, n = 18) of vitamin D3 or placebo (n = 17) for 16-weeks. The arterial stiffness measure-
ments, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid-radial PWV, were assessed
by applanation tonometry at baseline and 16 weeks.
Results
Vitamin D3 supplementation demonstrated a dose-response increase in serum 25(OH)D
concentrations between groups (P<0.01). A significant downward linear trend was observed
for carotid-femoral PWV (P<0.01), as the mean changes in carotid-femoral PWV across the
four treatment groups were 0.13 m/s (95% CI: -0.24, 0.51 m/s) for placebo, 0.02 m/s (95%
CI: -0.34, 0.38 m/s) for 600 IU/day group, -0.11 m/s (95% CI: -0.50, 0.27 m/s) for the 2,000
IU/day group, and -0.70 m/s (95% CI: -1.07, -0.32 m/s) for the 4,000 IU/day group. Findings
were similar for carotid-radial PWV (P = 0.03), as the mean changes in carotid-radial PWV
across the four treatment groups were 0.24 m/s (95% CI: -0.45, 0.92 m/s) for placebo, 0.09

Conclusion
Arterial stiffness was improved by vitamin D3 supplementation in a dose-response manner
in overweight African Americans with vitamin D deficiency.
Introduction
African-Americans are prone to suboptimal vitamin D status [1]. In the last decade, vitamin
D deficiency has been related to cardiovascular risk factors [2], cardiovascular mortality [3],
stroke [4], and peripheral arterial disease [5]. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading
cause of death among African Americans [6], which requires finding a tool for early recogni-
tion of pathological processes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment [7]. Arterial stiffness is
an independent predictor of CVD events and mortality [8, 9]. Arterial stiffness is not only a
risk factor for CVD, but also a pathological mechanism leading to CVD through its influence
on blood vessel and heart. In vessels, high shear stress in a stiff arterial system leads to ampli-
fication of endothelial dysfunction [10, 11]. Also, productivity of heart ejection and cardiac
perfusion are impacted in individual with stiff arteries [12]. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a
noninvasive, gold standard for arterial stiffness measurement, and a tool to determine the
therapeutic effects and efficacy in interventional studies [13] [14]. Emerging evidence shows
that vitamin D deficiency has been correlated with arterial stiffness [15, 16]. This suggests
that investigating the impact of vitamin D supplementation on arterial stiffness is critical to
reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Although vitamin D interventions are scant and equivocal on whether supplemental vita-
min D can ameliorate arterial stiffness [17, 18], we previously observed that 2000 IU/day of
vitamin D3 supplementation counteracted the progression of arterial stiffness in African-
American adolescents [19]. More recently, we conducted another 16-week randomized pla-
cebo-controlled vitamin D3 supplementation trial (placebo, 600 IU/day, 2,000 IU/day, vs.
4,000 IU/day) in apparently healthy overweight African Americans with vitamin D deficiency,
which revealed a dose-response increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concen-
trations [20]. The objective of this study was to perform a secondary analysis of this previously
conducted randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that vitamin D3 supplementation
reduces arterial stiffness in a dose-response manner.
Materials and methods
Study population and design
This study is an ancillary analysis to a previously completed, randomized, double-blinded,
vitamin D3 supplementation trial (clinicaltrials.gov registration#: NCT01583621) [20]. The 70
participants in this trial were recruited from the Augusta, Georgia area by advertisements and
by word of mouth. Inclusion criteria were the following: 1) African American race; 2) aged
between 13 and 45 years; 3) overweight/obese [defined by body mass index (BMI) �25 kg/m2
for adults and �85th percentile for age and sex for adolescents according to the Center of Dis-
ease Control and Prevention]; and 4) suboptimal vitamin D status (defined as serum 25(OH)D
concentrations of �20 ng/mL at screening visit) [21]. Participants were excluded if they were

 pregnant or if they were taking medications/dietary supplements or had any medical condition
that could affect nutritional status or metabolism. Adolescent participants and their guardian
provided written informed assent and consent, respectively; and the adult participants pro-
vided informed consent. The study was approved by the Augusta University (AU) Institutional
Review. All measurements were performed at the Medical College of Georgia’s Georgia Pre-
vention Institute at Augusta University between December 2011 and November 2012. The
trial registration on clinicaltrials.gov was delayed due to an oversight, and the authors confirm
that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.
Randomization and treatment allocation
The CONSORT diagram (Fig 1) which was reported in previous publication gives the details
of participant enrollment [20]. The recruited subjects were randomly assigned to four groups:
18,000 IU/month (~600 IU/day), 60,000 IU/month (~2,000 IU/day), or 120,000 IU/month
(~4,000 IU/day) of vitamin D3 or placebo. The placebo and vitamin D3 containing capsules,
provided by the Bio-Tech Pharmacal (Fayetteville, AR), were similar in taste and appearance
and were indistinguishable for participants and investigators. The capsules were provided to
the participants by supervised monthly dosing for 16-weeks to ensure compliance. The AU
clinical research pharmacy generated the randomization codes, dispensed the study capsules,
and maintained the randomization codes until the end of the study and did not have any direct
role in the data collection. Study investigators, research coordinators, and the study partici-
pants were blinded to treatment allocation.
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
Fasting blood samples were collected by a trained phlebotomist at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16
weeks, and the samples were stored at −80˚C until assayed. Using samples collected from each
time point, serum 25(OH)D was measured using an enzyme immunoassay (Immunodiagnos-
tic Systems, Fountain Hills, AZ). The mean intra- and interassay coefficients of variation for
serum 25(OH)D were 5.6 and 6.6%, respectively. Analytical reliability of serum 25(OH)D
assays was further monitored through DEQAS (the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment
Scheme).
Blood pressure
At baseline and 16 weeks, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measurements
(Dinamap 1864SX; Criticon, Inc., Tampa, FL) were taken three times at 5, 7, and 9 minutes
after a 10-minute relaxation period in a quiet temperature controlled room. The average was
used to represent systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.
Arterial stiffness
The arterial stiffness measurements, carotid-femoral PWV and carotid-radial PWV, were mea-
sured at baseline and 16 weeks. As recommended by the American Heart Association [14],
carotid-femoral PWV was our primary outcome measurement of arterial stiffness, and it was
measured in duplicate using the SphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) by
sequentially recording electrocardiographic-gated carotid and femoral artery waveforms by
applanation tonometry (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX). Using a segmometer, straight-line
distance measurements were taken from the suprasternal notch to the carotid sampling site
and from the suprasternal notch to the site where the femoral artery was measured. The time
interval between the onset of femoral and carotid waveforms was determined as the mean

 from 10 consecutive cardiac cycles. Quality measurements were confirmed by the standard
deviation of time intervals corresponding to the patient’s ECG and femoral and carotid artery
waveforms. Standard deviations greater than 10% of the carotid-femoral PWV value were not
accepted. The carotid-femoral PWV was calculated from the distance between measurement
points (D, in meters) and the measured time delay (t, in seconds) between the peak of the ECG
P-wave and the trough of a waveform as follows: carotid-femoral PWV = D/t (m/s). The same
investigator who performed the PWV measurements at baseline and posttest was blinded to
the treatments. The within-observer variability (mean difference ± SD of two measurements)
was 0.08 ± 1.10 m/s for carotid-femoral PWV and 0.15 ± 1.01 m/s for carotid-radial PWV.

 Statistical considerations and analyses
Power calculations were computed based on primary outcomes 25(OH)D and carotid-femoral
PWV. The computations are based upon the linear contrast approach for the main effect of
treatment, rather than the traditional omnibus F-test followed by post hoc pairwise compari-
sons, because a pre-specified contrast conditioned on the ordering of responses is more power-
ful to detect the expected pattern, without sacrificing control of type I error. Required are
assumptions concerning the difference in mean 16-week changes in the response (i.e., differ-
ences in the mean gain scores) across treatment arms, and the variance of the gain score, from
which effect size is computed. Using data previously collected in our laboratory [19, 22], we
pooled estimates in standard deviation (SD) of change for 25(OH)D (SD = 5.1 ng/mL), and
carotid-femoral PWV (SD = 0.8 m/s), and we estimated effect sizes (i.e., Cohen’s d) for these
outcomes [25(OH)D, d = 3.0; and carotid-femoral PWV, d = 1.1] based on the assumption
that the 600 IU and 2000 IU groups would have one-quarter and one-half the mean change,
respectively, of that occurring in the 4000 IU group, relative the mean change in the control
group. We determined that 10–16 subjects/group would provide 81–96% power (α = 0.05) to
detect a difference in mean change of the outcome variable between groups. With a given sam-
ple size of 16 subject/group (a-level set at 0.05), the proposed study will have power of 0.81.
Assuming a 10% sample size loss due to either attrition or insufficient quality of measure-
ments, a starting sample size of 18 subjects/group (N = 72) will preserve power of the study
design.
Characteristics of the participants at baseline were descriptively compared among the dose
groups, with data presented as means ± SD if not stated otherwise. Group differences at base-
line were determined by analysis of variance for normally distributed variables or by Kruskal-
Wallis test, otherwise. Group differences in proportions at baseline were tested by χ2 test of
goodness of fit.
Repeated-measures mixed models were used with restricted maximum likelihood estima-
tion in an intention-to-treat analysis of each outcome measure using all available data. In the
base models for carotid-femoral PWV, carotid-femoral PWV, and blood pressure, participant
was included as a random effect, and intervention group (placebo, 600 IU/day, 2,000 IU/day,
and 4,000 IU/day) and measurement time (baseline and 16 weeks) and their interaction were
included as fixed effects. In serum 25(OH)D base models, fixed effects for measurement time
had three levels (baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) since it was also measured at 8 weeks.
Covariance structures were compared by using the Akaike information criterion; the autore-
gressive structure and the compound symmetry structure had similar Akaike information cri-
terion values, so the compound symmetry structure was chosen. In addition, we adjusted for
age, gender, BMI, and season in a secondary analysis to assess their contribution to the changes
in the arterial stiffness measurements associated with the intervention. A priori linear contrasts
tested dose-response effects of the intervention. If the trend for difference in the outcome vari-
able of interest across groups was significant (P < 0.05), differences among individual groups,
adjusted for multiple comparisons, were tested by using Tukey’s honestly significant difference
adjustment.
Model fit was examined by looking at various residual plots. A sensitivity analysis was per-
formed by using multiple imputation to determine whether the missing data affected the
carotid-femoral PWV and carotid-femoral PWV. Group membership and measurements over
time were used in the imputation process, and the imputations were conducted using two
methods. On the basis of available outcome data from all randomized participants, an initial
imputation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to establish a monotone
missing data pattern. Missing values in the monotone data set were subsequently imputed

 multiple times (5 imputations) in a second step using regression procedures [23]. The week 16
outcome measurements were calculated using the imputed data sets and analyzed using analy-
sis of variance. The data from the five analyses were subsequently combined into single esti-
mates and tested as described by Schafer [24]. All statistical analyses were performed with the
use of SPSS software (version 24, IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL) and SAS software (version
9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results
The flow diagram is presented in Fig 1. Of 129 screened, ~75% (96 individuals) met the inclu-
sion criteria. A total of 70 subjects were available at baseline. Sixteen percent of the total sample
were males, and 79% were obese. The baseline mean serum 25(OH)D concentration in the
total sample was 14.0 ± 4.0 ng/mL. None of the participants reported side effects. The baseline
characteristics for the vitamin D and placebo groups are shown in Table 1. The four groups
did not differ in sex distribution, age, body mass index, season of study visit, serum 25(OH)D,
blood pressure, carotid-femoral PWV, or carotid-radial PWV at baseline.
Effect of vitamin D supplementation on 25(OH)D at 8- and 16-weeks
Fig 2 shows the mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations at 8 weeks and 16 weeks in response to
16 weeks of monthly supplementation in the form of either placebo or 18,000 IU (600 IU/day),
60,000 IU (2,000 IU/day), or 120,000 IU of vitamin D3 (4,000 IU/day). As previously reported
[20], changes over time of serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly different between
treatment groups (group x time, P < 0.01). After 8 weeks of supplementation with 600 IU/day
vitamin D3, serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased 50%, while after 16 weeks the mean 25
(OH)D concentrations increased slightly further to 61.4%. In the 2,000 IU/day group, the
mean 25(OH)D concentrations increased 91.8% and 126.4%, respectively, at 8 weeks and 16
weeks. The highest level of percentage change in 25(OH)D concentrations after 8 weeks

 (168.4%) was observed in the 4,000 IU/day group. However, after 16 weeks in the 4,000 IU/day
group, the mean 25(OH)D concentrations reached a plateau and did not increase any further
(161.7%). Post hoc comparisons showed that changes in 25(OH)D concentrations were signifi-
cantly greater in the 4,000 IU group vs. 2,000 IU group after 8 weeks (P < 0.01), but not after
16 weeks (P = 0.61).
Effect of vitamin D supplementation on arterial stiffness at 16 weeks
The effect of the various doses of vitamin D3 supplementation on arterial stiffness measure-
ments after 16 weeks are shown in Table 2 and Fig 3. In the primary mixed model analysis, a
significant downward linear trend was observed for carotid-femoral PWV (group x time,

treatment groups were 0.13 m/s (95% CI, -0.24 to 0.51 m/s) for placebo, 0.02 m/s (95% CI,

day group, and -0.70 m/s (95% CI, -1.07 to -0.32 m/s) for the 4,000 IU/day group. Likewise, a
significant downward linear trend was observed for carotid-radial PWV (group x time,
P = 0.03) (Table 2 and Fig 3B), as the mean changes in carotid-radial PWV across the four
treatment groups were 0.24 m/s (95% CI, -0.45 to 0.92 m/s) for placebo, 0.09 m/s (95% CI,

day group, and -0.61 m/s (95% CI, -1.25 to 0.02 m/s) for the 4,000 IU/day group. Post hoc
comparisons showed that the decreases in carotid-femoral PWV (-10.4% vs. -2.0%, respec-
tively) and carotid-radial PWV (-8.0 vs. -7.4%, respectively) from baseline to 16-weeks were
significantly greater in the 4000 IU/day group vs. 2000 IU/day group (both P � 0.05). The
results of the sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation models were similar to the miss-
ing-completely-at-random mixed model analysis (S1 Data).
In a secondary analysis adjusting for age, gender, BMI and season of study visit, the findings
for carotid-femoral PWV and carotid-radial PWV were similar to the models without covari-
ates (S2 Data). When we assessed the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on blood pressure
after 16 weeks, there were no significant changes in systolic BP (P = 0.86) or diastolic BP

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial regarding dose-ranging vitamin
D supplementation on measures of arterial stiffness in overweight African-Americans with
vitamin D deficiency. The key finding from this study was that arterial stiffness was improved
by vitamin D3 supplementation in a dose-response manner.
It is hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency is linked to greater arterial stiffness, suggesting
that increasing vitamin D intake may improve arterial stiffness [15]. Few randomized clinical
trials, to date, have assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation on arterial stiffness mea-
sured by PWV. Among the vitamin D and arterial stiffness clinical trials, the results have been
inconsistent [17]. Discrepancies may be attributed in part to differences in study design and
instruments used. Studies were unsuccessful in increasing vitamin D to the optimal range due
to giving one single dose of vitamin D at baseline [25], or utilizing low dose (<2000 IU/day)
[25–27].
Other possible reasons for study inconsistencies may be due, in part, to differences in study
duration, vitamin D administration, the vitamin D status of the study participants before and
after intervention, and adherence to the supplements. Marckmann et al. [28] showed no effect
of vitamin D on biomarkers of CVD including PWV, which could be attributed to the short
follow-up time (8 weeks). In the study by McGreevy and colleagues [25], their vitamin D inter-
vention was a relative short duration of 8-weeks; the vitamin D supplement was administered
intramuscularly rather than orally, which has better bioavailability [29]; and participants were
still vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL) after the intervention. It is postulated that, in vitamin D
deficient individuals, 12-weeks of vitamin D3 supplementation is needed to achieve optimal
vitamin D status [30]. Additionally, Larsen et al. [18] and Gepner et al. [31] reported that
PWV was not reduced probably due to recruiting participants with optimal vitamin D levels at
baseline.
African-Americans have lower vitamin D levels and greater arterial stiffness [1, 32, 33]. It
is noteworthy that African-Americans have higher CVD morbidity and mortality [6], which

 may be attributed to both arterial stiffness and vitamin D deficiency. The mechanism for ben-
eficial effects of vitamin D on arterial stiffness is unknown. However, one potential pathway
is via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. For instance, animal studies using the vita-
min D receptor knock-out mouse have revealed that both high renin expression and angio-
tensin II synthesis can increase vascular tone and arterial stiffness [34, 35]. Other potential
hypotheses include vitamin D’s ability to suppress endothelin-induced vascular smooth mus-
cle cell proliferation, macrophages activation, and vascular calcifications [15]. Also, vitamin
D has immunomodulatory properties which modulate the acquired immune system by
reducing inflammation, suppressing T-cell proliferation, and reducing inflammatory cyto-
kines [36]. In this study and our prior investigation in African Americans [19], vitamin D
supplementation of 2,000 or 4,000 IU/day reduced arterial stiffness, as measured by carotid-
femoral PWV. Another important finding in our study was that the decrease in carotid-femo-
ral PWV was significantly greater in the 4,000 IU/day group (-10.4%) compared to the 2,000
IU/day group (-2.0%). This could be explained by the immunomodulatory capacity of differ-
ent doses of vitamin D as studies showed dose dependent responses of vitamin D on reducing
inflammation and cytokines synthesis [37–39]. It is important to note, however, that the
mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations after 16 weeks of supplementation were similar
between the 4,000 IU/day (34.8 ng/mL) and 2,000 IU/day (36.0 ng/mL) groups. It is possible
that the greater decrease in carotid-femoral PWV observed in the 4,000 IU/day group vs.
2,000 IU/day group after 16 weeks may reflect the higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations
detected in the 4,000 IU/day group (35.7 ng/mL) vs. 2,000 IU/day group (30.5 ng/mL) after 8
weeks. Therefore, it is plausible that circulating 25(OH) concentrations may need to be main-
tained at ~35 ng/mL or higher for longer than 8 weeks in order for advantageous effects on
arterial stiffness can be observed.
Our study has several strengths and limitations that need to be discussed. Strengths include
the following: double blind randomized controlled study design, supervised monthly dosing
administration to achieve 100% compliance, and the doses selected in this study were based on
the current Recommended Dietary Allowance (600 IU/day) and the tolerable upper intake
level (4,000 IU/day) by the Institute of Medicine [21]. Limitations should be acknowledged.
First, our sample size was relatively small, large RCTs are warranted to validate the findings.
Second, the participant recruitment was done in different seasons. However, we recruited par-
ticipants with suboptimal vitamin D status across all seasons and the results were not altered
after adjusting for seasons. Finally, the female distribution was higher in our sample compared
to male. However, the gender representation was not different among groups, and the result
did not differ after adjusting for gender as confounder.
In conclusion, vitamin D3 supplementation improves arterial stiffness in a dose-response
manner in overweight African-Americans with vitamin D deficiency. Larger trials are needed
to determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation reduces the risk of CVD events in at risk
populations.
