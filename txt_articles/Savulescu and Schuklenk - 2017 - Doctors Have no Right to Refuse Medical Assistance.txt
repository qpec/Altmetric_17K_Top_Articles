ABSTRACT
In an article in this journal, Christopher Cowley argues that we have ‘misun-
derstood the special nature of medicine, and have misunderstood the moti-
vations of the conscientious objectors’.1 We have not. It is Cowley who has
misunderstood the role of personal values in the profession of medicine.
We argue that there should be better protections for patients from doctors’
personal values and there should be more severe restrictions on the right
to conscientious objection, particularly in relation to assisted dying. We
argue that eligible patients could be guaranteed access to medical services
that are subject to conscientious objections by: (1) removing a right to con-
scientious objection; (2) selecting candidates into relevant medical special-
ities or general practice who do not have objections; (3) demonopolizing the
provision of these services away from the medical profession.
REASONABLE ARGUMENTS’ LACK OF
TRACTION EXPLAINED
Cowley begins his defence of conscientious objection by
conceding: �Schuklenk�s arguments appear very reasona-
ble, and his concern for patients is genuine. What he and
Savulescu lack is an explanation of why their arguments
have failed to move legislators or professional bodies.�2
To the extent that this is true, the answer is obvious:
the influence of organized religion in society. The more
religious a society is, the more religious values are
imposed on people. Many of the conscientious objection
protections we are grappling with today were written
into constitutional arrangements in times gone by when
the influence of churches was significantly more powerful
than it is today. In strongly Christian societies, like Ire-
land, abortion remains illegal. Indeed, in Ireland, sym-
physiotomy
was
still
performed
into the
1980s
in
preference to Caesarean section for obstructed preg-
nancy. This involved barbaric splitting of the pubic sym-
physis to allow the passage of the head of the baby. This
resulted in horrific side effects for the woman, including
gross incontinence, pain and restricted mobility, but was
performed in many cases without consent, without even
informing the patient, in part because Catholic doctors
believed that a Caesarean section might impede the
woman�s ability to have the maximum number of chil-
dren possible in the future.3
In fact, Cowley is wrong that no countries have
rejected a right to conscientious objection. Enlightened,
progressive secular countries like Sweden, have labour
laws in line with our arguments. Sweden provides no
legal right of employees to conscientious objection.4
Employees could be sacked for failing to provide legal
services under labour law. The same holds true, for
instance,
for
Finland,

 participating in induced abortion is not present in the
Finnish health care system or legislation unlike in many
other European countries.�5 This solves the problem of
patient access to care, and it has not had a detrimental
effect on applications to these countries� medical schools,
or to the ability of their medical professions to replenish
their ranks with new graduates. These countries have res-
olutely prioritised patient access to care over the protec-
tion of doctors� idiosyncratic moral convictions with
regard to these services. Other countries ought to follow
Sweden and Finland.
‘WEAK ARGUMENTS’ AND WEAK
ARGUMENTS
Cowley then moves on to give what he admits are �weak
arguments�.6 The first is that where the objectionable
practice is a very small part of a GP�s work, we should
accommodate a refusal to perform it, as we should
accommodate a GP with a back complaint who requires
a change in duties for medical reasons. He gives a num-
ber of reasons to reject this argument but misses the cen-
tral one: the provision of these services is a good thing.
Let us consider this argument in the case of contracep-
tion, another standard focus of treatment deniers (con-
science objectors). If contraception accounts for a small
amount of a GP�s practice, should we accommodate a
conscientious objection to it?
Conscientious refusal to provide contraception is com-
mon and mistakenly supported by medical boards and
medical associations (see for instance recent Australian
reports).7
But contraception is legal because the ability to con-
trol reproduction is one of the greatest and most valuable
of human achievements. Before modern contraception,
women
died
early,
suffered
from
multiparity,
were
chained to the home, could not work or get an educa-
tion. When we make contraception legal, we do not do
so merely because people ought to be free to choose
when and how many children to have. It is because it is
good to choose this.
Contraception is a social good (at least in a world
with a sufficient population), and it is demanded by eligi-
ble autonomous patients, and insofar as doctors have a
monopoly over its provision, they ought to provide it.
For religious GPs, obstetricians and pharmacists to
refuse to provide the oral contraceptive pill is simply
unprofessional. There is no requirement for a healthcare
system to accommodate unprofessional behaviour: there
is no analogy with accommodating individual occupa-
tional health needs.
One problem in countries like Australia, Canada, the
UK and the United States face is that they have histori-
cally made provision for conscientious objection. There-
fore people who enter medicine with a religious belief
against standard medical practices such as contraception
do so with an expectation that they will be able to con-
scientiously object. It might be argued then that this
should be honoured.
It is unclear, however, why this initial expectation
should be decisive in practical policy making. A career
in medicine might span 40 years and the field a doctor
leaves might be almost unrecognizable from the field she
enters. It is clear that the scope of professional practice
is ultimately determined by society, and that it is bound
to evolve over time. That is true not only for the ques-
tion of what kinds of services must be provided, it is also
true for conscientious objection itself, as the mentioned
examples of the two Scandinavian countries show. If a
professional norm is no longer fit for purpose, it should
be changed.
Regardless
of
how
one
views
the
matter
of
grandfathering-in those who signed up to practising med-
icine believing that they would have the indefinite right to
refuse, for example, to provide contraceptive services, we
should create a system that guarantees patients access to
contraception because it is good. Whether it is a small
part of a given doctor�s job is irrelevant. If it is part and
parcel of a doctor�s professional role to provide contra-
ception, they should provide it.
Therefore, even if we did not change the system for
those already practising medicine, given that there is an
oversupply of people capable and willing to become med-
ical professionals, we should select those willing to pro-
vide the full scope of professional services, and those
who are most capable. Medical schools and training pro-
grammes should carefully outline the nature of the job
and screen for conscientious objection where it is rele-
vant to job performance. Requirements of the job should
be written into the contract.
This is, in effect, what Sweden has done. There might
be risks in requiring people to provide services they don�t
want to provide: perhaps some or even many of them
might do so half-heartedly, possibly to the detriment of
patient care. However, there are no data from countries
such as Sweden and Finland to suggest that that this
concern has any basis in reality. Doctors who did behave
like this would be acting with a gross lack of profession-
alism and would therefore be subject to censure and
appropriate remedies by their professional, statutory

 bodies. At any rate, the best way to address such a con-
cern is better ethics education. In addition to selecting
candidates who are tolerant, have epistemic responsibility
and humility and are willing to accommodate patient
values,8 we need medical ethics education to encourage
better
understanding
of
values
and
their
place
in
medicine.
Finally, if conscientious objection continues to be tol-
erated in medicine and results in treatment denial, alter-
native ways of guaranteeing reasonable and fair access to
these goods ought to be provided. One way of doing this
is to de-monopolize the provision of the relevant service.
If the quality of such a service could match that provided
by medical professionals, and sufficient supply could be
ensured, then this would be a viable alternative. This
would require new training, selection, regulatory and
oversight procedures, which would be cumbersome and
expensive. But there is no reason why only doctors could
competently provide, for example, contraception, abor-
tion or assisted dying services.
THE IMPORTANCE OF MORAL
INTEGRITY
Cowley proceeds to advance Wicclair�s moral integrity
argument, albeit in a qualified way:
According to the first prong of the argument, being
forced to act against one�s conscience can result in a
loss of integrity, and this in turn leads to �strong feel-
ings of guilt, remorse, and shame as well as a loss of
self-respect� (26), to people dropping out of the profes-
sion or, if they know their integrity will not be pro-
tected, to not entering the profession in the fist [sic]
place.�9
If selection processes make it clear that conscience
claims cannot be deployed and as a result people who
object on grounds of conscience to certain aspects of the
job are not selected, or choose not to pursue a career in
medicine, would this make for worse medical practice?
We don�t know of any evidence that those with reli-
gious beliefs make better medical doctors. If it were the
case that Christians or Muslims, or members other reli-
gious groups, who are conscientious objectors, make bet-
ter doctors because of these ideological mindsets, this
would be a reason to accommodate conscience in selec-
tion procedures. We are deeply sceptical that holding reli-
gious beliefs makes
one better
at
the
practice
of
medicine. Of course, there are many characteristics that a
good doctor displays in addition to purely technical or
scientific knowledge and skills. This might include traits
such as empathy and compassion. However, these are
traits that are not specific to religious people, nor do all
religious people possess them.
On the contrary, as the example of symphysiotomy
shows, some religious beliefs, when imposed on medical
practice, can have a highly detrimental effect. Other exam-
ples include the resistance of the Catholic Church to pro-
viding birth control in developing countries as a part of
aid, and its opposition to the provision of condoms to pre-
vent the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and prisons
or the suboptimal care provided by religiously motivated
healthcare professionals to gay and lesbian patients.10
Richard Dawkins got it right, when he noted, �religion is
not simply vicars giving tea parties. There are evil con-
sequences.�11 We should evaluate medical practices not on
their basis in religion, but on their impact on the patient.
One might object that this response misses the point.
One might grant that it would be better for patients in
the future if doctors did not conscientiously object, or if
they were admitted to the profession in the first place.
But nonetheless, we face a problem now that there are
doctors who do conscientiously object and respecting
their integrity gives them the prerogative not be involved
in its provision.12
Doctors must put patients� interests ahead of their own
integrity. They must ensure that legal, beneficial, desired
services are provided, if not by them, then by others. If
this leads to feelings of guilty remorse or them dropping
out of the profession, so be it. As professionals, doctors
have to take responsibility for their feelings. There is an
oversupply of people wishing to be doctors. The place to
debate issues of contraception, abortion and euthanasia is
at the societal level, not the bedside, once these procedures
are legal and a part of medical practice.13
ANALOGIES, DIRECTNESS AND MORAL
RESPONSIBILITY
Supporters of conscientious objection in Western litera-
ture typically confine their analysis to a discussion of

 Christian conscience. They often struggle with other reli-
gions, particularly Islam, whose conscientious objectors
include those who will not treat the opposite sex at all,
and can barely conceive of secular consciences that might
influence medical treatment.
Savulescu gave the example of a doctor who subscribes
to the fair innings argument that people over the age of
80 have had their fair share and should not receive life
prolonging medical treatment. This is a defensible value:
Daniel Callahan, Ezekiel Emanuel,14 amongst others,
have supported it. Nonetheless, these personal convic-
tions should not govern bedside care or intensive care
practice in the absence of some kind of general demo-
cratic societal endorsement.
Cowley sees this is as a telling analogy so he tries to
show why it is disanalogous. He gives two reasons.
The two cases differ in the directness of the contem-
plated wrong. In the abortion context, the objecting
doctor is very clear about the nature of the moral
wrong that she is being asked to authorise or per-
form, and she is very clear about the victim of the
wrongful act. On the other hand, it is less clear that
such a �good-innings� doctor, in being forced to over-
ride her objection and treat an over-80 patient,
thereby commits or even colludes with what she con-
siders wrong; the wrong, for her, is the more abstract
one of some other, younger patient whose treatment
has perhaps been postponed because of the proposed
use of expensive scarce resources on this over-80
patient. And it would be a stretch to say that this
doctor is responsible for that younger patient�s suf-
fering or death, when there are so many other cau-
sally relevant institutional factors between them.15
However, �directness� is morally irrelevant.16 The belief
that it is morally relevant is a psychological bias that
causes enormous damage in everyday life. The fact that
we do not know the identity of the victims of our acts or
omissions does not change their gravity. We can easily
imagine a real life case where there is a shortage of inten-
sive care beds. If an 85 year old were admitted now, the
unit would be full. Based on experience we know with
near certainty that there would be a younger patient, per-
haps a car accident victim, needing another bed tomor-
row. The fact that we do not know the identity of this
patient at the time of decision-making does not alleviate
responsibility for that person dying if no bed can be
found. The following example serves to better illustrate
this point:
Imagine you are an executioner. You shoot a con-
demned person to death. You caused the death. Now
imagine you are a part of 10 man firing squad. You all
manage to hit your target – the heart – at the same
instant. You are not 10% morally responsible for the
death now. You should put down your rifle if you believe
the person is innocent, or the death penalty unjust, even
if you know 9 others will kill the person.17
The multiplicity of causal factors does not alleviate
moral responsibility. It is a feature of ordinary moral
psychology to think that we are less responsible if many
people contribute to a catastrophic outcome. For this
same psychological reason, people don�t feel responsible
for climate change – their contribution is negligible even
though together the effects could be enormous.
In any case, if society thinks contraception, abortion
and assistance in dying are important, it should select
people prepared to do them, not people whose values
preclude them from participating. Equally, people not
prepared to participate in such expected courses of
action should not join professions tasked by society with
the provision of such services.
Cowley continues his argument,
In addition to the problem of determining causality
here, there are two very different perspectives in
play:
the
good-innings
argument
is
ultimately
focused on changing the resource distribution policy;
if there were enough resources, that same doctor
might well treat the over-80 patient. On the other
hand, the anti-abortion doctor adopts a local policy
when she contemplates the destruction of the inno-
cent human being in the woman in front of her,
regardless of the impact that such a conscientious
objection might have on the rest of policy.�18
We believe the analogy stands. To show this, we will
now offer two cases of secular conscientious objection
where doctors are complicit in a direct lethal wrong
involving identifiable patients.
TWO CASES OF SECULAR
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION
Here are two unethical practices that doctors are forced
to be complicit with and where the law ought to change.

17 Of course, we do not believe conscientious objectors are like execu-
tioners in one important way: they do not kill a person. This analogy
illustrates the nature of collective responsibility. If a conscience objector
did believe she was killing an innocent person, this analogy shows she
should not only put down her gun, but do everything she could to pre-
vent the execution, as we will go on to argue.

Doctors Have No Right to Refuse Medical Assistance in Dying, Abortion or Contraception 165

C 2016 The Authors Bioethics Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd
 The first is the destruction of human embryos created
in the course of assisted reproduction when these could
be used by another infertile couple or for research to
develop cures for life-threatening diseases. We believe
that patients should not be able to choose to destroy
their embryos when their family is complete but rather
should give them either to other infertile patients19 or to
medical research or treatment. This is a deeply held
value. Yet the law in the UK and Australia requires their
destruction after a certain number of years. We consider
this law to be unethical.
How should IVF specialists respond who share our
views? Here we arrive at the role of conscience and the
place of values in medicine. The law is such that couples
can or must destroy their excess embryos. We believe these
laws should change. This should motivate us to campaign
to change them. In the meantime, doctors should engage
patients in argument and try to convince them rationally,
using evidence, to donate their excess embryos.20 But in
the end, if couples wish to destroy their excess embryos,
IVF specialists should comply, regardless of their consci-
entious objection to the practice.
Another example of immoral behaviour is the refusal
to donate one�s organs after death. We have argued that
there is a minimal moral duty to donate organs.21 It is a
zero-cost rescue and can save up to 10 lives.
As consequentialists, we view failing to donate organs
as tantamount to killing innocent people. We believe it is
deeply wrong to not donate organs after death and
rather choose to bury them or burn them.
We have campaigned to change the law to an opt-out
regulatory regime, permitting society to override family
refusal and to prioritise organ donors in the allocation
of scarce transplant organs.22 In the absence of a change
of existing regulatory regimes doctors should try to con-
vince patients to donate their organs, but if in the end,
they refuse, that refusal should be respected even though
we do not believe they have a morally defensible claim to
those life-preserving organs after death. Doctors thus
should be complicit with lethal immorality.
It is a common objection to our view that doctors are
not instruments but moral agents. It is correct that doc-
tors are moral agents like any one of us who is capable
of making moral choices. The place of reasons and
values in medicine is properly located in dialogue with
patients,23 and in attempting to shape policy and law, as
we have done in the case of changing the law around
abortion,24 and euthanasia.25 However, we are not enti-
tled to impose those values on patients in the delivery of
health care and deny treatment when these patients are
legally entitled to access that particular service.
It is Cowley, then, who has misconceived the nature of
medicine and the role of values in medicine in a demo-
cratic society by suggesting that doctors� personal moral
conviction should take priority over other considerations,
such as patients� legal rights or the importance of a
rational dialogue with patients.
MORAL WRONGNESS IN MEDICINE
Cowley is confused about the role of moral judgment in
the delivery of medical services. In differentiating objec-
tion to providing abortion from objection arising from
racist or homophobic discrimination, he claims views
about the moral status of the fetus are legitimate because
they are in some sense defensible. He writes:
In contrast, a doctor can refer to the wrongness of
abortion as an intelligible reason for refusing a
patient, without thereby losing moral and intellectual
respect. There is a real debate to be had about abor-
tion, whereas there is no debate about racism. Abor-
tion is one of several legitimate �fault lines� in the
public moral consensus, where each side has a prima
facie respectable point of view, and there are no
grounds for thinking that one side is necessarily
ignorant or prejudiced in some way.26
Cowley is also confused about the role of judgments
of moral wrongness in medicine and the delivery of med-
icine. One can (and some or many do) view the following
things as morally wrong:
1.
Contraception
2.
Abortion
3.
Euthanasia
4.
Failing to donate your organs
5.
Smoking, drinking and taking drugs

The list could go on and on. As one of us has argued
elsewhere, individual moral judgments about the rights and
wrongs of particular medical practices are by necessity
partly arbitrary. They are arbitrary in the sense that their
moral basis cannot be conclusively evaluated for soundness
(an impossibility when it comes to religious convictions, for
instance). In some of these cases, there can be reasonable
disagreement about whether the practice is right or wrong.
As a result of this, pretty much any conscience view that is
the result of some deliberation and is claimed to be held
deeply and sincerely �counts�. This view is, in fact, shared
by the Courts in most English speaking jurisdictions.27
Cowley and others like him have no means to distinguish
the conscientious objection to providing medical aid in
dying from providing IVF to homosexual patients (where
the objection is to perceived complicity in same- sex parent-
hood rather than to IVF per se). It is true that societies
draw lines in the sand with regard to what kinds of views
they accommodate at a certain point in history, but these
lines are by necessity at least partly arbitrary, too. The only
means Cowley could use to explain why medical aid in
dying and abortion are �different� would be an argument
not from conscience but from tradition. Arguments from
tradition carry, of course, no normative weight.
If a service a doctor is requested to perform is a medi-
cal practice, is legal, consistent with distributive justice,
requested by the patient or their appointed surrogate,
and is plausibly in their interests, the doctor must ensure
the patient has access to it. It is then irrelevant how
defensible the doctor�s own moral take on the patient�s
actions is. We might even agree with the doctor over
whether a particular practice is morally wrong. For all
practical intent and purposes that is irrelevant to their
obligations as professionals vis-a-vis the patient.
ETHICAL RELATIVISM AND EVIL
At the heart of the paradox of conscientious objection is
arguably a belief in ethical relativism.28 Ethical relativism
is probably the dominant view of ethical statements in
the lay and professional public. Put simply, value is in
the eye of the beholder. Ethical relativism is the view
that the truth of ethical statements - such as abortion is
wrong - is dependent on, or relative to, the culture, group
or individual making the statement. Ethics is relative to
groups, cultures or times.
But ethical relativism is practically ethical nihilism. If
one accepted ethical relativism, the holocaust was, from
the Nazi�s perspective, right. It is just that today we have
a different set of values from the Nazis. As the Nazi
example demonstrates, we have reason to be profoundly
uncomfortable with ethical relativism, even though it is
often considered the politically correct thing to be an
ethical relativist.
Part of the force behind respecting conscientious
objection is a common commitment to ethical relativism:
if that is what someone believes, then they are right to
believe it, and that alone makes it a kind of truth.
But we cannot escape arguments over what is right
when we discuss conscientious objection. We do want
doctors to act on their conscience when the stakes are
high, and their conscience is right: when they are asked
to be complicit in or participate in an evil. Nor do we
want what might loosely be called �unconscientious
objection�. That is, doctors mistakenly failing to provide
beneficial care on the basis of false moral beliefs. This is
the paradox of conscientious objection.
Here is one case of a valid conscientious objection that
deserves our respect. A United States Navy nurse refused
to force feed Guantanamo detainees, including Dhiab,
an inmate who was detained in Guantanamo from 2002
until December 2014, despite being approved for release
by the US government in 2009. Dhiab reported the
nurse�s actions as part of a legal case against the force-
feeding. According to Dhiab�s account the nurse initially
allowed prisoners not to be force fed if they were ill, but
later refused to participate at all. The nurse subsequently
underwent a number of internal investigations, including
the threat of court martial, before being returned to duty
earlier this year.29
Why do we applaud this conscientious objector, but
reject others, who may hold as strong views about abor-
tion as this nurse did about torture? It is trivially true
that torture is not a medical practice which is in the
interests of the patient or desired by the patient. Nor is it
legal. The argument in support of this conscientious
objector then is that the navy nurse was asked to perform

Doctors Have No Right to Refuse Medical Assistance in Dying, Abortion or Contraception 167

 a procedure that was not within the scope of nursing
practice. The patients in question were competent and
refused the procedure in question. The combination of
the procedure not being within the scope of professional
practice, and the patient not wanting the procedure
shows why this case does not map onto the conscientious
objection cases that we are concerned about. To reiterate:
What justified the nurse�s refusal to participate in the act
of torture was first and foremost that force-feeding was
(and is) not part and parcel of nursing�s professional
scope of practice. It would have been unprofessional to
force-feed the objecting prisoner. The objection was justi-
fied on professional grounds.
What if the contested practices really are evil? That is,
if we reject ethical relativism, but we are objectively
wrong about the morality of one or more of these cases.
We have used contraception as the major example
throughout the article. It is an area where conscientious
objection is applied. However, for many people it is not
a matter of any moral significance. For that reason,
Cowley and others primarily use abortion as their exam-
ple: it is an issue over which there is significantly greater
discomfort. So what if we are right about contraception
and the case of conscientious objection overall, but in
fact we are wrong about abortion, and the practice of
abortion is indeed evil, and akin to torture?
In that case, our current conscientious objection poli-
cies are in any case untenable: they only succeed if we
agree to ethical relativism. If authorizing an abortion
(for example) were really in itself evil (both objectively
and significantly immoral), it is hard to see how pro-
posed referral policies could be tenable. If the practice is
evil, the individual should not be any part of it, even by
being a member of that speciality or profession. If a doc-
tor views abortion as an evil, she should not be a gynae-
cologist or GP
.
There is a long debate about the morality of abortion,
which we do not have space to cover here. But most peo-
ple who believe contraception, abortion and euthanasia
are wrong don�t believe they are evil in the same way as,
for example torture or genocide are evil. If its rightness
or wrongness is of a type or degree that it is a matter of
personal preference (ethical relativism), it should not
have an impact on patient care. If it is objectively evil
then
the
solution
conscientious
objection
offers
is
inappropriate.
Cowley�s solution, while common in policies and regu-
lations in liberal Western democracies, is often sold to
the public as a reasonable compromise between those
denying conscientious objection rights and those who
insist on a right to refuse the provision of such medical
services. Cowley writes: �the GP can still refer to one of
her colleagues in the knowledge that she (the GP) is not
responsible for her colleague�s free actions, she is merely
describing a fact – a widely available fact, and hardly a
secret – of what her colleague is willing and able to do.�30
This strategy is clearly an unjustifiable compromise from
the perspective of the objector. If you believe that abor-
tion constitutes the murder of a human person, a
�compromise� that would oblige you to pass the pregnant
women on to a colleague who you know would be will-
ing to commit the �murder�, evidently does not constitute
a viable compromise. If abortion were not just something
that an individual happens to disagree with but is objec-
tively evil, then she should do everything she can to stop
her patient having an abortion.
There is another way in which relativism is relevant to
debates about conscientious objection. It is relativism
about the purposes of medicine. Cowley expresses this
when he writes eloquently, but mistakenly, in relation to
the �calling� of medicine:
In other words, it is not a contingent aversion to abortion
that she happens to hold, it is not a psychological quirk
that can and should be overcome, it is not some debating-
society posture that should be abandoned in the �real
world�, and it need not even be theologically motivated.
Rather, it has to do directly with the nature of medicine
as she understands and identifies with it, an understand-
ing that makes abortion objectively incompatible with
being a doctor as healer. For her, pregnancy is not simply
a disease or injury that needs medical treatment. The
important thing to stress here is that this understanding
of medicine is not at all bizarre or idiosyncratic.31
He goes on to praise the moral consciousness of con-
scientious objectors: �they deserve accommodation not
out of respect for their integrity, but rather out of respect
for their conception of medicine.�32
Breast-beating
stuff
to
be
sure,
but
substitute
�contraception� for �abortion� and this is indeed a �bizarre
and idiosyncratic� view of medicine. For example, �[aver-
sion to contraception] has to do directly with the nature
of medicine as she understands and identifies with it, an
understanding that makes [contraception] objectively
incompatible with being a doctor as healer.�
If you don�t believe contraception or sterilisation are
part of the modern practice of medicine, don�t become a
GP
. As one of us has argued elsewhere, even if there were
a strong �calling� to medicine or to a particular field within
medicine, people are still free to decline the call and do
something else with their lives. If they were not free to
make that choice, due to the strength of the �call�, it is
questionable that their decision to join the medical profes-
sion was truly an autonomous choice in the first place.33 It
is arguable that people with this view of their relationship

 to medicine would not be ideally suited to join the medical
profession. They have a higher power that they are serving
first in their medical practice, their vocation, which has
taken away their freedom to make informed choices. That
makes a mockery of their graduation promise to serve the
patient interest first and foremost: their understanding of
their vocation will always take priority.
SECULAR CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION
ALIVE AND WELL AND HOW SECULAR
DOCTORS OUGHT TO REIGN IN THEIR
VALUES TOO
Today there is a shortage of organs for transplantation
purposes. Despite recent advances in assistive technolo-
gies that have halved the waiting list mortality rate for
heart transplants, around 8% of children still die on the
waiting list.34 Children with chromosomal abnormalities
such as Down Syndrome and Trisomy 18 sometimes
require heart transplantation following heart failure
related to congenital abnormalities. Because these chil-
dren have intellectual disability, in some cases severe,
they are sometimes not placed on the waiting list for
heart transplantation. Reasons for not doing so can
include medical reasons such as the ability to understand
and follow post-operative treatment regimes,35 although
increasingly, good outcomes from transplantation are
reported.36 However, a number of cases have been
reported where the refusal appears to be an expression of
a particular view of distributive justice held by their
treating doctors that discounts the quality or the value of
life of those with intellectual disabilities against those
without when calculating the distribution of resources to
achieve the greatest good.37
However, this practice is in direct contravention of the
stated principle of most international guidance and prin-
ciples of egalitarianism that underpin public health sys-
tems. Such children need a heart transplant and should
have an equal chance of getting one.38
Here we have a secular conflict between some doctors�
values (utilitarianism) and a stated health care policy
(egalitarianism). Following our logic, such doctors ought
to place children with Down�s Syndrome and Trisomy 18
on waiting lists for heart transplantation and give them
an equal chance of such a transplant. If they believe
principles
of
distributive
justice
are
being
applied
unjustly in current healthcare policy, they should cam-
paign for such a reform in their governing policy. At
present, a doctor who refused to apply policies which
consider medical need only in allocating resources would
be unjustly discriminating against their patient. Failure
to list for transplantation children with intellectual dis-
ability, even in severe cases such as Trisomy 18, based on
utilitarian values is a secular example of objectionable
conscientious objection.
LESSONS FROM THE NETHERLANDS?
Cowley lauds the success of the Dutch system of a regis-
ter of doctors willing to perform euthanasia.39 As he
notes, this works because there are plenty of doctors,
knowledge of such a register is widespread and the Neth-
erlands is a small country. But is this an appropriate
solution to the problems caused by conscientious objec-
tors? To create a register of doctors willing to prescribe
contraception? Why should scarce health care resources
be expended on such a system only to support what con-
stitutes unprofessional conduct by health care professio-
nals? Why should patients seeking a simple script for a
prescription contraceptive be inconvenienced in their
choice of doctor by such unprofessional conduct?
The problem with conscientious objection is that it has
been freely accommodated, if not encouraged, for far too
long.
It is important to understand that when doctors have
a monopoly over a procedure like surgery, it is not a
luxury that they can choose to give or withhold on per-
sonal
grounds.
There
are
criteria
around
justice,
autonomy and interests that determine whether it is pro-
vided. When contraception, abortion or euthanasia are
made legal and they become part and parcel of medical
services over which doctors have monopoly power,
patients do acquire a right to them.
PLURALISM ABOUT INTERESTS?
There is a last resort for the conscientious objector as
there is for any doctor who seeks to enforce his or her
values vis-a-vis the patient. This is called paternalism.
This is to claim the intervention is not in the patient�s
interests. Cowley clutches at this last straw:

Doctors Have No Right to Refuse Medical Assistance in Dying, Abortion or Contraception 169
V
C 2016 The Authors Bioethics Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd
 There is another way to put this. I referred above to
the patient�s right to medical treatment under a pub-
lic health system. But this does not include a right
to a particular treatment, e.g. one whose miraculous
properties the patient has just read about on the
Internet. The patient has a right to medical attention
to her symptoms and problems, but it will be for the
doctor, using her expertise, skills and judgement, to
decide on the most appropriate course(s) of treat-
ment. And it will be up to the hospital or health
service management to decide whether such a treat-
ment represents good value for public money. This is
a well-established principle of medical discretion.
The same principle can be applied to the case of
PAS in a jurisdiction such as the Netherlands where
it is legally permissible. The patient presents herself
to the doctor and demonstrates her fulfilment of the
six conditions, and informs her of her wish to com-
mit suicide. Under the principle of medical discre-
tion, it is for the doctor to decidewhether PAS is or
is not the most appropriate �treatment�.40
It is bizarre to liken medical aid in dying to a treat-
ment on the internet purported to have miraculous
effects. It is entirely clear what euthanasia is and what it
will achieve. And it is likely to be very good value for
public money when the alternative is continued medical
or social care given against a competent patient�s consid-
ered wishes.
But what of the claim that it is not in the patient�s
best interests? In the case of euthanasia, this is among
the more powerful arguments against providing it.
There are, however, three possible responses to this
objection to the provision of euthanasia. The first is to
argue interests should be subjectively defined. If a person
says their life is not worth living, it is not worth living.
This argument is problematic41 – people can be mistaken
about what is good for them and indeed whether their
life really is worth living. Precisely our valuing autonomy
might justifiably lead to the temporary overriding of
occurrent autonomy in order to preserve dispositional
autonomy, eg in cases of anorexia or morbid obesity.42
However, if the wish remains stable over time, and the
patient�s view of their quality of life remains stable, then
such a strong paternalistic approach becomes incompati-
ble with the values predominant in liberal democracies.
The second is to give up the idea that medicine is only
about promoting objective best interests. It is importantly
also about respecting patient autonomy. It is then suffi-
cient to show that a procedure is justified by distributive
justice and the person autonomously desires it. For
example, sterilisation of a young professional woman
may not be in her interests but should still be provided if
she autonomously desires it.
Thirdly, patients in liberal Western democracies clearly
have a right to suicide, including by refusal of eating and
drinking.43 Given that they will be able to end their lives
if they pursue this course of action, their interests are
better served by medical aid in dying. This is because
medical aid in dying would result in a better death for
such a patient than him- or herself starving to death or
dying of dehydration.44
This discussion is, ultimately, irrelevant in jurisdictions
that have decriminalized assisted dying. Legislators or
courts, always with overwhelming public support, have
determined that particular patients have a right to access
medical aid in dying. If patients meet the standards
defined in the relevant legislation, they are entitled to
access medical aid in dying, regardless of what a particu-
lar doctor thinks about their �best interest�.
CONCLUSION
Reasons and values are essential to medicine. Doctors
like others should have values that reasonably track what
is right. Individual values ought not to govern delivery of
health care at the bedside. Doctors can campaign for
policy or legal reform. They can also provide advice with
reasons, based on their values. But they have no claim to
special moral status that would permit them to deny
patients medical care that these patients are entitled to.
