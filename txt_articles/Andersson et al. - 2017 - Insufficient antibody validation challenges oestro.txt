The discovery of oestrogen receptor b (ERb/ESR2) was a landmark discovery. Its reported
expression and homology with breast cancer pharmacological target ERa (ESR1) raised
hopes for improved endocrine therapies. After 20 years of intense research, this has not
materialized. We here perform a rigorous validation of 13 anti-ERb antibodies, using
well-characterized controls and a panel of validation methods. We conclude that only
one
antibody,
the
rarely
used
monoclonal
PPZ0506,
specifically
targets
ERb
in
immunohistochemistry. Applying this antibody for protein expression profiling in 44 normal
and 21 malignant human tissues, we detect ERb protein in testis, ovary, lymphoid cells,
granulosa cell tumours, and a subset of malignant melanoma and thyroid cancers. We do not
find evidence of expression in normal or cancerous human breast. This expression pattern
aligns well with RNA-seq data, but contradicts a multitude of studies. Our study highlights
how inadequately validated antibodies can lead an exciting field astray.

 O
estrogen is a hormone with multiple roles in health and
physiology. Importantly, it drives breast cancer (BC)
growth and its inhibition is one of the most efficacious
BC treatments to date. Oestrogen signalling is mediated by two
oestrogen receptors that both belong to the nuclear receptor
superfamily: ERa (ESR1) and ERb (ESR2). ERa was identified in
1986 (refs 1,2), and became the first biomarker applied in
oncology. Approximately 70% of all BCs overexpress ERa, and
these tumours are targeted with selective oestrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene) or
compounds
that
reduce
endogenous
oestrogen
production
(aromatase inhibitors). Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC)
with a well-validated and specific antibody (1D5) is routinely
used
for
treatment-predictive
ERa
analysis
in
clinical
pathology3,4. Approximately 40% of ERa-positive BCs fail to
respond or develop resistance to endocrine treatment5. Thus,
upon the discovery of a second oestrogen receptor, ERb, in 1996
(ref. 6), this was met with a massive interest for its potential to
constitute a complementary treatment-predictive BC biomarker
and therapeutic target. Multiple studies have further suggested
ERb as a plausible target for endocrine treatment of various other
diseases, including benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer
and lung cancer7,8.
However, after 20 years of intense studies, the role of ERb and
even its distribution of tissue and cellular expression are still
unclear and debated. For example, variable ERb expression in BC
has
been
described
in
numerous
publications9–20,
with
contradicting correlations to clinical parameters (reviewed in
refs 21–23). In addition, most cell lines have been reported to lack
ERb mRNA22,24 (see also 45 cell lines analysed within the HPA
project,
http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000140009-ESR2/
cell),
while
antibody-based
applications
report
its
protein
expression25,26. This raises the pertinent question of antibody
specificity.
Despite the widespread use of IHC, no universal scheme has
been established to ascertain the functionality of an antibody
before its use. This is increasingly recognized as a factor
contributing to poor reproducibility of biomedical studies27,28.
Standard means of validating antibody specificity, such as using
pre-absorption with blocking peptide and/or western blot (WB)
are recognized as crude assessments: blocking peptide does not
control for unspecific binding in absence of the target protein,
and a band in western blotting could correspond to many
different proteins of approximately the same molecular weight. In
addition, a comparative study of WB and IHC has shown that the
performance of antibodies is application-dependent, and suggests
that each antibody should be validated for the application
it is intended for29. This is now reflected in recent guidelines
for application-dependent validation of antibodies presented by
the
ad
hoc
International
Working
Group
for
Antibody
Validation30.
Efforts have been made to validate ERb antibodies31–33, but as
a clear discrepancy between detectable mRNA and protein levels
remains, and broadly accepted antibodies against ERb generate
disconcordant expression patterns, these efforts appear to have
been
insufficient.
Our
study
aims
to
shed
light
on
the
controversies in this field by performing in-depth exploration of
the antibodies’ specificities and by defining accurate expression of
ERb. We use well-validated negative and positive controls and
apply
multiple
antibody-based
applications,
including
identification of bound protein by immunoprecipitation (IP)
followed by mass spectroscopy (MS), at a scale that has not been
previously undertaken. We demonstrate that only one of 13
antibodies is sufficiently specific in IHC. Applying this antibody,
PPZ0506, for protein expression profiling of 44 normal and 21
tumour tissues within the Human Protein Atlas project, we detect
ERb protein only in testis, ovary, placenta (weakly), lymphoid
cells, granulosa cell tumours, and a subset of malignant
melanoma and thyroid cancers. We do not find evidence of
expression in normal or cancerous human breast. This expression
pattern aligns well with RNA expression data, but contradicts a
multitude of studies. Our study highlights the importance of
adequately validated antibodies.
Results
Most ERb antibodies show false positivity. To evaluate the
specificity
of
ERb-targeting
antibodies,
we
screened
13
commercially available or in-house produced antibodies (Fig. 1;
Supplementary Table 1), including the two most commonly used
ones (monoclonals PPG5/10 and 14C8). Formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded
(FFPE)
tissue
specimens
are
the
most
prominent sample type at clinical pathology departments, and is
thereby the format for which a clinically relevant antibody must
be functional. Therefore, we first performed IHC on a validation
tissue microarray (TMA) that included a panel of FFPE tissues
and control cell lines (Supplementary Table 2). The cell line panel
comprised four cell lines. The colon cancer HCT116 and BC
T47D cell lines, which were confirmed to not express ERb mRNA
using RNA-seq (o 1 Fragments Per Kilobase and Million, FPKM,
in this study), and qPCR34. HCT116 has also been shown to lack
capacity to bind oestrogen according to competitive radioactive
ligand-binding assay35. T47D is positive for ERa while HCT116 is
not. Corresponding cell lines employing lentivirus-engineered
expression of FLAG-tagged ERb, were included as positive
controls. The resultant expression and function of ERb has been
validated previously using multiple technologies34–36. Two mouse
monoclonal
antibodies
(mAbs),
PPZ0506
and
14C8,
both
displayed
the
expected
nuclear
staining
in
the
two
ERb-expressing
control
cell
lines,
along
with
absence
of
positivity in the ERb-negative control cell lines (Fig. 2a).
However, 14C8 stained relatively few cells compared to the
staining generated with PPZ0506. The remaining 11 anti-ERb
antibodies, including the widely used mAb PPG5/10 (Fig. 2a), all
failed the IHC validation step since they generated distinct
positive IHC staining in ERb-negative cell lines.
A few selected tissues were also included in the validation
TMA
in
order
to
control
for
representative
staining
quality (Supplementary Table 2). In these tissues, the PPZ0506
and 14C8 antibodies both stained a few cell nuclei in tonsil
and
Leydig
cells
in
testis.
Both
also
stained
peripheral
lymphocytes - PPZ0506 mainly in GI-tract and 14C8 in most
normal tissues and cancers. Clone 14C8 displayed additional
nuclear positivity in BC and colorectal cancer tissue which
PPZ0506 did not. PPG5/10 showed a clear and widespread
nuclear staining in tonsil, and in all Leydig cells and cells in
seminiferous ducts in testis, as well as in non-malignant breast
tissue, in BC, and in lymphocytes and glandular cells in GI-tract
tissues. The staining patterns for both 14C8 and PPG5/10
correlated well with previously published reports using the
respective antibodies. We could not find published studies
applying PPZ0506 on clinical material, but observed that its
staining pattern was notably more restricted than that of the other
two antibodies.
For comparison and validation of protocols, the clinically
approved ERa antibody (1D5) was analysed in the same manner.
1D5 displayed nuclear positivity in the ERa-positive cell line
(T47D, Fig. 2a), along with expected staining in BC cases
previously
determined
to
be
ERa-positive
during
clinical
pathology assessment, in non-malignant breast tissue, and in a
subset of cells in the germinal center of tonsil. No staining of the
ERa-negative control cells (HCT116) was seen with this antibody.

 Thus the ERa comparison demonstrated that the set-up and
methodology performed as expected.
We conclude that out of the 13 ERb-targeting antibodies
only two, PPZ0506 and 14C8, appear to specifically target ERb
in
FFPE-treated
cell
lines.
These
two,
however,
give
a
partially divergent staining pattern in tissues. The commonly
used PPG5/10 was highly unspecific (Fig. 2a).
Two antibodies recognize correct target in WB assay. Although
it is recognized that antibody performance is application
dependent, WB remains the most commonly used assay for
assuring specificity. To validate that the anti-ERb antibodies 14C8
and
PPZ0506
bind
ERb,
and
to
further
explore
the
performance of clone PPG5/10, these three antibodies were
subjected to an extended antibody validation, including WB assay
on positive and negative control cells (Fig. 2b; Supplementary
Fig. 1). Recombinant ERb protein (59 kDa) was included in a
separate lane as reference. The PPZ0506 ERb antibody displayed
a single band of the expected size (60 kDa, the molecular weight
of the expressed FLAG-tagged ERb isoform 1) in lysates from
positive control cells, and no distinct bands in the negative
controls. Using clone 14C8, multiple bands including one of the
correct size (59–60 kDa) were seen. This band was stronger in the
positive control, but evident also in the negative control.
However, storage for months of the 14C8 antibody rendered this
antibody unable to recognize recombinant ERb and subsequently
the difference in intensity between the positive and negative
control was no longer distinguishable (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
The PPG5/10 antibody generated a strong unspecific band
corresponding to 75–100 kDa, a molecular weight significantly
larger than the ERb protein in both positive and negative controls
and did not show specificity for ERb. A weak band similar to
the correct size could occasionally be noted, in both positive
and negative cells, along with a very weak detection of the
recombinant ERb (Fig. 2b) but this was usually not present
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). WB using the ERa antibody clone 1D5
resulted in a single band corresponding to the expected size of
ERa isoform 1 (66 kDa) in ERa-positive control cells only
(Fig. 2b, right panel).
The results generated with the three ERb antibodies using IHC
and WB are not congruent. PPZ0506 and 14C8 both yielded the
expected staining pattern using IHC on control cells, but 14C8
stained tissues that PPZ0506 did not and appears to also target
additional proteins in WB. PPZ0506 did not generate false
positivity in control cells in either IHC or WB, but did not stain
tissues that are considered ERb positive in the literature (most,
however, based on previous analysis with antibodies 14C8 and
PPG5/10). PPG5/10 displayed false positivity in IHC, and was
also unspecific in the WB assay.
Mass spectrometry analysis confirms affinity of PPZ0506. In
order to identify whether ERb was indeed bound by these three
antibodies, we performed IP followed by gel separation and MS.
Sections corresponding to 50–80 kDa, encompassing the mole-
cular weights of both ERa and ERb, were analysed by MS in IP:s
from a positive control cell line (ERa-negative HCT116 with
transduced ERb expression) in replicated experiments for each
antibody. In concordance with the supportive IHC and WB
results, the IP-MS analysis demonstrated, with a high level of
confidence, that PPZ0506 binds ERb (Fig. 2c; Supplementary
Data 1). For the 14C8 and PPG5/10 antibodies, no significant
ERb hits were obtained when searching the human database. ERb
could however be detected at low confidence level in one of the
two 14C8 replicates when adopting a directed search with an in-
house constructed FASTA library (Supplementary Table 3). The
methodology control showed that ERa bound by antibody 1D5
could be detected by IP-MS, consistent with IHC and WB results
(Fig. 2c; Supplementary Data 1).
We conclude that PPZ0506 robustly binds to ERb protein, and
that 14C8 may bind in a less reproducible fashion. We did not
detect binding of ERb by PPG5/10, and this correlates with our
observation that this antibody did not clearly detect ERb in
neither WB nor IHC analysis.
Unspecific
bindings
by
14C8
and
PPG5/10
identified.
To identify unspecific bindings, peptides in the 50–80 kDa band
as well as other bands visible on Coomassie brilliant blue-stained
gel or WB were analysed by IP-MS, in both positive (HCT116
with transduced ERb expression) and negative (ERa-positive
T47D with no ERb expression) control cells. Detailed results are
provided as Supplementary Data 1. We found that ERb protein
was the dominating protein bound by PPZ0506. One more
protein, WDCP, was detected in the MS analysis in both
replicates of the positive control but not in the negative control,
and only traces of other proteins were detected (Fig. 2c;
Supplementary Data 1). However, ERb was by far not the
dominating protein in the IP-MS samples using the 14C8
antibody. Instead, a protein of the POU transcription factor
family, POU2F1 (OCT1), was found with high significance in
each replicate of both the positive and negative controls and in
both the 50–80 kDa and 80–100 kDa gel bands. POU2F1 is a
nuclear protein, with several isoforms of various sizes, of which
one is nearly identical (58.7 kDa) to that of ERb (59 kDa).
The significant and robust hits for POU2F1 in the MS analyses
strongly indicate that 14C8 binds this protein. As the ERb
transcript in this positive control cell line is expressed at four
times higher level (FPKM ¼ 25) than POU2F1 (FPKM ¼ 6), 14C8
appears to preferentially bind POU2F1 over ERb. For PPG5/10,

 the MS results indicate that this antibody targets a range of
other proteins (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Data 1), most of which
are nuclear according to gene ontology annotations. These
include the transcriptional activator EWSR1 and YTHDF3
detected in both replicates of both positive and negative controls.
We conclude that 14C8 appears to preferentially target POU2F1
over ERb, and PPG5/10 targets multiple nuclear proteins but
not ERb.
IHC with PPZ0506 is congruent with ERb transcripts. As part
of a global expression profiling effort within the Human Protein
Atlas (HPA) project, RNA-seq has been performed in a large
panel of human normal and cancer tissues. These transcript
levels may serve as blueprint for ERb expression, guiding our
effort to identify a specific antibody. We noted that the transcript
data of normal tissues display a highly limited expression profile
for
ERb:

levels

testis,
adrenal
gland,
ovary,
the
GI-tract,
and
lymphoid
organs
(Fig.
3
and
http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000140009-ESR2/tissue).
We applied IHC with antibodies PPZ0506, 14C8 and PPG5/10,
respectively, on TMAs from the HPA encompassing 44 normal
tissues, each represented by tissue samples from 3 different
individuals (Supplementary Table 4).
With antibody PPZ0506, IHC positivity correlated well with
the tissues’ RNA expression and no staining was seen in tissues
lacking detectable transcript levels, except for in placenta where a
few weakly stained decidual nuclei could be observed. On the
contrary, antibodies 14C8 and PPG5/10 resulted in distinct
nuclear IHC positivity in a large number of tissues that did not
display detectable levels of ERb transcript. Figure 3a compiles the
IHC positivity alongside the transcript values, and offers an
overview of the congruency between transcript levels and
PPZ0506 IHC staining, while exposing a disconcordant pattern
when using antibodies 14C8 and PPG5/10. Corresponding data
for ERa, where staining were only detected in tissues demonstrat-
ing high levels of mRNA, can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 2.
In Figure 3, representative IHC images, generated with each of
the three ERb antibodies, are shown for a subset of tissues. The

 In summary, we present evidence that when using IHC on FFPE
tissues and cells, only PPZ0506 generate positivity supported by
transcript levels.
ERb is expressed in endocrine and lymphoid tissues. IHC serves
as the golden standard of spatially resolved protein detection in
tissues. After identifying PPZ0506 as a specific antibody for ERb,
we set out to map the expression pattern of ERb in normal tissues
and in a panel of common types of cancer. In addition to the 44
normal tissues (n ¼ 3) above, we also analysed 21 malignant
tumour types, (n ¼ 4–12, Supplementary Table 4). As illustrated
in Figs 3 and 4, and summarized in Table 1, IHC revealed nuclear
ERb expression in glandular cells of adrenal gland, granulosa cells
in ovary, Leydig cells of the testis, and lymphocytes in secondary
lymphoid organs, including tonsil, lymph nodes, and spleen, as
well as in peripheral lymphocytes primarily in the intestinal tract.
Most cancers did not display ERb staining. However, in four out
of five granulosa cell tumour cases, pronounced and distinct
nuclear positivity was displayed in a substantial subset of tumour
cells (Fig. 4i–k). Further, low to moderate expression was seen in
a small subset of cells in 2 out of 12 cases of melanoma (Fig. 4m),
and in 1 out of 4 cases of thyroid cancer (Fig. 4p). Positivity was
also found in stromal cells in selected cases.
Altogether, ERb was detected in 6 cell types in the 44 analysed
normal tissues, and in 3 out of 21 cancer types examined (Figs 3
and 4; Table 1), with an emphasis on granulosa cell tumours,
reproductive
organs
(testis
and
ovary),
lymphocytes
and
lymphoid organs.
ERb expression is not detected in breast tissues. As described
above, IHC with clone PPZ0506 did not detect ERb expression in
normal breast or BC. This contradicts multiple studies, most of
which have used antibodies 14C8 and PPG5/10 in IHC, and
reported widespread ERb expression in normal breast and
BC (data compiled in Fig. 5a). No IHC studies concluding
ERb expression in breast cohorts have used the PPZ0506
antibody, the only truly specific antibody in our analysis. It is
possible that the reported expression, or part of it, is due to
unspecific staining. In order to look further into this discrepancy
we evaluated whether compiled data on transcript levels of ERb in
a large number of BC samples might support IHC-positivity in
some subgroups. A meta-analysis of RNA-seq data from 995 BC
tumours and 99 normal breast tissues from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA)38 is compiled in Fig. 5b. We have also included
levels for the related ERa, for which functionally consequences at
the protein level can be deduced: Tumours that stain for ERa in

 protocols, denoted ‘ERa þ ’ in Fig. 5b) respond to endocrine
treatment, whereas ERa-negative tumours do not. From this data
we
can
estimate
that
an
average
ERa
mRNA
levels
of
6-9log2[RSEMx106 þ 1] resulted in detectable levels of protein, and
that levels o4.0log2[RSEMx106 þ 1] typically did not generate
detectable protein expression (Fig. 5b). As visualized in Fig. 5b,
ERb transcripts levels were less than 3.0log2[RSEMx106 þ 1] in
all normal and tumour samples, with the majority being
o1.0log2[RSEMx106 þ 1]. It is evident that transcript levels of ERb
are substantially lower, and that none of the 995 breast tumours,
99 normal breast specimens, or 7 distant metastases exhibit ERb
transcript levels expected to result in protein levels of detectable
or functional consequences. Further, data from 214 normal breast
tissues included in the GTEx data, show an average expression of
ERb transcripts less than 0.5 RPKM (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Thus, we noted no subgroup of patients that had distinguishably
higher levels, which could have indicated protein expression. We
conclude that the lack of ERb protein detection that we observe in
normal breast and BC using IHC with PPZ0506 is supported by
low to absent mRNA levels.
Discussion
A lack of standardized guidelines for determining the specificity
and functionality of antibodies has caused great discrepancies,
lack of reproducibility, generation of dubious data, and significant
amounts of wasted resources27,28. We here highlight the field of
ERb as an example of this problem. The inability to stringently
detect this protein, as identified in this study, is likely one of
the reasons for the lack of therapeutic success. As demonstrated
in
our
study,
the
use
of
unspecific
antibodies
for
ERb
detection remains a major obstacle in the field and, as a
consequence, it is difficult to postulate and study its functional
role and impact.
Only one antibody, PPZ0506, was demonstrated to target ERb
specifically
using
different
affinity-based
applications
and
controls (Figs 2 and 3; Supplementary Data 1). The other
antibodies stained ERb-negative cells and tissues and gave
unspecific bands in WB or in Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of
IPs. We used a semi-GeLC-MS approach to identify potential
binders in corresponding IPs. One additional protein bound by
PPZ0506, WDCP, was present only together with ERb. While this
could be an unspecific binding, we note that WDCP binds kinases
and has been reported to interact with the SRC homology
domain39, and that the kinase SRC is a known ERb-binding
co-activator40. Thus, it is not inconceivable that the IP-MS
detection of WDCP here indicates a true protein-protein
interaction rather than unspecific binding. While PPZ0506
has been less used, 14C8 is the most referenced antibody
for
ERb
in
Antibodypedia
(http://www.antibodypedia.com/
gene/11874/ESR2)
and
several
previous
reports
find
this
antibody to work well41–46. We, however, noted that not only
did 14C8 stain tissues that lack ERb when applied in IHC, it also
generated a band of the expected size in WB of negative controls
that could easily be mistaken for ERb. IP followed by MS
indicated a greater affinity for the transcription factor POU2F1,
which was consistently detected in the band ranges 50–80 and
100–120 kDa. POU2F1 is widely expressed, including in BC
(Supplementary Fig. 4), and is implicated as a prognostic factor in
prostate and gastric cancer47,48. Our study shows that applying
this antibody with the aim of identifying ERb can be misleading
(Figs 2 and 3). The PPG5/10 antibody was found to target
multiple nuclear proteins, including RNA-binding proteins
(EWSR1 and YTHDF3), SWI/SNF family-member ARID1A,
and several SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent
regulators of chromatin subfamilies (SMARC proteins). Our
findings can explain the clear nuclear staining these two
antibodies
generate
in
several
tissues
in
absence
of
corresponding ERb mRNAs. In Supplementary Data 1 we
provide extended information of proposed specific, unspecific,
and general binders (for example, MAP4, HSPA8, HSPA9), as
generated by the IP-MS analysis for PPZ0506, 14C8, PPG5/10
and ERa antibody 1D5, and also highlight common MS
contaminants49. As we did not analyse the ranges were no
bands were visible in the IP-MS analysis, some less abundant
binders may not have been detected.
Our results illustrate one example where the absolute majority
of antibodies directed towards a protein were unspecific in IHC
(12 out of 13; 92%). Considering the many studies that are
performed on tissues that, according to results presented here, do
not express the protein, this is an important negative finding.
Some of the antibodies evaluated in this study have been
validated to various extends by the vendors. Recombinant protein
is occasionally used (Upstate for Clone 68-4) and some show WB
of cells transfected with ERb (such as GeneTex for 14C8).
Although such validations show that the antibody can detect its
intended target when it is overexpressed, it does not demonstrate
specificity under endogenous conditions. Other companies use

 WB of cell lines that do not express ERb (such as HeLa, MCF-7,
Hek293), but still demonstrate clear strong bands of expected size
(e.g. Abcam for Ab137381 and Ab133467, Upstate for Clone
68-4). While for example PPG5/10 has been reported to not work
well in the WB application, it has still been considered specific in
IHC applications32, and several vendors refer predominantly to
supporting
IHC
results
(e.g.
Biorad
PPG5/10,
DAKO,
Thermofisher, Novus, Abcam). As illustrated in this study,
these validations appear insufficient.
Our results corroborates previous studies that, based on
RT-PCR, found the highest mRNA expression of ERb in ovary,
testis50 and granulosa cell tumours51. In high concordance with
our results, studies have also described ERb protein expression in
granulosa cells of the ovary and Leydig cells of the testis52.
The latter study performed IHC using a rabbit pAb (06–629,
Upstate Biotechnology), which thus appears to have generated
results in accordance with PPZ0506. However, the same study
also described staining of the prostate, something we could not
detect and which was not supported by transcript levels (Figs 3
and 4; Supplementary Fig. 3). The Upstate antibody was directed
against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 46–63
of the N terminus of human ERb. For comparison, the PPZ0506
was generated towards amino acids 2–88. As the Upstate
antibody was a polyclonal, it was a limited recourse and the
same batch is no longer available. Current antibodies from
Upstate did not score well in our analysis. As implicated by its
expression in reproductive organs, an effect of ERb on human
fertility
is
plausible.
Corrresponding
effect
has
also
been
demonstrated
in
knockout
animals,
where
females
are
sub-fertile53–55. Impact on fertility is one of few functional ERb
effects that are widely accepted and reproducible (reviewed in
ref. 56). Further, our data presented here support studies of ERb
as a potential biomarker in granulosa cell tumours, and in a
subset of melanoma and thryroid tumours.

 As ERb was originally cloned from a rat prostate cDNA
library6, its expression and functions in the prostate have been
studied
extensively.
IHC,
using
the
PPG5/10
and
other
antibodies, have determined ERb expression in both normal
prostate and in prostate cancer57, and ERb-positivity has been
correlated to primary Gleason grade and Gleason score in
prostate cancer26. However, its role in prostate cancer remains
unclear (reviewed in ref. 58), and our analysis with the PPZ0506
antibody did not corroborate significant expression in the human
prostate. ERb mRNA did not reach detectable levels in the three
individuals included in the HPA expression profiling using
RNA-seq (Fig. 3, left panel). GTEx data show mRNA expression
in normal prostate to be similar to levels in bladder and spleen
(approx. 0.5 RPKM, Supplementary Fig. 3), although higher in
some individuals. It is possible that there are species-related
differences in the expression of ERb or that analysis of larger
cohorts may determine expression in a minority of cases.
Although multiple studies report expression of ERb in BC,
our
conclusion
is
that
the
antibodies
used
to
detect
abundant expression of ERb in breast and other tissues are not
sufficiently
specific.
Similar
IHC-based
studies
have
also
described ERb protein expression in numerous other tissues,
including lung and brain (reviewed in ref. 8), although expression
of ERb transcript appears to be very limited or absent (Human
protein
atlas:
http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000140009-
ESR2/tissue; GTEX: http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/ESR2;
BioGPS: http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&id=2100). IHC with
PPZ0506 in our study did not detect protein expression in these
tissues.
Finally, several isoforms of ERb has been annotated. Isoform 2
(ERbcx), 4, and 5 all differ from isoform 1 by their C-terminal
region, but are otherwise identical (Fig. 1). The PPZ0506 and
14C8 antibodies are both directed towards the N-terminal region,
and would thus target all isoforms. PPG5/10, on the other hand,
is one of few antibodies directed solely towards isoform 1, as its
epitope is in the C-terminal end of the ERb protein (Fig. 1). This
is one reason this antibody is favoured in many studies. However,
our positive controls specifically express isoform 1 and the poor
specificity of this antibody when applied in IHC, as demonstrated
here, is deeply concerning.
We conclude that the PPZ0506 constitutes a specific but not
frequently used ERb antibody. Applying this antibody, we
demonstrate that the ERb protein is expressed in a limited
number of normal and cancer tissue types, with the highest
expression detected in granulosa cell tumours. Expression in most
human tissues, including in breast and prostate, was undetectable.
Although the tissue staining pattern generated with the antibodies
14C8 and PPG5/10 in our study correlated well to previous
reports, we could demonstrate that these antibodies stain multiple
tissues that lack detectable transcript levels. Our results imply that
numerous published studies with broadly accepted anti-ERb
antibodies have described ERb expression incorrectly. While our
study focuses on ERb, we do not think that antibodies towards
ERb are significantly poorer than those targeting other proteins,
and it is not unlikely that this problem generates similar obstacles
in many other fields. Our study illustrates the consequences of
using antibodies not specific for the intended targets. We wish to
argue for the need of a more thorough validation from the
vendors, and a higher level of consciousness among buyers, about
the fact that each antibody must be validated for its intended
application using proper controls.
Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. Four control cell lines with defined expression
of ERa and/or ERb (Supplementary Table 2) were used for evaluation of the panel
of antibodies (Supplementary Table 1). The ductal BC cell line T47D expresses ERa
but not ERb, while colon cancer cell line HCT116 does not express either of the
ER-receptors. As no cell line exist with a significant expression of ERb (ref. 24), we
used cell lines (originally acquired from ATCC, Rockville, MD) which has
previously been transduced to express full length ERb, and with corresponding
controls (Mock)36. The resulting ERb mRNA has been sequenced, and the protein
has been shown to be expressed, bind ligand, and have functional effects34–36,59.
We used these four control cell lines: T47D-ERb (ERa þ /ERb þ ), T47D-Mock
(ERa þ /ERb � ), HCT116-ERb (ERa � /ERb þ ) and HCT116-Mock
(ERa � /ERb � ) as positive and negative controls. T47D cells were cultured in 50%
DMEM low glucose (SIGMA, ref D6046) and 50% F-12 (SIGMA, ref N6658) and
HCT116 cells in RPMI-1640 (SIGMA, ref R0883). Both media were supplemented
with 5% FBS (Gibco, ref 10270), 1% PEST (SIGMA, ref P0781), as well as
Blasticidin (5 mg ml � 1; Invitrogen, ref R210-01) to maintain ERb expression in
transduced cells.
Harvesting and protein extraction. Subconfluent (70%) cells were harvested
using a Non-Interfering Protein Assay Kit (Calbiochem, ref 488250) and protein
extraction was performed using either ProteoExtract Complete Mammalian
Proteome Extraction Kit (Calbiochem, ref 53977) according to the manufacturers’
instructions, or RIPA-buffer (Sigma, ref R0278) with 1% Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Sigma, ref P8340) and 0.15% Benzonase (Calbiochem, ref KP31255).
For RIPA-buffer, frozen cell pellets were resuspended in the supplemented
RIPA-buffer and incubated for 20 min at 4 �C followed by centrifugation at 21,000
rcf at 4 �C. Protein extract supernatants were stored at � 70 �C.
Tissue microarray. Human tissue samples used for protein and mRNA expression
analyses were collected and handled as routinely performed within HPA. In short,
tissues were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Uppsala University
Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden as part of the sample collection governed by the
Uppsala Biobank (http://www.uppsalabiobank.uu.se/en/). All human tissue
samples used in the present study were de-identified in accordance with Swedish
laws and regulations, and approval and advisory from the Uppsala Ethical Review
Board (Reference # 2002–577, 2005–338, 2007–159, and 2011–473). FFPE tissue
samples were collected from the pathology archives based on hematoxylin-eosin
(HE) stained tissue sections showing representative normal histology for each
tissue type. Representative cores (1 mm diameter) were sampled from the FFPE
blocks and assembled into TMAs. Control cell lines were also included and
processed through formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded procedures60, and aims to
mimic standard FFPE-treatment of tissue61. The validation TMA contained 8
tissue types as well as FFPE-processed control cell lines (Supplementary Table 2),
and the profiling TMAs (n ¼ 9) included 44 normal tissue types and 21 different
cancer types (4–12 patient samples/cancer; Supplementary Table 4). The TMA
blocks were cut in 4-mm sections and placed on Superfrost Plus microscope slides
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; Fremont, CA), dried in RT overnight and baked in 50 �C
for 12–24 h before IHC.
Antibodies. Thirteen ERb antibodies: PPZ0506 Invitrogen (Catalogue number
417100, manufactured by Perseus proteomics PPMX); 14C8 Gene Tex
(GTX70174); PPG5/10 DAKO (M7292), BioRad (MCA1974G1), and Thermofisher

Upstate (05-824); ERb_503 (in-house); H150 Santa Cruz (sc-8974); N-terminal

Human Protein Atlas (in-house); ab3577 Abcam (ab3577); and one ERa antibody
(1D5, DAKO, M7047) were examined. Information about each antibody, including
lot numbers, is provided in Supplementary Table 1, and their epitopes are
illustrated in Fig. 1.
Immunohistochemistry. The TMA slides were deparaffinized in xylene, hydrated
in graded alcohols, and blocked for endogenous peroxidase for 5 min in 0.3% H2O2
diluted in 95% ethanol. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed in a
decloacing chamber (Biocare Medical; Walnut Creek, CA) at 121 �C for 10 min in
citrate buffer pH 6.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. TA-250-PM1X). The slides
were rinsed in distillated water, and immersed in wash buffer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, ref. TA-999-TT) containing 0.2% Tween 20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
ref. TA-125-TW) for 15 min to eliminate surface tension. The staining was
performed at room temperature in an automated instrument, Autostainer 480 S
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the slides washed with wash buffer between all
steps. The slides were incubated with UltraV block (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
ref. TA-125-UB) for 5 min, followed by primary antibody for 30 min (optimized for
dilutions between 1:50 and 1:1500, final dilutions used as indicated in
Supplementary Table 1 and in corresponding figure legends), primary antibody
enhancer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. TL-125-PB) for 20 min, UltraVision LP
HRP polymer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. TL-125-PH) for 30 min, and finally
diaminobenzidine (DAB; Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. TA-125-HDX) for 10 min.
The slides were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Histolab; Gothenburg,
Sweden, ref. 01820), dehydrated, and coverslipped using Pertex (Histolab,
ref. 00871.0500) in a Leica AutoStainer XL instrument.

 Annotation. Tissues included in the TMAs were manually annotated based on
observed nuclear positivity. Positive parenchymal cells and immune cells, fibroblast
and endothelial cells in stroma were categorized as weak, moderate or strong.
The estimated fraction of positive cells was described either as few (less than 25%),
medium (around 25–75%) or most (more than 75%). In Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Fig. 2, combinations of intensity and fraction were converted into a numeral score
(1–3) for each annotated tissue according to: 1 – weak/few, weak/medium or
moderate/few; 2 – weak/most, moderate/medium or strong/few; and 3 – moderate/
most, strong/medium or strong/most.
Western blot. Whole protein was extracted from three cell lines (HCT116-ERb,
HCT116-Mock and T47D-Mock) using RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The lysates were incubated on ice for
30 min, vortexed 10 min, and spun down at 13,000 r.p.m. at 4C for 20 min. Total
protein concentration was determined using DC protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad),
and included different BSA dilutions for standard curve. For each sample, 60 mg
protein was loaded in 4-20% SDS-precast protein gel (Bio-Rad). Recombinant full
length ERb (530 amino acids, –59 kDa) was used as additional positive control for
ERb detection and size determination. Protein ladder Precision Plus Protein
Kaleidoscope Prestained Protein Standards (#161-0375, BioRad) was used.
Separated proteins were then transferred to PVDF blot using Transblot Turbo
transfer kit for 10 min and Transblot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Transfer
efficiency was checked by immersing the blot in Ponceau S red staining (Fluka),
after which, the blot was destained by washing with TBST buffer. The blot was
blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature, washed
three times with TBST, 5 min each. Blots were incubated with different primary
antibodies against ERb: PPZ0506 (1:500 and 1:1,000), 14C8 (1:300, 1:500 and
1:1,000), PPG5/10 (1:200, 1:500 and 1:800) and for ERa: ID5 (1:1,000). B-actin
(Santa Cruz # SC-47778) was used as loading control. All primary antibodies
were mouse IgG isotypes and diluted in 1% NFDM-TBST. Anti-mouse IgG
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) was used and incubated with
the blot in 5% NFDM-TBST for 1 h at room temperature. To visualize the specific
bands, Clarity western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) was used and the images were
captured by ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad). WB was repeated at least
four times for each ERb antibody.
Immunoprecipitation. Two mg of each antibody were incubated at þ 4 �C for 4 h
with the protein extract. The antibody/protein-mix was further incubated at þ 4 �C
for 1 h with Dynabeads Protein G from the IP Kit (ref. 100.07D, Life technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). The beads were washed three times with washing buffer, and
the antibodies removed from the beads with elution buffer according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The samples were stored at � 70 �C. Two IP
replicates for each ERb antibody were performed at different occasions.
SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. SDS-PAGE, in-gel tryptic digestion and
LC–MS/MS analysis were performed as described by Sundberg et al.62 with some
adjustments. In short, the IP samples were suspended in a volume of 5 ml
5xLaemmli buffer with an addition of 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and were loaded on
an 18-well TGX Criterion precast gel, 4-20% (BioRad Laboratories). The
electrophoresis was run at 200 V for 45 min in Tris/glycine/SDS running buffer and
gels were stained with Coomassie blue R-250 (BioRad Laboratories), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Gel bands corresponding to 50–80 kDa, including the
molecular weights of ERa and ERb, and additional bands observed in WB or
SDS-PAGE (20–25, 80–120 and 120–135 kDa) were collected and divided into
smaller pieces (B1 mm3). Gel pieces were destained by washing (25 mM
NH4HCO3 and 100% CAN) twice or until sufficient colour had been removed, and
dried (SpeedVac system for 15 min). 10 mM DTT was added and incubated at
50 �C for 1 h, followed by 1 h incubation in 50 mM IAA at room temperature in
darkness. Then, washing and drying procedure was repeated. A solution of
12.5 ng ml � 1 trypsin was added and tryptic digestion performed overnight in
darkness at 37 �C. The solution was transferred to a new test tube and peptides
were extracted from gel slices in a solution of 60% ACN and 5% FA during
sonication for 5 min. That solution was pooled with the previous fraction and the
samples were completely dried in SpeedVac. The peptides were re-suspended in
20 ml of 0.1% FA and analysed on a nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro ETD mass
spectrometer. An EASY-nLCII system (ThermoFisherScientific) was used for the
on-line Nano-LC separation. 5 ml of the sample was loaded onto a pre-column
(EASY-Column, C18-A1, ThermoFisher Scientific) at a maximum pressure of
280 bar. The peptides were then eluted onto to an EASY-column (C18-A2,
ThermoFisher Scientific), used for the separation. The separation was performed at
a flow rate of 200 nl min � 1 using mobile phase A (0.1% FA) and B (99.9% CAN,
0.1% FA). A 2-step 90 min gradient, 2% B up 50% B in 75 min followed by wash
step of 100% B for 15 min was applied. The mass spectrometer was equipped with a
nano-flex ion source. The spray voltage was set to 2.0 kV. The instrument was
controlled through Tune2.6.0 and Xcalibur 2.1 and operated in data dependent
mode to automatically switch between high-resolution mass spectrum and low
resolution in the LTQ. The survey scan was performed from m/z 400– 2,000 at
100,000 resolution and the 10 most abundant ion peaks were CID fragmented for
each full scan cycle. The mass window for precursor ion selection was set to 1.9 Th.
Screening was done for charge state þ 2, þ 3 and þ 4 and the dynamic exclusion
was set to 30 s. Normalized collision energy of 35%, activation time of 10 ms and
activation q of 0.25 were set for MS/MS. The fragments were scanned at ‘normal
scan rate’ in the low-pressure cell of the ion trap and detected with a secondary
electron multiplier. Two replicated runs were performed with each of the three ERb
antibodies, and one with the ERa antibody.
Data analysis. For protein identification, Proteome Discoverer, version 1.4.1.14
(ThermoFisher Scientific) was used. A gene ontology (GO) (www.geneontolo-
gy.org) annotation was done with the support of the Proteome Discoverer software.
The searches were performed against the Uniprot human FASTA library
downloaded from www.uniprot.org (2013-12-02) applying Sequest HT in
combination with Percolator. Sequest HT searches were also conducted against a
smaller in-house constructed FASTA library containing only 29 oestrogen
receptor-related proteins (Supplementary Table 3) and for those searches, no
Percolator was used. These additional analyses were performed to detect possible
trace amounts of the target proteins. The parameters for the search were set to:
fixed modifications: carbamidomethyl (C), variable modifications: deamidated
(N, Q) and oxidation (M), precursor mass tolerance: 10 p.p.m., fragment mass
tolerance: 0.6 Da and maximum two missed cleavage sites. The S/N threshold was
set to 1.5. The search results were validated using the Percolator algorithm and an
FDR of 5%. A minimum of two unique peptides per protein was applied.
For analysis of TCGA data: RNA-seq data consisting of 946 breast tumour and
107 normal breast samples were acquired from TCGA38. Expression values were
normalized transcript count estimates, according to the RSEM algorithm for
RNA-seq analysis63. Expression was illustrated in Fig. 5b as violin plots, where
areas represent expression in the different BC subsets (luminal A, luminal B,
basal-like, normal-like and Her2-enriched, as well as divided by normal tissue,
primary tumour and metastasis), and lines across indicate median value.
Data availability. The MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange
Consortium via the PRIDE64 partner repository (data set identifier [PXD005936]).
Public RNA-seq data were accessed from the Human Protein Atlas
(proteinatlas.org), the GTEx Portal (http://gtexportal.org) and TCGA (now
available at the NCI’s Genomic Data Commons http://gdc.cancer.gov). RNA-seq
data for control cell lines are included in Supplementary Data 1 as FPKM values.
The complete set of immunohistochemistry images for PPZ0506 over human
normal and tumour tissues is scheduled for public release in the next version of the
Human Protein Atlas (proteinatlas.org, planned for Oct 2017).

In this Article, two papers are mistakenly listed as having made use of the antibody 14C8 instead of the antibody PPG5/10. In the
Discussion section, ref. 45 is incorrectly cited as having shown that the antibody 14C8 works well, and in Fig. 5a, Saunders et al. 2000 is
incorrectly depicted as using the 14C8 antibody. Both these papers used antibody PPG5/10 and neither paper includes experiments
using 14C8. A corrected version of Fig. 5 appears below as Fig. 1.
