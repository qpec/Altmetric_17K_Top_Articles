Context:
Stress fractures are injuries caused by cumulative,
repetitive stress that leads to abnormal bone remodeling.
Specific populations, including female athletes and endurance
athletes, are at higher risk than the general athletic population.
Whereas more than 460 000 individuals participate in collegiate
athletics in the United States, no large study has been
conducted to determine the incidence of stress fractures in
collegiate athletes.
Objective:
To assess the incidence of stress fractures in
National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletes and
investigate rates and patterns overall and by sport.
Design:
Descriptive epidemiology study.
Setting:
National Collegiate Athletic Association institutions.
Patients or Other Participants:
National Collegiate Athletic
Association athletes.
Intervention(s):
Data were analyzed from the NCAA Injury
Surveillance Program for the academic years 2004–2005
through 2013–2014.
Main Outcome Measure(s):
Injury rates and rate ratios
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results:
A total of 671 stress fractures were reported over
11 778 145 athlete-exposures (AEs) for an overall injury rate of
5.70 per 100 000 AEs. The sports with the highest rates of stress
fractures were women’s cross-country (28.59/100 000 AEs),
women’s gymnastics, (25.58/100 000 AEs), and women’s
outdoor track (22.26/100 000 AEs). Among sex-comparable
sports (baseball/softball, basketball, cross-country, ice hockey,
lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, indoor track, and
outdoor track), stress fracture rates were higher in women (9.13/
100 000 AEs) than in men (4.44/100 000 AEs; RR ¼ 2.06; 95%
CI ¼ 1.71, 2.47). Overall, stress fracture rates for these NCAA
athletes were higher in the preseason (7.30/100 000 AEs) than
in the regular season (5.12/100 000 AEs; RR ¼ 1.43; 95% CI ¼
1.22, 1.67). The metatarsals (n ¼ 254, 37.9%), tibia (n ¼ 147,
21.9%), and lower back/lumbar spine/pelvis (n ¼ 81, 12.1%)
were the most common locations of injury. Overall, 21.5% (n ¼
144) of stress fractures were recurrent injuries, and 20.7% (n ¼
139) were season-ending injuries.
Conclusions:
Women experienced stress fractures at
higher rates than men, more often in the preseason, and
predominantly in the foot and lower leg. Researchers should
continue to investigate biological and biomechanical risk factors
for these injuries as well as prevention interventions.
Key Words:
injury incidence, overuse injuries, bone remod-
eling
Key Points
� Stress fracture rates were highest among endurance sports and higher in female than in male collegiate athletes.
� Among female athletes, stress fracture rates were highest in basketball, cross-country, soccer, indoor track, and
outdoor track.
� The rate of recurrent stress fracture was 22% and of season-ending injury was 20%.

tress fractures, defined as microfractures of cortical
bone tissue, affect thousands of athletes per year.1–3
Certain subpopulations, including runners, gymnasts,
and female athletes, are known to exhibit higher rates of
stress fractures.4–9
These injuries affect a young athlete’s health and sport
participation in the short term and potentially also in the
long term. They result from abnormal bone remodeling in
the presence of repetitive stresses or impacts.10,11 Bone
remodeling is regulated through hormonal signals. A
negative energy balance, caused by inadequate caloric
intake relative to energy expenditure, can disrupt this
process.12,13 In the short term, stress fractures often require
a minimum of several weeks of recovery14 and may
necessitate removal from sport participation. If left
untreated, a stress fracture can progress to a complete
fracture of a bone, which may require surgical fixation.15 In
addition, factors contributing to stress fractures increase the
risk for osteoporosis,16 a substantial long-term health
concern.

Currently, more than 460 000 athletes participate in
National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sports
in the United States,17 but limited stress fracture research
has been conducted on this population. Much of our
epidemiologic knowledge about stress fractures has been
informed by research on military recruits5,6 and high
school athletes.9 Studies involving collegiate athletes
have been focused solely on endurance athletes, with
results limited by cross-sectional designs and small
sample sizes.1,12,18,19 Therefore, the purpose of our study
was to assess the incidence of stress fractures in NCAA
athletes and investigate trends in specific subpopulations.
By examining rates among athletes in 25 sports over a
10-year period, we sought to provide a more compre-
hensive understanding of the epidemiology of stress
fractures to inform future research and prevention
efforts.
METHODS
Data from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program
(NCAA-ISP) were analyzed. The methods of the NCAA-
ISP during the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 academic
years have been described20 and are briefly summarized
here. The NCAA-ISP was initiated in 1982 as a paper-based
data-collection system to obtain information from colleges
on sport-related injuries in their athletes. Since 2004, data
collection has been conducted via electronic medical
records. Currently, information about the type of injury,
location, activity during injury, and time missed due to
injury is collected from athletes in 25 sports. The number of
individual programs providing data varies by sport and
year.
For our study, data from the 2004–2005 through 2013–
2014 academic years were limited to injuries with a
reported diagnosis of stress fracture. The study was
approved by the Research Review Board of the NCAA.
Data Collection
Athletic trainers (ATs) voluntarily reported injuries and
provided information on general illnesses, medical
conditions, heat illnesses, and dermatologic conditions.
Information provided for each injury included the type of
injury, body part injured, and mechanism of injury. Time
in season (preseason, regular season, or postseason) and
number of participation days missed due to the injury were
also noted. Throughout the season, ATs updated injury
data, including when the student-athlete returned to full
sport participation. Injuries that were recurrences of
previous injuries were logged in the electronic medical
record system. The ATs also collected exposure informa-
tion by recording the number of student-athletes partici-
pating in each school-sanctioned practice and competition.
Student-athlete participation during individual weight-
training and conditioning sessions was not included in
these analyses.
Data were deidentified and encrypted before being
uploaded to the central aggregate database. Quality-control
staff reviewed the data, and ATs were contacted and
queried about invalid values. Verified data were included in
the aggregate research dataset.
Operational Definitions
Injury. In this study, a reportable injury was defined as
an injury that (1) occurred due to participation in a school-
sanctioned practice or competition, (2) required attention
from an AT or physician, (3) resulted in at least 24 hours of
time missed from participation, and (4) had a reported
diagnosis of stress fracture. Season-ending injuries (ie,
injuries that resulted in the student-athlete prematurely
ending his or her season) were noted. As did previous
researchers,9,21 we relied on the expertise of team medical
staff to properly diagnose stress fractures. Whereas
radiologic confirmation may have been used to aid or
confirm diagnosis, the NCAA-ISP does not record data with
that level of granularity.
Recurrence. The ATs identified recurrent injuries. We
defined recurrent injury as a recurrence of the same injury
sustained either earlier in the current academic year or in
the previous academic year. As for the initial diagnosis, we
relied on the expertise of the team medical staff to properly
diagnose a stress fracture as recurrent.
Athlete-Exposure. A reportable athlete-exposure (AE)
was defined in an earlier study20 as ‘‘1 student-athlete
participating in 1 NCAA-sanctioned practice or
competition in which he or she was exposed to the
possibility of athletic injury, regardless of the time
associated with that participation.’’ Only athletes with
actual playing time in a competition, including warm-ups,
were included in competition exposures.20
Location. The ATs identified the area where the stress
fracture occurred. Location was categorized for analysis as
lower back/lumbar spine/pelvis; femur; tibia; navicular;
metatarsal; and other, including the upper limb, ankle,
calcaneus, cuboid, cuneiform, and sesamoid.
Time in Season. We defined time in season as the
specific season segment (ie, preseason, regular season, or
postseason) in which the injury was reported to have
occurred.
Participation-Restriction Time.
Injuries
were
categorized by the number of days of participation
restriction, which was calculated by subtracting the date
of injury from the date of return. Participation-restriction
time was categorized as 1 to 6 days; 7 to 21 days; more than
21 days; or season ending, which described a student-
athlete prematurely ending the season for medical or
nonmedical reasons associated with the injury or medical
professionals requiring the student-athlete to prematurely
end the season.20
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed to assess the rate and distribution of
stress fractures sustained during collegiate sport participa-
tion during the 2004–2005 through 2013–2014 academic
years. Stress fracture injury rates were calculated overall
and by season. Rate ratios (RRs) compared rates within
sports and seasons. They were also used to compare rates
between the preseason and regular season; the postseason
was excluded from analysis due to low numbers of stress
fracture. They also compared rates among sex-comparable
sports (baseball/softball, basketball, cross-country, ice
hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis,
indoor track, and outdoor track). The following is an
example of an RR comparing stress fracture rates in men

Distributions of injuries by body part, participation-
restriction time, and recurrence were examined. For sex-
comparable sports, injury proportion ratios (IPRs) were
used to examine sex differences. The following is an
example of an IPR comparing the proportion of stress
fractures to the femur in men and women:

RESULTS
Overall
During the 2004–2005 through 2013–2004 academic
years, 671 stress fractures resulting in at least 24 hours of
time missed from participation were reported during
11 778 145 AEs, for an overall rate of 5.70/100 000 AEs
(95% CI ¼ 5.27, 6.13; Table 1). The sports with the highest
rates were women’s cross-country (28.59/100 000 AEs),
women’s gymnastics (25.58/100 000 AEs), and women’s
outdoor track (22.26/100 000 AEs). The men’s sport with
the highest stress fracture rate was cross-country (16.14/
100 000 AEs). Among sex-comparable sports, the stress
fracture rate was higher in women than in men for
basketball, cross-country, soccer, indoor track, and outdoor
track, as well as total sex-comparable sports (9.13/100 000
AEs versus 4.44/100 000 AEs, respectively; RR ¼ 2.06;
95% CI ¼ 1.71, 2.47).
Location
The most common stress fracture locations were the
metatarsals (n ¼ 254, 37.9%), tibia (n ¼ 147, 21.9%), and
lower back/lumbar spine/pelvis (n ¼ 81, 12.1%; Table 2).
Among sex-comparable sports, the proportion of stress
fractures occurring in the lower back/lumbar spine/pelvis
was higher in men (n ¼ 23, 12.8%) than in women (n ¼ 22,
6.9%; IPR ¼ 1.85; 95% CI ¼ 1.06, 3.23). In contrast, the
proportion of stress fractures occurring in the femur was
higher in women (n ¼ 39, 12.2%) than in men (n ¼ 8, 4.4%;
IPR ¼ 2.75; 95% CI ¼ 1.31, 5.76).
Time in Season
Most stress fractures occurred during the regular season
(n ¼ 400, 59.6%; Table 3). However, the rate of stress
fracture was higher in the preseason (7.30/100 000 AEs)
than in the regular season (5.12/100 000 AEs; RR ¼ 1.43;
95% CI ¼ 1.22, 1.67). Individual sports that had higher
stress fracture rates in the preseason than in the regular
season were football (RR ¼ 1.92; 95% CI ¼ 1.28, 2.89) and
men’s outdoor track (RR ¼ 5.16; 95% CI ¼ 1.51, 17.61).
The metatarsals were the most common location of stress
fractures regardless of time in season (preseason ¼ 38.3%
[n ¼ 92]; regular season ¼ 38.3% [n ¼ 153]; postseason ¼
29.0% [n ¼ 9]).
Participation-Restriction Time
Overall, 8.8% (n ¼ 59) of stress fractures resulted in
participation-restriction time of 1 to 6 days; 19.2% (n ¼
129), 7 to 21 days; 46.8% (n¼314), more than 21 days; and
20.7% (n ¼ 139) of stress fractures were season ending
(Figure 1). The sports with the largest proportion of stress
fractures that were season-ending injuries were men’s
outdoor track (n ¼ 6, 46.2%), women’s cross-country (n ¼
15, 37.5%), men’s lacrosse (n ¼ 6, 37.5%), women’s
outdoor track (n ¼ 14, 36.8%), and women’s lacrosse (n ¼
8, 36.4%). Among sex-comparable sports, the proportion of
stress fractures that were season-ending injuries did not
differ between men (n ¼ 29, 16.1%) and women (n ¼ 64,
20.1%; IPR ¼ 0.80; 95% CI ¼ 0.54, 1.20). Most season-
ending stress fractures affected the metatarsals (n ¼ 36,
25.9%), tibia (n ¼ 25, 18.0%), and lower back/lumbar
spine/pelvis (n ¼ 23, 16.5%).
Recurrence
Almost one-quarter of stress fractures were recurrent (n ¼
144, 21.5%; Figure 2). The sports with the highest
proportion of recurrent stress fractures were women’s field
hockey (n ¼ 4, 36.4%), women’s gymnastics (n ¼ 9,
34.6%), men’s football (n ¼ 26, 27.7%), and women’s
outdoor track (n ¼ 10, 26.3%). Among sex-comparable
sports, the proportion of stress fractures that were recurrent
did not differ between men (n ¼ 31, 17.2%) and women (n
¼ 64, 20.1%; IPR ¼ 0.86; 95% CI ¼ 0.58, 1.27). The
locations with the largest proportion of stress fractures that
were recurrent were the metatarsals (n ¼ 42, 29.2%), lower
back/lumbar spine/pelvis (n¼32, 22.2%), and tibia (n¼28,
19.4%).
DISCUSSION
In our study of 25 NCAA sports, we found that stress
fractures affected athletes across a wide range of sports and,
as reported by Nattiv et al,14 caused athletes to miss weeks
of participation in their sports. The severity of these stress
fractures indicates a burden to the athletes, as well as a
challenge to the sports medicine professionals who treat
them.
Overall, the stress fracture rates among the collegiate
athletes in our study were higher than recent epidemio-
logic data on stress fractures among high school athletes
from High School Reporting Information Online (RIO),9
with 5.70 versus 1.54 per 100 000 AEs, respectively, and
for all sports included in both the NCAA-ISP20 and High
School RIO except men’s swimming and diving, in which
only 1 stress fracture was reported in both studies. Such
findings may indicate that collegiate athletes are at
greater risk of stress fracture than high school athletes.
This may be due to higher training-intensity levels in
collegiate participation, as Roos et al21 suggested in an

examination of injuries resulting from overuse mecha-
nisms. Further research should be conducted to determine
whether the factors associated with additional years of
cumulative training (eg, years of participation; level of
participation; history of stress fractures, nonstress frac-
tures, and other injuries; and training load) increase the
incidence of stress fractures in collegiate athletes.
Sport Differences
We assessed stress fractures across athletes in 25 sports,
whereas the authors1,12,18,19 of most studies at the collegiate
level primarily assessed endurance athletes. Consistent with
the previous literature,4–9 we found the highest rates of
stress fractures in gymnastics, cross-country, and track and
field athletes. This is thought to be due to the nature of

training for these sports, which exposes the athlete’s lower
extremities to high loads of repetitive impact.22 Cross-
training regimens, such as strength and resistance training,
have been found to protect against overtraining injuries and
improve performance in endurance athletes.23–25 Such
regimens should be investigated further for their potential
to reduce stress fractures in collegiate endurance athletes
and other collegiate athletes, such as gymnasts, whose sport
training is also repetitive.
Sex Differences
Our results also supported previous findings4–7,9,21 that
stress fractures occurred at higher rates in female than in
male athletes. An important addition to the existing body of
knowledge is our observation that female athletes across all
sex-comparable sports experienced stress fractures at
higher rates than their male counterparts. Traditionally,
much of the attention has been focused on female
endurance athletes, but our results indicated that female

athletes, in general, should be considered at higher risk for
stress fracture.
Stress fractures in female athletes have been associated
with the female athlete triad,2,5,26 which is defined as low
energy availability (inadequate caloric intake relative to
energy expenditure) leading to diversion of energy away
from the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in order to
conserve energy for more vital processes. In women, this
leads to menstrual abnormalities, including oligomenor-
rhea, and other neuroendocrine changes that occur in
energy-restricted states and have deleterious effects on
bone. Therefore, to understand sex differences related to
stress fractures, further research into the female athlete
triad is necessary.

The risk may predate participation in collegiate athletics,
especially in light of increasingly higher training loads
imposed on young athletes in many sports.3 During
adolescence, boys develop long bones with greater diameter
and cortical thickness than girls, possibly offering greater
resistance to injury.27 Female athletes have higher rates of
low energy availability,11 lower rates of bone-mass gains
after menarche, and hormonal abnormalities that negatively
affect bone remodeling.27 Given that surveillance data
typically do not examine risk factors, future cohort
investigations focused on these known differences are
warranted.
Despite the known higher incidence of stress fractures
among females, recent screening protocols for the female
athlete triad28 and Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport29
emphasize the need to better detect both male and female
student-athletes at risk for stress fractures. Decreased
energy availability places female and male athletes at
risk,30 possibly through similar mechanisms of hormonal
dysregulation leading to abnormal bone turnover. Where-
as the relationship between decreased energy availability
and stress fractures in males is less well elucidated, one
theory is that perhaps a lower energy availability
threshold for negative bone effects exists for males
versus females.31 Therefore, we recommend that re-
searchers examine risk factors for both male and female
collegiate athletes.
Time in Season
Rates of stress fracture were greater in the preseason than
in the regular season. Although researchers32,33 have shown
that overall sport-related injuries in collegiate athletes
occur at higher rates in the preseason than in the regular
season, few authors have examined how the incidence of
stress fracture may differ by time of year. One exception is
a study of 42 figure skaters, in which Pecina et al34 reported
similar numbers of stress fractures occurring in the
preseason and regular season. Collegiate athletes preparing
for competitions in the regular season are expected to
participate in off-season and preseason conditioning
exercises and drills. However, such preparation may be
detrimental if student-athletes do not allow for sufficient
recovery time between preseason workouts and the
initiation of the regular season.35 Our data did not include
granularity of individuals’ and teams’ training loads in the
off-season, so we cannot draw additional conclusions from
our findings. Further study is needed to understand the
effects of training regimen and recovery time on stress
fracture risk.
Preparticipation examinations are used to screen athletes
for a history of injuries, medical conditions, and risk factors
for injury.36 Screening for risk factors pertinent to stress
fracture development via preparticipation examinations is
lacking in either consistency37,38 or effectiveness in
detecting these factors.39 Future efforts should focus on
implementing uniform screening for collegiate athletes
using validated methods to obtain information about an
individual’s risk.
Injury Location
The metatarsals and tibia were the most common
locations for stress fractures in our study, consistent with
previous research.6,9,26 Sex differences were also noted,
with larger proportions of stress fractures to the femur in
women and the lower back/lumbar spine/pelvis in men.
Given that the stress fracture counts were low for many
sports with multiple positions played and the fact that
AEs were not collected by position, we were unable to
examine rate differences by position. Such research with
larger samples would help to better identify specific risk
factors associated with stress fractures in particular
locations.
Recurrence and Season-Ending Injuries
Twenty-two percent of stress fractures were recurrent,
and 20% resulted in season-ending injuries. The propor-
tion of stress fractures that were recurrent was greater in
sports involving greater, more repetitive impacts, such as
gymnastics, and smaller in sports that involve less
running, such as baseball and softball. We observed no
differences in recurrence of or season-ending stress
fractures between male and female athletes. Given the
long-term health implications and potentially dramatic
effects on sport participation, our findings suggest the
need for further examination of ways to mitigate the risk
of both season-ending and recurrent stress fractures.
Limitations
Our study had limitations. The NCAA-ISP relies on the
medical expertise and reporting consistency of ATs. This
may be of particular concern when evaluating stress
fractures, which are often diagnosed via imaging studies
(eg, bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging). The NCAA-
ISP does not require information about whether such
imaging was performed, which studies were chosen, or the
specific radiologic findings. Therefore, it is possible that
cases were misclassified (eg, tendinitis misclassified as a
stress fracture). Recurrent injuries could have been
incompletely healed fractures, which is another source
of misclassification.40 The NCAA-ISP includes data
reported by a convenience sample of collegiate sports
programs; the findings may not be generalizable to
nonparticipating programs or programs outside the NCAA
(eg, junior colleges). A stress fracture is a cumulative
injury that may not have an immediate and clear
identification point of injury onset; therefore, time in
season may have been misclassified (eg, injury onset was
in the preseason, but the pain was not severe enough for a
diagnosis of stress fracture until the regular season), and
the participation-restriction time from injury may have
been inaccurate.
CONCLUSIONS
We examined the epidemiology of stress fractures among
collegiate athletes in 25 sports across 10 years. Our study is
the most comprehensive evaluation of stress fractures in
collegiate athletes to date. The rate of stress fracture was
highest among endurance sports and higher in women than
in men. Higher rates among female athletes were found not
only in cross-country athletes, indoor track, and outdoor
track athletes, but also in basketball and soccer athletes.
Twenty-two percent of stress fractures were recurrent, and
20% resulted in season-ending injuries. Therefore, whereas

stress fractures may be less common than other sport-
related injuries, the considerable effect they have on
athletes’ sport participation justifies the need for additional
research regarding prevention.
