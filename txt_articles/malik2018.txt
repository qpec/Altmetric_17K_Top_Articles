The carbon footprint of Australian health care
Arunima Malik, Manfred Lenzen, Scott McAlister, Forbes McGain
Summary
Background Carbon footprints stemming from health care have been found to be variable, from 3% of the total 
national CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions in England to 10% of the national CO2e emissions in the USA. We aimed to 
measure the carbon footprint of Australia’s health-care system.
Methods We did an observational economic input–output lifecycle assessment of Australia’s health-care system. All 
expenditure data were obtained from the 15 sectors of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare for the financial 
year 2014–15. The Australian Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab) data were used to obtain CO2e emissions 
per AUS$ spent on health care.
Findings In 2014–15 Australia spent $161·6 billion on health care that led to CO2e emissions of about 35 772 
(68% CI 25 398–46 146) kilotonnes. Australia’s total CO2e emissions in 2014–15 were 494 930 kilotonnes, thus health 
care represented 35 772 (7%) of 494 930 kilotonnes total CO2e emissions in Australia. The five most important sectors 
within health care in decreasing order of total CO2e emissions were: public hospitals (12 295 [34%] of 35 772 kilotonnes 
CO2e), private hospitals (3635 kilotonnes [10%]), other medications (3347 kilotonnes [9%]), benefit-paid drugs 
(3257 kilotonnes [9%]), and capital expenditure for buildings (2776 kilotonnes [8%]).
Interpretation The carbon footprint attributed to health care was 7% of Australia’s total; with hospitals and 
pharmaceuticals the major contributors. We quantified Australian carbon footprint attributed to health care and 
identified health-care sectors that could be ameliorated. Our results suggest the need for carbon-efficient procedures, 
including greater public health measures, to lower the impact of health-care services on the environment.

Introduction
The health effects of climate change are becoming 
increasingly important, with more frequent direct effects 
such as heat stress and fires, water inundations, and 
storms, and indirect effects including malnutrition from 
crop failures, and altered infectious disease patterns.1 
Health care itself has been shown to contribute to climate 
change.2,3 In particular, hospitals are highly energy 
intensive, consume large amounts of resources, and 
produce a large amount of waste.4 There are personal, 
financial, and environmental benefits from reducing our 
reliance on hospital-based health care and improving 
availability of public health. For example, personal health 
benefits arise from more frequent exercise, reduced 
obesity, the consumption of more plant-based foods, and 
reduced smoking and alcohol intake. Such personal 
benefits give rise to environmental co-benefits through 
reduced car use, fewer methane-producing ruminants, 
and fewer hospital admissions from chronic ill health.4,5
Environmental footprinting of health-care activities is 
becoming more common; particularly through the use of 
lifecycle assessment (LCA), a tool for quantifying 
environmental effects.6–8 A carbon footprint is measured 
in terms of the equivalent global warming potential of 
CO2 over a 100-year period. These CO2 equivalent (CO2e) 
emissions include the effects of greenhouse gases such as 
CH4 and N2O, which have emissions that are seemingly 
equivalent to varying CO2e emissions. In 2008, health 
care in the USA contributed to 8% of that country’s entire 
carbon footprint,9 which was updated in 2016 to 10%,2 
whereas in 2012, England reported a more modest 4% of 
their CO2e emissions being attributed to health care.3
In Australia, no such national carbon footprint 
(CO2e emissions) study of health care has been done to 
date. Knowledge of the carbon footprint attributed to 
health care would indicate the magnitude of this concern, 
identifying potential hotspots that might allow a more 
targeted approach to reducing CO2e emissions in a world 
that is producing increasing amounts of carbon. 
Furthermore, a top down knowledge of the total carbon 
footprint of Australian health care will give perspective to 
efforts to reduce CO2e emissions that stem from specific 
activities in health care (ie, the Australian ambulance 
service10 and operating theatres8).
We had two aims. First, we asked what the total 
CO2e emissions were that arose from the actions of 
Australian health care in a single year (April, 2014–March, 
2015) and what these were as a proportion of the entire 
Australian economy. Second, we asked what the CO2e 
emissions were that arose from subsets of Australian 
health care. We examined the 15 Australian Institute of 
Health and Welfare (AIHW) categories including public 
and private hospitals, primary health care (general 
practitioners), medicines, and patient transport.

Methods
Rationale
There are two predominant approaches to environmental 
footprinting or lifecycle assessment (LCA): process-based 
LCAs and economic input–output LCAs. Process-based 
LCAs measure all material inputs along with all emissions 
to the environment of individual processes, with multiple 
processes combining to create a final service or product. 
Process-based LCAs are useful when examining small 
amounts of specific data,8 but are impractical when 
examining the environmental effects of an entire supply 
chain in health care, because process-based LCAs require 
the selection of a system boundary. The supply chains 
falling within this system boundary are considered in a 
process LCA, whereas the rest are deemed negligible. 
Selection of a system boundary might result in so-called 
truncation errors.11 These truncation errors can be avoided 
by scanning the entire upstream supply chain of a 
product, process, sector, or even a whole nation by use of 
input–output analysis.
Economic input–output LCA is a macro 
economic 
technique that describes the complex inter 
dependencies 
between different sectors of an economy. All Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
countries and 27 non-member economies produce input–
output tables to allow this economic analysis to occur. 
Economic input–output LCA takes into account all infinite 
upstream supply chains, without the need for the selection 
of a system boundary, hence providing a comprehensive 
picture by ensuring that both the direct (on-site) and total 
(direct plus indirect) effects are captured.11,12 An example of 
direct CO2e emissions would be the burning of fuel or gas 
at a hospital, whereas an indirect impact would be a 
hospital’s electricity use, because that electricity was 
routinely generated elsewhere.
All economic activity has an environmental effect 
associated with it. Economic input–output LCAs assign 
an environmental effect to an item, process, or service 
via knowledge of a monetary value and its attribution to 
a specific economic sector. Economic input–output 
LCAs require a set of input–output matrices containing 
monetary information on the transactions between 
different economic sectors, and also physical data (for 
example on CO2e emissions) for every sector listed in the 
input–output table (appendix). Input–output calculations 
can then be used to find both the direct and the total 
CO2e emissions for all sectors (appendix).
The equation underlying the CO2e footprint relies on a 
so-called stressor that equates to money spent. In the case 
of the footprint calculation of health care, this stressor is 
the expenditure data (in million Australian dollars), 
which is multiplied with the CO2e emissions factor 
(eg, kilotonnes of CO2e per million dollars) to yield a 
CO2e emissions footprint. In this linear association, if 
the amount of expenditure data increases, so does the 
footprint.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Climate change is an existential threat to planetary health. The 
carbon footprint attributed to health care (CO2 emissions) is large 
in the USA and the UK where it has been systematically studied. 
The USA’s health-care system contributes to about 10% of the 
total US carbon footprint, whereas in the UK, health care is 
responsible for 4% of national UK CO2 emissions. We searched the 
PubMed and Engineering Village databases from Jan 1, 1990, to 
June 1, 2017 using the terms “health care”, “greenhouse 
emissions”, “climate change”, “life cycle assessment”, “input 
output”, and “environment”. All article types and languages were 
included. We found no evidence of other lifecycle assessments of 
health-care systems. 
Carbon emissions are classified as direct (emanating directly 
from energy used within an economic sector, eg, onsite natural 
gas use) and indirect (electricity generation elsewhere, plastics 
and drug manufacture). To begin the transition towards a lower 
carbon economy, each nation will require data about the 
contributions of different economic sectors to the total CO2 
emissions. Because climate change is ultimately a health 
problem, knowledge about the contributions of health care to 
the carbon footprint is becoming more useful. Furthermore, 
there might be substantial differences in the carbon footprint of 
different health-care systems. Finally, although Australia has a 
relatively small population, Australia has one of the highest CO2 
emissions per person in the world. 
Added value of this study
We found that the carbon footprint attributed to health care was 
7% of Australia’s total; that is, similar to the entire carbon 
emissions of all activities associated with 7% of Australians 
(eg, all people in the state of South Australia). Hospitals and the 
pharmaceutical industry were together responsible for 
two-thirds of the carbon footprint associated with health care in 
Australia. 90% of the carbon footprint stemmed from indirect 
CO2 emissions due to purchases between multiple different 
economic sectors that fed into the health-care sector. 
Implications of all of the available evidence
Our study indicates that health care contributes considerably to 
Australia’s total carbon footprint and identifies the major 
contributors that could be ameliorated. Although at the federal 
government level, Australia has annulled a national carbon 
emissions trading scheme, several Australian states have 
programmes in place to achieve carbon neutral status by 2050. 
However, without data such as those we have now provided, 
these carbon neutral aspirations will be uncertain in outcome, 
and unclear in guidance. Our study begins the long path to 
carbon neutrality in Australian health care.

Input–output calculations can then be used to find both 
the direct and the total CO2e emissions for all sectors 
(appendix). Consider the economic sector for the 
pharmaceutical sector, which receives inputs from other 
relevant sectors listed in the economy such as research 
and development, lawyers’ and accountants’ fees, business 
services, and travel for drug representatives. In this 
scenario, in addition to calculating direct CO2e emissions 
for the pharmaceuticals sector, input–output analysis 
takes into account the monetary transactions between the 
pharmaceutical sectors and all the other mentioned 
sectors to yield a value for the total CO2e emissions for this 
sector (appendix). It is important to note that such type of 
assessment is called footprinting, which is a well 
established technique for measuring both the direct and 
total effects (eg, CO2e emissions) of an industry.13,14 The 
advantages of economic input–output  LCAs are that they 
are all encompassing and relatively inexpensive to do once 
the initial expensive data gathering has occurred, but they 
have increased uncertainty when moving down to the 
level of individual products or services.
This study did not require ethical approval from the 
Western Health Ethics Committee. We followed a six step 
procedure (appendix) for this input–output analysis, 
which is summarised here in five steps, using previously 
developed tables from the 1284 economic sectors 
examined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics,15 and the 
consequently amalgamated 360 economic sectors by the 
Australian Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab).16 
We obtained health-care financial data for only 1 year 
(2014–15), as the IELab’s CO2e emissions per dollar were 
obtained for that year.16
Data collection
Importantly, the Australian Institute of Health and 
Welfare 
(AIHW) 
includes 
all 
government 
and 
non-government 
costs 
including 
private 
health 
insurance and all out of pocket costs provided by 
patients.17 The AIHW lists 16 health-care expenditure 
categories given in the Health Expenditure Australia 
report. We obtained data on various health-care 
expenditure categories from appendix B of the Health 
Expenditure Australia 2014–15 report.17 As an example of 
the division of such financial costs, hospital services 
included all pathology, radiology, and physiotherapy, as 
well as all labour, construction, food, paper, plastics, and 
medical equipment present within hospitals. Excluded 
from hospital services were otherwise definable AIHW 
categories such as pharmaceuticals, research, patient 
transport, and aids and appliances (even if these were 
occurring in hospitals). Exclusions were required to 
avoid counting AIHW expenditure categories more than 
once. Included in the health expenditure assessment 
were investment in equipment and facilities, though the 
following were excluded: expenditure that might have 
had a health outcome, but occurred outside the health 
sector; expenditure on personal activities that were not 
directly related to maintaining or improving personal 
health (ie, any form of exercise while at work); and 
expenditure that did not have health as the main area of 
benefit (ie, public and active transport; appendix). 
Palliative care was included in the AIHW data and was 
included in other services according to their location; 
hospitals (including hospices), or community health 
services in old people’s homes. One of the AIHW 
categories was the medical expenses tax rebate, which 
was an accounting feature and thus did not have an 
environmental footprint itself and was not considered 
further. We also did not examine the aged care industry 
(ie, the care of people in hostels or nursing homes) 
because this was outside the domain of the AIHW data.
Data analysis
There are large amounts of monetary flows (buying and 
selling) between many different sectors of an economy, 
which can be obtained from input–output tables. 
Associated 
mathematical 
equations 
developed 
by 
Wassily Leontief have gained widespread acceptance.18 In 
particular, dividing the total CO2e emissions for a sector 
by its corresponding monetary output yields direct 
carbon emission intensities from that sector. Thereafter, 
multiplying the direct carbon emission intensity matrix 
with Leontief’s inverse matrix to capture all the 
interactions between sectors yields total carbon emission 
intensities in basic economic prices. One report19 gives a 
mathematical explanation for calculating direct and total 
carbon intensities using the Leontief input–output 
framework.
To calculate CO2e emission intensities for each of the 
360 sectors16 in purchasers’ prices, margins and taxes 
needed to be added to the basic price, following the 
approach of Lenzen and Dey (appendix).20 Examples of the 
360 sectors included in the input–output tables generated 
with IELab were leather products, motor vehicle repairs, 
petroleum and coal products, and rail transport. 
Hereafter, when relevant, public and private hospitals 
have been combined and, similarly, community and 
public health have been combined because they are 
related activities occiring in the community or in broader 
health care). Furthermore, all dugs in the Pharmaceutical 
Benefits Scheme (PBS) and non-PBS pharmaceutical 
categories have been combined. 
Matrix bridge construction
There were 360 IELab economic sectors that had to be 
matched with the 15 AIHW sectors with a concordance 
table (matrix bridge). To calculate the CO2e emission 
intensities 
for 
Australian 
health-care 
expenditure 
categories, we constructed a matrix bridge with the 
15 AIHW categories in rows and the 360 economic 
input–output sectors in columns, and made concordance 
allocations between the appropriate associated sectors. 
The AIHW category of unreferred medical services was 
in concordance with the general practice medical services

sector of the IELab’s 360 sectors, whereas most of the 
other AIHW categories fell across several of the IELab’s 
sectors. For example, the AIHW category public hospitals 
was matched with the following IELab sectors: hospital 
services (except psychiatric hospitals), psychiatric 
hospitals, pathology and diagnostic services, and 
physiotherapy services.
The concordance matrix was then converted to another 
matrix by proportioning; AIHW categories that were 
allocated to more than one economic input–output sector 
were converted into proportions adding up to 1 (100% of 
their cost), as further explained by Lenzen and colleagues 
(appendix).21
We did a second Leontief calculation12 for the direct and 
indirect CO₂e emissions per dollar (the carbon intensity) 
of output for each of the 15 AIHW categories. Using the 
total monetary values of each of the 15 AIHW health-care 
categories multiplied by the CO2e emissions per dollar 
we obtained the total carbon footprint for each sector for 
2014–15 (appendix).
Statistical analysis
We did an uncertainty assessment by following the 
Monte Carlo approach for investigating the uncertainty 
of the results derived above, and present all such 
uncertainties as 68% CIs, which is routine in input–
output LCA.21–23 Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of 
computational algorithms that rely on repeated random 
sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte Carlo 
methods are used routinely in LCA and are useful when 
there are large numbers of inputs and when it is not 
pragmatic to obtain data for each of these inputs de novo.
In essence, we used the standard deviation of raw input–
output data for the generation of normally distributed 
random numbers around the input variables needed in 
the footprint equation (appendix).
Role of the funding source
There was no funding source for this study. All authors 
had full access to all of the data. All authors made the 
decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
Results
In 2014–15 the AIHW recorded that Australia spent 
AUS$161·6 billion on health-care in 15 health care sectors.17 
By use of data from IELab’s16 input–output tables, we 
obtained the CO2e emission factors (CO2e per dollar) for 
each of these sectors. In 2014–15 the total CO2e emissions 
stemming from Australian health-care categories (table 1) 
were about 35 772 kilotonnes (68% CI 25 398–46 146). 
Given that Australia’s total CO2e emissions in 2014–15 
were 494 930 kilotonnes,16 this finding shows that health 
care contributed 7·2% (68% CI 5·1–9·3) of Australia’s total 
CO2e emissions.
Table 2 gives the expenditure data for 15 AIHW health-
care expenditure categories for the decade from 
2006–07 until 2014–15. The four largest financial 
cost categories were: public and private hospitals 
($62 315 million [39%] of $161 637 million), all (PBS and 
non-PBS) pharmaceuticals ($19 818 million [12%]), 
referred (specialist) medical services ($16 942 million 
[10%]), and unreferred medical services ($11 031 [7%]). 
Hospital CO2e emissions include all activities occurring 
within a hospital excluding research (even if that is in a 
hospital), aids and appliances, and transport to and from 
hospitals.
Table 3 gives the direct and total (direct plus indirect) 
CO2e emissions with uncertainties given as 68% confidence 
intervals (one standard deviation, routine for input–output 
analysis),22,23 for the 15 AIHW sectors for Australian health 
care. Direct CO2e emissions per dollar are those that arose 
directly from each sector (electricity use was termed an 
indirect CO2e emission unless it was produced on site). 
Pharmaceuticals had the highest direct CO2e emissions, 
which could be because of drug manufacturing, which is 
energy intense, with the energy source often directly burnt 
on site. The direct CO2e emissions attributed to health care 
(in kilotonnes CO2e) were 4809 (13%) of 35 772 kilotonnes

total CO2e emissions. The pharmaceutical sector had high 
indirect CO2e emissions from significant interaction 
with multiple other economic sectors (eg, electricity, 
petrochemicals, and agriculture).
Hospitals, aids and appliances, community health, and 
capital expenditure for buildings also had high total CO2e 
emission factors. High CO2e emission factors were 
unsurprising for hospitals (0·26 kg CO2e per dollar 
spent), which required interaction with many other 
economic sectors. Capital expenditure and aids and 
appliances sectors require interactions with sectors that 
have high CO2e emissions (such as building construction 
and manufacturing). Community health had a high CO2e 
emission factor of 0·23 kg CO2e per dollar spent. 
Community health included mental health facilities that 
were not classified as psychiatric hospitals, thus 
encompassing constant care of patients requiring 
electricity, food, and accommodation, and included health 
centres in sparsely populated parts of the large Australian 
continent.

All other health-care sectors had lower CO2e emission 
factors; at least partly because they did not encompass 
patient 
admission. 
Patient 
transport 
services 
(ie, ambulances) had a low CO2e emission factor 
considering the large amount of fossil fuels used for 
transporting patients. The actual monetary spend on 
fuel by patient transport services was small (<5%) 
compared with all other costs (labour, purchasing new 
vehicles, and accounting and legal services).
We identified the importance of different AIHW 
categories in the contribution of health-care costs to CO2e 
emissions (figure); we amalgamated several associated 
AIHW sectors to visualise these data: non-PBS and PBS 
pharmaceuticals into one category for all pharmaceuticals, 
and community health and public health into one category. 
The five most important sectors in total CO2e emissions 
were public hospitals (12 295 [34%] of 35 772 CO2e 
emissions), private hospitals (3635 CO2e emissions [10%]), 
other medications (3347 kilotonnes [9%]), benefit-paid 
medications (3257 kilotonnes [9%]), and capital expenditure 
for buildings (2776 CO2e emissions [8%]); with referred or 
specialist medical services (2169 kilotonnes [6%]; table 3) 
also an important contributor. Most capital expenditure in 
health care went towards building hospitals. So, the 
combined carbon footprint of recurrent and capital 
expenditure on hospitals was greater than 50% of CO2e 
emissions in the entire health-care category. General 
practices contributed 1509 kilotonnes (4%) to total 
CO2e emissions, and patient transport 457 kilotonnes (1%). 
Radiology and pathology services were distributed between 
the hospital, specialist medical services, dentistry, and 
public health.
Discussion
Australia spent about AUS$161 billion on health care in 
2014–15, equivalent to 9·4% of the nation’s gross domestic 
product (GDP).25 We did an input–output LCA, finding 
that the provision of such health care was 7% of Australia’s 
entire CO2e emissions (35 772 of 494 930 kilotonnes CO2e 
emissions). As a comparator, we calculated (using the 
same methods as for health care) that in 2014 the carbon 
footprint of all Australian construction sectors (residential 
and non-residential building, and other construction, 
repair, 
and 
maintenance) 
was 
67 599 
(14%) 
of 
494 930 kilotonnes CO2e emissions. That is, the CO2e 
emissions of health care were about half those of the 
construction of every single building, house, pipeline, 
dam, oil rig, road, and rail line in Australia in 2014–15. 
Similarly, the carbon footprint of Australian health care is 
equivalent to the total carbon footprint of all of the activities 
(travel, 
transport, 
housing, 
electricity, 
gas, 
food, 
entertainment, and purchases) of 7% of Australia’s total 
population (equivalent to all people living in the state of 
South Australia).26
Hospitals (including their capital expenditure) had a 
carbon footprint of about half of the total for health care. 
Pharmaceuticals contributed to a further 20% of total CO2e 
emissions, whereas specialist medical services added 
6% and general practitioners added 4%. Direct CO2e 
emissions from the use of fuel (gas for hot water) in health 
care contributed to 10% of total CO2e emissions, whereas 
indirect CO2e emissions due to purchasing from other 
economic sectors contributed to almost 90% of the total.
Total (public and private) health-care expenditure as a 
proportion of GDP was similar for Australia and England 
(9·4% vs 9·1%).25 CO2e emissions in Australian health 
care as a proportion of the total, however, were almost 
double England’s (7% vs 4%). In England, private health 
care is responsible for about 20% of health-care 
expenditure.27 The National Health Service (NHS) 
England’s CO2e emission data do not include private 
health care, although this is unlikely to increase England’s 
CO2e emissions from health care as a proportion of 
England’s total to more than 4·5%. Potential reasons for 
such national differences include different penetration 
and accuracy of data gathering by the national bureaus of 
statistics both for financial and CO2e emissions data and 
differences in health-care delivery. Furthermore, different 
energy sources for the national electricity mixes could 
account for some of the differences in the CO2e emissions; 
for instance, in Australia, coal makes up 63%, gas 21%, 
hydroelectricity 5%, and wind 4% of national energy 
sources, whereas in the UK, gas makes up 30%, coal 23%, 
nuclear energy 21%, and wind 12% of national energy 
sources.28 It is unlikely that there were differences in the 
methods of obtaining input-–output LCA data between 
Australia, the UK, and the USA, but there might have 
been different attributions of CO2e emissions by 
economic sector by the IELab16 in Australia compared 
with the UK or the USA. That is, there are different

numbers of economic sectors for each nation and these 
might have had different CO2e emissions per dollar 
attributed to them.
Eckelman and Sherman2 were able to identify all 
environmental 
effects 
(including 
CO2e 
emissions, 
pollutants, and ecotoxicity) and thus were able to calculate 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).2 Because our prime 
consideration was the climate change effects of health care 
we examined only CO2e emissions, as per previous UK 
health-care studies.3 It is currently impossible to obtain 
robust, complete national data about the quantities of 
many other common environmental effects for Australian 
economic sectors (such as water use, petrochemical and 
metal depletion, and terrestrial and aquatic pollution). 
Another limitation of our study was that we gave data for 
1 year (2014–15) as the CO2e emissions per dollar were only 
obtained for that year.16 The carbon emissions of econnomic 
sectors vary from year to year, resulting in different carbon 
intensities. At the time of writing, a time-series of data on 
carbon emissions was not available in the IELab;16 hence, 
our study only examines emissions produced in one year.
Australia’s 
health-care 
statistics 
indicate 
that 
expenditure is rising; there is more money being spent 
on Australia’s health-care sector every year (even when 
accounting for inflation). Importantly, there is a linear 
association 
between 
expenditure 
and 
the 
CO2e 
emissions footprint (appendix). Thus, CO2e emissions 
in Australian health care will rise with greater 
expenditure, unless the CO2e emissions per dollar 
simultaneously fall because of greater investment in 
energy sources with low CO2e emissions.
In the USA, direct CO2e emissions in health care (from 
onsite hospital gas boilers) were only 3% of total 
CO2e emissions,2 whereas those in Australia were 13%. 
It is difficult to indicate the most likely reasons for these 
differences in country-specific percentages of direct 
CO2e emissions, but possibilities include greater use of 
gas co-generation for electricity in Australia (direct 
CO2e emissions), the use of different sources of 
electricity (coal, gas, or renewables), or simply that USA 
health care is buying more for each patient treated.
Previous studies of national CO2e emissions attributed 
to health care have been done in the USA. In 2014, the 
USA spent 17·1% of GDP on health care,25 and the 
resultant CO2e emissions were 10% of the USA’s total.2 
The amount spent on health care as a proportion of GDP 
was always more than CO2e emissions attributed to 
health care as a proportion of the total. This is because 
health care, despite being financially expensive, has a low 
CO2 emission rate per dollar compared with high CO2-
emitting sectors such as agriculture.
Pharmaceuticals contributed to 19% of Australia’s, and 
22% of the UK’s3 carbon footprint in the health-care 
sector. In the USA, prescription drugs contributed 
to 10% of the carbon footprint attributed to health 
care,2 although it is unclear what footprint non-
prescription drugs had. Further discussion about 
reasons for inter-country variation is speculative. Beyond 
hospitals, pharmaceuticals, and capital expenditure, all 
other health-care sectors contributed a further 30% of 
the total carbon footprint. Although it might seem 
counter-intuitive that specialist medical services or 
clinics had a higher carbon footprint than patient 
transport, almost five times as much money was spent 
on specialist services as on transporting patients (each 
dollar spent was associated with CO2e emissions). 
Countries might have different numbers of economic 
sectors. Importantly, countries divide their economies 
into different numbers of economic sectors, which 
means that sector names in any two countries are not 
necessarily the same. For example, one country might 
divide health care into four sectors (hospitals, medicines, 
general practice, and others), whereas other countries 
might have more health-care economic sectors. This 
study relied on input–output tables that featured a range 
of industry sectors. Some input–output tables were 
highly aggregated with fewer sectors, whereas others 
were disaggregated tables with more sectors. For the 
case of transport, some input–output tables had a sector 
called transport, whereas other tables (such as the one 
we used in this Article) have specific details for a range 
of transport services, such as road transport, rail 
transport, air transport, and others. Regardless of which 
table was used for doing an input–output analysis, all 
transport services were included and taken into account 
in our study.
Climate change is an increasingly pressing health 
predicament.1 Health care itself contributes to our 
collective carbon footprint, yet reducing this footprint is 
good for our health.29 We now have the data to reduce 
carbon hotspots in health care. There are national 
Australian targets for reducing CO2e emissions and for 
renewable electricity generation, yet health care itself has 
no carbon targets. In the UK, the Sustainable Development 
Unit (SDU) has been charged with efforts to reduce the 
health sector’s carbon footprint3 as part of a broader, 
nationwide economic effort to reduce CO2e emissions, an 
approach that could be emulated in Australia.
A rapid reduction in CO2e emissions is required to 
keep the Earth’s temperature within limits for the 
survival of living beings; a discussion that dominated 
talks in the 2016 Paris Agreement.30 Although it is clear 
that strategies need to be put in place for reducing the 
harmful effects of CO2e emissions and for restoring the 
Earth’s energy balance, it is also important to ensure that 
these strategies do not unintentionally cause harm. One 
of the strategies for potentially reducing CO2e emissions 
is the construction of energy-efficient buildings. Making 
use of energy efficiency measures can decrease energy 
use by over 40%.31 A rapid transition from fossil fuels, 
which produce high amounts of CO2e emissions, to 
renewable energy technologies requires a comprehensive 
assessment of the new technology to minimise potential 
electricity grid instability and environmental burdens.32

Efforts to improve energy efficiency in health care, 
augment renewable electricity sources, and reduce 
unnecessary procurement costs and waste production 
could have financial, environmental, and social benefits.8,33 
The concept of health co-benefits4,5 is important for tackling 
climate change; the use of less passive transport and more 
exercise,34 less drug use, and healthier plant-based diets all 
have benefits for patients and have environmental 
co-benefits such as a smaller carbon footprint.
With bipartisan support in the UK for tackling climate 
change through the use of carbon targets (an 80% reduction 
of 1990 CO2e emissions by 2050), the NHS SDU has led 
the way internationally towards health-care sustainability.35 
By systematically measuring CO2e emissions of different 
health-care sectors and working through sustainable 
solutions with clinicians and engineers, the SDU has 
achieved progress in reducing CO2e emissions, while 
remaining patient centred, socially responsible, and 
financially prudent.3 In Australia, recent state-based 
legislation such as the Victorian Climate Change Act36 and 
the New South Wales Climate Change Policy Framework37 
have targets for zero CO2e emissions (including for health 
care) by 2050.36 It would seem reasonable for Australians 
(and others elsewhere with similar targets) to seek 
guidance from those working within the UK’s SDU to 
begin the transition to a low carbon health-care system.
There are also advocacy groups that are focused on 
reducing health’s environmental footprint, both local 
(Doctors for the Environment Australia and the Climate 
and Health Alliance) and international (US Healthcare 
Without Harm, UK Centre for Sustainable Healthcare, 
and France [C2DS], the Comité pour le Développement 
Durable en Santé [Committee for Sustainable Health 
Development]). Research examining different health-care 
sectors, particularly through the use of LCA, would be 
instructive.8 The role of public health in preventing 
hospital admissions in the first place will be crucial in 
a carbon-constrained health-care system. Competing 
concerns from an ageing population, whose increased 
use of health-care resources is likely to counteract any 
such savings, will need to be encompassed. All fields of 
medicine, medical associations, and colleges will have a 
role to play in reducing health-care’s carbon footprint.
