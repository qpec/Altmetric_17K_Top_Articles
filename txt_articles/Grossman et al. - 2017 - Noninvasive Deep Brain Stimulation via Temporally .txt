SUMMARY
We report a noninvasive strategy for electrically stim-
ulating neurons at depth. By delivering to the brain
multiple electric fields at frequencies too high to re-
cruit neural firing, but which differ by a frequency
within the dynamic range of neural firing, we can
electrically stimulate neurons throughout a region
where interference between the multiple fields re-
sults in a prominent electric field envelope modu-
lated at the difference frequency. We validated this
temporal interference (TI) concept via modeling and
physics experiments, and verified that neurons
in the living mouse brain could follow the electric
field envelope. We demonstrate the utility of TI stim-
ulation by stimulating neurons in the hippocampus of
living mice without recruiting neurons of the over-
lying cortex. Finally, we show that by altering the cur-
rents delivered to a set of immobile electrodes, we
can steerably evoke different motor patterns in living
mice.
INTRODUCTION
Physical means of brain stimulation, such as the use of implanted
electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS), have led to wide-
spread excitement about the possibility of repairing neural
dysfunction through direct control of brain circuit dynamics,
including multiple FDA-approved therapies for previously intrac-
table brain disorders (Greenberg et al., 2010; Kalia et al., 2013).
Electrical stimulation via implanted electrodes sparsely activates
distributed sets of neurons (Histed et al., 2009), in a fashion
different from direct optogenetic control of local cells (Gradinaru
et al., 2009). The impact of electromagnetic stimulation on brain
circuitry is an emergent function of the fields applied, the excit-
ability properties of the neurons themselves, and the configura-
tion of the neural network in which they are embedded (Merrill
et al., 2005). As a result of this complexity, physical means of
brain stimulation are often used in a phenomenological way,
especially because the excitability properties of neurons vary
across different cell types, and thus understanding how a given
brain stimulation method impacts a given brain function may
require analyzing many factors.
However, some properties of neurons are likely universal—for
example, the intrinsic low-pass filtering of electrical signals
by the neural membrane (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000), which
prevents neural electrical activity from following very high-
frequency oscillating (e.g., R 1 kHz) electric fields. Here, we
explore whether the biophysics underpinning such a potentially
universal property might support novel strategies for electrical
brain stimulation. In particular, if we apply high-frequency oscil-
lating electric fields at multiple sites outside the brain, neurons in
the brain will not be able to follow these high-frequency fields
directly. However, if two such electric fields are applied at high
frequencies that differ by a small amount, which corresponds
to a low frequency that neurons can follow, neurons in the brain

 may be able to demodulate and follow the envelope modulation
that results from the temporal interference between these two
applied fields, and which oscillates at the difference frequency.
If the amplitude of the envelope modulation reaches a maximum
at a site deep in the brain, it might be possible to drive deep-lying
neurons without recruiting overlying ones. We here test this
concept, which we call temporal interference (TI) stimulation,
by using computational modeling and phantom measurements,
as well as electrophysiological measurements in vivo. We
demonstrate the ability of TI stimulation to mediate activation
of hippocampal neurons without recruiting overlying cortical
neurons and steerably probe motor cortex functionality without
physically moving electrodes by altering the current magnitudes
delivered to a fixed set of electrodes.
RESULTS
TI Stimulation: Concept and Validation of Neural Firing
Recruitment
We first set out to examine whether the TI concept could indeed
result in well-defined low-frequency envelope modulated elec-
tric fields. In the TI concept (Figure 1A), electric currents are
applied at high frequencies f1 and f2 = f1 + Df that fall outside
the range of normal neural operation, but which differ by a small
amount, Df, that falls within the frequency range that neurons
can respond to. The superposition of the two electric fields inside
the brain results in an electric field at a frequency of ðf1 + f2Þ=2,
whose envelope is modulated at the frequency Df (Figure 1B).
The amplitude of the envelope modulation at a particular location
depends on the vectorial sum of the two applied field vectors at
that point and as a result can have a maximum at a point distant
from the electrodes, potentially even deep in the brain (Fig-
ure 1C). The location of this envelope maximum depends on
the electrode configuration, as well as properties of the applied
waveforms. For the trapezoidal configuration shown in Figure 1A,
the low-frequency envelope oscillates at a frequency of 40 Hz,
with waveforms in Figure 1B plotted at the two specific points
highlighted by Roman numerals in Figure 1A. For example,
Figure 1Bi shows a large envelope modulation amplitude at a
location where the two fields are large and aligned, whereas
Figure 1Bii shows a small envelope modulation amplitude at a
location where the two fields are less aligned.
To assess whether such low-frequency field envelopes could
effectively drive neural spiking activity, we applied TI stimulation
transcranially to anesthetized living mice, and recorded the
responses by using automated whole-cell patch clamp neural
recording. Currents were applied via two electrodes on the skull
(with a �0.5 mm gap between their edges), and recordings were
made in the somatosensory cortex. We found that interferential
stimulation with two sinusoids at 2.01 kHz and 2 kHz, resulting
in a Df envelope frequency of 10 Hz, was able to recruit neurons
to fire at 10 Hz (Figure 1D), as efficaciously as direct 10 Hz
stimulation (Figure 1E) that would be expected to broadly affect
neural activity (Miranda et al., 2013). High-frequency stimulation
(with one sinusoid at 2 kHz and no TI) did not result in activity
(Figure 1F), beyond a brief transient associated with the
beginning of stimulation in some cells (n = 4 out of 6 cells from
2 mice) when 0.25 s sinusoidal ramp-up times were used.
When 0.5 s ramp-up times were used, no such transient activity
was observed in any cells (n = 5 cells from 2 mice), suggesting
that the transient spiking activity observed earlier was due to
the speed of the 0.25 s duration ramp-up (Figure 1J). We
validated TI stimulation on a population of cortical cells (Fig-
ure 1Ii) and found that interferential stimulation with a difference
frequency of 10 Hz resulted in spike frequencies of 10.21 ±
0.83 Hz (mean ± SD), for a 1 kHz carrier frequency (n = 6 cells
from 2 mice) and 9.68 ± 0.85 Hz for a 2 kHz carrier frequency
(n = 7 cells from 3 mice; see Table S1 for full statistics associated
with Figure 1Ii).
To validate whether neuronal firing can be manipulated at
different depths in tissue, we performed automatic patch clamp
recording in the mouse hippocampus. Currents were applied via
two electrodes that were located on the skull, with proximal
edges 1.5–2 mm apart. We found that interferential stimulation
(with two sinusoids at 2.01 kHz and 2 kHz, resulting in a Df enve-
lope frequency of 10 Hz) was able to recruit neural firing in
synchronization with the envelope—with either single spikes
(n = 3 cells from 2 mice) or brief bursts of spikes (n = 5 cells
from 3 mice; a burst was defined as a < 50 ms spiking event
with inter-spike interval % 15 ms; 1.3 ± 0.37 mean spikes per
burst ± SD; 9.07 ± 3.2 ms inter-spike interval) elicited by the TI
stimulation (in detail: mouse 1 had one cell with a burst response;
mouse 2 had two cells with single spike responses; mouse 3 had
two cells with a burst response; mouse 4 had two cells with a
burst response and one cell with a single spike response) (Fig-
ure 1G). Direct application of high-frequency stimulation (with
two sinusoids on the two electrodes, both at 2 kHz) did not result
in activity (Figure 1H). No spiking transient was observed
because we used the slower, 0.5 s duration ramp-up that we
had previously observed to eliminate this transient (Figure 1J;
n = 5 cells from 3 mice). We found (Figure 1Iii) that interferential
stimulation with a difference frequency of 10 Hz resulted in spike
or burst occurrence frequencies of 10.23 ± 0.61 Hz for a 2 kHz
carrier frequency (n = 8 cells from 4 mice; see Table S1 for full
statistics associated with Figure 1Iii). The timing of the spikes
or the first spikes of bursts, relative to the peak of the TI enve-
lope, was �2.8 ± 4.8 ms, i.e., when the envelope amplitude
was >97% of its peak amplitude, which was not different from
cells from 3 mice), TI stimulation with 2 kHz + 2.01 kHz (current sum 733 ± 100 mA, n = 8 cells from 4 mice), stimulation with two sinusoids at 2 kHz (current sum
880 ± 178 mA, n = 5 cells from 3 mice). Dashed lines, mean spontaneous firing rate; stimulation duration, �2 s; ��� indicates p < 1.0E-20 for comparison of mean

10 Hz sinusoid peak (�1.3 ± 2.2 ms; pairwise t test, p = 0.47).
The membrane potential of neurons undergoing TI stimulation
repolarized between single spikes, or between brief bursts of
spikes, to the baseline membrane potential (cortex, �10.36 ±

wise t test; n = 13 cells from 5 mice; hippocampus, 5.5 ±
7.89 mV; p = 0.34; n = 8 cells from 4 mice). The spike frequency
during the 20th bout of TI stimulation (tested in three cells in the
somatosensory cortex from one mouse; 2 s stimulation followed
by 2 s rest) was 9.93 ± 0.2 Hz (mean ± SD), not different from the
spike frequency during the 1st bout (p = 0.95; pairwise t test), and
the spike amplitude during the 20th bout of TI stimulation was not
different from the spike amplitude during the first bout (5.3 ±
3.5 mV, mean amplitude difference ± SD; p = 0.75, pairwise
t test); see Figures S1L–S1N for representative traces. The
membrane potential of neurons undergoing high-frequency
stimulation (with two sinusoids on the two electrodes, both at 2
kHz or at 1 kHz) in both the cortex and the hippocampus was
not different from the baseline membrane potential before the
stimulation (cortex, 1.67 ± 4.87 mV, mean difference from base-
line ± SD, measured 1 s after stimulation onset; p = 0.66, pairwise
t test; n = 11 cells from 5 mice; hippocampus, �1.7 ± 5.39 mV;
p = 0.91; n = 5 cells from 3 mice).
Validation of Steerability Using Computational Modeling
and Tissue Phantom
To explore the effects of interferential stimulation at a physics
level, we modeled the interferential electric field envelope magni-
tude as in Figure 1A but for a variety of electrode configurations,
and we also experimentally assessed these fields by using a
tissue phantom comprising a plastic cylinder filled with saline
(Figure S2). Current sources were isolated in the circuitry as
described in Figure S3. We found that by altering the locations
of the electrodes and by setting the currents appropriately, we
could enable the interferential envelope modulation to be tar-
geted to specific locations. For example, when the electrodes
were arranged in a trapezoidal geometry as in Figure 1A, but
with a narrow base, we obtained, both in simulation and in the
phantom, a peak of envelope modulation near the surface of
the cylinder, at a point in between the two electrodes (Figure 2A),
when both electrode pairs were conducting equal currents (1 mA
in this example). By moving the electrodes that comprise the nar-
row base of the trapezoid further and further apart from each
other, holding the currents constant, we could steer the location
of the peak envelope modulation deeper into the tissue (Fig-
ure 2B), approaching the center of the cylinder as the trapezoid
converged to a rectangle (Figure 2C). The envelope locus (i.e.,
distance out to 1/e of the envelope maximum) in Figure 2C
was approximately two times larger, and the peak envelope
amplitude ten times weaker, than in Figure 2A (see Table 1 for
numerical values associated with these three panels). Thus, it
is possible to steer the envelope peak to have its maximum at
essentially any depth throughout a volume, albeit with a tradeoff
between the locus depth and its width and strength. Varying the
locations of electrodes causes large changes in steering, with
electrode size variation playing a more minor role (Figures
S2A–S2C). These analyses were conducted with a cylindrical
phantom, but similar field distributions were obtained in simula-
tions with a spherical phantom (Figures S2G–S2L).
We next explored whether tuning the currents, while holding
electrode locations constant, could be used to control the field
envelope locus, and in particular to steer the envelope modula-
tion peak away from the centroid of the electrode locations. We
started by taking the electrode configuration of Figure 2C, with
its rectangular geometry, and adjusting the ratio of currents
across the gray versus black electrodes from 1:1 to 1:2.5 (Fig-
ure 2D) and 1:4 (Figure 2E). We found that by changing the current
ratio between the electrode pairs, while keeping the current sum
fixed, the peak envelope modulation became increasingly close
to the electrode pair with the lower current, with the peak moving
20% of the radius away from the center in the 1:2.5 case (Fig-
ure 2D) and 35% of the radius away from the center in the 1:4
case (Figure 2E). This suggests the possibility of ‘‘live steering’’
of activity from one deep site to another within the brain, without
having to physically move the electrodes themselves. By having a
larger number of electrodes on the scalp, and tuning the current
frequencies and amplitudes appropriately, it may be possible to
make the deep targeted stimulation volume smaller, as we
computationally model in Figures S2M and S2N.
Stimulation of Mouse Hippocampus but Not Overlying
Cortex
We next aimed to stimulate a deep structure (i.e., mouse hippo-
campus) while not recruiting overlying structures (i.e., the cor-
tex). We performed simulations like those we did before, but
now for the mouse brain, and predicted that 10 Hz transcranial
stimulation applied to sites at the surface of the skull (Figure S4A)
would broadly recruit neural activity throughout both superficial
and deep structures. In contrast, performing TI stimulation with
a 10 Hz difference frequency (Figure S4B) would, in our models,
result in a peak of 10 Hz envelope modulation at a deep site, with
lower envelope modulation amplitudes in more superficial struc-
tures. Of course, such models make assumptions about brain
electrical parameters and geometry that may vary from brain to
brain (Peratta and Peratta 2010), possess limited spatial resolu-
tion (our anatomical mouse model had x, y, and z resolutions
of 42 mm, 42 mm, and 700 mm, respectively) and do not take
into account differences in neural excitability across cell types
and brain regions. Thus, to assess whether TI stimulation could
indeed recruit activity in deep neural circuits without driving
overlying ones, we compared 10 Hz versus TI stimulation in
anesthetized mice, using the immediate early gene c-fos as a
marker of neural activity, as has been used previously to gauge
the focality of brain stimulation, since c-fos functions in the
mouse cortex and hippocampus as an indicator of activated
neurons (Chen et al., 2015; Dragunow and Robertson 1987;
Reijmers et al., 2007).
As expected, 10 Hz transcranial stimulation (10 s on then 10 s
off, for 20 min) resulted in widespread c-fos expression
(measured 90 min after stimulation) in both the cortex and in
the hippocampus underlying the electrodes (Figures 3A and
3B), with 13.6% ± 2.2% (mean ± SD used throughout) of cortical
cells (as indicated by DAPI-stained nuclei) and 63.9% ± 5.7% of
hippocampal cells c-fos-positive underneath the electrodes (Fig-
ure 3C). In contrast, there was essentially no c-fos activation on

 Figure 2. Steerability of TI, Probed via Both Computational Modeling and a Tissue Phantom
For each condition (A)–(E), we simulated the interferential electric field envelope modulation (projected along: i, x-direction, ii, y-direction) that would result from
electrodes at the locations indicated by the rectangles (the gray electrodes forming a pair, with an alternating current I1 applied at 1 kHz, and the black electrodes
forming a second pair, with an alternating current I2 applied at 1.02 kHz), passing the currents described below in the individual panel caption sections. For exact
coordinates of electrodes and numerical values of the peak envelope modulation amplitude, location, and width, see Table 1. We also experimentally measured in
a tissue phantom (a non-conductive cylinder of 50 mm diameter and 10 mm height that was filled with a saline solution, with 1 mm diameter silver wire electrodes
at various points around the perimeter of the phantom) these two amplitudes (iii, x-direction, iv, y-direction); channels were isolated as described in Figure S3.
Finally, we plotted, along line cuts through the simulated (lines) and experimental (dots) datasets, the interferential electric field envelope amplitudes for the
x-direction (v) and the y-direction (vi). Simulated and experimental values along the vertical line cut were plotted in gray, and along the horizontal line cut, in black;
values were normalized to the peak. Color-maps in i-iv are in V/m. Envelope modulation amplitude maps in iii and iv are a linear interpolation of the measured
values. Distances in v and vi were normalized to the phantom’s radius and shown relative to the center of the phantom. Circles in line plots v and vi are measured
envelope modulation amplitudes without interpolation.

 the contralateral side (see Table S2 for complete statistics for
Figure 3). Driving the brain with a 2 kHz transcranial current
(with the same current magnitude and durations as in the
10 Hz case) resulted in essentially no c-fos positive cells (Figures
3D–3F), in either the cortex or the hippocampus, and on either
the electrode-bearing or contralateral side. In contrast, when
TI stimulation was applied with frequencies of 2 kHz and
2.01 kHz (with the same current magnitude and duration as in
the 10 Hz case), the hippocampus was strongly activated, Fig-
ures 3G and 3H, with c-fos in 53.12% ± 14.5% of DAPI-labeled
cells (Figure 3I), not significantly different from that recruited
by the 10 Hz stimulation (Figure 3C). But, despite the strong
hippocampal recruitment, there was essentially zero c-fos in
cortical cells—both at a site between the stimulating electrodes
where the cortical envelope modulation field would be antici-
pated to be at its highest value in the cortex, with c-fos in
0.48% ± 0.47% of DAPI-labeled cells, and directly underneath
an electrode, with c-fos in 0.32% ± 0.29% of DAPI-labeled cells
(Figure 3I). Thus, TI stimulation can recruit neural activation in
a deep structure such as the hippocampus without recruiting
the overlying cortex. As a control experiment, we separated
the electrodes by a larger distance, which would be expected
to reduce the envelope modulation field amplitude (Figure S4C),
and obtained no activation in the cortex or hippocampus (Fig-
ures S4D–S4F).
We did not observe seizures during or after any of these stim-
ulation paradigms (i.e., 10 Hz, 2 kHz, or TI stimulation). Further-
more, c-fos staining was always observed only on the ipsilateral
side of stimulation, and not in other analyzed regions, including
below the hippocampus or in the contralateral hippocampus,
consistent with a local (as opposed to propagating) neural activ-
ity profile. The high c-fos expression observed in the dentate
gyrus is consistent with c-fos expression patterns observed in
rats after strong, unilateral electrical stimulation of the hippo-
campus via an implanted electrode in animals treated with car-
bamazepine, which prevents seizures and also prevents bilateral
c-fos staining upon unilateral stimulation (Dragunow and Robert-
son, 1987).
Safety Characterization of TI Stimulation
To characterize the safety profile of TI stimulation, we immuno-
histochemically examined cellular and synaptic molecular pro-
files in the cortex and the hippocampus after unilateral TI stimu-
lation (2 kHz and 2.01 kHz, 10 s on then 10 s off, for 20 min), as in
Figures 3G–3I, but in awake, behaving mice. Mice were sacri-
ficed and transcardially perfused after a 24 hr recovery period
to allow for detection of persistent effects (e.g., caspase-3 acti-
vation) after a bout of stimulation. Brain sections were fluores-
cently stained with antibodies for the neuronal marker NeuN
(Wolf et al., 1996), the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3
(D’Amelio et al., 2012), the DNA damage marker gH2AX (Mah
et al., 2010), the microglial marker Iba1 (Ito et al., 1998), the
astrocyte marker GFAP (Eng et al., 2000), and the synaptic pro-

to bregma: at anteroposterior (AP) �2 mm, mediolateral (ML) �0.25 mm, and AP �2 mm, ML 2.75 mm). Currents (125 mA per electrode pair) were applied in a
10 s-on, 10 s-off pattern for 20 min. Shown is a representative image montage of a slice of stimulated brain showing c-fos expression (stained with anti-c-fos,

 amplitudes set to 0 mA (Sham). We found that TI stimulation did
not alter the neuronal density or affect the number of apoptotic
cells (Figures 4A and 4B, Figures S5A and S5B, Figure S5J) or
induce DNA damage (Figures 4C and 4D, Figures S5C and
S5D, Figure S5K), at least as reflected by the stains above, rela-
tive to unstimulated or Sham stimulated brains. In addition, TI
stimulation did not alter the intensity and density of Iba1 positive
cells (Figures 4E and 4F, Figures S5G and S5H, Figure S5M) or
GFAP-positive cells (Figures S5N and S5O), suggesting a lack
of reactive microglia and astrocytes, respectively, in response
to TI stimulation. Finally, TI stimulation did not alter synaptophy-
sin intensity, suggesting no changes to synapse density (Figures
4G and 4H, Figures S5E and S5F, Figure S5L). See Table S3 for
full statistics for these experiments, analyzed over cortical and
hippocampal regions.
To assess whether high-frequency electric fields heat the
brain, we measured brain temperature during stimulation with
2 kHz fields (60 s with 0.5 s ramp-up and ramp-down periods)
that were applied via an electrode configuration as in Figures
4A–4H. We measured temperature with a 1-mm-diameter ther-
mocouple probe inserted into the cortex underneath the lateral
electrode. We found that the maximal temperature increase at
this cortical location during stimulation was 0.069 ± 0.05 C�
(mean ± SD increase from baseline temperature; n = 6 mice).
This change in brain temperature was not larger than the largest
spontaneous deviations from baseline seen during the pre- and
post-stimulation periods (Figure 4I; p = 0.81, one-way ANOVA;
see Table S3 for full statistics for Figure 4I).
Steerable Probing of Motor Functionality without
Electrode Movement
We next explored the capability of TI stimulation to activate
neurons so as to drive movements. Using ketamine-xylazine
anesthetized mice, we applied a current I1 via an electrode that
was positioned on the skull above the motor cortex region
associated with a movement of the contralateral forepaw and a
current I2 via a second electrode that was positioned on the
contralateral skull, above the motor cortex region associated
with movement of the whiskers ipsilateral to the I1 electrode (Fig-
ure 5A) (Tennant et al., 2011).
We first established the motor threshold by systematically
increasing the current sum I1 + I2 in steps of 50 mA while keeping
the current ratio I1 : I2 fixed at 1 : 4. We found that if I1 and I2 were
applied with a carrier frequency of 2 kHz and a difference
frequency of 10 Hz, the stimulation evoked a 10 Hz periodic
movement of the contralateral forepaw with a motor threshold
of 916 ± 129 mA (Figure 5B; mean ± SD, n = 6 mice). If I1 and I2
were applied at the same frequency, no motor movement was
observed (n = 9 mice; assessed up to a current sum value of
2 mA). Changing the difference frequency between 1 Hz and
15 Hz changed the motion frequency accordingly, but not
the motor threshold (p = 0.88; one-way ANOVA; n = 6 mice; Fig-
ure 5B and Movie S1; see Table S4 for full statistics associated
with Figure 5B). Increasing the carrier frequency from 1 kHz to
4 kHz linearly increased the motor threshold with a slope of
250 mA/kHz (linear regression, R2 = 0:99; Figure 5C and Movie
S2; see Table S4 for full statistics associated with Figure 5C); a
5 kHz carrier resulted in no response at the maximum current
sum value tested (2 mA).
We next sought to test whether steering the site of stimulation
by changing the current ratio I1 : I2, as in our physics experi-
ments (Figures 2C–2E), would shift the site of motor cortex acti-
vation. We changed the current ratio I1 : I2, keeping I1 + I2 fixed,
and measured movements evoked in the forepaws, whiskers,
and ears (see Movie S3 for representative video). We found
that when I1 < I2 (that is, stimulation was steered toward the I1
electrode), TI stimulation evoked a movement of the forepaw
(Figure 5Di, p = 0.00004, Fisher’s exact test, n = 9 mice) and
the whiskers (Figure 5Ei, p = 0.002, n = 9 mice) contralateral to
the I1 electrode, but no movements ipsilateral to the I1 electrode
(Figures 5Di–5Fi; see Table S4 for full statistics associated
with Figures 5Di–5Fi). In contrast, when I1 > I2 (stimulation was
steered toward the I2 electrode), TI stimulation evoked a move-
ment of the whiskers (Figure 5Ei, p = 0.002, n = 9 mice) and
ear (Figure 5Fi, p = 0.03, n = 9 mice) ipsilateral to the I1 electrode
but no movements contralateral to the I1 electrode (Figures
5Di–5Fi).
The movement of the forepaw contralateral to the I1 electrode
was maximal when the current ratio I1 : I2 was 1 : 8, i.e., our
condition in which stimulation was maximally steered toward
the I1 electrode (1.24 ± 0.36 mm, mean movement ± SD used
throughout; p = 0.000007, unpaired t test versus null hypothesis
of no movement, thresholding at p < 0.0025 Bonferroni corrected
for multiple comparisons; n = 9 mice) and gradually decreased as
the current ratio increased (Figure 5Dii). (Perhaps because the
electrodes were not placed symmetrically, the movement of the
forepaw ipsilateral to the I1 electrode, though not statistically sig-
nificant, showed an opposite pattern, with a maximal movement
when the current ratio was 8 : 1, i.e., when stimulation was maxi-
mally steered toward the I2 electrode [Figure 5Dii, 0.2 ± 0.6 mm,
p = 0.35, n = 9 mice].) The movement of the whiskers contralateral
to the I1 electrode was maximal when the current ratio I1 : I2 was
1 : 4, i.e., stimulation was partially steered toward the I1 electrode
(0.4 ± 0.41 mm, p = 0.018, n = 9 mice) and gradually decreased as
the current ratio varied from this maximum (Figure 5Eii; the
1:8 condition steers the stimulation more laterally than the 1:4

 condition, which perhaps stimulated cortical regions more lateral
to the whisker region [Tennant et al., 2011], and thus elicited a
lower whisker movement amplitude than that elicited by the 1:4
condition). In contrast, perhaps due to the asymmetrical location
of our electrodes, the movement of the whisker ipsilateral to the I1
electrode was maximal when the current ratio I1 : I2 was 8 : 1, i.e.,
stimulation was maximally steered toward the I2 electrode (0.96 ±
0.75 mm, p = 0.0016, n = 9 mice) and gradually decreased as the
current ratio decreased (Figure 5Eii). A similar trend was seen for
the ears (Figure 5Fii; see Table S4 for full statistics associated
with Figures 5Dii–5Fii). Thus, TI stimulation can support steering
of brain stimulation without physical electrode movement, result-
ing in tunable elicitation of movements.
DISCUSSION
In this paper, we present TI stimulation, validating the concept by
using modeling as well as both physics and neurophysiology ex-
periments, and demonstrate its utility by performing stimulation
of a deep region (mouse hippocampus) without stimulating over-
lying neurons (cortex), as well as steerable brain stimulation of
motor patterns without physical electrode movement. Future
studies, perhaps using larger numbers of electrodes and multiple
sets of interfering fields, may be able to pinpoint even smaller re-
gions of the brain, or multiple regions of the brain. An open ques-
tion is how small a focal volume may be achieved. At some point,
inhomogeneities in the gray and white matter of the brain may
cause difficulty in improving the resolution below that spatial
scale, although MRI scans and data-driven sculpting of the elec-
tric fields may be able to compensate for this to some degree.
How generalizable might be the effects observed here? There
have been reports that strong kHz-frequency electric fields can
block the propagation of compound action potentials in periph-
eral nerves (Cuellar et al., 2013; Kilgore and Bhadra 2014).
Such effects were localized to the immediate vicinity of the elec-
trodes, leaving regions a few millimeters away, perhaps where
the magnitude of the fields was lower, unaffected. The magnitude
of the fields used in our study to transcranially recruit neural activ-
ity in the brain were perhaps one to two orders of magnitude
weaker than in these earlier studies, so we anticipate that such ef-
fects may have been minimal in our study. This is consistent with
our repeatable observation of a lack of physiological effect of
2 kHz electric fields on brain activity. However, future studies
might seek to explore how stronger kHz-frequency electric fields
affect the brain. Such data might also present an upper limit to the
field strengths applicable for TI stimulation. There has been a
report of kHz-frequency transcranial electric field stimulation
(1–5 kHz) that resulted in neural plasticity similar to that resulting
from anodal DC stimulation (Chaieb et al., 2011), but a later report
found that 5 kHz transcranial electric fields, grouped intheta burst
patterns, did not result in neural plasticity (Kunz et al., 2017). In
our current dataset, we did not observe effects of kHz-frequency
electric fields beyond a brief transient that was observed when
short ramp-up times were used (but not with longer ramp-up
times), both suggesting that, in studies using kHz-frequency
fields, subtle parameters of the stimulation may help determine
exactly what effects on neural activity result and presenting an
area for future exploration. We found that TI stimulation at ampli-
tudes sufficient to recruit deep brain structures, such as the hip-
pocampus, did not alter the neuronal and synaptic integrity of the
underlying tissue 24 hr after stimulation, at least as reflected by
the stains we used. Additional time points other than 24 hr post
stimulation may provide, in the future, a more detailed picture
of the safety of TI stimulation. Furthermore, the safety profile of
TI stimulation associated with evoked behavior patterns, such
as those utilized here, should be explored in the future.
Given the remarkable therapeutic benefits of DBS for patients
with otherwise treatment-resistant movement and affective dis-
orders (Kringelbach et al., 2007), the prospects for noninvasive
DBS using electricity are potentially exciting. Other methods
for noninvasive DBS have been proposed, e.g., using transcra-
nial ultrasound (Legon et al., 2014) or using expression of heat-
sensitive receptors and injection of thermomagnetic nanopar-
ticles (Chen et al., 2015), but the unknown mechanism of action
(Plaksin et al., 2014) and the need to genetically manipulate the
brain, respectively, may limit their immediate use in humans.
TI stimulation may thus represent a practical strategy for non-
invasively stimulating neurons deep in the brain. It uses familiar
and well-tested electric fields (Stavroulakis 2014; International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, 2010) and
does not require chemical or genetic manipulation of the brain.
We anticipate that it might rapidly be deployable into human clin-
ical trials, as well as studies of the human brain.

(A) Currents I1 and I2 were applied simultaneously (0.5 s ramp-up, 6 s stimulation, 0.5 s ramp-down) to anesthetized head-fixed mice and motor activity was video-
recorded (including 1.5 s pre-stimulation and post-stimulation periods). Current I1 was applied via a 1 mm diameter skull electrode (white circle; relative to
bregma, AP �1.5 mm, ML +2 mm, n = 5 mice; or AP �1.5 mm, ML �2 mm, n = 4 mice) paired with a 5-8 mm diameter electrode (white ellipse). Current I2 was
applied via a similarly sized skull electrode (black circle; relative to bregma, AP �1.5 mm, ML �0.5 mm, n = 5 mice; or AP �1.5 mm, ML +0.5 mm, n = 4 mice)
paired with a 5-8 mm diameter electrode (black ellipse).

METHOD DETAILS
Design and Implementation of the TI Stimulator
The kHz currents were generated using a custom made device consisting of two electrically isolated current sources. To isolate the
channels, each waveform was supplied via a balanced pair of current sources that were driven in precisely opposite phase with a
ground electrode carrying any imbalance currents (< 1%) from the paired current sources, preventing charging of the body relative
to earth ground (Figure S3A). Each current source reliably drove 2 mA of current on 1 kU loads up to a frequency of 10 kHz with a
resolution of 0.02Hz (Figures S3C and S3D). At load resistances higher than 10 kU the current source eventually saturated. The cur-
rent output had a leakage level < 0.1 mA root mean square (RMS) at 100 kHz bandwidth, measured on a 1 kU load resistor with a
differential amplifier (7A22, Tektronix). The total harmonic distortion of the current source was < 0.08% at 100 Hz and < 0.4% at
10 kHz (measured with 9 harmonics on a 1 kU load resistor). The total harmonic distortion and frequency cross-talk were measured
using an FFT spectrum analyzer (SR770, Stanford Research). When the two current sources were applied to a common conductive
load, e.g., a resistive bridge (Figure S3B) or a saline bath (Figure S3E), the cross-talk at the terminals of each channel was < 0.1%,
allowing almost 100% of the interference to build up inside the load. In comparison, without the anti-phasic drive, approximately 30%
cross-talk was measured at both the channel terminals and inside the conductive medium (Figure S3B, Figure S3F).
In-Vivo Rodent Electrophysiology
Surgical Procedures
On the day of the experiment, the mice were injected with Meloxicam (1mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) and anesthetized with
1%–2% (vol/vol) isoflurane in oxygen. Ophthalmic ointment (Puralube Vet Ointment, Dechra) was applied to the eyes. The scalp and
the ventral torso were shaved and sterilized with Betadine and 70% ethanol. Two electrodes made of saline-filled polyimide tubes
(Vention Medical Inc) with 1.5 mm outer diameter and 1.4 mm inner diameter or two electrodes made of adhesive electrogel with
1.5 mm diameter (SignaGel, ParkerLabs) were affixed to the skull (polyimide tubes were affixed using dental acrylic). During cortical
recording, the positions of the skull electrodes relative to bregma were anteroposterior (AP) �1 mm, mediolateral (ML) �1.5 mm, and
AP �1 mm, ML �2 mm; during hippocampus recording, their positions relative to bregma were: AP �2 mm, ML 0.25 mm, and
AP �2 mm, ML �2.75 mm.
In Vivo Transcranial Stimulation
Transcranial stimulation was applied to anesthetized mice via the two skull electrodes, described above. Each skull electrode was
paired with a cloth-base electrode (11 mm diameter conductive area; EL504, BioPac Inc) that was attached to the ventral torso with
adhesive electrode gel (for the experiments of Figure 1D-F,Ii; SignaGel, Parker Laboratories Inc; 10-15 mm spacing between the
edge of the conductive area of the torso electrodes) or with an adhesive electrode gel based electrode (SignaGel, ParkerLabs) on
the cheeks (for the experiments of Figure 1G-H,Iii; approximately 11 mm diameter conductive area). Stimulation was applied for
1.5-2 s periods, with 0.25-0.5 s duration ramp-on periods and 0-0.5 s duration ramp-off periods, with at least a 2 s rest period
between consecutive stimulations.
Whole-Cell Patch Clamp Recording
In vivo whole cell patching in current clamp mode (i.e., 0 pA holding current) was conducted in the cortex (depth of �500 mm below the
dura) and CA1 layer of the hippocampus (depth of 1131 ± 157 mm below the dura) of anesthetized mice with an autopatcher (Kodan-
daramaiah et al., 2012). Data were acquired using pClamp software (Molecular Devices) at a 400 kHz sampling rate. Patch electrodes
were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillary tubing using a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments). Tip electrode resistance was
4.6–7.4 MU in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), containing 126 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM
MgSO4, 24 mM NaHCO3 and 10 mM glucose). The patch electrode solution consisted of (in mM) potassium gluconate 122.5,
KCl 12.5, KOH-HEPES 10, KOH-EGTA 0.2, Mg-ATP 2, Na3-GTP 0.3, NaCl 8 (pH 7.35, mOsm 296), with 0.2–0.4 mg/ml biocytin added
immediately before use. Capacitance, series resistance and input resistance were frequently measured throughout recording to

 monitor patch quality and cell health, using 10-pA hyperpolarization/depolarization square current pulses; a 300 pA ramp depolar-
ization over 500 ms was used for AP generation.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using MATLAB (MathWorks). The recorded traces from each neuron were split into blocks corresponding to each
trial within an experiment. Each block consisted of a single stimulation period of 1.5 �2 s duration with 1 s of baseline recorded before
and after each stimulation period. To reduce stimulation artifacts for spike identification, traces were filtered using a 5th order Butter-
worth band-stop filter with cutoff frequencies of 1 kHz and 15 kHz and then with a 3rd order Butterworth high-pass filter with a cutoff
frequency of 100 Hz (representative traces from the cortex are shown in the Supplemental Materials without filtering and after filtering
with only the band-stop filter; representative traces from the hippocampus are shown after filtering with only the band-stop filter).
Single spikes were identified using a running window average that picked out depolarizations of > 40 mV above baseline, which
were ‘‘peaky’’ (that is, exhibited amplitudes larger than the average amplitudes of the nearest 3 data points before and after,
by > 0.001 mV). Consecutive spikes with inter-spike interval % 15 ms, which occurred during a period of 50 ms or less, were defined
as a spiking burst. Mean spiking frequency during stimulation periods (not including the ramping periods) was computed for each
stimulation block and then averaged across neurons for each stimulation condition. Mean spontaneous firing rate was computed
by a similar averaging of the firing rates across neurons, but for the 1 s interval before stimulation began. In the case of control
1 kHz or 2 kHz stimulation with no TI, we analyzed data from all complete blocks. Mean membrane potential was computed for a
500 ms period before the onset of 2 kHz or 1 kHz stimulation and was compared with a similar 500 ms period 1 s after stimulation
onset, by dividing each period to 10 equally sized epochs and averaging across epochs. Overall, 18 neurons from 8 mice were
analyzed with a minimal and maximal number of neurons per mouse of 1 and 4, respectively.
In-Vivo Stimulation Followed by c-fos Staining
Surgical Procedure
On the day of the experiment, to reduce background fos staining, mice were kept undisturbed in the dark, with full access to food and
water, for at least an hour after being transferred from the animal facility to the experimental procedure room. Mice were injected with
Meloxicam (1mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) and anesthetized with 1%–2% (vol/vol) isoflurane in oxygen. The scalp and the
ventral torso were shaved and sterilized with Betadine and 70% ethanol. Two cloth-base electrodes with 11 mm diameter conductive
area (EL504, BioPac) were attached to the ventral torso with saline electrode gel (SignaGel, Parker Laboratories). The spacing
between the edge of the two conductive areas was 10-15 mm. The mice were then placed in a custom stereotax, with ophthalmic
ointment (Puralube Vet Ointment, Dechra) applied to the eyes, and with Betadine and 70% ethanol used to sterilize the surgical area.
Two polyimide tubes (Vention Medical) with 1.5 mm outer diameter and 1.4 mm inner diameter were affixed to the skull using dental
acrylic (C&B Metabond, Parkell). One polyimide tube was located at stereotactic coordinates (relative to bregma) of anteroposterior
�2 mm, mediolateral, �0.25 mm. The second polyimide tube was located to the left of the first tube, with a gap between the edges
of the electrodes of between 1.5 and 4 mm. Once the dental acrylic set (�20 min), the mice were removed from the stereotactic
apparatus and placed in a custom-built low profile holder. The polyimide tubes were filled with saline solution and a silver wire of
0.25 mm diameter (Sigma-Aldrich) was inserted into each tube for connection to the stimulator.
In Vivo Transcranial Stimulation
The cranial tube electrodes and the cloth-base ventral torso electrodes were connected to the stimulator so that each cranial tube
electrode was paired with one cloth-base ventral torso electrode. The complex impedance between each pair of electrodes was es-
tablished by applying short currents of low amplitude (10 Hz and 2 kHz, 10 mA, 0.5 s) and measuring the applied current and resultant
voltage waveforms. When the resistance between a pair of electrodes was higher than 1 MU, a dental drill was used to thin the skull
area inside polyimide tubes (high impedance often resulted from a layer of dental acrylic that leaked into the polyimide tubes and
hardened on the skull in that area). 10 s intervals of electrical stimulation, with 0.25 s ramp-on and ramp-off periods, were applied
interspersed with 10 s rest intervals over a 20 min experimental time course. Mice were sacrificed after 90 min to allow for c-fos
expression.
Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and Imaging
Mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and sacrificed, then transcardially perfused with cold phosphate-buffered sa-
line (PBS) followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1 x PBS. The brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at
4�C overnight. Free-floating vibratome coronal sections (35 mm) were cut and incubated in a blocking solution containing 10% normal
donkey serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide in 1 x PBS for 2 hr at room temperature (RT).
Sections were labeled with primary anti-c-Fos antibody (1:400; sc-52; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) in the blocking solution at 4�C
overnight, followed by the Alexa488-conjugated (1:1000; Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific) secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT. Sli-
ces were incubated for 20min in 1 x DAPI dye (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBS at RT to label cell nuclei. Samples were then
washed 4 3 15 min in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunolabeled brain sections were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong
Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and stored at �20�C. Images of the cortical and hippocampal areas
from the stimulated and unstimulated sides of the brain were acquired using a high-resolution multi-channel (sequential) scanning
confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Germany), using a 10x air objective (NA 0.45).

 c-fos Quantification
Greyscale images were analyzed using MATLAB (MathWorks). Each greyscale image was processed with contrast-limited adaptive
histogram equalization (128 tiles per image) followed by Wiener adaptive noise-removal lowpass filtering (using 5x5 neighboring
pixels to estimate the local image mean and SD). DAPI and GFP greyscale images were converted to black and white (BW) masks
with global image thresholds established using Otsu’s method. BW masks were smoothed using a morphological disc kernel with a
radius of 2 pixels. Masks were visually inspected and Otsu’s threshold was adjusted when required. Cells were quantified from the
masked DAPI images. A cell was defined as a region with more than 20 and less than 100 connected pixels. Regions with less than 20
connected pixels were ignored. The number of cells in regions with more than 100 connected pixels was estimated by dividing the
number of connected pixels by 100 - the maximal number of connected pixels defined per cell. DAPI cells expressing GFP were
quantified from the corresponding GFP BW mask. A cell expressing GFP was defined as a DAPI cell region with connected GFP
pixels. The percentage of c-fos expressing cells (a DAPI cell region with connected GFP pixels) was computed in 512 mm x
512 mm regions of interest in the cortex underneath the lateral electrode, the cortex between the electrodes, and the dentate gyrus
region of the hippocampus, as well as the corresponding contralateral cortical and hippocampal regions.
Brain Slice Montages
GFP greyscale images were converted to RGB images. Images from a single brain slice were visually rearranged and overlapped to
form a montage of the imaged slice.
In-Vivo Stimulation in Awake Mice Followed by Staining for Cell and Synapse Markers
Surgical Procedure And Animal Habituation
On the day of the surgery, the mice were injected with Meloxicam (1mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) and were anesthetized
with 1%–2% (vol/vol) isoflurane in oxygen and placed in a stereotactic frame. The scalp was shaved, ophthalmic ointment (Puralube
Vet Ointment, Dechra) was applied to the eyes, and Betadine and 70% ethanol were used to sterilize the surgical area. The scalp was
opened and a custom stainless steel headplate was affixed to the skull using dental acrylic (C&B Metabond, Parkell), and the mice
were then recovered. Headfixed awake mice were then habituated to restraint for three consecutive days for 15, 30 and 45 min
respectively. During this time the animals were placed in a cylinder-shaped tube. Animals were rewarded with sweetened condensed
milk (diluted 1:2 in water) every 5-10 min during habituation.
In Vivo Transcranial Stimulation
On the day of stimulation, part of the dental cement was removed to enable cranial electrode placement. The stimulation procedure
was as described in the ‘In-vivo stimulation followed by c-Fos staining’ section, but electrodes were made of conductive paste
(Ten20, Weaver and Company) instead of polyimide tubes filled with saline. The center of one cranial electrode was placed at a point
at the midline and �1.5 mm anteroposterior from bregma, and the center of the second cranial electrode was located laterally
at +2 mm mediolateral from bregma and at the same anteroposterior coordinate. Each cranial electrode was paired with a larger
(approximately 8 mm diameter) electrode that was made of the same conductive paste and was located on the ipsilateral cheek.
The complex impedance between each pair of electrodes was established by applying short currents of low amplitude (10 Hz
and 2 kHz, 10 mA, 0.5 s) and measuring the applied current and observed voltage waveforms. The stimulation protocol comprised
10 s intervals of electrical stimulation with 0.25 s ramp-on and ramp-off periods, with 10 s rest intervals in between, over a 20 min
period. The lateral electrode was driven at a frequency of 2 kHz and current amplitude of 125 mA and the medial electrode was driven
at a frequency of 2.01 kHz and a current amplitude of 125 mA. In the case of Sham stimulation, the amplitude of both currents was set
to 0 mA; the rest of the procedure was identical.
Histology, immunohistochemistry, and imaging
Mice were sacrificed and perfused (cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 x PBS) 24 hr later to assess cellular and synaptic integrity by
labeling for the neuronal marker NeuN (1:1000, Synaptic Systems, #266004), astrocyte marker GFAP (1:500, Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy, #12389), microglia marker Iba1 (1:500, Wako Cehmicals, #019-19741), presynaptic marker synaptophysin (1:500, SVP-38,
Sigma, #S5768), apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (1:250, Cell Signaling Technology, #9664) and the DNA damage marker
gH2AX (1:500. anti-phospho-histone H2A.X, Millipore, #05-636). For immunostaining, 40 mm sections were incubated with blocking
buffer (5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incu-
bated with the sections overnight at 4�C. Primary antibodies were visualized using the appropriate secondary antibody conjugates
(Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594 and Alexa Fluor 647, ThermoFisher Scientific). We used the CK-p25 transgenic mouse, an estab-
lished mouse model of neurodegeneration, which exhibits neuronal atrophy, reduced synaptic density and pronounced DNA damage
(Cruz et al., 2003; Dobbin et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2008), as a positive staining control for yH2AX antibody staining. The samples were
then washed, stained with DAPI (Sigma, #10236276001) and mounted onto glass slides. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM710
laser-scanning confocal microscope using 20x and 40x air objectives, and subsequently analyzed in ImageJ.
In-Vivo Temperature Measurement
Surgical Procedure
Surgical procedures were as described in the ‘In-vivo stimulation followed by c-Fos staining’ section.

 In Vivo Transcranial Stimulation
Stimulation currents (I1, 2 kHz, 500 mA; I2, 2 kHz, 500 mA) were simultaneously applied with 0.5 ramp-up and ramp-down periods via
cranial electrodes that were configured on the skull as described in the ‘In-vivo stimulation in awake mice followed by staining for cell
and synapse markers’ section.
Intracranial Temperature Measurement
A 1 mm diameter thermocouple (type ‘‘K’’ dual 36 Gauge with Teflon insulation. 36 TT-K-36, OMEGA Engineering) was inserted to the
brain underneath the lateral electrode via a 2 mm diameter craniotomy, and continuous temperature measurements were obtained
with a temperature logger (NI USB TC01, National Instruments) during 60 s of stimulation as described above, as well as during 30 s
periods before and after stimulation.
In-Vivo Stimulation with Spatial Probing of Motor Cortex Functionality
Surgical Procedure and In Vivo Transcranial Stimulation
On the day of the experiment, mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Ophthalmic ointment
(Puralube Vet Ointment, Dechra) was applied to the eyes. The scalp was shaved and sterilized with Betadine and 70% ethanol
and the mice were headfixed. Two electrically isolated currents I1 and I2 were applied transcranially via electrodes that were
made of conductive paste (1 mm diameter; Ten20, Weaver and Company) and connected to the stimulator via thin silver wires.
Current I1 was applied via the skull electrode that was located at coordinates relative to bregma AP �1.5 mm, ML +2 mm (n = 5
mice) or ML �2 mm (n = 4 mice). Current I2 was applied via the skull electrode that was located 2.5 mm laterally to the I1 electrode
(distance between centers of electrodes). Both skull electrodes were paired with a 5-8 mm diameter electrode, made of adhesive
electrode gel (SignaGel, ParkerLabs), that was attached to the ipsilateral cheek. Stimulation blocks comprised a 0.5 s ramp-up
period, a 6 s stimulation period and a 0.5 s ramp-down period. There was approximately 10 s interval between consecutive stimu-
lation blocks.
Recording of Motor Activity
Motor activities were recorded using a video camera (Fujinon, YV10x5B-2, 1:1 3/5-50mm 1/3’’ CS), over a period lasting from 1.5 s
pre-stimulation until 1.5 s post-stimulation. The period of stimulation was indicated to the camera with a green LED that was posi-
tioned behind a post to avoid a direct illumination of the animal eye.
Data Analysis
Motor activities were analyzed offline using MATLAB (MathWorks). Movements of the forepaws and whiskers were measured with
the help of an in-frame ruler. In the case of whisker movement, we analyzed movements of the whisker that showed the maximal
periodic movement amplitude during stimulation. Movements of the ears were scored by three independent researchers who
were blind to the stimulation conditions, per the following scale: 0, no movement; 1, weak movement; 2, strong movement; 3,
very strong movement. Prior to scoring movements, the researchers were shown one example video with a weak movement and
one example video with a very strong movement, to help calibrate their numerical judgments (these training videos were not included
in the analysis).
Phantom Electric Field Measurements
Phantom Construction
A phantom was constructed from a 50 mm diameter petri dish. We mounted sixteen 1 mm diameter silver wire electrodes with equal
spacing along the circumference of the phantom (i.e., an interelectrode spacing of 9.8 mm). The electrodes were connected to a
24-channel adaptor box that was connected to the TI stimulator. The phantom was filled with sodium chloride solution. The salt con-
centration was adjusted until an inter-electrode impedance of 3 kOhm was measured between two opposite electrodes.
Electric Field Measurement
The electric field was measured using two orthogonal 3.6 mm-spaced dipole electrodes constructed from medical stainless steel
needle electrodes. The location of the probe was adjusted across an 36 mm 3 36 mm matrix with 6 mm steps using two large range
motorized linear stages (Compumotor NEMA 23 types Model S57-51-MO, Parker Hannifin Corporation). The signal from each dipole
electrode was fed into two separate custom built ultra-high input impedance differential electrometer type buffer amplifiers and then
the outputs of these amplifiers were differentially fed into lock-in amplifiers (SR830, Stanford Research Systems) before readout with
a digital multimeter (3457A, Hewlett Packard). The movements of the probe and the readouts of the measurements from the digital
multimeter were controlled by a Labview script. The measurements at each location were averaged several times to reduce noise.
Post-processing
For 2D electric field maps, measurement points were linearly interpolated (with interpolation factor 2) using MATLAB’s interp2 function.
Electromagnetic FEM Simulation
Electromagnetic Field Computation
Electromagnetic simulations were performed on the Sim4Life platform (Zurich MedTech AG) using the ‘stationary current’ solver - a
real valued quasi-electrostatic finite element method (FEM) solver for the ohmic current dominated regime. The simulation solved the
equation VsVf = 0, where s is the local electrical conductivity and f is the electric potential from which the electric field and the
current density can be obtained as E
!= � Vf and j
!= s, E
! respectively. The solver is suitable for the frequencies used in this paper,
e5
Cell 169, 1029–1041.e1–e7, June 1, 2017
 as displacement currents can be neglected compared to ohmic ones. The solver discretizes the model using adaptive, rectilinear
meshes. Tissue properties have been assigned according to the IT’IS Foundation database of tissue properties (Hasgall et al.,
2015). The same conductivity values were used at all frequencies. The stimulating currents were normalized by integrating the normal
current density over a surface surrounding an electrode. The simulations were performed with Dirichlet boundary conditions at active
electrodes. The spatial distribution of the envelope modulation amplitude caused by temporal interference was computed from the
fields of both electrode pairs using

Phantom Model
The homogeneous phantom model consisted of a saline medium with a conductivity of s = 0:333 S=m. The inhomogeneous (‘4-layer’)
model consisted of scalp (d = 0:05R, s = 0:333 S=m), skull (d = 0:085R, s = 0:0083 S=m), cerebrospinal fluid (d = 0:023R, s = 1:79 S=m)
and brain (d = 0:83R, s = 0:333 S=m) layers, where d is the layer thickness normalized to the overall sphere’s radius R.
Mouse Model
A computational mouse model (IT’IS Foundation, Male OF1 Mouse) was developed by segmentation of a male OF1 Mouse, weighing
35.5 g, according to the method described in (Kainz et al., 2006). The resolution of the model in the x, y, z directions was 42 mm, 42 mm
and 700 mm, respectively. The model did not include CSF. The model was fitted with two small cranial electrodes with outer radius of
0.5 mm and inner radius of 0.17 mm filled with saline ðs = 0:333 S=mÞ and two large surface electrodes of radius 2.2 mm with conduc-
tive gel ðs = 1:79 S=mÞ on the ventral torso. The grid resolution in the electrode vicinity was high (0.04 mm) to properly resolve field
gradients, while the coarsest grid step in the exposed area was in the order of 0.12 mm.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The reasoning behind our sample sizes is not based upon a power analysis, since the goal was to create a new technology. As noted
in (Dell et al., 2002), ‘‘In experiments based on the success or failure of a desired goal, the number of animals required is difficult to
estimate...’’ As noted in the aforementioned paper, ‘‘The number of animals required is usually estimated by experience instead of by
any formal statistical calculation, although the procedures will be terminated [when the goal is achieved].’’ These numbers reflect our
past experience in developing neurotechnologies.

simultaneously applied to the phantom via a second pair of surface electrodes (black) at a �kHz frequency f2 = f1 + Df where Df � f1. The electrodes were
electrically isolated. The spatial distributions of the electric fields E1 and E2, from currents I1 and I2 respectively, were simulated independently using a finite
element method. The spatial distribution of the envelope modulation amplitude from the superposition of E1 and E2 was computed for a projection direction radial

 Figure S3. Design, Implementation, and Characterization of TI Stimulator, Related to Figures 2–5 and STAR Methods
Stimulating currents were generated using a custom device consisting of two electrically isolated current sources. To isolate the channels, each waveform was
supplied via a balanced pair of current sources that were driven in precisely opposite phase, a technique that we call anti-phasic current drive.
(A) Schematics of the electronic circuitry of the stimulator. (i) Dual channel stimulation with anti-phasic current drive isolation. In channel 1 ðCH1Þ, a voltage
waveform V1 at a frequency f1 was applied to the positive (+) input of a voltage-controlled current source (J1) that had its negative (�) input grounded, resulting in a
current waveform I1 at node 1A that was in-phase with waveform V1: An equal voltage waveform V1 at a frequency f1 was applied to the negative (�) input of a
second voltage-controlled current source (J2) that had its positive (+) input grounded, resulting in a current waveform �I1 at node 1B that is anti-phase with
waveform V1: In channel 2 ðCH2Þ, a second voltage waveform V2 at a frequency f2 was converted in an equivalent way to an in-phase current waveform I2 at node
2A by a voltage-controlled current source (J3) and to an anti-phase current waveform �I2 at node 2B by a voltage-controlled current source (J4). The amplitude of
current I1 of CH1 between nodes 1A and 1B was calibrated such that I1ðAÞ = ðV1ðVÞ =500Þ and the amplitude of current I2 of CH2 between nodes 2A and 2B was
calibrated such that I2ðAÞ = ð V2ðVÞ=500Þ. A ground or reference electrode (Ref) was provided to carry any imbalance currents from the paired current sources and
to prevent charging of the body relative to earth ground. (ii) Dual channel stimulation without isolation. As in (i), but nodes 1B and 2B were connected to the GND of
the device.
(legend continued on next page)
 (B) Characterization of channel isolation. (i) Schematic of the experiment setup. Voltage waveform V1 of CH1 was set to 1 kHz and 0.5 V resulting in a current I1
between nodes 1A and 1B at the same frequency and an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to a load made of a bridge of 6 resistors
with 1 kU resistance each. Voltage waveform V2 of CH2 was set to 1.1 kHz and 0.5 V resulting in a current I2 between nodes 2A and 2B at the same frequency and
an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 2A and 2B were connected to the same resistor bridge load as shown in the schematics. The frequency spectrum of the
currents was measured using a FFT spectrum analyzer (SR770, Stanford Research) at the output of CH1 between nodes 1A and 1B, the output of CH2 between
nodes 2A and 2B, and across the resistor bridge between nodes 1A and 2B. (ii) Ratio of the FFT amplitude at the cross-talk frequency (i.e., f2 at the output nodes
1A and 1B of CH1 and f1 at the output nodes 2A and 2B of CH2) and the FFT amplitude at the channel’s set frequency (i.e., f1 at the output nodes 1A and 1B of CH1
and f2 at the output nodes 2A and 2B of CH2). FFT ratio across CH1 � CH2 between the output node 1A of CH1 and the output node 2B of CH2 is the ratio of the
FFT amplitude of f1 and the FFT amplitude of f2. (The total harmonic distortion of the current source was < 0.08% at 100 Hz and < 0.4% at 10 kHz, measured with
9 harmonics on 1 kU load resistor.)
(C) Characterization of output current for different load resistances. Voltage waveform V1 of CH1 was set to 1 kHz and 0.5 V resulting in a current I1 between nodes
1A and 1B of the same frequency and an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to loads with resistances between 100 U and 100 kU.
The output nodes 2A and 2B of CH2 were grounded. The current flowing between nodes 1A and 1B was measured using a digital ammeter. The panel shows the
amplitude of the measured currents Imeasured in mA against the load resistance in U.
(D) Characterization of output current for different set frequencies. Voltage waveform V1 of CH1 was set to a range of frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 50 kHz with
a range of amplitudes between 0.5 mV and 0.5 V, resulting in a current I1 between 1A and 1B nodes of the same frequencies and with amplitudes that ranged
between 1 mA and 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to a load with a resistance of 10 kU. The output nodes 2A and 2B of CH2 were grounded.
The current flowing between nodes 1A and 1B was measured using a digital ammeter. The panel shows 7 line plots of the RMS amplitude of the measured
currents Imeasured ðRMSÞ

between 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz are overlapping).
(E and F) Effect of channel isolation on distribution of envelope amplitude. An alternating current I1 was applied to a phantom at a frequency of 1 kHz via one pair of
electrodes (gray). A second alternating current I2 was applied to the phantom at a frequency of 1.02 kHz via a second pair of electrodes (black). The phantom was
a non-conductive cylinder of 50 mm diameter and 10 mm height that was filled with a saline solution. The two pairs of electrodes (gray and black) were placed in
an isosceles trapezoid geometry such that each electrode pair was located at the vertices of one lateral side. The trapezoid had a normalized small base size of
a = 1.39 and a normalized large base size of b = 1.96. The amplitudes of currents I1 and I2 were 1 mA. The envelope modulation amplitude from temporal
interference of two electric fields projected along the b
x and b
y directions was measured using a lock-in amplifier as in Figure 2 (see also STAR Methods for a
detailed description of the phantom measurement). Envelope modulation amplitude maps are a linear interpolation (interpolation factor 2) between the measured
values. Color-maps show values normalized to maximal envelope modulation amplitude. Distances were normalized to the phantom’s radius and are shown
relative to the center of the phantom. High isolation is required between the two current sources in order to focus the region with large envelope modulation
amplitude deep into the phantom.

max. The volume of large envelope modulation amplitude was located along the
midline of trapezoid at its small base with a peak at x = 0 and y = 0.49. The spread of jEAMb
x j around its peak has a normalized half width at half maximum along the
b
x direction HWHMb
x = 0:46 and a normalized half width at half maximum along the b

y = 0:46. The spread of

HWHMb
x = 0:51 and HWHMb
y = 0:95.
(F) Same as (E) but when currents were applied without electrical isolation between the current sources. The peak of the envelope modulation amplitude was
located along the midline of the trapezoid at its small base as in (E) however the distribution of the envelope modulation amplitude was significantly more
dispersed. The amplitude of jEAMb
x j at the end of the b
x direction dashed line (normalized distance of 0.51 from center) was 0.76 of its maximal value. The spread of
jEAMb
x j around its maximal value had a normalized HWHMb
x = 0:95. The amplitude of
