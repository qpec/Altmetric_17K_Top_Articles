BACKGROUND: The MOMENTUM 3 trial compares the centrifugal HeartMate 
3 (HM3) with the axial HeartMate II (HMII) continuous-flow left ventricular assist 
system in patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of the intended 
goal of therapy. The trial’s 2-year clinical outcome (n=366) demonstrated 
superiority of the HM3 for the primary end point (survival free of a disabling 
stroke or reoperation to replace or remove a malfunctioning pump). This analysis 
evaluates health resource use and cost implications of the observed differences 
between the 2 devices while patients were enrolled in the trial.
METHODS: We analyzed all hospitalizations and their associated costs 
occurring after discharge from the implant hospitalization until censoring (study 
withdrawal, heart transplantation, and pump exchange with a nonstudy device 
or death). Each adjudicated episode of hospital-based care was used to calculate 
costs (device-attributable and non–device-attributable event costs), estimated by 
using trial data and payer administrative claims databases. Cost savings stratified 
by subgroups (study outcome [transplant, death, or ongoing on device], 
intended goal of therapy, type of insurance, or sex) were also assessed.
RESULTS: In 366 randomly assigned patients, 361 comprised the as-treated 
group (189 in the HM3 group and 172 in the HMII group), of whom 337 
(177 in the HM3 group and 160 in the HMII group) were successfully 
discharged following implantation. The HM3 arm experienced fewer total 
hospitalizations per patient-year (HM3: 2.1±0.2 versus HMII: 2.7±0.2; 
P=0.015) and 8.3 fewer hospital days per patient-year on average (HM3: 
17.1 days versus HMII: 25.5 days; P=0.003). These differences were driven 
by patients hospitalized for suspected pump thrombosis (HM3: 0.6% 
versus HMII: 12.5%; P<0.001) and stroke (HM3: 2.8% versus HMII: 11.3%; 
P=0.002). Controlled for time spent in the study (average cumulative cost 
per patient-year), postdischarge HM3 arm costs were 51% lower than with 
the HMII (HM3: $37 
685±4251 versus HMII: $76 
599±11 
889, P<0.001) and 
similar in either bridge to transplant or destination therapy intent.
CONCLUSIONS: In this 2-year outcome economic analysis of the 
MOMENTUM 3 trial, the HM3 demonstrated a reduction in rehospitalizations, 
hospital days spent during rehospitalizations, and a significant cost savings 
following discharge in comparison with the HMII left ventricular assist system, 
irrespective of the intended goal of therapy.

L
eft ventricular assist systems (LVASs) are increas-
ingly adopted in the management of patients with 
advanced heart failure, but scaling their use across 
broader populations and geographic regions has been 
limited by 2 distinct factors.1 First, although continu-
ous-flow LVASs have now become commonly used in 
situations of bridge to transplantation, and destination 
therapy, wider dissemination is often curtailed by clini-
cal concerns related to the aggregate burden of hemo-
compatibility-related adverse events such as strokes, 
bleeding, infection, and pump thrombosis, a dreaded 
complication that often requires pump exchange.2,3 Sec-
ond, not only is the initial decision to implant a pump 
associated with considerable cost to the healthcare sys-
tem, but the subsequent postimplant management of 
adverse events and the antecedent need for aggressive 
and frequent hospital-based care adds a prominent layer 
of economic concern that serves to decrease the net 
cost-effectiveness of this otherwise valuable therapy.4–8
The HeartMate 3 (HM3), a fully magnetically levi-
tated LVAS, has demonstrated its clinical superiority 
in comparison with the axial flow HeartMate II (HMII) 
pump in the short term (at 6 months), and in the long 
term (at 2 years), in the pivotal MOMENTUM 3 trial.9,10 
This study, a randomized comparative effectiveness in-
vestigation of these 2 pumps, reported that the HM3 
LVAS was superior in meeting its primary end point of 
survival free of a disabling stroke or the need for reop-
eration to replace or remove a malfunctioning device 
(hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.31–0.69 
[P<0.001 for superiority]).10 These benefits were driven 
by the absence of need for pump exchanges because of 
pump thrombosis and, importantly, a halving of overall 
stroke rates with the HM3 pump (hazard ratio, 0.47; 
95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.84; P=0.02), suggest-
ing greater hemocompatibility between the patient and 
the device interface with this LVAS. Whether these clini-
cal findings also translate into benefits in the domain of 
medical resource use (principally adverse event–driven 
hospitalizations) and cost of care remains unknown.
The purpose of this resource use analysis is sever-
al-fold: (1) primarily, to compare and contrast rehos-
pitalizations for device-attributable events (DAEs) and 
those unrelated events (non-DAE) between the HM3 
and HMII LVASs, following the index implant hospi-
talization; (2) to assess the aggregate costs (based on 
payer reimbursements, either public or private insurer) 
of rehospitalizations encountered between the 2 device 
arms; and (3) to determine the relative cost differences 
between the HM3 and HMII LVAS subgroups, includ-
ing study outcome (transplant, death, or ongoing on 
device), type of insurance (public or private payer), sex, 
or intended goal of therapy (bridge to transplantation 
or destination therapy).
METHODS
MOMENTUM 3 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, non-
blinded, pivotal clinical trial comparing the HM3 to the HMII 
LVAS in patients who have advanced-stage heart failure, and its 
design has been previously described in detail.11 Eligible patients 
for the long-term component of the trial were randomly 
assigned 1:1 to receive either the HM3 or the HMII LVAS irre-
spective of whether the treatment goal was bridge to transplant 
or destination therapy (DT). The primary end point of the trial 
as assessed at 2 years was survival free of disabling stroke and 
reoperation to remove or replace a malfunctioning device. The 
trial includes an adaptive design with 3 prespecified analyses: 
the short-term primary end point assessment in 294 patients 
at 6 months; a long-term primary end point assessment in 366 
patients at 2 years; and a full cohort analysis of the end point in 
1028 randomly assigned patients, again at 2 years. The first 2 
analyses have been reported, and the final analysis is expected 
to be reported in 2019.9,10 The trial also prespecified the collec-
tion of health resource use data by use of hospital billing infor-
mation provided prospectively by centers. All patients (or their 
authorized representatives) provided written informed con-
sent, and each institutional ethics review board approved the 
trial conduct. Predefined adverse events, readmissions to the 
hospital, device malfunctions, and reoperations were reported 
and adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee 
blinded to the randomization sequence. An independent data 
safety and monitoring board was responsible for the clinical 
safety data. The data, analytic methods, and study materials 
will not be made available to other researchers for purposes 
of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure and are 
within the independent purview of the publications and presen-
tations committee of the trial.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This 2-year analysis of the long-term MOMENTUM 
3 trial compares the HeartMate 3 with the Heart-
Mate II pump and demonstrates that the HeartMate 
3 pump is associated with a significant reduction in 
rehospitalization and hospital days used.
• Overall costs following discharge were 51% lower 
with the HeartMate 3 than with HeartMate II 
pump, driven largely by a decrease in device-attrib-
utable events.
• Lower costs with HeartMate 3 were seen irrespec-
tive of intended goal of therapy (bridge to trans-
plant or destination therapy).
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The clinical superiority of the HeartMate 3 cardiac 
pump is associated with a lower cost of rehospital-
izations at 2 years of follow-up after implantation.
• These findings in advanced heart failure suggest 
enhanced cost-effectiveness of left ventricular 
assist systems and may allow for more widespread 
use across different healthcare systems and geo-
graphic regions.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
On April 6, 2018, the sponsor, Abbott, issued a Field Safety 
Notice, which was updated on May 21, 2018, regarding the 
HM3 Left Ventricular Assist System and reports of outflow 
graft twist complications occurring with an incidence rate of 
0.72%. Outflow graft twist is a known complication after HM3 
placement, and was previously reported in the pivotal trial.10 
The Food and Drug Administration terminology for a Field 
Safety Corrective Action is Recall, which was issued as a Class 
I Recall (reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure 
to a product can cause serious adverse health consequences 
or death). The Food and Drug Administration did not recom-
mend the return of products or avoidance of using the prod-
uct with new patients. The analyses presented in this article 
reflect attribution of twist events occurring during follow-up 
in the HM3 arm. We re-reviewed 20 hospitalizations (5 in the 
HM3 arm and 15 in the HMII arm) as possible device-related 
malfunction (eg, low-flow alarms, peripheral controller com-
ponent malfunction) and in a conservative analysis classified 
them as being device-related for the purpose of this analysis.
Economic Resource Analyses
The specific methodology for the economic medical resource 
use and cost analysis is described below.
Hospitalization Resource Use Methodology
Healthcare utilization data were collected concurrently during 
the trial. The Universal Billing form UB-04 (form CMS 1450) 
was collected specifically for inpatient hospitalizations that 
occurred in the study patients. This is a standard form used 
by institutions in the United States to bill insurance providers 
for medical services provided to the patients. The UB-04 form 
fields include admission date, discharge date, type of admis-
sion, type of insurance, admitting diagnosis code, all diagno-
ses codes, and all procedure codes.
Cohort and Event Derivation 
There are important differences between the resource use 
and cost analysis and the original clinical analysis of the trial 
cohort. The primary cost analysis mainly considers nonindex 
rehospitalizations. This was specified by design because all 
index hospitalizations cover the same procedure (implanta-
tion of a LVAS), and the costs of devices used were identical 
within the trial. Therefore, other than outlier costs (unex-
pected adverse events), we expect little variation (addressed 
in secondary cost analyses in Results). Of the 366 randomly 
assigned patients, 361 received the intended implant device 
(5 were randomly assigned and did not undergo implan-
tation), and 12 patients in each arm were not discharged 
because of death or study censoring (CONSORT diagram, 
Figure 1). Furthermore, unlike the primary end point clinical 
analysis that did not report patient outcomes after reaching 
a pump exchange event, we report healthcare resource data 
for subsequent adverse events and rehospitalizations in this 
analysis. Other censoring events (ie, study withdrawal, heart 
transplantation, explant, pump exchange with a nonstudy 
device, and death) remain the same in the resource use and 
the clinical analysis. Our primary analysis, therefore, includes 
rehospitalizations after the index hospitalization and before 
the patient was censored. In addition, we conducted sec-
ondary analyses by using estimates of index hospitalization 
costs and compensated for censoring by applying average 
event costs (for heart transplant and death) derived from the 
literature.7 We also conducted subgroup analyses of within-
trial costs for subjects who died during the trial, subjects 
who received a transplant, and subjects who remained on 
HeartMate support at 2 years of follow-up.
Cost Estimates of Hospitalizations 
Costs in this study were assessed from the payer perspective 
and are equivalent to the reimbursement hospitals receive for 
each related event (in US dollars adjusted to 2017 figures). 
Each hospitalization was associated with a clinical adjudica-
tion (determined by the clinical study adjudication committee) 
and a specific reimbursement, estimated by using a combina-
tion of trial data and payer administrative claims databases. 
Because of variation in study site institutional review board 
rules and compliance, only a subset of hospitalizations had 
codes available to allow for diagnosis related group (DRG) 
grouping. For hospitalizations where UB-04 forms contain-
ing admission and procedure codes were available, the hos-
pitalizations were assigned to an appropriate DRG using the 
MS-DRG Grouper, Calculator & Analyzer software available on 
the MediRegs platform from Wolters Kluwer.12 The DRG code 
was then used to identify average reimbursement related to 
the DRGs within administrative claims. Specifically, the aver-
age costs for Medicare insurance claims were calculated from 
the Medicare Limited Data Set that contained deidentified 
Medicare claims for the first 9 months of 2017,13 and average 
costs for private commercial insurers were calculated from 
the Marketscan Commercial Claims database (which con-
tains a nationally representative sample of commercial insur-
ance payments for 2016, converted to 2017 dollars using the 
Medical Consumer Price Index).14,15
Ascertainment of Insurance Plan 
The insurance plan attributable to each patient was deter-
mined using the Primary Payer field in the UB-04 forms where 
available, and, where not available, the insurance type was 
assigned based on the age of the patient: age ≥65 years 
assigned to Medicare insurance, and age <65 years assigned 
to private insurance. Making the distinction between patients 
who were insured by the public payer (Medicare) and those 
who were insured commercially was important in this anal-
ysis, because reimbursement from commercial insurance 
is often much higher than Medicare (usually by a factor of 
2-fold higher for the private payer).
Assessment of Reimbursement for 
Hospitalizations 
For those hospitalizations that could not be assigned to a 
DRG, costs were determined by the use of regression mod-
eling. We developed regression models to predict hospi-
talization cost as a function of patient and hospitalization 
characteristics. The average reimbursement for the assigned 
DRG was regressed on actual adverse events related to the 
hospitalization (ie, pump replacement, arterial non–central 
nervous system thromboembolism, cardiac arrhythmia, 
hemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, major bleeding, major infec-
tion, neurological dysfunction, pericardial fluid, psychologi-
cal episode, renal dysfunction, respiratory failure, right heart 
failure, venous thromboembolism, and myocardial infarction), 
the number of days in intensive care, the length of stay, and 
the patient’s age.

Four different functional forms of the regression were con-
sidered (Gaussian, Gamma, Gaussian with a log link/transfor-
mation of cost, and Gamma with a log link/transformation 
of cost) and 2 variable selection approaches (backward step-
wise regression with P<0.20 and least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator [LASSO]) were used to develop 6 candidate 
models. The Gamma family is desirable because it is defined 
over a nonnegative support (predicted costs will always be 
nonnegative) and is right-skewed, which is a good fit for medi-
cal cost data where a few values can represent high outliers. 
The Gaussian family is desirable because parameters are easy 
to interpret; however, because support is over the real number 
line, predicted costs could theoretically be negative. A log trans-
formation on the cost data may lessen the impact of heteroge-
neity on the model (ie, if variance is increasing with cost, a log 
transformation will smooth out the variance in the regression).
To choose an appropriate model, all models were estimated 
by using the available observations. For each model specifica-
tion, independent variables were selected using backward step-
wise regression with a cutoff threshold of P≤0.20 (P values were 
based on the analytically derived P values, not bootstrap P val-
ues). In addition, a LASSO regression approach was applied to 
the Gaussian families. Separate regressions were estimated for 
each model specification, using both the Medicare average reim-
bursement by UB-04 form–assigned DRG and the Marketscan 
Commercial average reimbursement by DRG. A generalized lin-
ear model (GLM) regression was used for models selected with 
backward regression, and an ordinary least-squares approach 
was used for models selected with LASSO. Results are shown in 
Tables I and II in the online-only Data Supplement.
Goodness of fit was assessed graphically, with deviance, and 
with residual mean square error. Histograms of deviance residu-
als for the different models were constructed (Figures I through 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement). For a correctly specified 
model, the histogram should be approximately normally distrib-
uted.16 This plot suggests that the Gaussian model without the 
log link is not a good fit for our data given the large dispersion 
of the residuals (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Although deviance is an established method of assessing 
model fit, deviance is not generally comparable between fam-
ilies. Nevertheless, it can be useful in deciding if the log trans-
formation within a family produces a better fit. In the Gamma 
and Gaussian models selected with backward selection, devi-
ance was lower for estimation with the log link function than 
with the identity link. In contrast, the LASSO had greater devi-
ance using the log transformation than using untransformed 
data. The Gaussian models estimated with backward step-
wise regression had lower deviance than the LASSO models.
A lower root mean square error is 1 measure of a bet-
ter model fit. Root mean square error was lowest in the 
Gaussian GLM estimation with log link (6980) and highest 
in the Gamma GLM regression with log link (11 
827). In the 
Gaussian GLM regressions, root mean square error is lower 
with the log link function than with the identity link, whereas 
the opposite is true in the Gamma GLM regressions.
No regression model was clearly dominant in the good-
ness-of-fit assessments. Given the nature of the cost data 
(right-skewed, strictly positive), Gamma regression was cho-
sen. Among the Gamma regressions, the log-linked regres-
sions have lower deviance, but higher root mean square error. 
Because of the highly skewed nature of the cost data, we 
selected the Gamma regression model with a log link as our 
baseline model. The sensitivity of this assumption is assessed 
in Table III in the online-only Data Supplement.
Once the regressions were estimated (using hospitaliza-
tions that could be assigned to DRG codes), the regression

equations were used to predict costs for hospitalizations that 
could not be assigned to a DRG. These costs were predicted 
based on the same parameters used in the regression estima-
tion (ie, adverse events related to the hospitalization, number 
of days in intensive care, length of hospital stay, and patient 
age). Details on model parameterization, estimation, and 
diagnostics can be found in the online-only Data Supplement 
Statistical Appendix (Tables I through III and Figures I through 
IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We compared patient characteristics by treatment arm to verify 
that our arms remained balanced after excluding patients who 
left the study before index admission discharge. Patients were 
compared on demographic factors and clinical characteristics. 
Categorical variables were compared between the 2 treatment 
groups with the use of the Fisher exact test or χ2 test, and con-
tinuous variables were compared with the unpaired t test or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test as appropriate. Two-sided P values of 
<0.05 are considered to indicate statistical significance.
Medical resource use was quantified for all inpatient 
hospitalizations that occurred in each group over the study 
period. Hospitalizations were categorized based on the pri-
mary reason for readmission. Those occurring because of an 
adverse event adjudicated as suspected device thrombosis, 
stroke, driveline infection or sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, 
right heart failure, or a suspected device malfunction were 
defined as a DAE. We report the number of each rehospital-
ization type by treatment group and conduct the Pearson χ2 
test to determine if the proportions of hospitalization type 
are similar between groups. We also report mean cost per 
hospitalization by hospitalization type and treatment group. 
To estimate total hospitalization costs, hospital costs over 2 
years were summed for each subject. Hospital admissions and 
total days in the hospital were also summed for each subject. 
To adjust for censoring, we primarily compared the cost per 
patient-year (subjects’ total cumulative cost divided by their 
follow-up time in the study), the hospital days per patient-
year (subjects’ total hospital days divided by their follow-up 
time in the study), and total admissions per study year (sub-
jects’ total number of admissions divided by their follow-up 
time in the study) between treatment arms. Average costs are 
primarily shown with standard error. Median cost values with 
90% confidence intervals are also provided in the supplement 
(Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
Because of the complexity associated with imputing cost 
data, standard statistical tests would be inappropriate to con-
firm statistical significance in cost between groups. Because 
HM3 was demonstrated to be superior with regard to the 
trial’s long-term primary end point and adverse event rates 
were lower or similar in comparison with HMII, 1-tailed tests 
were used to determine if HM3 medical resource use was sig-
nificantly lower than HMII medical resource use. One-tailed P 
values were estimated using nonparametric bootstrapping for 
comparisons within the primary group of discharged patients 
and patient subgroups. The bootstrap was conducted 1500 
times to ensure consistent results, which is greater than the 
recommended minimum of 1000 replications.17
We also conducted a variety of statistical tests to assess 
the sensitivity of our primary results to differing modeling 
approaches. We assessed how primary results varied for each 
of the 6 candidate models. To ensure that results were not 
driven by imbalance in insurance type between groups, we 
reran the analysis using Medicare reimbursement (and then 
commercial reimbursement) for all subjects. The analysis was 
also redone using only rehospitalizations that could be coded 
to a specific DRG. All analyses were conducted using STATA 
13.1 (StataCorp LLC) or SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute).

lowing the initial implant hospitalization, included 337 
patients (177 in the HM3 group and 160 in the HMII 
group) (CONSORT, Figure 1). A comparison of baseline 
patient characteristics showed no significant differenc-
es in demographic and clinical factors between the 2 
study groups (Table 1).
Medical Resource Use
There were 537 total hospitalizations in the HM3 group 
and 501 hospitalizations in the HMII group. χ2 Tests 
comparing the proportion of different hospitalization 
types (DAE and non-DAE) show fewer hospitalizations 
attributable to device-attributable adverse events in 
the HM3 group (P<0.001) (Table 2). HM3 DAE rehos-
pitalizations were significantly less expensive than HMII 
DAE hospitalizations (HM3: $21 
780; HMII: $46 
547; 
P<0.001) (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the distribution of 
adverse events leading to a DAE readmission. In the 
HMII arm, a higher percentage of patients was hospi-
talized for pump thrombosis (HM3: 0.6% versus HMII: 
12.5%; P<0.001) and stroke (HM3: 2.8% versus HMII: 
11.3%; P=0.002). With respect to non-DAE hospital-
izations, a comparison of cost per rehospitalization for 
each hospitalization type demonstrated no significant 
difference between the HM3 and HMII groups.
Primary Cost Analysis
The average cumulative cost per patient-year in those

The treatment effect using conditional hospitaliza-
tion (expected total cost of a patient at a given time, 
conditional on that patient still being in the trial) over 
time is captured in Figure 3, which shows the cumula-
tive cost at each point in time divided by the number of 
patients still enrolled in the trial.
Secondary Cost Analyses
In a secondary cost analysis, the entire patient popula-
tion was considered insured through Medicare or pri-
vate insurance (Table 4). All costs were higher when 
patients were modeled as having private insurance, 
and there was a significant cost savings of $81 568 
per patient-year with HM3. The cost savings were 
smaller in magnitude but still significant ($30 648 
per patient-year) if all patients were insured through 
Medicare.
The cost savings stratified by different subgroups 
(study outcome, intended goal of therapy, type of in-
surance, or sex) were also assessed (Figure 4). For pa-
tients who died, there was a significant cost savings of 
$59 
341 (P=0.021) and a similar trend in patients receiv-
ing a heart transplantation. In both DT and bridge to 
transplant subgroups, the average cumulative cost per 
patient-year is significantly less for HM3, with an aver-
age savings of $39 
773 in patients assigned DT (P<0.001) 
and $38 
989 for patients assigned bridge to transplant 
(P=0.020). The conditional costs over 2 years are shown 
for DT and bridge to transplant patients in Figure 5.
To ensure that the exclusion of potential costs ac-
crued during the index hospitalization, heart transplan-

tation, or death would not cause directional bias in the 
overall cost assessment, we performed another second-
ary analysis of all patients in the long-term cohort. This 
analysis included index hospitalization costs and esti-
mated costs for heart transplant and death with previ-
ously published data (Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement).7 With the inclusion of these additional 
costs, the average cumulative cost savings over the 
study period with HM3 was $65 
602 (HM3: $473 
774 
versus HMII: $539 
376; P=0.009).
Sensitivity Analyses for Cost Differences
We conducted a sensitivity analysis using only those 
hospitalizations that had allocated DRG codes avail-
able. Even with this limited analysis using only 31% 
of the hospitalizations, the average cost per study year 
is $9713 less for HM3 than for the HMII LVAS group 
(P=0.045). Other outcomes are similarly smaller in 
magnitude but consistent with the full analysis using 
imputed costs (reflecting the false-negative rate at-
tributable to a considerably smaller sample size in the 
sensitivity analysis).
DISCUSSION
The findings of this investigation demonstrate that the 
long-term (2-year) clinical superiority demonstrated by 
the HM3 fully magnetically levitated centrifugal flow 
pump is also associated with fewer rehospitalizations 
and days spent in the hospital for clinically significant 
adverse events (predominantly because of DAEs includ-
ing suspected pump thrombosis and stroke-related 
hospitalizations) following discharge from the index 
implant–related hospitalization. It is important to note 
that the total costs to payers (either public or private)

are significantly lower over the period of follow-up in 
those receiving the HM3 LVAS than in those undergo-
ing implantation with the HMII pump.
Healthcare transformation, driven by the rising costs 
of medical care, has necessitated a focus on cost-ef-
fectiveness encircling any technological advance with 
established clinical effectiveness. Historically, the early-
generation pulsatile durable LVASs were deemed to not 
be cost-effective because they did not provide sufficient 
prolongation in quality-adjusted life-years.18 Initially, 
costs were prohibitive based on economic metrics, 
but as management in the postimplant period began 
to improve and clinical outcomes were enhanced, the 
cost-effectiveness was enriched, yet not to thresholds 
accepted as viable within a society for unfettered ac-
cess to such therapy.19 The advent of miniaturized and 
more durable continuous-flow centrifugal or axial flow 
pumps heralded a new era in clinical effectiveness of 
durable LVASs, and as greater use and acceptance 
prompted application in large numbers, economic im-
plications have become paramount. Analyses of ad-
vanced heart failure populations targeted as candidates 
for heart transplantation, and thereby use of LVASs as 
a bridge, have found affirmation in several countries 
that have deemed such a use to fall within acceptable 
cost-effectiveness ratios; however, use of this technol-
ogy in transplant-ineligible patients (those considered 
as DT) has not received widespread endorsement.20,21 
Using a Markov model in the context of a contempo-
rary continuous-flow LVAS use, Rogers and colleagues4 
demonstrated that, in comparison with medically man-
aged patients, these devices had an incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio of $198 
184 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained. It is important to note that they deter-
mined that the results were most sensitive to the initial 
cost of device implantation and subsequent cost per 
rehospitalization. In another analysis, Baras Shreibati 
and colleagues5 examined the cost-effectiveness of left 
ventricular assist devices as DT in ambulatory patients 
with advanced heart failure. In their model, a value for 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $209 
400 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained was noted in compari-

son with medical management. It is important to note 
that this study analyzed the sensitivity based on read-
mission rates and outpatient care costs. In this analysis, 
they found that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
would drop to a threshold of $86 
900 if postimplant 
costs could be reduced by $51 
000 in tandem with a 
50% lower readmission rate than those encountered 
with current devices, such as the axial-flow HMII pump. 
This would then reach a threshold at which the eco-
nomic implications of using LVAS would become more 
palatable for wider use. Our investigation has demon-
strated that the decrease in rehospitalizations and hos-
pital days and the corresponding cost savings of 51% 
with the HM3 resulting from superior clinical effective-
ness (in comparison with the HMII pump) may help us 
reach the point at which LVAS would be expected to 
become more cost-effective by meeting societal norms 
for willingness to pay for incremental benefit (which is 
now suggested to be an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $100 
000–$150 
000 in the United States).22 In 
a secondary analysis, we included the costs attribut-
able to the index hospitalization and also assigned an 
estimated value to censored events such as transplant 
episodes and deaths. This analysis, if confirmed using 
actual cost data, when we analyze the full cohort of 
the MOMENTUM 3 trial (in 1028 patients) once avail-
able, will point to the greater cost-effectiveness of the 
HM3 LVAS.
Whether these results from the United States could 
be scalable and applicable for interpretation across geo-
graphic boundaries remains an important issue. Health-
care systems across the world have different costs, so-
cietal thresholds for determining cost-effectiveness of 
therapy, and organization of funding for provision of 
care. Healthcare funding within the United States is 
unique because it represents a multipayer system and 
is often a mixture wherein patients shuttle between the 
public and private sectors.23 In this context, the Medi-
care system, a public-funded enterprise for the elderly, 
would be similar in funding and scope to a country that 
supports a single-payer universal healthcare system 
such as the United Kingdom organized via its National 
Health Service.24 However, some countries that support 
private insurance do so through taxation at the citizen 
or employer level but may mimic, in part, the com-
mercial system in the United States. Such a healthcare 
system is prevalent in Germany, where one requires 
private insurance for high-end procedures and therapy 
(which typically supplements governmental basic fund-
ing).24 In our data, the payer type, either Medicare or 
private payers, accrued similarly significant cost savings 
with the HM3, and the degree of relative cost reduc-
tions could be immediately translatable to either model 
of healthcare funding in other regions. In essence, we 
demonstrate that our data may have scalability and ap-
plicability within the framework of other payer systems, 
predominantly driven by the improved outcomes of the 
HM3 LVAS that drive the decrease in hospitalizations 
and their subsequent cost rather than reliance on pro-
cesses of care or delivery models.
The clinical success of the HM3 LVAS, the reduction 
in adverse event profiles of stroke and need for a pump 
exchange, and the consequent decreases in readmission 
rates will lead to enhanced cost-effectiveness of such 
therapy. Yet, further progress is needed in enhancing 
the usefulness and application of the current generation 
of LVASs. In this regard, the clinical findings of a virtual 
absence of pump thrombosis–related complications has 
opened the door to consideration of reduced anticoagu-
lation strategies or even consideration for elimination of 
such therapy. A pilot trial has shown the safety of low-
intensity anticoagulation use with the HM3 pump in the 
short term at least to 6 months postimplantation.25,26 
Although these early findings require confirmation in 
the context of larger-scale randomized trials, this impor-
tant step ushers in the possibility that, if demonstrated 
to be safe, bleeding-related complications could be 
decreased, such as gastrointestinal bleeds, and hemor-
rhagic strokes, as well. If this is proven, the technology 
will become even more cost-effective in the future. One 
area that remains challenging relates to the presence 
of exit-site drive-line infections attributable to the need 
to externally power the LVAS. A fully internalized drive-
line and elimination of infection carries the promise of a 
greater quality of life for the patient and a further reduc-
tion in overall costs of care.27
Limitations
The primary study analysis does not include the index 
hospitalization costs because they were deemed to be 
similar between the devices; however, they do not ac-
count for the outlier costs. In our secondary analysis 
where we included costs accrued during the index hospi-
talization, and censored events such as heart transplant 
or death, as well, the difference in cost was only further 
magnified in favor of the HM3, driven again by the early 
need for device exchange and stroke rates in the HMII 
group. There were proportionally similar numbers of pa-
tients leading to the inability to discharge (6.3% in the 
HM3 group versus 7.0% in the HMII group) and numeri-
cally more patients discharged in the HM3 group that 
would have allowed for a greater number of patients 
available to add cost to this group. Yet, the reduced 
rate of adverse events noted with the HM3 contributed 
significant cost savings despite this apparent disadvan-
tage. Similarly, outpatient costs occurring over the study 
period, although not believed to be comparatively sig-
nificant (dressing changes, battery exchanges, routine 
visits for device interrogation, and diagnostic testing), 
were not captured in this analysis. It is important to un-
derscore that the largest share of overall costs, regard-

less of technology, is related to the index hospitalization 
(acquisition cost of the device), but the greatest magni-
tude of difference in costs accrues from the postimplant 
follow-up phase. One other limitation is that costs were 
assessed using a hybrid model (the actual DRG codes 
in those available [31% of all hospitalizations] and in 
others a regression model based on the actual events 
related to hospitalization). We emphasize that the cost 
regression modeling took into account the actual costs 
incurred by various adverse effects, adjusted for patient 
demographics, and demonstrated a high precision and 
fidelity on testing. The analyses that include heart trans-
plants and deaths used estimated, not actual costs, and 
must be considered in this context as more general find-
ings. In principle, because rates of heart transplantation 
and deaths were numerically greater in the HMII arm, 
this would have only magnified the cost differences not-
ed between the devices.
CONCLUSIONS
In this medical resource use (hospitalization-based) and 
corresponding cost analysis of the outcomes in the MO-
MENTUM 3 trial at 2 years, the HM3 demonstrated a re-
duction in rehospitalization-related hospital days and a 
significant cost savings in comparison with the HMII LVAS. 
These cost savings with the HM3 were independent of 
payer type, whether public or private insurance, and are 
also seen across different subgroups, including those in-
tended for bridge to transplantation or destination ther-
apy. These important findings suggest that the clinical 
benefits of the HM3 pump decrease the cost of care while 
growing the health utility over time, allowing for a relative 
cost-utility benefit for this therapeutic modality.
