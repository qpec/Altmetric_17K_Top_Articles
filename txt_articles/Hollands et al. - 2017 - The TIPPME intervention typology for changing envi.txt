The TIPPME intervention typology for changing environments to change behaviour  
34 
 
35 
ABSTRACT 
36 
 
37 
Reflecting widespread interest in concepts of ‘nudging’ and ‘choice architecture’, there is 
38 
increasing research and policy attention on altering aspects of the small-scale physical environment, 
39 
such as portion sizes or product positioning, to change health-related behaviour at population-level. 
40 
There is, however, a lack of clarity in characterising these interventions, and no reliable framework 
41 
incorporating standardised definitions. This hampers both the synthesis of cumulative evidence 
42 
about intervention effects, and the identification of intervention opportunities. To address this, a 
43 
new tool, TIPPME (Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro-Environments) has been 
44 
developed, here applied to the selection, purchase and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco. 
45 
This provides a framework to reliably classify and describe, and enable more systematic design, 
46 
reporting and analysis of, an important class of interventions. In doing so, it makes a distinct 
47 
contribution to collective efforts to build the cumulative evidence-base for effective ways of 
48 
changing behaviour across populations.

Unhealthy patterns of food, alcohol and tobacco consumption are major contributors to the burden 
59 
of non-communicable diseases – currently accounting for more than two thirds of deaths 
60 
worldwide1,2. It is now widely recognised that the physical environments that surround us exert 
61 
considerable influence on these patterns of consumption, and that changing these environments 
62 
holds corollary potential as a catalyst for changing consumption. Whilst not new, the idea that 
63 
behaviour can be changed in predictable ways, by changing the environments within which people 
64 
make choices – ‘choice architecture’3 - has gained traction globally among the public, the research 
65 
community, and policymakers4,5. However, despite the recent popularisation and intuitive appeal of 
66 
these approaches, there has been an absence of definitional and conceptual clarity in characterising 
67 
such interventions, particularly regarding applications to public health. The absence of a reliable 
68 
framework that incorporates standardised labels and definitions has hampered the synthesis of 
69 
cumulative evidence about intervention effects, resulting in an evidence-base that remains uneven 
70 
and uncertain. It has also hindered the identification and discussion of opportunities to intervene to 
71 
change environments. 
72 
 
73 
In response to these observations, we present and provide guidance for a new tool – TIPPME 
74 
(Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro-Environments) - that aims to improve 
75 
researchers’ and practitioners’ ability to clearly and consistently classify and describe an important 
76 
class of behaviour change interventions related to concepts of ‘nudging’ and ‘choice architecture’. 
77 
The focus of the typology is on interventions that involve altering aspects of physical micro-
78 
environments to change health-related behaviour, here specifically applied to the selection, 
79 
purchase and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco products. A more detailed discussion of 
80 
definitions and concepts follows below, but in essence, these interventions involve changing 
81 
characteristics of products themselves and the environment in which they are available, within 
82 
places such as shops, restaurants, bars, and workplaces. Examples include altering the portion size 
83 
of food, alcohol and tobacco products, and changing their availability or positioning within an 
84 
       4 
 
environment, such as providing additional healthier options to select from or placing less healthy 
85 
options further away from potential consumers.  
86 
 
87 
Aims of TIPPME  
88 
 
89 
To provide a framework for reliably classifying and describing ways in which interventions can 
90 
alter proximal physical micro-environments to change selection, purchase and consumption of food, 
91 
alcohol and tobacco products, in order to:   
92 
i) 
Facilitate the synthesis of cumulative evidence about the effects of interventions that can 
93 
be mapped on to the areas of influence or responsibility of different potential actors (e.g. 
94 
industry, policy makers, public), including supporting clearer reporting of intervention 
95 
content in primary and secondary research; and,  
96 
ii) 
Facilitate identification and discussion of a broader range of opportunities for 
97 
interventions to be developed, implemented and evaluated. This is potentially useful for 
98 
researchers and those in positions to directly alter, or advocate for changes to, 
99 
commercial, public sector or domestic environments. 
100 
 
101 
Focus of TIPPME 
102 
 
103 
We define the focus of this typology as: 
104 
Interventions or ways to alter the properties or the placement of objects or stimuli within proximal 
105 
(sensorily perceptible) physical micro-environments, to elicit particular behaviours among people 
106 
within those environments. These interventions are implemented within the same environment as 
107 
that in which the target behaviour is performed, and are not designed to be interactive or tailored 
108 
to specific individuals. 
109 
 
110 
       5 
 
Our choice of terminology regarding ‘proximal physical micro-environments’ is intended to reflect 
111 
the spatial focus of this class of interventions relative to the people exposed to them. It draws upon 
112 
a conceptual distinction made within the ANGELO (Analysis Grid for Environments Linked to 
113 
Obesity) framework6 between two levels of environment, micro- and macro-. Micro-environments 
114 
are settings which people use for specific purposes (e.g. shops, restaurants and bars) and where they 
115 
interact directly with objects and stimuli within those environments. In contrast, macro-
116 
environments are the higher-level systems and infrastructure that influence the characteristics of 
117 
micro-environments and the relationship between them (e.g. the availability of micro-environments 
118 
themselves, such as the geographical distribution of shops, restaurants and bars in a given area).  
119 
 
120 
ANGELO additionally distinguishes between four types of environment: physical, economic, 
121 
political and socio-cultural. As we are concerned with the consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco 
122 
products that are themselves objects within it, the stated focus of TIPPME is on the physical micro-
123 
environment. We have not attempted concurrently to map economic, political and socio-cultural 
124 
environments, though we acknowledge their importance and the complex interactive relationships 
125 
between them, and between interventions and outcomes. For example, these other environments 
126 
may be manifest in any changes made to physical environments (e.g. political environments may 
127 
influence physical environments) or changes made to physical environments may impact upon them 
128 
(e.g. providing information may influence social norms). As well as directly influencing the nature 
129 
of physical environments, economic, political and socio-cultural environments also determine the 
130 
background conditions in which people are exposed to physical environments, such as times when 
131 
the physical environments can be accessed, and the economic costs that are imposed upon them. 
132 
Applying a sociological lens, social structures constrain and enable the actions of individual human 
133 
agents and set the limits of behavioural possibilities. Humans operate in an environment which is 
134 
simultaneously social, biological, and physical7. Here our focus is on the physical, while 
135 
acknowledging this wider set of parameters.  
136 
       6 
 
Because physical micro-environments can be very large and encompass a wide range of functions 
137 
and purposes for the people in them (for example, neighbourhoods or streets), this term is not 
138 
specific enough to capture the focus of the interventions we aim to characterise. The addition of 
139 
‘proximal’ reflects our conceptual focus, as these interventions are typically implemented close 
140 
(spatially and temporally) to the point of decision or performance of the people exposed to them, in 
141 
order to influence behaviour enacted in that same physical environment. We have bounded the 
142 
parameters of the physical environments characterised by our typology to those that are sensorily 
143 
perceptible (i.e. able to be seen, heard, smelt, touched, or tasted) by intervention recipients. In 
144 
combination with the other elements of our definition, this is intended to give an approximate 
145 
indication of the likely scale of the interventions of interest, given that precisely and accurately 
146 
quantifying the range of distances is not practicable. Finally, the focus of this typology excludes 
147 
interventions that are designed to be interactive or tailored, meaning those in which the intervention 
148 
content is not standardised for all recipients and is intended or enabled to vary dependent on their 
149 
characteristics or responses. This may result from an interaction with a person or machine, such as a 
150 
cafeteria worker or a computer-based system providing personalised nutritional guidance based on 
151 
food purchasing patterns, demographic characteristics or responses to questions. While 
152 
interventions included in TIPPME are not necessarily non-interactive - in so far as people could in 
153 
theory interact with them and change their content - they are not designed to elicit such interaction.  
154 
 
 
155 
The importance of interventions in proximal physical micro-environments 
156 
 
157 
Interventions in proximal physical micro-environments have significant potential to change 
158 
behaviour to improve population health8. This is reflected in current policy and research interest. 
159 
These interventions have key advantages over many other types of behaviour change interventions. 
160 
First, the nature of altering characteristics of physical environments means that these interventions 
161 
have the potential to shape the behaviour of all those exposed to that environment without the need 
162 
       7 
 
for interpersonal interaction. This means that once an intervention has been developed and 
163 
implemented, there are likely minimal ongoing resource costs associated with its continued use. 
164 
Second, because physical environments have the potential to be modified in a consistent and 
165 
directly measurable way, an intervention can be readily and reliably transferred to other locations, 
166 
and scaled up in its application to reach larger populations. Third, because these interventions 
167 
typically involve altering cues located proximally in time and space to the behaviour, their effects 
168 
are likely less reliant on people purposefully, consciously engaging with the intervention over time9, 
169 
or on high levels of personal agency10. This means that they may be less affected by differential, 
170 
often socially patterned, cognitive or motivational resources. They therefore, in theory, have the 
171 
potential to be effective across the populations to which they are applied, without widening existing 
172 
health inequalities. Such potential is reflected in evidence suggesting that interventions that alter the 
173 
environments to which people are exposed may be less likely to widen inequalities than individual-
174 
level education and counselling11. Finally, there is emerging evidence that this kind of public health 
175 
intervention is more acceptable to the public than economic interventions such as taxes on 
176 
products12,13, public acceptability being a key determinant of whether an intervention is 
177 
implemented14. 
178 
 
179 
Previous attempts to characterise the proximal physical micro-environment 
180 
  
181 
In addition to the ANGELO framework6, there have been several complementary research efforts 
182 
that make reference to small-scale physical environments. The Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) 
183 
Taxonomy15 aims at comprehensively describing behaviour change techniques, including 
184 
‘restructuring the physical environment’, although it does not further classify interventions within 
185 
this category. The Intervention Mapping approach16 describes a series of steps for developing 
186 
interventions, and includes ‘nudging’ as one possible approach to changing determinants underlying 
187 
behaviour, but does not disassemble this concept in terms of specific intervention content. Other 
188 
       8 
 
work has focused on classifying characteristics of ‘nudging’ or ‘choice architecture’ interventions 
189 
(e.g.17,18), but these typically concern broad theoretical principles and do not describe ways of 
190 
changing physical environments in any detail. Previous attempts to map features of the physical 
191 
environment that cue our behaviour or ways in which it can be changed19-22 are unable to address 
192 
our aims adequately, as they are insufficiently detailed, not systematically developed and assessed, 
193 
or are not applied to consumptive health-related behaviours.  
194 
 
195 
In an earlier phase of this research, we developed a provisional typology that focused specifically 
196 
on the ways in which small-scale physical environments have been altered to influence food, 
197 
alcohol, tobacco and physical activity behaviours23,24. This was derived from a large-scale 
198 
systematic scoping review of the research literature on ‘choice architecture’ interventions, intended 
199 
to map the parameters of previous empirical research and provide a conceptual map of the evidence 
200 
base, in order to delineate and characterise more specific intervention types.  In the current paper we 
201 
describe further development of this work, introducing TIPPME (Typology of Interventions in 
202 
Proximal Physical Micro-Environments), which is intended to improve upon and replace the 
203 
provisional typology. Such development was needed because the nature of the provisional typology 
204 
was determined by the extant research literature, and was therefore not designed to be applied 
205 
beyond organising that specific body of literature. Additionally, the early stages of developing 
206 
TIPPME (see Methods, Stages 1-3) identified various conceptual issues with the provisional 
207 
typology that undermined its validity and usefulness. TIPPME therefore represents an attempt to 
208 
produce a more generalisable typology with a conceptually and theoretically coherent structure that 
209 
can accommodate both interventions that have been developed and tested, and those that exist only 
210 
in theory. Using the original scoping review process as a platform, it has been shaped in accordance 
211 
with the collective understanding of experienced researchers and practitioners, with the aim of 
212 
producing as complete and parsimonious account of the phenomena of interest as possible.  
213 
 
214 
       9 
 
Whilst related to these concepts, the focus of TIPPME has been deliberately distanced from the 
215 
terminology of ‘nudging’ and ‘choice architecture’, this being potentially contentious in terms of 
216 
how it has been bound to particular political and philosophical positions, and which has been 
217 
inconsistently interpreted and applied. As Oliver (2015) highlights25, for a nudge to align with the 
218 
founding principles of libertarian paternalism3, it should fulfil a set of essential criteria (e.g. that it is 
219 
not regulatory, and does not rely on rational reasoning processes). Because interventions that are 
220 
claimed to represent nudges often do not meet these criteria, continued imprecise usage of the term 
221 
has resulted in the concept it denotes being obfuscated and confusion around its meaning and 
222 
potential policy value26. While interventions within TIPPME may map on to the concept of nudging 
223 
in some respects, this is not a necessary feature of the typology. It is therefore instead linked to the 
224 
more generalised and readily definable concept of the physical environment and the ways in which 
225 
this can be altered to change behaviour.  
226

RESULTS  
230 
 
231 
This section describes the final version of TIPPME that resulted from the seven sequential stages of 
232 
its development. Specific results from each stage of that process, including the results of reliability 
233 
testing exercises, are described in the Methods section.  
234 
 
235 
The final, complete version of TIPPME (Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro-
236 
Environments) is provided in Supplementary Information. It is also available at 
237 
http://www.bhru.iph.cam.ac.uk/resources/TIPPME (with training materials also provided at this 
238 
website) and at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5053672. This complete version includes full 
239 
definitions and guidance, a set of instructions for use, and provides examples of interventions within 
240 
       10 
 
each category in the typology. For illustration only, a simplified version of TIPPME is presented in 
241 
Figure 1. TIPPME includes and encompasses interventions that meet our stated definition of 
242 
proximal physical micro-environment interventions. In terms of the wording used and examples 
243 
provided, we have here applied it specifically to the selection, purchase and consumption of food, 
244 
alcohol and tobacco, acknowledging that it could potentially be applied and adapted to other 
245 
behaviours (see Discussion).

257 
TIPPME comprises a matrix classification structure defining six intervention types and three 
258 
different spatial foci. The rows of the typology represent different intervention types, i.e. ways in 
259 
which the proximal physical micro-environment can be altered to elicit changes in behaviour. There 
260 
are six different intervention types (rows), namely: Availability; Position; Functionality; 
261 
Presentation; Size; Information. These six intervention types can be aggregated into two higher-
262 
order classes of intervention: i) those that involve altering the placement of objects or stimuli within 
263 
proximal physical micro-environments, and ii) those that involve altering the properties of objects 
264 
or stimuli within proximal physical micro-environments, indicated by the column on the left edge of 
265 
the figure. The typology also distinguishes between three intervention foci representing differences 
266 
in the spatial focus of interventions: Product; Related objects; Wider environment. The combination 
267 
of rows and columns means there are 18 possible intervention categories that can be applied to 
268 
describe an intervention.

DISCUSSION  
272 
 
273 
The Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro-Environments, TIPPME, provides a 
274 
means of reliably classifying and describing an important class of interventions to change health-
275 
related behaviour across populations. TIPPME has benefited from an extensive, iterative and 
276 
explicit development process that included reliability testing using a sample of people involved in 
277 
researching and implementing interventions, representing those ultimately likely to use it. In line 
278 
with other conceptual frameworks, this framework will, with use, be found to be imperfect, but it 
279 
represents an agreement that a point of development has been reached where we judge the typology 
280 
can usefully fulfil its stated aims.  
281 
 
282 
First, it provides a reliable framework for the synthesis of cumulative evidence about the effects of 
283 
interventions, with the potential for a shared language. Second, it can facilitate systematic thinking 
284 
about and identification and discussion of a broader range of opportunities for interventions to be 
285 
developed, implemented and evaluated. In turn, resulting findings can be integrated with a growing 
286 
cumulative evidence base to facilitate the development of more effective interventions. In more 
287 
practical terms, this typology can feasibly be used in tasks such as classifying or organising bodies 
288 
of literature; identifying, framing and bounding primary research, as well as systematic and 
289 
conceptual reviews; and providing a way of listing possible intervention strategies. It is potentially 
290 
useful both for researchers and for framing the actions of those in positions to alter or influence 
291 
commercial, public sector or domestic environments. This could include public health practitioners 
292 
and policymakers, as well as those advocating for such changes. Finally, while the predominant 
293 
focus of TIPPME is on ways of altering environments, it may also be informative in attempts to 
294 
describe physical features of environments that (as opposed to being implemented as interventions) 
295 
already exist and may influence behaviour accordingly (or may moderate the effectiveness of 
296 
interventions that are introduced).  
297 
       12 
 
TIPPME also contributes to and complements ongoing efforts by the wider research community to 
298 
build the foundations of a cumulative evidence base by developing domain ontologies to encode 
299 
and curate research knowledge about the effects of interventions, and enable its more efficient 
300 
identification, synthesis and use. Such domain ontologies include representation of the common and 
301 
distinct features (or attributes) of different types of interventions, and of the proposed ‘active 
302 
ingredient(s)’ that determine their effectiveness27-29. This encompasses representation of the content 
303 
of interventions15 and of the mode, or form, of their delivery30. TIPPME contributes to these efforts 
304 
by specifying the common and distinct features of a specific class of interventions. In particular, it 
305 
delineates these interventions in terms of: (i) their content - this being the proposed ‘active 
306 
ingredient(s)’ that elicit the behavioural response - which in this case concerns the alteration of 
307 
attributes of objects or stimuli within the proximal physical micro-environment, such as their size or 
308 
position; and (ii) the focus of that content. Ontological relationships both within TIPPME, and 
309 
between TIPPME and other relevant typologies or taxonomies, are likely to be complex - 
310 
particularly as there may be variation in the level of explanation or granularity applied in each case. 
311 
Further development work is therefore needed to clarify and specify the form and structure of these 
312 
relationships, as well as the ways in which different frameworks may be usefully applied in 
313 
combination. Relatedly, TIPPME does not at present attempt to delineate the mechanisms of action 
314 
that underlie each intervention type but, if it fulfils its stated aims, this should facilitate primary and 
315 
secondary research directed towards furthering understanding of such mechanisms. 
316 
 
317 
Whether TIPPME is viewed as a typology, or, with additional development and validation, a more 
318 
definitive taxonomy, depends on the epistemological position that one adopts. The way that some 
319 
authors describe ontologies is unequivocally realist, whereby a properly developed ontology will 
320 
describe the real world as it is, rather than just as it appears to be to the observer31. Contrary to this, 
321 
phenomenologists such as Schutz32 view ontologies as theories about the nature of being in the 
322 
world, and typologies and typifications as the means of seeing and interpreting that world; the 
323 
       13 
 
plastic nature of such conceptual constructs is emphasised. A true ontology would take full account 
324 
of both realist and phenomenalist perspectives and indeed our approach to developing TIPPME has 
325 
drawn on both of these traditions. In the initial phase of development, we derived provisional types 
326 
from empirical studies; while in latter phases we have sought to use a mix of realist and other forms 
327 
of knowledge to refine the typology to align with various priors (including theoretical 
328 
understandings) about relations between concepts and ideas, either as we imagine the world appears 
329 
to be, or as we imagine the world should be if it conformed to our prior beliefs. 
330 
  
331 
We judge the level of granularity of TIPPME to be appropriate to fulfil our aims; being relatively 
332 
simple but enabling discrimination between multiple intervention types. Evidence of how our 
333 
provisional typology23 has been used to, for example, frame funding calls, inform policy documents 
334 
and to characterise interventions in systematic reviews (see Methods), suggests that TIPPME has 
335 
the potential to be similarly useable. However, its granularity could be increased, should important 
336 
intervention sub-types or additional characteristics be highlighted. This could be through 
337 
conducting systematic reviews of specific intervention types in which key intervention 
338 
characteristics are identified (e.g.33-35), or mapping relationships between TIPPME and other 
339 
classification systems. 
340 
 
341 
TIPPME and the methods used to generate it have several limitations. Our first reliability testing 
342 
exercise, while demonstrating that TIPPME can be reliably used by those outside of the research 
343 
team, used a relatively small sample of experts, predominantly academic researchers. Whilst such a 
344 
sample is likely to be broadly representative of some of the most likely users of the typology, there 
345 
will be other groups that were inadequately represented. Furthermore, the majority of the 
346 
development process was conducted by the core research team. While a wide range of disciplinary 
347 
backgrounds was represented, and many of the group had extensive policy and guidance 
348 
development experience, the team was weighted towards research expertise. A more rigorous and 
349 
       14 
 
comprehensive series of assessments, likely also integrating responses from a wider cross-section of 
350 
potential user groups, will be required for greater confidence in TIPPME’s reliability, particularly 
351 
for use outside of the research community. A further limitation is that TIPPME is currently only 
352 
applied to three consumption behaviours, which, while highly important – with metabolic and 
353 
dietary risk factors linked to food consumption, as well as smoking and alcohol use, all being 
354 
amongst the most significant risk factors contributing to global disease burden2 – do not encompass 
355 
all of the human behaviours that significantly impact on health. Most notably, although it was 
356 
included in the provisional typology23, physical activity was not included here. We judged that it 
357 
was not practicable to include due to it being conceptually distinct. This is because, unlike selection, 
358 
purchase and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco, physical activity does not necessarily 
359 
relate to products that are separable from and placed within a given environment (see Methods, 
360 
Stage 3 for further details).  
361 
 
362 
While the current behavioural focus of TIPPME limits its generalisability, the typology is intended 
363 
to be broad in scope so that it could potentially be adapted to apply to other behaviours. When 
364 
considering the current and potential future scope of TIPPME in terms of the behavioural domains 
365 
to which it applies, it may be helpful to map its categories to a systematically-developed framework 
366 
of behaviours, such as Nudelman and Shiloh’s taxonomy of health behaviours36. Within this 
367 
taxonomy, TIPPME is currently aligned to nutrition and risk avoidance behaviours, these being 
368 
related to consumption of products that are linked to non-communicable disease. In theory, 
369 
TIPPME may be applicable to a wide range of other behaviours, including those unrelated to 
370 
product consumption (e.g. physical activity or gambling behaviours), those linked to the prevention 
371 
of communicable disease (e.g. hygiene-related behaviours) and pro-environmental behaviours to 
372 
mitigate climate change (e.g. energy use or recycling behaviours). Such translation will require 
373 
specific programmes of development and testing.  
374 
 
375 
       15 
 
In the process of developing TIPPME, some challenging conceptual issues were encountered. Most 
376 
notably, to ensure TIPPME had the potential to discriminate, it was intended that each intervention 
377 
type (typology row) would represent a distinct way in which the proximal physical micro-
378 
environment can be altered, with any single discrete intervention component being assignable to a 
379 
single intervention type. However, it was quickly apparent that there was an inevitable degree of 
380 
conceptual overlap or co-dependence between the different intervention categories. For example, if 
381 
we consider an intervention in which restaurant patrons are provided with smaller (versus larger) 
382 
spoons to attempt to reduce dessert consumption, we would expect most users would characterise 
383 
this as a ‘Size’ intervention. Manipulating the size of a spoon will also likely affect the way the 
384 
spoon looks and feels i.e. ‘Presentation’, however, and so either or both types could feasibly be 
385 
applied for all ‘Size’ interventions. While this is a fundamental conceptual issue linked to the nature 
386 
of the sensory, spatial and morphological attributes of objects and stimuli, for the purposes of the 
387 
typology it can be addressed by distinguishing between the primary target of the intervention and 
388 
secondary consequences. As explained in the typology and its accompanying instructions 
389 
(Supplementary information), assuming a single discrete intervention component or manipulation is 
390 
present, the user applying TIPPME will aim to identify a primary intervention type that best 
391 
captures it. Should there be multiple discrete, separable intervention components implemented 
392 
within the same environment, multiple different intervention types can correspondingly be applied. 
393 
In practice, reports of interventions will often support judgements of what the primary target of the 
394 
intervention is via their stated aims and hypotheses, and the way in which they describe intervention 
395 
content. Importantly, results of the reliability testing exercises suggest that despite these potential 
396 
challenges, the typology can be consistently applied by users.  
397 
 
398 
Because reliable application of TIPPME, as with any classification system, is dependent on making 
399 
informed judgements from the information that is provided, the increased attention that is being 
400 
given to improving the reporting of intervention studies37,38 will be beneficial. Additionally, we 
401 
       16 
 
would hope that TIPPME will enable those reporting on proximal physical micro-environment 
402 
interventions to specify the primary target of their intervention, thereby reducing future ambiguities.   
403 
The Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro-Environments, TIPPME, provides a 
404 
framework to reliably classify and describe an important class of interventions, and enable more 
405 
systematic design, reporting and analysis of interventions to change health-related behaviour at 
406 
population level. In doing so, we propose TIPPME makes a distinct contribution to collective 
407 
efforts to build the cumulative evidence base for effective ways of changing behaviour across 
408 
populations.

METHODS  
414 
 
415 
The development of TIPPME is summarised in Table 1 and involved three phases of work: a) 
416 
identifying the need for a typology; b) developing and elaborating on this typology; and c) 
417 
reliability testing and finalising. These were completed in seven main stages. Throughout, the 
418 
development process was integrated with formal and informal discussions between the core 
419 
research team as well as wider academic networks. The core research team (the authors) comprised 
420 
ten members with a range of disciplinary backgrounds across public health, health policy, 
421 
psychology and behavioural science, sociology, and evidence synthesis, and many of the group had 
422 
extensive policy and guidance development experience. They represented varied expertise in 
423 
developing and applying prominent typologies or classification systems relating to behaviour 
424 
change interventions and theory, developing, implementing and evaluating public health and 
425 
behaviour change interventions in a range of behavioural and population contexts, and developing 
426 
practice and research reporting guidelines.

Stage 1. Developing a provisional typology of physical micro-environment interventions  
435 
 
436 
Aim:  To generate a refined definition and provisional typology of choice architecture interventions 
437 
in physical micro-environments, and to map the available empirical evidence for the effects of these  
438 
interventions on diet, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco use.  
439 
 
440 
       18 
 
Methods: We conducted a large-scale systematic scoping review, published in 201323 In brief, the 
441 
methods used to develop the provisional typology involved highly sensitive searches of 15 
442 
electronic literature databases, combined with parallel snowball searches, retrieving over 800,000 
443 
unique title and abstract records. We used text mining methods to prioritise these records for 
444 
screening39 and manually screened over 54,000 prioritised records to identify 346 eligible full-text 
445 
articles.  
446 
 
447 
Results: Data extracted from these 346 articles (reporting primary evaluation studies and reviews of 
448 
such studies) were then used to configure, describe and synthesise the key characteristics of 
449 
interventions. This was an iterative process, incorporating regular discussion among members of the 
450 
review team, and resulted in the provisional typology in Figure 2, comprising nine types of 
451 
interventions: Ambience, Functional design, Labelling, Presentation, Sizing, Availability, 
452 
Proximity, Priming, Prompting.

459 
 
460 
 
461 
 
462 
Subsequent actions: The research team sought feedback on the typology from a wider group of 
463 
potential users concerning its usefulness and the scope for further development, including 
464 
discussion of conceptual issues that had been identified by the research team over the course of 
465 
conducting the scoping review.      
466 
 
467 
Stage 2. Receiving feedback from expert workshops 
468 
 
469 
       19 
 
Aim: To elicit feedback about issues with understanding and using the provisional typology of 
470 
choice architecture interventions.  
471 
 
472 
Methods: Two typology development workshops were conducted, attended by a total of 45 
473 
participants working in areas of behaviour change and public health intervention. Participants were 
474 
predominantly in research roles (80%, with 20% in policy or practitioner roles), with a range of 
475 
disciplinary backgrounds represented (psychology or behavioural science (38%); public health or 
476 
medicine (20%); nutrition (7%), policy (11%) sociology (2%), other or missing (20%)). To 
477 
encourage engagement with the provisional typology and elicit feedback, the workshops involved 
478 
completing the same brief intervention description coding task (classifying 14 intervention 
479 
descriptions by reference to the provisional typology) followed by a questionnaire assessing 
480 
perceived value of the work and its development, concluding with a structured group discussion. 
481 
 
482 
Results: There was strong support expressed for the value of developing the provisional typology 
483 
from academics and practitioners who attended: 95% (41/43 responses) of participants agreed with 
484 
the statement “developing this typology is valuable and important”. There was recurrent feedback 
485 
that further development would be necessary in order for the typology to be more widely applied. 
486 
Issues highlighted that would need to be considered in future included: identifying some 
487 
inconsistencies in the intervention types concerning whether they related to the content or the 
488 
mechanism of the intervention (for example, one of the intervention types, ‘priming’, related 
489 
primarily to a mechanism of effect and was therefore not equivalent to other intervention types); 
490 
whether the ‘labelling’ and ‘prompting’ intervention types were clearly distinct; and the difficulty 
491 
of coding physical activity interventions. The intervention description coding task was principally 
492 
intended only to encourage engagement and general feedback within the workshops. However, in 
493 
line with qualitative feedback received from participants, its results did suggest that typology 
494 
       20 
 
categories could be applied consistently (Fleiss’ kappa =.83), supporting using the basic structure 
495 
and content of the provisional typology as a foundation for future development.  
496 
 
497 
Subsequent actions: In preparation for future development of the typology, the initial research team 
498 
was extended to include two behaviour change experts with expertise in developing and applying 
499 
prominent typologies of behaviour change interventions and theory, and a public health expert with 
500 
expertise in environmental determinants of health and the evaluation of public health interventions. 
501 
It was agreed by the research team that development of a new typology would be valuable, 
502 
informed by both the workshops and other external indicators of potential value. For example, the 
503 
provisional typology had been used to frame two calls from a national research funding body 
504 
(National Institute for Health Research (UK)), had directly informed policy documents and 
505 
guidelines (e.g. NICE (2014), Department of Health (2015)) and was being used for characterising 
506 
and defining interventions in several systematic reviews (e.g.33-35,40,41).  
507 
 
508 
Stage 3. Generating a preliminary version of TIPPME 
509 
 
510 
Aim: To generate by consensus a preliminary version of TIPPME that would be subject to further 
511 
development. 
512 
 
513 
Methods: A two-day residential meeting of the core research team (the authors) was held. This 
514 
meeting comprised a series of structured discussions, informed by feedback received from the 
515 
expert workshops (Stage 2) and from colleagues within wider networks.  
516 
Results: A preliminary version of TIPPME was generated. Principal developments agreed at this 
517 
stage, representing changes to the provisional typology (Figure 2), were as follows: 
518 
i. 
A new matrix classification structure was created to enable representation of both different 
519 
intervention types (the rows of the typology), as well as differences in the spatial focus of 
520 
       21 
 
the intervention (the columns of the typology). This structural change stemmed from 
521 
agreement that a more conceptually coherent position would be to view any given physical 
522 
micro-environment as a set of objects or stimuli that could feasibly all be manipulated. This 
523 
would also allow greater flexibility in thinking about the range of possible interventions 
524 
within this space, whether these are only theoretically possible or are represented in the 
525 
current body of empirical literature.  
526 
ii. 
Intervention type ‘Ambience’ was removed and its place taken by the ‘Presentation’ 
527 
intervention type applied on the scale of the wider environment. This was because the new 
528 
typology structure means that objects and stimuli within the wider environment are 
529 
considered subject to the same intervention types as are the products themselves. 
530 
iii. 
Intervention types ‘Labelling’ and ‘Prompting’ were subsumed within a generic intervention 
531 
type pertaining to the communication of explicit textual, numeric or pictorial information. 
532 
This more inclusive category of information-based interventions – initially named ‘Words, 
533 
Numbers and Pictures’ and ultimately ‘Information’ - was considered more coherent, as 
534 
previous conceptual distinctions between ‘Labelling’ and ‘Prompting’ interventions were 
535 
unclear. This still allowed differentiation from other intervention types that focus on the 
536 
alteration of sensory, spatial and morphological characteristics.  
537 
iv. 
Intervention type ‘Priming’ was removed as there was agreement that this represented a 
538 
specific mechanism rather than an equivalent intervention type.  
539 
v. 
Notably, physical activity was excluded as a behaviour of interest. It was agreed that it was 
540 
not practicable to include this in a coherent and concise typology, given that, unlike food, 
541 
alcohol and tobacco, it does not involve the selection, purchase and consumption of products 
542 
that are separable from and placed within a given environment. It would be possible to adapt 
543 
the typology to physical activity, with the equivalent of the target product or object being the 
544 
physical space in which, or on which, the physical activity is performed. This physical space 
545 
may be a permanent part of, or the whole of, the proximal physical micro-environment 
546 
       22 
 
itself. However, adapting the typology to physical activity would be complex and require its 
547 
own specific explanation and translation.  
548 
  
549 
Stage 4. Identifying conceptual and practical problems with a preliminary version  
550 
 
551 
Aim: To attempt to use the preliminary typology in order to identify outstanding conceptual and 
552 
practical problems with TIPPME. 
553 
 
554 
Methods: The research team (n=8, excluding the first two listed authors who were responsible for 
555 
producing the exercise materials), completed a task which encouraged engagement with the detail 
556 
of the preliminary typology and its application. Each participant was given a link to an online 
557 
Qualtrics task comprising 40 short (<150 words) intervention descriptions. These represented a 
558 
sample of descriptions of interventions from the 346 papers that were included in the 
559 
aforementioned scoping review of choice architecture interventions23. We selected intervention 
560 
descriptions on a quota basis that covered a wide range of intervention content, aiming to include at 
561 
least 5 examples that could feasibly be mapped to each of the six intervention types within the 
562 
typology, with a spread across the three intervention foci and across food, alcohol and tobacco. We 
563 
used the first example that met our criteria that was encountered via random searching to ensure that 
564 
the intervention descriptions were varied in nature and broadly representative of the wider empirical 
565 
literature. The 40 intervention descriptions were presented to each participant in a random order. 
566 
For each intervention example, participants were asked to assess which category in the typology 
567 
best captured the example, how much overlap existed between the intervention types they 
568 
considered selecting, and to describe any difficulties they encountered in coding the example and 
569 
any possible alterations to the typology that would have ameliorated these difficulties. For each 
570 
intervention example, they were encouraged to provide further qualitative feedback concerning each 
571 
intervention example, and the overall structure and content of the typology. 
572 
       23 
 
Results: Quantitative and qualitative responses from the task were synthesised. While quantitative 
573 
results suggested that intervention types could be applied consistently (Fleiss’ kappa=.69), the task 
574 
was principally intended to highlight areas in which there were significant levels of disagreement, 
575 
comment or criticism, in order to prioritise focused discussion.  
576 
 
577 
Subsequent actions: A teleconference of the research team was convened, and a structured 
578 
discussion was conducted. This involved assessing problematic intervention descriptions in a 
579 
structured format, in order to reach agreement on steps to be taken to improve the conceptual 
580 
coherence and ease of use of the typology. Intervention examples where ≥50% of responses were 
581 
discordant were flagged for prioritised discussion. Discussion began in order of the intervention 
582 
descriptions that were coded least consistently, and terminated after all flagged examples had been 
583 
discussed. For each flagged example, individuals were encouraged to justify their responses and 
584 
propose and discuss solutions which could overcome the reasons why individuals coded 
585 
discrepantly. A vote then took place to assess if participants could converge on the same answer i) 
586 
without any further changes to the typology and ii) with specific changes to the typology (if agreed 
587 
upon). As a result of this process, various changes were made to wording of definitions, including a 
588 
clarification of the distinction between the columns within the typology. Additional guidance text 
589 
was added where it was agreed there was likely to be a greater chance of perceived overlap between 
590 
intervention types. Figure 3 shows the typology version at this stage.

Stage 5. Reliability testing exercise (i): Coding of intervention descriptions by external experts  
601 
 
602 
       24 
 
Aim: To test whether participants likely to use TIPPME, namely those involved in researching or 
603 
implementing interventions to change health-related behaviours, were consistent in identifying its 
604 
intervention types and foci in short descriptions of interventions. 
605 
 
606 
Methods: We recruited external experts with backgrounds in public health and behavioural science 
607 
as researchers or practitioners, meeting the following criteria (adapted from15): “active in their field 
608 
and engaged in designing, delivering and/or evaluating interventions to change health-related 
609 
behaviour that could be delivered at scale to impact on population health”. Recruitment was via 
610 
email and Twitter enquiries to possible participants within our wider academic networks. A similar 
611 
exercise to that described in Stage 4 was used, involving coding 40 short intervention descriptions 
612 
(<150 words) selected on a quota basis to represent a range of intervention content and of targeted 
613 
products. These were presented in a random order, using the question “Which intervention category 
614 
best captures the above description?”. Quantitative reliability statistics were calculated for the pre-
615 
specified primary outcome of discrimination of intervention type (the rows of the typology), as well 
616 
as for intervention focus (the columns of the typology) and a combined total.  As some agreement 
617 
would be achieved by chance alone, two different ‘chance-corrected’ agreement measures were 
618 
used, Fleiss’ kappa and prevalence and bias adjusted kappa (PABAK)42,43. 
619 
 
620 
Results: Potential participants (n=52) who had initially expressed an interest in participating were 
621 
contacted via email with a link to the exercise. All participants (n=33) who started the exercise 
622 
completed it. 58% were female, and most were in research roles (94%, with 6% in policy or 
623 
practitioner roles), with a range of disciplinary backgrounds represented (psychology or behavioural 
624 
science (45%); public health or medicine (18%); nutrition (15%); epidemiology (6%); economics 
625 
(6%); other (urban planning, marketing, human factors) (9%)). Inter-rater reliability values for the 
626 
exercise are provided in Table 2. A kappa value of .41-.60 is conventionally considered to represent 
627 
“moderate” agreement, a value of 0.61–0.80, “substantial” agreement, and a value of >.80, “almost 
628 
       25 
 
perfect” agreement44. Fleiss classified a kappa between .40-.75 as “Intermediate to Good” and >.75 
629 
as “Excellent”43. Therefore, the observed values indicate that the intervention types within the 
630 
typology in its current form are strongly distinguishable from one another. Furthermore, category-
631 
wise statistics indicate that each of the six intervention types and each of the three intervention foci 
632 
were able to be applied reliably. 
633 
 
634 
Subsequent actions: A two-day residential meeting of the research team was held to further refine 
635 
the typology. Although the structure of the typology was not altered, each intervention type was 
636 
given a concise single-word title (e.g. ‘Words, numbers and pictures’ was changed to 
637 
‘Information’), and some minor changes to wording of definitions were made. It was agreed that, 
638 
because intervention descriptions used in this exercise comprised short passages focused on the 
639 
intervention characteristics, this was not representative of how these might more typically be 
640 
encountered in full-text papers, where details may be spread disparately within papers, in 
641 
potentially complex formats. Furthermore, it was important that participants were able to code the 
642 
presence of multiple discrete intervention types identified within one paper, where previously they 
643 
had been asked to identify a single category that best captured an intervention. Therefore, a second 
644 
reliability testing exercise intended to be less artificial and more generalisable to real-world use was 
645 
planned. 
646 
 
647 
Stage 6. Reliability testing exercise (ii): Coding of intervention descriptions using full-text 
648 
papers  
649 
 
650 
Aim: To assess whether interventions described in full-text papers can be reliably coded to 
651 
categories within TIPPME.   
652 
 
653 
       26 
 
Methods: Following a pilot phase to develop the exercise, members of the research team (n=4) each 
654 
coded 24 study reports within full-text articles that were randomly selected (using a random number 
655 
generator) from those included in the initial scoping review23 but excluding review papers and those 
656 
not describing any intervention, those concerning physical activity interventions, and those that had 
657 
been used in previous stages of the typology development process. To ensure that a range of 
658 
behaviours was covered, randomisation was stratified by behaviour so that half of the papers related 
659 
to food and half to alcohol or tobacco. Where there were multiple eligible separate studies within a 
660 
single full-text paper, the first was used. The exercise involved each participant coding which (if 
661 
any) categories in the typology were identified in each study. The number of study reports to be 
662 
coded in this exercise was derived using the KappaSize R Package45, given that, to our knowledge, 
663 
there are no gold-standard methods to precisely estimate the required sample sizes for determining 
664 
reliability kappas in cases where there are both multiple coders and a large number of coding 
665 
categories. We estimated an approximate, conservative sample size based on the following 
666 
parameters: an alpha value of 0.05; power of 0.80, using 4 coders; an assumption that categories 
667 
will not be perfectly balanced and instead may be moderately unbalanced; a null hypothesis of a 
668 
kappa of 0.4 (i.e., the lower bound of ‘intermediate to good’ agreement on Fleiss’ Kappa 
669 
Benchmark Scale); and, an expected kappa of 0.7 (based on observed kappa values from reliability 
670 
testing exercise (i)). This suggested that at least 22 study reports would be required to test whether 
671 
the kappa exceeds 0.4. 
672 
 
673 
Results: Inter-rater reliability values are provided in Table 2. The observed values indicate that the 
674 
intervention types within the typology in its current form are strongly distinguishable from one 
675 
another when full-text papers are coded. Furthermore, category-wise statistics indicate that 
676 
underlying the summary statistics, each of the six intervention types and each of the three 
677 
intervention foci was able to be applied reliably. 
678 
 
679 
       27 
 
Stage 7.  Agreement on a final version of TIPPME 
680 
 
681 
Aim: To reach consensus on a final version of TIPPME including terminology, wording and 
682 
presentation.  
683 
 
684 
Methods: Research team members completed a final check of the typology and its wording, to 
685 
ensure it was clear and consistent throughout. A teleconference of the research team was convened 
686 
to discuss any identified issues.  
687 
 
688 
Results: Further descriptive notes and additional examples were added to the full version of the 
689 
typology to aid in its use. A final version of TIPPME was agreed upon by the research team, 
690 
described in the ‘Results’ section.
