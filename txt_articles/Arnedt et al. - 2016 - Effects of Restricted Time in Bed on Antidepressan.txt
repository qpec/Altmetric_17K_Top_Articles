Abstract
Objective—Antidepressant response onset is delayed in individuals with major depressive 
disorder (MDD). This study compared remission rates and time to remission onset for 
antidepressant medication delivered adjunctive to nightly time in bed (TIB) restriction of 6 hours 
(6h TIB) or 8 hours (8h TIB) for the initial two weeks.
Method—Sixty-eight adults with DSM-IV diagnosed MDD (25.4 ± 6.6 years of age, 34 women) 
were recruited from September 2009 to December 2012 in an academic medical center. 
Participants received 8 weeks of open-label fluoxetine 20–40 mg and were randomized to one of 
three TIB conditions for the first two weeks: 8h TIB (n=19); 6h TIB with a 2-hour bedtime delay 
(Late Bedtime, n=24); or 6h TIB with a 2-hour rise time advance (Early Risetime, n=25). 
Clinicians blinded to TIB condition rated symptom severity weekly. HAMD-17 rated symptom 
severity, remission rates, and remission onset were the primary outcomes.
Results—Mixed effects models indicated lower depression severity for the 8h TIB compared to 
the 6h TIB group overall (F=2.1, df=8, 226.9, p< .05), with 63.2% of 8h TIB compared to 32.6% 
of 6h TIB subjects remitting by Week 8 (X2(1) = 4.9, p < .05). Remission onset occurred earlier 
for the 8h TIB group (hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 – 0.91, p < .03), with no differences 
between 6h TIB conditions.
Conclusions and Relevance—Two consecutive weeks of nightly 6h TIB does not accelerate 
or improve antidepressant response. Further research is needed to determine whether adequate 
sleep opportunity is important to antidepressant treatment response.

 INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects roughly 16.5% of U.S. adults in their lifetime1 and 
is a leading cause of disease burden. Evidence-based pharmacotherapy is widely available, 
but treatment response time is delayed and failure rates are as high as 30–40%.2–4 Novel 
therapies are needed to accelerate and improve antidepressant response.
One night of total sleep deprivation improves mood in 60% of MDD patients;5 however, 
relapse following recovery sleep occurs in up to 80% of unmedicated patients (cf5,6). Serial 
repetition can sustain the positive mood response to total sleep deprivation, but relapse 
remains likely, particularly without concomitant antidepressant treatment.7 More recent 
studies combining total sleep deprivation with other chronotherapeutic interventions (light 
therapy and sleep schedule adjustments) and medication8 have shown promise, but these 
treatments are complex to administer.
Single-night partial sleep deprivation (PSD, 4–5 hours of sleep) has been explored as an 
alternative to total sleep deprivation. Studies found next-day response rates to PSD 
equivalent to total sleep deprivation9 with improved patient tolerance. Wakefulness during 
the second half of the night (late PSD, when rapid eye movement [REM] sleep 
predominates) is often superior to wakefulness in the first half (early PSD),10 but perhaps 
not if total sleep time is equivalent.11,12 Repetition of PSD during the initial 1–4 weeks of 
antidepressant therapy can accelerate treatment response13–15 and quality of life 
improvement,16 but these studies were conducted inpatient or in a laboratory setting and did 
not include sleep control conditions or sufficient follow-up after the PSD procedures. Ideal 
sleep-focused strategies would be clinically efficacious and maximize patient feasibility by 
allowing treatments to be carried out safely in the home environment. To date, no study has 
assessed the effects of a modest repeated restriction of time in bed on treatment response in 
outpatients with depression initiating an antidepressant treatment trial.
The primary aim of the present study was to compare the mood effects of two weeks of 6 
hours time in bed (6h TIB) to 8h TIB delivered adjunctive to antidepressant therapy in 
outpatient adults with MDD. A secondary aim was to investigate whether the timing of the 
TIB restriction was important by randomizing subjects to either a two-hour delay of bedtime 
(Late Bedtime) or a two-hour advance of risetime (Early Risetime). We hypothesized that 
symptom improvement would be greater and remission onset would be earlier for MDD 
subjects randomized to antidepressant therapy plus 6h TIB. We expected that, relative to the 
8h TIB condition, the Late Bedtime group would experience an increase in slow wave sleep, 
while the Early Risetime group would experience a reduction in REM sleep. Since most 
prior studies have shown late night sleep deprivation to be superior to early night sleep 
deprivation, we hypothesized that symptom improvement would be greater in the Early 
Risetime compared to the Late Bedtime condition.

 METHOD
Participants
Participants were recruited from September 2009 to December 2012 through advertisements 
and clinical referrals. Inclusion criteria were: (1) 18–65 years old; (2) DSM-IV diagnosis of 
MDD of at least moderate severity (≥18 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression, HAMD-17); and (3) habitual TIB of 7–10 hours nightly. Exclusion criteria 
included: (1) lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, substance 
or alcohol dependence, eating disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or obsessive-
compulsive disorder; (2) past 6-month DSM-IV alcohol abuse diagnosis; (3) medical 
conditions associated with depression (e.g., hypothyroidism) or interfering with sleep; (4) 
sleep disorder other than insomnia, based on the International Classification of Sleep 
Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2);17 (5) prescription or non-prescription medication for sleep 
or depression; (6) failed fluoxetine trial within the past six months; (7) overnight shift work; 
(8) pregnancy, breastfeeding, or inadequate contraception in women of childbearing 
potential; (9) known contraindication to fluoxetine; and (10) abnormal laboratory values. 
Subjects had to be free of antidepressants for ≥2 weeks (≥4 weeks for longer-acting 
antidepressants). Participants underwent an initial telephone screen and in-laboratory 
psychiatric, medical, and sleep screening. Study procedures were approved by the University 
of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board and participants provided written 
informed consent.
Study Design and Procedures
In this randomized, controlled parallel trial, participants received open-label fluoxetine 20–
40 mg for eight weeks and were randomized (1:1:1) to one of three TIB conditions for the 
initial two weeks: (1) 8h TIB; (2) 6h TIB, with a two-hour delay of bedtime (Late Bedtime); 
or (3) 6h TIB with a two-hour advance of Risetime (Early Risetime). After enrollment but 
prior to the first in-laboratory night, subjects maintained a regularized 8h TIB schedule at 
home for 5–7 days, which was based on their self-reported preferred bedtimes and rise 
times. Alcohol/drug use and napping were prohibited and habitual caffeine intake was 
permitted before noon. Schedule compliance was confirmed with daily sleep/wake diaries 
and with wrist-worn actigraphy (Actiwatch-2™, Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA).
Following the at-home 8h TIB schedule, participants spent seven nights and mornings total 
in the sleep laboratory: three before starting fluoxetine, two after the two-week TIB 
condition, and two after eight weeks of fluoxetine treatment. The first two pre-fluoxetine in-
laboratory nights were adaptation and baseline nights, respectively. Subjects maintained the 
8h TIB schedule and were assessed for sleep disorders on the adaptation night using 
standard procedures.18 Six subjects were excluded for suspicion of a sleep-related breathing 
disorder, based on ICSD-2 criteria. On the third pre-fluoxetine night, subjects were 
randomized to one of the three TIB conditions (8h TIB, Late Bedtime, Early Risetime) and 
maintained this schedule at home for 14.0 ± 1.6 nights until returning for two additional in-
laboratory nights. Participants underwent two final in-laboratory nights following the eight-
week open label antidepressant trial.

 Subjects took the first 20 mg dose of fluoxetine following the first TIB condition night and 
then daily for eight weeks, with a possible dose increase to 40 mg after Week 4 based on 
clinician-rated response. Pills were counted at each in-laboratory visit to evaluate 
compliance.
Blinded clinician ratings of mood were completed at baseline and weekly thereafter. 
Subject-rated depression scales were completed at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8; quality 
of life ratings were completed at baseline and Weeks 4 and 8. A two-hour neurocognitive 
test battery was completed in the morning following each in-laboratory sleep assessment 
(results not reported herein).
Outcome Measures
The HAMD-1719,20 was the primary outcome measure. Symptom changes were evaluated 
with the total HAMD-17 score minus the three sleep items (range 0–46)21,22 and remission 
was defined as a score ≤7.21,22 Removal of the three items from the HAMD-17 scale ensures 
that any observed mood improvements cannot be attributable to sleep-related improvements 
from the TIB manipulations. The Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement subscale (CGI-
I)23 was a secondary measure of clinician-rated improvement.
The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) was 
the subject-rated symptom severity measure.24 Symptom severity scores minus the sleep 
item (range 0–24) and remission (score ≤5) were the primary outcomes.3
The 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) was included as a quality of life measure.25 
The primary dependent variables are the physical and mental composite scores, which range 
from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better quality of life (mean = 50.0, standard 
deviation = 10.0).
Polysomnography—Electrophysiological signals were collected via standard 
polysomnography (PSG) montage26 using the Vitaport 3 (TEMEC Instruments, The 
Netherlands) digital PSG acquisition system. PSG records were scored visually off-line in 
30-sec epochs using standard criteria26 by sleep technicians blinded to group assignment. 
Changes in the following sleep variables from baseline to Week 2 were evaluated: total sleep 
time (total time asleep during the night); sleep efficiency (total sleep time/total recording 
time*100); sleep latency (time in minutes to initial sleep onset); number of arousals; % of 
Stages 1, 2, SWS (Stages 3 and 4), and REM; and latency to REM sleep (time in minutes to 
first REM episode).
Actigraphy—Actigraphs were set at a sampling rate of 1 minute and worn on the non-
dominant wrist during the pre-laboratory baseline nights and during the two-week TIB 
condition to assess compliance. Sleep/wake activity was estimated using Actiware® – Sleep 
software (Version 5.0) in combination with daily sleep/wake diaries. We followed 
established procedures for scoring actigraphy.27 The primary outcomes were TIB and total 
sleep time.

 Statistical Analyses
Continuous variables were analyzed in SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) with 
linear mixed models using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate goodness of fit 
for covariance structures.28 The main model was parameterized to evaluate the effects of 
TIB Condition (6h TIB vs. 8h TIB), Visit (Baseline, Weeks 1 through 8), and their 
interaction (Condition by Visit), adjusting for baseline covariates. Significant main effects or 
interactions favoring the 6h TIB over the 8h TIB condition on mood outcomes were further 
evaluated with post-hoc analyses comparing the three TIB conditions separately. Because of 
a-priori hypothesized differences in SWS and REM between the two 6h TIB conditions, the 
model analyzing PSG outcomes included all three levels for TIB Condition. Differences in 
time to remission onset were evaluated using discrete time survival analyses using Stata 13 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation or 
mean with 95% confidence interval [CI], with significance level set at 0.05.
RESULTS
Recruitment and Retention
A CONSORT diagram of participant flow through the protocol is shown in Figure 1. 
Overall, 58 subjects (85.2%) completed the two-week TIB condition and 54 subjects 
(79.4%) completed the eight-week study. Eleven of the 68 randomized subjects (16.2%) 
discontinued participation (3 8h TIB, 5 Late Bedtime, 3 Early Risetime) and three subjects 
(4.4%) were discontinued for protocol violations. Dropouts did not differ from completers 
on demographic or clinical variables.
Descriptive data for all randomized subjects are summarized in Table 1. The 8h TIB group 
had more years of education than the Late Bedtime and Early Risetime groups (p < .005).
Clinician- and Subject-Rated Symptom Changes
Summary data for clinician- and subject-rated symptom measures are shown in Table 2. 
Linear mixed models indicated a significant Condition by Visit interaction for the 
HAMD-17 (F=2.1, df=8, 226.9, p < .05). HAMD-17 ratings were significantly lower 
(indicating less depression) for 8h TIB compared to 6h TIB subjects at Weeks 3, 5, and 6, 
with trends at Weeks 2, 4, and 7. After two weeks, HAMD-17 ratings had improved by 36.0 
± 22.6% vs. 22.7 ± 31.0% for the 8h TIB and 6h TIB groups, respectively, but the proportion 
of subjects in remission at Week 2 did not differ. By Week 8, however, 12/19 (63.2%) 8h 
TIB subjects had remitted compared to 16/49 (32.6%) 6h TIB subjects (X2(1) = 4.9, p < .
05). Clinician ratings on the Clinical Global Impressions – Improvement subscale indicated 
an overall Visit effect (F=16.1, df = 195.8, p < .001), but no TIB Condition by Visit 
interaction.
No overall TIB Condition by Visit interaction was evident for QIDS-SR scores, but by Week 
2, scores were improved by 49.9 ± 31.4% for 8h TIB subjects compared to 24.5 ± 43.6% in 
6h TIB conditions (t=2.2, df = 56, p<.05). By Week 8, symptom improvement was 
equivalent between the two conditions. SF-12 mental health composite scores were

 significantly more improved in the 8h TIB group by Week 8 (p < .04) with a trend for 
significantly more improvement by Week 4.
Onset of Symptom Remission
The HAMD-17 remission survival functions for the 8h TIB and 6h TIB conditions differed 
significantly (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 – 0.91, p < .03), with remission onset 
occurring after 6.4 ± 2.2 weeks for the 8h TIB group compared to 7.3 ± 1.5 weeks for the 6h 
TIB conditions (Figure 2). Onset of QIDS-SR remission (8h TIB: 6.7 ± 2.3 weeks vs. 6h 
TIB: 7.5 ± 1.8 weeks) was earlier for 8h TIB compared to 6h TIB subjects, but the survival 
functions were not significantly different.
Polysomnography
Polysomnography outcomes are displayed in Table 3. Linear mixed models indicated a 
significant increase in slow-wave sleep percent at Week 2 in the Late Bedtime condition 
compared to baseline (β = 8.4, SE = 2.4, p < .001). Post-hoc analyses indicated that, from 
baseline to Week 2, slow-wave sleep percent increased by 4.2 ± 11.2% for Late Bedtime 
subjects compared to a 4.0 ± 5.1% decrease in the 8h TIB condition (p < .002). REM sleep 
percent at Week 2 was significantly lower in the Early Risetime group compared to baseline 
(β = −5.3, SE = 2.6, p < .05). Post-hoc analyses indicated that REM sleep percent declined 
more in the Early Risetime compared to the 8h TIB (−6.9 ± 5.5% vs. −1.2 ± 11.3%, p<.05), 
but not the Late Bedtime condition. Across sleep conditions, light Stage 1 sleep was 3.2 
± 4.4% higher at Week 2 relative to baseline (β=4.4, SE=1.1, p < .001) and REM latency 
was 45.4 ± 59.9 minutes longer (β=31.9, SE=14.0, p < .03), consistent with the known 
effects of fluoxetine on sleep.
Compliance
Actigraphy outcomes (n=58) at baseline and during the 2-week TIB manipulation are shown 
in Table 4. All three groups showed good compliance with the baseline 8h TIB schedule, 
with no significant group differences in any actigraphy parameter. During the 2-week 
experimental manipulation, TIB was 8.0 ± 0.5 hours for 8h TIB subjects and 6.9 ± 1.2 hours 
for 6h TIB subjects (Late Bedtime 6.7 ± 1.0 hours, Early Risetime 7.0 ± 1.3 hours) (t = 3.8, 
df = 56, p < .001). Daily deviation from assigned TIB was 0.9 ± 29.7 minutes for the 8h TIB 
group, 41.9 ± 58.8 minutes for the Late Bedtime group, and 60.1 ± 80.4 minutes for the 
Early Risetime group (p < .01 for 8h TIB vs. Early Risetime). More 8h TIB (82.4%) than 6h 
TIB (53.7%) subjects were within 30 minutes of their assigned TIB schedule at the end of 
the two-week period (X2 = 4.2, df = 1, p < .04), however, including compliance as a 
covariate in analyses of primary outcomes did not change the findings. Actigraphically-
measured nightly total sleep time was 6.6 ± 1.0 for the 8h TIB group and 5.9 ± 1.1 for the 6h 
TIB groups (Late Bedtime 5.7 ± 0.9 hours, Early Risetime 6.1 ± 1.2 hours) (t = 2.2, df = 56, 
p < .03). During the 2-week experimental phase, sleep latency did not differ between TIB 
conditions, but wake after sleep onset was significantly longer in the 8h compared to the 6h 
TIB condition (44.8 ± 23.2 vs. 28.3 ± 18.1 minutes, t=2.8, df=55, p < .006).

 No differences were evident in medication compliance; in the percentage of participants who 
increased to fluoxetine 40 mg (8h TIB 42.1% vs. Late Bedtime 54.2% vs. Early Risetime 
48.0%); or in the timing of fluoxetine dose increase.
DISCUSSION
This randomized controlled trial found that a 6h TIB schedule during the first two weeks of 
antidepressant therapy did not augment treatment response in young adults with MDD. 
Instead, depressed subjects who were provided an 8h TIB schedule had greater clinician-
rated symptom improvement, were more likely to achieve remission after 8 weeks (75% vs. 
42%), and experienced symptom remission onset one week earlier. These effects were not 
due to better medication compliance or to a higher medication dose in the 8h TIB group. 
Importantly, objective compliance monitoring indicated that subjects were compliant with 
the 8h TIB schedule, but subjects assigned to the 6h TIB schedule were not. To our 
knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate experimentally a modest repeated TIB 
restriction on antidepressant treatment response.
Compared to the 6h TIB condition, 8h TIB subjects experienced greater clinician-rated 
depression symptom improvement beginning at Week 3, 75% vs 42% remission rates at the 
end of treatment, and onset of remission after 6.4 vs. 7.3 weeks. The failure of TIB 
restriction to accelerate or augment antidepressant response contrasts with uncontrolled 
inpatient repeated partial sleep deprivation studies13–15 but is consistent with one of the few 
randomized controlled trials to evaluate whether one night of total sleep deprivation could 
accelerate response to paroxetine in older adults with depression.29 Given previous findings, 
it is conceivable that a nightly TIB restriction dose greater than 2 hours was needed or that a 
6h TIB schedule of longer than two weeks was necessary to produce beneficial mood 
effects. However, previous studies were typically conducted in inpatient or laboratory 
settings, which allow for controlled and safe delivery of sleep deprivation, but which are also 
impractical for outpatient practice. We were fundamentally interested in evaluating a more 
modest TIB restriction that has been used in experimental sleep deprivation studies,30 is 
commonly used in behavioral sleep medicine outpatient practice,31 and that would be 
feasible and straightforward to deliver in outpatient psychiatric settings.
Our study is the first to demonstrate that adequate sleep opportunity may accelerate and 
augment treatment response, although further studies are needed to address this question 
directly. At a minimum, our findings raise the possibility that consideration of TIB may be 
relevant in the initial stages of antidepressant medication therapy. We compared the 
trajectory of HAMD-17 score changes in our study with a previous 8-week open label study 
of fluoxetine 20 mg/day in MDD outpatients.2 That study found that the onset of treatment 
response occurred in 26.0% of subjects; onset was defined as a decrease of at least 30% on 
the HAMD-17 without a subsequent increase that led to a final decrease of 50% by 8 weeks. 
Using a similar definition, we found that 8/19 (42.1%) 8h TIB subjects compared to only 
6/48 (12.2%) 6h TIB subjects experienced an onset of response by Week 2 (X2(1) = 7.5, p 
< .006). These findings suggest that encouraging adequate TIB accelerated the onset of 
response while restricting TIB delayed it. These findings additionally complement our 
analyses indicating that remission onset occurred almost one week earlier in the 8h TIB

 group. It is notable that the 75% remission rate for the 8h TIB group after 8 weeks is higher 
than most randomized controlled antidepressant trials,3,32 highlighting the need for 
replication. In addition, while the overall and speed of treatment response on the subject-
rated depression measure did not differ significantly between groups, a similar pattern of 
results was evident. The less robust change in self-reported depression measures has been 
found previously,13,33–36 but could also be reflective of the less frequent subject-rated 
measurement. Our findings do highlight the importance of continued clinical follow-up after 
any sleep manipulation has ended to assess potential longer-term or delayed mood effects.
A secondary aim was to determine the importance of sleep deprivation timing, but we did 
not analyze the symptom severity effects separately by TIB condition because 8h TIB 
subjects showed greater improvements on all major mood outcomes. Sleep architecture 
changes with the TIB manipulations, however, were in the expected direction based on 
objective polysomnography. Specifically, Late Bedtime subjects had significant increases in 
SWS at Week 2, while the Early Risetime group showed a reduction in REM sleep. The PSG 
findings for the 8h TIB group are consistent with previous studies evaluating the effects of 
fluoxetine on objective sleep parameters in depressed subjects after two weeks of 
medication.37–40 Because the 8h TIB group had a better mood response, our findings do not 
support SWS increase or REM sleep reduction as likely mechanisms involved in any 
therapeutic effects of sleep deprivation, although mechanisms associated with restricted TIB 
may differ from those associated with responses to total and partial sleep deprivation. The 
existing literature on the role of sleep-deprivation-induced sleep architecture changes in 
antidepressant response is mixed. For example, a landmark study by Vogel and colleagues41 
found that patients deprived of REM sleep for three consecutive weeks showed more mood 
improvement than Non-REM-deprived patients, but these results have not been replicated. 
Similarly, early studies showing that restricting wakefulness to the second half of the night 
(when REM sleep predominates) was more effective than so-called early PSD (i.e., staying 
awake until 1:30 and then initiating sleep) have since been challenged.11,12,42 It is notable 
that the 8h TIB group was the only group to experience a reduction in slow wave sleep at 
Week 2 relative to baseline (4.0 ± 5.1% less). In a recent report, Landsness and colleagues43 
used acoustic stimuli to reduce slow wave sleep by 54% after one night relative to baseline 
(without reducing total sleep time) in 17 non-medicated depressed adults. The results 
indicated that next-day clinician- and self-rated depression scores decreased by 27% and 
10%, respectively. Thus, future experimental studies are needed to resolve whether total 
sleep time, specific sleep stages, the timing, and/or the quality of sleep are involved in 
antidepressant treatment response.
Actigraphy monitoring indicated good compliance overall with the 8h TIB schedule during 
the 2-week experimental phase (TIB of 8.0 ± 0.5 hours), while subjects in the 6h TIB group 
spent nearly an hour more TIB each night than prescribed, despite showing excellent 
compliance with their baseline 8h TIB schedule before antidepressant therapy initiation. 
Importantly, however, medication compliance was not different among the groups and 
remission rates for the 6h TIB conditions at the end of the 8-week trial were consistent with 
other studies. The TIB schedule non-compliance by 6h TIB participants may have 
contributed to the small group differences in total sleep time (0.7 hours difference on 
average), particularly between the 8h TIB and Late Bedtime groups. The actigraphy findings

 highlight the challenge of maintaining a restricted TIB schedule over time, raising questions 
about the feasibility of more intensive sleep deprivation protocols for depression (e.g., 
repeated wake therapy or chronotherapeutic interventions), despite recent promising 
findings.8 In addition to evaluating efficacy, future sleep deprivation studies in depression 
should monitor and report on adherence with adjunctive therapies (e.g., light therapy, sleep 
time stabilization) to measure the feasibility of these interventions.
The moderate sample size is a limitation as we could not perform subgroup analyses to 
evaluate moderators of treatment response. In addition, the sample was largely young, 
healthy, Caucasian men and women with depression; thus our findings may not generalize to 
other depressed samples. Subjects’ knowledge that they were receiving pharmacotherapy 
may have contributed to the higher response and remission rates. Moreover, we could not 
blind subjects to TIB schedule assignment; therefore subject expectancies may have 
influenced the results. TIB schedule assignment additionally did not take into account 
circadian phase information; thus the timing of the assigned TIB schedule relative to 
circadian preference could have affected the outcomes. In addition, differential amounts of 
environmental light exposure among the three groups, either during the experimental TIB 
manipulation or during the subsequent six weeks, could have specifically contributed to 
antidepressant treatment response and should be controlled more closely in future studies. 
Finally, we included limited measurement of sleep patterns or other potential moderators 
(e.g., comorbid psychiatric symptoms, diurnal mood variation) after Week 2; thus we cannot 
speculate on potential contributors to group differences between Weeks 2 and 8.
In summary, we found that a nightly 6h TIB schedule during the initial two weeks of 
antidepressant therapy did not accelerate or augment treatment response in young adults 
with depression; instead, our findings raise the possibility that adequate TIB duration may 
positively impact treatment response. Future studies that optimize and/or extend sleep 
duration while initiating antidepressant therapy are needed to address this question directly. 
In addition, more work is needed with larger, more ethnically diverse and older samples. 
Future treatment studies should systematically include measures to identify potentially 
important clinical moderators (e.g., diurnal mood variation) and sleep-related moderators 
(e.g., circadian preference, insomnia) of antidepressant treatment response in addition to 
evaluation of potential mechanisms of adjunctive depression treatments.

 Clinical Points
•
Effective and practical clinical strategies are critically needed to improve 
response and remission rates to first-line antidepressant medications.
•
Patients initiating a new trial of antidepressant medication should be 
cautioned against restricting their time in bed.
