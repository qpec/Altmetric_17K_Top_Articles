Abstract
Background: Maternal and paternal high-fat (HF) diet intake before and/or during pregnancy increases mammary
cancer risk in several preclinical models. We studied if maternal consumption of a HF diet that began at a time
when the fetal primordial germ cells travel to the genital ridge and start differentiating into germ cells would result
in a transgenerational inheritance of increased mammary cancer risk.
Methods: Pregnant C57BL/6NTac mouse dams were fed either a control AIN93G or isocaloric HF diet composed of
corn oil high in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids between gestational days 10 and 20. Offspring in subsequent F1–F3
generations were fed only the control diet.
Results: Mammary tumor incidence induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene was significantly higher in F1 (p < 0.016)
and F3 generation offspring of HF diet-fed dams (p < 0.040) than in the control offspring. Further, tumor latency
was significantly shorter (p < 0.028) and burden higher (p < 0.027) in F1 generation HF offspring, and similar trends
were seen in F3 generation HF offspring. RNA sequencing was done on normal mammary glands to identify signaling
differences that may predispose to increased breast cancer risk by maternal HF intake. Analysis revealed 1587 and 4423
differentially expressed genes between HF and control offspring in F1 and F3 generations, respectively, of which 48
genes were similarly altered in both generations. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis validated
13 chosen up- and downregulated genes in F3 HF offspring, but only downregulated genes in F1 HF offspring.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified upregulation of Notch signaling as a key alteration in HF offspring. Further,
knowledge-fused differential dependency network analysis identified ten node genes that in the HF offspring
were uniquely connected to genes linked to increased cancer risk (ANKEF1, IGFBP6, SEMA5B), increased resistance
to cancer treatments (SLC26A3), poor prognosis (ID4, JAM3, TBX2), and impaired anticancer immunity (EGR3, ZBP1).
Conclusions: We conclude that maternal HF diet intake during pregnancy induces a transgenerational increase
in offspring mammary cancer risk in mice. The mechanisms of inheritance in the F3 generation may be different
from the F1 generation because significantly more changes were seen in the transcriptome.

 Background
With 1.7 million new cases in 2012, breast cancer is the
most common cancer in women worldwide, and the in-
cidence is projected to continue growing [1]. However,
only 5–10% of breast cancers are attributed to an inher-
ited genetic cause [2, 3], and this leaves over 90% of
breast cancers to be caused by some other factors. It is
believed that environmental and lifestyle factors, such as
diet, play a critical role in affecting breast cancer risk
[4], and their effects on cancer susceptibility are likely to
be mediated by epigenetic modifications [5].
Studies show that a Western dietary pattern, one that is
higher in dietary fats, has been increasing around the
world [6, 7] and may be linked to increased breast cancer
risk [4]. Intake of dietary fats, especially saturated fatty
acids and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFAs),
has been climbing over the years [8], with intake of n-3
PUFAs declining [6]. A high-fat (HF) diet, especially one
where n-6 PUFAs are high, increases estrogenic activities
[9, 10] and is inflammatory [11, 12], which can stimulate
breast cancer growth. Our laboratory and others have
shown in animal models that maternal exposure to a HF
diet during pregnancy increases female offspring’s mam-
mary cancer risk [9, 13–16]. In addition, we found that
maternal intake of an n-6 PUFA HF diet consumed before
and during pregnancy increased mammary cancer risk of
daughters (F1) and granddaughters (F2), but not of great-
granddaughters (F3) [13], indicating multigenerational but
not transgenerational inheritance [17]. Multigenerational
inheritance of a trait caused by maternal exposures during
pregnancy, such as an increased susceptibility to breast
cancer, is seen in F1 and/or F2 but not in F3 generation
offspring. If the trait is also seen in F3 generation, inherit-
ance is transgenerational [18].
The lack of transgenerational inheritance in the off-
spring of HF diet-fed dams was puzzling because previ-
ously we and others discovered that several different
exposures during pregnancy led to a transgenerational
increase in mammary cancer risk and other adverse
health effects in F1, F2, and F3 generations. Specifically,
transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset diseases and
abnormalities, such as mammary cancer [13], prostate
disease [19], obesity [20], and autism-like phenotype
[21], has been found in offspring of dams that were ex-
posed to compounds such as ethinylestradiol [13], vin-
clozolin
[19],
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DDT)
[20], and valproic acid [21] during pregnancy. Common
to all these studies was that the maternal exposure took
place after fetal implantation, whereas a HF diet that re-
sulted in a multigenerational increase in mammary can-
cer risk was started before conception [13].
Mammals undergo two rounds of global DNA de-
methylation and remethylation during the embryonic
and fetal periods [22]. It is possible that in our previous
study, the reason why we did not see true transgenera-
tional inheritance of increased breast cancer risk was
due to introducing the HF exposure throughout the first
round of DNA methylation erasure in the zygote and
the subsequent remethylation, as well as during the sec-
ond round of methylation erasure, which took place in
primordial germ cells (PGCs), and the second remethy-
lation, which reestablished epigenetic marks on mature
germ cells [23]. Because PGCs originate from the poster-
ior endoderm of the blastocyst, the second round of epi-
genetic programming may have been affected by the
presence of the HF diet during the first round. To test a
possibility that maternal HF intake induces a transge-
nerational inheritance of mammary cancer risk, we
timed the HF exposure to start on gestational day (GD)
10. Pregnant women consume more dietary fats than
nonpregnant women, and the increase takes place be-
tween the first and second trimesters [24, 25].
Our study shows that maternal intake of a HF diet be-
tween GDs 10 and 20 caused a transgenerational in-
crease in mammary cancer risk tumors without any
other intervening dietary exposures. Results from RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis suggested that there was
a difference in how mammary cancer risk was affected
in F1 and F3 generation offspring by maternal HF intake
(i.e., whether the exposure directly affected fetal somatic
cells or the germline).
Methods
Breeding and dietary exposure
Male and female C57BL/6NTac mice were obtained
from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY, USA) and
housed
in
standard
rodent
housing
at
constant
temperature and humidity and with a 12-h/12-h light/
dark cycle at Georgetown University’s Department of
Comparative Medicine, in accordance with all institu-
tional and federal regulations.
To generate F1 offspring (Fig. 1a), 7-week-old mice
were mated by housing two females together with one
male per cage. Upon mating, mice were randomly di-
vided into two groups and fed a control AIN93G diet
until pregnancy was verified by the presence of a mucus
copulatory plug in the vaginal opening (GD 0). From
GDs 10 to 20, the pregnant dams (F0) were divided into
two groups and fed either a HF diet containing 41.1% en-
ergy from fat, 38.9% kcal of corn oil (CO), and 2.2% kcal
of soybean oil (SBO) (Additional file 1: Table S1), or they
were continued on the control diet (16.0% energy from
fat, 13.7% kcal of CO, 2.2% kcal of SBO) (Additional file 1:
Table S1). Because the length of pregnancy in these mice
is 19–21 days, the HF exposure took place during the
second and third mouse trimesters. The HF diet was made
isocaloric with the control diet by replacing some carbo-
hydrates with non-energy-containing cellulose (fiber). CO

 contains high levels of n-6 PUFAs. Both diets contained
10 g/kg SBO to ensure that pregnant dams received suffi-
cient levels of n-3 PUFAs. All subsequent generations
(F1–F3) were fed only the control diet.
To obtain F3 generation offspring, female F1 generation
offspring of dams fed a HF diet during pregnancy were
mated to F1 HF diet-fed males, respectively. No sibling
matings were performed. The control group was mated
similarly. Pregnant F1 dams of both groups were fed the
CON diet. These steps were repeated with F2 offspring to
obtain the F3 generation. The F2 generation was used for
breeding purposes only; that is, no experiments were per-
formed with or tissues collected from them.
Mammary tumorigenesis
To induce mammary tumors (Fig. 1b), female C57BL6/
NTac mice (n = 30 for F1 control, n = 30 for F1 HF; n =
20 for F3 control, and n = 25 for F3 HF offspring) were
first primed with 15 mg/kg of medroxyprogesterone
acetate (MPA; Greenstone, Peapack, NJ, USA) at postna-
tal day (PND) 42. One milligram of 7,12-dimethylben-
z[a]anthracene (DMBA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) in 0.1 ml of CO was administered by oral gavage
on PNDs 49, 56, and 63. After the last DMBA dose,
tumor development was monitored by palpation once
weekly for 20 weeks. If tumors were detected, their sizes
were measured by calipers. The following endpoints
were determined: incidence (number of mice with tu-
mors), latency (time to first tumor), multiplicity (number
of tumors per mouse), and burden (total tumor volume
per mouse). The overall health of mice was monitored
daily. A mouse was killed prior to the end of the tumor-
monitoring period if it lost a significant amount of
weight or if the tumor reached 10% of the mouse’s body
weight. Mice killed for health reasons not pertaining to
the study were excluded from the analysis. Tumor histo-
pathology was assessed by a certified pathologist.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess dif-
ferences in tumor incidence between groups, followed
by log-rank tests. Tumor latency and multiplicity differ-
ences were assessed by t test. Difference in tumor bur-
den was assessed by repeated measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA).

Fig. 1 Transgenerational study design. a Pregnant C57BL/6NTac mice (F0) were fed either a high-fat (HF; n = 10) or control (CON; n = 10) diet. The
HF diet was fed to dams from gestational day (GD) 10 to GD 20. All offspring were fed the CON diet after birth for the remainder of the study,
including during pregnancies of F1 and F2 generation offspring. b All pups were cross-fostered at birth (postnatal day [PND] 1) to a CON mother
to eliminate litter bias. Pups were weighed on PNDs 2 and 3 and weaned on PND 21. Tumorigenesis was initiated on PND 42 by priming female
mice with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 15 mg/kg), followed by oral gavage of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA; 1 mg/dose/week)
for 3 weeks. Tumorigenesis was monitored by palpation once per week starting 3 weeks after final DMBA administration up to 20 weeks post-DMBA.
Mammary glands (MGs) and tumors were collected and processed from F1 and F3 offspring unexposed to DMBA on PND 50 for whole mounts and
on PND 100 to perform RNA sequencing analysis

 transcriptome, respectively (Fig. 1b). At the end of the
tumor-monitoring period, offspring in F1 and F3 genera-
tions were killed, and whole blood was collected via car-
diac puncture and placed into serum gel separator tubes.
We then collected mammary tumors, resected a portion
for formalin-fixed, paraffin embedding, and flash-froze
the remaining tissues in cryotubes in liquid nitrogen.
Terminal end buds
Whole mounts were prepared according to an estab-
lished protocol [26]. For that purpose, the left fourth ab-
dominal mammary glands were stretched onto a slide,
fixed, and stained with carmine aluminum solution.
Slides were examined blindly under a microscope to de-
termine the total number of terminal end buds (TEBs).
These are the structures that give rise to malignant
mammary tumors in mice and rats [27] and to similar
structures in humans, called terminal ductal lobular
units, which also are the sites of most breast cancers
[28]. Differences in TEB numbers between the offspring
of dams fed the HF or control diet were analyzed by t
tests in both generations separately.
RNA sequencing
To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) be-
tween offspring of dams exposed to the HF or control
diet during pregnancy, RNA-seq was performed. Total
RNA was extracted from the right fourth mammary
glands obtained on PND 100 from F1 and F3 generation
offspring that were not treated with DMBA by using the
RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, Ger-
mantown, MD, USA) with on-column DNase digestion
(QIAGEN Sciences) per the manufacturer’s protocol.
The concentration and purity of the extracted RNA were
determined by using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotom-
eter (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The qual-
ity of the samples was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for RNA
integrity number (>7.0) and concentration (minimum
70 ng/μl). RNA-seq was performed by GENEWIZ (South
Plainfield, NJ, USA). The HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA) was used for RNA-seq in a 1 × 50-
bp single-read configuration in rapid run mode, with a
total of at least 120 million reads per lane over 5 lanes
with a read depth of at least 10 million reads per sample.
A total of five control and three HF offspring in the F1
generation and four control and five HF offspring in the
F3 generation were used for RNA-seq analysis.
Rsem was used to quantify transcript abundance using
the mouse genome Mus musculus as a reference. With a
p value cutoff of 0.05, we obtained 5620 DEGs for further
analysis. We then selected those 48 DEGs that were seen
in both F1 and F3 generation offspring, with the direction
(up- or downregulation) of differential expression being
similar in the two generations, and performed Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA; QIAGEN Bioinformatics, Red-
wood City, CA, USA) to assess function of the DEGs.
Knowledge-fused differential dependency network (KDDN)
analysis was also performed on the 48 DEGs to assess tran-
scriptional gene interaction unique to either control or HF
offspring [29].
Validation of RNA-seq data by quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction
Of the 48 DEGs, we attempted to validate the expression
of 13 genes that were selected on the basis of their
reported association with breast cancer. RNA was ex-
tracted from the right fourth mammary glands of six
control and six HF offspring of F1 generation and also
of six control and six HF offspring of F3 generation
using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit per the manu-
facturer’s protocol. These mice included those used for
RNA-seq. The concentration, purity, and quality of RNA
samples were assessed as described above. A quantity of
2 μg of RNA per sample was used to generate comple-
mentary DNA (cDNA) via reverse transcription using
the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and was run
on a PTC-100 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA). Product cDNA was brought to a
working concentration of 5 ng/μl and mixed with ABso-
lute QPCR, SYBR Green, ROX mix (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, Waltham, MA, USA) and gene-specific forward
and reverse primers. Primers used in quantitative poly-
merase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis were designed
using IDT tool primer design (Integrated DNA Tech-
nologies, Coralville, IA, USA) (primer sequence provided
in Additional file 2: Table S2). Real-time qPCR was
carried out using a 7900HT Real-Time PCR system (Ap-
plied Biosystems). Expression of target genes was calcu-
lated by the relative standard curve method normalized
to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Statistical differences between
the control and F1 HF and F3 HF groups were assessed
by one-way ANOVA.
Results
Effect of maternal HF intake on offspring mammary
tumorigenesis
Maternal exposure to a HF diet during pregnancy did not
affect the distribution of benign versus malignant mam-
mary tumors among the offspring. Malignant mammary
tumors were those that were either papillary or tubular
adenocarcinomas or mammary carcinomas. Among the
control offspring, 58.3% and 64.3% were malignant in the
F1 and F3 generations, respectively (Additional file 3:
Figure S1a), compared with 66.0% and 77.3% in the F1 and
F3 generation HF offspring (Additional file 3: Figure S1b).

Page 4 of 13
 When we assessed differences in tumor incidence, we
observed that only those with a malignant phenotype
were included in the analysis. Female offspring exposed
to the HF diet through a pregnant dam exhibited in-
creased tumor incidence in F1 (Fig. 2a) (p < 0.016) and
F3 (Fig. 2b) (p < 0.040) generations compared with con-
trol offspring. Mammary tumor burden was also in-
creased in the F1 generation (Fig. 2c) (p < 0.027), but the
increase failed to reach statistical significance in the F3
generation (Fig. 2d) (p < 0.242).
Maternal HF exposure during pregnancy induced earl-
ier onset of mammary cancer in F1 generation (Fig. 2e)
(p < 0.028) and had a similar trend in F3 generation off-
spring (Fig. 2f) (p < 0.110). Mammary tumor multiplicity
was unaffected by maternal HF exposure (Additional
file 4: Figure S2).
Offspring mammary gland morphology
Mammary gland morphology was assessed using whole
mounts obtained from female offspring at PND 50. The
number of TEBs (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3a) was
counted and found to be significantly higher in HF off-
spring for both F1 (Fig. 3b) (p < 0.035) and F3 genera-
tions (Fig. 3c) (p < 0.023).
Differentially expressed genes in mammary glands of HF
diet-exposed offspring
To elucidate the potential differences in mammary can-
cer risk in the F1 and F3 generation offspring of HF
diet-fed dams, RNA-seq analysis was performed on nor-
mal mammary glands. In the F1 generation, 1587 DEGs
were identified, and in the F3 generation, 4423 DEGs
were seen (Fig. 4a). Of these, 390 were the same genes
in both F1 and F3 HF offspring. However, only 48 of the
DEGs were altered in the same direction (up- or down-
regulated) in both generations. Heat maps of these genes
are shown in Fig. 4b and c and Additional file 5: Table S3.
IPA indicated that the top pathways that were different
between HF and control offspring in both F1 and F3
generations were related to vitamin D receptor/retinoid
X receptor (VDR/RXR) activation, phosphatase and ten-
sin homolog (PTEN) signaling, farnesoid X receptor/
RXR (FXR/RXR) activation, hereditary breast cancer sig-
naling, and Notch signaling (Additional file 6: Table S4).
Top upstream regulators of these pathways were inter-
feron regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3 and IRF7, respect-
ively) linked to interferon and macrophage regulation
[30], and delta like canonical ligand 3 (DLL3), Jagged 1
(JAG1), and mesogenin 1 (MSGN1), which all are linked
to Notch signaling [31, 32] (Additional file 6: Table S4).
Top diseases and biofunctions involved development,
cellular functions, cancer and tumor morphologies, and
inflammatory responses (Additional file 7: Table S5).
KDDN analysis (Fig. 4d and e, Table 1) performed to
identify unique gene signaling interactions present in ei-
ther the HF or control offspring highlighted the follow-
ing ten genes as nodes: ALG6, DPF3, GRHL3, MAGIX,
MT-TS2, and OPTC (full gene names provided in Abbre-
viations section below; upregulated in HF offspring), as
well as AKR1C14, SLC5A3, SLC6A2, and ZBP1 (down-
regulated in HF offspring). These nodes had different
signaling connections in HF and CON offspring. The
node genes in the offspring of HF diet-fed dams were
linked to changes in genes that are indicative of

and impaired anticancer immune response (downregula-

dicative of reduced cancer risk (downregulation of DPF3,
SNORA41) and improved immune functions (upregula-
tion of ZBP1, ZFP683; downregulation of EGR3). These
differences potentially play a regulatory role in causing

 transgenerational inheritance of increased mammary can-
cer risk in the offspring of dams fed the HF diet during
pregnancy.
Verification of differential gene expression
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-
PCR) analysis indicated that all 13 genes differentially
expressed in the RNA-seq dataset between offspring of
HF and control diet-fed dams were validated in the F3
generation (Fig. 5). However, among the F1 generation,
none of the eight upregulated genes were validated:
AKT2, EGR3, HES1, ID4, JAM3, PCDHGA8, SLC26A10,
and TBX2 (Fig. 5a–h). Of the five downregulated genes
(IGFBP6, OAS3a, P21, SLFN1, and ZBP1) (Fig. 5i–m),
four were significantly and one was nonsignificantly
downregulated in both the F1 (OAS3a was not signifi-
cant) and F3 (IGFBP6 was not significant) generations.
Discussion
We found that maternal intake of a HF n-6 PUFA diet,
starting on GD 10 during the second half of pregnancy
and continuing until the end of pregnancy, increased es-
trogen receptor-positive (ER+) mammary cancer risk in
F1 and F3 generation mouse offspring. Transgenerational
inheritance likely requires that epigenetic changes induced
by maternal exposures during pregnancy persist in germ
cells. This possibility has been debatable because when F1
generation germ cells become fertilized, parental DNA

 methylation patterns are erased in the zygote [17, 22, 23].
However, a growing number of studies indicate that some
genes in preimplantation zygotes can escape the complete
loss of methylation marks that were established during
reprogramming events of germ cells [32, 33]. Further, it
has been shown that changes in histone marks in the pre-
conception oocytes can be transmitted across genera-
tions [34]. Results of our previous studies, as well as
results of multiple other studies, indicate that various

[13], 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) [35],
vinclozolin [19], or DDT in rats [20], or bisphenol A
[36], cause transgenerational alterations seen in F3 gen-
eration offspring.
Why, then, is the F3 generation not affected [13] if the
exposure starts before conception and involves both the
preimplantation period and the period when PGCs travel
to the genital ridge [22, 23]? It is possible that although
F1 generation PGCs are affected directly by the in utero
HF environment in both our previous study and the
present study, the changes can be transgenerationally
inherited only if the somatic cells in the blastocyst giving
rise to PGCs were not also affected. If true, maternal ex-
posures that
start before
conception and continue
through pregnancy can have multigenerational effects
only involving the F1 and F2 generations, but not the F3
generation.
To determine if similar changes occur in gene tran-
scription in F1 and F3 generations, when they are caused
by a direct exposure in F1 generation or inherited in F3
generation through the germline, we performed RNA-
seq analysis using normal mammary glands unexposed
to the carcinogen DMBA, which were obtained from
100-day-old offspring of HF and control diet-fed dams.
Surprisingly, over three times more DEGs were seen in
the F3 than in the F1 generation mammary glands.
Other groups have also reported greater gene transcrip-
tion differences in F3 than F1 generation offspring. Ma
et al. [35] found that maternal exposure to TCDD be-
tween GDs 8 and 14 resulted in a greater increase in
both messenger RNA and protein expression of the
imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) in the
rat liver of F3 than in F1 offspring. The increase was not
caused by differences in DNA methylation patterns,
which appeared similar in F1 and F3 generation off-
spring [35]. Consistent with these data, the differences
in DNA methylation that we found earlier in F1 and F3
generations between control and maternal EE2 exposure
groups were similar [13]. Thus, mechanisms other than
changes in DNA methylation likely explain the increase
in DEGs in the F3 generation offspring compared with
F1 generation offspring.
From among all the DEGs found in our RNA-seq ana-
lysis, we selected the ones that were similarly altered in
both F1 and F3 generation offspring of dams fed a HF
diet during pregnancy compared with their controls for
further analysis, because there possibly exists a connec-
tion between these 48 DEGs and the transgenerational
inheritance of increased breast cancer risk. According to
IPA, top biological functions of the DEGs were (1) devel-
opment (cellular, embryonic, organ, organismal, and tis-
sue), (2) cellular functions (cell cycle, proliferation, and
morphology), (3) cancer and tumor morphology, and (4)
inflammatory response (Additional file 7: Table S5).
Considering that the main component of the HF diet
was CO, a source of n-6 PUFAs, it is not surprising to
find inflammatory response on this list of affected bio-
functions. n-6 PUFAs and their arachidonic acid-derived
eicosanoids are considered proinflammatory and associ-
ated with many inflammatory diseases, such as various
types of cancer [11].
Five top upstream regulators of the 48 DEGs were
DLL3 and JAG1 (Notch ligands) [37]; MSGN1 (transcrip-
tional activator of a Notch signaling program) [32]; and
IRF3 and IRF7, which are both key transcriptional regu-
lators of interferons and macrophages [30]. Notch sig-
naling may also regulate IRF activity [38]. These results
suggest that Notch signaling may be altered in the off-
spring by maternal HF intake. Notch signaling was also
among the five top pathways altered in the offspring of
HF diet-fed dams, in addition to VDR/RXR and FXR/
RXR activation, hereditary breast cancer signaling, and
PTEN signaling. Researchers in earlier studies have
found that maternal HF diet intake increases offspring
Notch signaling in the hippocampus [39] and neural
stem cells in mice [40]. Because the Notch pathway reg-
ulates stem cell maintenance, cell fate specification, dif-
ferentiation, proliferation, motility, and survival during
embryonic development and in cancers [41], our find-
ings indicate that upregulation of Notch signaling in
the normal mammary glands in F1 and F3 generation
offspring of HF diet-fed dams may contribute to their
increased mammary cancer risk.
To further characterize the functional roles of the
DEGs,
the
networks
hosted
by
these
genes
were
constructed using KDDN analysis [29]. KDDN analysis
identified differential connections among transcription
factors that exist only in the mammary glands of off-
spring of HF diet-fed dams or only in the control
offspring. In the HF group, genes identified as connected
to the node genes were related to poor prognosis
(SEMA5B, ID4, TBX2, GRHL3, DPF3), increased cellular
proliferation and migration (GRHL3, PARP8, JAM3), and
altered immune response (ZBP1, EGR3). As an example,
the KDDN analysis indicated that upregulated grainy-
head like transcription factor 3 (GRHL3) interacted with
inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) and insulin-like
growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) in the HF
group, whereas its downregulation in the control group
interacted with glycerophosphocholine phosphodiester-
ase 1 (GPCPD1) and small nucleolar RNA, H/ACA Box
41 (SNORA41). Upregulation of GRHL3 is strongly im-
plicated in breast cancer [42], possibly by increasing the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition [43]. ID4, upregulated
in the offspring of HF diet-fed dams, is associated with
poor prognosis of breast cancer, inhibits BRCA1 func-
tion in basal-like breast cancer [44], and promotes

Page 10 of 13
 chemoresistance [45]. IGFBP6 was downregulated in HF
offspring, and it acts as a tumor suppressor [46]. The
interactions of downregulated GRHL3 in the control off-
spring with downregulated GPCPD1 and SNORA41 are
indicative of good cancer prognosis [47, 48]. Changes in
the expression of these genes and their interaction with
each other suggest that maternal HF n-6 PUFA diet may
not only lead to a transgenerational increase in breast
cancer risk but also increase breast cancer mortality.
This conclusion is consistent with our recent finding
that maternal EE2 exposure during pregnancy increased
resistance to antiestrogen therapy of ER+ mammary tu-
mors in the offspring [49].
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that consuming a HF n-6 PUFA
diet between GDs 10 and 20 during pregnancy causes a
transgenerational increase in mammary cancer risk in
mice. We also observed over three times more changes
in the mammary gland transcriptome in F3 than in F1
generation offspring of HF diet-fed dams, suggesting that
germline inheritance of increased mammary cancer risk
may involve additional pathways to those altered in the
adult mammary gland by a direct exposure of the fetal
somatic cells.
