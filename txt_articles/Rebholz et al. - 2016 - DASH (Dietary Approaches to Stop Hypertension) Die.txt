Abstract
Background—There are established guidelines for recommended dietary intake for hypertension 
treatment and cardiovascular disease prevention. Evidence is lacking for effective dietary patterns 
for kidney disease prevention.
Study Design—Prospective cohort study
Setting & Participants—Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants with 
baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (N=14,882)
Predictor—The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score was calculated 
based on self-reported dietary intake of red and processed meat, sweetened beverages, sodium, 
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, and low-fat dairy products, averaged over two 
visits.
Outcomes—Cases were ascertained based on development of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
accompanied by ≥25% eGFR decline from baseline, an ICD-9/10 code for a kidney disease–
related hospitalization or death, or end-stage renal disease from baseline through 2012.
Results—A total of 3,720 participants developed kidney disease during a median follow-up of 23 
years. Participants with a DASH diet score in the lowest tertile were 16% more likely to develop 
kidney disease than those with the highest score tertile (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.26; p for trend 
<0.001), after adjusting for socio-demographics, smoking status, physical activity, total caloric 
intake, baseline eGFR, overweight/obese status, diabetes status, hypertension status, systolic blood 
pressure, and anti-hypertensive medication use. Of the individual components of the DASH diet 
score, high intake of red and processed meat was adversely associated with kidney disease and 
high intake of nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products was associated with reduced risk of 
kidney disease.
Limitations—Potential measurement error due to self-reported dietary intake and lack of data on 
albuminuria
Conclusions—Consuming a DASH-style diet was associated with lower risk for kidney disease, 
independent of demographic characteristics, established kidney risk factors, and baseline kidney 
function. Healthful dietary patterns, such as the DASH diet, may be beneficial for kidney disease 
prevention.

 The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, a dietary pattern that is high in 
fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, substantially decreases blood pressure.1 The 
addition of sodium reduction to the DASH diet further lowers blood pressure and reduces 
the risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality.1-6 
The DASH diet has been recommended by multiple clinical guidelines for health promotion 
and disease prevention.7-11
While treatment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and diabetes is 
the primary approach to prevent kidney disease, evidence for dietary approaches to prevent 
kidney disease are lacking. Current clinical guidelines focus primarily on dietary restriction 
of protein and sodium to prevent kidney disease progression, but the evidence supporting 
this suggestion is weak (graded as level 2B).12 A comprehensive approach, such as that 
prescribed in the DASH diet, may be more meaningful given that nutrients likely have 
additive or synergistic effects.13 Furthermore, dietary patterns rather than nutrient restriction 
may be easier to implement given the success of the DASH diet for the prevention and 
treatment of other chronic conditions.14
Previous research has demonstrated a significant association between the DASH diet and 
kidney function reduction in older Caucasian women.15,16 The objective of this study was to 
assess the longitudinal relationship between consuming a DASH-style diet with sodium 
reduction and subsequent risk of kidney disease in a more diverse general population 
sample, including African-American and Caucasian men and women. Elucidating this 
relationship could inform the use of dietary modification as a preventative strategy for 
kidney disease.
METHODS
Study Population and Design
We conducted a prospective analysis of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) 
study.17 The ARIC study is a community-based observational study of 15,792 middle-aged 
(45-64 years), predominantly African-American and Caucasian men and women. Study 
participants were enrolled in 1987-1989 from four US communities: Forsyth County, North 
Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington 
County, Maryland. Follow-up study visits occurred in 1990-1992 (study visit 2), 1993-1995 
(study visit 3), 1996-1998 (study visit 4), and 2011-2013 (study visit 5). The Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) at each site approved the study protocol and study participants 
provided informed consent at each study visit (IRB #H.34.99.07.02.A1). After excluding 
participants with missing dietary intake data (n=18), implausibly low caloric intake (<600 
kcal for men and <500 kcal for women; n=149), and implausibly high caloric intake (>4,200 
kcal for men and >3,600 kcal for women; n=152), those with baseline estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or end-stage renal disease identified by linkage 
to the US Renal Data System (USRDS) registry (n=356), those who were neither African-
American nor Caucasian (n=48), and those with missing covariates (n=187), our analytic 
sample size was 14,882 (Figure S1, available as online supplementary material).18

 Measurement of Dietary Intake
Usual dietary intake was assessed at study visit 1 (baseline, 1987-1989) and visit 3 
(1993-1995) using a semi-quantitative 66-item food frequency questionnaire, modified from 
the Willett questionnaire.19-21 The questionnaire was administered in person by a trained 
interviewer with visual representations of portions (glasses and measuring cups of different 
sizes). Participants reported how often, on average, they consumed each food item of a 
particular portion size in the preceding year. Nutrient intake was calculated by multiplying 
self-reported frequency of consumption and portion size by the nutritional content of each 
food item from US Department of Agriculture data sources. The reliability of these diet data 
was previously assessed in a randomly selected subset of participants from all four sites who 
repeated the food frequency questionnaire at a follow-up visit (study visit 2, 1990-1992; 
n=419).19 For the analysis, we incorporated the two measurements of dietary intake 
(baseline and visit 3) by using the cumulative average diet, which improves estimation of 
usual dietary intake relative to a single measurement.22 That is, for those who developed 
kidney disease or were censored between baseline and visit 3, the baseline dietary intake 
data are used. Otherwise, for those who developed kidney disease or were censored after 
visit 3, the mean of the values from baseline and visit 3 is used.
Definition of DASH Diet Score
We assessed the degree to which study participants followed a DASH-style diet with reduced 
sodium using two previously developed indices.4,16,23,24 Study participants were not advised 
to follow a DASH diet, nor had the DASH diet results been published by the time of dietary 
assessment, and study participants did not receive dietary counseling. The primary analysis 
used a score based primarily on food items: low intake of 1) red and processed meat, 2) 
sweetened beverages, and 3) sodium; and high intake of 4) fruits, 5) vegetables, 6) whole 
grains, 7) nuts and legumes, and 8) low-fat dairy (Table S1).4 Each component was scored 
from 1 to 5 based on ranked distribution in quintiles, which is ideally suited to this analysis 
since the food frequency questionnaire is designed to rank individuals on dietary intake 
rather than quantify absolute nutrient intake levels.
In sensitivity analyses, we used an alternative score based on nine nutrients: low intake of 1) 
saturated fat, 2) total fat, 3) cholesterol, and 4) sodium; and high intake of 5) protein, 6) 
fiber, 7) magnesium, 8) calcium, and 9) potassium (Table S2).16,23,24 For the purposes of 
our study, the food item-based score and the nutrient-based score were both analyzed as 
tertiles. A higher score signifies that a participant's dietary pattern more closely resembles a 
DASH-style diet. Mean levels of DASH diet scores and individual components of the DASH 
diet scores for the overall study population and by case status are presented in Table S3.
Ascertainment of Kidney Disease
Blood levels of creatinine were measured using the modified kinetic Jaffe method, 
standardized to the National Institute of Standards and Technology standard, and calibrated 
to account for laboratory drift.25,26 Kidney function was assessed using the 2009 CKD-EPI 
(Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equationfor eGFR .27 
Measurement of urine albumin-creatinine ratio was not available in this study and thus was 
not included in the composite outcome variable.

 Kidney disease cases were ascertained by meeting at least one of the following criteria: 1) 
eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 accompanied by ≥25% eGFR decline at any follow-up study 
visit relative to baseline; 2) kidney disease-related hospitalization or death based on 
International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9/10 codes identified through active 
surveillance and linkage to the National Death Index; or 3) end-stage renal disease (dialysis 
or transplantation) identified by linkage to the USRDS registry between baseline (study visit 
1, 1987-1989) and December 31, 2012. This outcome was designed to mitigate potential 
selection bias by disease status and allow for more complete outcome ascertainment during 
periods of time between study visits. As a sensitivity analysis, cases of kidney disease were 
identified using visit-based measures exclusively, i.e. eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at a 
subsequent study visit accompanied by ≥25% eGFR decline relative to baseline.
Measurement of Covariates
At the baseline study visit, demographic characteristics (age, sex, race), socioeconomic 
status (education level), health behaviors (physical activity, smoking), and health history 
(diagnosed disease, medication use) were ascertained using a structured questionnaire 
administered by trained interviewers. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in 
kilograms divided by height in meters squared using measurements taken while participants 
were wearing light clothing without shoes. Three seated measurements of blood pressure 
were taken by a certified technician using a random-zero sphygmomanometer after resting 
for five minutes. The average of the second and third blood pressure readings was used in 
the analysis. Fasting blood specimens were collected from participants during the baseline 
study visit. Blood levels of glucose were measured by the modified hexokinase/glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase method.
Overweight or obese status was defined as BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Hypertension was defined as 
systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or current anti-
hypertensive medication use in the preceding two weeks. Diabetes was defined as fasting 
blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL, non-fasting blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL, self-reported history of 
diagnosed diabetes, or current diabetes medication use in the preceding two weeks.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics (means, proportions) were used to characterize the study population 
with respect to baseline demographic and clinical factors according to tertile of DASH diet 
score. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between DASH diet score and kidney 
disease, incorporating time to event. The minimally adjusted regression model (model 1) 
included demographic characteristics (age, sex, race-center), socioeconomic status 
(education level), health behaviors (physical activity, smoking), and total caloric intake (the 
standard method for energy adjustment).22,28,29 In model 2, we additionally adjusted for 
baseline kidney function (eGFR modeled as two linear spline terms with one knot at 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2). In model 3, we additionally adjusted for comorbidities relevant to dietary 
behavior and kidney disease risk (overweight/obese status, diabetes status, hypertension 
status, systolic blood pressure, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or 
angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]). Effect modification by demographic factors (sex,

 race), socioeconomic status (education level), and clinical characteristics (overweight/obese 
status, diabetes status, hypertension status) was assessed by conducting stratified analyses 
and tests of interaction. In a sensitivity analysis, we performed the same analyses using the 
alternative, nutrient-based DASH diet score. In addition, we investigated the relationship 
between the individual components of each score and risk of kidney disease, modeling all 
factors together in the fully adjusted model (model 3). Due to the expected underestimation 
of dietary sodium intake from the food frequency questionnaire, as a sensitivity analysis, we 
modified both DASH diet indices to exclude sodium. Tests for linear trend were conducted 
using quantiles as ordinal variables (tertiles for the total scores, quintiles for components of 
the primary DASH diet score in accordance with the classification of the individual 
components in this score). Stata version 14 was used for all analyses (StataCorp LP, College 
Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline characteristics of study participants included in this analysis of the ARIC study 
were similar to the total ARIC study population (Table S4). The subset of excluded study 
participants (n=910 [5.8% of total ARIC study population]) was more likely to be African-
American and overweight or obese, to have diabetes and hypertension, and less likely to 
have a high school education. By definition, excluded participants had worse kidney 
function at baseline.
Study participants with a DASH diet score in the lowest tertile were younger, more likely to 
be male and African-American, and less likely to have completed high school than 
participants (Table 1). They also had lower levels of physical activity, were more likely to 
smoke, and had a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity status. Higher DASH diet score 
was also associated with lower systolic blood pressure and higher prevalence of diabetes. 
Baseline eGFR was statistically but not clinically different across tertiles of the DASH diet 
score.
DASH Diet Score and Subsequent Kidney Disease
There were 3,720 cases of kidney disease during a median follow-up of 23 years. After 
adjusting for age, sex, race-center, education level, smoking status, physical activity, and 
total caloric intake, baseline eGFR, overweight/obese status, diabetes, hypertension, systolic 
blood pressure, and use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, participants with a DASH diet score in 
the lowest tertile were 1.16-times more likely to develop kidney disease than those with the 
highest tertile of the DASH score (Model 3: HR for tertile 3 versus 1. 1.16; 95% CI, 
1.07-1.26; p for trend across tertiles <0.001; Table 2).
The association between DASH diet score and risk of kidney disease was likewise evident 
using the secondary DASH diet index that incorporates nutrients rather than food items 
(Model 3: HR for tertile 3 versus 1, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.22; p for trend=0.007; Table S5). 
Similar patterns were observed using indices modified to exclude dietary intake of sodium 
from the score (Table S6). In a sensitivity analysis using eGFR exclusively for the outcome

 definition, there were 2,030 cases of kidney disease (55% out of a total of 3,720 cases) and 
effect estimates were stronger than those for the primary method for ascertaining cases of 
kidney disease (Model 3: HR for tertile 3 versus 1, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.36; p for 
trend=0.001; Table S7).
In stratified analysis, the association between DASH diet and kidney disease was similar by 
sex, race, and education level (Figure 1). The relationship between DASH diet and kidney 
disease appeared to be stronger among those without diabetes and without hypertension, but 
the test for interaction was not statistically significant. DASH diet score was more strongly 
associated with kidney disease among those who were not overweight/obese.
Components of DASH Diet Score and Subsequent Kidney Disease
Of the individual components of the DASH diet score, higher intake of red and processed 
meat was significantly associated with higher risk of kidney disease, and higher intake of 
nuts and legumes as well as low-fat dairy products was associated with a lower risk of 
kidney disease (Table 3). For the secondary DASH diet score, higher intake of magnesium 
and calcium was statistically significantly associated with a reduced risk of kidney disease, 
and higher dietary protein intake was associated with a higher risk of kidney disease (Table 
S8).
DISCUSSION
Our study of 14,882 middle-aged African-American and Caucasian men and women 
suggests that following a low-sodium DASH-style diet is associated with lower risk of 
kidney disease. Specifically, individuals with the lowest DASH diet score were 16% more 
likely to develop kidney disease than those with the highest DASH diet score. Higher intake 
of red and processed meat was associated with elevated risk of kidney disease, whereas 
consumption of other sources of protein including nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products, 
was associated with lower risk of kidney disease.
The present study is to our knowledge the first to report a prospective association between a 
DASH-style dietary pattern and subsequent kidney disease in a diverse study population. A 
cross-sectional analysis of an 869-person subset of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of 
Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study showed that those in the lowest vs. highest 
tertile of the DASH diet score had a three-fold higher odds of reduced eGFR (<60 mL/min/
1.73 m2) after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, health care access, diabetes, 
hypertension, smoking, and caloric intake among participants who were living in poverty 
(42% of the study population; OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.51-6.56), but there was no association 
among participants not living in poverty.16 In a prospective analysis of 3,121 older 
Caucasian women in the Nurses’ Health Study, the highest vs. lowest quartile of the DASH 
diet score was associated with lower risk of eGFR decline ≥30% after adjusting for age, 
hypertension, BMI, physical activity, caloric intake, smoking, diabetes, diabetes duration, 
cardiovascular disease, and use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38-0.80), 
with no variation by diabetes status.15 Our study extends this research by reporting 
associations in the general population setting for a large (N=14,882) and broadly 
generalizable study population. We observed similar effect estimates for men and women,

 Caucasians and African-Americans, and according to education level as a proxy for 
socioeconomic status.
An interesting aspect of our study is that the DASH diet was more strongly associated with 
risk of kidney disease among individuals who were not overweight or obese at baseline. It is 
plausible that those who were overweight or obese at baseline were previously advised to 
modify their diet due to their weight. As such, characterizing their dietary pattern at baseline 
may overestimate the quality of their diet over the lifetime. Another possibility is that risk 
estimates were attenuated among those who were overweight or obese due to reporting bias 
of dietary intake.30 Among study participants without diabetes and those without 
hypertension, the DASH diet-kidney disease association appeared to be stronger, although 
the interaction was not statistically significant. Further research is necessary to replicate 
these findings among individuals with co-morbidities.
There are several possible mechanisms by which the DASH diet may affect risk of kidney 
disease. It may reduce blood pressure, as was the original intention of the diet. It also has a 
lower dietary acid load (−25.5 mEq/d) than a typical diet (50-75 mEq/day).31,32 We have 
previously demonstrated that higher dietary acid load was associated with incident kidney 
disease in the ARIC study.33 The association between dietary acid load and kidney disease, 
which has also been reported by other investigators, may be due to activation of the renin-
angiotensin system or increase in endothelin 1 levels.34-45 Alternatively, as has been 
reported with other dietary patterns, not following a DASH-style diet may stimulate an 
inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction, which is a shared pathophysiologic 
mechanism for the development of both cardiovascular and kidney disease.46-50
Individual components of the DASH diet score may also drive the association with risk of 
kidney disease. In the present study, after adjusting for age, sex, race-center, education, 
smoking, physical activity, caloric intake, baseline eGFR, overweight/obese status, diabetes, 
hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, higher intake of 
red and processed meat was associated with higher risk of kidney disease; and higher intake 
of nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy was associated with lower risk of kidney disease. The 
significant associations from the secondary DASH diet score (protein, magnesium, calcium) 
were consistent with the main analysis: red and processed meat is a source of protein, nuts 
and legumes are rich sources of magnesium, and dairy products are a rich source of 
calcium.51 Increased dietary intake of protein is recommended for cardio-protection, 
whereas it is potentially harmful to the kidney.52 However, plant protein may protect against 
kidney disease through increases in serum bicarbonate and decreases in fibroblast growth 
factor 23.53 Lower serum levels of magnesium are associated with higher production of 
inflammatory and pro-atherogenic cytokines in endothelial cells, which is a pathway that 
might contribute to decreased kidney function.54,55 Milk protein contains peptides 
(casokinins and lactokinins) that have vasoactive properties, such as inhibiting the ACE and 
reducing blood pressure, an established kidney disease risk factor.56,57 Taken together, our 
results suggest that protein from meat confers higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes 
whereas vegetable and dairy sources of protein confer kidney protective effects. Future 
research and recommendations on dietary intake and kidney disease risk should differentiate 
between sources of protein.

 There are certain strengths and limitations of our study. As with any observational study 
design, residual confounding may be present. However, participants were extensively 
characterized with respect to demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and behavioral factors 
at ARIC study visits, allowing adjustment for many important confounders. The 
ascertainment of cases using a composite of criteria (eGFR, hospitalizations, deaths, USRDS 
registry) is clinically relevant, appropriate for research studies, and allows for the detection 
of a large number of cases.58 In a validation study, compared to medical chart review, this 
outcome demonstrated high specificity (96%) and low sensitivity (36%).58 Several ARIC 
study publications have used this composite outcome.59-61 In a sensitivity analysis of kidney 
disease based only on eGFR, the association between DASH diet and kidney disease was 
slightly stronger than that with the composite outcome. The lack of data on albuminuria, 
which is strongly associated with kidney function decline, is a limitation. The eGFR may 
have been affected by non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine level including protein 
intake and muscle mass.62
The strengths and limitations of dietary assessment deserve mention. Assessment of dietary 
intake by self-report is prone to reporting bias and other sources of measurement error.63 We 
reduced measurement error and reporting bias specifically by using data from questionnaires 
administered by trained interviewers following a standard protocol, using visual aids to 
represent portion sizes, and incorporating repeated measurements of dietary intake.22 In 
addition, administration of the food frequency questionnaire was repeated in a subset of 419 
ARIC study participants to quantify reproducibility of dietary assessment.19 The 66-item 
food frequency questionnaire allows for ranking of dietary intake of the food items assessed. 
Absolute amounts of consumed food items and nutrients (especially sodium) were likely to 
be underestimated due to the limited number of items on the questionnaire and lack of 
information on food brands and snack foods.64 However, in a sensitivity analysis excluding 
sodium from the DASH diet score, the effect estimates were essentially unchanged. Further, 
our finding that high intake of red and processed meat was associated with higher risk of 
kidney disease may in part be due to the fact that meat is a leading source of sodium 
according to NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)—specifically, 
cold cuts/cured meat, pasta with meat sauce, and mixed meat dishes.65 Nonetheless, results 
of analyses that present individual food and nutrient relationships should be interpreted 
cautiously.
The evidence on dietary patterns such as the DASH diet should be evaluated for potential 
inclusion in clinical recommendations for kidney disease prevention. Our results provide 
support for promotion of a DASH-style diet in an even broader segment of the US 
population for reduced risk of kidney disease in addition to blood pressure reduction and 
cardiovascular disease prevention.
In conclusion, consumption of a DASH-style diet was associated with lower risk of kidney 
disease, independent of demographic characteristics, caloric intake, socioeconomic status, 
lifestyle factors, comorbid conditions, anti-hypertensive medication use, and baseline kidney 
function in this general population sample of African-American and Caucasian men and 
women. The DASH diet, designed for blood pressure reduction and now widely

Note: Unless otherwise indicated, values given as hazard ratio (95% confidence interval). Model 1: Adjusted for age, sex, race-center, education 
level, smoking status, physical activity, total caloric intake, and all other factors in the DASH diet score (all eight individual components of the 
DASH diet score were included in the same model, i.e., 1. sodium, 2. red and processed meat, 3. sweetened beverages, 4. fruits, 5. vegetables, 6. 
nuts and legumes, 7. whole grains, 8. low-fat dairy products); Model 2: Model 1 + baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (linear spline terms 
with one knot at 90 mL/min/1.73 m2); Model 3: Model 2 + overweight/obese status, diabetes, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, use of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
