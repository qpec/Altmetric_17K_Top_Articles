Key Points
• tPA activates the contact
system, and PKal blockade
enhances tPA-mediated
thrombolysis.
• PKal contributes to
hemorrhagic transformation
and cerebral edema in mice
with acute stroke receiving
tPA.
Thrombolytic therapy using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in acute stroke is
associatedwithincreasedrisksof cerebralhemorrhagic transformationand angioedema.
Although plasma kallikrein (PKal) has been implicated in contributing to both hematoma
expansion and thrombosis in stroke, its role in the complications associated with the
therapeutic use of tPA in stroke is not yet available. We investigated the effects of tPA
on plasma prekallikrein (PPK) activation and the role of PKal on cerebral outcomes in a
murine thrombotic stroke model treated with tPA. We show that tPA increases PKal
activity in vitro in both murine and human plasma, via a factor XII (FXII)–dependent
mechanism. Intravenous administration of tPAincreasedcirculating PKal activityin mice.
In micewiththromboticocclusionofthemiddlecerebralartery,tPAadministrationincreased
brain hemorrhage transformation, infarct volume, and edema. These adverse effects of tPA
were ameliorated in PPK (Klkb1)–deficient and FXII-deficient mice and in wild-type (WT) mice
pretreated with a PKal inhibitor prior to tPA. tPA-induced brain hemisphere reperfusion after
photothrombolicmiddlecerebralarteryocclusionwasincreasedinKlkb12/2micecomparedwithWTmice.Inaddition,PKalinhibitionreduced
matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in brain following stroke and tPA therapy. These data demonstrate that tPA activates PPK in plasma and
PKal inhibition reduces cerebral complications associated with tPA-mediated thrombolysis in stroke. (Blood. 2017;129(16):2280-2290)
Introduction
Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only
approved pharmacological therapy for thrombotic stroke in the acute
phase.1 Although tPA-mediated thrombolysis is the standard of care for
ischemic stroke, the efficacy of this therapeutic approach remains
a challenge and its use is limited by concerns related to increased risk
of hemorrhagic transformation and angioedema, which can worsen
clinical outcomes.2-4 The development of more effective and safer tPA-
mediated thrombolytic therapies for stroke depends on understanding
the effects of tPA beyond its well-established role in fibrinolysis.5-8
Plasmin has been implicated as an activator of the kallikrein-kinin
system (KKS),9 which has multiple roles in vascular functions, he-
mostasis, and thrombosis. The actions of the KKS are mediated by
plasma kallikrein (PKal), a serine protease derived from the abundant
circulating zymogen plasma prekallikrein (PPK). Zymogen activation
by the serine protease factor XIIa (FXIIa) cleaves PPK into disulfide-
linked heavy and light chains of catalytically active PKal, which in turn
cleaves FXII to FXIIa to provide positive feedback amplification of the
KKS. PKal also cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) to
generate bradykinin, which can cause vascular hyperpermeability and
edema. The KKS can also exert prothrombotic effects mediated by the
generation of FXIIa, which activates FXI and the intrinsic coagulation
cascade.10 In addition, we have previously shown that PKal impairs
hemostasis by interfering with collagen-mediated platelet activation,
which contributes to hematoma expansion in an experimental model of
hemorrhagic stroke.11 The role of the KKS on vascular leakage,
inflammation, and thrombosis has been demonstrated in animal models
of acute stroke.12-15 Although the clinical significance of PKal and
bradykinin in stroke and its cerebral complications is not yet available,
these factors have been identified as clinically significant mediators
of vasogenic edema associated with hereditary angioedema.16,17 In
addition, the KKS has been implicated in orolingual angioedema that is
associated with tPA-mediated thrombolysis.18-20
The effects of negatively charged surfaces and macromolecules
on KKS activation are well established.10,21,22 Although, PKal has
been implicated as a plasminogen activator23 and protease-mediated
activation of FXII by plasmin has been reported,9,24 the potential phy-
siological significance of the KKS to outcomes associated with tPA
therapy is not yet available. We hypothesized that tPA may activate
KKS, which could contribute to its adverse effects on intracerebral
hemorrhage and also counteract tPA’s thrombolytic efficacy. This
report investigates the role of PKal in the complications and efficacy of
tPA therapy using a murine thrombotic stroke model.

 Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with photothrombotic
laser model
Adult male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME),PPK
gene-deficient mice (Klkb12/2)11 and FXII gene-deficient mice (FXII2/2) (kindly
provided by Francis J. Castellino, University of Notre Dame) weighing 24 to 28 g
were used in this study. Photothrombotic laser model was produced as described
elsewhere.8 We performed all experiments in accordance with the guidelines of
NationalInstitutesofHealth,GuidefortheCareandUseofLaboratoryAnimals,and
with approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of Joslin Diabetes Center.
tPA administration
Two hours after MCAO, thrombolysis was initiated by jugular vein administration
oftPA(10mg/kg,CathfloActivase;Genentech,SouthSanFrancisco,CA)insaline,
with10%beinggivenasabolusandtheremaining90%infusedat3mL/minover30
minutes. A selective PKal inhibitor BPCCB (1-benzyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic
acid 4-carbamimidoyl-benzylamide)25,26 in 10% PEG400 in saline at doses of 1, 3,
and 10 mg/kg was administered in a total volume of 100 mL, as a 50 mL bolus and
50 mL infused at 2 mL/min over 15 minutes before tPA infusion. Recombinant tPA
(10 mg/kg) was administered at a dose typically used in rodents,8,27-29 which is
higher than the clinical dose of 0.9 mg/kg in humans. The dose 10 mg/kg has been
shown to be more effective than 0.9 mg/kg in mediating thrombolysis in mice.30
Kallikrein-like activity
Citrated plasma was incubated with purified human tPA (0 to 360 nM)
for 10 minutes. Kallikrein-like activity was determined by measurement of
the changes in fluorescence at 410 nm because of hydrolysis of 100 mmol/L

Results
tPA-mediated PKal activation via plasmin and FXII in
human plasma
ToexaminetheeffectoftPAonPKalformationinhumanplasma,purified
human tPA (0 to 360 nM) was incubated with plasma for 10 minutes, and
kallikrein-like activity was measured as the rate of hydrolysis of a PKal
substrate (D-Pro-Phe-Arg-7-Amino-4-Trifluoromethylcoumarin). tPA
induced concentration-dependent increases in kallikrein-like activity
(P , .01 vs vehicle; Figure 1A). The contribution of PKal to tPA-
stimulated kallikrein activity was demonstrated using a selective
PKal inhibitor BPCCB25,26 (Figure 1A, insert) and PPK-deficient
plasma (Figure 1B), which decreased substrate hydrolysis by 83%
and 74%, respectively. To investigate the factors that may contribute
to tPA-mediated PKal activity, we incubated tPA (360 nM) with
normal human plasma and with plasma-depleted in plasminogen or
FXII. We show that plasminogen deficiency and FXII deficiency
decreased tPA-induced kallikrein-like-activity by ;38% (P , .01)
and 74% (P , .001), respectively, compared with kallikrein-like
activity in control plasma incubated with tPA (Figure 1B). We next
examined whether the modulation of KKS by tPA may involve a
direct interaction between tPA or plasmin with PPK or FXII in a
purified protein assay. Incubation of purified human PPK with FXIIa
reduced levels of PPK and generated a band at 50 kDa, which is the
predicted size of PKal heavy chain (Figure 1C). In contrast, PPK
cleavage was not observed following incubations with either plasmin
or tPA. Incubation of purified human FXII with plasmin and PKal
generated fragments at 30 and 29 kDa, respectively (Figure 1D). In
contrast, tPA did not appear to generate lower-molecular-weight
fragments of FXII. In addition, we found that incubation of purified
FXII with plasmin resulted in increased FXIIa activity (Figure 1E).
We next evaluated whether PKal plays a role in clot formation and
lysis induced by thrombin andtissue factor.Turbidimetric analysis of
human plasma incubated with BPCCB (1 and 3 mM) showed that
PKal inhibition decreased clot formation rate induced by thrombin
(1330 6 35 seconds vehicle vs 1633 6 71 seconds BPCCB [3 mM],
P , .05; supplemental Figure 1A-B), whereas in combination with
tPA, BPCCB accelerated the rate of clot lysis when compared with
tPA alone (2302 6 180 seconds vehicle vs 1703 6 111 seconds
BPCCB [3 mM], P , .05; supplemental Figure 1C-D). Moreover, we
show that PPK-deficient human plasma displayed delayed clot forma-
tion induced by thrombin compared with normal plasma (1330 6 35
seconds vehicle vs 2240 6 141 seconds PPK-deficient, P , .01;
supplemental Figure 1A-B). In the tPA-induced clot lysis assay, PPK-
deficient plasma displayed a decreased magnitude of turbidity compare
with normal plasma, suggesting reduced clot formation (supplemental
Figure 1C-D). In contrast, PKal inhibition and PPK deficiency did not
alter clot formation and lysis induced by tissue factor (supplemental
Figure 1E-H).
Effect of tPA on PKal activity in mouse plasma
Next, we examined the effect of tPA on kallikrein-like activity in
mouse plasma. Incubation of WT mouse plasma with tPA in-
duced concentration-dependent increases in kallikrein-like activity
(P , .001 vs WT; Figure 2A). Incubation of tPA with plasma
from PPK-deficient mice (Klkb12/2) showed markedly reduced
kallikrein-like activity compared with WT plasma, confirming that
hydrolysis of the substrate was mainly attributable to PKal (Figure 2A).
Incubation of tPA with plasma from FXII-deficient (FXII2/2) mice
displayed markedly reduced kallikrein-like activity compared with
plasma form WT mice (P , .001; Figure 2B). Because tPA is as-
sociated with increased bradykinin from HK cleavage,31 we
examine whether this cleavage required PPK and FXII. Cleavage
of endogenous HK was measured in plasma samples from WT,
Klkb12/2, and FXII2/2 mice in the presence or absence of tPA
(360 nM). We show that tPA increased HK cleavage at 60 minutes in
WT plasma (P , .05; Figure 2C). In contrast, tPA did not induce
HK cleavage in plasma from either Klkb12/2 or FXII2/2 mice
(Figure 2D-E). Next, we explored the effects of intravenous injection
of tPA in mice on PKal activity in WT and Klkb12/2 mice. tPA was
administered as a bolus (10 mg/kg) via tail vein and blood was
collected at 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after injection. We found that
tPA rapidly increased kallikrein-like activity at 15 minutes (P , .05),
which was sustained for at least 1 hour postinjection (Figure 2F). A
transientincreaseinamidolyticactivitywasalsoobservedinKlkb12/2
mice but to a lesser extent compared with WT mice. Western blot
analysis of plasma from WT mice receiving tPA injection showed a
decrease in PPK (P , .05; 75 kDa) and a concomitant increase in the
PKal heavy chain 50 kDa (P , .05; Figure 2G).
PKal inhibition reduces tPA-mediated brain hemorrhage after
stroke in mice
To examine whether the combination of PKal inhibitor with tPA
influences the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation, we evaluated
hemorrhagevolumeat24hoursafterischemia.InfusionoftPA(10mg/kg)
in mice subjected to stroke resulted in increased brain hemorrhage
when compared with saline-treated mice (3.0 6 0.2 mL WT vs 7.3 6

 Effects of PKal on brain injury from thrombotic stroke in mice
treated with tPA
To examine the role of PKal after thrombolytic therapy with tPA
in acute ischemic stroke, we evaluated the effects of PKal inhibition
on infarct volume in ischemic brain by staining brain sections
with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Figure 4A) 24 hours after MCAO.
Infarct volume at 24 hours after stroke in mice infused with tPA
after MCAO was increased compared with saline (vehicle)–infused
mice at 24 hours after stroke (41.3 6 5.4 mm3 WT vs 71.3 6

with tPA reduced infarct volume in a concentration-dependent

tPA’s effects, we used Klkb12/2 mice. Infarct volumes in untreated
mice were reduced by 32% in Klkb12/2 mice compared with
responses in WT mice (41.3.1 6 5.4 mm3 WT vs 26.7 6 4.4 mm3
Klkb12/2, P , .05; Figure 4B). tPA-treated Klkb12/2 mice showed
a smaller infarct volume when compared with tPA-treated WT mice
(31.5 6 2.5 mm3 Klkb12/2 1 tPA vs 71.3 6 8.3 mm3 WT 1 tPA;

Coadministration of a PKal inhibitor with tPA decreases MMP-9
activation in brain after stroke
Previous reports have shown that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
contributes to hemorrhage in MCAO mice treated with tPA.27
Because PKal inhibition reduced tPA-induced brain hemorrhage,
we investigated whether PKal contributes to MMP-9 activation.
Gelatin-zymography of brain tissue indicated a marked increase in
MMP-9 in mice subjected to MCAO compared with MMP-9 levels
in sham mice (P , .01; Figure 4C-D). We observe increased MMP-9
activity in tPA-treated mice after stroke compared with mice with
stroke receiving saline (P , .05 vs vehicle), and coadministration of
BPCCB (10 mg/kg) with tPA reduced MMP-9 activity induced by
tPA (P , .01 vs tPA; Figure 4C-D).
PKal mediates tPA-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage
To examine whether PKal contributes to tPA-induced BBB dysfunc-
tion during stroke, we examined cerebral vascular permeability in WT
and Klkb12/2 mice subjected to MCAO and tPA with Evans blue dye
(Figure 5A). Mice with PPK deficiency treated withtPA showed a 54%
reduction in Evans blue dye extravasation after MCAO compared with
tPA-treated WT mice (0.098 6 0.012 Klkb12/2 1 tPA vs 0.18 6 0.02

tPA-induced cerebrovascular permeability after stroke. In the absence
of tPA, MCAO-induced Evans blue dye extravasation was reduced by
33%, in Klkb12/2mice compared with WT mice (0.098 6 0.01 WT vs
0.06560.0.1Klkb12/2,P,.05;Figure5B).Furthermore,tPA-treated
WT mice with MCAO showed more severe neurological deficits
compared with mice subjected to MCAO receiving saline (P , .05 vs

tPA-treated Klkb12/2 mice with MCAO compared with tPA-treated
WT mice with MCAO (P , .05 vs WT 1 tPA; Figure 5C). We also

FXII deficiency reduces infarct volume and edema after tPA
treatment in thrombotic stroke without increasing the risk of
intracerebral hemorrhage
Because tPA increases FXII activation through plasmin and results
in PPK activation, we evaluated whether FXII-deficient mice are
protected against brain injury induced by tPA treatment after MCAO.
Images of coronal sections show hemorrhage transformation 24 hours
afterstrokeintPA-treatedWTmicecomparedwithtPA-treatedFXII2/2

Discussion
This report identifies the contact system as a mediator of brain injury
induced by intravenous administration of tPA in mice with thrombotic
MCAO. We show that pharmacological inhibition of PKal or PPK and
FXII deficiency in mice reduces intracerebral hemorrhage, edema,
and infarct volume induced by tPA. The beneficial effects of PPK
deficiency are associated with increased tPA-induced cerebral blood
flow. These findings suggest that coadministration of a PKal or a FXIIa
inhibitor with tPA may provide an opportunity to reduce cerebral
complications and improve efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for
ischemic stroke.
We show that intravenous infusion of tPA in mice increases
circulating kallikrein-like activity. In vitro studies using either
PPK-deficient human or mouse plasma revealed that most, but not
all, of this amidolytic activity is associated with PKal, suggesting
that tPA increases the activity of additional plasma proteases
detected by this assay. Consistent with these findings, we show
that both plasminogen and FXII contribute to tPA-stimulated
kallikrein-like activity in plasma. Studies using purified pro-
teins revealed that plasmin cleaves FXII into a fragment with a
molecular weight at or slightly higher than the expected size of

 FXIIa light chain. We did not observe plasmin-mediated cleavage
of PPK, and tPA did not appear to cleave FXII or PPK, suggesting
that tPA-stimulated kallikrein-like activity is mediated, at least in
part, by plasmin’s effects on FXII. These findings are con-
sistent with previous reports showing that incubation of FXII
with plasmin, both as purified enzymes and in plasma, increases
FXIIa activity.9,24,32,33 Plasmin’s effects on purified FXIIa
activity is markedly increased in the presence of dextran sulfate
and inhibited by e-aminocaprioic acid and FXIIa inhibitory
mAb.24 These reports have suggested that plasmin-mediated
cleavage of FXII increases FXIIa-like activity; however, the
mechanisms that mediate the effects of plasmin on FXIIa activity
are not fully understood. A previous study using N-terminal
sequencing revealed FXII cleavage at both Arg353 and Lys346
following incubation with plasmin.9 Cleavage of FXII at
Arg353 leads to its zymogen activation to FXIIa.9 Although the
consequences of plasmin-mediated cleavage of FXII at Lys346 on
FXIIa-like catalytic activity are not yet available, this cleavage
may cause a conformational change that facilitates its effects as a
KKS activator. This can be seen with dextran sulfate in the action
of FXII without a concomitant clotting reaction.34,35 tPA alone
appears to be sufficient to trigger FXII activity and the contact
system without surface binding or polymeric negative charge.
Therefore, generation of plasmin through tPA treatment pro-
teolytically activates FXII and thereby leads to activation of the
KKS cascade (Figure 7).
Our results showing that tPA increases kallikrein-like activity in
mice in vivo are consistent with clinical findings showing that
infusion of alteplase in patients with an acute myocardial
infarction increases kallikrein activity in plasma.36 Systemic
activation of the KKS by tPA could have both peripheral and
cerebral effects. Peripheral activation of PKal by tPA could
contribute to orolingual angioedema that has been reported to
occur at an incidence of up to 5% of cases during thrombolytic

 therapy and has been attributed to bradykinin.18-20 Recently,
Marcos-Contreras et al demonstrated that tPA infusion after
acute stroke in humans triggers HK cleavage and bradykinin
generation.31 In addition, this report showed that plasmin can
cleave HK in a purified system. Our results demonstrate that HK
cleavage by tPA in plasma requires PPK and FXII, suggesting
that tPA-induced cleavage of HK is mediated by a cascade of
plasmin, FXIIa, and PKal activities. Thus, inhibition of either
PKal or FXIIa may provide opportunities to block off target effects
of tPA on bradykinin production. Regarding the physiological
consequences of this pathway, the main finding in this report is
that PKal activity contributes to cerebral complications associ-
ated with tPA therapy in a murine model of ischemic stroke. We
show that PKal inhibition and PPK deficiency reduce intrace-
rebral hemorrhage, edema, and infarct volume caused by
intravenous administration of tPA after thrombotic MCAO.
The protective effects against brain infarct volume seen in
Klkb1-deficient mice are consistent with previous findings
showing that PPK deficiency reduces brain injury caused by
permanent MCAO.15 On the other hand, treatment with a Pkal
inhibitor after permanent MCAO did not show any neuro-
protective effect as demonstrated by Storini et al.37 The
mechanisms that contribute to this neuroprotection by PKal
blockade are not fully understood and could involve reduced
inflammation and improved vascular perfusion. In addition,
intravenous administration of tPA into FXII-deficient mice after
stroke reduces intracerebral hemorrhage, edema, and infarct
volume. These findings support the concept that activated FXII
activates PKal during tPA treatment in WT mice after stroke. In
agreement with Pham et al,38 FXII-deficient mice were not
protected against infarction in the permanent MCAO model in
the absence of exogenous tPA in our study. We also show that
PKal blockade reduced edema and cerebrovascular permeability
induced by tPA. This is consistent with the well-documented
effects of the KKS in promoting vascular permeability and
vasogenic edema. Most of the edematous effects of the KKS have
been attributed to bradykinin and its metabolite desArg9-
bradykinin, which activate their G protein–coupled receptors,
B2R and B1R, respectively, and thereby increase vascular permeabil-
ity.39 Although the therapeutic benefits of tPA have been demonstrated
for up to 4.5 hours after stroke onset,1 international guideline
recommendations for tPA administration are within 3 hours.40-42 The
risk of hemorrhagic transformation and worse clinical outcomes
increase when tPA is administered beyond this therapeutic interval.
Previous studies have demonstrated that exogenous tPA administra-
tion at 1 to 3 hours after MCAO in mice exerts neurotoxic and
hemorrhagic effects.27,28,43,44 Our data suggest that inhibition of the
contact system may extend the therapeutic time for tPA administration
by reducing its hemorrhagic and neurotoxic effects.
Loss of BBB integrity soon after the onset of stroke is believed
to be a precursor to brain edema and hemorrhagic transforma-
tion.45 MMP-9 has been implicated in tPA-induced cerebral
hemorrhage and BBB disruption in ischemic stroke.6,46,47 We
found that tPA infusion increases Evans blue dye extravasation in
the ischemic hemisphere and PPK deficiency reduced this
leakage. In addition, we also showed that PKal inhibition reversed
the MMP-9 activity caused by tPA treatment. It is well established
that plasmin activates MMP-2 and MMP-9, which consequently
degrades laminin and collagen IV.48 Degradation of extracellular
matrix could disrupt microvascular function and thereby increase
BBB permeability.49,50 We have previously shown that PKal
induces proteolysis of basement membrane and extracellular
matrix proteins including multiple collagen isoforms, laminin
b1 and g1, nidogen 1 and 2, and fibronectin in brain astrocyte
and pericytes.26,51 Moreover, PKal can interfere with collagen-
induced platelet activation leading to intracerebral hematoma
expansion in rodent models.11 These reports have revealed that
PKal has collagen-binding and collagenase-like activities that
might facilitate hemorrhage under certain pathological conditions. In
intracerebral hemorrhage, increased plasma MMP-9 is associated with
intracerebral hemorrhage enlargement52 and perihematoma edema.53
Higher baseline levels of blood MMP-9 are associated with increased
risk of parenchymal hematoma after treatment with intravenous
tPA.54,55 Taken together, these findings suggest that PKal inhibition
duringtPAtherapyinstrokemayreducetheupregulationoftheMMP-9
pathway, which has been implicated in contributing to increased
cerebral vascular permeability, intracerebral hemorrhage, and worse
stroke outcomes.56 However, although MMP-9 contributes acutely to
stroke injury it is also involved in brain plasticity and remodeling during
recovery.57 Thus, reducing the overexpression of MMP-9 rather than
blocking its basal activity may provide protective effects on the BBB.
Interestingly, we have also found that tPA exerted a greater effect
on improving rCBF reperfusion following thrombotic MCAO in
Klkb12/2 mice compared with WT mice. In addition, we show
that coincubation of a PKal inhibitor with tPA increased the
dissolution of clots induced by thrombin in vitro. Combined, these
findings suggest that PKal inhibition may reduce thrombus
stability and/or
increase its
susceptibility
to
tPA-mediated
thrombolysis. These findings are consistent with recent evidence
that PPK deficiency and PKal inhibition reduces arterial thrombosis
induced by FeCl3 in animal models.58,59 Although the KKS appears
to be dispensable for hemostatic mechanisms, inhibition of PKal
may provide an opportunity to reduce cerebrovascular thrombotic
disease without increasing tPA therapy-associated bleeding
complications.60
A major limitation of this study is the use of mice with photo-
thrombotic-induced MCAO as a model for clinical ischemic
stroke. In humans, thrombotic stroke is usually the result of a
thromboembolism, which often occurs in combination with
underlying vascular disease and systemic disorders, such as
diabetes and hypertension. It is unknown how composition of the
thrombus and the mechanisms of intracerebral hemorrhage in this
murine model compare with clinical stroke. In addition, humans
and mice could differ in the relative contribution of coagulation
factors involved in tPA-mediated complications and thrombus

 dissolution. We show that administration of tPA in mice at 2 hours
after stroke increases braininjuryand intracerebral hemorrhage, which
isconsistent withprevious reports.27,28,43However, thistimeisshorter
than the 3 hours therapeutic window in humans. Species differences,
faster metabolism, vascular damage caused by photothrombotic
methodology, and tPA dose may contribute to the more rapid onset
of tPA complications in mice.
In conclusion, the clinical benefits of tPA-mediated thrombolysis
for ischemic stroke are still heavily dependent on time to treatment and
limited by the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. It is imperative that
pharmacological options are identified to reduce the risk of tPA-
associated hemorrhagic transformation and expand the therapeutic
window to enhance thrombolytic efficacy.29 In this report, we provide
data suggesting that coadministration of a PKal inhibitor with tPA may
provide an approach to improve safety and efficacy of tPA-mediated
thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke.
