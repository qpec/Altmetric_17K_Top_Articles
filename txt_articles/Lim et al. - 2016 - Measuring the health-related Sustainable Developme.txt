Measuring the health-related Sustainable Development 
Goals in 188 countries: a baseline analysis from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 SDG Collaborators*
Summary
Background In September, 2015, the UN General Assembly established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 
33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 
(GBD 2015).
Methods We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-
related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst 
observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG 
indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as the 
geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline regressions to examine the relations 
between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a summary measure based on average income per person, educational 
attainment, and total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices. 
Findings In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59∙3 (95% uncertainty interval 56∙8–61∙8) and varied 
widely by country, ranging from 85∙5 (84∙2–86∙5) in Iceland to 20∙4 (15∙4–24∙9) in Central African Republic. SDI was 
a good predictor of the health-related SDG index (r²=0∙88) and the MDG index (r²=0∙92), whereas the non-MDG index 
had a weaker relation with SDI (r²=0∙79). Between 2000 and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median 
of 7∙9 (IQR 5∙0–10∙4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10∙0 [6∙7–13∙1]) exceeded that of the non-
MDG index (a median change of 5∙5 [2∙1–8∙9]). Since 2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met 
need with modern contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the indicator for universal health 
coverage tracer interventions. Moderate improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis 
incidence, minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight considerably worsened.
Interpretation GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring progress towards the health-related 
SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health 
improvement but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be suffi
  cient. Although considerable 
progress on the health-related MDG indicators has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many 
cases, accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or worsening of health-related 
indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for additional resources to eff
 ectively address the expanded scope of 
the health-related SDGs.

Background
In September, 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted 
“Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development”, a resolution outlining a new 
framework to form the cornerstone of the sustainable 
development agenda for the period leading up to 2030.1 
This 
new 
framework 
replaced 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goal (MDG) framework that expired in 2015, 
establishing 17 universal goals and 169 targets referred to 
as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs 
substantially broaden the development agenda beyond the 
MDGs and are expected to frame UN member state 
policies over the next 15 years. To measure progress 
towards achieving the goals, the UN Statistical Commission 
created the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable 
Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) with a 
mandate to draft an indicator framework that aligns with 
the targets. The IAEG-SDGs announced a total of 
230 indicators to measure achievement of the 169 targets.2 
Health is a core dimension of the SDGs; goal 3 aims to 
“ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all 
ages”. Health-related indicators—ie, indicators directly 
pertaining to health services, health outcomes, and 
environmental, occupational, behavioural, or metabolic

risks with well established causal connections to health—
are also present in ten of the other 16 goals.3,4 Across these 
11 goals, there are 28 health-related targets with a total of 
47 health-related indicators.
The SDGs were developed through a highly 
consultative and iterative process that included multiple 
meetings with expert groups, civil society, and 
governments. However, the process of developing the 
SDGs and the accompanying goals, targets, and 
indicators has not been without its critics. In both 
scientifi
 c settings and the news media, the common 
refrain has been that the SDGs are a long list of vague 
goals that lack clear, realistic, and measurable targets 
and indicators,5–11 and that they are not accompanied by a 
clear theory of change12 articulating how the pieces fi
 t 
together.3 In view of the potential importance of the 
SDGs in directing national policies and donor 
investments, there has also been intense debate about 
the selection of targets and indicators;12 despite the 
lengthy list, some think that the SDGs are missing key 
areas of development, ranging from prohibition of 
forced labour13 to improvement of mental health.14–16 
Concerns have also been expressed about the feasibility 
of measuring the 230 proposed indicators.5,6,17 Indeed, 
measurement of countries’ current status and progress 
towards meeting the SDG targets will be an enormous 
task and will require collective action across a range 
of national and international organisations, both 
governmental and non-governmental. The diffi
  culties of 
measurement are also further compounded by persistent 
problems of data availability, quality, and comparability 
across a host of indicators.4,18 Furthermore, measurement 
of development indicators is accompanied by a high 
potential for political entanglement, which can lead to 
distorted estimates.19–22 Independent monitoring of the 
SDG indicators will be crucial if they are to be used to 
accurately evaluate progress to ensure accountability 
and drive national and international development 
agendas towards meeting the SDGs.4,23–26
Despite these concerns, increasing work has been done 
in the past decade to generate independent, comparable, 
valid, and consistent measurements of development 
indicators.27–32 To measure progress on the SDGs, these 
existing eff
 orts will need to be leveraged, particularly 
those that provide comparable assessments of health 
outcomes and risks across countries and over time. The 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD) is a primary example of such an initiative. 
GBD is an open, collaborative, independent study to 
comprehensively measure epidemiological levels and 
trends of disease and risk factor burden worldwide, 
with more than 1870 individual collaborators from 
124 countries and three territories across the full range 
of development. GBD uses a highly standardised 
approach to overcome challenges of inconsistent coding 
and indicator defi
 nitions across countries, missing and 
confl
 icting data, and time lags in measurement and 
estimation. Of the 47 health-related indicators included 
as part of the SDGs, estimates for 33 indicators are 
presently included as part of GBD. The GBD study also 
has several mechanisms to ensure independence, 
including the GBD Scientifi
 c Council that meets 
regularly to review all methods and major data changes, 
and the Independent Advisory Committee that meets 
twice yearly to review GBD progress and provide 
recommendations for strengthening GBD estimates.33
In this analysis, while acknowledging the continued 
debate about the structure, selection, and construction 
of SDG indicators, we used the GBD study to assess the 
current status of these 33 health-related SDG indicators. 
With this baseline assessment, we developed and 
estimated a summary indicator for the health-related 
SDG indicators and documented historical trends for 
this summary indicator. With the GBD results, we 
identifi
 ed countries with the largest improvements 
between 1990 and 2015 to inform roadmaps and provide 
a basis for monitoring the health-related SDG 
indicators.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) in September, 2015, demand to establish independent, 
robust avenues for monitoring progress for the SDGs has 
escalated. However, substantial challenges exist in undertaking 
comprehensive and comparable assessments of health-related 
SDG indicators to monitor and guide development agendas and 
health policy implementation.
Added value of this study
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) features more than 1870 collaborators from 
124 countries and three territories and provides an independent 
analytical platform through which levels of health-related SDG 
indicators can be assessed across geographies and over time in a 
comparable manner. Drawing from GBD, we provide the 
measurement of 33 of the 47 health-related SDG indicators and 
introduce an overall health-related SDG index for 188 countries 
from 1990 to 2015.
Implications of all the available evidence
GBD and its analytical framework allow detailed analyses of 
country-level performance across health-related SDG indicators 
and over time. This information can be used to identify 
high-performing and low-performing countries, inform policy 
decisions, guide resource allocation, and monitor progress 
towards the health-related SDGs. The varied historical progress 
in improving a subset of health-related SDG indicators and 
rising prevalence of risks such as child overweight underscores 
the complex health landscape the world faces in the SDG era.

Methods
Overview of GBD
GBD is an annual eff
 ort to measure the health of 
populations at regional, country, and selected subnational 
levels.33 GBD produces estimates of mortality and 
morbidity by cause, age, sex, and country for the period 
1990 to the most recent year, refl
 ecting all available data 
sources adjusted for bias. GBD also measures many 
health system characteristics, risk factor exposure, and 
mortality and morbidity attributable to these risks. In 
addition to providing highly detailed standardised 
information for many outcomes and risks, various 
summary measures are also computed, including 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life 
expectancy. For the present analysis, we used estimates 
from GBD 2015 to provide a baseline assessment for 
188 countries. Further details on GBD 2015, which covers 
1990–2015, are available elsewhere.34–39
Indicators, defi
 nitions, and measurement approach
We defi
 ned health-related SDG indicators as indicators 
for health services, health outcomes, and environmental, 
occupational, behavioural, and metabolic risks with well 
established causal connections to health. Many of the 
47 health-related SDG indicators selected by the 
IAEG-SDGs are produced as part of GBD. Table 1 
outlines the ten goals, corresponding to 21 health-related 
targets and 33 health-related indicators included in this 
present iteration of GBD. This table also outlines the 
defi
 nition of the indicator used in this analysis; detailed 
descriptions of the estimation methods and data sources 
are given in the methods appendix pp 10–311. For the 
14 health-related indicators that were not included in this 
analysis, their prospects for measurement in future 
iterations of GBD are described in table 2.
Direct outputs of GBD that are health-related SDG 
indicators include mortality disaggregated by age 
(under-5 
and 
neonatal) 
and 
cause 
(maternal, 
cardiovascular 
disease, 
cancer, 
diabetes, 
chronic 
respiratory diseases, road injuries, self-harm, un 
inten-
tion 
al poisonings, exposure to forces of nature, inter-
personal violence, and collective violence and legal 
inter 
vention [ie, deaths due to law enforcement actions, 
irrespective of their legality]), as well as disease incidence 
(HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B) and 
prevalence (neglected tropical diseases). The GBD 
comparative risk assessment includes measurement of 
exposure prevalence included as health-related SDG 
indicators (under-5 stunting, wasting, and overweight; 
tobacco smoking; harmful alcohol use; intimate partner 
violence; 
unsafe 
water, 
sanitation, 
and 
hygiene; 
household air pollution; and ambient particulate matter 
pollution), as well as deaths or disease burden attributable 
to risk factors selected as health-related SDG indicators 
(unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene; household air 
pollution and ambient particulate matter pollution; and 
occupational risks).
Underlying GBD outputs are a range of additional 
health determinants that contribute to the estimation 
of morbidity and mortality, for which data are 
systematically compiled and estimates are produced. 
For example, GBD comprehensively analyses data from 
household surveys on vaccine coverage and combines 
survey estimates with reported administrative data to 
produce time series of vaccine coverage for all countries 
from 1990 to 2015. Estimates of vaccine coverage are 
then included as predictors of vaccine-preventable 
morbidity and mortality in GBD. Additional health 
indicators produced as part of GBD and included as 
health-related SDG indicators in this analysis are: met 
need with modern contraception among women of 
reproductive age, adolescent birth rate, skilled birth 
attendance coverage, and universal health coverage 
(UHC) 
tracer 
interventions. 
For 
UHC 
tracer 
interventions, we developed an index based on the 
geometric mean of the coverage of a set of UHC tracer 
interventions: met need with modern contraception; 
antenatal care (one or more visits and four or more 
visits); skilled birth attendance coverage; in-facility 
delivery rates; vaccination coverage (three doses of 
diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus, measles vaccine, and 
three doses of oral polio vaccine or inactivated polio 
vaccine); tuberculosis case detection rate; coverage of 
antiretroviral therapy for populations living with HIV, 
and coverage of insecticide-treated nets for malaria-
endemic countries. 
For selected indicators proposed by the IAEG-SDGs, 
we made modifi
 cations to the defi
 nition for clarity or on 
the basis of the defi
 nition used in GBD (table 1). For 
example, Indicator 2.2.2 proposes a measure of 
malnutrition that combined prevalence of wasting and 
overweight among children under age 5 years. As 
childhood wasting and overweight have very diff
 erent 
determinants, we opted to report them separately. For 
childhood overweight, we report prevalence in children 
aged 2–4 years, the defi
 nition used in GBD based on 
thresholds set by the International Obesity Task Force.40
Further details on the estimation and data sources 
used for all indicators, compliant with Guidelines for 
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(GATHER),41,42 are included in the methods appendix 
pp 10–311.
Health-related SDG, health-related MDG, and health-
related non-MDG indices
To identify broad patterns and more easily track general 
progress, we developed an overall health-related SDG index 
that is a function of the 33 health-related SDG indicators 
(referred to as the health-related SDG index). We also 
constructed two related indices: one refl
 ecting the SDG 
health-related indicators previously included in the MDG 
monitoring framework (referred to as the MDG index) and 
one refl
 ecting SDG health-related indicators not included 
in the MDGs (referred to as the non-MDG index).

Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture
Target 2.2: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including 
achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on 
stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and

Overweight (2.2.2b)
Prevalence of overweight in

We used the IOTF thresholds because the WHO cutoff
  
at age 5 years can lead to an artifi
 cial shift in prevalence 
estimates when the analysis covers more age groups. 
Furthermore, considerably more studies use IOTF 
cutoff
 s than WHO cutoff
 s, which allowed us to build a 
larger database for estimating child overweight. We 
separated reporting for indicator 2.2.2 into wasting 
(2.2.2a) and overweight (2.2.2b)

Alcohol (3.5.2)
Risk-weighted prevalence of 
alcohol consumption, as 
measured by the SEV for 
alcohol use, % 
We revised this indicator to include six categories of 
alcohol consumption because national alcohol 
consumption per person does not capture the 
distribution of use. The SEV for alcohol use is based 
on two primary dimensions and subcategories of 
each: individual-level drinking (current drinkers, 
lifetime drinkers, lifetime abstainers, and alcohol 
consumption by current drinkers) and drinking 
patterns (binge drinkers and frequency of binge 
drinks). The SEV then weights these categories with 
their corresponding relative risks, which translates 
to a risk-weighted prevalence on a scale of 0% 
(no risk in the population) to 100% (the entire 
population experiences maximum risk associated 
with alcohol consumption)

Diff
 erent types of unsafe water sources have 
diff
 erent relative risks associated with poor health 
outcomes; thus, we revised this indicator to SEV for 
water, which captures the relative risk of diff
 erent 
types of unsafe water sources and then combines 
them into a risk-weighted prevalence on a scale of 
0% (no risk in the population) to 100% (the entire 
population experiences maximum risk associated 
with unsafe water)
MDG
Target 6.2: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable 
sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying 
special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in 
vulnerable situations
Sanitation (6.2.1a)
Risk-weighted prevalence of 
populations using unsafe or 
unimproved sanitation, as 
measured by the SEV for 
unsafe sanitation, %
We separated reporting for indicator 6.2.1 into 
sanitation (6.2.1a) and hygiene (6.2.1b). We had 
three mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive 
categories for sanitation at the household level: 
households with piped sanitation (with a sewer 
connection); households with improved sanitation 
without a sewer connection (pit latrine, ventilated 
improved latrine, pit latrine with slab, or 
composting toilet), as defi
 ned by the JMP; and 
households without improved sanitation (fl
 ush 
toilet that is not piped to sewer or septic tank, pit 
latrine without a slab or open pit, bucket, hanging 
toilet or hanging latrine, shared facilities, or no 
facilities), as defi
 ned by the JMP
MDG
Target 6.2 (as above)
Hygiene (6.2.1b)
Risk-weighted prevalence of 
populations with unsafe 
hygiene (no handwashing 
with soap), as measured by 
the SEV for unsafe hygiene, %
Safe hygiene practices were defi
 ned as handwashing 
with soap and water following toilet use or contact 
with excreta. We separated reporting for indicator 
6.2.1 into sanitation (6.2.1a) and hygiene (6.2.1b)
Non-MDG
Goal 7: Ensure access to aff
 ordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all
Target 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to aff
 ordable, 
reliable, and modern energy services
Household air 
pollution (7.1.2)
Risk-weighted prevalence of 
household air pollution, as 
measured by the SEV for 
household air pollution, %
Existing datasets do not comprehensively measure 
population use of clean fuels and technology for 
heating and lighting across geographies; thus, we 
revised this indicator to focus on exposure to clean 
(or unclean) fuels used for cooking
Non-MDG
Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all
Target 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure 
working environments for all workers, including migrant 
workers, in particular women migrants, and those in 
precarious employment
Occupational risk 
burden (8.8.1)
Age-standardised all-cause 
DALY rate attributable to 
occupational risks, per 
100 000 population
We revised this indicator to the DALY rate 
attributable to occupational risks because DALYs 
combine measures of mortality and non-fatal 
outcomes into a singular summary measure, and 
occupational risks represent the full range of safety 
hazards that could be encountered in working 
environment

Three broad approaches can be used to create 
composite measures: normative, preference weighted, 
and statistical. Normative approaches combine each 
indicator based on fi
 rst principles or an over-riding 
construct such as the contribution of each indicator to 
overall health. Preference-weighted approaches weight 
each indicator by expressed or elicited social preferences 
for the relative importance of diff
 erent indicators. 
Statistical approaches seek to reduce a long set of 
variables or indicators into common components of 
variance using methods such as principal component 
analysis or factor analysis. In this case, because the SDGs 
refl
 ect the collective vision of UN member states, we 
used a preference-weighted approach, assuming that 
each SDG target should be treated equally.
To combine indicators, we adopted methods used to 
construct the Human Development Index,43 which 
include rescaling each indicator on a scale from 0 to 100 
and then combining indicators using the geometric 
mean. The geometric mean allows indicators with very 
high values to partly compensate for low values on other 
indicators (referred to as partial substitutability). In the 
methods appendix pp 312–13, we describe results from 
alternative index construction methods (ie, principal 
component analysis; the arithmetic mean across targets 
referred to as complete substitutability; and the minimum 
value across targets referred to as zero substitutability). 
Quantitative targets for each of the health-related SDG 
indicators are not universally specifi
 ed. As a result, we 
rescaled each health-related SDG indicator on a scale 
from 0 to 100, with 0 being the lowest (worst) value 
observed and 100 being the highest (best) value observed 
over the time period 1990–2015. We log-transformed 
mortality and morbidity before rescaling. We then 
estimated the health-related SDG index by fi
 rst computing 
the geometric mean of each rescaled health-related SDG 
indicator for a given target, followed by the geometric 
mean of resulting values across all SDG targets. To avoid 
problems with indicator values close to 0, when 
computing indices we applied a fl
 oor of one to all 
indicators. This analytic approach weights each of the 
health-related SDG targets equally. In addition to the 
health-related SDG index, we also used the same methods 
to construct an index that represents 14 health-related 
SDG indicators that were previously MDG indicators and 
an index representing 19 non-MDG indicators (table 1). 
Uncertainty in the indicator and indices values was 
computed using a simulation analysis.

Relations between health-related SDG indicators and the 
Socio-demographic Index and healthy life expectancy
As part of GBD 2015, we assessed cause-specifi
 c disease 
burden and risk exposure along the development 
spectrum, providing context on expected changes as 
countries progress to higher levels of income per person, 
higher educational attainment, and lower fertility.34,37–39 
We conducted a similar analysis by examining the 
relations of the overall health-related SDG index and 
each of the individual health-related SDG indicators 
Health-related SDG indicator
Measurement needs and strategy
Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages
Target 3.5: Strengthen the prevention and treatment of 
substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful 
use of alcohol
3.5.1: Coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, 
psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for 
substance use disorders
Prevalence of specifi
 c substance use disorders (opioid use 
disorders, cocaine use disorders, amphetamine use disorders, 
and cannabis use disorders), as well as alcohol use disorders, 
are presently estimated as part of GBD. Systematic reviews on 
coverage of specifi
 c interventions (eg, opioid substitution 
therapy) are in progress by GBD collaborators
Target 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including 
fi
 nancial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care 
services and access to safe, eff
 ective, quality and aff
 ordable 
essential medicines and vaccines for all
3.8.2: Number of people covered by health insurance or a 
public health system per 1000 population
Omission of information on insurance depth and status of user 
fees within the public health system might limit the 
applications of this indicator. Construction of proxy measures 
of health-care use, for both outpatient and hospital care, by 
country and over time is feasible as part of future iterations of 
GBD and is likely to be an improved measurement strategy
Target 3.b: Support the research and development of vaccines 
and medicines for the communicable and non-communicable 
diseases that primarily aff
 ect developing countries, provide 
access to aff
 ordable essential medicines and vaccines, in 
accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement 
and Public Health, which affi
  rms the right of developing 
countries to use to the full the provisions in TRIPS regarding 
fl
 exibilities to protect public health, and, in particular, provide 
access to medicines for all
3.b.1: Proportion of the population with access to aff
 ordable 
medicines and vaccines on a sustainable basis. The 
recommended measure is percentage of health facilities with 
essential medicines and life-saving commodities in stock 
Across all geographies and over time, comparable data on 
the stocking and stock-out rates of essential medicines and 
vaccines for all facility types (hospitals, primary care 
facilities, pharmacies, and other health-care outlets) and 
facility ownership (public, private, informal) are not 
available at present. In the absence of robust measures of 
stock-outs in both the public and private sectors across 
countries and over time, the measurement strategy for 
producing comparable results for this indicator is unclear. 
Furthermore, the proposed indicator stipulates 
measurement of not only access to medicines and vaccines, 
but also access to affordable medicines and vaccines. No 
comprehensive and comparable datasets on the status of 
essential medicine and vaccine affordability, in addition to 
their stocks, presently exist
Target 3.b (as above)
3.b.2: Total net offi
  cial development assistance to the medical 
research and basic health sectors
DAH is currently assessed within a comprehensive, comparable 
analytical framework by source, channel, recipient country, 
and health focus area from 1990 to 2015; however, funding 
specifi
 cally for medical research (eg, research and development 
of vaccines and medicines, as described in Target 3.b) is not 
systematically available across source and recipient countries. 
Additionally, the appropriate assessment of country-level 
performance remains unclear (eg, whether countries that 
receive high levels of DAH for medical research are equivalent, 
in terms of indicator performance, to countries that disperse 
high levels of DAH for medical research)
Target 3.c: Substantially increase health fi
 nancing and the 
recruitment, development, training and retention of the 
health workforce in developing countries, especially in least 
developed countries and small island developing States
3.c.1: Health worker density and distribution, as measured by 
number of health workers per 1000 population by cadre. 
Cadres include generalist medical practitioners, specialist 
medical practitioners (surgeons, anaesthetists, 
obstetricians, emergency medicine specialists, cardiologists, 
paediatricians, psychiatrists, ophthalmologists, 
gynaecologists, etc), nursing and midwifery professionals, 
and traditional and complementary medicine professionals, 
among others
A systematic analysis of population census data and Labour 
Force Surveys is possible as part of future iterations of GBD. 
The total quantity of individual health worker cadres that 
could be comparably assessed by geography by year will be a 
function of the availability of detailed International Labour 
Organization occupational codes across geographies and 
survey iteration
Target 3.d: Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in 
particular developing countries, for early warning, risk 
reduction and management of national and global health risks
3.d.1: International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity and 
health emergency preparedness. The WHO-recommended 
measure is the percentage of 13 core capacities that have 
been attained at a specifi
 c time (IHR core capacity index). 
The 13 core capacities are (1) national legislation, policy, and 
fi
 nancing; (2) coordination and national focal point 
communications; (3) surveillance; (4) response; 
(5) preparedness; (6) risk communication; (7) human 
resources; (8) laboratory; (9) points of entry; (10) zoonotic 
events; (11) food safety; (12) chemical events; and 
(13) radionuclear emergencies
Comprehensive and comparable data for all components of 
the IHR core capacity index, for all geographies and over time, 
are not available at present. Specifi
 c core capacities, such as 
zoonotic events, could be assessed as part of future iterations 
of GBD; other core capacities, such as coordination and 
national focal point communications, have no clear 
measurement strategy beyond self-report from country 
representatives or secondary research on policy status and 
types of surveillance systems available, among others

with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary 
measure of development that uses lag-distributed 
income per person, average educational attainment in 
the population over age 15 years, and the total fertility 
rate. The SDI was constructed using the same method 
for the Human Development Index and the health-related 
SDG index. Each of the three components was fi

Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
Target 5.2: Eliminate all forms of violence against all women 
and girls in the public and private spheres, including traffi
  cking 
and sexual and other types of exploitation
5.2.2: Proportion of women and girls aged 15 years and older 
subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate 
partner in the previous 12 months, by age and place of 
occurrence
Prevalence of intimate partner violence among women and 
girls aged 15 years and older is currently estimated as part of 
GBD. An updated systematic review of the literature, data 
re-extraction, and analysis are needed to specifi
 cally quantify 
prevalence of sexual violence (separately or in addition to 
physical violence, or both) and by persons other than an 
intimate partner. Data availability by geography by year on the 
latter, sexual violence by persons other than intimate partners, 
might be limited
Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive 
health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with 
the Programme of Action of the International Conference on 
Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for 
Action and the outcome documents of their review 
conferences
5.6.1: Proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their 
own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, 
contraceptive use, and reproductive health care
The proportion of women who make their own informed 
decisions regarding all three dimensions of this indicator—
sexual relations, contraceptive use, and reproductive health 
care—are included in the Demographic and Health Survey 
(DHS) series. Data availablility for non-DHS countries is 
unclear. The feasibility of measuring this indicator as part of 
future iterations of GBD is under review at present
Target 5.6 (as above)
5.6.2: Number of countries with laws and regulations that 
guarantee women aged 15–49 access to sexual and 
reproductive health care, information, and education
Across all geographies and over time, comprehensive and 
comparable data documenting the status of laws and 
regulations regarding access to sexual and reproductive health 
care, information, and education do not exist at present. 
Compiling the past and current status of such laws and 
regulations might be possible; however, systematic 
assessment of their depth or intensity, enforcement, and 
eff
 ectiveness in guaranteeing access to reproductive health 
care, information, and education might be challenging across 
countries and over time
Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Target 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing 
pollution, eliminating dumping and minimising release of 
hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of 
untreated waste water, and substantially increasing recycling 
and safe reuse globally
6.3.1: Proportion of waste water safely treated. 
UN Water defi
 nes this indicator as the proportion of waste 
water generated by both households (sewage and faecal 
sludge), as well as economic activities (based on ISIC 
categories) safely treated compared to total waste water 
generated both through households and economic activities. 
While the defi
 nition conceptually includes waste water 
generated from all economic activities, monitoring will focus 
on waste water generated from hazardous industries 
(as defi
 ned by relevant ISIC categories)
Across all geographies and over time, comprehensive and 
comparable data containing information on total waste water, 
as generated by both households and non-household entities 
(however they are to be defi
 ned), and waste water treatment 
status do not exist at present. UN Water suggests there will be 
suffi
  cient data to generate estimates of global and regional 
levels of safely treated waste water by 2018; however, in the 
absence of more country-level data, it is diffi
  cult to determine 
the representativeness of such global and regional estimates
Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build eff
 ective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels
Target 16.1: Signifi
 cantly reduce all forms of violence and 
related death rates everywhere
16.1.3: Proportion of population subjected to physical, 
psychological, or sexual violence in the previous 12 months
Prevalence of intimate partner violence among women and 
girls aged 15 years and older is currently estimated as part of 
GBD, as are the incidence and prevalence of interpersonal 
violence among all populations. An expanded systematic 
review of the literature and available data sources for all types 
of violence (physical, psychological, and sexual) for both men 
and women of all ages would be required for inclusion in 
future iterations of GBD
Target 16.1 (as above)
16.1.4: Proportion of people that feel safe walking alone 
around the area they live
Comprehensive data on reported safety, in general or walking 
alone near one’s residence (or both), do not currently exist 
across geographies or over time. Substantive primary data 
collection is likely to be required
Target 16.2: End abuse, exploitations, traffi
  cking and all forms 
of violence against and torture of children
16.2.3: Proportion of young women and men aged 
18–29 years who experienced sexual violence by age 18
Prevalence of intimate partner violence among women and 
girls aged 15 years and older is estimated as part of GBD. 
An expanded systematic review and analysis of the literature 
and available data sources for both men and women, and for all 
types of sexual violence (ie, not limited to intimate partners) 
would be required. The feasibility of measuring this indicator as 
part of future iterations of GBD is under review at present

value observed in the time period 1980–2015 and 1 being 
the highest (best) value observed. SDI was then 
computed as the geometric mean of these three rescaled 
components. To capture average relations, we used a 
spline regression (ie, piecewise linear regression with 
so-called knots specifying the intersection between 
pieces) of the health-related SDG indicators and 
health-related SDG index on SDI using the full set of 
data by country from 1990 to 2015. We also compared the 
health-related SDG indicators with the GBD 2015 
estimates of healthy life expectancy38 to explore the 
relation between the SDGs and overall health 
achievement for each country.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had fi
 nal responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Of the 33 health-related SDG indicators, 21 were 
associated with a defi
 ned target, with 18 of them having 
an absolute level and three having a target relative to 
2015 levels (table 3). The proportion of countries already 
meeting targets linked to health-related SDG indicators 
in 2015, as specifi
 ed by absolute levels to be achieved, 
ranged from more than 60% for two indicators 
(maternal mortality ratio and under-5 mortality) to 0% 
for nine  indicators. For these nine indicators, all targets 
involved full elimination of diseases (eg, tuberculosis, 
HIV, and neglected tropical diseases), reducing 
prevalence of health outcomes or risk to 0% (eg, 
childhood overweight and intimate partner violence), 
or reaching 100% for intervention coverage or health 
service provision (eg, skilled birth attendance, met 
need with modern contraception, and UHC tracer 
interventions).
In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 
59∙3 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 56∙8–61∙8) across 
all 188 countries. This index was highest in Iceland 
(85∙5, 84∙2–86∙5), Singapore (85∙3, 84∙1–86∙3), and 
Sweden (85∙3, 84∙2–86∙2) and lowest in the Central 
African Republic (20∙4, 15∙9–24∙9), Somalia (21∙6, 
16∙0–25∙9), and South Sudan (22∙5, 15∙5–26∙6; 
fi
 gure 1). Diff
 erences in the 95% UI range stem largely 
from diff
 erences in the availability and quality of 
underlying data sources for estimating individual 
indicators; for example, data were sparser for Somalia 
than they were for Sweden. Some patterns emerged 
contrary to what might have been expected. For 
example, the USA (74∙9, 73∙6–75∙9) ranked 28th, 
driven by poorer performance on MDG indicators (eg, 
maternal mortality ratio) than other high-income 
countries44 and worse performance on non-MDG 
indicators—most 
notably, 
alcohol 
consumption, 
childhood overweight, and mortality due to inter-
personal 
violence, 
self-harm, 
and 
unintentional 
poisoning. India (41∙7, 39∙7–43∙7), despite rapid 
economic growth, was ranked 143rd, just below 
Comoros and Ghana.
Levels of the health-related SDG index were highly 
clustered (fi
 gure 2), with countries in the highest 
quintile (≥71·5) located mainly in western Europe, 
high-income North America, parts of Asia (Japan, 
South Korea, Singapore, and Brunei), and Australasia. 
The second highest quintile (62·5–71·5) included 
countries in southern Latin America, parts of eastern 
Europe, most of the Caribbean, and a subset of 
countries across other regions (eg, Mexico, Jordan, 
Azerbaijan, Malaysia, and Costa Rica), whereas 
countries in the middle quintile (55·7–62·5) were 
primarily located in South America; parts of east, 
central, and southeast Asia; and parts of North Africa 
and the Middle East. The countries in the fourth 
quintile (37·8–55·7) were mainly found in south and 
southeast Asia, southern sub-Saharan Africa, parts of

Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development
Target 17.19: By 2030, build on existing initiatives to develop 
measurements of progress on sustainable development that 
complement gross domestic product, and support statistical 
capacity building in developing countries
17.19.2: Proportion of countries that (a) have conducted at 
least one population and housing census in the last 10 years; 
and (b) have achieved 100% birth registration and 80% death 
registration
For Indicator 17.19.2(a), a comprehensive assessment of the 
availability and timing of population and housing censuses 
across all geographies is possible as part of GBD. 
For Indicator 17.19.2(b), the systematic collation of vital 
registration data for all geographies is required; at present, 
vital registration data reported to WHO do not fully cover all 
geographies or years under analysis. Such data collation eff
 orts 
would be required for both birth and death registration 
individually to determine completeness, with the latter viewed 
as more immediately feasible for future iterations of GBD

North Africa and the Middle East, and parts of eastern 
Europe. Countries in western, eastern, and central 
sub-Saharan Africa, as well as a subset of other 
countries (eg, Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea, Yemen, 
and Nepal), dominated the lowest quintile (<37·8) of 
the health-related SDG index. Although the MDG index 
was correlated with the non-MDG index, country-level 
performance on these two indices varied considerably 
(fi
 gure 3). Performing well on the health-related MDG 
index did not guarantee good performance on the 
health-related non-MDG index. For example, the 
health-related MDG index in 2015 was similar for 
Indonesia (52∙3, 49∙8–54∙6) and South Africa (48∙9, 
46∙0–51∙3), but Indonesia had a much higher 
non-MDG index (64∙1, 62∙0–66∙6) than that of 
South Africa (42∙9, 40∙3–45∙5). This diff
 erence for the 
non-MDG index was primarily driven by South Africa’s 
lower performance for indicators such as childhood 
overweight, harmful alcohol use, and mortality due to 
self-harm and interpersonal violence.
SDI was highly predictive of the overall health-related 
SDG index (r²=0∙88) and MDG index (r²=0∙92; fi
 gure 4). 
The non-MDG index was less well predicted by SDI 
(r²=0∙79). This fi
 nding is refl
 ective of the variable 
relations 
between 
individual 
health-related 
SDG 
indicators and SDI (results appendix pp 346–47). For 
instance, SDI was a poor predictor of mortality due to 
exposure to forces of nature, self-harm, interpersonal 
violence, and war (collective violence and legal 
intervention), as well as childhood overweight, intimate 
partner violence, and ambient particulate matter 
pollution. By contrast, SDI was highly predictive of 
maternal mortality ratio, under-5 mortality, and neonatal 
mortality, as well as mortality attributable to unsafe 
water, sanitation, and hygiene. Notably, the overall 
health-related SDG index also had a strong relation with 
healthy life expectancy (r²=0∙86), a summary measure of 
population health.
By subtracting expected levels for the health-related 
SDG index, on the basis of SDI alone, from observed 
levels (fi
 gure 5), we could identify potential geographical 
deviations well above or below expected values on the 
health-related SDG index. Countries that represent 
substantial deviations from the average might warrant 
further investigation to understand how and why they 
are underperforming or overperforming relative to the 
average. This deviation might be due, for example, to 
more or less effi
  cient use of resources to improve health. 
Many countries in western Europe, Latin America, and 
parts of east and southeast Asia, as well as other countries 
such as Australia, recorded health-related SDG index 
levels that were higher than expected on the basis of SDI 
alone. Many of the countries with a health-related SDG 
index below expected levels on the basis of SDI were 
located in southern and central sub-Saharan Africa, 
eastern Europe and central Asia (eg, Belarus and 
Ukraine), North Africa and the Middle East, south Asia, 
and selected countries such as the USA.
To provide a preliminary indication of potential 
trajectories in the next 15 years, we assessed absolute 
changes in the past 15 years for each of the 
33 health-related SDG indicators and three summary 
indices (overall health-related SDG index, health-related 
MDG index, and non-MDG index). Overall, health-
related SDG indicators largely improved since 2000, as 
summarised by the health-related SDG index; notably, 
gains in the health-related MDG index generally 
exceeded improvements in the non-MDG index 
(fi
 gure 6). Across countries, the most pronounced 
progress occurred for UHC tracer interventions, met 
need with modern contraception, hygiene, under-5 
mortality, and neonatal mortality. Such striking gains 
for the indicator on UHC tracer interventions refl
 ected 
the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy and coverage of 
insecticide-treated nets in malaria-endemic countries 
since the early 2000s.31,44,45 Of note, the relatively small

improvement for the indicator on malaria incidence 
represents the large number of malaria-free countries 
in both 2000 and 2015.46 Health-related indicators 
covered by Target 3.3—which aims to end the epidemics 
of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical 
diseases, and to “combat hepatitis” by 2030—generally 
saw moderate progress (median absolute change of 2∙7 
[IQR –0∙2 to 4∙6] for HIV incidence and 3∙9 
[IQR 1∙7 to 5∙7] for tuberculosis incidence), although 
minimal changes occurred for hepatitis B incidence 
(–0∙2 [–0∙4 to –0∙05]). In combination, these trends 
highlight the need for accelerated progress in order to 
meet Target 3.3. Substantial improvements occurred for 
childhood stunting (8∙2 [3∙5 to 14∙2]) and, to a more 
modest extent, wasting (2∙7 [0∙0 to 6∙0]), yet childhood 
overweight considerably worsened in the past 15 years 
(–4∙5 [–9∙2 to –0∙7]). This trend occurred across SDI 
quintiles, emphasising the need for concerted policy 
attention to reverse this trend. Alcohol consumption 
worsened slightly in the past 15 years as well 
(–0∙4 [–2∙3 to 0∙7]).
Between 2000 and 2015, distinct patterns for absolute 
changes in health-related SDG indicators surfaced 
across SDI quintiles (fi
 gure 6). While the indicator for 
UHC tracer interventions improved across all SDI 
quintiles, the most pronounced gains occurred in 
low-SDI and low-middle-SDI countries. Childhood 
stunting and wasting also improved at a faster pace for 
the low-SDI quintile than for other quintiles. Notably, 
mortality measures from the MDG agenda—maternal 
mortality ratio, under-5 mortality, and neonatal 
mortality—progressed at a similar pace across SDI 
quintiles. By contrast, mortality due to road injuries, 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and interpersonal

Countries are ranked by their health-related SDG index from highest to lowest. Indicators have been scaled from 0 to 100. Defi
 nitions of health-related SDG indicators are shown in table 1. 
SDG=Sustainable Development Goal. MDG=Millennium Development Goal. MMR=maternal mortality ratio. SBA=skilled birth attendance. Mort=mortality. NN mort=neonatal mortality. NTDs=neglected 
tropical diseases. NCDs=non-communicable diseases. FP need met, mod=family planning  need met, modern contraception. Adol=adolescent. UHC=universal health coverage. 
Air poll mort=mortality attributable to air pollution. WaSH=water, sanitation, and hygiene. IPV=intimate partner violence. HH air poll=household air pollution. Occ risk burden=burden attributable to 
occupational risks. PM2·5=fi
 ne particulate matter smaller than 2·5 μm.

violence declined faster in the higher-SDI quintiles 
than in the lower-SDI quintiles. Prevalence of smoking 
also had the largest reductions in countries in the 
high-SDI quintile.
Between 2000 and 2015, progress on the health-related 
SDG index (fi
 gure 7), as well as on individual 
health-related SDG indicators and on the MDG and 
non-MDG indices (results appendix p 6), was highly 
heterogeneous across geographies. Since 2000, the 
largest absolute improve 
ments in the health-related SDG 
index occurred in Timor-Leste (18∙5, 95% UI 16∙2–20∙8), 
Bhutan 
(16∙2, 
13∙6–18∙7), 
and 
Colombia 
(15∙6, 
14∙1–16∙8), whereas three countries—Libya, Syria, and 
Chile—experienced signifi
 cant declines. Declines for the 
next two countries (Brunei and South Sudan) were 
between 0 and –0∧5 and rounded to 0 in fi
 gure 7
. 
Countries with the most pronounced gains for the 
health-related SDG index were found mainly in east, 
southeast, and central Asia, as well as parts of 
Latin America (eg, Venezuela and Honduras). Several 
countries 
in 
sub-Saharan 
Africa 
also 
recorded 
considerable gains in the health-related SDG index, 
including Rwanda, Ethiopia, Ghana, Namibia, and 
Angola.
To demonstrate the usefulness of these estimates for 
informing progress towards the SDGs, we also identifi
 ed 
the geographies with the largest improvement in overall 
health-related SDG index between 2000 and 2015, 
stratifi
 ed by SDI quintile classifi
 cation in 2000. The 
fi
 ve geographies were: Timor-Leste in the low-SDI 
quintile, Tajikistan in the low-middle-SDI quintile, 
Colombia in the middle-SDI quintile, Taiwan (province 
of China) in the middle-high-SDI quintile, and Iceland in 
the high-SDI quintile. Based on their gains for 
the health-related SDG index, these geographies could 
serve as case studies for understanding potential drivers 
of progress on the SDGs.
In Timor-Leste, changes in the health-related SDG 
index were largely driven by improvements in UHC 
tracer interventions, skilled birth attendance, met need 
with modern contraception, under-5 and neonatal 
mortality, childhood stunting, risk exposure to unsafe 
water and sanitation, and mortality from war or confl
 ict. 
This overall improvement was despite worsening 
measures for childhood overweight, smoking pre-
valence, and alcohol use since 2000. Tajikistan recorded 
sizeable improvements across various health-related 
SDG indicators. Among indicators related to the MDGs, 
these included both measures of child mortality, 
childhood 
stunting, 
coverage 
of 
UHC 
tracer 
interventions, malaria incidence, and exposure to 
household air pollution. Improvements were also noted

in mortality due to NCDs, interpersonal violence, and 
war or confl
 ict, as well as mortality attributable to unsafe 
water, sanitation, and hygiene and to air pollution. 
However, several indicators either had minimal progress 
or worsened in Tajikistan, particularly childhood 
overweight and intimate partner violence. Colombia’s 
most pronounced improvements since 2000 occurred 
for many of the non-MDG indicators, which included 
smoking prevalence and mortality rates due to NCDs, 
road injuries, interpersonal violence, and war. Sizeable 
improvements were also recorded for a subset of 
health-related MDG indicators—namely, coverage of 
UHC tracer interventions, adolescent birth rates, met 
need with modern contraception, and unsafe sanitation.

Nonetheless, similar to other countries, Colombia had 
minimal progress in or worsened levels of alcohol 
consumption and hepatitis B incidence. In Taiwan, 
marked gains occurred for a subset of health-related 
SDG indicators previously associated with the MDG 
agenda (eg, adolescent birth rates and coverage of 
UHC tracer interventions); in parallel, Taiwan had 
considerable improvements for many non-MDG 
indicators, such as smoking prevalence and mortality 
due to NCDs, interpersonal violence, and road injuries. 
However, HIV and hepatitis B incidence worsened in 
Taiwan since 2000, and minimal progress occurred for 
ambient particulate matter pollution and several 
maternal and child health indicators. For Iceland, its 
progress on the health-related SDG health index was 
primarily driven by improvements in mortality due to 
NCDs and road injuries, smoking prevalence, adolescent 
birth rates, and both measures of child mortality. 
Similar to other countries, particularly those in the 
high-middle-SDI and high-SDI quintiles, Iceland had 
little progress in childhood overweight and worsening 
levels of alcohol consumption.
Further results are provided in the results appendix, 
and dynamic visualisations are available online.

Discussion
Summary of fi
 ndings and implications
The ambitious SDG agenda is accompanied by 
numerous goals, targets, and indicators for tracking 
progress. Leading up to and following the UN SDG 
resolution1 in September, 2015, considerable debate 
surrounded the selection of indicators, including 
scepticism about the feasibility of their measurement.5,6 
In this study, we produced independent, highly 
standardised, and comparable estimates of 33 of the 
47 health-related SDG indicators across 188 countries. To 
facilitate overall tracking, we also distilled these 
33 health-related indicators into a health-related SDG 
index. Our fi
 ndings show the wide range in this 
health-related SDG index in 2015, from 20∙4 in Central 
African Republic to 85∙5 in Iceland. Our historical 
analysis of these indicators also shows that progress can 
be achieved. Notable improvements were recorded for 
several health-related SDG indicators, particularly those 
that were also MDG indicators, such as under-5 
mortality, met need with modern contraception, and 
childhood stunting. An index of the 14 MDG indicators 
that were included in the health-related SDG indicators 
had a median absolute change of 10∙0 from 2000 to 
2015, and larger reductions were generally found for 
countries at the lower end of the development spectrum. 
Our analysis also highlights the challenges associated 
with the expanded scope of the SDGs, with several of the 
non-MDG indicators having minimal improvements 
(eg, hepatitis B incidence) or worsening (eg, childhood 
overweight) between 2000 and 2015. This fi
 nding is 
further supported by the highly variable relation between 
the health-related MDG index and the health-related 
non-MDG index—good performance on the MDG index 
did not guarantee good performance on the non-MDG 
index. The overall health-related SDG index was well 
predicted by SDI; however, SDI was a variable predictor 
of the performance of individual health-related SDG 
indicators, particularly indicators that were not in the 
MDG agenda. Drawing from GBD, these fi
 ndings 
provide a strong, comparable basis for monitoring the 
SDGs; furthermore, the independent nature of these 
results can enable accountability mechanisms for the 
multiple national and international, governmental, and 
non-governmental actors that must achieve progress on 
the SDGs.

These estimates also allow the identifi
 cation of places 
that have made substantial progress on the health-related 
SDG indicators. These fi
 ndings stand to strengthen the 
global evidence base of lessons learned for accelerating 
improvements 
in 
the 
health-related 
SDGs. 
The 
fi
 ve geographies with the greatest improvement in the 
health-related SDG index between 2000 and 2015, 
stratifi
 ed by SDI quintiles (Timor-Leste, Tajikistan, 
Colombia, Taiwan, and Iceland), have implemented a 
range of policies and interventions that might have 
contributed to their progress.
For instance, following acute confl
 ict and violence 
during the late 1990s, Timor-Leste, in concert with 
the World Bank and other development partners, 
implemented a series of health sector rehabilitation and 
development projects in 2000 and 2001 to re-establish 
the country’s health system and improve health service 
delivery to the poor.47,48 In more recent years, health-care 
reform and fi
 nancing have topped policy agendas in 
Timor-Leste,49 including the Ministry of Health’s roll-out 
of a Basic Health Services Package and Hospital Services 
Package in 2007 under the pursuit of achieving UHC.50 
Following almost a decade of civil confl
 ict that severely 
disrupted health service provision, Tajikistan launched a 
series of health reforms beginning in the late 1990s51 and 
introduced a new benefi
 ts package for guaranteed health 
services in 2007
.52 Moreover, after the civil war, the Tajik 
Government refocused policy attention for initiatives 
on particular diseases such as malaria;53 indeed, the 
country’s multipronged malaria programme, which 
emphasises 
strong 
surveillance 
and 
cross-border 
activities with Afghanistan,54 has now brought Tajikistan 
close to eliminating the disease. Colombia, which 
experienced ongoing confl
 ict and violence from the late 
1980s to 2003,55 is globally recognised for its expansion 
of health insurance and services, especially to the poor. 
While Colombia’s health system reforms began well 
before 2000 (the country approved its universal health 
insurance scheme in 1993),56 coverage increased 
substantially over time, as have the types of services 
covered by its insurance scheme (eg, cancer care).57 
During the mid-1990s, Taiwan adopted a universal

health insurance system,58 which is viewed as one of its 
most successful public entities. Taiwan also enacted 
many road safety laws between the mid-1990s and 
early 2000s, including mandatory helmet laws for 
motorcyclists in 1996 and an extension of seat belt laws 
to general roads in 2001.59 Iceland’s tobacco control 
policies have been viewed as some of the world’s most 
comprehensive,60 and the country’s long-standing 
publicly funded health system provides UHC,61 a factor 
that might have contributed to its declines in 
NCD mortality.
Such progress also highlights important interactions 
between development goals and wider contextual factors, 
such as post-confl
 ict experiences in Timor-Leste, 
Tajikistan, and Colombia, as well as a rebound in health 
following the dissolution of Soviet rule for Tajikistan. 
Furthermore, Taiwan’s gains underscore the interplay 
between advancing economic development and deliberate 
investments in improving UHC. These vignettes 
highlight only a fraction of the possible learning for 
informing action towards improving the health-related 
SDGs. An important future area of work will be to 
understand in detail how these and other high-performing 
geographies have achieved substantial improvements in 
key SDG indicators.
Besides showing the feasibility and value of measuring 
many of the health-related SDGs, our fi
 ndings also 
affi
  rm concerns voiced during the SDG development 
process and following the UN resolution. One criticism 
of the SDGs was the incredibly ambitious nature of 
some of the targets,5 such as Target 3.3, which calls for 
the end of the epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis, and 
malaria by 2030. Our analysis of these indicators in the 
past 15 years suggests that a substantial change in the 
present trajectory of HIV and tuberculosis incidence 
will be needed to meet this target, and major 
technological leaps coupled with universal delivery are 
likely to be necessary. The vague nature of many of the 
SDG targets has also been a common criticism;4,8,10,62 Of 
the 33 health-related SDG indicators in our study, we 
identifi
 ed specifi
 c targets for only 21 of them. The 
absence of specifi
 c and attainable targets for SDG 
indicators, health related or otherwise, undermines the 
usefulness of the SDGs in driving development 
agendas, a limitation that can and should be addressed 
at this early stage of the SDG period.
Our analysis also represents a step towards producing 
a more cohesive understanding of the interactions 
between diff
 erent SDG goals, targets, and indicators— 
a widely noted criticism.3,4 We show the potential for 
quantifying these interactions by comparing the 
relations between education, income, and fertility—
components of the SDI—and the 33 health-related SDG 
indicators and accompanying health-related SDG, 
MDG, and non-MDG indices. Although we acknowledge 
the ecological nature of this analysis and its usual 
caveats, SDI was a strong predictor of the overall 
health-related SDG and MDG indices, highlighting the 
general importance of income, education, and fertility, 
as well as intersectoral action for health-related 
development. However, SDI was a weaker predictor of 
the non-MDG index, particularly for indicators such as 
violence (intimate partner, interpersonal, and collective 
violence) and ambient particulate matter pollution. This 
fi
 nding shows that a sole focus on increasing income 
and education and decreasing fertility is probably 
insuffi
  cient to meet the SDG targets. It also raises 
questions about whether other common drivers, 
analogous to income, education, and fertility, can be 
determined and their relations with SDG indicators 
assessed. Combining this initial assessment of the 
33 health-related SDG indicators with an expanded 
quantifi
 cation and analysis of other potential drivers is 
an important future area of work that could help to 
create a more concise, cohesive, and actionable 
monitoring framework for the SDGs.
Future directions for GBD monitoring eff
 orts
In this report, we focused on measuring indicators 
proposed by the IAEG-SDGs. In future years, we plan to 
address three related sets of issues: fi
 rst, improved 
assessment of the health-related SDG indicators 
measured at present; second, inclusion of the 14 currently 
excluded health-related indicators in the annualised 
GBD study; and third, potential expansion of indicators 
consistent with the framing of the targets. We address 
each of these issues in turn.
Improving the measurement of currently included 
health-related indicators
With the present analysis, we made several modifi
 cations 
that we believe improve several health-related indicators 
for the purposes of measuring progress towards each 
health-related SDG target. Future iterations are likely to 
incorporate further modifi
 cations to these and other 
indicators. First, as noted in the Methods section, rather 
than reporting on the combined prevalence of childhood 
wasting and overweight, we assessed and measured 
them separately. Our results support this decision, since 
they had divergent relations over time (ie, childhood 
wasting improved for most countries, whereas the 
prevalence of childhood overweight generally increased) 
and with SDI (ie, childhood wasting and overweight 
were negatively and positively correlated with SDI, 
respectively).
Second, the IAEG-SDGs’ proposed indicator for 
harmful use of alcohol is the average national-level 
consumption per person in litres of pure alcohol. The 
health and non-health risks associated with harmful 
alcohol use are a function of not only average 
consumption at the population level but also use patterns 
(ie, amount consumed at a given time and frequency of 
consumption). For this analysis, we reported on the 
summary exposure value of harmful alcohol use, which 
 Articles
1838 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 388   October 8, 2016
takes into account the distribution of consumption and 
the prevalence of binge drinking.39
Third, we made two modifi
 cations to the measurement 
of disaster (Indicators 1.5.1, 11.5.1, and 13.1.2). For 
mortality attributable to disasters, we chose to report on 
the lagged 5 year average of disaster mortality. One of the 
corresponding health-related SDG targets (Target 1.5) is 
to “build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable 
situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to 
climate-related extreme events and other economic, 
social and environmental shocks and disasters”. Focusing 
solely on the observed mortality caused by natural 
disaster ignores the role of chance in the occurrence of 
natural disasters; for example, nations with weak 
resilience to natural disasters might not experience a 
natural disaster during a given period of time, whereas 
those with strong resilience might encounter them more 
frequently. Taking the moving average of disaster 
mortality lessens the contribution of chance in assessing 
progress for this indicator. Nonetheless, this adjustment 
cannot account for background risk of natural disasters, 
which varies by geography, and future research eff
 orts 
could include developing a risk-standardised version of 
the indicator. For natural disasters, data on missing 
people and people aff
 ected by disaster are not readily 
available across countries and over time.
Fourth, for occupational health (Indicator 8.8.1), we 
reported on age-standardised all-cause DALY rate 
attributable to occupational risks rather than the 
suggested indicator, which is limited to fatal and non-fatal 
occupational injuries. This revision captures a wider set 
of occupational risks instead of only those that result in 
injuries, which supports the stated target of promotion of 
“safe and secure working environments for all workers” 
(Target 
8.8). 
Fifth, 
for 
tobacco 
use 
prevalence 
(Indicator 3.a.1), GBD does not presently assess 
smokeless tobacco use. Furthermore, smokeless tobacco 
use has a notably diff
 erent risk profi
 le to smoked tobacco 
use,63 and thus it might warrant a subindicator akin to 
childhood malnutrition. Sixth, for clean fuels and 
technology (Indicator 7
.1.2), we presently use a more 
limited defi
 nition that covers fuels used primarily 
for 
household 
cooking. 
Seventh, 
for 
homicide 
(Indicator 16.1.1), GBD does not measure this indicator 
by displacement or migratory status, and similarly for 
confl
 ict-related deaths (Indicator 16.1.2), we do not 
measure deaths by displacement status or by more 
specifi
 ed causes.
Eighth, data gaps also account for limitations in the 
estimation of the UHC tracer indicator (Indicator 3.8.1). 
We used a set of tracer interventions that were restricted 
to reproductive, maternal, and child health, as well as a 
subset of infectious diseases. There is a paucity of data 
for the coverage of NCD interventions in particular64–67 
and for higher-level care. Furthermore, the UHC tracer 
indicator only captures the use of interventions and not 
the quality of the intervention provided.68,69 As more data 
become available on the delivery of interventions for 
NCDs and the modifi
 cation of key risk factors, this 
information will be incorporated into revisions of the 
UHC tracer indicator. Finally, data gaps mean that, in 
this initial assessment, we have also not been able to 
include a measure of fi
 nancial risk protection. Substantial 
investments are needed in this area to address data gaps 
to be able to track the central role of health system 
delivery in improving health.
Indicators not presently measured
Of the 14 health-related SDG indicators that were not 
included in this analysis, there are several that the GBD 
does not currently measure but that could be assessed 
in the future through GBD (table 2). These indicators 
include the coverage of treatment interventions for 
substance use disorders (Indicator 3.5.1), which would 
leverage the work on quantifying incidence, prevalence, 
and mortality for these conditions. Estimating the 
proportion of women and girls aged 15 years and older 
who are subjected to sexual violence by people other 
than an intimate partner (Indicator 5.2.2) would 
leverage work already undertaken by GBD on 
measuring prevalence of intimate partner violence. As 
part of GBD, we have also assembled a host of 
population-level data that would facilitate measurement 
of the coverage of health insurance or public health 
systems (Indicator 3.8.2), health worker density and 
distribution (Indicator 3.c.1), and completeness of 
death registration (Indicator 17
.19.2). Other indicators 
are more diffi
  cult to measure because of data gaps or 
unclear defi
 nitions. For example, data sources to 
measure the proportion of people that feel safe walking 
alone around the area they live (Indicator 16.1.4) are not 
readily available for most countries.
Strengthening the indicators for selected targets
Various commentaries have pointed out the absence of 
indicators for key health outcomes and determinants. 
Proponents have argued for indicators for mental health 
that go beyond substance abuse disorders and suicide;14–16 
other NCDs beyond cardiovascular diseases, cancer, 
diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases;70 diseases 
related 
to 
ageing, 
including 
osteoarthritis 
and 
Alzheimer’s disease;71,72 non-fatal disorders that lead to 
substantial morbidity (eg, sensory disorders); and a host 
of major risk factors. Another example is Target 3.3, 
which aims to combat hepatitis—the indicator only 
tracks hepatitis B, although the data for hepatitis C 
monitoring are as robust as those for hepatitis B and a 
highly eff
 ective cure for hepatitis C is available. As 
shown in this report, our GBD collaboration provides 
the basis for measuring many of these indicators. The 
danger is that an exhaustive laundry list of indicators, a 
criticism already levelled at the present SDG list, would 
dilute the value of the SDGs in focusing attention on 
where it is most needed.

Comparison with other assessments
There are several important similarities and diff
 erences 
between our assessment of the health-related SDGs 
and those produced by WHO18 and the Sustainable 
Development Solutions Network (SDSN).17 Like WHO, 
we focused on the health-related SDG indicators and did 
not cover indicators across all goals as SDSN does. With 
our focus on health, we covered 33 health-related 
indicators, compared with 21 by SDSN and 32 by WHO. 
Similar to SDSN, we produced a summary measure for 
the health-related SDG indicators included in the 
analysis. Most importantly, GBD uses standardised and 
internally consistent approaches to generate estimates 
across causes, risk factors, and underlying indicators. For 
example, we constrain the aggregation of cause-specifi
 c 
deaths to equal all-cause deaths. Furthermore, GBD also 
produces a complete set of estimates for 188 countries 
and for individual years from 1990 to 2015. By contrast, 
WHO and SDSN draw on disparate sources and methods 
for estimation and, as a result, report on an incomplete 
set of estimates by country. SDSN provides estimates for 
149 countries, whereas estimates for health-related SDG 
indicators produced by WHO range from 194 countries 
for under-5 mortality and neonatal mortality to 
109 countries for HIV incidence. WHO and SDSN also 
do not generate estimates for a consistent set of years. 
WHO reports 2015 estimates for only seven indicators 
and combines data from a range of years for 
ten indicators; for example, WHO combined skilled birth 
attendance estimates by country ranging from 2006 to 
2014. SDSN reports 2015 estimates for only four 
indicators and combines data from a range of years for 
eight indicators; for example, country estimates for 
smoking prevalence from the SDSN report range from 
2006 to 2013. Complete, consistent, comparable, and 
contemporary estimates of health-related SDG indicators 
are necessary to properly track progress on the SDGs.
Limitations
This study has several limitations in addition to the ones 
we already described. First, all the limitations of GBD 
relevant to the 33 indicators used here apply.34,37–39 Second, 
we tried to summarise the complexity of the 33 indicators 
using a summary measure for the health-related SDGs. 
Many approaches are available for developing summary 
measures. Since the SDGs are the outcome of a political 
consensus building process, we opted to use the stated 
targets as preferences of UN member states that have 
agreed to the SDG declaration. Our sensitivity analysis 
shows that using alternative weighting schemes produces 
broadly similar results (methods appendix pp 312–13). 
Our sensitivity analysis also highlights the limitation of 
the statistical approach (ie, principal component analysis) 
for constructing an index for this purpose, with the fi
 rst 
principal component including both positive correlations 
with indicators such as maternal mortality ratio and 
negative correlations with indicators such as alcohol use. 
An alternative could be to weight each indicator by their 
contribution to healthy life expectancy. Third, we opted to 
construct the summary measure using the Human 
Development Index method of rescaling each component 
on a scale of 0 to 100, and then taking the geometric 
mean of the components. We chose to use the minimum 
and maximum observed values to rescale, as targets for 
all indicators are not clearly specifi
 ed; however, the 
limitation of this approach is that minimum and 
maximum values might change in the future. In the next 
iteration of this analysis, we will use targets for all 
indicators and rescale them accordingly; to establish 
targets for indicators currently lacking explicit ones, we 
will determine plausible targets based on forecasts of 
trends through 2030. Fourth, a clear limitation, as 
highlighted by the UHC tracer indicator, is the need for 
broad investment in data systems in countries to properly 
assess progress on key health and development indicators 
such as the SDGs. As an example, there remains 
considerable uncertainty about levels and age patterns of 
mortality and the cause of death structure.34 Investments 
in high-quality vital registration systems and other 
related data collection systems, from censuses and 
household surveys to health management information 
systems, are crucial to the proper monitoring of progress 
towards the SDGs.
Our GBD collaboration aims to address several of the 
limitations noted above in future reporting of the 
health-related SDGs on an annual cycle. As noted, we 
will also leverage work that is underway to forecast 
country-specifi
 c disease burden, which will additionally 
provide information on the future trajectory of 
health-related SDG indicators based on historical trends 
and provide an explicit way to understand how those 
trajectories could be changed with diff
 erent policy 
adoption. We will also address, in a staged manner, the 
absence of measures of geographical and socioeconomic 
inequality in the health-related SDG indicators.
Conclusions
The measurement of 33 health-related SDG indicators 
presented here is the product of an extensive, open 
collaboration that represents many countries across a 
broad range of development. We invite others to join in 
this eff
 ort to produce an independent, robust basis for 
monitoring and assessing progress towards the SDGs. 
Independent measurement is a crucial component of 
accountability, but it is not the only component. These 
results should ideally be used as the basis for review 
and action at the country level. We hope that this 
collaboration is a major contribution to creating a 
culture of accountability for the SDGs. Other actors, 
especially governments, civil society organisations, 
donors, and global development institutions, need to 
participate in the process of using this information to 
enhance accountability through open and transparent 
review and action.
