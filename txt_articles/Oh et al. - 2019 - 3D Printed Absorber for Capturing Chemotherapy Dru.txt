ABSTRACT: Despite efforts to develop increasingly targeted and personalized cancer therapeutics, dosing of drugs in cancer
chemotherapy is limited by systemic toxic side effects. We have designed, built, and deployed porous absorbers for capturing
chemotherapy drugs from the bloodstream after these drugs have had their effect on a tumor, but before they are released into
the body where they can cause hazardous side effects. The support structure of the absorbers was built using 3D printing
technology. This structure was coated with a nanostructured block copolymer with outer blocks that anchor the polymer chains
to the 3D printed support structure and a middle block that has an affinity for the drug. The middle block is
polystyrenesulfonate which binds to doxorubicin, a widely used and effective chemotherapy drug with significant toxic side
effects. The absorbers are designed for deployment during chemotherapy using minimally invasive image-guided endovascular
surgical procedures. We show that the introduction of the absorbers into the blood of swine models enables the capture of 64 ±
6% of the administered drug (doxorubicin) without any immediate adverse effects. Problems related to blood clots, vein wall
dissection, and other biocompatibility issues were not observed. This development represents a significant step forward in
minimizing toxic side effects of chemotherapy.
■ INTRODUCTION
Cancer is becoming the leading cause of death in most
developed nations.1,2 Although there have been enormous
efforts to develop more targeted and personalized cancer
therapeutics, dosing of drugs in cancer chemotherapy is often
limited by systemic toxic side effects. During intra-arterial
chemotherapy infusion to a target organ,3,4 excess drug that is
not trapped in the target organ passes through to the veins
draining the organ, and is then circulated to the rest of the body,
causing toxicities in distant locations. Typically, more than 50−
80% of the injected drug is not trapped in the target organ,
bypasses the tumor, and enters general circulation.5
In the context of reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy, we
present the development of a new biomedical device: an
absorber that captures excess chemotherapeutic drug before it
spreads through the body.6−9 Absorption columns are routinely
used in industry to remove pollutants from chemical streams.

 The proposed absorber is temporarily deployed in the vein
draining the organ undergoing intra-arterial chemotherapy
infusion, and is removed after the infusion is completed. This
concept is depicted schematically in Figure 1a where we show
the treatment of a tumor within the liver. The drug is injected in
the hepatic artery as is the case in conventional intra-arterial
chemotherapy infusion. The blood exiting the liver through the
hepatic veins passes through the absorber that, in principle,
captures the excess drug. In principle, if all of the drug is not
captured during the first pass, some of it may be captured at
subsequent passes. The particular drug used in this study is
doxorubicin. The chemical structure of doxorubicin is shown in
Figure 1b. The proposed approach for doxorubicin capture is
shown in Figure 1c. Minimally invasive image-guided
endovascular surgical procedures are used to deliver the drug
to the tumor using the hepatic artery and to place the absorber in
the hepatic veins, hepatic vein confluence, or suprahepatic
inferior vena cava. The standard introducer sheaths and guide
wires used to accomplish this task are shown in Figure 1c. The
approach described in Figure 1 can be used to minimize toxic
effects of chemotherapy used at different locations in the body.
The toxicity of drugs used to treat other diseases besides cancer
may also be modulated by the proposed approach. Similarly,
toxins from bacterial infections, environmental toxins, or cells
themselves could be captured using specific chemical, physical,
or biological features.10−12
Doxorubicin is a low-cost, highly effective agent frequently
used in chemotherapy for several decades.13 Based on a linear
dose response model, increasing the dose of doxorubicin linearly
increases tumor cell death.14−24 This provides motivation for
higher-dose doxorubicin therapy, but the side effects of high-
dose doxorubicin therapy include irreversible cardiac failure,
which limits implementation of the high-dose regimen. An
established and highly effective agent like doxorubicin is a
compelling first candidate for demonstrating the proposed drug
capture approach.
For the absorber to work efficiently, it must selectively bind
the target drug (doxorubicin in this study) within an hour or less
(typical time scale of intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion for the
liver). The structure of the absorber must be carefully designed
and fabricated so as not to severely impair blood flow or cause
thrombosis, although the latter issue is easily addressed with
intraprocedural anticoagulation, a standard technique in
interventional radiology. Custom-made absorbers must be
used as individual patients have veins of different dimensions.
We have thus used 3D printing to fabricate the absorbers used in
this study. Successful design, fabrication, and deployment of the
absorber has the potential to open a new route to help patients
fight cancer.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Porous cylinders, shown in Figure 2, were printed at Carbon,
Inc. in Redwood City, CA.25 The absorbers were 5 mm in
diameter and 30 mm in length. The targeted internal structure of
the cylinders is shown in Figure 2a. A central hole (diameter =
0.89 mm) that runs through the cylinder enables attachment of a
device to a guide wire needed for minimally invasive surgery.
This is surrounded by a square lattice structure with a
characteristic dimension of 800 μm. This dimension was chosen
to prevent hemolysis of blood cells; white blood cells, with
diameters about 9−20 μm, are the largest component of
blood.26,27 The porous cylinders were printed by photoinduced
cross-linking of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA),
shown in Figure 2c. Poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymers are
widely used in biomedical engineering because of their
biocompatibility and fouling resistance.28−34 Moreover, other
relevant properties such as mechanical strength and water
swelling of PEG-based polymers can be readily tuned by
controlling the polymerization conditions.35−44 Optical micro-
graphs of the 3D printed porous cylinders are shown in Figure
2b. It is clear that the printing process faithfully reproduces the
targeted internal structures shown in Figure 2a. The porous
cylinder serves as the scaffold of the absorber.
The surfaces of the porous cylinders were coated with a
poly(tert-butylstyrene)-b-poly(ethylene-co-propylene)-b-poly-
(styrene-co-styrenesulfonate)-b-poly(ethylene-co-propylene)-b-
poly(tert-butylstyrene) (PtBS−PEP−PSS−PEP−PtBS) block
copolymer provided by Kraton Performance Polymers, Inc.

 (Houston, TX). The chemical structure of the block copolymer
is shown in Figure 2d. The block copolymer was provided in the
form of 10 wt % solution of the polymer dissolved in a mixture of
heptane and cyclohexane (72:28 by mass).45−47 The 3D printed
cylinders were fitted into silicone tubing, and the polymer
solution was pumped through the cylinders for 10 min. The
cylinders were then dried, first in air at 50 °C for 1 h and 30 min,
followed by drying under vacuum at room temperature for 24 h.
This resulted in a coating of the copolymer on the printed
cylinders. To visualize this coating, the surface-modified
cylinders were imaged using phase-contrast X-ray micro-
tomography. The X-ray microtomography experiment was
designed to image three sets of lattices at a time. An uncoated
filter was imaged first, and the image obtained is shown in Figure
2e. The internal structure within the scaffolds seen in Figure 2e
may arise due to either voids or noisy data. The same filter was
subjected to the coating protocol and imaged again by phase-
contrast X-ray microtomography. The two tomograms were
superposed, and voxels in the tomogram of the coated absorber
were colored in orange, while the uncoated filter voxels were
colored in gray. The superposed tomogram, shown in Figure 2f,
clearly shows the presence of a uniform coating over the surfaces
of the absorber. The magnified image of the lattice struts, shown
in Figure 2g, h, shows the thickness of the coated layer at several
locations. The X-ray microtomography experiments confirm the
presence of a reasonably homogeneous coating of the PtBS−

 PEP−PSS−PEP−PtBS polymer on the absorber scaffolds. The
coating thickness is more-or-less uniform, ranging from 30 to 60
μm. The estimated surface area of an absorber is 2000 mm2
including an external surface. Additional X-ray tomography
slices and confocal microscopy images of uncoated and coated
absorbers are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S1
and S2). Our choice for the polymer coating was informed by
previous studies where it was shown that polystyrenesulfonate
chains demonstrated high capacity for binding with doxor-
ubicin.6,8,9 It is likely that the PtBS and PEP blocks in the block
copolymer are responsible for adhesion between the coating and
3D printed scaffold. The approach for coating the cylinders
described here was arrived at after considerable trial and error.
Small changes in the composition of either the block copolymer
or the solvent result in unstable coating on the scaffolds.
We performed in vivo experiments with the coated 3D printed
absorbers described above in three animal models (swine). The
diameter of the absorbers (5 mm) was determined by the size of
the introducer sheath (i.e., 18 French or 6 mm diameter sheath)
that could be accommodated in the common femoral and
common iliac veins of the swine, which are similar in diameter to
the hepatic veins in an adult human. The diameter of the
introducer sheath is minimized to minimize blood loss during
the operation. The length of the absorbers (30 mm) was chosen
to match the length of the common iliac vein. The common iliac
vein was chosen to facilitate interpretation of experimental data
and demonstrate proof-of-concept. Also, the diameter of the
common iliac vein is approximately 10 mm, similar to the
diameter of human hepatic veins near their confluence with the
inferior vena cava where the absorbers will be placed for
capturing excess drug draining the liver during hepatic intra-
arterial chemotherapy infusion (see Figure 1c). To minimize the
blood flow around the absorber, two cylinders were brought to
the desired location using the introducer sheath, one after the
other, and arranged in parallel as shown in Figure 3a.
The absorbers were tested in the swine models undergoing
chemo-infusion in the common iliac vein of 50 mg of
doxorubicin over 10 min, corresponding to a typical dose used
clinically in chemotherapy for intra-arterial treatment of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Doxorubicin concentrations were
monitored as a function of time using blood-sampling catheters
at three different locations. Two locations, the pre-device and
post-device sampling catheters, are depicted schematically in
Figure 3a. The pre-device catheter is located between the
injection and the absorber. The post-device catheter is located
just after the absorber. The third catheter was located at the
internal jugular vein, well-removed from the common iliac vein
such that any blood sample taken from this location will reflect
the systemic drug concentration, as doxorubicin would have had
to pass through the inferior vena cava, heart, pulmonary
vasculature, systemic arteries, capillaries, and systemic veins to
reach that sampling point. We refer this as the peripheral
location. X-ray fluoroscopy images of the absorbers in common
iliac vein obtained during one of our in vivo experiments are
shown in Figure 3b, c. The introduction sheath and guide wires
used to deliver the absorbers are clearly seen in Figure 3b. The
sheath was introduced via a common femoral vein. The
absorbers are located between metallic fasteners that are also
visible in Figure 3b. The higher-magnification image (Figure 3c)
shows the two absorbers arranged in parallel.
Results of two separate in vivo experiments are shown in
Figure 4. In Figure 4a, we show the measured doxorubicin
concentration as a function of time at the three locations
described above during a control experiment, wherein uncoated
absorbers were placed in the common iliac vein. The
doxorubicin concentrations measured at the pre-device and
the post-device locations are qualitatively similar, indicating that
most of the doxorubicin injected passes through the absorbers.
In both cases, the doxorubicin concentration increases rapidly at
early time, remains well above the background for about 10−15
min, and then decreases to zero at about 30 min. The
doxorubicin concentration measured at the peripheral location
increases only slightly when doxorubicin is injected into the
animal model. In Figure 4b, we show the images of the plasma
from the centrifuged samples obtained from the three sampling
catheters during the control experiments. Since doxorubicin has
a characteristic orange color, the higher the doxorubicin
concentration is, the darker the orange color is in the samples.
The color darkness in the samples is qualitatively consistent with
the doxorubicin concentration profiles shown in Figure 4a.
There is little qualitative difference between the images obtained
from the pre-device and the post-device catheters in the control
experiment.
In Figure 4c, we show the measured doxorubicin concen-
tration as a function of time when coated absorbers were
deployed. These results differ significantly from those in Figure
4a. In Figure 4c, we see that the post-device doxorubicin
concentration is significantly lower than that measured at the
pre-device location. The integrated areas under the two data sets
enable quantification of the drug capture efficiency. In this
experiment, 69% of the doxorubicin is captured by the coated
3D printed absorbers, corresponding to 0.017 mg doxorubicin/
mm2 of surface. The images of the plasma from the centrifuged

 samples obtained from three sampling catheters during this
experiment, shown in Figure 4d, confirm the removal of
doxorubicin. In addition, problems related to blood clots, vein
wall dissection, and other biocompatibility issues were not
observed during the operation.
The experiments described above (using two coated and two
uncoated absorbers in parallel as shown in Figure 4) were
repeated in two additional animals. In one of the animals, the
experiments with the coated absorbers were performed two
times. The trends of the other drug capture experiments were
similar to those reported in Figure 4 (absolute Dox
concentrations differ by a factor of about two). The results of
other drug capture experiments are shown in the Supporting
Information (Figures S3 and S4). The doxorubicin capture
efficiency ranged from 57% to 69%. The average value of drug
capture efficiency was 64 ± 6%.
After the in vivo experiments, we tried to release the
doxorubicin from the coated absorbers by pumping an aqueous
potassium chloride and ethanol mixture (20% w/v)48−52
through the absorbers for one month. Analysis of the mixture
showed negligible doxorubicin concentrations (less than 0.001
mg/mL). This implies that doxorubicin binds irreversibly to the
absorbers. Following this experiment, the absorbers were
crushed and immersed in the aqueous mixture of potassium
chloride and ethanol described above. The uncoated absorbers
used in in vivo experiments were subjected to the same
experiments. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure
5. A colorless solution was obtained when the uncoated
absorbers, used in in vivo experiments, were studied, as shown
in Figure 5a. In contrast, an orange colored solution was
obtained when the coated absorbers, used in in vivo experiments,

 were studied, as shown in Figure 5b. If doxorubicin were only
present in the coating, it would have been relatively easy to
extract it after the in vivo experiments. We thus posit that
doxorubicin is trapped in the interior of our absorbers. From a
practical point of view, this may be advantageous, as it implies,
that doxorubicin will not be released into the body as the
absorbers are withdrawn through the blood vessels after the
proposed chemotherapy procedure is completed. From an
analytical point of view, however, it has proven difficult to
quantify the amount of doxorubicin that has been absorbed.
Significant further work is required to quantify this.
■ CONCLUSION
We have designed, built, and deployed porous absorbers for
capturing chemotherapy drugs in vivo before they spread
through the body to reduce systemic toxic side effects. The
porosity of the absorber was obtained by 3D printing a lattice
structure within the cylinders. The application of a polystyr-
enesulfonate coating on the absorber was essential for drug
capture. Our initial design enables the capture of 64 ± 6% of the
administered drug without noticeable adverse side effects. There
are numerous approaches for using the platform we have
developed to improve the efficacy of drug capture. Most simply,
the number of absorber devices could be increased, increasing
total surface area for drug binding. The lattice size could also be
decreased to enhance drug capture. Additional improvement in
performance may be obtained by changing the chemical
composition and thickness of the coating layer. Absorbers
developed here could be used in conjunction with other
approaches for delivering chemotherapy drug such as drug-
eluting-bead-based transarterial chemoembolization
(TACE).49,51,53−56 In future clinical trials, we may use custom
3D printed elastomeric absorbers with patient-specific form
factors that fit optimally in the vein(s) of the patient, as can be
created from preprocedure computed tomography (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets. Although much
work remains, we believe that the present study opens a new
route to help patients fight cancer by minimizing drug toxicity,
and better treat their disease and improve survival by enabling
high-dose regional chemotherapy.
■ MATERIALS AND METHOD
Preparation of Porous Cylinders. Cylindrical porous
absorbers for this study were prepared at Carbon, Inc., a 3D
printing company located at Redwood City, CA. The
prepolymer solution was prepared by adding 1 wt % initiators
(i.e., 0.8 wt % of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl-diphenylphosphine
oxide (TPO, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2 wt % of 2-isopropylthiox-
anthone (ITX, Esstech, Inc.)) and 0.23 wt % of carbon black
pigment to poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA, MW =
250 g/mol, Sigma-Aldrich) (see Figure 2c). The solution was
photopolymerized by using the continuous liquid interface
production (CLIP) method; more information about the CLIP
can be found elsewhere.25,57−59 The cylinders obtained by this
process were washed in 2-propanol to remove uncured resin
from the polymer network. The cylinders were allowed to air-dry
after washing and were UV postcured using a Dymax ECE 5000
UV cure chamber (Torrington, CT) in 30 s intervals with
rotation in-between cures for a total of 2 min. Absorbers were
imaged and measured using a Keyence VHX-5000 microscope
(Itasca, IL).
Sulfonated Polymer Used for Coating on Porous
Cylinders. The surface of the 3D printed porous cylinders
was modified by coating a thin layer of sulfonated styrenic
pentablock copolymers. The sulfonated styrenic pentablock
copolymers (PtBS−PEP−PSS−PEP−PtBS) were synthesized
via anionic polymerization and a subsequent postpolymerization
sulfonation process, and detailed procedures have been
described elsewhere.60,61 The sulfonation level (mol %) of the
middle polystyrene (PS) block was controlled to a desired ion
exchange capacity (IEC). In this study, the sulfonated
pentablock copolymer of IEC = 2.0 mequiv/g (dry polymer)
(sulfonation level = 52 mol %) was used. The number-average
molecular weight of the unsulfonated pentablock copolymer is
approximately 78 000 g/mol (block mass fractions are
PtBS:PEP:PSS = 0.33:0.27:0.40), and the volume fraction of
mid PSS block is 0.43445,46. Water uptake in this copolymer,
measured by soaking films in water at room temperature until
equilibrium was reached (up to a week), was 1.44 ± 0.01 g of
water per g of dry polymer.
X-ray Tomography. The uncoated and coated absorbers
were imaged using synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography at
beamline 8.3.2 of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory. X-rays with energy 23 keV were
generated by the synchrotron and illuminated the sample. The
X-rays transmitted through the sample were converted using a
scintillator into visible light. The X-ray beam was over 10 mm in
width. The position of the sample with respect to the X-ray beam
was chosen so that three sets of struts in the absorber could be
imaged in one scan. The sample to detector distance was 150
mm, and the X-ray exposure time was 300 ms. This image was
magnified by an optical microscope and collected on a sCMOS
pco.edge detector. As the sample was rotated through 180°, a
total of 2160 images were collected.31 These projection images
were reconstructed using the tomography plugin for the
program Xi-Cam,62 which uses TomoPy63 to generate digital
cross-sectional slice images, and subsequently these were
stacked to generate 3D reconstructed images of the cylinders.
The superpositions of 3D reconstructed uncoated and coated
cylinders were performed using the fit-in-map method of the
UCSF Chimera package (correlation factor = 0.99).64
In Vivo Experiments. 3D printed absorbers were tested in
vivo in three swine models (40−45 kg). The absorber was strung
along a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated nitinol guide
wire (Glidewire, Terumo Interventional Systems, Somerset, NJ)
for smooth and rapid movement through tortuous blood vessels;
The guide wire went through the middle hole of the absorber,
and two metallic fasteners on each end of the absorber were used
to keep the absorber in place. In vivo experiments were
performed under compliance with the protocols of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Each
animal was monitored with blood pressure, pulse oximetry, heart
rate, and electrocardiogram while under general anesthesia with
isoflurane. An 18 French (diameter = 6 mm) introducer sheath
(Gore Dryseal Flex Introducer Sheath, W. L. Gore & Associates,
Inc., Flagstaff, AR) placed into the common femoral vein was
used to deliver the absorbers into the common iliac vein.
Sampling and injection catheters were placed under fluoroscopy
guidance at the spot of interest relative to the absorbers. A pre-
device sampling catheter was introduced via the sheath to the left
common iliac vein. A post-device sampling catheter was
introduced through the internal jugular vein and was placed
into the common iliac vein adjacent to the bifurcation of the

 vena cava. The distances between the catheters and absorbers
were carefully adjusted to be consistent over a series of in vivo
experiments. Prior to the start of the experiments, patency of the
venous system was demonstrated using iodinated contrast
injection (Iohexol, Omnipaque-300, GE Healthcare).
To simulate intra-arterial chemotherapy dosing, 50 mg of
doxorubicin (2 mg/mL, doxorubicin hydrochloride injection,
United States Pharmacopeia, Pfizer, New York, NY) was
injected into the common iliac vein via an infusion pump at a
constant rate of 2.5 mL/min over 10 min. Blood aliquots of 2 mL
at different times from the pre-device, post-device, and
peripheral sampling locations were collected after 1.5 mL of
blood was wasted to account for the volume within the catheter.
Measurement of Doxorubicin Concentration. Doxor-
ubicin concentrations in the blood aliquots were determined
using fluorescence spectroscopy. The blood aliquots were first
centrifuged to separate the plasma from other blood
components, since the majority of doxorubicin is in the plasma.9
Fluorescence measurements were made using the plasma
samples to determine the doxorubicin concentration. The
fluorescence measurements were made using a FlexStation 3
Multi-Mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose,
CA) at a known emission wavelength of 550 nm upon excitation
with a 480 nm laser.6,8,9,48−51,65 The excitation and emission
wavelengths are based on well-established protocols in
determining doxorubicin concentration.8,9 The doxorubicin
concentration was calculated from the measured fluorescence at
550 nm using the calibration curve, which correlates
fluorescence emission to doxorubicin concentration.
