 Increased Interleukin-35 Levels
in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes
With Remaining C-Peptide
Diabetes Care 2017;40:1090–1095 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc16-2121
OBJECTIVE
Many patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes have remaining functional b-cells.
This study investigated immunological differences between patients with or without
measurable remaining endogenous insulin production after ‡10 years duration of
disease.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Patients (n = 113; ‡18 years of age) with type 1 diabetes and with disease duration
of ‡10 years were recruited at Uppsala University Hospital. Residual b-cell function
was determined with an ultrasensitive C-peptide ELISA. Circulating cytokines, includ-
ing interleukin-35 (IL-35), were determined in plasma. Additional blood samples
were collected from 14 of the identified C-peptide–positive patients and 12 of the
C-peptide–negative patients, as well as from 15 healthy control subjects, and were
used for immediate investigation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
RESULTS
The blood concentration of the cytokine IL-35 was markedly lower in C-peptide–
negative patients, and this was associated with a simultaneous decrease in the
proportion of IL-35+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), IL-35+ regulatory B cells, and IL-35–
producing CD8+Foxp3+ cells. IL-35 has previously been shown to maintain the phe-
notype of Tregs, block the differentiation of T-helper 17 cells, and thereby dampen
immune assaults to b-cells. We found that the proportions of IL-17a+ cells among the
Tregs, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were lower in the C-peptide–positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS
Patients with remaining endogenous b-cell function after >10 years duration of
type 1 diabetes differ immunologically from other patients with long-standing type 1
diabetes. In particular, they have a much higher IL-35 production.
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by an immune-mediated progressive destruction of
the insulin-producing b-cells. Recent improvements in the sensitivity of C-peptide
assays have, however, revealed that many patients even after long-standing type 1
diabetes have remaining low C-peptide concentrations in blood (1–4), which reflect
functional, glucose-responsive b-cells (3). This suggests that in these individuals, some
ofthe b-cells are resistant to immune destruction and thereby a suitable target for new
protocols aiming to expand b-cell mass. Residual insulin secretion, albeit at higher
levels, is known to contribute to lower mean blood glucose concentrations, less blood
glucose fluctuations, and diminished risk of ketoacidosis (5). Stimulated C-peptide

 levels .200 pmol/L are also associated
with decreased risks of hypoglycemic
events and late complications (6).
Presently, there is scarce knowledge
on the determinants for a long-term
residual b-cell mass in type 1 diabetes.
A previous study showed a correlation
of remaining C-peptide concentrations
to disease duration and level of zinc
transporter-8 autoantibodies, but then
almost half of the studied patients were
investigated between 0 and 10 years
after diagnosis (2). In another study,
only nonfasting C-peptide concentrations
were analyzed in patients with type 1
diabetes for .50 years, which made cor-
relations between residual C-peptide lev-
els and other parameters difficult (1).
Nevertheless, 2.5% of these patients
had sustained residual C-peptide pro-
duction (.200 pmol/L) and were charac-
terized by lower HbA1c, older age of onset
of disease, and higher frequency of the
HLA DR3 genotype.
The current study focused on this gap
in knowledge and tested the hypothesis
that differences in cell-mediated immu-
nity explain the maintenance of endoge-
nous insulin production in some patients
with long-standing type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Uppsala
County ethics board, and the reported
investigations were carried out in accor-
dance with the principles of the Declara-
tion of Helsinki as revised in 2000. All
participants were provided oral and writ-
ten information and signed a written con-
sent prior to inclusion in the study.
Study Participants, Clinical Parameters,
and Blood Sampling
Patients ($18 years of age) with type 1
diabetes and with disease duration
of $10 years were recruited at Uppsala
University Hospital. Fasting blood sam-
ples were collected under standardized
conditions in all patients. None of the pa-
tients were, or had recently been, ill from
infectious diseases. Routine lab parame-
ters were analyzed at our central clinical
chemistry laboratory, whereasHLAclassII
alleles were determined at our central
clinical immunology laboratory. Separate
blood plasma was obtained in EDTA tubes
by centrifugation and immediately fro-
zen at 280°C for later determination of
C-peptide and cytokine concentrations.
Additional blood samples were collected
from 14 of the identified C-peptide–
positive patients and 12 of the C-peptide–
negative patients, as well as from 15
healthy control subjects, and were used
for immediate investigation of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) (seebe-
low). The selection of C-peptide–negative
and –positive patients for the cellular
studies was based on their willingness
and availability forfurther blood sampling
on requested dates. Healthy control sub-
jects were matched to the patients with
type 1 diabetes for age, sex, and BMI.
None of the healthy control subjects
had a first-degree relative diagnosed
with type 1 diabetes.
For 18 of the C-peptide–positive pa-
tients, a follow-up visit with new C-peptide
measurement was performed 12–18
months after the first visit. Similarly, 24
of the C-peptide–negative patients were
investigated for fasting and stimulated
C-peptide concentrations.
Determination of C-Peptide and
Cytokine Concentrations in Plasma
Plasma C-peptide concentrations were
analyzed blinded by Mercodia AB (Up-
psala, Sweden) using an ultrasensitive
ELISA (catalog no. 10-1141-01; Mercodia)
(2). The assay was calibrated against the
international reference reagent for C-
peptide, C-peptide 84/510 (a World Health
Organization standard), and is listed with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as
class I in vitro diagnostic devices. The ul-
trasensitive assay’s lower detection limit
is set to 1.17 pmol/L, with inter- and intra-
assay coefficients of variation at 5.5 and
3.8% at 37 pmol/L. Interleukin-35 (IL-35)
concentrations were determined by an
ELISA (BioLegend, San Diego, CA). All other
cytokineswereanalyzedusingamesoscale
multiplex kit (Meso Scale Diagnostics,
Rockville, MD).
Flow Cytometry
Freshly isolated PBMCs were prepared by
using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). The purity of the live cells
was .90% in each sample. PBMCs were
stained with antibodies for surface
markers (Supplementary Table 1). The
cells were thereafter fixed and permeabi-
lized with Fixation Permeabilization
Buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for in-
tracellular markers (Supplementary Table
1). The samples were run on LSR II Fortesa
(BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using DivaDacker
software (BD), and one million events were
counted for analysis. The fluorescence
minus one, isotype, and single-stained con-
trols were used for gating strategies as de-
scribedpreviously(7,8). TheFlowCytometry
Standard files were analyzed on FlowLogic
software (Inivai Technologies, Mentone,
Australia). For cytokine staining, we did
not stimulate the cells and blocked the
cytokine secretion by using cytokine se-
cretion blockers, since they can cause ar-
tifacts upon Foxp3 staining (8,9).
Statistics
Where the data were assessed on a con-
tinuous scale, the two-tailed Student t
test was used for comparing the means
of two independent samples, and a one-
way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test was
used for pairwise comparisons among the
means of three or more groups. Where
the data were assessed as ranks relative
to other participants in the groups, the
two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was ap-
plied to compare the rank means of two
groups, and the Kruskal-Wallis test with
the Bonferroni post hoc test was used for
pairwise comparisons among the rank
means of three or more groups. P val-
ues ,0.05 were considered significant.
All values are given as means 6 SEM.
RESULTS
Approximately 40% of the investigated
patients with type 1 diabetes and $10
years duration of disease had measurable
fasting C-peptide concentrations (Table
1). The mean age of C-peptide–positive
patients was 43.0 years compared
with a mean of 37.6 years for C-peptide–
negative patients, but the difference
was not statistically significant (P =
0.077). The mean age at disease onset
was not significantly older for C-peptide–
positive patients (15.5 vs. 13.2 years,
P = 0.075), and the disease duration
did not differ significantly between the
two groups. Further, we observed no statis-
tical difference in indicators of metabolic
controlor insulinneedsbetweenC-peptide–
positive and –negative patients. The pres-
ence of GAD and/or IA2 antibodies did
not differ between the two groups. How-
ever, we observed the DR4 and DQ3
risk allele to be more frequent in
C-peptide–positive patients (Table 1).
The levels of IL-35 were found to be sig-
nificantly higher (twofold, P = 0.0004) in
the C-peptide–positive patients compared
with the C-peptide–negative patients
(Table1).ThelevelsofIL-15weredecreased

 in C-peptide–positive patients, although
this did not remain statistically signifi-
cant when controlling the type 1 error
by correcting for multiple cytokine analy-
ses (Table 1). All other cytokines mea-
sured were similar in both groups (Table
1). C-peptide concentrations were stable
over time in most patients (Supplementary
Fig. 1).
Since IL-35 is produced by regulatory
T cells (Tregs), CD8+Foxp3+ cells, reg-
ulatory B cells (Bregs), and tolerogenic
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (10–15),
we determined the proportion of IL-35+
cells among these cell types. The propor-
tion of IL-35+ Tregs was decreased in
C-peptide–negative patients when com-
pared with both healthy control subjects
and C-peptide–positive patients (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Fig. 2), although not
the median fluorescent intensities (MFIs)
for subunits of IL-35 (Ebi3 and IL-12p35;
data not shown). We did not observe any
differences in the proportions of Tregs in
total (Fig. 1B), or of Tregs, thymic-derived
Tregs (tTregs), or peripherally induced
Tregs (pTregs) among CD4+ T cells (data
not shown) in C-peptide–negative pa-
tients when compared with healthy con-
trol subjects and C-peptide–positive
patients. CD8+Foxp3+ among CD8+ cells
were decreased in the C-peptide–negative
patients compared with C-peptide–
positive patients (Fig. 1C), whereas the
total proportion of CD8+Foxp3+ did not
differ between the groups (Fig. 1D).
The proportion of IL-35+ Bregs was de-
creased in C-peptide–negative patients
compared with healthy control sub-
jects (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 3),
whereas the total proportion of Bregs
among CD19+ cells was similar between
the groups (Fig. 2B and Supplementary
Fig. 3). The proportion of IL-35+ APCs
was similar in all groups (data not shown).
The MFIs of both Ebi3 and IL-12p35 among
Bregs and tolerogenic APCs were also sim-
ilar in all groups (data not shown).
In both type 1 diabetes animal models
and in patients, T-helper 17 (Th17) cells
play an important role in the reduction of
b-cell mass (16,17). Interestingly, the pro-
portion of IL-17a+ cells among Tregs was
increased in C-peptide–negative patients
(Fig. 3A), although MFIs of CD25 in Tregs
were similar in all the groups (Fig. 3B).

IL-35 and Residual C-Peptide in Type 1 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 40, August 2017
 the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also
lower in the C-peptide–positive patients
(Fig. 3C and D and Supplementary Figs.
4 and 5).
IL-15 regulates the homeostasis of
CD4+, CD8+, natural killer (NK), and natu-
ral killer T (NKT) cells and promotes the
development of CD8+ diabetogenic cells
(18). Therefore, we analyzed the pro-
portion of CD3+CD562, CD4+CD252CD8+,
CD56low(NK), CD56high(NK), and CD3+
CD56+(NKT) cells but observed no differ-
ences between C-peptide–negative and
–positive patients (data not shown). The
proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells
and APCs were also similar in C-peptide–
positive patients and –negative patients
(data not shown).
CONCLUSIONS
Todate, there are noimmunological stud-
ies to explain why some patients with
type 1 diabetes have spared b-cells for
decades. We hypothesized that the re-
maining C-peptide concentrations in pa-
tients with type 1 diabetes may be due
to a beneficial shift in the immunological
profile. Several of the investigated pro-
and anti-inflammatory cytokines have
previously been suggested to be impor-
tant players in affecting disease develop-
ment in both animal models of type 1
diabetes and in patients with type 1 di-
abetes. Noteworthy, the IL-35 concentra-
tions in blood plasma were observed to
be twice as high in the patients with re-
maining C-peptide. Approximately 40% of
patients with type 1 diabetes and $10
years disease duration had measurable
fasting C-peptide concentrations, which
is similar to the results of a previous study
(2) using the same technique for the mea-
surements. The presence of even low
concentrations of circulating C-peptide
indicates residual b-cells spared by the
immune system. Since samples were col-
lected under fasting conditions and
C-peptide production therefore was not
maximally stimulated during controlled
conditions, we cannot exclude that
some patients were erroneously classi-
fiedasC-peptide–negativepatients. How-
ever, it should be noted that the mean
blood glucose concentrations at sam-
pling were .10 mmol/L in both groups,
implying a moderate degree of glucose
stimulation to C-peptide secretion. The
current study was the first to perform
follow-up C-peptide measurements
$12 months after first measurements,
and we found the levels to be stable
over time in most patients.
We and others have previously report-
ed that systemic treatment with IL-35 (8)
or its overexpression in b-cells (19) could
prevent development ofdisease in animal
models of type 1 diabetes. Systemic IL-35
treatment even reversed manifest diabetes
in both multiple low-dose streptozotocin–
treated mice and in spontaneously
diabetic NOD mice (8). We have also re-
ported on decreased plasma levels of
IL-35 in new-onset and long-standing
type 1 diabetes compared with healthy
controls (8).

 C-peptide–negative patients can explain
their lower concentrations of IL-35 in
plasma. We did not find any differences
in the proportion of tTregs and pTregs in
our study. tTregs and pTregs were distin-
guished by using Helios as a marker for
tTregs (7), and it has been reported that
Helios+ Tregs are more suppressive of im-
mune responses than Helios2 Tregs
(7,20). Furthermore, it has been shown
that Helios, together with neuropilin-1,
plays a role in the secretion of IL-35 by
Tregs (21).
IL-35 has been shown to maintain the
suppressive phenotype of Tregs, block
the differentiation of Th17 cells, and
thereby dampen the ongoing immune
destruction of b-cells (8). In line with this,
we found that the proportions of IL-17a+
cells among the Tregs, CD4+ T cells, and
CD8+ T cells were lower in the C-peptide–
positive patients. This could be an impor-
tant mechanism for the maintenance of
b-cell function in these patients (16,17).
Kuczy´
nski et al. (22) have reported on
elevated IL-15 concentrations in patients
with type 1 diabetes compared with
healthy control subjects. In NOD mice,
IL-15 expression by pancreatic b-cells
leads to the development of insulitis
and b-cell destruction, but manifest dis-
ease could be reversed by blocking IL-15
signaling (23). The presently observed
decreased circulating levels of IL-15 in
the C-peptide–positive patients therefore
seem to be in agreement with a less ac-
tive destruction of b-cells.
Since this is an association study, it is
impossible to answer whether the immu-
nological differences are causal for pro-
tection of residual b-cells. A prospective
longitudinal study would be needed to
understand whether the more favorable
immunological situation in long-standing
C-peptide–positive patients with type 1
diabeteswaspresent alreadyatthe debut
of the disease, or if it had been acquired.
Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate
on the latter, since we recently measured
plasma IL-35 concentrations, by the same
assay presently used, in eight newly diag-
nosed patients with type 1 diabetes and
foundthemconsistently low(,18 ng/mL),
with a mean value even lower than that
of C-peptide–negative patients in the
current study (8). Similar to Keenan et al.
(1), we observed the DR4 risk allele to
be more frequent in C-peptide–positive
patients, and we also found DQ3 to be
more common in these patients. The as-
sociation of this to the immunological
findings remains to be determined.
In conclusion, we observed immuno-
logical changes, which may explain the
long-term survival of functional b-cells
in some patients with type 1 diabetes.
There was especially a striking difference
in circulating levels of IL-35 between pa-
tients with type 1 diabetes that remained
C-peptide positive and those where no
residual b-cell function could be dis-
cerned. Based on the data in the current
report and our previous work in NOD
mice (8), it would be of great interest to
further explore the potential of IL-35 as a
treatment option in both new-onset and
long-standing type 1 diabetes.
