Abstract
How many human embryos die between fertilisation and birth under natural
conditions? It is widely accepted that natural human embryo mortality is
high, particularly during the first weeks after fertilisation, with total prenatal
losses of 70% and higher frequently claimed. However, the first external
sign of pregnancy occurs two weeks after fertilisation with a missed
menstrual period, and establishing the fate of embryos before this is
challenging. Calculations are additionally hampered by a lack of data on the
efficiency of fertilisation under natural conditions. Four distinct sources are
used to justify quantitative claims regarding embryo loss: (i) a hypothesis
published by Roberts & Lowe in 
 
  is widely cited but has no

practical quantitative value; (ii) life table analyses give consistent
assessments of clinical pregnancy loss, but cannot illuminate losses at
earlier stages of development; (iii) studies that measure human chorionic
gonadotrophin (hCG) reveal losses in the second week of development and
beyond, but not before; and (iv) the classic studies of Hertig and Rock offer
the only direct insight into the fate of human embryos from fertilisation under
natural conditions. Re-examination of Hertig’s data demonstrates that his
estimates for fertilisation rate and early embryo loss are highly imprecise
and casts doubt on the validity of his numerical analysis. A recent
re-analysis of hCG study data concluded that approximately 40-60% of
embryos may be lost between fertilisation and birth, although this will vary
substantially between individual women. In conclusion, natural human
embryo mortality is lower than often claimed and widely accepted.
Estimates for total prenatal mortality of 70% or higher are exaggerated and
not supported by the available data.

 Introduction
Early human embryo mortality is a matter of considerable inter-
est not only to reproductive biologists and fertility doctors, but 
also to philosophers1,2, theologians3 and lawyers4. Most espe-
cially, becoming pregnant and having children is of overwhelming 
and personal importance to many women and their families. As 
 
with all biological processes, nothing works perfectly all the 
 
time5, and failure to conceive and pregnancy loss are common prob-
lems. However, among reputable scientific publications, including 
medical and reproductive biology text books, scientific reviews 
and primary research articles, reported mortality estimates are 
 
surprisingly varied and include: 30–70%6, >50%7 and 75%8 
before and during implantation; >50%9, 73%10 and 80%11 
before the 6th week; 75% before the 8th week12; 70% in the first 
 
trimester13; 40–50% in the first 20 weeks14; and 46%7, 49%15, 
50%16–18, >50%19,20, 53%21, 54%22, 60%23, >60%24, 63%25,26, 
70%27–31, 50–75%32, 76%10,33, 78%34, 80–85%35, >85%36, and 
90%37 total loss from fertilisation to term. The variance in these 
 
estimates is striking and the scale of some implausible. 90% 
 
intrauterine mortality implies a maximal live birth fecundabil-
ity of 10%, and only then if all other stages of the reproductive 
 
process are 100% efficient. Observed human fecundability is 
 
low compared to other animals21, but at approximately 20–30%9,38 
it is still higher than implied by such a high embryo mortality 
rate. Such inconsistent estimates of pregnancy loss are not reas-
suring, nor do they provide a sound basis for either a quantitative 
 
understanding of natural human reproductive biology or an unbi-
ased appraisal of artificial reproductive technologies. These 
 
divergent and excessive values therefore invite scrutiny of the 
evidence that supports them. In this article, I identify and re-
evaluate published data that contribute to claims regarding natural 
 
human embryo mortality. Using the available data, I attempt to 
answer the question: “How many human embryos die between 
 
fertilisation and birth under natural conditions?”
A quantitative framework for embryo mortality
A quantitative framework has recently been proposed to 
 
facilitate the calculation and comparison of embryo mortalities 
from fecundability and pregnancy loss data39. Briefly, the model 
comprises conditional probabilities (π) of the following biological 
 
processes: (1) reproductive behaviours resulting in sperm-
ovum-co-localisation per cycle = πSOC; (2) successful fertilisa-
tion given sperm-ovum-co-localisation = πFERT; (3) implantation 
of a fertilised ovum as indicated by increased levels of human 
 
chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) = πHCG; (4) progression of an 
implanted embryo to a clinically recognised pregnancy = πCLIN; 
(5) survival of a clinical pregnancy to live birth = πLB.
Fecundability (FEC) is the probability of reproductive success 
 
per cycle, but may take different values depending on the defini-
tion of success. The following four fecundabilities broadly follow 
Leridon (1977)38:
1. Total (all fertilisations):      FECTOT  = πSOC × πFERT
2. Detectable (implantation): FECHCG  = πSOC × πFERT × πHCG
3. Apparent (clinical):            FECCLIN  = πSOC × πFERT × πHCG × πCLIN
4. Effective (live birth):         FECLB        
= πSOC × πFERT × πHCG × πCLIN × πLB
Hence, the probability that a fertilised egg will perish prior to 
implantation is [1 - πHCG], and prior to clinical recognition is 
 
[1 - (πHCG × πCLIN)]. In theory, embryonic mortality may be esti-
mated at different stages; however, in practice, this depends on 
 
available data. Clinical and live birth fecundabilities are most 
 
easily quantified and most frequently reported. Total and detect-
able fecundabilities are less frequently reported, although of 
 
direct relevance.
BOX 1. Glossary of Key Reproductive Terms
  1.    
Ovum: A female gamete, also known as an egg or oocyte. 
Ova (pl) are produced by the ovaries of the woman.
  2.    
Spermatozoon: A male gamete. Sperm (or spermatozoa, 
pl) are produced in the testes of the man.
  3.    
Ovulation: The release of an ovum from the ovary. In 
humans, ovulation usually involves the release of a single 
egg in each menstrual cycle.
  4.    
Fallopian tube: A narrow tubular extension of the uterus, 
which opens out next to the ovary. It is also called the 
oviduct. Following ovulation, the ovum passes into the 
opening of the fallopian tube and travels towards the uterus.
  5.    
Coitus: An act of sexual intercourse between a man and 
woman, usually resulting in the deposition of sperm within 
the reproductive tract of the woman.
  6.    
Menstrual cycle: An interval of approximately 28 days, 
which commences with the onset of menstruation. Ovulation 
occurs mid-way though a menstrual cycle, approximately 
14 days before the onset of the next cycle.
  7.    
Amenorrhoea: The absence of menstruation. A missed 
menstrual period is often the first observable sign that 
pregnancy has commenced, although there are many other 
causes.
  8.    
Fertile period: The time in a woman’s menstrual cycle 
during which coitus may result in pregnancy. This period 
probably varies considerably between women. Coitus up 
to 6 days prior to and 1 day after ovulation may result in 
pregnancy although the most fertile days are the day of 
ovulation and the 2 days beforehand40.

What the data say
Publications containing data relevant to early human embryo 
 
mortality were identified primarily by manually tracing cita-
tions found in articles, reviews and textbooks. A PubMed search 
 
(“early pregnancy loss” [All Fields]) identified some, but not all 
relevant studies. Certain studies were not conducted to address the 
specific question, and others are in books or publications that are 
not adequately indexed. If not entirely complete, nevertheless the 
data presented form a substantial proportion of relevant, available 
scientific data on natural early human embryo mortality.
Studies that contribute analysis and data relevant to the quantifica-
tion of natural human embryo mortality fall into the following four 
categories and will be considered in turn.
1.  A speculative hypothesis published in The Lancet.
2.  Life tables of intra-uterine mortality.
3.  Studies of early pregnancy by biochemical detection of hCG.
4.  Anatomical studies of Dr Arthur Hertig and Dr John Rock.
1. Where have all the conceptions gone?
In 1975, a short hypothesis published in The Lancet entitled 
 
“Where Have All The Conceptions Gone?” concluded that 78% of 
all conceptions were lost before birth34. It has been widely cited 
by both scientists9,25,27,28,41 and non-scientists42,43 alike. Concep-
tions among married women aged 20–29 in England and Wales 
in 1971 were estimated and compared to infants born in the same 
 
period. In this analysis (Table 1) there are reliable values, e.g., 
census data, and simple arithmetical calculations. However, spec-
ulative values are necessary to perform the calculations. Three 
are biological: (1) fertilisation rate following unprotected coitus 
during the fertile period was estimated as 50% and supported by 
 
reference to Hertig44 (although his estimate was 84%5); (2) the 
length of a menstrual cycle (28 days); and (3) the duration of 
the fertile period (2 days). These latter values are plausible, but 
also variable (Figure 1). No justification is provided for three 
 
behavioural variables: (1) coital frequency estimated at twice 
per week; (2) proportion of unprotected coital acts estimated at 
25%; and (3) either a random or regular distribution of coital acts 
 
during menstrual cycles such that 1/14 of all coital acts fall within 
a fertile period.
The validity of Roberts & Lowe’s conclusion depends largely 
on the accuracy and precision of these speculative values. The 
 
following two simple analyses illustrate the sensitivity of their 
 
conclusion on the speculative values.
1.    
When four of the speculative values are reduced by 25% 
(e.g., coital frequency reduced to 1.5/week) and cycle 
  9.    
Fertilization: The fusion of a spermatozoon and an ovum, 
which usually takes place in the fallopian tube up to 24 
hours after ovulation.
10.    
Conception: A biologically imprecise term meaning either 
‘the coming into existence of a new human being’ or ‘the 
beginning of a pregnancy’. It is often used synonymously 
with fertilisation but may also refer to implantation.
11.    
Embryo: A newly fertilised ovum until the eighth week of 
development.
12.    
Zygote: The newly fertilised ovum: a one-cell embryo.
13.    
Blastocyst: An embryo approximately 5–6 days after 
fertilisation.
14.    
Implantation: The biological process that begins when a 
blastocyst attaches to the lining of the uterus approximately 
6–7 days after fertilisation. The embryo subsequently 
becomes embedded within the uterine lining.
15.    
Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG): A protein 
produced by the embryo. It signals to the mother that an 
embryo is present and prevents menstruation and the loss 
of the embryo. Elevated levels of hCG can be detected 
in the serum or urine of a woman from around the time of 
implantation.
16.    
Fecundability: A measure of reproductive potential. It is 
the probability of becoming pregnant in a single menstrual 
cycle. Fecundity is often used to mean the probability of 
achieving a live birth in a single cycle. A fecund cycle is 
one in which fertilisation occurs.
17.    
Pregnancy: The condition of a woman harbouring an 
embryo, fetus or unborn child. When pregnancy begins 
is a matter of some confusion7 (Figure 1). Pregnancy may 
be considered to commence with fertilisation and lasts 
approximately 38 weeks. Clinicians often time the onset 
of pregnancy from day 1 of the last menstrual cycle, 2 
weeks before fertilisation, and refer to subsequent time 
as a period of gestation. On this account, pregnancy or 
gestation lasts approximately 40 weeks. Some scientists 
and legal judgements define pregnancy as beginning with 
implantation, one week after fertilisation. This definition 
is of particular utility in the context of IVF treatment 
where evidence of implantation is the earliest sign that a 
transferred embryo has developed normally and that fertility 
treatment has, up to that point, been successful. For some 
women, the start of a pregnancy may be noted with the 
first missed menstrual period, approximately 2 weeks after 
fertilisation, or a positive pregnancy test.
18.    
Miscarriage: The premature termination of a pregnancy 
leading to loss of a developing embryo or fetus. Embryo 
loss may occur before a woman knows she is pregnant. 
Miscarriage late in pregnancy is often called abortion, 
with a cut-off of approximately 20 weeks gestation used to 
distinguish between miscarriage and abortion.
19.    
Early Pregnancy Loss: This usually refers to the loss of 
an embryo very early in pregnancy, even before a clinical 
diagnosis is made, when a woman would not be aware of 
the pregnancy. Such losses are also called occult, because 
they are hidden, or biochemical, because they can only be 
identified by detecting hCG. Pregnancy loss shortly after a 
clinical diagnosis may also be described as early.

 length increased by 10% (from 28 days to 31 days38), the 
estimate for embryo loss drops to 22%. The opposite opera-
tion (e.g., coital frequency increased to 2.5/week) results in 
an estimate of 92% (Table 1). Embryo loss of 22% is barely 
sufficient to account for observed clinical losses, and 92% 
indicates a maximum FECLB of 8%. Neither scenario is bio-
logically plausible.
2.    
A non-zero variance was applied to each speculative 
value reflecting their uncertain nature. Using the random 
 
number generator in Microsoft® Excel (Office 2010) 
simulated values were obtained by random sampling 
from normal distributions with means equal to Roberts & 
 
Lowe’s speculative values with coefficients of variation 
equal to 20%. For simplicity, it was assumed that there 
was no covariance between the different speculative val-
ues. Table 1 shows the expected range within which 95% 
of these simulated values fall (e.g., coital frequency is 
 
1.2–2.8/week). For each simulated record, a new estimate of 
embryo loss was calculated, and from 10,000 of these, the 
mean, median and 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of embryo 
loss were determined. This step was repeated 1,000 times: 
the mean value of the simulated means was 73.3% and of 
the simulated medians was 76.5%. The mean values of the 
 
2.5th and 97.5th percentile boundaries for embryo loss 
were 37% and 90% (Table 1). Separately, the same simu-
lation was performed using NONMEM 7.3.0® (Icon PLC, 
 
Dublin, Eire) to generate 100,000 data records which are 
represented in Figure 2. The code and simulated data values 
are in Dataset 1.
Figure 1. Schematic representation of timelines and key events in (A) non-fecund and (B) fecund menstrual cycles. Menstrual cycle 
lengths vary considerably and most fall within a range of 20 to 40 days45. A typical menstrual cycle is usually represented as lasting for 
 
28 days, as shown here. Differences in cycle length are mostly due to variations in the duration of the follicular phase, the time from the onset 
of menstruation to ovulation. The time from ovulation to the onset of the next cycle, the luteal phase, is more consistently 14 days. Therefore, 
in the typical 28 day cycle, ovulation occurs midway at around 14 days. The fertile period (shown in light blue) is the time during which coitus 
may result in a pregnancy. The probability of pregnancy is highest when coitus occurs in the two days leading up to ovulation40. In a normal 
fecund cycle, fertilisation occurs within hours of ovulation in the fallopian tube, after which point an embryo is present and development 
begins. Embryonic development may fail at any stage from fertilisation through to birth. 6–7 days after fertilisation, the embryo begins to 
implant in the uterine wall at which stage human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) produced by the embryo becomes detectable in urine 
or serum samples. The onset and duration of pregnancy may be defined in various ways: gestational pregnancy (typically used in clinical 
practice) is timed from the first day of the last menstrual period; developmental pregnancy begins with fertilisation; in an IVF treatment cycle, 
although an embryo is present in the uterus immediately following embryo transfer, pregnancy is not considered to be established until there 
is evidence of implantation, usually provided by elevated hCG levels. The earliest point at which a woman could observe that she is pregnant 
is approximately 14 days after ovulation/fertilisation with the first missed period. The stage at which pregnancies are clinically confirmed 
depends on study design and clinical practice, and may be at gestational day 28 (i.e., first missed menstrual period, Zinaman (1996)46, 
French & Bierman (1962)47), gestational day 42 (Wang (2003)48), or following a positive pregnancy test (Wilcox (1988)49) or satisfactory 
ultrasound scan.

The sole purpose of these simple sensitivity analyses is to illus-
trate that modest adjustments to Roberts & Lowe’s original specu-
lative values can result in any biologically plausible estimate for 
embryo loss. Whilst their analysis is useful for highlighting factors 
that influence observed fecundity, the output from the calculation 
remains substantially dependent on the subjectively selected input. 
Consequently, their analysis has no practical quantitative value.
Other sources of bias in their model include the failure to 
 
account for intentionally terminated pregnancies and the reduced 
fecundability of already pregnant women and nursing mothers. 
Despite this, it was described as “persuasive”50 and it has been 
claimed that “it is still difficult to better the original calculations 
of Roberts and Lowe (1975)”27. By contrast, others have noted 
that “their calculations can be criticized”9 and are “tenuous”51. 
Considering its quantitative limitations, it has been cited surpris-
ingly often13,28,52,53.
2. Life tables of intrauterine mortality
Constructing a life table of intrauterine mortality is challenging 
since embryonic death may occur even before the presence of an 
embryo is recognised. Nevertheless, in 1977, the distinguished 
demographer Henri Leridon published an impressive critique 
and analysis of pregnancy loss data, and a complete life table of 
intrauterine mortality26. Leridon highlighted the consequences of 
 
inappropriate analysis and the quantitative biases produced by 
 
Table 1. Numerical estimates of conceptions and their loss in married women aged 20–29 in England and Wales 
in 1971. The table replicates the values and calculations of Roberts & Lowe34 with more explanatory detail. In addition, it 
illustrates how introducing variance into speculative estimates influences the final calculated value of embryo loss. *Data 
type indicates whether the numerical value is reliable (e.g., derived from census data), the result of a simple arithmetical 
calculation, or speculative (shown in italics). §Values are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile boundaries, assuming a normal 
distribution for the variables centred on Roberts & Lowe’s values with a coefficient of variation of 20%. †Speculative 
values were adjusted either up or down by 25% compared to Roberts & Lowe’s values. Values for ‘Length of menstrual 
cycle’ were adjusted by 10%. ‡The mean values of the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile boundaries from 1,000 simulations, 
each containing 10,000 separate estimates for embryo loss. The derivation of these values is described in the text. 
Briefly, each separate estimate of embryo loss was calculated using variable speculative values that were obtained by 
random sampling from a normal distribution with a mean equal to the Roberts & Lowe value and a coefficient of variation 
of 20%. The mean value of the mean percentage loss was 73.3% and of the median was 76.5%. ¥The most frequent 
duration of a menstrual cycle is 28 days but there is substantial variability and the mean length is generally 30–31 days38.

ies, and provided detailed commentary on six published between 
1962 and 197047,54–58. These data are summarised in Figure 3

(i.e., approx. 2 weeks’ post-fertilisation, see Figure 1) will perish

Leridon described the Kauai Pregnancy Study published by 
 
French & Bierman (1962)47 in particular detail. In this study, an 
attempt was made to identify every pregnancy on Kauai from 
1953–56. Women were encouraged to enrol as soon as they missed 
a period. Pregnancy loss may therefore have been overestimated, 
since not all amenorrhoea is caused by conception, although 
other studies that relied upon medically-identified pregnancies 
probably underestimated pregnancy loss by not capturing all 
 
cases16. Whatever the truth, it is clear that, among the studies 
reviewed by Leridon, the Kauai Pregnancy Study revealed the 
 
highest levels of pregnancy loss (Figure 3).
All recorded pregnancies in the Kauai study were categorised by 
date of enrolment in four week intervals, beginning with 4–7 weeks’ 
gestation. This time-staggered approach enabled risk of miscarriage 
to be associated with stage of gestation. However, despite consid-
erable efforts, only 19% of the 3,197 recorded Kauai pregnancies 
were enrolled between 4–7 weeks’ gestation, thereby reducing the 
precision of pregnancy loss estimates for this earliest of time inter-
vals. Although pregnancies were grouped in four week periods, 
Leridon suggested that early mortality may change week by week, 
Figure 3. Graphical representation of the fate of 1,000 
pregnancies in progress at 4 weeks’ gestation (2 weeks’ post-
fertilisation). The figure is generated using values in Table 4.3 of 
Leridon (1977)26 and are derived from six different studies (see text). 
The Kauai Pregnancy Study data published by French & Bierman 
(1962)47 are shown in thick black. Data from Shapiro (1970)57 were 
analysed either with all pregnancies included (ALL) or with those 
pregnancies excluded that aborted within one week of study entry 
(EXCL.). The greater loss observed with ALL may be due to a 
correlation between study entry and abortion risk. Based on these 
data, the risk of losing a pregnancy ongoing at 4 weeks’ gestation 
ranges from 12.5% to 23.7% (excluding Shapiro (1970) ALL). Values 
are in Dataset 2.
resulting in underestimation of pregnancy loss. He re-allocated 
 
the 592 study entries and 32 pregnancy losses for weeks 4–7 
 
(Table 2) generating an overall probability of pregnancy loss dur-
ing this period of 15.0%, higher than 10.8% originally reported47. 
Leridon’s own description of this interpolation as “risky” can be 
illustrated by adjusting his re-allocation26. Transferring just two 
 
of the pregnancy losses out of or into the first week results in 
 
estimates of the 4–7 week pregnancy loss of 10.9% and 19.1%

respectively (Table 2). The validity of adjusting Leridon’s re-alloca-
tion may be questioned. However, pregnancy loss in week 4–5 of the 
 
Kauai Study would manifest as a menstrual period delayed by 
up to one week. This is far from being a robust pregnancy diag-
nosis and in a different study57, exclusion of pregnancy losses 
 
reported within one week of study entry resulted in substantially 
different loss probabilities (Figure 3) suggesting a confound-
ing correlation between entry and loss26. Nevertheless, the re- 
allocation does reinforce a concern highlighted by Leridon, 
 
namely the uncertainty that affects the first probability. Clearly, 
these estimates of early loss should be treated with caution.
A more fundamental problem is that these data offer no insight 
 
into the fate of embryos prior to the earliest possible point of 
 
clinical pregnancy detection. Leridon completed his life table 
 
with values from Hertig’s 1967 analysis5. He concluded that 
 
among 100 ova exposed to the risk of fertilisation, 16 are not 
 
fertilised, 15 die in week one (between fertilisation and implan-
tation), and 27 die in week two (between implantation and the 
 
time of the first missed period). After two weeks his life table 
 
follows the Kauai probabilities closely ending with 31 live 
births. Leridon’s table therefore indicates an embryo mortality of 
 
50% (42/84) within the first two weeks after fertilisation and a 
 
total mortality of 63% (53/84) from fertilisation to birth.
Leridon’s account of intrauterine mortality has been widely 
 
cited. However, its accuracy depends entirely on the quality and 
interpretation of the data from Hertig5 and French & Bierman47. 
French & Bierman’s approach probably resulted in an overes-
timate of total pregnancy loss and is certainly imprecise in its 
 
estimate of embryo loss in the four weeks following the first 
 
missed menstrual period. The reliability of Hertig’s estimates of 
embryo loss in the two weeks following fertilisation is considered 
below.
3. Biochemical detection of pregnancy using hCG
Quantification of pregnancy loss requires pregnancy diagnosis. 
 
The earliest outward sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual 
 
period, approximately 2 weeks after fertilisation, although 
 
amenorrhoea in women of reproductive age is not exclusively 
 
associated with fertilisation59,60. Several potentially diagnostic 
 
pregnancy-associated proteins have been identified61 of which 
only one, Early Pregnancy Factor (EPF)62, has been claimed to be 
 
produced by embryos within one day of fertilisation. However, there 
is doubt about the utility of EPF for diagnosing early pregnancy63 
and little has been published on it in the past five years.
Modern pregnancy tests detect human chorionic gonadotrophin 
(hCG), a highly glycosylated 37 kDa protein hormone produced 
by embryonic trophoblast cells64. Elevation of hCG around 6–7 
days after ovulation is associated with embryo implantation27,28,65 
(Figure 1). Early assays for the detection of hCG were prob-
ably confounded by antibody cross-reactivity with luteinizing 
 
hormone66 but modern tests are more specific and a positive 
result is a reliable indicator of early pregnancy. Highly sensitive 
assays have revealed low levels of hCG in non-pregnant women 
and healthy men67; hence, quantitative criteria and appropriate 
 
design are required to distinguish between non-pregnant women 
and those harbouring early embryos65,68,69.
Figure 4 and Table 3 summarise findings from thirteen studies 
that used hCG to identify so-called early, occult or biochemi-
cal pregnancy loss, i.e., pregnancy loss between the initiation of 
 
implantation and clinical recognition46,48,49,70–79. (Ellish et al. 
(1996)69 is not included since the hCG assay was positive for only 
72.5% of clinical pregnancies. By contrast, among the thirteen 
studies in Table 3 only one clinically-recognised pregnancy was 
 
reported undetected by hCG testing70. Nevertheless, their 
 
estimates of early pregnancy loss (17.4%) and clinical loss (13.7%) 
are comparable to these other studies.) Each study measured uri-
nary hCG levels except two, which measured hCG in serum72,73. 
Notwithstanding design and subject differences, estimates for clin-
ical pregnancy loss, ranging from 8.3% – 21.2% (Figure 4), are 
similar to previous estimates (Figure 3). Estimates for early/occult 
pregnancy loss ranged from 0% to 58.3% in studies70–74 prior to 
Wilcox (1988)49. This high variance was probably due to reduced 
specificity and sensitivity of the hCG assays and sub-optimal 
 
study design16,61,80–83. Studies from Wilcox (1988)49 onwards have

 Figure 4. Summary of findings from thirteen studies that used hCG detection to diagnose early pregnancy. Data are arranged by 
publication date and the first author of the study is shown. Three datasets are shown: (i) the percentage of at risk menstrual cycles that 
were hCG positive; (ii) the percentage of hCG positive cycles that did not manifest as clinical pregnancies = early pregnancy loss; and 
 
(iii) the percentage of clinical pregnancies lost prior to 12 or 28 weeks or live birth (definitions vary between studies). A clinical pregnancy 
may be manifest by a missed period although criteria vary between studies. Videla-Rivero et al.73, Sasaki et al.76, Cole78 and Mumford 
 
et al.79 do not report sufficient data to calculate all three values. Values are in Dataset 3.

available, mean (SD) ages of the participating women are taken directly from the published study. In some cases mean and 
SD (indicated by *) or SD (indicated by †) were estimated based on published demographic characteristics. §These data relate 
to the whole study cohort (n=124) which included known sub-fertile women, and not just to the 74 apparently fertile women. 
‡Mean value from Wilcox et al. (2001)84. ¶Some studies only provide data up to late pregnancy (e.g., up to 28 weeks) rather 
than to term. ND = no data. ¤Wilcox subsequently reported an additional hCG pregnancy which had not been detected and 
reported in the 1988 paper, making a total of 199 hCG pregnancies and 44 pre-clinical losses in the study group85. #Mumford 
reported data from aspirin- and placebo-treated subjects who had at least one prior miscarriage. Summary data from both 
treatment groups are included as there was no effect of aspirin79.

 produced more consistent data indicating early/occult pregnancy 
loss of approximately 20% (Figure 4). In the largest studies48,79 
pregnancies were clinically recognised only if they lasted ≥6 weeks 
after the onset of the last menstrual period; hence, early pregnancy 
losses in these studies included those lost up to approximately 
two weeks after a missed menstrual period. Definition of clinical 
 
pregnancies can influence comparison of study results39,82. 
For example, Wilcox originally reported 43 (later 4485) pre- 
clinical and 19 clinical losses from 198 detected pregnancies49, 
giving 21.7% early/occult and 12.3% clinical loss rates. In later 
 
reports, 4 cases were re-allocated resulting in 48 early and 15 
 
clinical losses (i.e., 24.1% early/occult and 9.9% clinical 
 
loss rates)40,86–88. Variable definitions can generate confusion, 
 
although in this case the overall picture is not greatly affected. 
 
Based on the eight most recent studies, beginning with Wilcox 
(1988), pregnancy loss from first detection of hCG through to 
live birth is approximately one third (Table 3). This is consistent 
with another recent study which found that 98 out of 301 (32.6%) 
 
singleton pregnancies diagnosed by an early positive hCG test 
 
and followed-up to either birth or miscarriage were lost89.

See README.docx for a description of the file.
The much cited Wilcox (1988) study49 is the earliest of several 
large well-designed studies that made use of a specific and sensitive 
 
hCG assay and led to numerous further publications40,84–87,90–92. 
Two other studies (Zinaman (1996)46 and Wang (2003)48) were 
similar in purpose, design and execution. These studies pro-
vide some of the best available data to calculate pregnancy loss 
 
between implantation and birth39. In each study, women intend-
ing to become pregnant and with no known fertility problems 
were recruited and hCG levels monitored cycle by cycle in daily 
urine samples until they became pregnant. Most women were fol-
lowed through to late pregnancy or birth. Although these studies 
provide evidence regarding the outcome of both clinical and hCG 
 
pregnancies, determining the fate of embryos prior to implanta-
tion is more difficult. To relate the study results to pre-implantation 
 
embryo loss, it is necessary to determine fecundability. In 
each study FECCLIN declined in successive cycles as the pro-
portion of sub-fertile women increased. Hence, reported raw 
FECHCG values of 30%46 and 40%48, and FECCLIN values of 25%49 
and 30%48 are biased underestimates of the fecundability of 
 
normal fertile women. A recent re-analysis of these data 
 
provides statistical evidence for discrete fertile and sub-fertile 
 
sub-cohorts within the study populations39. The proportions of 
 
sub-fertile women (mean [95% CI]) were estimated as 28.1% 
 
[20.6, 36.9] (Wilcox); 22.8% [12.9, 37.2] (Zinaman); and 6.0% 
[2.8, 12.3] (Wang). For normally fertile women, FECHCG was, 
respectively: 43.2% [35.6, 51.1]; 38.1% [32.7, 43.7]; and 46.2% 
[42.8, 49.6]. FECCLIN was: 33.9% [29.4, 38.6]; 33.3% [27.6, 39.6]; 
and 34.9% [33.0, 36.8]. There was no apparent difference in 
 
πCLIN between fertile and sub-fertile sub-cohorts, which was 
 
estimated as: 78.3% [69.2, 85.3]; 87.5% [76.0, 93.9]; and 75.4% 
[71.5, 79.0]39.
Why do a proportion of menstrual cycles in women attempting to 
conceive fail to show any increase in hCG? Since FECHCG = πSOC 
× πFERT × πHCG , there can be various causes for this failure includ-
ing mistimed coitus, anovulation, failure of fertilisation or pre- 
implantation embryo death. Although FECHCG puts limits on the 
extent of pre-implantation embryo loss, uncertainty in the estimates 
of πSOC, πFERT and πHCG translates into uncertainty in estimates of 
pre-implantation embryo mortality. In the Wang study, for normally 
fertile women, FECHCG = 46.2%; hence, the absolute maximum 
value for pre-implantation embryo loss must be 53.8%, although 
only if πSOC = πFERT = 1, conditions both extreme and unlikely39. 
Studies of the relationship between coital frequency and concep-
tion indicate that fecundability is greater with daily compared to 
alternate day intercourse39,93,94. Hence, when coital frequency is less 
than once per day a proportion of reproductive failure will be due to 
mistimed coitus, i.e., πSOC < 1. In the Wilcox study, coitus occurred 
on only 40% of the six pre-ovulatory days39,40, and in the Zinaman 
study participants were advised that alternate day intercourse was 
optimal46. Based on the difference in fecundability between daily 
and alternate day intercourse as modelled by Schwartz94, a value 
of πSOC = 0.80 was used to calculate pre-implantation embryo 
 
mortality39. However, this is a speculative estimate, and in reality 
the value may be higher, or lower.
A further critical missing piece of the equation is knowledge of the 
efficiencies of fertilisation and implantation under normal, natural, 
propitious circumstances. Assuming that either of these processes 
may be up to 90% efficient, and based on data from the three hCG 
studies46,48,49, a plausible range for pre-implantation embryo loss in 
normally fertile women is 10–40% and for loss from fertilisation 
to birth, 40–60%39. Even with these wide ranges of mathematically 
possible outcomes, it is clear that estimates for total embryonic loss 
of 90%37, 85%36, 83%2, 80–85%11,35, 78%34, 76%10,33 and 70%27–31 
are excessive.
In 1990, Charles Boklage concluded that “at least 73% of natu-
ral single conceptions have no real chance of surviving 6 weeks 
of gestation”10,95. Live birth fecundability was estimated as “not 
over 15%”, substantially lower than Leridon’s 31%. Despite this 
discrepancy, Boklage’s conclusions were derived from a review of 
data including several hCG studies49,65,70–73 and Leridon’s analysis26. 
He derived a model describing the survival probability of human 
embryos comprising the sum of two exponential functions:
Pt(pregnancy survival) = 0.73e-0.155t + 0.27e-0.00042t
in which t is the time in days post-fertilization. This is the source of 
the 73% in the conclusion.
There are, however, serious problems with this analysis. Firstly, 
data presented as embryo survival probabilities at different times 
post-fertilization49,65,70,71,73 are fecundabilities, i.e., successes per 
cycle, not per fertilised embryo. Secondly, for reasons that are 
unclear, data from Whittaker72 and Leridon26 were excluded 
from the modelling analysis and the data from an earlier Wilcox 
 
Page 10 of 43
F1000Research 2017, 5:2765 Last updated: 16 MAY 2019
 report65 were included twice since this preliminary data had been 
incorporated into the later report49. Thirdly, the modelled data 
 
were normalised to a survival probability of 0.287 at 21 days 
 
post-fertilization. This value was derived from data published by 
Barrett & Marshall (1969) on the relationship between coital fre-
quency and conception93. Barrett & Marshall had concluded that 
coitus during a single day alone, 2 days before ovulation, resulted in 
a conception probability of 0.30. Boklage’s value of 0.287 is his cal-
culated equivalent. However, conception in this study was “identi-
fied by the absence of menstruation, after ovulation”93. Hence, 0.30 
(and similarly, 0.287) is a clinical fecundability and not a measure 
of embryo survival. Furthermore, 0.30 is a non-maximal fecund-
ability, since it was an estimate based on coitus on a single day 
 
(2 days before ovulation) within the cycle. Barrett & Mar-
shall clearly report that as coital frequency increased so did the 
 
fecundability, up to a maximum of 0.68 associated with daily 
 
coitus93.
Boklage’s analysis can only make biological sense if it is assumed 
that every cycle in the Barrett & Marshall study resulted in fer-
tilisation. Under these circumstances, failure to detect conception 
in 71.3% (1 – 0.287) of cycles would be due entirely to embryo 
mortality. However, this is highly implausible and explicitly 
contradicted by the higher estimate of fecundability reported93. 
Boklage’s implicit assumption also contradicts his further conclu-
sion that “only 60–70% of all oocytes are successfully fertilized 
given optimum timing of natural insemination”10. The vertical nor-
malisation of the hCG study data to a value of 0.287 at 21 days is the 
principal determinant of the parameters that define the two exponen-
tial model. Any change in this value would commensurately alter 
the balance between the two implied sub-populations of embryos. 
Since it is evident that the value of 0.287 is neither an embryo sur-
vival rate nor even a maximal fecundability, it follows that quan-
titative conclusions from this analysis in relation to the survival of 
naturally conceived human embryos are of doubtful validity.
However, Boklage was right about two things. Firstly, the difficulty 
of calculating pre-clinical losses: as he put it, “In the place of the 
necessary numbers for the first few weeks of pregnancy we find 
 
editorially acceptable estimates which, while perhaps not far 
wrong, are difficult to defend with any precision”. Secondly, the 
source of some of the only directly relevant data (even though he 
excluded it from his modelling analysis), namely, “Hertig’s sample 
is, and will probably remain, unique”.
4. The anatomical studies of Dr Arthur Hertig
At the start of the 1930s, no-one had ever seen a newly fertilised 
human embryo. It was barely 60 years since Oscar Hertwig had 
first observed fertilisation in sea urchins96, and just 40 years before 
the birth in 1978 of Louise Brown, the first test tube baby97,98. In 
 
Boston, Dr Arthur Hertig and Dr John Rock’s search for early human 
embryos generated an irreplaceable collection, and set an influential 
benchmark for the scale of early human embryo mortality.
The so-called “Boston Egg Hunt” began in 193899. Hertig and Rock 
recruited 210 married women of proven fertility who presented 
for gynaecological surgery44. (In most of their publications, the 
number is given as 2105,100,101 although 211 subjects are mentioned 
elsewhere44.) Of these, 107 were considered optimal for finding 
an embryo because they apparently: (i) demonstrated ovulation; 
 
(ii) had at least one recorded coital date within 24 hours before 
or after the estimated time of ovulation; (iii) lacked pathologic 
conditions that would interfere with conception. Hertig examined 
the excised uteri and fallopian tubes, and over fifteen years found 
 
34 human embryos aged up to 17 days5,44,100–107. Of these, 24 were 
normal and 10 abnormal5,100. (There is some confusion over this: 
in three publications44,101,107, 21 embryos are described as normal 
and 13 as abnormal. It appears that the three alternatively described 
embryos (C-8299; C-8000; C-8290) were originally defined as 
abnormal based on their position or depth of implantation44.) 
 
Table 4 provides information about the 34 embryos found in these 
107 women. Although the study was primarily intended to find 
 
and describe early human embryos, Hertig subsequently used 
 
the data to derive estimates of reproductive efficiency including 
 
early embryo wastage5,100.
Hertig’s analysis5,100 relies heavily on the 15 normal and 6 abnormal 
implanted embryos found in 36 women from cycle day 25 onwards. 
Table 4. Summary of the characteristics of Hertig’s 34 embryos (values are taken from Figure 4 in Hertig et al. (1959))100.  
The embryos were collected from 107 out of 210 women. *In Hertig’s figure, day 28 of the ovulatory cycle is identified with 
day 1 of the next cycle and is the day of the presumed missed period in cases where pregnancy had commenced. The 
36 cases that provide the evidential foundation for his numerical analysis are shown in bold.

 He assumed the 6 abnormal embryos would perish around the time 
of the first period concluding that fertility (% pregnant) at this stage 
= 42% (15/36). Of the 8 pre-implantation embryos identified (7 in 
the uterus and 1 in the fallopian tubes), 4 were abnormal. Hertig 
assumed the 4 normal embryos would implant successfully but that 
some of the abnormal ones would not, such that the proportion of 
normal embryos would increase from 50% (4/8) before implantation 
to 71% (15/21) after implantation as observed. Hence, among the 
36 post-cycle day 25 cases, in addition to the 15 normal embryos, 
there must have been 15 abnormal pre-implantation embryos of 
which 60% (9/15) failed to implant and were not observed, and 
40% (6/15) did implant and were observed, although these 6 would 
have perished shortly afterwards. This left 6/36 eggs that must have 
been unfertilised. The ratio of ‘unfertilised’: ‘fertilised abnormal’: 
‘fertilised normal’ was therefore 6:15:15, matching the 16% infer-
tility (no fertilisation), 42% sterility (post-fertilisation death) and 
42% fertility (reproductive success) reported in Figure 9 of Hertig’s 
1967 article, “The Overall Problem in Man”5. This is the source 
of Hertig’s 84% fertilisation rate and 50% embryo loss before and 
during implantation, and is reproduced in Leridon’s life table26 as 
84/100 eggs surviving at time zero (ovulation and fertilisation) and 
42 surviving to 2 weeks (time of first missed period).
Hertig provides almost the entire body of evidence used to quantify 
natural human embryo loss in the first week post-fertilisation. Most 
claims regarding early human embryo mortality find their source 
here. Before considering how reliable the figures are, it is worth 
repeating Hertig’s own caveat, namely, the lack of data on the effi-
ciency of natural fertilisation5. All estimates of embryo mortality 
from fertilisation onwards are subject to commensurate inaccuracy 
in the absence of reliable fertilisation probabilities (i.e., πFERT), 
which are “surprisingly difficult to estimate”21.
There are several problems with Hertig’s analysis. As noted by 
others, the observations are cross-sectional, but the inferences are 
longitudinal108. Hertig detected 21 embryos from 36 cases (58.3%) 
from cycle day 25 onwards. If this detection rate were represent-
ative, then on average, prior to day 25, the detection rate should 
either be the same or higher; however, they are all lower, and sub-
stantially so (Table 4). Hertig suggested that this was due to the 
 
technical difficulty of finding newly fertilised embryos. 
However, the detection rate for cycle days 18–19 was good 
 
(46.7%) and embryos one or two days younger would not have 
been much smaller, at which stage the detection rate was poor 
 
(11.1%). An alternative explanation for this discrepancy might sim-
ply be random variation. Furthermore, from cycle day 25 onwards, 
embryos would probably have produced hCG and therefore 
FECHCG would have been at least 58%. This is approximately dou-
ble the equivalent values observed in more recent and robust hCG 
 
studies (Table 3) further suggesting that this subset of the data is 
not representative.
Despite having proven fertility, these women presented 
 
for gynaecological surgery which, according to Hertig, was “medi-
cally essential”99. This suggests that the women may have had sub-
optimal reproductive function, although the effect of this on the 
quantitative outcome of the study is difficult to gauge. Furthermore, 
Hertig’s reproductively ‘optimal’ coital pattern does not include 
 
2 days pre-ovulation and does include one day post-ovulation, con-
ditions which are known not to maximise fertilisation39,40,93,94,109. 
Hence, detection rates before cycle day 25 may be more representa-
tive than those after. Given the numerical discrepancies, they cannot 
both be.
Hertig does not provide error estimates with his conclusions. In 
order to estimate the precision of his derived proportions, a boot-
strap analysis was performed as follows: Hertig’s 107 optimal cases 
were categorised according to stage of cycle (Category 1 = cycle 
days 16–19 (n=24); Category 2 = cycle days 20–24 (n=47); Cate-
gory 3 = cycle days ≥25 (n=36)), and presence and type of embryos 
(Category 0 = no embryo (n=73); Category 1 = normal embryo 
(n=24); Category 3 = abnormal embryo (n=10)). Five hundred 
pseudo-datasets each containing 107 cases were generated using a 
balanced random re-sampling method using Microsoft Excel®. The 
original and pseudo datasets are in Dataset 4.

bootstrap procedure
http://dx.doi.org/10.5256/f1000research.8937.d140572
See README.docx for a description of the files.
Hertig’s numerical calculations, as detailed above, were repeated 
for each pseudo-dataset thereby generating 500 estimates for each 
parameter, from which were derived median values and [95% 
CIs] using the percentile method110: fertility = 42% [26%, 59%]; 
 
sterility = 42% [5%, 182%]; infertility = 16% [-127%, 61%]; pre-
implantation embryo survival probability = 69% [27%, 128%]; 
post-implantation to week two survival probability = 71% [50%, 
91%]; detection rate for cycle day 25 onwards = 58% [41%, 74%]. 
Median values matched estimates calculated from the original data-
set. Bootstrap 95% CIs for the day 25 detection rate (58%) matched 
those calculated using the “exact” method of Clopper & Pearson111, 
[41%, 74%], which are a little wider than those calculated using the 
“more exact” method of Agresti & Coull112, [42%, 73%]. (These 
analyses were performed using an online GraphPad® calculator 
accessed on 18th April 2017: http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/
ConfInterval1.cfm.) The congruence between these confidence 
intervals and the point estimates provides some reassurance that that 
the bootstrap procedure worked effectively. Estimates of parameters 
other than the day 25 detection rate (58%) are derived from more 
complex proportional relationships, and are therefore less precise. 
 
Table 5 reproduces a life table in the style of Leridon26 and includes 
probabilities for each reproductive step with confidence inter-
vals. These intervals (and some noted above) are impossibly wide 
 
highlighting further problems with Hertig’s analysis.
Hertig’s analysis omits 47 cases from cycle days 20–24, com-
prising 44% of his data. It is clear why he cannot use it, since all 
five embryos were normal and, given his mathematical and bio-
logical assumptions, five normal implanting embryos could not 
become 29% (6/21) abnormal post-implantation. Others have

 also noted that these “missing data are sufficient to engender an 
entirely different result”16. Furthermore, the data that define the 
50% proportion of abnormal pre-implantation embryos (i.e., 4/8) 
are so few that any numerical variation will make a substantial 
difference to derived proportions. If he had observed 3/8 abnor-
mal embryos, his estimate of pre-implantation loss would have 
been 13% rather than 30%: for 5/8 it would have been 48%, 
with a fertilisation rate of 111%, which is clearly impossible. 
 
It seems therefore, that Hertig designed his analysis based on a 
post-hoc examination and selective use of the data. His own caveat 
about the lack of relevant and necessary data should be taken at 
least as seriously as his conclusions.
Hertig and Rock’s contribution to human embryology is undeniable 
and their quantitative conclusions have profoundly influenced our 
impression of the extent of early human embryo mortality. Regret-
tably, their estimates have a cripplingly low precision, which under-
mines their biological credibility or utility. In conclusion, Hertig’s 
data and flawed analysis cannot be regarded as a reliable quanti-
tative foundation upon which to evaluate and understand natural 
human reproduction.
Discussion
Answering the question “How many fertilised human embryos die 
before or during implantation under natural conditions?” is dif-
ficult. Relevant, credible data are in short supply. Among regularly 
cited publications, the Lancet hypothesis34 is entirely speculative 
and in the view of the current author should cease to be used as an 
authoritative source. Clinical pregnancy studies are only useful for 
quantifying clinical pregnancy loss and contribute nothing to esti-
mates of embryo mortality in the first two weeks’ post-fertilisation. 
 
Even Hertig’s unique dataset is inadequate to draw quantitative 
conclusions and oft-repeated values should be treated with scepti-
cism. The hCG studies from 1988 onwards provide the best data for 
estimating embryo mortality although a lack of information on fer-
tilisation success rates5,16,21,23,113 prevents satisfactory completion of 
the calculations. A recent re-analysis of these data proposed plausi-
ble limits for reproductively normal women indicating that approxi-
mately 10–40% of embryos perish before implantation and 40–60% 
do so between fertilisation and birth39. However, these ranges are 
wide, particularly for pre-implantation mortality, reflecting the lack 
of appropriate data. Is there any possibility of narrowing down the 
numbers?
In the 1980s, two separate groups collected embryos from women 
following carefully timed artificial insemination as part of fertil-
ity treatment. Insemination around the time of ovulation in women 
of proven fertility was followed 5 days later by uterine lavage to 
recover ova114–117. These data appear to hold promise for determin-
ing fertilisation efficiency and some authors have made quantitative 
inferences about embryo mortality from them24,27,28. However, such 
inferences are complicated by numerous confounding factors. For 
example, in one series116, from 88 uterine lavages following artifi-
cial insemination by donor (AID), 4 unfertilised eggs, 6 fragmented 
eggs, and 27 embryos from 2 cell to blastocyst stage were retrieved. 
In the 51 cycles in which no egg or embryo was retrieved, there was 
one retained pregnancy suggesting that the lavage and ova retrieval 
efficiency was reasonably high, albeit not perfect. These data there-
fore suggest that FECTOT was low (≈31/88 = 35%) although a pro-
portion of fertilised eggs may have completely degenerated within 
the first 5 days. Assuming πSOC was high (given the targeted insemi-
nation), this suggests that πFERT ≈ 50%. In the context of the recent 
analysis39, this implies that πHCG is high and that levels of embryo 
mortality are therefore towards the lower end of the 10–40% and 
Table 5. Life Table of egg survival and probabilities during the first two weeks of development derived solely from Hertig’s 
data. The table is modelled on Leridon’s life table26 and includes his values for survivors and data from Hertig5. Probabilities are also 
shown for each stage of the early development process. Medians and 95% confidence intervals derived from a bootstrap analysis of 
Hertig’s data indicate the precision in the estimates for fertilisation and embryo loss in the first two weeks. *Although Leridon’s values 
are based on Hertig, they do not fully match. Leridon reports losses of 15 and 27 in the first and second weeks respectively. However, 
Hertig’s 60% loss of abnormal pre-implantation embryos implies 25 (0.6 × 42) losses in the first week leaving 58, and 16 (58 × (6/21)) 
losses in the second week, leaving 42. ¥A value of πSOC = 0.90 was used to avoid the calculation of probabilities greater than 1.

 40–60% ranges. However, the clinical pregnancy rate following 
transfer of the embryos was only 40%. This is equivalent to πHCG × 
πCLIN. If πCLIN ≈ 75%, as suggested by the hCG studies (Table 3), this 
would mean that πHCG ≈ 50%. This would imply that πFERT is high, 
fertilised egg degeneration is high, occurs before day 5 and was 
therefore unobserved, and hence levels of embryo mortality tend 
towards the upper end of the 10–40% and 40–60% ranges.
It is possible that the lavage/transfer procedure reduced implanta-
tion and early developmental efficiency thereby reducing πHCG × 
πCLIN. A comparison of AID pregnancy rates may provide some 
insight as suggested by the authors116. The clinical pregnancy rate 
in their pharmacologically unstimulated cohort was 12.5% (11/88) 
which is lower than an equivalent 18.9% observed for fresh semen 
AID118, and also the live birth rate (which also incorporates clinical 
pregnancy losses) of 14.7% reported by the HFEA for AID in 2012 
in unstimulated women aged 18–34119. These different success 
rates suggest that the lavage/transfer procedure did adversely affect 
implantation and early gestation with clear implications for quan-
titative extrapolation. Furthermore, the women who were embryo 
recipients were receiving fertility treatment and their overall fertil-
ity may have been lower than expected in a normal healthy cohort. 
In summary, it seems that there are too many unresolved variables 
in these data to narrow down estimates of fertilization (πFERT) or 
implantation (πHCG) rates.
With high fecundability, the range of possible embryo mortality 
rates falls. Red deer hinds have pregnancy rates of >85% follow-
ing natural mating120: establishing numerical limits for embryo 
mortality under these efficient reproductive circumstances is more 
straightforward. By contrast, humans lack the instinct to mate 
predominantly during fertile periods thereby reducing observed 
reproductive efficiency substantially. In studies of early pregnancy 
loss, owing to sub-optimal coital frequency and cohorts including 
sub-fertile couples, natural fecundability was almost certainly not 
 
maximised39. Combining data on coital frequency and hCG ele-
vation may help to address this. In 1995, applying the Schwartz 
model94 to his 1988 hCG data49, Wilcox calculated a FECHCG value 
of 36% for high coital frequencies (>4 days with intercourse in 6 
pre-ovulatory days)40. However, the Schwartz model assumed that 
cycle viability was evenly distributed among couples, a condition 
which the authors recognised was not true and is contradicted by a 
subsequent analysis which suggests that approximately a quarter of 
the Wilcox cohort was sub-fertile39. If possible, focussing analytical 
attention on normally fertile women with the highest coital frequen-
cies may help to narrow the range of plausible embryo mortality.
In this review of natural early embryo mortality no use has been 
made of data from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and associated labo-
ratory studies. Sub-optimal conditions for embryo culture mean 
that it was121,122 and probably still is123 doubtful that reliable values 
 
can be extrapolated from laboratory in vitro to natural in vivo 
circumstances28. Importantly, the reproductive stages are also 
altered. In IVF, πSOC = 1 and for transferred embryos πFERT = 1. Fur-
thermore, transferred embryos are selected based on quality crite-
ria, however inexact those may be123,124. IVF program manipulations 
may reduce πHCG compared to natural circumstances6 and implanta-
tion failure remains a substantial issue for IVF125,126. Although for 
IVF cycles, the reported live birth rate per cycle has gone up (from 
14% in 1991 to 25.4% in 2012119), comparison of IVF success rates 
and natural live birth fecundability values involves too many unde-
fined variables to shed numerical light on early natural embryo 
development and mortality.
In vitro fertilisation per se may provide some insight into values of 
πFERT, since πSOC = 1, and successful fertilisation can be observed. 
In seven studies of natural cycle IVF, fertilisation was successful 
in 70.9% (443/625) of attempts127–133. If this represented natural, 
in vivo fertilisation, based on the recent analysis39, it implies that 
πHCG ≈ 0.75, focusing estimates for pre-implantation embryo loss 
on 25%, and for total loss on 50%. However, high frequencies of 
chromosomal aberrations caused by the in vitro handling of human 
oocytes134 can render any comparison of natural and assisted repro-
duction open to criticism9.
In calculating summary values of embryo mortality, it is important 
to note that human fertility is as numerically heterogeneous as it 
could possibly be. Some couples are infertile and some are highly 
fertile. Excessive attention to averages and neglect of variances fos-
ters a misleading appreciation of reality. The hCG studies clearly 
had both fertile and sub-fertile participants: use of overall values 
underestimated fecundability for the fertile majority39. Furthermore, 
apparently ‘optimal’ conditions for conception may not maximise 
human biological fecundability. Other biological factors also con-
tribute to reproductive heterogeneity in humans; however, even after 
controlling for age-related decline, fecundability remains highly 
variable119,135. For intercourse occurring 2 days prior to ovulation, 
average fecundabilities resembled those previously published88, but 
for couples at the 5th and 95th percentiles, fecundabilities were 5% 
and 83%. 83% fecundability implies a very low embryo mortal-
ity rate. In conclusion, apparent low fecundability in humans need 
not necessarily be caused by embryo mortality, but also defects of 
ovulation, mistimed coitus, or fertilisation failure39. Where fecund-
ability is low, any or all of these factors may contribute.
Embryo mortality and pregnancy loss are not only a matter of aca-
demic scientific interest, and diverse quantitative estimates can also 
be found in popular media. For example, 70% loss in the first six 
days is claimed by Michael Mosley in “You made it through the 
first round” (http://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/z84tsg8; transcript 
at 
http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/z3b87hv/transcript: 
accessed on 20th April, 2017). By contrast a 25% pre-implantation 
loss is reported by the Science Museum’s online exhibit, “Who Am 
I?”

): accessed on 20th April, 2017). News reports, 
often associated with ethical controversies, also feature estimates 
of embryo loss. On 1st February 2016, James Gallagher reported 
that only 13/100 fertilised eggs develop beyond 3 months (http://
www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35459054): accessed on 20th April, 
2017) and on 4th May 2016, Sarah Knapton reported in the online 
Daily Telegraph that “two thirds of pregnancies fail because the 
embryo does not implant properly” (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/
science/2016/05/04/human-embryos-kept-alive-in-lab-for-unprec-
edented-13-days-so-sci/): accessed on 20th April, 2017). In an 
ethical advocacy video, Bill Nye (“The Science Guy”) begins by 
claiming that “Many, many, many, many more hundreds of eggs 
are fertilized than become humans” (https://www.youtube.com/

 considered the significance of the scale of embryo loss. Given the 
breadth of societal interest in this facet of human reproductive biol-
ogy, it is vital that scientists report plausible and defensible esti-
mates for natural embryo mortality. Above all, it is obvious that 
women wishing to have children deserve reliable and unbiased esti-
mates of reproductive success and pregnancy failure.
Pregnancy loss and embryo mortality under natural conditions are 
real and substantial. However, estimates of 90%37, 85%36, 80%11,35, 
78%34, 76%10,33 and 70%27–31 total loss are excessive and not sup-
ported by available data. Estimates for clinical pregnancy loss are 
approximately 10–20%. For women of reproductive age, losses 
between implantation and clinical recognition are approximately 
10–25%. Loss from implantation to birth is approximately one 
third39,46,48,49.
Natural pre-implantation embryo loss remains quantitatively 
 
undefined. In the absence of knowledge of πSOC and πFERT it is 
almost impossible to estimate precisely. Hertig’s estimate is 30%; 
 
however, mathematically and biologically implausible confi-
dence intervals [-28%, 73%] betray the quantitative weaknesses 
 
in his data and analysis. The best available data for quantify-
ing early pregnancy loss are from studies monitoring daily 
 
hCG levels in women attempting to conceive. A recent re-analysis39 
of data from three studies46,48,49 concluded that, in normal healthy 
women, 10–40% is a plausible range for pre-implantation 
 
embryo loss and overall pregnancy loss from fertilisation to 
 
birth is approximately 40–60%. This latter range is consistent 
 
with Kline’s estimate of 50%16, and similar to, although a little 
 
narrower than the 25–70% suggested by Professor Robert 
Edwards136.
In the absence of suitable data to quantify pre-implantation loss, 
many published articles and reviews merely restate previously pub-
lished values11,28,29. It has been suggested that “claimed research 
findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing 
bias”137. Widely held views on early embryo mortality may reflect 
an entrenched and biased view of the biology. For example, the 
Macklon “Black Box” review28 has been cited 212 times (Web of 
ScienceTM citations on 12th April 2017) with many articles explic-
itly referencing its 30% survival/70% failure values13,29,125,138–146. 
Macklon’s quantitative summary in his “Pregnancy Loss Iceberg” 
(30% implantation failure; 30% early pregnancy loss; 10% clinical 
 
miscarriage; 30% live births) is a direct, unedited reproduc-
tion of estimates published over 10 years previously27. 30% pre-
implantation loss fairly represents Hertig’s conclusions although, 
as has been shown, this estimate is highly imprecise. However, 
 
Macklon misrepresents the best data which he reviews46,49. Wilcox 
reports early pregnancy loss (i.e., [1 - πCLIN]) of 21.7% whereas 
Macklon’s iceberg implies that 43% (30/70) of implanting embryos 
fail before clinical recognition. The iceberg’s clinical loss rate of 
25% (10/40) is also higher than relevant data indicate (Figure 3 
& Figure 4). Total loss of implanting (hCG+) embryos (i.e., [1 - 
(πCLIN × πLB]) is 57% (40/70) according to the iceberg. By contrast, 
 
Wilcox49 and Zinaman46, both included in Macklon’s review, 
 
report that only 31% of hCG positive pregnancies fail.
Early pregnancy loss of 10–25% is not trivial. Despite difficul-
ties associated with extrapolating in vitro observations to in vivo 
circumstances, implantation is clearly a crucial biological milestone 
 
in embryonic development and pregnancy. Recent studies 
 
suggest that biological mediators from embryos may regulate 
endometrial receptivity resulting in selective implantation of fitter 
embryos18,147,148. Interestingly, supernatant from developmentally 
impaired IVF embryos deemed unsuitable for transfer provoked 
a different response in endometrial cells compared to supernatant 
from developmentally competent embryos that produced an ongo-
ing pregnancy after transfer18. However, it would be of interest to 
 
compare these responses to that provoked by supernatant from 
developmentally competent embryos that did not successfully 
implant and produce an ongoing pregnancy. Arrested or develop-
mentally impaired embryos may lose cellular integrity and release 
mediators that disrupt endometrial receptivity; however, the intrinsic 
 
developmental competence of such embryos must also determine 
the success of implantation. Implantation failure is a substantial 
issue for IVF125, and distinguishing between obviously impaired 
and competent embryos is not the principal challenge, but rather 
 
distinguishing from among apparently competent embryos those 
that will successfully implant and those that will not. Striking 
evidence suggests that only 9% of IVF embryos have a normal 
 
karyotype in all their cells145,149 raising the possibility that the 
rate of aneuploidy in IVF embryos is artefactually high, or that a 
 
degree of mosaic aneuploidy in human embryos is not necessar-
ily developmentally deleterious, or indeed both. Implantation 
 
failure of a normal embryo may well be an uncommon event51, but 
defining what is normal is a considerable scientific and conceptual 
challenge.
If Macklon’s28 (and Chard’s27) 70% estimate for embryo loss is 
excessive, as the data suggest, this casts doubt on claims125,143 that 
the frequency of embryonic abnormalities observed in vitro is rep-
resentative of the natural in vivo situation. In turn, this implies that 
many of the chromosomal abnormalities observed in in vitro human 
embryos may be, to a greater extent than currently recognised125, an 
artefact of the clinical and experimental interventions of assisted 
reproductive technologies.
This is not the first time that attention has been drawn to unsatisfac-
tory estimates of early embryo loss. Faced with some of the same 
data, others have noted that “a claim of ‘no significant difference’ 
might easily be sustained against any interpretation proffered”16 
and that estimates are “difficult to defend with any precision”10. 
Conclusions have been based on “poor estimates of fertiliza-
tion failure rate and the mortality at 2 weeks after fertilisation”23 
and drawn “from unusual or biased samples”150. Nevertheless, 
although precision may be elusive, exaggeration can be avoided. It 
is hoped that this critical re-evaluation of the data describing early 
 
human embryo mortality will serve as a robust foundation upon 
which to make informed biological, ethical, legal and personal 
judgements.

Dr. Jarvis assesses the empirical support for the belief that there is a “great deal” of fetal wastage in
humans. His conclusion is that there is less wastage than is often believed and that the percent loss
between conception and birth is 40-60%. Resolution of this issue is important, as it has substantial
implications for our understanding of early human development.
Dr. Jarvis describes present understanding as (p. 2):
          Among reputable scientific publications, including medical and reproductive biology text books,
scientific reviews and primary research articles, reported mortality estimates include: 30–70% before and
during implantation; >50%, 73% and 80% before the 6th week; 75% before the 8th week; 70% in the first
trimester; 40– 50% in the first 20 weeks; and 49%, >50%, 53%, 54%, 60%, >60%, 63%, 70%, 50–75%,
76%, 78%, 80–85%, >85%, and 90% total loss from fertilisation to term.
He states (p. 2) that four types of evidence underlie these claims:
A speculative hypothesis published in The Lancet.
Life tables of intra-uterine mortality.
Studies of early pregnancy by biochemical detection of hCG.
Anatomical studies of Dr Arthur Hertig and Dr John Rock.
On the basis of his review of this evidence, Dr. Jarvis concludes (p. 12) that “….10-40% is a plausible
range for pre-implantation embryo loss and overall pregnancy loss from fertilization to birth is
approximately 40-60%.” 
This means that the best estimate of pre-birth mortality according to Dr. Jarvis is consistent with many
previous estimates. In order to understand this consistency, it is useful to examine these types of
evidence and what Dr. Jarvis makes of each. I discuss them in turn.
The Lancet article is Roberts & Lowe (1975). These authors concluded (p. 498) from their “speculative”
1. 
analysis of the number of married women age 20-29 in England and Wales and of the number of live and
dead births that 78% of conceptions are lost. In order to generate this estimate, the authors estimated
the number of conceptions in any given year (based on the number of sexual encounters, probability of
fertilization, etc.). Dr. Jarvis assesses the influence of changing the number of conceptions on the
estimate of fetal wastage and shows (p. 3) that a low estimate of the number of conceptions results in an
estimate of 22% conceptions lost and that a high estimate of the number of conceptions results in an
estimate of 92% loss. He also generates a 95% confidence interval for the loss percentage of 37% - 90%
by doing a simulation in which each value contributing to the number of conceptions is
normally-distributed with a mean identical to Roberts and Lowe’s value and a coefficient of variation of
20%. On this basis, he concludes about Roberts and Lowe’s analysis that (p. 1) it “….has no quantitative
value.” and that (p. 4) it “….has no practical quantitative value”.
Dr. Jarvis provides a useful sensitivity analysis of Roberts and Lowe’s estimate, which should be taken
seriously by those who may believe that their analysis is definitive (their paper has been cited more than
300 times, with many citations that point to the 78% estimate). That said, Dr. Jarvis’ conclusion that
Roberts and Lowe’s analysis is quantitatively useless is itself incoherent. A number is a number and as a
starting point, their estimate is useful although limited. If their analysis lacks “practical quantitative value”
so too does the analysis of Dr. Jarvis. After all, there is no empirical basis for his assumptions about the
statistical independence of the components contributing to his estimate of percentage or that these
components are normally-distributed or that they have a coefficient of variation of 20%. It is not as though
simply making arbitrary assumptions about the variability of parameters somehow means that an analysis
is more quantitatively useful than one without such assumptions. The point is that both analyses have
value. It is telling in this regard that their estimate is “close” to Dr. Jarvis’ estimate. In fact, one could
Page 21 of 43
F1000Research 2017, 5:2765 Last updated: 16 MAY 2019
  
value. It is telling in this regard that their estimate is “close” to Dr. Jarvis’ estimate. In fact, one could
readily claim that Dr. Jarvis’s analysis validates Roberts and Lowe’s estimate in as much as their estimate
is within the 95% confidence interval he generates.
By way of understanding Robert and Lowe’s self-described “speculative” work, it is important to note it
belongs to the voluminous “gray” literature relating to human pregnancy. This is the literature that is
published without much review (if any) and without much requirement for rigor and data. To see this, one
need go farther than this passage (p. 498):
          Animal studies, which allow a more systematic investigation of [pregnancy loss], have shown
detectable prenatal losses ranging from 15 to 60% in domestic cattle, sheep, and pigs and in wild forms
such as stoats, rats, squirrels, and rabbits.
They cite Austin (1972) for this claim. He merely states (p. 134): 
          The data show that prenatal losses ranging between 15 and 60 per cent occur in cattle, sheep and
pigs, as well as in wild forms such as stoats, rats, squirrels and rabbits.
No data are cited! In fact, Austin’s gloss on the loss percentage for domesticated species is reasonably
accurate (Casida, 1953; First & Eyestone, 1988; Lasley, 1957) although there are less data than one
might imagine. It is of note that these species have been selected for offspring production and so how
relevant these data are is not completely resolved. Perhaps fetal wastage in their wild relatives would be
greater. My guess is that the data alluded to as being from “wild forms” are in papers such as those by
Brambell (1942, 1948). That said, to my knowledge, it is not clear that such studies reliably account for
early gestational losses. More generally, there are few “wild forms” for which there are estimates.
The overall point is that Robert and Lowe’s paper contains a disconnection between data and conclusions
that would be sustained even if one read the cited source. Their paper is best viewed as a heuristic
exercise. This is not a criticism. It is meant to underscore that Dr. Jarvis’ conclusion that their paper is
“useless” treats it as something that it isn’t. We are ignorant of the training of Drs. Robert and Lowe but
like many authors of the gray literature concerning pregnancy, they may have lacked rigorous training in
research practice and data analysis. This is not inherently bad, as long as the nature of such publications
is properly understood. As a community of scientists, we can make use of their insight into human
pregnancy as long as its potential limitations are understood. We need all the help we can get!
The “life tables of intra-uterine mortality” are French & Bierman (1962) and Léridon (1977).The former
2. 
study is an analysis of pregnancies in Kauai, Hawaii; the authors’ conclusion was that approximately 24%
of the pregnancies registered with an estimated gestational age of greater than four weeks would die.
Léridon married this result with the data of Hertig, Rock, Adams, & Menkin (1959), which provide an
estimate of wastage prior to four weeks, to infer that 63% of conceptions die before birth (Table 4.20, p.
81). Dr. Jarvis’ cautions about the assumptions that underlie this estimate are reasonable. That said, it is
important to note that the Léridon’s chapter (“Intrauterine Mortality”, pp. 48-81) is no casual exercise. It is
the longest chapter in the book and an open-minded reader can see that Table 4.20 is based upon
reasonable assumptions that Léridon clearly states do not have as much of a solid empirical basis as
would be desired. Unfortunately, Dr. Jarvis’ sole mentions of Léridon’s caveats are a statement (p. 5) in
which
Léridon describes (p. 56) an interpolation he makes (in his analysis of French and Bierman’s data) as
“risky” and another in which his (Dr. Jarvis) reanalyses of the French and Bierman data (p. 5) “reinforce a
concern highlighted by Léridon”. To this extent, a reader of Dr. Jarvis’ paper could easily come away with
the mistaken belief that Léridon’s analysis is superficial at best. As in the case of Roberts and Lowe’s

the mistaken belief that Léridon’s analysis is superficial at best. As in the case of Roberts and Lowe’s
estimate, it is important to note that Léridon’s estimate of conceptions lost of 63% is close to Dr. Jarvis’
estimate of 40-60%.
“Studies of early pregnancy by biochemical detection of hCG.” The modern pregnancy test is based
3. 
upon an assay of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), an oligosaccharide glycoprotein hormone
produced by embryonic cells. An elevated level of hCG is detectable six to fourteen days
post-conception (Nepomnaschy, Weinberg, Wilcox, & Baird, 2008; Wilcox, Baird, & Weinberg,1999). By
this time, most embryos capable of implantation will have done so. Unfortunately, earlier pre-implantation
detection of pregnancy based upon assay of the “Early Pregnancy Factor”, a heat-shock protein
expressed within 48 hours of conception, is not in widespread use (Clarke, 1997; Fan & Zheng,
1997; Morton, Rolfe, & Cavanagh, 1992; Rolfe, 1982; Shahani, Moniz, Chitlange, & Meherji, 1991;
Shahani, Moniz, Gokral, & Meherji, 1995; Smart, Fraser, Roberts, Clancy, & Cripps, 1982). Dr. Jarvis
correctly describes the pioneering hCG results of Wilcox
 (1988) and others (as summarized in Table
 et al.
3), which indicate that the percentage loss of conceptions after hCG detection is between approximately
20 and 60%, with many estimates between 30 and 40%; Dr. Jarvis concludes (p. 6) that this percentage
loss is approximately 33%.
Dr. Jarvis goes on to estimate that the “…loss from fertilization to birth [is] 40- 60%”; this is based on the
combination of three estimates based on hCG assay of percentage loss from conception to birth (35.7%:
Wang 
, 2003; 31.3%: 31.3%: Wilcox 
, 1988; 31.3% Zinaman, Clegg, Brown, O’Connor,
et al.
et al.
& Selevan, 1996) and his estimate (pp. 7-8) that the efficiency of implantation of embryos “…may be up to
90% efficient….” in order. He concludes that higher estimates of loss from fertilization to birth from the
literature are “excessive”.
Dr. Jarvis’ estimate is likely an underestimate. There is strong circumstantial evidence that many more
than 10% of embryos do not successfully implant, as discussed below. The implication of this is that Dr.
Jarvis’ estimate and the previous estimates are consistent. It is also worth noting that Dr. Jarvis uses
an arbitrary estimate for implantation rate, even though he judges other analyses to be useless because
they contain an arbitrary parameter estimate. 
Dr. Jarvis goes on to criticize Boklage (1990) who estimated the percentage of unsuccessful conceptions
based on an analysis of hCG data (see his Figure 2, p. 84). Dr. Jarvis is right to raise concerns (p. 8) that
Boklage’s analysis is less definitive than desired. In particular, he states (p. 8) that Boklage’s
assumption that the 21-day survival rate of conceptions is 28.7% is based upon a misinterpretation of a
previous study. That said, Dr. Jarvis makes an unsubstantiated conclusion (p. 8) that “…quantitative
conclusions from [Boklage’s] analysis in relation to the survival of naturally conceived human embryos are
of doubtful validity”. This may be true, but this remains to be seen given the lack of any demonstration of
the sensitivity of Boklage’s quantitative conclusions to changes in the underlying assumptions. Boklage’s
analysis needs more careful scrutiny than given by Dr. Jarvis. For example, Boklage presents a formula
for the percentage loss of conceptions as a function of time (p. 84). Are the coefficients estimated via a
standard statistical approach such as maximum likelihood estimation and chosen via a likelihood ratio test
or via comparison of AIC values associated with competing models? This is not clear. As such, it
is unclear as to what to make of the predictions even putting aside Dr. Jarvis’ concerns about the
biological validity of some of the underlying data. The equation appears to be based upon the assumption
that a cohort of embryos is an admixture of those that are likely to die before six weeks and those that
will survive longer. The basis for this assumption is unclear. The lack of transparency of Boklage’s
equation is underscored by the fact that Dr. Jarvis does not mention that it predicts 75.8 percent fetal
wastage between conception and full-term birth (270 days). As above, this estimate is rightly or wrongly
Page 23 of 43
F1000Research 2017, 5:2765 Last updated: 16 MAY 2019
  
wastage between conception and full-term birth (270 days). As above, this estimate is rightly or wrongly
consistent with most
previous estimates.
The “anatomical studies of Dr Arthur Hertig and Dr John Rock” are investigations of conceptions
4. 
recovered from uteri obtained via gynecologic surgery. Their results are summarized in Hertig et al. 
(1959); Hertig & Rock, (1973); Hertig, (1967). As described by Dr. Jarvis (p. 9), Hertig 
’s
et al.
conclusion is that 50% of embryos will die within two weeks after conception. 
Dr. Jarvis’ is correct to point out concerns about their conclusion, although we believe that it has been well
recognized that it is “impressionistic” as opposed to something that has a solid quantitative underpinning.
Of course, as noted by Dr. Jarvis, their work remains important. 
Dr. Jarvis makes some assertions about Hertig 
’s work that seem mainly intended to accentuate
et al.
doubts about it as opposed to placing it in proper context. He notes correctly (p. 9) that the sample is
cross-sectional and not longitudinal. Given the nature of this study, this was unavoidable. Dr. Jarvis notes
there are some unresolved discrepancies among age-specific detection rates for embryos and also
between the estimated implantation rate and the rate inferred from other studies. These are worth
mentioning but the implications of these discrepancies remain ambiguous in the absence of a quantitative
analysis that accounts for sampling variation.
Similarly un-useful is Dr. Jarvis’ statement (p. 9) that “Despite having proven fertility, these women
presented with gynaecological problems, suggesting suboptimal reproductive function.” There is a wide
range of “gynaecological problems” and an unanchored assertion that such a broad category might result
in “sub-optimal reproductive function” means nothing in the absence of evidence that whatever problems
were present had some influence on embryonic viability. In an effort to “estimate the precision” of the
various proportions presented by Hertig 
 (e.g., the survival rate to implantation), Dr. Jarvis generated
et al.
500 so called “bootstrap” samples from the original data consisting of 107 cases. These samples arise
from sampling with replacement of the original data (e.g., see Efron & Tibshirani, 1986; Efron, 1987).
Such an investigation is worthwhile, although a bootstrap analysis is not a “cure” for small sample size. In
any case, Dr. Jarvis’ analyses of the bootstrap results are incorrect. He describes (p. 10) “95% CIs”
for various proportions that are outside of the range of 0-100%. For example, the confidence interval (p.
10) he provides for pre-implantation embryo survival probability is 27-128%. Such an interval cannot be
generated by a correct bootstrap analysis. There are various ways to calculate a bootstrap
confidence interval (Efron & Tibshirani, 1986). The simplest, known as the “percentile method”, generates
a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for a proportion directly from the range of proportions associated with
the central 95% of the bootstrap estimates. Accordingly, the confidence interval must be between 0 and
100% because each of the bootstrap samples must generate a proportion between 0 and 100%. Dr.
Jarvis’ mistake appears to be that he estimated an average proportion and its variance from the ensemble
of bootstrap estimates and then calculated the confidence interval using standard formulae (p. 10). The
purpose of bootstrap estimation is to avoid such calculations, which can generate inaccurate
confidence intervals. Although some of the bootstrap confidence intervals provided by Dr. Jarvis do not
fall below 0% or surpass 100%, we guess that all of them are incorrectly calculated. Unfortunately, the
incorrect confidence intervals are described by Dr. Jarvis (p. 12) as “mathematically and biologically
implausible” and taken to “….betray the quantitative weaknesses in [Hertig 
’s] data and analysis.”
et al.
Indeed, they are “mathematically and biologically implausible” but the reason is that they were not
correctly calculated. Whatever bearing a bootstrap analysis has on our understanding of the “precision” of
Hertig 
’s data and analyses remains to be seen.
et al.

Hertig 
’s data and analyses remains to be seen.
et al.
Dr. Jarvis’ central argument is that there is more ambiguity associated with estimates of fetal wastage in
humans and that this ambiguity is not widely understood. Many of his concerns should be taken seriously.
Nonetheless, his analysis is undermined by errors of analysis and overstatement. In the end, his estimate
of fetal wastage from conception to birth is consistent with many of the previous estimates.
Dr. Jarvis’ analysis is also undermined by an incorrect dismissal of data from embryos created via
assisted reproductive technology (ART), which he refers to as 
 fertilization (IVF). On page 11, he
in vitro
alludes to “…sub-optimal conditions for embryo culture…” and implies that somehow ART embryos are
“different” in undefined ways from naturally-conceived embryos that negate their potential use in regard to
estimating fetal wastage. This is an exercise in rhetoric, not a scientific argument. It is true that ART
embryos are different from natural embryos in ways that could influence an estimate of fetal wastage.
However, it is essential to note that they constitute the best available sample for insight into the “black
box” of early pregnancy, despite the possible biases they may have that could distort our view into the
black box. To this extent, it is best to assess what information they can provide about fetal wastage, rather
than provide tenuous or irrelevant reasons as to why they are not useful.
Dr. Jarvis mistakenly assumes (p. 11) that only ART embryos transferred into mothers would provide
information about fetal wastage. In fact, as Dr. Jarvis notes, there are a number of reasons why
transferred embryos are not representative of all embryos (e.g., conscious or unconscious quality biases,
sex selection) and accordingly, this kind of sample could be misleading. That said, studies of such
samples suggest that at least some aspects of their biology are identical to that of naturally-conceived
embryos. For example, the sex ratio at birth for ART embryos is statistically identical with that of natural
conceptions (Orzack 
, 2015).
et al.
More importantly, the entire ensemble of ART embryos (untransferred and transferred) provides
information about fetal wastage. Almost all ART embryos undergoe testing for chromosomal
abnormalities, such as aneuploidy. The consequences of aneuploidy are well-known – it results in almost
certain death before birth. This is consistent with the fact that many spontaneous abortions
are karyotypically abnormal (Boué, Boué, & Lazar, 1967, 1975; Jauniaux & Burton, 2005). To this extent,
the frequency of such abnormalities provides strong circumstantial evidence as to the amount of fetal
wastage. Orzack 
(2015) investigated a sample of ART embryos whose karyotypes were assayed via
et al. 
FISH or CGH and reported that 84,881 out of 139,704 embryos contained at least one aneuploid
chromosome. The implied percentage of fetal wastage (60.8%) is remarkably consistent with the central
tendency of the many reports that Dr. Jarvis dismisses as unreliable, as well as with his own estimate. As
noted, we need to be cautious about inferences from this sample but not avoid making them. There is no
compelling reason to think that “suboptimal” conditions for embryo culture (if any) cause many
chromosomal abnormalities, most of which very likely arise during meiosis (e.g., Hassold & Hunt, 2001;
Hunt & Hassold, 2007; Jones, 2008; Nagaoka, Hassold, & Hunt, 2012). What deserves scrutiny
are whether the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities is elevated by techniques for collecting eggs
and/or because women providing them for use in ART are unrepresentative of all reproductive women.
There are limited data that unstimulated and stimulated oocytes have similar frequencies of
abnormality (Labarta 
, 2010). Of course, women using ART are often older than many typical
et al.
mothers. However, a high frequency of karyotypic abnormality is also observed among oocytes from
young women (Baart
, 2006; Munné
, 2006). These concerns should continue to be investigated
 et al.
 et al.
but they in no way imply that ART embryos cannot provide useful insights about early
human development and fetal wastage, especially given the current lack and very likely continuing lack of
a large sample of naturally-conceived human embryos.

We see then a web of circumstantial evidence implying that there is a substantial amount of fetal wastage
in humans. This insight arises from imperfect types of knowledge (as documented by Dr. Jarvis) but
nonetheless, there is a signal consistent with the claim that approximately half or more of conceptions
fail. More needs to be done to improve our understanding.
The study of fetal wastage shares with the study of the human sex ratio during pregnancy the fact that
many different kinds of scientists are involved and so, the associated balkanization has reduced the
accountability that arises from a shared disciplinary perspective about the standards for the interpretation
of data (Orzack, 2016; Orzack 
, 2015). One cause and consequence of this division is the gray
et al.
literature mentioned above. 
What contributes to the continuing “life” of the gray literature? Science abhors a vacuum and claims about
high fetal wastage in humans have been repeated often in a way that the connection with assumptions
and data have gotten obscured or lost. Some claims date well before there was any means by which early
mortality could be assessed (Mall, 1917; Meyer, 1920; Pearson, 1897). Pearson clearly acknowledged
the lack of direct evidence but such caveats get lost especially in medicine in which attention to standards
of evidence, recognition of the assumptions needed to connect data with conclusions, and awareness of
needed statistical techniques have been less as compared to in biological research. These deficiencies
have diminished as medical training has incorporated more scientific training but have not disappeared.
Nonetheless, during medical training the “inhalation” of facts is important. It is one reason as to why many
believe that fetal wastage is high, despite having little or no familiarity with the available data along with
the ins and outs of their analysis and interpretation.
In this context, care is needed when assessing the nature of claims about fetal wastage. This can be
illustrated by considering Dr. Jarvis’ claim (p. 8):
          ….it is clear that estimates for total embryonic loss of 90% (Opitz, 2002), 85% (Braude & Johnson,
1990), 83% (Harris, 2003), 80– 85% (Johnson & Everitt, 2000; Vitzthum, Spielvogel, Thornburg, & West,
2006), 78% (Roberts & Lowe, 1975), 76% (Boklage, 1990; Drife, 1983) and 70% (Chard, 1991; Ford &
Schust, 2009; Loke & King, 1995; Macklon, Geraedts, & Fauser, 2002; McCoy et al., 2015) are excessive.
(We have replaced number citations with author citations). Several of these claims are in medical
textbooks and are akin to newspaper articles, i.e., they are reports on prior research as opposed to being
independent estimates. Even then the nature of the evidence can go unmentioned. For example, in their
text book Johnson & Everitt (2000) include no evidence or citations in which to find evidence
underlying their estimate. Of the claims in the primary literature, we again see a lack of independent
evidence in as much as someone else’s estimate is reported. For example, Chard (1991); Drife (1983);
Vitzthum 
(2006) merely present Roberts & Lowe's (1975) estimate. A few claims present their own
et al. 
evidence. For example, Harris (2003) contains this passage (p. 362): 
          We now know that for every successful pregnancy that results in a live birth many, perhaps as many
as five early embryos will be lost or will “miscarry”…. 
and accompanying footnote (p. 371):
          Robert Winston gave the figure of five embryos for every live birth some years ago in a personal
communication. Anecdotal evidence to me from a number of sources confirms this high figure, but
the literature is rather more conservative, making more probable a figure of three embryos lost for every
live birth. See: Boklage CE. Survival probability of human conceptions from fertilization to term.
International Journal of Fertility 1990;35(2)75–94. See also: Leridon H. Human Fertility: The Basic
Components. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; 1977. Again, in a recent personal communication,

Components. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; 1977. Again, in a recent personal communication,
Henri Leridon confirmed that a figure of three lost embryos for every live birth is a reasonable conservative
figure.
This is clearly a heuristic estimate! The point is that there is less of a monolithic ensemble of flawed
estimates that need to be debunked than one might imagine given Dr. Jarvis’ passage. In any case, there
is nothing inherently problematic about the citations just described. Indeed, it would be preferable if
attributions were better and speculation was better highlighted as such. Nonetheless, such estimates
should be used with caution but not discarded, given the substantial difficulties associated with the
estimation of fetal wastage in humans.
An ideal future investigation of fetal wastage is easy to imagine: daily assessment of EPF and hCG for a
cohort of women attempting to get pregnant. Easier said than done! Consider what such a study would
require: a reliable assay for EPF, the enrollment of thousands of women, collection of and accurate
assessment of thousands of samples, and more. Perhaps these technical and logistical barriers can be
overcome soon. In the meantime, we can recognize that there is strong circumstantial evidence that
human fetal wastage is likely between 50 and 75%. At the same time, we can recognize along with Dr.
Jarvis that this conclusion lacks definitive proof and that additional investigations and scrutiny are
needed.

amended the article in light of their remarks, and hope they consider it improved as a result.
Introduction
The purpose of my article is to evaluate available data that contribute to our quantitative
understanding of natural human embryo mortality. The body of relevant data is small, as noted by
the reviewers, although I have attempted to identify all of it. I deliberately avoided IVF/ART data
since there is so much, and it is not obvious how such data illuminate natural circumstances (I
comment further on this below). My comments on IVF/ART data are therefore confined to the
Discussion. 
Orzack & Zuckerman repeatedly refer to my estimates of 10-40% preimplantation loss and 40-60%
total embryo loss, which are important benchmarks for my article. They are critical of these,
although they do not seem to appreciate where they come from. Contrary to what they imply (“On
the basis of his review of this evidence…”), they do not arise from analyses described in this
article. Rather, they are from an analysis described in a previous article in 
. I have
F1000Research
amended the article to clarify this point. Concerns with the validity of these estimates should focus
on that analysis, which is not listed among their 53 references.
In their review, the reviewers are ambiguous (one might say ‘gray’) in their use of quotation marks
and appear to ascribe to me things I did not write. For example, I do not use the phrase “great
deal”. Thus, for the sake of clarity, and to separate literary emphasis from quotation, I will follow the
convention employed by GEM Anscombe, who coined a useful phrase , to distinguish between
‘scare quotes’ and “quotations”.
I address points raised in the review, approximately in the order in which they appear.
1. Roberts & Lowe
Orzack & Zuckerman state that I calculate 95% confidence intervals. This is incorrect. The range
[37-90%] is not a confidence interval, I do not refer to it as such, and nor can it be, since there are
no data. As described in the article, it is the range within which 95% of simulated estimates fall,
based on Roberts & Lowe’s speculative values and other assumptions.
The reviewers suggest that my analysis lacks “practical quantitative value”. I agree. This is the
point and I am glad they have recognised it, if not entirely appreciated its significance. My analysis
has “no practical quantitative value” 
. As I
for estimating the number of conceptions that are lost
explicitly point out, the sole purpose of the sensitivity analyses is to show that modest changes in
the speculative estimates used by Roberts & Lowe may result in any biologically plausible value for
embryo loss. 
That my simulated estimate of 76.5% is close to Roberts & Lowe’s 78% is not telling since it uses
their original speculative values. On the contrary, it would be telling (of something) if they were not
close. I simply added variance to the speculative values. I comment on the nature of this
variance/covariance in my response to Reviewer 2. Thus, my analysis does not validate Roberts &
Lowe, it exposes its quantitative futility.
Gray Literature is “documentary material which is not commercially published or publicly available,
such as technical reports or internal business documents.”   
is not ‘Gray Literature’. I

such as technical reports or internal business documents.”   
is not ‘Gray Literature’. I
The Lancet 
comment further on this below. Contrary to the reviewers’ suggestion, we are not completely
“ignorant of the training of Drs. Roberts & Lowe” or unaware of their experience in “research
practice and data analysis”. Charles Ronald Lowe was the more senior of the two. He was 63 years
old and Professor of Social and Occupational Medicine at the University of Wales College of
Medicine when 
 article was published. He “contributed much to the growth of academic
The Lancet
public health and the teaching of epidemiology and statistics.”
I do not describe their work as “useless” – if intended as a quote, then it is a misquote. I describe it
as having “no practical quantitative value”. These are carefully chosen words. (I have edited the
equivalent phrase in the Abstract to match the full text.) The critique offered by the reviewers and
their description of the paper as heuristic support this view. Nevertheless, I have added a
statement that, as a model for highlighting factors that influence fecundity, the Roberts & Lowe
analysis has some value. 
In all fairness, on four separate occasions, I describe the analysis of Roberts & Lowe as a
“hypothesis”, i.e., the banner under which it was originally published in 
. Indeed, they
The Lancet
describe their arithmetic as “speculative”; however, they also describe their estimate as
“conservative”, implying that the true result may be even higher than 78%. My critique would be
less germane had their hypothesis not been cited so widely (“more than 300 times”, as helpfully
pointed out by the reviewers). I suggest that it is not I, but those who enthusiastically cite it  who
treat it as “something that it isn’t”.
2. Life Tables of Intrauterine Mortality
I do not consider Leridon’s chapter  a “casual exercise” or “superficial”. On the contrary, it is a
well-reasoned attempt to answer a challenging biological question. I have included a tribute in my
article to Leridon’s review. I hope this prevents readers from gaining such false impressions.
I agree with the reviewers that Leridon’s 63% is close to my 40-60%. However, Roberts & Lowe’s
78% is not, as they imply.
A critique of Leridon’s life-table is not a critique of Leridon at all, but of French & Bierman  and
Hertig . I discuss briefly why French & Bierman may be an overestimate and, in detail, how Hertig’s
analysis is flawed. Leridon’s account has been widely cited, especially by those describing embryo
loss at the earliest stage. I hope readers will find it useful to know how Leridon’s values are derived.
3. hCG studies of early pregnancy loss
The Edmonds (1982) estimate of approximately 60% loss  is the highest I report and, for reasons
discussed in the article and mentioned by others
, is likely to be an over-estimate. Nevertheless,
years after the more credible Wilcox (1988)
 study was published, Edmonds is still widely cited to
justify high levels of embryo wastage. For example, Hyde & Schust (2015)
 cite both Edmonds
and Wilcox to support their claim that “Approximately 70% of human conceptions fail to achieve
viability, with almost 50% of all pregnancies ending in miscarriage before the clinical recognition of
a missed period…” By showing Edmonds’ results in context, I hope this kind of overstatement can
be avoided.

be avoided.
My conclusion of one third loss is based on the average of the eight listed studies from Wilcox to
the present day (unweighted average = 31.9%). I have edited the paper to make this clear. I also
discuss why the estimates prior to Wilcox are less reliable and cite several studies that make
similar observations.
As already noted, my 40-60% estimate is from a previous analysis  and is not a combination of the
values (31.3; 35.7; 31.3) highlighted by the reviewers. My rationale for using a 90% implantation
(and fertilisation) efficiency is found in that analysis . 
My conclusion regarding the validity of Boklage’s analysis of embryo mortality
 is not
“unsubstantiated”. Indeed, the reviewers mention a key point of substance: namely, that Boklage’s
value of 28.7% misinterprets the biology. Boklage uses this as measure of embryo mortality,
whereas it is a fecundability. If fecundabilities are analysed as embryo mortalities, surely this casts
doubt on the validity of conclusions regarding embryo mortality.
I cannot comment on Boklage’s statistical methodology (i.e., use of MLE, LRTs or AIC values)
since he reports no such detail. However, I thank the reviewers for highlighting the lack of clarity in
Boklage’s analysis. 
Contrary to the claim of the reviewers, I refer to Boklage’s estimate of 76% loss from conception
(fertilisation) to birth on three occasions. This 76% estimate is consistent with Roberts & Lowe’s
value. It is somewhat higher than Leridon’s (whose life table is inexplicably omitted from the
Boklage analysis). It is clearly not consistent with my 40-60% estimate . 
4. Hertig’s data and analysis
Regarding Hertig’s conclusion, Orzack & Zuckerman “believe that it has been well recognized that
it is ‘impressionistic’ as opposed to something that has a solid quantitative underpinning”. I agree
that Hertig’s conclusion does not have a “solid quantitative underpinning”; however, it is precisely
the quantitative underpinning of Leridon’s life table and other claims about early natural embryo
mortality. This is a key point of my article. It is not clear what the reviewers mean by
‘impressionistic’
: some authors seem to offer an ‘unimpressionistic’ account of Hertig. For
example, in the widely-cited ‘Black Box’ review
, Macklon 
. write regarding Hertig’s study:
et al
“…the high rate of early pregnancy loss before the time of the first missed period was thus clearly
demonstrated…” Other less widely-cited articles
 do address the design and analytical
shortcomings. 
Pointing out shortcomings in studies is what scientists (and reviewers) are meant to do. Thus, I
agree with the reviewers that they are “worth mentioning”. Furthermore, by pointing out that
Hertig’s subjects were of proven fertility, had gynaecological problems and may have had
suboptimal reproductive function, I am placing Hertig’s study “in proper context”. This is not
“un-useful”. Nevertheless, I have edited this section, to accommodate these reviewers’ scepticism
with the more positive view of others
. I hope I have struck an acceptable balance. 
Orzack & Zuckerman appear to have concerns with well-established statistical techniques,
referring to my “so-called ‘bootstrap’ samples”. I agree that bootstrapping is “not a ‘cure’ for small

referring to my “so-called ‘bootstrap’ samples”. I agree that bootstrapping is “not a ‘cure’ for small
sample size”, but I do not claim that it is. Bootstrapping can provide estimates of precision when it
is not possible to calculate these analytically. As with all analyses, outputs require appropriate
interpretation.
The reviewers state that the “analyses of the bootstrap results are incorrect” because some of the
confidence intervals lie outside the range 0-100%. I am aware that this is impossible (for a
probability) as I explicitly point out. Such outputs do indicate a serious flaw in the analysis, which is
as follows: Hertig ignores 47 of his 107 cases. These cases are included in my bootstrap. The
reader may consider whether ignoring 44% of the data is reasonable and the extent to which by
doing so Hertig has generated biased estimates of the probabilities he calculates. Kline 
.
et al
(1989) make a similar point: “The missing data are sufficient to engender an entirely different
result”
. The bootstrap therefore illustrates the extent to which Hertig’s estimates are biased by
ignoring his own data. There are other reasons to doubt the precision of his conclusions and the
representative nature of the subset of data upon which he relies so heavily – these are described in
the article. 
The bootstrap pseudo-datasets are available for scrutiny (Dataset 4). Thus, if there are any flaws in
my reasoning or bootstrap, the reviewers may point these out. I used the percentile method (to
which they refer) to calculate the 95% CIs and I have edited the text to clarify this. I do not believe
there are any flaws in my bootstrap.
IVF/ART data
There is a wealth of data from IVF/ART studies and I have only mentioned a tiny proportion of this.
Orzack & Zuckerman and a previous reviewer
 suggest that such data could contribute to a
quantitative understanding of the 
 situation. In the broadest sense, this is of course true.
in vivo
However, there are difficulties in extrapolating from 
 to 
 circumstances. I am not alone
in vitro
in vivo
in pointing this out
,  and I have illustrated some of these difficulties in the Discussion.
My description of “sub-optimal conditions for embryo culture” is drawn from two papers:
Bolton & Braude (1987)
: “Optimal culture conditions for human embryos have yet to be
defined” and “suboptimal culture conditions are undoubtedly responsible for a proportion of
this embryonic failure”. 
Bolton 
. (2015)
: “Embryo culture conditions 
 are likely to be suboptimal
et al
in vitro
compared to those 
.”
in vivo
Is this just rhetoric or a reasonable consideration?
 
Describing 
 data as the “best available” is a weak claim in the absence of equivalent natural 
in vitro
 data. The extent to which 
 embryos are representative of 
 embryos is precisely
in vivo
in vitro
in vivo
the point in question. Is there really numerical consistency between natural and IVF/ART embryos?
There may be consistency in sex ratios
, but does that extend to aneuploidy rates, mosaicism,
epigenetic defects, implantation potential, spontaneous abortion rates, etc? These are big
questions and this article is not the place to answer them. However, if 70% loss
 is the natural
benchmark by which IVF/ART embryos are judged to be equivalent to natural embryos
, but the
true rate of natural loss lies in the range 40-60%, this therefore casts doubt on the judgement that
IVF/ART and natural embryos are equivalent. Furthermore, the suggestion that IVF/ART and
natural embryos may be different is neither radical, novel, nor strong
. However, the real reason I

natural embryos may be different is neither radical, novel, nor strong
. However, the real reason I
do not consider IVF/ART embryo data is that the article is a critique of data from natural
circumstances. Comparison of natural and IVF/ART embryos is a project for the future.
The reviewers refer to my “tenuous or irrelevant reasons” why ART embryos are not useful for
quantifying early embryo mortality, yet they provide the perfect reason themselves: “it is true that
ART embryos are different from natural embryos in ways that could influence an estimate of fetal
wastage”
. Nevertheless, I do discuss circumstances in which different ART interventions (e.g.,
observation of 
 fertilisation 
; retrieval of embryos following timed artificial insemination,
in vitro
per se
as well as AID/IVF success rates) may cast light on embryonic/fetal wastage. 
Orzack & Zuckerman extrapolate from 84,881 aneuploidies among 139,704 IVF/ART embryos
 to
an “implied percentage of fetal wastage” of 60.8%. They state that this is the “central tendency” of
“many reports” that I dismiss as unreliable. Of course, if this were true, then the observation would
add little to what was already known. It is not clear which are the “many reports”.
Let us consider the hypothesis that 
 aneuploidy predicts natural total fetal wastage. Firstly,
in vitro
“The only well-established epidemiological facts about EPL {
} are that about
early pregnancy loss
50-60% of cases are associated with a chromosomal defect of the conceptus”
 suggesting that
euploid embryos may also fail. Secondly, “FISH may overestimate the incidence of aneuploidy”
 suggesting a proportion of apparently aneuploid embryos may not fail. Furthermore,
aneuploidy may not developmentally compromise embryos
; estimates of IVF/ART embryo
aneuploidy/mosaicism vary considerably
; mosaic embryos can self-correct
; aneuploidy in
trophoblast/placental cells may be less developmentally problematic
 – who knows, it may even
be advantageous!
The point is simple. There are too many undefined variables associated with IVF/ART embryos to
shed more than the faintest light on the question of natural embryo survival. I have included a brief
discussion of some of these issues and edited the penultimate paragraph to be more circumspect
by replacing an “are” with a “may be”. I hope this meets with the reviewers’ approval.
Gray Literature
On several occasions, the reviewers refer to Gray Literature. They offer a revealing account and
speculate on its continuing ‘life’. 
Gray Literature has been defined as follows: “That which is produced on all levels of government,
academics, business and industry in print and electronic formats, but which is not controlled by
commercial publishers.”
The list of references reproduced by the reviewers, starting with Opitz, 2002 and ending with
McCoy 
. 2015 are all from academic books, journals, or text books. They are all published by
et al
commercial publishers. They were all written (with one exception) by medical practitioners or
scientists, many of whom are experts in reproductive biology. The one exception (Harris, 2003) is a
moral philosopher; however, the reviewers usefully point out that his estimate comes from a
well-known and eminent reproductive biologist. 
None of this is Gray Literature.

are reputable academic journals. Many of these articles will have been peer-reviewed. Even pieces
“akin to newspaper articles” (the Drife (1983) 
 piece could be described as such and was
BMJ
probably not peer-reviewed
) are subject to editorial control, and an expectation of academic
professionalism is surely reasonable from such experts.
The reviewers state that it would “be preferable if attributions were better and speculation was
better highlighted”. I agree. Yet they highlight my 'so-called' “errors of analysis” and
“overstatement” whilst passing over errors and overstatement in these citations as “nothing
inherently problematic”.
What Orzack & Zuckerman describe and defend is not Gray Literature, but ‘Gray Scholarship’.
Heuristics
A heuristic estimate may be based on simplified quantitative criteria, educated guesswork, rules of
thumb, common sense, past experience, etc. Despite their utility, in the absence of evidence
heuristic estimates may become biased. Faced with inconsistent estimates, on the one hand,
those that are heuristic or based on circumstantial evidence, and on the other, those based on
well-defined analysis of relevant data, surely an appropriate scientific response is to favour the
latter and re-evaluate the former.
A further problem with heuristic estimates is that the process for deriving them is not always
transparent. For example, it is not obvious how Orzack & Zuckerman use the “web of
circumstantial evidence” to which they refer to conclude that “human fetal wastage is likely
between 50 and 75%”. There is something ‘gray’ about this. My estimates of 10-40%
preimplantation loss and 40-60% total loss are partly evidence-based and partly heuristic. They
may be imperfect, and no doubt will not be the last word on the matter, but it is at least clear how
they were derived .
Conclusion
Orzack & Zuckerman often repeat the point that my estimates are consistent with previously
published values. In some cases they are, and I have drawn more attention to the fine chapter by
Kline 
. (1989)
  who conclude that “perhaps half of all conceptions are lost before birth”
.
et al
However in other cases, reported values are clearly not consistent with my estimates. I have used
70% total embryo loss as a threshold, at and above which I describe estimates as exaggerated.
This is based on my previous analysis  and thus my claim rests heavily, although not solely, on its
credibility. There are other reasons to cast doubt on these high values, but these are for another
time. I have modified the conclusion of my article to highlight that while precision may be elusive,
exaggeration can be avoided.
“Nature abhors a vacuum”, so the proverb says, but how science, or more properly scientists,
should fill it is another matter entirely. Recognising and quantifying limits of knowledge is an
essential part of a credible scientific process. As a philosopher once wrote: “Wovon man nicht
sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen”
.

Thanks for the opportunity to review this high-quality manuscript. Peer review can be a chore, but this was
a pleasure to read.
I will state that my training is in statistics and research methodology. Although much of my work is in the
field of fertility, I have no clinical expertise and no familiarity with the literature discussed in this review.
Any comments I make are from the point of view of the statistician and, with respect to the subject-matter,
the layperson.

the layperson.
I am unable to comment on whether or not the body of evidence discussed in the review is
comprehensive. However, the critical appraisal of these studies is conducted to a high standard, with a
strong command of quantitative research methods on display. I can’t fault it. The reader is left in no doubt
as to the considerable limitations (many of which appear to be fatal) of these studies. All data used in the
manuscript have been made available for the purposes of reproducing the analysis.
I was slightly confused by the description of the simulation study as a two-stage procedure in the critique
of Roberts & Lowe. If I understand correctly, sets of simulated values for five quantities were drawn from
Normal distributions centred around the estimates used by Roberts & Lowe, with standard deviations
equal to these values multiplied by 0.2. Each time a new set of these five quantities was drawn, the values
were used to calculate (predict) a value for embryo loss. This was done 100,000 times. However, the
author speaks of 1,000 simulations, each containing 10,000 separate estimates. It is unclear what exactly
varied within and between the 1000 simulations. If the data generating model was the same for all of
these (ie: this was just done for computational reasons), then it would be helpful if the author could make
this clear in the text.
The author assumed that the simulated quantities were independent in the simulation – I confess to
having no real intuition as to the implications of this assumption. However, I don’t believe this would affect
the author’s conclusion.
 
One minor typo; ‘this is far from being a robust pregnancy diagnosis and in different study [46]…’
I believe that it would be appropriate to accept this manuscript without revision, although the author may
wish to clarify the point about the first simulation described above.

I would like to thank Dr Wilkinson for his helpful review. I hope the following clarify the points
raised.
 
10,000 simulated records provided data to generate 1 each of the
Roberts & Lowe Simulation: 
following parameters: mean, median, and 2.5  & 97.5  percentiles. Repeating this process
generated slightly different values for these parameters owing to the specification of the random
number generator. Hence, the “10,000 simulations step” was repeated to obtain 1,000 means,
medians and percentile values. It is the means of these parameters that are reported. The 100,000
simulated records were generated separately, albeit using the same model structure, simply to
produce data for the Figure. I have edited the text to clarify these points.

It is plausible to suppose that some of the random variables

the extent of any correlation may be weak. I do not believe that constructing a full
variance-covariance matrix for the model would shed any further light on the precision of the
estimates of embryo mortality. There are too many undefined and imprecise variables for the
model to be quantitatively useful. A solution to this imprecision would be to obtain and use more
robust estimates, rather than build a more complex statistical model.

The author has provided have provided a provocative and timely review of the evidence related to
pregnancy success. The author has focused on the evidence as he sees it from four different categories
of review published in the last few decades. 
We think the title is appropriate and will attract attention and the abstract is generally well drafted but the
final sentence ends rather abruptly. We suggest the author might wish to consider a more
robust/informative ending to his abstract as this will be read alone in Pubmed.
 
The following comments are provided in a spirit of trying to increase access to this article for a broader
readership than might not be otherwise able to consider its contents, i.e. as currently written it seems
largely to appeal to a people who might be interested in statistical analysis. Specifically we would like to
see the author consider see how he might frame the evidence he provides alongside a timeline of the
different stages of early pregnancy – this would mean individuals who are not well versed in reproductive
function would be able to understand the arguments he is providing.
 
We are pleased to see this article being written. We think it is timely, thought-provoking and this is an
excellent moment in which to consider in realistic terms the kind of evidence that is constantly requoted in
the debate about how fertile the human species is. Currently this topic is dominated by data from studies
on women who are sub/infertile receiving medical support to achieve a pregnancy.

Specific points
 
Who is the audience for this paper and does the introduction set the scene in such a way that the
reader will be both interested and motivated to read the remaining part of the paper, which I would
like to see them do? I think as written the Introduction may not achieve this objective. For example
the first sentence starts with some glib comments about it being ‘widely accepted’ that under
natural circumstances human embryo mortality is high, and then there is an extensive section
quoting number of popularist articles and websites – why have this up front? It seemed to
undermine the erudite arguments of the rest of the paper.
 
The second paragraph with some modification would make a sufficient introduction. The aim of the
review as stated in the discussion ‘How many fertilized human embryos..?’ should also be
frontloaded at some point here. Clearly embryo mortality is of interest to both reproductive
biologists and fertility doctors but why not also mention couples trying to conceive?
 
Reading the introduction we were struck by the pressing need for ’key terms’ box – the kind of thing
you see in Nature papers – where there is a definition of each of the terms used, e.g. Fecundability,
embryo, HCG, etc.  If this paper is going to be read by individuals who are not fertility experts or
experts in reproductive biology but people interested in ethics or chance or statistics, I think they
will be very confused by the different terms that are used.
 
What is not clear from the paper is the chronology of the observations/data being discussed. It is
common for people (even those familiar with the field but who work on animal models) to be very
confused by the timings in women. For example – the day on which fertilisation takes place versus
the last menstrual period, e.g. fertilisation versus gestation versus the first day (depending on when
you count from) on which you might reasonably expect to detect HCG in the urine. We would argue
there needs to be a figure defining when each of these happens in terms of days in a woman's
reproductive span. This could also help clarify the points in the process that the probabilities of π
 π
etc can apply to.
 
The second piece of information where we think it would be very helpful is under the section called
'What the data say' where the terms such as ‘old’ are added and there are no dates or refs
provided. What do they mean by 'old' - pre 1960, pre 1950, pre 1940?
 
Because the author has used numbered references, there is also no sense of the relationship of
one study to another in terms of dates i.e. how they chronologically relate to each other. Some
minor reworking in which the author says, for instance, "the work of Hertig and Rogg in the 1950’s"
would be helpful.
 
The author is also slightly confusing when talking about the pregnancy study (ref 42) not giving the
names of the authors nor the date on which it was published in the section on page 4, and then in
the reference, for instance in Fig 2, they talk about the pregnancy study ref 42 but in the figure it is
shown as French and Bierman 1962. This is the kind of things that make it difficult to get a sense of
the chronology of observations and how people have built on each other's observations in order to
support subsequent studies, and this after all is one of the most crucial points of this paper.
 
On page 6 we finally get to some discussion about modern pregnancy tests. It is not until some
pages after that we know whether they are in blood or urine. Mid cycle elevation of HCG - this is
not defined in terms of days (cf comments above). For information the fact that these assays were

likely to be urine-based assays is not mentioned until page 7.
 
We think many aspects of this paper are extremely well argued, very much so the data
provided. The very great detailed analysis in Table 3 and also in other parts of page 7, and some
very good points are made about the over-emphasis on using data from patient groups where
infertility is probably one of the reasons for presentation that may have caused a less robust data
set.
 
The author makes a valid argument about potential subfertility within the Hertig cohort but this is
not balanced. Equally, these women were selected for proven fecunditity and this factor affects
interpretation of this cohort as much as the other.
 
On page 10 the discussion starts with a key question how many fertilised human embryos die. It is
slightly frustrating that this was not put up front as the question being addressed in this paper. 
Maybe the author might like to consider setting out aims more clearly.
 
Again, in the discussion, many of the arguments being made would have been greatly enhanced
by telling us the dates on which some of these studies were conducted. When looking at the
reference list I see many of them were in the '80s and early '90s.
 
We wonder if the first paragraph on page 12 might reasonably be eliminated - it feels repetitive
compared to other parts of the paper. I think the discussion of the studies by Macklon review ref 20
is extremely insightful and useful. However we draw the author's attention to a more recent study
by Macklon and Brosens which we believe puts forward some interesting arguments that might
reasonably be discussed in his study about how the endometrium in which the embryos are set to
implant might be acting as a ‘sensor’ of embryo quality. This is in Biology Reproduction 2014, vol
91. There is also a complementary paper in Sci Rep, vol 6, Brosens 
 2014.
et al.
 
The conclusion of the discussion seems more like a continuation of the critique of the final few
paragraphs. It would be desirable to provide a concluding paragraph which holistically draws
together the content of the review. Again the heavy use of quoting references as appears in the
introduction masks the opportunity for the author to provide his own conclusions.
 
In summary we welcome this review which we think makes many erudite comments on a difficult field.
 No competing interests were disclosed.

We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to
confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have significant reservations,
as outlined above.

I would like to thank Professor Saunders and Dr Gibson for their helpful review. I have tried to
address each point as detailed below.
 
The abstract has been re-drafted to provide a clearer and more robust conclusion. I have also
brought the “How many…” question posed in the discussion to the beginning of the Abstract and

brought the “How many…” question posed in the discussion to the beginning of the Abstract and
into the Introduction as suggested.
 
I hope that the changes made will make the article more accessible to a wider readership.
 
Responses to specific points
The article is intended primarily for a scientific audience, although I agree that it may have
wider appeal and I would be pleased for it to be read as such. The references to claims in
the press and popular media are important (see later); however, I agree that as an opening
this may be a distraction. I have therefore moved this section to the discussion. The list of
scientific citations that make claims about embryo mortality is essential since it
substantiates my claim that high embryonic mortality is widely reported. Additionally, it
illustrates the large variance in these estimates.
The introduction has been re-organised along the lines suggested. The second paragraph
has become the start and the quantitative claims incorporated into it. The importance of
embryo mortality to women trying to conceive is clear, and was already present in Version 1.
It remains in Version 2 and has also been emphasised in the discussion. The “How many…”
question has been frontloaded as suggested, and is now also in the abstract.
A glossary of key terms box has been provided.
A new figure provides a timeline for non-fecund and fecund cycles and key biological
events.       
Most of the pre-1960 references are found in databases, e.g., PubMed; however, search
terms appear less comprehensive as articles get older. Hertig (1959) (Ref. 90, PMID:
13613882) has no reference to pregnancy loss in its MeSH terms. Neither Rock & Hertig
(1942) (Ref. 92) nor Opitz (2002) (Ref. 29) is indexed in PubMed. A PubMed search on
{"early pregnancy loss"[All Fields]} generates 831 hits (25  April 2017) of which the earliest
is 1971.  However, I agree that the description in Version 1 is vague. I have removed the
reference to “old”.
I have edited the text in several places to include names and dates. I hope this will assist
readers in following the chronology. The hCG studies are already arranged by date in Table
3 and Figure 3.
Reference numbers have been added to the legend within the Figure, and names and dates
included in the legend text to increase clarity.
All of the 13 studies measured hCG in urine except two. These two employed serum
samples and have been identified in the text. The term “mid-cycle” has been removed and
the meaning clarified using the new Figure 1.
Thank you for these comments.
I agree with the point made. In this section the first point I make about the 210 recruited
women is that they were of “proven fertility”. The same point is made again in the
commentary on Hertig’s data. I have also edited the text in response to Reviewer 3 and
hope that the final result is appropriately balanced.
The question (slightly modified) has been included in the Abstract and Introduction. I hope
that this helps to clarify and reinforce the purpose of the article.
Some dates have been incorporated to enhance chronological clarity (see point 6).
The first paragraph on page 12 addresses the importance of biological variance. It does not
go into detail but stresses that point estimates of risk do not provide the whole picture when
considering either populations or individual cases. As I have put it, a neglect of variance
fosters a misleading appreciation of reality. I would prefer to retain this paragraph, in the
hope that it will encourage readers to consider the importance and implications of numerical
diversity when interpreting data.The arguments proposed by Macklon and Brosens relating

diversity when interpreting data.The arguments proposed by Macklon and Brosens relating
to endometrial receptivity are indeed interesting. However, they propose mechanistic
explanations for implantation failure and do not directly address the issue of how frequently
such events occur. Nevertheless, their inclusion is contextually valuable, and I have made
some comments on their studies.
The final paragraph has been edited. The quotations are useful to make it clear that I am not
alone in drawing attention to the limitations of the available data. I have endeavoured to
summarise the broad purpose and value of this work.
