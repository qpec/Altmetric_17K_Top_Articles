ABSTRACT
Background E-cigarettes have grown popular. The
most common pattern is dual use with conventional
cigarettes. Dual use has raised concerns that it might
delay quitting of cigarette smoking. This study examined
the relationship between long-term use of e-cigarettes
and smoking cessation in a 2-year period.
Methods A nationally representative sample of 2028
US smokers were surveyed in 2012 and 2014. Long-
term e-cigarette use was defined as using e-cigarettes at
baseline and follow-up. Use of e-cigarettes only at
baseline or at follow-up was defined as short-term use.
Non-users did not use e-cigarettes at either survey. Quit
attempt rates and cessation rates (abstinent for
3 months or longer) were compared across the three
groups.
Results At 2-year follow-up, 43.7% of baseline dual
users were still using e-cigarettes. Long-term e-cigarette
users had a higher quit attempt rate than short-term or
non-users (72.6% vs 53.8% and 45.5%, respectively),
and a higher cessation rate (42.4% vs 14.2% and
15.6%, respectively). The difference in cessation rate
between long-term users and non-users remained
significant after adjusting for baseline variables, OR=4.1
(95% CI 1.5 to 11.4) as did the difference between
long-term users and short-term users, OR=4.8 (95% CI
1.6 to 13.9). The difference in cessation rate between
short-term users and non-users was not significant,
OR=0.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 1.4). Among those making a
quit attempt, use of e-cigarettes as a cessation aid
surpassed that of FDA-approved pharmacotherapy.
Conclusions Short-term e-cigarette use was not
associated with a lower rate of smoking cessation.
Long-term use of e-cigarettes was associated with a
higher rate of quitting smoking.
INTRODUCTION
E-cigarettes have grown popular in recent years.
The majority of e-cigarette users are current cigar-
ette smokers.1
2 One reason e-cigarettes are so
popular among smokers is that many believe that e-
cigarettes can help them quit smoking and, indeed,
the use of e-cigarettes appears to be associated with
intention to quit smoking.1 3–5 However, the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not
approved e-cigarettes as a cessation aid, although
the UK has recently approved one brand.6 7 To
date, clinical trials testing the efficacy of e-cigarettes
for smoking cessation have provided only limited
evidence.8
At the population level, there is concern that
dual use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes could extend
the use of both products.9 In fact, many dual users
state that they use e-cigarettes at times and in
places where they cannot smoke.5 10 11 Dual use
may reduce smokers’ consumption of cigarettes,
but it could lessen the urgency to quit smoking.12
This would extend the nicotine addiction and
prolong the duration of cigarette smoking. If this is
true, then the overall population effect of e-
cigarettes would be negative since duration of
smoking poses a greater health risk than intensity
of smoking.13
Many studies have examined the association of
e-cigarette use and smoking cessation.14 However,
only a few have investigated the effect of long-term
use of e-cigarettes. T
wo studies reported high cessa-
tion rates among long-term e-cigarette users.15 16
However, these studies did not include a compari-
son group of smokers who did not use e-cigarettes.
One study of state quitline callers reported that the
quit rate was lower for those who used e-cigarettes
than those who never used e-cigarettes.17 Among
those who used e-cigarettes, those who used at least
1 month had a higher quit rate than those who did
not use e-cigarettes for 1 month. Even though the
use of a product for 1 month would generally not
be considered to be long-term use, this study did
find a difference between these two groups. A more
recent study reported that the rate of quitting
smoking was no different between those who had
used e-cigarettes weekly for at least 6 months and
those who did not use e-cigarettes.18 However, this
study did not include those who used e-cigarettes
for <6 months. Variations in study design and in
selection of participants make it difficult to inte-
grate these results. Moreover, none of these studies
examined the effect of long-term e-cigarette use on
smoking cessation with a sample representative of
the general smoking population.
Using a longitudinal study design with a nation-
ally representative sample of US adult smokers, the
present study examined the effect of long-term e-
cigarette use by comparing long-term users with
short-term users. Both groups were also compared
against non-users. The study also gathered informa-
tion on beliefs about e-cigarettes and the use of
various tobacco and nicotine products. Smokers in
the study were first surveyed in 2012 and then fol-
lowed up in 2014. This time frame corresponded
with the sharp rise in the use of e-cigarettes in the
USA.2 19 The 2-year duration allows for the exam-
ination of smokers who used e-cigarettes for an
extended period of time.

 established using random-digit dialing and an address-based
sampling frame20 and provides representativeness similar to
other US population surveys.21 22 Between February and March
2014, 2097 out of 3111 participants who were identified as
current smokers at the 2012 baseline completed a follow-up
survey (67.4%). Of the 2097, we excluded 56 who reported
that they were never smokers in 2014 (despite saying they were
current smokers in 2012) and 13 participants who did not
report their current e-cigarette status in either 2012 (n=10) or
in 2014 (n=3). Thus, the final effective sample size was 2028.
Measures
Smokers were defined as those who had smoked at least 100
cigarettes in their lifetime and smoked every day or some days
at the time of the survey. E-cigarette use was defined as those
who used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days before the survey.
Long-term e-cigarette users were those who used e-cigarettes at
baseline and follow-up. Short-term e-cigarette users were those
who used e-cigarettes only at baseline or only at follow-up.
Non-e-cigarette users were those who did not use e-cigarettes at
baseline or follow-up.
In addition, at follow-up e-cigarette users were asked if they
had ‘used e-cigarettes on at least 10 days (could be 10 days in a
row or 10 days not in a row)’ and if they had ‘ever been a daily
e-cigarette user for at least 1 month’.
At baseline, smokers were asked whether they planned to quit
smoking. Anyone who was ready to quit smoking within
6 months was coded as having an intention to quit, following
the convention of stage of change theory.23
The quit attempt rate was defined as the percentage of
smokers who, at follow-up, had made at least one attempt to
quit smoking that lasted for at least 24 hours in the past 2 years.
The cessation rate was defined as the percentage of smokers at
follow-up who had quit smoking for at least 3 months. Also,
those who had quit smoking and those current smokers who
made at least one quit attempt in the past 12 months before the
2014 survey were asked if they had used pharmacotherapies or
e-cigarettes in their most recent quit attempt.
The use of any of FDA-approved cessation aids at follow-up,
including nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum, lozenges,
spray or inhaler), bupropion and varenicline, were labelled as
having used pharmacotherapy.
To assess their beliefs about e-cigarettes, the survey asked par-
ticipants at follow-up how much they agreed or disagreed with
the following three statements: ‘Using e-cigarettes is harmful to
one’s health’, ‘E-cigarettes are less harmful to health than
regular cigarettes’ and ‘E-cigarettes help people quit smoking’.
In
the
analysis,
strongly
(agreed/disagreed)
or
somewhat
(agreed/disagreed) were collapsed into dichotomous categories
of agreed or disagreed.
Analysis
All percentages were weighted by population parameters based
on the most recent US Current Population Survey.24 25 A survey-
specific poststratification adjustment was used to account for any
survey non-responses, as well as any non-coverage, or under-
sampling and oversampling resulting from the survey-specific
sampling design. The longitudinal panel produced an overall
smoking prevalence for the USA of 20.7% in 2012 and 16.5%
in 2014: the national estimates were 18.1% and 16.8% from
the
2012
and
2014
National
Health
Interview
Survey,
respectively.26 27
Logistic regressions were used to examine the effect of long-
term use of e-cigarettes on quitting outcomes while adjusting
for baseline social demographics, cigarettes per day (CPD) and
intention to quit smoking. Beliefs about e-cigarettes and patterns
of pharmacotherapy and e-cigarette use were compared across
three e-cigarette use groups. CIs (95%) were calculated on the
basis
of
the
sampling
distribution
of
the
corresponding
summary statistic. A W
ald χ2 test was used to determine signifi-
cance. All calculations for this paper were generated using SAS
V
.9.4 software.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows e-cigarette use status over time: of those who
used e-cigarettes and cigarettes at baseline, 43.7% were still
using e-cigarettes at the 2-year follow-up (ie, long-term e-
cigarette users) while 56.3% stopped using e-cigarettes. Among
those who did not use e-cigarettes at baseline, 19.4% were using
e-cigarettes at follow-up.
Those who only used e-cigarettes at baseline or at follow-up
are grouped together in the analysis and were defined as short-
term e-cigarette users. The remaining baseline smokers are clas-
sified as non-e-cigarette users.
Long-term users differed significantly from short-term users
in their frequency of usage. Almost all the long-term users,
96.8%, answered ‘yes’ when they were asked if they had used e-
cigarettes for at least 10 days in their life, compared to only
67.4% of short-term users (p<0.001), and 67.3% of long-term
users reported that they had used e-cigarettes daily for at least
1 month, compared to 32.2% of short-term users (p<0.001).

 It should be noted that 40.1% of non-users reported that
they had tried e-cigarettes at some point in their life. However,
they were not using any e-cigarettes at time of survey in 2012
nor in 2014.
Table 1 shows the baseline demographics, cigarettes smoked
per day and intention to quit smoking by e-cigarette use cat-
egory. Those aged 25–44 were less likely to be long-term e-
cigarette users than short-term and non-users (16.8% vs 40.0%
and 40.5%, respectively). Those aged 65+ were more likely to
be non-users than short-term users (9.7% vs 5.9%). No gender
or education differences were found among the three groups.
The percentage of heavy smokers (CPD≥15) did not differ sig-
nificantly across e-cigarette use categories. Intention to quit
smoking appeared to differ across groups, but the difference
was not statistically significant.
The short-term e-cigarette use group comprised of two sub-
groups: those who used e-cigarettes only at baseline and those
who used e-cigarette only at follow-up. The two subgroups
were not different in either CPD (45.2% vs 42.9% smoked ≥15
CPD) or intention to quit smoking (31.6% vs 33.8%), although
the
second
subgroup
had
a
higher
proportion
of
18–
24-year-olds (5.1% vs 17.2%) and of 65 years or older (1.8% vs
6.7%) and a higher proportion who identified themselves as
‘other’ ethnicity (0.3% vs 9.5%).
Table 2 shows beliefs about e-cigarettes. Long-term e-cigarette
users were more likely to believe that e-cigarettes are less
harmful than cigarettes compared to short-term users, who in
turn were more likely to believe that than non-users. No signifi-
cant difference was found between long-term and short-term e-
cigarette users on their beliefs that e-cigarettes are ‘harmful to
health’, e-cigarettes ‘help quitting’ and e-cigarettes’ ‘secondhand
vapour is harmful’. On the other hand, non-users generally held
more negative beliefs about e-cigarettes than users did.
Table 3 presents the quit attempt rates and 3-month quit
rates. T
wo analyses were performed to compare these rates: a
univariate analysis and a multiple regression. Univariate analysis
shows that long-term e-cigarettes users had a significantly higher
quit attempt rate, 72.6%, than non-users, 45.5% (p<0.01).
They also had a significantly higher quit attempt rate than short-
term users, 53.8% (p<0.05). There was no significant differ-
ence between short-term users and non-users (p=0.07).
Intention to quit smoking also predicted the quit attempt rate
(71.1% vs 38.6%), as did heavy smoking (40.9% vs 52.5%).
Among the demographic variables, higher education and the
ethnic category ‘other’ predicted quit attempt.
The multiple regression showed similar results: long-term
users had a significantly higher quit attempt rate than non-users
(OR=2.94, p<0.01), after adjusting for intention to quit
smoking, CPD and demographic variables. The difference
between
short-term
and
non-users
were
not
significant
(p=0.07).
The results for the cessation rate, defined as quit for
3 months or more, show a similar pattern. The multiple regres-
sion results show that long-term users were more likely to quit
smoking successfully than non-users (OR=4.14, p<0.01), after
adjusting for intention to quit smoking, CPD and demographic
variables. The short-term users were not statistically different
from non-users (p=0.59).
The ORs shown in table 3 used non-users as the reference
point. If the group of short-term users were used as the refer-
ence point, the OR of long-term against short-term users was
4.75 (95% CI 1.62 to 13.94, p<0.01).
The multiple regression shows that intention to quit smoking
and CPD also independently predicted quitting for 3 months or
more. Among demographic variables, only education remained
a significant predictor after adjusting for other factors.
Table 4 shows the use of FDA-approved pharmacotherapy
and the use of e-cigarettes in the last quit attempt. Long-term e-
cigarette users were no more likely than short-term or non-users
to use pharmacotherapy. The overall rates were 19.5% for long-
term users, 31.5% (8.2%+23.4%) for short-term users and
26.7% (22.1%+4.6%) for non-users. The use of e-cigarettes in
the last quit attempt was also similar among long-term and
short-term e-cigarette users (81.8% vs 87.9%).
As mentioned earlier, many of those who did not use e-
cigarettes either at the 2012 survey or at the 2014 survey had

 tried e-cigarettes sometime in their life. Apparently, about
16.7% of non-users (4.6%+12.0%) reported that they used
e-cigarettes in their last quit attempt. The rate of using pharma-
cotherapy among this group is 26.7% (22.1%+4.6%).
If we treat e-cigarettes as a cessation aid, as these smokers
reportedly did, then the use of cessation aids was significantly
higher for long-term users and short-term users than for
non-users (81.8%, 87.9%, and 38.7%, respectively).
Overall, more quit attempts were aided by e-cigarettes than
by FDA-approved pharmacotherapy. The proportion of using
e-cigarettes only was 24.8% versus 17.8% for using pharmaco-
therapy only (p<0.05). The overall use for all quitting aids was
52.4%.
DISCUSSION
This longitudinal study is the first to examine the long-term use
of e-cigarettes and its association with quitting outcomes in a
nationally representative sample of US smokers. The results
show that prolonged use of e-cigarettes is associated with a
higher smoking cessation rate, independent of the effect of base-
line intention to quit smoking. Long-term e-cigarette users were
more likely to perceive e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigar-
ettes when compared to short-term e-cigarette users. Their per-
ception of a lower level of harm is also associated with a greater
likelihood of using e-cigarettes on a daily basis.
A large proportion, 44%, of e-cigarette users among smokers
in 2012 were still using e-cigarettes 2 years later. Despite an
increasing number of reports suggesting that there are health
risks associated with using e-cigarettes,28 29 among these long-
term e-cigarette users, 96.2% perceived e-cigarettes as less
harmful than cigarettes. This belief is a critical distinction
between long-term users and short-term users. Both groups
believed e-cigarettes are harmful, but the former were more
likely to believe e-cigarettes were less harmful than cigarettes.

 Interestingly, this is also the belief of an expert panel of tobacco
researchers
and
the
recent
report
by
the
Public
Health
England,30 31 although the methodology used to obtain esti-
mates of relative risk in these documents has been criticised.32 33
There are indications, however, that the proportion of smokers
who believe e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes is decreasing
over time.34 It is not clear if this change is beneficial to public
health, given the findings of this study.
Smokers in the USA are not currently encouraged to use e-
cigarettes to help them quit smoking, which differs from the UK
where one e-cigarette company has recently received approval
for marketing them as cessation aids.6 7 Even so, this study
shows that more than one-third of US smokers used e-cigarettes
in their last quit attempt. In fact, about one-quarter of them
used e-cigarettes as their only cessation aid. If we treat
e-cigarette as a cessation aid, then the e-cigarette has signifi-
cantly impacted the rate of cessation aid usage. No cessation aid
introduced in the last decade has resulted in such a large
increase in overall use of cessation aids. Even with the introduc-
tion of varenicline, a highly effective pharmacotherapy, the rate
of using FDA-approved pharmacotherapies has hovered around
30% (similar to the 28% found in this study). The introduction
of varenicline mainly displaced other therapies.35 In contrast,
e-cigarettes do not appear to have simply displaced other ther-
apies. Instead, they have contributed to a 50% increase in the
rate of smokers using cessation aids (provided one classifies
e-cigarettes as a cessation aid). This suggests that many smokers
who would not otherwise use pharmacotherapies are using
e-cigarettes to help themselves quit.
Data from the UK has shown a similar pattern. The use of
e-cigarettes in smokers’ last quit attempt has surpassed but not
replaced NRT or varenicline in 2015 (39.5% vs 26.4% or 6.5%,
respectively).36 As a result, the effect of e-cigarettes is likely to
increase the total use of cessation aids.
Even though e-cigarettes have not been officially recognised
as smoking cessation aids in the USA, a comparison with
FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is instructive. Previous research
has shown that the effect of pharmacotherapies in the real-
world setting can only be detected if they are used for a suffi-
cient period of time.37 Data from the present study support the
importance of longer term use. For example, neither the quit
attempt rate nor the cessation rate for short-term e-cigarette
users was higher than for non-users. Since short-term users rep-
resent the majority of e-cigarette users, this explains why studies
that lump all e-cigarette users do not detect any advantages for
using e-cigarettes in smoking cessation.
It is important to point out that the population impact of
e-cigarette use could still be negative despite the fact that the
long-term use of e-cigarettes is associated with a higher smoking
cessation rate. This would occur if short-term use, which is the
majority among e-cigarette users, led to lower cessation rates
than for non-use. The present study, however, found that this
was not the case. The smoking cessation rate for short-term
e-cigarette users was not statistically lower than for non-users.
Moreover, the likelihood of current e-cigarette users turning to
long-term e-cigarette use seems to be high (44% from 2012 to
2014). It is not clear if this rate of transition to long-term use
applies to any new e-cigarette users as we do not know what
proportion of e-cigarette users at 2012 baseline survey would
have qualified as long-term users already. An additional survey
to follow this study sample is currently underway.
Previous studies have reported that the intensity of e-cigarette
use (ie, daily use) is associated with higher smoking cessation
rates.38–40 Biener and Hargraves further demonstrated that this
is important even among those who have used e-cigarette for at
least 1 month. In this study, long-term use, defined as using e-
cigarettes at both surveys, is highly correlated with using e-
cigarettes on a daily basis. Taken together, the evidence in these
studies suggests that e-cigarettes need to be used consistently to
be useful for smoking cessation, just as pharmacotherapy needs
to be used consistently in order to be effective.37
This study has several limitations. While the data are based
on a representative sample of the smoking population, the
results are correlational. For example, rather than long-term e-
cigarette use causing smokers to quit, it is possible that long-
term use is simply a proxy for motivation to quit smoking. This
study, however, controlled for intention to quit smoking at base-
line and found that long-term e-cigarette use still predicted quit-
ting success. Another limitation is that the short-term use group
was made up of two subgroups: those who used e-cigarettes
only at baseline and those who used only at follow-up. The
study found, however, despite some minor differences between
these subgroups in demographics, there were no significant dif-
ferences in CPD or intention to quit smoking at baseline, pro-
viding justification for collapsing them into one group. Finally,
the measure of long-term use did not assess continuous use
since it was based on two time points. There may have been
more rapid changes in pattern of e-cigarette use between the
two surveys that were not captured.
Despite these limitations, the findings of this study, with a
representative sample of US smokers and a longitudinal study
design, shed light on the issue of dual use of cigarettes and e-
cigarettes. Concerns have been raised that dual use might
impede or delay attempts to quit smoking. This study found
that those who used e-cigarettes longer term were more likely to
quit smoking. Moreover, those who used short term were no
less likely to quit smoking. This suggests that e-cigarette use is
more likely, overall, to have a positive rather than a negative
impact on smoking cessation.
What this paper adds
▸ Most e-cigarette users are current smokers. Concerns have
been raised that prolonged dual use might impede or delay
the attempt to quit smoking. This longitudinal study
examined the relationship between long-term e-cigarette use
and smoking cessation with a nationally representative
sample of US smokers.
▸ Dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes was not associated
with a lower smoking cessation rate.
▸ Long-term e-cigarette use was associated with a higher
smoking cessation rate.
