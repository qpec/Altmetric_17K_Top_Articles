Background: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) present a global public health problem. With numbers of
community-acquired resistant infections increasing, understanding the mechanisms by which people are exposed
to and colonised by ARB can help inform effective strategies to prevent their spread. The role natural en-
vironments play in this is poorly understood. This is the first study to combine surveillance of ARB in bathing
waters, human exposure estimates and association between exposure and colonisation by ARB in water users.
Methods: 97 bathing water samples from England and Wales were analysed for the proportion of E. coli har-
bouring blaCTX-M. These data were used to estimate the likelihood of water users ingesting blaCTX-M-bearing E.
coli. Having identified surfers as being at risk of exposure to ARB, a cross-sectional study was conducted. Regular
surfers and non-surfers were recruited to assess whether there is an association between surfing and gut colo-
nisation by blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli.
Results: 11 of 97 bathing waters sampled were found to contain blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli. While the percentage of
blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli in bathing waters was low (0.07%), water users are at risk of ingesting these ARB. It is
estimated that over 2.5 million water sports sessions occurred in 2015 resulting in the ingestion of at least one
blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli. In the epidemiological survey, 9/143 (6.3%) surfers were colonised by blaCTX-M-bearing
E. coli, as compared to 2/130 (1.5%) of non-surfers (risk ratio = 4.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 16.4, p = 0.046).
Conclusions: Surfers are at risk of exposure to and colonisation by clinically important antibiotic-resistant E. coli
in coastal waters. Further research must be done on the role natural environments play in the transmission of
ARB.
1. Introduction
There is little doubt that the extensive anthropogenic use of anti-
biotics and antimicrobials has accelerated the emergence of antibiotic
resistance among bacteria (Davies and Davies, 2010; Hawkey and
Jones, 2009). Resistance can arise by mutation or be acquired by hor-
izontal transfer of resistance genes on mobile genetic elements (MGEs)
such as plasmids, from one bacterium to other members of a bacterial
community. As many essential antibacterial agents fail to treat diseases
caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and with only a limited
number of antibiotics to which they may still be susceptible remaining,
resistance has been described as “one of the greatest health threats
faced today” (Davies et al., 2011). If current trends continue, rates of
morbidity and mortality from infections caused by ARB will increase
(de Kraker et al., 2011; European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control and European Medicines Agency, 2009). In the recent ‘O'Neill
Review on Antimicrobial Resistance’ it was estimated that by the year
2050, drug-resistant infections could cause 10 million human deaths
globally every year (Review on antimicrobial resistance, 2014).
One group of ARB that is of special concern in human medicine are
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae,
which have been identified by the World Health Organization as being a

 “critical priority” for the research and development of new antibiotics
(World Health Organization, 2017). Bacteria producing ESBL enzymes
are able to grow and survive in the presence of various β-lactam anti-
biotics, which include a wide range of clinically useful medicines such
as penicillins and cephalosporins (Nordmann et al., 2012). Plasmids
carrying ESBLs, like blaCTX-M, can be mobilised between bacteria, often
conferring
resistance
to
multiple
antibiotics,
for
example
fluor-
oquinolones, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines (Johnson et al., 2010;
Livermore and Hawkey, 2005; Nordmann et al., 2012). Although there
are a number of different plasmid-borne ESBLs (including blaTEM and
blaSHV), blaCTX-M genes represent nearly 80% of ESBLs in clinical iso-
lates, with blaCTX-M-15 being the most common genotype found world-
wide (Amos et al., 2014). Worryingly, their prevalence is increasing
outside healthcare settings (Amos et al., 2014; Hawkey and Jones,
2009). The rapid emergence and spread of ESBLs (particularly the CTX-
Ms) poses a significant public health threat, as infections caused by
ESBL-producing bacteria are unresponsive to multiple antibiotics, in-
cluding essential frontline drugs such as third-generation cephalos-
porins (3GCs) (Collignon et al., 2009). Carbapenems are one of the few
classes of antibiotics recommended for treating infections caused by
ESBL-producing bacteria, and while resistance to these last-resort an-
tibiotics remains rare in the UK (European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control, 2014), the numbers of infections caused by
carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae has risen since 2010
(European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2016).
Escherichia coli (a group of bacteria within the Enterobacteriaceae
family) have a complex phylogenetic substructure (Clermont et al.,
2013). Many are harmless commensals inhabiting the intestines of
healthy animals, including humans (Nicolas-Chanoine et al., 2014).
However, some types cause intestinal and extra-intestinal infections.
The phylogenetic groups B2 and D contain numerous extra-intestinal
pathogenic E. coli which can cause serious infections. For example, E.
coli is the predominant pathogen responsible for community-acquired
urinary tract infections (UTIs), but can also cause meningitis and is the
commonest cause of bloodstream infections in humans (European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2014). Recently a highly
virulent and resistant uropathogenic strain of E. coli, O25b-ST131, has
emerged and is spreading worldwide (Clermont et al., 2009).
The processes by which people acquire ARB have been the subject
of much research. Human exposure to ARB via contaminated food and
water occurs in many contexts, such as healthcare settings, at home,
and during international travel (Coleman et al., 2012; Kennedy and
Collignon, 2010; Paltansing et al., 2013; Valverde et al., 2008). Nat-
ural environments have been recognised as a potential but under-
studied setting in which members of the public come into contact with
ARB and where transmission of ARB to humans may occur (Ashbolt
et al., 2013; Manaia, 2017). Manure applied as fertiliser to crops, and
wastewater discharged into waterways introduce large numbers of
bacteria carrying diverse MGEs to coastal waters, along with com-
pounds that select for resistant microorganisms (Amos et al., 2014).
Furthermore, coastal locations in Great Britain receive millions of
visits annually, and bathing waters may be an important setting in
which people come into direct contact with ARB, particularly when
participating in water sports. A recent systematic review of the risks of
illness caused by sea bathing in high-income countries demonstrated a
significant increase in the risk of experiencing symptoms of gastro-
intestinal infection among bathers compared to non-bathers (Leonard
et al., 2018). There is also evidence that ingestion of water containing
antibiotic-resistant E. coli is associated with gut colonisation by these
bacteria (Coleman et al., 2012), and that swimming is a risk factor for
urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria (Soraas
et al., 2013). Therefore, bathers swallowing ARB in coastal waters
could become colonised by ARB and contribute to the prevalence of
ARB in the community.
In the first of its kind, this study aimed to quantify the prevalence of
blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli in bathing-associated waters, to estimate the
exposure risk that water users face, and to determine if there is an as-
sociation between surfing in coastal waters and gut colonisation by
antibiotic-resistant E. coli.
2. Methods
This study is described in three sections: 1) environmental mon-
itoring (Section 2.1), in which bathing waters were analysed for the
proportion of E. coli harbouring blaCTX-M, 2) estimating the risk of ex-
posure to blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli among coastal water users (Section
2.2), and 3) a cross-sectional survey to estimate the proportion of sur-
fers and non-surfers colonised by these resistant E. coli (Section 2.3).
The methods in each section are described briefly below, but further
details can be found in the study protocol (Appendix).
2.1. Environmental monitoring
2.1.1. Bathing water sampling
97 bathing water samples were collected by the Environment
Agency from England and Wales between 3rd July and 27th September
2012 as part of their routine water quality monitoring (Porter, 2012).
Water samples were transported on ice to the laboratory for analysis.
2.1.2. Quantifying the proportion of phenotypic resistance to third-
generation cephalosporins among E. coli
Culture-based methods were used to isolate and quantify the pro-
portion of E. coli in the water samples that were phenotypically re-
sistant to the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 3GC antibiotics
cefotaxime and ceftazidime (EUCAST, 2014), as previously described
(Leonard et al., 2015).
2.1.3. Quantifying the proportion of blaCTX-M carriage among E. coli, and
characterising CTX-M gene diversity
In 2013, colonies resistant to 3GCs were picked and colony PCRs
were performed using universal primer pairs to detect the presence of
the blaCTX-M gene family. Then genotype-group specific primer pairs for
groups 1, 2, 8, 9, and 25 genes were used to amplify the blaCTX-M genes
before sequencing (GATC Biotech). DNA sequences were aligned with
known sequence variants (from GenBank®) using MEGA7 to identify the
genotype (Kumar et al., 2015; National Center for Biotechnology
Information, 2016).
2.1.4. Phylotyping E. coli colonies and detecting the pathogenic O25b-
ST131 clone
E. coli phylogroup typing was performed on blaCTX-M-bearing co-
lonies (Clermont et al., 2013), and E. coli O25b-ST131 clones were
detected by PCR (Clermont et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2009).
2.2. Estimating the risk of exposure to blaCTX-M -bearing E. coli among
coastal water users
To demonstrate that water users are at risk of exposure to ARB in
coastal waters, methods similar to those described previously were used
to estimate the average number of blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli that various
water users ingested in coastal waters in 2015 (Leonard et al., 2015).
Briefly, weekly E. coli density data were obtained for all 415 English
and 104 Welsh coastal waters in the 2015 bathing season (mid-May to
the end of September) from the Environment Agency and Natural Re-
sources Wales. Data for 2015 were selected as the time period during
which bathers participating in the epidemiological survey (Section 2.3)
would have been most recently exposed to resistant E. coli. Data from
Section 2.1.3 on the proportion of E. coli harbouring blaCTX-M were used
to estimate the mean number of blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli present in
coastal bathing waters. Estimates of the volume of water that water
users ingest were obtained from a review of the literature and used to
calculate the average number of blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli the typical

 water user swallows during a session of their chosen activity. Using
reported numbers of beach activities in England and Wales, the likely
number of exposure events (sessions of water sport that resulted in the
ingestion of at least one blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli) that occurred in 2015
was also calculated.
2.3. The Beach Bum Survey: a cross-sectional survey to investigate the link
between surfing and gut colonisation by antibiotic resistant bacteria
2.3.1. The epidemiological survey
This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate frequent surfers,
body boarders and body surfers (hereafter referred to as ‘surfers’) as the
group exposed to coastal waters, alongside people with very little ex-
posure to seawater as the ‘control’ group. Planning began in 2014. To
detect a difference of 15 percentage points (25% versus 10%, respec-
tively) in the prevalence of gut colonisation by blaCTX-M–bearing E. coli
with 90% power at the 5% (2-tailed) level of significance, it was esti-
mated that 150 surfers and 150 matched controls would be needed. The
prevalence of gut colonisation in the wider community (10%) was ob-
tained from Wickramasinghe et al. (2012). Participants were recruited
via Surfers Against Sewage (https://www.sas.org.uk/), an environ-
mental charity located in the Southwest UK, between April 2015 and
October 2015. The primary method of participant recruitment was
conducted using Surfers Against Sewage's network of regional re-
presentatives (Reps) to recruit 150 surfers. The Reps were asked to
communicate the existence and purpose of the Beach Bum Survey to
surfers in their area, and to recruit interested people to the study.
Following extensive media coverage of the survey in June 2015, many
volunteers contacted Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) to express interest in
taking part. An employee at SAS sent interested individuals further
information on the study and screened them for eligibility. Once con-
firmed as eligible, volunteers were sent kits along with the information
sheet, a consent form, a rectal swab (Medical wire, Fecal Transwab Cary
Blair Media), and a short questionnaire. Participating surfers were also
asked to invite a non-bathing friend who was of a similar age, same sex,
and lived in the same region of the UK to take part in the study as their
matched controls. Eight months into data collection, the desired sample
size had not been achieved, and SAS introduced a reward scheme for
their Reps whereby they were rewarded with merchandise for re-
cruiting people to the study. Further recruitment efforts were made at
the Eden Project, as well as at the Newquay Marine Group, and Ply-
mouth Marine Laboratory. Participants were asked to collect their own
rectal swab and to submit it to our laboratory in a pre-paid envelope for
analysis along with their completed anonymous questionnaire (Table
S3). The questionnaire collected some demographic information, data
on the participant's exposure to coastal waters and various risk factors
thought to be associated with gut colonisation by ARB (such as diet,
travel outside the UK, and domestic and occupational exposures to
human or animal faeces).
2.3.2. Estimating the proportion of surfers and non-surfers colonised by
antibiotic-resistant bacteria
Enteric bacteria collected on the swabs were tested for their re-
sistance to the clinical breakpoint concentrations of the 3GC antibiotic,
cefotaxime, and a carbapenem antibiotic, meropenem (EUCAST, 2014).
Culture-based methods were used to isolate cefotaxime-resistant bac-
teria and meropenem-resistant bacteria from each subject, and each
participant was recorded as being colonised by ARB if E. coli grew in the
presence of either antibiotic. Cefotaxime-resistant strains were screened
for the blaCTX-M gene, and meropenem-resistant isolates were screened
for
carbapenemase
genes
commonly
found
in
Enterobacteriaceae
(blaNDM, blaKPC, blaVIM or blaOXA-48) using real-time PCR. As in Section
2.1.4, blaCTX-M gene diversity was characterised and E. coli phylogroups
identified. E. coli O25b-ST131 clones were detected by PCR.
2.3.3. Data analysis
The exposure of interest was a dichotomous variable: recreational
exposure to coastal waters or not. This was determined by whether or
not the respondents self-identified as a frequent surfer (surfs at least
three times per month) or as a control subject (very little exposure to
coastal waters). The risk ratios for the presence of cefotaxime-resistant
E. coli and blaCTX-M-bearing-E. coli were estimated, and 95% test-based
confidence intervals (CI) were reported.
Potential risk factors for gut colonisation by ARB (for example diet,
domestic and occupational exposures to human or animal faeces), were
assessed for their association with both the exposure variable and
outcome variables. Approval for the study was obtained from the
University of Exeter Medical School Research Ethics Committee (re-
ference number 15/02/067).
3. Results
3.1. Results of the environmental monitoring
Of 97 sites sampled, 15 (15%) were found to contain 3GC-resistant
E. coli and 11 (11%) had blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli. All but one region
(Yorkshire and the Humber) were found to have 3GC-resistant E. coli
present, and the prevalence of resistant E. coli was similar across regions
(Fig. 1). Similar levels of resistance were also observed over the sam-
pling period (July to September) (Fig. S1). Across England and Wales,
114,917 E. coli were isolated on non-selective agar: 140 (0.12%) E. coli
were 3GC-resistant, and 83 (0.07%) E. coli were found to harbour
blaCTX-M genes (Table S4).
Fifty eight of the 83 blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli were further char-
acterised to identify the blaCTX-M genotype and host E. coli phylogroup.
However, 25 blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli isolates were lost during sub-cul-
turing and storage and it was not possible to amplify the entire blaCTX-M
gene for genotype identification for six of the isolates. The majority
(86.2%) of blaCTX-M genes that were characterised were identified as
being CTX-M-15, although CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-27 were also found
(Table 1). Four further genotypes were present in Enterobacteriaceae
isolated from two reference wastewater samples (Table S4) but were
not present in bathing water-associated E. coli. Isolates belonging to
phylogroup B2 were the most prevalent phylogroup at 29.3% of the
blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli isolates from bathing water-associated samples.
Of the 17 colonies identified as belonging to phylogroup B2, 11 (64.7%)
were E. coli O25b-ST131 (Table 1).
3.2. The risk of exposure to blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli among coastal water
users
The results of the environmental assessment (Section 3.1) indicate
that on average, 0.07% of E. coli in coastal waters of England and Wales
harbour blaCTX-M genes. The average number of blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli
that water users ingest per session is presented in Table 2. Applying
these estimates to population-level data, 2,536,932 water sports ses-
sions occurred in England and Wales in 2015 that resulted in people
ingesting at least one blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli (Table S5). These results
indicate that there is a risk of water users swallowing blaCTX-M-bearing
E. coli, and that surfers are at a particularly high risk of being exposed.
3.3. Results of the Beach Bum Survey: a cross-sectional survey to investigate
the link between surfing and gut colonisation by antibiotic resistant bacteria
Of the 294 volunteers who submitted data, 273 were suitable for
inclusion in the study: 143 from surfers and 130 from controls (Fig. 2).
Of the 143 surfers, 13 (9.1%) were faecal carriers of E. coli that were
phenotypically resistant to cefotaxime, as compared to four of the 130
controls (3.1%), giving a risk ratio of 2.95 (95% CI 1.05 to 8.32,
p = 0.040) (Table 3), and nine (6.3%) surfers were found to be carriers
of blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli, as compared to two (1.5%) controls (risk

Environment International 114 (2018) 326–333
328
 ratio = 4.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 16.4, p = 0.046) (Table 3).
Risk factors collected by the questionnaire were assessed for their
association with being a surfer (Table 4). There were no major differ-
ences in the distribution of risk factors between surfers and controls,
with the exception of sex, age, exposure to coastal environments, and
doing water sports in non-coastal environments: surfers tended to be
males and younger, and tended to have been in the sea recently, and
more frequently. They also tend to do non-water sports recreational
activities (such as walking, fishing, sunbathing, and rock pooling) at
beaches compared to the controls. However, none of the investigated
risk factors were found to also be associated with either outcome
(carriage of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli or blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli). For
this reason, and because too few participants had the outcome of in-
terest, risk metrics were not adjusted for confounders.
Again, most (90.1%) CTX-M-producing E. coli isolated from survey
participants carried blaCTX-M-15 (Table 5), although one subject was
colonised by CTX-M-57-producing E. coli. As with the bathing water,
most blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli isolated from the volunteers belonged to
phylogenetic group B2, and all of these were E. coli O25b-ST131.
Meropenem resistance was rare among the bacteria isolated from
human subjects. No meropenem-resistant E. coli were isolated, however
one surfer (0.7%) and one control (0.8%) were colonised by mer-
openem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (Table S6). No association was
identified between surfing and gut colonisation by meropenem-re-
sistant bacteria (risk ratio = 0.91, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.4, p = 0.946).
None of these isolates contained the carbapenemase genes commonly
found in Enterobacteriaceae (blaNDM, blaKPC, blaVIM or blaOXA-48).
4. Discussion
Escherichia coli (including those belonging to the virulent ST131
clonal lineage) harbouring blaCTX-M are present in coastal waters of
England and Wales. While the percentage of E. coli in bathing waters
harbouring blaCTX-M is low (0.07%), levels are high enough to pose an
exposure risk to water users, with over 2.5 million exposure events
estimated to have occurred in 2015. One group of water users, surfers,
were found to be at a particularly high risk of exposure to blaCTX-M-

 bearing E. coli and were recruited into a cross-sectional survey to in-
vestigate whether surfers regularly using coastal waters are at an in-
creased risk of colonisation by these ARB compared to individuals
rarely exposed to coastal waters. In the Beach Bum Survey, an asso-
ciation was found between regular surfing and gut colonisation by ce-
fotaxime-resistant E. coli. Surfers were approximately three times as
likely as people who do not surf to be colonised by cefotaxime-resistant
E. coli (risk ratio = 2.95, 95% CI 1.05 to 8.32, p = 0.040). Similarly, an
important association was found between recreational use of coastal
waters and gut colonisation by blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli. People who
regularly surf or body board were four times as likely to be colonised by
E. coli harbouring this gene (risk ratio = 4.09, 95% CI 1.04 to 16.6,
p = 0.046).
These findings are of public health significance: blaCTX-M genes en-
code resistance to multiple antibiotics, such as cephalosporins, which
have been classed as essential medicines by the World Health
Organization as they are the “sole therapy or one of a few alternatives
to treat serious human disease” (Collignon et al., 2009). Characterisa-
tion of the blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli revealed of the 11 people colonised
by blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli, seven were colonised by E. coli O25b-ST131,
a pathogenic strain of E. coli (Clermont et al., 2009; Rogers et al., 2011).
Surfers were more than five times as likely as people who do not surf to
be colonised by blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli O25b-ST131, although this as-
sociation had wide confidence intervals and was not statistically sig-
nificant (risk ratio = 5.45, 95% CI 0.85 to 35.1, p = 0.074). Mer-
openem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae were also isolated from survey
participants. Enterobacter cloacae is an opportunistic pathogen, causing
serious infections in susceptible individuals (Davin-Regli and Pages,
2015). However, there is little evidence of an association between
surfing and gut colonisation by meropenem-resistant bacteria.
While surfers colonised by potentially pathogenic ARB may by
asymptomatic, gut bacteria are a major source of infection, and these
bacteria may cause problems if colonised individuals develop a health
condition in the future that makes them more susceptible to infections
(Asir et al., 2015; Manaia, 2017). Furthermore, water users may be
contributing to the overall carriage of ARB in the community, and may

 spread ARB among the wider population (Valverde et al., 2008). A
higher community carriage of ARB puts vulnerable people (such as
immunocompromised people) at increased risk of acquiring ARB. This
constitutes a serious threat to the health of these susceptible in-
dividuals, who may subsequently develop drug-resistant infections.
The prevalence of colonisation by blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli in the
epidemiological survey (6.3% and 1.5% in surfers and controls re-
spectively) is lower than the 11.1% recently reported in a UK com-
munity (Wickramasinghe et al., 2012). This is probably due to the
eligibility criteria set for this study, which excluded people who were
likely to have been colonised in other environments. In addition, a large
number of survey participants lived in the Southwest of England (Table
S7), where there are lower population densities and less immigration;
factors which are thought to impede the spread of ARB among members
of rural communities (Office for National Statistics, 2013; Rienzo and
Vargas-Silva, 2014; Wickramasinghe et al., 2012). Despite the low
prevalence of colonisation by resistant E. coli in the epidemiological
survey, the risk is still three times higher in bathers compared to non-
bathers, and the risk ratios presented are greater than those reported in
previous studies specifically investigating acquisition of ESBL-produ-
cing Enterobacteriaceae in healthcare settings (Ebrahimi et al., 2014;
Munday et al., 2004; Valverde et al., 2008). This suggests that the risk
of colonisation by ARB associated with exposure to natural environ-
ments could be more important than previously thought. There are
likely many different ways people can be exposed to ARB (such as by
eating contaminated food), so understanding the various means by
which people are exposed to and colonised by ARB, as well as the risk
magnitude and the number of people at risk will allow the formulation
of effective strategies to reduce the spread of ARB and may have im-
plications for the way we consider community acquisition of ARB.
The results of environmental monitoring (Section 3.1) are likely to
be an underestimate of the proportion of resistant bacteria and re-
sistance genes in coastal environments (Leonard et al., 2015). One
group of culturable bacteria resistant to two clinically important anti-
biotics was investigated, although resistance among non-E. coli coli-
forms isolated from bathing waters and Beach Bum Survey participants
was also examined (Tables S4 and S6). While the proportion of bathing
water E. coli and non-E. coli coliforms harbouring blaCTX-M was the
same, among the coliforms isolated from Beach Bum Survey partici-
pants, only E. coli were found to harbour blaCTX-M (Table S6). As an-
ticipated blaCTX-M-15 was the most common genotype identified in E. coli
from both bathing waters and survey participants (Hawkey and Jones,
2009). A rarer genotype, blaCTX-M-57, was identified in one surfer, which
was not found in bathing waters, and blaCTX-M-1 and blaCTX-M-27 were
found in bathing waters but not in survey participants. These ob-
servations could be explained by the fact the environmental monitoring
was done three years prior to the Beach Bum Survey, and the diversity
of blaCTX-M borne by E. coli in bathing waters could have changed.
Additionally, the diversity of blaCTX-M in bathing waters was based upon
fewer than 100 samples, which might not have captured the extent of
genetic diversity in this environment.
Participants were not screened for their colonisation status prior to
surfing, and therefore it is uncertain that surfers acquired their ARB
from coastal waters. However, by excluding people who had likely been
exposed in other environments (see Appendix for eligibility criteria),
other known sources of contamination were minimized, as well as en-
suring that people with infections severe enough to require hospitali-
sation or treatment with antibiotics were excluded. There were no-
ticeable differences in the age and sex of participants between surfers
and non-surfing control subjects (Table 4). However, while surfers were
more likely to be male and younger than 45, there was no association
between sex or age and colonisation by blaCTX-M-bearing E. coli. Other
potential confounders, like diet, were also investigated for their asso-
ciation with the exposure and outcome under investigation, but none
were found to be confounders. It possible that unmeasured confounders
(such as whether participants were experiencing minor illnesses), and

 systematic

between

respondents
and
non-re-
spondents might affect participants' exposure to ARB or susceptibility to
colonisation by ARB. Despite the wide confidence intervals surrounding
the risk ratio estimates, the lower limits are still above the null value,
indicating an overall increase in risk to UK surfers of gut colonisation by
resistant E. coli. The risk of colonisation by ARB among surfers might be
different in other countries. For example, in countries with tropical
climates and warmer waters, surfers might typically be exposed much
more frequently than 3 times per month. Similarly, in places where
people swim in the sea more often, the risk might be substantially
higher than the risks reported in the UK and other countries with
temperate climates.
There are numerous and complex interactions at play between hu-
mans, ARB reservoirs, and ARB, affecting the survival, dispersal, in-
fectivity, pathogenicity and persistence of ARB (Ashbolt et al., 2013;
Manaia, 2017). Further research is essential in order to understand
these interactions and their impact upon public health. Coastal waters
represents one compartment of many natural and non-hospital en-
vironments, which all require further investigation of their role in the
transmission of ARB. The clinical significance of higher rates of colo-
nisation is suspected to be important based on current evidence, but are
yet to be confirmed in surfers.
5. Conclusions
For the first time, the risk of exposure to E. coli harbouring mobile
blaCTX-M genes in coastal waters has been quantified. Furthermore, this
is the first study to identify an association between surfing and gut
colonisation by antibiotic-resistant E. coli. Further work must be done to
establish the acquisition of ARB from coastal waters and other natural
environments which have been identified as important reservoirs of
ARB.
