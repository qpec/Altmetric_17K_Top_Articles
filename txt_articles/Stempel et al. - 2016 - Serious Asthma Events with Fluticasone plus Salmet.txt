BACKGROUND
The safe and appropriate use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) for the treat-
ment of asthma has been widely debated. In two large clinical trials, investigators 
found a potential risk of serious asthma-related events associated with LABAs. This 
study was designed to evaluate the risk of administering the LABA salmeterol in 
combination with an inhaled glucocorticoid, fluticasone propionate.
METHODS
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, adolescent and adult patients 
(age, ≥12 years) with persistent asthma were assigned to receive either fluticasone 
with salmeterol or fluticasone alone for 26 weeks. All the patients had a history of 
a severe asthma exacerbation in the year before randomization but not during the 
previous month. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had a history of life-
threatening or unstable asthma. The primary safety end point was the first serious 
asthma-related event (death, endotracheal intubation, or hospitalization). Nonin-
feriority of fluticasone–salmeterol to fluticasone alone was defined as an upper 
boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the risk of the primary safety end point 
of less than 2.0. The efficacy end point was the first severe asthma exacerbation.
RESULTS
Of 11,679 patients who were enrolled, 67 had 74 serious asthma-related events, 
with 36 events in 34 patients in the fluticasone–salmeterol group and 38 events in 
33 patients in the fluticasone-only group. The hazard ratio for a serious asthma-
related event in the fluticasone–salmeterol group was 1.03 (95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.64 to 1.66), and noninferiority was achieved (P 
= 
0.003). There were no 
asthma-related deaths; 2 patients in the fluticasone-only group underwent asthma-
related intubation. The risk of a severe asthma exacerbation was 21% lower in the 
fluticasone–salmeterol group than in the fluticasone-only group (hazard ratio, 
0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89), with at least one severe asthma exacerbation occurring 
in 480 of 5834 patients (8%) in the fluticasone–salmeterol group, as compared 
with 597 of 5845 patients (10%) in the fluticasone-only group (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
Patients who received salmeterol in a fixed-dose combination with fluticasone did 
not have a significantly higher risk of serious asthma-related events than did those 
who received fluticasone alone. Patients receiving fluticasone–salmeterol had 
fewer severe asthma exacerbations than did those in the fluticasone-only group.

Serious Asthma Events with Fluticasone–Salmeterol
T
he safe and appropriate use of 
short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) and 
long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) for the 
treatment of asthma has been widely debated.1 
In early reports, SABAs were associated with an 
increased risk of asthma-related death.2,3 In the 
1990s, analyses suggested that high use of SABAs 
(>1.5 to 2 canisters per month) might increase 
the risk of death or near-fatal asthma.4-6 In one 
of these studies, the authors postulated that high 
use of SABAs was either a marker of poorly con-
trolled asthma or a “toxic effect of the medica-
tions or their vehicles.”6
Two large clinical trials, the Serevent Nation-
wide Surveillance (SNS) trial7 and the Salmeterol 
Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART),8 
were designed to address whether regular use of 
the LABA salmeterol was associated with an in-
creased risk of serious asthma events. At that 
time, inhaled glucocorticoids were not part of 
routine asthma care. Although the SNS trial 
showed significantly fewer withdrawals because 
of worsening asthma with salmeterol than with 
salbutamol, the rate of asthma-related deaths 
was higher among salmeterol-treated patients, 
although the difference was not significant.7 In 
SMART, more patients receiving salmeterol than 
receiving placebo died, both from respiratory-
related events (24 vs. 11) and from asthma-related 
events (13 vs. 3).8 This risk was greater among 
black patients than among white patients.8 Al-
though 47% of the patients were receiving in-
haled glucocorticoids at baseline, SMART was 
not designed to address whether concurrent use 
of inhaled glucocorticoids altered the risk.8
In 2008, the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) requested that the four manufacturers of 
LABA-containing medications for the treatment 
of asthma assess the rates of asthma-related 
death, intubation, and hospitalization by analyz-
ing the data in all their studies of LABAs. In 
response, GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of 
salmeterol, compared data regarding salmeterol 
with non-LABA data in a meta-analysis9; this 
meta-analysis showed higher rates of asthma-
related death and hospitalization among pa-
tients receiving salmeterol, with inhaled gluco-
corticoids dispensed in a separate inhaler (i.e., 
inhaled glucocorticoids were not part of the 
treatment protocol and may or may not have 
been used), than among patients receiving non-
LABA treatment.9 There were no asthma-related 
deaths or imbalances in the rates of asthma-
related hospitalization when salmeterol was dis-
pensed in a fixed-dose combination with flutica-
sone propionate.9,10
In 2010, the FDA requested that each of the 
four manufacturers undertake a large prospec-
tive trial to evaluate whether a LABA added to 
an inhaled glucocorticoid would be noninferior 
to an inhaled glucocorticoid alone with respect to 
the risk of a serious asthma-related event (hospi-
talization, endotracheal intubation, or death).11 
The composite of serious asthma-related events 
was selected since asthma-related deaths are rare 
in clinical trials.
We designed this prospective, multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind trial (AUSTRI) with a 
primary objective of establishing whether the 
risk of serious asthma-related events would be 
higher when salmeterol was used concomitantly 
with fluticasone as a fixed-dose combination 
(fluticasone–salmeterol) than if fluticasone was 
used alone. A secondary objective was to evalu-
ate whether fluticasone–salmeterol was superior 
to fluticasone with respect to prespecified mea-
sures of efficacy.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
From November 2011 through June 2015, we 
enrolled adolescent and adult patients (age, ≥12 
years) with moderate-to-severe asthma at 710 
centers in 33 countries. All the patients attended 
a screening and randomization visit, which was 
followed by a 26-week active treatment period 
and a 1-week follow-up period (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org).
Members of a common joint oversight steer-
ing committee, a joint adjudication committee 
(which was responsible for uniform determina-
tion of asthma-relatedness for study end points), 
and a joint data and safety monitoring commit-
tee were charged with ensuring responsible con-
duct of the trial and the safety of all the patients. 
An independent, trial-specific data and safety 
monitoring committee reviewed trial-specific 
safety data for patients every 6 months, with one 
planned, formal interim statistical analysis per-
formed after approximately half the expected 87 
events had occurred (see the trial protocol, avail-
able at NEJM.org).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Scientific oversight of the trial was provided 
by employees of GlaxoSmithKline, including the 
authors, who were collectively responsible for the 
design and conduct of the trial. The joint steer-
ing committee and the FDA provided advice on 
the trial, which was harmonized with trials 
conducted by the other three manufacturers of 
LABA-containing medications. The initial draft 
of the manuscript was written by the first au-
thor, and all the authors worked collaboratively 
to prepare the final content. Editorial support 
was provided by a professional medical writer 
who was paid by GlaxoSmithKline. Statistical 
analyses were performed by employees of Glaxo-
SmithKline and PAREXEL International. All the 
authors had full access to the data and vouch for 
the accuracy and completeness of all data and 
analyses and agreed to the submission of the 
manuscript for publication.
Ethical approval was obtained from the rele-
vant ethics committee or institutional review 
board at each site. The trial was conducted in 
accordance with Good Clinical Practice guide-
lines and the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
Trial Population
Eligible patients had at least a 1-year history of 
asthma,12,13 required daily medications for asth-
ma control, and had received treatment with 
systemic glucocorticoids for an asthma exacer-
bation or had been hospitalized for an asthma 
exacerbation during the previous 12 months, 
with the exclusion of the 30 days before random-
ization.
Patients were excluded from the study if they 
had a history of life-threatening asthma, ciga-
rette smoking for more than 10 pack-years, or 
unstable asthma. (A detailed description of the 
trial criteria is provided in the Methods section 
in the Supplementary Appendix.) All the patients 
or their legal guardians provided written in-
formed consent.
Study Randomization and Treatments
Randomization was performed with the use of 
an interactive voice–response system, with strat-
ification of patients in six groups according to 
the patients’ current asthma medications and 
assessment of asthma control (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Asthma control was 
assessed at screening and during office visits 
with the use of the Asthma Control Question-
naire 6 (ACQ-6), on which asthma symptoms are 
rated on a scale of 0 to 6, with higher values 
indicating worse symptoms.14
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
within stratification groups to receive a combi-
nation of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol 
(at a dose of 100 μg of fluticasone and 50 μg of 
salmeterol, 250 μg and 50 μg, respectively, or 
500 μg and 50 μg, respectively) or fluticasone 
propionate alone (at a dose of 100 μg, 250 μg, 
or 500 μg), administered twice daily in a masked 
DISKUS dry-powder inhaler (GlaxoSmithKline). 
Study treatment was double-blinded with respect 
to fluticasone–salmeterol versus fluticasone alone 
but not with respect to the dose of inhaled glu-
cocorticoid. All treatments were presented in 
identical packaging. Open-label rescue albuterol 
or salbutamol administered through a metered-
dose inhaler was also supplied to all patients.
Study End Points
Safety
The primary safety end point was the first seri-
ous asthma-related event, a composite end point 
that included death, endotracheal intubation, and 
hospitalization. Events were reviewed by mem-
bers of the joint adjudication committee who 
were unaware of the study-group assignments. 
All hospitalization events underwent initial 
screening by a member of the joint adjudication 
committee, and if the patient’s condition was 
considered to be potentially asthma-related, a 
complete adjudication followed. All intubations 
and deaths were fully adjudicated.
All nonserious adverse events leading to with-
drawal from the trial and all serious adverse 
events were documented. The vital status and 
mortality of all patients who received at least one 
dose of a study drug were assessed after the 
6-month trial period.
Efficacy
The main efficacy end point was the first se-
vere asthma exacerbation, which was defined 
as asthma deterioration that led to the use of 
systemic glucocorticoids for at least 3 days or an 
asthma-related hospitalization or emergency 
department visit that led to the use of systemic 
glucocorticoids.15 A secondary measure of ef-
ficacy was the use of rescue albuterol or salbu-
tamol.

Serious Asthma Events with Fluticasone–Salmeterol
Statistical Analysis
The primary safety objective was assessed by 
means of a stratified Cox proportional-hazards 
regression model of the time until the first seri-
ous asthma-related outcome, with a term for 
randomized treatment (fluticasone–salmeterol or 
fluticasone alone) and with the randomization 
stratum according to the asthma treatment be-
ing received and the level of asthma control at 
baseline as the stratification factor. Noninferior-
ity of fluticasone–salmeterol to fluticasone alone 
was defined as an upper boundary of the 95% 
confidence interval for the risk of the primary 
safety end point of less than 2.0. In the two 
treatment groups, data from the three dose 
strata were combined.
We used a Cox proportional-hazards regres-
sion model to test the main efficacy end point. 
The study was not powered to allow formal 
statistical comparison or evaluation of flutica-
sone–salmeterol versus fluticasone alone in sub-
groups. However, for the key subgroups of age 
and race, descriptive analyses were performed, 
and results are expressed as hazard ratios and 
95% confidence intervals.
In calculating the sample size for the primary 
safety end point, we assumed that the rate in the 
fluticasone-only group would be 0.0075 patients 
with an event during the 26-week trial. The sam-
ple size was adjusted to accommodate one interim 
statistical analysis when approximately half the 
expected number of composite end points had 
occurred. We used the Haybittle–Peto method 
for managing the alpha spending function over 
the interim analysis and the final analysis.16,17 We 
determined that a sample size of 11,664 partici-
pants would allow the observation of 87 patients 
with the composite end point, which would give 
the study 90% power to show the noninferiority 
of fluticasone–salmeterol to fluticasone alone, 
with the use of the log-rank test, at a one-sided 
alpha level of 0.025, and to reject the null hypoth-
esis that the risk associated with fluticasone–
salmeterol, as compared with fluticasone alone, 
would be greater than the noninferiority margin.
The primary analysis was performed in the 
intention-to-treat population, which included all 
the patients who had undergone randomization 
and received at least one dose of fluticasone–
salmeterol or fluticasone alone. For the primary 
analysis, the data included composite events that 
occurred within 6 months after the first dose or 
7 days after the last dose of a study drug, which-
ever interval from randomization was greater. 
A modified intention-to-treat analysis included 
only data collected up to 7 days after each pa-
tient stopped the study drug. Four efficacy sub-
groups that were classified according to the 
level of asthma control at baseline (controlled 
or not controlled) and previous asthma therapy 
(inhaled glucocorticoids or inhaled glucocorti-
coids plus LABA) were prespecified for analysis 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Results
Trial Population
A total of 11,751 patients underwent randomiza-
tion at 694 of the 710 centers that participated 
in the trial. Of these patients, 72 (0.6%) did not 
receive a dose of a study drug, so 11,679 patients 
were included in the intention-to-treat popula-
tion (5834 in the fluticasone–salmeterol group 
and 5845 in the fluticasone-only group) (Fig. 1, 
and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The demographic characteristics of the patients 
were similar in the two groups (Table 1). The 
median rate of adherence to study medications (as 
determined by the dose counter in the DISKUS 
device) was 95.1% in each of the two groups.
Safety
Serious Asthma-Related Events
Among the 11,679 patients, 67 had 74 serious 
asthma-related events, with 36 events in 34 pa-
tients in the fluticasone–salmeterol group and 
38 events in 33 patients in the fluticasone-only 
group (Table 2). The hazard ratio for a serious 
asthma-related event in the fluticasone–salme-
terol group was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.64 to 1.66). The upper boundary of the 
confidence interval did not exceed 2.0; therefore, 
fluticasone–salmeterol was shown to be nonin-
ferior to fluticasone alone (P 
= 
0.003). The Kaplan–
Meier curve for the primary safety end point is 
shown in Figure 2.
There were no asthma-related deaths in either 
group. One or more asthma-related hospitaliza-
tions were reported in 34 patients in the flutica-
sone–salmeterol group and in 33 patients in the 
fluticasone-only group (with a total of 36 asthma-
related hospitalizations in each group) (Table 2). 
There were no significant differences in the 
rates of asthma-related hospitalization accord-

although the trial was not powered to detect 
noninferiority in these subgroups (Table S4 in

patients in the fluticasone–salmeterol group.

Serious Asthma Events with Fluticasone–Salmeterol
Other Safety Outcomes
Adverse events leading to withdrawal from a 
study treatment were reported in 165 of 5834 
patients (3%) in the fluticasone–salmeterol group 
and in 180 of 5845 (3%) in the fluticasone-only 
group. The incidence of serious adverse events 
was 2% in each of the two groups (Table S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Serious respira-
tory adverse events were observed in 33 patients 
(<1%) in the fluticasone–salmeterol group and in 
38 patients (<1%) in the fluticasone-only group.
Nine deaths occurred during the study, three 
in the fluticasone–salmeterol group and six in 
the fluticasone-only group; none were indepen-
dently adjudicated as being asthma-related. Vital 
status was determined for all but 2 patients. 
(Details are provided in Sections 3 and 4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Severe Asthma Exacerbations and Use  
of Rescue Inhaler
At least one severe asthma exacerbation was re-
ported in 480 of 5834 patients (8%) in the fluti-
casone–salmeterol group and in 597 of 5845 
patients (10%) in the fluticasone-only group. 
The hazard ratio for a serious asthma exacerba-
tion in the fluticasone–salmeterol group was 
0.79 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89; P<0.001) when age 
was included as a covariate. For the four pre-
specified efficacy subgroups (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), the risk of an asthma 
exacerbation was 16 to 32% lower in the flutica-
sone–salmeterol group than in the fluticasone-
only group (Table 3). Among the four subgroups, 
the between-group difference was significant 
only in the one in which asthma was well con-
trolled on a regimen of inhaled glucocorticoids 
plus LABA at baseline. In that subgroup, there 
was a 24% lower risk of a severe asthma exacer-
bation in the fluticasone–salmeterol group than 
in the fluticasone-only group.
In all age groups, the risk of a severe asthma 
exacerbation was consistently lower among those 
treated with fluticasone–salmeterol than among 
those treated with fluticasone alone (Table 3), 
with the largest difference (a 35% lower risk) 
seen among adolescents. A total of 79 black pa-
tients in each group had an exacerbation (hazard 
ratio for fluticasone–salmeterol vs. fluticasone 
alone, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.31). The mean and 
median number of puffs of rescue medication 
per day were slightly lower in the fluticasone–
salmeterol group than in the fluticasone-only 
group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Discussion
We found that among patients with moderate-
to-severe asthma and a history of exacerbation 
during the previous year, the risk of serious 
asthma-related events was no greater when sal-
meterol was delivered by inhaler in a fixed-dose 
combination with fluticasone propionate than 
when fluticasone was administered alone. This 
finding was consistent with the results of pre-
vious trials and meta-analyses of fluticasone–
salmeterol,9,10,18 which showed no greater risk of 
serious asthma-related events among patients 
receiving fluticasone–salmeterol than among 
those receiving fluticasone alone.
Several meta-analyses that have investigated 
possible links between the use of LABAs and 
asthma-related death have suggested that LABAs 
are associated with a higher risk of death than 
are non-LABA medications.10,19,20 However, the 
concomitant use of inhaled glucocorticoids was

Serious Asthma Events with Fluticasone–Salmeterol
salmeterol with non-LABA treatments found an 
increased risk of asthma-related death only when 
salmeterol was dispensed as monotherapy and 
not necessarily when an inhaled glucocorticoid 
was used as concomitant therapy. Of the 35 deaths 
included in that meta-analysis, 30 (86%) were 
observed in the SNS and SMART trials.10 With a 
combined enrollment of more than 50,000 pa-
tients in these trials,7,8 they contributed heavily 
to the data in all the meta-analyses. Thus, fur-
ther clinical trials that specifically addressed the 
use of LABAs plus concurrent inhaled glucocor-
ticoids, as compared with inhaled glucocorticoids 
alone, were warranted, particularly because stan-
dards of care for asthma have changed since the 
time that earlier trials were conducted and be-
cause the use of inhaled glucocorticoids was not 
controlled in the earlier trials. No patients who 
were treated with fluticasone–salmeterol or 
fluticasone alone in our trial died from asthma-
related causes, which provides further evidence 
that the use of fluticasone–salmeterol does not 
increase the risk of asthma-related death.
In our trial, the risk of asthma-related hospi-
talization was low, approximately 1 per 100 pa-
tient-years, and corresponds to low incidences 
that were observed in other studies involving 
similar populations.9,18,21,22 Since the patients in 
our trial were at high risk for asthma-related 
events, the low incidence of serious asthma-
related events suggests that treatment adherence 
may be key to controlling asthma. The associa-
tion between these events and fluticasone–sal-
meterol that we observed is consistent with that 
in a nested case–control analysis of inhaled 
glucocorticoids plus LABAs, as compared with 
inhaled glucocorticoids alone, in which the rate 
ratio for asthma-related hospitalization among 
patients receiving inhaled glucocorticoids plus 
LABAs, as compared with those receiving in-
haled glucocorticoids alone, was 1.14 (95% CI, 
0.93 to 1.41).23
Studies and reviews that have evaluated the 
safety of SABAs and LABAs have included a dis-
cussion of possible causes of the observed increase 
in the risk of asthma-related death and have noted 
a concern about whether the risk was greater 
among specific age or racial groups.1,8,10,18-20,24-26 
Data from our trial do not support hypotheses 
that specific age or racial groups are at greater 
risk when beta-agonists are used concurrently 
with inhaled glucocorticoids.
Another important finding in our trial is that 
the risk of a severe asthma exacerbation was 
21% lower among patients who were treated 
with fluticasone–salmeterol than among those 
treated with fluticasone alone. The difference 
was most prominent among adolescents, in 
whom the risk was 35% lower. Among patients 
in whom asthma was well controlled on a previ-
ous regimen of inhaled glucocorticoids plus 
LABAs, the risk of a severe asthma exacerbation 
was 24% lower in the fluticasone–salmeterol 
group than in the fluticasone-only group. These 
effect sizes are consistent with a previous meta-
analysis that compared fluticasone–salmeterol 
with fluticasone alone18 and with other trials in 
which patients were included only if they had a 
history of a severe exacerbation in the 12 months 
before randomization.24,27
Studies have shown that routine use of SABAs 
or LABAs without inhaled glucocorticoids in-
creases the risk of serious and potentially fatal 
outcomes among patients with asthma.1-5,7-9 The 
frequent use of SABAs is the hallmark of uncon-
trolled asthma, and escalation in therapy with 
antiinflammatory agents such as inhaled gluco-
corticoids is recommended.12 In addition, LABA 
monotherapy may mask underlying disease by 
providing a temporary reduction in symptoms 
but ultimately placing patients at risk for serious 
exacerbations.28 However, the risks appear to 
be mitigated when beta-agonists are reliably 
used with concomitant inhaled glucocorticoids, 
including with the fixed-dose combination of 
fluticasone–salmeterol.7,9,10,18
Limitations of this trial include its relatively 
short duration of 26 weeks and the infrequent 
occurrence of serious asthma-related events. Also, 
we enrolled patients with moderate-to-severe 
asthma, and the results may not be applicable to 
all patients with asthma. For example, since 
patients with a history of life-threatening or 
unstable asthma were excluded from the study, 
our results cannot be extrapolated to such patients. 
The study was designed with FDA guidance, and 
we assessed a composite end point of serious 
asthma-related events to help address the infre-
quent occurrence of asthma-related death and 
intubation. In addition, although we designed

Serious Asthma Events with Fluticasone–Salmeterol
the trial as a “real world” analysis, adherence was 
high, which may not always occur in real-world 
clinical practice. The extent of underlying in-
flammatory disease in each patient was not 
measured, a factor that may have influenced the 
results; the prespecified efficacy subgroups were 
included to partly counterbalance this limitation.
In conclusion, we found that among patients 
with moderate-to-severe asthma, serious asthma-
related events occurred with similar frequency 
among those receiving 26 weeks of treatment 
with fluticasone–salmeterol and those receiving 
fluticasone alone, which showed the noninferi-
ority of the fixed-dose combination to flutica-
sone alone. The clinical benefits of fluticasone–
salmeterol were significant, with a 21% lower 
risk of a severe asthma exacerbation among pa-
tients who received that therapy than among 
those who received fluticasone alone.
