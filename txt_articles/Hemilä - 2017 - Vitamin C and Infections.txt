Abstract: In the early literature, vitamin C deficiency was associated with pneumonia. After its
identification, a number of studies investigated the effects of vitamin C on diverse infections. A total
of 148 animal studies indicated that vitamin C may alleviate or prevent infections caused by bacteria,
viruses, and protozoa. The most extensively studied human infection is the common cold. Vitamin C
administration does not decrease the average incidence of colds in the general population, yet it
halved the number of colds in physically active people. Regularly administered vitamin C has
shortened the duration of colds, indicating a biological effect. However, the role of vitamin C in
common cold treatment is unclear. Two controlled trials found a statistically significant dose–response,
for the duration of common cold symptoms, with up to 6–8 g/day of vitamin C. Thus, the negative
findings of some therapeutic common cold studies might be explained by the low doses of 3–4 g/day
of vitamin C. Three controlled trials found that vitamin C prevented pneumonia. Two controlled trials
found a treatment benefit of vitamin C for pneumonia patients. One controlled trial reported treatment
benefits for tetanus patients. The effects of vitamin C against infections should be investigated further.

1. Early History on Vitamin C and Infections
Vitamin C was identified in the early twentieth century in the search for a substance, the deficiency
of which would cause scurvy [1,2]. Scurvy was associated with pneumonia in the early literature,
which implies that the factor that cured scurvy might also have an effect on pneumonia.
Alfred Hess (1920) summarized a series of autopsy findings as follows: “pneumonia, lobular
or lobar, is one of the most frequent complications (of scurvy) and causes of death” and “secondary
pneumonias, usually broncho-pneumonic in type, are of common occurrence and in many (scurvy)
epidemics constitute the prevailing cause of death” [3]. He later commented that in “infantile scurvy
... a lack of the antiscorbutic factor (vitamin C) which leads to scurvy, at the same time predisposes
to infections (particularly of the respiratory tract) ... Similar susceptibility to infections goes hand in
hand with adult scurvy” [4]. In the early 1900s, Casimir Funk, who coined the word “vitamin”, noted
that an epidemic of pneumonia in the Sudan disappeared when antiscorbutic (vitamin C-containing)
treatment was given to the numerous cases of scurvy that appeared at about the same time [5].
The great majority of mammals synthesize vitamin C in their bodies, but primates and the guinea
pig cannot. Therefore, the guinea pig is a useful animal model on which to study vitamin C deficiency.
Bacteria were often found in histological sections of scorbutic guinea pigs, so much so that some
early authors assumed that scurvy might be an infectious disease. However, Hess (1920) concluded
that such results merely showed that the tissues of scorbutic animals frequently harbor bacteria, and
“there is no doubt that the invasion of the blood-stream does occur readily in the course of scurvy,
but this takes place generally after the disease has developed and must be regarded as a secondary
phenomenon and therefore unessential from an etiological standpoint. Indeed one of the striking
and important symptoms of scurvy is the marked susceptibility to infection” [3]. When summarizing

autopsy findings of experimental scurvy in the guinea pig, Hess also noted that “Pneumonia is met
with very frequently and constitutes a common terminal infection”.
Vitamin C was considered as an explanation for scurvy, which was regarded as a disease of the
connective tissues, since many of the symptoms such as poor wound healing implied crucial effects on
the connective tissues. Therefore, the mainstream view in medicine regarded vitamin C as a vitamin
that safeguards the integrity of connective tissues [6]. The implications of the earlier research by Hess
and others were superseded. This historical background might explain the current lack of interest in
the effects of vitamin C on infections, even though firm evidence that vitamin C influences infections
has been available for decades.
Early literature on vitamin C and infections was reviewed by Clausen (1934), Robertson (1934),
and Perla and Marmorston (1937) [5,7,8]. Those reviews are thorough descriptions of the large number
of early studies on the topic of this review. Scanned versions of those reviews and English translations
of many non-English papers cited in this review are available at the home page of this author [9].
The book on scurvy by Hess (1920) is available in a digitized format [3].
2. Biology Relevant to the Effects of Vitamin C on Infections
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) emphasizes that in the evaluation of treatments researchers
should focus primarily on clinically relevant outcomes, and little weight should be put on biological
explanations. Therefore, this review focuses on infections and not on the immune system. Immune
system effects are surrogates for clinical effects and there are numerous cases when surrogates had
poor correlations with clinically relevant outcomes [10]. Nevertheless, biology provides a useful
background when we consider the plausibility of vitamin C to influence infections.
2.1. Dose–Concentration Relationship
The vitamin C level in plasma of people in good health becomes saturated at about 70 µmol/L
when the intake is about 0.2 g/day [11]. On the other hand, when vitamin C intake is below 0.1 g/day,
there is a steep relationship between plasma vitamin C level and the dose of the vitamin. Clinical
scurvy may appear when the plasma concentration falls below 11 µmol/L, which corresponds to an
intake of less than 0.01 g/day [12–14]. Thus, when healthy people have a dietary intake of about
0.2 g/day of vitamin C, there is usually no reason to expect a response to vitamin C supplementation.
This does not apply universally because certain studies have shown the benefits of supplementation,
even though the baseline intake was as high as 0.5 g/day (see below). If the initial vitamin C intake is
lower than about 0.1 g/day, effects of vitamin C supplementation may be expected on the basis of the
dose–concentration curve. Nevertheless, this argument does not apply to patients with infections since
their vitamin C metabolism is altered and they have decreased vitamin C levels (see below).
2.2. Infections Increase Oxidative Stress
Vitamin C is an antioxidant. Therefore, any effects of vitamin C may be most prominent under
conditions when oxidative stress is elevated. Many infections lead to the activation of phagocytes,
which release oxidizing agents referred to as reactive oxygen species (ROS). These play a role in the
processes that lead to the deactivation of viruses and the killing of bacteria [15]. However, many of
the ROS appear to be harmful to the host cells, and in some cases they seem to play a role in the
pathogenesis of infections [16,17]. Vitamin C is an efficient water-soluble antioxidant and may protect
host cells against the actions of ROS released by phagocytes. Phagocytes have a specific transport
system by which the oxidized form of vitamin C (dehydroascorbic acid) is imported into the cell where
it is converted into the reduced form of vitamin C [18,19].
Influenza A infection in mice resulted in a decrease in vitamin C concentration in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid, which was concomitant with an increase in dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of
vitamin C [20], and in vitamin C deficiency influenza led to greater lung pathology [21]. Respiratory
syncytial virus decreased the expression of antioxidant enzymes thereby increasing oxidative

damage [22]. Bacterial toxins have also led to the loss of vitamin C from many tissues in animal
studies [1] (p. 6).
Increased ROS production during the immune response to pathogens can explain the decrease
in vitamin C levels seen in several infections. There is evidence that plasma, leukocyte and urinary
vitamin C levels decrease in the common cold and in other infections [1,23]. Hume and Weyers (1973)
reported that vitamin C levels in leukocytes halved when subjects contracted a cold and returned to the
original level one week after recovery [24]. Vitamin C levels are also decreased by pneumonia [25–28].
Decreases in vitamin C levels during various infections imply that vitamin C administration
might have a treatment effect on many patients with infections. There is no reason to assume that the
saturation of plasma or leukocyte vitamin C levels during infections is reached by the 0.2 g/day intake
of vitamin C that applies to healthy people (see above). In particular, Hume and Weyers (1973) showed
that supplementation at the level of 0.2 g/day was insufficient to normalize leukocyte vitamin C levels
in common cold patients, but when 6 g/day of vitamin C was administered, the decline in leukocyte
vitamin C induced by the common cold was essentially abolished [24].
2.3. Vigorous Physical Activity Increases Oxidative Stress
Heavy physical stress leads to the elevation of oxidative stress [29]. Therefore, responses to
vitamin C might be observed when people are particularly active physically. Electron spin resonance
studies have shown that vitamin C administration decreased the levels of free radicals generated
during exercise [30] and vitamin C administration attenuated the increases in oxidative stress markers
caused by exercise [31]. Therefore, vitamin C supplementation might have beneficial effects on people
who are under physical stress. In such cases there is no reason to assume that 0.2 g/day of vitamin C
might lead to maximal effects of the vitamin. Direct evidence of benefits of vitamin C supplementation
to physically active people was found in three randomized trials in which 0.5 to 2 g/day of vitamin C
prevented exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [32,33].
2.4. Vitamin C May Protect against Stress Caused by Cold and Hot Environments
Studies in animals and humans have indicated that vitamin C may protect against stress caused
by cold and hot environments [34–37]. Some common cold studies with positive results investigated
physically active participants in cold environments and other studies investigated marathon runners
in South Africa (see below). Therefore, the effects of vitamin C in the protection against cold or heat
stress might also be relevant when explaining the benefits in those studies.
2.5. Marginally Low Vitamin C Status Might Lead to Benefi
ts of Supplementation
It seems evident that any effects of vitamin C supplementation may be more prominent when
the baseline vitamin C level is particularly low. As noted above, a profound vitamin C deficiency
was associated with pneumonia in the early literature. It seems plausible that less severe vitamin C
deficiency, which may be called “marginal vitamin C deficiency”, can also be associated with increased
risk and severity of infections, although the effects may be less pronounced than those caused by scurvy.
Low vitamin C levels are not just of historical relevance. Cases of scurvy in hospitals have been
described in several recent case reports [38,39]. One survey estimated that about 10% of hospitalized
elderly patients had scurvy [40]. Surveys have also shown that plasma vitamin C levels below
11 µmol/L were found for 14% of males and 10% of females in the USA, 19% of males and 13% of
females in India, 40% of elderly people living in institutions in the UK, 23% of children and 39% of
women in Mexico, and 79%–93% of men in Western Russia. Moreover, 45% of a cohort of pregnant
women in rural India had plasma vitamin C levels below 4 µmol/L and the mean plasma vitamin C
level fell to 10 µmol/L in a cohort of pregnant or lactating women in Gambian villages in the rainy
season [41].
The mean vitamin C intake in adults in the USA has been about 0.10 g/day, but 10% of the
population has had intake levels of less than 0.04 g/day [14]. Thus, if low intake levels of vitamin C
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
4 of 28
have adverse effects on the incidence and severity of infections, this may be important also in
population groups in western countries, and not just in developing countries.
2.6. Vitamin C Has Effects on the Immune System
Vitamin C levels in white blood cells are tens of times higher than in plasma, which may indicate
functional roles of the vitamin in these immune system cells. Vitamin C has been shown to affect
the functions of phagocytes, production of interferon, replication of viruses, and maturation of
T-lymphocytes, etc. in laboratory studies [1,23,42–44]. Some of the effects of vitamin C on the immune
system may be non-specific and in some cases other antioxidants had similar effects.
2.7. The Diverse Biochemical, Physiological, and Psychological Effects of Vitamin C
Biochemistry textbooks usually mention the role of vitamin C in collagen hydroxylation.
However, the survival time of vitamin C deficient guinea pigs was extended by carnitine [45]
and by glutathione [46], which indicates that scurvy is not solely explained by defects in collagen
hydroxylation, and it is not clear whether hydroxylation is important at all in explaining scurvy [6].
Vitamin C participates in the enzymatic synthesis of dopamine, carnitine, a number of neuroendocrine
peptides, etc. [6,47–50]. Vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant, as mentioned above.
Experimentally induced vitamin C deficiency leads to depression and fatigue [11,51]. Recently,
vitamin C was reported to improve the mood of acutely hospitalized patients [52,53]. Such effects
cannot be explained by collagen metabolism, and vitamin C effects on the immune system are not
plausible explanations either. Instead, the effects of vitamin C on the neuroendocrine system or
carnitine metabolism might explain such effects. Thus, if vitamin C has beneficial effects on patients
with infections, that does not unambiguously indicate that these effects are mediated by the immune
system per se.
2.8. The Effects of Antioxidants against Infections May Be Heterogeneous
It is quite a common assumption that the effects of vitamins are uniform. Thus, if there is benefit,
it is often assumed that the same benefit applies to all people. However, it seems much more likely
that the effects of vitamins, including vitamin C, vary between people depending on biology and
their lifestyle. Thus, it is possible that there are benefits (or harms) restricted to special conditions or
to particular people. In the case of vitamin E, there is very strong evidence for the heterogeneity in
its effects on pneumonia [54,55] and on the common cold [56]. Although the factors modifying the
effects of vitamin E cannot be extrapolated to vitamin C, it seems probable that there is comparable
heterogeneity in the effects of vitamin C.
3. Infections in Animals
Early research showed that severe deficiency of vitamin C increased the incidence and severity
of infections in guinea pigs. Hemilä (2006) carried out a systematic search of animal studies on
vitamin C and infections and analyzed their findings [1], which are summarized in Tables 1–3 and
discussed below.
3.1. Studies with Diets Containing Vitamin C
Many early studies with guinea pigs did not examine the effect of pure vitamin C. Instead,
“vitamin-C-deficient groups” were fed diets that contained only small amounts of vitamin C, whereas
the “vitamin C group” was administered oranges or other foods that contained high levels of vitamin C.
The findings of studies on guinea pigs with tuberculosis and other bacterial infections are shown in
Table 1.
Assuming that vitamin C containing foods do not influence infections, by pure chance only,
one positive result at the level of p < 0.01 would be expected for a group of 100 studies. However,
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
5 of 28
20 of the reported 28 studies found significant benefits from feeding diets rich in vitamin C (Table 1).
Although these findings are consistent with the notion that low vitamin C intake may increase the
susceptibility to and the severity of infections, other substances in fruit and vegetables might also
contribute to this effect, thus confounding the differences between the study groups.
As one example of Table 1 studies, McConkey (1936) reported that the administration of
tuberculous sputum to 16 guinea pigs that were vitamin C deficient led to intestinal tuberculosis
to 15 of them, but none of the five guinea pigs that were administered tomato juice as a source of
vitamin C suffered from intestinal tuberculosis [57] (pp. 507–508).

See Supplementary file 1 of this review for the list of the studies. p(1-tail) is used in this table. a Bacterial infections
included pneumococcus, group C streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Salmonella typhimurium.
3.2. Studies with Pure Vitamin C
Table 2 summarizes the animal studies in which pure vitamin C was administered to the
“vitamin C” group. Overall, 148 animal studies had been published by 2005.
Out of the 148 studies, over half found a significant benefit, p < 0.01, for at least one infectious
disease outcome. Furthermore, over a third of the studies found a benefit at the level of p < 0.001 [1].
Of the 100 studies with mammals, 58 found a significant benefit, p < 0.01, from vitamin C on some
infectious disease outcome.
A benefit of vitamin C against infections was found in all animal groups. Although rats and mice
synthesize vitamin C in their bodies, half or more of the studies with these species found significant
benefits of additional vitamin C. This implies that rats and mice do not necessarily synthesize sufficient
amounts of vitamin C to reach optimal levels that prevent or curtail infections. In addition to mammals,
vitamin C protected against infections in several studies with birds and fishes.
Vitamin C was found to be beneficial against various groups of infectious agents including
bacteria, viruses, Candida albicans, and protozoa (Table 2). Over half (n = 97) of all the studies evaluated
the effect of vitamin C on bacterial infections or bacterial toxins, and 55 out of those studies found
significant benefits of vitamin C (p < 0.01). Studies in which animals were administered diphtheria
toxin, tetanus toxin, or endotoxin are also relevant, because these toxins are essential components in
the pathogenesis of the bacterial infections. Over half of the studies on viruses, Candida albicans and
protozoa also reported significant benefits (p < 0.01).
Table 3 shows the distribution of infections in studies that reported decreases in mortality caused
by infections (p < 0.001). It is apparent that vitamin C reduced mortality in all etiological groups.
As one example of the studies in Tables 2 and 3, Dey (1966) reported that five rats administered
twice the minimal lethal dose of tetanus toxin all died, whereas 25 rats administered vitamin C either
before or after the same dose of toxin all lived [58].
In addition to the animal studies yielding quantitative data on the effect of vitamin C on infections
in Tables 1–3, a few studies reported interesting findings of vitamin C effects against infections in
studies without control groups [1] (p. 9). For example, two case-series suggested therapeutic benefit of
vitamin C on dogs afflicted by the canine distemper virus. Belfield (1967) described a series of 10 dogs
that appeared to benefit from 1–2 g/day of intravenous vitamin C over three days [59]. Leveque (1969)
noted that usually only 5%–10% of dogs recovered from canine distemper with signs of central nervous

system (CNS) disturbance. He became interested in Belfield’s report and in a series of 16 dogs showing
CNS disturbance that were treated with vitamin C, the proportion of dogs that recovered was 44%
(95% CI: 20%–70%; based on 7/16) [60].

Table 3 is restricted to mortality as the outcome, and to studies in which the effect of vitamin C on mortality was
statistically significant. See Supplementary file 1 of this review for a list of the studies in which vitamin C decreased
mortality by p ≤ 0.025 (1-tail). In comparison, Table 2 includes studies with all infectious disease outcomes, such as
incidence without the animals dying, and various forms of severity of infectious diseases. a Bacterial infections
included pneumococcus and β-hemolytic streptococci; b Bacterial toxins included diphtheria toxin, tetanus toxin,
endotoxin, and a set of clostridial toxins; c Protozoa infections include Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania donovani,
Toxoplasma gondii, and Trypanosoma brucei.
3.3. Implications of the Animal Studies
Many of the studies on vitamin C and infections summarized in Table 2 are old. However, it is
unlikely that administering a specified dose of pure vitamin C and evaluating clinical outcomes of
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
7 of 28
infections, such as mortality, will have changed meaningfully since those early days. Furthermore,
60 studies were published in the 1990s or later, and half of these later reports also found significant
benefits of vitamin C on at least one infectious disease outcome.
The studies on guinea pigs are most interesting since that species is dependent on dietary
vitamin C as are humans. Infections in guinea pigs against which vitamin C was significantly beneficial
included Mycobacterium tuberculosis, β-hemolytic streptococci, Fusobacterium necrophorum, diphtheria
toxin, Entamoeba histolytica, Trypanosoma brucei, and Candica albicans [1].
Some of the 148 studies in Table 2 were small and did not have sufficient statistical power to test
whether vitamin C and control groups might differ. However, this problem cannot explain the large
number of reported significant benefits. In contrast, inclusion of studies with a low statistical power
biases the findings towards the opposite direction, leading to false negative findings.
Mortality and severity of infections in animals are definitive outcomes. In this respect, the animal
studies with actual infections are much more relevant to humans than studies on laboratory
determinations of the human immune system.
Given the universal nature of the effect of vitamin C against infections in diverse animal species
as seen in Table 2, it seems obvious that vitamin C also has influences on infections in humans. It seems
unlikely that human beings qualitatively differ from all of the animal species that have been used in
the experiments listed in Table 2. Nevertheless, it is not clear to what degree the animal studies can be
extrapolated to human subjects.
The fundamental question in human beings is not whether vitamin C affects the susceptibility to
and severity of infections. Instead, the relevant questions are the following: What are the population
groups who might benefit from higher vitamin C intakes? What is the dose-dependency relation
between intake and the effects on infections? How does the optimal level of intake differ between
healthy people and patients with infections?
4. The Common Cold
The term “the common cold” does not refer to any precisely defined disease, yet the set of
symptoms that is called “the common cold” is personally familiar to practically everybody [61].
Typically the symptoms consist of nasal discharge, sore throat, cough, with or without fever. Young
children typically have half a dozen colds per year, and the incidence decreases with age so that elderly
people have colds about once per year [62]. The common cold is the leading cause of acute morbidity
and of visits to a physician in high-income countries, and a major cause of absenteeism from work and
school. The economic burden of the common cold is comparable to that of hypertension or stroke [63].
The most relevant definition of the common cold is based on the symptoms; thus the “common
cold” does not always entail a viral etiology. Although the majority of common cold episodes are
caused by respiratory viruses, similar symptoms are also caused by certain bacterial infections and
by some non-infectious causes such as allergic and mechanical irritation. The cough and sore throat
after running a marathon does not necessarily imply a viral etiology, although some researchers have
assumed so. It is still reasonable to use the term the “common cold” in such a context on the grounds
of the symptom-based definition.
4.1. Vitamin C and the Common Cold
Interest in the effects of vitamin C on the common cold originated soon after purified vitamin C
became available. The first controlled trials on vitamin C were carried out as early as the 1940s.
For example, in the 1950s, a British study examined the clinical effects of vitamin C deprivation, and
reported that “the geometric mean duration of colds was 6.4 days in vitamin C-deprived subjects and
3.3 days in non-deprived subjects”, and the authors concluded that the absence of vitamin C tended to
cause colds to last longer [12].

Figure 1 shows the number of participants in placebo-controlled studies in which ≥1 g/day of
vitamin C was administered. It also illustrates the main time points of the history of vitamin C and the
common cold.
In 1970, Linus Pauling, a Nobel laureate in chemistry and also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, wrote a
book on vitamin C and the common cold [64]. He also published two meta-analyses, which were among
the earliest meta-analyses in medicine [65,66]. Pauling identified four placebo-controlled studies from
which he calculated that there was strong evidence that vitamin C decreased the “integrated morbidity”
of colds (p = 0.00002 [65]). By integrated morbidity, Pauling meant the total burden of the common cold:
the combination of the incidence and duration of colds. In his analysis, Pauling put the greatest weight
on the study by Ritzel (1961), which was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with double-blinded
placebo control and the subjects were schoolchildren in a skiing camp in the Swiss Alps [67]. Ritzel’s
study was methodologically the best of the four and used the highest dose of vitamin C, 1 g/day, and
therefore Pauling concluded that gram doses of vitamin C would be beneficial against colds [64–66].

3.3 days in non‐deprived subjects”, and the authors concluded that the absence of vitamin C tended 
to cause colds to last longer [12]. 
Figure 1 shows the number of participants in placebo‐controlled studies in which ≥1 g/day of 
vitamin C was administered. It also illustrates the main time points of the history of vitamin C and 
the common cold.

and Chalker (2013) [68,69]. See Supplementary file 1 of this review for the list of the studies. RCT, 
randomized controlled trial. 
The activity of Pauling, in turn, led to a great upsurge in interest in vitamin C among lay people 
and also in academic circles in the early 1970s. From 1972 to 1979, in that eight‐year period, 29 
placebo‐controlled studies were published, which amounted to a total of 8409 participants (Figure 1) 
[68,69]. Thus, the mean number of participants per study was 290. 
In the interval from 1972 to 1975, five placebo‐controlled trials were published that used ≥2 g/day 
of vitamin C. Those five studies were published after Pauling’s book and therefore they formally 
tested Pauling’s hypothesis. A meta‐analysis by Hemilä (1996) showed that there was very strong 
evidence from the five studies that colds were shorter or less severe in the vitamin C groups (p = 10−5), 
and therefore those studies corroborated Pauling’s hypothesis that vitamin C was indeed effective 
against colds [70].  
After the mid‐1970s, however, interest in the topic plummeted so much so that during the 30‐
year period from 1985 to 2014, only 11 placebo‐controlled trials comprising just 538 participants in 
total were published, with a mean of 49 participants per study (Figure 1). Thus, the number of studies

(Figure 1) [68,69]. Thus, the mean number of participants per study was 290.
In the interval from 1972 to 1975, five placebo-controlled trials were published that used ≥2 g/day
of vitamin C. Those five studies were published after Pauling’s book and therefore they formally tested
Pauling’s hypothesis. A meta-analysis by Hemilä (1996) showed that there was very strong evidence
from the five studies that colds were shorter or less severe in the vitamin C groups (p = 10−5), and
therefore those studies corroborated Pauling’s hypothesis that vitamin C was indeed effective against
colds [70].
After the mid-1970s, however, interest in the topic plummeted so much so that during the 30-year
period from 1985 to 2014, only 11 placebo-controlled trials comprising just 538 participants in total
were published, with a mean of 49 participants per study (Figure 1). Thus, the number of studies
published after 1985 is much lower than during the 1970s. In addition, the few recent studies are much
smaller than the trials published in the 1970s. Therefore, the great majority of the data on vitamin C
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339

and the common cold that are currently available originated within the decade after the publication of
Pauling’s book.
This sudden lack of interest after the middle of the 1970s can be explained by three papers
published in the same year by Chalmers (1975), Karlowski et al. (1975), and Dykes and Meier
(1975) [71–73] (Figure 1). Few trials were started after 1975, which indicates the great impact of these
three papers. First, the findings of the placebo controlled studies will be summarized, and then
difficulties in the interpretation of common cold studies will be considered, and finally problems in the
three papers that were published in 1975 will be discussed.
4.2. Vitamin C Does Not Decrease the Average Incidence of Colds in the General Community
Table 4 summarizes the findings of the studies on vitamin C and the common cold in the Cochrane
review by Hemilä and Chalker (2013) [68,69]. Regularly administered vitamin C has not decreased the
average number of colds among the general population (Table 4). Another meta-analysis combined
the findings of the six largest trials that had used ≥1 g/day of vitamin C and calculated that there was
no difference in the vitamin and placebo groups with RR = 0.99 (95% CI 0.93, 1.04) [74,75].

This table summarizes the main findings of the Cochrane review by Hemilä and Chalker (2013) [68,69]. a Regular
supplementation of vitamin C means that vitamin C was administered each day over the whole study period.
Duration and severity of colds indicates the effects on colds that occurred during the study; b Incidence indicates
here the number of participants who had ≥1 cold during the study; c The unit in this comparison is the standard
deviation. Thus −0.12 means that symptoms were decreased by 0.12 times the SD of the outcome.
Thus, there is no justification for “ordinary people” to take vitamin C regularly in order to prevent
colds. However, this conclusion does not mean that regular vitamin C supplementation is ineffective
for all people. There is strong evidence that vitamin C decreases the incidence of colds under special
conditions and/or among certain population groups.
4.3. Vitamin C May Decrease Common Cold Incidence in Special Conditions
Vitamin C halved the incidence of colds in five RCTs during which the participants were under
heavy short-term physical activity (Table 4) [68,76]. Three of the studies used marathon runners in
South Africa as subjects, whereas one study used Canadian military personnel on winter exercise, and
the fifth study was on schoolchildren in a skiing camp in the Swiss Alps, i.e., the Ritzel (1961) trial [67].
Thus, three studies were conducted under conditions of a hot environment and profound physical
stress and the other two were carried out under cold environments and physical stress (see Section 2.4).
Another group in which vitamin C has prevented colds is British men [74,75,77]. Four trials found
that vitamin C decreased the incidence of colds by 30%, and in another set of four trials, the proportion
of men who had recurrent common cold infections during the study decreased by a mean of 46%.
All these studies were carried out in the 1970s or earlier, and according to surveys, the intake of
vitamin C in the United Kingdom was low when the studies were carried out, 0.03 to 0.06 g/day,
and three of the U.K. trials specifically estimated that the dietary vitamin C intake was between 0.015
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
10 of 28
to 0.05 g/day [74]. In particular, Baird (1979) administered only 0.08 g/day of vitamin C yet they
observed 37% lower incidence of colds in the vitamin C group, indicating that it was the “marginal
deficiency” and not a high dose that explained the benefit [77,78].
In addition, the levels of vitamin C are usually lower in men than in women, which may explain
the benefit for British males, in comparison to no apparent effect in British females. Evidently, the
dietary vitamin C intake in the United Kingdom has increased since the 1970s, and therefore these
studies do not indicate that vitamin C supplementation would necessarily influence colds in ordinary
British men nowadays. However, if low dietary vitamin C intake increases the risk of respiratory
infections, then that may be currently relevant in other contexts, since there are still many population
groups that have low intakes of vitamin C. A recent small study in the USA by Johnston (2014) was
restricted to 28 males with marginally low vitamin C levels, mean 30 µmol/L, and found a decrease in
common cold incidence, RR = 0.55 (95% CI: 0.33–0.94; p = 0.04) [79], which may also be explained by
the low vitamin C levels.
4.4. Vitamin C Might Protect against the Common Cold in a Restricted Subgroup of the General Community
Although vitamin C has not influenced the average common cold incidence in the general
community trials (Table 4), some of them found that there was a subgroup of people who had obtained
benefits from vitamin C. In a Canadian trial, Anderson (1972) [80] reported that in the vitamin C group
there were 10 percentage points more participants with no “days confined to house” because of colds
(57% vs. 47%; p = 0.01, [1] (p. 44)). Thus, one in 10 benefited from vitamin C in this outcome. In a
trial with Navajo schoolchildren, Coulehan (1974) [81] found that in the vitamin C group there were
16 percentage points more children who were “never ill on active surveillance by a medically trained
clerk or the school nurse” (44% vs. 29%; p < 0.001; [1] (p. 44)). A more recent study in the UK by van
Straten (2002) reported that vitamin C decreased the number of participants who had recurrent colds
by 17 percentage points [82] (19% vs. 2%; p < 0.001, [1] (p. 47)). Thus, the statistical evidence of benefit
for a restricted subgroup in these three trials is strong.
4.5. Vitamin C Shortens and Alleviates the Common Cold
The effect of vitamin C on the duration and severity of the common cold has been studied
in regular supplementation trials and in therapeutic trials. Regular supplementation means that
vitamin C was administered each day over the whole study period, and the outcome is the duration
and severity of colds that occurred during the study. Therapeutic vitamin C trial means that vitamin C
administration was started only after the first common cold symptoms had occurred and the duration
of colds were then recorded.
In regular supplementation studies, ≥0.2 g/day of vitamin C decreased the duration of colds by
9% (Table 4). When the dosage was ≥1 g/day of vitamin C, the mean duration of colds was shortened
by 8% in adults and by 18% in children. Vitamin C also significantly alleviated the severity of the colds.
Therapeutic studies have hitherto not shown consistent benefit from vitamin C. However,
therapeutic trials are more complex to conduct and interpret than regular supplementation trials. If the
timing of the initiation of supplementation or the duration of supplementation influences the extent
of the benefit, false negative findings may result from inappropriate study protocols. For example,
four therapeutic studies used only 2–3 days of 2–4 g/day vitamin C supplementation, whereas the
mean duration of colds in these studies was about a week. None of these studies detected any benefit
from vitamin C [68,83]. On the other hand, Anderson (1974) [84] found that 8 g/day on the first day
only reduced the duration of colds significantly (Figure 2). In addition, in a five-day therapeutic trial,
Anderson (1975) [85] reported a 25% reduction in “days spent indoors per subject” because of illness
(p = 0.048) in the vitamin C group (1 to 1.5 g/day) [1] (p. 48). Finally, none of the therapeutic studies
investigated children, although the effect of regular vitamin C has been greater in children (Table 4).
Thus, although the regular supplementation trials unambiguously show that vitamin C shortens
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
11 of 28
and alleviates the common cold, there is no consistent evidence that therapeutic supplementation
is effective.
4.6. Possible Differences in the Effects of Vitamin C between Subgroups
The regular supplementation study by Anderson (1972) is one of the largest that has been carried
out [80]. They found that the proportion of participants who were not confined to the house decreased
by 10 percentage points in the vitamin C group. In addition, they found that per episode the days
confined to the house was 21% shorter in the vitamin C group. Together these combine to a 30%
reduction in the days confined to the house per person (p = 0.001). Such a large effect gives statistical
power for subgroup comparisons.
Anderson (1972) reported that vitamin C decreased total days confined to house by 46% in
participants who had contact with young children, but just by 17% in participants who did not have
contact with young children (Table 5). Anderson (1972) also reported that vitamin C decreased total
days confined to house by 43% in participants who usually had two or more colds per winter, but just
by 13% in participants who usually had zero to one cold per winter (Table 5).
In a study with adolescent competitive swimmers, Constantini (2011) found a significant difference
between males and females in the effect of vitamin C, whereby the vitamin halved the duration and
severity of colds in males but had no effect on females [86]. In a study with British students, Baird (1979)
also found a significant difference between males and females, but the outcome was the incidence of
colds (Table 5).
Carr (1981) found that vitamin C had a beneficial effect on the duration of colds for twins living
separately, but not for twins living together [87]. This subgroup difference might be explained by
swapping of tablets by twins living together, which was not possible for twins living separately.
The significant within-trial differences in the effect of vitamin C on the common cold indicate
that there is no universal effect of vitamin C valid over the whole population. Instead, the size of the
vitamin C effect seems to depend on various characteristics of people (see Section 2.8).

4.7. Dose Dependency of Vitamin C Supplementation Effect
An earlier meta-analysis of dose-dependency calculated that on average 1 g/day of vitamin C
shortened the duration of colds in adults on average by 6% and in children by 17%; and ≥2 g/day
vitamin C shortened the duration of colds in adults by 21% and in children by 26% [83]. Thus, higher
doses were associated with greater effects. In addition, children weigh less than adults and the greater
effects in children may be explained by a greater dose per weight. Nevertheless, such a comparison
suffers from numerous simultaneous differences between the trials. The most valid examination of
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
12 of 28
dose–response is within a single study so that the virus distribution is similar in each trial arm and the
outcome definition is identical.
Coulehan (1974) [81] administered 1 g/day to children and observed a 12% reduction in common
cold duration, and in parallel they administered 2 g/day to other children and observed a 29%
reduction in cold duration. Although the point estimates suggest a dose–response, the study was small
and the 95% CIs overlap widely [68,83].
In a 2 × 2 design, Karlowski (1975) [72] randomized participants to 3 g/day regular vitamin C
and to 3 g/day vitamin C treatment for five days when the participant caught a cold. Thus, one study
arm was administered placebo, the second was administered regular vitamin C, the third therapeutic,
and the fourth arm was administered regular + therapeutic vitamin C (i.e., 6 g/day). The four arms
of the Karlowski trial are shown in Figure 2A. The 95% CIs show the comparisons with the placebo
group. The test for trend for a linear regression model gives p = 0.018.
Anderson (1974) [84] randomized participants to a placebo and two vitamin C treatment arms
which were administered vitamin C only on the first day of the cold. One treatment arm (arm #7) was
given 4 g/day of, and another (arm #8) was given 8 g/day. These arms are compared with the placebo
arm #4 in Figure 2B. The 95% CIs show the comparisons with the placebo group. The test for trend in a
linear regression model gives p = 0.013.
Finally, some case reports have proposed that vitamin C doses should be over 15 g/day for the
best treatment of colds [88,89]. Thus, it is possible that the doses used in most of the therapeutic
studies, up to just 6–8 g/day, have not been sufficiently high to properly test the effects of vitamin C
that might be achievable.

dose–response is within a single study so that the virus distribution is similar in each trial arm and 
the outcome definition is identical. 
Coulehan (1974) [81] administered 1 g/day to children and observed a 12% reduction in common 
cold duration, and in parallel they administered 2 g/day to other children and observed a 29% 
reduction in cold duration. Although the point estimates suggest a dose–response, the study was 
small and the 95% CIs overlap widely [68,83]. 
In a 2 × 2 design, Karlowski (1975) [72] randomized participants to 3 g/day regular vitamin C 
and to 3 g/day vitamin C treatment for five days when the participant caught a cold. Thus, one study 
arm was administered placebo, the second was administered regular vitamin C, the third therapeutic, 
and the fourth arm was administered regular + therapeutic vitamin C (i.e., 6 g/day). The four arms of 
the Karlowski trial are shown in Figure 2A. The 95% CIs show the comparisons with the placebo 
group. The test for trend for a linear regression model gives p = 0.018. 
Anderson (1974) [84] randomized participants to a placebo and two vitamin C treatment arms 
which were administered vitamin C only on the first day of the cold. One treatment arm (arm #7) was 
given 4 g/day of, and another (arm #8) was given 8 g/day. These arms are compared with the placebo 
arm #4 in Figure 2B. The 95% CIs show the comparisons with the placebo group. The test for trend in 
a linear regression model gives p = 0.013. 
Finally, some case reports have proposed that vitamin C doses should be over 15 g/day for the 
best treatment of colds [88,89]. Thus, it is possible that the doses used in most of the therapeutic 
studies, up to just 6–8 g/day, have not been sufficiently high to properly test the effects of vitamin C 
that might be achievable.

calculated p = 0.040 for the linear trend [83]; (B) Dose–response relationship in the Anderson (1974)

the first day of the common cold. The 95% CIs are shown for the comparison against the placebo arm.

4.8. Vitamin C and Complications of the Common Cold
Given the strong evidence that regularly administered vitamin C shortens and alleviates common
cold symptoms, it seems plausible that vitamin C might also alleviate complications of the common
cold. One frequent complication is the exacerbation of asthma [90].
A systematic review identified three studies that provided information on the potential pulmonary
effects of vitamin C in sufferers of common cold–induced asthma [91].
A trial conducted in
Nigeria studied asthmatic patients whose asthma exacerbations resulted from respiratory infections.
A vitamin C dose of 1 g/day decreased the occurrence of severe and moderate asthma attacks by
89% [92]. Another study on patients who had infection-related asthma reported that 5 g/day vitamin
C decreased the prevalence of bronchial hypersensitivity to histamine by 52 percentage points [93].
A third study found that the administration of a single dose of 1 g vitamin C to non-asthmatic common
cold patients decreased bronchial sensitivity in a histamine challenge test [94].
It has also been proposed that vitamin C might prevent sinusitis and otitis media [95,96], but to
our knowledge there are no data from controlled studies.
A further complication of viral respiratory infections is pneumonia; this is discussed in the section
on pneumonia.
5. Problems in the Interpretation: Non-Comparability of the Vitamin C and Common Cold Trials
5.1. Vitamin C Doses in Vitamin C and Control Groups
One great problem in the interpretation of vitamin C trials arises from the fundamental difference
between vitamin C and ordinary drugs such as antibiotics. In a trial of an ordinary drug, the control
group is not given the drug, which simplifies the interpretation of the findings. In contrast, it is
impossible to select control subjects who have zero vitamin C intake and no vitamin C in their system.
Thus, all vitamin C trials de facto compare two different vitamin C levels. The lower dose is obtained
from the diet, and it has varied considerably among the controlled studies. In addition, the vitamin
C supplement doses given to the vitamin C groups have also varied extensively. Finally, the placebo
group in some trials was also given extra vitamin C, which further confuses the comparisons. Therefore,
the comparison of different vitamin C studies and the generalization of their findings is complicated.
As an illustration of these problems, Table 6 shows examples of the variations in vitamin C doses that
were used in the common cold trials.
There are 10- to 30-fold differences in the vitamin C intake in the diet of the control groups of
the Baird (1979) [78], the Glazebrook (1942) [97], and the Sabiston (1974) [98] trials compared with
the Peters (1993) [99] trial, yet all of them are labeled “control groups” of vitamin C trials (Table 6).
Evidently, we should not expect similar effects of supplemental vitamin C in such dissimilar studies.
Usually the dietary intake of vitamin C is not estimated and therefore cannot be taken into account
when comparing studies.
Vitamin C was administered to the placebo group in some studies. For example, Carr (1981) [87]
administered 0.07 g/day and some other studies administered 0.01 to 0.05 g/day to the control subjects.
This was done to refute the notion that any possible effects of high doses were due to the treatment
of marginal deficiencies. Such reasoning does not seem sound, since there are population groups
for which ordinary dietary vitamin C intake is particularly low and it would be important to know
whether vitamin C supplementation might be beneficial for them. Thus, marginal vitamin C deficiency
is also an important issue. The administration of vitamin C to the control group biases the possible
effects of vitamin C supplementation downwards.
Finally, there are up to a 240-fold difference between the lowest and highest vitamin C
supplementary dose used in the common cold trials, yet the dosage is often ignored. For example,
in his influential review (see Figure 1), Chalmers (1975) [71] presented data from the following studies
in the same table: Karlowski (1975) study administered up to 6 g/day of vitamin C to their subjects [72],
whereas the Cowan (1942) study administered only 0.025 g/day as the lowest dose [100]. Chalmers
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
14 of 28
(1975) did not list the vitamin C dosages in his table and therefore his readers were unable to consider
whether the comparison of such different studies was reasonable or not. Still, Chalmers’ review has
been widely cited as evidence that vitamin C is not effective against colds [1] (pp. 36–38).
Finally, combinations of the above variations lead to paradoxes. The “vitamin C group” of the
Baird (1979) study received about 0.05 g/day of vitamin C from food and 0.08 g/day from supplements,
which amounted to 0.13 g/day of total vitamin C [78]. In contrast, the “placebo group” in the study
by Peters (1994) received about four times as much, 0.5 g/day, of vitamin C from their usual diet [99].
Furthermore, Baird (1979) administered 0.08 g/day of vitamin C to their vitamin C group [78], whereas
Carr (1981) administered 0.07 g/day vitamin C to their placebo group [87]. Thus, the dosages of
vitamin C were essentially the same, but the groups were on the opposite sides in the evaluation of
vitamin C effects.
High dietary vitamin C intake, and vitamin C supplementation of the placebo group, cannot lead
to false positive findings about the efficacy of vitamin C against colds. In contrast, they can lead to
false negative findings or estimates biased towards the null effect.

to 0.05 g/day of vitamin C to the placebo group, but they are not listed here; b In the 1970s, the average vitamin C
intake in the USA was approximately 0.1 g/day. The participants of the Karlowski (1975) study were employees of
the National Institutes of Health and therefore their mean dietary intake of vitamin C probably was higher than the
national average, but intake of vitamin C was not estimated.
5.2. Non-Compliance of Participants
Carr (1981) studied twins, some of whom lived together, whereas others lived apart [87]. Vitamin C
had a significant effect on the duration and severity of colds in twins living apart, but no effect in twins
living together (Table 5). Furthermore, the duration of colds among twins living together (5.4 days
in vitamin C and placebo groups) was in the middle of the duration of colds among the vitamin C
group (4.9 days) and placebo group (7.5 days) of twins living apart. An evident explanation for such
a difference between twins living together and twins living apart, is that twins who lived together
exchanged their tablets to some extent, whereas the twins who lived apart could not do so. Two studies
on children found an increase in vitamin C levels in the plasma of boys and in the urine of boys of the
placebo (sic) groups [81,101], which indicates tablet swapping among the children on vitamin C and
placebo. Thus, non-compliance may have confounded the results and the true effects of vitamin C
might be greater than those reported.

5.3. Implications of the Common Cold Studies
Given the great variations in the vitamin C dosage levels in the vitamin C and control groups, and
the apparent problem of non-compliance in some studies, it is obvious that the comparison of different
“vitamin C trials” can be complicated. The generalization of the findings of any particular trial is
limited irrespective of its methodological quality and statistical power. However, the large variations
in vitamin C levels in the vitamin C and control groups, and the non-compliance in some studies,
both predispose against a false positive differences between the study groups. In contrast, they make
it more difficult to detect true differences, and therefore the findings on common cold duration and
severity shown in Table 4 may be biased downwards and might camouflage even stronger true effects.
6. Evaporation of Interest in Vitamin C and the Common Cold after 1975
Given the strong evidence from studies published before 1970 that vitamin C has beneficial effects
against the common cold [65], and from the ≥2 g/day vitamin C studies published between 1972 and
1975 [70], it is puzzling that the interest in vitamin C and the common cold collapsed after 1975 so that
few small trials on vitamin C and the common cold have been conducted thereafter (Figure 1).
This sudden loss of interest can be explained by the publication of the three highly important
papers in 1975 (Figure 1). These papers are particularly influential because of their authors and the
publication forums. Two of the papers were published in JAMA [72,73], and the third paper was
published in the American Journal of Medicine [71]. Both of these journals are highly influential medical
journals with extensive circulations. Two of the papers were authored by Thomas Chalmers [71,72],
who was a highly respected and influential pioneer of RCTs [1,102,103], and the third paper was
authored by Paul Meier [73], who was a highly influential statistician, e.g., one of the authors of the
widely used Kaplan–Meier method [1,104,105].
Karlowski, Chalmers, et al. (1975) [72] published the results of a RCT in JAMA, in which 6 g/day
of vitamin C significantly shortened the duration of colds (Figure 2A). However, these authors claimed
that the observed benefit was not caused by the physiological effects of vitamin C, but by the placebo
effect. However, the “placebo-effect explanation” was shown afterwards to be erroneous. For example,
Karlowski et al. had excluded 42% of common cold episodes from the subgroup analysis that was the
basis for their conclusion, without giving any explanation of why so many participants were excluded.
The numerous problems of the placebo explanation are detailed in a critique by Hemilä [1,106,107].
Chalmers wrote a response [108], but did not answer the specific issues raised [109].
In the same year (1975), Chalmers published a review of the vitamin C and common cold studies.
He pooled the results of seven studies and calculated that vitamin C would shorten colds only by
0.11 (SE 0.24) days [71]. Such a small difference has no clinical importance and the SE indicates that it
is simply explained by random variation. However, there were errors in the extraction of data, studies
that used very low doses of vitamin C (down to 0.025 g/day) were included, and there were errors
in the calculations [1,110]. Pauling had proposed that vitamin C doses should be ≥1 g/day. When
Hemilä and Herman (1995) included only those studies that had used ≥1 g/day of vitamin C and
extracted data correctly, they calculated that colds were 0.93 (SE 0.22) days shorter, which is over eight
times that calculated by Chalmers, and highly significant (p = 0.01) [110].
The third paper was a review published in JAMA by Michael Dykes and Paul Meier (1975). They
analyzed selected studies and concluded that there was no convincing evidence that vitamin C has
effects on colds [73]. However, they did not calculate the estimates of the effect nor any p-values,
and many comments in their analysis were misleading. Pauling wrote a manuscript in which he
commented upon the review by Dykes and Meier and submitted it to JAMA. Pauling stated afterwards
that his paper was rejected even after he twice made revisions to meet the suggestions of the referees
and the manuscript was finally published in a minor journal [111,112]. The rejection of Pauling’s
papers was strange since the readers of JAMA were effectively prevented from seeing the other side
of an important controversy. There were also other problems that were not pointed out by Pauling;
see [1,70].

Although the three papers have serious biases, they have been used singly or in the combinations
of two as references in nutritional recommendations, in medical textbooks, in texts on infectious
diseases and on nutrition, when the authors claimed that vitamin C had been shown to be ineffective
for colds [1] (pp. 21–23, 36–38, 42–45). The American Medical Association, for example, officially
stated that “One of the most widely misused vitamins is ascorbic acid. There is no reliable evidence
that large doses of ascorbic acid prevent colds or shorten their duration” [113], a statement that was
based entirely on Chalmers’s 1975 review.
These three papers are the most manifest explanation for the collapse in the interest in vitamin C
and the common cold after 1975, despite the strong evidence that had emerged by that time that
≥2 g/day vitamin C shortens and alleviates colds [70].
7. Pneumonia
Pneumonia is the most common severe infection, which is usually caused by bacteria and viruses.
As recounted at the beginning of this review, the association between frank vitamin C deficiency
and pneumonia was noted by Alfred Hess and other early authors, when the chemical identity of
vitamin C was not yet known. Vitamin C was purified in the early 1930s and soon thereafter a
few German and U.S. physicians proposed that vitamin C might be beneficial in the treatment of
pneumonia. For example, Gander and Niederberger (1936) concluded from a series of 15 cases that
“the general condition is always favorably influenced (by vitamin C) to a noticeable extent, as is the
convalescence, which proceeds better and more quickly than in cases of pneumonia, which are not
treated with vitamin C” [114] and other German physicians also claimed benefits of vitamin C [115,116].
Translations of these papers are available [9]. Case reports from the USA also suggested that vitamin C
was beneficial against pneumonia [117–119].
A Cochrane review on vitamin C and pneumonia identified three controlled trials that reported
the number of pneumonia cases in participants who were administered vitamin C and two therapeutic
trials in which pneumonia patients were given vitamin C [27,28].
7.1. Vitamin C and the Incidence of Pneumonia
Table 7 shows the findings of the three vitamin C and pneumonia trials. Each of them found a
≥80% lower incidence of pneumonia for their vitamin C group [27,28,120].
Glazebrook (1942) studied male students (15–20 years) in a boarding school in Scotland during
World War II [97]. No formal placebo was used; however, 0.05 to 0.3 g/day of vitamin C was added to
the morning cocoa and to an evening glass of milk in the kitchen. Thus, the placebo effect does not
seem to be a relevant concern in the dining hall. The ordinary diet of the schoolboys contained only
0.015 g/day vitamin C so that their intake was particularly low.
Kimbarowski (1967) studied the effect of 0.3 g/day of vitamin C on military recruits who had been
hospitalized because of influenza type-A in the former Soviet Union [121]. Thus, these pneumonia
cases were complications of the viral respiratory infection. Vitamin C also shortened the mean stay in
hospital for pneumonia treatment (9 vs. 12 days).
The latest of the three pneumonia prevention trials was carried out during a two-month recruit
training period with U.S. Marine recruits by Pitt (1979) [122]. The dose of vitamin C was 2 g/day. This
was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, whereas the two earlier studies were not.
The findings of the three studies are consistent with the notion that the level of vitamin C intake
may influence the risk of pneumonia. However, all the three studies were carried out using special
participants under particular conditions, and their findings cannot be generalized to the ordinary
current Western population. Dietary vitamin C intake was particularly low in the oldest study, and
may also have been low in the second study. Thus, the benefit of vitamin C supplementation may be
explained by the correction of marginal deficiency in these two older studies. However, in the study
by Pitt (1979), the baseline plasma level of vitamin C, 57 µmol/L, corresponds to the dietary vitamin C
intake of about 0.1 g/day [11]. Furthermore, although the dose of 2 g/day was high, the plasma
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
17 of 28
level of vitamin C increased only by 36% for the vitamin C group. This also indicates that the basal
dietary intake vitamin C was high. Thus, treating marginal vitamin C deficiency is not a reasonable
explanation for that latest study.
It is also worth noting that two of these trials used military recruits, and the third used young
males who were accommodated in a boarding school [123]. Therefore, the exposure to viruses and
bacteria causing pneumonia may have been much higher compared to children and young adults
living at home. In each of the three trials, the incidence of pneumonia in the control group was very
high when compared with the incidence in the ordinary population [124,125]. A high incidence of
pneumonia has been reported in military recruits [126], but the incidence of pneumonia has been even
higher in some child populations of the developing countries [127] (Table 7).
It seems reasonable to consider that these three studies observed a true effect of vitamin C against
pneumonia in their specific circumstances. However, these findings should not be extrapolated to
different circumstances. It would seem worthwhile to examine the effect of vitamin C in population
groups that have a high incidence of pneumonia concomitantly with a low intake of vitamin C [27,41].

7.2. Vitamin C in the Treatment of Pneumonia
Two studies have reported on the therapeutic effect of vitamin C for pneumonia patients [27,28].
Hunt (1994) carried out a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial with elderly people
in the UK (mean age 81 years), who were hospitalized because of acute bronchitis or pneumonia [26].
The mean plasma vitamin C level at baseline was 23 µmol/L and one third of the patients had a
vitamin C level of just ≤11 µmol/L. There was a significant difference in the effect of 0.2 g/day of
vitamin C between patients who were more ill and those who were less ill when admitted to the
hospital. Vitamin C reduced the respiratory symptom score in the more ill patients but not in their less
ill counterparts. There were also six deaths during the study, all among the more ill participants: five
in the placebo group, but only one in the vitamin C group.
Mochalkin (1970) examined the effect of vitamin C on pneumonia patients in the former Soviet
Union [25]. Although a placebo was not administered to the control group, two different doses of
vitamin C were used and the observed difference between the low and high dosage cannot be explained
by the placebo effect. The high-dose regime administered on average twice the quantity of vitamin C
of the low dose, but both of them were related to the dosage of antibiotics so that the low dose vitamin
C ranged from 0.25 to 0.8 g/day, and the high dose ranged from 0.5 to 1.6 g/day. The duration of
hospital stay in the control group (no vitamin C supplementation) was 23.7 days. In the low dose
vitamin C group the hospital stay was 19% shorter and in the high dose vitamin C group it was 36%
shorter. A benefit was also reported on the normalization of chest X-ray, temperature, and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate.
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
18 of 28
Although both of these therapeutic studies give support to the old case reports stating that
vitamin C is beneficial for pneumonia patients, the findings cannot be directly generalized to typical
pneumonia patients of Western countries.
8. Tetanus
Tetanus is a disease caused by the toxin of Clostridium tetani, which may contaminate wounds.
An early case report claimed that vitamin C was beneficial against tetanus in an unvaccinated
six-year-old boy in the USA [128]. A Cochrane review identified one controlled trial in which the effect
of vitamin C on tetanus patients was examined [129,130].
Jahan (1984) studied the effect of 1 g/day of intravenous vitamin C on tetanus patients in
Bangladesh [131]. In children aged one to 12 years, there were no deaths in the vitamin C group,
whereas there were 23 deaths in the control group (p = 10−9) [1] (p. 17). In tetanus patients aged
13 to 30 years, there were 10 deaths in the vitamin C group compared with 19 deaths in the control
group (p = 0.03). The significant difference between the above-described age groups may be caused by
the difference in the body weights of the patients. In the young children the same dose of vitamin C
corresponds to a substantially higher dose per unit of weight. Although there were methodological
weaknesses in the trial, they are unlikely explanations for the dramatic difference in the younger
participants [129].
9. Other Infections
The effect of vitamin C supplementation on the common cold has been most extensively studied.
One important reason for extensive research on vitamin C and the common cold seems to be the wide
publicity given to it by Pauling [1,132]. Probably some researchers wanted to show that Pauling was
either right or wrong, whereas others just wanted to study a topic about which a Nobel Prize winner
had put his credibility on the line. Another reason for the large number of studies on the common
cold is that it is a non-severe ubiquitous infection, and it is very easy to find common cold patients in
schools and work places. It is much more difficult to study more serious infections.
The three infections discussed above, the common cold, pneumonia, and tetanus, were selected
on the basis that the effects of vitamin C have been evaluated in Cochrane reviews, which entails a
thorough literature search and a careful analysis of the identified trials. However, the selection of these
three infections does not imply that the effects of vitamin C are limited to them.
Table 2 indicates that vitamin C may have effects on various infections caused by viruses, bacteria,
Candida albicans and protozoa. Vitamin C might have similar effects in humans. However, it also
seems evident that the role of additional vitamin C depends on various factors such as the initial
dietary intake level, other nutritional status, the exposure level to pathogens, the level of exercise and
temperature stress, etc.
Three extensive searches of the older literature on vitamin C and infections have been published,
and they give an extensive list of references, but none of these publications gave a balanced discussion
of the findings [133–135]. A few studies on the possible effects of vitamin C on other infections are
outlined below, but this selection is not systematic.
Terezhalmy (1978) [136] used a double-blind placebo-controlled RCT and found that the duration
of pain caused by herpes labialis was shortened by 51%, from 3.5 to 1.3 days (p = 10−8), when patients
were administered 1 g/day of vitamin C together with bioflavonoids [1] (pp. 15–17). Furthermore,
when vitamin C treatment was initiated within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms, only six out of
26 patients (23%) developed herpes vesicles, whereas with later initiation of vitamin C, eight out of
12 patients (67%) developed vesicles (p = 0.003 in the test of interaction). Vitamin C was administered
with bioflavonoids, so the study was not specific to vitamin C, but there is no compelling evidence to
indicate that bioflavonoids affect infections.
Herpes zoster (reactivation of varicella zoster virus) can cause long lasting post-herpetic neuralgia
(PHN). Chen (2009) found that patients with PHN had significantly lower plasma vitamin C plasma
 Nutrients 2017, 9, 339
19 of 28
than healthy volunteers, and their RCT showed that vitamin C administration significantly decreased
the pain level of PHN [137]. A number of other reports have also suggested that vitamin C may be
effective against the pain caused by herpes zoster [138–142].
Patrone (1982) and Levy (1996) reported that vitamin C administration was beneficial to patients
who had recurrent infections, mainly of the skin [143,144]. Many of the patients had impaired
neutrophil functions and therefore the findings cannot be generalized to the ordinary population.
Galley (1997) reported that vitamin C increased the cardiac index in patients with septic
shock [145]. Pleiner (2002) reported that intravenous vitamin C administration preserved vascular
reactivity to acetylcholine in study participants who had been experimentally administered
Escherichia coli endotoxin [146].
It seems unlikely that the effects of vitamin C on herpetic pain, cardiac index and the vascular
system are mediated through effects on the immune system. Such effects are probably caused by other
mechanisms instead. The question of the possible benefits of vitamin C against infections is therefore
not just a question about the immune system effects of the vitamin, as was discussed earlier in this
review (see Section 2.7).
Some physicians used vitamin C for a large set of infectious disease patients and described their
experiences in case reports that are worth reading [89,147].
10. Observational Studies on Vitamin C and Infections
Cohort studies on vitamins are often unreliable because diet is strongly associated with numerous
lifestyle factors that cannot be fully adjusted for in statistical models. Therefore, there may always
remain an unknown level of residual confounding [148]. The main source of vitamin C in the diet
is fruit, and high dietary vitamin C intake essentially always means a high fruit intake [149]. Thus,
any substantial correlations between vitamin C intake and infections could also reflect some other
substances in fruit. Only two observational studies are commented upon in this section.
Merchant (2004) studied men whose ages ranged from 40 to 75 years in the USA and found no
association between their vitamin C intake and community-acquired pneumonia [124]. These males
were U.S. health professionals; thus they were of a population that has a great interest in factors
that affect health. The incidence of pneumonia was only three cases per 1000 person-years (Table 7).
The median vitamin C intake of the lowest quintile was 0.095 g/day and of the highest quintile it
was 1.1 g/day. In contrast, the overall median of the adult U.S. population is about 0.1 g/day, and
10% of the U.S. population has an intake level of less than 0.04 g/day [14]. Thus, Merchant and
colleagues’ cohort study indicates that increasing the vitamin C intake upwards from the median level
in the USA will not lead to any further decline in the already low pneumonia incidence among male
health professionals. However, the study is uninformative about whether decreasing vitamin C level
downwards from 0.1 g/day might increase pneumonia risk, or about whether vitamin C might have
effects in populations that have particularly high incidences of pneumonia (Table 7). Even though we
must be cautious about interpreting observational studies, it seems that biological differences, rather
than methodological differences, are most reasonable explanations for the divergence between the
findings in the Merchant et al. cohort study and the three controlled trials shown in Table 7.
A cohort analysis of Finnish male smokers that is part of the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene
Cancer prevention (ATBC) Study found a significant inverse association between dietary vitamin C
intake and tuberculosis risk in participants who were not administered vitamin E supplements [150,151].
The highest quartile had the median dietary vitamin C intake level of 0.15 g/day, whereas the lowest
quartile had an intake level of only 0.052 g/day. The adjusted risk of tuberculosis in the lowest vitamin
C intake quartile was 150% higher than that of the highest intake quartile. This is consistent with the
animal studies that found that low vitamin C intake increases the susceptibility to, and severity of,
tuberculosis (Tables 1–3).

11. Potentially Harmful Interactions between Vitamins C and E
Vitamin C and vitamin E are both antioxidants and they protect against ROS. Therefore, these
substances are of parallel interest as water-soluble vitamin C regenerates the lipid-soluble vitamin
E in vitro [152]. Dietary vitamin C intake modified the effect of vitamin E on mortality in the ATBC
Study, which indicates that these substances may also have clinically important interactions [153].
However, the major sources of the vitamin C in this subgroup were fruit, vegetables and berries and
other substances in these foods might also have explained the modification of the vitamin E effect.
Such a possibility was refuted by calculating the residual intake of fruit, vegetables and berries, and
showing that the residual did not modify the effect of vitamin E. Vitamin C was thus indicated as the
specific modifying factor. A similar approach was used to show that vitamin C specifically modified
the effect of vitamin E on pneumonia [154].
Two subgroups of the ATBC Study were identified in which the combination of high dietary
vitamin C intake and vitamin E supplementation increased the risk of pneumonia by 248% and 1350%
when compared with high vitamin C intake without vitamin E (Table 8). In the former subgroup,
one extra case of pneumonia was caused for every 13 participants and in the latter subgroup, for every
28 participants. In both subgroups, the residual intake of fruit, vegetables and berries did not modify
the effect of vitamin E, indicating specificity of vitamin C. The total number of participants in the
ATBC Study was 29,133 and in that respect the identified subgroups were relatively small and at
1081 individuals only amounted to 4% of all the ATBC participants. However, in these two subgroups
the harm arising from the combination of vitamins C and E was substantial [154].
Another subgroup analysis of the ATBC Study found that the combination of high vitamin C
intake together with vitamin E supplementation increased the risk of tuberculosis in heavy smokers by
125% compared with high vitamin C alone subgroup (Table 8). Thus, one extra case of tuberculosis
arose in every 240 participants who had high intakes of vitamins C and E [150,151].
ROS have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases, including infections.
Antioxidants have been assumed to be beneficial since they react with ROS. However, given the
suggestions that people should take vitamins C and E to improve their immune system, the subgroup
findings in Table 8 are somewhat alarming. Nevertheless, the harm in the three subgroups is limited to
the combination of vitamins C and E. This author does not know of any findings that indicate that
similar doses of vitamin C alone might cause harm.

12. Misconceptions and Prejudices about Vitamin C and Infections
In the first half of the 20th century, a large number of papers were published in the medical
literature on vitamin C and infections and several physicians were enthusiastic about vitamin C.
The topic was not dismissed because of large-scale controlled trials showing that vitamin C was
ineffective. Instead, many rather large trials found benefits of vitamin C. There seem to be four
particular reasons why the interest in vitamin C and infections disappeared.
First, antibiotics were introduced in the mid-20th century. They have specific and sometimes
very dramatic effects on bacterial infections and therefore are much more rational first line drugs for
patients with serious infections than vitamin C. Secondly, vitamin C was identified as the explanation
for scurvy, which was considered a disease of the connective tissues. Evidently it seemed irrational
to consider that a substance that “only” participates in collagen metabolism might also have effects
on infections. However, the biochemistry and actions of vitamin C are complex and not limited to
collagen metabolism. Thirdly, the three papers published in 1975 appeared to herald the loss of interest
in vitamin C and the common cold (Figure 1) and it seems likely that they increased the negative
attitude towards vitamin C for other infections as well. Fourthly, “if a treatment bypasses the medical
establishment and is sold directly to the public ... the temptation in the medical community is to accept
uncritically the first bad news that comes along” [155].
The belief that vitamin C is “ineffective” has been widely spread. For example, a survey of general
practitioners in the Netherlands revealed that 47% of respondents considered that homeopathy is
efficacious for the treatment of the common cold, whereas only 20% of those respondents considered
that vitamin C was [156]. Prejudices against vitamin C are not limited to the common cold. Richards
compared the attitudes and arguments of physicians to three putative cancer medicines, 5-fluorouracil,
interferon and vitamin C, and documented unambiguous bias against vitamin C [157–159]. Goodwin
and Tangum gave several examples to support the conclusion that there has been a systematic bias
against the concept that vitamins may yield benefits in levels higher than the minimum needed to
avoid the classic deficiency diseases [160].
The use of vitamin C for preventing and treating colds falls into the category of alternative
medicine under the classifications used by the National Institutes of Health in the USA and of the
Cochrane collaboration. However, such categorization does not reflect the level of evidence for vitamin
C, but reflects the low level of acceptance amongst the medical community, and may further amplify
the inertia and prejudices against vitamin C [161].
13. Conclusions
From a large series of animal studies we may conclude that vitamin C plays a role in preventing,
shortening, and alleviating diverse infections. It seems evident that vitamin C has similar effects in
humans. Controlled studies have shown that vitamin C shortens and alleviates the common cold and
prevents colds under specific conditions and in restricted population subgroups. Five controlled trials
found significant effects of vitamin C against pneumonia. There is some evidence that vitamin C may
also have effects on other infections, but there is a paucity of such data. The practical importance and
optimally efficacious doses of vitamin C for preventing and treating infections are unknown. Vitamin
C is safe and costs only pennies per gram, and therefore even modest effects may be worth exploiting.
