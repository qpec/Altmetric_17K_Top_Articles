Most strains of rhinovirus (RV), the common cold virus, replicate
better at cool temperatures found in the nasal cavity (33–35 °C) than
at lung temperature (37 °C). Recent studies found that although
37 °C temperature suppressed RV growth largely by engaging
the type 1 IFN response in infected epithelial cells, a significant
temperature dependence to viral replication remained in cells de-
void of IFN induction or signaling. To gain insight into IFN-independent
mechanisms limiting RV replication at 37 °C, we studied RV infec-
tion in human bronchial epithelial cells and H1-HeLa cells. During
the single replication cycle, RV exhibited temperature-dependent
replication in both cell types in the absence of IFN induction. At
37 °C, earlier signs of apoptosis in RV-infected cells were accom-
panied by reduced virus production. Furthermore, apoptosis of
epithelial cells was enhanced at 37 °C in response to diverse stimuli.
Dynamic mathematical modeling and B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) over-
expression revealed that temperature-dependent host cell death
could partially account for the temperature-dependent growth ob-
served during RV amplification, but also suggested additional mech-
anisms of virus control. In search of a redundant antiviral pathway,
we identified a role for the RNA-degrading enzyme RNAseL. Simul-
taneous antagonism of apoptosis and RNAseL increased viral rep-
lication and dramatically reduced temperature dependence. These
findings reveal two IFN-independent mechanisms active in innate
defense against RV, and demonstrate that even in the absence of
IFNs, temperature-dependent RV amplification is largely a result of
host cell antiviral restriction mechanisms operating more effec-
tively at 37 °C than at 33 °C.

I
n the 1960s, rhinoviruses (RVs) were first cultured from pa-
tient samples and shown to cause acute upper respiratory in-
fections (a.k.a. common colds). Early work showed that RV
isolates replicated best in culture when incubated at temperatures
slightly cooler than core body temperature (33–35 °C) (1, 2). This
observation fit with the role of RV as a cause of disease in the
nasal cavity, but not the lungs, as the nasal cavity is cooled by
inhalation of environmental air, but the lungs are generally con-
sidered to be at core body temperature (37 °C). The primary target
cells of RV infection are the airway epithelial cells that line the
respiratory tract. Similar to all cells of the body, airway epithelial
cells are equipped with a cell-intrinsic innate immune system that
can sense the presence of a viral infection, using pattern recog-
nition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I like
receptors (RLRs), and can respond to the infection by inducing
antiviral effector mechanisms (3). Recently, we used mouse pri-
mary airway cells and a mouse-adapted RV to show that repli-
cating RV is recognized by the RLRs within airway epithelial cells,
leading to two innate immune signaling events that occur more
robustly at warm temperature than at cool temperature: activation
of RLRs leading to induction of type 1 IFNs and induction of
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via signaling through the type 1 IFN
receptor, IFN-αβR (4). However, some restriction of viral rep-
lication at 37 °C persisted even in the genetic absence of mole-
cules required for the type 1 IFN response, including the RLR
signaling adaptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS),
and IFN-αβR. These observations prompted us to explore whether
other additional host defense mechanisms also participate in the
temperature-dependent restriction of RV replication.
In this study, we examined IFN-independent mechanisms in-
volved in temperature-dependent control of RV replication. Our
results reveal that, in the absence of IFN responses, rapid death of
infected cells plays an important role in restricting RV replication,
that the death rate of epithelial cells in response to diverse apo-
ptotic stimuli is temperature-dependent, and that this temperature-
dependent death rate contributes to the enhanced restriction of
RV replication at 37 °C. Through mathematical modeling, we
discovered that the increased rate of cell death could account
largely, but not completely, for the temperature-dependent repli-
cation of RV. Furthermore, blockade of the apoptotic pathway
alone was unable to close the temperature gap in RV replication.
We found that RNAseL, together with apoptosis, controls tem-
perature-dependent RV replication. These findings demonstrate
the importance of two double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent
host pathways for limiting RV replication and reveal mechanisms
in addition to the IFN response whereby temperature affects host
antiviral defense and replication of the common cold virus.
Significance
Most strains of rhinovirus (RV), the common cold virus, repli-
cate better at cool temperatures found in the nasal cavity (33–
35°C) than at lung temperature (37°C). Recently, we found that
although 37°C temperature suppressed RV growth by pro-
moting IFN secretion, some antiviral effects of temperature
were IFN-independent. Here, we used H1-HeLa cells and human
bronchial epithelial cells to explore additional mechanisms
underlying temperature-dependent RV growth. Using mathe-
matical modeling and genetic approaches, we show that to-
gether, enhanced host cell death and the double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA)-dependent activity of RNAseL contribute to restriction of
RV growth at 37°C. These findings show that even in the absence
of interferons, temperature has profound effects on antiviral
defense that affect the outcome of common cold infections.

 Results
Temperature-Dependent Viral Replication in the Absence of IFN
Induction During Single-Cycle RV Replication in Human Bronchial
Epithelial Cells. First, we examined RV-1B replication in hu-
man bronchial epithelial cells during a single replication cycle
by infecting all cells in the monolayer, using a high multiplicity of
infection (MOI, 20). After inoculation, medium was added and
plates containing multiple replicate wells of infected cells were in-
cubated at 33 °C or 37 °C. Cells were collected at sequential 2-h
intervals to assess the time course of viral replication by reverse
transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). RV RNA level peaked
earlier and at a lower viral load in host cells incubated at 37 °C
compared with 33 °C (Fig. 1A, Left). During the single replication
cycle, we did not observe induction of IFNs or of the ISG, Oas1
(Fig. 1A, Right), or IFN secretion (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
These observations suggested the possibility of an IFN-in-
dependent viral restriction mechanism operating to limit viral rep-
lication at 37 °C under these conditions. Previously, we observed
IFN secretion during RV replication in mouse primary airway ep-
ithelial cells, and previous studies have reported induction of type
1 and type 3 IFN expression during RV infection in human bron-
chial epithelial cells (4–6). Consistently, we observed induction of
IFNβ mRNA in bronchial cells at 48 h after amplification of RV1B
from a low MOI (0.1) (Fig. 1B). Similar to our observations in
mouse airway cells, the induction of IFNβ mRNA was temperature-
dependent (37 °C > 33 °C). Together with previous results, this
indicates that cytoplasmic dsRNA generated during RV infection
can trigger an RLR-dependent IFN response in human airway cells,
but that amplification of RLR signaling capacity is required for
robust IFN induction (7). Our results indicate that although RV can
induce IFN expression in human bronchial epithelial cells during
viral amplification (Fig. 1B), this is not the mechanism restricting
viral replication at 37 °C at early times postinfection (Fig. 1A).
On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that this IFN-
independent mechanism of virus restriction may be important in
defense against RV strains that antagonize the IFN pathway. To
this end, we used RV-14, which blocks interferon regulatory
factor 3 (IRF3) activation and IFN induction in A549 cells (8).
Unlike human bronchial epithelial cells, A549 cells respond to
stimulation with small molecule ligands of the cytoplasmic RNA
sensor retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), which leads to IFN
induction via IRF3 (9) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). However, on
infection of A549 cells with RV-14, we observed no induction of
IFNβ, IFNλ1, or Oas1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), consistent with
antagonism of IRF3 activation by RV-14 (8). Importantly, tem-
perature-dependent RV14 replication in A549 cells (increase in
viral load at 33 °C but not 37 °C) was preserved despite viral
evasion of the IFN response. These data indicate that additional
mechanisms operate to restrict viral replication at 37 °C, even in
the face of antagonism of the IFN pathway.
In H1-HeLa Cells, RV Exhibits Robust Temperature-Dependent Replication
in the Absence of IFN Induction. Next we sought a model with which to
study the IFN-independent mechanism or mechanisms that might
contribute to restricting viral replication at 37 °C. To this end, we
searched for a cell line that supports robust temperature-dependent
RV replication and amplification similar to that observed in primary
bronchial cells, in the absence of IFNs. H1-HeLa cells are a human
cervical epithelial cell line developed for use in RV studies, and they
have been reported to support high levels of RV replication with
minimal IFN induction (10). RV replication in HeLa cells has been
shown to recapitulate many aspects of RV infection in primary
bronchial epithelial cells, including replication kinetics, viral protein
processing, and viral protein localization, and effects of RV on the
nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking (11). Paralleling our observations in
bronchial epithelial cells, IFN mRNAs were minimally induced, and
Oas1 mRNA was not induced (Fig. 1C). However, as in bronchial
cells, viral replication plateaued earlier and at a lower viral load at
37 °C than at 33 °C (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we observed temper-
ature-dependent RV1B amplification, but no type 1 or type 3 IFN
induction, by 48 h postinfection when H1-HeLa cells were chal-
lenged with a MOI of 0.1 (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A and
B). In addition, H1-HeLa cells did not express IFNs in response to
transfection with RIG-I ligand (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C). Over-
expression of RIG-I enabled IFN induction after RV1B infection
in H1-HeLa cells and reduced viral replication (SI Appendix, Fig.
S3 D–F). These data indicate that H1-HeLa cells are naturally
deficient in RIG-I responsiveness, and therefore, we chose this cell
type as a model in which to investigate IFN-independent mecha-
nisms of temperature-dependent RV restriction.
Higher Temperature Leads to Earlier Onset of Death of Virus-Infected
Cells. To gain insight into mechanisms limiting viral replication in
the absence of IFN secretion, we examined RV replication and host
cell responses. Notably, H1-HeLa cells infected with RV at 37 °C at
a MOI of 20 underwent morphological changes consistent with cell
death (cell retraction, rounding and detachment from the sub-
stratum) starting at 7 h postinfection, whereas no changes were
evident in cells incubated at 33 °C until 9 h postinfection (Fig. 2A).
Cell rounding and detachment were not accompanied by lactate

equivalent inoculation of all cultures, then incubated at 33 °C (blue dots) or 37 °C

 dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, indicating that cells were not
necrotic or pyroptotic (Fig. 2B). Similarly, bronchial epithelial
cells supporting RV1B replication exhibited retraction, rounding,
and ultimately detachment from the substratum, with minimal
LDH release, starting at 9 h postinfection in cells incubated at
37 °C, but not until 11 h at 33 °C (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A–C). The
timing of morphological changes for each cell type appeared to
parallel the plateau in viral replication (Fig. 1 A and C), suggesting
that effects of temperature on cell death rate might contribute to
the differences in peak viral load observed in cells incubated at the
different temperatures.
It is known that intracellular dsRNA is a potent trigger of apo-
ptosis (12). Although RV has a single-stranded RNA genome, dsRNA
is generated as a viral replication intermediate in the cytoplasm
of host cells (2). RV infection has been reported to trigger apoptosis
in HeLa cells and airway epithelial cells (13). To investigate the
possible relationship between viral RNA accumulation, tempera-
ture, and cell death, we costained RV1B-infected H1-HeLa cells for
double-stranded RNA and an antibody specific for the activated
form of caspase-3, an effector of apoptosis. Flow cytometric
analysis of cells supporting RV1B replication revealed enhanced
apoptosis of cells containing equivalent amounts of dsRNA
when incubated at 37 °C compared with 33 °C (Fig. 2 C–E). To
extend this observation to another strain of RV, we infected
H1-HeLa cells with the major group RV16. Again, we observed
a greater degree of activation of caspase-3 in cells containing
similar levels of dsRNA when incubated at 37 °C compared
with 33 °C (Fig. 2 C–E). These observations led us to hypoth-
esize that a temperature of 37 °C restricts RV replication by
enhancing apoptosis, thereby ending the replication cycle at a
lower viral load in RV-infected epithelial cells incubated at
37 °C compared with cells incubated at 33 °C.
To remove the variable of viral replication and directly test
whether an equivalent amount of dsRNA triggers different levels
of caspase-3 activation at different ambient temperatures, we
next transfected cells with Poly I:C (PIC), a synthetic mimic of
viral dsRNA that has been reported to trigger apoptosis via
multiple pathways (12). PIC transfection resulted in caspase-3
activation, with more robust activation of caspase-3 at 37 °C
compared with 33 °C in both HeLa cells and primary human
bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 2F and SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
RV Infection Induces Apoptosis in Infected Cells. Next, we investigated
the mechanism of cell death in RV1B-infected cells, using caspase
inhibitors. RV1B infected cells with morphological changes did not
exhibit significant LDH release (Fig. 2B) or staining with a cell-
permeable dye (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A), indicating that cells were
not undergoing necrosis or pyroptosis. Instead, we observed
activation of the apoptotic caspase, caspase-3, in RV-infected cells
(Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). In addition, cells that became
membrane permeable after RV infection all had activated caspase-3
(SI Appendix, Fig. S6A), indicating that they underwent apoptosis
followed by loss of membrane integrity. Further, the caspase-1 in-
hibitor VX-765 had no effect on the morphological changes after
RV1B infection or the accumulation of dsRNA (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6 B and C). In contrast, the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD (which
inhibits apoptotic caspases) profoundly inhibited RV1B-induced
morphological changes (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). In RV-infected H1
HeLa cells, we did not observe secretion of IL-1β (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6D), indicating that this virus infection triggers minimal caspase-1
activation or pyroptosis.
Apoptosis can occur via the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway
or the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. To better understand
the contribution of these pathways to RV-induced death, we
used specific inhibitors of the caspases. During RV1B infection,
inhibition of either caspase-8 or caspase-9 diminished caspase-3
activation in dsRNA-positive cells, as did the pan-caspase in-
hibitor zVAD (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 A and B). Caspase inhibitors
have previously been reported to partially cross-inhibit the RV
2A protease essential for the viral life cycle, because of similarities
between caspases and RV cysteine proteases (14). Consistent with
an inhibitory effect on viral replication, we observed that both
zVAD and the caspase-8 inhibitor IETD reduced accumulation of
dsRNA during the single replication cycle (SI Appendix, Fig. S7C).
To assess the apoptotic pathway or pathways activated by dsRNA
without the variable of viral replication, we next transfected cells
with the PIC and assessed the effect of caspase-3 activation in the
presence of caspase inhibitors. As in RV infection, inhibition of
either caspase-8 or caspase-9 partially inhibited dsRNA-dependent
caspase-3 activation (SI Appendix, Fig. S7D). Taken together, these
results indicate that both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways contribute
to RV- and dsRNA-triggered apoptosis.
Diverse Apoptotic Stimuli Trigger Temperature-Dependent Death of
Epithelial Cells. Protection from cell death under conditions of mild
hypothermia (32–35 °C) has been extensively studied in neurons and
has been used therapeutically for neuronal cytoprotection after brain
injury (15). Lowering temperature has also been reported to delay
apoptosis in other cell types, including cardiomyocytes and fibro-
blasts, and diverse mechanisms have been implicated, but previous
studies have not specifically addressed epithelial cells (16, 17).
Therefore, we next examined whether temperature dependence
of cell death tracked with a particular apoptotic pathway by treating
cells with known triggers of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. Tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) + actinomycin D (AD), known to trigger
extrinsic apoptosis, elicited temperature-dependent caspase-3 acti-
vation by 4 h (Fig. 2G). Consistent with apoptotic death, activation
of caspase-3 was diminished by zVAD treatment, and no increase in
cell permeability was observed (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A). The fungal
toxin gliotoxin has been shown to trigger apoptosis via the intrinsic
pathway (18). Similar to TNF + AD, gliotoxin triggered caspase-3
activation in a temperature-dependent manner (Fig. 2G).

 Consistent with their roles in intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis,
respectively, gliotoxin-induced caspase-3 activation was inhibited
by overexpression of the antiapoptotic mitochondrial mem-
brane protein BCL2, whereas TNF + AD-induced caspase
activation was not (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 B and C). Similar to
TNF + AD, PIC triggered caspase-3 activation but did not in-
crease cell permeability (SI Appendix, Fig. S8D), and cell death
was inhibited by zVAD at both 33 °C and 37 °C (SI Appendix, Fig.
S8E). Taken together, these results demonstrate a profound effect
of incubation temperature on both the intrinsic and extrinsic ap-
optotic pathways in epithelial cells and support the hypothesis
that 37 °C temperature restricts RV replication by potentiating
rapid death of host cells during viral replication.
Temperature-Dependent Cell Death Rates Predict Viral Amplification
Differences in a Mathematical Model. To test the hypothesis that
death of the infected cells restricts RV replication at 37 °C
temperature, we used mathematical modeling. We constructed a
mathematical model based on single-step replication kinetics
and asked whether observed rates of cell death could account for
the differences in viral titer reached during viral amplification at
33 °C vs. 37 °C over multiple replication cycles (see model de-
scription in SI Appendix). The model was trained using data
obtained from single-step replication experiments in H1-HeLa
cells (Fig. 3 A and B). The mathematical model predicted two
temperature-dependent rates that would fit the experimental
data: the rate of cell death and the rate of initiation of virus
production from infected cells. Both of these rates were ∼two-
fold higher at 37 °C than at 33 °C. To test the validity of this
mathematical model, we simulated viral amplification over the
course of 48 h from a low MOI, using these rates as the only
variables affected by incubation temperature. The simulated vi-
ral amplification curves at 33 °C and 37 °C (lines, Fig. 3C) closely
approximated the observed viral amplification curves [symbols,
Fig. 3C (4)]. These results indicated that enhanced rate of death
of infected cells at 37 °C compared with 33 °C could largely
account for temperature-dependent RV growth in this cell type.
BCL2 Overexpression Partially Rescues RV Replication at 37 °C. Our
mathematical model suggested that death of host cells is an im-
portant mechanism restricting RV growth, and may function in part
to restrict viral growth preferentially at 37 °C compared with 33 °C.
To test this experimentally, we stably expressed the antiapoptotic
protein BCL2 in H1-HeLa cells and examined RV1B replication.
H1-HeLa cells stably transduced with a lentivirus encoding BCL2
expressed BCL2 mRNA at levels six times higher than the parent
cells or vector-only transduced cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S8B). Con-
sistent with our hypothesis, RV1B reached a higher peak titer in
BCL2-overexpressing cells, and replication disproportionally in-
creased in cells at 37 °C (Fig. 4 A and B). Examining the time course
of viral replication revealed that BCL2-overexpressing cells had
delayed appearance of cell rounding and detachment during the
single replication cycle, and that single-step replication was some-
what delayed relative to control cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S9), al-
though ultimately the virus reached higher titers in these cells
(Fig. 4 A and B). RV1B replication in BCL2-overexpressing cells
exhibited less temperature dependence than in the parent H1-HeLa
cells, with a ∼10-fold higher final titer at 33 °C than at 37 °C in
BCL2-overexpressing cells compared with a ∼40-fold difference in
titer in RV1B replicating in the parent cell line (Fig. 4 A and B).
However, the significantly enhanced replication at 33 °C compared
with 37 °C in the BCL-2 overexpressing cell line suggested that
additional mechanisms might also be contributing to the tem-
perature dependence of viral replication.
RNaseL Replication and Cell Death Kinetics Restrict RV at Core Body
Temperature. The data obtained in BCL2-overexpressing cells as
well as the incomplete agreement of the mathematical model with
the data, particularly underestimation of viral amplification at 33 °C
(and overestimation at 37 °C), suggested that mechanisms in ad-
dition to temperature-dependent host cell death may differentially
limit viral replication at distinct temperatures. We therefore ex-
amined IFN and cell death-independent mechanisms of viral

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 restriction that might contribute to the enhanced RV replication at
33 °C. In addition to initiating RLR signaling, leading to IFN se-
cretion, dsRNA generated during viral infection can directly activate
dsRNA-dependent antiviral effectors. These include protein kinase
R (PKR), a dsRNA-dependent enzyme that halts protein synthesis
upon dsRNA detection, and 2′5′ oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS).
Upon binding of dsRNA, OAS enzymes OAS1–OAS3 generate
oligomers of adenosine from ATP that then activate the RNA-
degrading enzyme RNAseL, leading to degradation of viral RNA
(19–21). Even though PKR, RNAseL, and OAS genes are ISGs
(expression is enhanced by IFN signaling), they can also be con-
stitutively expressed. To assess the effect of temperature on con-
stitutive expression of dsRNA-dependent antiviral effectors, we
performed qPCR to assess mRNA levels of these dsRNA-activated
effectors in H1-HeLa cells, and we examined the effect of a 10 h
temperature shift to 33 °C compared with continued incubation at
37 °C. All mRNAs were detectable in unstimulated cells (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S10), and mRNA level for RNAseL was ∼2.2-fold
higher after 10 h incubation at 37 °C compared with 33 °C (SI
Appendix, Fig. S11A). RNAseL mRNA was also enhanced at 37 °C
relative to 33 °C in primary human bronchial epithelial cells after a
9 h incubation at 33 °C vs. 37 °C (SI Appendix, Fig. S11A). To test
the contribution of these effectors to temperature-dependent viral
restriction, we used siRNA knockdown of PKR or RNAseL
(knockdown reduced expression to <10% of control levels; SI
Appendix, Fig. S11B). Knockdown of PKR did not alter RV1B
replication at either temperature (SI Appendix, Fig. S11C, Left).
However, siRNA knockdown of RNAseL expression significantly
increased viral replication (SI Appendix, Fig. S11C, Right).
To examine the mechanism of increased viral replication in
RNaseL knockdown cells, we examined RV1B replication during
the single replication cycle. Antagonizing RNASeL led to a
faster rate of viral replication at both temperatures (SI Appendix,
Fig. S11D). This was not the result of prevention of apoptosis. In
fact, cell retraction, rounding, and detachment appeared earlier
in RNaseL knockdown cells infected with RV (SI Appendix, Fig.
S11E). During the single RV replication cycle, RNAseL knock-
down led to faster accumulation of dsRNA within infected cells,
and cells containing high levels of dsRNA rapidly became caspase-3
active (SI Appendix, Fig. S11F). These findings indicated that, on
antagonism of RNAseL, rapid onset of apoptotic death in cells
accumulating high levels of cytoplasmic dsRNA caused an earlier
end to the replication cycle. DsRNA-induced apoptosis in this
setting, therefore, appears to partially compensate for lack of
RNAseL to limit viral replication (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 D–F).
These findings suggested that two dsRNA-triggered host defense
mechanisms, dsRNA-triggered apoptosis and RNASeL activity,
play compensatory roles during RV infection, creating a resilient
host defense strategy in case of viral evasion of either pathway.
Apoptosis and RNAseL Are Redundant Pathways that Control RV
Replication at 37 °C. On the basis of the data indicating that ap-
optosis and RNAseL each contribute to viral control, particularly
at lung temperature, we examined the effect of blocking both
apoptosis and RNaseL simultaneously and compared this with
blocking each mechanism separately. To do this, we used BCL2
overexpression and RNAseL knockdown in host cells. Antago-
nizing both apoptosis and RNAseL together dramatically in-
creased replication of RV1B, particularly at 37 °C (Fig. 4A). We
observed a 42-fold difference in peak viral titer at 33 °C com-
pared with 37 °C during infection of control H1-HeLa cells, but
only fivefold difference when both apoptosis and RNAseL were
antagonized (Fig. 4C). These findings demonstrate that even in
the absence of IFN production, temperature-dependent RV
amplification is largely a result of host cell antiviral restriction
mechanisms that operate more effectively at 37 °C than at 33 °C;
namely, cell death and RNAseL. Our observations support a
model in which each of these pathways, triggered by dsRNA, can
compensate to limit RV replication when the other pathway is
blocked (Fig. 4D); that is, as host cells accumulate viral dsRNA, this
triggers the cell death pathway, limiting the duration of the repli-
cation cycle. However, if cells are able to survive longer, accumu-
lating dsRNA also triggers the RNAseL pathway, leading to
degradation of viral RNA. Conversely, antagonizing RNAseL leads
to faster accumulation of dsRNA in the cytoplasm of host cells,
which triggers cell death sooner (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 D–F).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether IFN-independent host
defense mechanisms contribute to restricting replication of the
common cold virus at lung temperature (37 °C) in human epi-
thelial cells for the following reasons. First, our previous study
found that some temperature dependence of RV replication
remained even in host cells deficient in the IFN response (4).
Second, recent evidence indicates that human bronchial epithe-
lial cells have naturally attenuated IFN responses to some cy-
toplasmic nucleic acids, including RLR ligands (9). Third, RV
strains have evolved to evade IFN responses (8). Finally, di-
minished IFN responses in the airway epithelium are associated
with conditions such as asthma and cigarette smoke exposure, in
which RV infection results in exacerbated disease (22–24). Al-
though diverse lines of evidence suggest that virus-induced IFNs
contribute to defense against RV infection, increasing evidence
from studies in bronchial epithelial cells indicates that the
mechanisms involved (i.e., the RLR signaling pathway) require
time for up-regulation before mediating a robust IFN response
(6, 7, 9). Consistently, we observed IFN induction in primary
human bronchial epithelial cells supporting RV amplification by
48 h postinfection, but no induction of IFNs during the initial
12-h single replication cycle (Fig. 1 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig.
S1). Together, previous studies and our data illustrate situations
in which the IFN response to RV is attenuated in human epithelial
cells, emphasizing the importance of investigating IFN-independent
host defense mechanisms that restrict RV replication ((8, 25); Fig. 1
and SI Appendix, Figs. S1 and S2).
Our studies revealed two temperature-dependent effectors of
host cell response to RV infection even in the absence of IFN
induction: cell death and RNaseL. We found that in H1-HeLa
cells, apoptosis was profoundly enhanced by 37 °C temperature
in response to RV infection and cytoplasmic double-stranded
RNA. We also observed greater apoptosis at 37 °C compared
with 33 °C in response to diverse triggers including known stimuli
of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Through
antagonism of apoptosis with BCL-2 overexpression and through
mathematical modeling, we found that enhanced death rate of
RV-infected cells at 37 °C compared with 33 °C largely accounts
for the restriction of RV replication at this temperature. How-
ever, differences in cell death rates alone could not completely
explain the differences in RV replication at the two tempera-
tures. We found that the discrepancy is the result of an addi-
tional mechanism of RV restriction that depends on RNAseL.
We did not test all possible dsRNA-dependent antiviral re-
sponses, including non-RNAseL-dependent antiviral responses
of OAS proteins and the related OASL protein (26). Therefore,
our study does not rule out additional mechanisms of dsRNA-
dependent control of RV. Altogether our studies have identified
three distinct pathways of RV control at core body temperature;
namely, RLR signaling-dependent IFN responses (4), IFN-in-
dependent apoptosis of infected cells, and RNAseL-dependent
degradation of RV RNA. We propose that the three distinct
antiviral pathways provide the host with resilient defense against
viruses that evade any one of these pathways.
How might the compensatory activities of cell death and RNAseL
be coordinated to limit RV replication? Our data support a
model in which antagonizing cell death leads to a higher level of
dsRNA in infected cells, which in turn enhances synthesis of 2′-5′

 oligoadenylate by OAS proteins interacting with dsRNA. This li-
gand activates RNAseL leading to enhanced degradation of viral
RNA (Fig. 4D). Conversely, RNaseL inhibition permits more rapid
accumulation of dsRNA during viral replication, triggering death of
infected cells and thereby limiting RV replication (Fig. 4D). Only
through the inhibition of both cell death and RNAseL did we ob-
serve a dramatic increase in RV titer at 37 °C. Redundancy of
antiviral responses and the compensatory relationship among them
creates resilient protection for the host, which is often critical for
host defense, given the propensity of viruses to evolve mechanisms
to evade host innate immune defenses (27). Although previous
studies of RV biology showed no enhancement of viral entry or viral
polymerase activity by cool temperature (28, 29), a recent study
reported that cool temperature can promote IRES-driven trans-
lation required for the life cycle of picornaviruses (30). Therefore,
future studies are needed to further understand how the host and
viral mechanisms that promote RV replication at the cooler
temperatures are coordinated within infected cells. The findings
reported here highlight the profound impact of ambient tempera-
ture on host cell biology and innate immune defense, including, but
undoubtedly not limited to, the capacity to effectively fight infection
by the common cold virus.
Materials and Methods
Viruses and Cells. RV-1B, RV-16, and RV-14 were obtained from ATCC (ATCC
VR-1645, ATCC VR-283, and ATCC VR-284, respectively) and amplified in
H1-HeLa cells (a generous gift from W.M. Lee, University of Wisconsin). A549
cells (ATCC CCL-185) were cultured in F12K medium, 10% (vol/vol) FBS, penicillin-
streptomycin, and infection medium was F12K medium, 5% (vol/vol) FBS,
penicillin-streptomycin, and 30 mM MgCl2. Primary human bronchial epithe-
lial cells and bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM) were obtained from
Lonza, and cells were cultured according to manufacturer’s protocols.
Viral Infections. H1-HeLa cells were seeded in 6 -well (or 12-well) plates the day
before experiment and infected at 80% confluence. All cells were plated and
cultured identically at 37 °C, then inoculated simultaneously at 33 °C to ensure an
equivalent infection of all cultures before the temperature shift. Cells were in-
oculated by incubating with 200 μL (or 100 μL) virus stock diluted in PBS/0.1%
BSA for 1 h at 33 °C to achieve indicated MOI. At t = 1 h, inoculum was removed,
cells were washed with warm PBS, medium was added, and plates were replaced
in the 33 °C incubator or shifted to 37 °C until indicated time, at which times cells
were collected to assay viral growth and/or host cell response to infection.
Intracellular Staining for Flow Cytometry. Cells were collected using trypsin/
EDTA, washed, and fixed on ice with Fix/Perm buffer (BD Biosciences). Cells were
stained with α-capsase-3-PE or α-capsase-3-FITC, using the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol (1:10; BD Biosciences). To costain for double-stranded RNA, we used the
α-dsRNA monoclonal antibody clone J2 (1:1,000; English & Scientific Consulting
Kft) directly conjugated to Dy488 (Innova Biosciences). To detect cell perme-
ability, we used the Far-Red Fixable Live/Dead Stain (Thermo-Fisher.)
Stimulation of Cells. Cells were transfected with PIC (Sigma P9582 or InvivoGen
tlrl-picw) or small molecule ligands for RIG-I receptor, including 5ppp-RNA
(InvivoGen) and the hairpin RNA 14hp [a generous gift from A. Pyle (31)]. Extra-
cellular PIC was used to stimulate TLR3 (2 μg/mL added to the culture medium).
For apoptotic stimuli, cells were incubated at 33 °C or 37 °C for 4 h before
caspase-3 staining with gliotoxin (10 μM; Sigma), or TNF (50 ng/mL; eBio-
science) + AD (0.5 μg/mL; MP Biomedicals). Mock-treated wells contained vehicle
only (DMSO). Caspase inhibitors included: zVAD-FMK (InvivoGen), zIETD-FMK
(BD Biosciences), zLEHD-FMK (BD Biosciences), and VX-765 (InvivoGen).
siRNA Knockdown. siRNAs were obtained from GE-Dharmacon as follows: RISC-
free (D-001220-01), RNaseL (D-005032-02, CGACUAAGAUUAAUGAAUG), PKR
(D-003527-01;CAAAUUAGCUGUUGAGAUA). TheyweretransfectedinH1-HeLacells
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Subconfluent H1-HeLa cells were trans-
fected with siRNA, then incubated at 37 °C in complete medium for 2 d before
infection experiments. At the time of infection, HeLa cells were ∼80% confluent.
BCL2 Overexpression. BCL2-RFP-Bsd overexpressing (LVP553) and control
(CMV-null-Bsd) lentiviral vectors were obtained from GenTarget, Inc. H1-HeLa
cells were transduced and selected following manufacturer’s protocols.
Briefly, after drug selection (blasticidin), transduced RFP-high cells were se-
lected using FACS, then cultured using conventional techniques.
Statistical Analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software, Inc.).
