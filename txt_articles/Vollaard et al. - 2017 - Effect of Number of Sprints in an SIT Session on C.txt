ABSTRACT 
16 
 
17 
Purpose: Recent meta-analyses indicate that sprint interval training (SIT) improves 
18 
cardiorespiratory fitness (V
̇ O2max), but the effects of various training parameters on the 
19 
magnitude of the improvement remain unknown. The present meta-analysis examined the 
20 
modifying effect of the number of sprint repetitions in a SIT session on improvements in 
21 
V
̇ O2max. 
22 
Methods: The databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched for original studies 
23 
that have examined pre- and post-training V
̇ O2max in adults following ≥2 weeks of training 
24 
consisting of repeated (≥2) Wingate-type cycle sprints, published up to 1 May 2016. Articles 
25 
were excluded if they were not in English, involved patients, athletes, or participants with a 
26 
mean baseline V
̇ O2max of >55 mL·kg-1·min-1 or a mean age <18 years, and if a SIT trial was 
27 
combined with another intervention or used intervals shorter than 10 s. A total of 38 SIT trials 
28 
from 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Probabilistic magnitude-based 
29 
inferences were made to interpret the outcome of the analysis.  
30 
Results: The meta-analysis revealed a likely large effect of a typical SIT intervention on 
31 
V
̇ O2max (mean ± 90 CL %: 7.8% ± 4.0%) with a possibly small modifying effect of the 
32 
maximum number of sprint repetitions in a training session (-1.2 ± 0.8% decrease per 2 
33 
additional sprint repetitions). Apart from possibly small effects of baseline V
̇ O2max and age, 
34 
all other modifying effects were unclear or trivial.  
35 
Conclusion: We conclude that the improvement in V
̇ O2max with SIT is not attenuated with 
36 
fewer sprint repetitions, and possibly even enhanced. This means that SIT protocols can be 
37 
made more time-efficient, which may help SIT to be developed into a viable strategy to 
38 
impact public health.

INTRODUCTION 
43 
 
44 
The global increase in prevalence of noncommunicable diseases over the past decades (33) 
45 
can be attributed, at least in part, to the low levels of physical activity undertaken by the 
46 
majority of the general population (16). In light of this, a key aim of public health 
47 
organisations is to increase population physical activity levels (20). Of the health markers 
48 
that can be improved by physical activity, maximal aerobic capacity (V
̇ O2max) is consistently 
49 
shown to be the strongest prognostic marker for future cardiovascular health and premature 
50 
death in cross-sectional studies (36, 54). Furthermore, longitudinal studies demonstrate that 
51 
improvements in V
̇ O2max are associated with substantial reductions in all-cause and 
52 
cardiovascular mortality during follow-up (9, 41).  
53 
Over the past two decades, relatively high volumes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise 
54 
(total time commitment ≥150 min per week) have consistently been recommended for 
55 
improving health markers (20). However, uptake of and adherence to these 
56 
recommendations remains low in the general population (25), with lack of time identified as 
57 
one of the main perceived barriers to becoming and remaining physically active (37, 39, 68). 
58 
Therefore, the seminal finding by Burgomaster et al. (12) that a training protocol consisting 
59 
of repeated brief ‘all-out’ cycle sprints (i.e. Wingate sprints) is associated with aerobic 
60 
adaptations, has led to substantial interest in the use of (sub)maximal high-intensity interval 
61 
training (HIIT) and supramaximal sprint interval training (SIT) as time-efficient 
62 
alternative/adjunct exercise strategies for improving V
̇ O2max (21). The most commonly 
63 
studied SIT protocol consists of 4-7 repeated 30-s Wingate sprints, thus resulting in less 
64 
than 4 minutes of high-intensity exercise per session (72). Over the past few years, several 
65 
meta-analyses have reported the efficacy of SIT in increasing V
̇ O2max (24, 51, 62, 72). 
66 
These have concluded that in healthy individuals, SIT improves V
̇ O2max to a similar (24) or 
67 
greater extent (51) than traditional aerobic training, with greater benefits for individuals with 
68 
lower pre-training V
̇ O2max (51, 72).  
69 
 4 
 
Although these findings provide strong support for the effectiveness of SIT in improving 
70 
V
̇ O2max, surprisingly few efforts have been made to identify ‘optimal’ SIT protocols, e.g. 
71 
protocols which will either provide the greatest increase in V
̇ O2max, or a set increase with 
72 
the lowest total training volume or time commitment. Weston et al. (72) reported a likely 
73 
small effect of increasing the intervention duration and a possibly moderate effect of 
74 
increasing the work-to-rest ratio, but no studies have meta-analysed or directly investigated 
75 
the potential effects of the number of sprint repetitions in a SIT session. This parameter is 
76 
particularly important as it has a large influence on the total duration of a training session, as 
77 
well as the level of fatigue (42) and affective responses (19) experienced by the participant, 
78 
thus influencing the likelihood of individuals taking up and adhering to a specific SIT 
79 
intervention (26). As the main aim of investigating SIT protocols is generally to identify a 
80 
time-efficient alternative to aerobic exercise, there is a need to identify the effect of this 
81 
training parameter on the associated increase in V
̇ O2max. Recent evidence suggests that 
82 
the positive effects of SIT on V
̇ O2max can be attained with fewer sprints (22, 23, 34, 48), and 
83 
therefore the aim of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis to provide estimates 
84 
of the modifying effect of the number of sprint repetitions in SIT protocols on the increase in 
85 
V
̇ O2max in untrained adult participants following training.

METHODS

88 
2.1  
Literature Search Criteria and Study Selection 
89 
This study was undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
90 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines (52). We aimed to identify all 
91 
studies that have examined pre- and post-training V
̇ O2max following a period of at least 2 
92 
weeks of training consisting of repeated (≥2) ‘all-out’ Wingate cycle sprints or modifications 
93 
thereof (e.g. studies using 10-s, 15-s, or 20-s ‘all-out’ sprints instead of 30-s Wingate 
94 
sprints). For this purpose, the electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were 
95 
searched for relevant available records up to 1 May 2016, using the 28 possible 
96 
combinations of the independent variable search terms ‘Wingate’, ‘all-out’, ‘sprint’, and 
97 
‘interval training’, and the dependent variable search terms ‘fitness’, ‘aerobic capacity’, 
98 
‘aerobic power’, ‘V
̇ O2max’, ‘V
̇ O2peak’, ‘oxygen uptake’, and ‘oxygen consumption’. Relevant 
99 
studies cited in recent meta-analyses were also used (24, 51, 62, 72), as well as our own 
100 
recent work (50). The following articles were excluded: 1) review articles / commentaries, 2) 
101 
articles not written in English, 3) studies concerning patients, athletes, or participants with a 
102 
mean baseline V
̇ O2max of >55 mL·kg-1·min-1 or a mean age <18 years, 4) animal studies, 5) 
103 
study-trials in which SIT was combined with another intervention; and 6) SIT studies using 
104 
non-cycling exercise, intervals shorter than 10 s, or intervals that were not ‘all-out’. Two 
105 
authors (NBJV and RSM) independently conducted the literature search and data extraction, 
106 
and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The reviewers were not blinded to 
107 
manuscript journals or authors. After removal of duplicate records, the titles and abstracts of 
108 
all identified articles were screened for records that were clearly not relevant. These articles 
109 
were omitted before assessing the full-text versions of the remaining articles for eligibility to 
110 
be included in the meta-analysis. If more than one article reported data for the same 
111 
experiment, duplicate data for these participants were only included once. The final dataset 
112 
included the results of 38 trials from 34 studies (Figure 1).

2.2  
Data Extraction 
115 
Full papers were assessed for mean absolute pre- and post-training V
̇ O2max. Absolute 
116 
V
̇ O2max (L·min-1) was used rather than relative V
̇ O2max (mL·kg-1·min-1) as this provides an 
117 
estimate of true changes in the ability to take up and use oxygen, independent of possible 
118 
concomitant changes in body mass. Relative V
̇ O2max was used for the five studies for which 
119 
absolute V
̇ O2max data were not available (8, 40, 46, 55, 65). Any data for V
̇ O2max obtained 
120 
at intermediate time-points during the intervention were excluded. The corresponding 
121 
authors of papers without the required data were contacted by email; authors from 23 
122 
studies were contacted (1, 2, 5, 6, 10-13, 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, 31, 34, 38, 47, 55, 59-61, 65, 
123 
67, 74) and we received raw data from 17 studies (5, 10-13, 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, 38, 47, 55, 
124 
59-61, 74). Graph digitizer software (DigitizeIt, Braunschweig, Germany) was used to obtain 
125 
the data from one study for which absolute pre- and post-training V
̇ O2max data were only 
126 
available in a figure (67). The effect of training was expressed as a percentage change-
127 
score. Percentage effects of SIT on V
̇ O2max were converted to factors (= 1 + effect / 100), 
128 
log transformed for the analysis, and then back transformed to percentages. Effects were 
129 
weighted using percentage standard errors derived from exact p-values, or from estimated 
130 
errors of measurement as recommended by Weston et al. (72). Under the assumption that 
131 
studies with similar test protocols and subject characteristics would have similar typical 
132 
errors of measurement, the typical errors from these studies were averaged (via the 
133 
weighted mean variance) and assigned to the studies that did not report an exact p value (1, 
134 
2, 6, 34, 44, 65, 67). The SE was then calculated via the relationship between typical error 
135 
and SE (69). Finally, data for the following potential moderators were extracted for each 
136 
study: participant characteristics (sex, age, body mass index (BMI), baseline V
̇ O2max), 
137 
training parameters (intervention duration, total number of training sessions, maximal 
138 
number of sprint repetitions per training session, sprint duration, sprint/recovery ratio, sprint 
139 
resistance), and study-type (controlled / uncontrolled; dummy variable). For trials with a no-
140 
 7 
 
exercise control group, the effect entered into the meta-analysis was intervention minus 
141 
control. Data for aerobic exercise comparator groups were not included in the meta-analysis. 
142 
 
143 
2.3  
Statistical Analysis 
144 
To evaluate the extent of publication bias, a funnel plot of model residuals versus their 
145 
corresponding standard errors was inspected for evidence of asymmetrical scatter (72). This 
146 
approach takes into account any heterogeneity explained by the meta-regression, which is 
147 
not accounted for in standard funnel plots of observed effects vs. their standard errors. No 
148 
evidence of asymmetrical scatter was apparent (Figure 2).  
149 
A mixed effects meta-regression model was conducted using the ‘metafor’ package in R 
150 
(version 3.2.4, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (70). The overall 
151 
effect of SIT on V
̇ O2max was evaluated using the mean values of the covariates. The 
152 
modifying effects of covariates were evaluated as the difference between levels (e.g. 
153 
male/female) for nominal variables. For numeric variables, effects were evaluated as the 
154 
change in V
̇ O2max associated with a two standard deviation (SD) change in the predictor 
155 
(i.e. a typically low vs. a typically high value (32)), or a practically relevant value (e.g. three 
156 
additional SIT sessions would typically constitute an additional week of training). The 
157 
random effects in the model specified a between-study SD, representing the typical 
158 
difference in the true value of the effect in different study settings, plus a within-study 
159 
random effect to account for within-study repeated measurements (a control treatment 
160 
and/or more than one training treatment) (72). The SD was doubled before interpreting its 
161 
magnitude with the scale used to interpret fixed effects (63), for the same reason that the 
162 
magnitude of the effect of a linear covariate is evaluated with two SD of the covariate (32). 
163 
We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the inference relating to the 
164 
modifying effect of maximum number of sprints was substantially altered when two 
165 
potentially influential studies (with 12 and 15 maximum sprints, respectively (31, 61)) were 
166 
removed from the analysis. 
167 
 8 
 
We used magnitude-based inferences to provide an interpretation of the real-world 
168 
relevance of the outcomes. Uncertainty in effect estimates was expressed as ± 90% 
169 
confidence limits, and as the likelihood that the true value was beneficial, trivial, or harmful in 
170 
relation to threshold values for benefit (improved fitness) and harm (reduced fitness) (32). 
171 
The overall effect of SIT on V
̇ O2max was interpreted as a clinical outcome, whereby an 
172 
effect was deemed unclear if the chance that the true value was beneficial was >25%, with 
173 
odds of benefit relative to odds of harm (odds ratio) of <66. Modifying effects were evaluated 
174 
mechanistically and deemed unclear if the likelihood that the true value was beneficial and 
175 
harmful were both >5%. Otherwise, the effect was deemed clear, and was qualified with a 
176 
probabilistic term using the following scale: <0.5%, most unlikely; 0.5-5%, very unlikely; 5-
177 
25%, unlikely; 25-75%, possible; 75-95%, likely; 95-99.5%, very likely; >99.5%, most likely. 
178 
As robust anchors for the smallest worthwhile clinical and practical effects relating to 
179 
V
̇ O2max were not available, standardised effect thresholds of 0.2, 0.6 and 1.2 SD were 
180 
adopted for small, moderate and large effects, respectively (72). Here, the SD related to the 
181 
average between-subject variances for baseline V
̇ O2max; these corresponded to magnitude 
182 
thresholds of 1.0%, 2.9% and 5.8%.

RESULTS 
184 
 
185 
Data available for the 34 studies and 38 trials included in the meta-analysis are shown in 
186 
Table 1 and Figure 3. The meta-analysis indicated an overall likely large effect of an 
187 
‘average’ SIT protocol on V
̇ O2max (mean ± 90 CL % effect on the increase in V
̇ O2max: 7.8 ± 
188 
4.0%; Table 2). A possibly small effect was evident for the modifying effect of the maximum 
189 
number of sprint repetitions in a training session (-1.2 ± 0.8% decrease per 2 additional 
190 
sprint repetitions; Figure 4a). The percentage chances that the modifying effect was 
191 
negative, trivial or positive were calculated to be 62.7%, 37.3% and 0.0% respectively. There 
192 
were possibly small effects of baseline V
̇ O2max (-1.5 ± 1.9% decrease per 10 mL·kg-1·min-1 
193 
higher baseline V
̇ O2max; Figure 4b) and age (-1.1 ± 1.2% decrease per 7 y increase; 
194 
Figure 4c). All other modifying effects (intervention duration, number of sessions, sprint 
195 
duration, recovery time, sprint resistance, BMI, sex, and study type) were unclear or trivial 
196 
(Table 2). Unexplained variance between studies was 2.2 ± 0.8% (likely moderate). The 
197 
inference relating to the effect of maximum number of sprint repetitions was not altered when 
198 
the two studies with the highest number of sprint repetitions (31, 61) were removed from the 
199 
analysis (-1.0 ± 1.1%; possibly small decrease; chances that the modifying effect was 
200 
negative, trivial or positive of 51.6%, 48.2% and 0.0% respectively).

DISCUSSION 
202 
 
203 
The main aim of the present meta-analysis was to examine the modifying effect of the 
204 
number of sprint repetitions in a SIT session on the increase in V
̇ O2max following training. 
205 
Using data from 34 training studies and 418 participants we demonstrate that the 
206 
improvement in V
̇ O2max with SIT is not attenuated with fewer sprint repetitions, and possibly 
207 
even enhanced. Considering the low physical activity levels in the general population (25), 
208 
and the fact that lack of time is consistently identified as one of the main perceived barriers 
209 
to becoming and remaining physically active (37, 39, 68), this finding has implications for the 
210 
design of practical SIT interventions for improving general health. SIT protocols have the 
211 
potential to be the most time-efficient interventions that are associated with improvements in 
212 
key health markers, but due to the need for recovery intervals following sprints, this potential 
213 
can only truly be achieved if the number of sprint repetitions is low. Therefore, our 
214 
observation that reducing the number of sprint repetitions will not attenuate the increase in 
215 
V
̇ O2max associated with SIT, and in fact may possibly improve the effect, is an important 
216 
novel finding. 
217 
Based predominantly on the results of studies investigating the dose-response relationship 
218 
between regular aerobic exercise and improvements in health markers, it has generally been 
219 
accepted that at a given exercise intensity a greater volume of exercise training (in terms of 
220 
training duration and frequency) is associated with greater improvements in V
̇ O2max (20). 
221 
For example, in a clinical trial comparing low or high-intensity aerobic training protocols with 
222 
matched energy expenditure (Studies of a Targeted Risk Reduction Intervention through 
223 
Defined Exercise (STRRIDE I)) the magnitude of change in V
̇ O2max was greater in the 
224 
group exercising at a higher intensity (15). Although the volume of exercise used in HIIT and 
225 
SIT protocols is generally reduced compared to aerobic exercise programmes (11, 45, 60), 
226 
the principle of a dose-response relationship has not been challenged in these studies 
227 
directly; it is the interaction between training volume and intensity that is used to justify the 
228 
 11 
 
lower volume. Thus, HIIT and SIT studies investigating the effects of protocols with a lower 
229 
intensity or a shorter sprint duration tend to increase the number of sprint repetitions (43, 
230 
66). Apart from two studies that demonstrated that reducing sprint duration from 30 s to 
231 
either 15 s (74) or 10 s (30) does not attenuate the improvement in V
̇ O2max with SIT, there 
232 
have been no HIIT or SIT studies that have specifically investigated the dose-response 
233 
relationship between the volume of high-intensity exercise and health outcomes. Our meta-
234 
analysis provides the first evidence that at ‘all-out’ supramaximal exercise intensities the 
235 
generally accepted positive association between volume of training and magnitude of 
236 
training adaptations does not hold true. Thus, research into the health benefits of SIT should 
237 
increase the focus on protocols with fewer sprints.  
238 
Due to the relatively low number of studies examining the effects of SIT protocols with fewer 
239 
than six sprint repetitions, the present meta-analysis was not powerful enough to make 
240 
conclusions on the optimal number of all-out sprint repetitions. Only two studies have 
241 
investigated the effects of a SIT protocol incorporating just two sprints (48, 50). As one of 
242 
these used the largest sample size of all the studies included in the review (n=34 (50)), the 
243 
mean 10% increase in V
̇ O2max observed with this protocol (termed reduced-exertion high-
244 
intensity interval training, REHIT) appears to be robust. The greatest improvement in 
245 
absolute V
̇ O2max (17%) was reported by Gibala’s group (22), who modified the original 
246 
REHIT protocol to include a third sprint. However, the total duration of this intervention was 
247 
12 weeks, whereas at an intermediate measurement-point after 6 weeks the increase in 
248 
V
̇ O2max was 12%, very similar to the 10% and 14% improvements observed with the 
249 
original REHIT protocol (48, 50). Although future studies should determine whether the 
250 
magnitude of the response for V
̇ O2max is different between SIT protocols incorporating 2-4 
251 
sprints, the data presented in the present manuscript suggest that this difference will be 
252 
small. If this is indeed the case, then a number of considerations support the use of the 
253 
smallest number of sprints, i.e. the two sprints used in the REHIT protocol. Firstly, including 
254 
a warm-up, recovery, and cool-down, this protocol has the potential to be the most time-
255 
 12 
 
efficient protocol. Furthermore, a drawback of the use of SIT as a public health intervention 
256 
is the potential for high associated perceived exertion and negative affective responses (8, 
257 
21). In this light it is important to point out that the number of sprint repetitions has been 
258 
shown to negatively affect both of these parameters (19, 42). Therefore, effective SIT 
259 
protocols with fewer sprint repetitions will likely offer the best chance of sedentary target 
260 
populations taking up and adhering to a SIT intervention for improving health (18). With this 
261 
in mind, the available evidence suggests that two sprints can be recommended as effective 
262 
at improving the important health marker of V
̇ O2max. It could be argued that considering the 
263 
apparent linear association between the number of sprint repetitions and improvement in 
264 
V
̇ O2max (Figure 4a), a single sprint could be expected to produce similar improvements with 
265 
a lower time-commitment. However, we have recently performed the first study to investigate 
266 
the effects of a single supramaximal sprint on V
̇ O2max, and observed no significant increase 
267 
compared to a no-exercise control condition in response to 4 weeks of training with a sample 
268 
size of n=15 (64). Further studies are required to confirm whether supramaximal sprints only 
269 
improve V
̇ O2max if they are repeated. Furthermore, in light of the fact that the majority of 
270 
studies that have studied the effects of SIT protocols incorporating 2 or 3 sprint repetitions 
271 
have used 20-s sprints rather than the more commonly used 30-s sprints (22, 23, 48, 50), 
272 
further studies are required to investigate the shortest sprint duration that can be used 
273 
without attenuating the adaptations to V
̇ O2max. 
274 
Our present analysis does not provide an explanation for the possibly negative effect of 
275 
reducing the maximal number of sprint repetitions on improvements in V
̇ O2max, but a 
276 
discussion of possible mechanisms is warranted. The main limiting factor of V
̇ O2max is 
277 
generally assumed to be maximal cardiac output, possibly through increased blood volume 
278 
(7, 53). To date no studies have examined the effect of SIT on blood volume, but there is 
279 
evidence in favour (17, 71) and against (35) increases in blood volume in response to HIIT. 
280 
Similarly, there is evidence in favour (3) and against (45) increased maximal cardiac output 
281 
with SIT, with the latter finding suggesting that the adaptations to SIT for V
̇ O2max may be 
282 
 13 
 
peripheral in origin. Indeed, several authors have proposed that improvements in V
̇ O2max 
283 
with SIT are caused by improved skeletal muscle oxygen extraction due to increased 
284 
mitochondrial density (22, 35, 55, 62, 74). Although it remains unclear whether the 
285 
improvement in V
̇ O2max with SIT is due to central or peripheral adaptations, we propose 
286 
that both increased blood volume and increased mitochondrial density could plausibly be 
287 
explained by the rapid glycogen depletion associated with supramaximal exercise (49). 
288 
Firstly, maximal rates of glycogenolysis in the initial 15 seconds of a supramaximal sprint 
289 
(56) are associated with the accumulation of metabolic derivatives, resulting in a hypertonic 
290 
intramyocellular environment, influx of water, and a transient ~15-20% drop in plasma 
291 
volume within a timespan of just a few minutes (49). This severe disturbance of circulatory 
292 
homeostasis could be a stimulus for the body to increase blood volume in response to 
293 
repeated SIT sessions. Secondly, glycogenolysis is associated with the release and 
294 
activation of glycogen-bound 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (57), which through 
295 
downstream signalling pathways involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 
296 
coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α, a proposed master regulator of aerobic adaptations), could be 
297 
a mechanism leading to increased mitochondrial density (29). Glycogen breakdown during 
298 
repeated supramaximal sprints has been shown to be completely attenuated by the time of 
299 
the third sprint (56), and it is therefore plausible, for both of these speculated mechanisms, 
300 
that performing just two repeated supramaximal sprints is sufficient to ‘saturate’ (i.e. 
301 
maximally activate) the adaptive response. In other words, if either increased blood volume 
302 
or mitochondrial density underpins the changes in V
̇ O2max with SIT, and if rapid glycogen 
303 
breakdown regulates those adaptations, then no additional improvements would be 
304 
expected if more than 2-3 sprints are performed in a training session.  
305 
Apart from this hypothesis it is also possible that increasing the number of sprint repetitions 
306 
will result in ‘pacing’ strategies that affect the ‘all-out’ nature of the sprints (e.g. reduction of 
307 
peak and mean power output in initial sprints), or that accumulated fatigue may reduce the 
308 
effectiveness of later sprints. Furthermore, the fact that increasing the number of sprint 
309 
 14 
 
repetitions does not enhance the improvement in V
̇ O2max with SIT provides strong evidence 
310 
against a role for the magnitude of the acute effects of supramaximal sprints on oxygen 
311 
transfer, energy turnover, or total energy use, as part of the stimulus for improving V
̇ O2max 
312 
with SIT, because for each of these factors the stimulus should be greater with more sprint 
313 
repetitions. 
314 
A number of limitations to the present meta-analysis should be noted. Firstly, in order to be 
315 
of use as a practical intervention for preventing and/or treating inactivity-related chronic 
316 
disease, SIT interventions should also be effective at improving for example insulin 
317 
sensitivity and glycaemic control, blood pressure, blood lipid profile, and body composition. 
318 
Therefore, one limitation is that only V
̇ O2max was included as an outcome measure in the 
319 
present analysis. Whereas insufficient data for a meta-analysis is available for the effects of 
320 
SIT on blood pressure (14, 23, 73), blood lipid profile (4, 73), and body composition (66, 73), 
321 
the effect of SIT on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control has received more attention (4, 
322 
22, 23, 48, 50, 58, 73). However, the methods used to assess the effects of SIT on these 
323 
parameters have varied, with different studies using oral glucose tolerance tests (4, 48, 50, 
324 
73), intravenous glucose tolerance tests (22), euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps (58), or 
325 
continuous glucose monitoring (23). This means that a meta-analysis of the effects of the 
326 
number of sprint repetitions in a SIT protocol on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control is 
327 
also currently not feasible. Nonetheless, the improvements in insulin sensitivity and 
328 
glycaemic control observed to date with SIT protocols incorporating two (48) or three sprints 
329 
(22, 23) are encouraging.  
330 
Secondly, due to the number of available SIT studies the power of our meta-analysis is 
331 
insufficient to conclude with certainty that the modifying effect of the number of sprint 
332 
repetitions is negative; i.e. it remains possible that in reality performing more sprints will 
333 
result in the same improvements in V
̇ O2max (a chance of approximately 1 in 3). However, 
334 
this is not of major importance to the significance of our findings: even ‘no effect’ of the 
335 
number of sprint repetitions would lead to the logical conclusion that performing SIT 
336 
 15 
 
protocols with more than 2 or 3 sprints is unnecessary for improving V
̇ O2max in sedentary 
337 
individuals. Based on the present analysis, the chance that in reality the effect of performing 
338 
more sprints is positive was calculated as 0.0%.  
339 
A final limitation of our meta-analysis is that only SIT interventions using all-out intensities 
340 
were included. Optimising time-efficient interventions aimed at improving general health 
341 
requires consideration of various parameters, and exercise intensity is undoubtedly one of 
342 
the key parameters affecting the effectiveness of HIIT and SIT protocols. However, due to 
343 
the large range of intensities used in SIT and HIIT protocols (~80%-350% of V
̇ O2max) we felt 
344 
it was important to attempt to ‘control’ for this variable in the present analysis by including 
345 
only studies that used ‘all-out’ cycling exercise. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for 
346 
studies examining the effect of the number of sprint repetitions at lower exercise intensities, 
347 
e.g. in HIIT studies.  
348 
In conclusion, in the present meta-analysis we demonstrate that SIT is possibly more 
349 
effective at improving V
̇ O2max if fewer sprint repetitions are performed in a training session. 
350 
Considering the proclaimed aim of SIT to provide a time-efficient alternative / adjunct to high-
351 
volume moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, this finding has important implications for the 
352 
design of practical SIT interventions. We put forward that SIT research should move away 
353 
from further characterising the commonly used 4-7 x 30-s Wingate protocol, and towards 
354 
establishing acceptable and effective protocols. This will require more studies to examine the 
355 
modifying effects of a range of training parameters (including number of sprint repetitions, 
356 
sprint duration, sprint intensity, and training frequency) on adaptations to key health markers, 
357 
as well as exercise enjoyment and acceptability, perceived exertion, and the potential to 
358 
cause negative affective responses.

The reference condition is an intervention using 14 SIT sessions and a maximum of 7 repeated 30-s sprints with 
240 s recovery. Effects of SIT are presented as the % change compared to pre-training. *, indicates a practically 
relevant value was chosen to evaluate the effect magnitude; other numeric modifiers were evaluated as a 2 x 
SD change in the parameter. Abbreviations: BMI: body mass index, CL: confidence limits, SIT: sprint interval 
training, V
̇ O2max: maximal aerobic capacity.
