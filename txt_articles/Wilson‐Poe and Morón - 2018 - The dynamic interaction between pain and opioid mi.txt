ABSTRACT 
 
In 2014, drug overdose surpassed automobile accidents as the number one cause of accidental 
death for the first time in US history. The overdose epidemic is largely driven by opioids, and 
genuine prescription opioid analgesics play the biggest role in this phenomenon. Despite 
advancements in abuse deterrent formulations, prescription drug monitoring programs, and 
clinical assessments for the detection of abuse potential, drug overdoses continue to escalate. 
The CDC has recently issued new guidelines for opioid prescription, yet even these 
recommendations have their shortcomings. Furthermore, undertreated pain in patients with 
comorbid substance use disorder poses a major clinical challenge, particularly for patients on 
opioid replacement therapy. Despite the seemingly obvious interaction between the presence 
of pain and the abuse of pain-relieving opioids, there is surprisingly little mechanistic data to 
further our understanding of this vitally important topic. The need for novel pain 
interventions that minimize abuse liability is critical. Without a fundamental characterization 
of pain neurobiology, and the interaction between chronic pain and the brain’s reward system, 
we are unlikely to make progress in the alleviation of the opioid epidemic.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The opioid epidemic is one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century. In the United 
States, drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death, and the majority of these 
fatalities are due to opioids (Rudd, Seth, David & Scholl, 2016). The foundation of this 
epidemic was laid in the 1990s, in response to what was considered an epidemic in untreated 
pain. Pain was introduced as the “fifth vital sign,” and both professional and consumer 
interest groups advocated for the use of prescription opioid analgesics (POAs) to address the 
crisis of untreated pain (Campbell, 1995). The timely emergence of oxycodone on the 
prescription drug market facilitated the adoption of opioids as a first-line treatment, and 
initiated a highly competitive market for these drugs. POAs are undeniably useful in the 
treatment of acute pain. However, in light of the abuse and overdose epidemic, substantial 
controversy has arisen over opioids for chronic pain, and many health care providers are 
beginning to call into question their Hippocratic oaths. Modern clinical practice faces a huge 
challenge when it comes to meeting patients’ analgesic needs while minimizing their 
exposure to the adverse risks of opioids.  
 
At any given time, between 30 and 40% of the US population is experiencing either acute or 
chronic pain (Chou, 2009; Johannes, Le, Zhou, Johnston & Dworkin, 2010; Institute of 
Medicine, 2011; Tsang et al., 2008). Given these findings, it may not be surprising that there 
is a concurrent prevalence of legitimate opioid analgesic prescriptions, with this class of 
pharmaceuticals being prescribed more frequently than any other category of drugs (Paulozzi, 
Mack, Hockenberry, Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention & Control, 2014). 
Unfortunately, patients with diagnosed pain and a legitimate opioid prescription are 
particularly at risk for physical dependence, misuse, and transition to illicit opioids such as 
heroin (Ballantyne & Mao, 2003; Cicero, Ellis & Harney, 2015; Fishbain, Cole, Lewis, 
Rosomoff & Rosomoff, 2008; Hedegaard, Chen & Warner, 2015). It is also worth noting that 
60% of POA overdoses occur in patients with genuine prescriptions from a single doctor 
(Centers for Disease & Prevention, 2012). Together, these data suggest a substantial 
interaction between opioid misuse and the presence of ongoing pain. 
Much attention in the literature has been paid to pain as a pre-existing condition in opioid 
abuse and misuse (Fishbain, Cole, Lewis, Rosomoff & Rosomoff, 2008; Martell et al., 2007; 
Wasan et al., 2009). Pain is a trigger for self-medication, and is without question, a

significant risk factor for opioid misuse (Alford, German, Samet, Cheng, Lloyd-Travaglini & 
Saitz, 2016; Amari, Rehm, Goldner & Fischer, 2011). However, one of the challenges 
hindering our understanding of opioid risks in pain patients is the lack of consensus in the 
definition of terms such as misuse, problematic use, aberrant use, and abuse (Butler et al., 
2007; Chabal, Erjavec, Jacobson, Mariano & Chaney, 1997; Compton, Darakjian & Miotto, 
1998; Larance, Degenhardt, Lintzeris, Winstock & Mattick, 2011; Nikulina et al., 2016; 
Robinson, Gatchel, Polatin, Deschner, Noe & Gajraj, 2001). These assessment discrepancies 
may lead to clinician confusion and inconsistent patient treatment. Even when these 
assessments are used accurately, clinicians are often unable to predict abuse and addiction 
liability. For instance, chronic pain patients frequently develop tolerance and physical 
dependence, often in the absence of a Substance Use Disorder (SUD) diagnosis, yet still 
resort to aberrant behaviors such as dose escalation in order to control poorly alleviated pain 
(Back, Payne, Waldrop, Smith, Reeves & Brady, 2009). Even if there were universal 
agreement on the definitions of misuse and abuse, efforts to use self-report assessments to 
identify pain patients who may be at risk for opioid misuse have been ineffective (Chou R, 
2014). An important first step in adequately identifying opioid risk is the characterization of 
the neurobiological interaction between chronic pain and opioid use. Given the role of the 
brain’s reward circuitry in opioid addiction (Martin-Soelch et al., 2001; Ross & Peselow, 
2009), this circuit is an ideal target to study pain-induced vulnerability to opioid abuse risk. 
 
PAIN NEUROBIOLOGY AND REWARD  
The mesolimbic reward pathway has long been recognized for its role in motivated behavior. 
The two major players in this system are the forebrain nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the 
midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA). These structures have reciprocal connections; 
neurons in the VTA project rostrally to the NAc, where they release the neurotransmitter 
dopamine (DA), and inhibitory neurons in the NAc feed back onto the VTA by releasing 
GABA. Salient stimuli induce phasic burst firing of DA neurons in the VTA, and this firing is 
sufficient to produce motivated behavior such as reward seeking (Kim et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 
2009). Opioids, like other drugs of abuse, activate the structures within the mesolimbic 
reward pathway via 3 types of opioid receptors: mu, delta, and kappa. Binding of opioid 
agonists within this circuitry elicits the release of dopamine in the NAc. Activation of the mu 
opioid receptor (MOR) is largely responsible for encoding dopamine-dependent reward and

reinforcement, for both opioids and other reinforcers (Devine, Leone, Pocock & Wise, 1993; 
Giuliano, Robbins, Wille, Bullmore & Everitt, 2013; Le Merrer, Becker, Befort & Kieffer, 
2009; Xiao & Ye, 2008). In contrast to MOR activation, kappa opioid receptor (KOR) 
activation in this pathway blocks the rewarding effects of MOR agonists, leading to 
diminished DA transmission in the NAc (Ehrich et al., 2015; Niikura, Narita, Butelman, 
Kreek & Suzuki, 2010). These changes in DA transmission are likely to underlie the 
dysphoria and other negative side effects elicited by KOR activation (Al-Hasani et al., 2015; 
Donahue, Landino, Golden, Carroll, Russo & Carlezon, 2015; Land et al., 2009). Thus, 
endogenous and exogenous activation of MOR and KOR in the mesolimbic pathway seem to 
elicit a “push-and-pull” effect on reward and aversion. It is also worth noting that pain relief 
itself is rewarding, a phenomenon that is attributed to the activation of this system (Becker, 
Gandhi & Schweinhardt, 2012; Navratilova et al., 2012). 
Data from both human and animal studies indicates that chronic pain induces dramatic 
changes in the functionality of the reward system, both directly through diminished dopamine 
neurotransmission, and indirectly through dysregulation of the opioid receptor systems 
(Hipolito et al., 2015; Martikainen et al., 2015; Narita et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2015). 
During persistent inflammatory pain, MORs in this circuitry are desensitized, which may be 
due to a pain-induced increase in the release of endogenous opioid peptides (Schrepf et al., 
2016). There is also top-down management of these processes by the hippocampus, given the 
role this structure plays in the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior (Portugal et al., 2014). 
Pain-induced alterations in the reward pathway, including the altered value of reward and 
opioids (Loggia et al., 2014) could play a vital role in the vulnerability of patients to opioid 
misuse and abuse. Despite recent efforts to characterize pain-induced sensitivity to opioids, 
many unanswered questions remain. Although heroin abuse has recently been linked to 
several genetic polymorphisms (Hancock et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2016), these have not 
specifically been studied in pain patients. The identification of “abuse vulnerable” genetic 
markers or implementation of other biological screening tools would be of great utility, given 
the relative inadequacy of self-report and physician assessments of abuse liability (Chou 
2014).

PAIN AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER 
Treating chronic pain while avoiding abuse potential is particularly problematic for patients 
with a prior history of abuse. This is not a small problem, given that 5-17% of the US 
population has a diagnosed substance use disorder (SUD; SAMHSA, 2015; Warner, Kessler, 
Hughes, Anthony & Nelson, 1995). Unfortunately, nearly half of chronic pain patients with 
SUD diagnoses report that opioids, prescribed to relieve their pain, were the root cause of 
their disorder (Jamison, Kauffman & Katz, 2000). It is well established that prior substance 
abuse (including nicotine and alcohol) is a strong predictor of opioid misuse/abuse (Novy, 
Lam, Gritz, Hernandez, Driver & Koyyalagunta, 2012; Turk, Swanson & Gatchel, 2008). 
However, there is a significant risk of under-treating people with serious pain, particularly if 
the SUD diagnosis concerns opioids. In fact, 80% of methadone maintenance patients report 
recent pain, and 37% report chronic pain (Hser, Hoffman, Grella & Anglin, 2001; Prater, 
Zylstra & Miller, 2002; Rosenblum, Joseph, Fong, Kipnis, Cleland & Portenoy, 2003).  It is 
particularly this population that is at the most risk: the presence of pain creates a vicious 
downward spiral (Garland, Froeliger, Zeidan, Partin & Howard, 2013), where pain triggers 
hypervigilance and catastrophizing, leading to self-medication. The relative low cost and 
abundance of heroin (compared to POAs) is an important motivating factor when patients 
transition from POAs to illicit drugs (Cicero, Ellis & Harney, 2015). This cascade of events 
substantially increases the risk for abuse and overdose, given the unpredictable purity of 
illicit fentanyl and heroin (US Drug Enforcement Agency, 2016; Mars, Fessel, Bourgois, 
Montero, Karandinos & Ciccarone, 2015). A recent meta-analysis however (Dennis et al., 
2015), concluded that the presence of pain has no effect whatsoever on the consumption of 
illicit opioids. These discrepancies in the literature further highlight the need for mechanistic 
investigations into the neurobiology of opioid-treated pain in populations with prior opioid 
exposure. 
 
THE FUTURE OF OPIOID THERAPY 
Opioids are the most powerful analgesics known to man, and their continued use in the 
treatment of severe pain is inevitable. Blanket restriction of opioid therapy in pursuit of 
curbing the opioid abuse epidemic is not a desirable or realistic goal. What is clear however, 
is that opioid therapy of the future must look very different from how it does today. Although

the resolution of this crisis is a long way off, concerted efforts to address this issue are 
underway. In March of 2016, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) released a new of set 
opioid prescribing recommendations to guide general practitioners, who write the bulk of 
POA prescriptions. The three-prong approach by the CDC includes 1) using non-opioids for 
most cases of chronic pain, 2) when prescribing opioids, using the lowest effective dose, and 
3) ensuring that patients who are treated with opioids are closely monitored (Dowell, 
Haegerich & Chou, 2016).  
In line with the CDC’s first goal, much attention has returned to traditional non-opioid 
therapeutics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, 
or some combination of these (Wolkerstorfer, Handler & Buschmann, 2016), as well as early 
intervention with non-opioids to prevent pain chronicity entirely (ED Management, 2016). 
The development of novel non-opioid therapies is of great interest in academia and industry 
alike, and several classes of non-opioid drugs are in various stages of pre-clinical research 
and early stage clinical trials. For instance, the endocannabinoid system has received a great 
deal of attention as a novel analgesic target. A number of studies reliably demonstrate the 
analgesic efficacy of inhibiting enzymes that degrade endogenous cannabinoids (thereby 
enhancing endogenous cannabinoid activity), across a wide variety of pain states (Kinsey et 
al., 2009; Sakin et al., 2015; Wilkerson et al., 2017). Over the last decade, evidence for the 
efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for chronic pain management has also grown 
substantially. Two such approaches include cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness 
meditation practice. A recent meta-analysis of mindfulness for pain relief revealed that 
although pain intensity is not affected by this intervention, perceived pain control is 
significantly improved (Bawa et al., 2015). Recent advances in this field indicate that the 
neural mechanisms underlying the efficacy of mindfulness are distinct from those of placebo 
effects (Zeidan et al., 2015). A major drawback of psycho-behavioral pain management 
strategies however, is the relative inaccessibility of these interventions in rural areas, in 
which opioid use disorders have a particularly high prevalence (Dunn et al., 2016). 
Furthermore, these alternative approaches are also less likely to be covered by health 
insurance, creating a socio-economic disparity in non-pharmacological pain intervention 
(Harris, Cooper, Relton & Thomas, 2012). 
Novel opioid-based strategies have also received significant attention lately, consistent with 
the CDC’s second goal of using the lowest effective dose. For instance, adjunct therapies

such as cannabinoids are gaining notoriety because of their ability to produce synergistic 
analgesia and opioid sparing (Abrams, Couey, Shade, Kelly & Benowitz, 2011; Cox, Haller 
& Welch, 2007; Johnson, Lossignol, Burnell-Nugent & Fallon, 2013). Under this type of 
adjunctive therapy, tolerance and dose escalation can be prevented, and overall opioid 
consumption is substantially reduced (Haroutounian et al., 2016; Smith, Selley, Sim-Selley & 
Welch, 2007). Analgesic synergy has been observed across a wide variety of cannabinoid and 
opioid agonists, species, and administration routes (Cichewicz & McCarthy, 2003; Kazantzis, 
Casey, Seow, Mitchell & Vaughan, 2016; Roberts, Gennings & Shih, 2006). The mechanisms 
of this generalized synergy are not completely understood, although there are several points 
of cross-talk between these receptors including overlapping g-protein signaling cascades and 
possible hetero-dimerization (Scavone, Sterling & Van Bockstaele, 2013). Likewise, the 
mechanisms of opioid sparing remain to be elucidated, but are at least partially mediated by 
overall analgesic requirements, given the self-tapering nature of patients’ opioid dosing after 
the initiation of cannabis therapy (Boehnke, Litinas & Clauw, 2016; Haroutounian et al., 
2016). Peripherally-restricted opioid agonists are also undergoing intense investigation, 
because of their inability to produce adverse effects mediated by the central nervous system 
(Albert-Vartanian et al., 2016). Although this approach has great potential utility in clinical 
practice, to date there is only one peripherally restricted opioid undergoing Phase II clinical 
trials (kappa opioid receptor agonist JNJ-38488502; Olesen et al., 2013). Along similar lines, 
opioid receptor agonists with biased intracellular signaling properties are currently being 
explored for the potential to produce analgesia in the absence of undesirable side effects. For 
instance, the mu agonist PZM21 selectively activates Gi-coupled cascades without β arrestin 
recruitment, resulting in analgesia without respiratory depression, the development of 
tolerance, or abuse liability (Manglik et al., 2016). Although the promise of biased agonists is 
quite strong, there will be a substantial latency before these types of therapies move out of 
preclinical investigation. Finally, abuse deterrent formulations have been effective in limiting 
the abuse liability of specific prescription opioids such as Oxycontin. Unfortunately, this 
approach is also associated with the unintended consequence of diverting users to illicit 
opioid use, ultimately enhancing overdose mortality (Alpert, Powell & Pacula, 2017). 
Conversely, packaging interventions such as blister packs have consistently been shown to 
increase patient adherence and compliance to prescriptions, and in some countries, this is a 
federally mandated practice for opioids (Australian Government Department of Health, 2008; 
Conn, Ruppar, Chan, Dunbar-Jacob, Pepper & De Geest, 2015).

The CDC’s third recommendation, to closely monitor those who are prescribed opioids, 
places a significant burden on primary care physicians, who write the vast majority of opioid 
prescriptions. This is incredibly problematic, given that primary care physicians currently 
only have 13-16 minutes to spend with each patient, are inadequately educated about pain, 
and are already experiencing professional burnout on an epidemic scale (Doorenbos et al., 
2013; Peckham, 2016; West, Dyrbye, Erwin & Shanafelt, 2016). To relieve some of this 
burden, state-level prescription opioid monitoring systems have been implemented in 49 US 
states, and have successfully limited opioid diversion and inappropriate prescriptions 
(Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Center of Excellence at Brandeis, 2014; US 
Government Accountability Office, 2002). For example, in the state of Kentucky, after the 
implementation of a state wide monitoring program, the average time for law enforcement to 
investigate alleged “doctor shopping” dropped from 156 to 16 days. Unfortunately, there is 
conflicting evidence whether or not monitoring programs actually diminish emergency 
department overdoses or opioid deaths (Li, Brady, Lang, Giglio, Wunsch & DiMaggio, 2014; 
Maughan, Bachhuber, Mitra & Starrels, 2015; Patrick, Fry, Jones & Buntin, 2016; Paulozzi, 
Kilbourne & Desai, 2011). What these studies have clearly unveiled however, is that 
monitoring programs vary considerably from state to state, and it is only the most rigorous 
programs with near real-time data reporting that are the most effective at preventing overdose 
(Patrick, Fry, Jones & Buntin, 2016). Applying these rigorous principles to an integrated or 
federal drug monitoring program could potentially improve the efficacy of prescription 
monitoring and relieve some burden on primary care physicians. 
Despite the merit in the CDC’s recommendations for the prevention of opioid misuse, they do 
not address the problem of treating patients who already suffer from opioid use disorder. An 
accretion of evidence from the last two decades definitively supports simultaneous 
enrollment in opioid replacement therapy and structured psychosocial support programs for 
the treatment of opioid dependence (Copenhaver, Bruce & Altice, 2007; Kosten & O'Connor, 
2003; Montoya et al., 2005). Despite the compelling evidence for this approach and the 
prevalence of comorbid pain in this population, simultaneous pain management in this 
context has received little attention. However, emerging evidence strongly supports the 
efficacy of this type of psychotherapeutic pain management component in opioid use disorder 
treatment. Specifically, a comprehensive suite of approaches (including cognitive behavioral 
therapy, acceptance-based approaches, and messaging about the importance of avoiding 
substance abuse as a method of pain management) effectively lowers pain intensity and pain-

related function, compared to standard substance abuse treatment (Ilgen et al., 2016). Taken 
together, these data suggest that a multi-modal, concurrent approach to pain management and 
substance abuse treatment may be a highly efficacious approach to ameliorating these issues. 
Unfortunately, there are major barriers in the broad application of this approach. First, 
although any primary care physician can prescribe opioid analgesics, only a physician or 
psychiatrist with specialty training in addiction can prescribe opioid replacement therapy 
(FDA, 2006). This factor significantly contributes to the excess demand for opioid 
maintenance therapy and extensive waiting lists for maintenance programs (Gunderson, 
Levin, Rombone, Vosburg & Kleber, 2011). The delayed latency for patients to participate in 
these programs is significantly correlated with poor outcomes, including relapse and 
mortality (Ilgen et al., 2016; Peles, Schreiber & Adelson, 2013). One possible strategy to 
offset the pitfalls of treatment latency may be the use of digital health technologies (DHTs), 
such as smartphone or internet-based interventions. DHTs have consistently been shown to 
improve outcomes for tobacco and ethanol abuse, including in low-income populations 
(Keoleian, Polcin & Galloway, 2015; Muench, 2014; Tait & Christensen, 2010). These 
results, combined with the pervasive use of smartphone technology (Dahne & Lejuez, 2015), 
the potential for individualized treatment, and the cost effectiveness of digital health 
interventions strongly warrant the study of DHTs for opioid use disorder and comorbid pain. 
 
SUMMARY 
It is critical that we implement novel pain treatment strategies based on our collective 
knowledge of the failure of opioids in the treatment chronic pain. It would be 
counterproductive to follow the opioid crisis with a backlash against opioids, thus re-igniting 
the generational cycle of undertreated pain, followed by rampant analgesic prescription. It is 
very likely that the future of pain treatment will include personalized, precision, hybrid 
approaches that are based on the neurobiology of chronic pain. Without a fundamental 
understanding of pain-induced changes in the brain, and how these adaptations interact with 
subsequent analgesic drug exposure, we are merely fishing for effective solutions to the 
opioid crisis. Achieving this goal will take a large, concerted effort across hospitals and 
research institutions, and a significant, pain-targeted investment from funding agencies.
