ABSTRACT 
Background 
There is limited evidence on the health needs and service access among children and young 
people who are looked after by the State. The aim of this study was to compare dental treatment 
need and access to dental services (as an exemplar of wider health and wellbeing concerns) 
among children and young people who are looked after with the general child population. 
Methods  
Population data linkage study utilising: national datasets of social work referrals for “looked after” 
placements, the Scottish census of children in local authority schools, and NHS dental health and 
service datasets.    
Results 633204 children in publicly funded schools in Scotland during academic year 2011/12, of 
whom 10927 (1.7%) were known to be looked after during that or a previous (from 2007/08) year. 
The children in the LAC group were more likely to have urgent dental treatment need at 5-years of 
age: 23% vs 10% (n=209/16533), adjusted (for age, sex, and area socioeconomic deprivation) 
odds-ratio 2.65 (95%CI 2.30, 3.05); were less likely to attend a dentist regularly: 51% vs 63% 
(n=5519/388934), 0.55 (0.53, 0.58); and more likely to have teeth extracted under general 
anaesthetic: 9% vs 5% (n=967/30253), 1.91 (1.78, 2.04).  
Conclusions  
Looked after children are more likely to have dental treatment needs and less likely to access 
dental services even when accounting for sociodemographic factors. Greater efforts are required to 
integrate child social and health care for looked after children and to develop preventive care 
pathways upon entering and throughout their time in the care system.

What is already known on this subject 
 
Little is known internationally about health and access to healthcare and preventive care services, 
eg dental services, among looked after children at the population level. 
 
 
Small surveys have indicated that looked after children have high levels of mental and physical 
health needs. 
 
 
There are no studies that compare the oral health of looked after children with the general child 
population, or use national data linkage resources. 
 
What this study adds 
 
This is the first population-level analysis of dental endpoints and services comparing looked after 
children with the general child population. 
 
 
Looked after children have high levels of severe dental decay and tooth extraction under general 
anaesthesia, and low levels of access to preventive dental services. 
 
 
Unlike other studies we were able to identify that findings were not explained by socioeconomic 
factors, which is a confounder in existing research.

INTRODUCTION 
Over the period 2009-2014, approximately 16,000 children and young people have been looked 
after by the state in Scotland at any one time – less than 2% of 0-17 year olds. Looked After 
Children in Scotland are defined to be children and young people who are accommodated in foster, 
kinship and residential care placements, as well as those remaining with their families in 
compulsory home supervision. The latter group accounted for approximately 30% of all looked 
after children in 2014.[1]  
 
There is a recognised data deficit in the health, education, and employment outcomes for looked 
after children.[2]. A number of small observational studies have reported poorer health among 
looked after children than among their peers. [3-6] Much of the knowledge about the uptake of 
health services by looked after children comes from studies on mental health, and we know less 
about the uptake of interventions which prevent or treat common physical health problems.[7, 8] 
While oral health problems and dental service access have been recognised as issues among 
looked after children [9], the epidemiological research is limited. There is only one previous study 
from Scotland which looked at this issue: a survey of 96 young people in and leaving care 
placements which found that half the respondents hand not visited the dentist in the past year [7]. 
There are no population-wide studies which examine the oral health of looked after children and 
their use of preventive and hospital dental services compared with the general child population, nor 
studies that have utilised linkage of national data sources.[10] 
 
The oral health of Scotland’s children has long been a challenge. Despite significant 
improvements, such as free dental health checks for all children (including those in care), 32% of 5 
year olds and 27% of 11 year olds still experience dental decay with higher levels in children from 
the most deprived communities. [11, 12] Dental extraction – evidence of failure of dental preventive 
care – remains the most common reason for elective hospital admission for general anaesthesia 
among children in Scotland, accounting for over 7,500 episodes per year.[13] Dental health 
services are free at the point of access to all children in Scotland and 91% of the 0-17 year old 
population are registered with a General Dental Practitioner, however there are differences in use 
 5 
 
and type of treatment received by age, location, and socioeconomic circumstances.[14] Thus the 
importance of accounting for socioeconomic deprivation in analyses of oral health and dental 
service access in different population groups. Dental diseases are readily preventable, and it is 
widely recommended that all children access dental services on a “regular” basis for preventive 
care.[15] National Health Service (NHS) dental services are universally available in Scotland, and 
access to and uptake of preventive dental services can therefore be seen as a good example for 
access to healthcare services more generally.  
 
Here we aimed to compare dental treatment need and access to dental services among children 
and young people who are looked after with the general child population.  
 
METHODS 
Data sources 
Multiple datasets (Table 1, detailed descriptions in Appendix 1) were utilised: denominator data on 
all children in publicly funded school via ScotXed Pupil Census; looked after status and placement 
information via ScotXed Looked After Children (LAC) dataset;[16] NHS primary care dental data 
via the Management Information and Dental Accounting system (MIDAS); dental extractions under 
general anaesthesia via Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR01) hospital discharge dataset; and 
dental treatment needs of 5 / 11-year-olds via the National Dental Inspection Programme (NDIP). 
Details of the record linkage methods are also supplied in Appendix 1. Approval via a number of 
ethical and information governance procedures was successfully achieved (Appendix 2).

Creation of the study groups 
The ScotXed LAC dataset included children with an open looked-after episode during the 12 month 
period to 31st July 2012. Secondly, it also held reliable retrospective looked after children data on 
these children starting from 2007/08 (i.e. from August 2007). All of these children included in the 
2011/12 Pupil Census (and therefore only school-age) were included in the looked after children 
“LAC group”. The children who were not identified as being in the LAC group were consigned to 
the comparator “Non-LAC” group.   
 
Data processing and analysis 
The datasets were pre-linked using bespoke linkage techniques and stored in the National Safe 
Haven,[17] and each dataset included an anonymous study identifier for each child. The study 
cohort was created from the underlying school census dataset and subdivided into the LAC group 
and the Non-LAC group. Age, sex and small area socioeconomic status as measured by the 
Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD 2011) were provided at the time of the school census. 
SIMD is scored with five categories (fifths of the population), with ‘1’ representing the most 
deprived areas and ‘5’ for the most affluent areas. The children in the LAC group were 
characterised by the number of placements they received and the location of the most recent 
placement. The placement locations were pooled into the following categories for the analyses: at 
home with a parent or parents, with friends or relatives such as grandparents (i.e. kinship care); in 
foster care; or in a residential unit (group home).  
 
Dental extractions under general anaesthesia were defined using the appropriate procedure and 
diagnostic codes from the hospital in-patient episode file (SMR01). Attendance at primary care 
 7 
 
dental services was recorded in each of the five years 2009-2013. Dental inspections are carried 
out in the first and last years of primary school education, however, this arrangement does not 
provide a perfect contemporaneous link with all of the children in the school census. We therefore 
restricted the analyses to those children aged 5-years (P1) and those aged 11-years (P7) in any of 
the study years. Dental treatment need was identified by the follow-up letters sent to parents after 
the inspections (specified as urgent, non-urgent, not needed, see Appendix 1).  
 
All comparisons of the LAC group with the Non-LAC group were analysed both univariately and 
with adjustment for age, sex and SIMD, using logistic regression. We also compared the most 
recent placement locations within the LAC group as a priori sub-group analyses, and investigated 
dental outcomes by placement type.  
 
RESULTS 
There were 670952 children included in the 2011/12 pupil census. Of these, 10009 and 1757 
respectively (totalling 11766, 1.8%) were known to be currently or recently looked after. Of these, 
9409 and 1674 respectively (totalling 11083, 1.5%) were linked to the CHI database. Only children 
with good linkages were included, some duplicate records were deleted, and children with an 
unknown SIMD category were removed. The final numbers for analysis were 10924 for the 
currently or recently looked after LAC group, and 622280 for the other children in the comparator 
Non-LAC group. Most children were placed ‘at home’ (n=4992/46%), a smaller number were 
placed ‘away from home’ with foster carers (n=2686/25%), friends/other relatives (n=2448/22%) 
and 7% (n=798) were placed in residential care. The age of the children in the master cohort 
ranged from 4-17 years old with a mean of 11.7 years in the LAC group and 10.3 years in the Non-
LAC group, and 53% (n=5815) and 51% (n=316719) were male in the two groups, respectively 
(Table 2). There was a greater proportion of children in the most deprived SIMD fifth of the 
population in the LAC group (n=4548/42%) compared with the Non-LAC group (n=129741/21%).

* LAC = Looked After Children 
 
A lower proportion of children in the LAC group regularly attended dental services, 51% vs 63% 
(n=5519/388934), with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.55 (0.53-0.58) (Table 3). As the sample 
size is very large all of the reported analyses from this project have small p-values (p<0.001). 
There was a greater proportion with recent dental extractions under general anaesthetic in the LAC 
group (9%, n=967) than the Non-LAC group (5%, n=30253), with an OR of 1.91 (1.78 to 2.04). This 
result varied by socioeconomic status with an unadjusted OR of 1.21 (1.09 to 1.34) for the most 
deprived SIMD fifth, and an unadjusted OR of 3.12 (2.30 to 4.23) for the least deprived SIMD fifth 
 9 
 
(due to a relatively larger drop in extractions in the non LAC group for the more affluent SIMD 
subgroups).

* LAC = Looked After Children. ** Regular Attendance = attended dental services in all five study

Despite smaller numbers in the LAC group there was still a noticeable difference in urgent and 
non-urgent dental treatment need between the groups in primary one children (age five), 67% 
(n=595) vs 36% (n=61789), with an OR of 2.65 (2.30-3.05) (Table 3). There was a greater 
proportion in the older primary seven (age 11) linkage that covers more contemporaneous children, 
namely 3221 (75%) and 115987 (58%) in the LAC and Non-LAC groups, respectively, with an OR 
for any treatment need (urgent and non-urgent) of 1.79 (1.67-1.92). The results were even more 
pronounced for urgent dental treatment need, with an OR 2.35 (2.08-2.65) for the LAC relative to 
Non-LAC group.  
 
LAC Group subgroup analyses 
The LAC group were sub-divided by number of placements and described by placement type 
(Table 4), with roughly equal mean ages for the grouping of the number of placements (range 11.5 
to 11.9 years old). Of the LAC children in the most deprived areas (SIMD1), 46% (n=3220) had 
one placement, and 28% (n=304) had four or more placements.

Recent regular attendance at dental services was lowest for placements at home (45%, n=2266), 
intermediate for kinship placements (53%, n=1303), and highest for foster placements (57%, 
n=1527) (Table 5). Tooth extractions under general anaesthesia varied from 6.5% (n=52) for 
residential placements to 10.3% (n=252) for kinship placements. Treatment need (urgent and non-
urgent combined) from the P7 (age 11) inspection was found in 78% (n=1471) with home 
placements, 77% (n=789) with kinship placements, 71% (n=174) in residential placements, and 
69% (n=787) with foster carers; which also contrasts with 58% (115987) among the Non-LAC 
group.

* LAC = Looked After Children ** Regular Attendance = attended dental services in all five study 
years. NDIP = National Dental Inspection Programme. The analyses are restricted to those with 
inspection data and age group restrictions, namely age 4-8 for the ‘age 5’ NDIP and 9-14 for the 
‘age 11’ NDIP. 
 
DISCUSSION  
We created the first study successfully linking data across the social care, education, and health 
sectors to systematically compare health and access to health services in looked after and non 
looked after school age children in Scotland. Looked after children have higher treatment needs 
and poorer access to dental health services (including preventive care) than children in the general 
population. We found that looked after children have double the rates of urgent dental treatment 
need (severe dental decay experience or dental abscess), were half as likely to regularly attend 
dental services, and were nearly twice as likely to have had teeth extracted under general 
anaesthetic than the general child population. These results prevailed after adjustment for age, 
sex, and socioeconomic status. Childhood dental treatment need – particularly when urgent 
(severe dental decay or associated with an abscess), or requiring dental extraction under general 
anaesthesia – is an early marker of poor physical health.[18] Moreover, since dental decay is 
readily preventable it is a marker of failure of care or of preventive care services or sub-optimal use 
of  such services.  
 
Utilising and linking large national routine administrative datasets is a strength of this study. 
However, there are some limitations – including a number of potential linkage issues, whereby 
 13 
 
incomplete linkage could mean that some children within the 2011/12 pupil census who were LAC 
have been misclassified as non-LAC. The potential for incomplete linkage, does not seem to have 
been a major problem (Appendix 1). We identified 1.5% children in the 2011/12 pupil census as 
LAC which is similar to the 1.6% of the school aged population classified as LAC in the published 
national statistics.[1] Given our focus on school age children, we do not have the complete history 
of contact with the care system prior to starting school. This includes children in the general child 
population, some of whom may have had contact with the care system prior to starting school, or 
(for older children) in earlier school years. The population of LAC is subject to considerable flux. 
Approximately 3000 school-age children start and cease to be looked after each year.[1] In our 
analysis, the Non-LAC group is nearly 60 times larger, and the impact of having current or previous 
LAC children in the Non-LAC group would likely have had minimal influence on the findings.    
 
The main caution in interpretation of findings is associated with the temporal relationships of the 
data. In effect, we have cross-sectional data for when the children were looked after, linked to 
recent dental inspection and dental service / treatment history. Thus, we have been unable to 
disentangle whether the dental health and access to services issues in LAC are related to the 
factors that led to the children becoming looked after in the first place or whether the State is failing 
to fully look after these children. 
 
The study adds to the international evidence in two ways. First, we developed innovative linkage 
methods to successfully link large national administrative datasets from social care to health 
services to investigate health and service access of looked after children. Second, while our study 
confirms findings of previous smaller and ad hoc reports, [7, 8, 9] we were able to identify that 
dental treatment needs, infrequent use of dental services, and extractions under general 
anaesthesia among looked after children are not explained by socioeconomic factors, which is a 
confounder in existing studies.[4] However, there may be other confounding factors, for example, 
comorbidities or disabilities which may also more prevalent among looked after children. In the 
future, as data on care histories improve and more data points become available, a cohort study 
 14 
 
design could overcome the limitations of this cross-sectional design and investigate the impact of 
LAC placements on health over time.  
 
There is a policy recommendation in Scotland that all children who become looked after (including 
looked after at home) should have a health assessment, which should also include a dental 
assessment and checking they are registered with a dentist, within four weeks.[19] However, no 
data from these local assessments is returned centrally to the NHS Information Services Division 
hence we could not include it in our analysis. It is our understanding that dental assessments and 
pathways into care vary by both Health Board and placement location. Moreover, the national oral 
health improvement programme for Scotland (Childsmile) has been established which has 
reorientated child dental services towards prevention,[20] but thus far it has not been particularly 
focused on looked after children. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
We have been able to link data from social and health sectors. School-age looked after children 
have a history of greater dental health needs and higher levels of hospital admissions for dental 
extractions, and poorer levels of access to regular dental services where preventive dental care is 
delivered (and even in a Scottish context where preventive dental care is freely available to all). 
Cross-sectoral working is essential to develop care pathways to meet the dental needs and 
improve the healthcare for looked after children.

Dataset Descriptions & Record Linkage Details 
 
Dataset Descriptions 
 
- ScotXed School Pupil Census  – the annual census of children in local authority primary and 
secondary schools, which provided the identifiers for indexing, and also provided the denominator 
for the cohort. The characteristics of the available children included: local authority of residence, 
child’s age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic circumstances. The date of the census was 20th 
September 2011. Note that the Scottish Exchange of Data, ScotXed, is a department of the 
Scottish Government that facilitates data projects for children and young people. 
http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/ScotXed 
 
- ScotXed Looked After Children (LAC) dataset – this identified looked after children and their 
characteristics including: local authority, accommodation, legal reason, and full looked-after 
episodes dating from 1st August 2007 – 31st July 2012.  
 
- Management Information and Dental Accounting system (MIDAS) – this provided individual level 
data on patient registration with a primary care NHS dentist and treatment details to indicate levels 
of dental service access, dating from the years 2008/9 to 2012/13 ending in March 2013. This 
dataset includes both salaried and non-salaried General Dental Services (GDS). 
 
- Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR01) hospital discharge dataset – this provided dental specialty 
continuous inpatient stays by diagnosis and procedure codes to specify dental extractions to 
assess the level of failure of dental preventive care, dating from the years 2008/9 to 2012/13 year 
ending on the 31st July 2013. 
 
- National Dental Inspection Programme (NDIP) – this provided individual-level data on the dental 
treatment needs of children in the Primary 1 school year (P1) aged approximately 5-years-old and 
 2 
 
in Primary 7 (P7) aged approximately 11-years-old. NDIP is collected annually and we accessed 
the years 2008/9 to 2012/13 ending in the 31st July 2013. The Basic Inspection involves a simple 
assessment of the mouth of each child using a light, mirror and ball-ended probe. Each child is 
placed into one of three categories depending on the level of dental health and a letter sent to their 
parents. Letter A (Urgent dental needs) – severe dental decay and/or abscess and should seek 
immediate dental care; or Letter B (Non-urgent dental needs) – some decay experience and 
should seek dental care in the near future; or Letter C (Low dental needs) – no obvious decay but 
should continue to see the family dentist on a regular basis. If a child refuses an inspection or is 
absent on the day of inspection the data is recorded with an ‘X’. 
 
Record Linkage Details 
 
As part of the wider project leading to the results reported in this paper, our team linked looked 
after child, education, and health records for the first time in Scotland. In short the linkage process 
was as follows. Scottish Candidate Numbers (SCN, a unique personal identifier used on all 
education and relevant social care records in Scotland) which are recorded on looked after child 
records, were deterministically matched to SCNs recorded on the pupil census (annual census of 
all children in state funded education in Scotland) to categorise children included in the census as 
looked after or not.   
 
Personal identifiers contained within the pupil census for all children (pupil date of birth, gender, 
and home postcode) were then probabilistically matched to the Community Health Index database 
(master index of all patients receiving NHS care in Scotland, including the NHS unique patient 
identifier, the CHI number) to generate a SCN-CHI number key. CHI numbers are recorded on all 
routine health records in Scotland hence the linked CHI numbers were then used to identify 
relevant health records (dental health, dentist attendance, in-patient dental extractions) for looked 
after and not looked after children.  
 3 
 
 
Our full study cohort comprises children included in the pupil census (census of children in state 
funded education) in academic year 2011/12. Children were classified as currently looked after if 
their Scottish Candidate Number was recorded on a looked after child record during academic year 
2011/12. Children were classified as previously looked after if their Scottish Candidate Number had 
been recorded on a looked after child record during the academic years 2007/08-2010/11 (but not 
2011/12). Children were classified as not looked after if their Scottish Candidate Number was not 
recorded on any looked after child records for academic years 2007/08-2011/12. 
 
Detailed assessment of the quality of data linkage achieved showed that there is a degree of 
under-recording of the SCN on looked after child records, hence a small number of looked after 
children in the pupil census will erroneously be classified as not looked after. This would tend to 
conservatively bias results comparing looked after and not looked after children to the null.  
Linkage to the CHI database for children within the pupil census classified as looked after and not 
looked after is very high (around 95%), with minimal potential for bias due to non-linkage.  
Furthermore, previous work by our team has shown that links made are highly likely (>99%) to be 
correct (see Wood R, Clark D, King A, Mackay D, Pell J. Novel cross-sectoral linkage of routine 
health and education data at an all-Scotland level: a feasibility study. Lancet 2013; 382: S10).  As 
CHI numbers are universally required on all routine NHS records, once a link to a child’s CHI 
number is made, it is assumed that relevant health records will be identified if present. 
 
We are therefore confident that our results provide a robust, population based view of the dental 
health of looked after children compared to their non-looked after peers.
