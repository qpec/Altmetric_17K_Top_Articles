In Brief
Dendritic and synaptic development are
important for brain function, and these
events are disrupted in individuals with
neurodevelopmental disorders. Kwan
et al. show that MARK1-dependent
phosphorylation of DIXDC1 regulates
cortical neuron dendrite and spine
morphogenesis through a cytoskeletal
pathway that is disrupted by rare genetic
variants identified in autism cohorts.

SUMMARY
The development of neural connectivity is essential
for brain function, and disruption of this process is
associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).
DIX domain containing 1 (DIXDC1) has previously
been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders,
but its role in postnatal brain function remains
unknown. Using a knockout mouse model, we deter-
mined that DIXDC1 is a regulator of excitatory neuron
dendrite development and synapse function in the
cortex. We discovered that MARK1, previously
linked to ASDs, phosphorylates DIXDC1 to regulate
dendrite and spine development through modula-
tion of the cytoskeletal network in an isoform-spe-
cific manner. Finally, rare missense variants in
DIXDC1 were identified in ASD patient cohorts via
genetic sequencing. Interestingly, the variants inhibit
DIXDC1 isoform 1 phosphorylation, causing im-
pairment to dendrite and spine growth. These data
reveal that DIXDC1 is a regulator of cortical dendrite
and synaptic development and provide mechanistic
insight into morphological defects associated with
neurodevelopmental disorders.
INTRODUCTION
Dendritic spines are the primary sites of excitatory synaptic in-
puts and are necessary for cognitive function (Ebert and Green-
berg, 2013; Jeste and Geschwind, 2014; Penzes et al., 2011).
The importance of spines is revealed by their disruption in indi-
viduals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (Tang et al.,
2014) and the identification of ASD-linked mutations in synaptic
genes (Chen et al., 2015; De Rubeis et al., 2014; Geschwind and
State, 2015; Iossifov et al., 2014). One mechanism that causes
synaptic dysfunction in disease is disruption of the cytoskeletal
network (De Rubeis et al., 2013; Dolan et al., 2013; Duffney
et al., 2013; Durand et al., 2012; Han et al., 2013; Hori et al.,
2014), which includes abnormalities in actin and tubulin dy-
namics (De Rubeis et al., 2013; Gu et al., 2010; Lei et al., 2016;
Muhia et al., 2016; Murakoshi et al., 2011; Um et al., 2014; Wool-
frey and Srivastava, 2016). Interestingly, cytoskeleton-based
synaptic defects in ASD mouse models can be pharmacologi-
cally reversed, suggesting a potential therapy (Dolan et al.,
2013; Duffney et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2013).
Wingless (Wnt) signaling has also been linked to ASDs and
psychiatric disorders (Cao et al., 2016; Kalkman, 2012; Krumm
et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2013; Okerlund and Cheyette, 2011).
Mouse model and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)
studies have demonstrated that altered Wnt signaling causes
disease phenotypes (Brennand et al., 2011; Fang et al., 2014;
Mohn et al., 2014; Okerlund et al., 2010; Sowers et al., 2013;
Srikanth et al., 2015; Topol et al., 2015). The Wnt and synaptic
pathways also intersect and include molecules, such as Dish-
eveled-1, Dact1, b-catenin, DISC1, Ankyrin G, and APC, indi-
cating that Wnt molecules have important roles at the synapse
(Ciani et al., 2015; Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2010, 2014; Mao
et al., 2009; Okerlund et al., 2010; Sowers et al., 2013; Srikanth
et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2014).
The link between Wnt signaling and ASDs prompted us to
study whether DIXDC1 regulates the development of neural con-
nectivity. DIXDC1 regulates embryonic neural progenitor cell
proliferation and cerebellar axonal growth (Ikeuchi et al., 2009;
Shiomi et al., 2003, 2005; Singh et al., 2010; Soma et al.,
2006), but there is no known role for DIXDC1 in postnatal cortical
development. DIXDC1 has been linked to psychiatric disorders
(Singh et al., 2010), and a Dixdc1 knockout (KO) mouse model
displays behavioral deficits (Kivima
¨ e et al., 2011). DIXDC1 can
be phosphorylated and recruited to focal adhesions by microtu-
bule-associated protein (MAP)/microtubule affinity-regulating

 kinase 1 (MARK1) in human osteosarcoma cell lines (Goodwin
et al., 2014), suggesting that DIXDC1 could regulate the cyto-
skeleton in neurons. Interestingly, MARK1 regulates hippocam-
pal synaptic growth (Wu et al., 2012) and has been linked to
ASDs (Maussion et al., 2008), suggesting it might partner with
DIXDC1 to regulate synaptic development.
Given these observations, we explored whether DIXDC1 reg-
ulates postnatal cerebral cortex development. We found phos-
phorylation of DIXDC1 isoforms 1 and 2 by MARK1 is required
for dendrite and spine growth; however, the modulation of the
neuronal cytoskeleton was specifically mediated by DIXDC1
isoform 1. We also identified inherited, rare missense variants
in DIXDC1 from genetic sequencing of ASD patient cohorts
and discovered they reduce phosphorylation of DIXDC1 iso-
form 1 and impair neuronal morphology. Our data reveal that
MARK1-DIXDC1 signaling is a critical regulator of dendrite and
synaptic development and outline how rare genetic variants in
DIXDC1 may contribute to altered neuronal morphology during
brain development.
RESULTS
Expression of DIXDC1 in Neurons
The embryonic expression of DIXDC1 in the brain has been
previously described (Shiomi et al., 2003, 2005; Singh et al.,
2010). Therefore, we probed brain lysates from multiple ages
for DIXDC1 isoforms 1 and 2 (Figure 1A) and found that both iso-
forms are expressed postnatally (Figure 1B). We also stained
14 days in vitro (DIV14) cultured cortical neurons and found
that DIXDC1 is expressed in MAP2-positive dendrites (Figure 1C)
and partially co-localizes with postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95)
(Figure 1D). Biochemical isolation of the postsynaptic density
(PSD) also revealed that both DIXDC1 isoforms are present (Fig-
ure 1E). Finally, we tagged each DIXDC1 isoform with GFP and
found that both isoforms are expressed in dendrites and spines
(Figures 1F and 1G) and both partially co-localize with PSD95
(Figure 1G). Together, these data indicate that both isoforms
localize to dendrites and spines and may regulate neuronal
morphogenesis.

 Dixdc1 KO Mice Have Defects in Dendrite and Spine
Development
To study DIXDC1, we obtained a complete Dixdc1 KO mouse
(Figures 3E and S1A). Assessment of cortical structure using a
layer-specific marker revealed no gross differences (Fig-
ure S1B). In 4-week-old KO mice, we determined that layer
2/3 somatosensory cortical pyramidal neurons had signifi-
cantly reduced dendrite complexity compared to WT (Fig-
ure 2A). To corroborate these data, we cultured Dixdc1 KO
neurons
and
found
a
significant
reduction
in
dendrite
complexity (Figure 4A). As a control, we acutely knocked
down Dixdc1 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) both in vivo
and in vitro and found a significant reduction in dendrite
complexity (Figures S2A–S2C), which was rescued by an
shRNA-resistant human DIXDC1 (Figure S2D). These studies
suggest that DIXDC1 is required for dendrite growth in a
cell-autonomous fashion.
Given the expression of DIXDC1 isoforms at the PSD, we
postulated DIXDC1 regulates spine structure. We imaged spines
in P28 layer 2/3 cortical neurons from KO mice and found a
modest but significant reduction in spine density compared to
WT (Figure 2B). Additional analysis showed a decrease in spine
head width and length in KO mice (Figure 2C). In vitro experi-
ments confirmed that KO neurons had significantly reduced
spine density but no changes in thin spines (Figure 4B). Further-
more, acute knockdown of Dixdc1 in vitro and in vivo revealed

 a significant decrease in spine density, which was rescued
by shRNA-resistant human DIXDC1 (Figures S2E–S2G). We
included an additional control experiment and knocked down
Dixdc1 after dendrite growth, which also revealed a decrease
in spine density, indicating that DIXDC1 specifically regulates
spine structure (Figure S2H).
DIXDC1 Regulates the Development of Synaptic
Connectivity and Function
Considering the reductions in dendritic complexity, spine density,
and spine size in Dixdc1 KO mice, we examined whether this
altered synapse activity, using electrophysiology. We recorded
from layer 2/3 cortical neurons within the somatosensory cortex
(Figure2D)andobservedasignificantreductioninminiatureexcit-
atory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency in KO animals
compared to WT controls (Figure 2E). Despite a trend toward a
reductioninspinesizeinKOneurons,therewerenosignificantdif-
ferences in mEPSC amplitude (Figure 2E). Given these data, we
also examined the morphological development of synapses using
the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. Quantification revealed
that reducing DIXDC1 expression significantly reduced synapto-
physin puncta density (Figure S3A). Lastly, we measured in vitro
neural connectivity using a genetically encoded rabies virus that
allows fluorescent visualization of monosynaptic connections
(Garcia et al., 2012). Using this assay, we found that individual
neurons lacking DIXDC1 had a reduced number of monosynaptic
connections with neighboring neurons (Figure S3B). Taken
together, these multiple lines of investigation suggest DIXDC1 is
required for synaptic connectivity and function.
MARK1 Phosphorylates DIXDC1 in the Brain
Our data indicate that DIXDC1 regulates dendrite and synapse
formation; however, the mechanism(s) involved are unknown.
MARK1 phosphorylates DIXDC1 isoform 1, which causes local-
ization to actin-rich focal adhesions in cell lines (Figure 3A;
Goodwin et al., 2014), suggesting the possibility that DIXDC1
regulates the cytoskeleton in neurons. We first tested the
expression pattern of MARK1 in the brain and found its develop-
mental profile is similar to DIXDC1 (Figure 3B). We also found
that MARK1 co-localizes with DIXDC1 in dendrites (Figure 3C)
and was enriched in the PSD (Figure 3D), indicating that
MARK1 could phosphorylate DIXDC1.
To test this, we expressed MARK1-wild-type (WT) with
hDIXDC1-WT isoform 1 or isoform 2 in HEK293 cells and found
robust phosphorylation of both DIXDC1 isoforms (Figures 3F
and 3G), which was inhibited by a substitution of serine-592 to
alanine (S592A) in isoform 1 or a S381A mutation in isoform 2
(Figures 3F and 3G). Next, we examined whether either DIXDC1
isoform was endogenously phosphorylated in vivo. We probed
mouse brain lysate and found that both DIXDC1 isoforms are
phosphorylated, which was eliminated in the KO mouse (Fig-
ure 3E). These data demonstrate that MARK1 phosphorylates
both DIXDC1 isoforms in the brain.
Phosphorylation of DIXDC1 Is Required for Dendrite and
Spine Growth
Given that MARK1 phosphorylates DIXDC1, we asked whether
this regulates dendrite and spine growth. First, we co-trans-
fected WT cultured neurons with GFP and a specific isoform of
DIXDC1. We found that WT hDIXDC1 isoforms 1 and 2 both indi-
vidually increased dendrite branching (Figure S4A) and spine
density (Figure S4B). We also tested mouse Dixdc1 (isoform 1)
and found the same effect (Figures S4C and S4D). We next ex-
pressed each DIXDC1 isoform in KO neurons and determined
that expression of either isoform significantly increases (rescues)
dendrite growth and spine formation (Figures 4C–4F). These
data imply that both DIXDC1 isoforms play a prominent role in
dendrite and spine growth.
To determine the role of MARK1 phosphorylation of DIXDC1 in
dendrite and spine formation, we expressed phospho-mutant
versions of each isoform into cultured Dixdc1 KO neurons. Over-
expression of hDIXDC1-S592A (isoform 1) or hDIXDC1-S381A
(isoform 2) did not increase dendrite growth or spine density in
KO cultures (Figures 4C–4F). This suggests that phosphorylation
is required for dendrite growth and spine formation. Next, we ex-
pressed both phospho-dead isoforms of DIXDC1 in the WT
background to determine whether they possess dominant-nega-
tive activity. For isoform 1, hDIXDC1-S592A did not function
similar to hDIXDC1-WT and caused a decrease in dendrite
branching even compared to controls, whereas spine density
was not significantly different than WT isoform 1 (Figures S5A
and S5C). For isoform 2, the phospho-mutant (S381A) did not
increase dendrite growth or spine density compared to WT
and was similar to GFP controls (Figures S5B and S5D). This in-
dicates phospho-dead isoform 1, but not isoform 2, possesses
some dominant-negative activity. As a control, we found no
gross differences in expression of the mutants (Figure S6A).
We also examined whether phosphorylation of DIXDC1 was
important for its localization in dendrites and spines. Cultured
cortical
neurons
showed
co-localization
of
GFP-tagged
hDIXDC1-WT (isoforms 1 and 2) with PSD95 in the dendritic
spines (Figures 4G and 4H). However, the hDIXDC1-S592A
and -S381A phospho-mutants both exhibited a decrease in
PSD95 co-localization, indicating DIXDC1 localization to spines
was disrupted (Figures 4G and 4H). These results strongly indi-
cate that phosphorylation of both DIXDC1 isoforms is critical
for cortical dendrite and synapse formation.
Phosphorylation of DIXDC1 Regulates Actin and
Microtubule Cytoskeletal Dynamics
Previous studies suggest that DIXDC1 may directly impact the
cytoskeleton, which could influence dendrite and spine growth
(Capelluto et al., 2002; Singh et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2006).
We first examined actin integrity in vivo and found that Dixdc1
KO brains had a significant reduction in the F-/G-actin ratio (Fig-
ure 5A). We next analyzed the levels of proteins that regulate
actin polymerization and observed a significant decrease in
Rac1-GTP activity, but not Rho-GTP levels in KO brains (Fig-
ure 5B). We also found a significant reduction in the Wiskott-Al-
drich syndrome proteins WAVE-2, N-WASP, as well as Profilin-1
(Figure 5C). These observations suggest that DIXDC1 regulates
actin polymerization in the brain. To investigate whether a defect
in actin polymerization causes the spine phenotype in Dixdc1 KO
neurons, we enhanced actin polymerization using Jasplakinolide
(JPK) (Reinhard et al., 2016). We found that JPK significantly
increased dendritic spine density in KO cultures to levels similar
Cell Reports 17, 1892–1904, November 8, 2016
1895
 to WT cultures treated with JPK (Figure 5D). Importantly, JPK
treatment decreased the proportion of thin spines, suggesting
that it increases the number of mature, functional spines.
We next explored whether phosphorylation of DIXDC1 regu-
lates the actin cytoskeleton. We monitored actin dynamics in
DIV2–3 hippocampal neurons due to the reliability for live imag-
ing at this age and used Lifeact-GFP to monitor actin (Riedl et al.,
2008, 2010; Figures 5F and S6E; Movies S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5).
Interestingly, we found that WT-DIXDC1 isoform 1, but not
isoform 2, significantly alters F-actin retrograde speed (Figures
5F and 5G). Furthermore, both the hDIXDC1-S592A (isoform 1)
and-S381A(isoform 2)mutants weredifferentthan theirWTcoun-
terparts with respect to their impact on retrograde speed, sug-
gesting the isoforms differentially regulate actin (Figures 5F and
5G). We also found the percentage of neurites with an intact
growth cone was reduced in neurons expressing hDIXDC1-
S592A (isoform 1) or hDIXDC1-S381A (isoform 2), indicating
that MARK1 phosphorylation is required for actin integrity (Fig-
ure 5I). JPK treatment was found to increase spine density and
reduce the number of thin spines in neurons expressing

spine deficits caused by the phosphorylation mutations.
We also examined whether DIXDC1 regulates the microtubule
network using live imaging of red fluorescent protein (RFP)-
tagged EB3 in the same neurons expressing Lifeact-GFP (Fig-
ure 5F). We found that hDIXDC1-WT (isoform 1) significantly
alters EB3 anterograde comet speed and the number of neurons
with comets (Figures 5F, 5H, and 5J), whereas isoform 2 had no
effect, indicating that isoform 1 preferentially modulates the
microtubule network. Furthermore, hDIXDC1-S592A (isoform 1)
had no effect on EB3 comet movements, demonstrating that
MARK1-mediated phosphorylation of isoform 1 regulates the
microtubule network (Figures 5F, 5H, and 5J). Measurements
of global microtubule modifications revealed no overt differ-
ences (Figure 5E). Overall, these data indicate that DIXDC1 iso-
form 1 is the predominant isoform that regulates the actin and
microtubule cytoskeleton in neurons.
Rare Missense Variants in DIXDC1 Impair
Phosphorylation of Isoform 1 and Inhibit Dendrite
and Spine Growth
Finally, we investigated whether there was a functional link
between DIXDC1 and ASD. We examined whole-genome
sequence data for a cohort of individuals with ASD extracted
from the MSSNG database (https://www.mss.ng/researchers#;
Yuen et al., 2015). We discovered four rare inherited variants
in DIXDC1 isoform 1: glycine-8 to glutamic acid (G8E); valine-43
to methionine (V43M); isoleucine-370 to leucine (I370L; I159L in
isoform 2); and threonine-612 to methionine (T612M; T401M in
isoform 2; Table 1). The V43M and T612M variants were found
in two independent probands and validated (Figures 6A and
S7C). As a control, we did not find changes in variant expression
levels in cells (Figure S6B).
We first asked whether the variants impaired DIXDC1 phos-
phorylation. We overexpressed the variants (V43M and T612M
for isoform 1; T401M for isoform 2) into HEK293 cells with
MARK1. To our surprise, we discovered that only the variants
in DIXDC1 isoform 1 (not isoform 2) significantly impaired phos-
phorylation by MARK1 (Figures 6B and 6C). We next determined
whether dendrite and spine formation is impaired by the variants
in isoform 1. We found that the hDIXDC1-V43M and -T612M iso-
form 1 variants were unable to increase (rescue) dendrite
branching or spine density in KO neurons, suggesting a loss of
function (Figures 6D and 6E). Additionally, we expressed the iso-
form 1 variants in WT cortical neurons and found that hDIXDC1-
V43M did not increase dendrite complexity compared to
hDIXDC1-WT, suggesting it is a loss-of-function variant (Fig-
ure S7A). The C-terminal T612M isoform 1 variant also disrupted
dendrite complexity, and it displayed dominant-negative activity
(Figure S7A). Dendritic spine analysis revealed that both isoform
1 variants (V43M and T612M) were unable to significantly in-
crease spine density compared to hDIXDC1-WT isoform 1 in
WT neuronal cultures and were no different than controls (Fig-
ure S7B). Finally, JPK treatment of the hDIXDC1 isoform 1
V43M and T612M variants increased dendritic spine density,
indicating that the dendritic spine defects are reversible (Fig-
ure 6F). Taken together, these data suggest that rare missense
variants in DIXDC1 isoform 1 impair phosphorylation by
MARK1,
leading
to
abnormal
development
of
neuronal
morphology through a cytoskeleton-based mechanism.
DISCUSSION
The mechanism by which genes associated with neurodevelop-
mental disorders impact brain development remains poorly un-
derstood. We reveal that DIXDC1 isoforms regulate the morpho-
logical
development
of
cortical
excitatory
neurons
and
demonstrate that MARK1 phosphorylation of DIXDC1 is required
for dendrite and spine growth. Furthermore, we identify isoform-
specific roles for DIXDC1, determining that isoform 1 predomi-
nantly regulates the cytoskeleton in neurons. Finally, rare
missense variants found in DIXDC1 from ASD individuals impair
DIXDC1 isoform 1 phosphorylation, leading to dendrite and
spine growth defects. These data delineate how a MARK1-
DIXDC1 signaling pathway underlies the development of sy-
naptic connectivity and reveal a mechanism whereby rare
genetic variants have a detrimental biological impact.
DIXDC1 Isoform-Specific Regulation of Dendrite
Formation and Spine Morphology
Whereas both DIXDC1 isoforms regulates dendrite and spine
growth, we detected isoform-specific effects. Both DIXDC1 iso-
forms can localize to dendrites and synapses and rescue defects
in Dixdc1 KO cultures. However, the mechanism of action of
each isoform is different because we detected a clear ability of
isoform 1, but not isoform 2, to modulate the cytoskeleton. We
also delineated a signaling pathway downstream of DIXDC1
that accounts for this, a Rac1-WAVE-2/N-WASP signaling
cascade that regulates F-actin polymerization. Functional anal-
ysis of the C-terminal MARK1-phosphorylation site indicates

 that both the N- and C-terminal domains of isoform 1 regulate the
cytoskeleton, consistent with the actin-binding domain being
present only in isoform 1 (Capelluto et al., 2002; Wang et al.,
2006). This could also explain why isoform 2 does not have a
strong direct impact on the actin and microtubule networks.
Another potential explanation for the functional difference
between the isoforms is that an unknown kinase could activate
isoform 1 at threonine-612, acting as a priming site for serine-
592 phosphorylation by MARK1. Alternatively, the threonine-
401 site in isoform 2 could be regulated by a different kinase
than MARK1. Given that isoform 2 can activate Wnt/b-catenin
signaling (Shiomi et al., 2003), it may act via this pathway to regu-
late dendrite and synapse growth; however, it is unclear how
isoform 2 activation of Wnt/b-catenin transcriptional signaling
would result in local synaptic growth. In this regard, future
studies should examine whether there is cross talk between
the MARK1-cytoskeleton pathway and Wnt/b-catenin signaling.
DIXDC1 Signaling in ASDs and the Role of DIXDC1
Missense Variants
In the current study, the biological interrogation of DIXDC1
variants suggests that its function could be impaired in ASDs.
One unresolved finding is that the V43M and T401/612M variants
occur in putative healthy individuals, and the T612M was found in
a homozygous state in two controls (Lek et al., 2016). Therefore,
although the V43M and T612/401M variants have strong effects
on DIXDC1 protein function, it is unclear how they contribute to
disease risk. Furthermore, in our study, the T612M variant was
inherited from parents who do not have ASD. However, it is not
uncommon for unaffected family members to carry high-risk
ASD mutations (Berkel et al., 2010). Whereas our data should
be interpreted with caution, one potential explanation is the
DIXDC1 variants on their own are not sufficient to cause disease,
but they interact with other variants to increase disease risk
(Bourgeron, 2015). By contrast, protective factors could also
be at play in the unaffected parents or the healthy controls that
abrogate the effects of the DIXDC1 variants.
Taken together, we reveal that MARK1-DIXDC1 signaling
regulates developmental neural connectivity, which is disrupted
by rare genetic variants in DIXDC1. This underscores the need to
study DIXDC1 in normal and abnormal brain developmental par-
adigms to obtain a more complete understanding of its function.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Generation of DIXDC1 Knockout Mouse and Animal Experiments
The Dixdc1 KO mouse was generated by the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping
Consortium. All mice were bred and maintained in the Central Animal Facility
at McMaster University. All procedures received the approval of the Animal
Research Ethics Board. Rat experiments were performed according to the
German and European Animal Welfare Act and with the approval of local
authorities of the city-state Hamburg (Beho
¨ rde f€
ur Gesundheit und Verbrau-
cherschutz, Fachbereich Veterina
¨ rwesen) and the animal care committee of
the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Consent was obtained
from all human participants, as approved by the Research Ethics Boards at
The Hospital for Sick Children, McMaster University, and Memorial Hospital.
Primary Neuronal Cultures
Cortical neuron cultures were prepared from Dixdc1 KO mouse, C57BL/6
(Charles River Laboratories), or CD-1 (Charles River) mouse E16 embryos as
described previously (Johe et al., 1996). Cells were plated at a density of
5–7.5 3 105 cells per well onto coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (BD
Biosciences) and laminin (Sigma) in plating media (Neurobasal media [NB]
[Invitrogen] + 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS] [GIBCO] + penicillin/streptomycin
[Invitrogen], glutamine). After 1.5 hr, media was changed to culturing media
(NB + B27 [Invitrogen] + penicillin [pen]/streptomycin [strep], L-glutamine
[Invitrogen]). Cultures were treated with 1 mM cytosine arabinose (Ara-C)
(Sigma) at DIV3/4.
Plasmid Transfections
Primary neuronal cultures (DIV7) were transfected with 1 mg of DNA for 6 hr in
Neurobasal medium with Lipofectamine LTX according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Life Technologies). Medium was changed to conditioned medium
after 6 hr. HEK293FT cells were grown to 50%–70% confluence in DMEM
with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were trans-
fected with appropriate DNA in DMEM without antibiotics using Lipofectamine
2000 according to manufacturer’s protocol (Life Technologies). Cells were
�95% confluent at the time of harvesting.
Golgi Staining of Mouse Brains
Golgi staining was performed on P30 mouse brains using a commercial kit and
protocol (FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit; FD NeuroTechnologies). Stained brains
were imaged using Zeiss Axiocam ICm1 microscope camera. z stacks
were acquired at 1-mm intervals and processed using ImageJ software (Sholl
Analysis plugin).
Electrophysiological Recordings
Coronal brain slices (400 mm) were prepared in cold sucrose-based slicing
solution containing (in mM): 160 sucrose; 2.5 KCl; 10 MgSO4; 1.25 NaH2PO2;
25 glucose; 30 NaHCO3; 20 HEPES; 5 Na-ascorbate; 3 Na-pyruvate; 2 thio-
urea; and 0.5 CaCl2. Slices recovered for 45 min at 30�C and 45 min at room
temperature. Whole-cell recordings (BX51WI; Olympus) were performed using
an Axoclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) from patch electrodes (P-97
puller; Sutter Instruments) containing a cesium-based intracellular solution
(in mM): 100 CsCl; 100 gluconic acid; 10 HEPES; 0.5 EGTA; 10 Na-phospho-
creatine; 2 MgATP; and 0.5 NaGTP (pH 7.3). Brain slices were continuously
superfused in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and a mix of 95% O2/5%
CO2. Composition of aCSF was (in mM): 120 NaCl; 2.5 KCl; 1 MgSO4; 26
NaHCO3; 10 glucose; and 2 CaCl2. One micromolar TTX and 100 mM
picrotoxin were added to the bathing medium to block Na-dependent action
potentials and GABA currents, respectively. Recordings were performed at
�70 mV using Clampex 10.6 (Molecular Devices), corrected for a calculated
�10 mV junction potential and analyzed using the Template Search function
from Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular Devices).
Epi-fluorescence Time-Lapse Imaging
Epi-fluorescence time-lapse imaging was performed on an inverted Nikon
microscope (Eclipse; Ti). During time-lapse imaging, cells plated on glass-
bottomed culture chamber (Sarstedt) were kept in an acrylic chamber at
37�C in 5% CO2. Light intensity of each channel was set at 1 or 2, with expo-
sure time of 500–700 ms. Images were captured with CoolSNAP HQ2camera
(Roper Scientific) using NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon). Images were
captured every 1 or 2 s during the total 300-s interval.
Analysis of Dendrite Complexity and Dendritic Spine Density
Quantitative analysis of all dendrite complexity and spine density was per-
formed using ImageJ software. Neurons expressing GFP were imaged using
a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM700). Images for Sholl analysis were ac-
quired using a 203 objective lens. Sholl analysis parameters were as follows:
starting radius, 10 mm; ending radius, 100 mm; step size, 10 mm. Refer to
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for detailed description of Sholl
analysis. Spine density and morphology were measured from secondary
branches, from the branch point, ranging from 15–25 mm in length. z stack
images were acquired using a 633 oil immersion objective lens, and using
two-dimensional maximum projection images, spine density was measured
in ImageJ software. Statistics were performed using Prism statistical package
(GraphPad).
