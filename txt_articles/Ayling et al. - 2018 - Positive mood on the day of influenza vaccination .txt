Influenza vaccination is estimated to only be effective in 17–53% of older adults. Multiple patient behav-
iors and psychological factors have been shown to act as ‘immune modulators’ sufficient to influence vac-
cination outcomes. However, the relative importance of such factors is unknown as they have typically
been examined in isolation. The objective of the present study was to explore the effects of multiple
behavioral (physical activity, nutrition, sleep) and psychological influences (stress, positive mood, nega-
tive mood) on the effectiveness of the immune response to influenza vaccination in the elderly. A
prospective, diary-based longitudinal observational cohort study was conducted. One hundred and
thirty-eight community-dwelling older adults (65–85 years) who received the 2014/15 influenza vacci-
nation completed repeated psycho-behavioral measures over the two weeks prior, and four weeks fol-
lowing influenza vaccination. IgG responses to vaccination were measured via antigen microarray and
seroprotection via hemagglutination inhibition assays at 4 and 16 weeks post-vaccination. High pre-
vaccination seroprotection levels were observed for H3N2 and B viral strains. Positive mood on the
day of vaccination was a significant predictor of H1N1 seroprotection at 16 weeks post-vaccination
and IgG responses to vaccination at 4 and 16 weeks post-vaccination, controlling for age and gender.
Positive mood across the 6-week observation period was also significantly associated with post-
vaccination H1N1 seroprotection and IgG responses to vaccination at 16 weeks post-vaccination, but in
regression models the proportion of variance explained was lower than for positive mood on the day
of vaccination alone. No other factors were found to significantly predict antibody responses to vaccina-
tion. Greater positive mood in older adults, particularly on the day of vaccination, is associated with
enhanced responses to vaccination.

1. Introduction
Between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths are estimated to occur
worldwide annually as a result of seasonal influenza epidemics
(World Health Organization, 2016). The vast majority of these
deaths (in excess of 90% in industrialised countries), as well as
non-fatal influenza-associated hospitalizations, occur in those aged
65 years or older (Thompson et al., 2003). Influenza vaccination is
comparatively
poor
at
inducing
clinical protection
in
those
65 years of age and older. Clinical efficacy is estimated to be only
17–53% in older adults compared to 70–90% in younger adults
(Goodwin et al., 2006). This means influenza vaccination is least
effective amongst those in most need of protection. While pharma-
cological solutions to this issue have shown some promise, the
effectiveness of influenza vaccination in older adults remains rela-
tively poor and novel methods of improving vaccine outcomes in
this population are needed.
Patient behaviors and psychological well-being can influence
immune responses to vaccination. Physical activity (Pascoe et al.,
2014), nutrition (Calder, 2013), sleep (Prather et al., 2012), stress
(Pedersen et al., 2009), and mood (Marsland et al., 2006) have all
been identified as ‘immune modulators’ sufficient to impact on

 vaccination responses. This raises the possibility that interventions
targeting these factors could act as non-pharmacological adjuvants
to improve vaccination outcomes. To date, no study has explicitly
examined all of the above behavioral and psychological ‘immune
modulators’ and their influence on vaccination responses simulta-
neously. This is needed to determine their relative importance, and
thus identify the factors that should form the focus of intervention.
Furthermore, previous research in this area has relied on limited
assessments of these factors: typically using one-off retrospective
self-report measures that are subject to recall biases. Here we
report findings from a prospective, diary-based longitudinal study
with the primary objective of exploring the effects of physical
activity, nutrition, sleep, stress, and mood on the vaccine-induced
protective antibody response in older adults.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design & participants
A prospective, diary-based longitudinal observational cohort
study of psychological and behavioral influences on influenza vac-
cination responses in older adults was conducted between August
2014 and March 2015. Ethical (REC: 14/EM/0201) and all research
governance approvals were obtained prior to study commence-
ment. One hundred and thirty-eight community-dwelling older
adults aged 65–85 were recruited through 4 primary care practices
in Nottingham, UK. A priori sample size calculations based on
observed effects of stress on vaccine response in elderly caregivers
(Vedhara et al., 1999) indicated a sample of 121 would give 80%
power at 5% significance to detect a similar small-to-medium sized
effect (r = 0.25) in individual regression models. As responses to
influenza vaccination are influenced by previous influenza vaccine
history and exposure (Sasaki et al., 2008), we controlled for prior
vaccine history by limiting recruitment to those who had been vac-
cinated the previous year (2013/14). This meant that all partici-
pants
had
similar
recent
influenza
exposure
histories,
thus
minimising between-person differences in prior exposure. Alterna-
tive approaches including statistically controlling for vaccine his-
tory or recruiting only participants who had not previously
received an influenza vaccination were rejected due to concerns
with poor record keeping and reduced generalisability respec-
tively. By chance, the antigen strains included in the previous year
were identical to those included in the 2014/15 vaccine, however
this was not known prior to the study design being finalised. Exclu-
sion criteria were kept minimal to maximise generalizability. They
included: deemed by health care provider to be too physically frail
to participate; diagnosed with a cognitive condition (e.g., demen-
tia) that would make participation difficult; to have insufficient
command of the English language; or having a contraindication
for influenza vaccination.
The flow of participants through the study is shown in Fig. 1.
Attrition was low with 136 older adults returning at four weeks
post-vaccination (1.4% attrition) and 122 at 16 weeks post-
vaccination (11.6% attrition). There was no evidence of systematic
drop-out bias, with no significant differences in age, gender, body
mass index and pre-vaccination Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels
between completers and non-completers (all p’s > 0.05). Table 1
presents demographic and clinical characteristics of participants,
as well as pre-vaccination IgG and hemagglutination seroprotec-
tion levels (traditionally defined as a hemagglutination inhibiting
antibody (HAI) titre �40). In keeping with the vaccine strains for
the 2014/15 year being identical to those in the previous year, a
substantial proportion of participants reached seroprotection
thresholds for the H3N2 (63.1%) and B (47.2%) strains of the vac-
cine at baseline.
2.2. Procedure
A diagram of the study timeline is shown in Fig. 2. At baseline,
participants provided written informed consent, demographic data
(e.g., gender, level of education), had height and weight measure-
ments taken and had a pre-vaccination blood sample taken. Partic-
ipants then began a 6-week intensive data collection period with
psychological (stress, positive mood, negative mood) and behav-
ioral factors (physical activity, nutrition, sleep) measured via daily
diaries and pedometers on three consecutive, but randomly
selected days each week (18 response days in total, further details
below). At two weeks, participants attended their local GP surgery,
received a standard dose of the 2014/15 northern hemisphere
influenza vaccine and completed questionnaire measures of posi-
tive and negative mood. Post-vaccination serum samples were
scheduled to assess both short- and long-term antibody responses
to vaccination. Short-term antibody responses were measured at
4 weeks post-vaccination, which represents the peak of IgG
responses to vaccination (Gross et al., 1996). For a more clinically
relevant end-point, long-term antibody responses were measured
at 16 weeks post-vaccination, as this represents the minimum time
period for most participants between vaccination (September/
October) and when influenza viruses circulate most frequently in
the UK population (January–March).
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Behavioral measures
Dietary intake was assessed on each response day using the 24-
h EPIC-Norfolk food diary (McKeown et al., 2001) and processed
using DietPlan 6 Software. Specifically, we extracted data for
energy, protein, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin
D, and vitamin E. For each dietary component, participants were
classified based on meeting UK recommended nutrient intake
levels (Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy, 1991;
Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, 2011).
Physical activity levels were estimated using Yamax SW-200
pedometers, which have previously been shown to correlate highly
with gold-standard accelerometer data (Motl et al., 2006).
Sleep duration, latency and efficiency was measured using
adapted items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse
et al., 1989). On each response day, participants were asked to
record at what time the previous night they had gone to bed,
how long it took them to fall asleep, the time they got up, and
the total amount of sleep they had (accounting for any distur-
bances in the night).
2.3.2. Psychological measures
Stress was measured using the four-item perceived stress scale
(average a = 0.74)
(Cohen
and
Williamson,
1988).
On
each
response day, participants were required to indicate how often
they experienced negative thoughts and feelings because of
overloading, unpredictable or uncontrollable situations (e.g., ‘‘In
the last few days, how often have you felt that you were unable
to control the important things in your life?”) on a 5-point scale
(never – very often).
Positive
and
negative
mood
was
measured
using
the
International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form
(I-PANAS-SF) (Thompson, 2007). It was considered that completion
of the full I-PANAS-SF on each response day during the diary period
would be too burdensome, therefore we assessed positive and neg-
ative mood during the diary period using 4 items each response
day (2 positive and 2 negative). These items were randomly
selected with randomisation determined by a computer algorithm
in cycles without replacement, so that all items appeared at equal
K. Ayling et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 67 (2018) 314–323
315
 frequencies throughout the diary period. Participants all completed
the same items at the same time points. On each response day, par-
ticipants were presented with emotion adjectives that were posi-
tive (e.g., active) or negative (e.g., nervous) in nature and asked
to rate on a five-point scale (very slightly or not at all - extremely)
the extent to which they felt that way ‘‘at that moment”. On the
day of vaccination, participants also completed the full 10-item
version of this scale (a = 0.89 for PA, a = 0.64 for NA).

 2.3.3. IgG and HAI antibodies
Venous blood samples (8 ml) were collected via venipuncture in
tubes containing clot activator and gel for separating serum. After
clotting at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 2000g
for 10 min after which sera were separated and stored at -80 �C
until analysis. Influenza IgG antibodies were measured in thawed
sera via antigen microarray as previously reported (Ayling et al.,
2017). As pre-vaccination IgG levels can influence responses to
vaccination, we corrected for pre-vaccination levels using a proce-
dure developed by Beyer and colleagues (2004). While IgG levels
outcomes
provide
highly
specific
quantitative
measures
of
immune response to vaccination, established thresholds for ade-
quate IgG levels to indicate clinical protection are lacking. There-
fore, we also measured HAI titres in accordance with WHO
guidelines (World Health Organization, 2011), which does not have
the specificity of IgG levels measured by antigen microarray but
does have well-established clinical protection thresholds, with
seroprotection traditionally defined as a titre �40 (Hobson et al.,
1972). Following processing, a substantial proportion (>50%) of
H3N2 samples obtained at 16 weeks post-vaccination could not
be reliably interpreted for HAI titres, likely due to a technical error.
Therefore, the H3N2 viral strain was excluded from HAI analyses at
16 weeks.
2.4. Treatment of data & statistical analyses
The proportion of missing data for each variable measured
over the diary period (averaged across all time-points) was as
follows: positive affect – 14.3%; negative affect – 14.4%; perceived
stress – 14.3%; physical activity – 12.9%; sleep duration – 11.2%;
sleep latency – 14.6%; sleep efficiency – 23.6%; and nutritional fac-
tors – 11.7%. The nature of missing data was assessed using Little’s
MCAR test, which showed no significant deviation from random-
ness (v2(29420) = 13616.39, p = 1.00). No imputation of missing
data was performed.

 To aggregate repeated measures of psycho-behavioral factors,
random intercept latent growth modelling was performed, fitting
linear regression lines for each participant. As patterns of change
over time were not of interest for these analyses, slopes of the
regression lines were fixed to 0, so that the intercepts represented
the average level for that variable over diary period. Autocorrela-
tion was assessed for each psycho-behavioral factor by examining
the correlation between adjacent and subsequent residuals and
was retained in the model if significant (p < 0.05). Intercepts were
then used as the aggregated measure for each psycho-behavioral
predictor in subsequent analyses. An advantage of this approach
is that it can accommodate reasonable levels of missing data,
meaning that for all variables measured during the diary period
nearly all participants provided sufficient responses for an aggre-
gated measure to be derived. The maximum number of partici-
pants for whom no intercept could be calculated for a variable
measured over the diary period was 10 out of 138 (7.2%). Sensitiv-
ity analysis performed using unadjusted mean levels produced
similar findings to those reported below.
IgG levels were log2 transformed to improve distribution nor-
mality. Negative mood scores were found to be significantly posi-
tively skewed, however attempts at transformation (log, square
root, and inverse) were unsuccessful at sufficiently improving the
distribution. Therefore, in subsequent analyses the untransformed
scores were used, with non-parametric tests employed where
possible.
To assess relationships between antibody outcomes and psy-
chological/behavioral factors, exploratory correlational and chi-
squared analyses were first performed to identify significant
bivariate relationships. Due to the exploratory nature of these anal-
yses and a desire not to increase type-2 errors, no corrections for
multiple comparisons were applied. Following this, hierarchical
linear and logistic regression models were built to predict antibody
outcomes. Based on previous findings that age and gender can
influence
immune
function
and,
in
particular,
vaccination
responses (Giefing-Kroll et al., 2015), we decided a priori to control
for age and gender by entering them into step 1 of each regression
model with significant psychological and behavioral factors added
sequentially in steps thereafter, starting with the predictor with
the highest correlation coefficient. All analyses were performed
using SPSS (version 23) or Mplus (version 7.4) software.
3. Results
3.1. Responses to vaccination
The profile of IgG levels and HAI seroprotection levels at each
time point are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively. For all
strains, repeated measures ANOVAs showed a significant increase
in log2-transformed mean IgG antibody levels following vaccina-
tion
[H1N1:
F(2,238) = 3.76,
p = 0.03;
H3N2:
F(2,238) = 9.30,
p < 0.001; B: F(2,238) = 6.48, p = 0.002]. Post-hoc pairwise compar-
isons revealed IgG antibody levels significantly increased in all
strains
from
pre-vaccination
to
16 weeks
post-vaccination
(H1N1:
p = 0.004;
H3N2
p < 0.001;
B:
p = 0.001),
from
pre-
vaccination to 4 weeks for H3N2 (p = 0.020) and B (p = 0.007)
strains, but not the H1N1 strain (p = 0.095). IgG levels did not
increase
for
any
strains
between
4
and
16 weeks
post-
vaccination (H1N1: p = 0.34, H3N2: p = 0.086; B: p = 0.775).
For HAI antibody responses, Cochran’s Q tests showed the pro-
portion of participants achieving seroprotection for all strains sig-
nificantly increased following vaccination [H1N1: Q(2) = 43.28,
p < 0.001;
H3N2:
Q(2) = 11.57,
p = 0.0013;
B:
Q(2) = 27.45,
p < 0.001]. Post-hoc pairwise McNemar tests indicated the propor-
tion of seroprotected participants increased from pre-vaccination
to
both
four
and
16 weeks
post-vaccination
in
all
strains
(p’s < 0.001–0.007), but there was no significant change between
four and 16 weeks post-vaccination, except for in the B strain
(p = 0.011).
3.2. Psychological and behavioral factors
Table 2 presents a summary of behavioral and psychological
factors measured over the diary period. For the dietary compo-
nents, nearly all participants (range 80–98%) met recommended
intakes for protein, iron and vitamin C, but did not meet recom-
mended intakes for selenium, and vitamin D. Therefore, only those
components in which some variability was evident were examined
as potential predictors of the antibody response to vaccination i.e.,
energy, zinc, vitamin A, and vitamin E.
3.3. Relationships between psycho-behavioral factors and IgG
responses to vaccination
Exploratory bivariate correlations between psychological and
behavioral factors measured and IgG levels are presented in
Table 3. For the H1N1 strain, this revealed a significant relationship
between positive mood over the diary period and IgG levels at
4 weeks
(r = 0.20,
p = 0.03)
and
16 weeks
post-vaccination
(r = 0.30, p = 0.002), such that those with greater levels of positive
mood had higher IgG levels. Positive mood on the day of vaccina-
tion was significantly positively correlated with IgG levels at 4
(r = 0.26,
p = 0.004)
and
16 weeks
post-vaccination
(r = 0.35,
p < 0.001), with marginally higher correlation coefficients. For the
H3N2 strain, significant relationships between IgG levels and neg-
ative mood over the diary period (rho = �0.27, p = 0.004) and on
Fig. 3. Serum IgG levels pre- and post-vaccination. Bars represent standard error of
the mean. +Florescence values from a 1:8000 diluted sample interpolated against a

 the day of vaccination (rho = �0.21, p = 0.031) were found at
16 weeks post-vaccination, such that those with greater levels of
negative mood had lower IgG levels. For the B Strain, positive mood
on the day of vaccination was significantly associated with IgG
levels at 4 weeks post-vaccination (r = 0.19, p = 0.038), such that
those with greater levels of positive mood had higher IgG levels.
No other psychological or behavioral factors measured during the
diary period were significantly correlated with IgG responses to
influenza vaccination.
Linear regression models showed that positive mood over the
diary period was an independent predictor above age and gender

although at 4 weeks the overall model was non-significant. Sepa-
rate linear regression models focusing on positive mood on the
day of vaccination showed this to be a significant independent pre-
dictor of H1N1 IgG levels above age and gender at both 4 [b = 0.24,
p = 0.01; model F(3,116) = 3.15, p = 0.028, R2 = 0.08] and 16 weeks

[b = 0.38,
p < 0.001;
model
F(3,103) = 5.65,
p = 0.001, R2 = 0.14]. In each case, the proportion of variance
explained (R2) was larger than for equivalent models containing
aggregated measures of positive mood over the complete diary
period.
For the H3N2 strain, linear regression models revealed negative
mood
during

period
[b = �0.06,
p = 0.512;

F(3,106) = 1.13, p = 0.339, R2 = 0.03], and on the day of vaccination

were not significant independent predictors of IgG levels at
16 weeks post-vaccination above age and gender. For the B Strain,
positive affect on the day of vaccination did not significantly
independently predict IgG levels at 4 weeks post-vaccination
[b = 0.16, p = 0.078; model F(3,116) = 2.20, p = 0.092, R2 = 0.05].
3.4. Relationships between psycho-behavioral factors and HAI
responses to vaccination
A similar pattern of findings was observed for HAI responses to
vaccination. Specifically, exploratory analyses showed the aggre-
gated measure of positive mood over the complete diary period
(rbiserial = 0.28, p = 0.01), and positive mood on the day of vaccina-
tion (rbiserial = 0.38, p = 0.002), were significantly positively associ-
ated
with
having
H1N1
seroprotection
at
16 weeks
post-
vaccination, although not at 4 weeks post-vaccination (Table 4).
For the H3N2 strain, associations were observed between dietary
zinc intake (v2(1) = 4.13, p = 0.042, u = �0.195) at 4 weeks post-
vaccination, with those who met recommended nutrient intake
levels being less likely to be seroprotected. No other significant
associations between psycho-behavioral factors and seroprotec-
tion were observed.
Logistic regression models indicated the aggregated measure of
positive mood significantly improved the model predicting H1N1
seroprotection at 16 weeks containing age and gender alone
[v2(1) = 4.796, p = 0.03], but the model as a whole remained non-
significant [v2(3) = 6.640, p = 0.08]. In contrast, positive mood on
the day of vaccination independently predicted H1N1 seroprotec-
tion at 16 weeks post-vaccination above age and gender [B = 0.15
(0.56), Wald = 7.60, p = 0.006, Exp(B) = 1.166, 95% CI: 1.05–1.30],
with the overall model being significant [v2(3) = 9.873, p = 0.02,
R2 = 0.12 (Nagelkerke), 0.09 (Cox & Snell)]. For the H3N2 strain,
dietary zinc status significantly improved the model predicting
seroprotection at 4 weeks containing age and gender alone
[v2(1) = 5.212, p = 0.022], but the model as a whole remained
non-significant [v2(3) = 5.418, p = 0.144].
3.5. Post-hoc exploratory analyses
As relationships were observed for positive affect over the
whole diary period and on the day of vaccination, we examined
whether these factors potentially influenced vaccination outcomes
through independent pathways by conducting additional explora-
tory analyses entering both measures into hierarchical regression
models simultaneously for outcomes where both had been identi-
fied as significant predictors when entered alone. For the H1N1
strain, only positive affect on the day of vaccination remained an

neither positive affect measure was an independent predictor
when entered together.
To examine whether relationships between psychological and
behavioral factors and vaccination outcomes differed according
to the time relative to vaccination, post hoc correlational and
chi-squared analyses were conducted between weekly mean levels
for each psychological and behavioral variable measured across the
diary period and antibody outcomes. These are presented in the
supplementary appendix (Table S1). These analyses show there
was no consistent pattern across variables. In addition, further
exploratory correlational analyses were performed exploring the
relationships between specific positive and negative affect items
completed on the day of vaccination and antibody outcomes, to
explore which aspects of affect may be driving observed effects
(Table S2). However, no specific items appeared to be more
strongly associated with antibody outcomes than others.
3.6. Discussion
The present study sought to examine the effects of known
behavioral and psychological immune modulators on influenza
vaccination responses in older adults. We found that greater posi-
tive mood, whether measured repeatedly over a 6-week period
around vaccination, or on the day of vaccination, significantly pre-
dicted greater antibody responses to influenza vaccination in the
least immunogenic viral strain (H1N1). This effect was observed
when measuring both absolute levels of IgG and seroprotection
as determined by HAI. However, comparable effects were not
found for the H3N2 and B strains of the vaccination. No other
behavioral or psychological factor measured significantly predicted
vaccination outcomes.
Our findings in relation to positive mood are consistent with,
and extend, previous findings that positive mood can act as an ‘im-

 mune modulator’ (Marsland et al., 2007) and that trait positive
affect is associated with greater antibody responses to Hepatitis
B vaccination (Marsland et al., 2006). Interestingly, we found the
effects of positive mood on the day of vaccination appeared to be
more pronounced than positive mood over the 6-week period sur-
rounding vaccination as a whole. This was evidenced by the rela-
tive size of the effects (see Tables 3 and 4) and post hoc
exploratory analyses for 16 week post-vaccination H1N1 outcomes
- in which only positive mood on the day of vaccination remained a
significant independent predictor when both measures were
entered into regression models. This suggests the day of vaccina-
tion may be a particularly salient time-point at which positive
mood influences immune responses to vaccination.
While positive mood on the day of vaccination may be particu-
larly salient for vaccine outcomes, this does not appear to be com-
pletely independent of positive affect over the longer period
surrounding vaccination (i.e., these may not necessarily act
through different pathways). This raises an interesting question
regarding whether it might be sufficient to change mood on the
day of vaccine to achieve an improved antibody response to vacci-
nation or if it is necessary to change mood over longer periods?
There is of course extensive experimental research which suggests
that relatively brief mood-enhancing interventions can impact on
immune parameters. For example, watching a comedy film has
been found to increase S-IgA concentration and amend cytokine
secretions (Dillon et al., 1985; Mittwoch-Jaffe et al., 1995), a ses-
sion of yoga has been associated with increases in soluble IL-6
receptors (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2010), and briefly writing about
one’s self-congruencies has been found to increase leukocyte, lym-
phocyte and NK cell counts in sera (Strauman et al., 2004).
Although, whether these immunological changes are sufficient to
impact meaningfully on vaccination responses, or whether such
mood-enhancing interventions could be implemented within the
confines of existing vaccination practices (e.g., short-time win-
dows, acceptability to older adults and healthcare professionals),
remains unclear.
When considering potential mechanisms, it is likely that these
may be both direct and indirect. Indirectly, positive mood is asso-
ciated with healthier lifestyles (Grant et al., 2009) and better
health status is associated with improved responses to vaccination
(Gross et al., 1989). More directly, biological pathways between
sub-cortical regions of the brain responsible for affective process-
ing and the immune system have been described previously,
including endocrine-mediated mechanisms (Marques-Deak et al.,
2005) and the direct innervation of lymphatic organs extending
from the central nervous system (Felten and Felten, 1991). Mood
induction
and
ambulatory
measurement
studies
show
links
between positive affective states and CNS parasympathetic activa-
tion; cortisol secretions; greater NK cytotoxicity, c-reactive protein
levels, and flow rates of secretory IgA (Pressman and Cohen, 2005).
Together, these biological correlates of positive mood provide
some evidence of mechanisms by which immune function, and
therefore antibody responses to vaccination, might be influenced.
Notwithstanding the issue of potential mechanisms, it is note-
worthy that the relationship between positive mood and antibody
responses was only observed for the weakest immunogenic strain
(H1N1) and not for H3N2 and B strains. One explanation is that any
influence of psychological or behavioral factors on antibody
responses may only be observable when the host immune
response to the antigen is relatively weak. This explanation has
been put forward previously by other researchers in this field
and is supported by evidence from comparative trials between full
and half-dose vaccines. These have repeatedly shown that psycho-
behavioral influences are often only seen in the weakest immuno-
genic strains (Edwards et al., 2012, Edwards et al. (2010), Edwards
et al. (2007)). For example, Edwards et al. (2012) compared young
adults’ antibody responses to either a full or 50% dose of pneumo-
coccal vaccination, administered immediately after completing a
15-min resistance exercise program or resting. Those performing
exercise in the half-dose group showed greater average post-
vaccination antibody levels over resting participants. For those
receiving the full dose, there was no significant difference in anti-
body responses between exercisers and resting controls, indicating
that where vaccination induces high levels of antibody, additional
benefits of psychological or behavioral factors may not be evident.
An alternative explanation relates to ceiling effects obscuring
psycho-behavioral influences on antibody responses. This is partic-
ularly relevant in this study as participants received a vaccination
which was identical to that administered in the previous year. Con-
sequently, we observed that 63% and 47% of participants had sero-
protective levels of H3N2 and B strains respectively prior to being
vaccinated. This was unexpected. While the recommended compo-
sition of influenza vaccines often includes some strains two years
running, all three strains remaining the same has only previously
happened twice since the turn of the century (2002/3–2003/4 &
2010/1–2011/2) for the northern hemisphere vaccination. This
may partly explain why other factors did not significantly predict
post-vaccination antibody responses despite previous findings to
the contrary (Calder, 2013; Pascoe et al., 2014; Pedersen et al.,
2009; Prather et al., 2012). Accordingly, we speculate that the
observed effects may differ for more novel antigens and could
potentially be larger. As such, we do not argue that the other psy-
chological and behavioral factors measured do not influence vacci-
nation response, rather we suggest that this study provides
preliminary evidence that positive affect may be particularly influ-
ential given that the effect was observed despite the potential for
ceiling effects. It is noteworthy that other researchers have also
failed to find relationships between many of the behavioral and
psychological
factors
measured
with
vaccine
response
(e.g.,
Bunout et al., 2004 [nutrition]; Dopp et al., 2007 [sleep]; Hayney
et al., 2014 [physical activity]; Long et al., 2013 [physical activity];
Marsland et al., 2001 [stress]; Wong et al., 2013 [stress]) and as
such replication of the present findings with more novel antigens
or in a subsequent influenza vaccination season would give greater
confidence in their validity.
This study has several limitations. The presented relationships
are observational in nature and therefore it is possible that other,
unmeasured factors are acting as confounders. Further, the self-
selecting sample may not be representative of the older adult pop-
ulation. This is particularly true with respects to ethnicity, which
was primarily limited to Caucasians in this study. This is notewor-
thy because of previous reports of race-based differences in
immune responses to vaccination (Haralambieva et al., 2013).
Extrapolation of these results should therefore be made with due
caution. Further, null findings in relation to stress and negative
affect may in part be related to their relatively low prevalence in
the present cohort. Previous studies that have demonstrated detri-
mental effects of negative affect or stress on vaccination responses
(e.g., Vedhara et al., 1999) have often been conducted in high-
stress contexts such as caregiving. However, comparatively few
of our participants experienced high levels of negative affect, as
evidenced by the non-normal distribution of negative affect scores
in our sample (skewed towards having low levels of negative
affect).
A further limitation is that we only recruited individuals who
had been vaccinated in the previous year, potentially limiting gen-
eralisability. However, as influenza vaccination uptake rates for
older adults in the US and UK annually are between 60–65% and
70–75% respectively (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2015; Public Health England, 2015) the proportion of older adults
not having previously been vaccinated is comparatively small.
Additionally, as we examined many variables it is possible that
K. Ayling et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 67 (2018) 314–323
321
 some relationships between psychological and behavioral factors
and vaccine responses with effect sizes lower than that observed
for positive affect were not found to be significant due to insuffi-
cient power (type-II errors). We attempted to mitigate this possi-
bility to a degree by not further reducing power by correcting for
multiple comparisons, however this may in turn have inflated
the possibility of type-I errors. Replication of these findings is
needed to be confident in their veracity.
Finally, while antigen-specific IgG and HAI levels are widely
accepted correlates of vaccine-induced protection, they do not per-
fectly predict protection against real-world clinical infections. In
part, this is because exposure to influenza differs across individu-
als. Additional research focusing on the relationship between pos-
itive mood and non-surrogate influenza outcomes would help
clarify the clinical importance of these findings. Despite these lim-
itations, this is the first study to comprehensively examine patient
behaviors and psychological factors on the vaccine-induced pro-
tective antibody response in older adults using a robust methodol-
ogy (prospective, diary-based longitudinal study).
