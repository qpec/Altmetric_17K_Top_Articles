Background. The recommended duration of antibiotic treatment for Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections is 7–14 days. 
We compared the outcomes of patients receiving short-course (6–10 days) vs prolonged-course (11–16 days) antibiotic therapy for 
Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia.
Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 3 medical centers and included patients with monomicrobial 
Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia treated with in vitro active therapy in the range of 6–16 days between 2008 and 2014. 1:1 nearest 
neighbor propensity score matching without replacement was performed prior to regression analysis to estimate the risk of all-
cause mortality within 30 days after the end of antibiotic treatment comparing patients in the 2 treatment groups. Secondary out-
comes included recurrent bloodstream infections, Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and the emergence of multidrug-resistant 
gram-negative (MDRGN) bacteria, all within 30 days after the end of antibiotic therapy.
Results. There were 385 well-balanced matched pairs. The median duration of therapy in the short-course group and pro-
longed-course group was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7–9 days) and 15 days (IQR, 13–15 days), respectively. No difference in 
mortality between the treatment groups was observed (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], .62–1.63). 
The odds of recurrent bloodstream infections and CDI were also similar. There was a trend toward a protective effect of short-course 
antibiotic therapy on the emergence of MDRGN bacteria (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, .32–1.09; P = .09).
Conclusions. Short courses of antibiotic therapy yield similar clinical outcomes as prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy for 
Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia, and may protect against subsequent MDRGN bacteria.

The incidence of gram-negative bacteremia continues to 
increase, particularly with advances in medical care, and 
remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality for 
hospitalized patients [1]. Traditionally, gram-negative bacter-
emia is treated in the range of 7–14 days, but data for the opti-
mal treatment duration within this range are limited. Prolonged 
antibiotic exposure has been associated with an increased 
likelihood of adverse drug events [2, 3], Clostridium difficile 
infections (CDI) [3] and antibacterial resistance [4]. The ideal 
duration of antibiotic therapy is one that optimizes clinical out-
comes while minimizing adverse drug events.
Existing studies evaluating durations of therapy for gram-neg-
ative bacteremia have a number of limitations including small 
samples sizes, lack of comparator arms, and/or confounding by 
indication [5–7]. A meta-analysis of  24 randomized controlled 
trials including patients with bloodstream infections found that 
clinical cure and survival in patients receiving short courses of 
antibiotic treatment were similar to those in patients receiving 
prolonged courses of treatment [8]. However, approximately 
80% of included patients had bacteremia as a consequence of 
community-acquired pneumonia or urinary tract infections 
and there were few included patients with healthcare-associ-
ated infections. Furthermore, there was significant heteroge-
neity between studies with regard to age (60% of patients were 
children), preexisting medical conditions, source of bacteremia,

 Duration of Therapy for Bacteremia • CID 2018:66 (15 January) • 173
and severity of illness. To overcome some of these limitations, 
we sought to explore the optimal duration of therapy for 
gram-negative bacteremia by comparing the clinical outcomes 
of adult patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia receiving 
short-course (6–10 days) vs prolonged-course (11–15 days) 
antibiotic therapy.
METHODS
Setting and Participants
Patients 18 years of age and older admitted to the Johns 
Hopkins Hospital, the University of Maryland Medical Center, 
and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with 
Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia between 2008 and 2014 were 
retrospectively identified. In a given patient, only the initial epi-
sode of Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia during the study period 
was included.
The primary exposure was duration of antibiotic treat-
ment, dichotomized to short-course (6–10 days) and pro-
longed-course (11–16 days) therapy, with the first day of 
therapy being the day that blood cultures were obtained. It was 
determined a priori to categorize duration of bacteremia into 
short-course and prolonged-course therapy to improve clinical 
applicability. Antibiotic duration included antibiotics continued 
after hospital discharge prescribed for bloodstream infections. 
The primary outcome was 30-day posttreatment mortality, 
defined as death from any cause within 30 days after the discon-
tinuation of antibiotic therapy. For example, if a patient in the 
short-course group received 7 days of therapy, the observation 
time for the outcome would be days 8–37. Similarly, if a patient 
in the prolonged-course group received 14 days of therapy, the 
observation time for the outcome would be days 15–44. The 
time period of 30 days after discontinuation of antibiotics was 
selected so that the time period for which patients were “at risk” 
for the outcome would be similar between the 2 groups. All 
patients had to survive until at least 1 day after antibiotics were 
discontinued so that survival in the short-course group would 
not be artificially truncated. In addition, we performed a sep-
arate analysis comparing 30-day mortality between the short-
course and prolonged-course groups, with day 1 being the first 
day positive blood cultures were obtained.
Secondary outcomes included (1) a recurrent bloodstream 
infection with the same organism, (2) CDI, and (3) emergence 
of multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDRGN) colonization 
or infection that was not present within the year prior to the 
index blood culture date. All secondary outcomes were evalu-
ated within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy. Similar to 
the primary outcome, this time point was selected so the time at 
risk would be the same for both groups and differential expos-
ure to antibiotics during the time at risk would be avoided.
Incident MDRGN colonization or infection was defined 
as Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas species or Acinetobacter 
species recovered in subsequent clinical cultures resistant to 
at least 1 drug in 3 drug categories (piperacillin-tazobactam, 
extended-spectrum cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, amino-
glycosides, carbapenems, or [specifically for Acinetobacter 
baumannii] ampicillin-sulbactam) [9]. No active surveillance 
for MDRGNs was performed at any of the participating insti-
tutions. CDI was defined as a positive test for C. difficile in the 
setting of clinical criteria for infection [10].
Patients meeting any of the following criteria were excluded: 
(1) polymicrobial bacteremia, (2) duration of therapy outside of 
the 6- to 16-day range, (3) discontinuation of antibiotic therapy 
due to transition to hospice care, (4) death while receiving anti-
biotic therapy for Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infection, (5) 
failure to receive at least 1 agent with in vitro activity against 
the isolated organism from the time of culture obtainment to 
the completion of antibiotic therapy, (6) treatment with amino-
glycoside monotherapy, and (7) recipients of hematopoietic 
stem cell or solid organ transplantations. Transplant patients 
were excluded as it was observed that these patients almost 
exclusively received prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy 
for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia on exploratory analysis and 
there were insufficient short-course patients to compare them 
to.
DATA COLLECTION
Demographic, preexisting medical conditions, source of bacter-
emia and source control measures, microbiological, treatment, 
and outcomes data for eligible patients were retrieved from 
electronic medical records from each of the institutions from 
medical record review and entered into a secure REDCap data-
base. Source of infection and appropriateness of source control 
measures were determined by infectious diseases–trained phy-
sicians. Appropriate source control was defined as the removal 
of infected hardware, drainage of infected fluid collections, or 
resolution of obstruction for biliary or urinary sources during 
the time period of antibiotic therapy. To evaluate severity of 
illness, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and Pitt bacteremia 
score [11] were documented on day 1 of bacteremia. This study 
was approved by the institutional review boards of the 3 partici-
pating institutions, with a waiver of informed consent.
Statistical Analyses
Data analysis was performed using Stata version 12.0 software 
(StataCorp, College Station, Texas). The 2 treatment groups 
were compared on the basis of the duration of antibiotic treat-
ment. Propensity scores were generated and propensity score 
matching was undertaken to account for treatment decisions 
influenced by confounding by indication (ie, the tendency for 
more ill-appearing or medically complex patients who would 
likely be at higher risk of mortality to receive prolonged courses 
of antibiotic therapy).

Propensity scores were calculated using a multivariable 
logistic regression model in which the dependent variable was 
a binary indicator of antibiotic duration. Covariates included 
in generating the propensity score included calendar year of 
bloodstream infection, hospital, age, preexisting conditions 
(end-stage liver disease, end-stage renal disease requiring dia-
lysis, structural lung disease, congestive heart failure with an 
ejection fraction of <45%, diabetes, immunocompromising 
conditions (human immunodeficiency virus, chemotherapy 
within 6 months, absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <100 cells/
μL at the time of positive blood culture obtainment, immu-
nomodulatory therapy, or corticosteroids for ≥14 days), Pitt 
bacteremia score, ICU stay on day 1 of bacteremia, source of 
bacteremia, and source control measures. 1:1 nearest neighbor 
matching without replacement was performed with a caliper 
width of 0.20. Standardized mean biases were tested to ensure 
balance after propensity score matching between the short- and 
prolonged-course groups.
The χ2 or Fisher exact test was used to compare baseline 
categorical variables, as appropriate, between matched pairs. 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare baseline medi-
ans of continuous variables. Cox proportional hazards mod-
eling was used to estimate the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 
and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) for potential risk 
factors associated with time to mortality. Prespecified potential 
confounders including immunocompromised status and vari-
ables yielding P values <.10 on univariable analysis of the pro-
pensity score–matched cohort were included in multivariable 
models. The proportional hazards assumption was examined 
by graphically inspecting complementary log–log plots for each 
variable. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios 
(ORs) and associated 95% CIs for recurrent bloodstream infec-
tions, subsequent CDI, and the emergence of MDRGN bacteria 
between the 2 groups. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to 
assess the fit of regression models. A 2-sided P value <.05 was 
considered to be statistically significant for all tests.
RESULTS
A cohort of 4967 unique patients with Enterobacteriaceae bac-
teremia were identified during the study period, with 1769 
patients meeting eligibility criteria (Figure 1). There were 
385 propensity score–matched pairs in each treatment group. 
Baseline characteristics of these 2 groups were well-balanced 
when evaluating standardized biases. A comparison of base-
line characteristics between short and prolonged-course anti-
biotic treatment groups before and after propensity score 
matching is shown in Table 1. The median duration of therapy 
in the short-course group and prolonged-course groups was 8 
days (interquartile range [IQR], 7–9 days) and 15 days (IQR, 
13–15 days), respectively. In accordance with the eligibility cri-
teria, all patients received in vitro active antibiotic agents from 
the time blood cultures were obtained to the time antibiotics 
were discontinued. Additionally, all patients were initiated on 
β-lactam therapy at the time blood cultures were obtained. 
Approximately 30% of bloodstream infections occurred in ICU 
patients. The most common organisms identified from blood 
cultures in the matched cohort were Escherichia coli (46.9%) 
followed by Klebsiella species (32.6%), and Enterobacter species 
(11.7%) (Table 2).
Primary Outcome
After propensity score matching, there were 37 (9.6%) and 39 
(10.1%) deaths within the 30-day follow-up period in the short-
course and prolonged-course groups, respectively. In univari-
able analysis, shorter antibiotic durations were not associated 
with an increased risk of mortality (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, .70–1.80;

additional day of antibiotic therapy for the 30 days after antibi-
otics were discontinued (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, .91–1.05). No dif-
ference in all-cause mortality was observed between short- and 
prolonged-course treatment groups after additional adjustment 
for immunocompromised status and for variables with P val-
ues <.10 on univariable analysis (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.00; 95% 
CI, .62–1.63). Additional factors that remained associated with

30-day all-cause mortality in the multivariable model were uri-
nary sources (protective), Pitt bacteremia score, and end-stage 
liver disease (Table 3). We also compared 30-day mortality in 
the propensity-matched cohort between the short-course and 
prolonged-course groups, with day 1 being the day the first 
positive blood culture was obtained, and found no difference 
between the 2 treatment groups (aHR, 0.92; 95% CI, .59–1.45).
Secondary Outcomes
There were 5 (1.3%) and 9 (2.3%) episodes of recurrent blood-
stream infections with the same organism in the short- and 
prolonged-course treatment groups, respectively (OR, 1.32; 
95% CI, .48–3.41). CDI occurred in 7 (1.8%) and 6 (1.6%) 
patients within 30 days of discontinuing antibiotics in the 
short- and longer-course treatment groups, respectively (OR, 
1.16; 95% CI, .39–3.51). There were 17 (4.4%) reports of inci-
dent MDRGN resistance in the short-course and 28 (7.3%) 
in the prolonged-course treatment groups (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 
.32–1.09; P = .09).
DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that patients receiving 6–10 days of anti-
biotic therapy for uncomplicated Enterobacteriaceae bacter-
emia have a similar risk of survival in the ensuing 30 days as 
patients receiving longer courses of antibiotic therapy. Current 
Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for cathe-
ter-related gram-negative bloodstream infections suggest pre-
scribing antibiotic therapy in the range of 7–14 days [12]. This 
recommendation is considered low-grade evidence (C-III) 
because of limitations with existing studies addressing this 
question. A 2001 multinational survey revealed that the dura-
tions of antibiotic therapy prescribed for gram-negative bac-
teremia range widely among clinicians [13]. The investigators 
concluded that the wide variability in antibiotic prescribing 
patterns suggests an urgent need to produce high-quality evi-
dence to identify optimal antibiotic prescribing practices for 
bacteremia [13]. Unfortunately, little progress has been made 
since 2001 to refine treatment ranges and to standardize anti-
biotic administration practices for gram-negative bloodstream 
infections.
In the past, prolonged antibiotic treatment courses were pre-
scribed for several reasons: lack of appreciation of the impact of 
antibiotic therapy on disturbances in the intestinal microbiome 
and associated downstream effects, limited comparative effect-
iveness studies exploring optimal durations of antibiotic therapy 
as prolonged durations of therapy were often used by default in 
infectious diseases trials, and a limited understanding that anti-
biotic resistance is a public health crisis [14, 15]. In recent years, 
however, there is mounting evidence of adverse events related to 
prolonged antibiotic use, encouraging the clinical community to 
reexamine common durations of therapy prescribed. Data from 
the treatment of several infectious processes, including results of 
a meta-analysis of urinary and respiratory outpatient conditions, 
suggest that antibiotic durations shorter than those traditionally 
prescribed yield comparable outcomes to more prolonged dura-
tions of therapy, but the risk of subsequent drug resistance is 
greater in the latter group [16–19].
In our propensity score–matched cohort of 770 patients, 
there were 45 (6%) patients with MDRGN organisms recovered 
on clinical cultures in the 30 days after discontinuing antibiotic 
therapy. Although not reaching statistical significance (P = .09), 
these odds were greater in patients receiving prolonged courses 
of antibiotic therapy. After conducting post hoc power calcu-
lations, as recovery of incident MDRGNs in subsequent clin-
ical cultures was a relatively rare event, we determined that 
we only had 40% power to detect the difference in incidence 
of MDRGNs we observed in our cohort—indicating we were 
underpowered to detect a significant difference, if one existed.
There are a number of limitations that should be considered 
when interpreting our findings. First, evaluating treatment 
effects from observational data can be problematic because a 
number of prognostic factors may influence treatment deci-
sions. We attempted to overcome this confounding by indica-
tion with the use of propensity score matching and derived 2 
very well-matched groups with the sole difference between 
the groups being duration of antibiotic therapy. Although use 
of stringent propensity score matching led to the exclusion of 
large numbers of patients in the overall cohort, it ensured the 
2 comparator groups were very similar with regard to demo-
graphic data, preexisting medical conditions, source control

measures, severity of illness, and the administration of in vitro 
active agents. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of add-
itional, unmeasured confounding factors that could impact the 
association between duration of antibiotic therapy and mortality 
that we did not include in generating propensity scores. Second, 
our primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days of 
discontinuing antibiotic therapy rather than mortality attribut-
able to gram-negative bacteremia. Because many patients in our 
cohort had debilitating underlying medical conditions, differen-
tiating between death related to gram-negative bacteremia and 
death from noninfectious causes was challenging. We limited the 
evaluation period to 30 days, rather than 90 days as used in some 
studies, to increase the likelihood that mortality was related to 
the bloodstream infection. Additionally, as virtually all patients 
with hematopoietic stem cell transplants or solid organ trans-
plants with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia that we reviewed 
received prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy, we were unable 
to include transplant patients in our propensity score–matched 
cohort because virtually no transplant patients received short-
course therapy. However, we were able to include patients with a 
variety of other immunocompromising conditions in our cohort 
including HIV, receipt of chemotherapy within 6 months, ANC 
≤100 cells/μL, and receipt of immunomodulatory therapy or 
corticosteroids for at least 14 days, and these conditions were 
well-balanced between the 2 treatment groups. In fact, approxi-
mately 34% of patients in our cohort were immunocompro-
mised for other reasons. Finally, <1% of patients in our matched 
cohort had inadequate source control within 7 days, indicating 
that most patients had “uncomplicated” bacteremia. As most 
patients with retained hardware, large areas of devitalized bone, 
or infected fluid collections that we evaluated received >16 days 
of antibiotic therapy, the vast majority of patients with inade-
quate source control did not meet eligibility criteria for this study. 
Therefore, we are unable to make inferences on the optimal dur-
ation of therapy for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia for patients 
with inadequate source control. Randomized controlled trials 
that are currently enrolling patients to evaluate this question 
further may shed more light on lingering issues (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifiers NCT01737320, NCT03101072, NCT02400268).
These limitations notwithstanding, our study suggests that 
6–10 days of antibiotic treatment is not associated with either 
an increased risk of mortality or an increased odds of recur-
rent bacteremia compared with longer antibiotic treatment 
courses for uncomplicated Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia. 
Furthermore, shorter durations of therapy for uncomplicated 
Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia may protect patients from sub-
sequent antibiotic drug-resistant organisms.
