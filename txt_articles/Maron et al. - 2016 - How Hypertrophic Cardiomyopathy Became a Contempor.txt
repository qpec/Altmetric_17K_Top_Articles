Historical Perspective on the Evolution
of Treatment Modalities for HCM
Hypertrophiccardiomyopathywasfirstdescribedatautopsyin195812
and subsequently came to be regarded as the most common non-
traumatic cause of sudden death among young adults. This disease
emerged as a clinical entity largely through the work of Braunwald
etal13attheNationalInstitutesofHealthinthe10yearsfrom1958to
1968, which began the formative investigational era for HCM.
Initially, HCM was regarded as a disease of left ventricular (LV)
outflow obstruction, largely without management strategies that
couldfavorablyinfluenceitscourse.13However,theventricularsep-
talmyectomyoperationtorelieveobstructionandreverseheartfail-
ure symptoms was soon introduced first at the National Institutes
ofHealth(andselectivelyelsewhere,includingMayoClinic).14,15The
myectomyoperationwasgraduallyrecognizedasanimportanttreat-
mentforheartfailuresymptoms,15-20despiteperiodicmisguidedef-
forts that casted doubt on the pathophysiologic significance of the
subaortic gradient.21 In 1964, pharmacologic therapy to mitigate
symptomswithβ-blockerswasintroducedtopatientswithHCMby
Braunwald,5-13 and it persists as a first-line therapy, even now, and
was later followed by the calcium antagonist verapamil22 and the
negative inotrope/antiarrhythmic disopyramide.23
Beginning in the early 1990s, a few patients with nonobstruc-
tive HCM and unrelenting heart failure were referred for heart
transplantation.24However,thedevastatingandhighlyvisiblecom-
plication of unexpected arrhythmic sudden death remained, with-
out any preventive strategies, as the greatest source of anxiety
amongpatientswithHCM.1,5,25,26WhenHCMwasrecognizedasan

petitive athletes,27 expert consensus recommendations were for-
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common genetic heart disease
encumbered throughout much of its almost 60-year history by a large measure of
misunderstanding and the perception of a grim outcome without effective treatment
options. However, it is now apparent that the majority of patients affected with HCM can
achieve normal or near-normal life expectancy without disability, and usually do not require
major treatment interventions. Nevertheless, for those patients with HCM who are at risk for
(or experience) disease-related complications, a constellation of comprehensive
nonpharmacologic management strategies have evolved over the last 15 years, altering the
natural history and disease course for many, including implantable defibrillators, heart
transplant, external defibrillation/therapeutic hypothermia, advances in surgical myectomy,
and alcohol ablation. In particular, expanded contemporary risk stratification strategies have
led to a more reliable selection of patients likely to achieve primary prevention of sudden
death with implantable defibrillators. Most recently, large cohort studies using current
management strategies and therapeutic measures have shown that it is now possible to
achieve significantly improved survival with a low HCM-related mortality of 0.5% per year
across all ages, and including children and young adults characteristically with the most
aggressive disease course. These clinical management initiatives, instituted by the practicing
cardiology community, have succeeded in preserving life and restoring an active lifestyle for
thousands of patients with HCM, while providing many with a measure of reassurance and a
reasonable expectation for an extended (if not normal) life span.

Implementation of Therapies
Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator
Over the last several years, the effectiveness of major innovative
nonpharmacologic cardiovascular management strategies for
HCM have been studied in selected high-risk subsets of patients.
With drug therapy ineffective against sudden death,29 the
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was formally intro-
duced to patients with HCM 15 years ago, the results of which
were published as a retrospective multicenter study30 showing
the power of device therapy in preventing sudden death due to
ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or fibrilla-
tion) and establishing the ICD era for HCM and other genetic
heart diseases. The effectiveness of the ICD in patients with HCM
is notable given the structural and functional differences from

atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, for which the ICD was
originally designed by Mirowski and Mower.31
Several sizeable single and multicenter registry studies, largely
fromtheUnitedStates/Canada30,32-35andAustralia,36butalsofrom
Europe (ie, Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain),37-43 as
well as an international meta-analysis,38 have shown that the ICD
reliably terminated potentially lethal ventricular tachycardia or fi-
brillation and automatically restored sinus rhythm in a large num-
ber of patients of all ages with HCM, including children44-46 (10%
peryearforsecondarypreventionand4%peryearforprimarypre-
vention in adults), while also documenting the not-inconsequen-
tial risks for inappropriate shocks and other device-related compli-
cations to be weighed in any ICD decision (Figure 1).30,32-43
Furthermore, strategies for selecting the most optimal candi-
dates for primary prevention (risk stratification) have matured and
evolvedoverthelast20yearsasthedataobtainedfromlargernum-
bers of patients have been assembled and as additional markers of
risk have been added25,26,47-49 (ie, extensive late gadolinium

trast-cardiovascular magnetic resonance). However, the HCM risk

ertheless, it is clear that the translation of the ICD to HCM clinical
practice represents a paradigm change in management by altering
the clinical course of the disease for many young patients.
Myectomy
For many years, surgical septal myectomy has provided a quality-
of-lifebenefitbyreturningmostseverelysymptomaticpatientswith
HCM to a full active lifestyle, by virtue of relieving impedance to LV
outflowandmitralregurgitation,normalizingLVpressures,andcon-
sequentlyreversingheartfailuresymptoms.1,15-17,20,51-58Duringthe
last 15 to 20 years, septal myectomy has undergone a substantial
evolution. The procedure has benefited from modern myocardial
preservationandotheradvancesinsurgicaltechniques,suchasex-
tended (myectomy) resection distally and mitral valve repair with
chordal cutting, extension, or plication of the leaflets and mobiliza-
tion of the papillary muscles.15,51,52
Together, these advances have transformed septal myectomy
from a highly morbid operation with a reported mortality rate of up
to 6%14 to one of the safest open-heart procedures currently avail-
able, with a low operative mortality rate of 0.4% at experienced
centers.53 Importantly, myectomy can also convey enhanced sur-
vival equivalent to that of the general population and also reduce
theriskofsuddendeath.Long-termsurvivalfromallcausesamong
patients who have undergone a myectomy is excellent (90% at 5
yearsand83%at10years),exceedingthatamongpatientswithob-
structive HCM who have not undergone myectomy.15 Indeed, it is
reasonable to assume that heart failure would progress unchecked
(despite pharmacologic therapy) with death and/or profound dis-
ability inevitable in a substantial proportion of patients with HCM
for whom surgical myectomy (or alcohol septal ablation) were un-
available.Inthisway,surgicalmyectomyhascontributedtotheover-
all reduction in mortality attached to the disease over the last 10
years.Percutaneousalcoholseptalablationisanestablishedbutse-
lectivealternativetherapytosurgicalmyectomythathasbeenshown
to significantly reduce LV outflow gradient and heart failure
symptoms,58-67 but without a duration of follow-up comparable to
thatofsurgicalmyectomy,andwiththepersistentconcernthatthe
alcohol-induced transmural scar may be arrhythmogenic.58
Advanced Heart Failure Interventions
A heart transplant is presently the only definitive option for reliev-
ingheartfailuresymptomsandpreservinglifeforpatientswithnon-
obstructive HCM who have advanced (end-stage) disease refrac-
tory to maximum pharmacologic management.68-71 A heart
transplantforapatientwithHCMhasthecapabilityofextendinglife,
with posttransplant survival rates that exceed those among pa-
tientswithischemiccardiomyopathy(ie,1-yearsurvivalrateof85%,
5-year survival rate of 75%, and 10-year survival of 61%).71 For pa-
tients with HCM, heart transplantation can be regarded as a quali-
fied success tempered by the youthful age of many recipients rela-
tive to normal life expectancy, the long-term risks associated with
immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cancer), and the limited number of
acceptable donors.

TheinitialassessmentsoftheclinicaloutcomeofpatientswithHCM
35 to 40 years ago reported annual HCM-related mortality rates in
therangeof3%to6%3,4(Figure2).Thiswasattributabletothepau-
city of management options and also to the referral patterns to ter-
tiary centers, which were skewed by disproportionate numbers of
high-risk patients. Perhaps more than any other number intro-
duced into the HCM literature the now obsolete 5% to 6% mortal-
ity estimate per year has somehow persisted and impaired our un-
derstandingofthenaturalhistoryofHCM.Later,inthepre-ICDera,
data from less selective community-based populations created a
more realistic annual mortality rate for the disease in the range of
1.5% to 2.0% (Figure 2).72

cohortsaccordingtoageatpresentation(ie,�29years[children,ado-
lescents, and adults]; 30-59 years [midlife]; and �60 years [ad-
vanced age]) (Figure 3 and Figure 4).44-46 This combined (and now

techniques often importantly combined with therapeutic hypother-
mia to reverse out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and prevent neurologic
sequelae73(n = 30).TreatmentinterventionsforHCMoccurredinpa-
tients at relatively young ages: appropriate defibrillator discharges
(mean [SD] age, 38 [17] years); heart transplant (mean [SD] age, 40
[14] years); and myectomy/ablation (mean [SD] age, 49 [16] years).
Alowthresholdforadministeringpreventiveanticoagulantagentsto

embolic stroke–related deaths (ie, 0.4%).44-46
By virtue of introducing these treatments, it was possible to
achieve a low HCM-related mortality rate of 0.5% per year, virtu-
ally identical across the 3 age groups44-46 (10-fold less than the ini-
tial mortality estimates for patients with HCM, and 3- or 4-fold less
than during the pre-ICD era 15-20 years ago) (Figure 3). Further-
more, such management options were responsible for the preser-
vation of the lives of 161 high-risk cohort patients in whom device
therapy averted potentially life-threatening ventricular tachyar-
rhythmias (but also 412 other patients with the advantage of surgi-
cal myectomy and alcohol ablation) (Figure 4).
Overall, the 5- and 10-year mortality rates were 97% and 94%,
respectively. Survival free from HCM-related death exceeded that
expectedinthegeneralpopulation,matchedforageandsexinthose
patients presenting at 60 years of age or older, and was similar to

Therefore, in accord with US/Canada (American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association) guidelines and consensus
panels,18,19 the vast majority of vulnerable high-risk patients in the
Minneapolis-Boston cohort analysis were prospectively and reliably
selected for prophylactic ICD therapy. Of the study patients who did

Importance and Impact of Clinical Initiatives
in the Genetic Era
ThesubstantialprogressmadeinHCMmanagementdetailedherewas
directly attributable to systematically applied clinical science and re-
search intertwined with patient care, and it was driven by the ener-
gies of the practicing cardiology community. Therefore, these clini-
cal strategies for HCM are distinct from the initiatives in molecular
biology and basic science mandated by the National Institutes of
Health25yearsago,77focusinginsteadonsingledisease-causingsar-
comeremutationsandcellularmechanisms,78,79andskepticalofclini-
calriskstratificationstrategies.6-11Geneticresearchhasprovidedim-
portantinsightsintothebiologicprocessesandmolecularbasisofHCM
as a disease of the sarcomere, the identification of potential thera-
peutic pharmacologic targets, the diagnosis of phenocopies such as
Fabry disease and LAMP2 cardiomyopathy, and the possible role of
multiple sarcomere mutations.78-85 In addition, commercial genetic
testing now provides the potential to screen entire families and de-
tect gene carriers, including some who may be at risk for developing
the HCM phenotype, but also importantly, with the power of geno-
typing,toexcludeunaffectedfamilymembers.78,79However,incon-
trast to the clinical management initiatives reported here and occur-
ring over this same period of time, the single-gene mutational
hypothesis has not proved relevant for predicting clinical course for
individual patients, formulating management strategies, preventing
sudden death, or improving patient’
s quality of life.19,79-81

Final Perspectives
Recent comprehensive cohort data have underscored the range of
therapies now available to patients with HCM (Figure 5) and rede-
fined the mortality risk and potential for survival implicit in this dis-
ease.ThisparadigmhasalteredthehistoricalperceptionofHCMas
relentless and uniformly progressive, and a frequent cause of pre-
maturedeath,andalsounderscorestheunderstandingachievedre-
cently with regard to the natural history and the effectiveness of
therapeutic interventions for this inherited heart disease.
Indeed, it is time for patients and physicians to put aside old
myths and misconceptions and recognize what is possible in
HCM, thus permitting a measure of optimism to pervade this dis-
ease, which has too frequently been encumbered by negativity.
These accomplishments over the past 2 decades provide impor-
tant reassurance to many patients with HCM who can now aspire
to an acceptable quality of life and an extended (if not normal) life
span (ie, the “
dawn of a better day”cited by Dr Paolo Spirito of
Genoa, Italy).86

or even in all practices in the United States. Highly populous coun-

not be psychologically amenable to major treatment interven-
