BACKGROUND: Studies in middle-age and older (masters) athletes with 
atherosclerotic risk factors for coronary artery disease report higher coronary 
artery calcium (CAC) scores compared with sedentary individuals. Few studies 
have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes 
with a low atherosclerotic risk profile.
METHODS: We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) 
and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery 
disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized 
tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance 
imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had 
participated in endurance exercise for an average of 31±12.6 years. The majority 
(77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete.
RESULTS: Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a normal CAC 
score. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of 
any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; P=0.009) compared with 
sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units 
(11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). Male athletes demonstrated 
predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed 
predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years 
of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk 
of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis ≥50% in male athletes 
(odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval,  1.01–1.15; P=0.016); 15 (14%) 
male athletes but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement 
on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Of these athletes, 7 had a 
pattern consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with 
a luminal stenosis ≥50% in the corresponding artery.
CONCLUSIONS: Most lifelong masters endurance athletes with a low 
atherosclerotic risk profile have normal CAC scores. Male athletes are 
more likely to have a CAC score >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques 
compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of 
these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology 
of the plaques in athletes indicates potentially different pathophysiological 
mechanisms for plaque formation in athletic versus sedentary men. Coronary 
plaques are more abundant in athletes, whereas their stable nature could 
mitigate the risk of plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.

R
egular exercise confers a low risk profile for ath-
erosclerosis and is associated with a 50% reduc-
tion in adverse events from coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD).1,2 The amount of physical activity required 
to achieve these benefits is 150 minutes of moderate 
exercise per week.3–6 In contrast, some athletes engage 
in several hours of intensive training per day, exceed-
ing the daily recommendations by 10- to 15-fold, and 
many regularly participate in endurance events such as 
marathon running.
The past 2 decades have observed an exponential 
rise in the number of middle-age and older (masters) 
athletes who have exercised intensely since youth and 
who constitute an increasing proportion of partici-
pants in endurance events.7 Although ostensibly fit and 
healthy, several studies have reported high coronary ar-
tery calcium (CAC) scores8–10 and myocardial fibrosis11,12 
in such athletes. These studies generate controversy be-
cause, although exercise is associated with a reduction 
in adverse events from CAD, coronary atherosclerosis is 
also the most common cause of exercise-related sud-
den death in masters athletes.12–16 However, existing 
studies are limited by small sample sizes, focus on men 
only,8–12 and inclusion of athletes with risk factors for 
atherosclerosis.8–12 Only 1 of these major studies has 
demonstrated increased atherosclerosis in the athletes 
after adjusting for their lower Framingham risk scores.8 
Therefore, further studies are essential to address the 
controversy.17 The present study investigated the coro-
nary arteries of a large cohort of masters athletic men 
and women without established conventional risk fac-
tors for CAD who had engaged in several decades of 
endurance exercise.
METHODS
Subjects
Masters athletes were recruited from elite running and cycling 
clubs in the United Kingdom through an advertisement placed 
in a popular athletic magazine.18 Athletics Weekly is published 
in print form and online and is the world’s only weekly ath-
letics magazine, with a broad readership covering all aspects 
of athletics and affiliated endurance sports. Exclusion criteria 
included a history of CAD, family history of premature (<40 
years) CAD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (BP ≥140/≥90 
mm 
Hg), hypercholesterolemia (>5.18 mmol/L), and active 
or former smokers. Masters athletes were >40 years of age, 
ran ≥10 miles or cycled ≥30 miles per week and have con-
tinued to do so for ≥10 years, and competed in ≥10 endur-
ance events, including marathons (26.2 miles, 42.2 km), half 
marathons (13.1 miles, 21.1 km), 10 km races, or endurance 
cycling races ranging from 41.1 to 161.5 miles, 66 to 260 
km) over a 10-year period. Participants who responded to the 
advertisements by e-mail or telephone were sent a copy of 
the participant information leaflet and invited to attend for 
preliminary screening tests before recruitment.
Healthy controls were recruited through advertisements 
placed in e-mail staff bulletins at 3 large London hospitals 
and had age, sex, and Framingham 10-year CAD risk profiles 
similar to the athletes. Controls engaged in exercise (mainly 
walking, jogging, or swimming) in accordance with the physi-
cal activity recommendations for health4,19 and were subject 
to identical exclusion criteria. Written consent was obtained 
from all participants, and ethical approval was granted by the 
National Research Ethics Service and the South West-Central 
Bristol committee.
Preliminary Screening Tests
Between September 2013 and June 2016, 234 athletes and 
202 controls completed a health questionnaire and underwent 
a physical examination, 12-lead EKG, and biochemical tests, 
including a fasting blood glucose level and serum lipid profile. 
Health questionnaires inquired about demographics, car-
diac symptoms, medical history, smoking history, family history 
of cardiac disease, and exercise history. The exercise history 
included years of competitive exercise, number of competitive 
endurance events, weekly average running/cycling distances, 
and personal best times for marathons. Physical examination 
included measurement of height, weight, peripheral pulse, 
and blood pressure and auscultation of the heart.
Eighty-two (35%) athletes and 110 (54.4%) controls were 
excluded because of the presence of established risk factors 
for CAD (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). The 
final cohort consisted of 152 athletes and 92 relatively seden-
tary healthy controls, and all underwent echocardiography, a 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Although overall coronary artery calcium preva-
lence was similar between masters athletes and 
health sedentary controls, male athletes were more 
likely to have high coronary artery calcium scores 
and coronary plaques.
• Among male athletes, coronary plaques were pre-
dominantly calcified, whereas plaques in sedentary 
men were predominantly of mixed morphology, 
indicating that different pathophysiological mecha-
nisms may be responsible for plaque formation in 
athletic and sedentary individuals.
• A small proportion of athletic men showed scarring 
consistent with myocardial infarction on cardiac 
magnetic resonance imaging compared with none 
of the sedentary males.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Longstanding endurance exercise may modestly 
increase the likelihood of developing calcified coro-
nary plaques.
• Although this observation could be interpreted as 
a deleterious consequence of exercise, it is also 
possible that the calcified and stable nature of the 
plaques may mitigate the risk of plaque disruption 
and acute myocardial infarction.

cardiopulmonary exercise stress test, 24-hour Holter, a com-
puterized tomographic (CT) coronary angiogram (CTCA), and 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with late gadolin-
ium enhancement (LGE).
Transthoracic Echocardiography
Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed using a 
Philips iE33 echocardiographic machine Standard views were 
obtained to measure wall thickness and cavity size. Doppler 
measurements were performed in accordance with published 
recommendations.20
CTCA
CT calcium scoring and CTCA were performed using a 
64-slice LightSpeed VCT XTe GE scanner. SmartScore com-
mercial sortware was used for calcium scoring. For CTCA, 
prospective gating was used with a commercially available 
protocol (SnapShot Pulse, GE Healthcare) and the following 
scanning parameters: slice acquisition 64 x 0.625 mm, small-
est x-ray window, Z-coverage value of 20 mm with an incre-
ment of 20 mm, gantry rotation time of 350 ms, and a field 
of view of 25 cm. Subjects with a resting heart rate >60 beats 
per minute were given intravenous metoprolol 5 to 20 mg 
to achieve a heart rate of <60 beats per minute. In addition, 
all subjects received 2 doses of sublingual Glycerol trinitrate 
400 μg. The coronary circulation was visualized using 90 mL 
of Ioversol (Optiray 350 mg I/mL, Covidien UK) contrast (flow 
rate of 6 mL/second), followed by 100 mL of 0.9% saline. A 
scout scan was performed, followed by a prospectively gated 
calcium score scan (gantry rotation time of 350 ms, 120 kV, 
and 150 mA) from the tracheal bifurcation to the diaphragm, 
choosing 5 to 7 scan blocks (field of view, 25 cm) and a pro-
spectively gated CT coronary angiogram with tube voltage 80 
to 100 kV adapted to body size and a tube current ranging 
from 500 to 600 mA. The CTCA images were reconstructed 
with slice thickness of 0.625 mm using a medium-soft tissue 
convolution kernel. All images were transferred to an external 
workstation (ADW 4.5, GE Healthcare) for analysis.
CAC scores were plotted against published percentiles 
for age- and sex-matched cohorts.21 Plaque morphology and 
degree of coronary luminal stenosis were assessed visually per 
established guidelines22,23 and independently verified by a car-
diologist (K.F.) and radiologist (S.D) with expertise in CTCA 
who were blinded to the subject’s exercise history. An ath-
erosclerotic plaque was defined as an irregularity causing any 
degree of luminal stenosis. Luminal stenoses were graded as 
<30%, 30% to 49%, 50% to 69%, and >70%. Significant 
coronary atherosclerosis was defined as a CAC >70th percen-
tile or presence of a plaque associated with ≥50% luminal 
stenosis in a single coronary segment.
CMR Scan
CMR scans were performed using a 1.5T magnet (Avanto, 
Siemens Medical Solutions). Left ventricular (LV) and right 
ventricular function, chamber dimensions and volumes, and 
myocardial mass were assessed by cine steady-state free pre-
cession sequences. LGE images were obtained after the intra-
venous bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/Kg gadoterate meglumine 
(Dotarem) to identify regional fibrosis. Inversion times were 
adjusted to null normal myocardium, and LGE images were 
phase swapped to exclude artifact where required. LGE was 
considered to represent focal myocardial fibrosis. Significant 
LGE was reported if it was in the compacted myocardium of 
the LV, excluding right ventricular insertion point LGE, right 
ventricular free wall LGE, and trabeculae or papillary muscle 
LGE because these are considered nonspecific and less reliable 
to interpret. Reporting required the agreement of 3 cardiolo-
gists with expertise in CMR (V.M. or S.R., and J.M.) blinded to 
the status of the participant.
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed using an 
upright position with a COSMED E100w cycle ergometer 
with an incremental ramp protocol of 20 to 25 watts/min-
ute. Subjects were encouraged to exercise to exhaustion. 
Continuous 12-lead EKG was performed in all subjects. 
Myocardial ischemia was defined as ≥‒0.2 mV or horizontal 
or down sloping ST segment depression. Breath-by-breath gas 
exchange analysis was performed using a dedicated COSMED 
Quark CPEX metabolic cart as described previously.24
Twenty-Four-Hour Holter Monitoring
Twenty-four-hour ambulatory EKG monitoring was per-
formed using Lifecard CF Holters (Spacelabs Healthcare). 
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was defined as ≥3 con-
secutive broad complexes faster >120 beats per minute and 
supraventricular tachycardia as ≥5 consecutive regular nar-
row complexes >130 beats per minute.25 Sinus pauses were 
defined as >2.5 seconds.26
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean±standard deviation or n (%) 
as appropriate and analyzed using SPSS, version 22 (IBM). 
Continuous variables were tested for normality using a 
Shapiro-Wilk test. Group differences were tested with an 
independent sample t test or Mann-Whitney U test for nor-
mally and non-normally distributed variables, respectively. The 
Fishers exact test and the χ-squared test were used to assess 
categorical data. Given prior reports of sex differences in the 
cardiac implications of exercise,15,27,28 the cardiac CT, echo-
cardiographic, and CMR data were analyzed in a sex-specific 
manner.
Among masters athletes, univariable analyses were per-
formed to identify variables associated with significant CAD 
(defined as a CAC score >70th percentile or a coronary lumi-
nal stenosis >50%), including age, family history of coronary 
artery disease in the 5th to 7th decades, total serum choles-
terol, serum high-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure 
stratified by sex, and years of exercise. A multivariable logis-
tic regression model was constructed retaining all variables 
associated with CAD in the univariable analyses, including an 
interaction variable (compound of age and years of training).

respectively); 70% were men and 92% were white. 
None of the participants reported a prior history of 
cigarette smoking. There were no significant differ-
ences between athletes and controls with respect to 
age, ethnicity, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and 
Framingham 10-year CAD risk scores or a family his-
tory of CAD in the 5th to 7th decades, but controls 
had a higher body surface area compared with ath-
letes (Table 1).
Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for 
an average of 31±12.6 years. A broad range of athletic 
ability was apparent, ranging from recreational sports 
participants to previous national champions (n=16), 
world champions (n=5), and world record holders (n=2). 
The majority of athletes were runners who engaged in 
a combination of 10 k events, half marathons, and full 
marathons (77%), with a median of 13 marathon runs 
per athlete. Ten athletes had run >100 marathons. Cy-
clists comprised the remainder of the athlete group and 
competed in a median of 85 races each. Mean weekly 
training hours among athletes was 7.7±3.5 hours, with 
a median of 7 hours. Controls exercised for 1.9±0.5 
hours per week, with a median of 1.5 hours. None of 
the controls had participated in prior endurance events, 
and none had exercised for >2.5 hours of moderate 
exercise per week.
Cardiac Structure and Function
Consistent with previous studies, athletes exhibited 
larger cardiac dimensions compared with controls. The 
mean end-diastolic LV volume on CMR was 14.6% 
and 14.1% higher in male and female athletes, re-
spectively, compared with controls (P<0.0001). Both 
male and female athletes showed a 9.9% increase in 
maximal LV wall thickness compared with respective 
controls (P<0.0001). There were no differences in LV 
ejection fraction between athletes and controls, but 
athletes had a larger LV stroke volume, higher right 
ventricular ejection fraction, and superior indices of 
LV diastolic function (Table 2). Athletes also demon-
strated significantly higher peak oxygen consump-
tion compared with controls (43.3±7.2 mL/minute/
kg versus 29.9±6.6 mL/minute/kg; P<0.0001), which 
translated to a predicted peak oxygen consumption 
of 138±20.4% versus 96.5±17.6% for age and size 
(P<0.0001).
CAC Score
The majority of athletes (52% male and 78% female) 
and controls (59% male and 68% female) had a nor-
mal CAC score (0 Agatston units), and only 25 (16%) 
athletes and 18 (19.5%) controls had a CAC >70th 
percentile. Overall, there were no significant differ-
ences between athletes and controls with respect to 
the proportion with CAC=0 or CAC >70th percentile 
(Table 3). The median CAC score for both athletes and 
controls was zero.
When CAC scores were analyzed with respect to 
absolute values, male athletes revealed a higher preva-
lence of moderate to severely elevated coronary CAC 
scores ≥300; 12 (11.3%) male athletes had a CAC 
score ≥300 Agatston units versus none of the seden-
tary males (P=0.009). The median CAC score in male 
athletes with a CAC ≥1 was higher than in sedentary 
males with a CAC ≥1 (86 versus 3; P=0.02) (Figure 1). 
No differences in CAC scores were seen between ath-
letic and sedentary females (Table 3).
Coronary Plaques and Luminal 
Irregularities or Stenoses
Male athletes had a higher prevalence of coronary 
plaques compared with sedentary males (47 [44%] 
versus 12 [22%]; P=0.009). Male athletes were also 
more likely to have multiple plaques compared with 
sedentary males (Figure 2a, Table 3) and multivessel 
plaques 21.7% versus 3.7% (P=0.0024). Coronary 
plaques (calcified or noncalcified) were equally prev-
alent in the main left coronary arteries among male 
athletes and sedentary men, but athletes showed a 
more diffuse distribution of irregularities throughout 
the coronary tree that were more common in the right 
coronary artery and first diagonal branch (Figure 2b). 
Sedentary men with plaques had relatively minor lu-
minal narrowing (<30%); however, 8 (7.5%) male 
athletes had a luminal stenosis ≥50% compared with 
none of the male controls (P=0.05) (Figure 2c). Male 
runners (n=82) and cyclists (n=24) did not differ with 
respect to CAC >0 (50% versus 42%), CAC >100 Ag-
atston units (17% versus 25%), CAC >70th percentile 
(16% versus 13%), or a luminal stenosis ≥50% (8.5% 
versus 4.2%). 
There were no differences in CAC or the number of 
plaques between female athletes and their relatively 
sedentary counterparts (Table 3).
Coronary Plaque Morphology
Overall, 125 plaques were observed in the 106 male 
athletes and 54 male controls. The majority of plaques 
were calcific (80 [64%]), 39 (31.2%) were of mixed 
morphology, and 6 (4.8%) were noncalcified. Purely 
calcified plaques were more common in male athletes 
compared with sedentary males (72 [72.7%] versus 8 
[30.8%]; P=0.0002), whereas sedentary males had a 
higher prevalence of mixed morphology plaques (16 
[61.5%] versus 23 [23.2%]; P=0.0006). No differences 
in plaque morphology were discovered between ath-
letic and sedentary females (Figure 3).

Relationship Between Exercise Volume 
and Significant Atherosclerosis
We investigated the relationship between exercise dose 
and significant coronary calcification in males by com-
paring the number of males with a CAC >70th per-
centile in 4 arbitrary groups: (1) sedentary males, (2) 
males who ran <25 miles per week or cycled ≤100 km 
(62 miles) per week, (3) males who ran 25 to 35 miles 
per week or cycled 100 to 150 km per week (67–93 
miles per week), and (4) males who ran >35 miles per 
week or cycled >150 km (93 miles) per week and failed 
to find a significant relationship between exercise dose 
and CAC >70th percentile (P=0.26).
Determinants of Significant CAD
Risk factors for significant CAD among male athletes 
in univariable analyses included age (odds ratio, 1.058; 
95% confidence interval, 1.058–1.116; P=0.039) and 
years of training (odds ratio, 1.063; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.017–1.110; P=0.006). Multivariable analysis 
revealed that years of training was the only indepen-
dent variable for significant CAD in the athletic men 
(odds ratio, 1.080; 95% confidence interval, 1.014–
1.149; P=0.016).
Myocardial Fibrosis
Significant CMR LGE was observed in 15 (14.2%) 
male athletes compared with none of the male con-
trols (P=0.004). The distribution of fibrosis is shown in 
Figure 4. Seven (6.6%) male athletes showed suben-
docardial LGE (consistent with myocardial infarction), 5 
(4.7%) had a midmyocardial distribution, and 3 (2.8%) 
had an epicardial distribution. Of the 7 athletic males 
with evident myocardial infarction, 3 (42.8%) showed 
significant CAD (≥50% luminal stenosis) in the left an-
terior descending artery with corresponding myocardial 
infarction in the anterior wall. However, 4 had normal 
coronary arteries. No relationship was found between 
myocardial fibrosis and exercise intensity, years of train-
ing, or number of competitions. Only 1 female athlete 
had CMR LGE compared with none of the female con-
trols, which was subendocardial distribution in the pres-
ence of normal coronary arteries.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
Ten (9.4%) male athletes showed a single burst of 
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ranging from 5 to 
11 beats compared with none of the sedentary males. 
Of these, 3 had a subendocardial (myocardial infarc-
tion) pattern of LGE affecting the anterior wall, and all 
3 revealed ≥50% stenosis in the left anterior descend-
ing artery. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was de-
tected in just 1 female athlete who had a normal CAC, 
no evidence of luminal stenosis on CT coronary angiog-
raphy, and no evidence of LGE on CMR.
DISCUSSION
Habitual moderate physical activity is associated with 
fewer cardiac events. It is assumed that the lower risk of 
CAD in physically active individuals is through the control 
of acquired risk factors for atherosclerosis. Ultra-endur-
ance athletes have also been reported to have a greater 
vasodilatory capacity compared with sedentary individu-
als.29 In contrast, 3 previous studies have shown a higher 
burden of atherosclerosis in endurance athletes com-
pared with controls,8–10raising concerns that prodigious 
amounts of exercise may actually accelerate the coronary 
atherosclerotic process. These studies included athletes 
with established risk factors for CAD or could not ex-
clude the possibility that many of them had adopted an 
active lifestyle in middle age and had higher risk factors 
during most of their lives. Our study of lifelong masters 
athletes without conventional risk factors for CAD and 
a mean Framingham risk score of 3.4% demonstrated 
that most (61%) athletes showed no evidence of CAD. 
Also no significant differences were discovered between 
the athletes and controls with respect to the number of 
individuals with completely normal calcium scores. The 
number of male athletes with a CAC=0 in this study 
was significantly higher than in a previous study from 
Germany of 108 middle-age marathon runners of simi-
lar age but higher risk profile8 and slightly higher than 
a Dutch study of 318 asymptomatic athletic men with 
a generally low risk profile where 37% were former or 
current smokers.10 The percentage of male athletes with 
a CAC >100 Agatston units was also lower in our study 
compared with the German marathon runners (18.9% 
versus 36.1%).8 These observations suggest that the 
higher coronary calcium scores in previous studies likely 
reflected a higher atherosclerotic risk profile rather than 
a potentially deleterious exercise effect.
However, compared with sedentary men of similar 
age and a similarly low atherosclerotic risk profile, ath-
letic males in this study had a higher prevalence of high

(≥300 Agatston units) CAC scores (11.3% versus 0%), 
a greater number of atherosclerotic plaques (44.3% 
versus 22.2%), including multivessel plaques, and a 
greater proportion showed coronary luminal narrowing 
≥50% (7.5% versus 0%).
Possible Mechanisms for Increased 
Coronary Plaque Burden in Masters 
Athletes
The precise mechanisms for these observations in mas-
ters athletes are unknown. Endothelial damage from 
increased shear stress forces during exercise because of 
a hyperdynamic coronary circulation, mechanical bend-
ing of the coronary arteries during vigorous cardiac 
contraction, exercise-induced spasm of the coronary 
arteries producing nonlaminar flow, exercise-associated 
hypertension, generation of oxidative free radicals,30 
and a systemic inflammatory response from repeated 
bouts of intensive exercise31 have been suggested as 
possible factors. It is also conceivable that acutely high 
parathyroid hormone concentrations produced by ex-
ercise may accelerate coronary calcification in masters 
athletes.32 The absence of increased CAD in female 
athletes has also been reported in a recent smaller 
study27 and may be attributable to the protective effect 
of estrogens or the fact that atherosclerosis in general 
appears in females older than the female athletes as-
sessed in this study.33,34 Female athletes were 2 years 
younger than male athletes, whereas CAD generally oc-
curs 10 years later in females compared with males.28

in marathon runners showed a high prevalence of both

pared with nonrunners; however, >50% of the runners

are considered stable, less prone to rupture, and as-
sociated with a lower risk of adverse coronary events, 
including mortality.35,36 In contrast, mixed morphol-
ogy plaques, which were more common in sedentary

ing and subsequent thrombosis. These differences in 
plaque morphology suggest that the pathophysiology 
of arteriosclerosis in athletes may differ from relatively 
sedentary individuals. It has previously been shown that 
among individuals with subclinical CAD (CAC >100 Ag-
atston units), a high degree of fitness reduces the risk 
of adverse cardiac events by 75%,37 and it is possible 
that the higher coronary plaque burden in lifelong en-
durance athletes may be partly mitigated by the stable 
nature of their more calcified plaques and could explain 
the overall low risk of myocardial infarction in estab-
lished marathon runners.38
Although it is plausible that calcific plaques in mas-
ters athletes protect from acute myocardial infarction 
because of plaque rupture, the same stable calcified 
plaques may cause sufficient coronary stenosis and de-
mand ischemia to produce myocardial scarring and fatal 
arrhythmias in some athletes. Consistent with this possi-
bility is the observation of myocardial fibrosis compatible 
with a CAD pattern and nonsustained ventricular tachy-
cardia in 3 of 8 (37.5%) male masters athletes with a 
luminal stenosis ≥50%. However, 4 (60%) male athletes 
with a CAD pattern of fibrosis and 7 (70%) with nonsus-
tained ventricular tachycardia showed normal coronary 
arteries, suggesting that nonatherosclerotic mechanisms 
such as coronary spasm, increased thrombogenicity,39,40 
coronary embolic or myocarditis may also contribute to 
myocardial scarring or ventricular arrhythmias in male 
athletes engaged in lifelong endurance sports.

Relationship Between Exercise Dose and 
Coronary Calcification
The dose-response relationship between exercise and 
cardiovascular health has generated scientific and lay 
interest because increasing numbers of individuals have 
trained for and engaged in multiple endurance events. 
The Copenhagen study reported a U-shaped relation-
ship between running dose and all-cause mortality. 
Light and moderate joggers had lower all-cause mor-
tality compared with sedentary nonjoggers, whereas 
strenuous joggers who exercised ≈4 times more than 
the current recommendations for healthy physical ac-
tivity exhibited mortality rates similar to sedentary indi-
viduals.5 This study had few mortal events (n=2) among 
the most active participants and did not provide the 
precise cause of death. A 9-year prospective study of 
>1 million British women showed that women engag-
ing in daily strenuous physical activity had a higher risk 
of CAD compared with women performing strenuous 
physical activity 2 to 3 times per week. However, 25% 
of strenuously exercising women were smokers com-
pared with 14% to 16% of women performing less 
exercise, which may provide a partial explanation for 
these findings.41 In contrast, the data from the Henry 
Ford exercise testing project (The Fit study) showed that 
middle-age individuals capable of exercising to strenu-
ous workloads ≥14 METS (n=1900) showed a 60% 
reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the ref-
erence group exercising at a workload (10–11 METS) 
conventionally considered to be associated with maxi-
mal benefit.42 Similarly, a meta-analysis of population 
studies comprising >650 
000 men and women with a 
median age of 62 years (range 21–92) revealed that 
exercising ≤10 times above the recommended physical 
activity levels was not associated with increased mortal-
ity compared with individuals exercising in accordance 
with current recommendations.43 Although our study 
was not designed to measure outcomes, we could not 
demonstrate a relationship between the dose of exer-
cise and coronary atherosclerosis even among males 
who cumulatively managed mileage >1 marathon per 
week. We were also unable to show any relationship 
between exercise duration and intensity and myocardial 
fibrosis.
Limitations
As far as the authors are aware, this is the first large 
study to investigate subclinical CAD in a large cohort of 
athletes of both sexes with an otherwise low risk profile 
for atherosclerosis. However, several inherent limita-
tions warrant mention. This study was not entirely ho-
mogenous with respect to sex and included only 30% 
females, which may have reduced the power of detect-
ing any significant differences between female athletes 
and respective controls. The age range of our women 
also suggests that probably many were not menopausal 
and may have been protected from atherosclerosis. We 
cannot exclude the possibility that presumably healthy 
runners were attracted to this study because they had 
sensed some nonspecific alteration in exercise level or 
that some athletes did not fully disclose prior historical 
risk factors for CAD, such as an unhealthy diet or an 
unfavourable family history, which might have resulted 
in engagement in high-endurance exercise. Diet is a po-
tential confounder but does not feature in current con-
ventional risk stratification models such as the Fram-
ingham CAD score. Although all our athletes denied 
the use of illicit performance-enhancing drugs capable 
of accelerating atherosclerosis, we did not perform any 
laboratory investigations to exclude this possibility.
Multiple parameters were tested, and we did not 
adjust for multiple testing; thus, our significant find-
ings should be considered exploratory. It is important to 
note that the study’s cross-sectional design does not al-
low for any definitive causation effect between exercise 
and CAD or the potential downstream effects of CAD, 
such as myocardial fibrosis and arrhythmias. Long-term 
studies reporting cardiac events are not yet available in 
masters athletes. Although our study revealed a higher 
coronary plaque burden and subclinical myocardial in-
farction in men engaged in lifelong endurance athletes, 
our findings cannot necessarily be considered to reflect 
increased event rates in this cohort in the future.
CONCLUSION
The majority (60%) of middle-age lifelong masters en-
durance athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile 
had no CAC. A proportion of male athletes without 
preexisting risk factors for CAD revealed higher CAC 
scores and a greater number of atherosclerotic coronary 
plaques compared with healthy but relatively sedentary 
counterparts. The precise significance of these observa-
tions is uncertain, but differences in plaque morphol-
ogy between male athletes and sedentary men indicate 
different pathophysiological mechanisms for arterio-
sclerosis. Whereas higher CAC scores and greater coro-
nary plaques in athletic men may be interpreted as a 
deleterious effect of exercise on the coronary arteries, 
the calcific and stable nature of the plaques among ath-
letic men may also be considered as protective against 
plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction. Addi-
tional studies are required in larger cohorts to clarify the 
mechanisms and clinical relevance of our findings.
