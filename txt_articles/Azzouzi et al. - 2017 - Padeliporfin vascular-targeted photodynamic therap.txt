SUMMARY  
42 
Background 
43 
Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP), a novel tissue-preserving treatment for low-
44 
risk prostate cancer (PC), has shown favorable safety and efficacy results in single-arm Phase 
45 
I and II studies. This report presents results of a randomised, controlled, parallel-group 
46 
clinical trial of padeliporfin VTP versus the standard of care, active surveillance (AS). 
47 
Methods 
48 
Men with low-risk, localised PC (no Gleason patterns 4 or 5) and no previous treatment were 
49 
recruited from March 8, 2011 to April 30, 2013 at 47 European university centres and 
50 
community hospitals.  They were randomised (stratification by centre using balanced blocks) 
51 
to VTP or AS. VTP consisted of 4 mg/kg padeliporfin administered intravenously over ten 
52 
minutes via optical fibres inserted into the prostate to cover the desired treatment zone and 
53 
subsequent activation by laser light for 22 minutes and 15 seconds. Both groups were 
54 
followed-up for 24 months in accordance with best AS practice at the time of study design, 
55 
i.e., biopsy at 12-month intervals and prostate-specific antigen measurement and digital rectal 
56 
exam at 3-month intervals. The prespecified co-primary efficacy endpoints were histological 
57 
progression of cancer and absence of any histology result definitively positive for cancer at 
58 
Month 24.  Treatment was open-label, but primary efficacy outcomes were evaluated in a 
59 
blinded manner. 
60 
Findings 
61 
Of the 206 subjects randomised to VTP, 196 received treatment. At completion of the trial, 
62 
all 413 randomised subjects (intention-to-treat population) were analysed for efficacy. VTP 
63 
doubled time to progression (from 14·1 [95% CI: 12.9 to 23.8] months to 28·3 [95% CI: 26.0 
64 
 4 
 
to 30.6] months; p<0·0001) and reduced the progression rate to approximately one-third that 
65 
of AS (adjusted hazard ratio = 0·34; 95% CI: 0·24, 0·46; p<0·0001). VTP increased the 
66 
probability of a negative prostate biopsy at 24 months post-treatment from 13·5% (28 of 207 
67 
subjects) to 49·0% (101 of 206 subjects) (adjusted risk ratio: 3·67; 95% CI: 2·53, 5·33); 
68 
p<0·0001).  
69 
VTP was well tolerated. Genitourinary function showed transient deterioration in the VTP 
70 
group, but no significant effects were seen at Month 24. The most common AEs in the VTP 
71 
group were urinary tract infections (21 subjects) and AEs in the renal and urinary disorders 
72 
(133 subjects) and reproductive system and breast disorders system organ classes (121 
73 
subjects). The most common serious side effect was retention of urine. Typically this event 
74 
occurred on the first attempt to withdraw the urinary catheter (day-1 post-op). This was 
75 
managed with immediate re-catheterization. The timing of a second attempt at removal of the 
76 
urinary catheter was left to the discretion of the local investigator. This event occurred in 15 
77 
subjects, was severe in 3 subjects, and resolved within two months in all cases.   
78 
Interpretation 
79 
Padeliporfin VTP is a safe effective treatment for low-risk, localised PC that reduces the rate 
80 
of histological progression compared to AS. It may allow more men to consider a tissue-
81 
preserving approach and defer or avoid radical therapy.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
88 
Evidence before this study 
89 
The idea of modifying our therapeutic target from the host organ to the tumour plus a margin 
90 
has been the mainstay of surgical oncology during the latter half of the 20th century. The 
91 
principle is probably best exemplified in breast cancer, for which the previous standard of 
92 
care, the Halsted radical mastectomy, has, with time and accumulating evidence, largely been 
93 
replaced by breast preservation achieved by local excision with or without radiotherapy. We 
94 
have seen the same process in renal cancer. Radical nephrectomy is currently performed only 
95 
when partial nephrectomy and nephron preservation is neither practical nor possible. Ten 
96 
years ago it was performed in all patients. The principles behind this transition are 
97 
equivalence in terms of cancer-related outcomes but better function, greater patient 
98 
acceptability, quicker recovery, and enhanced survivorship. Prostate cancer (PC) is the only 
99 
solid organ cancer left for which this principle is not generally applied. Over the last decade 
100 
several proof-of-concept studies of focal therapy for PC have been published, but they have 
101 
typically been single-centre, small, and of relatively low quality. Having said this, these 
102 
studies demonstrated the feasibility of more targeted treatment for PC and more importantly 
103 
suggested high levels of patient acceptability because of excellent functional outcomes. More 
104 
recently we have seen registered prospective development studies and formal Phase I and 
105 
Phase II studies that demonstrate both safety and early (short-term) oncological efficacy. 
106 
These studies have been summarised in Valerio’s systematic review.   
107 
Added value of this study 
108 
 6 
 
Valerio’s systematic review identified the need for comparative studies. To our knowledge, 
109 
ours is the first such study. Because vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) is an 
110 
intervention involving both a drug (in this case, padeliporfin) and a device (laser light 
111 
introduced into the prostate), it was subject to regulatory approval as a drug through the 
112 
European Medicines Agency (EMA). A pivotal comparative study was thus necessary but 
113 
was challenging to design in a manner that would be acceptable to both patients and 
114 
clinicians and in which the same primary outcome could be assessed for both VTP and the 
115 
comparator. We had three options for the comparator: surgery, radiotherapy, or active 
116 
surveillance (AS). The first two were problematic in arriving at a primary outcome that could 
117 
be applied to both the experimental arm and the control. Surgery (radical prostatectomy) 
118 
would not be suitable for a biopsy-based outcome because there would be no prostate to 
119 
biopsy. Radiotherapy, on the other hand, would be amenable to a protocol-required biopsy, 
120 
but the histological outcome would be confounded by the necessary neoadjuvant and 
121 
adjuvant androgen suppression that comprises the standard of care. Therefore, AS was the 
122 
only comparator that could reasonably be employed over the intended time frame of the 
123 
study. The task for the EMA and the PCM301 Study Group was to determine the upper and 
124 
lower risk thresholds of this low-risk group that would define the upper and lower bounds of 
125 
the study entry criteria. These criteria had the effect of excluding, within the limits of 
126 
precision of the diagnostic methods available to us at the time, men that were at very low risk 
127 
and therefore unlikely to progress and men that were at higher risk and therefore unlikely to 
128 
be offered or indeed consent to AS.  
129 
These thresholds of low risk were in keeping with standard practice at the time of study 
130 
design. Recent publications from Scandinavia and Canada on mature AS populations have 
131 
subsequently shown that men towards the upper threshold of low-risk PC do fare worse in 
132 
progression than men with very-low-risk disease. Modern diagnostic methods, including 
133 
 7 
 
magnetic resonance imaging, allow us to identify these risk groups with considerably greater 
134 
precision today than was possible at the time when the study was being considered by the 
135 
EMA. Our results show that men with localised, low-risk PC can be treated in a way that not 
136 
only preserves their genitourinary function but also results in a lower progression rate, greater 
137 
chance of being declared disease-free, and reduction in need for whole-gland radical therapy 
138 
in the form of surgery or radiotherapy.   
139 
Implications of all the available evidence 
140 
When this study was designed, our risk stratification methods at diagnosis were poor. The 
141 
correction that was applied to mitigate the consequences of this imprecision was to offer 
142 
radical therapy to nearly all men, irrespective of attributed risk. Today we attribute risk with 
143 
greater precision using risk calculators, biomarkers, and imaging. Our study adds 
144 
considerable weight to the argument that we need to move away from a one-size-fits-all 
145 
approach to treatment and gradually replace it with a more risk-stratified approach to care. 
146 
We have AS for men at very low risk. We have radical therapy and multimodality treatments 
147 
for men at high risk for whom the consequences of treatment are matched by benefit. 
148 
Between these two extremes, we now have VTP, an intervention that preserves prostate tissue 
149 
when it is both possible and practical to do so. Given the precision of today’s risk 
150 
stratification, future research will need to explore both the patient preferences and the upper 
151 
threshold of risk (as defined by tumour grade, volume, location, multiplicity) that should 
152 
determine where the transition point exists where tissue preservation is likely to confer 
153 
diminishing returns and should be supplanted by whole-gland radical therapy.    
154 
 
155 
INTRODUCTION 
156 
 8 
 
Active surveillance (AS), a policy of delayed selective intervention, is an appropriate 
157 
therapeutic option for low-risk prostate cancer (PC) that helps to mitigate the consequences 
158 
of overtreatment.1 Most studies—though admittedly single-centre and noncomparative—have 
159 
demonstrated favorable outcomes, but AS has been associated with fairly high intervention 
160 
rates especially in cohorts with less stringent eligibility criteria.2 Intervention, or crossover to 
161 
radical treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) or systemic therapy (androgen suppression), tends 
162 
to be driven by—in descending order of frequency—pathological upgrading on repeat biopsy, 
163 
biochemical progression, and patient choice.3  
164 
Focal therapy and AS are both tissue-preserving strategies. They share the goal of preserving 
165 
prostate tissue and consequently function by delaying or avoiding radical whole-gland 
166 
treatment in men in whom it is safe to do so.4 However, focal therapy differs from AS in that 
167 
it treats disease—by the process of selective tissue ablation—above a certain risk threshold 
168 
and monitors disease below that threshold, as the latter is deemed to be clinically 
169 
insignificant. A risk-stratified clinical pathway that offers men focal therapy in a manner 
170 
complementary to AS might result in two potential benefits: a reduction in the probability of 
171 
failure or crossover to radical therapy and an increase in the proportion of men eligible and 
172 
willing to undergo a tissue-preserving treatment.  
173 
Neither focal therapy nor AS has previously been assessed in a prospective, comparative 
174 
efficacy study. Both have been assessed only in single-centre series,2,5,6 in which the 
175 
outcomes were dependent on the population studied, the diagnostic precision at baseline, the 
176 
intensity and manner of the reclassification tests, and the study duration. These limitations 
177 
challenge informed decision-making by the patient because the attributes that are most likely 
178 
to influence treatment selection are the failure rates and toxicity profiles of the two 
179 
approaches and the likelihood of avoiding radical therapy. We present the results of what is to 
180 
our knowledge both the first prospective comparative evaluation of the efficacy and safety of 
181 
 9 
 
focal therapy and the first evaluation of AS in a comparative setting—rather surprisingly 
182 
given that it is a recommended standard of care. The selective ablation in our focal therapy 
183 
arm was achieved using vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) with padeliporfin, an 
184 
agent that achieves its tissue effects nonthermally and had previously been evaluated in both 
185 
preclinical and clinical settings.7,8  
186 
METHODS 
187 
Study design and participants 
188 
Study CLIN1001 PCM301 was a randomised, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial of 
189 
padeliporfin VTP versus AS for treatment of low-risk, localised PC. Men aged ≥18 years 
190 
with low-risk, localised PC diagnosed by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy and 
191 
no previous treatment were enrolled, provided they were eligible to be exposed to a 
192 
photosensitising agent and had no contraindications to undergoing magnetic resonance 
193 
imaging (MRI).  Participants were required to have low-risk PC but not very–low-risk PC. 
194 
Men were eligible if one core of cancer that was free of Gleason patterns 4 or 5 was present 
195 
provided that the cancer core length was between 3 and 5 mm. In other words, if only one 
196 
core was positive, only Gleason pattern 3 was permitted but in order to qualify the cancer 
197 
core length had to be greater than or equal to 3mm and less than or equal to 5mm. Men with 2 
198 
or 3 cores positive were also permitted, but cancer core length could not exceed 5 mm. 
199 
Clinical stage was limited to ≤T2a (pathological or radiological up to T2c disease permitted), 
200 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤10 ng/mL, and prostate volume ≥25 and <70 cc). These 
201 
criteria were based on a study of prediction determinants prediction in AS subsequently 
202 
reported by Welty et al.9   The performance status of the subjects was not a criterion for study 
203 
inclusion.  Instead, two overarching requirements had to be satisfied: men had to have a 
204 
predicted life expectancy of 10 years or more and, in addition, had to be free of any medical 
205 
 10 
 
conditions that were deemed to be a contraindication to general anaesthesia.  Men with a 
206 
contraindication to MRI (e.g. cardiac pacemaker), factors excluding accurate reading of 
207 
pelvic MRI (e.g. bilateral hip replacements), or any condition or history of illness or surgery 
208 
that may have posed an additional risk to men undergoing VTP procedure were excluded. 
209 
Criteria for subject removal from the study were occurrence of a serious adverse event (SAE) 
210 
if recommended by the investigator, subject withdrawal, or a major protocol violation. 
211 
 
212 
The study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and according to a 
213 
written protocol approved by each centre’s ethics committee. All subjects provided written 
214 
informed consent. The trial was completed in accordance with the protocol. 
215 
 
216 
Randomisation and masking 
217 
Investigators enrolled subjects and allocated them to the VTP and AS groups in a 1:1 ratio 
218 
using a web-based randomisation system generated by the sponsor and stratified by centre 
219 
using balanced blocks of varied size (2 or 4 subjects).  Treatment was open-label (subjects 
220 
and investigational site staff were not blinded to study treatment), but primary efficacy 
221 
outcomes were evaluated in a blinded manner. 
222 
Procedures 
223 
AS was conducted according to best practice at the time of study design.10,11 It comprised a 
224 
protocol-directed biopsy at 12-month intervals and 3-monthly PSA measurement coupled 
225 
with a digital rectal exam.  
226 
The aim of VTP was to treat a complete prostate lobe. Subjects randomised to padeliporfin 
227 
VTP underwent pretreatment multiparametric MRI, which was centrally reviewed with the 
228 
 11 
 
biopsy results by a committee composed of radiologists and urologists who made detailed 
229 
recommendations on the number, length, and position of interstitial optical fibres using 
230 
treatment guidance software.8,12 The treatment-guidance software was used to generate a 
231 
light-density index (LDI; a measure of the energy exposure per unit volume of target tissue) 
232 
of >1, which had been associated with a high probability of a single-lobe ablation in earlier 
233 
studies.8 However, the urologist in charge of the treatment was allowed to adapt the treatment 
234 
recommendations to the actual volume and shape of the prostate observed on the TRUS 
235 
images at the time of the procedure.  Once the fibres were accurately positioned in the 
236 
prostate to cover the desired treatment zone, 4 mg/kg padeliporfin (Aptuit Glasgow Ltd, 
237 
Glasgow, UK) was administered intravenously over ten minutes. The drug was activated in 
238 
the treatment zone by laser light at 753 nm with a fixed power of 150 mW/cm over 
239 
22 minutes and 15 seconds, corresponding to an energy dose of 200 J/cm.13 Subjects with 
240 
bilateral cancer received a second procedure for contralateral lobe treatment. Retreatment of 
241 
lobes positive for PC at the Month 12 biopsy was permitted.  The VTP procedure was carried 
242 
out under a general anaesthetic during a 2-hour operating theatre allocation with a planned 
243 
overnight stay. The urethral catheter was removed the morning after the procedure.  
244 
For subjects in both groups, PSA was measured and digital rectal examination performed 
245 
every three months. TRUS-guided, 12-core biopsy (6 cores directed to each prostate lobe) 
246 
was performed at Months 12 and 24. Thus, the sampling density (number of cores per unit 
247 
volume of tissue) in the subjects who received VTP was greater than in those in the AS 
248 
group, particularly for VTP-treated lobe(s) with reduced volume associated with post-
249 
treatment fibrosis. Biopsy samples were read centrally by an independent pathologist blinded 
250 
to treatment assignment and local pathologist reading. An independent, blinded Outcomes 
251 
Review Panel reviewed all PSA data and TRUS-guided biopsy reports to assess these results 
252 
and determined the number and location of positive cores. In the case of discrepancy between 
253 
 12 
 
the local and central biopsy readings, the panel’s pathologist adjudicated. Any additional 
254 
radical PC treatments, metastases, evidence of T3 disease, and severe PC-related events were 
255 
recorded at Months 12 and 24.  Any man who underwent radical PC treatment without 
256 
histological progression (because of patient or physician preference) continued in the study 
257 
until the end (Month 24) and returned to standard care after that. 
258 
The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Index of Erectile 
259 
Function – 15 Questions (IIEF-15) questionnaires were administered every three months 
260 
through Month 12 and at Month 24 (and at seven days postprocedure for subjects who 
261 
received padeliporfin VTP). Validity and sensitivity of these questionnaires to detect change 
262 
in genitourinary function have been established.14,15 The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire 
263 
was administered at Month 12 and Month 24 to assess quality of life. All adverse events 
264 
(AEs) were recorded from the signing of the consent form through the end of the study 
265 
(including any occurring after the initiation of additional PC treatment). At each study visit, 
266 
the investigator questioned the subject about AEs and intercurrent illnesses since his last visit. 
267 
The questions were general, and the presence or absence of specific AEs was not solicited 
268 
from subjects. AE severity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
269 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. The investigator assessed the 
270 
relationship of each AE to the study drug (padeliporfin), device, and procedure. AEs were 
271 
coded and categorised according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
272 
(version: 18.0). Haematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis were evaluated 
273 
every three months. Troponin was measured before discharge and quantitative D-Dimer 
274 
before anaesthesia, before discharge, and at 7 days post-treatment for subjects who received 
275 
VTP. Vital signs, electrocardiogram, and physical examination were performed preprocedure 
276 
and postprocedure for subjects who received padeliporfin VTP. An independent Data Safety 
277 
Monitoring Board (composed of two urologists, a laser surgery expert, and a statistician) 
278 
 13 
 
reviewed safety data and SAE reports throughout the study and advised the sponsor on 
279 
matters of subject safety. 
280 
Outcomes 
281 
The prespecified co-primary efficacy endpoints were treatment failure (histological 
282 
progression of cancer from low to moderate or higher risk over 24 months follow-up) and 
283 
absence of definitive cancer (absence of any histology result definitively positive for cancer 
284 
at Month 24). Moderate or higher risk was defined as the observation of one of the following 
285 
events: more than three cores definitively positive for cancer when considering all 
286 
histological results available during follow-up in the study, any Gleason primary or 
287 
secondary pattern of 4 or more, at least one cancer core length >5 mm, PSA> 10 ng/mL in 
288 
three consecutive measures, any T3 PC, metastasis, PC-related death. The prespecified 
289 
secondary objective was to determine any differences between the two groups in the 
290 
following outcomes: total cancer burden in the prostate; rate of additional PC radical therapy; 
291 
rate of severe PC-related events (cancer extension to T3, metastasis, PC-related death); rate 
292 
of AEs; rate of incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and urinary symptoms. 
293 
Statistical analysis 
294 
The sample size was based on an expected rate of progression from low to moderate or higher 
295 
risk of ≥15% over 2 years in the AS group and 5% in the VTP group. Using these 
296 
assumptions, the sample size required was 400 subjects (200 subjects per group), and at least 
297 
40 events (subjects with progression of cancer) needed to be observed for the final analysis to 
298 
take place. 
299 
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3. All randomised subjects were 
300 
analysed for efficacy according to assigned treatment in an intention-to-treat analysis. 
301 
 14 
 
Treatment failure (progression) was analysed by survival analysis. Times to progression were 
302 
compared between the two treatment groups using the log-rank test and quantified using a 
303 
Cox proportional-hazards regression model to derive hazard ratios at Month 24, and  
304 
treatment group and age, number of positive cores, prostate volume, and disease status at 
305 
baseline were used as covariates. Absence of definitive cancer (positive biopsy) was analysed 
306 
as a dichotomous outcome. Proportions of subjects with observed success at Month 24 were 
307 
compared by 2-sided Pearson’s chi-square test, and odds and risk ratios were calculated. 
308 
Time to initiation of radical therapy was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-
309 
rank test was used for comparison. The mean number of positive cores and maximum cancer 
310 
core length at Months 12 and 24 were compared by Student t test. Other efficacy data were 
311 
summarised descriptively. 
312 
All subjects randomised to VTP who received any padeliporfin or initiated any study 
313 
treatment-related procedure and all subjects randomised to AS were analysed for safety by 
314 
treatment received. IIEF-15, IPSS, and EQ-5D results were analysed by analysis of 
315 
covariance. Other safety data, including, AEs, were summarised descriptively.   
316 
The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01310894).

RESULTS 
325 
Subjects were recruited from March 8, 2011 to April 30, 2013 and followed for 
326 
approximately 24 months at 47 university centres at community hospitals in ten European 
327 
countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, 
328 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). Tables showing investigational sites, principal 
329 
investigators, and numbers enrolled at each site and in each country are included in the 
330 
Appendix (pp.1-2). The study was completed on June 25, 2015, and atotal of 413 men were 
331 
enrolled: 206 randomised to the VTP group and 207 to the AS group. More subjects in the 
332 
AS group (n=6) than in the VTP group (n=17) withdrew consent before study completion. 
333 
Although unwillingness to accept randomisation to either group was an exclusion criterion, 
334 
the sponsor anticipated that subjects randomised to AS might withdraw because they had 
335 
entered the study to receive active treatment. The percentage of such withdrawals was less 
336 
than expected. Otherwise, study completion and reasons for withdrawal were similar between 
337 
the two groups (Figure 1).   
338 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between the two groups 
339 
and fit the profile of low‑risk PC patients (Table 1). Of the 206 subjects randomised to VTP, 
340 
nine did not subsequently start the VTP procedure: three who withdrew consent, three who 
341 
were excluded because for exclusion criteria (bladder cancer discovered on pretreatment 
342 
MRI, previous Gleason 3+4 biopsy, history of transurethral prostate resection), one who was 
343 
discontinued by the investigator because of noncompliance, one who had a myocardial 
344 
infarction, and one who was claustrophobic so unable to undergo the pretreatment MRI.   
345 
Of the 197 subjects who started the VTP procedure, one had an anaesthesia reaction before 
346 
receipt of any padeliporfin or laser treatment. In all, 196 subjects received initial VTP (Figure 
347 
1). Of these, 62 received subsequent contralateral treatment, 11 received retreatment, and two 
348 
 16 
 
received both contralateral treatment and retreatment. An LDI ≥1 was achieved in 252 (98%) 
349 
of 254 initial treatments of a lobe. Prostate lobes that were retreated were less likely to 
350 
achieve an LDI ≥ 1, although they were exposed to the same energy of 200 J/cm (appendix 
351 
p.2).   
352 
All 413 randomised subjects were included in the efficacy analysis (Figure 1). Padeliporfin 
353 
VTP delayed progression from low-risk to moderate or higher-risk PC and reduced the 
354 
probability of a positive biopsy results at Month 24 compared to AS (Table 2). Padeliporfin 
355 
VTP doubled time to progression from 14·1(95% CI: 12.9 to 23.8]) months to 28·3 (95% CI: 
356 
26.0 to 30.6) months (p<0·0001). The rate of progression over 24 months was reduced to 
357 
approximately one-third that of AS (adjusted hazard ratio = 0·34; 95% CI: 0·24, 0·46; 
358 
p<0·0001). The distribution of predefined progression criteria showed that padeliporfin VTP 
359 
was efficacious against the individual parameters of the composite progression endpoint. The 
360 
principal determinants of progression were Gleason grade ≥4 and increases in number of 
361 
positive cores and cancer core length, which all showed substantial reduction in the 
362 
padeliporfin VTP group. The regression coefficients showed no effect of treatment group or 
363 
baseline characteristics. Padeliporfin VTP also increased the probability of a negative Month 
364 
24 biopsy by from 13·5% (28 of 207 subjects) to 49·0% (101 of 206 subjects) (adjusted risk 
365 
ratio: 3·67; 95% CI: 2·53, 5·33); p<0·0001). Eight subjects experienced a severe PC-related 
366 
event within 24 months, but only one of the subjects who did have such an event (both T3 PC 
367 
and metastasis) was in the VTP group. This subject was probably under-staged at study entry. 
368 
His first protocol-required biopsy resulted in a Gleason upgrading that, for the purposes of 
369 
the study, constituted his first—and therefore reported—progression event. Subsequent 
370 
investigation revealed a locally advanced PC, and metastasis was detected on further staging 
371 
investigation. VTP exposure was associated with a reduction in the rate of radical therapy 
372 
compared to men allocated to AS (12 [5.8%] of 206 subjects versus 60 [29.0%] of 207 
373 
 17 
 
subjects; p<0·0001) and in time to radical therapy (p<0·0001) (Figure 2). For subjects whose 
374 
PC did not progress during the study, padeliporfin VTP also produced clinically and 
375 
statistically significant decrease compared to AS at Month 24 in all mean tumour burden 
376 
parameters: total number of positive cores (0.9 vs 2.3; p<0·0001), total cancer core length 
377 
(2.6 vs 6.8 mm; p<0·0001), and maximum cancer core length (1.6 vs 3.4 mm; p<0·0001). 
378 
Moreover, VTP produced a stable reduction in PSA of about 3 ng/mL over the course of the 
379 
study.   
380 
The nine subjects randomised to VTP but who had no treatment-related procedure were 
381 
excluded from the safety analysis (Figure 1). In the VTP group, IIEF-15 and IPSS 
382 
assessments showed transient deterioration in erectile and urinary function, but the Month 24 
383 
result was comparable between the two groups (appendix p.3). Month 24 IPSS was 6.6 
384 
(standard deviation [SD]: 5.47) for VTP and 8.2 (SD: 6.47) for AS, and Month 24 IIEF-15 
385 
was 15 (SD: 10.70) for VTP and 16.8 (SD: 11.17) for AS. These results show no significant 
386 
effect of padeliporfin VTP on genitourinary function compared to AS. The mean EQ-5D 
387 
questionnaire scores at Month 24 in both the VTP and AS groups were slightly decreased 
388 
from baseline with no difference in the two groups (82.5 [SD: 12.31] in the VTP group and 
389 
81.8 [SD: 12.09] in the AS group), indicating no decrease in quality of life associated with 
390 
VTP at Month 24 (appendix p.2). 
391 
As expected, both the incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs were higher in the VTP group 
392 
than in the AS group (Table 3). Most subjects in the VTP group experienced an AE, most of 
393 
which were mild or moderate in severity and self-limited. The most commonly reported AEs 
394 
in the padeliporfin VTP group were urinary tract infections (23 AEs in 21 [10.7%] subjects) 
395 
and AEs in the renal and urinary disorders (280 AEs in 133 [67.5%] of 197 subjects) and 
396 
reproductive system and breast disorders system organ classes (197 AEs in 121 [61.4%] of 
397 
197 subjects), and these AEs accounted for the largest differences between the treatment 
398 
 18 
 
groups. AEs related to the study drug, device, or procedure were common but generally not 
399 
severe. Most of these related AEs occurred during the procedure or in the days immediately 
400 
after the procedure and resolved quickly without sequelae. The reporting of pain that was 
401 
thought to be related to the procedure (due to the transcutaneous needle placement, due to the 
402 
swelling of the prostate or both) was captured by the term ‘perineal pain’.  This was reported 
403 
by 30 (15%) men allocated to the VTP group and by 1(0.5%) man in the AS group.  
404 
Three subjects experienced events that were more long-lasting: two with urethral strictures 
405 
requiring endoscopic dilation and one case of urinary incontinence in a subject who had 
406 
previously undergone transurethral prostatectomy (TURP). Men with a history of surgery for 
407 
benign prostatic hypertrophy (including TURP) were subsequently excluded from the study 
408 
(via protocol amendment 23 October 2012) for safety reasons. All other reports of 
409 
incontinence were self-limited, were usually urge-related and occurred in the period after 
410 
catheter withdrawal. Incontinence management was at the discretion of the investigator. The 
411 
most common related SAE in the VTP group was urinary retention. Typically this event 
412 
occurred on the first attempt to withdraw the urinary catheter (day-1 post-op). This was 
413 
managed with immediate recatheterization. The timing of a second attempt at removal of the 
414 
urinary catheter was left to the discretion of the local investigator.  All 15 retention cases 
415 
resolved within two months. No subject discontinued VTP because of an AE. Three subjects 
416 
discontinued the study because of AEs. One subject in the AS group developed ureteric 
417 
cancer. One subject in the VTP group had an anaphylactic reaction to the anaesthesia 
418 
administered at the start of the VTP procedure; he had received no padeliporfin or VTP. One 
419 
subject in the VTP group died from a myocardial infarction during mountain climbing 
420 
approximately eight months after padeliporfin VTP, and the investigator assessed the AE as 
421 
unrelated to study drug, device, or procedure. 
422 
 19 
 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board reviewed safety data approximately every 
423 
3 months throughout the study and advised the study sponsor on matters of subject safety. At 
424 
all meetings, the members unanimously agreed that no safety issues had emerged in the 
425 
study. 
426 
 
427 
DISCUSSION 
428 
VTP doubled time to progression (from 14·1 to 28·3 months), reduced the progression rate to 
429 
approximately one-third that of AS, and increased the probability of a negative prostate 
430 
biopsy at 24 months post-treatment from 13·5% to 49·0%. VTP was also safe and well 
431 
tolerated with only minor and transient deterioration in genitourinary function. Our study has 
432 
shown that partial-gland ablation by VTP influences the course of PC in the short-to-medium 
433 
term. First, the proportion of men who transition from a cancer status to cancer-free status 
434 
was increased. Second, the proportion of men who progress from a histologically defined 
435 
low-risk status to a higher one is diminished. As a result, fewer men chose to undergo radical 
436 
therapy during the study period. Moreover, these benefits were achieved safely, efficiently, 
437 
and without compromising genitourinary function when assessed at 12 and 24 months after 
438 
VTP.   
439 
Since this is the first comparative efficacy study of its type, it is important to consider the 
440 
methodological considerations that were inherent in its design and conduct. The first relates 
441 
to the population studied. By today’s standards this population might be considered low risk. 
442 
However, whilst the study was in development and being discussed with the EMA, neither 
443 
AS nor focal therapy were accepted as standard care. The EMA agreed that we could 
444 
reasonably exclude very-low-risk patients. Therefore, lower and upper thresholds of risk 
445 
(defined by Gleason pattern and tumour burden) were set, below which and above which men 
446 
 20 
 
were excluded. This low-risk group was the only one that could have been studied at the time. 
447 
Were the study designed today, given the changes to risk categorisation, it is likely that men 
448 
with well characterised PC and low volume secondary Gleason pattern 4 would be included.16  
449 
A second limitation relates to rapidly changing practice in risk stratification of PC patients, 
450 
most significantly the use of MRI in the diagnostic and the re-evaluation phases of both AS 
451 
and focal therapy.17,18 When the study began, few units offered MRI to patients on AS or as 
452 
part of the work-up for focal therapy. Now it is difficult to imagine using either strategy 
453 
without MRI. Although only men assigned to VTP had MRI in this study, images were used 
454 
only for treatment planning, not for detection or staging. The only way in which unilateral 
455 
use of MRI could have biased subjects’ allocation was the detection of colorectal or bladder 
456 
cancer, which would have triggered a study withdrawal. If the study were repeated today, 
457 
MRI would play an important role in subject selection and risk stratification for both 
458 
interventions.19  
459 
A third concern is discriminating true progression from reclassification. When using a 
460 
biopsy-based strategy to refine the risk stratification at given intervals in AS, upgrading 
461 
(transition from an exclusive Gleason pattern 3 status to one with elements of Gleason pattern 
462 
4 or 5) occurs. Determining whether the observed increase in the Gleason pattern is a 
463 
correction of inherent diagnostic imprecision or the product of true disease progression has 
464 
proved challenging. Whilst no universal definition of clinical significance exists, recently 
465 
published MRI studies have used the presence of Gleason pattern 4 as the minimum 
466 
definition of clinically significant PC.17,18 Physicians have recommended treatment upon 
467 
upgrading irrespective of its underlying cause. This strategy appears prudent given that 
468 
recently published data from two mature AS series have identified higher risk groups (within 
469 
the risk profile suitable for AS) that are at greater risk of progression.2,20,21  
470 
 21 
 
The final issue relates to the efficacy endpoints evaluated. If endpoints such as progression to 
471 
metastases or death had been used, the natural history of low-risk PC would have required a 
472 
very large study conducted over two decades. Some experts advocate prioritizing of shorter-
473 
term, relevant outcomes that are important to patients to support patients and their physicians 
474 
in their clinical decision-making.22 
475 
This multicentre study has demonstrated that padeliporfin VTP can be implemented widely 
476 
and delivered effectively and safely. The latter issue deserves some qualification. Exposure to 
477 
VTP resulted in an increase in the frequency of SAEs from 1 in 10 men on AS to 1 in 3 men 
478 
who received VTP. Most of the events were expected, genitourinary in nature, and self-
479 
limited. The most important of these events was failure to void on catheter removal (urinary 
480 
retention). The event was managed by replacement of the urethral catheter and extension of 
481 
the period of dependent urinary drainage.   
482 
It is worth noting that most study sites had no prior experience in delivering focal therapy, let 
483 
alone VTP. Study recruitment was timely over a large geographical area, a scenario that 
484 
contrasts with the many previous attempts to undertake randomised, comparative studies of 
485 
early PC treatment, which either failed to recruit completely or closed because of poor 
486 
recruitment.23 Feasibility is an important attribute for surgical interventions, and our results 
487 
demonstrate that VTP can be taught, learned, and delivered by a range of health care 
488 
providers and systems. This study was performed at a large number of centres and in a 
489 
variety of healthcare systems, few of which had any previous experience with VTP, and yet 
490 
we managed to achieve a very low rate of permanent urinary toxicity. Since our 
491 
understanding and management of early PC have changed so much in the last few years, it is 
492 
worth speculating on how padeliporfin VTP might be used with current diagnostics and risk 
493 
stratification, which are unrecognizable from those at the time of study design. Adoption of 
494 
MRI and targeted biopsy into the clinical pathway has created more precise risk stratification, 
495 
 22 
 
allowing a more nuanced approach to men with a new PC diagnosis. Given that MRI is now 
496 
widely used within the diagnostic pathway but was not used for diagnosis or risk stratification 
497 
in our study, it is worth speculating on how the diagnostic process may be influenced by the 
498 
results of this study. First, it is likely that a pathway based on MRI—because of its role as a 
499 
triage test between an elevated PSA and biopsy—will result in a reduction of the number of 
500 
men biopsied and in the proportion of men receiving the diagnosis of clinically insignificant 
501 
PC. In contrast, men with an MRI abnormality will undergo targeted biopsy (something that 
502 
was not possible without MRI), resulting in a greater sensitivity for clinically significant 
503 
disease. It is very likely that the men with clinically significant isolated lesions will be the 
504 
candidates for focal prostate therapy. Men who do not need treatment should not have it. Men 
505 
who require whole-gland treatment because of bilateral clinically significant disease should 
506 
be offered it. Men with locally advanced disease should be offered multimodality therapy. 
507 
However, men who have low-risk, localised disease can now choose, on the basis of the 
508 
evidence that our study has generated, how to approach tissue preservation.  
509 
More research is needed to address unanswered questions, the principal one being the long-
510 
term effect of tissue-preserving treatment on PC control rates. One unknown element is the 
511 
efficacy of padeliporfin VTP in eradicating cancers of different grades within the target 
512 
volume. A study in men with Gleason pattern 4 (NCT01875393) has been submitted for 
513 
publication. Another uncertainty relates to the stability of the tissue that lies beyond the 
514 
treatment zone. This question requires long-term follow-up, which has been initiated in the 
515 
men from Study CLIN1001 PCM301.
