ognitive impairment is a well-documented and problematic 
outcome for up to 80% stroke survivors.1,2 The cognitive 
domains that are commonly effected by stroke include memory, 
learning, and executive functions, which can lead to negative 
impacts on quality of life and the functional independence of 
individual stroke survivors. Currently, there are no recognized 
therapeutic options for cognitive impairment poststroke. If con-
sideration is given to available options more broadly, a signifi-
cant body of work suggests that growth hormone (GH) could 
represent a potential therapy. GH is a peptide hormone released 
from the pituitary gland. In addition to its classical actions on 
longitudinal body growth and intermediate metabolism, GH has 
been shown to improve cognition in both rodents and humans.3–5 
These procognitive effects are linked to many significant 
changes within the central nervous system, including enhanced 
neurogenesis and vasculogenesis.5–7 A distinct advantage of GH 
is its approval profile and safety. Further, a recent retrospective 
combined registry analysis of published safety data from 1988 to 
2016 on GH identified that there was no evidence to indicate that 
GH treatment increased mortality, stroke, or new malignancy.8

Background and Purpose—Cognitive impairment is a common outcome for stroke survivors. Growth hormone (GH) could 
represent a potential therapeutic option as this peptide hormone has been shown to improve cognition in various clinical 
conditions. In this study, we evaluated the effects of peripheral administration of GH at 48 hours poststroke for 28 days 
on cognitive function and the underlying mechanisms.
Methods—Experimental stroke was induced by photothrombotic occlusion in young adult mice. We assessed the associative memory 
cognitive domain using mouse touchscreen platform for paired-associate learning task. We also evaluated neural tissue loss, 
neurotrophic factors, and markers of neuroplasticity and cerebrovascular remodeling using biochemical and histology analyses.
Results—Our results show that GH-treated stroked mice made a significant improvement on the paired-associate learning 
task relative to non–GH-treated mice at the end of the study. Furthermore, we observed reduction of neural tissue loss in 
GH-treated stroked mice. We identified that GH treatment resulted in significantly higher levels of neurotrophic factors 
(IGF-1 [insulin-like growth factor-1] and VEGF [vascular endothelial growth factor]) in both the circulatory and peri-
infarct regions. GH treatment in stroked mice not only promoted protein levels and density of presynaptic marker (SYN-1 
[synapsin-1]) and marker of myelination (MBP [myelin basic protein]) but also increased the density and area coverage 
of 2 major vasculature markers (CD31 and collagen-IV), within the peri-infarct region.
Conclusions—These findings provide compelling preclinical evidence for the usage of GH as a potential therapeutic tool in 
the recovery phase of patients after stroke.

Several studies have shown the beneficial effects of GH in 
promoting cognition in several experimental contexts includ-
ing brain injury.9,10 Although modest in scope, GH has been 
examined for its ability to stimulate cognition poststroke. 
Pathipati et al,11, using an endothelin model of ischemia, exam-
ined the influence of GH delivered directly into the lateral ven-
tricle of the brain starting 4 days poststroke for 42 days. Here, 
the authors identified the ability of GH to enhance aspects of 
spatial memory, using the Morris water maze. Specifically, 
they observed an improved performance in the probe trial with 
the GH-treated stroked animals spending more time in the plat-
form zone than the non–GH-treated mice. Although promising, 
the results of Pathipati et al,11 are limited in 2 significant ways. 
First, it is not clear whether peripheral GH delivery, as would 
be required clinically, could have the same procognitive ben-
efits as when delivered intracerebroventricularly. Second, there 
is now broad consensus that classical tests of spatial working 
memory including the Morris water maze are subject to sig-
nificant interpretational challenges and where possible newer 
assessments using more translationally relevant platforms, 
such as touchscreen testing are preferred.12,13
In this study, we evaluated the effects of peripheral admin-
istration of GH on cognitive function poststroke. Specifically, 
our primary hypothesis was that stroked mice treated with 
commercially available recombinant human GH (r-hGH) at 1.4 
mg/kg body weight per day subcutaneously via mini-osmotic 
pumps for 28 days starting 48 hours poststroke would result 
in improved performance in cognition tasks relative to stroked 
non–GH-treated mice. Our secondary hypotheses were that 
r-hGH–treated stroked mice would show increased expression 
of neurotrophic factors, enhancement of neural plasticity and 
cerebrovascular remodeling, and reduced cerebral tissue loss.
Methods
The data that support the findings of this study are available from the 
corresponding author on reasonable request. A detailed methods sec-
tion is available in the online-only Data Supplement.
Ethical Statements
Animal research was undertaken in accordance to the ARRIVE 
guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments). 
Experiments were approved by the University of Newcastle Animal 
Care and Ethics Committee (A-2014-432) and conducted in accor-
dance with the New South Wales Animals Research Act and the 
Australian Code of Practice for the use of animals for scientific 
purposes.
Experimental Design
All the experimental groups are randomized, and all outcome analy-
ses were performed by independent study team members blinded to 
the treatment condition. A total of 56 mice (C57BL/6, male, 8 weeks 
old) were used in this study. Details on animal numbers for each 
experiment and inclusion/exclusion criteria are included in Figure I in 
the online-only Data Supplement. The first cohort of mice was allo-
cated for pilot study to investigate the bioactive effects of r-hGH in 
sham mice (Figure IIA in the online-only Data Supplement). The sec-
ond cohort of mice was used to investigate the effectiveness of r-hGH 
in facilitating cognitive recovery and the underlying mechanisms 
after experimental stroke (Figure 1A). Day 0, mice were subjected 
to photothrombotic occlusion or sham surgery. Day 2, mice received 
r-hGH or saline at 1.4 mg/kg body weight per day subcutaneously via 
mini-osmotic pumps for 28 days. To evaluate the effect of r-hGH on 
cognitive function, stroked mice received r-hGH or saline treatment 
were subjected to mouse touchscreen platform for paired-associate 
learning (PAL) task for 20 days (days 9–29 poststroke). Brains and 
blood samples were collected at 30 days poststroke.
Animal Surgery
Photothrombotic 
occlusion 
was 
performed 
as 
previously 
described.14–18 Mini-osmotic pump (model 2004, Alzet) placement 
was performed as previously described.19
Assessment of Cognitive Deficits
The stroked mice were subjected to a mouse touchscreen platform 
for PAL task to assess the associative memory cognitive domain.20,21
Biochemical Analysis
Protein homogenates from the peri-infarct samples were obtained as 
described.17 The serum and peri-infarct supernatants were measured 
for IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) and VEGF (vascular endo-
thelial growth factor) levels using commercially available mouse/rat 
IGF-1 Quantikine ELISA (MG100; R&D systems, MN) and mouse 
VEGF Quantikine ELISA (MMV00), respectively, according to the 
manufacturer’s instruction. Western blotting was performed as previ-
ously described.22
Histology Analysis
Cresyl violet staining was performed as described.23 For immuno-
peroxidase labeling, free-floating sections were immunostained as 
described.17 Images were acquired at ×20 using Aperio AT2 (Leica, 
Germany). ImageJ (1.50, National Institutes of Health) and Matlab 
(R2015a, MathWorks) were used to estimate tissue loss and to ana-
lyze intensity and area coverage of immunolabeling.15–18

Using preliminary data from PAL task (% correct rate; sham versus 
stroke), we obtained, SD=8.5 and an effect size of d=12. Allowing a 
type 1 error of 5%, α=0.05 with the power of 80%, and β=0.2, we 
calculated a sample size of 8 animals per group. More than 8 animals 
per group would ensure that a treatment effect will be detected, if 
present, with a >80% chance.
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean±SD and were analyzed using Prism 
for Windows Version 7.02, GraphPad Software. The primary outcome 
measurement was differences between Stroke+Saline and Stroke+r-
hGH. Data from ELISA, PAL task (final session analysis) Western 
blotting, and immunoperoxidase labeling were analyzed using 
2-tailed t test. Delta weight change, PAL task (20 sessions temporal 
analysis), tissue loss, and cumulative threshold were analyzed using 
2-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak multiple comparisons. Pearson 
correlation was used to determine the association between serum 
neurotrophic factors and cognitive performance. A P value <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.

when delivered subcutaneously via mini-osmotic pumps 
(sham+saline, n=6; sham+r-hGH, n=8; Figure II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). We measured the body 
weight weekly and presented the data as changes (delta, Δ) 
of body weight from baseline. The baseline body weight 
was 27.52±1.00 g (minimum=25.10 g; maximum=28.60 g). 
There was a significant interaction between the effect of 
time and r-hGH treatment on body weight (F(5, 60)=4.088; 
P=0.0029). We found a significant increase in serum IGF-1 
(20.7%; P=0.0388) and VEGF (49.5%; P=0.0214) levels in 
r-hGH–treated mice compared with that in saline-treated 
mice. We also found a significant 17.8% decrease in blood 
glucose (P=0.0175) levels but no changes in the liver to 
body weight ratio.
Next, we investigated the effects of r-hGH treatment after 
permanent focal cerebral ischemia (Figure 1). The baseline 
body weight was 26.95±1.99 g (minimum=23.40 g; maxi-
mum=31.10 g). There was a significant interaction between 
the effect of time and r-hGH treatment on body weight 
(F(5, 75)=7.435; P<0.0001). Post hoc analysis indicated a sig-
nificant increase in body weight between 3 and 4 weeks after 
r-hGH treatment poststroke. We found a significant increase 
in serum IGF-1 (54.2%; P<0.0001) and VEGF (21.3%; 
P=0.0072) levels in stroked mice treated with r-hGH. There

GH Treatment Improves Poststroke Cognitive 
Impairment and Reduces Tissue Loss
Mice were treated with saline (n=11) or r-hGH (n=9) 48 hours 
poststroke, followed by 7 days recovery. Then, mice were 
assessed using mouse touchscreen platform for PAL task for 
20 consecutive days. We found a significant 22.4% increase in 
percentage correct rate (P=0.0092) in r-hGH–treated stroked 
mice compared with saline at final PAL session (Figure 2A). 
A range of metrics from the PAL task were also collected for 
temporal analysis. The data were presented as 4 blocks of 
mean of 5 consecutive sessions (Figure III in the online-only

treatment (F(1, 18)=5.606; P=0.0293) and time (F(3, 54)=17.83; 
P<0.0001) on percentage correct rate. Post hoc analysis indi-
cated a significant 18% increase in percentage correct at fourth 
block after r-hGH treatment poststroke (P=0.0292). There was 
no significant effect in number of trials completed within 60 
minutes, time to complete 36 trials, repeated tasks per trials, 
correct trials completed, and correct touch latency between 
stroked mice treated with r-hGH compared with saline.
Rostral caudal analysis of tissue loss revealed a signifi-
cant effect of r-hGH treatment (F(1, 50)=5.601; P=0.0219) and 
at bregma levels (F(4, 50)=5.601; P=0.0219). Post hoc analysis 
indicated a significant 56.8% decrease in tissue loss at Bregma 
0.0 after r-hGH treatment poststroke (P=0.0094; Figure 2B).
GH Treatment Promotes IGF-1 and 
VEGF Levels Within the Peri-Infarct
The protein homogenates from the peri-infarct region of 
stroke+saline (n=8) and stroke+r-hGH (n=9) were analyzed 
along with sham+saline (n=6) using Western blotting. IGF-1 
and VEGF (and other protein markers discussed in below sec-
tions) were normalized to β-actin and were expressed as a 
fold change of mean±SD for each group relative to the mean 
of the sham+saline group. We found a significant increase

in IGF-1 (43.6%; P=0.0054; Figure 3A) and VEGF (23.8%; 
P<0.001; Figure 3B) levels within the peri-infarct in stroked 
mice treated with r-hGH compared with saline. We further 
confirmed using ELISA that r-hGH treatment poststroke sig-
nificantly increased IGF-1 (95.2%; P=0.0070; Figure 3C) 
and VEGF (77.8%; P=0.0115; Figure 3D) levels within the 
peri-infarct.
GH Treatment Promotes the Expression 
of Presynaptic and Myelin Markers 
Within the Peri-Infarct
We analyzed the protein homogenates for markers of mature 
neurons (NeuN [neuronal nuclei]), PSD-95 (postsynaptic 
density protein-95), presynaptic (SYN-1 [synapsin-1]), and 
structural component of myelin (MBP [myelin basic protein]) 
using Western blotting. There was no significant change in 
NeuN (P=0.5424) and PSD-95 (P=0.0836) levels (Figure 4A). 
r-hGH treatment poststroke significantly increased SYN-1 
(10.1%; P=0.0354) and MBP (45.4%; P=0.0414) levels 
(Figure 4B).
We further confirmed the protein data using immunohis-
tochemistry staining. Optical density of SYN-1 and MBP 
(and other staining discussed in below sections) within the 
peri-infarct was assessed using threshold analysis. In the peri-
infarct region, we found a significant increase in material 
thresholded for SYN-1 (757.1%; P=0.0032, at pixel intensity 
150; Figure 5A) and MBP (33.6%; P=0.0386, at pixel intensity 
110; Figure 5B) in stroked mice treated with r-hGH compared 
with saline. Sections were also counterstained with Cresyl 
violet for qualitative observation. For cumulative threshold 
analysis, see Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement.
GH Treatment Promotes the Expression of 
Vascular Markers CD31 and Collagen-IV
We also analyzed the protein homogenates for markers of 
vasculature (CD31 and collagen-IV) using Western blotting. 
r-hGH treatment poststroke significantly increased expres-
sion levels of CD31 (56.8%; P=0.0033) but not collagen-IV 
(P=0.1240; Figure 6A).
To assess the distribution and density of vasculature, we 
performed vessel digital reconstruction and threshold analysis 
on CD31 (Figure 6B) and collagen-IV (Figure 6C) immunos-
tained images of the peri-infarct. r-hGH treatment poststroke 
significantly increased percentage area covered by CD31+ 
(39.4%; P=0.0345) and collagen-IV+ (42.9%; P=0.0048) vas-
cular cells. We also found a significant increase in thresholded

Serum IGF-1 Positively Correlates With 
Cognitive Performance Poststroke
Pearson correlation analysis shows a significant positive corre-
lation between serum IGF-1 levels and cognitive performance 
poststroke, as indexed by percentage correct rate at final PAL 
session (r=0.5914; P(Y=0.04493X+44.24)=0.0076). There was no sig-
nificant correlation between serum VEGF levels and cognitive 
performance poststroke (r=0.398; P(Y=0.2271*X+46.01)=0.0915).
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that r-hGH delivered subcuta-
neously over a 28-day window starting 48 hours poststroke 
significantly improved performance in the PAL task, when 
compared with non–GH-treated stroked mice. We also 
provided support for our secondary hypotheses, including 
the ability of r-hGH to reduce loss of neural tissue, enhance 
expression of neurotrophic factors (IGF-1 and VEGF), and 
several markers of neural plasticity and vascular remodeling. 
We placed a particular focus on translational therapeutic con-
siderations, most notably the route of GH administration and 
mode of cognitive testing. Collectively, these positive results 
from our study reinforce the concept of using GH as a poten-
tial treatment for promoting cognition poststroke.
Clinically, cognitive impairment is a significant concern for 
stroke survivors, and much effort has been directed toward 
the development of therapeutic strategies for preventing 
cognitive decline after stroke. The evidence supporting the 
potential use of GH as a safe and effective agent to promote 
cognitive function has continued to build over recent years. 
Already, promising small clinical studies have identified the 
therapeutic use of GH in patients who have experienced trau-
matic brain injury or stroke.24–28 In the current study, we were 
motivated to extend the existing preclinical literature that 
has considered the potential procognitive effects of GH after 
stroke.11 We used the photothrombotic stroke model, useful 
for its ability to produce highly consistent and repeatable isch-
emic injury.29 Importantly, the photothrombotic stroke model 
has been reported to consistently elicit learning and memory 
deficits.30,31 To assess these deficits, we turned to touchscreen-
based assessments as these are recognized to avoid many of

the limitations associated with classical assessments.12 For 
instance, Morris water maze requires animal to swim to a hid-
den platform that is located beneath the surface of the water, 
which could be perceived as stressful situation. Chronic stress 
can have a significant impact on brain recovery and functional 
outcomes poststroke.15,17,32 Clinically, stroke is associated with 
poorer performance in multiple cognitive domains, including 
associative memory.33 Specifically, we used the PAL task that 
has been extensively studied in clinical assessment of cogni-
tion,34 and the task available for rodents is analogous to clini-
cal research.35 Beyond this clinical translation aspect, PAL 
task is recognized to assess associative memory domain. With 
respect to our results, we compared the number of correct tri-
als performed by GH- and non–GH-treated mice poststroke at 
the final session. This comparison indicated that GH-treated 
stroked mice made a significant 22.4% more correct choices 
on the PAL task relative to non–GH-treated mice, thus con-
firming our primary hypothesis.
Extending from our observations of the procognitive effects 
of GH, we also examined the impact on the neurorestorative 
effects, such as neural plasticity and cerebrovascular remod-
eling. As expected, stroke reduced NeuN, a marker of mature 
neurons, SYN-1, a presynaptic marker, PSD-95, a postsynaptic 
marker, and MBP, a marker of myelination. In support of our 
secondary hypotheses, GH treatment in stroked mice resulted 
in significantly higher protein levels of SYN-1 and MBP within 
the peri-infarct in comparison to saline treatment. These results 
were confirmed using immunohistochemistry, which revealed 
GH treatment significantly increased density of SYN-1–
positive terminals by ≈7.5-fold and a moderate 33.6% increase 
in MBP-positive structures within the motor and somatosensory 
cortices. The presence of synaptogenesis and remyelination 
poststroke after GH treatment is a critical finding, as neuroplas-
ticity is believed to play a critical role in the stroke recovery.
The effect of GH treatment poststroke on cerebrovascular 
remodeling has not previously been investigated. In the current

 Ong et al  Growth Hormone Promotes Cognition Poststroke  1265
study, we considered 2 major vasculature markers. First, CD31, 
a cell adhesion molecule secreted by endothelial cells and modu-
lates cell adhesion, endothelial cell migration, and angiogenesis. 
Second, collagen-IV
, a basal lamina protein secreted by endothe-
lial cells. Stroked mice in comparison to shams showed no change 
in both CD31 and collagen-IV vasculature protein markers within 
the peri-infarct 30 days poststroke. Studies have shown that stroke 
induces significant reduction in cerebrovascular density within the 
peri-infarct at 1 day poststroke. Interestingly, spontaneous biologi-
cal recovery occurs by gradual increase in revascularization over 
several weeks after the initial stroke.36,37 Angiogenic response is 
essential for ischemic brain repair and in poststroke brain may 
indicate a higher demand for vascular support in regions under-
going active tissue reorganization. Importantly, GH treatment 
in stroked mice increased the density and area coverage of both 
CD31 and collagen-IV–positive cells, suggesting the possibility 
of GH-induced revascularization beyond what occurs with spon-
taneous recovery. There were no significant changes in average 
diameter of vessels in GH treatment (data not shown), suggesting 
that the changes of density and area coverage observed was driven 
by an increase in the total number of vessels and increases in their 
length. It should be pointed out that the relative increase in area 
coverage for these vascular markers is ≈40%, and these are com-
paratively high figures, in terms of angiogenesis.
GH treatment resulted in several biological effects that 
are completely consistent with those reported previously 
in the literature. Notably, mice treated with GH gained a 
significant amount of weight across the treated window. 
We also identified that GH resulted in significantly higher 
circulating levels of IGF-1 and VEGF, both of which are 
known to be elevated after GH treatment. The enhancement 
of IGF-1 and VEGF apart from confirming the efficacy of 
GH treatment in this model is also of interest as higher cir-
culatory levels of these growth factors straight after stroke 
correlates with better long-term outcome in patients.38,39 
Our data suggested that higher circulatory levels of IGF-1 
is associated with better cognition in stroked mice. We also 
found a robust increase in IGF-1 and VEGF levels within 
the peri-infarct region of the brain in GH-treated stroked 
mice. One potential concern with GH treatment is its abil-
ity to promote diabetogenic effects. In the current study, we 
observed no stimulatory effects on glucose between GH- 
and non–GH-treated mice, which we think is of potential 
clinical importance.
One observation from the current study that requires con-
sideration is that stroked mice treated with GH exhibited 
significantly less tissue loss from the ipsilateral hemisphere. 
Although we cannot definitely account for these tissue gains, 
we would not be inclined to attribute them to GH-promoting 
neuronal survival within the infarct, as treatment of GH com-
menced at 48 hours poststroke at a time when most, if not 
all, neurons within the infarcted territory would have died. 
Instead, we would speculate that the greater tissue volume 
seen in GH-treated mice could be attributable to an increase 
in synaptogenesis, myelination, and vessel growth occurring 
within the ipsilateral hemisphere. However, we would also 
give consideration to glia, including astrocytes and microglia, 
as there is some evidence that these cells have significantly 
greater oxidative tolerance when compared with neurons.40,41 
It will be of considerable interest to examine in future studies, 
using an approach such as bromodeoxyuridine tagging,42 to 
specifically identify which populations are most responsible 
for the less severe levels of tissue loss observed in mice treated 
with GH and to determine the time frame in which this occurs.
There are multiple avenues to consider in terms of advanc-
ing the findings of the current study. First, with respect to 
the effects of GH on cognition, we note that we have only 
examined the associative memory cognitive domain. We 
were largely constrained to one assessment because of the 
significant time required to perform testing. Nevertheless, it 
would certainly be worthwhile for future studies to consider 
examining long-term memory and attention. Further dosing 
and timing studies on the procognitive effects of GH, such as 
how long after the cessation of the treatment do the cognitive 
enhancements persist for and specifically address whether a 
one-off or repeated administration would be required to pro-
mote cognition, are warranted.
Conclusions
We have shown that peripheral GH treatment poststroke stim-
ulates cognitive recovery, which could make GH a useful ther-
apeutic tool in the recovery phase of patients after stroke. Our 
findings of increased expression of neurotrophic factors, such 
as IGF-1 and VEGF, markers of synaptogenesis and myelina-
tion, and the formation of cerebrovascular networks confirm 
that GH has a wide range of neurorestorative effects that could 
have a potential in a clinical setting. Encouragingly, some 
small and pilot studies in humans indicate a positive outcome 
when GH treatment is used together with specific rehabilita-
tion after traumatic brain injury or stroke.24–28 The results from 
this study, supported by previous studies, suggest a rational 
for clinical intervention studies with GH after stroke.

Supplemental Methods 
Animals. C57BL/6 male mice (eight weeks old) were obtained from the Animal Services Unit 
at the University of Newcastle. Mice were maintained in a temperature (21˚C±1) and humidity 
controlled environment with food and water available ad libitum. Lighting was on a 12:12 h 
reverse light–dark cycle (lights on 19:00 h) with all procedures conducted in the dark phase. 
Mice were habituated for a minimum of seven days prior to the start of the experiment.  
Randomization and Blinding. In all instances mice were randomly allocated to experimental 
groups. All outcome analyses were performed by independent study team members blinded to 
the treatment condition. 
Photothrombotic occlusion. Photothrombotic occlusion was performed as described 
previously.1-5 Mice were anaesthetized by 2% isoflurane during surgical procedure on a 
temperature controlled (37˚C ± 1) stereotaxic frame. The skull was exposed by incision of the 
skin along the midline of the scalp. Rose Bengal (200 µl, 10 mg/ml solution in sterile saline, 
Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was injected intraperitoneally. After 8 min, the skull was illuminated for 
15 min by a 4.5 mm diameter cold light source positioned at 2.2 mm left lateral of Bregma, 
targeting the left motor and somatosensory cortices. For the sham group, the same surgical 
procedure was applied except Rose Bengal was replaced with 200 µl of sterile saline (0.9% 
NaCl, Pfizer, Australia). 
Mini-osmotic pump placement. Mini-osmotic pump (Model 2004, Alzet, USA) placement was 
performed as described.6 Mice were allowed to recover for 48 hours before mini-osmotic pump 
placement was performed. Mice were anaesthetized by 2% of isoflurane during surgical 
procedure on a temperature controlled (37˚C±1) stereotaxic frame. An incision was made in 
the skin between the scapulae and a pocket was formed by spreading the subcutaneous 
connective tissues apart. The mini-osmotic pumps were filled with 200 µl of either recombinant 
human growth hormone (r-hGH, Somatropin 10mg/1.5 mL, SciTropin A, SciGen, Australia) 
or sterile saline. The pumps deliver 0.25 µl/hr for 28 days (0.04 mg r-hGH per day). The pump 
was inserted into the pocket and skin incision was closed with sutures. Pumps were weighed 
before placement and after mice were sacrificed.

Mouse touchscreen platform for paired-associate learning task. Mouse touchscreen operant 
chambers (Fig. 2A, Campden Instruments Ltd, England) were used in the cognitive testing as 
described with modifications 7, and were conducted in a blinded and randomised manner. Mice 
were calorie restricted overnight before cognitive testing (allowed access to food after 
cognitive testing for 6 hours, between 12:00 – 18:00 h). Mice were introduced to a series of 
habituation and training tasks where they were placed in the operant chambers and trained to 
associate nosepoke touchscreen with reward liquid food delivery (strawberry milkshake). Over 
7 days all mice learnt to perform the task with a minimum correct rate of 70%. Mice then 
underwent photothrombotic occlusion surgery, followed by mini-osmotic pump placement. 
Following a recovery period of seven days, mice were introduced to the PAL task where they 
learn to associate novel objects (flower, plane and spider) with their specific locations (left, 
middle and right). At any one time point, there was two images on the screen with only one 
image presented at its correct location (S+, rewarded stimulus and S-, unrewarded stimulus) 
(Fig. 2A). When the mouse made a correct choice, S+, a tone will be triggered, the food 
receptacle was illuminated and the food reward was delivered. A period of inter-trial interval 
(ITI) of 10 seconds occurred between each task. For S- response, there was a 10 seconds time 
out and the house light was deactivated (lights on). The food receptacle was illuminated and a 
poke initiated the correction trial which displayed the same stimuli as in the previous session. 
In each PAL session, mice were required to complete 36 trials within a maximum time of 60 
minutes per day, whichever occurred first. All mice completed a total of 20 sessions. The 
primary outcome measure was percentage correct rate at final PAL session. A range of metrics 
were also collected for temporal analysis and data was presented as four blocks of mean of five 
consecutive sessions (Figure III).  
 
Tissue processing. Mice were deeply anaesthetised with sodium pentabarbitol. Blood samples 
(approximately 0.5 mL) were collected transcardially. Blood glucose was measured 
immediately using Accu-check performa glucometer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Blood 
samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then centrifuged 5000g for 5 min 
at 4°C, serum was collected and frozen in -80°C for future analyses. Following blood 
collection, mice were perfused via the ascending aorta with ice cold 0.9% saline followed by 
ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for histological analysis or with ice cold 0.1% 
diethylpyrocarbonate in 0.9% saline for biochemical analysis. For histological analysis, brains 
were dissected, post-fixed in 12.5% sucrose in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h and transferred to 
3
  
 
12.5% sucrose in PBS for storage and cryoprotection. Coronal sections of the brains were 
sectioned with a freezing microtome (Leica, North Ryde, NSW, Australia) at 30 µm. For 
biochemical analysis, brains were dissected and rapidly frozen in -80˚C isopentane. Frozen 
brains were sliced using the cryostat at the thickness of 200 µm and peri-infarct territory (2 
mm2 around infarct core) were punched using a 1 mm tissue punch (Bregma +1.0 to -1.0). 
Samples were stored frozen in -80˚C until further analysis. 
 
Protein extraction. Protein homogenates from the peri-infarct samples were obtained as 
described.4 Peri-infarct samples were sonicated in 300 µl lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS buffer pH 
7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 80 µM ammonium molybdate, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 
1 mM sodium vanadate, 5 mM b-glycerolphosphate, 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet, 1 
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablet, final concentration) and centrifuged 14,000g for 20 min 
at 4°C. Next, supernatants were collected and protein levels were estimated by using 
commercially available Pierce BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) protein assay kit 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were diluted to equalize protein 
concentrations (1.5 mg/mL), aliquoted and stored at -80˚C until further analysis. 
 
Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described.8 Peri-infarct supernatants were 
mixed with sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris, 10% glycerol, 1% DTT, 
0.1% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8). 15 µg of total tissue protein samples were electrophoresed 
to Biorad Criterion TGC Stain-Free 4–20% gels and gels were transferred to PVDF 
membranes. PVDF membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline with tween (TBST) (150 
mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 0.075% Tween-20, pH 7.5) and incubated in 5% skim milk powder in 
TBST for 1 h at 25°C. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C 
and secondary antibody for 1 h at 25°C (see Table II for antibodies concentration). In between 
each incubation step, membranes were washed in TBST. Membranes were visualized on an 
Amersham Imager 600 using Luminata Classico western blotting detection reagents. The 
density of the bands was measured using Amersham Imager 600 analysis software. 
 
Cresyl Violet staining. Cresyl Violet staining was performed as described.9 Free floating 
sections (5 sections per brain, Bregma 1.5 to -1.5) were mounted on glass slides and air-dried. 
Sections were defatted in chloroform: ethanol solution for 8 min, followed by rehydration in a 
series ethanol solutions (100, 95 and 70%). Sections were stained in Cresyl Violet solution for 
4
  
 
15 min. Sections were washed in a series of ethanol solutions (70, 95 and 100%), cleared in 
xylene and cover slipped. 
 
Immunohistochemistry. For immunoperoxidase labelling, free-floating sections were 
immunostained as described.4 All reactions for labels marker were run at the same time, with 
same reagents, at the same concentrations. Peri-infarct sections (Bregma 0.0) were incubated 
with 1% hydrogen peroxidase for 30 min at 25°C and followed by 3% horse serum for 30 min 
at 25°C. Brain sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 72 h at 4°C and followed 
by secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25°C (Table II for antibodies concentration). Next, brain 
sections were incubated for 2 h at 25°C with avidin–biotin-peroxidase complex and finally 
developed using DAB peroxidase substrate. Brain sections were washed with PBS in between 
each incubation step. After processing was complete, brain sections were mounted onto chrome 
alum-coated slides and cover slipped. 
 
Images were acquired at 20 X using Aperio AT2 (Leica, Germany). The estimated tissue loss 
area [area of contralateral hemisphere – area of ipsilateral hemisphere] was determined on 
Cresyl Violet stained sections with ImageJ software 1.50 a, NIH. The quantitative analysis was 
undertaken specifically in the peri-infarct territory as defined by 0.01 mm from infarct, the 
regions were 0.5 mm by 0.5 mm in size. For the purpose of analysis, pixel intensity level 
considered to be optimal for detecting genuine differences in immunoreactive signal was 
determined using ImageJ software to visualise thresholding of cropped regions at individual 
pixel intensities. This threshold level was used to investigate group differences for all labels. 
Figure IV shows cumulative threshold analysis performed using Matlab functions 10, 11. The 
number of pixels occurring at each of the pixel intensities was determined. The pixel intensity 
values are then rank ordered 0-255 along with the corresponding number of pixel that occur at 
each value. The cumulative threshold analysis shows the consistency of differences across the 
threshold range.   
 
The vessel digital reconstruction was performed as described 3, 5. CD31 or Collagen IV positive 
cells were isolated from the background using multi-level Otsu’s thresholding method which 
calculates the threshold that minimizes the interclass pixel intensity variance between groups. 
Using Matlab functions we determined percentage area covered by the labelling.

Supplemental Figures and Figure Legends 
 
 
Figure I. Diagram for inclusion and exclusion of mice in this study. Mice were removed 
from the study if we histologically identified that the stroke had not occurred or malfunction 
of the mini-osmotic pumps. A total of 14 sham mice were used in pilot study (Sham + Saline, 
n=6; Sham + r-hGH, n=8). A total of 17 stroke mice were used for biochemistry analysis of the 
brains (Stroke + Saline, n=8; Stroke + r-hGH, n=9). A total of 20 stroke mice were used for 
paired-associate learning (PAL) task (Stroke + Saline, n=11; Stroke + r-hGH, n=9). Blood 
samples were analysed in all included mice.

Figure II. Pilot study to validate the efficacy of r-hGH treatment in sham mice. A. 
Experimental design. All mice received a sham surgery. 48 hrs later mice were randomly 
treated with either saline or r-hGH via mini-osmotic pumps subcutaneously for 28 days. B. r-
hGH treatment significantly increased the body weight. C. r-hGH treatment significantly 
increased serum IGF-1 and VEGF levels. r-hGH treatment significantly decreased blood 
glucose levels. No significant change in percentage liver to total body weight. Mean±SD. * 
p<0.05.

Figure III. Metrics of the paired-associate learning (PAL) task. r-hGH treatment 
significantly increased percentage correct rate. While there is no statistically significant 
between treatments (saline vs r-hGH), stroked mice treated with r-hGH have the trend of 
improved cognition indexed by number of trials completed within 60 min, time to complete 36 
trials, repeated tasks per trials, number of correct trials completed and correct touch latency.
