Established during infancy, our complex gut microbial community is shaped by medical 
interventions and societal preferences, such as cesarean section, formula feeding, and 
antibiotic use. We undertook this study to apply the significance analysis of microarrays 
(SAM) method to quantify changes in gut microbial composition during later infancy 
following the most common birth and postnatal exposures affecting infant gut microbial 
composition. Gut microbiota of 166 full-term infants in the Canadian Healthy Infant 
Longitudinal Development birth cohort were profiled using 16S high-throughput gene 
sequencing. Infants were placed into groups according to mutually exclusive combina-
tions of birth mode (vaginal/cesarean birth), breastfeeding status (yes/no), and antibiotic 
use (yes/no) by 3 months of age. Based on repeated permutations of data and adjustment 
for the false discovery rate, the SAM statistic identified statistically significant changes 
in gut microbial abundance between 3 months and 1 year of age within each infant 
group. We observed well-known patterns of microbial phyla succession in later infancy 
(declining Proteobacteria; increasing Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) following vaginal 
birth, breastfeeding, and no antibiotic exposure. Genus Lactobacillus, Roseburia, and 
Faecalibacterium species appeared in the top 10 increases to microbial abundance in 
these infants. Deviations from this pattern were evident among infants with other perinatal 
co-exposures; notably, the largest number of microbial species with unchanged abun-
dance was seen in gut microbiota following early cessation of breastfeeding in infants. 
With and without antibiotic exposure, the absence of a breast milk diet by 3 months 
of age following vaginal birth yielded a higher proportion of unchanged abundance of 
Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae in later infancy, and a higher ratio of unchanged 
Enterobacteriaceae to Alcaligenaceae microbiota. Gut microbiota of infants born vagi-
nally and exclusively formula fed became less enriched with family Veillonellaceae and

Clostridiaceae, showed unchanging levels of Ruminococcaceae, and exhibited a greater 
decline in the Rikenellaceae/Bacteroidaceae ratio compared to their breastfed, vaginally 
delivered counterparts. These changes were also evident in cesarean-delivered infants 
to a lesser extent. The clinical relevance of these trajectories of microbial change is that 
they culminate in taxon-specific abundances in the gut microbiota of later infancy, which 
we and others have observed to be associated with food sensitization.

The human gut microbiome is assembled throughout infancy with 
an age-specific succession of microbes after birth. This assembly 
is characterized by increasing colonization with bifidobacteria 
and microbes belonging to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes 
phyla, and depletion of the first colonizers, Enterobacteria 
(1–7). With the introduction of solids, enrichment is also seen 
with the beta-Proteobacteria. Cesarean delivery and maternal 
intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis delay this trajectory of 
microbial deposition, while formula feeding can modify it (1, 3). 
 
As evident with outcomes of expected weight gain after birth 
(8), early presence of Enterobacteria in the gut is required for 
functions, such as infant growth. Yet, continued colonization 
with members of the Enterobacteria family versus lower enrich-
ment with Bacteroidetes has been associated with greater risk for 
adiposity in toddlers (5) and food sensitization at age of 1 year 
 
(9, 10). These observations point to the importance of trajectories 
of microbial taxon increases and decreases for normal infant 
development and freedom from disease.
Our understanding of gut microbial development comes 
mainly from descriptive studies of taxon abundance with increas-
ing infant age in the presence and absence of common perinatal 
exposures. Next generation sequencing platforms enable a more 
complete detection of microbes in infant stool samples (11) and 
have considerably advanced our knowledge on which microbial 
compositional patterns are associated with an increased risk of 
metabolic and immune-related disease (12). Yet many ques-
tions remain unanswered. How much of a deviation from the 
gut microbial succession of a vaginally born, antibiotic-free 
and breastfed infant is sufficient to predict an outcome such as 
food sensitization? What attribute of the deviation, for example, 
delayed colonization with Bacteroides species (or fewer increases 
to abundance) or continued colonization with Enterobacteria 
(or fewer reductions in abundance), is most relevant to aberrant 
infant development? Does the age-specific abundance of a gut 
microbe or the magnitude of change in microbial abundance 
equally predict food sensitization? Does the number of involved 
species constitute a risk factor in a deviation from the norm? 
The pursuit of answers to these important questions requires a 
meaningful method of quantifying trajectories of microbial taxon 
increases and decreases during infancy.
With the goal of deriving a valid measure of gut microbial 
assembly during infancy, our objective was to adapt the signifi-
cance analysis of microarrays [SAM (13)] method to characterize 
and quantify changes to gut microbial abundance in the infant gut 
over time. This was done according to the common co-occurrence 
of early perinatal interventions, using fecal samples in full-term 
infants at 3 months and 1 year of age.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Bacterial DNA was extracted from 166 paired fecal samples of full-
term infants at age 3 months (mean age 3.1 ± 0.6 months, herein-
after termed 3 months) and 1 year (mean age 11.8 ± 0.8 months, 
hereinafter called 1 year) at the Winnipeg site of the CHILD 
(Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development) cohort 
(www.canadianchildstudy.ca) (14), using the QIAamp DNA Stool 
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada), followed by MiSeq 
high-throughput 16S gene sequencing to identify individual 
microbes. Data on birth mode, infant antibiotic exposure (mater-
nal intrapartum prophylaxis and/or postnatal infant treatment 
until 3 months of age) and breastfeeding status at 3 months were 
obtained from the birth record and from maternal report. Further 
details on the study population and data sources are described in 
Azad et al. (9).
Gut microbial taxa were typically quantified as measures 
of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) relative abundance 
from sequenced fecal samples. Infants were placed into mutu-
ally exclusive groups according to combinations of common 
perinatal exposures: birth mode, feeding status and antibiotic 
treatment. We applied the SAM method to capture change in 
OTU abundance from 3 to 12 months of age within each of the 
seven strata: (i) vaginal birth, breastfed by 3 months, no antibiotic 
exposure during birth or by 3 months of age (“less disturbed”); 
(ii) vaginal birth, breastfed with antibiotic exposure; (iii) vaginal 
birth, not breastfed with antibiotic exposure; (iv) vaginal birth, 
not breastfed, no antibiotic exposure; (v) elective cesarean (with 
antibiotic prophylaxis), breastfed; (vi) elective cesarean (with 
antibiotic prophylaxis), not breastfed, and (vii) emergency cesar-
ean, breastfed. For the purposes of this study, elective cesarean 
was synonymous with scheduled cesarean section, and perinatal 
was defined as the time period from birth to 3 months. The small 
sample size for infants delivered by emergency cesarean and not 
breastfed was insufficient to run the permutations of the SAM 
method.
rationale for adapting saM to Quantify 
longitudinal changes in gut Microbiota
The SAM method was introduced and extended to gene microar-
ray studies for the purpose of better understanding mechanisms

of disease. Similar to the analysis of gut microbial abundance in 
infants, a challenging analytical feature of DNA microarrays is 
that these data consist of a much larger number of features (p) 
than the sample size N, that is, p ≫ N (15). Smaller magnitude 
changes in OTU abundance can also create “noise” and interfere 
with finding true differences. By overcoming these underlying 
issues, especially where p ≫ N, SAM has enormous potential 
in advancing the longitudinal analysis of 16S sequenced data to 
characterize microbial community development over time.
The saM Method
Significance analysis of microarrays were proposed by Tusher 
et al. (13) and later extended and developed by Storey and 
Tibshirani (16). It is a popular analytical method that searches 
for statistically significant genes associated with a phenotype of 
interest in a microarray data set (17). We used SAM to identify 
changes in OTU abundance for paired data points at 3 months 
and 1 year of infant age. OTU relative abundance is correlated 
across time within the same infants, requiring a statistical method 
that accounts for this correlation. Implementing the SAM method 
for the computational analysis of our OTU data set, enabled us to 
perform repeated permutations which accounted for the correla-
tion of OTU abundance measured at 3 months and 1 year.
Our data represent the paired measurements of OTU abun-
dance at 3 months and 1 year in 166 infants who were followed 
prospectively. While testing thousands of microbial abundance 
changes within paired OTUs simultaneously, we needed to esti-
mate an overall measure for the type 1 error in multiple hypothesis 
testing. Among the variety of methods to detect the type 1 error 
is the false discovery rate (FDR). FDR focuses on the propor-
tion of falsely statistically significant differences (15). Storey and 
Tibshirani proposed the FDR correction for the SAM method 
(16), and details on its calculation are stated in SAM technical 
details by Chu et al. (18). The SAM output reported FDR values 
for each significantly significant change in OTU abundance. We 
chose a fixed FDR value of 0.1.
We also used employed Spearman correlation to assess the 
agreement between OTU changes and the maximum SAM score 
statistic for each perinatal group.
software analysis Packages
We used R software, version 2.15.3 for executing the SAM method 
to generate SAM statistic plots for paired OTU abundance values 
within infants of each perinatal exposure group. A heat map to 
visually compare findings across exposure groups was also gener-
ated using “R.” SAS 9.3 and 9.4 were also used for data handling 
and manipulation.
resUlTs
We initially applied SAM to all 166 pairs of infants at 3 months 
and 1 year, and then to each of the 7 groups of infants strati-
fied by perinatal co-exposures. As noted, the small sample size 
for infants delivered by emergency cesarean and not breastfed 
was insufficient to run the permutations of the SAM method. 
We excluded OTUs that had very low abundance in our data, 
specifically those with a 0 relative abundance. This approach 
was previously taken by de Steenhuijsen Piters et al. (19), using 
SAM to analyze upper respiratory tract microbiota in elderly 
pneumonia patients. The reason SAM excludes 0 value is 
because it applies a logarithmic transformation to reduce skew-
ness. The resultant number of OTUs per perinatal group was 
approximately 1,000 as follows: (i) vaginal, breastfed, and no 
antibiotic use (1,124 OTUs), (ii) vaginal, breastfed, and anti-
biotic use (1,111 OTUs), (iii) vaginal, not breastfed, and antibio-
tic use (995 OTUs), (iv) vaginal, not breastfed, and no antibiotic 
use (1,094 OTUs), (v) elective CS, breastfed, and antibiotic use 
(1,069 OTUs), (vi) elective CS, not breastfed, and antibiotic 
 
use (918 OTUs), and (vii) emerg 
ency CS, breastfed, and antibi-
otic use (1,067 OTUs).
Data were visually represented as plots of SAM scores to 
show statistically significant changes in OTU relative abundance 
from 3 months to 1 year. The SAM score denotes the statistical 
significance of each OTU change and can be graphed according 
to the observed and expected score (see Figure 1). The SAM 
score plots of the lines for observed versus expected SAM scores 
allowed visual comparison of the deviation in OTU abundance 
changes, namely, which longitudinal changes were greater or 
less than expected, and which were not statistically different. 
Creating an SAM plot for each perinatal exposure grouping also 
enabled visual comparison of the shape of observed SAM score 
lines across exposure groups and against the gold standard of 
infants delivered vaginally, breastfed and not exposed to antibiot-
ics, labeled the “less disturbed group.” All perinatal exposures 
produced some deviation from the less disturbed group but the 
shape of the SAM score line for infants not breastfed was the 
most deviant.
As reported in Table 1 and Table S1 in Supplementary 
Material, the SAM score can also be quantified according to the 
total number and percent of changes to relative abundance by 
type (increasing, decreasing, and no change) for all OTUs and for 
OTUs within their phylogenetic groups (phyla). A large number 
of OTUs did not show significant changes to abundance over the 
3- to 12-month time period.
Phylum level changes according  
to Perinatal exposure groups
Infants delivered vaginally, with no antibiotic exposure and 
breastfeeding by 3 months demonstrated a 48% (28% Firmicutes 
and 11% Bacteroidetes) increase and a 16% (3% Proteobacteria 
and 9% Firmicutes) decline in OTU abundance over the next 
9–11 months. More than one-third of OTUs in these “less 
disturbed” infants did not change in abundance. Increases 
(28.5% Firmicutes and 12% Bacteroidetes) or decreases (3.5% 
Proteobacteria and 10% Firmicutes) in OTU abundance were 
slightly more common when vaginally delivered, breastfed 
infants were exposed to antibiotics by 3 months of age.
Exclusive formula feeding combined with antibiotic expo-
sure after a vaginal birth resulted in an OTU rise similar in 
proportion to “less disturbed” infants (26% Firmicutes and 11% 
Bacteroidetes), but much fewer OTUs (10%) declined in abun-
dance (2% Proteobacteria), such that 43% of OTU abundance was 
unchanged.

The proportion of unchanged OTU abundance rose further 
to 68% in vaginally delivered and formula-fed infants who had 
not been exposed to antibiotics. At 20%, the decline in total 
OTU abundance in the gut microbiota of these infants was the 
highest (4% Proteobacteria and 12% Firmicutes) and notably, for 
Bacteroidetes (4%). Only 12% of OTUs (7% Firmicutes and 3% 
Bacteroidetes) had become more abundant. In contrast to the 
other vaginally born groups, the Actinobacteria (bifidobacteria-
like microbes) rose by <1%.
Infants born by elective or emergency cesarean (and exposed 
to antibiotics) who were still being breastfed by 3 months of age 
had a similar profile, seen as a 50% (28% Firmicutes and 12%

Bacteroidetes) enrichment and at 7–8% (<1% Proteobacteria), 
 
a much lower decline in OTU abundance than vaginally delivered 
infants. Infants born by elective cesarean and not breastfed by 
3 months had the most deviant profile, with almost no increases 
or decreases in OTU abundance; although based on a comparable 
number of OTUs to other groups, these results were in a small 
number of infants. Similar to vaginally delivered infants not 
breastfed or exposed to antibiotics, these infants had the highest 
percent of unchanged OTU abundance in the Proteobacteria 
phylum. Also in these 2 groups of infants, a greater propor-
tion of Bacteroidetes OTUs were unchanged and much fewer 
Bacteroidetes species increased their abundance.
Family level changes according  
to the saM score
According to the maximum SAM score for OTU increase 
(or decrease), perinatal exposure groups were ranked from 
highest to lowest scores as follows (Table 2): breastfed after 
vaginal birth with/without antibiotic treatment, breastfed after 
cesarean delivery, and not breastfed after vaginal birth with/
without antibiotics. At the family level, percent increases to the 
abundance of Veillonellaceae and of Clostridiaceae were highly 
positively corrected with the SAM score. Infants exclusively fed 
formula at 3 months after a vaginal birth had the lowest rates of 
rising abundance of these two Firmicutes families. Enrichment 
(or depletion) of the Bacteroidaceae or Enterobacteriaceae did 
not follow the same pattern by perinatal co-exposure (data not 
shown). However, the ratio of Rikenellaceae to Bacteroidaceae 
within depleted OTUs was highly correlated with the SAM score.
Regarding OTUs that did not change in abundance (Table 2), 
high negative correlations with the SAM score were obtained 
for the fecal abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, 
and Enterobacteriaceae. Infants born vaginally and not breast-
fed at age 3 months had the lowest percentages of unchanging 
Alcaligenaceae; there was a borderline inverse correlation bet-
ween the SAM score and the Enterobacteriaceae to Alcaligenaceae 
ratio. Switching the rank order of elective versus emergency 
CS improved the statistical significance of this correlation 
(r = −0.77, p = 0.07).
Figure 2 is a conceptual representation of the aforementioned 
family level variations by perinatal co-exposure. From 3 months 
to 1 year of age, the gut microbiota of infant vaginally born and 
not breastfed became less enriched with family Veillonellaceae 
and family Clostridiaceae, and exhibited a greater decline in 
Rikenellaceae relative to Bacteroidaceae OTUs. Their fecal micro-
biota were most likely to show unchanging levels of Bacteroidaceae, 
Enterobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. Cesarean-delivered 
breastfed infants exhibited these microbial changes to an extent 
intermediate to that of vaginally born, not breastfed infants and 
vaginally born, breastfed infants.
genus level changes according  
to the saM score
As many others have done, we created a heat map of SAM 
scores by OTU genus category and perinatal exposure group 
to visually differentiate across perinatal exposures, the degree 
of OTU abundance change at the genus level (Figure 3). The 
magnitude of the SAM statistic was used to characterize the 
degree of change from the most depleted to the most enriched in 
OTU abundance. Similar to the SAM plots, infants not breastfed 
(vaginally born or delivered by elective cesarean) exhibited the 
greatest deviation of OTU depletion, enrichment, or no change 
at the genus level from the less disturbed group. Infants born by 
emergency cesarean and breastfed showed more similar changes 
to the gold standard of vaginal delivery, breastfeeding, and no 
antibiotic exposure.
Ranked by the magnitude of their SAM score in Tables 3 
and 4, we list the top 10 OTUs that rose and declined in rela-
tive abundance, respectively. For the gold standard trajectory of 
vaginally born, breasted infants not exposed to antibiotics, 
statistically significant increases in relative abundance were 
seen for lactate producers (Lactobacillus and Streptococcus) and 
lactate utilizers, Veillonella, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and 
other Lachnospiraceae. Several species of the Bacteroidaceae and 
Ruminococcaceae also increased in abundance. Reductions in 
abundance were also seen for microbes in these families, along 
with members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Uniquely in these 
infants, Fusobacterium was among the top 10 taxa that increased 
in abundance.
Maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and/or infant 
antibiotic treatment slightly modified this microbial succession, 
in that the most statistically significant changes in abundance 
were seen as enrichment with genus Bacteroides and the pep-
tostreptococci. However, the Enterobacteria also became more

abundant and reductions in several species of the Bacteroidetes 
phylum were evident.
The absence of breastfeeding by 3 months of age in vaginally 
born, antibiotic-free infants also modified this succession. Their 
fecal samples became enriched with several families of the 
Enterobacteria and depleted in members of the Bacteroidetes 
phylum. Oscillospira of the ruminococci also declined in abun-
dance. The combined effect of antibiotic exposure and absence of 
breastfeeding resulted in further changes among vaginally born 
infants. Enterobacteria increased the most in the fecal samples 
of these infants and several species of Bacteroidetes became less 
abundant.
The impact of cesarean delivery on taxon change depended on 
the delivery type. Under the scenario of emergency cesarean and 
breastfeeding by 3 months, significant increases in abundance 
were seen for streptococci and bifidobacteria, as well as for some 
Lachnospiraceae. Species in the Bacteroidetes phylum for the most 
part, declined in abundance, including members of several dif-
ferent families: Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, Odoribacteracea 
(Butyricimonas), and Porphyromonadaceae (Parabacteroides). 
Unlike for other infant groups, Enterobacteria were not among 
the top 10 of OTU abundance reductions or increases.
Infants delivered by elective cesarean who were breastfed 
exhibited a different trajectory of microbial change. In these 
infants, two species of clostridia and of Enterobacteria become 
more abundant. The lactobacilli and Bacteroides species 
declined in abundance, as did several species of lactate utilizers 
(Lachnospira, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium). Few changes to 
microbial composition from 3 months to 1 year were observed 
following elective cesarean in the absence of breastfeeding. Only 
the ruminococci rose in abundance among these infants, whereas 
genus Akkermansia and Bacteroides were depleted.
With the exception of the less disturbed group of infants, 
all breastfed infants exhibited increases to the abundance of 
bifidobacteria or related species in the Actinobacteria phylum. 
This enrichment was seen to a much lesser extent in the absence 
of breastfeeding following vaginal or elective cesarean delivery.
DiscUssiOn
In a population of 166 full-term infants, the SAM method 
proved useful in differentiating statistically significant change in 
gut microbial abundance between 3 months and 1 year of age 
according to common combinations of birth mode, antibiotic 
exposure and breastfeeding status. Breastfed infants who were 
born vaginally and not exposed to antibiotics within 3 months 
after birth, exhibited a unique trajectory of gut microbial develop-
ment in later infancy. Their gut microbiota most often showed 
significant increases to the abundance of lactate producers, such 
as lactobacilli and streptococci, and of several lactate utilizers 
belonging to genus Veillonella, genus Roseburia, and genus 
Faecalibacterium of the Firmicutes phylum. Lactate utilizers pro-
vide the host with important short-chain fatty acid metabolites, 
shown to prevent allergic disease in experimental models (20). 
Overall, the less disturbed gut microbiota in these infants exhib-
ited the highest abundance increases in the Veillonellaceae and 
Clostridiaceae families. In contrast, vaginally delivered infants not 
breastfed had the lowest rates of enrichment with Veillonellaceae 
and Clostridiaceae. Veillonella species have also been found to be 
depleted among food-sensitized infants at 14 months of age in the 
Chen et al. study (10).
As documented by many (1–7), commonly observed patterns 
of microbial succession over the first year of life are declining 
abundance of Proteobacteria, the pioneer inhabitants of the 
gut, and a gradual rise in colonization with members of the 
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Indeed, this trajectory was 
observed in the less disturbed microbiome group and other 
infants in our study. It is informative then, to learn which peri-
natal co-exposures caused a deviation from this trajectory. We 
found cesarean delivery (with antibiotic exposure) or exclusive 
formula feeding after a vaginal birth with antibiotic exposure 
did not yield the typical decline in Proteobacterial abundance 
in gut microbiota after age 3 months. Unchanging abundance 
of Enterobacteriaceae between 3 months and 1 year of age was 
highest among formula-fed infants, who had the lowest SAM 
scores, indicating the least statistically significant OTU increases 
or decreases within the perinatal groups. In our previous study, 
elevated enterobacterial colonization at 3 or 12 months of age 
was found to be a risk factor for food sensitization in the CHILD 
birth cohort; at 6 months of age, these Gram-negative bacteria 
also predict future adiposity (5, 9).
Consistent with initial depletion of Bacteroidetes after 
cesarean birth (4, 7) our cesarean breastfed infants experienced 
higher rates of increase to Bacteroidetes species abundance 
than vaginally delivered infants. Infants not breastfed after a 
vaginal birth without antibiotic exposure or after an elective 
cesarean were more likely to show unchanging fecal abundance 
of Bacteroidetes species. On the other hand, antibiotic expo-
sure in vaginally born, not breastfed infants yielded similar 
increases in Bacteroidetes abundance to the less disturbed 
group, but concurrently fewer changes to Enterobacteriaceae. 
In this group of infants, as well as in infants delivered by elec-
tive cesarean, a higher percentage of the beta-Proteobacteria, 
namely, Alcaligenaceae (or genus Sutterella), also did not change 
in abundance over the 3- to 12-month period. As noted earlier, 
beta-Proteobacteria increase their abundance in later infancy 
following the introduction of solid foods. In our previous paper, 
Alcaligenaceae were depleted in gut microbiota at 1 year among 
food-sensitized infants (9).
Unique changes to microbial composition across perinatal 
co-exposures were also evident. Only in the less disturbed 
microbiota group did the Fusobacterium microbe appear in 
the top 10 most enriched species. A common member of the 
oral microbiome, Fusobacterium, has been recently detected 
in the oral cavity of 6- and 12-month infants following the 
eruption of teeth (21). Further, increases to the abundance of 
genus Ruminococcus were the sole change in elective cesarean 
in the absence of breastfeeding. Within most other exposure 
groups, ruminococcal species both increased and decreased 
in their abundance. Yet, unchanging abundance of the family 
Ruminococcaceae was a feature of the gut microbiota of vaginally 
born infants not breastfed. Ruminococci stimulate the produc-
tion and degradation of mucin, required to maintain an intact 
microbiota-mucin barrier (22). They predominate in formula-fed

infants; in breastfed infants, their concentrations depend on the 
oligosaccharide content of breast milk (23, 24). As fiber degrad-
ers (25), they become more plentiful after infant weaning off
 
the breast (26). Previously, we observed a strong cross-sectional 
association between low levels of Ruminococcaceae and food 
sensitization at age of 1 year (9).
The SAM method identified statistically significant changes 
at the family, genus or species level that were counter to the 
overall trend for a phylum. This also occurred in infants with 
a less disturbed gut microbiome, in whom reductions in the 
Bacteroidetes phylum were seen, with Bacteroides and Rikenella 
species appearing in the top 10 statistically significant reduc-
tions. What differentiated these changes from other infants was 
the ratio of Rikenellaceae to Bacteroidaceae species within the 
Bacteroidetes phylum that declined in abundance. The ratio was 
largest among infants who were born vaginally but not breastfed 
at 3 months of age. Cesarean-delivered infants who were breast-
fed by 3 months of age had fewer reductions in Bacteroidetes 
species than the less disturbed group, but these reductions 
involved several families: Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, 
Odoribacteracea (Butyricimonas), and Porphyromonadaceae 
(Parabacteroides). Jakobsson also reported reductions in 
microbial diversity within the Bacteroidetes phylum for cesar-
ean-sectioned infants against a backdrop of rising abundance 
with infant age (7).
Employing the SAM method afforded several strengths to 
our analyses. As shown in this study, heat maps are visually 
effective in characterizing changes to microbial composition 
during infancy. Indeed, hundreds of species changes were 
evident within the less disturbed gut microbiome. Correlation 
or t-test methods to determine the statistical significance of 
these changes is computationally intensive and subject to type 
1 error. The SAM method permitted simultaneous compari-
sons among a large number OTUs that were FDR adjusted to 
identify which species changes in abundance were statistically 
significant. It also addressed the small variability inherent in 
microbial abundance during infancy through a modification of 
the t-test statistic. Within these parameters, the SAM method 
revealed that the fewest changes in microbial abundance 
occurred in infants delivered by elective cesarean and not 
breastfed, followed by infants that were not breastfed after 
vaginal delivery.
On the other hand, limitations to the SAM method included 
our inability to adjust for individual confounding factors and 
to analyze sets of multiple, correlated measures, such as sets of 
OTUs at higher taxonomic categories sharing a common bio-
logical function. The first limitation is why we grouped infants 
according to seven combinations of common birth and feeding 
exposures. While this suited our primary research question on 
the influence of concurrent early life exposures, we were unable 
to compare across infant groups or to test the independence of 
one exposure over another. Regarding the second limitation, we 
tested age-related change in abundance within each OTU, then 
collapsed findings at the phylum, family or genus level. As shown 
in other studies we have conducted, some statistical associations 
between health outcomes and changes to gut microbiota are seen 
at higher taxonomic levels, which we did not ascertain. Finally, 
these analyses were conducted within the Winnipeg site of the 
CHILD cohort, with the potential for slight differences in the co-
occurrence of perinatal exposures from the three other CHILD 
study sites.
To conclude, we assessed microbial abundance changes 
from early to late infancy in over 1,000 species found in the 
gut microbiota of infants to characterize usual trajectories of 
microbiome development following common perinatal co-
exposures. This was accomplished with the SAM permutation-
based method to simultaneously execute a large number of 
tests for statistical significance, taking into account correlation 
in OTU abundance over infant age and adjusting for multiple 
comparisons. The SAM method has potential application in 
determining the statistical significance of age-related changes 
to microbial metabolites or metabolic pathways. With an 
increased sample size and the development of statistical 
methods to determine differences between groups or indi-
vidual infants, quantifying early life changes to gut microbial 
taxon, metabolite or metabolic pathways with infant age has 
tremendous value in predicting health outcomes. Ultimately, 
the collective assessment of these microbial parameters will 
contribute to our understanding on what is normal gut micro-
bial development in infants and what deviations from normal 
development predict future disease.
