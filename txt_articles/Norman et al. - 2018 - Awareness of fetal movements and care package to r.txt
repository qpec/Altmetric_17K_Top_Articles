Summary
Background 2·6 million pregnancies were estimated to have ended in stillbirth in 2015. The aim of the AFFIRM study 
was to test the hypothesis that introduction of a reduced fetal movement (RFM), care package for pregnant women 
and clinicians that increased women’s awareness of the need for prompt reporting of RFM and that standardised 
management, including timely delivery, would alter the incidence of stillbirth.
Methods This stepped wedge, cluster-randomised trial was done in the UK and Ireland. Participating maternity 
hospitals were grouped and randomised, using a computer-generated allocation scheme, to one of nine intervention 
implementation dates (at 3 month intervals). This date was concealed from clusters and the trial team until 3 months 
before the implementation date. Each participating hospital had three observation periods: a control period from 
Jan 1, 2014, until randomised date of intervention initiation; a washout period from the implementation date and for 
2 months; and the intervention period from the end of the washout period until Dec 31, 2016. Treatment allocation 
was not concealed from participating women and caregivers. Data were derived from observational maternity data. 
The primary outcome was incidence of stillbirth. The primary analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat 
principle, with births analysed according to whether they took place during the control or intervention periods, 
irrespective of whether the intervention had been implemented as planned. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01777022.
Findings 37 hospitals were enrolled in the study. Four hospitals declined participation, and 33 hospitals were randomly 
assigned to an intervention implementation date. Between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec, 31, 2016, data were collected from 
409 175 pregnancies (157 692 deliveries during the control period, 23 623 deliveries in the washout period, and 
227 860 deliveries in the intervention period). The incidence of stillbirth was 4·40 per 1000 births during the control 
period and 4·06 per 1000 births in the intervention period (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·90, 95% CI 0·75–1·07; 
p=0·23). 
Interpretation The RFM care package did not reduce the risk of stillbirths. The benefits of a policy that promotes 
awareness of RFM remains unproven.

Introduction
Stillbirth is a pervasive problem worldwide. 2·6 million 
babies were estimated to have died in utero in 2015.1 In 
high-income countries (HICs), one in 113–769 preg-
nancies end in stillbirth after 28 weeks.2 Most stillbirths 
happen without fetal abnormality or pre-existing risk 
factors for stillbirth. The six-fold variation in the 
incidence of stillbirth in HICs, suggests that a large 
proportion of stillbirths are possibly preventable.2
Maternal perception of reduced fetal movement (RFM) 
has been identified as a potential strategy for stillbirth 
prevention. The link between RFM and stillbirth (or the 
causes of stillbirth) is clear. 30–55% of women whose 
pregnancies end in stillbirth experience RFM in the 
preceding week.3,4 RFM is also associated with fetal 
growth restriction5 and placental abnormalities in 
pregnancies that do not end in stillbirth.6,7 However, 
RFM is only modestly associated with increased risk of 
stillbirth (odds ratios [OR] 2·37–14·1),8,9 and whether 
RFM is a symptom of inevitable fetal death or whether it 
can be used as an alert to prompt action and improve 
outcome is unclear. In a Cochrane review (dominated by 
one cluster-randomised trial of 68 000 women allocated 
to formal kick counting or usual treatment10), formal fetal 
movement counting was concluded to be of uncertain 
benefit as a test of fetal wellbeing.11
Interest in RFM as a stillbirth prevention tool has 
been renewed in recent years. The arbitrary threshold of

normal movements (as used by Grant and colleagues10) is 
widely recognised as unhelpful; rather, the woman’s 
perception of RFM is important.12 Crucially, maternal 
perception of RFM can only improve outcome if action 
is taken. In Norway, as part of a seminal quality improve-
ment project, a package of care was introduced to raise 
awareness of the importance of reporting RFM, 
combined with action to detect babies that are small for 
gestational age and expedited delivery of babies at risk. 
The incidence of stillbirth decreased from 3·0 stillbirths 
per 1000 pregnancies to 2·0 stillbirths per 1000 preg-
nancies.13 Consequently, several groups have prioritised 
RFM for stillbirth research.2,14
Evidence-based and accurate information is necessary 
to improve pregnancy management, which is variable 
and often suboptimal in women with RFM.15,16 Crucially, 
proof that promoting awareness of the importance of 
RFM (in combination with appropriate management) 
has benefits is inadequate. Nevertheless, many health-
service providers incorporate fetal movement awareness 
in their stillbirth reduction strategies. The aim of the 
AFFIRM study was to formally evaluate, in a randomised 
trial, a package of care that included awareness-raising 
of the importance of RFM in pregnant women and 
clinicians, combined with an improved assessment of 
fetal wellbeing and expedited delivery where the benefits 
were likely to outweigh the risks. We tested the hypothesis 
that the introduction of a RFM care package would alter 
the incidence of stillbirth.
Methods
Study design and participants
This continuous recruitment short exposure, stepped 
wedged, cluster-randomised trial was done in public 
maternity hospitals and maternity units in the UK and 
Ireland. All maternity hospitals in Scotland were expected 
to join, whereas hospitals in England, Wales, and Ireland 
joined voluntarily. A complete list of trial investigators and 
coordinators for the AFFIRM study is provided in the 
appendix.
Ethics approval was obtained from the Scotland 
A Research Ethics Committee (Ref 13/SS/0001). The 
committee agreed that individual patient consent was 
not required. The trial protocol has been published.17
Participating hospitals largely followed a so-called 
shared care model provided by midwives and obstetricians. 
All participating hospitals agreed to participate before the 
study started, and formal written consent was obtained 
from hospital research and development departments, 
with input from the lead obstetric clinician in each 
participating hospital. Data were collected for all women 
delivering in participating maternity hospitals during the 
study period. No women were excluded other than those 
who asked to be withdrawn from routine data collection. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Awareness of reduced fetal movement (RFM) is promoted to 
reduce stillbirth, but the evidence to support the effect of 
RFM awareness is uncertain. We searched PubMed in 2013, 
and updated the search on March 23, 2018, using the terms 
“reduced fetal movement” AND “randomised trials” OR 
“systematic review”. We found one systematic review 
evaluating routine fetal movement counting compared with 
mixed or undefined fetal movement counting, but there were 
no differences in the incidence of stillbirth or perinatal mortality 
between the groups. All the data to inform this finding came 
from a single cluster-randomised trial of 68 654 women, with a 
standard mean difference in incidence of stillbirth per cluster of 
0·23 per 1000 (95% CI –0·61 to 1·07), with a trend to higher risk 
in the intervention clusters.
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to combine 
RFM as an alert with an intervention designed to reduce the risk 
of stillbirth, and the largest study of fetal movement awareness 
to date. In a stepped wedge, cluster-randomised trial 
of 409 175 pregnancies, we showed that a package of care for 
pregnant women and clinicians to raise awareness of the 
importance of RFM, combined with a fuller assessment of fetal 
wellbeing and expedited delivery (where the benefits were 
likely to outweigh the risks), had no significant effect on the risk 
of stillbirth. The incidence of stillbirth at or beyond 24 weeks’ 
gestation was 4·06 per 1000 livebirths during the intervention 
period and 4·40 per 1000 livebirths during the control period 
(adjusted odds ratio 0·90, 95% CI 0·75–1·07; p=0·232). 
Our secondary outcomes include a surrogate of stillbirth, 
the proportion of babies at or below the 10th centile of 
gestationally adjusted birthweight delivered at 40 weeks or 
more. This stillbirth surrogate was lower in the intervention 
group (3461 [1·5%] events of 227 860 births) than the control 
group (3081 [2·0%] of 157 692; p=0·001). This potential 
benefit has to be set against the higher frequency of caesarean 
section (64572 [28·4%] of 227 860 births during the 
intervention period vs 40 231 [25·5%] of 157 692 births during 
the control period; p<0·001] and induction rates (83 499 
[40·7%] of 227 860 vs 49 952 [35·9%] of 157 692; p=0·001).
Implications of all the available evidence
RFM awareness is not supported by the research to date. Future 
research should include completion of other ongoing fetal 
movement awareness studies and a meta-analysis of data from 
all studies combined. An economic analysis of these data will 
supply additional evidence on the effectiveness of RFM 
awareness as a stillbirth reduction strategy, the costs, and any 
effects of increased rates of intervention. Such evidence will 
help policy makers make informed decisions about how RFM 
awareness might fit into a stillbirth reduction strategy.

Individual women were not asked for consent to treatment 
allocation.
Randomisation and masking
Hospitals (each representing a cluster in the design) 
were grouped before randomisation, each with a sum of 
about 17 000 deliveries annually, with alignment by 
geographical location to minimise contamination 
(appendix).
Clusters were randomised before the beginning of the 
trial, using a computer-generated allocation scheme, to 
one of nine intervention implementation dates. This 
timing was concealed from clusters and the trial team 
until 3 months before the implementation date. Three to 
five clusters were randomised at each timepoint. No 
attempt was made to conceal treatment allocation from 
women or clinicians.
Procedures
Each participating hospital had three observation periods: 
the first from Jan 1, 2014, until randomised date of 
intervention initiation (the control period); the second 
from the initiation date and for 2 months (the washout 
period); and the third from the end of the washout period 
until Dec 31, 2016 (the intervention period). Comparisons 
of pregnancy outcomes for births during the control 
period and the intervention period were used to 
determine the effectiveness of the intervention.
The trial intervention included an e-learning education 
package for all clinical staff in participating hospitals 
about the importance of a recent change in the frequency 
of fetal movements and how to manage RFM, a leaflet 
for pregnant women (usually distributed to women at 
about 20 weeks’ gestation). A management plan for 
identification and delivery of babies at high risk was 
distributed to hospitals for management of women who 
presented with RFM from 24 weeks’ gestation. The 
e-learning education package was created by colleagues 
in National Health Service (NHS) Education Scotland 
who had expertise in postgraduate clinician education. 
A link to the e-learning package was emailed to all 
clinicians in the participating unit about 1 month 
before the intended implementation of the package. 
The management plan for identification and delivery of 
babies at high risk included cardiotocography (within 2 h 
of presentation), measurement of liquor volume (within 
12 h of presentation), and a growth scan to estimate fetal 
weight and abdominal circumference on the next 
working day (unless this latter had been done within the 
preceding 3 weeks). We encouraged maternity units to 
use umbilical artery Doppler in addition to the growth 
scan if such facilities were available. Delivery (with senior 
clinician input into decision making) was recommended 
for women who were at or after 37 weeks’ gestation with 
any of estimated fetal weight below the 10th centile, 
abdominal circumference below the 10th centile, a liquor 
volume in which the deepest pool was less than 2 cm, 
abnormal carditocograph, or recurrent RFM. Manage-
ment of other scenarios was as indicated in the appendix 
and in the protocol,17 with senior clinician input for 
women at less than 37 weeks’ gestation who had 
additional risk factors on investigation.
Outcome data, potential confounders, and effect 
modifiers were derived from routinely collected hospital 
data (database codes are described in the appendix). Data 
were anonymised at the source and transferred at yearly 
intervals by secure file transfer to a dedicated AFFIRM 
project area in the NHS Scotland electronic Data Research 
and Innovation Service (eDRIS),18 where statistical analysis 
was done at the end of the study. We used the Intergrowth 
international standards19 to define growth centiles. 
Additional detail, reported to comply with the RECORD 
statement, is supplied in the appendix.20 No attempt was 
made to assess safety or adverse events in real time.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the incidence of 
stillbirth (babies delivered without signs of life after less 
than 24 weeks’ gestation, or, if gestation was unknown, 
weighing 500 g or more). Pre-specified secondary out-
comes were stillbirth at 37 weeks’ gestation and above; 
stillbirth at 28 weeks’ gestation and above (WHO definition 
of stillbirth); stillbirth at 22 weeks’ gestation and above 
(international stillbirth alliance definition); still 
births 
among healthily formed infants of 22 weeks’ gestation and 
above, 24 weeks’ gestation and above, 28 weeks’ gestation 
and above, and 37 weeks’ gestation and above; perinatal 
mortality (defined as stillbirth at 24 weeks’ gestation and 
above and deaths in the first 7 days of life); number of 
caesarean sections; induction of labour (for any indication); 
number of elective deliveries (induction of labour and 
caesarean section before the onset of labour) overall; 
induction of labour at 39 weeks’ gestation or later; mean 
gestation at induction of labour; number of admissions 
to the neonatal unit (and their reasons); number of 
admissions to the neonatal unit for more than 48 h; 
number of admissions to the neonatal unit for term babies 
(those born at 37 weeks 0 days or greater); proportion of 
infants with birthweight less than the tenth centile, 
customised for sex, remaining undelivered at or after 
40 weeks’ gestation; birthweight centile (according to the 
Intergrowth birthweight centile calculator); and number of 
spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Other secondary outcomes 
were the baby parameters: gestation at birth; proportion of 
babies born preterm (<37 weeks’ gestation); sex of the 
baby; birthweight of the baby; Apgar score at 5 min; pro-
portion of babies with 5 min Apgar score less than 7; 
proportion of babies with 5 min Apgar score less than 4; 
and resuscitation required at birth.17
Statistical analysis
Our pre-planned sample size was sufficient to show a 
reduction in the incidence of stillbirth of at least 25%, 
as described in the appendix and in the protocol.17

In practice, we anticipated a stillbirth risk reduction 
of 30% on the basis of findings by Tveit and colleagues13 
in Norway.
The primary analysis was done according to the 
intention-to-treat principle, with births analysed accor-
ding to whether they took place during the control or 
intervention periods, irrespective of whether the inter-
vention had been implemented as planned. Secondary 
on-treatment analyses assigned a birth to the control 
period if a site was non-adherent to the AFFIRM 
intervention at the time of the birth.
Stillbirth outcomes were summarised as the number of 
stillbirths per 1000 livebirths. Binary outcomes were 
analysed by generalised linear mixed model logistic 
regression to estimate the adjusted OR (aOR) and 95% CI 
for the intervention period versus the control period. A 
random effect was included for cluster, and the intervention 
and study time periods were fixed effects. We also adjusted 
for maternal age and multifetal pregnancies as potential 
confounders. Absolute and relative risk differences were 
calculated to help interpret the results. Continuous 
outcomes were analysed using a normal linear mixed 
model with the same structure, the intervention effect 
being expressed as the adjusted mean difference and 
95% CI. The full statistical analysis plan is described in the 
appendix. There was no planned imputation of missing 
values, with the exception of smoking status during 
pregnancy. When missing, this information was imputed 
using smoking status in early pregnancy.
Adherence to the intervention (a potential effect 
modifier) was categorised as a binary variable on the 
basis of results of a questionnaire sent to the lead 
investigator. We asked whether the site had implemented 
the e-learning education package for staff, issued RFM 
leaflets to pregnant women, and implemented any of the 
other three specific aspects of the management plan in 
line with the protocol. Sites that largely implemented at 
least four of five of these aspects of the AFFIRM 
intervention were categorised as adherent, and those 
sites that had implemented less than four of the aspects 
were categorised as non-adherent. We also asked about 
the timing of implementing the intervention. In an on-
treatment analysis, we considered (simultaneously) 
insufficient implementation of the intervention through-
out the trial as well as sufficient implementation of the 
intervention but not at the assigned time.
We used SAS version 9.4 for all statistical analyses. 
This trial is registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01777022.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The corresponding author had full 
access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
37 maternity hospitals were enrolled in the study (figure). 
Four hospitals withdrew before the study control period 
and provided no data. The reasons for withdrawal 
were lack of staff (largely lack of sonographer time, but 
also concerns about midwifery and obstetrician time) 
and cost implications (again, largely around perceived 
additional ultrasound scanning costs). 33 maternity 
hospitals were randomised to an implementation date. 
Data from 409 175 women delivering in the remaining 
33 hospitals between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, were 
included in the primary intention-to-treat analysis. No 
woman asked for her data to be excluded, and there were 
no other deviations from the protocol other than

The incidence of stillbirth at or beyond 24 weeks was 
4·06 per 1000 births during the intervention period and 
4·40 per 1000 births during the control period 
(aOR 0·90, 95% CI 0·75–1·07; p=0·232; table 2). The 
intervention had no significant effect on the incidence 
of stillbirths when using alternative gestational age 
thresholds for stillbirth or restricting stillbirths to 
normally formed infants, and we found no effect on 
perinatal mortality (table 2). Induction of labour and 
caesarean section (secondary outcomes) were more 
common during the intervention period than during 
the control period (table 3). Admissions to the neonatal 
unit were similar during both periods, although more 
babies were admitted for more than 48 h during the 
intervention period than during the control period 
(table 3).

The incidence of preterm births and number of 
preterm babies were similar during both periods, but the 
mean gestational age of birth was slightly lower in the 
intervention group (adjusted mean difference –0·35 days,

1000 livebirths), giving aOR 0·88 (95% CI 0·76–1·02). In 
the on-treatment analysis, we found no significant 
difference between groups in the incidence of births of 
babies that were small for gestational age. During the 
intervention period, 2120 of 141 480 newborn babies 
(1·5%) were small for gestational age, compared with 
4636 of 252 377 newborn babies (1·9%) during the control 
period (p=0·153; appendix). The effect of the intervention 
in the compliant and non-compliant groups is described 
in the appendix.
Discussion
A package of interventions with strategies for increasing 
pregnant women’s reporting when they perceive RFM, 
combined with a management plan to identify and 
minimise further risk, including early delivery where 
relevant, did not reduce the incidence of stillbirth at or 
beyond 24 weeks’ gestation or perinatal mortality. The 
intervention increased the frequency of labour induction 
and birth by caesarean section and prolonged neonatal 
unit admission period.
In preparation for this study, we completed a literature 
review in which we found no other randomised trial that 
had assessed RFM as an alert of increased stillbirth in 
combination with a management plan to refine and or 
reduce the risk. The strengths of our study are that it was 
conducted with little evidence of bias and a low potential 
for unmeasured confounding. We adjusted for the 
potential confounders of maternal age, number of babies 
in the pregnancy, time (ie, month and year of birth), and 
(in Scotland only) deprivation. We were unable to adjust 
for other potential confounders (eg, other maternal 
characteristics). Importantly, very few data were missing 
in our primary outcome or in variables we used in 
adjustment. Misclassification (at least for the primary 
outcome) is likely to be negligible.21
AFFIRM was a population-based study of women 
delivering in regional hospitals. Eligibility did not change 
over time, and the study analysis adjusted for any secular 
trend in frequency of stillbirth, so we believe the risk of 
unmeasured confounding is small. Generalisability of 
the study (at least in the UK) is demonstrated by similar 
incidence of stillbirth in participating hospitals as that 
calculated for the UK as a whole by the MBRRACE UK 
investigators 4·73 stillbirths per 1000 livebirths in 2014; 
vs 4·56 per 1000 livebirths in 2015 vs 4·52 per 
1000 livebirths in 2016).
This study has limitations. Although more than 
400 000 women were included, a 30% reduction in the 
incidence of stillbirth was the smallest effect size we 
could expect to detect. Our sample size was informed by 
the expected effect size from previous data.13 Although 
the apparent trend toward a 10% relative risk reduction 
in stillbirth (five fewer stillbirths per 10 000 [range 11 fewer 
to three more]) might be considered to conceal a small 
true benefit, we detected no trend toward reduced 
perinatal mortality overall (OR 0·98), not even when the 
analysis was restricted to normally formed infants. 
Further limitations are that the intervention package 
might not have been sufficiently effective to initiate 
behaviour change in clinicians and in pregnant women. 
Adherence was imperfect, with 13 maternity centres 
(39·4%) adhering to four or fewer of the five components 
of the intervention. Our assessment of adherence is also 
subject to recall and reporting bias by local principal 
investigators.
This study will re-ignite the controversy about the 
efficacy of RFM awareness to reduce stillbirth and the 
underlying mechanisms linking RFM and stillbirth. 
With a population of more than 400 000 women, we 
showed that RFM awareness did not significantly reduce 
the risk of stillbirth. It is possible that the absence of a 
significant reduction in stillbirth risk is because RFM is a 
symptom of inevitable fetal death, irrespective of any 
subsequent action. If so, it will never be possible to 
use RFM as an alert to prompt action and improve 
outcome, and no strategy around RFM awareness will be 
effective in reducing the risk of stillbirth. We believe this 
possibility is small because of the reduction in the 
incidence of babies born small for gestational age (a 
group of babies at high risk for stillbirth) who were not 
born until or after 40 weeks’ gestation in the intervention 
group. This reduction in babies born small for gestational 
age is consistent with the concept that AFFIRM correctly 
identified a group of high-risk babies with placental 
insufficiency, achieved timely delivery, and prevented 
stillbirth. About 23% of stillbirths in high-income 
countries are attributable to small size for gestational age 
(<10th centile).22 Our use of the Intergrowth international 
standards19 to define growth centiles led to 5% of babies 
overall being defined as below the 10th centile for 
gestational age. This proportion is similar to those found 
in other resource-rich countries such as New Zealand, 
Germany, and Sweden.23,24

Mean differences (intervention–control) were calculated after adjusting for maternal age, number of babies in the pregnancy, study time periods, and cluster. Data are 
missing for estimated gestation (4307 [1·1%]), estimated gestation for inductions only (3566 [2·7%]), and for birthweight centile 6735 [1·7%]).

Several other similar trials are underway, including 
the My Baby’s Movements trial in Australia and 
New Zealand, and the Mindfetalness study25 in Sweden, 
with an estimated combined sample size of 300 000. 
Meta-analysis of the data from these studies (either 
conventional or using individual patient data) will 
increase the power to detect (or exclude) a smaller effect 
size. Future research directions will best be informed by 
summary data from all these trials combined. In the 
meantime, we plan an economic analysis of the effect of 
the AFFIRM intervention.
Although we found no significant effect of the 
intervention on the risk of stillbirth, it did increase the 
frequency of birth by induced labour (at term and overall) 
and caesarean section, and it was associated with 
prolonged (>48 h) duration of admission to the neonatal 
unit. Mean gestation decreased, but the incidence of 
prematurity did not increase significantly. Again, it is 
possible that the finding of a significant effect on these 
process variables, but not on the outcome of stillbirth, is 
a power issue given the greater frequency of these 
process variables compared with the outcome of stillbirth. 
At present, because timely delivery is the only strategy 
to prevent stillbirth in response to concerns about fetal 
wellbeing, any package of care that relies on a test of fetal 
wellbeing to reduce stillbirth could increase the frequency 
of elective delivery, unless the false positive rate of the test 
is negligible. In other words, for most tests of fetal 
wellbeing, there might be a trade-off between stillbirths 
prevented and the increased number of elective deliveries 
initiated, although this was not the case in the Frøen 
study.13 The magnitude of this trade-off for using RFM as 
an alert (the effect on incidence of stillbirth and process 
variables in a population of 10 000 women) is shown in 
tables 2 and table 3.
The AFFIRM study is one of the few randomised trials 
with stillbirth as the primary outcome. Our findings 
show that a cluster design with routinely collected data is 
feasible. Our highly novel design used anonymised data 
at scale (resulting in a very efficient trial), which we 
believe provides a template for further trials. The cluster 
methodology allows interventions to be implemented at a 
hospital or regional level and minimises contamination 
between groups, which might occur if clinicians have to 
provide different standards of care to different women on 
the same day. The stepped wedge design had the benefit 
of allowing all maternity units to adopt (and persist with) 
the intervention and is ideal for interventions that are 
difficult to unlearn or to abandon. Randomising maternity 
units to the timing of uptake of intervention minimised 
bias but might have created additional opportunities for 
poor adherence, since compliance with the timing of 
adoption of the intervention as well as compliance with 
the intervention can both be suboptimal. Correct timing 
was difficult to achieve in AFFIRM; although sites were 
enthusiastic about participating at the beginning of the 
study, the practicalities (and costs) of implementing the 
intervention sometimes delayed the onset. Adherence to 
the ultrasound components was the most difficult aspect 
of compliance with the intervention, largely because of 
shortage of ultrasonography staff. We do not believe this 
had a major effect on the results, given the similarities in 
results between the intention-to-treat and on-treatment 
analyses.
A further potential limitation is uncertainty about 
whether the washout period was long enough to facilitate 
implementation. The AFFIRM findings also show the 
challenges of any study to address stillbirth. The relatively 
low risk of stillbirth but high incidence of other outcomes, 
such as prolonged neonatal unit admission and caesarean 
section, can result in higher power to show harms (such 
as increased intervention) rather than benefit.
The data on the effect of our RFM package on risk of 
stillbirth, caesarean section, induction of labour, and 
neonatal unit admission in a notional population of 
10 000 women will be of interest to pregnant women, 
clinicians, policy makers, and commissioning groups. 
Further research to identify better predictive tests for 
stillbirth (to enable targeting of the only current treat-
ment of earlier delivery) is urgently needed.
The intervention package, in its present form, was not 
effective; it led to a significant increase in interventions 
and cannot be recommended. Other studies on the 
efficacy of RFM strategies are ongoing and, together 
with the AFFIRM findings, will provide the best evidence 
on the likely effectiveness of RFM awareness as a 
stillbirth reduction strategy and can help clinicians and 
policy makers make informed decisions as to how RFM 
awareness might fit into a stillbirth reduction strategy.
