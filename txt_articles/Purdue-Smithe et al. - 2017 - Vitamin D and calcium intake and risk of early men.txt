ABSTRACT
Background: Early menopause, defined as the cessation of ovarian
function before the age of 45 y, affects w10% of women and is
associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis,
and other conditions. Few modifiable risk factors for early meno-
pause have been identified, but emerging data suggest that high
vitamin D intake may reduce risk.
Objective: We evaluated how intakes of vitamin D and calcium are
associated with the incidence of early menopause in the prospective
Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS2).
Design: Intakes of vitamin D and calcium from foods and supple-
ments were measured every 4 y with the use of a food-frequency
questionnaire. Cases of incident early menopause were identified
from all participants who were premenopausal at baseline in 1991;
over 1.13 million person-years, 2041 women reported having natural
menopause before the age of 45 y. We used Cox proportional hazards
regression to evaluate relations between intakes of vitamin D and
calcium and incident early menopause while accounting for potential
confounding factors.
Results: After adjustment for age, smoking, and other factors,
women with the highest intake of dietary vitamin D (quintile median:
528 IU/d) had a significant 17% lower risk of early menopause than
women with the lowest intake [quintile median: 148 IU/d; HR: 0.83
(95% CI: 0.72, 0.95); P-trend = 0.03]. Dietary calcium intake in the
highest quintile (median: 1246 mg/d) compared with the lowest (me-
dian: 556 mg/d) was associated with a borderline significantly lower
risk of early menopause (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.00; P-trend = 0.03).
Associations were stronger for vitamin D and calcium from dairy sour-
ces than from nondairy dietary sources, whereas high supplement use
was not associated with lower risk.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that high intakes of dietary vitamin D
and calcium may be modestly associated with a lower risk of early
menopause. Further studies evaluating 25-hydroxyvitamin D con-
centrations, other dairy constituents, and early menopause are
warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Early menopause, defined as the cessation of ovarian function
before the age of 45 y, affects w10% of women in Western
populations (1). Current research suggests that women who ex-
perience early menopause are at increased risk of premature
mortality and cognitive decline, osteoporosis, and cardiovascu-
lar disease, among other adverse health outcomes (2–5). Women
commonly experience an ebb in fertility during the 10 y leading
up to natural menopause; for women who have early menopause,
this may have substantial financial and psychological conse-
quences for family planning, particularly as women increasingly
delay childbearing into the later reproductive years (1, 6). Genetic
factors do not fully account for the age at which menopause
occurs, and emerging research suggests that modifiable lifestyle
factors such as diet may play an important role in ovarian aging
(7–14).
Calcium and vitamin D have been implicated in several gy-
necologic and reproductive conditions including polycystic ovary
syndrome, endometriosis, and premenstrual syndrome and appear
to play a role in fertility (15–20). Laboratory evidence suggests
that the ovary is a target organ for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the
active metabolite of vitamin D3, and that vitamin D receptors are
expressed in reproductive tissues including the ovary (21, 22).
Recently, one group observed that plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D
[25(OH)D]9 concentrations were positively associated with ovarian
reserve, providing further evidence of a protective role of vita-
min D on ovarian aging (23).
Despite biological plausibility, to our knowledge, no epidemi-
ologic studies have specifically investigated the relation of vitamin
D and calcium with incident early menopause. One prospective
study of total vitamin D and calcium intake and overall age at
natural menopause among premenopausal women enrolled in the
Nurses’ Health Study found that high intake of low-fat dairy

 foods, but not total calcium or total vitamin D intake, were as-
sociated with later menopause (8). Importantly, because the
mean age at the beginning of follow-up for these women was
51.5 y, the relation of vitamin D and calcium intakes and risk of
early menopause (,45 y old) remains unclear. In addition, this
study did not distinguish calcium and vitamin D from dietary
compared with supplemental sources, which has proven to be an
important distinction in previous studies of reproductive-related
conditions and other outcomes (18, 24, 25).
The aim of the present study was to examine the relation of
intakes of vitamin D and calcium from supplemental, dietary,
dairy, and nondairy dietary sources and subsequent risk of early
menopause in the prospective Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS2).
We hypothesized that among participants of the NHS2, total
intakes of vitamin D and calcium would be inversely associated
with early menopause. We similarly hypothesized that vitamin
D and calcium intakes from supplements, foods, and dairy would
each be inversely associated with early menopause.
METHODS
The NHS2 is a prospective study of 116,430 female US
registered nurses who were 25–42 y old in 1989 when they re-
sponded to a mailed baseline questionnaire. Information regarding
lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions are collected through
biennial questionnaires for which the follow-up rate for each cycle
has been $89%. The study protocol was approved by the Insti-
tutional Review Board at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in
Boston, Massachusetts.
Assessment of early menopause
On the 1989 baseline questionnaire, nurses were asked if their
periods had ceased permanently with the following response
options: 1) no: premenopausal; 2) yes: no menstrual periods; 3)
yes: had menopause but now have periods induced by hormones;
and 4) not sure (e.g., started hormones before the cessation of
periods). Nurses who indicated that their periods had ceased
were asked the following questions: 1) At what age did your
periods cease? (open response); and 2) For what reason did your
periods cease? (response options were surgery; radiation or
chemotherapy; and natural). In addition, women were asked
about their current and past use of replacement sex hormones.
These questions were repeated on all subsequent questionnaires.
Age at natural menopause was defined as age after 12 consecutive
months of amenorrhea that was not due to radiation, chemother-
apy, or surgery. A small number of women reported being post-
menopausal on one questionnaire and subsequently reported being
premenopausal. For these women, we defined the age at men-
opause as the age after which periods were absent $12 mo
and confirmed that this status persisted for $3 consecutive
questionnaires.
Because we were interested in prospectively evaluating the
relation of intakes of vitamin D and calcium with incident early
menopause, participants were eligible for inclusion in our study if
they indicated that they were premenopausal and reported no age
at menopause on the baseline 1989 questionnaire (n = 108,812).
We further excluded women who did not respond to or who
reported implausible caloric intake (,500 or $3500 kcal/d) on
the 1991 food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (n = 21,904), were
diagnosed with cancer before 1991 (n = 391), or whose date of
menopause was before their return date of the 1991 FFQ (n = 283).
After baseline exclusions, 86,234 women remained in the study
sample (Figure 1).
Women were followed prospectively until 2011 for self-report
of the cessation of menses, as previously defined, or first report
of a hysterectomy, bilateral or unilateral oophorectomy, cancer
(not including nonmelanoma skin cancer), loss to follow-up, or
death. We identified cases of early menopause as women who
reported having natural menopause before the age of 45 y.
Dietary assessment
Nurses completed validated semi-quantitative FFQs in 1991,
1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2011, which assessed their average
intakes of 131 foods, beverages, and supplements over the pre-
ceding year (26–28). Each questionnaire asked participants to
estimate, on average, how often they consumed specific foods
and beverages. Participants reported their consumption by indi-
cating one of 9 frequency categories for each food and beverage
(i.e., ,1 serving/mo; 1–3 servings/mo; 1, 2–4, and 5–6 servings/wk;
and 1, 2–3, 4–5, and $6 servings/d). Calcium intake from food
sources was estimated by summing the calcium content per 1
serving of each food and beverage (e.g., skim, low-fat, and whole
milk; yogurt; hard cheese; cottage cheese; and spinach) and mul-
tiplying it by the frequency of consumption. Intakes of vitamin D,
vegetable protein, and alcohol were derived similarly. We calculated

 the percentage of total calories from vegetable protein by multi-
plying grams of vegetable protein by 4 kcal/g and dividing by total
kilocalories.
Nurses were queried about the average use and dosages of
multivitamins, calcium, and vitamin D supplements every 2 y on
FFQs or biennial questionnaires, from which we estimated in-
takes of each nutrient from supplement sources. Total vitamin D
and calcium intakes were estimated by summing dietary intakes
and supplemental intakes of each nutrient. Intakes of all nutrients
were adjusted for total energy by using the residual method (29).
The validity of the FFQ was assessed via comparison with
1-wk diet records in a random subset (n = 100) of women in the
Nurses’ Health Study, a comparable population of female health
professionals. The deattenuated Pearson correlation coefficient
comparing the 2 methods for calcium intake was 0.75 (26).
Assessment of covariates
Information regarding age, height, ethnicity, maternal and
paternal education level, and age at menarche was collected at
baseline in 1989. Updated information on weight, parity, oral con-
traceptive use, breastfeeding, hormone therapy use, and smoking
was collected biennially throughout follow-up. Baseline height
and updated weight were used to calculate updated BMI (in kg/m2)
as weight divided by the square of height for each questionnaire
cycle. Physical activity was assessed in 1991, 1997, 2001, 2005,
and 2009 with the use of the nurses’ responses to questions re-
garding the average time spent per week participating in specific
activities (e.g., walking, running, and biking) from which we calcu-
lated metabolic equivalent task hours per week (30). For covariates
with missing data, we assigned missing values to a missing indi-
cator category. Results from analyses that were restricted to women
with complete covariate data (n = 1956) were identical; thus, we
present results from analyses using missing indicator categories to
maximize statistical power.
Statistical analysis
We divided participants into quintiles of intakes of total (foods
plus supplements), dietary (foods only), and dairy (dairy foods
only) vitamin D and calcium according to the distribution of the
NHS2 population. For supplemental vitamin D and calcium, we
categorized participants according to their specified dosage (0, 1–
599, and $600 IU vitamin D/d; 0, 1–399, 400–899, and $900 mg
Ca/d) with nonusers serving as the referent group. We further
dichotomized participants according to the adequacy of their
total vitamin D and calcium intakes based on current Recom-
mended Daily Allowances (i.e., 600 IU vitamin D/d; 1000 mg Ca/d)
to aid in the interpretability of analyses. We assessed baseline
characteristics of our study sample according to total calcium
and vitamin D intakes using age-adjusted generalized linear
models.
For our primary analyses, we used Cox proportional hazards
regression to estimate age-adjusted and multivariable HRs for
early menopause by vitamin D and calcium intakes. Tests for
linear trend were conducted by modeling the median of each
category as a continuous variable. For each participant, the ac-
crual of follow-up (in months) began on the date of return of the
1991 questionnaire and continued until menopause, first report
of hysterectomy, bilateral or unilateral oophorectomy, cancer (not
including nonmelanoma skin cancer), loss to follow-up, or death,
whichever occurred first. Analyses were stratified on age (in
months) and questionnaire cycle.
For each nutrient, we modeled the timing of intake in 3 ways as
follows: 1) baseline (1991) intake only; 2) simple updating of
intake every 2–4 y; and 3) cumulative average intake. Cumu-
lative average values for each exposure were calculated as mean
intakes estimated from all FFQs up to and including the cycle
before menopause. Results from these 3 methods were similar,
and because the cumulative average method has been suggested
to best represent long-term dietary intake by reducing misclassi-
fication due to within-person variation, we have presented only
the results from cumulative average models (31).
In addition to analyses adjusted only for age, we fit a full
multivariable model adjusting for variables including age, pack-
years of smoking, BMI, parity, lifetime duration of breastfeeding,
age at menarche, physical activity, percentage of total calories
from vegetable protein, and alcohol intake [multivariable model
1 (MV1)]. Because none of the covariates we tested were asso-
ciated with a .10% change in exposure HRs, covariate selection
was based on factors identified a priori (i.e., age, smoking, BMI,
parity, age at menarche, and physical activity) and factors asso-
ciated with early menopause in our population (i.e., the duration
of breastfeeding and intakes of alcohol and vegetable protein). To
account for the high correlation of vitamin D and calcium intakes,
we mutually adjusted vitamin D for calcium, and vice versa, and
supplemental intake for dietary intake, and vice versa, in a second
multivariable model.
To investigate the potential variation in associations by timing
of exposure, we evaluated whether vitamin D and calcium intakes
at age 35 compared with age 40 y were differently associated with
early menopause by using logistic regression. Because not all
participants completed questionnaires at exactly age 35 or 40 y,
dietary exposures and covariates on the questionnaire completed
closest in time before ages 35 and 40 y were used. These analyses
were restricted to women for whom diet data were available at
both ages 35 and 40 y and evaluated risk of early menopause from
age 40 to ,45 y (n = 534).
Because vitamin D is sequestered in adipose tissue (32), and
BMI might plausibly behave as an effect modifier, we further
tested the multiplicative interaction of BMI (3 categories) and
dietary vitamin D (continuous quintile medians) on risk of early
menopause by using cross-product terms. We also conducted a
number of sensitivity analyses to evaluate the stability of the
estimates. First, to ensure the adequacy of our control for con-
founding by smoking, we restricted our sample to never smokers
(n for analysis = 1533 cases). Second, to evaluate the degree to
which misclassification of early menopause may have occurred
in our study, we conducted further analyses excluding noncases
who experienced menopause before the age of 48 y. We were
also concerned that conditions indicated for hysterectomy that
are also related to vitamin D and calcium intakes may have se-
lectively excluded noncases with low intakes of these nutrients. To
evaluate this potential selection bias, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis censoring at date of laparoscopy-confirmed endome-
triosis and ultrasound-confirmed uterine fibroid diagnosis (n for
analysis = 1996 cases).
All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS v9.4 software
(SAS Institute Inc.). We used 2-sided statistical tests performed
at the 0.05 significance level for all analyses.

 RESULTS
During 1.13 million person-years of follow-up, 2041 women
experienced incident early menopause. Baseline age-adjusted
descriptive statistics according to quintile of total vitamin D
and calcium are presented in Table 1. On average, women who
had the highest intakes of calcium and vitamin D were younger,
were more physically active, had lower BMI, drank less alcohol,
and were less likely to be current smokers than women who had
the lowest intakes.
Results from analyses of vitamin D intake are presented in
Table 2. In age-adjusted analyses, total vitamin D intake was
not associated with early menopause (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.83,
1.09; P-trend = 0.80). Supplemental vitamin D intake $600 IU/d
was also not associated with risk (HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.78;
P-trend = 0.23), whereas intakes of vitamin D from dietary and
dairy sources were associated with lower risk of early meno-
pause [HR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.91; P-trend ,0.01) and 0.82
(95% CI: 0.71, 0.94; P-trend = 0.02), respectively]. For refer-
ence, this level of vitamin D intake from dairy sources corre-
sponds to w2.5 servings (8 oz/serving) of vitamin D–fortified
milk/d. Intake of nondairy dietary vitamin D was not associated
with risk of early menopause (quintile 5 compared with quintile
1: HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.07; P-trend = 0.32).
After further adjustment for risk factors for early menopause,
estimates were similar to those from age-adjusted models. For
example, in MV1, in which we controlled for age, BMI,
smoking, and other risk factors, total vitamin D intake in the
highest compared with the lowest quintile was not associated
with risk of early menopause (quintile 5 compared with quintile
1: HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.13; P-trend = 0.76). Women with
dietary vitamin D intake in the highest compared with the
lowest quintile were 17% (95% CI: 0.72, 0.95; P-trend = 0.03)
less likely to experience early menopause. To evaluate whether
this association may have been driven by intakes of these
nutrients from dairy foods, we ran MV1 separately, evaluating
dairy compared with nondairy dietary vitamin D. The HR com-
paring the highest and the lowest quintiles of dairy vitamin D
intake was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.98; P-trend = 0.06), whereas
nondairy dietary vitamin D was not associated with risk (quintile
5 compared with quintile 1: HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.12;
P-trend = 0.55). Vitamin D supplement use was also not asso-
ciated with increased risk of early menopause (P-trend = 0.10).
Results from analyses of calcium intake and early menopause
are presented in Table 3. Age-adjusted and MV1 estimates for
total, dietary, and dairy calcium intakes were similar to those
for vitamin D. For example, in MV1, dietary calcium intake in
the highest quintile was associated with a borderline significant
13% lower risk of early menopause (95% CI: 0.76, 1.00;
P-trend = 0.03) than in the lowest quintile. High calcium intake
from dairy sources was also associated with a borderline sig-
nificantly lower risk (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1: HR:
0.87, 95% CI: 0.75, 1.00; P-trend = 0.03), whereas nondairy
dietary calcium intake was not associated with risk of early
menopause (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1: HR: 1.01, 95% CI:
0.85, 1.20; P-trend = 0.99). Calcium supplement intake was posi-
tively associated with risk of early menopause (P-trend , 0.01).
In an attempt to disentangle the individual associations of
vitamin D and calcium with risk of early menopause, we
mutually adjusted for corresponding sources of vitamin D and

 calcium in a second multivariable model. After adjustment, es-
timates were similar, while 95% CIs were wider and no longer
significant (complete results not shown). For example, in this
model, calcium intake from dairy foods in quintile 5 compared
with quintile 1 was associated with a nonsignificant 12% de-
creased risk of early menopause (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.14;
P-trend = 0.29). The association for vitamin D intake from dairy
foods was also attenuated (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1:
HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.25; P-trend = 0.94).
Results from MV1 logistic regression models assessing intakes
of vitamin D and calcium from dietary and supplemental sources
at ages 35 and 40 y are presented in Table 4. At age 35 y, intake
of $600 IU supplemental vitamin D/d compared with no sup-
plement use was associated with higher risk (OR: 1.93; 95% CI:
1.15, 3.22), whereas calcium supplement use was not associated
with risk of early menopause. Intakes of dietary vitamin D and
calcium were both inversely associated with risk of early men-
opause. Similarly, at age 40 y, intakes of both dietary vitamin D
and calcium were inversely associated with early menopause.
Supplemental vitamin D intake was not associated with risk,
whereas high intake of supplemental calcium was associated
with increased risk ($900 mg/d compared with nonusers: OR:
1.60; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.17; P-trend = 0.02).
Results from analyses among never smokers were similar but
slightly stronger in magnitude than in the main analyses (Sup-

 the main analyses (data not shown). Tests of proportional hazards
were not statistically significant, indicating that the proportional
hazards assumption was met.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective study, we found high intakes of vitamin D
and calcium from food sources to be modestly associated with
lower risk of early menopause. Contrarily, supplemental vitamin
D intake was not associated with risk of early menopause, and
supplemental calcium intake was positively associated with
early menopause.
The inverse associations for vitamin D and calcium from food
sources appear to be driven largely by dairy sources of these
nutrients, and mutual adjustment of vitamin D for calcium, and
vice versa, attenuated the findings for each. Although we are
aware of no previous studies that have assessed dairy vitamin D
and calcium specifically, Carwile et al. (8) observed that intake of
low-fat dairy but not high-fat dairy was associated with later age
of menopause among women ,51 y of age. A similar association

 was reported in an abstract from the Japan Nurses’ Health Study,
which observed an inverse association of milk and dairy con-
sumption on risk of early menopause; however, specific details
about exposure and covariate measurements in this unpublished
study are unavailable (14). In contrast, dairy consumption was not
associated with menopausal timing in a study within the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.
It is notable that Carwile et al. (8) similarly did not find total
vitamin D or calcium intake to be related to age at menopause.
However, their study did not separately evaluate dietary com-
pared with supplemental sources of these nutrients, which may
have attenuated associations for vitamin D from foods. In our
study, high doses of supplemental calcium were associated with
higher risk of early menopause. The observed higher risk among
supplement users was unexpected, and we postulate that these
women may have experienced conditions related to sex-steroid
hormone concentrations before early menopause for which their
doctors indicated a calcium supplement, such as autoimmune dis-
eases or a family history of osteoporosis.
To further address this potential bias, we also conducted a post
hoc analysis (n for analysis = 1757 cases) excluding women with
conditions potentially related to both vitamin D and supplement
use (e.g., lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, low
bone density, hip fracture, and osteoporosis). Estimates from
these analyses were essentially identical to those from the main
analyses. We also considered the possibility that women were
taking multivitamins that contained supplemental vitamin D and
calcium to treat perimenopause symptoms before early meno-
pause. Nevertheless, after further controlling for multivitamin use,
the positive association for supplemental calcium intake persisted.
The observed inverse association of dairy calcium and the
borderline significant inverse association of dairy vitamin D
specifically suggest that other constituents of dairy products may
also influence menopause timing. Bovine milk is a rich source
of steroid hormones, particularly of progesterone; for example,
whole milk contains 10 mg progesterone/L (33). Milk consumption
has also been shown to increase concentrations of plasma estradiol
(34) and insulin-like growth factor I (35–37) in previous epidemiologic

VITAMIN D AND CALCIUM INTAKE AND EARLY MENOPAUSE

 studies. Therefore, it is biologically plausible that these components,
which are highly correlated with intakes of vitamin D and calcium
in dairy, also contributed to the inverse associations observed. Thus,
studies of dairy foods and dairy constituents, such as phosphorus,
potassium, and vitamin B-12, and early menopause are warranted.
Because vitamin D and calcium are typically present together
in specific foods, the attenuation of the estimates for each nutrient
after mutual adjustment is likely due to the collinearity of vitamin
D and calcium. In this population, the Pearson correlation co-
efficient for dairy vitamin D and calcium was 0.86 (P , 0.001).
It is likely that vitamin D and calcium each had an individual
contribution to the observed estimates, but separating out asso-
ciations for each nutrient is statistically impossible because of
near-perfect collinearity.
The observed inverse association for dietary vitamin D also
may be due to a modest protective effect of vitamin D and
calcium on ovarian aging. Several potential mechanisms sup-
porting this hypothesis have been proposed, namely the ability
of vitamin D to modify messenger-RNA expression of anti-
Mu
¨llerian hormone, a glycoprotein secreted by granulosa cells
during early follicle development that correlates with overall age
at menopause and may play a role in regulating ovarian aging
(38–42). Because the majority of vitamin D is obtained via
cutaneous synthesis during solar UV-ray exposure, dietary and
supplemental intakes of vitamin D represent a small overall
contribution to circulating plasma 25(OH)D (43). To better un-
derstand how vitamin D status is related to early menopause, future
biomarker studies of anti-Mu
¨llerian hormone, plasma 25(OH)D
concentrations, and menopause timing are warranted.
Strengths of our study include a prospective design with 20 y
of follow-up and a large sample size that allowed us to consider a
variety of potential confounding variables. During this follow-up
period, we were able to assess intakes of vitamin D and calcium
5 times and to use cumulative averages of exposures, which
allowed us to capture within-person variation in diet and to reduce
misclassification (31). Our study expanded on previous studies by
assessing early menopause specifically rather than overall age at
menopause as an outcome. Menopausal timing follows a normal
distribution with a mean of 51 y of age (6). In a previous study of
other factors and menopausal timing, associations of nutrients
varied across age strata (8), supporting the use of the binary early
menopause outcome rather than a continuous distribution of age
at menopause with respect to evaluating risk factors.
Our study also has several limitations. First, because a bio-
chemical confirmation of age at menopause was not feasible in a
study of this size, we relied on self-reported menopausal status to
determine timing of menopause. However, in a study of 6591
women in the comparable Nurses’ Health Study population,
among women who were premenopausal in 1976 and reported
having natural menopause on the 1978 questionnaire, 82% of
women reported their age at menopause #1 y on the following 2
questionnaires (44). Any misclassification of early menopause
would most likely have been biased toward null. Moreover,
in a sensitivity analysis that restricted noncases to women with
menopause after age 48 y, we found estimates to be identical,
suggesting that our results are robust to misclassification of the
outcome. Furthermore, although we cannot rule out the possi-
bility of systematic overreporting or underreporting of total
energy, alcohol, and nutrients including vitamin D, calcium, and
vegetable protein, it is unlikely that reporting patterns for dietary
variables would be related to case status. Misclassification across
extreme categories is improbable and would not explain the ob-
served inverse associations for intakes of dietary and dairy vitamin
D and calcium.
Because the NHS2 is a fairly heterogeneous population with
regard to dietary variables and other lifestyle factors related to
early menopause, we anticipate that our results are generaliz-
able to other populations of premenopausal women. However,
because the NHS2 is racially homogenous, our ability to assess
differences in the relation between vitamin D and calcium and
early menopause across racial and ethnic groups is limited, and
our findings should be replicated in more racially diverse
populations. It is also important to note that in the NHS2, dietary
vitamin D intake in the highest category is higher than what has
been reported in other population-based studies (45) and, thus,
may not reflect typical intake in the United States. Findings from
our study suggest that vitamin D and calcium from food sources,
particularly from dairy, are modestly associated with lower risk of
early menopause. Further studies examining risk of early men-
opause with regard to dairy constituents and plasma vitamin D
concentrations are warranted.
