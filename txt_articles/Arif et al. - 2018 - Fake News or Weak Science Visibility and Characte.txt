The 1998 Lancet paper by Wakefield et al., despite subsequent retraction and evidence 
indicating no causal link between vaccinations and autism, triggered significant parental 
concern. The aim of this study was to analyze the online information available on this 
topic. Using localized versions of Google, we searched “autism vaccine” in English, 
French, Italian, Portuguese, Mandarin, and Arabic and analyzed 200 websites for each 
search engine result page (SERP). A common feature was the newsworthiness of the 
topic, with news outlets representing 25–50% of the SERP
, followed by unaffiliated 
websites (blogs, social media) that represented 27–41% and included most of the 
vaccine-negative websites. Between 12 and 24% of websites had a negative stance on 
vaccines, while most websites were pro-vaccine (43–70%). However, their ranking by 
Google varied. While in Google.com, the first vaccine-negative website was the 43rd in 
the SERP
, there was one vaccine-negative webpage in the top 10 websites in both the 
British and Australian localized versions and in French and two in Italian, Portuguese, 
and Mandarin, suggesting that the information quality algorithm used by Google may 
work better in English. Many webpages mentioned celebrities in the context of the link 
between vaccines and autism, with Donald Trump most frequently. Few websites (1–5%) 
promoted complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) but 50–100% of these were 
also vaccine-negative suggesting that CAM users are more exposed to vaccine-negative 
information. This analysis highlights the need for monitoring the web for information 
impacting on vaccine uptake.

Acceptance and uptake of vaccination is important for reaching public health targets. The informa-
tion available, either from books, television news, newspaper articles, or online sources, has a major 
impact on how the public perceives vaccines. In this respect, the most impactful information was 
the publication by Andrew Wakefield in the medical journal The Lancet in 1998, supporting a link

Vaccines and Autism on Google

between the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and 
autism (1). The journal eventually retracted the paper in 2010 
(2), because its findings were discredited (3), but its message has 
become commonplace and remains a significant concern among 
parents (4).
It has often been pointed out that antivaccine information 
available on the Internet has a high prevalence and could impact 
negatively vaccination decisions (5–8). Observational studies have 
shown an association between exposure to antivaccine information 
on Twitter (9), and on the Internet in general (10), and a negative 
perception of vaccine risks. A Canadian study on 250 mothers also 
reported that reliance on governmental websites, which promote 
vaccination, is associated with higher vaccination rates (11). It is 
difficult, however, to draw a causal link from these associations 
and quantify the impact of online information on vaccine uptake.
Furthermore, the information on the prevalence of antivac-
cine websites is not consistent. A study in the USA analyzing 89 
websites on human papilloma virus (HPV) returned by Google, 
Yahoo, and Bing reported less than 10% of websites with negative 
tone about vaccines (12) while one on MMR, also in the USA, 
reported that searching Google in 2014 returned a proportion of 
41% of antivaccine websites (13).
The purpose of this study is to analyze the information 
available to the public, 20 years on from the publication of the 
above mentioned Lancet paper, on the link between vaccines and 
autism. The study does not analyze the impact of online informa-
tion of vaccination rates or on public health views on vaccines but 
provides an approach to monitor vaccine-related information on 
the web. Using a methodology used previously for similar studies, 
we obtained a sample of the existing information using Google 
as the search engine (14–17). This captures most information 
as news outlets, television, books, professional or government 
organizations, scientific journals, and personal websites or 
blogs are all online. We sampled the first 200 results returned 
by Google searching for “autism vaccines,” and analyzed them 
for the vaccines mentioned, their stance on vaccination, and the 
source of the website. We also used a standard indicator of health 
information quality, the JAMA score, to assess their basic trust-
worthiness index. The JAMA score considers whether a website 
declares author, date of writing, financial ownership, and whether 
its information is backed up by references (18).
The analysis was performed in different countries on localized 
versions of the search engine in different languages (google.com, 
google.co.uk, and google.com.au in English; google.be in French; 
google.it in Italian; google.com.br in Portuguese; google.com.sg 
in Mandarin; google.com.sa in Arabic). This research was done by 
a pre-existing international research collaboration, and that dic-
tated the choice of the languages or localized versions of Google.
We also investigated the visibility, in terms of ranking, given by 
the search engine to webpages with a negative tone on vaccines. 
This has been overlooked by most studies, and it is known that users 
typically spend a short time on each website (19) and seldom go 
beyond the first ones in the search engine result page (SERP) (20).
The results indicate differences in the composition of the 
antivaccine websites across the world and the footprint left by 
Wakefield’s Lancet paper. They also show differences in the ranking 
of antivaccine websites in the different localized versions of Google.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
We searched the two keywords “vaccines” and “autism” in Google 
between June and September 2017. It was decided to use only 
those keywords because we wanted to obtain a sample of the 
websites returned independently of the expression used. For this 
reason, we decided not to use questions such as “do vaccines 
cause autism?” because the results would be different depending 
on how the question was formulated and we needed to be con-
sistent across the different languages. Although “vaccines” could 
be synonymous to “immunization,” particularly in the scientific 
literature, we decided to use the search term “vaccines” as this 
best represents what the lay public would search on the Internet.
Before performing the search, the investigators deleted cook-
ies and browsing history from their browsers to avoid the results 
of the search being influenced by previous searches done on the 
same computer (21–23), although it must be noted that the search 
engine will still identify the locations where the searches was made 
from the IP address, and this may customize results. Locations 
where the searches were performed were as follows: google.com 
(English), google.co.uk (English), google.it (Italian), and google.
com.sa (Arabic), Brighton, UK; google.com.au (English), Sydney, 
NSW, Australia; google.be (French), Brussels, Belgium; google.
com.sg (Mandarin), Singapore; google.com.br (Portuguese), 
Porto Alegre, Brazil.
The first 200 websites returned in each SERP were transferred 
to a spreadsheet and then the websites visited individually. When 
searching google.be, the French terms (vaccins, autisme) were 
used and any webpage in Flemish would be excluded from the 
analysis. Webpages that were deemed not relevant, for instance, 
not mentioning vaccines or aggregators, like those no longer 
accessible, behind a paywall or requiring registration were 
excluded from the analysis.
The total number of webpages considered for the analysis 
were as follows: English (Google.com), 175; English, UK, 188; 
English, Australia,194; French, 154; Portuguese, 132; Italian, 191; 
Mandarin, 179; Arabic, 146.
For each website, we recorded the typology of the website 
using the classification previously described (16, 17). The typolo-
gies considered were: Commercial (C), Government (G), Health 
portal (HP), News (N), No-profit (NP), Professional (P), scientific 
journals (SJ), as shown in Table 1. Those not fitting any of these 
categories or difficult to classify are listed as “others” (O). These 
included blogs, personal websites, or websites not affiliated with 
any of the other typologies.
To assess the JAMA score, we searched the webpage for the 
presence of the following information: author, date, references, 
owner of website (18).
We also annotated webpages according to the following 
features:
(1) The name of the vaccine mentioned; (2) the overall stance 
on vaccines (positive, negative, or neutral); (3) the chemicals or 
adjuvants mentioned; (4) whether the page mentioned comple-
mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) and its stance toward it 
(positive, neutral, or negative); (5) whether religion was mentioned; 
 
(6) whether the page contained a testimonial (e.g., a personal story); 
(7) whether a celebrity was mentioned. For websites associated

statistical analysis
When indicated, statistical analysis was performed using 
GraphPad Prism version 7 for Windows (GraphPad Software 
Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
A two-tailed Fishers Exact test was used when comparing 
frequencies; when comparing multiple groups, the Bonferroni 
correction for multiplicity was applied.
When comparing JAMA scores across more than two groups, 
ANOVA was performed followed by Kruskal–Wallis test cor-
rected for multiplicity by controlling the false discovery rate using 
the method of Benjamini and Hochberg.
A Pearson correlation coefficient test was used to assess the 
correlation between two variables, following D’Agostino and 
Pearson normality test (when the number of samples was too 
small, a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to determine nor-
mality, a pre-requisite for the Pearson’s test). For non-normally 
distributed samples, correlation was assessed using a Spearman 
Rank test. An alpha value of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests 
unless otherwise specified.
The statistical test used is described in the text or in the legends 
to figures and tables.
Word count to detect the number of occurrences of the names 
of celebrities was performed using natural language processing. 
Briefly, text corpora were extracted using WebBootCaT, an online 
tool for bootstrapping text corpora from Internet. Then word 
counts were obtained using the corpus analysis software Sketch 
Engine by Lexical Computing, Brno-Královo Pole, Czechia (24).
The raw data containing the list of websites analyzed and 
how they were annotated in provided in Data Sheet S1 in 
Supplementary Material.
resUlTs
Focus on MMr
Because we only used the word “vaccine” without specifying 
further, we first analyzed the vaccines mentioned in the webpages 
returned. As shown in Table 2, MMR was the most discussed vac-
cine, as expected, followed by influenza, viral hepatitis, diphtheria– 
tetanus–pertussis (DTP), poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenza 
b and meningococci, HPV. However, there were differences 
between the various languages. The largest spread of vaccines 
mentioned was observed in Mandarin, while webpages in Arabic 
only mentioned MMR and influenza. Mandarin webpages also 
mentioned BCG while those in Portuguese mentioned Yellow 
fever and measles.
Typologies of Websites
Table 3 shows the composition of the SERP in terms of website 
typologies. In all SERPs, most websites (60–80%) were “news” 
or “other” (including non-affiliated websites, blogs etc.). Websites 
from governmental (e.g., national and international public health 
services, health ministries, CDC, FDA, etc.) or inter-governmental 
organizations (e.g., WHO) were not highly represented, their fre-
quency ranging from 1.3% (French) to 6.7% (English/Australia).
Non-profit organizations, health portals and professional web-
sites followed in various proportion. Commercial websites had 
a presence (except in Italian) between 2 and 6%. SJs online were 
present in a significant percentage (3–7%) only in the three SERPs 
in English, which is not surprising if we consider that scientific 
literature is mostly in English.

Vaccines and Autism on Google
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org
June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1215
stance on Vaccines
The most important aspect of the content analysis was to assess 
the stance of websites toward vaccines, whether pro-vaccine, 
vaccine-negative, or neutral. A pro-vaccine stance would be that 
of websites promoting vaccination or denying the causal link with 
autism. A vaccine-negative stance would be that of supporting 
a link with autism or discouraging vaccinations, like the so-called 
“anti-vaxxers.” An example of neutral stance would be that of 
a news website reporting the existence of this controversy or a 
scientific paper reporting findings from an epidemiological study.
Figure 2 reports the presence of total websites that are pro-
vaccine, neutral, or vaccine-negative in the whole SERP (panel A) 
 
and in the top 10 websites returned by Google (panel B). The fre-
quency of vaccine-negative webpages in the top 10 results was lower 
than that observed in the rest of the SERP in most languages except 
for Italian (11% in the whole SERP
, 20% in the top 10) and Arabic 
(7.5% in the whole SERP
, 30% in the top 10, P = 0.0485 by Fisher’s 
test). The frequency of pro-vaccine websites in the top 10 was 
significantly higher than in the rest of the SERP in google.com but 
lower in google.be; Fisher’s test, P = 0.0472 and 0.0220, respectively.
Figure 3 provides a visual representation of the ranking of 
the vaccine-negative websites (in yellow) in the first 100 websites 
across the different SERPs. There is a clear trend for searches in 
English websites which give a lower visibility to vaccine-negative 
webpages.
The observed frequency of vaccine-negative webpages across 
the different typologies of websites is reported in Table 6. For 
each language SERP, we color-coded values based on how the 
observed frequency of vaccine-negative URLs in that typology 
compared with the expected frequency (the overall percentage 
of vaccine-negative websites in the whole SERP). In almost all 
SERPs, a higher proportion than expected of commercial websites 
were vaccine-negative in stance (up to 71.4% were observed in 
google.com compared with 16.6% expected). It should be noted, 
however, that commercial websites account for only 2–6% of the 
total websites returned, and they never appear in the top 10, as 
shown in Tables 3 and 4. A higher frequency of websites classified 
as “other” were observed to be vaccine-negative in their stance (up 
to 40% of websites in the UK). This is particularly relevant as this 
website typology accounts for about one-third of the total SERPs. 
As expected, there were no vaccine-negative websites among the 
government typology, and very few in the professional typology 
On the other hand, the pattern in the top 10 websites is com-
pletely different (Table 4). Commercial websites are not present 
in the top 10 websites returned by Google. In many SERPs the 
frequency of government websites was 10–30%, higher than that 
in the whole search. News websites, representing 30–40% of the 
SERPs in English, were also less frequent (0–10%) in the top 
10. The exception was the SERP in French where news websites 
represented 60% of the top 10 websites compared to 31% in the 
whole SERP, and a similar trend was observed in Portuguese (40% 
in the top 10, 30% in the whole search).
Testimonials, celebrities, and caM
We investigated whether websites contained a testimonial 
 
(personal story), mentioned a celebrity, or mentioned CAM.
As shown in Figure 1A, testimonials were present in around 
30% of websites returned by the Australian and French Google 
searches, but were much less frequent in Italian, Mandarin, 
Portuguese, and Arabic websites.
Celebrities (Figure 1B) were present with high frequency in 
English, French, and Mandarin websites. The celebrities most 
frequently mentioned, and present in most languages, were 
Donald Trump (present in all SERPs, ranging from 27 webpages in 
Australia, 19 in UK, 18 in Mandarin, with a minimum of 1 in 
Arabic), Jenny McCarthy (present in SERPs in English, Portuguese, 
and Mandarin, 19 times in Australia, 12 in google.com, and 9 in 
UK), Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (23 webpages in Australia, 17 in google.
com, 16 in UK), and Robert De Niro (present in all searches 
except Mandarin and Portuguese). Other celebrities mentioned 
were Dan Burton, Jim Carrey, Chuck Norris, and Luc Montagnier. 
Other names were language- or country-specific. In French, 
Martine Ferguson-André was mentioned in 23 websites while 
Agnès Buzyn was mentioned by 7 webpages. In Italian, Beatrice 
Lorenzin, was mentioned in 19 webpages. A short description of 
the main celebrities mentioned is given in Table 5. Interestingly, 
most of them were named by vaccine-positive or -neutral websites 
when describing the antivaccine movement.
Few websites mentioned CAM, and their frequency was 
higher in Mandarin and Portuguese websites (4–5%), while in 
other SERPs, they accounted for no more than 2% of the websites 
(Figure 1C).

(average of all SERPs, 6.9%). Vaccine-negative views were also 
infrequent in news websites (averaging 5.2% all SERPs).
We also analyzed whether the mention of testimonials, celeb-
rities, CAM, or religion was associated with a particular stance on 
vaccines. Figure 4 represents the stance on vaccines in all web-
pages from all SERPs mentioning testimonials, celebrities, CAM, 
or religion. The frequency of vaccine-negative websites was sig-
nificantly higher in webpages reporting testimonials (P = 0.0002 
by Fisher’s test), CAM (P = 0.0001), or religion (P = 0.02) when 
compared to the total. On the other hand, websites mentioning 
celebrities had a similar pattern as the total search, indicating that 
even celebrities such as Trump were not mentioned in a vaccine-
negative context.
adjuvants
There is a diffuse concern that the chemicals, including adjuvants 
and preservatives, added to vaccines to act as adjuvants may be a 
cause of autism. We, therefore, took note of when a webpage men-
tioned the presence of it in the text. The chemical name occurring 
with the highest frequency was thimerosal (441 webpages, 60% of 
total), followed by the partially synonym mercury (184 webpages, 
25% of total), aluminum (101, 14%), and formaldehyde (15, 2%). 
These adjuvants and preservatives were mentioned in a large 
proportion of the websites: 56% in Google.com, 50% in UK, 93% 
in Australia, 58% in French, 28% in Italian, 45% in Mandarin, 
71% in Portuguese, and 32% in Arabic.
A sub-analysis of the adjuvant mentioned by websites and the 
stance of the website on vaccines showed that vaccine-negative 
websites mentioned aluminum with a frequency that was nine-
times higher than pro-vaccine, and four-times higher than neu-
tral, websites (Table 7). Although this trend was also observed for 
“mercury,” it was not observed for “thimerosal.”
news
Because of the high frequency of news websites, accounting for 
about one-third of all SERPs, we have summarized in Table 8 the 
main topics covered by these websites.
As mentioned above, vaccine-negative news webpages were less 
frequent than expected in the whole SERPs. Vaccine-negative news 
articles were highest in Mandarin, Portuguese, UK, and google.com 
(12.1, 7.3, 7, and 6.8%, respectively) and lowest in French, Australian, 
Italian, and Arabic (0, 2, 2.1, 3.9%, respectively) webpages.
JaMa score
The median JAMA score for all SERPs is shown in Figure 5. The 
Arabic SERP had a significantly lower JAMA score than any other 
SERP. Google.com and Google.co.uk had a significantly higher

DiscUssiOn
The varied composition of the SERP returned by Google, with only 
30% being non-affiliated websites or blogs, and the rest repre-
senting a wide range of news outlets, professional or government 
organizations, and scientific journals, represents a good sample of 
the information on the topic of vaccines and autism that the public 
is exposed to.
Because we analyzed the first 200 websites returned by Google, 
the list is not just a sample of all that is available in what has 
been called the infosphere (25), but it also reflects the visibility, or 
ranking, given by Google. For this reason, we did not just look at 
the composition of the SERP but also how webpages are ranked, 
particularly, the first 10 results that are more likely to be read (26).
Despite retraction of his paper in 2010, Dr. Wakefield is 
still highly mentioned (a word count found his name recur-
ring 462 times in the Google.com search, 551 in UK, 706 in 
Australia, 378 in French, 361 in Italian, 21 in Arabic, 195 in 
Portuguese, and 11 in Mandarin). Although his original 
paper did not appear in any SERP, a letter he published 
in the Lancet in 1999 was present in both the UK and the 
Australian SERP (but not Google.com). In French, two 
websites (one Belgian and one French) displayed a video of 
Andrew Wakefield’s interview with subtitles in French (http://

Vaccines and Autism on Google
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org
June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1215
It is important to be aware that the autism-MMR scare was not 
borne out of an obscure sect but from scientific papers published 
in respectable and authoritative journals, leading to a widespread 
concern even among health professionals.
This seems to be true today when articles published in aca-
demic journals of varied respectability can have a significant 
impact as they may be perceived as providing a scientific basis 
for antivaccine, or just vaccine-skeptical, positions. A study has 
shown that, in the US, a drop in the MMR vaccination rate was 
observed soon after the publication of original scientific reports, 
even before this was the subject of media coverage (27). These 
may also be ranked higher by search engines because scientific 
articles may be considered authoritative and, therefore, proxies 
for high quality information.
It may be surprising that in the UK and Australian websites, 
but not in Google.com, a proportion of SJs were vaccine-negative. 
As mentioned above, very few websites of SJs were present in 
non-English SERPs, not surprisingly as scientific articles are

usually in English. Of the six scientific articles in Google.com, 
none were vaccine-negative, whereas UK and Australian websites 
(13 scientific articles each) had some vaccine-negative scientific 
articles (three and one, respectively). In the UK SERP, three 
vaccine-negative scientific papers were found. One was a 2002 
paper in LabMedicine, published by the Oxford University Press 
and the American Society for Clinical Pathology and, to our 
knowledge, never retracted (28); a second a letter by Wakefield 
published in the Lancet in 1999 in response to criticism over his 
previous paper (29); a third is a 2017 editorial published in the 
“Madridge Journal of Vaccines,” a journal published in the US but, 
unlike The Lancet and LabMedicine, not listed by PubMed and the 
National Library of Medicine (30).
In particular, the 2002 paper published by Oxford University 
Press was ranked second in the UK SERP. Repeating the “autism 
vaccines” search on Google.co.uk 6 months later still returned 
this article second in the ranking (data not shown). This online 
article was not found in Google.com or in the Australian SERP.
In the Australian search, two websites were collections of 
scientific papers supporting a causal link between vaccines and 
autism, a third the Wakefield letter mentioned above, and a fourth 
a paper by the organization “Informed Consent Action Network” 
that, even if not published in a journal, and it might be question-
able whether it could be legitimately defined a scientific paper as 
it is unclear whether it was peer reviewed, has all the features of 
a scientific review. Classifying these papers as vaccine-negative 
was a shared but subjective decision of the authors who reviewed 
those websites, and we provide the references in Data Sheet S1 in 
Supplementary Material in case the reader wishes to reassess our 
coding from a different perspective.
As noted in a Nature editorial by Leask (31), “just four months 
after the publication that triggered the MMR scare, 13% of 
general practitioners and 27% of practice nurses in north Wales 
thought it very likely or possible that the vaccine was associated 
with autism (32)”
. Leask noted that, to improve uptake of vaccina-
tions, we should engage “fence-sitting parents” (31). This means 
that pro-immunization information needs to address those issues 
and concerns that anti-vaccine websites raise, such as the men-
tion of aluminum or mercury as a component of thimerosal, as 
highlighted by our study. Furthermore, the present study also 
advocates the dissemination of pro-vaccine information on the 
same websites typologies that perpetuate the “fake science” that 
vaccines cause autism.
Despite the science behind it being discredited, there are 
several reasons as to why the association between the MMR vac-
cine and autism is still present amongst the lay public. Flaherty 
pointed out that this is partly due to autism being a complex 
condition without a single, established causal mechanism (33). It 
should be noted that a search of websites mentioning “vaccines 
and autism” returns websites mentioning other vaccines, not just 
the MMR, as this could suggest a potential extrapolation of the 
link with autism to other types of vaccines.
The strong association between vaccine-negative stance and 
CAM, as well as commercial websites often selling “natural prod-
ucts,” confirms that cultural factors may reinforce an antivaccine 
stance by the association of vaccines with capitalism, big pharma, 
and profit.
Another finding of the present study is that government 
organizations accounted for only 1.3–6.7% of websites (Table 3). 
This is markedly less than what we found previously in a study on 
influenza vaccine where governmental websites represented 17% 
of the SERP in English and 42% of that in Italian (16). The reason 
for this is probably that, in the present study, we specifically intro-
duced the search term “autism,” which may not be mentioned in 
most of the government websites unless for educational purpose, 
which is to explain that there is no link to autism. The other possi-
bility is that, in the case of influenza, there is a strong vaccination 
campaign because it is done on a voluntary basis, while the MMR 
is either part of the routine immunization schedule of babies (e.g., 
UK) or compulsory (e.g., Italy since 2017 or France for babies 
born after 01/01/2018).
The fact that Trump is the most frequently mentioned celebrity 
reminds us of the difference between countries, where in some 
countries antivaccine sentiment is prevalent among alternative, 
left-wing groups, and right-wing, individualist, groups in others. 
We could not find a significant association between mention of 
religious issues and sentiment about vaccines. In fact, religious 
beliefs may be important in the confidence in vaccines (34), 
although this may be a confounder as there are few religious 
groups who officially reject vaccinations (35).

Arif et al.
Vaccines and Autism on Google
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org
June 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1215
The fact that news outlets represent 30–50% of the websites 
indicates that the link between vaccine and autism is a topical 
and newsworthy topic. From this point of view, it is reassuring 
that news websites returned by Google have a low frequency 
of vaccine-negative articles. This is not to say that there are no 
antivaccine news articles (many vaccine-negative articles have 
been published by top tabloid newspapers in the UK) but rather 
that these are not given visibility by the algorithm used by Google.
However, the information quality criteria used by Google do 
not always penalize vaccine-negative websites. This study shows 
that, while in Google.com the first vaccine-negative webpage 
came up only as 43rd, in the local UK and Australian SERPs 
some were found in the first 10 websites, and this was even more 
marked in non-English SERPs.
Interestingly, this is similar to what we observed in a previous 
research where we analyzed the information returned by Google 
on influenza vaccine or influenza prevention in English and Italian. 
While in google.com in English there were no vaccine-negative 
websites or websites promoting non-evidence-based medicine 
approaches to influenza prevention, this was not true for a search 
in Italian (16).
Of course, here we only use Google as a mesh to collect a 
sample of the web and the websites returned in the SERP might 
just reflect “what is out there.” However, it is important to note 
that the overall frequency of vaccine-negative webpages was not 
so different in the different SERPs, and we have no explanation 
for this observation. One wonders whether the vaccine-negative 
study published in a SJ was ranked high in the UK SERP because 
the publisher is Oxford University Press, or whether the one in 
the top 10 in the Australian SERP was ranked high because the 
.org domain was taken as a proxy of authority and quality. It is also 
possible that the higher ranking of vaccine-negative webpages in 
some SERPs is due to the fact that they receive a high number of 
clicks in that country or language.
Another interesting finding of this study is the difference in 
the JAMA score of different SERPs. Websites in Arabic showed 
the lowest JAMA score than all other languages. Websites from 
Google.com and Google.co.uk ranked higher than those from 
the localized versions in English-Australia, French, and Italian. 
The fact that the mean JAMA score of websites returned in the 
Australian SERP is also significantly lower than that of those 
returned by Google.com or Google.UK seem to exclude that the 
language alone explains the difference.
One obvious question is how much the antivaccine information 
impacts on the uptake of vaccines. Data from the Organization 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show 
that, in 2015, Italy had the lowest vaccination rate for measles 
(85%), People’s Republic of China the highest (99%), Australia 
and France 91%, the USA 92%, the UK 95%, Belgium and Brazil 
96%, Portugal and Saudi Arabia, 98% (36, 37). The low immu-
nization rate is the reason why the Italian government made the 
MMR vaccine compulsory in July 2017, France followed in 2018 
and Australia is also going along that route.
We assessed whether there was a correlation between the 
percentage of vaccine-negative webpages from Figure 2A and 
either the safety-related skepticism in the countries analyzed 
(34) or with the uptake of measles vaccination in 2016 (data from 
 
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS). There 
was no statistically significant correlation using the Spearman-
Rank test or the Pearson correlation coefficient (data and 
results of the statistical analysis are provided in Data Sheet S2 in 
Supplementary Material).
It should also be noted that the search in Mandarin was per-
formed using the localized version of Google in Singapore; because 
the Google search engine is not available in the People’s Republic 
of China, our results cannot be extrapolated to the information 
available in that country. We should also bear in mind that most 
of the languages investigated are not specific to a single country. 
Hence, making correlation between webpages in one language and 
vaccination rate or sentiment in one country, is not immediate.
This lack of correlation might support the view that the impact 
of online information on vaccination acceptance may be exagger-
ated. For instance, a study among French mothers reported that 
the main source of information on vaccination is the family physi-
cian or pediatrician (84–90%) and the Internet accounts for only 
10–12% (8), while a study on 1737 Canadian parents showed that, 
to obtain trustworthy and reliable information on vaccines, 68% of 
them would ask a physician, and just 27% the Internet (38). If we 
also consider the fact that only a small percentage of parents refuse 
to vaccinate their children, one could conclude that we should not 
overestimate the impact of webpages with a vaccine-negative stance. 
Other issues may be at the basis of vaccine skepticism such as the 
perceived role of big pharma and governments or the underestima-
tion of potential risks, as in the case of the dengue vaccine (39).
A major limitation of this study is that we only looked at 
webpages and did not investigate social networks. Studies have 
previously explored this area of the Internet and have analyzed 
their features in English and French (6, 8). Another limitation 
of the present study is that we analyzed the sample of the online 
information on the topic but not all websites will have the same 
impact. Even within the first ten results, readers may just briefly 
glance through them using clues to decide what to read. To assess 
which top-ranking websites attract attention of the user and are 
actually read, research should be undertaken by asking volunteers 
to rank websites or, alternatively, their attention could be moni-
tored using eye-tracking software (40). A further limitation of our 
study is that we used the same, neutral, search string (“vaccine 
autism”) without taking into account potential differences in 
the most searched terms used, which could well be different in 
different languages. It is likely that users could find more biased 
information by using more negative search terms, although a 
recent study using eye-tracking software to investigate the search 
behavior of 56 volunteers found that users are more likely to use 
neutral search terms (19).
In summary, the main findings of this study are the marked 
differences in the visibility of websites with a negative stance on 
vaccines given by the ranking by Google across not only differ-
ent languages but also in different localized searches in English. 
Public health authorities, particularly those acting internationally, 
will need to take these differences into account when designing 
websites aiming at promoting vaccinations. They will also need 
to consider the relevance that issues like the adjuvants included 
in vaccine preparation have in the information available and 
clarify these issues to correct misinformation. Counteracting 
disinformation about vaccines by health authorities is part of the 
solution, but the loss of confidence in vaccines goes far beyond

misinformation. Communities, social environment, educational 
level, are few examples of factors affecting the vaccine confidence. 
Education, as well as transparency, would be an important aspect 
to keep in mind when trying to increase vaccine confidence.
