IMPORTANCE Previous studies have shown increasing prevalence of diabetes in China, which
now has the world’
s largest diabetes epidemic.
OBJECTIVES To estimate the recent prevalence and to investigate the ethnic variation of
diabetes and prediabetes in the Chinese adult population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A nationally representative cross-sectional survey in
2013 in mainland China, which consisted of 170 287 participants.
EXPOSURES Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were measured for all
participants. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was conducted for all participants without
diagnosed diabetes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were total diabetes and prediabetes
defined according to the 2010 American Diabetes Association criteria. Awareness and
treatment were also evaluated. Hemoglobin A1c concentration of less than 7.0% among
treated diabetes patients was considered adequate glycemic control. Minority ethnic groups
in China with at least 1000 participants (Tibetan, Zhuang, Manchu, Uyghur, and Muslim) were
compared with Han participants.
RESULTS Among the Chinese adult population, the estimated standardized prevalence of
total diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes was 10.9% (95% CI, 10.4%-11.5%); that of
diagnosed diabetes, 4.0% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.3%); and that of prediabetes, 35.7% (95% CI,
34.1%-37.4%). Among persons with diabetes, 36.5% (95% CI, 34.3%-38.6%) were aware of
their diagnosis and 32.2% (95% CI, 30.1%-34.2%) were treated; 49.2% (95% CI,
46.9%-51.5%) of patients treated had adequate glycemic control. Tibetan and Muslim
Chinese had significantly lower crude prevalence of diabetes than Han participants (14.7%
[95% CI, 14.6%-14.9%] for Han, 4.3% [95% CI, 3.5%-5.0%] for Tibetan, and 10.6% [95% CI,
9.3%-11.9%] for Muslim; P < .001 for Tibetan and Muslim compared with Han). In the
multivariable logistic models, the adjusted odds ratios compared with Han participants were
0.42 (95% CI, 0.35-0.50) for diabetes and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84) for prediabetes for
Tibetan Chinese and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.63-0.85) for diabetes and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.86) for
prediabetes in Muslim Chinese.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults in China, the estimated overall prevalence of
diabetes was 10.9%, and that for prediabetes was 35.7%. Differences from previous
estimates for 2010 may be due to an alternate method of measuring hemoglobin A1c.

slargestdiabetesepidemic,whichcon-
tinues to increase.1 The prevalence of diabetes in China
was reported to be 0.67% in 1980 and 11.6% in the latest
publishednationwideestimatein2010.2-5Moreover,according
tothe2010survey,theprevalenceofprediabeteswas50.1%,im-
plyingthatapproximately500millionChineseadultsmayhave
had prediabetes.5 However, this high estimate for prediabetes
raised concern over the possibility of an overestimation.6,7 As a
disorder of glucose metabolism, diabetes mellitus affects mul-
tiple organ systems and is associated with a variety of vascular
andseveralnonvascularcomplications.8-10Ongoingreliablees-
timations are needed to plan effective national prevention and
treatment programs for diabetes management.
In addition, although a few epidemiologic studies were
available to estimate the prevalence of diabetes among differ-
ent ethnic groups in China, the data were from different stud-
ies conducted at different times.11-13 Direct comparison under
a consistent survey design is therefore of importance for policy
making for diabetes management in Chinese minorities.14
This study was conducted to provide more recent esti-
mates of the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in China
and to investigate their ethnic pattern, using a nationally rep-
resentative survey conducted in 2013.
Methods
The China Chronic Disease and Risk Factors Surveillance study
is a nationwide cross-sectional study conducted every 3 years.
Thestudywasdesignedtomeasuretheepidemiologyofchronic
diseaseandassociatedriskfactorsbyselectinganationallyrep-
resentative sample of the general population.5,15,16 In the 2013
survey,anintegratednationalmortalitysurveillancesystemwas
usedtoprovideanationallyandprovinciallyrepresentativesur-
vey of the country.17 This new system increased the number of
surveillance points from 161 to 605 to cover major geographic
areas of all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipali-
ties in mainland China, and enlarged the surveillance popula-
tion covered from 6% to 24% of the Chinese population. The
firstlevelofsamplingwasstratifiedby31provinces.Withineach
province, 8 strata were then generated according to the overall
population size (high/low), proportion of urban population
(high/low),andmortalityrate(high/low).Atotalof298surveil-
lance points were used. The complex multistage sampling de-
sign, stringent quality assurance, and quality control program
were previously reported.5,16 Participants (179 347) were en-
rolled in the survey from 1176 rural townships or urban subdis-
tricts. The overall response rate with the standard definition by
the American Association for Public Opinion Research was
93.4% (the cooperation rate was 96.2% and the refusal rate was
2.7%) (eTable 1 in the Supplement).18 Overall, 6.25% of the
sampledfamiliescouldnotbeaccessedduring3attemptsmade
on 3 days. These households were replaced by another house-
hold with a similar family structure in the same village or resi-
dential area (eTable 2 in Supplement). Only persons who had
beenlivingintheircurrentresidenceforatleast6monthswithin
1 year before the survey and were aged 18 years or older were
eligible for the survey. Exclusion criteria were communal resi-
dences (eg, university dormitory, military unit, nursing home);
patients with severe diseases or having cognitive, language, or
mentaldisorderswhocouldnotparticipateintheinterview;and
pregnancy.Additionally,werestrictedtheanalyticsampletopar-
ticipants with complete information on major risk factors (ie,
age, sex, location, economic development level, body mass in-
dex [BMI], and history of diabetes or glycemia markers). This
analysis included 170 287 participants (94.9% of those en-
rolled);9060participantswereexcludedbecauseofmissingin-
formation on major risk factors.
The study protocol was approved by the ethical review
committee of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and other participating institutes. Written informed
consent was obtained from all study participants.
Data Collection for the Nationwide Cross-sectional Study
Acomprehensivequestionnaireincludinginformationondemo-
graphic characteristics, medical history, and lifestyle risk fac-
tors was administered by trained interviewers. Staff at local
health stations or community clinics in the participants’resi-
dential area were trained according to a standard protocol. In-
formation on the ethnic groups of participants was self-
reported but cross-checked with participants’ national
identification. There are 56 ethnic groups in China. The 10 larg-
est ones were listed in the questionnaire and others were col-
lectedbyopen-endedquestions.Analysesbyethnicgroupswere
restricted to those with at least 1000 participants, resulting in
inclusion of Tibetan (Zang), Zhuang, Manchu (Man), Uyghur
(Wei), and Muslim (Hui) ethnic groups. Each surveillance point
was categorized into underdeveloped, intermediately devel-
oped, or developed according to the region’
s gross domestic
product per capita in 2013. Blood samples were collected for all
participants after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Serum
samplesandmeasurementsoffastingplasmaglucoseleveland
2-hour plasma glucose level after 75 g glucose were managed
under the same procedure used in the 2010 survey, as re-
ported previously.5 In contrast, to overcome limitations in the
calculated level of venous hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) used previ-
ously,HbA1cwasdirectlymeasuredfromvenousbloodsamples
inthe2013surveyinasinglelaboratoryusingquantitativehigh-
performance liquid chromatography and the boronate affinity
method (Bio-Rad D-10 Hemoglobin Analyzer). Venous blood
samples were stored at –80°C until HbA1c was measured within
1 month, which is within the range of stability according to the
Key Points
Question WhatistheprevalenceofdiabetesandprediabetesinChina?
Findings In this nationally representative cross-sectional survey
conducted in 2013 in mainland China with 170 287 participants,
the estimated overall prevalence of total diabetes was 10.9%; of
prediabetes, 35.7%. Tibetan and Muslim Chinese individuals had
significantly lower prevalence of diabetes than Han participants.
Meaning The estimated prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes
in China differs by ethnic group, and the estimated overall high
prevalence may be associated with different methods of
measuring hemoglobin A1c.

Outcomes
Diagnosed diabetes was defined as a self-reported diagnosis
that was determined previously by a health care professional.
Undiagnosed diabetes was defined according to the American
Diabetes Association 2010 criteria, which included fasting
plasmaglucoselevelof126mg/dLorgreater,2-hourplasmaglu-
cose level of 200 mg/dL or greater (after 75 g glucose), or HbA1c
level of 6.5% or higher. Total diabetes was the sum of the num-
ber of patients who received a diagnosis of diabetes and the
numberofpatientswithundiagnoseddiabetes.Prediabeteswas
defined as any participants who did not have diabetes but who
hadanHbA1c levelof5.7%to6.4%,fastingplasmaglucoselevel
of 100 to 125 mg/dL, or 2-hour plasma glucose level of 140 to
199 mg/dL. Awareness was defined as the proportion of indi-
viduals with physician-diagnosed diabetes among all patients
with diabetes. Treatment was defined as the proportion of in-
dividualsreceivingdiabetesmedicationsamongallpatientswith
diabetes. Control was defined as the proportion of individuals
with an HbA1c concentration of less than 7.0% among patients
with diabetes who were taking medication.
Statistical Analysis
Standardized prevalence was estimated in the overall popu-
lation and in subgroups of sex, age, location (urban/rural),
stages of economic development, and categories of BMI in the
Chinese adult population. The subgroup variables were se-
lected before the analyses were conducted. Standardized
prevalence was calculated unless stated otherwise, using the
weightcoefficientstorepresenttheoverallChineseadultpopu-
lation aged 18 years or older. Weight coefficients accommo-
dated the sampling scheme for unequal probabilities of sample
selection, as well as the poststratification weights, which har-
monized the sample structure of the survey with that of the
2010 Chinese population census. For the analyses of ethnic
variation, unweighted estimations are presented because eth-
nicity was not considered in the multistage sampling design.
The χ2 test was used to compare crude prevalences. A num-
ber of participants (9060) were excluded from the analyses

a Weighted prevalence to be representative of the Chinese population was
calculated. Diagnosed diabetes was defined as a self-reported previous
diagnosis by health care professionals. Total diabetes included persons with
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined
according to the American Diabetes Association 2010 criteria, which included
diagnosis of diabetes with an FPG level of 126 mg/dL or greater, 2-hour PG level
of 200 mg/dL or greater (after 75 g glucose), or HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher.
Diabetes based on information with diagnosed diabetes, FPG level, and 2-hour
PG level corresponded to the 1999 World Health Organization criteria.
Prediabetes was defined as any participants who did not have diabetes
but who had an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, FPG level of 100 to 125 mg/dL,
or 2-hour PG level of 140 to 199 mg/dL. Economic levels were categorized into
underdeveloped, intermediately developed, or developed according to the
surveillance point regions’gross domestic product per capita in 2013.

43.5 years (SD 16.2), BMI was 24.0, and 57% were women. The
mean fasting plasma glucose level was 100.5 mg/dL, and the
2-hour plasma glucose level was 114.2 mg/dL, similar to those

10.7%) in women and 11.7% (95% CI, 10.9%-12.4%) in men
(Table 2). Four percent (95% CI, 3.6%-4.3%) of Chinese adults
had previously received a diagnosis of diabetes; 6.9% (95% CI,
6.7%-7.2%) of the population had received a new diagnosis by
glycemicbiomarkers(ie,fastingplasmaglucose,2-hourplasma

a Awareness was defined as the proportion of individuals with a self-reported
history of physician-diagnosed diabetes among all patients with total diabetes.
Treatment was defined as the proportion of individuals receiving diabetes
medications among all patients with diabetes. The analytic sample for
awareness and treatment was all patients with diabetes (ie, column 3 in
Table 2). Control was defined as the proportion of individuals with an HbA1c
concentration of less than 7.0% among patients with diabetes who were
treated. The analytic sample for control was all patients with diabetes who
were treated (ie, column 4) minus 53 patients with diabetes under treatment
who had missing information on HbA1c and therefore were excluded for the
calculation of control of diabetes.

 The overall proportion of patients who were aware of their
diabetes condition was 36.5% (95% CI, 34.3%-38.6%) (Table 3).
The proportion of women who were aware of their diabetes
condition was 39.8% (95% CI, 37.5%-42.2%), and of men it was
33.5% (95% CI, 31.2%-35.9%); 32.2% (95% CI, 30.1%-34.2%) of
all patients with diabetes were receiving antidiabetic medica-
tion.Amongpatientstreated,49.2%(95%CI,46.9%-51.5%)had
HbA1c levels controlled to a concentration of less than 7.0%.
The proportion of patients who were aware of their dia-
betes and treated for it was higher in the older population
(P < .001 for both), women (P < .001 for both), and urban resi-
dents (P < .001 for both). The proportion of patients who con-
trolled their HbA1c levels well was higher in younger individu-
als (P = .03) and in urban residents (P < .001), but broadly
similar across sex, BMI categories, and economic develop-
ment conditions. The characteristics of treated diabetes pa-
tients with and without adequate glycemic control were also
compared (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Of patients without
adequate glycemic control, a higher percentage received in-
sulin treatment.
Ethnic Variation
Compared with Han participants, whose crude diabetes preva-
lence was 14.7% (95% CI, 14.6%-14.9%), the crude prevalence
of total diabetes was lower among major minority ethnic
groups, except for Manchu participants (Table 4). Tibetan and
Muslim adults had the lowest and second lowest prevalence
of total diabetes (4.3% [95% CI, 3.5%-5.0%] vs 10.6% [95% CI,
9.3%-11.9%]; both P < .001 compared with Han participants).
For prediabetes, Tibetan and Muslim adults had a similar
crude prevalence that was significantly lower than that of Han
participants (31.3% [95% CI, 29.7%-32.9%] for Tibetan, 31.9%
[95% CI, 29.9%-33.9%] for Muslim, and 38.8% [95% CI, 38.5%-
39.0%] for Han; Tibetan and Muslim P < .001 compared with
Han) (Table 5). Manchu participants had a significantly higher
prevalence of prediabetes than did Chinese Han (43.4% [95%
CI, 41.3%-45.5%]; P < .001).
In the multivariable logistic models for diabetes, the age-
and sex-adjusted odds ratio for Tibetan Chinese was 0.34 (95%
CI, 0.29-0.41); for Muslim Chinese, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.88)
(Table 6). In the fully adjusted multivariable logistic models,
the adjusted odds ratios compared with Han participants were
0.42 (95% CI, 0.35-0.50) for diabetes and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-
0.84) for prediabetes for Tibetan Chinese and 0.73 (95% CI,
0.63-0.85) for diabetes and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.86) for pre-
diabetes for Muslim Chinese.
Discussion

in 2013, it was estimated that 10.9% of Chinese adults have

ties in China.
The prevalence of diabetes, at 10.9%, was only slightly
lower than the prevalence of total diabetes in the US popula-
tion (12%-14%) in 2011-2012, although the mean BMI was still
muchlowerthanthatoftheUSpopulation(24.0vs28.7).19The
prevalenceofdiabeteswasmuchhigherinoverweightBMIcat-
egories in this study than in the US population (15.4% vs 8%-
9%). This was consistent with the finding that Asians may have
a higher risk of developing diabetes at a given BMI. However,
when the Asian-specific BMI cutoffs were applied, the preva-
lence of diabetes for overweight persons was more compa-
rable with that of the US population (Table 2).
The updated prevalence of prediabetes in 2013 was signifi-
cantly lower than that in 2010 (35.7% vs 50.1%). With approxi-
mately 1.09 billion adults in total in mainland China, it is pro-
jectedthat388.1millionChineseadults(200.4millionmenand
187.7 million women) may have had prediabetes in 2013, con-
siderably reduced from the projected number of 493.4 million

the same study protocol and followed identical, strict strate-

Chronic Disease and Risk Factors Surveillance study. The most

UnitedStateswas36.5%in2011-2012,19similartothatinthe2013
Chinese survey. Overall, 47% of the Chinese adult population
was estimated to have either diabetes or prediabetes, slightly

 surveyprovidedenoughparticipantsenrolledinmajorChinese
minority groups. Compared with Han participants, Tibetan
adults had a significantly lower prevalence of both total diabe-
tes and prediabetes. They had generally low BMIs (eTable 5 in
theSupplement),whichmightbeattributedtomultiplefactors,
includingeconomicdevelopmentandlifestylefactors.Accord-
ing to the survey, Tibetans may have higher levels of physical
activity, which is to be expected because of their nomadic way
of life. They consume more meat and fewer vegetables or fruits
(eTable 5). It has also been reported that Tibetans have a spe-
cialized diet, customarily drinking copious tea with salt and
butter.21Moreover,personsdwellingathighaltitudeshavebeen
reported to have lower diabetes prevalence than those living
at low altitudes.22 These data are all consistent with findings
fromthisstudy.ItwasalsopreviouslyshownthatTibetanhigh-
landershaveacceleratedvulnerabilitytodiabeteswithlifestyle
change or aging.23 However, reasons for the ethnic variation in
diabetes prevalence are difficult to determine from the cross-
sectional surveillance data. Further investigation is required to
confirm and find the causes.
Thisstudyhasseveralstrengths.Thesurveywasconducted
in a large nationally representative sample of the general popu-
lation in China, following a strict quality assurance and control
program to ensure data validity and reliability. Compared with
the 2010 survey, the 2013 survey recruited 70% more individu-
als and had nearly double the number of study sites, covering

a Odds ratios (ORs) of minority ethnic groups were calculated with multivariable
logistic regression. Ethnic group was defined as a 7-category variable in the
model. Seven categories were defined as Chinese Han (reference), Tibetan,
Zhuang, Manchu, Uyghur, Muslim, and others. Numbers of participants were
the total number of participants used in the logistic regression, including all 7
categories of the participants. Seventy-six participants were removed from the
total 170 287 participants for model 1 because of missing information on the
ethnic group; 8141 of 170 211 participants belonging to other minority ethnic
groups were included in the model, but the ORs are not listed in the Table.
Data for participants with missing information on the relative risk factors were
removed. Sensitivity analysis using the study set with complete information
on all risk factors in model 5 is shown in eTable 6 in the Supplement.

 more areas within each province and resulting in better repre-
sentationoftheChinesepopulation.Thelargesamplesizeofthis
study provided, to our knowledge, the first direct comparison
of diabetes prevalence among major minority groups in China
within 1 survey, using the latest diabetes diagnosis criteria.
Thisstudyalsohasseverallimitations.First,wedidnotdis-
tinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Limited informa-
tion is available in regard to the prevalence of type 1 diabetes
in China. According to the Chinese clinical guideline for pre-
venting diabetes, less than 5% of patients with diabetes have
type 1 diabetes.24 Second, all the glycemic markers in the sur-
veyweremeasuredonlyonceforeachparticipant,althoughthe
guideline for diagnosing diabetes required confirmation by re-
peatedtesting.Third,nonresidentssuchascollegestudentsand
migrant workers were not included in the study because of the
sampling design. These groups were more likely to be healthy
andyoung,withalowerincidenceofdiabetes,whichcouldlead
to the overestimation of diabetes in the population. Fourth, be-
cause of missing data on important information, 9060 partici-
pants (5% of the total sample) were excluded from analysis. Al-
thoughthecharacteristicsofexcludedparticipantsweresimilar
(eTable 3), their exclusion could have affected the estimates.
Conclusions
Among adults in China in 2013, the estimated overall preva-
lence of diabetes was 10.9% and that of prediabetes was 35.7%.
Differences from previous estimates for 2010 may be due to
an alternate method of measuring HbA1c.
