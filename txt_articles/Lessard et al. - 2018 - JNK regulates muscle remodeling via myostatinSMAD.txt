Skeletal muscle has a remarkable plasticity to adapt and remodel in response to environ-
mental cues, such as physical exercise. Endurance exercise stimulates improvements in
muscle oxidative capacity, while resistance exercise induces muscle growth. Here we show
that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a molecular switch that when active, stimulates
muscle fibers to grow, resulting in increased muscle mass. Conversely, when muscle JNK
activation is suppressed, an alternative remodeling program is initiated, resulting in smaller,
more oxidative muscle fibers, and enhanced aerobic fitness. When muscle is exposed to
mechanical stress, JNK initiates muscle growth via phosphorylation of the transcription
factor, SMAD2, at specific linker region residues leading to inhibition of the growth sup-
pressor, myostatin. In human skeletal muscle, this JNK/SMAD signaling axis is activated by
resistance exercise, but not endurance exercise. We conclude that JNK acts as a key med-
iator of muscle remodeling during exercise via regulation of myostatin/SMAD signaling.

keletal muscle is our largest organ by mass, and makes
critical contributions to whole-body health due to its
indispensable role in metabolism and mobility. Further
contributing to the clinical importance of skeletal muscle is its
remarkable plasticity to undergo specialized phenotypic adapta-
tions, or remodeling events, in response to specific mechanical or
molecular signals1,2. Remodeling of muscle toward an endurance
phenotype, which includes increased capillary density and
enhanced oxidative capacity, reduces the risk of metabolic dis-
eases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease3–5. On
the other hand, adaptations leading to muscle fiber hypertrophy
and increased strength can offset morbidity and mortality asso-
ciated with muscle wasting disorders that occur with age (sar-
copenia) and cancer (cachexia)6–8. Endurance and hypertrophic
adaptations represent two distinct classes of muscle remodeling
programs that can lead to clinically significant changes in muscle
phenotype and have profound effects on health and longevity.
However, there is evidence that opposing signaling pathways may
regulate muscle adaptation in response to endurance and resis-
tance exercise9–11. Determining the precise mechanisms that
contribute to these contrasting muscle remodeling programs is
necessary to target muscle adaptation for optimal clinical benefit.
Muscle contraction and physical exercise are potent means to
stimulate changes in muscle phenotype; thus contributing to the
ability of exercise to act as an effective therapy for the prevention
and treatment of numerous chronic diseases4,12. The molecular
and morphological adaptations in skeletal muscle induced by
exercise are specific to the modality of exercise undertaken1,2.
Endurance, also known as aerobic, exercise (e.g., running, cycling)
induces an “endurance” adaptive program in muscle, leading to
increased cardiorespiratory fitness and metabolic health. In con-
trast, resistance exercise training (e.g., weight lifting) stimulates a
hypertrophic adaptive program, leading to increased muscle mass
and strength. Given the unparalleled ability of exercise to modify
muscle phenotype, there is much interest in the development of
pharmacological strategies for the treatment of chronic disease
that mimic the effects of exercise. However, the mechanisms that
allow for modality-specific muscle adaptations in response to
endurance or resistance exercise are incompletely understood.
The adaptation of muscle to endurance or resistance exercise is
a highly variable trait in humans and animals, with some indi-
viduals having greater adaptive responses to the same exercise
stimulus than others13–15. Some of the heterogeneity in exercise
response is believed to be due to inherited factors13,16. However,
environmental factors such as advanced age and chronic disease
can also impair the adaptive response of muscle to exercise, or
physically limit the ability of an individual to undertake exercise
training regimens17. Determining the molecular mechanisms that
mediate muscle adaptation with exercise is a key strategy to
improve muscle function in populations with low adaptive
response or limited mobility. In addition, elucidating the signals
that allow muscle to distinguish between endurance and hyper-
trophic adaptations will allow for the targeted development of
therapies to induce the most appropriate adaptive program to
treat a particular disease state or condition.
As a means to discover the molecular mechanisms that regulate
endurance adaptations in skeletal muscle, our previous work
utilized rodent models generated by selective breeding for low- or
high-adaptive response to endurance exercise16. The failure to
improve aerobic capacity in low responders to endurance training
occurred in conjunction with a less oxidative muscle phenotype
and deficiencies in exercise-induced angiogenesis in skeletal
muscle16. Importantly, blunted endurance remodeling in the
skeletal muscle of low responders to endurance exercise was
associated with increased risk for chronic metabolic disease,
including
insulin
resistance,
dyslipidemia,
and
increased
adiposity. Our data demonstrated that hyper-activation of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
was associated with the failure of muscle to undergo endurance
remodeling with exercise. Thus, using these innovative genetic
models of low and high adaptive response, we hypothesized that
JNK activation during exercise is a negative regulator of endur-
ance adaptations in muscle.
The present investigation aimed to directly test the hypothesis
that JNK is a critical mediator of muscle remodeling. We
employed a multi-disciplinary approach to determine the effect of
JNK hyper-activation and loss of function on muscle phenotype
and remodeling, including tissue culture systems, animal models,
and human subjects. This work identifies JNK as a molecular
switch that, when active, stimulates muscle fibers to grow, leading
to increased muscle mass. Conversely, when JNK is inhibited, an
alternative adaptive program is induced, leading to endurance
adaptations and enhanced aerobic capacity. We find that JNK
exerts its effects on muscle phenotype via phosphorylation of the
transcription factor, SMAD2, at specific linker-region residues.
JNK-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation results in negative reg-
ulation of the myostatin/TGFβ pathway, thus allowing for muscle
growth. In addition, we demonstrate that this novel signaling axis
can be modulated by specific types of exercise in human skeletal
muscle, therefore identifying JNK/SMAD signaling as a target to
induce muscle remodeling. These data enhance our under-
standing of the fundamental mechanisms that mediate muscle
reprogramming and remodeling in vivo.
Results
Loss-of-JNK enhances endurance remodeling in muscle. Our
previous work using models of high and low adaptive response to
endurance exercise demonstrated that skeletal muscle JNK acti-
vation during exercise was negatively correlated to the adaptive
response to endurance exercise16. Based on those data16, we
hypothesized that inhibition of JNK during exercise would
enhance adaptive remodeling in response to endurance exercise
in skeletal muscle. To test this hypothesis, an endurance exercise
training study was performed in muscle-specific JNK1/2 knock-
out (mJNKKO; Mapk8LoxP/LoxP Mapk9LoxP/LoxP MCK-Cre−/+)
mice and wild-type (WT; MCK-Cre−/+) controls. Mice were
placed in cages with access to a running wheel, and running
activity was electronically monitored for 10 week (Exercise-
trained). A separate group of mice was kept in static cages for the
experimental period (Sedentary). Total running distance was
similar over the training duration in WT and mJNKKO mice
(Supplementary Figure 1). Following the 10-week training per-
iod, endurance capacity was measured using a graded treadmill
running test in all experimental groups as a physiological marker
of
endurance
adaptation.
Endurance
capacity
in
trained
mJNKKO was 45% higher compared to wild-type controls
(Fig. 1a). Endurance capacity was similar in untrained WT and
mJNKKO animals, demonstrating that increased endurance
capacity in mJNKKO was due to enhanced adaptation to train-
ing, rather than intrinsic differences between genotypes (Fig. 1a).
High endurance capacity, also known as cardiorespiratory fitness,
is the gold-standard measure for the adaptive response to
endurance training and has emerged as one of the best clinical
markers for metabolic health and longevity in humans. These
data demonstrate that skeletal muscle JNK activation during
exercise is a negative regulator of improvements to endurance
capacity.
Consistent with a phenotype of high-endurance capacity,
mJNKKO had a higher capillary density (Fig. 1b, c) and a greater
proportion of oxidative (type I) fibers in the red gastrocnemius
muscle (Fig. 1d, e). In addition, exercise training caused a

 significant decrease in myofiber cross-sectional area in mJNKKO
mice, but not in WT controls (Fig. 1f). Smaller myofiber cross-
sectional area contributes to enhanced endurance capacity by
allowing for better diffusion of oxygen and nutrients to working
muscle18. In humans, small fiber cross-sectional area, higher
capillary density, and increased oxidative myosin heavy chain
expression characterize the muscle of elite endurance athletes18.
Therefore, mJNKKO mice have a muscle phenotype that mimics
that of endurance trained athletes. These experiments demon-
strate that JNK is a negative regulator of endurance remodeling in
muscle, and identify inhibition of JNK as a strategy to improve
endurance adaptations.
JNK is necessary for muscle hypertrophy. It has been proposed
that the signaling mechanisms regulating the remodeling pro-
grams for endurance or hypertrophic adaptations in muscle are
antagonistic9,10. Indeed, concurrent training regimens employing
both endurance and resistance exercise modalities can blunt
muscle adaptation in humans11. Since JNK was a negative reg-
ulator of endurance training adaptations (Fig. 1), we hypothesized
that JNK may be a positive regulator of hypertrophic adaptations
in muscle. Functional overload (i.e., synergist ablation) is a sur-
gical procedure that consistently induces muscle hypertrophy in
mice, mimicking gains in muscle mass due to resistance training
in humans. Functional overload of the plantaris muscle was

 induced by partial removal of the gastrocnemius muscle in
mJNKKO mice and WT controls to determine the effect of JNK
knockout on muscle hypertrophy. Overload surgery was per-
formed on one leg from each animal, and the contralateral leg
served as a control. Two weeks of overload increased plantaris
muscle weight by 2.5-fold in WT mice (Fig. 2a). However, the
overload-induced increase in muscle weight was significantly
blunted in mJNKKO mice (Fig. 2a). In addition, muscle fiber
cross-sectional area was increased by 50% in WT animals, but
JNK knockout prevented overload-induced increases in muscle
cross-sectional area (Fig. 2b, c). These data demonstrate that JNK
is necessary for increased muscle mass and myofiber hypertrophy
in response to increased load, supporting the hypothesis that JNK
is a positive regulator of hypertrophic adaptation in muscle.
Muscle JNK activation coincides with SMAD2 phosphoryla-
tion. Our data demonstrate that JNK acts as a positive regulator of
hypertrophic adaptations and a negative regulator of endurance
adaptations in muscle (Figs. 1 and 2). We next aimed to determine
the mechanism by which JNK mediates muscle adaptive remo-
deling. Our previous work identified a novel exercise-activated
phosphorylation site on the transcription factor, SMAD2, at a
predicted JNK consensus sequence in its linker region (Ser245/
250/255)16.
As
SMAD2
is
a

regulator
of
muscle
remodeling19,20, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of SMAD2
may be a mechanism for JNK-mediated muscle remodeling with
exercise. To determine whether JNK activation tracks with
SMAD2-linker (SMAD2-L) phosphorylation with exercise, we
performed treadmill running and in situ contraction experiments
in ICR (outbred) mice. SMAD2-L phosphorylation tracked closely
with activation of JNK with both treadmill running and in situ
contraction (Fig. 3a, b). However, treadmill running activated
JNK/SMAD2-L phosphorylation to a relatively small extent
(Fig. 3a) compared to in situ contraction, which more consistently
and robustly induced JNK/SMAD2-L phosphorylation (Fig. 3b).
While treadmill running induces metabolic stress in muscle via the
utilization of energy substrates and ATP, in situ contraction elicits
strong, eccentric contractions that induce both metabolic and
mechanical stress. To determine whether mechanical stress alone
is able to activate JNK/SMAD2-L signaling, we performed muscle
stretch experiments. Passive stretch activated JNK and SMAD2-L
robustly, while the metabolic stress indicator, AMPK, was mini-
mally activated (Fig. 3c). Thus, JNK/SMAD phosphorylation is
preferentially activated by contractions that elicit mechanical
stress, rather than those producing metabolic stress (i.e., endur-
ance exercise). Although other mitogen-activated protein kinases,
p38 and ERK, were activated by muscle contraction and stretch;
only JNK was activated in a similar pattern to pSMAD2-L.
Therefore, our results identify JNK as a putative upstream kinase
for SMAD2-L phosphorylation in muscle.
JNK phosphorylates the SMAD2-linker region in muscle.

 contraction were analyzed to directly test the hypothesis that JNK
is the upstream kinase for SMAD2-linker phosphorylation with
exercise. In line with that hypothesis, SMAD2-L phosphorylation
with muscle contraction was severely blunted in muscle-specific
JNK1/2 knockout mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 4a–c).
Next, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with the JNK activator
Anisomycin (5 μM), to determine whether JNK activation is
sufficient to induce SMAD2-L phosphorylation in muscle. Thirty
minutes of Anisomycin treatment resulted in robust increases in
JNK activation and SMAD2-linker phosphorylation (Fig. 4d).
Skeletal muscle expresses two independent JNK isoforms, JNK1
and JNK2. Therefore, fusion plasmids for active JNK1 or JNK2
were expressed in C2C12 to determine whether JNK-associated
SMAD2-L phosphorylation is isoform specific. Active JNK1 and
JNK2 isoforms independently induced SMAD2-L phosphoryla-
tion in cultured muscle (Fig. 4e). SMAD2-linker phosphorylation
was also increased following in vitro incubation of recombinant
SMAD2 protein with purified immunoprecipitates of either active
JNK1 or JNK2 (Fig. 4f). In contrast, we were unable to detect
JNK-mediated SMAD3 phosphorylation in its linker region at the
Ser208 site using a commercially available antibody. In vitro
phosphorylation indicates that JNK can directly interact with
SMAD2 to phosphorylate its linker region in the absence of other
cellular proteins. Taken together, these experiments (Fig. 4)
demonstrate that JNK activation is both necessary and sufficient
for SMAD2-L phosphorylation in muscle. Furthermore, we
identify JNK as the primary upstream kinase for SMAD2-linker
phosphorylation during exercise.
JNK inhibits SMAD activity. A JNK/SMAD signaling axis
represents a novel exercise-activated pathway in skeletal muscle;
introducing the possibility that JNK mediates hypertrophic vs.
endurance remodeling via SMAD2 regulation. SMAD2 is a
mediator of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family of
ligands, which are critical regulators of remodeling in many tis-
sues21. One of the most important TGFβ ligands for skeletal
muscle remodeling is myostatin- a master regulator of muscle
mass and metabolism in humans and animals that signals via

tional activity in response to myostatin. To measure SMAD
transcriptional activation, HEK293 cells were transfected with a

 phosphorylation in cells expressing active JNK (Fig. 5b). Thus,
our data demonstrate that JNK activation initiates non-canonical
phosphorylation of SMAD2 in its linker region, which has an
inhibitory effect on SMAD2 activity.
JNK inhibits myostatin-induced SMAD nuclear translocation.
In canonical SMAD signaling, TGFβ ligands (e.g., myostatin)
bind to cell surface receptors, which initiate receptor-mediated
phosphorylation of SMAD2 on its C-terminus (pSMAD2-C),

altering SMAD2 protein levels (Fig. 5b). Therefore, impaired
receptor-mediated phosphorylation may partly explain reduced
SMAD transcriptional activity in the presence of active JNK. In
some cellular contexts, linker-region phosphorylation of SMADs
may prevent their translocation to the nucleus, and therefore
transcriptional activity, even in the presence of receptor-mediated
C-terminus phosphorylation23. Cytosolic and nuclear levels of
SMAD2 were measured in C2C12 myoblasts to determine

 whether JNK-mediated SMAD linker phosphorylation prevents
nuclear translocation in response to myostatin. Treatment with
20 nM myostatin for 30 min induced a threefold higher accu-
mulation of pSMAD2-C and total SMAD2 in the nucleus of
myoblasts (Fig. 5c–e). However, in cells overexpressing active
JNK, the accumulation of SMAD2 in the nucleus was significantly
blunted. Using an antibody that detects both SMAD2 and
SMAD3 isoforms, we also demonstrate that SMAD3 accumula-
tion in the nucleus was impaired in cells expressing active JNK.
This indicates that reduced SMAD transcriptional activity with
JNK overexpression (Fig. 5a), is likely due to effects on both the
SMAD2 and SMAD3 isoforms. The effects of JNK activity on
SMAD3 translocation may be due to direct phosphorylation at an
unknown site, or through its complex formation with SMAD225.
Consistent with a role for SMAD linker phosphorylation in
preventing nuclear translocation, the immunoblotting signal for
pSMAD2-L was much higher in the cytosolic fraction of myo-
cytes, while pSMAD2-C was enriched in the nuclear fraction
(Fig. 5c). Thus, our results demonstrate that JNK-mediated
phosphorylation of SMAD2 in its linker region inhibits tran-
scriptional activity in response to myostatin by impairing both C-
terminus phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2/3
(Fig. 5).
JNK suppresses myostatin activity in vivo. Myostatin acts to
suppress muscle growth, while myostatin inhibition via genetic or
pharmacological means leads to muscle fiber hypertrophy in
humans and animals26. Consistent with a role for JNK in
myostatin inhibition, mJNKKO mice display lower body weight
and lean mass compared to WT (Fig. 6a, b). Expression of
myostatin mRNA in skeletal muscle was similar between WT and
mJNKKO mice (Fig. 6c). However, expression of the myostatin
target genes, MuRF1 and MAFBX, were elevated in mJNKKO
mice (Fig. 6c). Reduced lean mass and increased myostatin target
gene expression in mJNKKO mice are consistent with evidence
demonstrating JNK is a negative regulator of myostatin activity
(Fig. 5).
Resistance exercise activates JNK/SMAD signaling in humans.
Our data identify JNK activation as an inhibitor of TGFβ/
myostatin signaling and a key mediator of muscle hypertrophy.
To determine whether a JNK/SMAD2 signaling axis is activated
in response to endurance or hypertrophic stimuli in humans,
biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscles of healthy
young men at multiple time points before and after completion of
a standard bout of acute endurance (cycling) or resistance
(weighted leg extension) exercise. Resistance exercise robustly
increased SMAD2-L phosphorylation ~4-fold in human skeletal
muscle (Fig. 7a, b), with peak activation occurring immediately
post-exercise. A secondary peak in SMAD2-L phosphorylation
occurred 60 min post-exercise (Fig. 7b). JNK activation followed a
very similar pattern to SMAD2-L phosphorylation with exercise
(Fig. 7c). In contrast to resistance exercise, SMAD2-L and JNK
were phosphorylated to a much smaller degree (<2-fold; not
statistically significant) in response to endurance exercise in
healthy humans (Fig. 7a–c). These data demonstrate that skeletal
muscle JNK/SMAD2L signaling is upregulated by exercise in
humans, and activation of this novel signaling axis is more
consistent and robust following resistance exercise. Resistance
exercise is the most effective modality for inducing muscle
hypertrophy in humans. Thus, selective activation of JNK/SMAD

 demonstrating JNK is necessary for overload-induced muscle
hypertrophy in mice (Fig. 2).
Although mean JNK/SMAD signaling was not significantly
activated by endurance exercise in humans, the response
was varied among subjects, with some individuals displaying
no activation and others having >2-fold increases in phosphor-
ylation
(Fig.
7d).
Heterogeneous
activation
of
SMAD2-L
phosphorylation with endurance exercise also occurs in animal
models, and high-JNK/SMAD2-L activation predicts a poor
adaptation to endurance training16. When data from all human
muscle biopsies were pooled, patterns of SMAD2L phosphoryla-
tion mirrored JNK activation with exercise in humans, and linear
regression analysis showed a significant correlation between
pSMAD2-L and pJNK (Fig. 7e). Thus, we identify JNK-induced
phosphorylation of SMAD2 in its linker region as a novel
signaling axis in human skeletal muscle that is primarily activated
by hypertrophic stimuli, such as resistance exercise. When
considered collectively, our data support the hypothesis that
activation of a JNK/SMAD2 signaling axis with resistance exercise
induces muscle hypertrophy via TGFβ/myostatin inhibition;
while suppression of JNK/SMAD signaling enhances endurance
adaptations (Fig. 8).
Discussion
Adaptive remodeling in skeletal muscle can produce clinically
important changes in muscle morphology toward endurance or
hypertrophic phenotypes. Elucidating the molecular signals that
allow for increases in muscle fiber size or endurance has impli-
cations for the treatment of chronic diseases ranging from sar-
copenia to diabetes. However, the precise mechanisms that
determine these seemingly contrasting muscle adaptations are not
fully understood. We have identified a novel role for the mitogen-
activated protein kinase, JNK, as a key regulator of muscle
adaptive remodeling in animals and humans. Furthermore, we
provide mechanistic evidence that JNK modulates muscle phe-
notype via phosphorylation of SMAD2 and negative regulation of
TGFβ/myostatin activity. This discovery represents a significant

 advance in our understanding of the complex phenomenon of
skeletal muscle remodeling.
To date, JNK has been known as an important regulator of
cellular stress and inflammatory responses27. We now identify
dual roles for JNK as a positive regulator of muscle hypertrophy
and a negative regulator of endurance adaptation in muscle. Our
observation that hypertrophy and endurance adaptations are
regulated in opposing directions by JNK is in line with clinical
observations that muscle adaptation is blunted when endurance
and resistance training are performed concurrently (i.e., within
the same exercise session)11. While there are some hypotheses
regarding causes underlying interference between endurance and
resistance adaptations9,10, the precise molecular mechanisms are
incompletely understood. Our data imply that JNK activation
may be one mechanism for interference with concurrent training.
When JNK was inappropriately activated with endurance exercise
in models of low response to aerobic capacity, endurance adap-
tations were impaired16. Conversely, when JNK activation was
prevented in mJNKKO mice, the mice had a potentiated response
to endurance training, but muscle hypertrophy with overload was
ablated (Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, JNK acts as a molecular switch to
allow either endurance adaptations when inactive, or growth/
hypertrophy adaptations when active. This premise may partly
explain the mutual exclusivity of obtaining optimal endurance
and strength adaptations.
While JNK is known to have several molecular targets, we
identify SMAD2 as a novel exercise-activated JNK substrate. The
discovery that JNK inhibits SMAD2 in muscle has important
clinical implications, as SMAD2 is a downstream effector of
myostatin- a TGFβ superfamily ligand26. Our data clearly show
that JNK activation through multiple means, including pharma-
cological treatment, genetic manipulation, or muscle contraction
leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor SMAD2 at
specific linker region residues. In turn, we provide evidence that
JNK-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation has an inhibitory effect
on SMAD2 transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation. We
also observed an inhibition of SMAD3 translocation to the
nucleus in myocytes with JNK activation. The precise mechan-
isms for the inhibitory effect of JNK on SMAD3 have yet to be
elucidated. The inhibitory effect of JNK on SMAD3 may be due to
phosphorylation of SMAD3 by JNK on a yet undetermined
residue(s), or and indirect effect via complex formation with
SMAD2. However, it has previously been demonstrated that both
SMAD2 and SMAD3 are necessary for the effects of TGFβ/
myostatin on muscle mass19,20,28. Myostatin acts as a molecular
brake that prevents muscle hypertrophy, while its inhibition
allows for muscle growth26,29. Loss-of-function mutations in the
myostatin gene, or inhibition of myostatin function via phar-
macological antagonism, results in clinically significant increases
in muscle mass in humans and animals30,31. Therefore, myostatin
receptor antagonism is being explored as a treatment for muscle
wasting diseases, such as cachexia and sarcopenia. Our work
identifying JNK as a novel myostatin inhibitor provides a
mechanism for our observation that mJNKKO mice have severely

Fig. 8 Hypothesized mechanisms by which JNK activation with exercise leads to muscle hypertrophy. Canonical myostatin signaling (depicted with black
arrows) results in reduced myofiber size via receptor-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2 on its C-terminus (Ser465/467). Myostatin-mediated SMAD2
phosphorylation induces dimerization with co-SMAD4 and translocation of the SMAD complex to the nucleus where DNA binding and transcription are
initiated. Our data demonstrate that resistance exercise induces JNK activation and phosphorylation of SMAD2 in its linker region via a non-canonical
pathway (depicted with red arrows). Phosphorylation of SMAD2 at specific linker region resides (Ser245/250/255) has an inhibitory effect on myostatin
activity by preventing the nuclear translocation of SMAD2. Inhibition of myostatin via this novel JNK/SMAD pathway allows for exercise-induced muscle
hypertrophy

 impaired overload-induced hypertrophy (Fig. 2). Furthermore,
we identify JNK activation as an alternative strategy for clinical
myostatin inhibition.
In addition to playing a negative role in regulating muscle
mass, studies in animal models suggest that myostatin may act as
a positive regulator of endurance capacity32. In line with that
assertion, myostatin inhibition causes muscle adaptations that
would contribute to impaired endurance capacity, such as a shift
toward a less oxidative muscle phenotype and lower capillary
density32,33. These data suggest that myostatin may be necessary
to maintain endurance adaptations in muscle, while myostatin
inactivation can switch muscle toward the contrasting adaptive
program of muscle growth. In support of a positive role for
myostatin in endurance
adaptations, we demonstrate
that
knockout of JNK in skeletal muscle, which would act to enhance
myostatin activity, can increase endurance capacity and promote
an endurance phenotype (i.e., oxidative fiber type and increased
capillary density) in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, loss-of-muscle
JNK activation with endurance exercise training in muscle JNK
knockout mice led to a decrease in muscle fiber cross-sectional
area, consistent with increased myostatin activity. Our work
shows a novel functional intersection between two clinically
important signaling networks: MAPK/JNK and TGFβ/myostatin.
Exercise induces thousands of molecular signals that contribute
to its unparalleled ability to effectively treat and prevent a mul-
titude
of
chronic
diseases4.
Accordingly,
exercise-activated
molecular targets such as AMPK and PGC1α have been exten-
sively studied for their therapeutic potential as exercise mimet-
ics34. While it has long been known that exercise can activate JNK
in skeletal muscle35,36, the role of JNK activation during exercise
and its contribution to training-induced adaptations in muscle
was not previously understood. We now demonstrate in humans,
that a single bout of exercise can activate JNK leading to myos-
tatin inhibition via JNK-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2. In
healthy humans, this novel JNK/SMAD2 signaling axis is pri-
marily activated by resistance exercise, but not significantly
activated by endurance (cycling) exercise (Fig. 7). Thus, exercise
modalities that result in low levels of JNK activation (e.g., cycling;
Fig. 7) would allow for myostatin to remain active and endurance
adaptations to take place. Conversely, exercise that strongly
activates JNK (e.g., weight lifting; Fig. 7) will result in inhibition
of myostatin and a shift toward a hypertrophic adaptive program.
Based on our data, we hypothesize that JNK/SMAD2 signaling
acts as a mechanical sensor during exercise that determines
whether the exercise modality necessitates hypertrophy-inducing
adaptations, and therefore myostatin inhibition. In line with this
hypothesis, mechanical stress (i.e., muscle stretch) was found to
be a more potent activator of JNK than metabolic stress (i.e.,
endurance exercise) [Fig. 3]; and JNK has been demonstrated to
have mechano-sensing properties in muscle and other tissues37,38.
Although JNK/SMAD signaling is primarily activated by
resistance exercise, a subset of individuals displays activation of
JNK/SMAD signaling with endurance exercise (Figs. 3 & 7). In
fact, we first discovered a potential JNK/SMAD signaling axis in
samples taken following acute treadmill running exercise in our
previous investigation of animal models of low and high adaptive
response to endurance training16. Rat models selectively bred for
an impaired adaptive response to endurance exercise had high
activation of JNK/SMAD signaling with treadmill running com-
pared to those selectively bred for high adaptive response to
endurance exercise16. JNK/SMAD activation during acute exer-
cise in low responders was associated with a failure to improve
endurance exercise capacity with training, and blunted endurance
adaptations in muscle with exercise. Thus, we propose that
individuals with high JNK/SMAD activation in response to
endurance exercise may fail to undergo endurance adaptations
due to inappropriate activation of a resistance exercise pathway.
Indeed, we demonstrate that inhibition of JNK activation with
endurance exercise in muscle JNK knockout mice greatly
enhances endurance adaptations with training (Fig. 1).
The cause for increased JNK/SMAD signaling in some indi-
viduals during endurance exercise is unknown. However, het-
erogeneity
in
adaptation
to
endurance
training
and
the
phenomenon of “non-responders” to endurance exercise has been
well-documented13,15. Our data suggest inappropriate JNK/
SMAD activation as a putative mechanism for the failure to adapt
to endurance training in a subgroup of the population. Low
endurance exercise capacity in humans is associated with greatly
increased risk for metabolic disease and mortality39,40. There is
also extensive work linking JNK hyper-activation with chronic
metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, and dia-
betes, suggesting JNK plays a negative role in metabolic
health41,42. In rodent models of low adaptive response to
endurance exercise, activation of JNK signaling with endurance
exercise was associated with increased risk factors for chronic
metabolic disease, including glucose intolerance and increased
adiposity16. Adaptation of muscle away from an oxidative/
endurance phenotype in favor of a glycolytic/hypertrophic phe-
notype has been associated with increased risk for chronic
metabolic disease in humans and animals43,44. Our data identify
JNK hyper-activation as a potential mechanism for this shift in
muscle phenotype associated with metabolic disease. Future stu-
dies should investigate whether causative links exist between
metabolic health and JNK/SMAD signaling with endurance
exercise, and whether inhibition of this pathway may act as a
treatment for metabolic disease.
In summary, our data identify JNK/SMAD signaling as a
molecular switch in skeletal muscle that induces muscle growth
when active, and shifts muscle toward an endurance phenotype
when inactive. Furthermore, we demonstrate regulation of TGFβ/
myostatin signaling and activity as a mechanism for JNK-
mediated effects on muscle phenotype, and validate the presence
of this novel signaling axis in human skeletal muscle. This work
elucidates the fundamental mechanisms that regulate the clini-
cally important phenomenon of muscle remodeling and adapta-
tion, and identifies JNK/SMAD signaling as a novel clinical target.
As age and chronic disease can impair muscular adaptations to
exercise, knowledge of the pathways that regulate adaptive
reprogramming in muscle will be invaluable for designing stra-
tegies to improve muscle function in specific clinical populations.
Methods

generated on the C57BL/6J background using a Cre-Lox system under control of the
muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter. Mapk8LoxP/LoxP mice45 and Mapk9LoxP/LoxP

 For treadmill running and in situ contraction experiments (Fig. 3), ICR mice
were purchase from Charles River Laboratories. All mice were housed in a specific-
pathogen-free facility, fed ad libitum with Purina Mouse Diet 9F 5020*
(composition by Kcal%: 23.2% protein, 21.6% fat, 55.2% carbohydrate), and were
maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Body composition was measured in
anesthetized mice using a Lunar PIXImus2 mouse densitometer. Male mice were
used for all experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center.
Endurance exercise training. To determine the effect of muscle JNK on endur-
ance training adaptations, WT and mJNKKO mice were housed individually in
wheel-running cages and voluntary wheel-running distance was recorded daily for
10 weeks. Sedentary control mice were housed individually in static cages without
running wheels. Endurance exercise capacity was measured in sedentary and
exercise-trained mice during week 8 of the exercise training protocol using an
incremental treadmill running test to exhaustion at a 15% grade. Endurance
exercise capacity was expressed as total distance run during the exercise capacity
test.
Functional overload experiments. As a model of resistance training, WT and
mJNKKO mice (N = 7 per group) underwent unilateral ablation of the gastro-
cnemius muscle to induce functional overload and hypertrophy of the synergist
plantaris muscle. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and the fur
from the distal hindlimb was removed. A 1 cm incision was made in the skin to
isolate the gastrocnemius muscle tendon and the distal 1/3 of the gastrocnemius
muscle was removed from one leg, leaving the plantaris and soleus muscles intact.
The incision was closed with sutures and surgical glue and the mice were allowed to
recover. The gastrocnemius muscle from the contralateral leg remained intact and
acted as a control. Fourteen days following overload surgery, mice were killed and
the plantaris muscles from the control and overloaded legs were removed, weighed,
and frozen for histological analysis.
Human subjects. Sixteen, healthy young men (age 29.0 ± 2.3 yr) participated in
this study and were randomly allocated to either 1) endurance exercise (N = 8) or
2) resistance exercise (N = 8) experimental groups. Detailed subject characteristics
were previously published48. All subjects were recreationally active in various
sports involving both endurance- and resistance-type exercise. Subjects assigned to
endurance exercise undertook a preliminary incremental cycling test to volitional
fatigue49 to determine peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak, mean ± SD 54.3 ± 3.6 ml/kg/
min). Resistance Exercise subjects performed a series of single-leg extension
repetitions separated by 3 min recovery to establish individual one repetition
maximum (1RM, mean ± SD 120 ± 29 kg). On a subsequent study visit, subjects
were asked to abstain from vigorous physical activity for at least 48 h, and arrived
at the laboratory following an overnight fast. Endurance Exercise subjects then
underwent a standardized bout of exercise, consisting of 60 min cycling at ~70% of
their previously determined VO2 peak. Resistance Exercise subjects performed leg
extension exercise for 8 sets of 5 repetitions at 80% of their individual 1RM, with
each set separated by 3 min recovery. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken from
separate incisions (distal to proximal) of the vastus lateralis muscle from the same
leg before the exercise bout (Rest), immediately post exercise (0 min), and 15, 30,
and 60 min post exercise from each subject to determine exercise activation of JNK/
SMAD signaling. Muscle samples were blotted and immediately frozen in liquid N2
before being homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing protease and phos-
phatase inhibitors48. Data are shown from N = 8 subjects for endurance exercise
and N = 7 subjects for resistance exercise due to insufficient sample available from
one subject. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of
the RMIT University (Melbourne, Australia) and the Massey University (Palmer-
ston North, New Zealand). Written informed consent was obtained from each
participant.
Western blotting. Skeletal muscles from mice were rapidly dissected, frozen in
liquid N2 and homogenized using a TissueLyser (Qiagen) in a modified RIPA
buffer containing: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1%
(v/v) Triton-X, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM DTT, and protease/
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). The protein content of muscle and tissue
lysates were analyzed using a Bradford Assay (Biorad), and samples containing
equal amounts of protein were heated to 95 °C for 5 min in laemmli buffer. Samples
were run on Criterion TGX 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to
Nitrocellulose membranes. Stain-free technology (Bio-Rad) was used to determine
equal loading. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk or bovine serum
albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature and exposed to primary antibodies
overnight at 4 C, followed by incubation with appropriate HRP-conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies and visualization with ECL on film or a ChemiDoc Touch
imaging system (Bio-Rad). The following antibodies were used for the detection of
phosphorylated and total protein levels: pSMAD2-C (CST 8828), pSMAD2-L (CST
3104), pSMAD3-L (PA5-38521), pERK (CST 4370), SMAD 2 (CST 5339), SMAD
2/3 (CST 8685), pJNK (Promega V7931 or CST4668), JNK Total (CST 9252), α-
Tubulin (CST 3873), GAPDH (CST5174), pAkt (CST 9271), pP38 (CST 4511),
pAMPK (CST 2531). All primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution in TBST,
with the exception of pSMAD2-L, which was diluted at 1:500. Uncropped images
of the most important blots are included in Supplementary Figure 2.
Real time PCR. A portion of the Tibialis Anterior muscle was collected from
muscle-specific JNK knockout mice and controls and stored for 24 h in RNALater
(Qiagen) at 4 °C. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent and purified using
Direct-zol columns (Zymo). RNA samples underwent reverse transcription and
cDNA levels were measured using target-specific primers. Primer sequences used
are outlined in Table 1.
In situ contraction and acute treadmill running. In situ muscle contraction was
performed in ICR mice (Fig. 3) or mJNKKO and control mice (Fig. 4). For these
experiments, the sciatic nerve was isolated from one leg and stimulated for 15 min
(1 train s−1, 500 ms train duration), with the contralateral leg acting as a basal
control. Following completion of the contraction protocol, the tibialis anterior
muscles from both legs were rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid N2, and sub-
sequently processed for Western Blotting. For acute treadmill running experiments,
mice were placed on a motorized treadmill at a speed of 15 m/min (15% grade) for
15, 30, or 60 min. Immediately following exercise, mice were killed by cervical
dislocation and the tibialis anterior muscles were rapidly dissected and frozen in
liquid N2. Mice that did not undergo treadmill running served as controls.
Muscle stretch. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, the soleus muscles from
both hindlimbs were rapidly removed, and the tendon ends were tied with sutures.
Muscles were then mounted to a force transducer at resting tension and pre-
incubated in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate Buffer with 2 mM pyruvate for
30 min. Following the pre-incubation period, one muscle from each mouse was
stretched at 0.12 N for 10 min, while the contralateral muscle remained at resting
tension and acted as a control. Following the stretch experiment, muscles were
immediately frozen in liquid N2, and stored and −80 °C until processing for
western blotting.
Tissue culture. C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC; passage 5–9) or HEK293 cells were used
for all experiments and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1%
Penicillin/Streptomycin. C2C12 myoblasts underwent serum starvation for 2 h,
followed by treatment with 5 μM anisomycin for 30 min to determine the effect of
JNK activation on SMAD2-linker phosphorylation. To determine whether JNK-
mediated SMAD linker phosphorylation is isoform-specific, cells were transfected
with plasmids encoding the JNK activating kinase MKK7 fused to either JNK1 or
JNK2 isoforms (Addgene plasmids #19726 for JNK1 and #19272 for JNK2;50). This
fusion plasmid strategy leads to expression of a constitutively active form of JNK50,
referred to as active JNK1 (aJNK1) and active JNK2 (aJNK2). Control cells were
transfected with pCDNA3 empty vector. All myoblast transfections were per-
formed using Viromer Red Transfection Reagent (Lipocalyx). For measurement of
SMAD transcriptional activity HEK293 cells (ATCC; passage 5–10) were reverse-

 transfected with a SMAD-binding element luciferase reporter plasmid (SBE4-Luc;
Addgene plasmid #16495 from Bert Vogelstein51) in the presence or absence of
active JNK1. HEK293 transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 3000
transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher). Luciferase activity was measured using a
Pierce Firefly Luciferase Glow Assay kit. Isolation of nuclear SMAD2 was per-
formed using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic extraction reagents. In experi-
ments involving myostatin treatment, recombinant myostatin (R&D Systems,
Cat#788-G8) was added to cell culture medium at a final concentration of 20 nM.
Data are representative of three independent experiments.
In vitro JNK immunoprecipitation and activity assay. Fusion plasmids encoding
for active, FLAG-tagged, JNK1 and JNK2 were expressed in C2C12 myoblasts for
24 h as described in Tissue Culture. Cells expressing an empty plasmid vector were
used as a control. Protein was extracted in a Triton-X lysis buffer (pH 7.5) con-
taining protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were incubated overnight at
4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) to immunoprecipitate active JNK
proteins. Immunoprecipitates were washed thoroughly to remove unbound pro-
teins, and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in a kinase activity buffer containing ATP, and
either recombinant human SMAD2 or SMAD3 substrates (Abcam). The reaction
was stopped by adding 4X Laemmli buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The
degree of SMAD phosphorylation was determined in the supernatants by western
blotting, as described above.
Muscle histology. Skeletal muscles from mJNKKO mice and controls were frozen
in isopentane cooled with liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until sectioning. A total
of 6 µm sections were cut using a cryostat microtome (Leica CM1850; Leica
Microsystems) and affixed to slides. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a
humidified chamber with antibodies against myosin heavy chain type I (A4.951,
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Subsequently, sec-
tions were incubated with appropriate conjugated secondary antibodies for one
hour at 37 °C (Alexa Fluor-568, Molecular Probes, Life Technologies). Fluorescent-
conjugated (AlexaFluor488) Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) was used to stain the
extracellular matrix for the calculation of fiber cross-sectional area using Image J
software.
Statistical analysis. Analysis of genotype/exercise interactions in animals (Figs. 1
and 2), and JNK/myostatin interactions in cell culture experiments (Fig. 5) were
performed using a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s post hoc testing. Analysis of
differences in gene expression between wild-type and mJNKKO mice was per-
formed using an unpaired t-test (Fig. 4). Human exercise time-course samples were
analyzed using a Two-Way ANOVA (Exercise vs. Time) followed by Tukey’s
multiple comparison test. In all analyses, significance was accepted with P < 0.05.
