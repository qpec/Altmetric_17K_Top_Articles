Abstract Long-lived species such as elephants, whales and
primates exhibit extended post-fertile survival compared to
species with shorter lifespans but data on age-related fecundi-
ty and survival are limited to few species or populations. We
assess relationships between longevity, reproductive onset,
reproductive rate and age for 834 longitudinally monitored
wild female African elephants in Amboseli, Kenya. The mean
known age at first reproduction was 13.8 years; only 5 %
commenced reproduction by 10 years. Early reproducers
(<12.5 years) had higher age-specific fertility rates than did
females who commenced reproduction late (15+ years) with
no differences in survival between these groups. Age-specific
reproductive rates of females dying before 40 years were re-
duced by comparison to same-aged survivors, illustrating a
mortality filter and reproductive advantages of a long life.
Overall, 95 % of fertility was completed before 50, and
95 % of mortality experienced by age 65, with a mean life
expectancy of 41 years for females who survived to the min-
imum age at first birth (9 years). Elephant females have a
relatively long period (c. 16 years) of viability after 95 %
completed fertility, although reproduction does not entirely
cease until they are over 65. We found no evidence of in-
creased investment among females aged over 40 in terms of
delay to next birth or calf mortality. The presence of a mother
reproducing simultaneously with her daughter was associated
with higher rates of daughter reproduction suggesting advan-
tages from maternal (and grandmaternal) co-residence during
reproduction.

Significance
Elephants exhibit extended post-fertile survival, although how
fecundity changes over the 60+ years of the lifespan is known
for only a few populations. We present data for 834 wild
female African elephants which have been monitored for over
40 years. We test whether reproductive onset affects reproduc-
tive output and longevity, and assess whether older females
(aged >40 years) follow strategies for producing and rearing
calves that are specific to later life. We explore the effects of
mothers’ later-life reproduction while living alongside daugh-
ters in a family. The patterns in this elephant population—a
long life associated with greater success in reproduction and
the importance of grandmothers to daughters—are discussed
relative to other species that exhibit post-fertile survival. We
evaluate potential selection pressures that may have resulted
in long reproductive careers for female elephants.
Introduction
Long-lived species tend to show trends in ageing and fertility
that are distinct from those of rapidly reproducing, short-lived
species (Reed et al. 2008; Hayward et al. 2014), but species at
both ends of the life history continuum can exhibit prolonged
post-reproductive lifespans with potential advantages for both
the survivors and their offspring (Croft et al. 2015). The

 evolution of post-reproductive longevity thus remains a ques-
tion of major theoretical interest. Recent analyses of age-
specific rates of reproduction among wild primates (Alberts
et al. 2013) found that the modal age of reproductive cessation
coincided with modal ages of mortality and Asian elephants
(Elephas maximus) exhibit a similar effect (Lahdenperä et al.
2014). By contrast and like humans, among killer whales
(Orcinus orca) reproductive senescence occurs over 20 years
before modal mortality (Foote 2008; Brent et al. 2015).
Elephants, humans and whales share a lifespan of 70–100+
years, making them rare among mammals. Maximum lifespan
has been estimated at 74 years from tooth wear (Lee et al.
2012) in wild female African elephants (Loxodonta africana)
and ~80 years for Asian elephants (Lahdenperä et al. 2014).
Age-specific mortality and life expectancy have been present-
ed for wild African elephants (Moss 2001; Gough and Kerley
2006; Foley and Faust 2010) and for working Asian elephants
(Robinson et al. 2012; Hayward et al. 2014; Lahdenperä et al.
2014). Robinson et al. (2012) also examined the relationships
between survival and reproductive output for their captive
population and found positive covariance early in life where
rapid reproduction was associated with higher survival, but
negative trade-offs at older ages where reproduction increased
mortality risks. In a global analysis of modern humans, Thom-
as et al. (2000) found that women who invested heavily in
reproduction at younger ages had reduced longevity. Here,
we explore whether similar trade-offs between reproductive
rate and survival exist among wild female African elephants.
Given individual variation in susceptibility to mortality,
mortality itself can alter the composition and vulnerability of
older age classes (e.g. Vaupel and Yashin 1985). As Partridge
(2001) and Carey and Judge (2001) discuss, survivors into old
age may represent a specific class of organisms that remain
after selective disappearance, rather than a random selection
of heterogeneous individuals. However, if all young animals
survive well, then the older cohorts will consist of more het-
erogeneous, less intensely selected individuals. Hawkes et al.
(2012) relate these differences to the varying strength of the
mortality filters (pg. 111). We ask whether we can detect mor-
tality filters in a very long-lived species by assessing rates of
reproduction in long-lived individuals by comparison to those
that die young. Such longitudinal examinations of age-related
changes in fecundity and survival should contribute to under-
standing the selective pressures shaping senescence patterns
(van de Pol and Verhulst 2006; Monaghan et al. 2008).
Among reindeer (Weladji et al. 2010) and other ungulates
(Loison et al. 1999; Gaillard et al. 2000), survival and rates of
reproduction are lower and more variable in both young and
older individuals compared to prime-aged females, and we
assess these patterns for elephants. Older mothers are of par-
ticular interest. They may have fewer resources to allocate to
reproduction due to depletion (e.g. Bérubé et al. 1999;
Ericsson et al. 2001; Gaillard et al. 2003; Nussey et al. 2006;
Weladji et al. 2010). Alternatively, in elephants where growth
is prolonged, older, larger and more experienced females
could allocate more time and milk energy to calves thereby
ensuring offspring growth and survival (e.g. Clutton-Brock
et al. 1984; Holand et al. 2006; Weladji et al. 2006, 2010),
and such care allocation may be specifically required for the
sons of older females (Lee and Moss 1986).
If the capacity to allocate care increases with age, older
females are predicted to continue to reproduce into later life
without either benefits or costs to daughters. However, since
elephant family groups act as collaborative infant-rearing
units (Moss and Lee 2011), older females might be expected
to allocate more towards the survival of grandchildren at the
expense of their own reproduction (e.g. Hawkes et al. 2011),
especially if these females provide their offspring with a com-
petitive advantage through knowledge transfer (Brent et al.
2015). Recent models of competition between related
(mothers and daughters; Mace and Alvergne 2012) and unre-
lated females (mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law;
Lahdenperä et al. 2012) with high generational overlap dem-
onstrates fertility and survival costs to prolonged co-reproduc-
tion, and these costs contribute to selection for reproductive
senescence and an extended lifespan. In such contexts, grand-
mothers are predicted to cease reproduction well before death.
We therefore examine whether mothers who reproduce into
older ages affect their co-resident daughters’ potential for re-
production, and whether possible grandmaternal contributions
(direct or indirect) can occur while the grandmother remains
reproductively active.
To address these questions, we describe age-specific repro-
ductive output for 834 individually known wild African ele-
phants in a 40+ year study period (representing ~60 % of a
potential lifespan). Similar to moose (Solberg et al. 2004), ele-
phants experience marked downstream growth, reproductive and
survival consequences of a poor start in life (Lee et al. 2013;
Mumby et al. 2015). We examine individual age-specific rates of
reproduction in relation to a female’s early experience, age at first
reproduction (e.g. Desprez et al. 2014) and longevity. We test an
additional life history trade-off, recently documented for work-
ing Asian elephants: that early reproducers have higher age-
specific fertility but shorter lifespans (Robinson et al. 2012).
Finally, we explore the potential consequences of reproductive
overlap between mothers and daughters.
Methods
Data collection
The study was conducted in and around Amboseli National
Park, southern Kenya, from September 1972 and is on-going,
with 42 years of observations analysed in this paper. The
protected area covers 392 km2 while the ecosystem and the
338
Behav Ecol Sociobiol (2016) 70:337–345
 elephants’ range extends over approximately 8000 km2 (Moss
et al. 2011). The population experiences minimal poaching
across its range while hunting was outlawed in the 1970s.
All members of the population are individually known and
have been followed over the period of the study by means of
a photographic recognition file or, in the case of young calves,
by their association with known mothers. Individuals and fam-
ily units (known kin units; Archie et al. 2006) are censused at
least once per month for demographic events (births, deaths,
oestrus, natal male independence). While some families can
be elusive in the large ecosystem, the 60 known families were
seen on average two to three times per month (range 0–6) (see
Moss et al. 2011). A total of 44,676 independent sightings of
elephants provide the baseline for demographic analyses.
The demographic dataset consists of birth dates assigned to
all individuals (N=2985; birth dates are coded with an accuracy
of ±2 weeks, N=2037; ±3 months, N=332; ±6 months, N=
268; ±2.5 years, N=243; ±5 years, N=105). Almost 80 % of
individuals are of known age. For those with estimated ages,
age is relatively easy to evaluate from body and head dimen-
sions since growth in height, back length and head circumfer-
ence is prolonged into the 50s (Moss et al. 2011). Our visually
assigned ages for older animals have been validated by com-
parisons with tooth ages after death using known-aged animals
as a baseline (Lee et al. 2012). Death dates are based on dates of
last known observation, carcass sightings, or records of illness/
injury. Our long experience with the tight-knit structure of fam-
ily units suggests that when a female has been missing from her
family and not seen elsewhere for 2 weeks but her calves were
present, she was dead. Accuracy of death dates was coded as
for births with only 4 % of female deaths having a poorly
known date. Maternity could be assigned for 2543 individuals,
and a maternal age at each birth event and the interval between
successive births (interbirth interval) was calculated.
Population level survival
Age-specific survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier
proportional hazards models for 1255 females with 511 natu-
ral deaths, including 178 females who entered the population
with estimated ages (left censored) and 962 females with
known ages. Survival was also assessed for a subset of 898
females that survived to age 9 (minimum age at first reproduc-
tion). Proportional hazards models were applied to females of
known age giving birth to their first calf to determine age at
first reproduction (AFR). We also examined calf longevity in
relation to mother’s age at first reproduction for known-aged
calves. Mortality rates are generally low in Amboseli, averag-
ing 1.7 % of the total population in any year. Survival analyses
considered only natural mortality although age-specific mor-
tality rates did not differ between natural (N=211) and human-
caused deaths (N=152) for females surviving to nine (Wald
χ2=1.13, p=0.287).
The use of hazard models assumes that the risks of mortality
are similar for individuals entering the population after 1972
compared to those entering before 1972. We have no evidence
for marked cohort differences between pre- and post-1972 fe-
males in age-specific survival rates, and the pre-1972 females
entered at all ages ranging from a few months to 49±5 years, so
a specific cohort differential was not expected. The population
of females was also right-censored, with 510 females in the
reproductive sample still living at the end of 2014.
We report the mean and 95 % confidence intervals from
hazards models for female survival and age at first reproduc-
tion for the population (N=532 known-age females, with
known ages at first birth).
Event analyses for individual female reproductive rates
Each female who survived to 9 years was included in an indi-
vidual event analysis (N=834). Females with estimated ages
were included only if they had a known reproductive trajec-
tory over a minimum of 2 years (sufficient for one gestation
length) within the 42 years of the study. Virtually all adult
females in this population gave birth at least once and only
three known-aged females have reached >20 years of age
without giving birth. Of the females in annual fertility calcu-
lations, 82 % had known birthdates. Each year of life experi-
enced by a female during the sample period (max N years=41)
was coded for birth/no birth event. Females entered and exited
the longitudinal sample at different ages, as some were ob-
served from <9 years to death (N=196) or are still living (N=
504). Other females were only observed from after age 9 (N=
128 dead, 6 living). Since prior reproductive events were un-
known for the 134 females who entered the sample over the
age of 9, this left-censoring might influence individually
based fertility calculations and we can only assume that the
risk of an event at each age to females who joined the study
after the age of first reproduction was unlikely to differ from
those who joined at birth, similar to our left-censored survival
rates above. If a female’s first reproductive event was un-
known, she was not included in AFR analyses. Event analysis
included all females irrespective of source of mortality since
there were no age-specific biases in cause of death. We did not
use the techniques of van de Pol and Verhulst (2006) because
only 38.8 % of our females have a complete reproductive
history terminating in death. As we have left- and right-
censored data, we interpret our findings with caution.
The following variables were determined for each fe-
male: (a) her age at first birth (only for known first
births); (b) calf probability of survival to 12 months and
longevity of daughters for mothers which survived to that
daughter’s minimum breeding age (9 years); (c) environ-
ment experienced in first year of life coded as drought (1)
or no drought (0) (based on a drought severity index, see
Lee et al. 2013); (d) age at death. Age at death was also
Behav Ecol Sociobiol (2016) 70:337–345
339
 coded into death before 40 years and survival to 40+,
based on average longevity from hazard analysis. Maternal
age was used in models as both a continuous and a cat-
egorical variable (young <20 as the maximum AFR,
prime=20–39, old >40 from average longevity). The use
of categorical ages eliminates some of the potential con-
tribution of ageing error to models.
The individual-based event analysis was also used to
assess the duration of overlap between simultaneously
breeding known mother–daughter pairs, which was com-
pared with the daughter’s age-specific reproductive rate,
following Mace and Alvergne (2012). Daughters’ repro-
ductive rates were calculated as number of calves pro-
duced by each female for every 5 years (one interbirth
interval) that she was present in the sample from ages
10 to 40, and then averaged across young and prime
maternal ages to reduce variance introduced by intrinsi-
cally lower rates in younger mothers. Most known
daughters were of prime reproductive age (mean ± SE
years=26±0.5, N=336). We used curve fit to determine
the best fit relationship.
We used generalised linear mixed-models (GLMM)
with a binomial distribution and logit link functions in
SPSS 19 (IBM Corp. Chicago) to assess effects of ma-
ternal age, longevity, early drought, and age at repro-
ductive onset on the probability of reproductive events
occurring for each female. Age at each event was en-
tered as a continuous variable, as well as age2 to im-
prove what was obviously a non-linear fit. Fixed effects
that did not contribute to the model were removed as
long as the explanatory power of the model did not
decrease. All two-way interactions were entered for ini-
tial models and then removed if they did not contribute
to the overall model fit. We present final model F sta-
tistics, parameter estimates and coefficients (with 95 %
Confidence Interval) for significant effects and interac-
tions. Maternal identity was added to models as a ran-
dom factor to control for repeated events for a female,
although the variance contributed by identity was zero.
Calf survival to 12 months was also assessed using
binomial logistic regression, with maternal age, birth
order (first, not first, since maternal experience affects
calf survival; Lee et al. 2013), drought and calf sex as
fixed factors and maternal identity as a random factor.
All data were tested for normality and log10 transformed
if skewed. Interbirth interval (IBI) was log transformed
for use in a generalised linear mixed-model, testing the
effects of maternal age, calf sex, calf drought experience
and birth order (first, not first) on IBI. Maternal identity
was again entered as a random factor.
It was neither possible nor appropriate to record data
blind because our study involved focal animals observed
in the field and was based on known events.
Results
Survival, reproductive onset and reproductive rates
Mean longevity was 34 years (med=37.9, 95 % CI=35.1–
40.7, N females=1255, natural mortality only); 40 % of fe-
males born survived to age 40, 20 % to 50 and 10 % into their
60s. A female who survived to the minimum age at first re-
production (9 years) could expect to live on average for an-
other 32 years (median=41.25 years, 95 % CI=39.7–42.8,
N=898), while a female who survived to 14 (average first
reproduction, N=758) would live for another 28 years. Cohort
longevity or the age by which 95 % of females had died was
65 years.
Mean known age at first birth was 13.86 years (me-
dian=13.5, 95 % CI=13.3–14.1, N=532); early repro-
ducers were subsequently classed as <12.5 (youngest
quartile) and late reproducers classed as 15+ (oldest
quartile). The age by which 5 % of females had com-
menced reproduction was 10.5 years. Once females
commenced reproduction, they typically gave birth to a
calf about every 5 years (mean=0.186 births per female
per year from 20 to 39—prime females), with a marked
decline in reproductive rate after 40 (Fig. 1). The age
where 95 % of cohort fertility had passed was 49 years.
Contrary to expectations, variance in reproductive rates
was lower for younger (0.133) and older (0.145) fe-
males than for the prime age group (0.159, Levene’s
test for equality of variances, F=65.52, p<0.001).
A female’s age at first birth (early, average or late) was
compared with her survival probabilities using hazard
analysis. Early reproducers had similar longevity (mean=
36.8 years, 95 % CI=33.7–39.8, N=129) to late repro-
ducers (mean=39.6 years, 95 % CI=37.4–41.7, N=357,
log-rank χ2=1.98, p=0.16). Mothers who reproduced early
were predicted to have offspring with reduced longevity,
as they would be younger, smaller and potentially less
able to invest in milk. However, offspring longevity did
not vary as a function of their mother’s age at first repro-
duction (longevity for early AFR: mean=17.2 years, 95 %
CI=14.8–19.3, N=237; longevity for average AFR:
mean=23.5 years, 95 % CI=19.9–27.2, N=163; longevity
for late AFR: mean=20.3 years, 95 % CI=17.4–23.2, N=
146; log-rank χ2=0.55, p=0.76; known-age calves only).
The probability of giving birth at each age was
strongly related to age in a non-linear fashion
(Table 1), with differences between survivors and those
dying before 40 (Table 1, Fig. 2). Females commencing
reproduction early (Table 1) had higher age-specific
probabilities of giving birth. Reproductive rates for age
were unaffected by whether the female’s age at entry to
the sample was before or after age 9 (sample bias) or
by her early drought experience.

 Age-specific investment in calves
Calf mortality in the first 12 months of life was unrelated to
maternal age (F 1, 2418=1.21, p=0.30), although first-born
calves (F=5.73, p<0.001; first=0.204 (0.154–0.264), not
first=0.141 (0.154–0.264)), drought-born calves (F=53.02,
p<0.001, dry=0.243 (0.201–0.291), not dry=0.116 (0.094–
0.142)) and sons (F=8.9, p=0.003; males=0.198 (0.163–
0.238), females=0.145 (0.117–0.179) were more likely to
die in the first year, independent of maternal age (overall mod-
el fit: 86.6 %; F5, 2418=12.63, p<0.001; variance(ID)=0.218±
0.117). The high contribution of individual to the model sug-
gests that some mothers were consistently better or worse at
rearing calves.

and were longer for mothers of sons at all ages (F1,1520=4.54,
p=0.033, sons=62.1 months, daughters=48.5 months,
mother’s age centred at 28.8 years). There was, however, no
interaction between offspring sex and maternal age category
(F3,1250=0.638, p=0. 591). In addition, although sons re-
quired more time and energy than did daughters, no differ-
ences in birth sex ratio were found for mothers of any age
(1286 F, 1281 M; binomial exact χ2=0.306, p=0.86), nor
for calves born to females aged over 40 (143 F: 153 M, χ2=
0.338, p=0.5).
Grandmothering
Daughters with a mother that survived for at least her first
9 years of life had greater longevity (mean=27.6 years,
95 % CI=25.9–29.1) than did daughters whose mothers died
before 9 years of age (mean=18.9 years, 95 % CI=16–21.1,
log-rank χ2=45.9, p<0.001, known-aged females only).
The time that known mother–daughter pairs were simulta-
neously breeding within their family unit ranged from 1 to
30 years and averaged 8.4 years. For females whose mothers
were alive after they commenced reproduction, there was a
slight enhancement in age-specific rates of reproduction with
a longer duration of overlap between mother–daughter co-
breeders (r2=0.135, df=3, 321, p<0.001; Fig. 3). Only 10
of 281 mothers survived for more than 10 years (two interbirth
intervals) without giving birth to a calf while their daughters
were also reproducing, suggesting that exclusive
grandmothering in the absence of reproduction is not an ele-
phant trait. In some large families, three generations of moth-
er–daughter pairs could be simultaneously reproducing.
Discussion
We used an individual-based approach for assessing age-
specific fertility (Nussey et al. 2008; Robinson et al. 2012)
and proportional hazards models for determining longevity
among these known-age females. Amboseli elephant females
exhibited the classical mammalian pattern of an age-specific
decline in reproductive rate, but with moderately extended
post-reproductive viability (Levitis et al. 2013; Lahdenperä
et al. 2014). With an average fertility decline at 49 years for
females, and cohort longevity of 65 years, the mean period of
post-fertile viability (e.g. Levitis and Lackey 2011) was
16 years. Although the reproductive longevity of elephants
appears to be greater than that of other non-human terrestrial
species, this effect might be expected simply as a result of
allometry (Carey and Judge 2001; Croft et al. 2015).
Less than 30 % of this population survived past the onset of
fertility decline suggesting that survivors were unusual with
retention of a small number of high viability individuals.

 Females who died before the median longevity of 40 years
had reduced reproductive rates for their age while females
who survived the mortality filter sustained higher rates of
reproduction throughout their lives. These observed effects
might represent the censored nature of the population with
only 40 % of the study population having died. However, in
their responses to a mortality filter, elephants are similar to
humans (Thomas et al. 2000; Hawkes and Smith 2010), wild
chimpanzees (Thompson et al. 2007) and a range of birds and
mammals (Rebke et al. 2010) where longer survival is also
associated with higher reproductive rates and reproductive
senescence only becomes apparent at extreme old age. While
we may be detecting the selective disappearance of poor re-
producers in the population (e.g. van de Pol and Verhulst
2006), with low rates of mortality (as is characteristic of this
population) even high-risk individuals may simply survive
better (Hawkes et al. 2011).
Elephant annual fertility rates are constrained by a 22-
month gestation as well as lactational anestrus of 12+ months,
and their long lifespan encompasses numerous cycles of abun-
dance and drought which potentially impact on their condition
during reproduction. Elephant females also grow for at least
the first 25–30 years of life, increasing in mass and height.
After this age, they may still gain mass although only slowly
(Hanks 1972). Thus, a female’s condition at each reproductive
event is influenced by her early growth (Lee et al. 2013), the
cumulative demands of the previous calf over its lactation
period, which are more extreme for sons (see also Lee and
Moss 1986; Moss and Lee 2011), and her current reserves and
nutritional status (e.g. Wittemyer et al. 2007; Foley et al. 2008;
Hayward et al. 2014). All of these factors could potentially
influence the likelihood of an individual reproducing in addi-
tion to its age. Individual responses in reproductive potential,
interacting with age-specific patterns of reproductive senes-
cence, are seen in other long-lived species (Bérubé et al.
1999) and make it difficult to tease apart intrinsic vulnerabil-
ities due to age from the consequences of local constraints.
Late age at reproductive onset, reflecting slow growth and
poor physical condition early in life (Lee et al. 2013), was
associated with a reduced probability of reproducing at each
age. Early starters are significantly more productive in a vari-
ety of species (e.g. Nussey et al. 2006; van de Pol and Verhulst
2006; Robinson et al. 2012; Desprez et al. 2014) and the
African elephant females in this sample who commenced re-
production early also had higher reproductive rates by com-
parison to later reproducers for the 40 year period of monitor-
ing. Unlike working Asian elephants however (Robinson et al.
2012; Mumby et al. 2015), early reproducers appeared to suf-
fer no marked survival consequences nor did their calves ex-
perience reduced longevity although, again, our sample is

 time-limited. Calf survival was a function of maternal experi-
ence and environmental conditions in the first year of life (see
also Lee et al. 2013), but it was experience and not absolute
maternal age that mattered. Unlike reindeer (Weladji et al.
2010) or Asian elephants (e.g. Lahdenperä et al. 2015), calf
survival for older mothers did not differ significantly from that
of prime females while the calves of primiparous females
experienced the highest risk of early mortality. We found no
evidence of differential investment at older ages: interbirth
intervals for mothers of surviving calves followed a U-
shaped curve, as would be expected given age-specific repro-
ductive rates. Sons also appeared to be expensive for all fe-
males suggesting that there were no marked end of life sex-
specific allocation strategies in these mothers. The lack of a
trade-off between survival, reproductive onset and reproduc-
tive rate for age suggests positive covariance over the lifespan
for the longer-lived females. We suggest that longevity has
reproductive advantages, which are shared with family mem-
bers through grandmothering, and thus an extended lifespan
with prolonged fertility has been under positive selection.
The social advantages of longevity are clear for elephants; the
oldest females act as repositories of knowledge (McComb et al.
2001, 2011; Mutinda et al. 2011), they actively grandmother
calves providing protection and social cohesion even while also
mothering their own calves, and early calf survival is enhanced
by the presence of a grandmother in a family (Moss and Lee
2011). Only a small number of elderly females in this sample
ceased reproduction prior to death with the potential to augment
their daughters’ reproductive success through caring for grand-
offspring (e.g. Mace and Alvergne 2012), while the presence of
mothers even when reproducing themselves enhanced daugh-
ters’ reproductive rates. Maternal longevity within families thus
improved daughter survival to reproductive age and appeared to
increase rather than diminish their daughters’ reproductive rate,
as predicted for female-kin units where grandmothers contribute
to information exchange (Croft et al. 2015). Behavioral ageing,
associated with cognitive declines or social inadequacies, there-
fore appears to be rare in elephants, at least until extreme old age,
while reproductive senescence follows the age-specific pattern
expected for a mammal of this size.
