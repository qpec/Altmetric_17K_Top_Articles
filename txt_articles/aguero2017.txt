ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Left atrial (LA) remodeling after an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is poorly characterized regarding
its determinants or its effect on ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) development.
OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was: 1) to compare LA structural remodeling in experimental MI swine models
recapitulating the effects of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, ischemic MR, and left atrial infarction (LAI); and 2) to
analyze how LA remodeling influences ischemic MR development.
METHODS Three models of MI were generated: 1) proximal left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery occlusion involving
the LA branch (LAI group); 2) proximal LCx occlusion not involving the LA branch (LCx group); and 3) left anterior
descending (LAD) occlusion (LAD group). Serial cardiac magnetic resonance scans were performed to define LA and LV
remodeling and ischemic MR, and were correlated with histology.
RESULTS Occlusion of the LA branch (LAI group) induced a greater degree of LA dilation at 1 and 8 weeks
post-MI than the LCx and LAD groups, along with early and severe impairment of LA function. In the LCx and LAD
groups, LA dysfunction was less pronounced and not consistent. Development of ischemic MR was more pronounced in
the LAI group than in the LCx group. Histology confirmed atrial infarction with extensive fibrosis in the LAI group and
interstitial fibrosis in the LCx group. In the LAD group, LA remodeling was not observed by cardiac magnetic
resonance or histology.
CONCLUSIONS We provide the first experimental evidence of the deleterious effect of acute LAI on atrial
structural remodeling, characterized by early LA dilation, dysfunction, and fibrosis, and early occurrence
of ischemic MR. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;70:2878–89) © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on behalf of

hronic heart failure (HF) is a major cause of
death and hospitalization. Despite advances
in patient care, incident HF in myocardial
infarction (MI) survivors remains a major cost burden
to health care systems (1). In the aftermath of acute
MI, the classic predictor of future adverse events,
including sudden cardiac death and HF development,
is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (2). More
recently, left atrial (LA) dilation has been proposed
as a novel predictor of HF, providing independent
prognostic value in addition to LVEF (3–5).
In the early post-MI period, excessive LA dilation
occurs in w15% to 45% of patients (3–5). The main
cause of LA dilation is thought to be increased atrial
pressures due to LV dysfunction (6). However, little
attention has been paid to 2 other potentially key
contributors to post-MI LA
remodeling: ischemic
mitral
regurgitation
(MR)
and
atrial
infarction.
Ischemic MR is caused by LV remodeling and a
geometric distortion of the mitral valve that alters
normal leaflet coaptation (7). Previous studies have
suggested a close association between ischemic MR
and post-MI LA remodeling (8); however, it remains
unclear whether LA remodeling is a cause or conse-
quence. Atrial infarction remains a clinical challenge
of unknown incidence and consequences, mainly due
to
the
lack
of
reliable
diagnostic
markers
(9).
Recently, LA coronary branch occlusion has been
identified as a complication in up to 15% of patients
undergoing
percutaneous
coronary
intervention,
leading to a higher prevalence of atrial arrhythmias,
periprocedural MI, and mortality (10), underscoring
its
clinical
importance.
The
effect
of
left
atrial
infarction (LAI) on LA structure and function has not
been
explored
before,
and
most
of
our
current
knowledge is derived from autopsy reports (11).
Atrial structural remodeling refers to the process of
LA enlargement and mechanical function impairment
that
occurs
in
many
cardiovascular
conditions,
including ischemic heart disease (12). From a clinical
imaging perspective, atrial structural remodeling is
defined as an increase in LA dimensions and impair-
ment of the atrial phasic function components; from a
histological perspective, the complex cellular changes
in this remodeling process are poorly understood (12).
Clinical and experimental observations suggest that
interstitial fibrosis is a key phenomenon un-
derlying atrial structural remodeling in con-
ditions such as chronic HF and MR (13). Upon
acute MI, the effects of overlapping factors
such as pressure and volume overload, in
addition to atrial ischemia, can lead to spe-
cific structural substrate remodeling that, to
the best of our knowledge, has not been
characterized.
The aim of this study was to provide new
insight into the causes, mechanisms, and
consequences of LA structural remodeling as a
complication of acute MI. Three pig models of
MI were created: 1) occlusion of the proximal
left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) with concomitant
occlusion of the LA branch (LAI group); 2) occlusion of
the proximal LCx coronary artery without involve-
ment of the LA branch (LCx group); and 3) occlusion of
the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (LAD group).
The specific aims were: 1) to evaluate the incidence
and progression of post-MI LA structural remodeling
(in
relation
to
the
culprit
coronary
artery);
and
2) to analyze the interplay of LA dilation (and scar
formation) and post-MI LA function with LV remod-
eling (and scar formation) and the development of
ischemic MR. These processes were assessed by
noninvasive
cardiac
magnetic
resonance
(CMR)
imaging at 1 and 8 weeks post-MI and histology after
sacrifice at 8 weeks post-MI.
METHODS
The study was approved by the institutional animal
research committee and conducted in accordance
with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care
and
Use
of
Laboratory
Animals.

STUDY DESIGN. Closed-chest MI was induced in male
large-white pigs (30 to 35 kg) by instrumentation of
the LAD or LCx coronary arteries. LCx infarctions
were divided into those with or without associated
atrial coronary occlusion (see detailed description in
the following text) and were used as model of
ischemic MR. Anterior infarctions were generated by
LAD ischemia-reperfusion to provide a post-MI model
of LV dysfunction. Three experimental groups were
created (Figure 1): 1) LCx occlusion (LCx group, n ¼ 7

scans
were
obtained
at
baseline
(before MI) and at 1 and 8 weeks post-MI to evaluate
LA and LV structural remodeling and development
of MR. Animals were sacrificed at 8 weeks post-MI
and the hearts were excised for histological analysis
of LA scarring and fibrosis.
MODELING CHRONIC POST-INFARCTION ISCHEMIC
MR AND LAI. We established a technique for inducing
ischemic MR in pigs that involves placing a coronary
coil in the proximal segment of moderate-to-large
LCx arteries (Online Appendix, Online Figure 1).
To evaluate the effect of acute LA injury during MI,
animals undergoing LCx coiling were subclassified
according
to
whether
there
was
angiographic
occlusion of the LA branch, which emerges from
the proximal LCx segments or less frequently from the
mid-LCx segment. Because the exact occlusion site
was determined by the coil position after deployment
at the proximal LCx artery, animals were assigned to
the LCx or LAI groups upon examination of the final
angiogram at the end of the catheterization procedure.

 and necrosis in the absence of other contributors,
we induced anterior infarction by 45-min mid-LAD
occlusion distal to first diagonal branch followed
by reperfusion (LAD group) (14,15). This procedure
produces consistent transmural infarction with LV
dilation and systolic dysfunction (15).
CMR ACQUISITION PROTOCOL AND DATA ANALYSIS.
CMR was performed at baseline (before MI) and
at 1 and 8 weeks post-infarction, as previously reported
(14) (see Online Appendix for detailed description).
LA volumes and function were defined as follows.
Because no volumetric estimation methods have been
validated in pigs, we quantified LA dimensions based
on the mean area from the 4- and 2-chamber views.
From these views, 3 phasic parameters were derived
as follows.
1. Reservoir function or expansion index (%): 100 $
(maximal LA area � minimum LA area)/minimum
LA area
2. Conduit function (%): 100 $ (maximal LA area �
pre-atrial contraction area)/maximal LA area
3. Booster function (%): 100 $ (pre-atrial contraction
area � minimum LA area)/pre-atrial contraction
area
Quantification
of
post-MI
MR
severity
was
performed in the LCx and LAI groups and in a subset
of the LAD group (n ¼ 4). The LV forward stroke
volume (SV) was obtained from a phase-contrast
sequence in the ascending aorta, and mitral regur-
gitant volume (RegVol) and regurgitant fraction (RF)
were calculated as follows.
� CineSV ¼ LV end-diastolic volume � LV end-systolic
volume
� RegVol ¼ forward SV � CineSV
� RF ¼ RegVol/CineSV
HISTOLOGY. After excision of the heart (at 1 week
post-infarction
in
2
pigs
and
at
8
weeks
post-
infarction in the remaining), tissue from the LA
anterior wall was fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin, embedded in paraffin wax, and cut into
4-mm sections. Picrosirius red–, hematoxylin-eosin–,
and Masson’s trichrome–stained sections were digi-
talized with a scanner (Nanozoomer-RS C110730,
Hamamatsu,
Photonics
K.K.K.,
Hamamatsu
City,
Japan). Collagen organization was qualitatively eval-
uated
using
polarized
light
microscopy
(Nikon
ECLIPSE 90i, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) on
Picrosirius red–stained sections. Immunohistochem-
istry was performed to detect inflammatory cells in
atrial tissue.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Continuous variables are
expressed as median (interquartile range). Between-
group comparisons at each time point were per-
formed using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test
followed by post hoc analysis corrected for multiple
comparisons (Holm method). Associations between
different parameters were evaluated using the Spear-
man’s correlation coefficient. Statistical analyses were
performed using R software version 3.1.1 (R Founda-
tion
for
Statistical
Computing,
Vienna,
Austria).
Statistical significance was assigned at p < 0.05.

vided in the Online Appendix. Final analyses were

TIME COURSE OF LA DILATION AFTER INFARCTION.
LA dilation (at 1 week) was present in both groups of
pigs undergoing LCx coil occlusion (LCx and LAI
groups); however, dilation was larger in LAI pigs
(Table 1, Figure 2). Moreover, LA dilation progressed
faster in the LAI group from weeks 1 to 8. Interest-
ingly, overall LA dilation was observed in the LAD
group (compared with control pigs).

 (Table 1, Figure 3). LA reservoir function was most
prominently impaired in the LAI group (16.2% vs.
64.0% in controls, contrasting with 32.5% in the LCx
group and 37.2% in the LAD group). At 8 weeks
post-MI, the LCx and LAD groups showed a modest
recovery in LA reservoir function (36.0% and 43.5%,
respectively), whereas reservoir function in the LAI
group remained weak (20.8%) (Table 1, Figure 3).
Atrial contractility, measured as the booster pump
function, followed a similar pattern, with the most
prominent
changes
occurring
in
the
LAI
group
(Table 1). Booster function in the LAI group was
sharply reduced at 1 week post-MI (to 4.4%) and
remained severely depressed at 8 weeks (8.1%). The
LCx group showed more moderate reductions (15.9%
at 1 week and 18.5% at 8 weeks), and the LAD group
revealed the least reductions (21.4% at 1 week and
21.2% at 8 weeks). Within individual animals, a strong
correlation
was
observed
between
reservoir
and
contractile properties (rho ¼ 0.84; p < 0.001).
Atrial conduit function after acute MI was impaired
to a similar extent in all groups, and no significant
changes were observed between early and late follow-
up (Table 1). This suggests that extrinsic factors other
than LAI may influence impairment of this function,
because LA conduit function is merely the transit of
blood from the pulmonary veins to the LV. Interest-
ingly, conduit function was the most prominently
decreased component in the LAD group (Table 1).

AND
FUNCTION. Table

summarizes
the
time
course of CMR-determined LV structural remodeling
and ischemic MR parameters in the experimental
models. In all groups, post-MI LV remodeling was
characterized by an enlarged LV and decreased LVEF.
LV
infarcts
(quantified
with
a
late
gadolinium
enhancement CMR sequence at 1 week) were signifi-
cantly larger in the LCx and LAI occlusion groups
(median infarct size 37.8% and 37.2%) than in the
LAD group (28.1%). LV volume showed a similar
pattern (Table 2).
At 1 week, significant modest linear associations
were noted between LA dilation (maximal area) and
LV infarct size (rho ¼ 0.36; p ¼ 0.02) and LV

 end-systolic volume (rho ¼ 0.38; p ¼ 0.01). These
findings suggest that LV infarct size and LV end-
systolic
volume
are
not
the
only
factors
influ-
encing post-MI LA dilation. Direct damage to the LA
during LA branch occlusion may lead to larger LA
volumes and more pronounced acute impairment of
LA
function.
Subsequently,
LV
dilation
and
dysfunction together with MR would result in faster
progression of LA remodeling and dysfunction in
the LAI group than in the LCx and LAD groups.
DEVELOPMENT OF ISCHEMIC MR. Ischemic MR was
measured
from
CMR-derived
regurgitant
volume
and
regurgitant
fraction
(RF)
obtained
at
1
and
8 weeks post-MI (Table 1). Ischemic MR was mild in
the LCx group at 1 week (RF ¼ 4.3%) but was more
severe by 8 weeks (RF ¼ 15.6%). In the LAI group,
ischemic MR was even more pronounced at 1 week
(RF ¼ 17.2%) with further progression by 8 weeks
(RF ¼ 25.1%), showing a clear association with the
early severe LA remodeling in this group. In the LAD
subgroup
of
4
assessed
animals,
ischemic
MR
observed at 1 week post-MI was mild and improved
by the 8-week follow-up.
HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF POST-INFARCTION LA
STRUCTURAL REMODELING. The effect of perma-
nent
LA
branch
occlusion
on
LA
structure
was
evaluated in 2 additional animals undergoing the LAI
procedure and sacrificed at 1 week. Compared with
healthy atrial tissue from control animals, atrial tis-
sue from LAI animals showed extensive myocardial
injury, with cardiomyocyte loss and areas of fibrosis
(Figures 4C to 4H), providing histological confirma-
tion of the atrial infarction in this model. Qualitative
assessment by polarized light microscopy revealed an
immature collagen fiber organization in these areas,
suggesting an early process of post-infarction repair
in the LA myocardium.
Histological changes were assessed at 8 weeks
post-MI in animals that completed the protocol. Atria
were harvested immediately after the 8-week CMR.
Extensive LA enlargement was observed in the LAI
group (Online Figure 2). Atrial enlargement was
associated with severe interstitial collagen deposition
(Figure 4, Online Figure 3). Conversely, LA tissue
from the LCx group was characterized by mild inter-
stitial
fibrosis.
No
pathological
changes
were
observed in the LAD group, consistent with the
absence of atrial dilation in this group in the CMR
studies. Inflammatory cells were detected in the

 DISCUSSION
The
present
study
provides
insight
into
the
determinants and consequences of LA remodeling
in translational large animal models of acute MI
(Central Illustration). The findings are as follows.
1. LAI complicating LCx-dependent infarction (LAI
group) results in significant LA remodeling, with
extensive scarring or fibrosis formation during the
first week post-MI. These anatomical LA changes
are associated with acutely and markedly altered
reservoir and booster pump function and ischemic
MR progression.
2. Ischemic MR without concomitant LAI (LCx group)
is
associated
with
early
and
progressive
LA
structural remodeling, although to a lesser extent
than when associated with LAI (LAI group).
3. Post-MI LV dysfunction without ischemic MR or
LAI
is
associated
with
mild,
transient
LA
remodeling.

 progression of LA chamber dilation and functional
impairment from the subacute (1 week) to the chronic
(8 weeks) phase identifies a specific time course of
atrial myopathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first experimental evidence for the structural and
functional effect of LAI, both in the early and late post-
MI periods. In this regard, although atrial infarction
diagnosis remains an unsolved challenge (10), autopsy
reports suggest that the incidence is significant (11).
The atrial coronary circulation system is complex (16),
and the response of the atrial chamber to ischemia is
poorly characterized. Prior studies showed that LA
ischemia blunts the compensatory booster pump
function during acute occlusion of the LA branch (17).

branch (LAI associated with proximal LCx occlusion)
CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION Mechanisms of LA Remodeling After Acute MI
Aguero, J. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2017;70(23):2878–89.
LA mechanical and electrical remodeling occurs in some cases after acute MI. This remodeling is associated with increased risk of HF and susceptibility to atrial
fibrillation. Cases in which the posterior LV wall is infarcted (e.g., left circumflex coronary artery occlusion), ischemic MR occurs because of leaflet retraction secondary
to papillary muscle dysfunction. This increases LA pressure. In addition to this mechanism, when left circumflex coronary artery occlusion occurs at its very proximal
segment, the LA branch can be occluded, resulting in LA necrosis. This mechanism plays a significant role in further contributing to atrial remodeling. Even in cases of
MI not affecting mitral valve function primarily, the increase in LV pressures can result in “retrograde” increases in LA pressures, resulting in some degree of atrial
remodeling. If the infarction does not affect the mitral valve function and is not large enough, no LA remodeling occurs. HF ¼ heart failure; LA ¼ left atrial; LAD ¼ left
anterior descending; LAI ¼ left atrial infarction; LCx ¼ left circumflex artery; LV ¼ left ventricular; MI ¼ myocardial infarction; MR ¼ mitral regurgitation.

 resulted in severe atrial scarring and fibrosis due to
replacement of extensive areas of cardiomyocyte
loss. Collagen staining at 7 days post-MI revealed an
immature structure. Conversely, at 8 weeks post-MI,
a well-organized network with extensive interstitial
distribution was observed. At this chronic stage,
LA extracellular matrix remodeling was character-
ized
by
excessive
collagen
deposition.
The
net
increase in collagen content likely contributes to the
persistent, abnormal LA physiology, with marked
blunting of reservoir and booster functions. This
histological pattern in response to ischemic injury
and
the
associated
atrial
structural
remodeling
(dilation
and
dysfunction)
differs
from
previous
reports,
which
showed
varying
degrees
of
atrial
interstitial
fibrosis
in
experimental
models,
including chronic atrial pacing, HF, and volume
overload (18,19).
INTERPLAY BETWEEN LA STRUCTURAL REMODELING
AND DEVELOPMENT OF ISCHEMIC MR. Our time course
data indicate that LAI is a major determinant of early
ischemic MR severity, with a much higher RF in
the LAI group at 1 week post-MI (15% vs. 4% in the
LCx group). Interestingly, at this time point, the LCx
group had a similar extent of LV structural injury
assessed by infarct size, LV volume, and LVEF,
suggesting that the mitral subvalvular apparatus was
similarly affected in the LAI and LCx groups. This
conclusion is supported by the similar progression of
ischemic MR from early (1 week) to late (8 weeks)
follow-up in these groups (RF increasing from 7.9% to
11.3%)
(Table
1),
suggesting
that
progressive
LV
remodeling is the driving mechanism. Ischemic MR is
defined as a consequence of chronic LV remodeling
and changes to the mitral subvalvular apparatus,
typically occurring 2 weeks after acute MI (20).
Based on our observations, we propose that in the LAI
group, scarring after direct damage to the LA would
lead to early LA dilation and dysfunction. This LA
remodeling may alter the mitral valve geometry by
inducing mitral annulus dilation (Online Results,
Online Table 1), resulting in leaflet malcoaptation and
MR. Subsequent LV remodeling may lead to faster
progression of LA dilation and dysfunction, with
larger mitral regurgitant volumes than in the other
groups.
CONTRIBUTION OF LV INJURY TO LA REMODELING
AFTER
ACUTE
INFARCTION. At
1
week
post-MI,
there was only a moderate correlation (correlation
coefficient w0.4) between CMR-assessed LV remod-
eling (estimated from ESV or infarct size) and LA
remodeling. In our experimental setting, this weak
correlation was due to the absence of overall LA
dilation in most animals in the LAD group and the
intrinsic LA injury effect in the LAI group. Interest-
ingly, clinical studies show that the LV dimensions
are larger in patients with early LA dilation (3–5), but
the linear correlation between LV and LA parameters
is poor (21), indicating a significant role for other
factors, such as clinical history.
The lack of LA dilation in most animals in the LAD
group was an unexpected study finding. Our study
design could not answer whether larger LAD infarcts
(seen in individual cases) (Figure 2) or longer follow-
up periods would have eased the detection of LA
remodeling;
however,
this
is
suggested by
prior
experimental reports (22). In general, infarct size was
smaller in the LAD group versus the LCx and LAI
groups (37.8% vs. 37.2% and 31.6%, respectively)
(Table 2), probably due to differences in the site and
duration of coronary occlusion (mid-LAD ischemia-
reperfusion
vs.
chronic
proximal
LCx
occlusion).
The absence of structural LA remodeling was sup-
ported by the absence of fibrosis in the histological
analysis. LA remodeling was not comprehensively
characterized
in
previous
experimental
models.
Chamber dilation has been described in very large,
proximal LAD infarctions after 3 months of follow-up
(22) and in the rat model of post-MI HF (23), whereas
most ischemic MR models focused on valve geometry
rather than LA remodeling (7,24–26). Finally, atrial
function
changes
in
the
LAD
group
(decreased
conduit and reservoir function) may be explained by
impaired
LV
function
by
mechanisms
previously
described (27), because no histological abnormalities
were found.
In the present study, time course assessment of LA
structural
remodeling
(dilation,
dysfunction,
and
histology) provided novel insights into the role of
fibrosis.
Although
intrinsic
atrial
injury
due
to
infarction (LAI group) produced early dilation and
persistent functional impairment, there was some
degree of improvement in reservoir function (LAI
group vs. LCx group) (Figure 3). This suggests that
factors other than fibrosis may affect LA function
in this setting, such as atrial stunning. Large clinical
series
suggest
that
the
late
progression
of
LA
remodeling parameters (LA dimensions or reservoir
function) is only weakly predicted by baseline LV or
LA imaging parameters obtained during early post-MI
assessment (4,28–29).
Clinical
studies
indicate
that
both
LA
remodeling
and

 outcome independently of LV remodeling parameters
(3–5,8,21,28,30,31). A plausible explanation is the
development of pulmonary hypertension as a conse-
quence of increased LA pressures. Supporting this
explanation, in our preliminary observations, LA
remodeling parameters and ischemic MR severity
both correlated with pulmonary hemodynamics in the
LAI and LCx groups (Online Appendix, Online Table 2,
Online Figures 6 and 7).
The present study provides evidence of the effects
of
atrial
infarction
during
acute
MI
on
the
LA
remodeling
process.
In
this
regard,
recent
data
suggest that atrial coronary occlusion is a relatively
frequent (w15%) complication of percutaneous coro-
nary intervention and entails a markedly higher
risk of atrial arrhythmias (10), confirming previous
experimental
observations
that
linked
acute
LA
ischemia to greater arrhythmia vulnerability (32–34).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. The LCx occlusion induced to
model atrial ischemia entailed severe LV remodeling
and ischemic MR, limiting our ability to isolate the
contribution of each component. We did not specif-
ically
investigate
the
contribution
of
distal
LCx
branches (that may have induced posterior LA wall
ischemia) or proximal right coronary artery branches
to left atrial perfusion (35).
The lack of hemodynamic measurements at the
early stage, including LV end-diastolic or LA pres-
sures limits our understanding regarding the absence
of atrial remodeling in the LAD group. However, in
previous studies (17,36), both LV end-diastolic and LA
pressures increased acutely to a similar extent in both
LAD and LCx coronary occlusions, but LA function
was only impaired in the LCx group. Although these
studies support the notion that proximal LCx occlu-
sion impairs LA function due to LA ischemia, they
lacked follow up surveillance of atrial remodeling and
histology changes.
We did not investigate ECG changes nor quantify
the
atrial
infarction
size
by
CMR,
and
future
translational studies are warranted to evaluate such
atrial
involvement
by
noninvasive
diagnostic
strategies.
CONCLUSIONS
The current study provides the first experimental
evidence of the structural effect of LAI after acute MI.
In addition to acute LA dilation, major features of this
entity
are
severe
and
persistent
atrial
function
impairment
and
extensive
fibrosis.
Acute
atrial
dilation and dysfunction contribute to the early
occurrence
of
ischemic
MR,
whereas
ischemic
MR
progression
further
affects
atrial
structural
remodeling through a complex interplay.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: After
acute MI, remodeling of the LA carries an unfavorable
prognosis. Occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery
proximal to the origin of the LA branch causes atrial
infarction, followed by early LA remodeling, enlarge-
ment, and extensive atrial fibrosis, and then by pro-
gressive ischemic MR.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are
needed to relate post-infarction LA remodeling and
resulting mitral valve function to left heart hemody-
namics and findings obtained by multimodality
imaging.
