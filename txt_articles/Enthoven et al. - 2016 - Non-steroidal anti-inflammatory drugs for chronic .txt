Background
Chronic back pain is an important health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to treat people
with low back pain, especially people with acute back pain. Short term NSAID use is also recommended for pain relief in people
with chronic back pain. Two types of NSAIDs are available and used to treat back pain: non-selective NSAIDs and selective COX-
2 NSAIDs. In 2008, a Cochrane review identified a small but significant effect from NSAIDs compared to placebo in people with
chronic back pain. This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2008 and focuses on people with chronic low back pain.
Objectives
To determine if NSAIDs are more efficacious than various comparison treatments for non-specific chronic low back pain and if so,
which type of NSAID is most efficacious.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and two clinical trials registry databases up to 24 June 2015 for randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) published in English, German or Dutch. We also screened references cited in relevant reviews.
Selection criteria
We included RCTs (double-blind and single-blind) of NSAIDs used to treat people with chronic low back pain.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion in this Cochrane review according to the inclusion criteria. One review
author extracted the data, and a second review author checked the data. Two review authors independently evaluated the risk of bias
of all included trials. If data were clinically homogeneous, we performed a meta-analysis and assessed the quality of evidence using the
GRADE approach.

 Main results
We included 13 trials in this Cochrane review. Ten studies were at ’low’ risk of bias. Six studies compared NSAIDs with placebo, and
included 1354 participants in total. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo, with a mean difference
in pain intensity score from baseline of -6.97 (95% CI −10.74 to −3.19) on a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale (VAS) with a median
follow-up of 56 days (interquartile range (IQR) 13 to 91 days). Four studies measured disability using the Roland Morris Disability
Questionnaire. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo on disability, with a mean difference from
baseline of −0.85 (95% CI −1.30 to −0.40) on a scale from 0 to 24 with a median follow-up of 84 days (IQR 42 to 105 days).
All six placebo controlled studies also reported adverse events, and suggested that adverse events are not statistically significant more
frequent in participants using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.17). Due to the relatively small sample
size and relatively short follow-up in most included trials, it is likely that the proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event is
underestimated.
Two studies compared different types of non-selective NSAIDs, namely ibuprofen versus diclofenac and piroxicam versus indomethacin.
The trials did not find any differences between these NSAID types, but both trials had small sample sizes. One trial reported no
differences in pain intensity between treatment groups that used selective or non-selective NSAIDs. One other trial compared diflunisal
with paracetamol and showed no difference in improvement from baseline on pain intensity score. One trial showed a better global
improvement in favour of celecoxib versus tramadol.
One included trial compared NSAIDs with ’home-based exercise’. Disability improved more in participants who did exercises versus
participants receiving NSAIDs, but pain scores were similar.
Authors’ conclusions
Six of the 13 included RCTs showed that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo regarding pain intensity. NSAIDs are slightly more
effective than placebo regarding disability. However, the magnitude of the effects is small, and the level of evidence was low. When we
only included RCTs at low risk of bias, differences in effect between NSAIDs and placebo were reduced. We identified no difference in
efficacy between different NSAID types, including selective versus non-selective NSAIDs. Due to inclusion of RCTs only, the relatively
small sample sizes and relatively short follow-up in most included trials, we cannot make firm statements about the occurrence of
adverse events or whether NSAIDs are safe for long-term use.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic low back pain
Review question
We assessed the evidence regarding the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) among people with chronic low back
pain. NSAIDs were compared to placebo, other NSAIDs, other drugs or other kinds of treatment.
Background
Chronic low back pain is common and causes pain and disability. NSAIDs are often used to treat people with chronic low back pain
and are available both over-the-counter and on prescription in different types and chemical entities.
Study characteristics
We collected all published randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs until 24 June 2015. We included 13 trials
which compared NSAIDs with placebo, other NSAIDs, other drugs or other treatment in people with chronic low back pain. Six trials
compared NSAIDs with placebo, and included 1354 participants in total. Follow-up was between nine days and 16 weeks.
Key results
NSAIDs reduced pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain compared to placebo. However, the differences were small:
7 points on a 100-point scale for pain intensity. Regarding disability, people receiving NSAIDs scored 0.9 points better on a 0 to 24
disability scale. The number of adverse events was not significantly different between the people receiving NSAIDs and people receiving
placebo, but larger studies of longer duration would be needed to identify rare or delayed adverse events, important drug interactions
and adverse events occurring with prolonged use.

 Different types of NSAIDs did not show significantly different effects. Three of the 13 included studies compared two different types
of NSAIDs and none found any differences.
NSAIDs were also compared to other drug types: paracetamol, tramadol and pregabalin. There were no differences found between
NSAIDs and paracetamol and pregabalin in either effect or adverse events. A single study comparing celecoxib with tramadol showed
a better global improvement in peoples using celecoxib.
One trial compared NSAIDs with ’home-based exercise’. Regarding disability, people who did exercise improved more than people
receiving NSAIDs, but pain scores were not statistically different.
Quality of the evidence
There was low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective than placebo in chronic low back pain. The magnitude of the
difference was small, and when we only accounted for trials of higher quality, these differences reduced.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: we are very uncertain about the estimate.
1Allocation concealment was uncertain in most included trials, and randomization was uncertain in half of the included trials,
therefore selection bias is likely. Five out of six trials had high drop-out rates, so attrition bias is likely, one level downgrade.
2Two out of six trials allowed co-interventions. Two trials included a ’flare design’, one level downgrade.

 3See funnel plot: we could not detect publication bias, no downgrade.
4Allocation concealment was uncertain in most included trials. All four trials had high drop-out rates, so attrition bias is highly
likely, one level downgrade.
5One included trial allowed co-interventions. One trial included a ’flare design’, one level downgrade.
6Allocation concealment and randomization were uncertain in all included trials, therefore selection bias is likely. Two out of
three included trials had high drop-out rates, so attrition bias is likely, one level downgrade.
7Allocation concealment and randomization was uncertain in both trials, therefore selection bias is likely. Both trials had high
drop-out rates, so attrition bias is likely, one level downgrade.

Description of the condition
Low back pain is a major health problem and has a reported life-
time prevalence of up to 84% (Cassidy 1998; Walker 2000). More
than one quarter of North Americans have reported to have ex-
perienced low back pain within the previous three months (Deyo
2006) and low back pain is a leading cause of years lived with
disability (Vos 2012). In the first three months, a large proportion
of patients will recover, but most people still experience pain af-
ter one year (Itz 2013). Chronic low back pain is associated with
more disability and these people make a great demand on the
healthcare system (Webb 2003). Also, low back pain is the most
common type of pain in people experiencing any chronic pain
(Müller-Schwefe 2011a) and people with chronic low back pain
use healthcare more compared to people with acute low back pain
(Müller-Schwefe 2011b). For treatment, guidelines recommend
staying active and exercising, if necessary with the use of anal-
gesics. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one
of the most frequently used analgesics in low back pain manage-
ment (Gore 2012; Piccoliori 2013). People with acute low back
pain can receive NSAIDs for their pain, and short term NSAID
use is recommended for pain relief in people with chronic back
pain (Airaksinen 2006).
Description of the intervention
Most guidelines on treatment of low back pain recommend using
paracetamol as first choice, followed by NSAIDs if paracetamol is
insufficient (Koes 2010). NSAIDs are widely available in several
types and brands and both over-the-counter and on prescription.
NSAID treatment is based on the analgesic and anti-inflamma-
tory mechanisms of the drug, but is also associated with adverse
events, such as gastro-intestinal (Sostres 2013; Wehling 2014) and
cardiovascular events (Kearney 2006).
How the intervention might work
Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are
key enzymes in prostaglandin synthesis, which contribute to in-
flammation, pain and fever. NSAIDs inhibit the COX enzymes
and can therefore inhibit the production of prostaglandins. Con-
sequently this can reduce inflammation, pain and fever. COX-1
produces prostaglandins that also support platelets and protect the
stomach lining. It also helps to maintain kidney function. COX-
1 inhibition can raise the risk of renal insufficiency and gastro-
intestinal adverse events, such as gastritis or stomach bleeding.
There are two types of NSAIDs: non-selective NSAIDs, which
inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, and selective NSAIDs,
which inhibit only the COX-2 enzyme. Both selective and non-
selective NSAIDs are available for pain treatment, and the choice
of NSAID is mostly based on the different possible known adverse
events, convenience of use, and cost.
Non-selective or traditional NSAIDs have a higher risk compared
to selective NSAIDs regarding gastro-intestinal adverse events
(Sostres 2013) due to the inhibition of both COX enzymes.
However, aside from these gastro-intestinal benefits of selective
NSAIDs, there is a known cardiovascular risk from use of these
NSAID types. Cardiovascular risks are also present in non-selec-
tive NSAIDs and should be taken into account when prescribing
any NSAIDs (CNT Collaboration 2013; Trelle 2011).
Why it is important to do this review
This Cochrane review is one of a series of Cochrane reviews of
NSAIDs for people with low back pain and is an update of a
Cochrane review first published in 2008 (Roelofs 2008). The orig-
inal review consisted of 65 randomized controlled trials (RCTs);
for this update we decided to create a series of Cochrane reviews
regarding NSAID use for acute back pain, chronic back pain and
sciatica. Also, efficacy of treatment with NSAIDs can differ among
these different types of back pain. This Cochrane review focuses
on NSAIDs for treating people with chronic low back pain.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included double-blinded and single-blinded randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs). We only included English, German or Dutch
trials, as we had stated in the original Cochrane protocol.
Types of participants
We included participants aged 18 years or older, who were treated
for non-specific chronic low back pain. We defined chronic low
back pain as pain for at least 12 weeks. If the trial did not describe
the duration of back pain, but labeled back pain as chronic, we
included the trial. If a trial included mixed populations of acute,
sub-acute or chronic low back pain, we only included these trials if
7

 they presented chronic low back pain data separately. We excluded
participants with sciatica or with specific low back pain caused
by pathological entities, such as infection, neoplasm, metastasis,
osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis or fractures.
Types of interventions
We included RCTs that assessed one or more types of NSAIDs.
We permitted additional interventions if there was a contrast for
NSAIDsinthe trial.Forexample, we includedtrialsthatcompared
NSAIDs plus muscle relaxants versus muscle relaxants alone, but
excludedtrialsthatcomparedNSAIDsplusmuscle relaxantsversus
paracetamol.
We excluded trials that used NSAIDs which are no longer available
on the market, such as rofecoxib.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
Primary outcome measures were:
• pain intensity (e.g. visual analogue scale (VAS) or
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS))
• global measure (e.g. overall improvement, proportion of
participants that recover)
• back pain-specific functional status (e.g. Roland Disability
Questionnaire, Oswestry Scale)
• return to work (e.g. return to work status, number of days
off work)
• adverse events (proportion of participants experiencing
adverse events)
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcome measures were physiological outcomes (e.g.
range of motion, spinal flexibility, degrees of straight leg raising or
muscle strength) and generic functional status (e.g. Short Form 36
(SF-36), Nottingham Health Profile, Sickness Impact Profile). We
also considered other symptoms, such as health care consumption.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We identified RCTs for inclusion by searching the following
databases up to 24 June 2015:
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, Issue 5 of 12, May 2015)
• MEDLINE (OvidSP
, 1946 to June Week 2 2015)
• MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations
(OvidSP
, June 23, 2015)
• EMBASE (OvidSP
, 1980 to 2015 Week 25)
• ClinicalTrials.gov
• World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP)
• PubMed
For this update, we conducted the literature searches annually be-
tween May 2012 and 24 June 2015. We added the trial registers
(clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) in 2013, MEDLINE In-
Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations in 2014 and PubMed in
2015 to identify studies not in MEDLINE using the strategy rec-
ommended by Duffy 2014. We have presented the search strate-
gies in Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 3, Appendix 4 and
Appendix 5.
A research librarian from the Cochrane Back and Neck Review
Group devised and performed these searches according to the
guidelines of the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group (Furlan
2009).
Searching other resources
After the electronic search, we screened systematic reviews regard-
ing NSAIDs for chronic low back pain. We included articles that
we had included in the previous version of this Cochrane review
(Roelofs 2008).
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (BK and PR, or PR and WE) independently
screened all search results. We excluded clearly ineligible studies
based on title and abstract. We retrieved full-text articles of all
remaining studies and two review authors screened these articles
independently for inclusion. We resolved any disagreements re-
garding inclusion by consensus between the review authors.
Data extraction and management
One review author, WE, extracted the data, and a second review
author, PR, checked the extracted data. The review authors ex-
tracted data on type and dose of NSAIDs, type of reference treat-
ment, follow-up time, duration of current symptoms and the out-
comes described above. If data were unavailable for data extraction
due to use of a different format, we contacted the trial authors
for further information. We resolved any disagreements through
consensus between all review authors.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (WE and PR) independently evaluated the risk
of bias of all included trials, using the criteria list recommended by
8
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic low back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 the Cochrane Back Review Group (Furlan 2009) and described in
Appendix 6. We scored each of the criteria as either ’low’, ’high’
or ’unclear’ risk. If we scored the criteria as unclear, we did not
contact the trial authors for further information. We resolved any
disagreements by consensus and consulted a third review author
if disagreements persisted.
Measures of treatment effect
The primary outcome, pain intensity, is measured with the VAS
or NRS on a scale from 0 to 100 and 0 to 10 respectively. Global
improvement is measured by the proportion of participants that
recovered. Disability is measured on different disability scales, (e.g.
RolandMorrisDisabilityQuestionnaire (RDQ)ona0to24scale).
Adverse events are measured by the proportion of participants
experiencing any adverse event.
Dealing with missing data
We did not include data in this review that were not reported in
the article and that we considered missing. If trials showed data
in graphs instead of describing data in the text but were shown in
graphs, we collected data from the graphs.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed clinical heterogeneity for all included RCTs that re-
ported similar outcomes. We judged the included trials based on
setting, participants and intervention. If trials were clinically het-
erogeneous, we did not pool them. We assessed statistical hetero-
geneity using the Chi² test and I² statistic. If I² statistic values
were greater than 50%, substantial heterogeneity could be present
(Higgins 2011) and we pooled data using a random-effects model.
When we suspected no, low or moderate heterogeneity, we used a
fixed-effect model.
Assessment of reporting biases
We used funnel plots to investigate reporting bias when we in-
cluded at least four trials in a particular comparison.
Data synthesis
We analysed dichotomous outcomes by calculating the relative risk
(RR). We analysed continuous outcomes by calculating the mean
difference (MD) when the same instrument was used to measure
outcomes, or the standardized mean difference (SMD) when dif-
ferent instruments were used to measure the outcomes. We ex-
pressed uncertainty with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We
performed a meta-analysis if studies were clinically homogeneous
(comparable population, intervention and outcomes among tri-
als) using a fixed-effect model unless there was significant statisti-
cal heterogeneity, in which case we used a random-effects model.
We used the I² and chi² test to assess statistical heterogeneity as
suggested in the Cochrane handbook (Higgins 2011). If meta-
analysis was not possible, we described the results from clinically
comparable trials in the review text.
We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome
using the GRADE approach, as recommended in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011)
and adapted in the updated CBRG method guidelines (Furlan
2009). Five factors that may have decreased the quality of the ev-
idence were: study design and risk of bias, inconsistency of re-
sults, indirectness (not generalizable), imprecision (sparse data)
and other factors (e.g. reporting bias). We downgraded the quality
of the evidence for a specific outcome by one level according to
the performance of the studies against each of these five factors.
We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome
as:
• High quality evidence: there are consistent findings
among at least 75% of RCTs with low risk of bias, consistent,
direct and precise data and no known or suspected publication
biases. Further research is unlikely to change either the estimate
or our confidence in the results.
• Moderate quality evidence: one of the domains is not met.
Further research is likely to have an important impact on our
confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
• Low quality evidence: two of the domains are not met.
Further research is very likely to have an important impact on
our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change
the estimate.
• Very low quality evidence: three of the domains are not
met. We are very uncertain about the results.
• No evidence: we did not identify any RCTs that addressed
this outcome.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We performed subgroup analyses if both non-selective and selec-
tive NSAIDs were present. We split these results into non-selective
and selective NSAIDs.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis on the comparison between
NSAIDs and placebo. We excluded trials at high risk of bias (less
than six positive items on the ’Risk of bias’ table) or trials with a
’flare design’ from this analysis. A trial with a ’flare design’ only
includes participants who previously used NSAIDs and reported
aggravated back complaints during a washout period.

 Results of the search
We identified a total of 3437 potential articles in the updated elec-
tronic search (Figure 1). After screening the titles and abstracts,
we assessed full-text articles and included 13 trials. Amongst these
were seven of the nine articles on chronic low back pain from
Roelofs 2008. Two trials reported on rofecoxib, which was with-
drawn from the market, and we excluded these trials from this
review (Chrubasik 2003; Katz 2003).

 Included studies
The sample size of the 13 included trials ranged from 28 to 1593
participants, with a total of 4807 included participants. Six trials
compared NSAIDs versus placebo (Allegrini 2009; Berry 1982;
Birbara 2003; Coats 2004; Katz 2011; Kivitz 2013). Three tri-
als compared two different types of NSAIDs (Driessens 1994;
Videman 1984; Zerbini 2005). One trial compared NSAIDs ver-
sus paracetamol (Hickey 1982), one trial compared NSAIDs ver-
sus tramadol (O’Donnell 2009) and one trial compared NSAIDs
versus pregabalin (Romanò 2009). One trial compared exercise
therapy versus NSAIDs (Shirado 2010).
Excluded studies
We have described the reasons for exclusion of studies in the
’Characteristics of excluded studies’ table. We excluded most stud-
ies because it was unclear whether participants had chronic low
back pain.
Risk of bias in included studies
We have presented the ’Risk of bias’ assessment in Figure 2 and
Figure 3. Ten of the 13 studies were considered having a low risk
of bias. (Berry 1982; Birbara 2003; Coats 2004; Driessens 1994;
Hickey 1982; Katz 2011; Kivitz 2013; O’Donnell 2009; Shirado
2010; Zerbini 2005).

Allocation
Of the 13 included studies, six reported a randomization proce-
dure (Allegrini 2009; Birbara 2003; Coats 2004; Hickey 1982;
O’Donnell 2009; Shirado 2010). Of these six studies, only four
also adequately described concealment of treatment allocation
(Birbara 2003; Hickey 1982; O’Donnell 2009; Shirado 2010).
Most studies did not report the method of randomization or allo-
cation concealment and were scored as ’unclear’ on these items.
Blinding
Seven included trials reported blinding of patients, care providers
and outcome assessors (Berry 1982; Birbara 2003; Driessens 1994;
Hickey 1982; O’Donnell 2009; Videman 1984; Zerbini 2005).
The other six trials did not blind patients, care providers, or out-
come assessors or they did not report on blinding.
Incomplete outcome data
Six trials reported low drop out rates (Berry 1982; Hickey 1982;
Romanò 2009; Shirado 2010; Videman 1984; Zerbini 2005). The
seven other studies reported drop-out rates higher than 20% (
Allegrini 2009; Birbara 2003; Coats 2004; Driessens 1994; Katz
2011; Kivitz 2013; O’Donnell 2009).
Only three trials performed an intention to treat (ITT) analysis
(Coats 2004; Katz 2011; O’Donnell 2009).
Selective reporting
OnlytwoRCTswere registeredinanaccessible clinical trial registry
(Katz 2011; Kivitz 2013) and had low risk of reporting bias.
Other potential sources of bias
Most studies showed similarity of baseline characteristics; only
three RCTs did not report this (Allegrini 2009; Hickey 1982;
Videman 1984).
Regarding co-interventions, only paracetamol as rescue medica-
tion was allowed; other types of medication were not. All but two
trials avoided co-interventions (Berry 1982; Birbara 2003) and
one trial did not state anything about co-interventions (Shirado
2010).
Nine trials reported compliance, and five trials had acceptable
compliance (Allegrini 2009; Coats 2004; Katz 2011; Romanò
2009; Zerbini 2005). Four other trials had unacceptable com-
pliance (Berry 1982; Birbara 2003; Driessens 1994; O’Donnell
2009).

 Timing of outcome assessment was similar between the groups in
almost all included trials.
We created funnel plots to assess risk of publication bias and for
the analysis of NSAIDs versus placebo (Figure 4; Figure 5; Figure
6). We could not identify publication bias. We did not create any
funnel plots for other comparisons, since less than four RCTs were
available for this analysis.

Half of the included trials reported a potential conflict of interest.
Three studies reported support from a pharmaceutical company
(Birbara 2003; Hickey 1982; Zerbini 2005) and the authors of
four RCTs had affiliations with a pharmaceutical company (Coats
2004; Katz 2011; Kivitz 2013; O’Donnell 2009). The remaining
six RCTs did not report any potential conflict of interest.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison NSAIDs
for people with chronic low back pain
See: ’Summary of findings’ table 1.
Efficacy of NSAIDs compared to placebo
Six RCTs compared NSAIDs with placebo (Allegrini 2009; Berry
1982; Birbara 2003; Coats 2004; Katz2011; Kivitz2013). Median
follow-up was 56 days (IQR 13 to 91 days). Three of these trials
reportedshort-termoutcomesof fourweeksorless(Allegrini2009;
Berry 1982; Coats 2004). The other three trials had a duration
of follow-up of 12 or 16 weeks (Birbara 2003; Katz 2011; Kivitz
2013). Naproxen was the most common type of NSAID (Berry
1982; Katz 2011; Kivitz 2013), but piroxicam patch, etoricoxib
and valdecoxib were also compared to placebo.
All RCTs reported pain intensity on a 100 mm VAS or 11-point
numerical rating scale (NRS). The Chi² value for homogeneity
of the mean difference (MD) was 10.41 (P 0.06) and I² statis-
tic 52%, which suggests substantial statistical heterogeneity. This
might be due to different types of NSAIDs used in the trials and
we used a random-effects model to pool these data. The pooled
mean difference in pain intensity score from baseline was −6.97
(95% CI −10.74 to −3.19; Analysis 1.1), indicating a statisti-
cally significant effect in favour of participants receiving NSAIDs
compared to participants receiving placebo. The quality of this
evidence was low (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
When we split results into selective and non-selective NSAIDs
versus placebo, there was still a substantial statistical heterogene-
ity among the trials considering non-selective NSAIDs, although
three out of four RCTs used naproxen as trial medication. There
was statistical homogeneity among the trials on selective NSAIDs.
The effect of selective NSAIDs was somewhat larger and the effect
of non-selective NSAIDs was smaller.

 Four RCTs compared NSAIDs with placebo, with disability as
outcome measure, measured with the Roland Morris Disability
Questionnaire (RDQ) (Birbara 2003; Coats 2004; Katz 2011;
Kivitz 2013) on a 0 to 24 scale. Median follow-up was 84 days
(IQR 42 to 105 days). The Chi² value for homogeneity of the
mean difference (MD) was 5.53 (P = 0.14) and the I² statistic was
46%, indicating moderate statistical heterogeneity among these
trials. The pooled mean difference in disability from baseline was
−0.85 (95% CI −1.30 to −0.40; Analysis 1.2). The quality of
this evidence was low (’Summary of findings’ table 1).
All trials also reported adverse events. The Chi² value for homo-
geneity of the RR for adverse events in all RCTs was 6.22 (P =
0.28) and the I² statistic value was 20%, indicating no statistical
heterogeneity among the RCTs. The pooled RR for adverse events
was 1.04 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.17; Analysis 1.3), indicating that ad-
verse events were not statistically significant more present in par-
ticipants using NSAIDs compared to placebo. Using the GRADE
approach, we assessed the quality of evidence of these trials as
low (’Summary of findings’ table 1). Results did not change when
we specified NSAIDs into selective and non-selective NSAIDs,
although adverse events in selective NSAIDs showed a trend in
favour of placebo. However, RCTs have low power in detecting
uncommon and delayed adverse events. The sample sizes of most
included trials were relatively small and duration of follow-up
was relatively short. It is possible that not all adverse events had
emerged, especially since most important adverse events are rare
and can take weeks or months to present. Therefore, we cannot
make firm statements about the difference in occurrence of adverse
events between different NSAID types.
Of the trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo, we considered
three trials at high risk of bias (Allegrini 2009; Birbara 2003; Coats
2004). The latter two trials used a ’flare design’. We performed a
sensitivity analysis using the three RCTs which were at low risk of
bias (Berry 1982; Katz2011; Kivitz 2013). The difference between
NSAIDs and placebo on pain intensity score (on 0 to 100 mm
VAS) and the disability (measured with RDQ 0 to 24) became
smaller and was no longer statistically significant; the difference
in pain intensity score between NSAIDs and placebo was −5.03
(95% CI −10.37 to 0.32; Analysis 1.4) and for disability was
−0.41 (95% CI −1.04 to 0.23; Analysis 1.5). We assessed the
quality of evidence as moderate (’Summary of findings’ table 1).
Efficacy of selective versus non-selective NSAIDs and
non-selective versus non-selective NSAIDs
Two small RCTs compared two types of non-selective NSAIDs
(Driessens 1994; Videman 1984). Driessens 1994 compared
ibuprofen (1600 mg/day) and diclofenac (100 mg/day) for two
weeks, Videman 1984 compared piroxicam (20 mg/day) and in-
domethacin (75 mg/day) for six weeks. Both trials found no signif-
icant difference between the two types of non-selective NSAIDs.
The number of adverse events in Driessens 1994 was statistically
significant higher in the diclofenac group. In Videman 1984 there
was no statistically significant difference in experienced adverse
events between the two trial groups. One other RCT, Zerbini
2005, compared a non-selective NSAID with a COX-2 inhibitor
(diclofenac 150 mg/day versus etoricoxib 60 mg/day for four
weeks). This trial included 440 participants in the analysis and
found no significant difference in change in pain intensity from
baseline between the non-selective NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitor.
The trial also did not find any differences in adverse events in gen-
eral and specific gastrointestinal adverse events between the two
trial groups.
Efficacy of NSAIDs versus other drugs
NSAIDs compared to other drug types are shown in Analysis
2.1 and Analysis 2.2. We did not pool these RCTs because the
trials used different types of medication as comparison. Hickey
1982, which had with 30 participants, compared NSAIDs (diflu-
nisal 1000 mg/day) with paracetamol (4000 mg/day). In this trial,
NSAIDs were not significantly better than paracetamol and ad-
verse events were not significantly more present in patients using
NSAIDs compared to the other studied drugs.
O’Donnell 2009 included 1593 participants and compared
NSAIDs (celecoxib 400 mg/day) with tramadol (200 mg/day) for
six weeks. Results of global improvement (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.16
to 1.38) and adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.91) after
six weeks both favoured celecoxib.
Romanò 2009 compared celecoxib with pregabalin and scored
change in pain intensity from baseline to four weeks on a VAS
score. There was no significant difference between the two trial
groupsandadverse eventswere similarinnumberinboth celecoxib
and pregabalin trial groups.
Efficacy of NSAIDs versus non-drug treatment
One RCT, Shirado 2010, compared NSAIDs with ’home-based
exercise’. Improvement in functional status between baseline and
eight weeks was significantly better in exercise participants then
participants receiving NSAIDs, but there was no difference in pain
intensity.

Summary of main results
In this Cochrane review we included 13 RCTs that assessed
NSAID efficacy for the management of chronic low back pain.
Six trials comparing NSAIDs with placebo showed low quality ev-
idence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo, with a mean
difference in pain intensity score from baseline of -6.97 (95% CI
17

 −10.74 to −3.19) on a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale (VAS) with
a median follow-up of 56 days (IQR 13 to 91 days). There is also
low quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo
on disability, with a mean difference from baseline of −0.85 (95%
CI −1.30 to −0.40) on a scale from 0 to 24 with a median follow-
up of 84 days (IQR 42 to 105 days). When only trials with low
risk of bias were included in the analysis, the difference between
NSAIDs and placebo was no longer significant. Adverse events
were not significantly more present in the NSAIDs or placebo trial
group, but this could be because we only included RCTs in this
review, or the short duration of use and the short follow-up period
in most included trials.
Studies comparing non-selective versus selective NSAIDs or com-
paring different types of non-selective NSAIDs were also limited
available. All three included RCTs showed no significant effect
between the different NSAID types.
Whether NSAIDs are more effective than other drugs or non-
drug therapies for people with chronic low back pain remains
unclear. A limited number of trials compared NSAIDs versus other
drug treatments and all trials included different kind of drugs
as comparator. One large RCT compared celecoxib to tramadol.
Results of global improvement and adverse events were both in
favour of celecoxib after six weeks.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
In this Cochrane review we used strict inclusion criteria regarding
the duration of back pain, meaning that we only included trials
that reported results on people with chronic low back pain. This
means that fewer trials met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane
review, but it makes the review results more distinct for people
with non-specific chronic low back pain.
Two included trials used a ’flare design’. These trials included par-
ticipants who responded well to NSAIDs when they showed a
worsening in back pain during a wash-out period. As these partic-
ipants already responded well to NSAIDs, these trials are likely to
have overestimated the effect of NSAIDs. It may also reduce the
external validity since this is a select group of participants. When
we excluded these RCTs from the analysis together with one other
trial with a high risk of bias, the results changed. The magnitude
of effect of NSAIDs became smaller and the difference was not
statistically significant anymore.
Some included trials operationalized outcomes differently and not
all trials included disability as outcome. None of the included trials
mentioned return to work or other work outcomes, although this
might be an important outcome in patients with chronic low back
pain.
Almost all included RCTs mentioned adverse events. Most trials
reported the overall number of adverse events, and some trials also
mentioned specific gastrointestinal adverse events. Cardiovascular
adverse events are rarely mentioned. However, these trials were
powered to investigate treatment effects of the primary outcomes.
As most important adverse events are rare and can take weeks or
months to evolve, it is likely that sample sizes of these trials were
toosmall andfollow-upperiodstooshortto draw clearconclusions
from these trials regarding the risks for gastrointestinal and other
adverse events of NSAIDs.
Quality of the evidence
Three included RCTs were considered high risk of bias. Even in the
10 other RCTs with low risk of bias other methodological short-
comings were present, such as no clear description of the random-
ization procedure, high drop-out rates and low or unclear com-
pliance in the trial groups. Uncertain or low compliance makes it
difficult to interpret the measured effect in the study and can both
under- and overestimate the results found. The level of evidence,
which we assessed using the GRADE approach, was low due to
similar issues. The most common reasons for downgrading evi-
dence were ’risk of bias’ and ’imprecision’ for the included trials.
Most trials had a follow-up period of at least four weeks, and only
three trials had follow-up periods of less than four weeks (ranging
from nine days to two weeks). NSAIDs are usually used for a
short period of time. This short follow up period might not have
consequences on our results, since effects are expected shortly after
the start of the NSAIDs. Although it is difficult due to this short
follow-up period to assess adverse events.
Included RCTs had different trial population sizes; four trials in-
cluded less than 50 participants and may lack statistical power to
detect differences in effects. Pooling may overcome this problem.
However, the most important question is whetherthe effect is clin-
ically relevant. The main finding that NSAIDs are more effective
than placebo on pain intensity was based on a meta-analysis that
showed a mean difference of 3.30 on a 0 to 100 scale. Although
statistically significant, one could argue that this effect is too small
to be clinically relevant.
A sensitivity analysis with a moderate quality of evidence showed
that the positive effect of NSAIDs compared to placebo was re-
duced and no longer statistically significant when we only included
RCTs in the analysis that were of low risk of bias.
Potential biases in the review process
We only included trials published in English, German or Dutch,
which could have led to the exclusion of trials published in other
languages from this Cochrane review. Reports on language bias
show conflicting results (Higgins 2011; Jüni 2002; Moher 2003).
It is not to be expected that inclusion of articles written in other
languages will change the results in this review, especially since
there seems to be a shift in publishing more articles in English and
less frequent in other languages (Galandi 2006; Higgins 2011).

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic low back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Only one review author extracted data and the second review au-
thor checked the extracted data. This could have led to a higher
risk of error in data extraction.
Different types and chemical entities of NSAIDs are available,
which makes it difficult to compare different NSAIDs. Regard-
ing the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo, we included both
selective and non-selective NSAIDs. An analysis of two separate
comparisons showed no differences in directions of the findings
when we compared selective and non-selective NSAIDs separately
with placebo.
Publication bias may have occurred, but this was difficult to as-
sess due to the limited number of included trials. In particular the
comparisons of different NSAID types or NSAIDs compared to
other types of drugs we could not examine publication bias using
a funnel plot. Half of the included trials were supported by or
included authors from pharmaceutical companies. Clinical trials
sponsored by pharmaceutical companies are less likely to be pub-
lished and are more likely to have outcomes in favour of the spon-
sor (Lexchin 2003), which could have caused publication bias.
Even when publication bias would have occurred, this will not
change the found results. The found effect is already very small
and not clinically relevant.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
In the previous version of this Cochrane review, Roelofs 2008,
we studied NSAIDs for people with sciatica, acute and chronic
low back pain based on literature published from September 1998
to June 2007. These trials found a change in pain intensity in
favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo. In this review update
we found similar results, but the magnitude of the results in our
review was smaller than found in Roelofs 2008. Adverse events
were statistically more present in the NSAID group in Roelofs
2008, but we did not find a statistically significant difference in
our review. Most trials included in this Cochrane review had a
small sample size or short-time follow-up, or both, and were not
suited to evaluate adverse events. A large meta-analysis on adverse
events in RCTs (CNT Collaboration 2013) and observational data
(Castellsague 2012) showed that adverse events are more present
in participants using NSAIDs compared to placebo.
After 2008, several systematic reviews were published regarding
NSAIDs as a therapeutic option in treating people with chronic
low back pain. Pain scores between NSAIDs and placebo were
often reported. In 2013, a review on NSAIDs showed that COX-
2 selective NSAIDs were significantly more effective in reducing
VAS score and disability measured with RDQ (Chung 2013). Four
studies were included in Chung’s analysis, of which we did not
include two in this Cochrane review. We excluded one trial, Pallay
2004, from the previous version of this review because it is ad-
ditional information to an earlier reported study that was already
included in the review (Birbara 2003). Including both would lead
to double counting. The other study, Katz 2003, reported on ro-
fecoxib and was excluded from this review because it was with-
drawn from the market. Kuijpers 2011 found similar results to
Chung 2013 and concluded that there is low quality evidence that
NSAIDs are more effective than placebo. This is comparable to
findings in this Cochrane review. Chung 2013 also assessed dis-
ability and results were comparable to our findings..
Chung 2013 also evaluated selective and non-selective NSAIDs
and found no differences in efficacy between these two groups.
Two studies were analysed in the review; one of those was also
examined in this review and found the same results. We excluded
the other study used in Chung 2013 from this Cochrane review
because it included rofecoxib.

Implications for practice
For people with chronic low back pain there is low quality evidence
that NSAIDs are slightly better in reducing pain and disability
than placebo, but the effect is very small and possibly not clinically
relevant. The low risk of bias studies showed no significant differ-
ence between NSAIDs and placebo. It is unclear whether NSAIDs
are more effective than other drugs and there is no evidence to
show that one NSAID type is more effective than other types.
Implications for research
The quality of evidence for NSAIDs compared to placebo in peo-
ple with chronic low back pain is, at best, moderate. When stud-
ies are of higher quality, effects of NSAIDs become smaller or
disappear. It is questionable whether or not additional research
will change these findings and the estimate of effect. Especially
since the observed differences in this study between NSAIDs and
placebo are small and possibly not clinically relevant. In studies
with flare designs,some participantsrespondtoNSAIDtreatment.
Therefore, it might be worthwhile to look into subgroups finding
participants who are likely to respond well to NSAIDs.

Appendix 6. Criteria for assessing risk of bias for internal validity
Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomized sequence
There is a low risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring
to a random number table, using a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice,
drawing of lots, minimization (minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent
to being random).
There is a high risk of selection bias if the investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process, such
as: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of admission, hospital or clinic record number; or allocation by
judgement of the clinician, preference of the participant, results of a laboratory test or a series of tests, or availability of the intervention.
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment
There is a low risk of selection bias if the participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because
investigators used one of the following, or an equivalent method, to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone,
65
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic low back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 internet-based and pharmacy-controlled randomization); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially
numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.
There is a high risk of bias if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce
selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment
envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered);
alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures.
Blinding of participants
Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants during the study
There is a low risk of performance bias if trial investigators ensured blinding of participants and it was unlikely that the blinding could
have been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is unlikely to be
influenced by lack of blinding.
Blinding of personnel/care providers (performance bias)
Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by personnel/care providers during the trial
There is a low risk of performance bias if trial investigators ensured blinding of personnel and it was unlikely that blinding could have
been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be
influenced by lack of blinding.
Blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias)
Detection bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors
There is low risk of detection bias if trial investigators ensured the blinding of the outcome assessment and it was unlikely that blinding
could have been broken; or if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely
to be influenced by lack of blinding, or:
• for patient-reported outcomes in which the patient was the outcome assessor (e.g. pain, disability): there is a low risk of bias for
outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for participant blinding (Boutron 2005)
• for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care
providers (e.g. co-interventions, length of hospitalisation, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor: there
is a low risk of bias for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for care providers (Boutron 2005)
• for outcome criteria that are assessed from data from medical forms: there is a low risk of bias if the treatment or adverse effects
of the treatment could not be noticed in the extracted data (Boutron 2005).
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
Attrition bias due to amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data
There is a low risk of attrition bias if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related
to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data were balanced in numbers,
with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared
with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous
outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not
enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size, or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods (if drop-
outs are very large, imputation using even “acceptable” methods may still suggest a high risk of bias) (van Tulder 2003). The percentage
66
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic low back pain (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 of withdrawals and drop-outs should not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead
to substantial bias (these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary, not supported by literature) (van Tulder 2003).
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting
There is low risk of reporting bias if the study protocol is available and all of the study’s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes
that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way, or if the study protocol is unavailable but it is clear that
the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be
uncommon).
There is a high risk of reporting bias if not all of the study’s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary
outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or
more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected
adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-
analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.
Group similarity at baseline (selection bias)
Bias due to dissimilarity at baseline for the most important prognostic indicators.
There is low risk of bias if groups are similar at baseline for demographic factors, value of main outcome measure(s), and important
prognostic factors (examples in the field of back and neck pain are duration and severity of complaints, vocational status, percentage
of patients with neurological symptoms) (van Tulder 2003).
Co-interventions (performance bias)
Bias because co-interventions were different across groups
There is low risk of bias if there were no co-interventions or they were similar between the index and control groups (van Tulder 2003).
Compliance (performance bias)
Bias due to inappropriate compliance with interventions across groups
There is low risk of bias if compliance with the interventions was acceptable, based on the reported intensity/dosage, duration, number
and frequency for both the index and control intervention(s). For single-session interventions (e.g. surgery), this item is irrelevant (van
Tulder 2003).
Intention-to-treat-analysis
There is low risk of bias if all randomized patients were reported/analysed in the group to which they were allocated by randomization.
Timing of outcome assessments (detection bias)
Bias because important outcomes were not measured at the same time across groups
There is low risk of bias if all important outcome assessments for all intervention groups were measured at the same time (van Tulder
2003).

 Other bias
Bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table
There is a low risk of bias if the study appears to be free of other sources of bias not addressed elsewhere (e.g. study funding).
