Abstract
Background and Aims—Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have significant variability 
in size and malignant behavior. Our current understanding is limited to pathological analyses, 
autopsy studies, and small case series. The aim of the current study is to define the risk factors, 
incidence, and mortality rates of GIST <2 cm in the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results database.
Methods—Patients with histologically confirmed malignant GIST <2 cm were studied from 
2001 to 2011. GIST was defined by GI tumor site codes and GIST-specific histology codes.
Results—We identified 378 patients with GIST <2 cm. The average age at diagnosis was 64.0 
years with equal sex distribution. The most common tumor location was the stomach (62.2 %), 
followed by the small intestine (23.3 %), colon (5.6 %), and rectum (3.4 %). Most patients had 
localized disease (79.4 %), but 11.4 % had regional/distant metastatic disease. The annual 
incidence rate was 4.2 per 10,000,000 (10M). This was the highest among Blacks (7.6 per 10M). 
Among patients with GIST and no additional cancers, the 5-year GIST-specific mortality was 
12.9 %. Moreover, there was a significantly increased 5-year GIST-specific mortality in those

patients with localized GIST (5.6 %).
Conclusions—This study represents the first population-based analysis of malignant GIST <2 
cm. While quite rare, these tumors have an underappreciated disease-specific mortality. Further 
studies are needed to define the underlying reasons for the identified racial differences, to develop 
novel risk assessment schema for patients with these small tumors, and to determine appropriate 
indications for resection and/or medical therapy.

Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) represents the most common sarcoma of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These tumors are thought to arise from the pacemaker cells of the 
gut known as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC).1–3 In 1998, Hirota and colleagues reported 
that GIST was initiated by gain-of-function mutations in KIT (c-KIT, CD117) with 
associated KIT-positive immunostaining.1 This provided an objective measure to diagnose 
GIST and led to the implementation of a GIST-specific histology code in 2001. This 
improved the validity and precision of GIST coding and reporting. Recently, our group 
defined the epidemiology of GIST of all sizes in the USA through analysis of the National 
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database using this 
histological code.4 The annual age-adjusted incidence averaged 6.8 per 1,000,000, and GIST 
was more common in males, non-Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians/Pacific Islanders.4
Despite our epidemiological analysis, it is increasingly evident that GIST is not one 
homogeneous malignancy; there is significant variability in terms of size and malignant 
behavior. The disease spectrum ranges from “small GIST” to massive intra-abdominal 
tumors. GISTs less than 2 cm have been referred to by a multitude of names, including ICC 
hyperplasia, minute GIST, GIST tumorlets, micro-GIST, and small GIST.5,6 Given their 
small size, patients are often asymptomatic and tumors are typically discovered incidentally 
during endoscopic procedures by gastroenterologists or during cross-sectional radiologic 
studies.7–10 It has been reported that up to 30 % of people have small GIST.11–14 However, 
this data comes from autopsy studies and retrospective pathological series, making it limited 
by several biases.11–15 Other studies have examined the biology of these tumors and 
demonstrated that GISTs <2 cm have a lower frequency of KIT mutations than larger GIST, 
and they tend to exhibit lower mitotic rates.12,13,15 Because our current understanding is 
limited to pathological analyses, autopsy studies, and case series with small sample sizes, we 
lack a clear understanding of the clinical significance of small GIST. In fact, the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Society of Medical Oncology 
(ESMO) guidelines for the surveillance and management of GIST <2 cm have been deemed 
controversial or lack evidence-based approaches.8 Furthermore, little is known about the 
epidemiology, risk factors, and natural history of these smaller tumors.4,16 Therefore, the 
aim of the current study is to define the risk factors, incidence, and mortality rate of GIST 
<2 cm in the National Cancer Institute’s SEER database.

 Materials and Methods
Using the SEER database,17 we identified patients with histologically confirmed GIST <2 
cm diagnosed between 2001 and 2011. The SEER database consists of 18 regional cancer 
registries across the USA, which covers approximately 28 % of the US population. GIST 
was defined by GI tumor site codes (C150–C189, C199, C209–C212, C218, C220–C221, 
C239–C260, C268–C269, C480–C482, C488) and the GIST-specific histology code (ICD-
O-3 code 8936); only patients with tissue sampled by biopsy or surgical resection were 
eligible for inclusion in this study. GIST <1 cm and GIST 1–1.99 cm were defined by 
EOD-10 tumor size codes for 2001–2003 and CS tumor size codes for 2004–2011. Follow-
up extended through December 2011. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 10,000, 000 (10M) 
subjects were based on 5-year age categories defined with the 2000 US standard population 
used as the denominator.18 The Tiwari method was used to calculate 95 % confidence 
intervals (CI) for incidence rates.19 Cancer-specific survival was determined using 
cumulative incidence analysis, with death from noncancer causes as a competing risk. 
Overall survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and comparisons were made 
using the log-rank test. In these analyses, patients were censored at death or date of last 
known follow-up. A multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for potential 
confounders when exploring the impact of the presence of additional cancers on survival. 
This included age as a continuous variable, as well as sex, race, and stage. Associations were 
considered statistically significant if the 95 % CI excluded the null value. Incidence rates 
were calculated with SEER-Stat (version 8.1.5, Calverton, MD), and multivariable analyses 
were conducted with SAS (version 9.4, Cary, NC) using Cox proportional hazard regression. 
Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence analyses were performed in R version 3.2.2. The 
Institutional Review Board of University of California, San Diego, deems studies of this 
nature exempt from review.
Results
Demographics
We identified 378 patients diagnosed with malignant GIST <2 cm between 2001 and 2011 
within the SEER database. Table 1 shows the incidence rates for GIST <2 cm stratified by 
demographic and GIST-specific factors. The annual incidence rate was 4.2 per 10,000,000 
(10M) (95 % CI 3.8–4.6). The average age (± standard deviation) at diagnosis was 64.0 
± 12.8 years. The distribution was nearly equal between the sexes (male 48.9 %; female 
51.1 %). However, the incidence was highest among Blacks (7.6 per 10M, 95 % CI 5.8–9.7) 
and Asians/Pacific Islanders (4.6 per 10M, 95 % CI 3.2–6.3) as compared to Caucasians (3.7 
per 10M, 95 % CI 3.3–4.2). The stomach was the most common tumor site (62.2 %) 
followed by the small intestine (23.3 %), colon (5.6 %), and rectum (3.4 %). Overall, 79.4 % 
of patients presented with localized disease, while 11.4 % had regional or distant metastatic 
disease. The remaining 9.2 % of patients had missing or unknown stage data. The majority 
of patients underwent surgical excision as part of their first course of treatment (322/375, 
85.9 %). Of the remaining patients, 1 patient declined an operation (1/375, 0.27 %) while 52 
patients only had biopsies, but no operation was recommended (52/375, 13.9 %). Three 
patients were excluded due to missing data.

 Demographics of the GIST Subsets
On subset analyses, we identified 138 patients with GIST <1 cm and 240 patients with GIST 
1–1.99 cm. Supplemental Table 1 shows the incidence rates for the groups stratified by 
demographic and GIST-specific factors. For GIST <1 cm, the annual incidence rate was 1.5 
per 10M (95 % CI 1.2–1.8), while for GIST 1–1.99 cm, the annual incidence rate was 2.7 
per 10M (95 % CI 2.3–3.0). The average age (± standard deviation) at presentation was 62.3 
± 12.2 and 65.0± 13.0 years for GIST <1 cm and GIST 1–1.99 cm, respectively. 
Supplemental Fig. 1 shows the age-adjusted incidence of GIST <1 cm and GIST 1–1.99 cm 
stratified by age. The annual incidence increased with age for both subsets, from 0 per 10M 
(95 % CI 0–0.1) for those under age 20 years old in both subsets to 3.4 per 10M (95 % CI 
1.6–6.2; GIST <1 cm) and 10.8 per 10M (95 % CI 7.4–15.2; GIST 1–1.99 cm) for those 
above 80 years old. The peak age range for GIST <1 cm was 60–69 years old with an 
incidence of 7.5 per 10M (95 % CI 5.6–9.8). The peak age range for GIST 1–1.99 cm was 
70–79 years old with an incidence of 14.7 per 10M (95 % CI 11.4–18.6). The distribution 
was nearly equal between the sexes in the GIST <1-cm group (male 48.6 %; female 51.4 %) 
and the GIST 1–1.99-cm group (male 50.8 %; female 49.2 %). The incidence was also 
highest among Blacks with 2.5 per 10M (95 % CI 1.6–3.8; GIST <1 cm) and 5.1 per 10M 
(95 % CI 3.6–6.9; GIST 1–1.99 cm). Similar to GIST of all sizes, the stomach was the most 
common site of disease in both groups (64.5 and 60.8 %, respectively). Finally, most patients 
presented with localized disease in the two groups (81.9 and 77.9 %, respectively).
Analyses of Demographic Risk Factors
We next looked for risk factors for developing GIST among the entire cohort of GIST <2 cm 
and the two GIST subsets, namely GIST <1 cm and GIST 1–1.99 cm (Supplemental Table 
2). As compared to Whites (reference group) in the entire cohort and the two GIST subsets, 
Blacks were 2.1, 1.8, and 2.2 times more likely to develop GIST, respectively. No other 
racial group was at higher or lower risk as compared to Whites. Moreover, the sex 
distribution was essentially equal in all groups. Finally, in distinction from the entire cohort 
and GIST <1-cm subset, GIST 1–1.99 cm was 1.8 times more likely to occur in non-
Hispanics compared to Hispanics.
Overall and Cancer-Specific Mortality Analyses
We performed mortality analyses on a subset of our cohort that had no missing data (N = 
375). The 5-year overall mortality was 30.9 % for all patients with GIST <2 cm. There was 
no significant difference in 5-year mortality between those with tumors <1 cm (23.3 %) and 
those with tumors 1–1.99 cm (33.8 %) (P = 0.322) (Fig. 1a). Given these high mortality rates 
and our recent publication describing higher incidences of additional cancers in GIST 
patients, we queried whether the presence of additional cancers may explain this unexpected 
finding.20 Kaplan-Meier analysis, stratified by the presence of additional cancers, 
demonstrated a significant difference in overall mortality between these groups, with a 5-
year mortality of 20.0 % in those with GIST only and 33.8 % in those with GIST and 
additional cancers (P = 0.001) (Fig. 1b). On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, 
race, sex, and stage, we found that the presence of additional cancers was associated with 
increased risk of death (HR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.14, 2.90, P = 0.012) (Supplemental Table 3).

 Black race and advanced stage (i.e., regional and distant disease) were also associated with 
increase risk of death in this analysis (Supplemental Table 3). Subset Kaplan-Meier analysis 
of patients with known stage data (N = 340) demonstrated a mortality increase in those 
patients who had distant disease, as compared with localized or regional disease [5-year 
mortality—51.3, 26.6, and 26.5 %, respectively (P = 0.004)] (Fig. 1c). Similar analysis 
demonstrated significantly increased overall mortality among patients who did not undergo 
surgical excision of their GIST compared to those who did, with 5-year overall mortality of 
54.5 and 27.15 %, respectively (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1d).
We then performed cumulative incidence analyses investigating cancer-specific mortality, 
taking death from any other causes into account as a competing risk. There was no 
significant difference in cancer-specific mortality between those with GIST <1 cm or those 
with tumors 1–1.99 cm (P = 0.57) (Fig. 2a). However, there was a significantly increased 
risk of death from cancer among patients who had additional cancers (5-year cancer-specific 
mortality 28.9 %) as compared to those who only had GIST (5-year cancer-specific 
mortality 12.9 %) (P = 0.005) (Fig. 2b). Analyses of patients with known GIST stage data 
(N = 340) demonstrated that the all-cause cancer-specific mortality increases in those 
patients who had metastatic GIST, as compared with localized GIST or regionally advanced 
GIST [5-year cancer-specific mortality—36.5, 15.2, and 31.4 %, respectively (P = 0.001)] 
(Fig. 2c). Similar analysis demonstrated significantly increased cancer-specific mortality 
among patients who did not undergo surgical excision of their GIST compared to those who 
did, with 5-year cancer-specific mortality of 39.8 and 17.5 %, respectively (P = 0.007) (Fig. 
2d).
Finally, among GIST-only patients with tumors <2 cm and known stage (N = 204), there was 
a significantly increased 5-year GIST-specific mortality in patients who had regionally 
advanced GIST (34.0 %) or metastatic GIST (34.3 %), as compared to those patients with 
localized GIST (5.6 %) (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3a). Among patients who presented with regional 
disease, the stomach was the most common primary tumor site (7/15, 46.7 %), followed by 
the small intestine (6/15, 40.0 %) and colon or rectum (2/15, 13.3 %). Similarly, among 
patients who presented with distant disease, the stomach was again the most common 
primary tumor site (8/13, 61.5 %), followed by the small intestine (5/13, 38.5 %). Additional 
demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are included in Supplemental 
Table 4. Analysis of GIST-only patients demonstrated no significant difference in GIST-
specific mortality between patients who underwent surgical resection and those who did not 
(5-year GIST-specific mortality of 10.9 and 27.9 %, respectively, P = 0.13) (Fig. 3b).
Discussion
Building upon our group’s previous report on the epidemiology of GIST, this study 
represents the first population-based assessment that specifically focuses upon malignant 
GIST <2 cm. It demonstrates that patients with these tumors have demographic differences 
from patients with GIST of any size and these tumors occur most frequently in Blacks and 
can arise throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, while quite rare, these malignant 
tumors can lead to death for 1 in 7.8 patients at 5 years. Taken together, we provide a

 description and statistical examination of GIST <2 cm in the current era of 
immunohistochemical diagnoses of malignant GIST.
Until now, the epidemiology of GIST <2 cm was poorly understood, because prior studies 
were limited to pathological analyses, autopsy studies, and case series with small sample 
sizes.11–15 These studies commonly focused upon one region of the GI tract and thus 
provided an incomplete description of the true incidence and distribution of GIST <2 cm. 
Agaimy et al. estimated that 20–30 % of older adults have GIST <2 cm based upon autopsy 
cases and surgical pathology analyses.12 However, this study was limited by several biases, 
namely (1) it only included gastric GIST cases, (2) it was derived from a single institution, 
and (3) it analyzed two subsets of patients known to be at higher risk for GIST (i.e., older 
patients4 and patients undergoing surgery for other diseases or tumors20). Additionally, Chan 
et al. studied the prevalence of concurrent small GIST in 207 patients undergoing 
esophagectomy or gastrectomy. They found that 87 % of the 15 small GISTs discovered 
were located in the stomach.14 Again, this study only assessed the upper GI tract and was 
limited to patients undergoing surgery for other diseases or tumors. We now report that the 
average annual incidence of malignant GIST <2 cm in the USA is 4.2 per 10M. GIST <1 cm 
and GIST 1–1.99 cm represent 2.2 and 4.0 % of all GIST diagnoses, which have an overall 
incidence of 68 per 10M (i.e., 0.68 per 100, 000). Thus, our population-based findings 
provide a more complete understanding of the current incidence of malignant GIST <2 cm 
throughout the GI tract.
The 5-year overall mortality rate for GIST <2 cm was 30.9 %, which is comparable to the 
mortality rate of 35 % for GIST of all sizes.4 Given this high mortality rate and our previous 
findings demonstrating a higher incidence of additional cancers among patients with 
GIST,20 we excluded patients with additional cancer diagnoses from our analyses. This 
revealed that the 5-year GIST-specific mortality rate was 12.9 %. Patients who underwent 
resection of their small GIST appeared to have increased overall and cancer-specific 
survival, although in a subset analysis of GIST-only patients, this trend failed to meet 
significance criteria. This finding must be interpreted with caution, however, given our 
inability to control for confounders such as frailty or comorbid conditions that may have 
precluded the patient from undergoing an operation and increased their risk of death. 
Consistent with the underappreciated aggressive biology noted, 11 % of patients with GIST 
<2 cm had regional or distant metastases. While previous data indicates that primary GIST 
of the colon and/or rectum put patients at higher risk of aggressive disease,21 our findings 
show that primary tumors of the stomach or small intestine are associated with the 
development of regional or metastatic disease. While our study is limited by small numbers 
of patients with regional or distant disease, this information regarding primary site should 
not be overlooked.
It is important to understand this mortality rate in the context of the tumors studied; this 
study does not include undiagnosed or asymptomatic tumors. Therefore, the described rates 
are specific to small GISTs that are coded as malignant and have been histologically 
evaluated following biopsy or resection. Thus, our findings likely overestimate the GIST-
specific mortality of all small GISTs. However, clearly, a subset of small GIST with 
regionally advanced and/or metastatic disease has an aggressive phenotype with 1 in 2.9

 patients dying of the disease at 5 years. Furthermore, 1 in 17.9 with small, localized GIST 
will also die of the disease at 5 years. The latter finding remains quite concerning as current 
NCCN guidelines provide a category 2B recommendation (i.e., nonuniform NCCN 
consensus) for the management of GIST <2 cm, and these are deemed controversial due to 
limited data on the subject. These current recommendations include surgical removal of 
symptomatic tumors versus close surveillance of low-risk tumors. However, given the high 
GIST-specific mortality rate that we identified in this population-based analysis, further 
studies are warranted to understand the natural history and malignant potential of these small 
GISTs.
We also compared patient demographics in this study population to those of all GIST 
patients. We found that GISTs <2 cm are equally distributed between the sexes, which 
differs from our analysis of patients with GIST of any size, in which GISTs were more 
common in males.4 Therefore, an unacknowledged biologic relationship may exist between 
GIST size and sex. Consistent with this hypothesis, Call et al. found that among pediatric 
GIST cases, patients were predominately female.22 While our study included no pediatric 
cases of GIST, it is possible that GISTs <2 cm share more characteristics with pediatric 
GIST as opposed to adult GIST, thus shifting the sex distribution. In terms of racial 
differences, malignant GISTs <2 cm were more common in Blacks as compared to Whites, 
consistent with our earlier finding in all patients with GIST.4 However, while GISTs of all 
sizes were more common in Asians/Pacific Islanders than Whites, this was not the case for 
GIST <2 cm. The highest incidence of GIST <2 cm was consistent with GIST of all sizes, 
peaking among patients aged 70 to 79 years of age. Similar to GIST of all sizes, GISTs <2 
cm are most commonly found in the stomach (62 %) and the small intestine (23 %). Taken 
together, GISTs <2 cm occur in a similar patient population as compared to those patients 
with larger tumors, with differences in sex and race distributions.
Our study is limited to describing the epidemiology of malignant GIST <2 cm in the SEER 
database. As a result, we likely underestimated the true underlying incidence since there are 
many patients with asymptomatic GIST <2 cm that were not identified, lacked a tissue 
diagnosis, or were coded as “benign.” Consistent with the latter hypothesis, Choi et al. 
demonstrated that there is underreporting of GIST at the national registry level, because 
hospital-based cancer registrars and coders may code them as benign.23 This further 
confounds the underestimation of these tumors as the SEER database is missing these 
pathologically defined GISTs. Our study also carries a component of selection bias since we 
only assess patients with a tissue diagnosis of a frequently asymptomatic tumor; thus, 
patients who are undergoing surveillance of unresected tumors are not included. Despite 
these limitations, our study provides a better understanding of GIST <2 cm as we are able to 
assess a large number of patients across multiple ages and states, with GIST distributed 
throughout the GI tract. Since these tumors were identified using histology and site-specific 
codes, misdiagnosis and miscoding are still potential sources of error; however, these coding 
errors are likely equally distributed across all patients and thus should not greatly influence 
the distribution of tumors. Also, the current ICD-O-3 GIST histology code was instated in 
2001. While we only included patients diagnosed after 2001, we may still be 
underestimating patients with GIST <2 cm in SEER in the early years of the study due to the 
adoption of the new code. Additionally, we lack data on the mitotic index or genomics of the

 tumors, including known drivers such as KIT, PDGFRα, and BRAF, which are commonly 
used as a variable for risk stratification.8,24–27 Therefore, we are unable to address that 
aspect of tumor biology and instead focus on tumor size and location as other variables for 
risk stratification.
In conclusion, the previous understanding of GIST <2 cm is derived from studies that have 
limited ability to assess the epidemiology and anatomic distribution of these tumors. The 
current study represents the first population-based analysis of malignant GIST <2 cm 
throughout the GI tract and identifies a mortality risk that has been underappreciated by 
gastroenterologists, surgeons, and oncologists. Further studies are needed to define the 
underlying reasons for the identified differences, to develop novel risk assessment schema 
for patients with these small tumors, and to determine appropriate indications for 
gastroenterologists to refer patients for resection and/or medical therapy.
