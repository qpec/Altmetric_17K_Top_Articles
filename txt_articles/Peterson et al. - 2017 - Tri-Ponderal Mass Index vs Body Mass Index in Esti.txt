IMPORTANCE Body mass index (BMI) is used to diagnose obesity in adolescents worldwide,
despite evidence that weight does not scale with height squared in adolescents. To account
for this, health care providers diagnose obesity using BMI percentiles for each age (BMI
z scores), but this does not ensure that BMI is accurate in adolescents.
OBJECTIVE To compare the accuracy of BMI vs other body fat indices of the form body mass
divided by heightn in estimating body fat levels in adolescents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional data from the 1999 to 2006 US
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed between September 2015
and December 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and anthropometric data
were used to determine changes in body fat levels, body proportions, and the scaling
relationships among body mass, height, and percent body fat. To assess the merits of each
adiposity index, 3 criteria were used: stability with age, accuracy in estimating percent body
fat, and accuracy in classifying adolescents as overweight vs normal weight.
RESULTS Participants included 2285 non-Hispanic white participants aged 8 to 29 years.
Percent body fat varied with both age and height during adolescence, invalidating the
standard weight-to-height regression as the way of finding the optimal body fat index.
Because the correct regression model (percent body fat is proportional to mass divided by
heightn) suggested that percent body fat scales to height with an exponent closer to 3, we
therefore focused on the tri-ponderal mass index (TMI; mass divided by height cubed) as an
alternative to BMI z scores. For ages 8 to 17 years, TMI yielded greater stability with age and
estimated percent body fat better than BMI (R2 = 0.64 vs 0.38 in boys and R2 = 0.72 vs 0.66
in girls). Moreover, TMI misclassified adolescents as overweight vs normal weight less often
than BMI z scores (TMI, 8.4%; 95% CI, 7.3%-9.5% vs BMI, 19.4%; 95% CI, 17.8%-20.0%;
P < .001) and performed equally as well as updated BMI percentiles derived from the same
data set (TMI, 8.4%; 95% CI, 7.3%-9.5% vs BMI, 8.0%; 95% CI, 6.9%-9.1%; P = .62).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The tri-ponderal mass index estimates body fat levels more
accurately than BMI in non-Hispanic white adolescents aged 8 to 17 years. Moreover, TMI
diagnoses adolescents as overweight more accurately than BMI z scores and equally as well as
updated BMI percentiles but is much simpler to use than either because it does not involve
complicated percentiles. Taken together, it is worth considering replacing BMI z scores with
TMI to estimate body fat levels in adolescents.

 A
large international effort is underway to reduce child-
hood obesity in response to increasing rates of obe-
sity among children and adolescents.1-3 Accurate clas-
sificationofexcessbodyfatiscentraltotheseefforts.Asof2017,
body mass index (BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared, is used worldwide to screen
for obesity.
Body mass index is based on the finding that adult body
weight is proportional to height squared.4-6 However, during
adolescent development, weight is not proportional to height
squared, thus undercutting the validity of BMI in adoles-
cents.4-7 Quetelet,5,6 who developed the concept of BMI, first
reported during the 19th century that adolescent weight scales
with height powers of at least 2.5.5,6 More than 100 years later,
Cole4,7 reviewed the literature and reported somewhat differ-
ent scaling powers between 3 and 3.5, with values peaking be-
tween ages 10 to 15 years.4,7
To rectify the problem that these scaling powers (approxi-
mately 2.5-3.5) are inconsistent with BMI (approximately 2)
prior to age 18 years, BMI z scores are instead used for chil-
dren and adolescents.4 Body mass index z scores classify chil-
dren and adolescents as normal weight vs overweight or obese
based on their BMI percentile. However, this approach fails to
take into account that both body proportions and body fat lev-
els change during adolescent growth in a way that is inconsis-
tent with BMI. We therefore questioned whether BMI z scores
could be misclassifying a significant fraction of adolescents as
overweight. If so, what should replace BMI z scores?
Here, using cross-sectional data from the Nutrition and
Health Examination Survey (NHANES),8-11 we tested whether
the earlier onset of the pubertal growth spurt in overweight
individuals,12,13 combined with age-related changes in body fat
levels and more isometric-like growth in body proportions,
make BMI inaccurate for estimating body fat levels during ado-
lescence. To replace BMI, we tested other body fat indices of
the form mass divided by heightn, including the tri-ponderal
mass index (TMI = mass divided by height cubed [kilograms
divided by meters cubed]), which is based on the ponderal in-
dex and the Rohrer Index (see eAppendix 1 in the Supplement
forahistoricaloverview).Wecomparedadiposityindicesusing
3 criteria (stability with age, accuracy in estimating body fat
percentage, and accuracy in classifying overweight status) to
determine whether TMI is superior to BMI for estimating per-
cent body fat during adolescent development.
Methods
Study Oversight and Ethics
The protocol for NHANES was approved by the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and all participants provided written informed
consent.
Study Design
We first tested the hypothesis that changes both in body com-
position(percentbodyfat)andinbodyproportionsrenderBMI
inaccurate during adolescence. To test this hypothesis, we in-
vestigated (1) how percent body fat influences the timing of
the adolescent growth spurt in height, (2) how percent body
fat varies by age, and (3) how body proportions scale during
adolescence. Next, to replace BMI, we compared body fat in-
dices of the form mass divided by heightn. To evaluate their
relativemerits,weused3maincriteria:(1)stabilityofthepopu-
lation mean as a function of age (stability with age); (2) accu-
racy in estimating percent body fat; and (3) accuracy in clas-
sifying overweight vs normal weight status.
Study Participants
This cross-sectional study included non-Hispanic white male
and female participants aged 8 to 29 years who participated
in the 1999 to 2006 NHANES,8,9 which is, to our knowledge,
the largest and most reliable cross-sectional data set on ado-
lescent body composition available and involves the only years
for which NHANES dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry data are
currently available. The NHANES surveys a nationally repre-
sentativesampleoftheUSpopulationeachyearthroughacom-
plex, stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling

9years,10to11years,12to13years,14to15years,16to17years,
18 to 19 years, 20 to 24 years, and 25 to 29 years. Adults were
defined as older than 17 years, and we defined adolescent de-
velopment with respect to cross-sectional data (not longitu-
dinal data) as spanning ages 8 to 17 years because some indi-
vidualsstartthegrowthspurtveryearly,whileothersstartlate.
Body Composition Assessment
Body composition was evaluated by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry.10,15,16Heightwasevaluatedasdescribedinthe
NHANES body composition procedures manual.17 For consis-
tency, we used body weight as measured by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry.
Growth Dynamics and Stability With Age
To assess body composition during adolescence, mean val-
ues for fat mass, fat-free mass, and percent body fat were cal-
culated for each age group. To determine how percent body
fat influences the timing of the adolescent growth spurt, mean
valuesforheightforeachquartileofpercentbodyfatwerecom-

Key Points
Question Is there a better screening tool than body mass index
z scores to estimate percent body fat in children and adolescents
aged 8 to 17 years?
Findings In this cross-sectional study, using data from the 1999 to
2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the
tri-ponderal mass index (mass divided by height cubed) estimated
body fat percentage better than body mass index. Moreover, the
tri-ponderal mass index more effectively diagnoses overweight vs
normal weight status than the body mass index z scores.
Meaning It is worth considering replacing body mass index
z scores with the more accurate and easier-to-use tri-ponderal
mass index to screen for obesity and overweight status in children
and adolescents.

 body fat scales with weight and height, we performed the re-
gressions (1) mass is proportional to heightn and (b) percent
body fat is proportional to mass divided by heightn using log
transformation. Lastly, to assess changes in body proportions
during adolescence, changes in the population means of each
adiposity index were compared as a function of age group; this
also served as our measure of stability with age.
Adiposity Estimation
To determine the accuracy in estimating percent body fat, we
performed polynomial regressions for percent body fat, with
each adiposity index as the dependent variable. Polynomial
regressions for BMI and TMI were performed up to quadratic
order in SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute) and up to quartic or-
der for all indices using Mathematica, version 10.0 (Wolfram
Research). Results are given for quadratic-order polynomials.
The higher the fraction of the explained variance (ie, R2 val-
ues) in percent body fat, the greater the accuracy of the index.
Misclassification Rates
Finally, we evaluated the body fat indices on their ability to
classifyoverweightstatus.InlieuofusingBMIdirectly,weused
BMI z scores, which are adjusted for sex and age. For binary
classification of overweight and obese status, threshold val-
ues at the 85th and 95th percentiles, respectively, of percent
body fat for each age and sex group were used, which were ob-
tained from Ogden et al.18 Tri-ponderal mass index thresh-
olds were calculated as the 85th and 95th percentiles of TMI
for all individuals aged 8 to 17 years for each sex and were not
adjusted for age. Total misclassification rates across both sexes
were calculated by averaging the separate values for boys and
girls. We also compared the overweight TMI thresholds vs the
85thpercentilesofBMIharvestedfromthesameNHANESdata
set (BMI for age) to have a fair head-to-head comparison of BMI
percentiles vs TMI thresholds derived from the same data set.
These analyses were performed in Python, version 2.7 (Python
Software Foundation). Lastly, we performed receiver operat-
ing characteristic analyses using SPSS, version 21 (IBM) to de-
termine the optimal values of n in the adiposity index mass
divided by heightn that minimizes misclassification rates.
Thresholdvalues19toclassifyoverweightandobesestatuswere
obtained by minimizing the distance from the receiver oper-
ating characteristic curve to the coordinates (0, 1), which was
performed in Maple, version 2011 (Maplesoft). For the re-
ceiver operating characteristic curve analyses, the first im-
puted NHANES data set was used.
Statistical Analyses
Throughout, data are presented as mean (SE) or with 95%
CIs. With the exceptions already noted, all other statistical
analyses were performed in SAS and included sample
weights to adjust for noncoverage, nonresponse, and over-
sampling of some groups. To account for the multiply
imputed structure of the NHANES data set (5 imputed data
sets), separate analyses were conducted for each imputed
data set, and the resulting estimates were averaged. Mean
values and scaling exponents were tested for statistical sig-
nificance using 2-tailed t tests, while differences in misclas-
sification rates were tested for statistical significance using
the McNemar mid-P test. The significance threshold was set
at P < .05, and all P values were 2-sided. Adjustments for the
number of age-group comparisons were made separately for
each outcome variable using the Bonferroni correction.
Results
Body Composition and Growth Dynamics
There were 2178 male participants (1260 children and adoles-
cents and 918 adults) and 2220 female participants (1025 chil-
dren and adolescents and 1195 adults) across the 8 age groups.
Height, body weight, fat-free mass, and fat mass were typi-
cally greater with age until age 18 years (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). There were only small deviations from this trend, most
notably that height in girls and women plateaued slightly ear-
lier at age 16 to 17 years.
In girls and women, percent body fat increased with age
and reached a plateau by age 18 years, rising from a mean (SE)
of 31.2% (0.5%) at age 8 to 9 years to 36.4% (0.5%) at ages 25
to 29 years (P < .001). By contrast, in boys and men, percent
body fat decreased from a mean (SE) of 27.8% (0.5%) to 23.0%
(0.4%) between ages 12 to 13 years and 14 to 15 years (P < .001)

 The influence of percent body fat on height is illustrated
for quartiles 1 and 4 in Figure 1. The data for all quartiles are
provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Heavier individuals
were taller than leaner individuals at ages 8 to 9 years, 10 to 11
years, and 12 to 13 years for girls and at ages 8 to 9 years and
10 to 11 years for boys. After Bonferroni correction, the effect
of adiposity on height only remained significant for ages 8 to
9 years in both sexes. In addition, there was a transient re-
verse effect in girls at ages 16 to 17 years, wherein thinner in-
dividuals were a mean of 4.0 cm taller, which may reflect a sec-
ond growth spurt: the so-called late bloomers.
Weight-to-Height Scaling Relationship
As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, regressing mass vs
heightncanproducescalingexponentsthatarestatisticallydif-
ferent from those of the regression percent body fat vs mass
divided by heightn including some anomalously high and low
scaling exponents. This demonstrates that the conventional
approachofregressingmassvsheightntofindtheoptimalbody
fat index is not accurate whenever percent body fat depends
on height such as in adolescents. With the correct regression
model for adiposity, namely percent body fat is proportional
to mass divided by heightn, the aggregate scaling exponent for
ages 8 to 17 years is 3.54 for boys (95% CI, 3.42-3.66) and 2.82
for girls (95% CI, 2.72-2.92; Figure 2). By comparison, the scal-
ing exponents for adults are no different from 2: 1.94 for men
(95% CI, 1.67-2.21) and 1.97 for women (95% CI, 1.74-2.21).
Stability With Age
Aggregate scaling exponents closer to 3 than to 2 suggest that
TMI may represent a better index than BMI; we therefore fo-
cused on TMI as a replacement for BMI. Figure 3 shows the
mean values of BMI and TMI as a function of age. Body mass
index increased by a large amount (≥7.9) between ages 8 to 9
years and 25 to 29 years in both sexes (P < .001). By contrast,
TMI is nearly stable throughout adolescence, with popula-
tion means hovering at approximately 14 kg/m3. Tri-ponderal
mass index is statistically stable until ages 20 years and older
in men and ages 16 years and older in women.
Adiposity Estimation
As shown in Figure 4, TMI estimates percent body fat more ac-
curately than BMI. In boys, BMI explains only 38% of the vari-
anceinpercentbodyfat,whereasTMIexplains64%ofthevari-
ance: a large difference in accuracy vs BMI. In girls, TMI fits
the percent body fat data better than BMI, but the difference
in explained variance is small: 72% for TMI vs 66% for BMI.
Classification of Overweight Status
Finally, we compared the accuracy of TMI vs BMI z scores in
diagnosing overweight status (Figure 5 and eFigure 3 in the
Supplement). The TMI thresholds to diagnose overweight sta-
tus were 16.0 kg/m3 for boys and 16.8 kg/m3 for girls and were
18.8 kg/m3 for boys and 19.7 kg/m3 for girls to diagnose obese
status. For boys, the false-positive and -negative rates for TMI
were 5.7% (95% CI, 4.3%-7.1%) and 27.1% (95% CI, 20.4%-
33.8%), respectively, vs values of 23.1% (95% CI, 20.6%-
25.6%) and 2.5% (95% CI, 0.1%-4.8%), respectively, for BMI
z scores (P < .001). For girls, the false-positive and -negative
rates for TMI were 4.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-6.2%) and 25.5% (95%
CI, 18.4%-32.6%), respectively, vs values of 21.7% (95% CI,
18.9%-24.5%) and 2.6% (95% CI, 0.0%-5.2%), respectively, for
BMI z scores (P < .001). The overall misclassification rate was
only8.4%(95%CI,7.3%-9.5%)forTMIvs19.4%(95%CI,17.8%-
20.0%) for BMI z scores (P < .001). Similarly, TMI also misclas-
sified fewer adolescents as obese (8.0%; 95% CI, 6.9%-9.1%)
than BMI z scores (11.3%; 95% CI, 10.0%-12.6%; P < .001; data
not shown). Lastly, a single TMI threshold performed equally
well at diagnosing overweight status as an updated set of age-
specific BMI thresholds that were derived from the same
NHANES data set (total misclassification rate of 8.4%; 95% CI,
7.3%-9.5% for TMI vs 8.0%; 95% CI, 6.9%-9.1% for BMI;
P = .62).
Testing Other Indices
We also determined the stability with age, accuracy in estimat-
ing body fat levels, and accuracy in classifying weight status
of our other candidate body fat indices, but TMI still per-
formed best in aggregate (eFigure 4 and eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement).Intotal,the6differentindicestestedwere(1)BMI

and (6) age- and sex-specific values of n derived from the
same regression. We also discuss several important points and
considerations for replicating our work in eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement.
Discussion
Body mass index screening in children and adolescents is an
important tool to combat obesity worldwide. International
organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the World Health Organization rely on BMI
z scores to assess the global obesity epidemic among
children and adolescents. Moreover, many US school
districts now send health warning letters to parents of

 children classified as overweight according to BMI z scores.
However, weight is not proportional to height squared dur-
ing adolescence, casting doubt on the accuracy of BMI per-
centiles in adolescents.
Here, using data from the 1999-2006 NHANES, we show
that TMI is a superior body fat index to BMI z scores for 3 rea-
sons: (1) TMI misclassifies overweight status less often than
BMI z scores (8.4% vs 19.4%) and performs as well as an
updated set of BMI percentiles; (2) TMI better estimates body
fat levels, especially in boys; and (3) TMI is approximately
constant during adolescence, whereas BMI increases dramati-
cally in value, necessitating the use of age-specific percen-
tiles. Using TMI, overweight status (defined as the 85th per-
centile of percent body fat) can be diagnosed in non-Hispanic

 white individuals aged 8 to 17 years by using threshold values
of 16.0 kg/m3 for boys and 16.8 kg/m3 for girls.
Interestingly, the false-positive rate for BMI z scores was
higher than we expected (22.4%). Therefore, we repeated the
analysis using updated 85th percentiles of BMI that we de-
rived (without smoothing) from the same NHANES data set.
In contrast to BMI z scores, this internal set of updated age-
specific BMI thresholds was equally as accurate as TMI (8.0 vs
8.4%; P = .62). The discrepancy between BMI z scores and our
updated BMI-for-age thresholds can be traced to the fact that
BMI z scores were developed using older data sets, spanning
the years 1963 to 1980. Body mass index z scores are there-
fore not aligned with the percent body fat percentiles devel-
oped in Ogden et al18; in other words, American children and
adolescents are now more overweight than when BMI z scores
were developed. If the goal is to define overweight status in
children and adolescents based on percentiles of body fat, then
BMI z scores are overdiagnosing adolescents as overweight,
whichmayhaveincreasedhealthcare–relatedcostsandplaced
stress on families who were incorrectly told that their chil-
dren are overweight. This is important because adolescents
may be more sensitive than adults to being classified as
overweight,20,21 and they are more vulnerable to weight bias
and fat shaming.22,23 Regardless of whether BMI z scores will
be updated in the future, defining overweight status in terms
ofpercentiles,regardlessofwhatdecadethosepercentileswere
developed in, can be problematic. Because TMI does not need
age-specific percentiles, it offers a way out of this problem.
In this study, we also showed that tracking body fat dur-
ing adolescence is challenging because it involves subtleties
in both growth allometry (scaling across age groups) and static
allometry (scaling within each age group); a full discussion can
be found in eAppendix 2 of the Supplement. Unfortunately,
most prior research incorrectly assumed that regressing mass
against heightn yields the optimal index for classifying adi-
posity in children and adolescents. This approach is flawed for
2 reasons. First, the regression equation mass vs heightn does
not accurately estimate body fat when percent body fat de-
pends on height.24 During adolescence, percent body fat does
depend on height: excess body fat levels affect hormone lev-
els, and therefore, more overweight children enter puberty
earlier23,24 and are taller12,13,25,26 than lean individuals. In-
stead, the regression equation percent body fat vs mass di-
vided by heightn must be used to determine the scaling of per-
cent body fat with weight and height, as we showed in eFigure
2 in the Supplement. Second, the optimal body fat index ob-
tained from the regression percent body fat vs mass divided
byheightnisnotnecessarilythesameindexthatoptimallyclas-
sifies overweight vs normal weight status, as we showed in
Figure 2 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement. We therefore make
2 important conclusions: (1) the regression equation mass vs
heightn should no longer be used in children and adolescents

 to estimate percent body fat and (2) to determine the optimal
index for classifying overweight status, misclassification rates
must be directly compared, such as by receiver operating char-
acteristic analysis.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the sample sizes for
determining misclassification rates were modest, thereby
limiting statistical power. Second, our analyses depended on
a cross-sectional sample, not longitudinal data; in particular,
adolescents are still growing and may move up or down
many percentiles in height or percent body fat during
adolescence.27 Third, neither BMI nor TMI captures hor-
mone status or Tanner stage, and Cole7 has shown that
maturity status affects the scaling of weight with height.7
Last, we limited our analyses to non-Hispanic white children
and adolescents. Our analysis needs to be performed in
other ethnic/racial groups because thresholds for diagnosing
overweight status and/or increased health risks may vary by
ethnic/racial group.
Overall, it is important to recognize that while TMI is a bet-
ter diagnostic tool for classifying overweight status than BMI
z scores, it is still imperfect. Tri-ponderal mass index is based
on the statistical distribution of body fat levels (as are BMI
z scores) rather than on health risks. This latter point needs to
be remedied in the context of larger studies on adolescent adi-
posity and health risk factors. In the meantime, TMI thresh-
old values should be considered in the context of other health
and demographic factors.
Conclusions
Tri-ponderal mass index estimates body fat percentage more
accurately than BMI in non-Hispanic white adolescents aged
8to17years.Inaddition,TMIismoreaccuratethanBMIzscores
at classifying overweight status and is as accurate as up-to-
date BMI percentiles. Yet TMI requires only a single threshold
for each sex, instead of the multiple complicated age- and sex-
specificthresholdsneededforBMItoworkinadolescents.This
has several implications. First, we should consider using TMI
instead of BMI and BMI z scores in adolescents. Second, be-
cause TMI is more accurate than BMI, conclusions drawn
from national and international surveys relying on BMI
z scores may need to be reevaluated. Overall, while TMI was
superior to BMI during adolescent development, the ramifi-
cations of recommending a bold change to clinical practice
and to public health research have not escaped us. Therefore,
our work, including our 3-criteria strategy for assessing the
merits of obesity, needs to be extended to other racial/ethnic
groups and then replicated in large cross-sectional and longi-
tudinal studies.
