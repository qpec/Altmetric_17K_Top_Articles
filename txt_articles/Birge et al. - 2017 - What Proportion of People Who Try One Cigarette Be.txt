ABSTRACT   
Introduction: The ‘conversion rate’  from initial experimentation to daily smoking is a 
potentially important metric of smoking behavior, but estimates of it based on current 
representative data are lacking.  
Methods: The Global Health Data Exchange was searched for representative surveys 
conducted in English speaking, developed countries after year 2000 that included questions 
about ever trying a cigarette and ever smoking daily. The initial search identified 2776 
surveys that were further screened for language, location, year, sample size, survey 
structure and representativeness. 44 surveys that passed the screening process were 
accessed and their codebooks were examined to see whether the two questions of interest 
were included.  Eight datasets allowed extraction or estimation of relevant information. 
Survey quality was assessed with regards to response rates, sampling methods and data 
collection procedures. PRISMA guidelines were followed, with explicit rules for approaching 
derived variables and skip patterns. Proportions were pooled using random effects meta-
analysis. 
Results: The eight surveys used representative samples of the general adult population. 
Response rates varied from 45% to 88%. Survey methods were on par with the best practice 
in this field. Altogether 216,314 respondents were included of whom 60.3% (95%CI 51.3-
69.3) ever tried a cigarette. Among those, 68.9% (95% CI 60.9-76.9%) progressed to daily 
smoking. 
Conclusions: Over two thirds of people who try one cigarette become, at least temporarily, 
daily smokers. The finding provides strong support for the current efforts to reduce cigarette 
experimentation among adolescents.

The transition from trying the first cigarette through occasional to daily smoking usually 
implies that a recreational activity is turning into a compulsive need that has to be satisfied 
virtually continuously. The ‘conversion rate’  from initial experimentation to daily smoking is 
thus a potentially important metric of smoking behavior, but estimates of it based on 
representative data are lacking. The present  meta analysis addressed this gap.  Currently, 
about two thirds of non-smokers experimenting with cigarettes progress to daily smoking. 
The finding supports strongly the current efforts to reduce cigarette experimentation among 
adolescents.

INTRODUCTION 
Habitual smoking, once established, can be highly resistant to change [1]. A substantial 
proportion of smokers continue to smoke despite professing a desire to quit [2-3], and those 
attempting to quit face more than a 90% probability that they will return to smoking within a 
year [4]. In some smokers, the activity acquires all the characteristics of extreme 
dependence [5].  
 
In the development of any addictive behaviour, the transfer from experimentation to daily 
practice represents an important  landmark [6]. The transition from trying the first cigarette 
through occasional to daily smoking usually implies that a recreational activity is turning into 
a compulsive need that has to be satisfied virtually continuously [7-8]. Adolescent smokers 
can show signs of dependence early on, before progressing to daily smoking [9] but such 
individuals typically do progress to daily smoking eventually, while people who remain 
occasional smokers tend to display few signs of dependence [10-11].  
 
The rate of the transfer from the first experimentation with cigarettes to daily smoking 
(referred to as the ‘conversion rate’ throughout this paper) would seem to be an essential 
piece of information needed to guide policies concerned with tobacco experimentation in 
adolescents. If most adolescents who experiment with smoking abandon the behaviour at its 
early stages, preventing such opportunities would be less important than if the transfer from 
experimentation to daily smoking was common. 
 
So, what proportion of people who tried a single cigarette progress to daily smoking? 
Surprisingly, few attempts exist to answer this question. MAH Russell, the pioneer of

tobacco dependence research, used figures from a 1967 cross-ssectional survey of 984 UK 
adults [12] to calculate that of people who smoked one cigarette, 70% went on to smoke 
regularly for five years or more [13]. The estimate was based on a relatively small sample 
dating from the time when smoking was highly prevalent and socially acceptable. We are 
aware of one other study of a general population sample that reported 68% of ever smokers 
progressing to daily smoking [14]. There are of course newer studies that have attempted to 
assess the dependence potential of smoking but this was done by e.g. estimating the 
proportion of adolescent and/or adult smokers who can be classified as dependent using 
indices such as DSM criteria, smoking the first cigarette of the day within 30 minutes of 
waking up, reporting urges to smoke or irritability when unable to smoke or experiencing 
difficulty refraining from smoking [e.g. 9,15-20]. The conclusions varied depending on which 
criteria of dependence were adopted. 
 
Further current empirical data from which an estimate of the rate at which experimentation 
with cigarettes translates into daily smoking could be derived exist. Several surveys of the 
general population have been conducted that ask the respondents whether they had ever 
tried smoking and whether they have ever smoked daily. We undertook a systematic review 
of all the existing data sets to provide as comprehensive  an answer to the question in the 
title of this report as possible.  
 
METHODS 
Study design 
This was a systematic review of available representative surveys of the general population 
that ask whether respondents had ever tried a cigarette and whether they have ever been a 
daily smoker. The review followed the PRISMA protocol [21], see Figure 1.

Search Strategy 
We used the Global Health Data Exchange [22], which is the most comprehensive existing 
catalog of survey datasets and other health-related data, with the search term: ‘tobacco’ and 
filter type: ‘survey’. The search was performed in March-April 2016, giving 2776 results. 
Filtering the results to English speaking developed countries yielded 509 surveys: 151 from 
the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), 277 from North America (USA and 
Canada), and 81 from Australasia (New Zealand, and Australia). Finally, a time filter was 
applied to only include surveys published between the years 2000-2016 to make access to 
primary data easier and to homogenize the sample. (The Global Health Data Exchange 
catalogs data from the year 1900 onwards). The remaining 260 surveys were screened by 
two reviewers (JM and MB).Titles limiting the sample to subsets of the general population 
were excluded (“child” or “children” or “youth” or “adolescent” or “school” or “senior”). Where 
a survey was regularly repeated – as part of a series examining trends over time – only the 
most recent available version was used. Codebooks from each of the remaining 44 surveys 
were examined to see whether the two questions of interest were asked directly or could be 
inferred, i.e. whether respondents ever tried a cigarette and whether they ever smoked daily, 
and whether the survey used a representative population sample. Appendix 1 provides 
verbatim wording of the relevant questions used in each included survey. 
Where access was restricted in surveys that met the above criteria (three surveys), we 
followed the application procedures for access. We were granted the access in two cases 
[23, 24] but not in one other [25]. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram.

We were also made aware of one other relevant survey (National Comorbidity Survey - 
Replication, analysed by Dierker et al. 2008 [14]. The analysis provides the actual 
conversion rate and we added this to our meta-analysis and analysed the data including and 
excluding this survey.

Altogether eight surveys provided relevant data.  
Quality of included surveys 
We assessed sample sizes, representativeness, data collection methods and response rates 
of each included survey. Sample sizes ranged from 6,237 to 60,192. All surveys were 
designed to generate a random, representative sample of the general adult population. All 
surveys utilized current census data in a multi-stage stratification process. Generally, this 
involved first dividing a population into geographical units before further stratification based 
on relevant socioeconomic and personal indicators (e.g. income, age, ethnicity and gender). 
All surveys were conducted on behalf of governments. Data collection methods included 
computer assisted, fieldworker conducted interviews [26-28, 30] supplemented by paper 
self-completion questionnaires [27-28] and interviews over telephone [30]; telephone 
interviews only [29] , and a self-completed paper questionnaire that was either distributed 
and collected by the fieldworker or mailed in by the participant [23]. In five surveys 
respondents were paid either before the interview took place [30, 27-28] or upon completion 
[26, 29]. Response rates varied between 45% in the only example of a telephone based 
interview [28] to 88%, in the only example of a longitudinal series [30]. Table 1 lists methods, 
instruments, response rates and incentives in included surveys.

Despite relatively low response rates in some surveys, we consider the survey methods to 
be on par with the best practice in this field.

The degree of processing required to determine the number of daily and experimental 
smokers varied across surveys due to differences in questionnaire design, non-
derived/derived variables (where there was a direct question or the variable of interest had to 
be derived from grouping or combining answers to other questions) and ‘skip-patterns’ 
(where participants were directed to skip sections of the survey contingent on their answers 
to previous questions).  
 
Generally, answers to the two questions of interest (number of participants who ever tried a 
cigarette, and number who ever smoked daily) were not available in published survey results 
and had to be extracted from microdata.  
 
Two surveys [23, 26] used a single question to ascertain experimental smoking and a single 
question for ever-daily smoking. Three UK surveys [30, 27, 28] used similar questions 
concerning experimental smoking, but the daily smoking question was divided into past-daily 
and current-daily smoking and further divided into weekend and weekday use. Two surveys 
[27, 28] reported derived variables that re-categorised the answers into four smoking status 
options: current/former-daily/former-occasional/never smoker. As formal definitions of these 
categories were not provided, we analysed the survey skip-patterns and combinations of the 
answers to multiple questions to verify and adjust survey-derived variables. In one survey 
[30] we used three survey questions via skip pattern analysis to derive answers to both 
experimental and ever-daily smoking questions.In another survey [29], a respondent-age 
dependent skip pattern required a formula that combined answers to four questions. In this 
case (and generally, where possible), an alternative question was also used to check for 
consistency.

Details of data extraction used in different surveys are listed in Appendix 1.  
 
All surveys use “weighting” methodologies to minimize bias inherent in the population 
sampling methods. Statistical methods vary and can include adjustments made pre- or post- 
data processing (e.g.removing data from over-sampled sub-populations or using weighting 
factors on raw results) or both. For consistency, we did not use post-processing weightings, 
as this could not be applied to data sets where we had to derive the relevant figures 
ourselves [27-30] or where necessary details were not available [24]. In a sample 
comparison of the results using weightings and using raw numbers, the difference was <1%. 
Data analysis  
We obtained overall estimates by random effects meta analysis [31]. This was because we 
anticipated that the underlying population proportions in each survey were unlikely to be 
identical. 
RESULTS  
 
Table 2 presents the results from each survey and from the overall survey sample.  
 
TABLE 2 about here 
 
Across surveys, 60.3% (95%CI 51.3-69.3) of respondents have ever tried smoking and 
41.2% (95% CI 33.5-48.9%) were ever-daily smokers.

The conversion  rate from trying a cigarette to becoming a daily smokers ranged from 50% in 
one of the US surveys to 82% in one of the UK surveys. A simple pooling of all studies gives 
an overall estimate of 65.1% (95% CI 64.8-65.4%). The random effects weighted mean 
percentage across the surveys was 68.9% (95% CI 60.9-76.9%). Excluding the survey for 
which we had to impute the total number and the number of daily smokers, the weighted 
mean random effects estimate was 69.1% (95% CI 60.3-78.0%). 
 
We tested the hypothesis that the differences in ‘conversion rate’ between surveys are 
related to surveys’ response rates. Smokers can be expected to be less likely to respond to 
smoking surveys than non-smokers for at least two reasons: Smoking rates are high in 
populations such as the homeless and people with mental health problems [32-33] who are 
less likely to respond to surveys; and in developed countries where smoking is generally 
viewed as an undesirable behavior [34], smokers can be expected to be less keen to 
respond to such surveys than non-smokers [35-37]. As the ‘’conversion rate’’ includes 
current smokers among ever smokers, lower response rates could be accompanied by lower 
smoking rates and also lower ‘conversion’ rates. There was no strong correlation between 
response rates and conversion rates (r=0.09). 
 
Discussion 
An estimated 69% of people who try a cigarette progress to daily smoking.  
The present study has several limitations. Different surveys yielded somewhat different 
results. Although none found conversion rates below 50%, and an additional survey from a 
non-English speaking country with a high smoking prevalence fitted well with the other 
surveys, the variation we observed suggests that the actual figure we arrived at is only 
approximate. We ruled out the influence of different response rates. The differences

between surveys could reflect random variation, or other factors such as circumstances and 
formats of the surveys that may have been more or less conducive to recall or convey 
different social acceptability of smoking and smoking experimentation. There are also 
questions that can be raised over the accuracy of the recall people have concerning their 
smoking history. If for instance a proportion of non-smoking respondents forgot that they had 
tried smoking, the real conversion rate would be lower. Whether a person did or did not try 
smoking seems to be an easily answerable question and one which does not seem to be 
subject to any obvious social desirability bias, but such influences cannot be ruled out 
altogether. Current smoking was likely to be under-reported [e.g. 35-37], but ‘’ever-daily-
smoking’’ seems again an information with neutral value, involving no obvious reason for a 
systematic response bias. In tobacco use surveys, answers to clear and salient questions 
seem to be reasonably reliable [38-39], but as in all retrospective surveys, a degree of 
uncertainty and error is inevitable [e.g. 40].  
 
The differences between surveys in conversion rates suggest that the random effects 
analysis was appropriate. A simple pooling of all studies provides a lower estimate of 65.0% 
(95% CI 64.7-65.3%), but with an unrealistic precision of estimation. The random effects 
analysis gives a somewhat higher average estimate as it uses a smaller differential in 
weights between large and small studies, and a substantially greater confidence interval, 
reflecting greater uncertainty. It should be noted that the denominator of the conversion rate, 
the number ever smoking a cigarette, was itself subject to variation. However, with the 
numbers of participants in the thousands or tens of thousands, this would not lead to 
noticeable extra-binomial variation.

The surveys we included were all cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies of representative 
population samples that would monitor smoking behavior from early adolescence to at least 
middle age would provide more definitive data. There exist longitudinal surveys that may 
allow extraction of relevant data (e.g. [41-42]), although they concern opportunistic rather 
than representative samples and cover only relatively limited time-periods. 
 
We were unable to extract data from one additional survey [14], but we imputed the 
necessary numbers for the analysis from published percentages.The results including and 
excluding this survey were almost identical (68.9% and 69.1% conversion rates 
respectively). Given the high ‘conversion rate’ from experimentation to daily smoking found 
in all existing surveys, it can be hypothesized that at least some of the reduction in smoking 
prevalence observed over the past 20 years is likely due to reduced experimentation with 
cigarettes among adolescents.  
 
While most experimenters progress to daily smoking, some do not. An important study of 
adolescent progression to tobacco dependence found that early experimenters are more 
likely to progress to heavier smoking and dependence [43]. Further work should explore the 
existing databases to see if if any other variables recorded in the relevant surveys are 
associated with the progression to daily smoking.  
 
Despite some remaining questions, the present study provides a clear and striking piece of 
information. To the best of the current knowledge, at the current time, about two thirds of 
non-smokers experimenting with cigarettes become daily smokers.
