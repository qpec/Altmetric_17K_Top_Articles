and middle-income countries

Summary
Background Tobacco use among people living with HIV results in excess morbidity and mortality. However, very little 
is known about the extent of tobacco use among people living with HIV in low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs). We assessed the prevalence of tobacco use among people living with HIV in LMICs.
Methods We used Demographic and Health Survey data collected between 2003 and 2014 from 28 LMICs where both 
tobacco use and HIV test data were made publicly available. We estimated the country-specific, regional, and overall 
prevalence of current tobacco use (smoked, smokeless, and any tobacco use) among 6729 HIV-positive men 
from 27 LMICs (aged 15–59 years) and 11 495 HIV-positive women from 28 LMICs (aged 15–49 years), and compared 
them with those in 193 763 HIV-negative men and 222 808 HIV-negative women, respectively. We estimated prevalence 
separately for males and females as a proportion, and the analysis accounted for sampling weights, clustering, and 
stratification in the sampling design. We computed pooled regional and overall prevalence estimates through meta-
analysis with the application of a random-effects model. We computed country, regional, and overall relative 
prevalence ratios for tobacco smoking, smokeless tobacco use, and any tobacco use separately for males and females 
to study differences in prevalence rates between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals.
Findings The overall prevalence among HIV-positive men was 24·4% (95% CI 21·1–27·8) for tobacco smoking, 3·4% 
(1·8–5·6) for smokeless tobacco use, and 27·1% (22·8–31·7) for any tobacco use. We found a higher prevalence in 
HIV-positive men of any tobacco use (risk ratio [RR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·26–1·57]) and tobacco smoking (1·46 [1·30–1·65]) 
than in HIV-negative men (both p<0·0001). The difference in smokeless tobacco use prevalence between HIV-positive 
and HIV-negative men was not significant (1·26 [1·00–1·58]; p=0·050). The overall prevalence among HIV-positive 
women was 1·3% (95% CI 0·8–1·9) for tobacco smoking, 2·1% (1·1–3·4) for smokeless tobacco use, and 3·6% 
(95% CI 2·3–5·2) for any tobacco use. We found a higher prevalence in HIV-positive women of any tobacco use 
(RR 1·36 [95% CI 1·10–1·69]; p=0·0050), tobacco smoking (1·90 [1·38–2·62]; p<0·0001), and smokeless tobacco use 
(1·32 [1·03–1·69]; p=0·030) than in HIV-negative women.
Interpretation The high prevalence of tobacco use in people living with HIV in LMICs mandates targeted policy, 
practice, and research action to promote tobacco cessation and to improve the health outcomes in this population.

Introduction
The advent of and increased access to antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) has transformed HIV from a deadly 
disease to a chronic condition for many people living 
with HIV.1 With ART, people living with HIV can 
now have a near-normal life expectancy.1 However, 
unhealthy behaviours such as tobacco use threaten to 
undermine some of the gains that have been made.2 
Smoking increases the risk of death among people living 
with HIV.3,4 A study3 among 924 HIV-positive women 
on ART in the USA reported an increased risk of 
death due to smoking with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·53 
(95% CI 1·08–2·19). A prospective cohort4 of 17 995 HIV-
positive individuals from Europe and North America 
receiving ART found a mortality rate ratio of 1·94 
(95% CI 1·56–2·41) for smokers when compared with 
non-smokers. The average years of life lost by HIV-
positive smokers compared with HIV-positive non-
smokers have been estimated as 12·3 years, which is 
more than twice the number of years lost by HIV 
infection alone.5
People living with HIV are more susceptible to tobacco-
related illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, 
and pulmonary disease when compared with those who 
are HIV-negative or with the general population.6–8 
Furthermore, smoking among people living with HIV 
increases susceptibility to infections such as bacterial 
pneumonia, oral candidiasis, and tuberculosis.9–11 A case-
control study12 among 279 ART-naive HIV-positive men in 
South Africa found that current smoking tripled the risk 
of pulmonary tuberculosis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3·2; 
95% CI 1·3–7·9, p=0·01). Smoking also increases the risk

of developing AIDS (HR 1·36; 95% CI 1·07–1·72) among 
people living with HIV.3 This increased susceptibility has 
been mainly attributed to biochemical mechanisms 
including the immunosuppressive effects of smoking and 
its negative impact on immune and virological response 
even when on ART.13 Behavioural mechanisms have also 
been suggested—for example, an association between 
smoking and non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy.14,15
Few estimates are available of population-level preva-
lence of tobacco use among people living with HIV from 
low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 
the burden of HIV and tobacco-related illnesses is 
greatest.16–18 Our study aimed to address this evidence gap 
for all forms of tobacco use among people living with 
HIV, using data from 28 nationally representative 
household surveys. Our study also compared tobacco use 
prevalence among people living with HIV to that among 
HIV-negative individuals.
Methods
Data sources and procedures
We did a secondary analysis of the most recent (as at 
December, 2015) Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 
data from 28 LMICs where both tobacco use and HIV test 
data were made publicly available. Access to and use of 
this data was authorised by the DHS programme.
The DHS is designed to collect cross-sectional data that 
are nationally representative of the health and welfare of 
women of reproductive age (15–49 years), their children, 
and their households at about 5-year intervals across 
many LMICs. The DHS procedure including the two-
staged sampling approach for the selection of census 
enumeration areas and households, questionnaire 
validation, data collection for household, men, and 
women, and data validation are comprehensively 
described elsewhere.19 In all selected households, women 
aged 15–49 years are eligible to participate, and those 
who give consent are interviewed using a women’s 
questionnaire. In many surveys, men aged 15–54 years 
(or up to 59 years in some instances) from a subsample 
of the main survey households are also eligible to 
participate, and those who give consent are interviewed 
using a men’s questionnaire. The surveys are comparable 
across countries through the use of standard model 
question 
naires and sampling methods.
In the DHS, tobacco use is ascertained by three 
questions to be answered “yes” or “no”. Two are about 
whether the respondent currently smokes cigarettes or 
uses any other type of tobacco. The third asks the 
respondent what types of tobacco they currently smoke or 
use, for which all tobacco types are recorded including 
country-specific products.20 HIV status data are obtained 
from a HIV testing protocol that undergoes a host country 
ethical review and provides status from informed, 
anonymous, and voluntary HIV testing for both women 
and men. Blood spots are collected on filter paper from a 
finger prick and transported to a laboratory for testing. 
The testing involves an initial ELISA test, and then 
retesting of all positive tests and 5–10% of the negative 
tests with a second ELISA. For those with discordant 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE (OVID platform) for articles published 
from inception until Dec 31, 2015, that included the terms 
“smoking” or “tobacco use” or “smokeless” or “cigarette” AND 
“HIV” or “human immunodeficiency virus” or “AIDS” or 
“Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome” in the title and were 
from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We 
updated this search on Sept 30, 2016. We identified six primary 
research articles on the prevalence of tobacco smoking among 
people living with HIV that covered eight countries, of which 
only one article was based on national-level Demographic and 
Health Survey data from one country. We did not identify any 
multi-LMIC comparisons on the topic.
Added value of this study
Our study is the largest to our knowledge to report country-level 
and overall prevalence estimates for tobacco smoking, smokeless 
tobacco use, and any tobacco use among people living with HIV 
from 28 LMICs using nationally representative data that is 
comparable across countries. Our study is also the first to 
compare the country-level prevalence estimates for tobacco use 
for people living with HIV with those for HIV-negative individuals 
in the respective countries where such data are available.
Implications of all the available evidence
Findings from our study and all other identified studies confirm 
that for LMICs, the prevalence of tobacco use is higher among 
people living with HIV than among those without HIV, for both 
men and women. Policy, practice, and research action on 
tobacco cessation among people living with HIV is urgently 
needed to prevent the excess morbidity and mortality due to 
tobacco-related diseases and to improve the health outcomes 
in this population. This action could include exploring effective 
and cost-effective tobacco cessation interventions for people 
living with HIV that are appropriate and scalable in 
low-resource settings; the integration of tobacco use services 
within HIV programmes in LMICs including proactive 
identification and recording of tobacco use, as well as the 
provision of tobacco use cessation interventions; increasing 
health-care providers’ awareness and competencies on 
provision of tobacco use cessation services among people living 
with HIV; increasing awareness of the harms due to tobacco use 
and the benefits of quitting among people living with HIV; and 
implementing smoke-free policies within HIV services.

results on the two ELISA tests, a new ELISA or a western 
blot is done.
Statistical analysis
We analysed country-level DHS data to calculate 
prevalence estimates for tobacco use in people living 
with HIV. We also computed relative prevalence ratios 
(as risk ratios [RRs]) comparing prevalence between 
HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals.
For each country for which HIV status data could be 
linked to individual records in the general survey, we 
included data on HIV-positive and HIV-negative 
individuals (as confirmed by blood test results) in the 
analysis. We classified respondents as “tobacco smoker” 
if they responded “yes” to smoking cigarettes, pipes, or 
other country-specific smoking products such as water 
pipe or hookah; as “smokeless tobacco user” if their 
response was “yes” to the use of chew, snuff, or other 
country-specific smokeless tobacco products; and as 
“any tobacco user” if they indicated that they smoked 
tobacco, used smokeless tobacco, or both. These 
categories were not mutually exclusive, and respondents 
could be classified as all three.
For each country, we estimated the crude prevalence of 
tobacco smoking, smokeless tobacco use, and any 
tobacco use for males and females. We used STATA 
version 14 for our analyses. The analysis included 
sampling weights to account for differential probabilities 
of selection and participation, and also accounted for 
clustering and stratification in the sampling design.21 
Within STATA version 14, we declared the DHS datasets 
as survey type from two-stage cluster sampling: the 
selection of census enumeration areas based on a 
probability (proportional to area size) and random 
selection of households from a complete listing of 
households within the selected enumeration areas.19 
Reported estimates include the associated 95% CIs. We 
also computed age-standardised prevalence rates for 
men and women separately, using the WHO World 
Standard Population Distribution based on world 
average population between 2000 and 2025.22
Countries were classified geographically into the 
following six WHO regions: Africa, Americas, eastern 
Mediterranean, Europe, southeast Asia, and western 
Pacific. We computed pooled regional estimates for the 
African region only, which had a sufficient number of 
countries with available data for a meta-analysis. We 
computed these estimates in MetaXL version 5.3 by first 
stabilisation of the variances of the raw proportions with 
a double arcsine transformation and then application of 
a random-effects model.23 We assumed that the country-
level estimates were different, yet related. With a 
random-effects meta-analysis, the SEs of the country-
specific estimates are adjusted to incorporate a measure 
of the extent of variation among them.24 The amount of 
variation, and hence the adjustment, can be computed 
from the estimates and SEs from the country-level data 
included in the meta-analysis.24 We computed overall 
pooled prevalence estimates for all countries combined 
together using the same methodology as for the regional-
level estimates.
To study differences in prevalence rates between HIV-
positive and HIV-negative individuals, we estimated 
country, regional, and overall relative prevalence ratios 
for tobacco smoking, smokeless tobacco use, and any 
tobacco use separately for males and females. We used 
RevMan version 5.1 for this analysis using the random-
effects model, as described above.
We used the I² statistic to assess heterogeneity between 
country-specific estimates: values of 25% or less 
indicated low heterogeneity, values greater than 25% but 
less than 75% indicated moderate heterogeneity, and 
values of 75% or greater indicated high heterogeneity. 
We explored potential sources of heterogeneity for 
prevalence estimates through meta-regression analysis. 
This analysis tested the association between the country-
level covariates, as well as year of survey (as a binary 
outcome: in or before 2009—which is approximately the 
mid 
point—or after 2009), with estimated prevalence of 
any tobacco use. We used STATA version 14 for meta-
regression.

Results
We were able to link HIV status data with the individual 
data in the general DHS survey for 28 LMICs, with data 
for men available in all LMICs apart from Cambodia. For 
these, our analysis provided data for 6729 HIV-positive 
men (aged 15–59 years) and 11 495 HIV-positive women 
(aged 15–49 years), as well as 193 763 HIV-negative men 
and 222 808 HIV-negative women for the same age 
groups. Of all LMICs, we were able to include 24 (52%) 
of 46 in Africa, two (8%) of 26 in the Americas, one (9%) 
of 11 in southeast Asia, and one (6%) of 18 in the western 
Pacific regions. Data were not available for any of the 
LMICs in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean. Table 1 
shows the country-level characteristics of HIV-positive 
and HIV-negative men and women whose data were 
included in the analysis.
Of HIV-positive men from the 27 LMICs, 27·1% 
(95% CI 22·8–31·7) reported any tobacco use (table 2). 
The crude prevalence ranged from 9·7% (Ethiopia) to 
68·3% (India). The regional pooled prevalence for Africa 
of any tobacco use was 26·0% (22·7–29·4). Overall, 
24·4% (21·1–27·8) of HIV-positive men reported 
smoking tobacco (table 2). We found a substantial 
variation in crude prevalence of current tobacco smoking 
across countries, from 9·7% (Ethiopia) to 54·8%

(The Gambia). The regional pooled prevalence for Africa 
of current tobacco smoking in HIV-positive men was 
24·2% (20·9–27·6). Overall, 3·4% (95% CI 1·8–5·6) of 
HIV-positive men reported use of smokeless tobacco 
(table 2). The country-level crude prevalence varied 
considerably and was as high as 41·4% in India. The 
regional pooled prevalence for Africa of current 
smokeless tobacco use was 2·6% (1·7–3·6).
When compared with HIV-negative men, the pooled 
prevalence among HIV-positive men was significantly 
higher for any tobacco use (figure 1) and for smoking 
(figure 2). The difference between the two groups on 
smokeless tobacco use prevalence did not reach 
significance (figure 3). The pooled prevalences for the 
African region were significantly higher for HIV-positive 
men than for HIV-negative men for any tobacco use 
(figure 1), tobacco smoking (figure 2), and smokeless 
tobacco use (figure 3).
Of HIV-positive women from the 28 LMICs, 3·6% 
(95% CI 2·3–5·2) reported any tobacco use (table 3). 
Lesotho had the highest crude prevalence at 16·4%. The 
regional pooled prevalence for Africa of any tobacco use 
was 2·8% (1·6–4·3). Overall, 1·3% (95% CI 0·8–1·9) of 
HIV-positive women reported smoking tobacco (table 3). 
The Dominican Republic had the highest crude 
prevalence at 10·1%. The regional pooled prevalence for

(figure 5), and smokeless tobacco use (figure 6). The 
pooled prevalences for the African region were 
significantly higher for HIV-positive women than for HIV-
negative women for any tobacco use (figure 4), tobacco 
smoking (figure 5), and smokeless tobacco use (figure 6).
We found substantial heterogeneity in prevalence 
estimates between countries within and across regions 
(table 2, table 3). However, meta-regression did not 
reveal any significant predictor variable for either men or 
women.

Discussion
This study is the largest to our knowledge to provide up-
to-date, country-specific, regional (specifically the African 
region) and overall prevalence estimates for tobacco 
smoking, smokeless tobacco use, and any tobacco use 
among people living with HIV using nationally 
representative samples from 28 LMICs. Our study shows 
that tobacco use prevalence in LMICs is generally higher 
for people living with HIV than for HIV-negative 
individuals, both men and women.

Other studies have reported a higher prevalence of 
smoking in people living with HIV than in HIV-negative 
individuals or in the general population. For example, in 
the USA, the reported prevalence of smoking among 
people living with HIV is 50–70% compared with about 
20% in the general population or HIV-negative 
individuals.3,9,25–31 These differences are much higher than 
the differences we observed for tobacco use in our study, 
and are observed for both men and women. A possible 
explanation is that most of the developed country studies 
were done in non-random samples of population 
subgroups, such as those in a particular treatment 
programme or low-income groups. The differences in 
study results could also be attributed to differences in the 
profile of HIV-positive populations in developed 
countries compared with LMICs (eg, mostly male vs 
mostly female, respectively). Very few studies have 
examined tobacco use prevalence among people living 
with HIV in LMICs; most of these studies are also of 
small non-random subsamples and only present data on 
tobacco smoking.32–35 Few of these studies make 
comparisons with the general population prevalence or

that among HIV-negative individuals. Those studies that 
have used larger samples or population-level data have 
reported prevalence estimates that are closer to our 
findings. A cross-sectional survey36 in Zimbabwe among 
6111 factory workers—88% of whom were men—found a 
smoking prevalence of 27% among HIV-positive 
individuals versus 17% among HIV-negative individuals 
(p<0·001). Later, Lall and colleagues37 reported tobacco 
use prevalence in India of 68% among HIV-positive men 
versus 58% among HIV-negative men from a secondary 
data analysis of 50 079 observations from the 2006 
general-population National Family Health Survey data.
We found substantial variation in tobacco smoking, 
smokeless tobacco use, and any tobacco use prevalence 
between countries. Tobacco smoking was much more 
prevalent among men than among women—an 
observation that is consistent with findings from 
elsewhere.38 For women, smokeless tobacco was the 
primary form of tobacco use in 11 of the 28 countries. 
This finding has also been noted elsewhere,21 and 
potential reasons include that, in some countries, 
smokeless tobacco use is more socially acceptable than 
tobacco smoking among women.39 A potential for 
misclassification also exists, particularly owing to under-
reporting in contexts in which tobacco smoking, or any 
tobacco use, is not socially or culturally acceptable, 
particularly for women.35,40 The gender differences in 
product preferences need to be accounted for when 
designing policies and interventions for tobacco use for 
people living with HIV. Additionally, although the 
prevalence of smoking is very low overall among women 
living with HIV, women can be exposed to second-hand 
smoke, particularly if their partners smoke, and the 
prevalence of this exposure and associated harms needs 
investigation. A recent analysis38 of DHS data from 
19 sub-Saharan Africa countries also identified other 
factors that increase the risk of being a smoker among 
people living with HIV in addition to gender, including 
being from poorer households and living in urban areas.
Possible reasons for high tobacco use among people 
living with HIV have included tobacco being used to 
cope with HIV-related symptoms such as neuropathic 
pain, as well as with anxiety, stress, and depression, all of 
which are higher in this population.30,41 Studies have 
found that people living with HIV express an inaccurate 
perception of their life expectancy that affects their 
perceived susceptibility to the risks of tobacco use.42 
Additionally, a study43 among 301 HIV-positive individuals 
in Mali found that, although knowledge of their HIV 
infection did not lead individuals to take up smoking, it 
negatively influenced those already smoking by 
increasing their consumption. These factors taken 
together suggest that dissemination of information on 
the harms of tobacco use might not be enough to reduce 
tobacco use in this population. The benefits of quitting 
also need to be emphasised either through use of targeted 
graphic health labels or use of culturally-appropriate 
mass communication media, as provided for in the 
guidelines for the implementation of tobacco control 
policies compliant with the WHO Framework Convention 
on Tobacco Control.
People living with HIV who use tobacco find it hard to 
quit and often recommence use after they have 
stopped.25,28,31 Pool and colleagues44 have published a 
systematic review including 14 studies (13 of which were 
conducted in the USA) on effectiveness of smoking 
cessation interventions among people living with HIV, 
most of which combined pharmacotherapy with nicotine 
replacement therapy or varenicline (or both) and 
psychotherapy. They found some poor-quality evidence 
of effectiveness in the short term but no clear evidence of 
effectiveness in the long term.44 Many interventions 
included in these studies were not tailored to the unique 
needs of people living with HIV, which was suggested as 
a potential reason for the poor success rates of these 
interventions.16 HIV-positive individuals face social 
stigma, mental and physical comorbidities, alcohol 
misuse, and co-dependencies on other substances, all of 
which influence their tobacco use behaviour, quit 
attempts, and successful cessation rates. Future 
interventions should take account of these complex 
social, psychological, and other health challenges faced 
by most people living with HIV.
In DHS data, current tobacco use status (including 
smoking status and smokeless tobacco use) are 
ascertained by self-report, which raises possibilities of 
under-reporting, as mentioned previously.35,40 Smokeless 
tobacco was treated as a homogeneous group in our 
study when in fact it is a surrogate term for a diverse 
range of tobacco products including snuff and chewing 
tobacco. Additionally, countries differed in the way data 
on smokeless tobacco use was collected and recorded, 
which meant that making clear distinctions between 
different smokeless tobacco products proved even more 
difficult. Our study comprised observations from 
individuals who had agreed to have an HIV test as part of 
the DHS, and had available test results that could be 
linked to their tobacco use data in the general DHS 
dataset. This condition meant that our sample was 
restricted to a self-selected population and might not 
represent the general population—a limitation of the 
DHS data on HIV and not just of our analysis. 
Furthermore, the samples analysed for some countries 
were relatively small, particularly for people living with 
HIV. Although unlikely, a potential for selection bias still 
exists when individuals included in the sample were 
substantially different from those who were not, with 
respect to their smoking status. Evidence suggests that 
the prevalence of tobacco use could be growing in some 
LMICs, especially in females.21 Our study included data 
from 2003 to 2014, and therefore our prevalence estimates 
could be lower than the current status. Our analysis was 
limited to a few WHO regions, and even within these 
regions—with the exception of Africa—we could only

include a few countries owing to unavailability of DHS 
data. Other countries had tobacco use data but did not 
have linked HIV data or did not make it publicly available, 
which restricted our ability to compute wider regional and 
global prevalence estimates.
Tobacco use leads to substantial morbidity and mortality 
among HIV-positive individuals.45 Countries with a high 
prevalence 
of 
tobacco 
use 
among 
HIV-positive 
populations, as highlighted by our study, should prioritise 
introduction of tobacco cessation in their HIV treatment 
plans. However, most HIV care providers are less likely to 
correctly identify current smokers and feel confident in 
their ability to influence smoking cessation than are 
general health workers.46 Given the overwhelming task of 
managing HIV infection and its complications, tobacco 
cessation might also be less of a priority from both 
providers’ and patients’ perspectives.25,42,47 Future research 
action to improve the health of this population could 
therefore include exploring effective and cost-effective 
tobacco cessation interventions for people living with HIV 
that are sustainable and scalable in low-resource settings. 
For policy and practice, action could include the 
integration of tobacco cessation within HIV programmes 
in LMICs including proactive identification and recording 
of tobacco use, as well as the provision of tobacco cessation 
interventions; increasing health-care providers’ awareness 
and skills in providing cessation advice to people living 
with HIV; increasing awareness of the harms due to 
tobacco use and the benefits of quitting among people 
living with HIV; and implementation of smoke-free 
policies within HIV-treatment facilities.
