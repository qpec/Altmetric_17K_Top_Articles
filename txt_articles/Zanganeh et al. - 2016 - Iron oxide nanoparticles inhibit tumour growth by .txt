Abstract
Until now, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved iron supplement ferumoxytol and 
other iron oxide nanoparticles have been used for treating iron deficiency, as contrast agents for 
magnetic resonance imaging and as drug carriers. Here, we show an intrinsic therapeutic effect of 
ferumoxytol on the growth of early mammary cancers, and lung cancer metastases in liver and 
lungs. In vitro, adenocarcinoma cells co-incubated with ferumoxytol and macrophages showed 
increased caspase-3 activity. Macrophages exposed to ferumoxytol displayed increased mRNA 
associated with pro-inflammatory Th1-type responses. In vivo, ferumoxytol significantly inhibited 
growth of subcutaneous adenocarcinomas in mice. In addition, intravenous ferumoxytol treatment

 before intravenous tumour cell challenge prevented development of liver metastasis. Fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) and histopathology studies showed that the observed tumour growth 
inhibition was accompanied by increased presence of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in the 
tumour tissues. Our results suggest that ferumoxytol could be applied ‘off label’ to protect the liver 
from metastatic seeds and potentiate macrophage-modulating cancer immunotherapies.
Iron oxide nanoparticles have been widely used as contrast agents and drug carriers in 
preclinical and clinical settings1–5. We recently revealed a hidden intrinsic therapeutic effect 
of the FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticle compound ferumoxytol on ‘untreated’ 
tumours: tumour cells co-injected with ferumoxytol exhibited a markedly delayed growth 
rate compared with tumour cells injected without addition of ferumoxytol. Here, we 
elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms that led to the observed tumour growth inhibition 
by ferumoxytol.
It is well known that systemically or locally administered nanoparticles are internalized by 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumour microenvironment2. This effect has 
been utilized to image tumour response to immune-modulating cancer therapies with 
diagnostic nanoparticles3,4,6 or to shuttle nanoparticle-conjugated therapeutic drugs to 
tumours7,8.However, the intrinsic impact of nanoparticles on macrophage physiology is not 
well understood. We hypothesized that ferumoxytol nanoparticles inhibited cancer growth 
by inducing a pro-inflammatory immune response with M1 macrophage polarization. Since 
iron oxide nanoparticles are increasingly used in clinical practice for cancer diagnosis9, 
cancer therapy10 and anaemia treatment11, effects of nanoparticles on the tumour 
microenvironment would have immediate and broad clinical implications.
Results
Effects of ferumoxytol on cancer cells and macrophages in vitro
We incubated several malignant and non-malignant cell types with ferumoxytol (0–30 mg 
ml−1) for 24 h, and measured cell death via caspase-3/7 activity. The results revealed no 
direct cytotoxic effects of ferumoxytol at 3 mg Fe ml−1 (Supplementary Fig. 1), which is 
equivalent to locally administered doses in vivo (2.73 mg Fe ml−1, see below) and the 
calculated plasma concentration after a typical intravenous injection of 5–10 mg kg−1 in 
rodents12. MMTV PyMT-derived mammary carcinoma cells did not exhibit any significant 
change in caspase-3 expression up to 12 mg Fe ml−1 ferumoxytol. Thus, ferumoxytol 
demonstrated no direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells at clinically relevant doses.
To determine whether ferumoxytol nanoparticles attract macrophages, we investigated their 
chemotactic properties in vitro13. It has been previously reported that nanoparticles attract 
alveolar macrophages14. Using a dual-chamber transwell system with 3-µm-sized 
microporous membranes (macrophages are able to migrate through 3-µm pores), we 
evaluated the migration of DiD-labelled macrophages towards ferumoxytol nanoparticles, 
malignant cells, or both (Supplementary Fig. 2). Ferumoxytol and tumour cells attracted 
macrophages, and their combination led to an additive effect on macrophage recruitment (P 
< 0.05).

 It has been reported that pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in wounds release hydrogen 
peroxides, which elicit iron to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH•) via the Fenton 
reaction15. To investigate if the Fenton reaction occurred in our co-cultures, we measured the 
level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cancer cell apoptosis in co-cultures of MMTV-
PyMT cancer cells and macrophages, incubated with or without ferumoxytol. We found 
significantly increased caspase-3 expression by cancer cells incubated with macrophages 
plus ferumoxytol, compared with cancer cells incubated with either macrophages or 
ferumoxytol alone (P < 0.05; Fig. 1a–c). Co-cultures of cancer cells, macrophages and 
ferumoxytol demonstrated an 11-fold increase in hydrogen peroxide and a 16-fold increase 
in hydroxyl radical production compared with co-cultures of cancer cells and macrophages 
alone (P < 0.05; Fig. 1d,e). Thus, ferumoxytol enhances the production of ROS by 
macrophages, which increases cancer cell cytotoxicity.
Next, we treated cancer cells in the bottom chamber with 100 µM caspase-3 inhibitor to 
block apoptosis and noted a six- and sevenfold decrease in hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl 
radicals, respectively (Fig. 1d,e). This suggests an additive effect of dying cancer cells on 
macrophage activation and ROS production.
To further determine if ferumoxytol nanoparticles induce M1 macrophages, we isolated 
macrophages from above described co-cultures and audited their transcriptomes for 
expression differences of M1- versus M2-type mRNAs via quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR). This analysis revealed that ferumoxytol-exposed macrophages 
upregulated M1-related TNFα and CD86 markers (Fig. 1f) significantly compared with 
macrophages only (P < 0.05). In addition, mRNA levels of M2-related CD206 and IL10 
markers were significantly decreased after exposure to ferumoxytol (P < 0.05). Similarly, an 
ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) of ferumoxytol-exposed cancer cell and 
macrophage co-cultures demonstrated a significantly increased production of tumour-
necrosis factor-α (TNFα), a classical M1 marker (Fig. 1g, P = 0.021), but no significant 
production of M2-related interleukin-10 (IL-10) (Fig. 1h). This suggests that ferumoxytol-
induced cancer cytotoxicity is coupled to M1 macrophage polarization.
In vivo inhibition of mammary tumour growth
To determine if ferumoxytol exposure would impact tumour growth in vivo, we implanted 
2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells into the bilateral mammary fat pads of female 
FVB/N mice, with or without addition of ferumoxytol (2.73 mg Fe ml−1; group 1, see 
Methods). We found significantly suppressed tumour growth (57% at 21 days post-
inoculation; P = 0.038) of ferumoxytol co-implanted cancer cells compared with non-
ferumoxytol-treated controls (Fig. 2a). Tumour growth inhibition was the same for both high 
(8.37 mg Fe ml−1; group 2) and low (2.73 mg Fe ml−1; group 1) concentrations of 
ferumoxytol (tumour size 53% at day 21 compared with controls; Fig. 2a) (P = 0.070). 
Tumour growth was suppressed by ferumoxytol, without significant dose response at the 
given concentrations.
To investigate the possible role of the carboxymethyldextran coating of ferumoxytol 
nanoparticles, we compared tumour growth inhibition effects of ferumoxytol with the 
dextran-coated nanoparticle compound ferumoxtran-10 (Sinerem/Combidex, group 3).

 Results showed significant tumour growth inhibition of both ferumoxytol- and 
ferumoxytran-10 co-implanted cancer cells when compared with controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 2b) 
without any significant difference between the two compounds (P > 0.05). Additional mice 
were co-implanted with low-molecular-weight dextran (50 mg ml−1) and cancer cells (group 
7, see Methods). Results showed no significant effect of iron-free dextran on tumour growth 
inhibition when compared with untreated controls (P > 0.05; Fig. 2b). Therefore, the coating 
of ferumoxytol does not play a significant role in tumour inhibition.
It has been reported that when multiple tumours are present in the same subject, one tumour 
can affect another tumour’s growth through competition for vascular supply and the 
expression of cytokines and growth factors16. To exclude the possibility of cross-talk 
between multiple tumours within the same animal, 14 FVB/N mice received unilateral 
injections of either 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells (n = 7 mice) or cancer cells 
plus 100 µl of ferumoxytol (2.73 mg Fe ml−1; n = 7 mice) into the mammary fat pad of the 
left lower abdomen (group 4, see Methods). Results confirmed significant growth inhibition 
of cancer cells co-implanted with ferumoxytol compared with cancer cells alone (P < 0.05; 
Fig. 2c). Within each group, there was no significant difference in tumour volumes of mice 
with unilateral or bilateral tumours (P > 0.05).
To evaluate if ferumoxytol co-injection could completely suppress tumour growth, we 
implanted decreasing quantities of MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells (2.3, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 × 
106) with ferumoxytol at a concentration of 2.73 mg Fe ml−1 into 21 additional mice (group 
5, see Methods). Tumour formation was investigated by near-infrared fluorescence optical 
imaging using the IVIS Spectrum optical imaging system at 2, 7, 14 and 21 days, followed 
by histopathological evaluation. We found significant tumour growth inhibition for all 
ferumoxytol-treated mice compared with untreated controls, with maximum tumour growth 
inhibition for the lowest quantity of ferumoxytol-exposed cancer cells (0.01 × 106; 
Supplementary Fig. 3).
Ferumoxytol nanoparticles can be detected and quantified with magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging based on their effects on tissue T2* relaxation times17. To correlate tumour growth 
inhibition with ferumoxytol metabolization, we measured T2* relaxation times of 
ferumoxytol-co-implanted MMTV-PyMT cancers and controls (group 1, see Methods). 
Local administration of ferumoxytol induced a marked hypointense (dark) signal effect at 
the implantation sites on T2*-weighted MR images (Fig. 2e), which was significantly lower 
than the T2* signal of ipsilateral muscle (P < 0.05) and contralateral control cancers (P < 
0.05). T2* relaxation times at the co-implantation sites increased gradually over 21 days 
after ferumoxytol administration (P < 0.05), which coincided with slow iron metabolization 
and developing tumours (Fig. 2d). Thus, the inhibitory effect of ferumoxytol on cancer 
growth is limited by ferumoxytol metabolism.
Ferumoxytol-treated tumours and untreated controls (group 1, see Methods), were evaluated 
by multicolour flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence analysis of 
tumour sections obtained at day 7 after implantation showed increased presence of CD80+ 
cells within ferumoxytol-co-implanted tumours compared with controls, representing 
increased quantities of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in ferumoxytol-co-implanted

 cancers (Fig. 3a,d). Later-stage tumours, 21 days after implantation, demonstrated high 
quantities of CD206+ cells in both ferumoxytol-treated and untreated cancers (Fig. 3b,d), 
suggesting an M2-type macrophages in the ferumoxytol-treated group.
MMTV-PyMT tumours were detectable as 4–5-mm subcutaneous nodules at day 14 after 
implantation. At this time, CD45-positive immune cell infiltrates were detected in both 
ferumoxytol-co-injected cancers and untreated controls. We evaluated immune cell subsets 
by FACS analyses at day 14 and 21, using a combination of lineage markers as shown in 
Fig. 3c. At day 14 after implantation, early-stage tumours of the control group contained 
leukocyte infiltrates dominated by TAMs (CD3−CD9b−CD19−CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6C−F4/80+), 
with minor populations of T cells, B cells, monocytes and natural killer cells. In comparison, 
the ferumoxytol co-injected group demonstrated a higher quantity of monocytes and TAMs 
(Fig. 3e). This difference diminished in later-stage tumours at day 21.
To prove that tumour growth in our MMTV-PYMT mouse model was driven by TAMs, 
another group of mice (n = 7; group 6, see Methods) was treated with anti-colony 
stimulating factor monoclonal antibody (α-CSF1 mAb), which depletes TAMs2. We found 
significant tumour growth inhibition in both α-CSF1 mAb and ferumoxytol co-implanted 
tumours compared with untreated controls (P > 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 4), even though 
the underlying mechanisms were different: depletion of TAMs in α-CSF1 mAb co-
implanted tumours and M1 macrophage activation in ferumoxytol co-implanted tumours. As 
expected, there was no significant synergistic effect of α-CSF1 mAb and ferumoxytol 
treatment. Control mice (n = 7 mice per group) receiving cancer cells plus immunoglobulin-
G (IgG), or cancer cells plus 2.73 mg ml−1 ferumoxytol plus IgG showed no significant 
tumour growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 4a). These results further validate TAM-
dependent mechanisms of tumour growth inhibition.
Inhibition of metastases in the liver and lungs
To evaluate whether ferumoxytol has similar therapeutic benefit when delivered systemically 
to mice with visceral metastases, we investigated a second mouse model of small-cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) liver metastases18. We chose the liver as the target organ, because it 
accumulates high concentrations of intravenously administered iron oxide nanoparticles. 2 × 
104 KP1-GFP-Luc cells were intravenously injected into NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ 
mice and allowed to grow for 1 week, at which time tumour formation in the liver was 
confirmed by bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 4a). Then, ferumoxytol at a dose of 10 mg Fe 
kg−1 or saline (control) was administered intravenously, followed by serial bioluminescence 
imaging up to day 14. Ferumoxytol-treated mice demonstrated significantly inhibited 
tumour bioluminescence and significantly decreased total histopathologic tumour load 
compared with untreated control mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 4b).
Systemic delivery of ferumoxytol also significantly reduced pulmonary metastasis in the 
same mouse model (Fig. 4c). This was associated with significant increase of interstitial 
macrophages (CD11bhighCD11cint) in the lungs of ferumoxytol-injected mice while the 
amount of pro-inflammatory Ly6C+ monocytes (CD11bhigh, CD11cneg), alveolar 
macrophages (CD11chigh, CD11bneg) and lung dendritic cells (CD11cintCD11bint) remained 
constant (Fig. 4d,e). Most importantly, lung macrophages showed a significant loss of the

 M2 marker CD206 in the treatment group, which could indicate M1 polarization (Fig. 4f). 
Ferumoxytol was also effective in inhibiting established liver tumours in a TAM-dependent 
manner.
In vivo prevention of hepatic metastasis
To provide an immediate practical application of our findings, we next sought to prevent 
liver tumour formation by pretreatment with ferumoxytol, using the above-described mouse 
model of SCLC liver metastases18. We pretreated NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice 
with three ferumoxytol tail-vein injections at a dose of 10 mg Fe kg−1 and an interval of 4 
days, followed by intravenous injection of 1 × 104 KP1-GFP-Luc cells. Non-ferumoxytol-
treated mice served as controls (Fig. 5a,b). Ferumoxytol-pretreated mice showed 
significantly reduced tumour formation in the liver, as quantified by significantly lower liver 
photon flux values compared with untreated controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 5c,d,i). Histopathology 
confirmed a significant reduction of tumour lesions in ferumoxytol-treated livers compared 
with the untreated controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 5e–h,j). Flow cytometry analyses revealed 
increased quantities of CD11bhighF4/80low macrophages in ferumoxytol-pretreated mice 
compared to untreated controls (Fig. 6a,c,d). The tumour load was 6 times lower in 
ferumoxytol-treated animals compared with control animals (Fig. 6b and Supplementary 
Fig. 5). Further, the polarization of infiltrating macrophages shifted towards M1 phenotypes 
(Fig. 6f), whereas tissue-resident macrophages lost their M2 polarization (Fig. 6e). Thus, 
pretreatment with ferumoxytol can inhibit tumour metastases.
Discussion
Our data demonstrate that ferumoxytol nanoparticles significantly suppressed tumour growth 
by inducing pro-inflammatory macrophage responses. Since ferumoxytol is FDA-approved 
for treatment of iron deficiency19, it could be applied ‘off label’ to protect the liver from 
metastatic seeds and potentiate TAM-modulating cancer immunotherapies in patients.
Elemental iron plays a complex role in both progression and suppression of 
malignancies20,21. Low doses of iron ions are essential for cell replication and DNA 
synthesis22. However, iron overexposure can lead to an increased incidence of human 
cancers through increased oxidative stress and DNA damage20,23. Thus, it seems logical to 
counteract this process by iron depletion. In fact, iron depletion has led to tumour growth 
arrest in mouse models24. Conversely, high iron doses have been reported to have direct 
cytotoxic effects on malignant tumours in vitro25 and in vivo26–28. However, clinically 
approved nanoparticles are produced with semi-synthetic coatings that minimize direct toxic 
effects. Ferumoxytol is coated with carboxymethyldextran, which leads to low toxicity29 and 
lysosomal uptake and degradation30, with little or no effect on cell function and viability31.
Our data show that ferumoxytol nanoparticles rather cause tumour growth inhibition through 
indirect effects on the tumour microenvironment: monocytes are recruited to malignant 
tumours through local expression of chemotactic cytokines32 and are typically polarized to 
anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes33. Previous in vitro studies showed that 
superparamagnetic iron oxides induce a phenotypic shift in M2 macrophages towards a high 
CD86+, TNFα positive M1 macrophage subtype34. This M1 polarization can induce a

 Fenton reaction15. Our data showed that the Fenton reaction can induce cancer cell 
apoptosis. Continued M1 polarization triggered by apoptotic cancer cells can then create an 
autocrine feedback loop that maintains the production of TNFα and nitric oxide (NO)35.
It has been found15 that in wound healing iron exposure leads to M1 polarization and that 
concomitant anti-inflammatory M2 responses are overpowered. The value of CD206 as a 
marker for M2 macrophages, used in our study and in ref. 15, is controversial and might be 
tissue-specific15. In the study described in ref. 36, tumour-promoting macrophages with a 
CD206 expression marker were not detected, but rather a CD11bhi MHCII+ population 
derived from inflammatory monocytes. We confirmed M1 polarization in our tumours by 
significant expression of M1-associated genes.
Potential clinical applications of ferumoxytol-mediated proinflammatory immune responses 
could entail potentiating the efficacy of other M1-activating cancer immunotherapies, such 
as anti-CD47 mAbs (ref. 37) or antibodies blocking IL-4 or IL-13 signalling38. In addition, 
ferumoxytol could be locally delivered to unresectable tumours via interventional 
procedures, to micrometa-stases in confined spaces (for example, peritoneal seeds) or to 
tumour resection margins at the end of a tumour surgery with positive resection margins. 
Finally, patients with primary tumours that typically metastasize to the liver could receive 
protective ferumoxytol medications to prevent early metastatic seeds. Ferumoxytol can be 
conjugated or functionalized to anciliary molecules to further amplify the desired immune-
modulating properties39,40.
The current recommended dose of ferumoxytol (Feraheme) for the treatment of anaemia is 
510 mg iron, followed by a second administration of 510 mg iron 3–8 days later. 
Ferumoxytol should not be administered to patients with signs of iron overload19,41. But it 
has been shown that ferumoxytol does not cause liver toxicity in animal models42 or 
patients19. Feraheme is typically metabolized within 6–8 weeks19. Therefore, maintenance 
treatment could continue in 2–3 month intervals. Future studies have to show if ferumoxytol 
can suppress liver metastases in patients. Of note, there is a large population of patients with 
liver metastases who received similar iron oxide nanoparticle compounds, it would be 
worthwhile to review their imaging studies and clinical outcomes.
Conclusions
We discovered an intrinsic therapeutic effect of ferumoxytol on cancer growth due to 
macrophage polarization into pro-inflammatory M1 phenotypes. These results have major 
implications for diagnostic and therapeutic applications of iron oxide nanoparticles. Because 
ferumoxytol is FDA-approved, our approach is immediately accessible for cancer patients 
through ‘off label’ use19.

 Cell culture
MMTV-PyMT (mouse mammary tumour virus - Polyoma middle T antigen) mammary 
cancer cells were isolated from 90- to 95-day-old transgenic MMTV-PyMT mice. MDA-
MB-468 human breast carcinoma cells, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, RAW264.7 
macrophages, human dermal fibroblasts (ATCC, PCS-201–012) and human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC; Bethesda, MD, USA). These cell lines are not listed in the database of commonly 
misidentified cell lines maintained by ICLAC and were directly purchased from ATCC. All 
cell lines used in this study are quarterly authenticated by unique STR profile and results 
indicated no cross-contamination. All cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified 
Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Human fibroblasts 
were maintained in fibroblast basal media (Gibco), supplemented with a fibroblast growth 
kit (Gibco). HUVECs were grown in endothelial basal medium (Clonetics) supplemented 
with SingleQuots (Clonetics) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Murine and human cancer cells were incubated with ferumoxytol nanoparticles and cell 
cytotoxicity was evaluated using the SensoLyte Homogeneous AMC Caspase-3/7 assay kit 
(AnaSpec, Fremont, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 × 
105 cells per well were treated with ferumoxytol at various concentrations for 6 h. Then, 50 
µl per well of AMC caspase 3/7 substrate solution was added to the cells and incubated at 
room temperature for 30 min. The fluorescent signal was measured by a fluorescence 
microplate reader (FlexStation II384, MolecularDevice, CA) with excitation/emission 354 
nm/442 nm, cutoff 430 nm. Results were expressed as n-fold increases in caspase activity 
compared with untreated controls (defined as 1). For each concentration of ferumoxytol, a 
Student’s t-test was employed to determine the significance of caspase 3/7 activity levels 
between different cell samples. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate 
statistically significant differences.
Animal model
Animal handling, surveillance, and experimentation were performed in accordance with and 
approval from the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care 
(protocol no. 24965). FVB/N mice were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, 
USA) and NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory 
(Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Ninety-eight 8–10-week-old female FVB/N mice were randomly 
divided into seven groups, which were implanted with MMTV-PyMT cancer cells and/or 
ferumoxytol nanoparticles into 1 or more mammary fat pads, followed by daily tumour size 
measurements with a caliper for 7–21 days, followed by histopathological evaluation.
Group 1—To evaluate whether local ferumoxytol administration causes tumour growth 
inhibition, 21 FVB/N mice were implanted with 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer 
cells into the left mammary fat pad and 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells co-
injected with 100 µl ferumoxytol at a concentration of 2.73 mg Fe ml−1 into the right 
mammary fat pads (9.1 µl ferumoxytol at a concentration of 30 mg Fe ml−1 in 90.9 µl of

 cancer cells in PBS). Cancer growth was monitored for up to 7 days (n = 7 mice), 14 days (n 
= 7 mice) and 21 days (n = 7 mice) after implantation, followed by histopathology.
Group 2—To evaluate effects of different ferumoxytol concentrations, seven additional 
FVB/N mice were implanted with 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-cancer cells into the left 
mammary fat pads and an equal number of cells plus 100 µl of ferumoxytol at a 
concentration of 8.37 mg Fe ml−1 into the right mammary fat pads.
Group 3—To evaluate effects of different nanoparticle compositions, seven additional 
FVB/N mice were implanted with 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells into the left 
mammary fat pads and 2.3 × 106 of MMTV-PyMT cancer cells plus 100 µl of 
ferumoxtran-10 (Sinerem/Combidex; 2.73 mg Fe ml−1) into the right mammary fat pads.
Group 4—To exclude the possibility that tumours in the same animal interact with each 
other, a set of 14 FVB/N mice were implanted unilaterally with either 2.3 × 106 MMTV-
PyMT-derived cancer cells (n = 7) or cancer cells plus 100 µl of ferumoxytol (2.73 mg Fe 
ml−1; n = 7).
Group 5—To determine which tumour cell quantity could be completely suppressed by 
ferumoxytol treatment, 21 additional FVB/N mice were implanted with decreasing 
quantities of cancer cells (1 × 106 (n = 7), 0.1 × 106 (n = 7) and 0.01 × 106 (n = 7)) into the 
left mammary fat pads and the same quantity of MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells plus 100 
µl of ferumoxytol (2.73 mg Fe ml−1) into the right mammary fat pads. To monitor tumour 
formation, all mice underwent near-infrared fluorescence optical imaging after intravenous 
injection of 100 µl of indocyanine green (ICG, Acros Organics, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 50 
µM), using the IVIS Spectrum Optical Imaging System (Xenogen Corporation, Caliper Life 
Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA) with an excitation filter of 745 nm, an emission filter of 
820 nm, and an exposure time of 1 s. Fluorescence data were processed using Living Image 
software (version 4.3.1, Perkin Elmer, MA, USA).
Group 6—To evaluate the effect of macrophages on tumour growth, seven additional 
FVB/N mice were implanted with 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells into the left 
mammary fat pad and 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer plus 100 µl ferumoxytol (2.73 
mg Fe ml−1) into the right mammary fat pad. After tumour cell implantation, mice were 
treated with anti-colony stimulating factor (CSF)-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), clone 5A1 
(ATCC, USA) at a total dose of 2 mg, consisting of an initial dose of 1 mg followed by 0.5 
mg chaser doses on days 5 and 8. Two additional groups of mice (n = 7 mice per group) 
served as controls by receiving cancer cells + IgG (IgG1 Isotype control, Bio X Cell, USA) 
and cancer cells + ferumoxytol + IgG.
Group 7—To address whether the ferumoxytol-induced tumour growth inhibition is 
specific to the iron oxide core of ferumoxytol nanoparticles, seven additional FVB/N mice 
were implanted with 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells into the left mammary fat 
pad and 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells plus 100 µl dextran (FD10S; 
Molecular Weight 10,000 Da; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 50 mg 
ml−1.

 Statistical analyses
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Comparison between two groups was 
performed using paired or unpaired t-tests. Multiple experimental groups were compared by 
a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by an appropriate post-hoc test. Results 
were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05. All in vitro work has been repeated 
at least three times by independent experiments. The sample size was not predetermined in 
in vitro studies. Sample sizes for animal studies were estimated and randomization was 
applied. Blinding was used for group allocation between the non-ferumoxytol control group 
and ferumoxytol treatment group.

 Figure 1. Combining ferumoxytol and macrophages leads to cancer cell apoptosis through the 
Fenton reaction
RAW264.7 macrophages were co-cultured with MMTV-PyMT cancer cells in a transwell 
system for 24 h, with or without ferumoxytol (2.73 mg ml−1). Macrophages in the upper 
chamber and cancer cells in the lower chamber were separated by a 0.4-µm-sized 
microporous membrane, which allowed for exchange of molecules, but not cells. Cancer 
cells in the lower chamber were stained for caspase expression using green fluorescent

 Figure 2. Iron oxide nanoparticles inhibit tumour growth
Mice were implanted with 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells in the mammary fat 
pad with and without ferumoxytol. a, Ferumoxytol inhibited tumour growth compared with 
untreated controls at two different local Fe concentrations of 2.73 mg Fe ml−1 (n = 7 mice) 
and 8.37 mg Fe ml−1 (n = 7 mice). Data are displayed as mean tumour volume of seven 
tumours per group. b, Tumour growth was significantly inhibited compared with untreated 
controls by two different iron oxide nanoparticle compounds, ferumoxytol (n = 7 mice) and 
ferumoxytran-10 (n = 7 mice). No significant tumour growth inhibition was observed after 
injection of dextran only (negative control). Data are displayed as mean tumour volume of 
seven tumours per group. In a,b, error bars represent standard deviation. c, To exclude cross-
talk of two tumours in the same mouse, mice were either implanted unilaterally or bilaterally 
with 2.3 × 106 MMTV-PyMT-derived cancer cells in the mammary fat pad, with and without 
co-implantation of ferumoxytol at a concentration of 2.73 mg Fe ml−1. Each data point 
represents the mean tumour volume of seven mice ± standard deviation. No significant 
difference in tumour volume was observed between mice inoculated unilaterally and those 
inoculated bilaterally. One-way ANOVA was used to compare data of ferumoxytol-treated 
groups and controls (P < 0.05, n = 7 mice per group). d, Corresponding serial quantitative 
MR signal of ferumoxytolco-implanted and untreated cancer inoculation sites, as quantified 
by mean T2* relaxation rates of seven tumours in each group and standard deviation. 
Paraspinal muscle served as internal control. A slow decline in T2* shortening at the co-
implantation site, apparently due to local iron metabolization, coincides with tumour growth. 
e, Corresponding representative T2*-weighted axial gradient echo MR images. Red arrows 
indicate ferumoxytol-induced negative (dark) T2* signal effects at cancer-ferumoxytol co-
implantation sites and black arrows indicate lack of T2* signal effects at cancer implantation 
only sites. Tumour growth is delayed at the ferumoxytol-cancer cell co-implantion site. One-
way ANOVA was used to compare results of different experimental groups for statistically 
significant difference (P < 0.05).

 Figure 4. Systemic delivery of ferumoxytol inhibits liver and lung metastases
Mice were intravenously injected with 2 × 104 KP1-GFP-Luc cancer cells. a, Seven days 
later, seven mice each received a single intravenous injection of ferumoxytol at a dose of 10 
mg Fe kg−1 or no treatment, followed by serial bioluminescence imaging studies in weekly 
intervals. At baseline (week 1) both ferumoxytol-treated and control mice demonstrated 
equal liver bioluminescence, indicative of equal tumour burden. However, follow-up 
imaging studies at weeks 2 and 3 demonstrated diminished tumour bioluminescence of 
treated livers compared with controls. b, Corresponding quantitative liver luminescence of 
ferumoxytol-treated and control mice, displayed as mean data of seven mice in each group 
and standard deviation. c, FACS analysis of lung tissue of the same mice, gated on 
CD45−GFP+ live singlets to assess tumour load in control (left) and ferumoxytol-treated 
(right) Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Tumour load was significantly reduced in 
the treated group. d, Characterization of lung macrophages/dendritic cells in control (left) 
and ferumoxytol-treated (right) NSG mice with metastatic disease showed a significant 
increase of interstitial lung macrophages under treatment; subsets (gated on CD45+ Ly6G− 
live singlets) were characterized based on CD11b and CD11c expression as interstitial 
macrophages (CD11bhighCD11cint), inflammatory monocytes (CD11bhigh,CD11cneg), 
alveolar macrophages (CD11chigh,CD11bneg) and lung dendritic cells (CD11cintCD11bint). 
e, The frequencies of infiltrating Ly6C+ lung monocytes (gated on CD45+ Ly6G− live 
singlets) did not differ in the control and ferumoxytol-treated groups. f, M1- and M2-
polarization phenotypes of CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ cells in control and ferumoxytol-treated 
lung macrophages indicates a significant reduction of CD206 expression on treatment.

 Figure 6. Ferumoxytol alters macrophage polarization in hepatic metastasis in vivo
a, Livers of the same mice described in Fig. 5 were further analysed with FACS for 
infiltrating leukocyte populations. b, Accordingly, the relative number of GFP+ cells within 
the liver gate (%) was significantly reduced in ferumoxytol-treated livers compared with 
untreated controls. c, CD11blowF4/80high tissue-resident macrophages were increased in 
ferumoxytol-treated livers compared to controls and d, CD11bhighF4/80low peripheral-
