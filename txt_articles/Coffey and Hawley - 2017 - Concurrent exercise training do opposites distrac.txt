Abstract Specificity is a core principle of exercise training to promote the desired adaptations for
maximising athletic performance. The principle of specificity of adaptation is underpinned by the
volume,intensity,frequencyandmodeofcontractileactivityandismostevidentwhencontrasting
the divergent phenotypes that result after undertaking either prolonged endurance or resistance
training. The molecular profiles that generate the adaptive response to different exercise modes
have undergone intense scientific scrutiny. Given divergent exercise induces similar signalling and
gene expression profiles in skeletal muscle of untrained or recreationally active individuals, what
is currently unclear is how the specificity of the molecular response is modified by prior training
history. The time course of adaptation and when ‘phenotype specificity’ occurs has important
implications for exercise prescription. This context is essential when attempting to concomitantly
develop resistance to fatigue (through endurance-based exercise) and increased muscle mass
(through resistance-based exercise), typically termed ‘concurrent training’. Chronic training
studies provide robust evidence that endurance exercise can attenuate muscle hypertrophy and
strength but the mechanistic underpinning of this ‘interference’ effect with concurrent training
is unknown. Moreover, despite the potential for several key regulators of muscle metabolism
to explain an incompatibility in adaptation between endurance and resistance exercise, it now
seems likely that multiple integrated, rather than isolated, effectors or processes generate the
interference effect. Here we review studies of the molecular responses in skeletal muscle and
evidence for the interference effect with concurrent training within the context of the specificity
of training adaptation.

mode or concurrent endurance- and resistance-based exercise and transition from untrained to trained status. The
exercise stimulus initially generates a ‘general adaptation profile’, but as training continues ‘specificity of adaptation’
responses are generated and there is incompatibility and adaptation interference with concurrent training whereby
endurance training attenuates hypertrophy/strength. The precise time course and molecular events underpinning these
processes are presently unknown.

Introduction
Athletic
events
are
broadly
classified
as
either
‘endurance-based’ or ‘strength–power-based’, with the
one-dimensional demands underlying these divergent
performance capacities imposing an uncomplicated
stimulus for adaptation. Training to increase end-
urance capacity can be achieved through prolonged
(>60 min), continuous or repeated intermittent bouts
of submaximal contractions that, when performed for
several months or years, elicit a variety of metabolic
and morphological adaptations including mitochondrial
biogenesis, fast-to-slow fibre-type transformation and
shifts in substrate metabolism that favour fat- over
carbohydrate-based fuels (Holloszy & Coyle, 1984;
Hawley, 2002). In contrast, training to increase strength
and/or power requires short duration (<60 s) maximal
contractile activity and heavy resistance loading to
stimulate the synthesis of myofibrillar proteins and muscle
hypertrophy(Damasetal.2015).Suchtraining,evenwhen
performed over several months or years, elicits little or no
change to the oxidative profile of the trained muscles, nor
major shifts in the patterns of fuel utilisation (MacDougall
et al. 1982).
There are, however, numerous athletic disciplines
where a combination of both muscular endurance and
strength/power are required for successful performance.
Under such circumstances endurance and resistance

training are undertaken concomitantly as part of a peri-
odised training programme (i.e. ‘concurrent training’).
In the context of this review, concurrent training is
used generically to describe a single training session
during which an individual performs both endurance-
and resistance-based exercise, and/or when an athlete
incorporates both types of training on different occasions
as part of a periodised training programme. During
concurrent training, muscle is repeatedly subjected to
divergent contractile stimuli and the specificity of the
adaptive response is altered to such an extent that
gains in hypertrophy, strength and power are typically
attenuated compared to when resistance training is under-
taken in isolation (Wilson et al. 2012). The simultaneous
development of muscular endurance and strength/power
arguably represents the highest complexity in exercise pre-
scription, while from a molecular perspective it is an
intriguing challenge to dissect the mechanistic bases for
the interference effect on adaptive responses with contra-
sting contractile stimuli.
Concurrent exercise training: evidence for an
‘interference’ effect
Thirty-five years ago Dr Robert Hickson demonstrated
impaired strength development in previously untrained
males who incorporated both strength and endurance
workouts into a 10 week training programme (Hickson,
1980). Hickson termed the impaired strength gains with
concurrent strength and endurance training the ‘inter-
ference effect’. Since that seminal work, the results from
the majority of studies confirm that gains in muscle hyper-
trophy and strength are compromised when strength- and
endurance-based training are undertaken concurrently
(Dudley & Djamil, 1985; Hunter et al. 1987; Hennessy
& Watson, 1994; Kraemer et al. 1995; Bell et al. 2000;
Putman et al. 2004; Chtara et al. 2008; Rønnestad et al.
2012; Jones et al. 2013). Even where the interference
effect has been unclear (McCarthy et al. 1995, 2002;
Balabinis et al. 2003; H¨
akkinen et al. 2003; Hendrickson
et al. 2010; Lundberg et al. 2013), this can typically be
attributed to the low volume and frequency of training
undertaken, a limited intervention period and/or the
training status of individuals under investigation. Indeed,
a meta-analysis of concurrent strength and endurance
training by Wilson and colleagues clearly demonstrates
the negative effect of endurance exercise on muscle hyper-
trophy, strength and power that occurs in a frequency-
and duration-dependent manner (Wilson et al. 2012).
The mode of exercise may also have an impact on the
magnitude of the interference effect with running likely to
have a greater negative effect on strength development
than cycling (Wilson et al. 2012), possibly due to the
eccentric component of running and concomitant muscle
damage. Of note is training-induced gains in aerobic
capacity are not compromised by concurrent strength and
endurance training.
In contrast to the impaired strength development
when endurance training is undertaken simultaneously
with resistance training, there is potential for combined
strength and endurance training to amplify endurance
performance (Rønnestad & Mujika, 2014). Hickson
and
co-workers
(Hickson
et
al.
1988)
combined
heavy-resistance workouts (3 sessions per week for
10 weeks) with the normal endurance training regimens
of trained runners and cyclists who were already at a
steady-state level of endurance performance. Despite no
changes in maximum oxygen uptake ( ˙
V
O2max) there was
a clear benefit of adding strength training to endurance
training for both short-term (4–8 min) running and
cycling performance and long-term (�80 min) endurance
cycling capacity.
The
data
from
concurrent
training
studies
demonstrating attenuated muscle hypertrophy/strength
compared to when resistance training is undertaken
alone has lead researchers to question the underlying
mechanism(s) responsible for this phenomenon. In this
regard, quantifying changes in performance capacity
and/or muscle morphology has failed to provide insight
as to ‘how’ and ‘when’ these divergent exercise modes
become discordant with respect to exercise-induced
adaptations (Leveritt et al. 1999). Knowledge of the
time course of the molecular and performance changes
occurring with concurrent strength and endurance
training in various populations (athletes, the elderly)
could provide valuable information for practitioners
when designing exercise programmes that require the
simultaneous development of muscular strength and
endurance (Leveritt et al. 1999; Coffey & Hawley,
2007; Fyfe et al. 2014). Clearly, the biology underlying
concurrent training responses may confer advantages
beyond the athletic arena and has ‘real world’ impact.
Are strength and endurance training molecularly
incompatible?
The molecular bases of skeletal muscle adaptations to
exercise (i.e. increased mitochondrial mass, altered sub-
strate metabolism, angiogenesis, or myofibre hyper-
trophy) involve increased expression and/or activity of
key proteins, mediated by an array of signalling events,
pre- and post-transcriptional processes, regulation of
translation and protein expression, and modulation
of
protein
(enzyme)
activities
and/or
intracellular
localisation (Hawley et al. 2014; Egan et al. 2016).
Multiple stimuli are associated with endurance- and
resistance-based exercise, various signalling kinases that
respond to these divergent stimuli, and numerous down-
stream pathways and targets of these kinases (Coffey &
Hawley, 2007; Egan & Zierath, 2013; Egan et al. 2016).

In addition, there is ‘cross-talk’ between these various
elements that combine to produce the integrated response
to an exercise challenge and ultimately result in functional
improvements and alterations in phenotype (Hawley et al.
2015; Egan et al. 2016). The various signalling pathways
involved in endurance- and resistance/strength-based
adaptation are numerous and have been reviewed in detail
elsewhere (Coffey & Hawley, 2007; Egan & Zierath, 2013;
Hawley et al. 2014). Briefly, endurance training adaptation
requires the stimulation of several transcription factors
(including nuclear respiratory factor-1 and -2 (NRF-1,
NRF-2)) that bind to their promoters and activate
the transcription of genes that encode mitochondrial
respiratory
chain
proteins.
Not
all
promoters
of
genes transcribing mitochondrial proteins have NRF
binding sites, so other transcription factors are involved
in
contractile-modulated
mitochondrial
biogenesis,
includingtheoestrogen-receptor-relatedreceptors(ERRs)
and
the
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
coactivators (PPARs), which regulate expression of
the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative enzymes. The
AMP-activated
protein
kinase
(AMPK)
and
p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are two other
important signalling cascades that converge upon the
regulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ
coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and consequently the regulation
of mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 1). Resistance training
adaptation is less defined than endurance training with
regard to specific signalling pathways or critical nodes that
are necessary to generate hypertrophy. The mechanistic
target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 has been
characterised as a focal point for hypertrophy with an
important role in contraction-induced increases in muscle
protein synthesis. The most well-defined effectors of
mTOR signalling are proteins implicated in translational
control: 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP)
(Philp et al. 2011) (Fig. 2).
We (Coffey et al. 2009a,b) and others (Jones et al. 2016)
have examined the acute effect of temporal proximity and
exercise order of resistance and endurance/high-intensity
exerciseboutsontranslationalsignallingandtranscription
of select genes implicated in exercise-induced adaptation
in recreationally trained humans. While we have observed
some differences in the magnitude of effect in kinase

and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), and mRNA content

Dashed lines show the primary sensors of contractile

(AMPK) is an energy sensing protein, reactive oxygen
species (ROS) are a metabolic by-product of oxidative
metabolism, which in concert with the p38 mitogen
activated protein kinase (MAPK) all respond to the
metabolic stress generated within skeletal muscle by
exercise. Modulation of cellular calcium concentration
with contraction upregulates calmodulin kinase
(CaMK) and/or calcineurin proteins, which also act as a
metabolic signal for adaptation responses. Together,
these intermediaries coordinate complex signalling
pathways regulating PGC-1α expression and
subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis
in skeletal muscle (Lira et al. 2010; Olesen et al. 2010).

responses in the ‘metabolic’ and ‘myogenic’ pathways
were often similar, regardless of exercise mode, and
any differences moderate (Coffey et al. 2009a,b). Jones
and colleagues (Jones et al. 2016) were also unable to
clearly differentiate between acute signalling responses
in human skeletal muscle with alternate concurrent
exercise order compared with resistance exercise alone.
The impact of exercise order notwithstanding, other
studies have compared molecular responses of combined
endurance and resistance exercise versus single-mode
exercise and show similar or enhanced signalling and
gene responses with concurrent exercise in moderately
trained or recreationally active individuals (Apro et al.
2013, 2015; Lundberg et al. 2014b; Kazior et al. 2016). An
important consideration when comparing the outcomes
of studies of single mode versus concurrent exercise
bouts is that more often than not, the contractile
stimulus to the working muscles (i.e. the total work
performed) is vastly different. In an attempt to mitigate
the influence of total work on acute molecular responses,
Donges and co-workers (Donges et al. 2013) studied
sedentary, middle-aged men who performed separate
single resistance and aerobic exercise bouts, and a
concurrent exercise bout comprising 50% of the total
work undertaken during each of the resistance and aerobic
exercise bouts. They reported no meaningful change in
S6K and AMPK phosphorylation between the different
exercise modes, comparable increases in skeletal muscle
myofibrillar protein synthesis with concurrent compared
with resistance exercise, and similar rates of mitochondrial
proteinsynthesisbetweenconcurrentandaerobicexercise.
The

also confounds information gained from investigations

promoting translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis
(Philp et al. 2011).

exercise modes. However, perhaps the primary factors
determining
the
molecular
profiles
generated
by
concurrent exercise are the training status of subjects
and inter-individual responses. We previously hypo-
thesised that training history would impact the concurrent
training response due to an underlying incompatibility
in the training-induced phenotype when undertaking
an opposing exercise stimulus (Coffey et al. 2006). To
investigate this we studied highly trained athletes with
a prolonged history of either endurance or strength
training (but not concurrent training) who performed
both an acute bout of exercise in their specialised
discipline and then ‘crossed over’ and undertook a
bout of unfamiliar exercise (Coffey et al. 2006). Muscle
biopsies were taken at rest, immediately, and 3 h
post exercise. AMPK phosphorylation increased after
cycling in strength-trained but not endurance-trained
subjects. Conversely, AMPK and S6K phosphorylation
was elevated after resistance exercise in endurance-
but not strength-trained subjects. These early signalling
responses to divergent exercise stimuli in skeletal muscle
from well-trained humans clearly demonstrate that prior
training history alters the exercise-specific signalling
responses involved in single mode adaptations to training
and that a degree of ‘response plasticity’ is conserved at
opposite ends of the endurance–hypertrophic adaptation
continuum.
Compared to trained athletes, untrained individuals
haveagreatercapacitytoactivatethemolecularmachinery
in muscle in response to contractile activity because any
overload stimulus induces large perturbations to cellular
homeostasis regardless of the mode of exercise (Benziane
et al. 2008; Perry et al. 2010; Nader et al. 2014). Given
the generic ‘molecular footprint’ generated in untrained
individuals in response to different exercise modes, it
seems reasonable to conclude that training history has
a large bearing on any molecular signature induced
by concurrent training (Fig. 3). In addition, individual
variation in both the molecular and functional responses
to exercise is likely to impact on the precision to detect
molecular incompatibility with concurrent training. The
characterisation of individual responses is not a new
phenomenon, but the results of studies of individuals
undertakingresistanceandendurancetraininginisolation
suggest that ‘low responders’ to each exercise stimulus may
be as high as 25% (Timmons et al. 2005; Phillips et al.
2013; Gurd et al. 2016). Intuitively, it might be expected
that the number of ‘low responders’ would double (or at
least increase) after concurrent compared to single mode
training, but the little data currently available suggest that
individuals are not systematically low or high responders
when exposed to different training stimuli (Karavirta et al.
2011). Nonetheless, the variation of human responses to
divergent stimuli adds complexity to the molecular bases
of the interference phenomenon.
The specificity of training adaptation in skeletal
muscle
Differences in the skeletal muscle phenotype and the
associated performance capacities of highly trained
endurance- compared to resistance-trained individuals
are clear (Coffey et al. 2006). These phenotypes result
from adaptation in response to the cumulative over-
load generated by individual bouts of exercise repeated
over days, months and years of training. Detailed
characterisation of the time course of adaptation over such
extended periods has proved difficult to study. Instead,
we are left with the results of investigations that have
determined acute responses or outcomes to short-term
training interventions (weeks to months) to underpin
our current understanding of the adaptation process. The
work of Perry and colleagues (Perry et al. 2010) provides
the first time course of molecular sequelae in human
skeletal muscle that accompany repetitive training stimuli.
These workers examined the time course of responses
of mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion/fission proteins,
along with selected transcriptional and mitochondrial
mRNAs and proteins in human skeletal muscle during
a �2 week intervention period in which individuals
performed seven bouts of high-intensity training. They
demonstrated that the repeated, transient increases in
mRNA induced after each exercise session were necessary
to elicit the sustained increases observed in the content
of transcription and metabolic proteins. Of note was
that even during such a short-term intervention, the
mRNA responses to exercise were attenuated as the muscle
adapted to the exercise challenge, even in the face of an
increasing training intensity. Increases in mitochondrial
proteins occurred within 5 days and following three
sessions of high-intensity interval training, while at the
end of the 2 weeks, ˙
V
O2max had also increased by 12%
(Perry et al. 2010). Similar characterisation of the chronic
timecourseofadaptationtoresistancetrainingiscurrently
lacking. Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider the
extent to which the molecular profiles generated in skeletal
muscle may differ following acute bouts of concurrent
exercise.
The work of Atherton and colleagues (Atherton et al.
2005) provided an elegant example of the specificity of
the adaptation response to divergent contractile overload,
albeit in rodent skeletal muscle, which is highly homo-
geneous with respect to fibre type and metabolic potential.
High frequency intermittent (60 × 3 s, 100 Hz) or low
frequency continuous (3 h, 10 Hz) electrical stimulation
was used to mimic resistance- or endurance-like over-
load. The results demonstrated that ‘resistance-like’ over-
load exclusively promoted an ‘anabolic signature’ but
little activation of the metabolic pathways involved
in upregulating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative
metabolism. In contrast, the endurance-like stimuli

resulted in a coordinated upregulation of metabolic
pathways with putative roles in mitochondrial biogenesis,
but little or no activation of the anabolic pathways.
To explain the specificity of adaptive responses to the
divergent contractile overload, the authors hypothesised
the existence of an ‘AMPK–protein kinase B (PKB) switch’.
However, since that study, there have been few data
from human exercise studies to support the hypothesis
of a simple ‘AMPK–PKB switch’ to explain specificity of
training adaptation.
Following the work of Atherton and co-workers
(Atherton et al. 2005), and in an attempt to explain
the molecular underpinning of the specificity of training,
AMPK and mTOR became focal points for many exercise
studies. There are a number of instances showing
that acute bouts of resistance and endurance exercise
generate similar post-exercise signalling responses in
skeletal muscle where endurance exercise upregulates
mTOR-mediated signalling (Mascher, 2007; Wilkinson
et al. 2008; Benziane et al. 2008; Camera et al.
2010) and resistance-based exercise increases AMPK
phosphorylation (Dreyer et al. 2006; Koopman et al. 2006;
Wilkinson et al. 2008). Furthermore, elevated AMPK
activity does not supress mTOR mediated signalling
when endurance exercise is undertaken prior to resistance
exercise (Apro et al. 2015). It would be easy to dismiss the
AMPK–PKB ‘switch’ hypothesis to explain the molecular
bases of training specificity and simply conclude that there
isaninabilitytoextrapolatethefindingsofanimalresearch
in humans. On the other hand, it could be argued that
the electrical stimulation model of contractile overload
employed by Atherton and colleagues (Atherton et al.
2005) and the subsequent molecular response observed
in rodent skeletal muscle are in fact more representative
of adaptation responses to the extreme regimens of highly
trained athletes than untrained individuals undertaking
low/moderate exercise loads.
The transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle induced
by resistance and endurance exercise also provide evidence
of similar molecular responses. Yang and co-workers
(Yang et al. 2005) and Louis and colleagues (Louis
et al. 2007) compared the acute time course of mRNA
content of metabolic, myogenic and proteolytic mRNA
targets after bouts of divergent exercise and show
gene profiles that are remarkably comparable for end-
urance running and resistance exercise. However, most
studies aimed at determining the adaptation response
of single exercise modes do not typically quantify

Figure 3. Hypothetical time course for skeletal muscle and functional adaptation from the untrained to
a trained state
In the first days/weeks when an individual commences training, the initial skeletal muscle adaptation responses
are similar between single mode and concurrent training adaptation as are any functional performance measures.
During this early phase the mechanosensors and subsequent mechanotransduction of the adaptive signal fail, at
least in part, to differentiate between the endurance- and resistance-like stimuli often undertaken at low–moderate
intensity and volume. As training progresses (i.e. months to years) repeated bouts of divergent exercise begin to
generate a specificity of training adaptation that initiates transformation of the skeletal muscle phenotype. The
change in phenotype coincides with the need for greater training loads to disrupt homeostasis and promote further
adaptation which results in impaired responses to concurrent training compared with single mode training. The
impaired adaptive response with concurrent versus single mode training is exacerbated with increasing training
history.

candidate gene expression of targets associated with
the ‘alternate’ type of exercise: such lack of measures
limit our current understanding of the specificity of
training. It is also becoming evident that individual gene
responses may not mirror chronic functional changes
in the muscle (i.e. increased protein abundance) and
the study of the phosphoproteome (Hoffman et al.
2015), transcriptome and functional gene clusters offer
a more powerful analytical approach to discovering
the unexplored complexity of acute exercise signalling.
While several studies have determined the transcriptome
response to resistance (Raue et al. 2012; Phillips et al.
2013; Thalacker-Mercer et al. 2013; Nader et al. 2014)
and endurance training (Timmons et al. 2005, 2010)
in untrained individuals over prolonged (6–20 week)
periods, a direct comparison between the transcriptome
profiles of resistance- and endurance-training-induced
gene expression has not been undertaken.
Despite the advancing knowledge of molecular changes
with specific exercise modes, fundamental questions
remain unanswered. Principal among them within the
contextofconcurrenttrainingiswhatisthetimecoursefor
adaptation to a ‘trained’ state and if/when does specificity
in adaptive responses occur in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3)?
If modest gains in muscle size can be achieved after
endurance training in untrained individuals (Konopka
& Harber, 2014) (Fig. 4A) but not trained cyclists
(Rønnestad et al. 2010) (Fig. 4B), and oxidative potential
can be enhanced by resistance training in the muscle
of untrained individuals (Tang et al. 2006) (Fig. 4A)
but decreases in powerlifters/bodybuilders (MacDougall
et al. 1982) (Fig. 4B), this has important implications for
understanding molecular responses and training induced
phenotype. It seems reasonable to suggest that when
previously sedentary or recreationally active individuals
commence any concurrent training programme, the
response to the two exercise modes is additive and
promotes a generic adaptation in the absence of a true
specificity of training effect. Accordingly, we propose
that the molecular bases for the ‘interference effect’ may
be indistinguishable in such individuals, particularly if
the total work in the single modes of training is not
matched. Given the practical difficulties associated with
accessingmusclebiopsies fromhighly trained athletes,and
differences in the modes and complexity of periodised
training for different sports, unravelling the molecular
bases for the interference effect will likely remain a
scientific conundrum for some time.
Potential molecular candidates to explain
the interference effect
The complexity of sensing and transducing a contra-
ctile stimulus and its subsequent conversion to a stable
molecular response dictates almost countless potential
sites of regulation of exercise-induced adaptation. The
AMPK signalling cascade has been considered a major
pathway through which endurance training-induced
responses may impair muscle hypertrophy and strength

capacity for the different exercise modes to promote adaptive responses associated with the ‘opposing’ exercise

training in untrained or recreationally active individuals. B, specificity of adaptation with prolonged, intense training
in well-trained athletes shows no significant ‘cross-over’ effects between exercise modes. Resistance training does
not impair continued development of oxidative metabolism and endurance capacity but endurance training
compromises gains in hypertrophy and strength with concurrent training (black/gray).

animal models provide compelling evidence for the
cross-talk between AMPK and mTOR signalling pathways,
and support the notion that activation of AMPK-related
pathways suppresses translation through decreased S6K
and 4E-BP phosphorylation (Bolster et al. 2002; Thomson
et al. 2008; Lantier et al. 2010; Egawa et al. 2014).
However, there is little evidence to support a direct
AMPK-induced impairment to rates of myofibrillar
protein synthesis and resistance training-induced muscle
hypertrophy in humans. This may be, in part, related to
the combination of limited muscle sampling time points
and the temporal patterns of activation of the various
signalling machinery. Complicating the issue is that
the AMPKα1 isoform has recently been associated with
promotingsatellitecellactivationandmuscleregeneration
(Fu et al. 2015), which contrasts the conventional role
of AMPK as a ‘metabolic sensor’ in skeletal muscle.
AMPK phosphorylation and activation has also been
demonstrated following acute bouts of resistance exercise
indicating that contraction-induced AMPK activation is
not solely restricted to an endurance-like training stimulus
(Dreyer et al. 2006; Koopman et al. 2006). For now it
appears safe to conclude that exercise-induced increases in
AMPK-signalling are not the sole moderators underlying
themolecularbasesoftheinterferenceeffectobservedwith
concurrent training.
PGC-1α
is
an
exercise-responsive
transcriptional
co-activator that has been described as a master
regulator of oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial
biogenesis, promoting many of the adaptations to end-
urance training in skeletal muscle (Hood, 2009). A
single bout of endurance exercise induces a rapid and
sustained increase in PGC-1α gene and protein in skeletal
muscle (Mathai et al. 2008), whereas muscle-specific
overexpression of PGC-1α results in a large increase
in functional mitochondria (Lin et al. 2002). The
specific proteins generated through expression of different
PGC-1α isoforms display differential regulation and
tissue distribution and, most importantly, exert specific
biological functions (Martinez-Redondo et al. 2015).
PGC-1α4, a transcript from the PGC-1α gene, is
abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and appears to
play a role in the adaptive response to exercise, particularly
in the setting of resistance training (Ruas et al. 2012; White
et al. 2014). This protein does not appear to regulate
the same set of oxidative genes induced by PGC-1α but,
rather, activates the expression of insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF-1) while concomitantly suppressing myo-
statin (an inhibitor of muscle cell differentiation and
growth) pathways. Accordingly, the PGC-1α protein and
PGC-1α4 isoform could play a role in modulating the
training response-adaptation after concurrent exercise. In
this regard, Ruas and co-workers (Ruas et al. 2012) have
shown that after training consisting of either endurance
exercise, resistance exercise, or a combination of both
endurance and resistance exercise, increases in PGC-1α4
are confined to resistance-only and combined exercise
training programmes, with no changes in this trans-
cript after endurance-only training (Ruas et al. 2012).
Few human studies have been undertaken to examine
the specificity of activation of the various PGC-1α iso-
forms. However, in contrast to the early results from Ruas
et al. (2012), others have failed to show a specificity of
adaptation response in PGC-1α isoforms with acute bouts
of endurance compared to resistance exercise or indeed
differences in expression with resistance versus concurrent
exercise bouts albeit in untrained individuals (Ydfors et al.
2013; Lundberg et al. 2014a). Of note, Nader et al. (Nader
et al. 2014) showed PGC-1α4 expression was not induced
in the muscle of untrained subjects in response to an acute
bout of resistance exercise undertaken at the beginning
of a 12 week training programme, but was selectively
upregulated by the same exercise session at the end of the
intervention period. Taken collectively, these data provide
further support that training status is a major regulator
of the molecular response to exercise, and suggest that
exercise-induced PGC-1α isoform specificity may provide
clues to mechanisms underlying the molecular bases of
the interference effect with concurrent training.
Satellite cells are niche stem cells located in skeletal
muscle with the capacity to promote adaptation through
the contribution of new myonuclei within existing muscle
fibres and/or myocytes that can fuse and form new myo-
fibres (Dumont et al. 2015). Accordingly, the role of
muscle satellite cells has generally been associated with the
hypertrophy response through regeneration and repair of
myofibres, and subsequent muscle growth. Babcock and
co-workers (Babcock et al. 2012) have undertaken the only
study to date to determine whether aerobic exercise might
attenuate satellite cell responses important to hypertrophy
within the concurrent training context. They found that a
conventional resistance exercise bout transiently increases
muscle fibre satellite cell density (�38%) after 4 days
recovery, but the addition of a 90 min cycling bout (�60%
maximal workload (Wmax)) undertaken immediately after
resistance exercise completely suppressed this response.
They proposed that the altered satellite cell response when
aerobic exercise is undertaken following resistance exercise
contributes to the interference effect with concurrent
exercise (Babcock et al. 2012). It should be noted that
resistance and aerobic exercise independently have the
potential to induce satellite cell responses for skeletal
muscle remodelling (Joanisse et al. 2013; Bellamy et al.
2014). Joanisse and colleagues (2013) have shown that
aerobic interval training (6 weeks, 3 sessions per week)
expands the muscle satellite cell pool and increases satellite
cell activity without subsequent hypertrophy, indicating
exercise-induced satellite cell activation in skeletal muscle
is not limited to resistance exercise. It may be that
the satellite cell activity generating non-hypertrophic

adaptation with endurance-based exercise compromises
the resistance exercise-induced satellite cell response for
hypertrophy. The different exercise modes also appear to
generate a fibre type specific satellite cell response which
may also increase the complexity in delineating its role in
the specificity of adaptation and any incompatibility with
concurrent training (Babcock et al. 2012; Joanisse et al.
2013; Bellamy et al. 2014). Consequently, more work is
neededtoelucidatethesatellitecellcontributiontoaerobic
and resistance training adaptation, and the potential to
modify the training response with concurrent training.
Advances in our understanding of how individual
genotype may determine athletic potential may also
influence the capacity to adapt to concurrent training. The
α-actinin-3 (ACTN3) gene has emerged as a candidate that
may influence exercise performance capacity. Early studies
of elite endurance- and strength/power-trained athletes
provided data indicating that ACTN3 gene deficiency,
which prevents its subsequent protein expression in
type II muscle fibres, may be unfavourable for the
development of muscular power but could promote an
endurance-like phenotype (Eynon et al. 2013, 2014).
Eynon and co-workers (Eynon et al. 2014) compared
the ACTN3 genotype of team sport athletes with end-
urance and power athletes. They showed the ACTN3
genotype (577RR) associated with muscular power was
under-represented in team sport compared with power
athletes, but that the distributions of the polymorphism
that may promote endurance capacity (R577X) were
similar between team sport and endurance athletes.
These findings are supported by Massidda and colleagues
(Massidda et al. 2015) who also showed that the ACTN3
genotype was not different between endurance and elite
team sport athletes. To better understand the potential
influence of genotype in determining exercise training
adaptation, invasive studies with large subject cohorts that
quantifythemagnitudeoftheadaptiveresponseassociated
with specific genotype following prolonged periods of
single mode and concurrent training would be required.
Nonetheless, as concurrent training is a prerequisite for
performance in many team sports, the potential for using
genetic screening to identify an individual’s capability to
adapt to divergent exercise modes is intriguing. The results
of studies using candidate gene analysis have generated
largely inconclusive findings and characterising genetic
variants that may be responsible for specific phenotypes
will continue to be a difficult proposition (Wang et al.
2013).
Although major breakthroughs in the knowledge of
how exercise activates numerous cellular, molecular and
biochemical pathways have been observed during the
past decades, evidence linking such effects to specific
performance outcomes has proved elusive and a challenge
for future research. In the final analyses, when considering
the multiplicity, complexity and redundancy of the many
signalling cascades involved in endurance- and resistance
exercise-induced responses, it seems unlikely that a few
select proteins could mediate such events and explain the
interference effect. Indeed, we have previously suggested
that changes at the transcriptional level may be more
likely to elucidate the mechanistic underpinning of
exercise-specific adaptive profiles (Camera et al. 2010).
While the various ‘omics’ technologies and the application
of computational and systems biology approaches to
problems in exercise biology should facilitate future
progress, it is likely that multiple integrated, rather than
isolated, effectors or processes are required to generate the
interference effect.
Summary
While the study of concurrent training has received less
attention than that of single mode training for end-
urance or strength/power, existing evidence supports
the existence of an interference effect of endurance
training on resistance training induced muscle hyper-
trophy and strength. Importantly, the specificity of the
molecular training responses with divergent exercise
modes and the time course over which these events
occur provides the essential context in which concurrent
training adaptation and performance outcomes should
be evaluated. Recommendations to individuals to under-
take divergent exercise modes on different days to avoid
adaptation interference with concurrent training is over-
simplistic and not representative of the ‘real world’
scenarios under which athletes train. The demands and
management of professional athletes often restricts the
‘optimal’ timing for different exercise modes within
a periodised programme. In this review we have
limited discussion to the effects of endurance- on
resistance-based training adaptation and have not even
begun to consider the effects of alternative modes of
exercise (e.g. high-intensity sprint training, plyometrics)
that would undoubtedly add complexity to the training
adaptation responses and the ensuing interference effect.
The molecular profiles generated by endurance and
resistance exercise are complex, an effect that is magnified
when individuals undertake concurrent training. Are we
guilty of overlooking the obvious or simply making
the issue more complicated than it is? For example, it
is possible that acute residual fatigue (from the pre-
vious exercise session) and/or chronic fatigue (due to
undertaking a greater total work load to match adaptive
responsesofsinglemodetraining)aregeneratingtheinter-
ference effect. If so, such training would surely induce
marked metabolic consequences and result in a unique
‘molecularfootprint’directlyproportionaltotheenergetic
demands of training? If this were the case then such
a ‘footprint’ should have the potential to inform the
‘how’ and ‘when’ of concurrent training in order to

training creates an ‘interference effect’ at the molecular
level has been less than spectacular. Consequently, the
challenge to bridge the gap between ‘basic’ and ‘applied’
sciences remains and there should be no shortage of work
for the exercise scientist who dares to mix their exercise
modes!
