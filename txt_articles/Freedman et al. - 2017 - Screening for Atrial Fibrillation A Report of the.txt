ABSTRACT: Approximately 10% of ischemic strokes are associated 
with atrial fibrillation (AF) first diagnosed at the time of stroke. Detecting 
asymptomatic AF would provide an opportunity to prevent these strokes 
by instituting appropriate anticoagulation. The AF-SCREEN international 
collaboration was formed in September 2015 to promote discussion and 
research about AF screening as a strategy to reduce stroke and death and 
to provide advocacy for implementation of country-specific AF screening 
programs. During 2016, 60 expert members of AF-SCREEN, including 
physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, health economists, and 
patient advocates, were invited to prepare sections of a draft document. 
In August 2016, 51 members met in Rome to discuss the draft document 
and consider the key points arising from it using a Delphi process. These 
key points emphasize that screen-detected AF found at a single timepoint 
or by intermittent ECG recordings over 2 weeks is not a benign condition 
and, with additional stroke factors, carries sufficient risk of stroke to justify 
consideration of anticoagulation. With regard to the methods of mass 
screening, handheld ECG devices have the advantage of providing a 
verifiable ECG trace that guidelines require for AF diagnosis and would 
therefore be preferred as screening tools. Certain patient groups, such 
as those with recent embolic stroke of uncertain source (ESUS), require 
more intensive monitoring for AF. Settings for screening include various 
venues in both the community and the clinic, but they must be linked to 
a pathway for appropriate diagnosis and management for screening to 
be effective. It is recognized that health resources vary widely between 
countries and health systems, so the setting for AF screening should be 
both country- and health system-specific. Based on current knowledge, 
this white paper provides a strong case for AF screening now while 
recognizing that large randomized outcomes studies would be helpful to 
strengthen the evidence base.

AF-SCREEN: ESTABLISHMENT AND GOALS
AF-SCREEN international collaboration was founded in Sep-
tember 2015 and includes ˃100 physicians (cardiologists, 
electrophysiologists, primary care physicians, stroke neu-
rologists, and geriatricians), nurses, allied health profes-
sionals, epidemiologists, health economists, and patient 
group representatives from 31 countries. The collaboration 
seeks to promote discussion and research about screening 
for unknown or undertreated AF to reduce stroke and death 
and to provide advocacy for implementation of country-spe-
cific AF screening programs (www.afscreen.org).
Although many patients with AF develop symptoms 
leading to appropriate diagnosis and management, the 
first manifestation may be a debilitating stroke or death. 
Finding AF before symptoms are manifested could lead 
to initiation of appropriate effective therapy, including 
oral anticoagulants (OACs) to reduce stroke and death1 
and potentially initiation of risk-factor modifications to re-
duce complications from AF progression.
The past decade has witnessed a surge in the number 
and sophistication of diagnostic tools, ranging from inex-
pensive devices that detect persistent or paroxysmal AF to 
devices capable of long-term continuous characterization 
of brief, asymptomatic AF. Those participating in the AF-
SCREEN collaboration recognize a unique and timely op-
portunity to reexamine the approaches and rationale for AF 
diagnosis at an early asymptomatic stage. This prompted 
the development of a white paper on screening for AF, devel-
oped from a consensus meeting of AF-SCREEN members 
held in Rome in August 2016. Full details of the genesis of 
the white paper and the Delphi process used are provided 
in the appendix in the online-only Data Supplement.
Incidence of Screen-Detected AF and Cardiac 
Implanted Electronic Device (CIED)-Detected 
Atrial High-Rate Episodes
Many terms have been used to describe screen-detected 
AF, including unrecognized, undiagnosed, silent, subclini-
cal AF, and cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED)-de-
tected atrial high-rate episodes. In this article, we will refer 
to AF detected on single-timepoint screening or patient-
activated ECG recorders as screen-detected AF, whereas 
brief transient AF detected by CIEDs with atrial monitoring 
capability are referred to as CIED-detected atrial high-rate 
episodes. CIED-detected atrial high-rate episodes could 
be caused by oversensing or other atrial tachyarrhythmias 
and need close inspection of the stored electrograms be-
fore labeling them AF. CIEDs are not implanted to screen 
for AF, and CIED-detected atrial high-rate episodes are 
not included in our definition of screen-detected AF and 
should not be grouped with screen-detected AF. A full 
discussion of CIED-detected atrial high-rate episodes has 
been included in this white paper principally to enhance 
our understanding of the significance of screen-detected 
AF and its relationship with stroke.
The incidence of screen-detected AF strongly depends 
on the population screened and duration/intensity of screen-
ing.2 Single-timepoint screening of a general population ≥65 
years of age detects undiagnosed AF in 1.4%,3 and the AF 
detected is largely persistent. In a large population-based 
study of individuals 75 to 76 years of age, a more intense 
2-week screening program using twice-daily intermittent 
handheld ECG recordings identified AF in 3.0% (0.5% on the 
initial ECG4). The identical protocol restricted to those with 
≥1 additional stroke risk factor identified 7.4% with AF.5
The incidence of atrial high-rate episodes in patients 
with CIEDs ranges from 30% to 60% depending on the 
population and the detection algorithm used.6–15 In 2580 
patients with a history of hypertension and no prior AF 
history, CIED-detected atrial high-rate episodes ≥6 min-
utes were found in 35% of patients with implanted de-
vices over a mean follow-up of 2.5 years and doubled 
the risk of stroke.11 Silent AF is more frequent than symp-
tomatic AF in patients with a pacemaker or during ex-
ternal continuous rhythm monitoring.16 Because patients 
with CIEDs have a medical condition that may affect the 
occurrence of atrial high-rate episodes, other studies 
 
(ASSERT-II [Subclinical AF in older asymptomatic patients] 
NCT01694394, REVEAL-AF [Incidence of AF in high risk 
patients] NCT01727297, GRAF [Graz study on the Risk 
of Atrial Fibrillation] NCT01461434, Danish Loop study 
NCT02036450) using subcutaneous long-term continu-
ous monitoring in people at risk of AF may provide a 
more reliable estimate of AF in non-CIED populations and 
elucidate its clinical significance. The initial report of the 
ASSERT-II study showed that brief episodes of subclini-
cal AF are common among individuals ≥65 years of age 
who have stroke risk factors and evidence of left atrial 
enlargement. Among 256 patients with an average left 
atrial volume of 76.5 mL receiving an implantable cardiac 
loop recorder, the rate of subclinical AF detection for epi-
sodes lasting ≥5 minutes was 34% per year.17 The stud-
ies reporting incidence of CIED-detected atrial high-rate 
episodes8,10–15,18,19 have been summarized in Table 1.
Risk of Stroke and Death in Untreated Screen-
Detected AF
No data specifically address the risk of stroke and death 
in untreated screen-detected AF in the general popula-
tion. The closest approximation includes cohort studies 
of individuals with AF detected incidentally in the ab-
sence of symptoms. One study20 showed that individuals 
who were asymptomatic at presentation were 3 times 
as likely to have had an ischemic stroke before AF di-
agnosis, and in follow-up they had similar risk of stroke 
and death as those with symptomatic AF. In a later study 
from this group, 161 out of 476 individuals with new AF 
were asymptomatic at presentation, and these people

had an increased risk for cardiovascular (hazard ratio 
[HR], 3.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50–6.45) and 
all-cause mortality (HR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.89–4.64) com-
pared to those with typical symptoms after adjustment 
for CHA2DS2-VASc score and age (Figure 1).21
In 5555 patients with asymptomatic clinical AF detect-
ed incidentally in general practice, the adjusted stroke 
rate in the 1460 untreated patients was 4% and all-cause 
mortality 7% over 1.5 years of follow-up compared with 
1% and 2.5%, respectively, in matched controls with-
out AF.22,23 In the EORP AF registry (Eurobservational 
Research Programme), mortality at 1 year was ˃2-fold 
higher in asymptomatic versus symptomatic AF (9.4% 
versus 4.2%, P<0.0001).24 In the Belgrade AF study, 
survival free of AF progression or ischemic stroke was 
worse in those with an asymptomatic presentation.25
The major studies regarding thromboembolic risk of 
CIED-detected atrial high-rate episodes in patients with 
implanted pacemakers, defibrillators, and cardiac resyn-
chronization devices all show increased stroke rate with 
CIED-detected atrial high-rate episodes, but the absolute 
risk of stroke was much lower than might be expected 
for patients with clinical AF and similar CHA2DS2-VASc 
score.6,7,9–11,13,18 A minimum 5-minute duration of atrial 
high-rate episodes was found to have clinical relevance 
in the MOST study (Mode Selection Trial).10 Alternative 
arbitrary or data-derived atrial high-rate episodes burden 
cut points have been explored over the subsequent 10 
years, ranging from 5 minutes to 24 hours.11 Uncer-
tainty remains about the minimum burden that increas-
es thromboembolic risk. A recent reevaluation of the 
 
ASSERT study indicated that stroke risk was increased 
only in patients with atrial high-rate episodes duration 
≥24 hours.26 These studies are summarized in Table 2.
Key Point 1
Screen-detected AF as found on single-timepoint screen-
ing or intermittent 30-second recordings over 2 weeks 
is not a benign condition and, with additional stroke risk 
factors, carries sufficient risk of stroke to justify consid-
eration of screening and therapy to prevent stroke.
Response to Treatment of Screen-Detected AF
Screening for a particular disease implies that an effec-
tive therapy improves outcomes. For AF, OACs have a 
major impact on reducing stroke, systemic embolism, 
and all-cause mortality.28 The nonvitamin-K antagonist 
OACs further improve outcomes with less intracranial 
bleeding.29 It has been questioned whether screen-de-
tected AF should prompt OAC treatment and whether the 
response to treatment is the same as for symptomatic 
AF. An undetermined proportion of asymptomatic pa-
tients with incidentally detected AF were included in the 
pivotal anticoagulant studies, but these studies have not 
been analyzed separately.28 No randomized controlled 
trials  exist, and it may be unethical to randomize pa-
tients with screen-detected AF to no therapy or an inef-
fective drug such as aspirin. The treatment decision for 
a given individual with screen-detected AF is determined 
by stroke risk factors (CHA2DS2-VASc score) according 
to guidelines1,30 and by the duration of the AF episode in 
the case of CIED-detected atrial high-rate episodes.
In the cohort study of 5555 asymptomatic patients 
with AF detected incidentally in general practice, OAC 
therapy (n=2492) compared with no antithrombotic thera-
py (n=1460) was associated with significantly reduced ad-
justed risk of stroke from 4% to 1% and death from 7% to 
4% in only 1.5 years, suggesting that screen-detected AF 
may respond similarly.22,23 Ongoing studies, including AR-
TESiA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism 
in Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibril-
lation; NCT01938248) and NOAH (Non-vitamin K Antago-
nist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate 
Episodes; NCT02618577), will help refine the benefit of 
nonvitamin-K antagonist OACs in CIED-detected atrial high-
rate episodes and provide more information on the burden 
or duration of atrial high-rate episodes that will benefit.
Screen-detected AF (single-timepoint screening or 
patient-initiated recording) is likely to have the same re-
sponse to OAC therapy as incidentally detected AF and 
symptomatic AF, with significant reduction in stroke and 
death. The absolute level of stroke risk for CIED-detect-
ed atrial high-rate episodes may be lower than screen-
detected AF and may modify the risk-benefit of OAC 
therapy. The burden threshold of CIED-detected atrial

a positive risk-benefit ratio is under investigation.
Role of AF in Ischemic Stroke
In stroke registries, at least a third of patients with isch-
emic stroke have either previously known31,32 or newly 
detected AF at the time of stroke.33 Stroke was the first 
manifestation of AF in ˃25% of AF-related strokes.31 The 
association with AF is even higher if prolonged poststroke 
external or implanted monitoring is performed.34,35 In the 
Swedish Riks-Stroke register of ˃94 
000 ischemic strokes, 
≈9% were associated with previously unknown AF and 20% 
with known but undertreated AF,31,32 whereas in a global 
registry 10% were caused by previously unknown AF.36
Recent evidence from CIEDs raises questions about 
the temporal and mechanistic relationship between AF and 
stroke, and whether AF is necessary for left atrial thrombo-
embolism to occur.9,37–39 In several studies, there does not 
appear to be a proximate temporal relationship between de-
vice-detected atrial high-rate episodes and strokes although 
patients with atrial high-rate episodes are at increased risk 
for stroke.19,37,38 Only a small minority of patients with CIED-
detected atrial high-rate episodes who have a stroke experi-
ence arrhythmia in the month before a stroke.9,37 One third 
had no atrial high-rate episodes during ≈1 year of rhythm 
monitoring before their stroke and only manifested atrial 
high-rate episodes after their stroke.19,37 Furthermore, mul-
tiple markers of abnormal atrial substrate have been associ-
ated with stroke independently of AF.40 In a small proportion 
of patients, however, a close proximate relationship exists 
between a daily atrial high-rate episode burden ≥5.5 hours 
and stroke, with risk highest in the 5 days before stroke, 
falling to a nonsignificant increase in risk by 30 days be-
fore stroke (Figure 2), pointing to AF being a risk factor in 
these patients.41 The temporal relationship between CIED-
detected atrial high-rate episodes and stroke is summarized 
in Table 3. A limitation of these studies is the small numbers 
of strokes and usually lack of adjudication as cardioembolic.
Even short AF episodes can create a prothrombotic 
state that persists for some time after the episode. Fur-
thermore, atrial cardiomyopathy related to aging or sys-
temic risk factors43 can lead to AF or atrial thromboem-
bolism. Once AF develops, it impairs atrial function and 
secondarily leads to atrial remodeling, which in addition

to flow abnormalities further increases thromboembolic 
risk.43 Atrial cardiomyopathy as a cause of thromboem-
bolism before AF could explain why a brief period of AF is 
associated with stroke months later, why many patients 
manifest AF for the first time after a stroke, and why one 
third of strokes are currently of unknown cause. Advanced 
neurocardiac imaging and continuous monitoring may 
provide further insights into the pathophysiology in future.
Nevertheless, AF remains an important risk marker as 
well as risk factor for stroke, with well-documented effica-
cy of OAC for stroke prevention. Anticoagulated patients 
with AF have residual stroke rates similar to matched 
individuals without AF, which underlines the efficacy of 
OACs in prevention of AF-related stroke.23 OACs remain 
underused in AF patients at risk of stroke: 30% to 50% of 
eligible patients with AF are not being given OAC, many 
are mistreated with aspirin monotherapy, and the remain-
der are not receiving any antithrombotic therapy.31,34,44
It is likely that both unknown and undertreated AF con-
tribute to a substantial proportion of all strokes, which 
could be prevented by screening strategies. Regarding 
the role of AF in stroke, it is likely that AF is both a risk 
factor and a strong risk marker for stroke.
Which Patients or Individuals to Screen?
For a screening program to be efficient, the screening 
technique must have a high positive predictive value us-
ing a low-risk tool at low cost. Screening yield depends 
on disease prevalence and diagnostic test performance. 
AF increases disproportionally in older adults, rendering 
age 1 of the best predictors of AF.45 The prevalence of 
AF ˂50 years of age is negligible in most populations 
and may not justify screening in this group.45 The preva-
lence of AF differs by ethnicity; for example, indigenous 
Australians have a higher burden of AF and higher risk at 
much younger ages than Europeans.46
If the screening procedure is inexpensive and easy to 
use (eg, pulse palpation or single-timepoint handheld de-
vices),47,48 screening can be nonselective and just age-
based. A threshold ≥65 years  of age (a CHA2DS2-VASc 
score of at least 1 in a male and 2 in a female) will detect 
undiagnosed AF in 1.4% in clinic or population settings,3 
in which case European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 
guidelines recommend that OAC be considered (Class 
IIa); OACs are recommended (Class I) for a score of 2 in 
a male or 3 in a female.30 Opportunistic screening in all 
patients contacting the health system ≥65 years of age 
has been adopted in the ESC AF guidelines30 but might

be more efficient if an older age threshold is chosen or 
an additional stroke risk factor is required.49 Superiority 
over a simple age-based criterion, however, needs to be 
proven.
Among individuals 75 years of age in Sweden, a single 
ECG detected 0.5% to 1% with undiagnosed AF.4,5 Adding 
2 weeks of twice-daily patient-activated handheld ECG de-
tected an additional 2.5% with undiagnosed AF4 and 7.4% 
after enrichment with ≥1 additional stroke risk factors.5 Even 
more AF is detected with continuous recording by external or 
implanted devices (Table 1), but that technology is costly and 
may only be justified in populations at high risk and with suf-
ficient yield from screening (eg, older age plus additional risk 
factors or embolic stroke of undetermined source [ESUS]). 
Adding biomarkers (eg, natriuretic peptides, high-sensitivity 
troponin) to existing clinical predictors may improve the pre-
diction of AF incidence.50,51 However, there is marginal im-
provement in model discrimination and reclassification.
Key Point 2
Single-timepoint screening of people ≥65 years of age in 
the clinic or community appears justified based on yield 
of screening and likely cost-effectiveness. For those ˃75 
years of age or in younger age groups at high risk of AF 
or stroke, 2 weeks of twice-daily intermittent AF screen-
ing may be warranted.
Ischemic Stroke and ESUS
Randomized controlled trials and observational studies 
have established the effectiveness of ECG monitoring 
after stroke for improving AF detection (number needed 
to screen=8–14), 33,52 with longer monitoring durations 
increasing AF detection probability. ECG monitoring after 
stroke is likely cost-effective.53,54 However, randomized 
controlled trials  have not been powered to assess the ef-
fect of prolonged ECG monitoring on stroke or mortality.
After an acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack 
in patients not known to have AF and without contraindica-
tions to OACs, a tiered AF ECG monitoring approach is ad-
vised. ESC guidelines recommend ≥72 hours ECG monitor-
ing in all stroke survivors,30 but more research is required 
to identify non-ESUS subgroups benefitting most from more 
prolonged monitoring. Ongoing randomized controlled trials 
 
are exploring an alternative strategy of blanket nonvitamin-K 
antagonist OAC therapy after limited negative Holter moni-
toring in ESUS (RE-SPECT [Randomized, Double-Blind, Eval-
uation in Secondary Stroke Prevention Comparing the Ef-
ficacy and Safety of the Oral Thrombin Inhibitor Dabigatran 
Etexilate Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid] ESUS NCT02239120 
and NAVIGATE ESUS [Rivaroxaban Versus Aspirin in Second-
ary Prevention of Stroke and Prevention of Systemic Embo-
lism in Patients with Recent ESUS] NCT02313909).
Key Point 3
Long-term continuous rhythm monitoring using either 
external or implanted devices or extended intermittent 
patient-activated recordings may diagnose clinically im-
portant AF in individuals with recent ESUS.
Overview of Screening Methods
Pulse palpation to assess pulse irregularity is a readily 
accessible method for screening in primary care, shown 
to be effective as a screening strategy in the SAFE study 
(Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly).65 It can 
also be used in the community, in both high- and low-mid-
dle-income countries, but has some limitations.55 In the 
clinic, it is usually performed by physicians or nurses, 
whereas in the community, nonphysician health profes-
sionals and lay people can be trained to detect pulse 
irregularity. In routine primary care, the pulse is infre-
quently assessed. Cardiac auscultation can also detect 
AF but is even less frequently performed in primary care.
Innovation in technology has produced new screening 
devices that improve feasibility and cost-effectiveness 
of widespread screening (Table 4). These devices are 
recognized as valid for AF detection by the European Pri-
mary Care Cardiovascular Society66 and could be used 
to complement traditional screening by pulse palpation.
Oscillometric blood pressure monitors with an AF de-
tection function based on pulse irregularity offer high sen-
sitivity (92% to 100%) and specificity (90% to 97%) and are 
superior to pulse palpation.57,61,62 The devices can be used 
by health workers or patients, provide single-timepoint or 
multiple patient-activated recordings, and have been evalu-
ated by health technology assessments.67 Finger photople-
thysmography, using a smartphone camera and flash, has 
sensitivity 93% and specificity 98% for AF detection us-
ing proprietary algorithms with variable techniques to deal 
with ectopic beats.64,68,69 Similar algorithms are being built 
into smart-watches and fitness bands. The technology is 
attractive given the wide distribution of smartphones but 
requires a noise-free trace for optimal performance. Ulti-
mately, with all pulse-based detection systems, an ECG 
is required to confirm AF,1,70 either 12-lead (current gold 
standard) or single-lead documenting P-waves.
A range of handheld devices produce diagnostic qual-
ity lead 1 single-lead ECGs, most with automated algo-
rithms more accurate than pulse palpation (sensitivity 
94% to 99% and specificity 92% to 97%).57,58,60,71 These 
devices have been widely used for single-timepoint AF 
screening.48,58 Repeated handheld ECG recordings over 
14 to 28 days have diagnostic accuracy equivalent to 
standard event recorders, superior to 12-lead ECG and 
24-hour Holter for paroxysmal AF,5,60,72 and have been 
used successfully in large-scale AF screening studies.4,5 
Although single-lead ECGs may not always show P-waves, 
the advantages outweigh this limitation. The accepted ar-
bitrary episode duration for defining AF is 30 seconds.
Continuous monitoring coupled with a diagnostic algo-
rithm will detect paroxysmal AF more effectively than re-
peated patient-activated devices, although the prognos-

tic significance of brief episodes is uncertain. Continuous 
monitoring can be accomplished by noninvasive devices 
(eg, prolonged Holter monitoring, a wearable nonadhe-
sive dry-electrode belt,73 or a wearable-patch: feasible for 
2 to 4 weeks74 and superior to 24-hour Holter). 
The main disadvantages of prolonged external moni-
toring are skin irritation from electrodes and patches, 
leading to reduced patient compliance, and the large 
amounts of data generated.
All devices with automated AF diagnostic algorithms 
require low-noise high-quality signals for optimal perfor-
mance. This may be difficult when devices are given to 
patients or used in the community. High sensitivity is desir-
able, but there is a trade-off with lower specificity, which 
can create much extra work and cost in verifying diagnoses 
with an ECG (if not recorded by the device).70 Device per-
formance, therefore, must be tested in the setting where it 
will be used for screening to optimize performance.
Key Point 4
Mass or opportunistic screening for AF can be accom-
plished by pulse palpation; oscillometric (blood pressure) 
or photoplethysmographic (smartphone camera) devices; 
and handheld ECG devices providing a rhythm strip. Be-
cause ECG confirmation is mandated by guidelines for the 
diagnosis of AF, handheld ECG devices have the advantage 
of providing a verifiable ECG trace and would therefore be 
the preferred screening tool. Prolonged continuous ECG 
monitoring with external or subcutaneous recorders will 
diagnose more paroxysmal AF but requires further evalu-
ation: cost-effectiveness will be limited by expense and 
detection of AF with lower absolute stroke risk.
Settings for Screening
Interest in community screening has increased recently 
in a number of countries.3–5,75–78 Prospective studies have 
used pulse palpation, single- or multilead ECG, and single-
timepoint or intermittent recordings using systematic or 
opportunistic approaches across entire populations or 
age-specific strata of total populations or defined popu-
lations in cohort studies. Screening has also been per-
formed opportunistically in volunteers during annual events 
(eg, Heart Rhythm Week in Belgium76). The STROKESTOP 
study4 invited half of the 75- to 76-year-olds in 2 Swedish 
regions to attend screening, and 53% accepted, similar to 
the rate in the SAFE study.65 This approach was stepped, 
with an initial single-lead ECG, followed by twice-daily inter-
mittent patient-activated ECG recordings over a 2-week 
period in those individuals without AF.
Pharmacies offer an attractive setting for community 
screening.48,79 People ≥65 years of age with chronic con-

ditions in many countries visit their community pharmacy 
every 1 to 3 months. AF screening with pulse check and 
smartphone-based ECG in Australian pharmacies was found 
to be feasible, cost-effective,48 and well accepted.80 The ma-
jor issue is ensuring referral and then treatment of detected 
individuals,79 so an established referral pathway is crucial.
Primary care is an ideal setting: In addition to regu-
lar primary care physician visits, nursing support for 
screening is available, and there is a direct link with the 
practitioner to prescribe OAC. Two challenges remain: 
(1) developing a sustainable strategy for detecting un-
diagnosed AF, and (2) providing adequate treatment for 
patients with known or newly discovered AF because 
undertreatment is common.81
The SAFE study showed that opportunistic screening 
with pulse palpation in primary care was as effective as sys-
tematic 12-lead ECG screening in detecting undiagnosed 
AF in patients ≥65 years of age, and more cost-effective.65 
Although some guidelines recommend screening using 
pulse palpation,30 pulse taking is not common practice.82 
The new ESC guidelines have added ECG rhythm strip to 
the recommendation on pulse palpation for opportunistic 
screening.30 For scalability and sustainability, screening 
could be linked to existing workflow (eg, cardiovascular risk 
management programs or influenza vaccination).47,58,83–85 
Computerized medical records linked to electronic deci-
sion support tools86  could provide prompts for regular 
screening, calculate stroke risk, and advise guideline-rec-
ommended therapy to assist workflow and treatment deci-
sions (eg, AF SMART ACTRN12616000850471). 
In some countries, large generalist or specialized out-
patient clinics provide an alternative setting to primary 
care for screening87 but may have similar issues with 
sustainable delivery of the screening intervention and 
subsequent treatment.
Key Point 5
The setting for AF screening needs to be individualized 
according to country- and healthcare system-specific 
requirements and resources and must be linked to a 
pathway for appropriate diagnosis and management for 
screening to be effective. Settings that have been used ef-
fectively include some that are community-based and oth-
ers based in primary care, specialist practices, or general 
or specialist clinics. Primary care and outpatient clinics 
have the advantage of offering a direct link with treatment 
and a potentially sustainable workflow (see online-only 
Data Supplement for country-specific considerations).
Health-Economic Assessments
Economic assessment of AF screening depends on a 
range of factors, including: (1) rate of undiagnosed AF 
in the target population, (2)  difference in AF detection 
between the screening intervention and routine practice 
without screening (3) stroke and mortality risk of the 
target population, (4) expected reduction in stroke and 
mortality and increase in bleeding risk from OAC, (5) 
cost of the screening methodology, and (6) country-spe-
cific “willingness-to-pay” thresholds to avoid 1 stroke.
In the first paper on health economic modeling for AF 
screening,88 both annual ECG screening and pulse pal-
pation with confirmatory ECG were cost-effective in a 
Japanese population. Later, the SAFE study evaluated 
opportunistic versus systematic screening using pulse 
palpation followed by ECG65,89 and showed, using proba-
bilistic sensitivity analyses, a 60% likelihood that oppor-
tunistic screening was cost-effective in both men and 
women. The Swedish STROKESTOP population screen-
ing study4 confirmed that ECG screening was likely 
to be cost-effective using a lifelong decision-analytic 
Markov model.90 Two other smaller studies evaluating 
smartphone ECG screening in community pharmacies48 
(relying on estimated stroke and death rates and im-
provements with OAC treatment in incidentally detected 
asymptomatic AF)22 and pulse checking in an influenza 
vaccination clinic91 also described cost-effectiveness. A 
simulation of direct medical costs in the United States 
concluded that costs were greater in those patients with 
undiagnosed AF than for similar people without AF, jus-
tifying strategies to identify and treat undiagnosed AF.92
Most recently, a study of lifetime costs and effects of 
a single handheld ECG screening of patients ˃65 years of 
age during the annual influenza vaccination in The Neth-
erlands83 found that screening would decrease overall 
costs by €764 (USD$939) and increase quality-adjusted 
life years by 0.27 per patient. That is, AF screening for 
patients >65 years of age during the influenza vaccina-
tion was likely to be cost-saving.
Reviews of systematic and opportunistic screening for 
AF detection93,94 indicate that both were more cost-effec-
tive than routine practice for those ≥65 years of age, al-
though this outcome depends on method chosen, frequen-
cy of screening, and age. For example, a formal Health 
Technology Assessment in Ireland considered a number 
of models and found costs per quality-adjusted life year 
varying between €792 
619 (USD$936 
902) for screening 
annually from 55 years of age to €8037 (USD$9500) for a 
single screening at 75 years of age,95 but no data are avail-
able on the detection rate for annual or other frequencies 
of repeated screening. More data are required to compare 
cost-effectiveness of different screening interventions and 
the effect of different age cutoffs.
Screening for Undertreated Known AF
Undertreatment exposes patients to a significant risk 
of fatal or disabling strokes. Population surveys96,97 and 
registries indicate that treatment remains suboptimal 
with large country differences.31 Population screening 
using a variety of techniques3,4,76 would identify under-
treated patients and may provide an opportunity to refer

to appropriate physicians or clinics to initiate OACs or 
reinitiate OACs in those who have discontinued.4,30,31
A prospective, Swedish population-based study found 
9.5% of individuals (81/848) were known to have AF on a 12-
lead ECG: 43% of these patients were not on OAC.5 Through 
the screening program, 52% of undertreated individuals had 
OAC initiated. A similar number of patients had known AF 
(9.3%) in the STROKESTOP study,4 but only 22% were not 
on OAC. After cardiologist follow-up, more than half without 
contraindications commenced OAC therapy. This finding 
highlights the importance of future implementation research 
in which AF screening programs incorporate well-defined re-
ferral pathways and strategies for initiating OAC therapy, in 
both newly diagnosed and undertreated known AF.
Patient Preferences and Advocacy
A large patient survey reported that a majority of pa-
tients with persistent AF were in favor of AF screening 
with handheld ECGs (T. Lobban and M. T. Hills, personal 
communication, September 2016). Patients also be-
lieved healthcare professionals needed to be better edu-
cated about AF symptoms.
The patient voice is as important as the clinician voice 
in driving change. Political advocacy from patients, care-
givers, and patient-led organizations has demonstrated 
the need for improved awareness, education, and dis-
ease information.98,99 Patient-led organizations can 
more effectively identify the challenges patients face 
and engage policymakers to bring about change,98 lead-
ing to improved outcomes for patients and healthcare 
providers (www.stopafib.org, www.heartrhythmalliance.
org). Campaigns such as the Arrhythmia Alliance’s Know 
Your Pulse campaign to screen for AF can be successful 
in raising awareness and bringing about policy change. 
Numerous governing bodies such as the National In-
stitute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) and scientific 
organizations now seek the input of patients and patient 
organizations in developing clinical guidelines and scien-
tific publications.1,30
Patients support screening to detect AF earlier. In-
creased education about AF for healthcare professionals 
is required, ensuring they respond to any reported patient 
symptoms. Public awareness campaigns will be helpful to 
educate people about checking their pulse and the ben-
efits of OAC for preventing AF-related stroke. It will be 
beneficial for professional health organizations to work in 
partnership with professional patient-led organizations to 
drive AF education and detection programs, advocate for 
screening, and evidence-based treatment for those with 
diagnosed AF.
Current Guidelines
The ESC recommends opportunistic pulse-taking in all 
patients ≥65 years of age or in high-risk subgroups, 
followed by an ECG if irregular, to allow for timely AF 
detection.30,89 Pulse taking in practice is recommended 
by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(UK) guidelines but only for symptoms. However, the 
new 2016 ESC guideline30 also includes an ECG rhythm 
strip as an alternative to pulse palpation, at least 72 
hours of ECG monitoring after a transient ischemic at-
tack or stroke with additional longer term monitoring 
considered, and consideration of systematic screening 
in patients ≥75 years of age or those at high stroke 
risk. An additional recommendation is to interrogate 
CIEDs for atrial high-rate episodes and, if detected, 
prompt further ECG monitoring to document AF before 
initiating therapy.
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines1 make no 
recommendation on the topic of screening but do state 
that early detection and treatment of asymptomatic AF 
before the first complications occur is a recognized pri-
ority for the prevention of stroke. 
Guidelines address specific subgroups where screen-
ing may be worthwhile, including high-risk patients (eg, 
poststroke, ˃75 years of age), in whom prolonged moni-
toring is more likely to detect AF.
Key Point 6
There is a need to perform large randomized controlled 
studies using hard end points (including stroke, system-
ic embolism, and death), of strategies for screening, to 
strengthen the evidence base to inform guidelines and 
national systematic screening strategies.
CONCLUSIONS
In older individuals with screen-detected AF, the absolute 
risk of ischemic stroke and death appears sufficient to 
justify consideration of treatment with OACs. Irregular-
ity of the pulse is a simple way to screen for AF, but 
pulse palpation is seldom done in routine practice, and 
inexpensive screening devices are available. Because an 
ECG is required to confirm AF diagnosis, devices that 
provide a medical quality ECG trace have an advantage 
over pulse-based devices and would be preferred as 
screening tools. Single-timepoint screening for AF ap-
pears justified based on yield and cost-effectiveness; 
as a further step, 2 weeks of twice daily intermittent 
recordings may be justified in people ≥75 years of age 
or in other groups at high risk of AF or AF-related stroke. 
Patient differences will modulate the type and intensity 
of screening (eg, ESUS requires higher intensity). The 
setting for screening is highly dependent on the health 
system in each country and needs to be individualized 
but must crucially be linked to a pathway for appropriate 
diagnosis and management. Although the World Health 
Organization criteria for screening appear to be met100 
and the evidence is strong for commencing screening ef-

forts in many countries, 1 or more large and adequately

Enrichment is the use of additional risk factors or biomarkers to either increase the proportion with unknown AF in the screened 
population or increase the risk of stroke in those with AF detected by screening in that population. Patients who are undertreated 
are patients with known AF who are not receiving oral anticoagulant according to guidelines. (see page 1859 section, Screening

ing for AF, so this has been placed in a different shape with a dotted line connector. BP indicates blood pressure; ESUS, embolic
