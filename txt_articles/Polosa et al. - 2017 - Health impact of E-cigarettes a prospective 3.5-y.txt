Although electronic cigarettes (ECs) are a much less harmful alternative to tobacco cigarettes, there is 
concern as to whether long-term ECs use may cause risks to human health. We report health outcomes 
(blood pressure, heart rate, body weight, lung function, respiratory symptoms, exhaled breath nitric 
oxide [eNO], exhaled carbon monoxide [eCO], and high-resolution computed tomography [HRCT] of 
the lungs) from a prospective 3.5-year observational study of a cohort of nine daily EC users (mean 
age 29.7 (±6.1) years) who have never smoked and a reference group of twelve never smokers. No 
significant changes could be detected over the observation period from baseline in the EC users or 
between EC users and control subjects in any of the health outcomes investigated. Moreover, no 
pathological findings could be identified on HRCT of the lungs and no respiratory symptoms were 
consistently reported in the EC user group. Although it cannot be excluded that some harm may occur 
at later stages, this study did not demonstrate any health concerns associated with long-term use of EC 
in relatively young users who did not also smoke tobacco.
Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery powered electronic devices. Puffing on an EC heats up an element (most 
commonly, a metal coil) that vaporizes a solution (e-liquid) mainly consisting of propylene glycol, vegetable 
glycerin, distilled water, and flavorings that may or may not contain liquid nicotine. The user inhales the aerosol 
generated by vaporizing the e-liquid in a process commonly referred to as “vaping”
. ECs do not contain tobacco, 
do not create smoke and do not rely on combustion to operate. These consumer products have been rapidly gain-
ing ground on conventional cigarettes among smokers due to the expectation of reducing/quitting smoking1–4, 
the perception of being a less harmful alternative to cigarettes1–6, competitive price7–9 and because they allow the 
smoker to continue having a “smoking experience without smoking”9–11.
Although vapour toxicology under normal condition of use is less problematic than tobacco smoke12–14 and 
e-vapour products are estimated to be less harmful than combustible cigarettes15–17, there is concern as to whether 
chronic exposure to their residual toxicological load may nevertheless carry a risk for lung health18–20. Therefore, 
investigating the health impact of long term EC use is warranted.
Considering that inhalation is the exposure mechanism for EC use, the respiratory system is the primary tar-
get of any potential harmful effects of constituents in ECs aerosol emissions. No deterioration in lung function, 
airway responses, and respiratory symptoms could be observed in a 1-year prospective RCT of “healthy” smokers 
who were invited to quit or reduce their tobacco consumption by switching to ECs20,21. Of note, FEF25–75% (a 
sensitive measure of obstruction in the more peripheral airways)20, nitric oxide (a non-invasive biomarker of 
airway inflammation in airways disease, as well as in studies of environmental and occupational exposure)21 and

carbon monoxide (a commonly used indicator of smoking abstinence that also reflects airway inflammation) in 
the exhaled breath returned to within normal limits21, with similar degree of normalization occurring in quitters 
who stopped using ECs as well as in quitters who were still using ECs. Overall, these preliminary studies do not 
appear to suggest negative respiratory health outcomes in smokers who have switched to ECs.
Nonetheless, very little is known about the long-term health effects of vaping. When investigating these health 
effects, it is important to consider that it is difficult (if not impossible) to disentangle responses driven by chronic 
exposure to EC aerosol emissions from those related to previous smoking history, unless one were to conduct 
studies on regular EC users who have never smoked. If EC aerosol emissions are much less harmful than tobacco 
smoke15–17, it can be hypothesized that long term vaping is less likely to cause significant harm to the respiratory 
system of regular daily EC users with no previous smoking history. This has never been formally tested in a 
research study.
Thus, aim of the study was to compare health outcomes between a cohort of daily EC users who have never 
smoked and a sample of never smokers and non-users of EC over a period of 3.5 years. Here we report findings 
from a prospective 3.5-year observational study comparing changes in health outcomes between a cohort of daily 
EC users who have never smoked and a reference group of never smokers and non-users of EC. Health outcomes 
included blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), body weight, lung function, respiratory symptoms, as well as 
exhaled biomarkers of airway inflammation (exhaled breath nitric oxide [eNO] and carbon monoxide [eCO]). 
EC users were also offered high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lungs at the end of follow-up to 
assess their risk for early signs of lung damage. This is the first study that has explored health effects of prolonged 
exposure to EC use in never smokers.
Methods
Participants and Study Design. 
Adult EC users (≥
18 years old) were identified amongst a pool of regular 
Vape Shops customers. Vape shop owners who helped in a previous study22 were instructed to ask their regular 
clients a few questions about smoking history and EC use patterns. Customers who had never smoked or who 
reported having smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime were defined as never smokers23 and considered 
for inclusion. They also had to be daily EC users of ≥
3 months. They were invited for a free medical check-up at 
the Centro per la Prevenzione e Cura del Tabagismo (CPCT) of the University of Catania. Age- and sex-matched 
non-smoking controls (and not using ECs) were selected from hospital staff and included as a reference (control) 
group. Subjects were recruited from June 2013 to September 2013 and data collection completed in March 2017. 
Participants came to the CPCT in the mornings for their check-up visits during which vital signs (blood pressure 
- BP, heart rate - HR, body weight) as well as measurements of lung function, respiratory symptoms, and airway 
inflammation (eNO and eCO levels) were recorded. Details of EC-related products purchased (i.e. ECs hardware, 
e-liquid nicotine strengths and flavours) were also noted. Three additional follow-up visits were scheduled yearly 
for up to 3.5 years; follow-up visits 1 (F/up1), 2 (F/up2) and 3 (F/up3) were carried out at 12 (±1), 24 (±2) and 
42 (±2) months after baseline visits, respectively. At F/up3, EC users were offered the additional option of under-
going lung HRCT. All these tests and measurements were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and 
regulations. University of Catania Ethics Review Board approved the study protocol and subjects gave informed 
consent prior to participation.
BP, HR, and Body Weight. 
After a 5-minute rest, BP and HR measurements were obtained by a 
semi-automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Smart Pressure, CA-MI Snc, Parma, Italy). Two measurements 
in the sitting position, spaced 1–2 min apart, were obtained at each visit. Measurements were taken in the morning, 
and participants were instructed not to vape or consume caffeinated drinks for at least 60 min prior to each visit. The 
average of two measurements was considered for analysis. Participants removed shoes and heavy clothing and were 
weighed at each visit by using a mechanical scale (Seca, Intermed Srl, San Giuliano Milanese, Italia).
Spirometry Procedure. 
A technician who was blinded to participants’ characteristics conducted spiromet-
ric tests according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines24. Prediction values 
for spirometric indices were the 2012 multi-ethnic reference values for spirometry for the 3–95-yr age range by 
Quanjer et al.25. Forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and maximum 
mid-expiratory flow (FEF25–75%) were obtained using a PC-based electronic spirometer (Micro Medical Spiro 
USB ML2525 with Spida 5 Software; CareFusion, Sesto Fiorentino, Firenze, Italy). At least three forced expiratory 
maneuvers spaced 1–2 min apart were obtained with subjects sitting comfortably. Measurements were taken in 
the morning and participants were instructed not to vape for at least 60 min prior to each visit. The best FVC and 
FEV1 were retained and FEF25–75% was selected from the maneuver with the largest sum of FEV1 and FVC. For 
each subject, FEV1/FVC was also computed. A respiratory physician experienced in pulmonary function testing 
(RP) reviewed spirometry results for quality control. Only technically acceptable tests were used for data analyses. 
Individual spirograms are “acceptable” if they are free from artefacts, they have good starts, they show satisfactory 
exhalation, as per well-defined criteria24.
Respiratory symptoms. 
Self-reported respiratory symptoms were verified at baseline and at each study 
follow-up visits by asking 4 yes/no questions:
 1. For cough: “Have you had any cough in the previous 2-weeks?”
 2. For wheeze: “Have you heard any wheeze when breathing?”
 3. For shortness of breath: “Have you been short of breath in the previous 2-weeks?”
 4. For tight chest: “Have you had difficulty in breathing like a sensation of pressure on your chest?”

FeNO measurements. 
Exhaled nitric oxide measurements (in ppb) were performed according to the 
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines26 using a hand-held FeNO meter (NIOX 
Mino, Aerocrine AB, Sweden). Expiratory manoeuvres were performed in the morning with participants sitting 
comfortably. Participants were instructed not to vape for at least 60 min prior to each visit. Only technically 
acceptable tests were used for data analyses.
eCO measurements. 
Measurements (in ppm) were obtained from a single expiratory breath by using a 
hand-held eCO meter (Micro CO, Micro Medical Ltd, UK) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. 
Expiratory manoeuvres were taken in the morning with participants sitting comfortably. Participants were 
instructed not to vape for at least 60 min prior to each visit.
Lung HRCT. 
HRCT scans were obtained with Toshiba Aquilion (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan). A 
high-resolution algorithm was applied and 1-mm axial slices at 10-mm intervals from lung apices to bases were 
reconstructed. Subjects were scanned during suspended end-inspiration in the prone position without intrave-
nous contrast material. An experienced radiologist who was blinded to participants’ characteristics evaluated the 
HRCT scans for presence or absence of pathologic signs.
Statistical Analyses. 
With a power of 80% and a type-I error (alpha) of 0.05 (5%), 7 subjects per group (14 
in all) would be sufficient for detecting a change of 12% in FEV1 (i.e., the minimal clinically important difference 
for FEV1 according to ATS/ERS criteria). Our analysis, based on mean and SD of FEV1 in Control (N = 12) and 
Pure Vapers (N = 9) groups, for a type-I error (alpha) of 0.05 (5%), produced a power of 6.7%.
Only data from subjects completing all four study visits were included in the analyses. Parametric data were 
expressed as mean (±standard deviation [SD]) while non-parametric data expressed as median (and interquartile 
range [IQR]). Possible between-group differences at baseline were evaluated using one-way Analysis of Variance and 
Mann-Whitney U-test for normally and not normally distributed continuous variables, respectively. Differences in 
frequency distribution of categorical variables were evaluated by χ
2 test. A Repeated Measures ANOVA model was 
used for evaluating changes in health effects indicators at different time points (4 time points: baseline, F/up 1, F/
up 2, and F/up 3): health effects indicators were entered into the model as within factor for assessing changes with 
time, while the study group (EC users/Controls) was entered as between factor for evaluating its effect on possible 
changes. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All analyses were performed 
with the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS for Windows version 20.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Participant Characteristics. 
A total of 16 [M 11; F 5; mean (±SD) age of 29.7 (±6.1) years] consecutive 
regular daily EC users of ≥
3 months who had never smoked and 15 age- and sex-matched [M 10; F 5; mean 
(±SD) age of 32.5 (±7.0) years] non-smoking controls (and not using ECs) consented to participate and were 
included in the study. From the EC users, four were lost to follow-up (no shows) and three were excluded, as they 
did not comply with inclusion criteria on review (two stopped vaping and one began vaping only sporadically). 
From the reference group, one was lost to follow-up (the subject moved to another city) and two were excluded, 
as they did not comply with inclusion criteria on review (both started tobacco smoking). Complete datasets were 
available from 9 EC users and 12 control subjects; their characteristics at baseline were not significantly different 
(with the exception of HR) and are presented in Table 1.
Six of the nine EC users were consuming nicotine-containing e-liquid at baseline as well as by the end of study, 
although at a lower strength. Three have been consuming zero-nicotine strength e-liquid throughout consistently 
the 3.5 years follow-up. Also consistent over time was the consumption of preferred flavours (i.e. tobacco fla-
vours). Some participants switched from standard refillables (i.e. assorted EGO style products) to more advanced 
refillable devices (including Provari, Innokin, Joyetech eVIC, Avatar Puff).
BP, HR, and Body Weight. 
Changes in systolic BP, diastolic BP, HR and body weight from baseline and 
between study groups are shown in Table 2. No significant changes from baseline were observed at any follow-up 
study visits in the EC group. No significant difference was found between EC users and control subjects. Because 
of the small sample size, we checked all individual datasets one by one to detect signs of negative changes and 
found no such changes (even among EC users consuming nicotine-containing e-liquids).
Lung Function. 
Changes in FEV1, FVC, %FEV1/FVC and FEF25–75 from baseline and between study 
groups are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1. No significant change from baseline was observed over the 3.5-years 
observation period in the EC group (Fig. 1, panels A–D). No significant difference was found between EC users 
and control subjects. None of the lung function variables showed a significant between-group (i.e., EC users/
Controls) effect (Table 2; Fig. 1, panels A–D). Again, because of the small sample size, we checked all individual 
datasets one by one to detect signs of negative changes and found no such changes, even among those with the 
highest e-liquid consumption (5 ml/day) and longest vaping hx (57 months).
Respiratory Symptoms. 
None of the participants in this study reported any wheezing, shortness of breath, 
or chest tightness. Cough was reported by one EC user at baseline and by another at F/up2. In the control group, 
three participants reported cough on three separate occasions. Of note, study participants reported no severe 
adverse reactions.
FeNO and eCO measurements. 
Changes in FeNo and eCO from baseline and between study groups are 
shown in Table 2. No significant change from baseline was observed over the 3.5-years observation period in 
the EC group (Fig. 2, panels A,B). No significant difference was found between EC users and control subjects.

Repeated Measures ANOVA showed that no between-group (i.e., EC users/Controls) effect in either FeNO or 
eCO (Table 2; Fig. 2, panels A,B). As with the other outcomes note above, we checked all individual datasets one 
by one to detect signs of negative changes and found no such changes, even among those with the highest e-liquid 
consumption and longest vaping hx”
.
Lung HRCT. 
HRCT scans were obtained in 8/9 EC users (one had claustrophobia and refused undergoing 
scanning). Visual assessment of the HRCT scans showed no pathological findings. In particular, no CT features 
compatible with early signs of COPD (i.e. parenchymal micronodules, ground-glass opacity, or macroscopic 
emphysema) or lipoid pneumonia or popcorn lung disease were present.
Of note, no early pathological signs were observed in subjects with the highest e-liquid consumption (i.e. 
5 mls/day) and longest overall vaping hx (i.e. 57 months).
Discussion
This small study, the first of its kind to date, found no detectable changes in lung health in never smokers who 
have been regularly vaping for at least 4 years. Daily exposure to ECs aerosol emissions caused no significant 
changes in any of the health outcomes investigated, including measures of lung function and lung inflammation. 
Moreover, no significant structural abnormalities could be identified on HRCT of the lungs and no respiratory 
symptoms were consistently reported. In spite of the small sample size and lack of comparison to smokers, careful 
examination of long-term health effects of EC use in a rare cohort of regular daily users who have never smoked 
in their life may contribute to the current understanding of the potential health risks associated with EC use.
Six of the nine EC users who completed the study were still consuming nicotine-containing e-liquids as 
reported on their last visit. Tobacco combustion products, not nicotine, cause most of the adverse health effects 
of smoking27. However, there is concern that some adverse cardiovascular effects may be related to nicotine per 
se due to its ability to cause hemodynamic changes (increase in heart rate, a transient rise in blood pressure, 
vasoconstriction of coronary and other vascular beds), adverse effects on lipids and induction of insulin resist-
ance27. In this study, no significant changes in systolic BP, diastolic BP or HR were observed in the EC user group 
throughout the study. Moreover, no notable individual changes were observed in any of the vapers consuming 
nicotine-containing e-liquids. Thus, consumption of low dose nicotine did not seem to have significant adverse 
cardiovascular effects, as shown in recent EC studies of healthy smokers28 and smokers with arterial hyperten-
sion29. Also, the latest US Surgeon General’s report that examined harm from tobacco and nicotine has concluded 
that - although it may adversely affect foetus and adolescent brain development – nicotine does not contribute to 
smoking-related diseases30.

Given that particle size in ECs aerosols is well within the respiratory range31,32, these particles can penetrate 
deeply within the lungs; therefore the concern that long-term exposure to ECs aerosol emissions may carry some 
health risk is reasonable18,19,33. However, in this study no significant changes in lung function, respiratory symp-
toms, FeNO or eCO measurements were found. Furthermore, no noticeable individual changes were observed 
in any of the vapers including those with the most significant exposure history. Some acute EC trials in healthy 
smokers have reported transient changes in respiratory effects34, but others have not confirmed these observa-
tions35,36. Long-term studies in healthy smokers20,21 and smokers with asthma and COPD37,38 switching to EC use 
have shown not only no clinically significant adverse respiratory effects, but, to the contrary, a mitigation of the 
harmful effects of smoked tobacco on the lung.
In addition, substantial improvement in respiratory symptoms has been reported in a large internet survey of 
19.000 smokers who switched to vaping1. In those diagnosed with asthma (n = 1173) or COPD (n = 1062) improve-
ment in respiratory symptoms after switching was reported in 65.4% and in 75.7% of the respondents, respectively. 
Worsening after switching was reported only in 1.1% of the asthmatics and 0.8% of the respondents with COPD.
Lung function tests and self-reported respiratory symptoms may not be sensitive enough to detect early poten-
tial pathologic changes that may occur in response to chronic inhalation of EC aerosol emissions. HRCT can be 
used to better identify distribution and extent of early evidence of lung damage39. Early signs of lung damage, 
such as parenchymal micronodules, ground-glass attenuation and emphysematous changes, have been described 
in asymptomatic smokers with and without spirometric abnormalities40–42. However, in this study no CT features 
indicative of early signs of lung damage were present in any of the EC users.
Flavorings in the e-liquid are generally considered safe to eat, but have largely unknown effects on the lung 
when heated and inhaled. Chronic exposure to high levels of diacetyl - a flavoring substance commonly used in 
the food industry for its appealing buttery aroma - in microwave popcorn workers has been shown to be associ-
ated with cases of bronchiolitis obliterans (i.e. “popcorn lung”)43,44. Although many vaping liquids may contain 
high concentrations of diacetyl45,46, there is no report that this has caused bronchiolitis obliterans in EC users. In 
this study, no features consistent with early sign of bronchiolitis obliterans were described in any of the EC users 
undergoing HRCT.
In the present study, over a period of about 4 years, none of the EC users started smoking tobacco cigarettes 
(two stopped vaping completely) and two never smokers from the reference group (never smokers, not using 
ECs) started smoking. Whether the use of ECs is a gateway to (or out of) smoking remains matter of debate47.
Some of the strengths of this study include the relatively long follow up period, the detailed vaping history, 
careful characterization of the study participants and the use of a panel of different clinical, functional and inflam-
matory measures. But it has also some notable limitations.
In relation to health effects reporting, it is important to acknowledge that reasons for loss to follow up may 
include health problems. In our study, four EC users were lost to follow-up (no shows); these individuals may 
have quit ECs because they experienced negative health effects associated with their use. Hence, the risk for selec-
tion bias cannot be excluded.

The very small sample size minimizes the power to show both prevalent abnormalities at baseline and sta-
tistically significant changes from baseline over time. Nonetheless, it must be recognized that vapers who have 
never smoked are a very uncommon sub-population of ECs users; the 2014 Eurobarometer survey found about 
0.1% of daily EC use in never smokers48. Hence, we were fortunate enough to recruit into the study such a care-
fully selected rare population of great importance to address the potential absolute risk of long term exposure 
to EC aerosol emissions disentangled from the effects of concomitant or former tobacco cigarette smoking. 
However, there is evidence of significant spirometry changes relatively early after initiation of smoking, even 
when analysing very small samples - as low as 13 smokers49. In any case, careful examination of the individual 
data on a case-by-case basis revealed no impairment in the health measures evaluated in any of the EC users 
in the study.
Another limitation is that the sample of relatively young subjects studied (mean age 27–28 years), who had 
had a generally short duration of regular EC use prior to entering the study (on average 8 months) and vapor-
ized, on average, only a modest amount of e-liquid (about 4 ml/die), may not be representative of the general

population of EC users who never smoked. Consequently, firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the results and 
additional studies in a larger and more diverse group of EC users are needed. On the other hand, vapers who have 
never smoked are likely to be relatively young1,50.
A related weakness is that since the age of our subjects was, on average, only in the mid-twenties, the nor-
mal age-related decline in lung function may not have yet commenced51, thus making it more difficult to show 
accelerated declines in response to any EC-related lung injury. Also, since duration and intensity of smoking are 
significant predictors of lung function decline among regular cigarette smokers52, the generally short duration 
and small amount of EC use by the vapers whom we studied may not have been sufficient to result in detectable 
lung damage. In any case, these deficiencies may guide other researchers to improve the design of similar studies.
Although no deterioration in lung health was detected during the 3.5 years follow-up, one could argue that 
no significant changes would have been detected among young healthy smokers during such a period as well. 
Comparison with a reference group of young smokers would have helped the interpretation of the results in EC 
users, thus making problematic to establish whether ECs are harmless or even less harmful than conventional 
cigarettes. Data documenting the effects of smoking on the lung over the first few years following initiation of 
smoking are limited. Tashkin and coll49 found that, over the five years between two visits at which spirometry 
was performed, those who initiated the smoking habit sometime during these 5 years (possibly, 2.5 years on 
average) had a relatively greater “negative” change in spirometric indices compared to those who never initiated 
the smoking habit. Niewoehner and coll52 found pathologic changes of the small airways at autopsy in young cig-
arette smokers who had died accidentally in motor vehicle accidents, indicating evidence of the harmful effects of 
smoking on the lung relatively early after initiation of smoking.
Another shortcoming is that HRCT scans were performed only at TLC, so that air-trapping (a sensitive meas-
ure of early lung damage in smokers with normal spirometry) could not be assessed53.
Summary and Conclusions
In a small sample of young-adult never-smoking, daily EC users who were carefully followed for approximately 
3½ years, we found no decrements in spirometric indices, development of respiratory symptoms, changes in 
markers of lung inflammation in exhaled air or findings of early lung damage on HRCT, when compared with 
a carefully matched group of never-smoking non-EC users. Even the heaviest EC users failed to exhibit any evi-
dence of emerging lung injury as reflected in these physiologic, clinical or inflammatory measures. Moreover, 
no changes were noted in blood pressure or heart rate. Since the EC users who we studied were never smokers, 
potential confounding by inhalation of combustion products of tobacco were obviated.
While the sample size was small, the results of this study may provide some preliminary evidence that 
long-term use of ECs is unlikely to raise significant health concerns in relatively young users. Further studies in a 
larger sample of EC users with and without a history of tobacco smoking are warranted.
