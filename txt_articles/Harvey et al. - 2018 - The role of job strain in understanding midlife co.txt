Abstract 
Background: There are long-standing concerns about reverse causation and residual 
confounding in the prospective association between job strain and risk for future Common 
Mental Disorders (CMDs).  
Methods: Data from the National Child Development Study (n =6870) were analysed using 
multivariate logistic regression to investigate the prospective association between job strain 
variables at age 45 years and risk of future CMDs at age 50 years, controlling for lifetime 
psychiatric history and a range of other possible confounding variables across the life-course. 
Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated to estimate the public health impact 
of job strain on mid-life mental health. 
Findings: In the fully adjusted model, high job demands (OR = 1·70, 95% CI = 1·25 – 2·32, 
p=0.01), low job control (OR = 1·89, 95% CI = 1·29 – 2·77, p<0.01), and high job strain (OR 
= 2·22, 95% CI = 1·59 - 3·09, p<0.01) remained significant predictors of future CMD onset. 
Fourteen percent of new CMD cases could have been prevented through elimination of high 
job strain (PAF = 0·14, 95% CI = 0·06 – 0·20). 
Interpretation: High levels of job strain appear to have an independent influence on the risk 
of future CMDs in midlife. These findings suggest that modifiable work-related risk factors 
may be an important target in efforts to reduce rates of CMDs.

Introduction 
Mental ill-health has now become the leading cause of sickness absence and long-
term incapacity in most high-income countries 1, which has led to increased academic, policy, 
and public attention on the relationship between job characteristics and mental health 1-5. The 
most widely-studied and influential theoretical model in this field is Karasek’s 6 job 
demands-control model. This model holds that high job demands (including work pace, 
intensity, and conflicting demands) and low job control or decision latitude (including 
workers’ ability to make decisions about their work) engender a state of high job strain, 
which places workers at elevated risk for health problems 6. Demonstrating this theorised 
causal relationship in relation to common mental disorders (CMDs) would provide a strong 
basis for targeting job strain in work-based mental health prevention programs 7,8. However, 
previous attempts to establish this relationship have been severely challenged by the 
possibility of reverse causation and residual confounding. 
Associations between high job demands, low job control, and high job strain with 
CMD symptoms have been uncovered in decades of cross-sectional research, most notably in 
large population studies such as the British Whitehall study 9, the Belgian BELSTRESS study 
10, the Dutch NEMESIS-2 study 11, the Norwegian HUSK study 12, and the Australian PATH 
40+ study 13. While longitudinal studies in this field are less common, they have generally 
produced similar results to the cross-sectional research, even across a range of follow-up 
periods. In the French GAZEL study, job demands and job control predicted subsequent 
depressive symptoms over a one-year period 14. In the British Whitehall study, job demands 
and job control predicted subsequent psychiatric morbidity over a five-year period 15. Over a 
still longer period, in the Belgian BELSTRESS study job demands (among men), job control 
(among women), and job strain (for both genders) showed unadjusted associations with 
subsequent depressive symptoms over a seven-year period16. Consistent with those results, 
major meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the longitudinal evidence have found 
  
4 
 
evidence of effects of job demands, job control, and job strain on risk of subsequent 
depression,17 and on risk of CMDs more generally 4,18. More recent prospective studies have 
shown that these associations are similar in nature, regardless of whether depression is 
measured via self-report symptom inventories or diagnostic interviews.19 
While the association between job strain and CMDs is well-established, there remain 
several major barriers to causal interpretations. The first concern is that of reverse causation. 
While the job demands-control model implies that adverse job characteristics cause 
deterioration in mental health 6, it is also possible that those with emerging poor mental 
health are disadvantaged in the labour market and are consequently overrepresented in less 
desirable jobs 1. Individuals who already have a history of CMDs may also be more likely to 
perceive equivalent jobs more negatively, as consistent with the negative cognitive biases 
associated with depression and anxiety disorders. While cross-sectional studies provide no 
information about the order in which job strain and CMDs emerge, longitudinal studies in 
this field have attempted to address the possibility of reverse causation by excluding 
psychiatric cases and/or controlling for psychiatric symptoms at baseline. It remains possible, 
however, that psychiatric symptoms earlier in life may be in remission and hence go 
undetected (and uncontrolled) at baseline, while nonetheless affecting education, career 
trajectories, and job ratings. 
A second concern is that of residual confounding: a third variable acting as a common 
cause of actual or perceived job characteristics and CMD. A wide range of non-workplace 
mental health risk factors may be associated with self-reported job characteristics, such as 
socio-demographic variables, childhood intelligence, temperament, and stressful life events 
(SLEs). Indirect evidence for such confounding comes from Henderson et al.’s 20 finding that 
the apparent prospective relationship between job control and subsequent sickness absence 
was eliminated after controlling for childhood IQ and education. Some longitudinal studies, 
such as the BELLSTRESS study, have found that prediction of depression symptoms by job 
  
5 
 
strain was reduced to marginal significance once adjustment was made for age, education 
level, social network, satisfaction with private life and locus of control 16. In spite of these 
isolated findings, Bonde’s 21 review of the literature on job strain and depression found that 
very few published studies controlled for multiple confounding variables across different 
domains and age periods.  
The present study aimed to address concerns about reverse causation and residual 
confounding through analysis of data collected in the UK National Child Development Study 
(NCDS), a large British cohort study 22. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to address 
these issues by examining the prospective relation between job strain and CMD onset while 
controlling simultaneously for psychiatric symptoms measured at multiple time-points, as 
well as a comprehensive set of other potential confounding variables recorded across the 
lifespan. The existence of job strain as a potentially modifiable causal factor of CMDs would 
have significant public health implications, as well as substantial economic consequences for 
employers.  
 
Method 
Participants 
 
The 1958 Birth Cohort (National Child Development Study, NCDS) includes 17,205 
(98%) births in the UK during the week of 3-9 March 1958. Data were obtained from cohort 
members as well as their parents, schools, and medical officers at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, 42, 
45, and 50. The study is described in detail elsewhere 22.  
The overall study design and flow of participants through the various assessments is 
shown in Figure 1.The base population for this study included 9377 participants who 
participated in the survey at age 45 years. Of these, 8417 individuals (90%) completed the 
self-completion questionnaires required for inclusion in this study. In order to obtain a cohort 
of working individuals free of depressive symptoms at baseline (aged 45), we excluded 
  
6 
 
participants who reached the threshold for CMD caseness, as defined by a Clinical Interview 
Schedule Revised (CIS-R) score of 12 or higher (n = 556) 23 at age 45.  The CIS-R is a 
structured interview that enquires about symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders over 
the previous month and has been validated against more rigorous clinician diagnostic 
scales.24  At age 45, participants were also asked, “Are you in paid work either full or part 
time?” and were able to respond “yes” or “no”. Those who indicated that they were not in 
paid employment at age 45 (n = 696) were also excluded.  We further removed individuals 
who changed employers between age 45 and 50 (n = 295), leaving a final analytic sample of 
6870 participants. Between 45 and 50 years, 775 (11%) participants in the analytic sample 
were lost to follow-up, meaning prospective data was available on 6095 participants. Of 
these, 6060 respondents had data on CMD caseness, yielding a follow-up rate of 88.2%.  
Previous analyses have demonstrated that the 45-year old sample is largely representative of 
the original birth cohort, although some disadvantaged groups have suffered a 
disproportionate loss to follow-up, in particular non-white participants, those from manual 
class backgrounds, whose mother did not remain in school, or who lived in rented housing. 25 
Ethics approval for the study was granted by the South East Multi-Centre Research 
Ethics Committee (ref: 01/1/44), and participants provided written informed consent after 
receiving a complete description of the study. 
 
Measures 
Job strain variables  
At age 45, job strain variables were measured using items derived from the Whitehall 
II Study questionnaire 26, and based on Karasek’s Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) 6. The job 
control subscale comprised three items measuring decision authority (ability to make 
decisions about work) and three items measuring skill discretion (opportunity to utilise skills 
during work). The job demands subscale comprised four items that inquired about work pace, 
  
7 
 
intensity, and conflicting demands. These 10 items were selected since they had the strongest 
correlations with the corresponding total subscale scores in previous research 26. Previous 
research has shown similar associations between self-report and objective measures of job 
demand and job control 27. Participants responded to each item on a 4-point Likert scale. 
Certain responses were reverse-scored so that higher summed subscale scores indicated 
higher job demands or job control. In the present study, there was acceptable reliability for 
both the job demands (Cronbach’s α = 0·69) and job control (Cronbach’s α = 0·79) subscales. 
In line with previously published studies which have used the same questions to assess job 
demand and control, the scores for these subscales were divided into tertiles (low, medium 
and high scores) 26,28,29. A job strain measure was computed by combining the job demands 
and control subscales as shown in Figure 2, producing nine exposure categories which were 
further classified into 3 levels of job strain: low, intermediate and high. 
 
Common mental disorders  
The 9-item psychological subscale of the Malaise Inventory 31 was used to detect 
case-level CMDs at age 50. The psychological subscales of the Malaise Inventory are 
commonly used in health surveys and have previously been shown to be validated methods of 
discriminating those with recent psychiatric morbidity 32.  Each question enquires about 
symptoms of depression or anxiety, for example, “Do you often feel depressed?” and “Do 
you often get worried about things?”. For each question, a score of 1 was assigned to a ‘yes’ 
response and 0 otherwise, and from this a total score ranging between 0 and 9 was generated. 
Following previous use of this subscale 33, a score of 4 or higher was considered indicative of 
case-level symptoms of CMD. In the case of missing data in some but not all items, 
individuals were only excluded where sufficient missing values could potentially move them 
into the caseness category.

Adulthood covariates 
A range of potential confounding variables were analysed as covariates. Each of these 
has previously been shown to be associated with future CMD and impaired occupational 
trajectories and therefore a greater chance of adverse work characteristics and job strain 
situations.29,34-36  Marital status at age 45 was grouped into five categories: single and never 
married, married or remarried, legally separated, divorced, and widowed. Highest educational 
attainment at age 33 was grouped into three hierarchical categories: no formal educational 
qualifications, ‘O’ levels (lower secondary education), and ‘A’ levels or higher (higher 
secondary education). Adult social position was represented by housing tenure at age 45 and 
occupational class at age 42. Housing tenure is indicative of material circumstances 37, and is 
classified according to whether the housing is owner-occupied (outright or with mortgage) or 
rented from a private or social landlord. Occupational class was categorised using the British 
Registrar General classification (I professional, II managerial/technical, III skilled, IV partly 
skilled, V unskilled) 38. 
Psychiatric history was represented by case-level symptoms of CMD at ages 23 and 
33. The full 24-item Malaise Inventory was completed by participants at both ages, but it was 
deemed appropriate to construct the malaise variables using the same 9-items included in the 
follow-up at 50 years. Consequently, a malaise score of 4 or higher out of a maximum score 
of 9 was considered indicative of case-level symptoms of CMD at ages 23 and 33. 
Stressful life events (SLEs) at age 45 were measured as a comparison non-workplace 
predictor of mental health. These were measured using an extended version of the List of 
Threatening Experiences Questionnaire (LTE-Q) 30, which includes 16 items concerning 
adverse life events that occurred 6 months prior to the survey. The LTE-Q has demonstrated 
good validity and reliability, and has been recommended for use in psychiatric studies 30. As 
we aimed to examine non-workplace SLEs, the four items pertaining to employment were 
excluded from the summary score. Three other questions that were only applicable to cohort 
  
9 
 
members with partners were also excluded. The remaining nine items comprised questions on 
illness, separation from or serious problems within close relationships, death of a close family 
member or friend, financial problems, and experiences of assault. The number of life events 
was summed, and divided into three categories (0, 1, or 2 or more events). 
 
 
Early life covariates 
Childhood IQ was derived from General Ability test scores 39 obtained at age 11. 
Adolescent temperament was reflected in school teacher ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 of 
participants’ cautiousness, moodiness, timidity, flexibility, sociability, and laziness at age 16.    
 
Statistical analysis 
All data analyses were conducted using STATA version 12.0 (Stata, College Station, 
TX, USA). Weights were included throughout the analyses to control for disproportionate 
loss to follow-up amongst some groups. As in previous analyses of NCDS data 40, inverse 
probability weights were calculated from predicted response probabilities, derived from a 
logistic regression model for follow-up. The prediction equation included the statistically 
significant predictors of response at age 50, and the effects of gender, social class, education, 
childhood IQ, and marital status. As no extreme weights were assigned to any individual, 
trimming was deemed unnecessary 41. Complete case analysis was also performed to ensure 
that results were not significantly altered by the application of inverse probability weighting.  
The univariate associations between adulthood covariates (socio-demographic factors, 
psychiatric history), early life covariates (childhood IQ and adolescent temperament), and the 
job strain variables were explored using logistic regression (cumulative logit) with the three 
level job strain variable as the dependent variable in all models. Univariate logistic regression 
models were also applied to investigate the relationships between the covariates and case-
  
10 
 
level symptoms of CMD at 50 years. The CMD caseness variable was binary, and was 
defined as a score of 4 or higher on the Malaise Inventory, which had possible scores ranging 
from 0 to 9. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to test the prediction of CMD 
caseness by the job strain variables and non-workplace SLEs, adjusting for each other and for 
the covariates entered into the models in a sequence identified a priori.  The order in which 
the covariates were entered followed the sequence of events within this life course data, such 
that after socioeconomic factors, early life factors were entered first, followed by young adult 
events and then mid-life factors. Specifically, sociodemographic (gender, marital status) and 
socioeconomic (housing tenure, occupational class, highest education) were entered first 
(Model 2), followed by early life factors (1Q at age 11, temperament at age 16) in Model 3. 
Past psychiatric problems (CMD at ages 23 and 33) were included in Model 4, and adult non-
work stressful life events were controlled for in the final model (Model 5) along with all the 
other potential confounders. Because some previous studies have suggested differing 
relationships between work and mental health depending on gender or social class 16, for all 
analyses, two-way interactions between gender and occupational class and job strain and 
CMD were tested with the inclusion of a multiplicative two-way interaction term in the 
regression models. Stratified analysis was only performed if significant two-way interactions 
were detected. Population attributable fractions (PAF) were computed using the punaf 
command in STATA, which utilises the normalizing and variance-stabilising transformation 
statistical method.

Results 
Baseline characteristics of the analytic sample are shown in Table 1. Missing data 
regarding job strain was present in 3·6% of participants, while 2% had missing data on non-
workplace SLEs and 0.6% of those followed had missing data on CMD caseness at age 50. . 
There was disproportionate loss to follow-up at age 50 amongst males, unmarried individuals, 
and those with lower social class, education, and childhood IQ.  
As expected, significant associations were found between job strain and the potential 
confounding variables of gender, occupational class, education, childhood IQ, psychiatric 
morbidity at 23 years and 33 years, non-workplace SLEs (p<0·001 for all), and the 
adolescent temperaments of being more timid and hardworking (p=0·03 for both). CMD 
caseness at age 50 was also associated in the expected direction with the potential 
confounding variables of gender, housing tenure, occupational class, education, IQ, 
psychiatric morbidity at 23 years and 33 years, and higher moodiness ratings at 16 years 
(p<0·03 for all). Furthermore, CMD caseness in early adult life was associated with later 
measures of job control, job demands, job strain, and non-workplace SLEs (p<0·002 for all). 
All variables were therefore included as covariates in the multivariate analyses as planned a 
priori.  
Table 2 presents the ORs and 95% CIs for CMD caseness at 50 years as predicted by 
the job strain variables at age 45 years. The weighted incidence rate of CMD caseness at 
follow-up was 10.2%. In the unadjusted model, lower job control, higher job demands and 
higher job strain were each individually associated with greater odds of displaying case-level 
CMD symptoms at follow-up (p-trend <0·001 for all). Confounding effects of socio-
economic characteristics (Model 2) and early life factors (Model 3) explained a substantial 
amount of the overall effects; inclusion of past psychiatric problems (Model 4) in the 
regression model further attenuated the associations. The final model (Model 5) controlled 
  
12 
 
for the potential confounders listed above, and mutually adjusted for work-related factors and 
life events. Although the effect sizes were attenuated, the significant positive associations 
between the odds of CMD caseness and low job control (OR=1·89; 95% CIs=1·29, 2·77; p-
trend <0·001), high job demands (OR=1·70; 95% CIs=1·25, 2·32; p-trend =0·001) and high 
job strain (OR=2·22; 95% CIs=1·59, 3·09; p-trend <·001) remained significant. There were 
no significant two-way interactions between gender or occupational class and job strain on 
CMD (p >0·05 for all). Based on the final multivariate model, the population attributable 
fractions (PAFs) for job strain were calculated. In order to calculate the PAF for high job 
strain situations, the low and medium job strain categories were combined. This allowed a 
calculation of how many cases of new CMD could have been avoided if all of the individuals 
reporting high job strain (26%) could have been moved into the combined low and medium 
job strain group. Assuming causality and a lack of residual confounding, fourteen percent of 
new CMD cases could have been prevented through elimination of high job strain 
(PAF=0·14, 95% CI=0·06, 0·20).  
All analyses were repeated on the original, unweighted data (not shown), but the 
results did not substantially differ from the weighted estimates.  We also repeated our 
analyses post hoc with log-binomial regression, in order to compare the effect size estimates 
when presented as risk ratios rather than odds ratios. While the multivariate models were 
unable to converge, the univariate models provided very similar effect sizes to logistic 
regression (risk ratio for low job control compared to high job control 2.36, 95% CI 1.82, 
3.06, p<0.001, risk ratio for high job demand compared to low job demand 1.60, 95% CI 
1.31, 1.97, p<0.001 and risk ratio of high job strain compared to low job strain 2.72, 95% CI 
2.16, 3.44, p<0.001).  
 
 
Discussion 
  
13 
 
While the presence of a prospective association between job strain and CMDs has 
been well-established 18,21,42, substantial doubts about the true nature of this relationship have 
remained due to concerns about possible reverse causation and residual confounding 4. The 
present study has analysed life-course data to show that job demands, job control, and job 
strain have a prospective impact on risk of future CMD onset independent of lifetime 
psychiatric history and other potential confounding variables across the lifespan. The models 
produced in this study are the most complete, in terms of taking account of potential 
confounding, to ever be published and allowed us to determine an accurate estimate of the 
mental health impact of job strain at a population level. Our models suggest that up to 14% of 
CMD cases in this cohort were potentially preventable with the elimination of job strain 
situations.  Such estimates have important caveats, most notably an assumption of causation 
and a lack of any residual confounding. However, given the complexity of the models 
presented in this paper, this population attributable fraction suggests that job strain is an 
important modifiable risk factor for public mental health interventions to be addressing.   
The finding that lower job control, higher job demands, and higher job strain each 
predicted increased risk of future CMDs at five years follow-up corroborates reports that the 
job strain variables were associated with CMDs cross-sectionally in large population studies 
42, as well as prospectively in longitudinal studies 18,21. Importantly, the use of life-course 
data enabled us to extend beyond previous research by more rigorously controlling for 
lifetime psychiatric history and other early life factors. Previous studies typically only 
controlled for psychiatric symptoms at baseline, such that earlier psychiatric symptoms in 
remission may have gone undetected and uncontrolled. By contrast, the present study not 
only excluded participants meeting the threshold for psychiatric caseness at baseline, but also 
controlled for psychiatric morbidity as measured at two earlier points in each individual’s 
life. Furthermore, our use of life-course data enabled simultaneous control for an extensive 
set of other variables that could act as a common cause of both self-reported job 
  
14 
 
characteristics and risk of CMDs, including childhood, adolescence, and adulthood variables. 
The childhood and adolescence covariates in particular have rarely been controlled for in 
previous studies. Through these innovations, the present study constitutes the most rigorous 
attempt to date to address concerns about reverse causation and residual confounding. 
Consequently, the present results permit several new conclusions to be drawn. 
First, while reverse causation and residual confounding may contribute to the 
observed association between job strain variable and CMD, these issues do not entirely 
account for the relationship. As such, the present findings strengthen the evidence that job 
strain has an independent causal impact on CMD onset, as postulated in Karasek’s 6 classic 
demands-control model. Second, comparison of effect sizes from our models suggests that 
low job control may exert a stronger independent influence on CMD onset than high job 
demands. The particular importance of job control as a causal factor is consistent with 
evidence of reduced CMDs following workplace interventions that improve employee control 
43. This importance may reflect the conceptual link between low job control and low 
perceived control. Low perceived control is an important transdiagnostic vulnerability factor 
for several CMDs.  
Our study also has important limitations. The chosen method of analysis for our 
nested-case control study was logistic regression. While appropriate for this study design, 
logistic regression can inflate effect sizes compared to other types of analysis that produce 
risk ratios. In order to explore this possibility, we re-ran our analyses post hoc with log-
binomial regression. While the multivariate models were unable to converge, the univariate 
models provided very similar effect sizes to those reported with logistic regression. Failed 
conversion of multivariate log-binomial regression models is not uncommon. This results 
from the maximizing process failing to find the maximum likelihood estimate, which does 
not imply any lack of significance of the underlying relationship of interest, but rather the 
mathematical complexities of working with probabilities within a log-link function. As with 
  
15 
 
many studies in this field, self-report measures were employed to assess both job strain and 
CMDs. Consequently, common method factors may have inflated the associations between 
these variables. However, the adjustment for several potentially relevant variables (e.g., 
childhood temperament) may have gone some way to mitigating this risk. While an extensive 
set of covariates were controlled for in order to limit overestimated associations, some 
residual confounding remains possible, particularly from variables such as physical health, 
substance misuse and family psychiatric history. Residual confounding is also a possibility 
due to misclassification of the measured confounders.  For example, the personality measures 
obtained may not have adequately captured all the personality traits, which may be relevant 
for the associations under investigation. We also note that this study only examined job strain 
and that other work-related risk factors for CMDs, such as effort-reward imbalance and job 
insecurity, may have a role as residual confounders. The pattern of exposure to job strain over 
time, in particular the chronicity of any exposure, may also be important. A related limitation 
is that our sample was selected to be in employment and without any evidence of mental ill 
health at baseline (45 years). As a result, it is likely that some individuals who were more 
prone to mental disorder would have been excluded on the basis of their symptoms or the fact 
that their prior illness may have contributed to them leaving the workforce. This will have led 
to our sample potentially being more resilient, an issue often termed the ‘healthy worker 
effect’, which may have resulted in an underestimate of the impact of job strain on mental 
health.  Additionally, in spite of our attempts to define a sample without mental health 
symptoms at baseline and to control for prior mental health problems, it remains probable 
that some of our sample would have had prior mental disorder which was well controlled at 
each assessment. This means that an element of reverse causation may remain in our final 
models.  
Other factors may have contributed to underestimation of the true effect of job strain. 
Since the outcome was future CMDs at a single five-year follow-up, the analyses were 
  
16 
 
insensitive to psychiatric consequences of job strain that emerged after the baseline measure 
but subsided before the follow-up.  There are also limitations to the study’s external validity. 
While the base sample was large and generally representative of the UK population, there 
was evidence of differential attrition, with only 8417 (48%) of the original sample recruited 
at birth providing valid responses at age 45.  In spite of this, previous analyses have 
demonstrated that the 45-year old sample remains largely representative of the original birth 
cohort, although some disadvantaged groups have suffered a disproportionate loss to follow-
up, in particular non-white participants, those from manual class backgrounds, whose mother 
did not remain in school, or who lived in rented housing. 25 While weighting was used in the 
analysis to address this concern, such weighting can only consider predictors of attrition 
measured at baseline. This means that factors that may have impacted on attrition but which 
occurred after baseline, for example emerging mental health problems, could not be 
accounted for. As in all birth-cohort studies, these results are also subject to cohort effects, 
and may be age-specific. For example, while job control appeared to be a particularly 
important influence on mental health in this cohort, this may not generalise to younger 
workers for whom relatively low job control may be more acceptable given their early career 
status. Moreover, since the cohort members were all British and were surveyed during the 
2008 global financial crisis, the present results may not generalise to workers of other 
nationalities or to time periods of differing job security.  
Since data were not collected concerning temporal patterns of exposure to job strain 
(e.g., gradual vs. sudden onset, acute vs. chronic exposure), it is unclear from these results 
whether some patterns of exposure have particularly deleterious effects on mental health. For 
example, the BELLSTRESS study indicated that repeated job strain has an especially strong 
adverse impact on mental health, compared to less chronic strain 16. In spite of these 
limitations, the present study has highlighted the potential public health impact of addressing 
job strain factors in the workplace. Previous research on interventions aimed at increasing 
  
17 
 
employee control 43,44 or improving job design 45,46 has shown some promise in promoting 
mental health and reducing stress in the workplace.  The next step in attempting to capitalise 
on this potential is for more methodologically rigorous evaluation of workplace interventions 
focused on these modifiable risk factors.

Research in Context 
Evidence before this study 
Mental ill-health has now become the leading cause of sickness absence and long-term 
incapacity in most high-income countries, which has led to increased academic, policy, and 
public attention on the relationship between job characteristics and mental health. Karasek’s 
job demands-control model is the most widely studied and influential theory in this field, and 
the association between high job strain and common mental disorders (CMD) has been well-
established in decades of cross-sectional and longitudinal research. However, there remain 
serious barriers to casual interpretations, namely reverse causation and residual confounding. 
For the purposes of a recently published systematic meta-review, we searched MEDLINE, 
PsycINFO, Embase, the Cochrane Collaboration, and grey literature databases until 4 April 
2016, with search terms including “mental health”, “work”, and “review”. This search 
identified 6 systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses that examined the association between 
job strain and CMD. These reviews found that very few published studies controlled for 
lifetime psychiatric symptoms and/or multiple confounding variables across different 
domains and age periods. 
Added value of this study 
Our findings show that high job demands, low job control, and high job strain have a 
prospective impact on risk of future CMD onset, independent of lifetime psychiatric history 
and other potential confounding variables across the lifespan. Moreover, 14% of CMD cases 
are potentially preventable with the elimination of high job strain situations. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
  
27 
 
The models produced in this study are the most complete, in terms of taking account of 
potential confounding, to ever be published, and suggest that job strain is of substantial public 
health significance. This has important implications for the development of workplace 
interventions, as targeting modifiable work-related risk factors, such as high job strain, may 
help to reduce rates of CMD in the general population.
