ABSTRACT: Eating patterns are increasingly varied. Typical breakfast, 
lunch, and dinner meals are difficult to distinguish because skipping meals 
and snacking have become more prevalent. Such eating styles can have 
various effects on cardiometabolic health markers, namely obesity, lipid 
profile, insulin resistance, and blood pressure. In this statement, we review 
the cardiometabolic health effects of specific eating patterns: skipping 
breakfast, intermittent fasting, meal frequency (number of daily eating 
occasions), and timing of eating occasions. Furthermore, we propose 
definitions for meals, snacks, and eating occasions for use in research. 
Finally, data suggest that irregular eating patterns appear less favorable for 
achieving a healthy cardiometabolic profile. Intentional eating with mindful 
attention to the timing and frequency of eating occasions could lead to 
healthier lifestyle and cardiometabolic risk factor management.
T
he patterns of meal and snack eating behavior in American adults have changed 
over the past 40 years. Based on NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey) data from 1971 to 1974 to 2009 to 2010 (n=62 
298), women 
20 to 74 years of age reported a decrease in 24-hour meal-derived total energy 
intake (TEI) from 82% in the 1970s to 77% in 2009 to 2010 and an increase in the 
proportion of TEI consumed from snacks from 18% to 23%.1 Similar trends were re-
ported among men. The proportion of men and women who reported consuming all 
3 standard meals declined over this period (from 73% to 59% in men; from 75% to 
63% in women),1 reflecting changes in eating patterns rather than changes in eating 
frequency. Indeed, the traditional breakfast-lunch-dinner pattern was not observed in 
a population of healthy, non–shift-working adults.2 In that study, the number of eat-
ing occasions, defined as consumption of any food or beverage providing at least 
5 kcal, was ≈4.2 times a day in the lowest decile and 10.5 times a day for the top 
decile. There were only 5 hours during the 24-hour day when <1% of all eating oc-
casions occurred: between 1 and 6 am. This study clearly demonstrated that adults 
in the United States eat around the clock. Because feeding and fasting entrain clock 
genes, which regulate all aspects of metabolism, meal timing can have serious 
implications for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, and obesity.3,4
The circadian rhythms of the body are controlled by the central clock located in 
the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus but also by clocks of peripheral 
organs. Although the master clock is strongly entrained by light, clocks of peripheral 
organs are additionally responsive to food supply, and temporal restriction of food 
can reset clock gene rhythms. In mice, food given in the normal sleeping period can 
uncouple peripheral clocks from the master clock.5 In fact, time-restricted feeding

in mice alters the robustness and coherence of rhythmic 
gene transcripts,6 which may be relevant for cardiometa-
bolic health. Indeed, the CLOCK and BMAL1 genes are 
implicated in regulating genes involved in lipid metabo-
lism.7,8 Polymorphisms in the CLOCK gene correlated 
with the development of metabolic syndrome; those in 
BMAL1, with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. 
Therefore, time of eating and nutrient delivery may have 
cardiometabolic health implications via alterations in pe-
ripheral clocks, most notably that of the liver.
In this statement, we review epidemiological and 
clinical evidence linking various eating patterns with 
cardiometabolic health markers in adults. We focus on 
patterns of food consumption as they relate to meal 
times and number of eating occasions/eating frequen-
cy rather than dietary profiles such as nutrient intakes. 
However, some attention will be given to diet quality to 
the extent that food intake patterns influence overall diet 
macronutrient composition. A comprehensive literature 
search strategy was used to identify relevant articles 
for this review. We searched electronic databases (eg, 
MEDLINE, PubMed, PubMed Central) and reference lists 
from retrieved articles and consulted expert colleagues. 
For electronic searches, we crossed various key words 
related to cardiometabolic health markers: lipid profile, 
fasting glucose, fasting insulin, homeostatic model as-
sessment (HOMA), insulin resistance (IR), insulin sensitiv-
ity, blood pressure, body weight, overweight, obesity, 
fat mass, visceral fat, adiposity, lean body mass, and 
weight loss. Key words relevant to eating patterns under 
review included breakfast skipping, intermittent fasting, 
meal frequency, and meal timing.
ADDITIONAL METHODS
A systematic search in MEDLINE PubMed was performed 
with the use of various combinations of the following 
search terms: alternate day fasting, intermittent fasting, 
fasting, intermittent energy restriction, meal frequency, 
meal skipping, meal timing, late day eating, late day 
meals, evening eating, evening meals, obesity, body 
weight, weight loss, cardiovascular risk, coronary heart 
disease (CHD), cholesterol, plasma lipids, lipid profile, 
blood pressure, glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance. 
Articles were excluded if they did not include original 
data; if they were editorials, letters, comments, or con-
ferences proceedings; or if they did not meet the inclu-
sion criteria described below. References of the retrieved 
articles were also screened for additional studies. Inclu-
sion criteria were as follows: (1) randomized, controlled 
trials and nonrandomized trials; (2) cohort and observa-
tional studies; (3) sample size ≥7 subjects per study arm 
for intervention studies; (4) primary end points of body 
weight or ≥1 relevant cardiovascular risk parameters; (5) 
age between 18 and 75 years; (6) nonsmokers; and (7) 
sedentary or moderately active individuals. Exclusion cri-
teria included (1) trials that included dietary supplements, 
pharmacological substances, or exercise; (2) individuals 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus; and (3) very active individu-
als or athletes. This search was limited to clinical trials 
with human subjects reported in the English language.
BREAKFAST SKIPPING AND 
CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL 
FINDINGS
It is commonly reported that “breakfast is the most im-
portant meal of the day.”9 However, ≈20% to 30% of US 
adults do not eat breakfast, and breakfast consumption 
has declined in recent decades.10–14 Of all meals, the 
prevalences of breakfast and lunch consumption have 
seen the greatest decline over the past 40 years.1 The 
decline in breakfast consumption has paralleled the in-
crease in obesity prevalence, fostering studies of the as-
sociation between breakfast consumption, cardiometa-
bolic health risks, and chronic disease.15–21 The definition 
of breakfast varies across studies.9 However, 2 common 
definitions are the following: (1) the first meal of the day 
eaten before or at the start of daily activities within 2 
hours of waking, typically no later than 10 am, and con-
sisting of a calorie level of 20% to 35% of total daily 
energy needs18,20,22,23 and (2) the consumption of food or 
beverage (excluding water) between 5 and 9 am.12 Glob-
ally, adult population predictors of skipping breakfast 
have consistently included younger age, current tobac-
co use, late dinner, higher alcohol consumption, higher 
daily energy intake, and infrequent exercise.13,20,24–34
Breakfast Skipping and Diet Quality
There is an association between skipping breakfast and 
low nutritional adequacy of adult diets.13,35 A cross-sec-
tional survey of the Bogalusa Heart Study (n=504; 58% 
women; 70% white; mean age, 23 years [range, 19–28 
years]) demonstrated that 74% of breakfast skippers 
did not meet two thirds of the Recommended Dietary 
Allowance for vitamins and minerals compared with 41% 
of those who consumed breakfast.36 Using data from 
NHANES 1999 to 2002, investigators demonstrated 
that young adults (n=2615; age, 20–39 years) who re-
ported skipping breakfast (defined as the absence of any 
food/beverage, excluding water) had greater TEI from 
added sugars, a lower mean adequacy ratio for nutrient 
intake, and a lower Healthy Eating Index.37

ommendations to consume breakfast as a possible 
strategy to achieve a healthy body weight38 and success-
ful weight loss maintenance.39 This association between 
breakfast skipping and higher body mass index (BMI) 
has been reported globally, primarily in cross-sectional 
studies.33,40–51 For example, in NHANES 1999 to 2002, 
young adults (n=5316; age, 20–39 years) who reported 
consuming ready-to-eat cereal were 31% less likely to 
be overweight/obese and 39% less likely to have ab-
dominal obesity compared with breakfast skippers.52 Ad-
ditionally, a meta-analysis of 19 studies in the Asian and 
Pacific regions (n=19 
108 participants) demonstrated a 
pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.57–195) for prevalence of overweight or obesity 
among the lowest compared with the highest breakfast 
consumption frequency.53
The association between breakfast consumption and 
lower risk of obesity and weight gain is supported fur-
ther by results from several large, long-term, prospec-
tive, observational studies. The prospective design 
minimizes the potential for reverse causation bias that 
hinders cross-sectional analyses. Among 6764 adults in 
the United Kingdom, a 1% increase in reported TEI at 
breakfast was associated with a relatively lower weight 
gain (−0.021 kg over an average of 3.7 years of follow-
up). After adjustment for sociodemographic and dietary 
factors, the percentage of TEI consumed at breakfast 
was inversely associated with weight gain.54 Among 
young adults (n=3598; baseline age, 18–30 years), dai-
ly breakfast eaters gained 1.91 kg less than infrequent 
breakfast consumers (<4 d/wk) over 18 years.55 In men, 
breakfast consumers were less likely to gain ≥5 kg over 
10 years, independently of lifestyle and BMI at baseline 
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.93).56 Interest-
ingly, the inverse association between breakfast con-
sumption and weight gain was greater in normal-weight 
men (adjusted HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70–0.87) compared 
with overweight men (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–1.00).56
Breakfast Skipping and Other CVD Risk Factors
In cross-sectional studies, daily breakfast eaters were 
less likely to have CVD risk factors, including elevated se-
rum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, low serum 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and elevated 
blood pressure.52,57 Conversely, among 415 healthy Ko-
rean adults, rare breakfast eaters (eating breakfast 1 
of 3 days) were less likely to have elevated serum tri-
glycerides (≥150 mg/dL).35 Notably, in the Korean study, 
the percent of TEI from carbohydrates was lower and 
the percent from fat was higher in rare breakfast eaters, 
which may explain this observation.
Skipping breakfast has been associated with mark-
ers of impaired glucose metabolism, including elevated 
hemoglobin A1c,44 higher fasting plasma glucose58 and 
all-day postprandial hyperglycemia,59,60 and a higher rate 
of impaired fasting glucose.28 In contrast, HOMA-IR did 
not differ statistically between breakfast skippers and 
eaters.57 Furthermore, breakfast skipping has been as-
sociated with a greater risk of clinically diagnosed diabe-
tes mellitus, which is a cardiovascular risk equivalent, in 
3 recent long-term, prospective studies. In a prospective 
study among men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up 
Study (n=29 205; age, 40–75 years at baseline), skip-
ping breakfast (defined as not eating anything before 
lunch) was associated with a 21% higher risk of develop-
ing type 2 diabetes mellitus (relative risk, 1.21; 95% CI, 
1.07–1.35) after adjustment for BMI, age, dietary qual-
ity, and other potential confounders.61 Among women in 
the Nurses’ Health Study (n=46 
289; mean baseline age, 
64.7 years), skipping breakfast even once per week was 
associated with a 28% higher risk of incident type 2 dia-
betes mellitus (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.14–1.44) after ad-
justment for numerous confounders.29 In a prospective 
analysis among 4631 middle-aged Japanese workers 
(age, 35–66 years at baseline), participants who skipped 
breakfast ≥2 d/wk had a 73% greater risk of diabetes 
mellitus (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.24–2.42) compared with 
participants who consumed breakfast 6 or 7 d/wk over 
8.9 years of follow-up after adjustment for confound-
ers.62 Finally, in a prospective analysis of young adults 
(n=3598; baseline age, 18–30 years), daily breakfast 
consumers had a multivariable-adjusted HR for diabetes 
mellitus of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.51–0.86) compared with in-
frequent breakfast eaters (0–3 d/wk) over 18 years of 
follow-up.55 This association was mediated by BMI (HR, 
0.81; 95% CI, 0.63–1.05). Furthermore, daily breakfast 
was not associated with a lower risk of diabetes mellitus 
among black women. The multivariable HR for diabetes 
mellitus comparing daily with infrequent breakfast con-
sumption was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.66–1.50) in black women 
but 0.54 (95% CI, 0.39–0.75) in black men, white men, 
and white women. Additionally, in CARDIA (Coronary Ar-
tery Risk Development in Young Adults), daily breakfast 
eaters also had a lower risk of hypertension (HR, 0.74; 
95% CI, 0.63–0.86) and metabolic syndrome (HR, 0.63; 
95% CI, 0.54–0.75) compared with infrequent breakfast 
eaters (0–3 times a week), and these associations re-
mained significant after adjustment for baseline mea-
sures of adiposity.55 Thus, data from large, prospective 
studies, supported by data from cross-sectional studies, 
suggest that breakfast consumption may play an impor-
tant role in the prevention of cardiometabolic outcomes.
Breakfast Skipping and CVD Risk
To the best of our knowledge, only 2 prospective studies 
have examined the association between breakfast skip-
ping and risk of CVD.62,63 Over 16 years of follow-up, men 
who reported usually skipping breakfast had a 27% (rela-
tive risk, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06–1.53) higher risk of CHD 
(defined as a nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD)

compared with men who did not skip breakfast after 
adjustment for age, demographic factors, and dietary 
and lifestyle factors.63 In the second study, conducted 
in Japan, infrequent breakfast consumption was associ-
ated with a greater risk of CVD, specifically greater risk 
of hemorrhagic stroke, after adjustment for age, sex, 
dietary and lifestyle factors, perceived mental stress, 
living alone, physical labor, and public health center 
area.64 Individuals who consumed breakfast 0 to 2 
times a week compared with those with daily breakfast 
eating had an HR of 1.14 (95% CI, 1.01–1.27) for total 
CVD, 1.18 (95% CI, 1.04–1.34) for total stroke, and 
1.36 (95% CI, 1.10–1.70) for cerebral hemorrhage. In 
contrast, infrequent breakfast intake was not associ-
ated with greater risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
cerebral infarction, or CHD in this population. Com-
pared with the prevalence in Western countries, the 
prevalence of stroke, especially cerebral hemorrhage, 
is higher and the prevalence of CHD is lower in Japan, 
which may be attributable to differential CVD risk fac-
tor patterns between these countries.65,66 The authors 
speculated that the low prevalence of CHD may explain 
the lack of association between breakfast skipping and 
CHD risk in Japan.64
Epidemiological studies provide strong evidence of 
a relation between breakfast skipping and cardiometa-
bolic risk. These include greater risk of overweight and 
obesity, metabolic risk profile, diabetes mellitus, CVD, 
and hypertension. These risks seem to be independent 
of differences in diet quality between breakfast eaters 
and nonconsumers. Notably, it is possible that reverse 
causation is responsible in part for the findings in the 
cross-sectional analyses. Although findings from ob-
servational studies cannot establish causality, large, 
prospective studies with long-term follow-up and the as-
sessment of clinical end points, including CVD and dia-
betes mellitus, can provide important insight into these 
associations. These are particularly meaningful when 
supported by evidence from experimental studies and 
clinical interventions.
BREAKFAST SKIPPING AND 
CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK: CLINICAL 
INTERVENTION FINDINGS
Few randomized, controlled trials have studied the impact 
of breakfast consumption on body weight. One of the 
pioneering studies in this field randomized breakfast eat-
ers (≥4 times per week) and skippers to either maintain-
ing their breakfast consumption patterns or switching to 
the alternative pattern while following a 1200-kcal/d diet 
for 12 weeks.67 The breakfast skippers randomized to 
breakfast consumption lost 7.7 kg, whereas those main-
tained on a no-breakfast diet lost 6.0 kg. In comparison, 
breakfast consumers maintained on a breakfast-eating 
weight loss diet lost 6.2 kg compared with 8.9 kg for 
those randomized to skip breakfast. It was therefore the 
change in breakfast eating habits, rather than breakfast 
consumption or skipping per se, that resulted in greater 
weight loss. However, behavioral data demonstrated 
that eating breakfast reduced overall dietary fat intake 
and minimized impulsive snacking, which are critical for 
successful weight reduction.67 A subsequent clinical trial 
randomized >300 overweight and obese adults (age, 
20–65 years) stratified by baseline breakfast habits to 
consume breakfast or to skip breakfast for 16 weeks.68 
No other dietary advice was provided. In contrast to the 
prior study, treatment assignment did not have a signifi-
cant effect on weight. A 4-week trial randomized a total 
of 36 obese men and women to a higher-fiber breakfast 
(hot oat cereal), a nonfiber breakfast (frosted ready-to-
eat cereal), or a no-breakfast arm.69 The no-breakfast 
group had greater weight loss (−1.18 kg) compared with 
the breakfast groups; however, breakfast skippers had 
an increase in serum total cholesterol.69 Another small, 
randomized, crossover trial of 10 normal-weight women 
also demonstrated that omitting breakfast for 2 weeks 
resulted in higher fasting total and LDL cholesterol.70
In an open-label trial, 93 overweight and obese wom-
en with metabolic syndrome (age, 30–57 years; BMI, 
32.2±1.2 kg/m2) were randomized to compare change 
in weight and metabolic outcomes on a high-calorie 
breakfast versus a high-calorie dinner.71 Both groups 
consumed a 500-kcal lunch. However, the breakfast 
group consumed a 700-kcal breakfast and 200-kcal din-
ner. In contrast, the dinner group consumed a 200-kcal 
breakfast and 700-kcal dinner. After 12 weeks, although 
body weight, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and 
insulin were reduced in both groups, they were all signifi-
cantly lower in the breakfast group. This suggests that a 
higher calorie intake during breakfast (earlier in the day) 
may influence weight and glucose metabolism. Addition-
ally, despite weight loss in both groups, mean triglycer-
ide levels decreased by 33% in the high-calorie breakfast 
group but increased by 14% in the dinner group, raising 
concerns about nocturnal postprandial lipid metabolism. 
However, despite the short trial duration, 17% of the 
breakfast group and 23% of the dinner group dropped 
out before completion.
Other studies suggest that the impact of breakfast 
skipping may differ by weight status. In obese partici-
pants randomized to consume at least 700 kcal before 
11 am (n=11) or to fast until noon (n=12), participants 
compensated for the lack of morning energy intake, and 
there was no impact of the intervention on body weight.72 
However, morning physical activity was reduced in the 
fasting group, and insulin sensitivity was reduced relative 
to the breakfast consumers. The lipid profile was unaf-
fected by breakfast consumption patterns. This contrasts 
with an identical intervention study in which lean individu-
als did not compensate for the reduced morning caloric

intakes.73 However, in that study also, body weight was 
unaffected by the intervention. Similar findings with re-
spect to lipid profile and insulin sensitivity were reported. 
Despite the epidemiological association of breakfast skip-
ping and higher BMI, the few clinical trial interventions 
have significant limitations and conflicting outcomes 
that prohibit evidence-based recommendations on daily 
breakfast consumption to promote weight loss solely.
In a small crossover study of individuals (n=26) with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus who regularly ate breakfast at 
baseline (age, 30–70 years; BMI, 22–35 kg/m2; hemo-
globin A1c, 7%–9%), randomization to 2 days of con-
sumption versus omitting breakfast suggested that skip-
ping breakfast increases postprandial hyperglycemia 
after lunch and dinner in association with lower intact 
glucagon-like peptide-1 and impaired insulin response.74 
In clinical intervention studies, skipping breakfast has 
been associated with adverse metabolic and behavioral 
responses.75,76 Adverse effects include higher blood glu-
cose and serum insulin responses, higher plasma free 
fatty acids, and higher hunger and desire-to-eat ratings 
that likely result in a compensatory increase in energy 
intake later in the day.75
In summary, the limited evidence of breakfast con-
sumption as an important factor in combined weight 
and cardiometabolic risk management is suggestive of 
a minimal impact. There is increasing evidence that ad-
vice related to breakfast consumption does not improve 
weight loss, likely because of compensatory behaviors 
during the day. On the other hand, breakfast consump-
tion can contribute to a healthier eating pattern that 
leads to slight improvements in cardiometabolic risk pro-
file. Additional, longer-term studies are needed in this 
field because most metabolic studies have been either 
single-day studies or of very short duration.
Summary
On the basis of the combined epidemiological and 
clinical intervention data, daily breakfast consumption 
among US adults may decrease the risk of adverse ef-
fects related to glucose and insulin metabolism. In ad-
dition, comprehensive dietary counseling that supports 
daily breakfast consumption may be helpful in promoting 
healthy dietary habits throughout the day.
INTERMITTENT FASTING, MEAL 
FREQUENCY, AND CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK: 
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FINDINGS
Intermittent Fasting
Observational data on the long-term relationship between 
intermittent fasting and risk of cardiometabolic disease 
are limited. The Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study 
includes a large proportion of patients who identify them-
selves as having a Latter-Day Saint religious preference, 
in which routine fasting (1 time per month for 24 hours) is 
common.77 A meta-analysis of 2 small studies within this 
cohort including patients from 2004 to 2006 (n=448) 
and from 2007 to 2008 (n=200) found that patients who 
fasted routinely had an OR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.46–0.94) 
for coronary artery disease compared with individuals 
who did not fast routinely after adjustment for confound-
ers. In the same study, the OR comparing routine fasting 
and nonfasting was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.36–0.88) for diabe-
tes mellitus. However, these estimates were adjusted for 
age and sex only. Further studies are needed with larger 
sample sizes, adjustment for confounding by other life-
style behaviors, and prospective data collection to deter-
mine the long-term relationship between routine fasting 
and disease outcomes. Furthermore, epidemiological 
studies involving participants with more frequent fasting 
days are needed.
Meal Frequency
Greater eating frequency has been associated with low-
er risk of obesity in several cross-sectional studies within 
free-living populations. In a cross-sectional analysis with-
in the prospective SEASONS study (Seasonal Variation 
of Blood Cholesterol Study in Worcester County, Mas-
sachusetts; n=499; 50.3% men; mean age, 48 years), 
individuals who ate ≥4 times a day had a significantly 
lower risk of obesity (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33–0.91) 
compared with individuals who ate ≤3 times a day, after 
adjustment for age, sex, physical activity, and TEI.48 In 
the Malmo Diet and Cancer study (n=1355 men, 1654 
women; age, 47–68 years), meal frequency was associ-
ated with an increased risk of obesity in men but not 
women.78 Compared with men who ate ≥6 times per 
day, men who ate ≤3 times a day were more likely to 
be obese (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.02–5.73) and to have 
an increased waist circumference (≥102 cm; OR, 2.09; 
95% CI, 1.03–4.27) after adjustment for TEI, lifestyle, 
and diet. However, the cross-sectional nature of these 
studies precludes us from establishing the causality or 
temporality of this association.
In a prospective analysis of adult men, increasing 
the number of eating occasions beyond 3 meals a day 
was associated with greater risk of gaining ≥5 kg over 
10 years (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06–1.25 for ≥2 versus 
0 additional eating occasions).56 Additional prospective 
studies are needed to better understand the role of eat-
ing frequency on adiposity and long-term weight gain 
or loss.
In a large, cross-sectional study conducted within 
the Norfolk cohort of EPIC (European Prospective In-
vestigation Into Cancer; n=14 666; age, 45–75 years), 
greater frequency of eating was associated with lower 
mean concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol.79 In-
dividuals who reported eating ≥6 times a day had mean

total cholesterol levels that were ≈0.15 mmol/L lower

for diabetes mellitus of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.09–1.46) after 
adjustment for age, lifestyle, diet, and other potential 
confounders. This risk was not altered after adjustment 
for BMI (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08–1.45). In contrast, 
more frequent eating (≥4 times a day) was not associ-
ated with risk of diabetes mellitus independently of BMI. 
In contrast, eating frequency was not associated with 
risk of diabetes mellitus among women in the Nurses’ 
Health Study over 6 years of follow-up.29 Compared with 
women who ate 3 times a day, the HRs for diabetes 
mellitus were 1.09 (95% CI, 0.84–1.41) for women who 
ate 1 to 2 times a day, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00–1.27) for 
women who ate 4 to 5 times a day, and 0.99 (95% CI, 
0.81–1.21) for women who ate ≥6 times a day.
To the best of our knowledge, there has been only 1 
prospective, cohort study that quantified the association 
between eating frequency and risk of CHD.63 Compared 
with men who ate 3 times a day, the HRs for CHD were 
1.10 (95% CI, 0.92–1.32) for men who ate 1 to 2 times 
a day, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.94–1.18) for men who ate 4 to 5 
times a day, and 1.26 (95% CI, 0.90–1.77) for men who 
ate ≥6 times a day after adjustment for TEI, diet quality, 
lifestyle, and other CVD risk factors.
Epidemiological studies of eating frequency lead to 
different conclusions, depending on the outcome of in-
terest. The relation between eating frequency and obe-
sity is mixed but seems to be more consistent with re-
spect to CVD risk factors and diabetes mellitus. In those 
cases, greater eating frequency seems to be related to 
improved risk status.
INTERMITTENT FASTING, MEAL FREQUENCY, 
AND CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK: CLINICAL 
INTERVENTION FINDINGS
Intermittent Fasting
Intermittent-fasting diets have increased in popularity 
over the past decade, particularly with respect to clinical 
intervention studies. The 2 most common forms of inter-
mittent fasting include alternate-day fasting and periodic 
fasting. Alternate-day fasting involves a “fast day,” when 
individuals consume ≤25% of baseline energy needs dur-
ing a 24-hour period, alternated with a “feast day,” when 
ad libitum food consumption is permitted for 24 hours. 
Periodic fasting, on the other hand, requires participants 
to fast only 1 or 2 d/wk and allows 5 to 6 days of ad 
libitum food consumption per week.
Changes in body weight by alternate-day fasting and 
periodic-fasting regimens are displayed in Table 1. Body 
weight decreased significantly in all studies by 3% to 8% 
after 3 to 24 weeks of treatment.80–89 Studies that pro-
vided food on the fast day produced the greatest weight 
loss. For instance, overweight participants lost 8% of 
their body weight over an 8-week period when provid-
ed with a 320- to 380-kcal meal replacement shake on 
each fast day during an alternate-day fasting protocol.82 
Similar decreases in body weight (4%–7%) were demon-
strated in the other 8-week alternate-day fasting studies 
that provided food on the fast day.83–88 The frequency 
of weekly fast days also appears to affect the degree 
of weight loss. Not surprisingly, participants lost weight 
faster in the alternate-day fasting studies that required 
3 to 4 days of fasting a week compared with periodic-
fasting studies, which require participants to fast only 1 
to 2 d/wk. On average, alternate-day fasting produces 
a 0.75-kg/wk reduction in body weight,80–87 whereas pe-
riodic fasting produces a 0.25-kg/wk reduction in body 
weight.88,89
The impact of intermittent fasting on total and LDL 
cholesterol concentrations is variable (Table 1). Although 
some trials report reductions in total cholesterol ranging 
from 6% to 21% and LDL cholesterol ranging from 7% to 
32%,82–84,87–89 others report no effect.81,85,86 The variation 
between studies cannot be clearly explained because 
the extent of weight loss is similar between studies.81–89 
On closer examination, however, it is possible that base-
line cholesterol levels may play a role. Significant reduc-
tions in these lipid risk factors have been observed only 
in studies in which participants had mildly elevated cho-
lesterol (ie, LDL cholesterol >110 mg/dL).82–84,87–89 HDL 
cholesterol concentrations remained unchanged in most 
of the studies reviewed here (Table 1).
Triglyceride concentrations decreased in the major-
ity of intermittent-fasting studies, with reductions rang-
ing from 16% to 42% (Table 1). The greatest decreases 
in triglycerides were generally observed in studies with 
the greatest weight loss. For instance, in studies that 
achieved 1-kg/wk weight loss, triglycerides decreased 
by ≈30% to 40%,82,83 whereas in the studies that 
achieved 0.25- to 0.5-kg/wk weight loss,84,87–89 triglyc-
erides decreased by ≈10% to 20%. Thus, both alternate-
day fasting and periodic-fasting regimens appear to be 
effective in lowering triglyceride levels, but the effect is 
dependent on the amount of weight lost.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased only 
in the intermittent-fasting studies that achieved 6% to 
7% weight loss.81,83,87,89 In these trials, systolic blood 
pressure reductions ranged from 3% to 8% and diastolic 
blood pressure reductions ranged from 6% to 10% af-
ter 6 to 24 weeks of treatment.81,83,87,89 Participants in 
these studies81,83,87,89 all had borderline prehypertension,

AND GUIDELINES
suggesting that these diets may prevent the progression 
of prehypertension to hypertension. Longer-term and 
larger-scale trials are needed to confirm this interesting 
preliminary finding.
Intermittent fasting appears to have no effect on 
fasting glucose concentrations in healthy individuals 
(Table 1). On the other hand, the diet seems to have 
a minor beneficial effect in those with prediabetes, 
with decreases in fasting glucose ranging from 3% to 
6%.83,87,88 The greatest decrease in fasting glucose was 
observed in individuals with prediabetes randomized to 
an alternate-day fasting group versus a no-intervention 
control group.87 After 12 weeks, fasting glucose was re-
duced by 6% in the alternate-day fasting group relative 
to the control group.87 Reductions in glucose (3%–4%) in 
patients with prediabetes were also demonstrated in 2 
other 8-week studies of alternate-day fasting83 and peri-
odic fasting.88
In contrast to the variable findings for glucose, fasting 
insulin decreased in all but 1 study (Table 1). Decreases 
in fasting insulin ranged from 11% to 57% after 3 to 24 
weeks of following the intermittent-fasting dietary pat-
tern.80,82,83,85–89 These reductions in insulin were not de-
pendent on the prediabetes status of participants but 
rather appeared to be most strongly related to the de-
gree of imposed energy restriction yet were somewhat in-
dependent of weight loss. Trials with the largest decrease 
in insulin had an average daily restriction of 40% to 50% 
of baseline energy needs.80,82 For instance, in 1 study,80 
participants underwent 50% average daily restriction via 
complete fasting on fast days, alternating with ad libitum 
intake on the day of feeding. Although weight was re-
duced by only 3% from baseline, a 57% decrease in fast-
ing insulin was observed.80 Likewise, in a study in which 
participants underwent 40% average daily restriction,82 a 
37% reduction in fasting insulin levels was observed. In a 
comparison of periodic fasting and alternate-day fasting, 
it would appear that both dietary patterns produce size-
able reductions in insulin concentrations. Improvements 
in this CVD risk parameter may be observed with fasting 
1 to 2 d/wk, as with periodic fasting, or fasting 3 to 4 d/
wk, as with alternate-day fasting.
Intermittent-fasting protocols produce fairly consis-
tent reductions in IR after 8 to 24 weeks of treatment 
(Table 1). In all studies, changes in IR were quantified by 
the HOMA-IR method.82,83,86–89 The most pronounced de-
creases in IR occurred with the greatest weight loss. For 
example, in 1 alternate-day fasting study,82 participants 
lost 8% of body weight, and this corresponded to the 
largest decline in HOMA-IR (33%). In another alternate-
day fasting study in which the reduction in body weight 
was half as large (4%),86 moderate reductions in HOMA-
IR (9%) were observed. Notable reductions in IR were 
also demonstrated by periodic-fasting protocols. For 
example, HOMA-IR decreased by 23% after 8 weeks of 
fasting 1 d/wk.88 Likewise, a 27% reduction in HOMA-IR 
was demonstrated with 24 weeks of fasting on 2 d/wk.89 
Together, these studies show that intermittent-fasting 
protocols that produce at least 4% weight loss may be 
helpful in decreasing IR in obese patients. Whether these 
findings can be reproduced when more robust measures 
of insulin sensitivity, that is, the hyperinsulinemic-eugly-
cemic clamp, are implemented warrants investigation.
Summary
There is evidence that both alternate-day fasting and pe-
riodic fasting may be effective for weight loss, although 
there are no data that indicate whether the weight loss 
can be sustained long term. In addition, both eating pat-
terns may be useful for lowering triglyceride concentra-
tions but have little or no effect on total, LDL, or HDL 
cholesterol concentrations. These protocols may also 
be beneficial for lowering blood pressure, but a minimum 
weight loss of 6% may be required to see an effect. In-
termittent fasting may also be effective for decreasing 
fasting insulin and IR, but fasting glucose remains largely 
unchanged. Future work in this area should aim to exam-
ine whether these effects still persist in longer-term (>52 
weeks) randomized, controlled trials.
Meal Frequency
To date, 9 trials90–98 have been performed that examined 
the impact of meal frequency without calorie restriction 
on CHD risk. These trials implemented the following 
meal frequency regimens: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 17 meals 
a day. The effects of these diets on key cardiometabolic 
risk factors are displayed in Table 2.
Because calorie restriction was not imposed in any 
of the trials reviewed,90–98 body weight remained un-
changed for all studies (Table 2). We intentionally chose 
not to include meal frequency studies that also applied 
calorie restriction because the effect of meal frequency 
on weight status would be difficult to isolate from that 
of weight loss. One study assessed the impact of meal 
frequency on energy expenditure in overweight women 
in a metabolic chamber.99 Eight to 10 women partici-
pated in 3 separate studies testing consumption of 2 
meals served at 11 am and 7 pm or 6 meals served every 
2 hours between 9 am and 7 pm. In 1 study, additional 
foods could be consumed outside of those times, and 
in the third study, the 6-meal pattern was compared with 
4 meals served at 1, 2, 5, and 7 pm. The third study 
also allowed additional food intake. No differences were 
observed between meal patterns in any of the 3 studies 
on total energy expenditure or energy balance. Howev-
er, nighttime energy expenditure was higher in the first 
study when participants were given 2 meals compared 
with 6 meals. Nevertheless, these studies do not sug-
gest a role of meal frequency on energy metabolism.
One study examined the effects of low versus high 
eating frequency on appetite (n=12 men and women;

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
age, 18–50 years; BMI ≥18 kg/m2).100 Participants con-
sumed 3 or 8 equally spaced meals daily for 21 days in 
a randomized, crossover design. Body weight and waist-
to-hip ratio did not change during the study. After the 
21-day period, appetite was assessed over a 4-hour win-
dow. In the low eating frequency condition, 1 meal was 
served, whereas in the high eating frequency condition, 
2 meals were served. In each condition, participants 
consumed 33% of their energy requirements over the 
testing period. Mean hunger ratings were significantly 
lower in the low compared with the high eating frequency 
condition, but the area under the curve for the entire 
testing session did not differ between conditions. The 
mean and area under the curve over the entire session 
for desire-to-eat ratings were lower in the low eating fre-
quency condition compared with the high eating frequen-
cy condition. The mean composite score for appetite 
and the area under the curve for the entire testing period 
were higher in the high eating frequency condition com-
pared with the low eating frequency condition. This small 
study does not support the conclusion that increasing 
eating frequency reduces appetite.
The effects of various meal frequency strategies on 
total and LDL cholesterol are reported in Table 2. The 
greatest reductions in total cholesterol (16%) and LDL 
cholesterol (18%) concentrations were observed when 
normocholesterolemic men consumed 17 meals a day 
for 2 weeks.92 Consuming 9 meals a day reduced total 
and LDL cholesterol by 10% and 14%,94 respectively; 
consuming 6 meals a day lowered total cholesterol 
by 1% to 8% and LDL cholesterol by 6% to 8%91,97,98; 
and consuming 3 meals a day resulted in little or no 
change.90–96 Interestingly, in a controlled feeding study,90 
participants who ate all of their daily energy needs in 1 
sitting had increases in total and LDL cholesterol lev-
els of 19% and 25%, respectively, after 8 weeks. Taken 
together, these findings indicate that increasing meal 
frequency may reduce cholesterol levels, whereas de-
creasing meal frequency may have unfavorable effects. 
However, it is important to note that macronutrient distri-
bution did not change from baseline to after treatment in 
any of the studies reviewed here.90–98 Average dietary fat 
intake ranged from 30% to 40% of daily energy needs, 
and in most studies, participants were consuming at 
least 35% of energy as fat and at least 10% of energy 
from saturated fat.70,90,91,93,95,97,98 We also observed that 
diets providing >35% of energy as fat may negate the 
improvements observed as a result of increased meal 
frequency. For example, in a study providing 9 meals 
a day in the context of a low-fat diet (28% of energy as 
fat),94 total and LDL cholesterol concentrations were re-
duced by 10% and 14%, respectively. In contrast, when 
the background diet provided 35% of energy as fat,95 
there was no effect of increasing meal frequency to 9 
meals a day. Thus, the increased meal frequency pattern 
may be more effective at lowering total and LDL choles-
terol when combined with lower-fat diets (<30% energy 
as fat). The reason for this is not apparent.
The impact of meal frequency on HDL cholesterol 
concentrations has also been assessed (Table 2). In 
a randomized, crossover trial,90 HDL cholesterol was 
augmented by 17% from baseline when participants ate 
all of their energy needs as 1 meal a day for 8 weeks 
but remained unchanged when 3 meals a day were con-
sumed. These modulations in HDL cholesterol appear 
to be independent of dietary macronutrient composi-
tion because dietary cholesterol and fatty acid intakes 
were held constant. Increasing meal frequency to 6, 
9, 12, or 17 meals a day did not affect HDL choles-
terol concentrations.91–98 These findings suggest that 
increasing meal frequency under isocaloric conditions 
has little effect on HDL cholesterol levels. The reason 
why increases in HDL cholesterol were observed with 
a reduction in meal frequency to 1 meal a day remains 
unclear.90 Additional studies are needed to confirm this 
observation.
Studies suggest that altering meal frequency has no 
significant impact on triglyceride concentrations (Ta-
ble 2).90–98 Although several studies report large numeric 
reductions in triglyceride levels,91,92,94,95 none of these re-
ductions were significantly different when posttreatment 
values were compared with baseline values. This lack 
of a significant difference in triglyceride concentrations 
is most likely attributable to the large variability in sub-
ject responses reported in each trial.91,92,94,95 Moreover, 
it is worth noting that these studies have not compared 
the effects of the intervention relative to the control but 
rather performed within-group comparison.
Only 1 study reported a significant impact of meal 
frequency on blood pressure (Table 2).90 Results indicate 
that consuming 1 meal a day increases both systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures (1% increase from baseline) af-
ter 8 weeks of treatment. When these same individuals 
crossed over to a regimen of 3 meals a day, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 6% and 4%, 
respectively.90 In other studies that examined the impact 
of 3 or 9 meals a day on blood pressure,94,95 no change 
was noted after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. Whether 
blood pressure would be affected with longer treatment 
duration remains uncertain.
Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were ex-
amined in the majority of studies reviewed here (Table 2). 
Results from these small, uncontrolled, short-term trials 
indicate that consuming a few meals per day (ie, 1 or 3 
meals a day)90–96 or several meals per day (ie, 6, 9, 12, 
or 17 meals a day)91–98 has no effect on either fasting 
glucose or insulin in the absence of weight loss.
Preliminary studies suggest that consuming 3 or 
6 meals a day under isocaloric conditions for 2 to 4 
weeks has no effect on IR.96,97 These results are not 
surprising because glucose and insulin did not change 
during these trials.

These findings should be interpreted with caution, 
however, because each of these trials has several limita-
tions. First, all of these trials lacked a control group, and 
very few studies implemented a controlled feeding pro-
tocol.70,90–98 Second, sample sizes of the various study 
arms were quite small (n=7–19),90,92 and the studies 
may have lacked power to detect significant differences 
within or between groups. In view of these limitations, 
larger-scale and longer-term controlled trials will be re-
quired before any definitive conclusions can be reached 
on the impact of meal frequency on these cardiometa-
bolic risk parameters. Further insight into the effects of 
meal frequency on the long-term risk of clinical events 
such as CVD or diabetes mellitus may be gained through 
observational studies in free-living individuals. Moreover, 
the impact of meal frequency on TEI should be examined 
because increasing meal frequency may lead to undesir-
able increases in intakes that could lead to weight gain.
Summary
Altering meal frequency under isocaloric conditions may 
not be useful for decreasing body weight or improving 
traditional cardiometabolic risk factors.
MEAL TIMING AND CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK: 
OBSERVATIONAL FINDINGS
Late-night eating has been associated with a greater risk 
of poor cardiometabolic health in several cross-sectional 
studies. Late-night eating was associated with an OR for 
obesity of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.10–2.39) compared with no 
late-night eating among 3610 Swedish men and wom-
en.50 In a small, cross-sectional study among 239 US 
adults, individuals who consumed ≥33% of their TEI in 
the evening had twice the risk of being obese (OR, 2.00; 
95% CI, 1.03–3.89) compared with individuals who con-
sumed <33% of their TEI at night.101 Additionally, the 
combination of late-night eating and skipping breakfast 
was associated with a greater risk of having the meta-
bolic syndrome among Japanese adults (n=60 
800; age, 
20–75 years).102 Compared with individuals with healthy 
eating patterns, those who ate late at night, defined as 
eating dinner within 2 hours of bedtime, and skipped 
breakfast had an OR for the metabolic syndrome of 1.17 
(95% CI, 1.08–1.28). The associations of eating frequen-
cy and timing with inflammation and IR biomarkers were 
assessed in female participants in NHANES 2009 to 
2010 (n=2212; mean age, 46.8 years).103 Independent 
variables included eating frequency (number of eating 
occasions per day), percent of TEI eaten between 5 pm 
and midnight, and nighttime fasting duration. Each 10% 
increase in the proportion of TEI consumed in the eve-
ning was associated with a 3% increase in C-reactive pro-
tein concentrations, whereas having 1 additional eating 
occasion per day was associated with an 8% decrease in 
C-reactive protein. There was no relation with nighttime 
fasting duration. None of the variables were associated 
with HOMA-IR. Interestingly, favorable effects of night-
time fasting on inflammation and IR were observed only 
in women who stopped eating before 6 pm, and lengthen-
ing nighttime fast duration by skipping breakfast did not 
have the same favorable effect. An important limitation 
to consider with these studies is that the definition of 
late-night eating differs among studies. Furthermore, the 
causality of these associations between eating patterns 
and CVD risk factors is unclear because of the cross-
sectional nature of the studies.
To date, only 1 prospective, observational, epidemio-
logical study has reported the association between late-
night eating and risk of CHD.63 In the Health Professional 
Follow-Up Study, men were asked to respond to the fol-
lowing question on a biennial questionnaire: “Please indi-
cate the time of day that you usually eat (mark all that ap-
ply): before breakfast, breakfast, between breakfast and 
lunch, lunch, between lunch and dinner, dinner, between 
dinner and bedtime, after going to bed.” Nighttime eat-
ing was defined as a positive response to eating after 
going to bed. Men with nighttime eating had a relative 
risk of CVD of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.05–2.29) compared with 
men who did not eat during the night after adjustment for 
demographic data, diet, lifestyle, and CHD risk factors. 
This association was mediated by BMI, hypercholester-
olemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. However, 
this eating behavior may be considered pathological and 
does not represent the more common late-night eating 
pattern of food consumption before bedtime. In this 
population, only 1% of the men reported late-night eating 
(n=29 cases).
MEAL TIMING AND CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK: 
CLINICAL INTERVENTION FINDINGS
Very few interventions have focused on meal timing 
and cardiometabolic risk, and most have been single-
day studies with few participants. For example, 1 study 
tested the impact of a late dinner, given at 11 pm, rela-
tive to 6 pm dinner on glucose handling after breakfast 
the following day.104 On the day before testing, standard 
meals were served at 7 am, noon, and 6 or 11 pm. Break-
fast on test day was served at 8:30 am. Orocecal tran-
sit time was longer after breakfast consumption after a 
late dinner, and unabsorbed dietary carbohydrates were 
lower compared with the usual dinnertime. In addition, in 
these 12 young, healthy, normal-weight women, glucose 
was higher after breakfast in the late dinner condition 
compared with the usual dinner condition. The authors 
concluded that eating a late dinner could increase the 
risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus because high postpran-
dial glucose is a risk factor for this disorder. Conversely, 
a high-energy breakfast was also tested in women with 
polycystic ovary syndrome over a 12-week period.105

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
Young, normal-weight women were randomized to con-
sume an 1800-kcal diet with energy distribution among 
meals being either 54%, 35%, and 11% or 11%, 35%, 
and 54% TEI distribution at breakfast, lunch, and din-
ner, respectively. Women were instructed to consume 
breakfast between 6 and 9 am, lunch between noon and 
3 pm, and dinner between 6 and 9 pm. Compliance was 
assessed from biweekly 3-day diet records. There was 
no difference in change in BMI, waist circumference, and 
adiposity between groups. However, metabolic risk fac-
tors changed differently between groups. Women in the 
group who ate a large breakfast had reductions in fast-
ing plasma glucose and insulin, along with a decrease in 
HOMA-IR and an increase in the insulin sensitivity index. 
There was no change in those parameters in women in 
the group who ate a large dinner. Oral glucose tolerance 
test glucose and insulin areas under the curve were also 
reduced in the breakfast group to a greater extent than 
in the dinner group. The authors concluded that the im-
provement in IR in the group consuming a large break-
fast implies an eating schedule that is synchronized with 
the circadian pacemaker but that consuming a larger din-
ner does not worsen IR in these women.
This beneficial effect of a larger breakfast on the car-
diometabolic risk profile is not universally observed, how-
ever. During Ramadan fasting, individuals eat breakfast 
30 minutes before sunrise and eat dinner after sunset. 
Adult men with the metabolic syndrome were studied 
during this month, in which 58% of their TEI was con-
sumed in the evening.106 Self-reported TEI was reduced 
by ≈56 kcal/d, and body weight and waist circumference 
decreased by 2.4% during the month of Ramadan. Fast-
ing plasma glucose and systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sures decreased, and HDL cholesterol and insulin sensi-
tivity increased, but fasting plasma insulin, triglycerides, 
and HOMA-IR did not change. The authors concluded that 
Ramadan fasting can improve some metabolic risk fac-
tors, but several limitations in this study are worth noting. 
There was no control group, and data were not adjusted 
for change in body weight or waist circumference. More-
over, discordant results were observed on 2 measures 
of IR. Therefore, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn.
Other studies have focused on the amount and type of 
carbohydrates and cardiometabolic risk factors.107,108 In 
a small study (n=6) of young, normal-weight adults, diets 
with low (34) versus high (84) glycemic index provided 
either mostly in the morning (60%, 20%, and 20% TEI at 
breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively) or in the eve-
ning (20%, 20%, and 60% TEI at breakfast, lunch, and 
dinner, respectively) were compared for their short-term 
effects on glycemia with a 2×2 factorial design.107 Meals 
were served at 9:30 am, 1:30 pm, and 8:30 pm, and blood 
samples were collected before and for 2 hours after each 
meal. Glucose and insulin areas under the curve were 
highest for the diet with a high glycemic index with the 
greater percent of energy provided in the evening. This 
was significant compared with all other diets for glucose 
and relative to the diets with low glycemic index for insu-
lin. Triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids were not 
affected by the glycemic index of the diets or the shift in 
caloric load between morning and evening. The authors 
suggested that eating patterns with the largest energy 
load in the evening may contribute to metabolic syn-
drome through deterioration of postprandial glucose and 
insulin and that avoiding large meals with a high glycemic 
index in the evening could improve glycemic profile.
One longer-term study tested whether changing both 
the carbohydrate content and the energy content of 
meals affected weight loss and weight loss maintenance 
in obese adult men and women.108 Participants were in-
structed to follow a low-calorie diet with either a low- or 
high-carbohydrate (10% versus 20% of TEI, respectively) 
and –energy content breakfast for 16 weeks; follow-up 
continued after intervention for an additional 16 weeks. 
The low-carbohydrate, low-energy breakfast diet provid-
ed 300 kcal at breakfast and 600 to 700 kcal at dinner, 
whereas the high-carbohydrate, high-energy breakfast 
diet provided 600 kcal at breakfast and 300 to 400 kcal 
at dinner. The higher energy content of breakfast was 
achieved by including dessert for the high-carbohydrate 
group (chocolate, ice cream, cookies, cake, etc). Dur-
ing follow-up, participants were encouraged to continue 
their intervention dietary pattern. Weight loss was similar 
between groups during the intervention phase, but the 
high-carbohydrate group continued to lose weight during 
follow-up, whereas the low-carbohydrate group gained 
weight. This resulted in significantly different body 
weights between groups at the end of the follow-up pe-
riod. Similar results were observed for glucose, insulin, 
and HOMA-IR. After the intervention, triglycerides were 
significantly lower and HDL cholesterol was significantly 
higher in the high-carbohydrate group. After follow-up, 
those differences remained, and total cholesterol and 
LDL cholesterol were also reduced in the high-carbo-
hydrate compared with the low-carbohydrate group. In 
line with the greater weight loss observed in the high-
carbohydrate group, craving scores were lower and the 
ghrelin nadir in response to a breakfast meal challenge 
decreased to a greater extent in the high-carbohydrate 
compared with the low-carbohydrate group at follow-up. 
This study had unusually high weight loss for an outpa-
tient intervention study (≈21 kg), and the level of carbo-
hydrate intake in both groups was extremely low (<100 
g, on average).
Data from the above studies suggest that consuming 
a larger percentage of energy later in the day may lead to 
an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile, but these stud-
ies have major limitations. However, a separate study 
showed that providing 35 g of available starch from 
brown beans versus white wheat bread at dinner leads 
to a 23% lower glucose response and 16% lower insulin 
response after breakfast the following day.109 Interleu-

kin-6 and interleukin-18 were also lower after breakfast 
consumed the day after the brown bean evening meal.
Another study tested whether late-night eating, with-
out altering meal frequency, alters energy and glucose 
metabolism.110 Eleven young, normal-weight women con-
sumed a 200-kcal snack (45% carbohydrates, 50% fat) 
at 10 am or 11 pm for 13 days in a randomized, crossover 
study. Body weight did not differ between phases. There 
were no differences in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, 
nonesterified fatty acids, adiponectin, leptin, and oral glu-
cose tolerance test glucose and insulin areas under the 
curve between snack patterns. Despite these results, the 
authors concluded that having late snacks could increase 
the risk of obesity and CVD. However, given the lack of 
significant difference between groups in metabolic risk 
factors, the data do not fully support this conclusion.
More extreme patterns of eating during nighttime 
hours were tested in a shift-work paradigm.111,112 In 1 
study, 11 female nurses were tested over 3 days of 
night-shift work.111 Glycemic response to standard meals 
containing 440 kcal provided at 7:30 pm, 11:30 pm, and 
3:30 am was assessed over 4 hours. Basal glucose was 
similar before each meal, but postprandial concentra-
tions were higher after the meal consumed at 11:30 pm. 
Basal insulin was highest before the 11:30 pm meal and 
lowest at 3:30 am; postprandial values followed the same 
pattern. The authors concluded that glucose tolerance 
was lower around midnight, as the circadian oscillations 
would predict, and proposed that the rise in CHD risk 
in night workers could be attributable to deregulated 
coupling of food intake to the circadian system. Further-
more, they posited that food quality and timing could play 
a role in metabolic responses to meals. The other study 
was performed in 8 young, lean men.112 Participants 
were randomized to simulated day or night work for a 
single shift in a crossover design. The day shift occurred 
at noon to 8 pm with meals provided at 1 pm and 7 pm and 
a snack at 4 pm; the night shift was performed at mid-
night to 8 am with meals at 1 and 7 am and a snack given 
at 4 am. Diets were identical in both phases. Glucose and 
triglyceride concentrations were higher during the night 
shift compared with the day shift. The authors reported 
relative lipid intolerance throughout the night shift with 
metabolic recovery of glucose tolerance toward the end 
of the night shift and suggested that restricting fat intake 
throughout the night would be beneficial. However, this 
was not directly tested in this study.
Even less extreme shifts in food intake could influence 
cardiometabolic risk status. A 2-week intervention study 
tested the effects of early (1 pm) or late (4:30 pm) lunch 
on glucose tolerance in young, normal-weight women 
(n=32; mean age, 24 years; BMI, 22.9 kg/m2).113 Post-
prandial glucose area under the curve was increased by 
46% relative to the early lunch condition. In addition, con-
sumption of a late lunch blunted the daily cortisol profile. 
The authors concluded that delaying the timing of an 
identical meal for 1 week reduced glucose tolerance. 
However, because breakfast consumption occurred at 
a fixed time, 8 am throughout the study, these results 
may be attributable to the longer intermeal interval in the 
late lunch condition relative to early lunch. It is unknown 
whether similar results would be observed if meals were 
consumed at similar intervals from one another, and the 
contributions of fasting duration and circadian cycle to 
these markers could not be distinguished.
Given the seemingly negative health effects of eating 
late during the day, studies have examined whether restrict-
ing food intake to earlier daytime hours would affect cardio-
metabolic health markers. In 1 study, men were asked not 
to eat between 7 pm and 6 am daily for 2 weeks or to con-
tinue their regular eating pattern (n=27; mean age, 20.9 
years; BMI, 24.4 kg/m2).114 TEI was reduced when night 
eating was not permitted, resulting in a 0.4-kg weight loss 
compared with a 0.6-kg weight gain during the control pe-
riod. Similarly, in a small pilot study (n=8) in which food in-
take was limited to a self-determined 10- to 12-hour window 
during the day, body weight decreased by 3.3 kg over 16 
weeks.2 This study did not include a control group. Never-
theless, both studies suggested that restricting the period 
of time during which food consumption occurs could be 
a promising method for weight management.2,114
Summary
The impact of meal timing, particularly related to the 
evening meal, deserves further study. Epidemiological 
findings suggest a potential detrimental effect of late 
meals on cardiometabolic health, but clinical interven-
tion studies, which would address causality, have been 
limited in scope and too diverse to draw definitive con-
clusions and make recommendations. Moreover, the 
potential benefit of increased meal frequency should be 
evaluated in the context of timing and duration of the 
daily prandial period.
RESEARCH GAPS IN DEFINING MEALS AND 
EATING OCCASIONS
Studies have suggested that eating late in the day or 
skipping breakfast may be associated with weight gain 
and obesity, whereas intermittent fasting and high meal 
frequency may have beneficial cardiometabolic health 
effects.48,55 However, research in this field has been im-
peded by the lack of consensus on the definition of a 
meal, snack, and meal timing. Two common definitions 
have been identified to distinguish between meals and 
snacks based on (1) participant identification of a meal, 
labeled as breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and supper, 
and snack, labeled as snack, morning or afternoon tea, or 
beverage break, and (2) time-of-day reports, with a meal 
being the largest eating occasion within each time period:

6 to 10 am, noon to 3 pm, and 7 to 9 pm, with all other eat-
ing occasions being labeled as snacks.115 Another defini-
tion that has been used to distinguish between meals and 
snacks is the contribution of the eating occasion to the 
TEI, with a meal providing ≥15% of TEI, regardless of the 
time of day or type of food or beverage consumed.116 
Eating occasions contributing to <15% of TEI would be 
labeled as snacks. This cut point to distinguish between 
meals and snacks was based on US national data of usual 
energy intakes from self-defined meals and snacks. An-
other definition used by these investigators is based on 
time of day: A meal is any eating occasion that occurs 
between 6 and 10 am, noon and 3 pm, and 6 and 9 pm; 
snacks are eating occasions that occur outside of these 
time periods.116 This is distinct from the previous defini-
tion (No. 2), in which only 1 meal, defined as the largest 
eating occasion, can occur within each time period.
There are concerns about using time of day as a means 
of defining meals and snacks because this is restrictive to 
specific cultures and may not be appropriate for some 
population subgroups such as night or shift workers. For 
example, 1 definition uses the time period between 6 and 
9 pm to categorize evening meals in a British population.116 
Meanwhile, median time of the dinner meal in a Spanish 
population was reported to be 9:30 pm.117 Therefore, a so-
cially and cross-culturally appropriate definition for meals 
and snacks should not contain predefined time periods to 
designate between these eating occasions. The use of 
eating occasion, which encompasses meals and snacks, 
is a preferable term. Several definitions of eating occa-
sions have been put forth. For example, eating occasions 
could be separate occurrences if they are at least 15, 30, 
or 60 minutes apart or have a minimum energy content of 
210 kJ and are 15, 30, or 60 minutes apart.115 Another 
definition is one in which at least 210 kJ is consumed 
with distinct eating episodes ≥45 minutes apart.118 When 
6 definitions of eating occasions based on time between 
occurrences of 15, 30, and 60 minutes and inclusion of, 
or no regard to, minimum energy provision of 210 kJ were 
compared, the definition of eating occasions as eating 
episodes providing at least 210 kJ occurring 15 minutes 
apart best predicted the variance in TEI.115
If meals and snacks must be distinguished, then a 
definition based on the contribution of the eating occa-
sion to TEI may be used. When meals are defined as 
eating occasions providing ≥15% of TEI, meal frequency 
has been positively associated with the Mediterranean 
Diet Score, an index of the healthfulness of a diet, in 
both men and women, but when defined by time peri-
ods, this was significant only in women.116 Snacking, on 
the other hand, was associated with unfavorable dietary 
intake patterns for both men and women, regardless of 
the definition used.
On the basis of the current information, we propose 
that eating occasions be defined as any eating/drinking 
episode providing at least 210 kJ and that 15 minutes 
should be the minimum amount of time elapsed between 
separate occasions. Distinguishing between meals and 
snacks should be left to the participant’s discretion. This 
will provide a definition that accommodates different so-
cial norms and cultural behaviors. However, we under-
stand that information on participant-based categorization 
of meals and snacks is not always collected in surveys 
and various studies. In such instances, a definition of 
breakfast could be adapted and generalized to meals.9 
Breakfast has been defined as the first meal of the day 
that breaks the fast after the longest period of sleep, 
occurs within 2 to 3 hours of awakening, and contains 
foods and beverages from at least 1 food group.9 A high-
quality breakfast would provide 15% to 25% of total en-
ergy requirements with 10% of the daily value for as many 
nutrients as possible and 20% for nutrients of concern, 
identified as calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and fiber. With 
this scenario, we propose that an established definition of 
breakfast9 be adopted and all other meals be defined as 
eating occasions providing ≥15% of TEI. Eating occasions 
providing <15% of TEI would be categorized as snacks.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
The data reviewed here suggest that even when consider-
ing a wide range of definitions for meals and snacks, irreg-
ular patterns of TEI appear less favorable for the mainte-
nance of body weight and optimal cardiometabolic health. 
Ultimately, clinicians may be able to use this information 
to suggest to patients that a more intentional approach to 
eating that focuses on the timing and frequency of meals 
and snacks could be the basis of a healthier lifestyle and 
improved risk factor management. An intentional ap-
proach to eating requires eating at planned intervals to 
distribute TEI throughout the day (Table 3). This may be 
challenging for many because time constraints limit meal 
planning and preparation, leading to increased use of con-
venience food items (eg, fast food, vending machines) 
and haphazard eating supported by an environment with 
readily accessible food options.119–121 What results is a 
poor-quality diet with large portions that are often energy 
dense but nutrient poor.
Although more direct translational research is still 
needed, these data suggest that intervening on meal 
timing and frequency may be beneficial. By focusing 
on meal frequency and timing as an intervention target, 
patients may directly address poor dietary quality with-
out the need to deal with calorie restriction to promote 
weight loss. Ultimately, the clinician’s goal may be to 
help the patient spread energy intake over a defined por-
tion of the day in a more balanced way rather than lim-
ited to 1 segment of the day or continuously over long 
periods of time (ie, grazing). This does not mean that 
TEI and macronutrient balance can be ignored but simply 
that the frequency and timing of intake are the basis for 
building the structure for intentional eating.

One of the challenges of translating the findings re-
viewed here into clinical practice is the limited value of 
some of the definitions of meals and snacks. In Research 
Gaps in Defining Meals and Eating Occasions, we review 
and propose definitions for meals and snacks to be used 
for research purposes. However, from a practical per-
spective, people rarely think of meals or snacks as be-
ing defined by the amount of calories provided within 
the foods they consume. Studies show that cues such 
as time of day, portion size, food type, and preparation 
are more likely to be the bases for categorizing an eat-
ing episode as a meal or a snack.122,123 Furthermore, 
most people do not consider energy-containing bever-
ages, with the exception of meal replacements, as 
stand-alone snacks or meals, although they would meet 
our proposed definition of such because of their energy 
content.124 Consequently, it may be best to frame dis-
cussions with patients by using language and references 
that the individual patient can identify with when counsel-
ing on the timing and frequency of eating episodes.
Another major challenge of addressing meal timing 
and frequency that is highlighted in the research re-
viewed here is the understanding that eating occasions 
are influenced by previous eating episodes, and thus, 
making adjustments in 1 period of the day or meal/
snack timing has an influence on other opportunities 
for consumption. Meal timing and frequency may be as 
much about the amount of time between eating episodes 
as about the types and amounts of energy consumed 
at each eating episode. Many of the studies reviewed 
included controlled calorie conditions without opportuni-
ties for ad libitum intake. When calorie intake is not con-
trolled, it is plausible to hypothesize that a longer interval 
between eating episodes leads to greater consumption 
at the next available eating opportunity. However, it is 
clear from the data that longer periods of time between 
eating episodes during the day may have different impli-
cations from longer overnight fast periods.
Although most of the research reviewed in this docu-
ment was not in the setting of weight reduction interven-
tions, given that 1 in 3 adults in the United States is 
obese, understanding how meal frequency and timing 
influence energy balance may be helpful clinically.125 In-
termittent fasting approaches appear to be feasible to 
help patients lower calorie intake consistently. More data 
are needed on longer-term outcomes for weight reduc-
tion and risk factor modification. Additionally, the use 
of intermittent fasting for weight loss maintenance is a 
strategy that should be tested empirically. In the long 
run, approaches such as intermittent fasting may simply 
provide another way to help patients be more intentional 
about consuming energy within a given time period.
Focusing on meal timing and frequency as a starting 
point to address obesity and positive energy balance ap-
pears to be beneficial for several reasons on the basis of 
the data reviewed here. First, the data suggest that mak-
ing changes that promote more regular intake of energy 
during the day, perhaps with a greater proportion of calo-
ries earlier in the day, has positive effects on risk factors 
for heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Several of the 
studies suggest that this may also have positive effects 
on body weight, but randomized, controlled trials are 
needed to test this hypothesis. Second, this approach 
may be a better way to focus on improving dietary quality 
because added eating episodes can be used to introduce 
a wider variety of healthful food options. Finally, if and 
when the individual is ready to reduce calories, having 
an intake structure on which to superimpose calorie re-
striction may improve the patient’s ability to adhere to 
the weight loss plan. Given the fact that eating episodes 
are influenced by each other, portion control may be 
achieved more easily in the context of planned meals and 
snacks timed throughout the day to help manage hunger.
Eating frequency may also be influenced by eating 
speed, which was not evaluated in the present docu-
ment. A meta-analysis on this topic has reported a small 
to medium effect of eating rate on energy intakes at a 
meal, with lower intakes when eating speed is slow.126 
The difference in energy intakes was proportional to the 
difference in eating speed. However, there was no effect 
of eating rate on hunger after the meal and no differ-
ence in hunger ratings between meals of fixed content 
eaten at different speeds. In a fixed-meal study, meal 
duration (30 versus 10 min) had no effect on appetite 
and hunger hormones or feelings of hunger or fullness 
after the meal.127 Intakes throughout the rest of the day 
also were not different between eating speed conditions. 
Given that high heterogeneity between studies has been 
reported126 and that no studies have assessed long-term

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIAL 
POPULATIONS
Although the research reviewed here generally supports 
an intentional eating approach with planned distribution 
of daily TEI for both weight management and cardiomet-
abolic health, this body of work is limited in its investi-
gation of vulnerable populations. There are established 
racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of obesity128 
and CVD.129,130 With respect to obesity, black women, 
Mexican American women, Native Americans, and Pacif-
ic Islanders are disproportionately affected.128 Similarly, 
death rates from heart disease are up to 3 times greater 
for blacks in the United States,129,131 and hypertension 
among blacks is among the highest worldwide.129 De-
spite the increased risk among these groups, the major-
ity of studies available for review here did not include 
these populations or failed to report the racial/ethnic dis-
tribution of their samples. With known cultural variations 
in dietary intake, including TEI, meal frequency, and meal 
timing, adequate representation of racial/ethnic groups 
at higher risk is needed to increase confidence in gen-
eralizing findings from earlier studies. Furthermore, fu-
ture research should include racially/ethnically diverse 
samples, a full description of the sample in publications, 
and subgroup analysis (as appropriate) and should spe-
cifically discuss limitations of findings relative to the level 
of diversity in their sample.132
There has also been limited published research in-
vestigating meal patterns and frequency among children 
and adolescents and body weight and other metabolic 
risk factors, although there has been tremendous focus 
on childhood obesity and early predictors of CVD risk.133 
Evidence from this scant body of literature primarily 
mirrors findings in adult populations. Namely, there is 
support for regular and more frequent main meals to 
lower obesity risk134,135 among children and adolescents. 
Youths with less frequent eating are more likely to have 
greater body weight, even after adjustment for other 
confounders.134 Likewise, skipping meals is associated 
with higher metabolic risk (eg, higher BMI, waist circum-
ference, fasting serum insulin, and fasting plasma glu-
cose; decreased fasting plasma HDL).134,136 Again, more 
research with diverse samples of children and adoles-
cents is needed to increase confidence in the findings of 
the aforementioned studies.
Finally, there is a critical need to better understand the 
implications of dietary patterns and frequency on CVD risk 
among older adults. In 2014, 46.2 million individuals ≥65 
years of age were living in the United States (14.5% of 
the population). Over the next 25 years, it is expected 
that older Americans will grow to 22% of the US popula-
tion. The nutritional needs of the elderly are complicated 
by the need to moderate caloric intake for weight man-
agement and CVD prevention while balancing the need to 
address nutritional deficiencies associated with diets of 
older adults.137 For example, a recent research review ex-
plored the potential risks and benefits of calorie restriction 
among the elderly and urged caution as a result of mixed 
results from clinically based efficacy trials and a lack of 
effectiveness and community-based studies.138 Most CVD 
prevention research has focused on younger adults; how-
ever, with the growing number of older adults and increas-
es in the average life expectancy, more research on the 
nutrition behaviors of this group is warranted.
