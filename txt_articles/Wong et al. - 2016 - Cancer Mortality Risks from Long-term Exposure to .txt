Abstract
Background: Few studies have assessed long-term effects of
particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mm
(PM2.5) on mortality for causes of cancer other than the lung; we
assessed the effects on multiple causes. In Hong Kong, most
people live and work in urban or suburban areas with high-rise
buildings. This facilitates the estimation of PM2.5 exposure of
individuals, taking into account the height of residence above
ground level for assessment of the long-term health effects with
sufficient statistical power.
Methods: We recruited 66,820 persons who were �65 in 1998
to 2001 and followed up for mortality outcomes until 2011.
Annual concentrations of PM at their residential addresses were
estimated using PM2.5 concentrations measured at fixed-site
monitors, horizontal–vertical locations, and satellite data. We
used Cox regression model to assess the HR of mortality for cancer
per 10 mg/m3 increase of PM2.5.
Results: PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of mortality
for all causes of cancer [HR, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.11–1.34)] and for
specific cause of cancer in upper digestive tract [1.42 (1.06–1.89)],
digestive accessory organs [1.35 (1.06–1.71)] in all subjects;
breast [1.80 (1.26–2.55)] in females; and lung [1.36 (1.05–
1.77)] in males.
Conclusions: Long-term exposures to PM2.5are associated with
elevated risks of cancer in various organs.
Impact: This study is particularly timely in China, where
compelling evidence is needed to support the pollution control
policy to ameliorate the health damages associated with econom-
ic growth. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(5); 839–45. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Emissions from transportation and power generation are the
major sources of carcinogenic hydrocarbons and heavy metals in
particulate matter(PM; ref.1). Long-term exposure to PMhas been
associated with mortality mainly from cardiopulmonary causes
and lung cancer, but there have been few studies showing an
association with mortality from other cancers (2–11). Two main
biologic mechanisms to explain PM-associated cancer mortality
have been postulated: first, an effect of oxidative stress induced by
PM on epithelial cells to produce reactive oxygen species that can
damage DNA, proteins, and lipids (12); and second, an effect of
inflammation induced directly or indirectly by PM, leading to the
production of chemokines and cytokines to trigger angiogenesis,
allowing epithelial invasion of metastatic tumor cells and then
survival of the invading malignant cells in distant organs (13). It is
plausible that PM-associated carcinogenic risk could appear in
organs other than the nasal cavities and lungs, but there are few
epidemiologic studies addressing the postulation. This was a
prospective cohort study; the methods before taking into account
of floor level in estimation of theexposure andresults on mortality
for all-natural and cardio-respiratory causes have been published
(14). In this study, we assessed the associations of mortality for
various causes of cancer with long-term exposure to PM.
Materials and Methods
Subjects and individual information
A total of 18 Elderly Health Centres were established to deliver
health examinations and primary care services for older adults in
Hong Kong by the Elderly Health Service of the Department of
Health of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Adminis-
trative Region that aimed to promote the health of elderly pop-
ulation in each district and to enhance self-care ability so as to
minimize illness and disability. Nurses and doctors of the Elderly
Health Centres that are located in each of the 18 districts in Hong
Kong provided health assessment, using standardized and struc-
tured interviews, and comprehensive clinical examinations. Infor-
mation on sociodemographic, lifestyles, and disease history was
collected as described in a previous study using the data collected
by the Elderly Health Service (15). This study covered all 66,820
enrollees from July 1998 to December 2001, who were recruited
on voluntary basis, accounting for 9% of the 65 or older popu-
lation at the baseline year (the sampling fractions ranging from
6.6%–17.5% of the population older than 65 years of age in each

 district; ref.16). The protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority
Hong Kong West Cluster and the ethics committee of the Depart-
ment of Health.
Follow-up
Vital status and causes of death were ascertained by record
linkage to death registration in Hong Kong using the unique Hong
Kong identity card number. The last date of follow-up or censor
date was December 31, 2011. Causes of death were routinely
coded using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th
Revision before 2001 and 10th Revision in or after 2001. Most of
the Hong Kong residents died in hospital, ensuring accurate
ascertainment of the cause of death. Those whose vital status
could not be determined were assumed to be alive.
Mortality outcomes
The cause of death was coded by both ICD-9 and ICD-10 over
the study period from 1998 and was based on the underlying
cause of death according to the underlying etiology or injury that
initiated the chain of morbid events leading directly to death. The
mortality causes considered in this study were subcategories of
cancer, which accounted for at least 100 deaths. They were: all
malignant neoplasms or cancers ICD10:C00-C99 (or ICD9:140-
209). Subcategories of cancers included were: all digestive organs
C15-C26 (150–159) which were subdivided into (i) upper diges-
tive tract C15-16 (150–151), including esophagus and stomach,
(ii) lower digestive tract C17-21 (152–154), including small
intestine, colon, rectum, appendix, and anus, and (iii) accessory
organs C22-25 (155–157), including liver, gall bladder, and
pancreas; lung, including trachea C33-C34 (162); breast C50
(174); female genital C51-C58 (179–184); male genital C60-
C63 (185–187); urinary C64-C68 (188–189); and lymphohema-
topoietic C81-C96 (200–209). To assess the specificity, we
assessed the causes of poisoning and injuries (S00–Y98) mortal-
ity, which was considered to be unrelated to PM exposure.
Individual, ecological, and environmental covariates
On the basis of the data from a standardized questionnaire,
we included individual covariates of age, gender, body mass
index (BMI), smoking status, exercise frequency, education
level, and personal monthly expenditure. On the basis of
census statistics in 197 land areas, by the Tertiary Planning
Units (16), we included ecological covariates in percentage of
older subjects (aged 65þ), percentage with tertiary education,
and monthly domestic household income. From 18 districts of
Hong Kong, we included environmental covariates in percent-
age of smokers (aged 15þ) for the indication of exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke in each year. On the basis of ad
hoc survey, we included ground radon levels (kBqm�3) in 1 � 1
km grid of a data map (17–19).
Exposure estimation model
We calculated annual mean concentrations (mg/m3) of PM with
aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mm (PM2.5) based on the data from 5
stations run by the Environmental Protection Department, which
has monitored hourly concentrations of the pollutants by tapered
element oscillating microbalance from 1998 until 2011. In all the
locations, we obtained their geospatial height above the mean sea
level and the satellite information in 1 � 1 km grids of surface
extinction coefficients (20–22). Then, we fitted regression models
to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using surface extinction coeffi-
cients and inverse geospatial height (i.e., 1/height) of the resi-
dential location above the mean sea level as independent
variables.
We geocoded all residential addresses of the subjects and
matched them with the surface extinction coefficients data.
We calculated the vertical height of each address based on the
floor number. Using the abovementioned exposure model, we
estimated the annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 in each
residential location. We then compared the estimates with the
results independently obtained from a deterministic model
based on street canyon geometry, traffic census, air pollution,
and meteorologic data for an area where the data were
available (23).
Statistical analysis
For each organ-specific cancer mortality dataset, we used Cox
proportional hazards model to estimate the HR of mortality
(n ¼ 60,273) for every 10 mg/m3 increase of long-term exposure
to PM2.5 concentration, with adjustment for individual, eco-
logical, and environmental covariates after excluding subjects
(9.8%) with missing data in any covariates that were men-
tioned previously. We used time-on-study from the baseline as
timescale and the estimated exposure in the subjects' recruit-
ment year (between 1998 and 2001) to represent long-term
exposure. To control for competing diseases and to assure
detection of long-term associations, we excluded deaths due
to other causes and deaths that occurred within 3 years from the
baseline year, respectively. We stratified the data by ever and
never smoker and tested for the difference by an interaction
term in the model, respectively, for male and female. We
performed the sensitivity analysis by excluding height of
address from sea level in the exposure estimation, by using
current annual mean PM2.5 as time-varying variable in the Cox
model, and by competing risks model instead of excluding
deaths from competing causes (24) or by excluding subjects
with self-reported preexisting respiratory and cardiometabolic

 diseases at baseline. Death records were the primary follow-up
information in this study (with average of 10.3 years and range
0–13 years of follow-up), but those that might have been lost to
follow-up due to a change in address or migration were not
traceable. Among the nonmissing records until the last follow-
up year, there were 16% of them who did not appear in any
formal records of adverse health events or in any questionnaire
interviews in the last 3 years, which might be due to loss to
follow-up. Therefore, we also performed the sensitivity analysis
by excluding these 16% potential loss to follow-up subjects
from the analysis. Further sensitivity analyses were performed
to exclude deaths within 5 or 7 years, subjects who had moved
during the follow-up period or had been hospitalized during
1998 to 2000, to take account of diseases that may take longer
than 3 years for the incubation period, the effect of moving
address and the effect of mixing with prevalent cases, respec-
tively. Cox models were performed using the command PHREG
in Statistical Analysis System 9.2. We plotted the relationship
between PM2.5 and deaths from all cancers using the natural
splines command COXPH in R 3.0.1 with two degrees of
freedom. As a sensitivity analysis, we also used models with
random effects set at the intercepts to take account of possible
intradistrict correlations (25, 26).

 were significant predictors. Comparison of the empirically
estimated PM concentrations with those estimated from deter-
ministic model for street canyon yielded good validation mea-
sures (Supplementary Table S1). The estimated PM2.5 mean
concentration (2.5–97.5 percentile) in the baseline year at
individual residential locations was 33.7 (29.5–39.8) mg/m3
(Fig. 1).
Subjects who were exposed to cleaner air quality tended to
be younger, had a higher BMI and were never-smokers, fre-
quent exercisers, better educated, lower in personal expendi-
ture, and were located in areas with fewer older people, higher
levels of education, higher income, and higher radon levels
(all P < 0.01). Significant covariates identified in the Cox
regression model of cancer mortality were older, male, under-
weight, ever smoked, and less educated and lived in a com-
munity with younger, less educated, and with more smoking
subjects (Table 1).
PM2.5 was associated with all-cancer mortality [HR, 1.22;
95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11–1.34] as well as cause-
specific cancer mortality, including all digestive organs (HR,
1.22; 95% CI, 1.05–1.42), upper digestive tract (HR, 1.42; 95%
CI, 1.06–1.89), and accessory digestive organs (HR, 1.35; 95%
CI, 1.06–1.71). In female, the associations were shown in
breast (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.26–2.55) and genital organs (HR,
1.73; 95% CI, 1.17–2.54; Table 2). PM2.5 was not significantly
(P > 0.05) associated with external causes. A linear concentra-
tion–response relationship between PM2.5 and all-cancer mor-
tality was shown (Fig. 2).
In the stratified analysis, PM2.5 (per 10 mg/m3 increase) was
associated with mortality due to lung cancers (HR, 1.39; 95%
CI, 1.05–1.77) among male subgroup (Table 3). The HRs in the
sensitivity analyses (Table 4) were consistent to those in the main
analyses in terms of magnitude and direction of deviation from
the null effect estimate.
Discussion
We showed that in older people, cancer mortality risks were
associated with long-term exposure to particulate air pollutants in
a typical Asian city, Hong Kong, where the people dwell mainly in
high-rise buildings. We demonstrated carcinogenic risks of PM2.5
in multiple organs and tissues using the approach for a single
prospective cohort. There are few studies in the literature com-
paring PM2.5 associations on cancer mortality among different
organs or tissues. We found stronger associations with PM2.5 in

 the upper digestive tract and accessory organs and breast than
among all-cancer or all-digestive organs. Although most of our
findings on specific cancers were not reported in the American
Cancer Society study, our observations are consistent with the
American Cancer Society study in a way that the excess risks of
specific causes were larger than those of less specific causes (9).
Our HRs per 10 mg/m3 PM2.5 for female genital cancer and for
breast cancer were about 40% to 50% higher than the reported
relative risk (1.20 and 1.19, respectively) in an ecological study of
all ages in Taiwan (27, 28). When compared with the American
Cancer Society study, our HR per 10 mg/m3 PM2.5 for all-digestive
organs and for male lung cancer was fairly similar to their
respective HR of 1.20 and 1.43, adjusted for individual covariates
and components of social factors (9).
A hypothesis for an explanation at the molecular level of the
carcinogenic effects of PM could be in terms of defects in DNA
repair function and replication (29). Effects of oxidative stress
due to air pollution have also been shown in biomarker studies
(30). However, pathologic explanations for specific cancer
mortality are rare. For digestive systems, the hypothesized
mechanisms include inflammations of gut lining epithelial
cells, following ingestion, alterations in immune response, and
effects on gut microbiota (31). These hypotheses may be
connected to aerosolized pollutants, which are trapped by
mucus and swallowed, eventually passing through the whole
digestive tract and affecting the epithelial cells and the gut
microbiota. A large-scale European case–control study of
household wood burning on esophageal cancer (32) and an
ecological Spanish study of industrial metallic aerosols on
gallbladder and pancreas cancers have also indicated similar
associations of air pollutants with cancer of the upper digestive
tract and accessory organs (33).
A human experimental study on metal species in thyroid cancer
has hypothesized environmental contamination as a possible
factor in explaining the thyroid pathology (34). Although the
evidence is still insufficient, the literature has given some support
to our findings on the PM-related cancer risks on multiple sites,
including digestive system, lung, breasts, genital organs, and
lymphohematopoietic tissues.
Most studies of the long-term associations of PM estimated
proxy exposure of individuals at the region of residence, either
using geospatial/dispersion modeling or satellite information
(5, 9, 35–38). However, the estimation of chronic health
associations of PM using intraregion spatial variation in this
study has resulted in similar HRs to those studies relying on
contrasts of multiple region-wide average exposures. The smal-
ler estimates in the latter were likely due to the greater exposure
measurement errors, which led to underestimation of the
pollution-related health burden (9). A California study showed
that associations within cities are similar as between cities, and
the difference in exposure metrics had little impact on the risk
estimates for PM2.5 (39). We found that there were no differ-
ences between estimates before and after controlling for intra-
district correlations with random effect modeling. This result
was supported by another U.S. study on incidence of cardio-
vascular events, incorporating a random effect term for
between-city and within-city effects (40).
There were limitations in this study. First, we did not address
the associations of multipollutant exposure, indoor air pollution,
chemical and physical size components of PM2.5. The roles of
PM2.5 cannot be disentangled from the other environmental
pollutants. Second, we did not assess the contribution of genetic
factors, metastasis, nor cancer-inhibitory inflammation mecha-
nism for the association, and because of that we were not able to
determine the effects of PM on susceptible groups and on cancer
development (13). Third, the short period of the study, which
does not allow the assessment of health outcomes with long
latency period, is another limitation. However, the participants
could have already been living in the same address before enroll-
ment, as the 5-year moving rates in the older population were
consistent and less than 15% in the past 10 to 15 years (41); only
9.3% of the subjects were found not residing in the same address
during the follow-up of around 10 years, and the estimates were
robust to exclusion of movers from the analysis. Fourth, most of
the subjects (93%) were retired or not working anymore. Yet, their
employment history was not known, and any previous occu-
pational exposure was not accounted for. Fifth, the daily
activities of the subjects were not assessed in details by ques-
tionnaires. However, in our sensitivity analysis, using annual
mean exposure at the year of comparison in model should
have taken account of this. Outdoor activities (e.g., travelling
to other parts of the city) or indoor activities (such as the use
of air purifiers), which would affect the exposure level of PM2.5,
were not adjusted for. Further studies to take these into account
are needed. Sixth, stage of cancer at diagnosis was not available
in our data, which may affect the choice of treatment method
and hence survival from premature death (42). However, as
the trends of PM in different geographic areas were stable over
the study period, the effect estimates may not be affected
substantially.

 Last but not the least, selection bias may be an issue due to
voluntary nature in the subject recruitment. Volunteers who were
more aware of the "new" provision of elderly health service by the
government could tend to be more conscious in seeking health
care service, which would potentially lead to underestimation of
the risk of PM in this study.
For older people who dwell in a city with a dense population
and high-rise buildings in Asia, long-term exposures to particulate
air pollutants are associated with mortality from all cancers
combined with a linear concentration–response relationship.
Associations were also found between PM2.5 and various specific
cancers, including cancer in lung, all digestive organs, breasts, and
genital organs. The magnitudes of risks are comparable with those
of other similar studies, providing further evidence to strengthen
causality and support health economic assessments of cancer-
related deaths attributable to air pollution.
