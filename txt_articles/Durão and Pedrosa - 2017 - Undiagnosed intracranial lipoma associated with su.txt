Sudden death
Intracranial lipomas represent less than 0.1% of all intracranial tumors. They are usually located in the callus area
and often asymptomatic. This paper presents a sudden death case after an episode of convulsions on a 39 years
old woman with a history of migraines and seizures since adolescence. The autopsy revealed the presence of an
undiagnosed massive brain lipoma (60 × 35 mm) associated with atrophy of the corpus callosum. Although very
rare and seldom malignant these may be associated with seizures and sudden death.

1. Introduction
Intracranial lipomas (IL) represent less than 0.1% of all cerebral tu-
mors [1–3]. They are considered congenital malformation caused by ab-
normal differentiation and persistence of the primitive meninx with
transformation to adipose tissue during subarachnoid space develop-
ment [4]. Most of IL are asymptomatic [5]. Seizures are the most com-
mon symptom [4–6].
1.1. Case report
We report the case of a 39 years old woman, obese, with an history of
seizures during adolescence, no regular medication, alcohol abuse or
cognitive impairment. Sudden death occurred after a seizure episode.
The autopsy revealed the presence of a voluminous cerebral lipoma
(60 × 35 mm) associated to corpus callosum (CC) atrophy (Fig. 1) and
pulmonary edema. There were no relevant findings except the expected
bite marks in the tongue and some bruising on the upper limbs compat-
ible with seizures. The histological examination confirmed the diagnosis
of lipoma showing that this mass was composed by fatty tissue. Toxico-
logical testing was negative to alcohol, drugs and pharmaceutical drugs.
2. Discussion
Lipomas are benign tumors composed of fat tissue and are the most
common soft tissue neoplasms of adult population. They are usually
painless and macroscopically soft and mobile. First described in 1856
by Von Rokitansky as an autopsy finding [7] their location in the central
nervous system (CNS) is extremely rare. In the CNS they are most com-
monly located in the CC [5,6].
Several theories were proposed to explain IL origin. It is believed that
defects in the reabsorption process of primitive meninx when forming
the subarachnoid space and cisterns may result in meningeal tissue im-
plantation as the source of IL cellular components. This theory explains
the location of IL in the subarachnoid space and cisterns correlating the
higher incidence of CC lipomas when compared to other CNS locations
[8,9].
Macroscopically IL can vary from infracentimetric to large masses.
They have a collagenous capsule adherent to the cerebral parenchyma.
Vascularization is dependent on the anterior cerebral arteries or
branches traversing the tumor. Eventually, a single large vessel can be
found, divided in two, the pericallosal and the calloso marginal branches
[8,9].
Microscopically IL is composed of typical adipose tissue and a cap-
sule with variable quantity of collagen fibers which can penetrate the
cerebral parenchyma in association with blood vessels. Calcifications
can occur within the lipoma, its capsule and adjacent cerebral tissue.
Due to these characteristics surgical removal is often unfeasible and
conservative treatment assumes a major role controlling seizures [10].
3. Conclusion
IL is rare, generally asymptomatic and usually a radiological or au-
topsy find. They can be associated with seizures and a variety of clinical
manifestations depending on their size and location. This case-report is
