 Medicare Part D Payments for Topical Steroids
Rising Costs and Potential Savings
Hannah Song, BA; Adewole Adamson, MD, MPP; Arash Mostaghimi, MD, MPA, MPH
IMPORTANCE Rising pharmaceutical costs in the United States are an increasing source of
financial burden for payers and patients. Although topical steroids are among the most
commonly prescribed medications in dermatology, there are limited data on steroid-related
spending and utilization.
OBJECTIVE To characterize Medicare and patient out-of-pocket costs for topical steroids, and
to model potential savings that could result from substitution of the cheapest topical steroid
from the corresponding potency class.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a retrospective cost analysis of the
Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File, which details annual drug utilization and spending
on both generic and branded drugs from 2011 to 2015 by Medicare Part D participants who
filled prescriptions for topical steroids.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total and potential Medicare and out-of-pocket patient
spending. Costs were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2015 dollars.
RESULTS Medicare Part D expenditures on topical steroids between 2011 and 2015 were $2.3
billion. Patients’ out-of-pocket spending for topical steroids over the same period was $333.7
million. The total annual spending increased from $237.6 million to $775.9 million, an increase
of 226.5%. Patients’ annual out-of-pocket spending increased from $41.4 million to $101.8
million, an increase of 145.9%. The total number of prescriptions were 7.7 million in 2011 and
10.6 million in 2015, an increase of 37.0%. Generic medication costs accounted for 97.8% of
the total spending during this time period. The potential health care savings and
out-of-pocket patient savings from substitution of the cheapest topical steroid within the
corresponding potency class were $944.8 million and $66.6 million, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most topical steroids prescribed were generic drugs. There
has been a sharp increase in Medicare and out-of-pocket spending on topical steroids that is
driven by higher costs for generics. Use of clinical decision support tools to enable
substitution of the most affordable generic topical steroid from the corresponding potency
class may reduce drug expenditures.

ising pharmaceutical costs in the United States are a
source of increasing financial burden for payers and pa-
tients. Increased pharmaceutical costs are often attrib-
uted to novel agents that require funding for development and
testing.1 Although generic drugs are usually cheaper, a para-
doxical phenomenon of increasingly prohibitive prices for
many older generic drugs has emerged in recent years.2
Costs associated with brand name and generic medica-
tions vary by payer, pharmacy, and state, which makes sys-
tematic analysis of national health care spending on any given
drug class challenging. A recent analysis of 26 selected brand-
name and generic dermatologic medications at 4 pharmacies
in Florida between 2009 and 2015 demonstrated mean price
increases of 401% and 279%, respectively.3,4 While the im-
pact of increased drug prices on system-wide dermatology and
patient expenditures has not been assessed, individual re-
ports suggest that the increased prices are formidable barri-
ers to medication adherence.4-6
Inthisstudy,weexaminedrugutilizationandcostsforboth
generic and branded topical steroids within Medicare Part D
from the perspective of the payer and patients and model the
potentialsavingsfromidentificationanddispensingand/orpre-
scribing the cheapest topical steroid within each potency class.
Our analysis is based on the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public
Use File, which was released by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services in December 2016 and details annual drug
utilization and spending on both generic and branded drugs
between 2011 and 2015.7
We chose to focus on topical steroids because they are
used to treat a broad range of dermatoses, are among the
most commonly prescribed agents in dermatology, and
often require a prescription, enabling us to capture drug uti-
lization and expenditures via a prescription insurance
database.8,9
Methods
Data Set
We evaluated population-based claims data from the Medi-
care Part D Prescriber Public Use File, which provides pre-
scription costs for approximately 70% of Medicare benefi-
ciaries with a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan
between 2011 and 2015.7 Information provided by the Medi-
care Part D Public Use File includes the brand name, generic
name, claim count (including refills), unit count (total dos-
age units in grams or milliliters), average cost per unit, ben-
eficiary count, average beneficiary cost share, total annual
spending per user, and total spending by Medicare. This
study was granted institutional review board exemption by
Partners Healthcare.
Topical Steroid Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We identified all generic and branded cream, ointment, and
lotion formulations of topical steroids. We excluded prescrip-
tions for topical steroids with proprietary or noninterchange-
able vehicles such as gels, foams, oils, body washes, and sham-
poos. We also excluded topical steroids that were combined
with other active ingredients or pharmaceutical agents, such
as combination topical steroid and antifungal agents. The da-
tabase included 1008 pharmaceutical agents commonly pre-
scribedbydermatologists,and2reviewers(A.A.andA.M.)nar-
rowed the list to 102 agents containing topical steroids. Two
reviewers (H.S. and A.M.) applied inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria, resulting in 32 total topical steroids included in the study
(eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Classification of Topical Steroids
All topical steroids were classified by potency classes I through
VII according to the US system.8 The Medicare Public Use File
data for topical steroids were aggregated across all dosages and
strengths, such that different strengths (eg, 0.25% vs 0.1%) of
the same compound could not be distinguished. We grouped
the topical steroids by potency into 5 main groups: class I, class
II, classes III and IV, classes V and VI, and class VII (eTable 1 in
the Supplement). When medications fell into multiple ste-
roid classes owing to different drug delivery vehicles and/or
prescription strengths, two reviewers (A.A. and A.M.) evalu-
ated all associated classes to categorize the medication into 1
of the 5 groups. One reviewer (A.M.) evaluated the topical ste-
roids within each of the 5 groups for interchangeability in clini-
cal practice.
Cost Calculations
We calculated Medicare spending based on total spending
data, and the potential health care system savings by mod-
eling the total savings if each beneficiary incurred the aver-
age annual cost for the cheapest topical steroid within the
same potency group. Total out-of-pocket patient spending
was determined by analyzing beneficiary counts and aver-
age beneficiary cost shares, which reflect the amount that
beneficiaries paid that was not reimbursed by a third party.
Potential annual out-of-pocket patient savings were esti-
mated by modeling the savings if all beneficiaries paid the
average beneficiary cost share for the cheapest topical ste-
roid within the potency group. All values were adjusted for
inflation rates and reported in 2015 dollars (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).10
Key Points
Question What are the trends, drivers, and potential modifiers of
Medicare spending on topical steroids?
Findings In this retrospective analysis of Medicare Part D claims
data between 2011 and 2015, Medicare spent $2.3 billion on
topical steroids; spending increased 226.5%, while prescriptions
increased 37.0%. If prescribers had written for the cheapest
topical steroid within the same potency class, Medicare could have
saved $944.8 million.
Meaning Medicare spending on topical steroids continues to rise,
largely owing to increased medication costs for generic drugs;
encouraging physicians to prescribe the cheapest topical steroids
within a given potency group may decrease health care
expenditures without compromising patient outcomes.

 Results
Economic Spending on Topical Steroids
A total of $2.3 billion (47.5 million prescriptions) was spent on
topical steroids between 2011 and 2015 (Figure 1). The total
annualspendingincreasedfrom$237.6million(7.7millionpre-
scriptions) to $775.9 million (10.6 million prescriptions), an in-
crease of 226.5%. Patients paid a total of $333.7 million out-
of-pocket for topical steroids between 2011 and 2015 (Figure 1).
Patients’ annual out-of-pocket spending increased from $41.4
million to $101.8 million, an increase of 145.9%. The annual
number of prescriptions increased 37.0%. Generics ac-
counted for 97.8% of the total spending between 2011 and 2015
(Figure2).CostsassociatedwithclassVIIsteroidshadtheslow-
est rate of growth (22.5%), while costs of class I steroids had
the highest (604.4%). Within class I steroids, the change in av-
erage user spending (605.3%) was highest for clobetasol pro-
pionate (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

tential out-of-pocket patient savings were $66.6 million, in-
creasing from $8.1 million in 2011 to $25.5 million by 2015.
Prescribing Patterns
The proportion of prescriptions written for the cheapest topi-
cal steroid within each corresponding potency group varied
by potency class and year (Table). Prescriptions for the cheap-
est topical steroid decreased from 78.5% to 10.5% for class I
steroids, and decreased from 57.6% to 30.7% for class II ste-
roids between 2011 and 2015. The prescriptions for the cheap-
est class V and VI steroids increased from 1.3% to 74.1%, once
a less used and cheaper alternative, Beta-Val (betamethasone
valerate),wasnolongerprescribed,andhydrocortisone,amore
commonly prescribed agent, became the cheapest alterna-
tive in 2014. There was less fluctuation in the prescriptions of
the most affordable agents in class III-IV (from 87.5% to 90.6%)
and class VII (from 96.8% to 99.5%).
Discussion
The total cost for topical steroids in the Medicare Part D pro-
gram between 2011 and 2015 was $2.3 billion. The percentage
increase in total Medicare and out-of-pocket patient spend-
ing was 226.5% (from $237.6 million to $775.9 million) and
145.9% (from $41.4 million to $101.8 million), respectively, de-
spite only a 37.0% increase (from 7.7 million to 10.6 million)

 in total prescriptions. The disproportionate increase in aggre-
gate drug spending compared with claims suggests that the in-
crease in spending is likely largely due to rising drug prices.
Bothpatientsandthehealthcaresystembearthefinancialbur-
den of these higher costs.
Our findings support and expand on the literature on
the impact of rising pharmaceutical costs for payers and
patients. Although increased spending is often attributed to
novel agents, our findings demonstrate that both Medicare
cost increases and spending on topical steroids are primarily
associated with generic pricing. The increase and variability
in pricing of generic topical steroids within any given
potency class challenge clinicians' ability to practice cost-
effective medicine.4 These findings are anathema to an
emerging culture focused on identifying and promoting
value in dermatologic care.3,4,11-13
The US Senate Special Committee on Aging recently re-
leased a report14 on Medicare Part D spending that delineates
how pharmaceutical companies have acquired previously af-
fordable, generic medications, and dramatically increased
prices. The rate of price increases of dermatologic agents out-
pacesthoseofinflationandnationalhealthcareexpenditure.3,4
Our study demonstrates the impact of increased pharmaceu-
tical costs of dermatologic agents at the national and patient
level. Pharmaceutical costs especially have an impact on the
care of elderly subscribers of Medicare, who are vulnerable to
cost-related medication nonadherence.15-17
While broad health-policy approaches to improve unpre-
dictabledrugmarketdynamicsareneeded,clinicianscanmod-
erate total health care spending within the current system. The
percentage of claims for the most affordable agent within class
I decreased from 78.5% to 10.5% between 2011 and 2015 as cli-
nicians continued to prescribe clobetasol propionate despite
its 6-fold increase in cost. The simple substitution of beta-
methasone dipropionate for all class I steroid prescriptions
would have led to Medicare savings of $295.6 million in 2015
alone. Some physicians may be indifferent to increasing drug
costs, but others may be unaware or have higher clinical in-
ertia. This data source could not identify characteristics of pre-
scribers, including prescriber specialty, but it is possible that
nondermatologistprescribersmayalsobelessfamiliarwiththe
interchangeability within topical steroid potency classes.
All clinicians, including dermatologists, could poten-
tially benefit from electronic medical record resources that
provide up-to-date information on the most affordable
agents.18 Active clinician support at the time of prescribing
would need to account for a variety of factors, including
market dynamics, geographical variation, and pharmaceuti-
cal coverage to determine the cheapest agent within a
desired steroid class, and prompt physicians to prescribe
this agent when they consider dispensing a more expensive
agent from the same class.
Limitations
Our results must be considered within the context of this study
design. This data set does not take drug manufacturer re-
bates into account, as the law prohibits disclosure of this in-
formation.Thepatientpopulationinthisstudymaynotbegen-
eralizable. Clinical practice patterns and spending figures may
bedifferentinothernon-Medicarepopulations.Physiciansmay
also prefer certain drugs within the same therapeutic class for
specific clinical reasons, although agents within the same po-
tency class are often interchangeable. Future studies are
needed to determine the generalizability of our findings and
to evaluate our proposals for reducing costs.
Despite these limitations, our analysis most likely under-
estimates the true cost of topical steroids in this patient popu-
lation. The data were limited to medications included in the
Part D program, and patients may obtain similar drugs through
supplemental coverage.7 It is also possible that patients paid
out-of-pocket for their prescriptions if cheaper than their co-
pay. While we focused on pharmaceutical costs, we could not
quantify clinician and/or payer administrative costs or patient-
related opportunity costs associated with switching prescrip-
tions owing to expense. Significant costs may also be associ-
ated with newer or combination formulations that were
excluded from this analysis.
Conclusions
There is tremendous health care spending on topical ste-
roids. It is imperative that health policies emerge that regu-
late pharmaceutical company practices and improve trans-
parencysurroundingdrugcosts.14Untilthattime,interventions
such as electronic medical record–based clinician support may
allow clinicians to prescribe the most affordable topical ste-
roids available on the market, ensuring efficacy while mini-
mizing costs. Without these efforts, routine medications may
become prohibitive in cost for our patients.
