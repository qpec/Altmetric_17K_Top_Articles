Abstract
Increasing knowledge concerning the biology of hematologic malignancies as well as the role of the immune system
in the control of these diseases has led to the development and approval of immunotherapies that are resulting in
impressive clinical responses. Therefore, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a hematologic
malignancy Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines panel consisting of physicians, nurses, patient advocates, and patients
to develop consensus recommendations for the clinical application of immunotherapy for patients with multiple
myeloma, lymphoma, and acute leukemia. These recommendations were developed following the previously
established process based on the Institute of Medicine’s clinical practice guidelines. In doing so, a systematic literature
search was performed for high-impact studies from 2004 to 2014 and was supplemented with further literature as
identified by the panel. The consensus panel met in December of 2014 with the goal to generate consensus
recommendations for the clinical use of immunotherapy in patients with hematologic malignancies. During this
meeting, consensus panel voting along with discussion were used to rate and review the strength of the supporting
evidence from the literature search. These consensus recommendations focus on issues related to patient selection,
toxicity management, clinical endpoints, and the sequencing or combination of therapies. Overall, immunotherapy is
rapidly emerging as an effective therapeutic strategy for the management of hematologic malignances. Evidence-
based consensus recommendations for its clinical application are provided and will be updated as the field evolves.

 Introduction
The incidence of hematologic malignancies has steadily
increased over the past 30 years. Over this period of
time, there have been significant advancements in the
understanding of the biology of these diseases, including
the important role that the immune system plays in their
development, maintenance, and eradication. As a result
of these discoveries, there has been concurrent advance-
ment in immunotherapies specifically developed for the
treatment of hematologic malignancies. Probably the
most remarkable example of the success of immunother-
apy for hematologic malignancies is the anti-CD20
monoclonal antibody rituximab, which has been incor-
porated into almost all aspects in the treatment of B cell
malignancies.
An understanding of the basic mechanisms of the im-
mune system as it relates to hematologic malignancies has
been increasing rapidly. This understanding has acceler-
ated the translation of this research and has led to the
development of several novel immunotherapeutic ap-
proaches. A major recent example is research related to
tumor immune evasion mechanisms. The programmed
cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway has emerged as a highly
relevant immune checkpoint pathway in a number of
hematologic malignancies, particularly Hodgkin’s lymph-
oma [1]. This work has led to the development of several
antibodies that disrupt the interactions between negative
regulatory receptors on tumor-specific T cells and their
ligands on tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells.
In response to the growing number of immunothera-
peutic agents that have been approved and are in final
stages of clinical investigation in the treatment of
hematologic malignances, SITC formed a hematologic
malignancy Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines panel to
provide guidance to practicing clinicians caring for
patients with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and acute
leukemia. SITC is a nonprofit professional organization
dedicated to the basic understanding and clinical applica-
tions of cancer immunotherapy. The panel consisted of
experts in hematologic malignancies, including physicians,
nurses, patient advocates, and patients (Additional file 1).
This panel met to consider issues related to patient selec-
tion, toxicity management, treatment cessation guidelines
and current recommendations for treatment sequencing
with the goal of preparing a consensus statement on clin-
ical use of immunotherapy for patients with hematologic
malignancies. The hematologic malignancy panel was
comprised of three separate disease-specific panels fo-
cused
on multiple
myeloma,
lymphoma,
and
acute
leukemia (Fig. 1). The consensus panels were charged to
provide evidence-based guidelines and recommendations
with a major emphasis on US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA)-approved agents. While the members of the
panel agreed that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) is an important and effective
therapeutic option in the management of hematologic
malignancies, it was not included in the current consensus
statement at the recommendation of the Steering Com-
mittee. Although the major emphasis of this report is to
provide summaries and recommendations relative to
approved agents, the panel felt it was also important to
addresses biological principles and treatment that would
be relevant to clinical oncologists in regard to the future
of immunotherapy research for hematologic malignancies.
Methods
Consensus statement development
This consensus statement was developed using the stan-
dards delineated by the SITC consensus statement on
tumor immunotherapy for the treatment of cutaneous
melanoma as described previously [2]. These standards
were originally developed based on the Institute of Medi-
cine’s Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical
Practice Guidelines, and include key components such as
establishing a transparent process for guideline develop-
ment and funding, managing and reporting conflicts of
interest, including a multidisciplinary and balanced panel,
establishing an evidence-based foundation and rating
system for the strength of the evidence, reporting the re-
sults through a publicly available website and publication,
and having a plan to update the recommendations [2, 3].
In December 2014, SITC convened a hematologic malig-
nancy Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines panel charged
with developing clinical practice guidelines for the use of
immunotherapy in multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and
acute leukemia. To do so, these Steering Committee-led
panels considered patient selection, toxicity management,
assessment of response, and sequencing as well as the
combination of therapies for immunotherapies in current
clinical practice. Due to differences in the regulation and
availability of immunotherapy agents world-wide, the
consensus panel focused on drugs currently approved by
the US FDA. These consensus guidelines are not intended
to be a substitute for the professional judgment of treating
physicians. The full consensus recommendations as well as
any future updates can be found on the SITC website [4].
Consensus panel and conflicts of interest
Potential consensus panel members including physicians,
nurses, patient advocates, and patients were solicited from
SITC members and non-members. Panel members were
screened using the SITC conflicts of interest disclosure
form. This form requires the disclosure of any financial as
well as non-financial conflicts of interests that may have
direct implications resulting from the publication of this
statement. In addition, no commercial funding was used
to support the consensus panel meeting, literature review,
or preparation of this manuscript.

 The hematologic malignancy panel, consisting of three
separate disease-specific panels for multiple myeloma,
lymphoma, and acute leukemia, met in December, 2014,
to review and discuss results from a previously distrib-
uted questionnaire collecting information on the panel
member’s role in patient care, primary clinical focus,
experience with FDA-approved agents, and current clin-
ical practices concerning the use of, or recommended
use of immunotherapy agents. The final version of this
consensus statement was made available to the entire
SITC membership for an open comment period. These
comments were collected and considered in the final
version of this manuscript (Additional file 2).
Literature review
The MEDLINE database was used to perform a system-
atic search of scientific literature from 2004 to 2014.
The search was limited to “humans” and “clinical trials
or controlled clinical trials or randomized controlled
clinical trials.” The results from the literature search are
listed according to each disease type as follows. These
bibliographies were supplemented with additional litera-
ture as identified by the panel.
Multiple myeloma
The search terms included “myeloma and lenalidomide,”
“myeloma and pomalidomide,” “myeloma and thalido-
mide,” “myeloma and monoclonal antibody,” “myeloma
and checkpoint blockade or PD-1 or PD-L1 or B7-H1,”
“myeloma and oncolytic virus,” “myeloma and virother-
apy,” and “myeloma and dendritic cell vaccine or idiotype
vaccine.” After duplicates and irrelevant citations were
removed, this search resulted in a 173-item bibliography
(Additional file 3: Bibliography I).
Lymphoma
The search terms included “lymphoma and rituximab or
ofatumumab,”
“lymphoma
and
checkpoint
blockade,”
“lymphoma and chimeric antigen receptor,” “lymphoma
and idiotype vaccine,” “lymphoma and denileukin diftitox,”
“lymphoma and interferon alfa-2b,” “mantle cell lymphoma
and lenalidomide,” and “mantle cell lymphoma and borte-
zomib.” After duplicates and irrelevant citations were
removed, this search resulted in a 138-item bibliography
(Additional file 3: Bibliography II).
Acute leukemia
The search terms included “AML and epigenetic therapy,”
“AML and hypomethylating agents or 5-azacytidine or
decitabine,” “AML and monoclonal antibody,” “ALL and
monoclonal antibody or rituximab or blinatumomab,”
“AML and checkpoint blockade,” “AML and CAR or
CART,” and “ALL and CAR or CART.” After dupli-
cates
and
irrelevant
citations
were
removed,
this
search resulted in a 56-item bibliography (Additional
file 3: Bibliography III).
The literature was reviewed and graded according to
the previously established rating system [2]. In summary,
Level A was defined as strong supporting evidence-
based data from prospective, randomized clinical trials,
and meta-analyses; Level B was defined as moderate
supporting data from uncontrolled, prospective clinical
trials; and Level C represented weak supporting data
from retrospective reviews and case reports.

 Multiple myeloma
Immune-based therapies in multiple myeloma (MM) can
be classified as current or emerging therapies, based
largely on the level of clinical evidence. The panel there-
fore first considered the status of current therapies,
followed by considerations for the current status and
optimal evaluation of emerging therapies.
Current immunotherapies in myeloma
Two broad categories of current immune/immune-
modulating therapies in MM are immune-modulating
drugs (IMiDs) and anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs). Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide
are already FDA-approved for use in MM [5, 6]. While
non-immune effects of IMiDs are recognized, the mye-
loma panel voted to include these agents among the list
of immune therapies for these guidelines. Although anti-
tumor antibodies were not yet FDA-approved at the
time of the panel review, the level of evidence support-
ing the clinical activity of some agents (anti-CD38 mAb
(daratumumab) and anti-SLAMF7 mAb (elotuzumab))
was felt to be high, and therefore, they were included
among current immune therapies [7, 8]. Both elotuzu-
mab and daratumumab recently received FDA approval
for relapsed myeloma.
IMiDs: thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide
Over the past 15 years, the use of IMiDs together with
proteasome inhibitors has transformed the therapeutic
landscape and outcome of patients with MM. Lenalido-
mide plus dexamethasone (Rd) was superior to dexa-
methasone alone in two phase III trials involving
patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) [9, 10].
Rd was also superior to dexamethasone in the setting of
induction therapy [11]. Use of a lower dose of dexa-
methasone led to an improved safety profile, and accord-
ingly, Rd has been commonly adopted in the US [12]. In
a clinical trial involving elderly patients with previously
untreated MM, continuous Rd was superior to fixed
duration
Rd
and
to
melphalan,
prednisolone,
and
thalidomide (MPT) [13].
The Rd regimen has also been combined with sev-
eral agents, most notably proteasome inhibitors. Data
comparing the addition of carfilzomib to Rd (KRd) in
RRMM demonstrated improved progression-free sur-
vival (PFS) [14]. In a phase III trial, the addition of
elotuzumab to Rd led to improved PFS in patients
with RRMM [15]. Recently, the addition of ixazomib
to the Rd backbone also led to improved PFS in
RRMM [16]. It should be noted that these phase III
studies were performed in patients with lenalidomide-
sensitive disease, though differences in patient popula-
tions preclude across study comparisons.
In the front-line setting, results from trials comparing
Rd to triplets such as those in combination with borte-
zomib (VRd), carfilzomib, and elotuzumab are currently
awaited. Initial data from SWOG 0777 have demon-
strated superiority of VRd over Rd in front-line therapy
of myeloma [17]. Data from randomized clinical trials
evaluating the timing of stem cell transplantation in the
era of novel agents is also awaited. Initial data from a
phase III trial demonstrated improvement in PFS in
patients receiving early stem cell transplantation [18].
Lenalidomide has also been utilized in the setting of
maintenance therapy following autologous HSCT as
demonstrated in clinical trials Cancer and Leukemia
Group B (CALGB) 100104 and IFM 2005–02 or as
continuous therapy for transplant ineligible patients
(MM-015) [19–21]. All three trials reported significant
differences in PFS, and the CALGB trial reported im-
proved 3 year overall survival (OS).
Pomalidomide plus dexamethasone demonstrated re-
markable activity in patients with RRMM refractory to
lenalidomide, and was the last immunotherapy agent
approved for therapy of MM [22–24]. Two dosing
schedules (2 mg daily or 4 mg on 21/28 day schedule) of
pomalidomide (in combination with dexamethasone)
have been explored with comparable results [25–27].
Pomalidomide is also active in patients with high-risk
cytogenetics such as deletion 17 [28].
In recent years, the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon has
been identified as a key target of IMiDs [29, 30]. Binding
of the drug to cereblon leads to degradation of Ikaros
family zinc finger proteins IKZF1 and IKZF3, which then
leads to inhibition of tumor cell growth and immune
activation [31–33]. In preclinical and early clinical stud-
ies, immune activation by IMiDs provides the basis for
synergy in combination with vaccines, antibodies and
checkpoint inhibitors [34–37]. IMiD therapy leads to
activation of both T and natural killer (NK) cells in vivo
[27, 38, 39]. IMiD-mediated immune activation is rapid
and correlates with clinical response to therapy [27].
Myeloma Panel Recommendations:
� The panel recommends the use of combination
therapies with lenalidomide in both front-line and
relapsed MM setting based on level A evidence.
Data directly comparing regimens commonly
utilized in front-line setting is awaited and
enrollment in well-designed clinical trials is
recommended. In a recent Southwestern
Oncology Group (SWOG) study, combination
therapy with VRd led to improved outcome
compared to Rd [17].
� The front-line regimen for transplant-eligible
patients (outside of a clinical trial) preferred by the
majority (53.3%) of the panel was VRd, followed by
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 4 of 25
 Rd (26.7%) and cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and
dexamethasone (CyBorD) (13.3%) based on level B
evidence.
� The front-line regimen for transplant-ineligible
patients (outside of a clinical trial) preferred by the
panel were Rd (46.6%), VRd (40%), followed by
CyBorD (6.7%) based on level B evidence.
� Based on the results of SWOG S0777 (not available
at the time of the panel review), VRd is now
expected to become the preferred front-line regimen
for most patients with newly diagnosed MM based
on level A evidence. Participation in ongoing clinical
trials comparing this regimen with others is strongly
encouraged.
� All panelists recommend the use of a proteasome
inhibitor-based regimen in patients with t(4:14), del17p,
and plasma cell leukemia based on level B evidence.
� The panel recognizes the lack of level A evidence
regarding the timing of stem cell transplant in the
era of novel agents. While the results of studies
addressing these questions are awaited, most
panelists (66.7%) favor consideration of early
autologous HSCT. The outcome of the French
cohort Intergroupe Francophone Du Myeloma trial
has been recently presented and demonstrated
improved PFS with early transplant. These data were
not available at the time of the panel review [18].
� The majority of the panel (80%) recommends the
use of maintenance therapy following autologous
HSCT based on level A evidence. The preferred
duration of maintenance therapy is until progression
(50% of panelists) or for 2 years (28.6% of panelists).
Patients on lenalidomide maintenance after prior
melphalan exposure should also be monitored for
secondary malignancies.
� Preclinical and clinical data support the design of
clinical studies combining IMiDs with several
immune therapies including monoclonal antibodies,
vaccines, and immune checkpoint inhibitors based
on level B evidence.
� Nearly all of the clinical data with IMiDs is in
combination with concurrent steroids, including
that in the setting of current combinations with
monoclonal antibodies. Although steroids have the
potential to dampen immune activation, recent data
suggests that IMiDs may be able to activate immunity
even in the setting of concurrent steroids [27, 40].
The impact of concurrent steroids on IMiD-based
immune therapies was debated, and the panel agreed
that minimizing (or eventually eliminating) steroids
would be highly desirable. However, there is a lack of
consensus and currently no data to support the need
to eliminate steroids, particularly in light of their
synergistic direct anti-tumor effects.
Anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies
In recent years, several anti-tumor mAbs have entered
clinical testing in MM. Of these, elotuzumab and daratu-
mumab have entered phase III testing. Elotuzumab is a
fully humanized mAb against the glycoprotein SLAMF-7
expressed on myeloma and NK cells [41]. In preclinical
models, elotuzumab illustrated anti-tumor effects via NK
activation and enhanced antibody-dependent cytotoxicity
[41]. In a phase II trial, elotuzumab plus Rd (Elo-Rd)
achieved a 92% objective response rate (ORR) in patients
with RRMM [42]. In a recent phase III trial, Elo-Rd led to
an improvement in PFS compared to Rd in patients with
RRMM, including those with high-risk features [15]. In
this study, median PFS was 19.4 months in the Elo-Rd
group vs. 14.9 months in the Rd group alone, with a
hazard ration of .70 (95% CI: .57-.85, P < .001).
Daratumumab targets CD38 expressed on MM cells as
well as hematopoietic progenitor cells, endothelial cells,
and activated immune cells [43]. Anti-myeloma effects
of daratumumab involve several mechanisms including
direct as well as immune-mediated effects [44]. Prelim-
inary studies with daratumumab showed promising sin-
gle agent activity with 31% objective responses in heavily
pretreated RRMM, including those refractory to both
proteasome inhibitors and IMiDs [45]. These results
were confirmed in a phase I-II study, illustrating a 36%
response rate and median PFS of 5.6 months in heavily
pretreated RRMM patients who received daratumumab
monotherapy (16 mg/kg) [46]. In addition, in a phase
II, multicenter trial daratumumab showed a 29.2% re-
sponse rate and median PFS of 3.7 months in MMRR
patients who had received a median of 5 previous lines
of therapy [47]. Moreover, the addition of daratumu-
mab to the Rd backbone led to an improved ORR of
75% in RRMM. Daratumumab has also been combined
with pomalidomide in therapy of patients with RRMM
[48]. Similar results have been observed with another
anti-CD38 mAb, SAR650984 (isatuximab) in patients
with RRMM.
Two antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are in active
clinical
testing
in
RRMM.
Indatuximab
ravtansine
(BT062) is comprised of an anti-CD138 mAb conju-
gated to the maytansinoid DM4 toxin. In a phase II
trial, indatuximab ravtansine plus Rd led to a 78%
ORR
in
patients
with
RRMM.
J6MO-mcMMAF
(GSK2857916) is an ADC targeting B cell maturation
antigen currently in phase I testing in RRMM. In
addition, mAbs targeting several other molecules (e.g.,
CD40, CD56, CD54) are also in preclinical/early clin-
ical testing. mAbs may be of particular interest in
populations at higher risk with current therapies, in-
cluding
those
with
genetic
high
risk
disease
and
comorbidities such as renal failure.
Myeloma Panel Recommendations:
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 5 of 25
 � mAbs targeting SLAMF-7 (elotuzumab) or CD38
(daratumumab and SAR650984) in combination
with Rd or VRd have demonstrated promising
clinical activity in RRMM, including those with
high-risk disease. Eligible patients with RRMM or
NDMM and particularly those with high-risk
features should be encouraged to participate in
ongoing clinical trials with these agents based on
level B evidence. After the panel meeting, on
November 16, 2015, daratumumab received
approval to treat patients with relapsed MM who
have received at least three prior lines of therapy or
are refractory to both a proteasome inhibitor and an
IMiD. On November 30, 2015, the FDA approved
elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and
dexamethasone for therapy of relapsed MM who
have received one to three prior medications.
� IMiDs often show synergy with mAbs likely in part
related to their effects on antibody-dependent cell
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and are emerging as
important agents for combination with mAbs,
although proteasome inhibitors are also being
combined with monoclonal antibodies.
Emerging immunotherapies in myeloma
For the evaluation of emerging therapies, the panel con-
sidered both early phase clinical as well as key preclinical
findings from the literature in its recommendations. It is
recognized that this is an area of active ongoing preclinical
and clinical investigation with several new approaches
showing promise. Therefore, periodic updates to these
recommendations are strongly recommended.
Immune checkpoint blockade
Several studies have shown that PD-L1 is commonly
overexpressed by myeloma tumor cells [49]. In preclin-
ical models, targeting PD-L1 led to anti-tumor effects in
murine myeloma [50]. Blockade of the PD-L1 axis leads
to activation of antigen-specific T and NK cells in
culture [36, 51, 52]. Expression of PD-L1 in MM tumor
cells is enriched in minimal residual disease and correlates
with risk of progression from monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) to MM [53, 54]. In
phase II clinical studies with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivo-
lumab, stable disease (but no objective regressions) were
observed in RRMM patients [55]. The impact of targeting
this axis on survival of MM patients is currently unknown.
Early data combining anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab
with IMiDs (lenalidomide and pomalidomide) have been
reported and suggest promising clinical activity. Limited
single agent activity with PD-1 blockade in early myeloma
studies suggests the need to consider combination with
other agents or approaches that stimulate and expand
tumor specific lymphocytes [56, 57].
Myeloma Panel Recommendations:
� There was a consensus among the panel for a strong
preclinical rationale for consideration of clinical
trials of immune-checkpoint blockade in myeloma.
� The panel identified the following top clinical settings
for evaluation of immune checkpoint blockade as
single agents: high-risk MM, post-autologous HSCT,
and minimal residual disease (MRD).
� The panel identified the following top clinical
settings for evaluation of immune checkpoint-based
combination therapies: relapsed MM, high-risk MM,
and post-autologous HSCT.
� The panel identified the following as the top three
agents for combination with immune checkpoint
blockade in clinical trials: lenalidomide/IMiDs,
vaccine, and other immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Update added after the panel meeting: initial reports
of studies testing combination of IMiDs and immune
checkpoint blockade have shown promising clinical
activity. Tumor-directed mAbs are also attractive
agents for combination with immune checkpoint
blockade. Thus, participation in phase II/III trials
testing these combinations is strongly encouraged.
Immune activating antibodies
There are preclinical data to support targeting co-
stimulation
via
activating
antibodies
in
MM.
One
example is targeting CD137, which leads to antitumor
effects in mouse models [58, 59]. Targeting CD137 has
also been shown to synergize with anti-tumor antibodies
in preclinical models [60–62].
Myeloma Panel Recommendations:
� There is preclinical rationale to consider clinical
evaluation of immune activating antibodies in MM.
� The panel identified the following top clinical
settings for evaluation of immune activating
antibodies as single agents: relapsed MM, MRD, and
post-autologous HSCT.
� The panel identified the following top clinical
settings for evaluation of immune activating
antibody-based combination therapies: high-risk
MM, MRD, and post-autologous HSCT.
� The panel identified the following as the top agents
for combination with immune-activating antibodies
in clinical trials: lenalidomide/IMiDs and vaccines.
With the emergence of anti-tumor antibodies,
there is interest in combining these with immune
activating antibodies as well.
Vaccines
Vaccines against tumor-specific antigens represent an at-
tractive strategy to boost tumor immunity and may be
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 6 of 25
 particularly relevant with the emergence of checkpoint
blockade strategies. Most of the early vaccine studies in
MM targeted idiotypic determinants on clonal immuno-
globulin (Ig) [63–65]. Ongoing vaccine studies are
targeting peptides derived from defined antigens, in
combination with lenalidomide and with anti-PD-1 [66].
Several vaccine approaches are in early phase testing.
The PVX-410 vaccine consists of a cocktail of HLA-A2
derived peptides from X-box binding protein1 (XBP-1),
CD138, and SLAM-F7 antigens that can trigger activa-
tion of MM-specific T cells and is currently under evalu-
ation in combination with lenalidomide and anti-PD-1
(NCT01718899). One particular approach to boost im-
munity to multiple tumor-associated antigens involves
fusion of tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs) [67–69].
In a phase II trial, MM-DC vaccination following autolo-
gous HSCT led to a 78% very good partial response
(VGPR) rate, and a 47% complete response (CR)/near
complete response (nCR) rate, with responses improving
from PR to CR/nCR after 100 days in 24% of patients
[70]. This approach is now being tested in a randomized
multicenter clinical trial. DC vaccines targeting innate
lymphocytes such as NKT cells in combination with
low-dose lenalidomide also led to tumor regression in
asymptomatic MM in a small clinical trial [71]. Another
approach has been to use an allogeneic myeloma vac-
cine in combination with a GM-CSF secreting cell line
(myeloma GVAX) [72]. When administered in combin-
ation with lenalidomide in patients in a near complete
remission (with a detectable immunofixation of their
monoclonal protein), patients have shown evidence of
priming and persistence of a tumor-specific immune re-
sponse that correlated with an ongoing disease remission
[73]. These data have led to a randomized trial comparing
lenalidomide maintenance to lenalidomide + GVAX.
Myeloma Panel Recommendations:
� Vaccines represent an attractive strategy to boost
tumor-specific immunity, particularly in the setting
of early phase or MRD [70, 71, 74].
� The panel identified MRD and high-risk asymptom-
atic MM as the top clinical settings for clinical
evaluation of vaccine strategies.
� Clinical evaluation of vaccines is strongly
recommended in combination with approaches that
modify the immune suppressive factors in the tumor
microenvironment. The panel identified
lenalidomide and immune checkpoint blockade as
the top strategies for combination with vaccines.
Adoptive cellular therapies, including chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T cells
Adoptive transfer of activated tumor-infiltrating T cells
led to tumor regression in patients with melanoma. In a
similar fashion, marrow infiltrating T cells have been
infused following ex vivo activation in MM patients fol-
lowing autologous HSCT. In a recent study with 25
patients treated using this approach, the presence of
central memory a CD8+ T cell phenotype at baseline
and persistence of myeloma-specific T cells at 1 year
post adoptive T cell therapy was predictive of improved
outcome [75, 76]. One strategy involved combining
vaccination against tumor antigens with adoptive trans-
fer of anti-CD3-stimulated and vaccine-primed T cells
following autologous HSCT in patients with RRMM
[77–79]. Antigens targeted via this approach included h-
TERT and survivin in one study and MAGE in another
study [77, 78]. The combination approach led to en-
hanced reconstitution of cellular and humoral immunity
post-ASCT, including tumor-specific T cells.
CAR T cells against CD19 have shown remarkable clin-
ical activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [80].
CART-19 cells are currently being evaluated in the setting
of MM following autologous HSCT, based on the premise
that a subset of drug resistant and possibly clonogenic
subset of tumor cells express CD19 [81] and have shown
early signs of activity [81]. Another antigen being targeted
in early phase clinical trials by this approach is B cell mat-
uration antigen [82], and NY-ESO-1 has been targeted
with TCR-engineered T-cells [83]. Other approaches test-
ing CAR-modified T or NK cells are targeting diverse
antigens such as kappa light chain, NKG2D, CD38 and
SLAMF-7. In addition to cell-based therapies, virotherapy
approaches such as measles virus have also been evaluated
in patients with RRMM and impressive clinical responses
have been observed in some patients with this approach
[84]. Virus-induced death of tumor cells is thought to acti-
vate anti-tumor immunity, which sets the stage for
combination approaches [85].
Myeloma Panel Recommendations:
� Adoptive transfer of costimulated/vaccine-primed T
cells as well as marrow infiltrating T cells is a
promising strategy for immunotherapy of MM.
� Several CAR-modified T/NK cell approaches are
also being developed and in preclinical/early phase
testing.
� Virotherapy approaches such as measles virus have
led to impressive clinical responses in some patients
with RRMM.
� The panel identified patients with high-risk MM or
RRMM as well as post-autologous HSCT as pre-
ferred clinical settings for clinical evaluation of
adoptive cellular therapies.
� The panel also identified combination approaches
with lenalidomide and immune checkpoint blockade
as preferred combination approaches with these
strategies.

 Issues related to immunotherapy research in myeloma
Emergence of effective immune therapies in cancer has
led to a reassessment of trial designs and endpoints for
evaluating clinical efficacy of such therapies, particularly
in the setting of some solid tumors. Traditional criteria
such as response rates and PFS did not correlate with
OS or clinical benefit for some immune therapies in the
setting of solid tumors. Novel immune related response
criteria have been proposed in the setting of some solid
tumors [86].
Prior preclinical studies have shown that tumor-specific
T cells are enriched in the bone marrow in preneoplastic
gammopathy and even in the setting of clinical MM, T
cells from the bone marrow can be activated to kill autolo-
gous tumor cells [76, 87, 88]. Antigen-specific T cells have
been detected in both blood and bone marrow of mye-
loma patients [89, 90]. The phenotypic and functional pro-
file of immune cells in the bone marrow differs from that
in circulation, such as with accumulation of IL17-
producing T cells [91–94]. MM patients may have signifi-
cant immune paresis in terms of both humoral and cellu-
lar immunity, which may also be impacted by prior
therapies [95]. Detection of MRD is emerging as an im-
portant parameter and further research is needed to fully
integrate MRD testing in the management of myeloma.
Myeloma Panel Recommendations:
� The panel strongly recommends incorporation of
detailed immune monitoring in ongoing clinical trials
of immune therapies including IMiDs, mAbs and other
emerging immune therapies based on level A evidence.
� The panel recommends that immune monitoring
should include serial analysis of the bone marrow
microenvironment in all studies, as this may differ
from the findings in circulating immune cells based
on level A evidence.
� Immune monitoring should include both phenotypic
and also functional studies including analyses of
antigen-specific T cell responses. Guidelines for
optimal monitoring of tissue-based immune
responses, including those in the bone marrow
are currently under development through SITC.
Collection, initial processing, transport and
storage of tissue aspirates or biopsies may have an
impact on results of immune monitoring approaches,
and these details should be included in the clinical
protocols as well as publication of results.
� Timing of immune monitoring may depend on the
nature of the specific therapy. For example, mid-cycle
measurements may be needed to fully evaluate the
effect of IMiDs [71].
� The nature of preexisting immune paresis may
impact the response to immune therapies and
should be considered in trial design [95].
� The panel concluded that there are insufficient data
to evaluate whether current criteria for clinical
response/progression are inadequate for the
evaluation of response to immune therapies and
whether immune related response criteria as in the
setting of solid tumors will be useful in MM.
Nonetheless, repeat tumor biopsies should be
strongly considered to confirm disease progression
and avoid the potential caveat of pseudoprogression
due to a transient increase in M protein or the
possibility that progression by imaging may reflect
immune infiltration as opposed to true progression.
� The panel concluded that there were insufficient
data at present to recommend a change in preferred
endpoints for MM clinical trials in immunotherapy.
However, the panel did note that PFS has not been a
consistent or reliable predictor of eventual
improvement in OS following immune therapies in
solid tumors. It is possible that PFS at a defined time-
point (e.g., 2 or 3 years) may be a better correlate of
clinical benefit with immune therapies, but this has
not been validated.
Lymphoma
The overall goal of the lymphoma consensus panel was to
provide guidance on the use of immunotherapeutics to
practicing physicians caring for patients with lymphoma.
The specific goal was to provide evidence-based guidelines
and recommendations with a major emphasis on FDA-
approved agents. In addition, the panel was charged to
provide consensus opinions relative to: 1) defining optimal
selection of lymphoma patients for immunotherapy; 2)
improving management of immunotherapy side effects; 3)
how best to monitor responses to immunotherapy; and 4)
developing a rationale for sequencing (or combining) im-
munotherapy with other agents for patients with high-risk
and advanced disease.
Definition of an immunotherapeutic agent
For the purpose of their review, the panel initially ad-
dressed how to define whether an agent or therapy was
a form of immunotherapy. In the broad sense, several
therapeutic agents may have effects upon the immune
system, but it may not be their major mechanism of
action in the treatment of lymphoma. It was the consen-
sus opinion that the major mechanism of action of a
lymphoma immunotherapeutic agent was augmenting
anti-tumor responses of immune cells. For example, if
an agent directly inhibits tumor escape mechanisms, it
would be classified as immunotherapy. In contrast,
agents that target a tumor cell directly and mediate cell
death mostly through non-immunological pathways (e.g.,
targeted agents to B cell receptor) were not considered
immunotherapeutics. Based on this definition, the list of
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 8 of 25
 FDA-approved agents which the panel did not consider
as a “true” form of immunotherapy for lymphoma in-
cluded
bortezomib,
denileukin diftitox,
brentuximab
vedotin, temsirolimus and the radio-immunoconjugates
Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan as well as tositumomab and
iodine I-131 tositumomab.
It was thoroughly recognized by the lymphoma panel
that allogeneic HSCT is an important and efficacious
form of immunotherapy in the treatment of lymphoma
[96]. However, it was the recommendation of the steer-
ing committee overseeing the hematologic malignancies
panels to not include this topic in the first set of guide-
lines. It is the intent to review in a future update how to
incorporate new immunotherapies into both allogeneic
and autologous HSCT and how these agents may chal-
lenge standard uses of allogeneic transplant.
Current immunotherapies in lymphoma
Monoclonal antibodies
Rituximab
Rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 mAb and is the most
commonly used and most clearly defined immunotherapy
in lymphoma. Rituximab is FDA-approved for the treat-
ment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Specifically, rituximab is
indicated for the treatment of NHL patients with: 1) re-
lapsed or
refractory,
low-grade
or
follicular,
CD20-
positive, B cell NHL as a single agent; 2) previously
untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B cell NHL in combin-
ation with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone
(CVP) chemotherapy; 3) non-progressing (including stable
disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B cell NHL, as a single
agent, after first-line CVP chemotherapy; and 4) previ-
ously untreated diffuse large B cell, CD20-positive NHL in
combination with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincris-
tine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based
chemotherapy regimens. Rituximab is also indicated, in
combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, for
the treatment of patients with previously untreated and
previously treated CD20-positive CLL. Although it is well
recognized that rituximab may have several mechanisms
of action, the primary effect is on normal anti-tumor im-
mune response [97]. It has been demonstrated that the
Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on
lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector
functions to mediate B cell lysis. Mechanisms of action
include
direct
anti-proliferative
effects,
complement-
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and ADCC, with the latter
believed to be dominant in vivo [98].
Lymphoma Panel Recommendations:
� Rituximab is FDA-approved as maintenance therapy
for previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive B
cell NHL and in non-progressing, low-grade, CD20-
positive, B cell NHL after first-line CVP chemotherapy.
However, the clinical benefit of maintenance rituximab
in these two clinical settings remains controversial,
based on endpoints that fail to clearly demonstrate a
survival benefit. It was the consensus opinion based on
level B evidence that maintenance rituximab is not rec-
ommended in low burden (as generally defined
Groupe D’Etude de Lymphomes Folliculaires),
low-grade NHL, and patients should be carefully
counseled relative to clinical benefits based on
specific endpoints [99, 100].
� Maintenance rituximab is not recommended in
diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) based on
level A evidence.
� The panel further emphasized there are several
unresolved issues with endpoints used to assess the
clinical utility of maintenance rituximab, as selected
endpoints may have differing relevance in different
histologies (e.g., mantle cell lymphoma). Future
trials addressing the role of maintenance rituximab
should clearly define and emphasize endpoints based
on histology.
� The panel could not make any recommendations
relative to dose, frequency, and duration of
rituximab as maintenance therapy.
Ofatumumab
Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 antibody that
is FDA-approved in combination with chlorambucil, for
the treatment of previously untreated patients with CLL
for whom fludarabine-based therapy is considered in-
appropriate. The approval was based on the results of a
multicenter randomized open-label trial that demon-
strated improved PFS with ofatumumab in combination
with chlorambucil as compared to single-agent chloram-
bucil [101].
Lymphoma Panel Recommendations:
� The panel had no specific recommendation for
ofatumumab as the results were not viewed as
providing any significant clinical advantages over
rituximab. Ofatumumab is currently approved in
combination with chlorambucil for front-line
therapy of CLL.
Obinutuzumab
Obinutuzumab is a humanized, glyco-engineered type 2,
anti-CD20 antibody that is FDA-approved for use in
combination with chlorambucil for the treatment of
patients with previously untreated CLL. The approval
was based on demonstration of an improvement in PFS
in a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial comparing
obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil to
chlorambucil alone in patients with previously untreated
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 9 of 25
 CD20-positive CLL. The study also included a rituximab
in combination with chlorambucil arm [102].
Lymphoma Panel Recommendations:
� The panel had no specific recommendation for
obinutuzumab for lymphoma as the results in this
disease, as opposed to CLL, were not viewed as
providing any significant clinical advantages over
rituximab.
Alemtuzumab
Alemtuzumab is a recombinant DNA-derived human-
ized IgG1 kappa anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody indi-
cated as a single agent for the treatment of B cell CLL.
Alemtuzumab was initially FDA-approved in 2001 under
accelerated approval and subsequently to regular ap-
proval based on an international, multicenter trial in 297
previously untreated CLL patients randomized to either
alemtuzumab or chlorambucil [103]. The PFS was sig-
nificantly longer in the alemtuzumab arm; no differences
in survival were observed.
Lymphoma Panel Recommendations:
� Alemtuzumab significantly impairs most important
immunologic effectors and potentially impairs the
utility of other immunotherapeutics.
� CD52 is expressed by approximately half of all
peripheral T cell lymphomas, and alemtuzumab has
been used alone and in combination with
conventional chemotherapy in their treatment.
However, as with CLL, there is significant concern
over toxicity and immunosuppression.
Other lymphoma immunotherapies
Lenalidomide
Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, is an immuno-
modulatory agent with antiangiogenic and antineoplastic
properties. Lenalidomide is FDA-approved for the treat-
ment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that has relapsed
or progressed after two prior therapies, one of which
included bortezomib. The approval of lenalidomide for
MCL was based on a multicenter, single-arm, open-label
trial of single-agent lenalidomide in 134 patients whose
MCL had relapsed after or were refractory to bortezo-
mib or a bortezomib-containing regimen [104]. Treat-
ment with lenalidomide resulted in an ORR of 26%; the
median duration of response was 16.6 months. The
combination of lenalidomide plus rituximab (LR) has
been investigated as initial therapy in MCL [105]. In a
single-group, multicenter, phase 2 study, 38 patients with
untreated MCL received lenalidomide (20 mg/day x 21
days of a 28-day cycle) as induction therapy for 12
cycles. Rituximab was administered once weekly for the
first 4 weeks and then once every other cycle until
disease progression. The most common grade 3 or 4
adverse events were neutropenia (50%), rash (29%),
thrombocytopenia (13%), an inflammatory syndrome (
11%), anemia (in 11%), serum sickness (in 8%), and
fatigue (in 8%). At the median follow-up of 30 months,
the overall response rate in evaluable patients was 92%,
and the CR rate was 64%. Median PFS had not been
reached at the time of this report. The 2-year PFS and
OS were estimated to be 85% and 97%, respectively. A
response to treatment was associated with improvement
in quality of life [105].
In a multicenter phase II/III study, DLBCL patients
were stratified by germinal center B cell-like (GCB)
versus non-GCB subtype, then randomized 1:1 to re-
ceive lenalidomide or investigator’s choice (IC) chemo-
therapy until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
or voluntary withdrawal [106]. Patients with GCB or non-
GCB DLBCL treated with lenalidomide had similar ORR,
but the data suggested greater improvements in PFS and
OS with lenalidomide versus IC in the non-GCB patients,
particularly the ABC subtype. In the Alliance phase II trial,
patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) were ran-
domized to rituximab alone or lenalidomide alone or LR
[107]. The rituximab-alone arm was discontinued as a
result of poor accrual. The ORR was 53% (CR = 20%) and
76% (CR = 39%) for lenalidomide alone and LR, respect-
ively (P = 0.029). Patients were treated until time of
progression. At the median follow-up of 2.5 years, median
time to progression was 1.1 years for lenalidomide alone
and 2 years for LR (P = 0.0023).
Lymphoma Panel Recommendations:
� It was the consensus opinion that lenalidomide as a
single agent has clinical activity in relapsed MCL
and that LR was an option as initial therapy in
untreated MCL based on level B evidence.
� It was the consensus opinion that lenalidomide has
clinical activity in DLBCL based on level B evidence.
� The lenalidomide dose of 25 mg used in DLBCL is
higher than clinicians are accustomed to using in
CLL; however, the risk of toxicity and clots/
thrombosis is decreased for lymphoma patients.
For patients without standard risk factors for deep
vein thrombosis, the panel suggested giving
low-dose aspirin.
� The panel felt that clinical endpoints were needed to
better define the duration of therapy for LR in FL.
Interferon (IFN)-α-2b
IFN-α-2b belongs to family of interferons, which are
naturally occurring small proteins and glycoproteins
produced and secreted by cells in response to viral infec-
tions and to synthetic or biological inducers. Interferons
exert their effects through a complex sequence of
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 10 of 25
 intracellular events including the induction of certain
enzymes, suppression of cell proliferation, and augmen-
tation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for
target cells [108]. IFN-α-2b is FDA-approved for the ini-
tial treatment of clinically aggressive follicular NHL in
conjunction with anthracycline-containing combination
chemotherapy in patients 18 years of age or older. This
approval was based on a randomized, controlled trial
that evaluated the safety and efficacy of IFN-α-2b in
conjunction with a combination of cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, and teniposide (CHVP) as initial treatment
in patients with clinically aggressive, large tumor burden,
stage III/IV follicular NHL [109]. Patients were random-
ized to CHVP alone or CHVP plus IFN-α-2b at 5 million
IU subcutaneously three times weekly for the duration
of 18 months. The group receiving the combination of
IFN-α-2b plus CHVP had a significantly longer PFS (2.9
years versus 1.5 years, P = 0.0001). After a median
follow-up of 6.1 years, the median survival for patients
treated with CHVP alone was 5.5 years while median
survival for patients treated with CHVP plus IFN-α-2b
had not been reached (P = 0.004). IFN-α also has docu-
mented single agent activity against multiple subtypes of
relapsed NHL [110–112]. Direct injection of IFN-α into
lymphoma lesions can often lead to their regression, sug-
gesting that efficient delivery of IFN-α to tumors might be
a useful approach to treating lymphomas [113, 114]. To
enable delivery of IFN-α to lymphoma cells, with anti-
CD20 antibody-IFN-α fusion proteins have been devel-
oped which show potent anti-lymphoma effects in pre-
clinical models [115, 116].
Recent evidence has also indicated that spontaneous ac-
tivation of the stimulator of IFN genes (STING) pathway
within tumor-resident DCs leads to type I IFN production
and adaptive immune responses against tumors [117].
Lymphoma Panel Recommendations:
� The panel commented that IFN-α-2b is currently
not commonly used in the treatment of NHL, and
its indication came prior to the introduction of
rituximab. As such, its use should follow label
indications strictly or in the context of a clinical
trial. However, other novel means of targeting
IFN-α activities to tumor sites to treat lymphomas
and other cancers are important areas of
investigation.
Emerging immunotherapies in lymphoma
There have been recent reports of several forms of im-
munotherapy under clinical investigation for the treatment
of lymphoma that have demonstrated clinical efficacy. As
many of these treatments are likely to receive FDA
approval in the coming years, the panel unanimously
agreed that a brief overview of these modalities and clinical
data related to them would be of value to the prac-
ticing oncologist. During the preparation of this manu-
script,
nivolumab
received
FDA
approval
for
the
treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) that
has relapsed or progressed after autologous HSCT and
post-transplantation treatment with brentuximab vedo-
tin. The subsequent section concerning checkpoint
blockade therapy was updated to reflect this approval.
Vaccines
There have been several trials evaluating the use of
vaccines in the treatment of lymphoma with one study
validating the vaccine approach by demonstrating im-
provement of disease-free survival in a randomized, con-
trolled clinical trial [118], while others have reported
varying levels of success [119, 120]. As T cell activation
is critical to a clinically relevant immune response, there
is a potentially a significant role for vaccines in the treat-
ment of lymphoma, particularly in combination with
other modalities. For vaccines to have a more significant
role, there is great need for new antigens, but unfortu-
nately very few true tumor specific antigens in lymph-
oma are known. Genome sequencing in context of HLA
binding permits the identification of large numbers of
neoantigens to which vaccines may be developed [121].
The failure of vaccines may be due in large part to an
immunosuppressive microenvironment, which may be
secondary to past treatments or the inherent biology of
the lymphoma. As such, there is a need to further under-
stand vaccine efficacy in association with the microenvir-
onment and develop biomarkers which will permit us to
identify subsets of patients or specific lymphomas that
more likely to benefit from immunotherapy in general.
Cellular therapy
There are a variety of cellular therapies that have recently
demonstrated clinical efficacy in lymphomas. These ther-
apies include partially HLA-matched third-party Epstein-
Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs),
marrow and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (MIL/TIL),
NK cells, and most prominently genetically-engineered T
cells, particularly CAR T cells targeting CD19 [122–125].
Third-party EBV-specific CTLs
� There is an increasing number of studies
demonstrating that allogenic donor or “off-the-shelf”
third-party CTLs specific for EBV can be used safely
and successfully to treat EBV-associated lymphomas
[122, 126].
� One donor can be used to generate antigen-specific
T cells that can be infused into multiple recipients
making them readily and immediately available to
treat patients.
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 11 of 25
 CAR T cell therapy
� In contrast to the relatively large numbers and
successes in ALL and CLL, the use of CAR T cell
therapy for the treatment of lymphoma is limited and
has short follow-up times. However, the available data
are encouraging with anecdotal data demonstrating
responses in refractory and relapsed FL, DLBCL, and
MCL [125].
� There have been two major categories of toxicities
associated with this therapy: cytokine release
syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities, which
may be related. Classical CRS is associated with high
fever, tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea and
hypoxia, and it can be life-threatening [127]. CRS is
associated with elevated circulating levels of several
cytokines including IL-6 and IFN-γ, and uncon-
trolled studies demonstrate that immunosuppression
using tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody,
with or without corticosteroids can reverse the
syndrome. Neurologic toxicities observed with
CAR-T cell therapy have included aphasia,
dysphasia, tremor, and seizure. These have
generally been transient, lasting up to 2 weeks,
but they also can be life threatening.
� A significant practical obstacle in making this
technology more broadly accessible is that the
screening and production process requires several
weeks. However, improving culture techniques have
reduced production times to less than two weeks.
There has also been increased standardization and
automation in manufacturing in preparation to
provide CAR T cells to large numbers of patients as
commercial products.
� A key scientific question for this field is why the
response rates for lymphomas are so variable and not
as high as those observed in ALL. One hypothesis is
that it may relate to host T cell function. A highly
related question is what is the optimal T cell
phenotype for response and persistence, which
appears to correlate with duration of response [128].
� The majority of trials have targeted CD19, but CAR
T cells targeting a number of other lymphoma
antigens (e.g., CD22, CD28, CD30, ROR1) are in
early clinical trials or in development [129].
� This technology is very promising as a salvage
regimen. However, the immediate question is its role
and timing among the many emerging choices for
refractory and relapsed lymphomas. There will be
increased utilization of this therapy and earlier
consideration for it as a treatment option, as long as
it proves to be safe (see toxicities), and especially if it
is shown to be a “once and done” option, which has
been observed in ALL.
Bispecific T cell Engager (BiTE) molecules
� Blinatumomab is FDA approved for the treatment of
relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL. It
recruits cytotoxic T cells to target tumor B cells by
linking the CD3 and CD19 antigens.
� In a phase II clinical trial, treatment of heavily
pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL
with blinatumomab showed an acceptable safety
profile and resulted in objective (ORR = 43%) and
durable responses [130].
� CRS and neurotoxicity have been observed with
blinatumomab.
Checkpoint blockade
Tumor immune evasion pathways have been most thor-
oughly studied in solid tumors; however, emerging data
have demonstrated that malignancies of hematopoietic
origin are also able to co-opt their local environment in
order to escape immune attack. Activated T cells upreg-
ulate negative costimulatory receptors, such as PD-1 and
cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) [131]. En-
gagement of PD-1 or CTLA-4 with ligands expressed on
tumor cells or professional antigen presenting cells re-
sults in down-regulation of effector T cell function and
represents a potent mechanism of immune evasion
across a number of human cancers. Antibodies which
block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions have demonstrated that
in select subtypes of HL and NHL, the PD-1 ligands are
over-expressed due to a genetic amplification of the loci
encoding them [132–134]. Other mechanisms of PD-L1
over-expression in lymphomas have also been eluci-
dated. Reports from early-phase clinical trials of PD-1
blockade have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
HL and also appear active against some NHLs.
� Preclinical studies suggested that Reed-Sternberg
cells exploit the PD-1 pathway to evade immune
detection. In classic HL, alterations in chromosome
9p24.1 increase the abundance of the PD-1 ligands,
PD-L1 and PD-L2, and promote their induction
through Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) signaling [133].
Based on these observations, nivolumab, a PD-1-
blocking antibody, was investigated in 23 patients
with relapsed or refractory HL [1]. An objective
response was reported in 20 patients (87%) per
investigator assessment, including 17% with a CR
and 70% with a PR; the remaining 3 patients (13%)
had stable disease. The rate of PFS at 24 weeks was
86%. In a subsequent phase II study, nivolumab was
investigated in relapsed/refractory classical HL
patients. Results from this study illustrated an
ORR of 66% per independent review; CR and PR
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 12 of 25
 rates were 8.8% and 57.5%, respectively. At the
time of the database lock for this study, 62% of
responders remained in response with a median
follow-up time of 8.9 months [135]. Based on
results from these studies, nivolumab was granted
accelerated approval by the FDA on May 17, 2016
for patients with classical HL that has progressed
following autologous HSCT and brentuximab
vedotin.
� In trials with small numbers of patients, responses
have been observed with CTLA-4 or PD-L1
blockade in FL and DLBCL [136–138].
� With virally-associated lymphoid tumors
(e.g., EBV+ DLBCL), most all have increased
PD-L1 on tumor cells [132, 139]. Therefore,
determining biological heterogeneity may allow
for the identification of subsets susceptible to
PD-1 blockade.
� Trials of PD-1 blockade in lymphoma show
toxicities similar to those reported in solid tumors.
� Although results are very preliminary, the efficacy
of PD-1 blockade as a single agent rivals that of
chemotherapy in heavily pretreated patients, and
consideration should be given to studying these
agents earlier in the disease course and in
combination with conventional agents as well
as other forms of immune therapy, particularly
vaccines.
Issues related to immunotherapy research in lymphoma
� The panel thought it was essential to try to learn as
much as possible from every patient who enters a
trial. Specifically, it is important to obtain tumor and
blood samples from every patient. Patient samples
are critical for evaluation of:
Tumor microenvironment
Systemic immune responses
Tumor and host mutational burden
Tumor antigens
T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire (locally and
systemically) and clonal T cell expansion within
tumors
� The panel suggested that pretreatment biopsies
should be mandatory for participation in clinical
trials and strongly suggested that follow-up biopsies
be obtained at the time of relapse in order to
understand mechanisms of resistance. In order to
do so, there is a need for funding for sample banks.
� One of the major problems that will need to be
addressed is how to design and prioritize
immunotherapy trials with so many competing
agents and modalities. The panel suggested that a
profile/portfolio of collaborative immune studies
with uniform approaches to immune monitoring be
established in order to develop a large dataset.
� It was emphasized that the majority of trials will be
developed and conducted with pharmaceutical
companies. Thus, it is imperative for industry to
share the biologic data that result from these
studies. A collaborative effort is needed to bring
together different interests and strengths in order to
develop important trial(s) and generate robust data.
There is a strategic advantage to a pharma-academia
partnership. Such a partnership will result in faster
completion of trials with greater scientific depth and
would be a “win-win” situation for both entities.
� In thinking about developing immunotherapeutic
trials in lymphoma, the extraordinary heterogeneity
of diseases, as well as within disease heterogeneity,
must be recognized. Therefore, it is essential to
study the quality and pathologic evidence of
immune infiltration, which is the genetic basis for
the perturbation and modulation of regulators. This
understanding of the biology and heterogeneity
must be linked to specific treatments for diseases
Acute leukemia
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ALL remain for-
midable clinical challenges largely due to resistance of
leukemia to current therapies and leukemia relapse
[140, 141]. Negative immune regulatory mechanisms
present in acute leukemia may contribute to the devel-
opment of a suppressive microenvironment that pro-
tects
leukemic
cells
from
immune
destruction.
Furthermore,
immune
cell
abnormalities
including
impaired NK cell activity and increased frequency and
immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells
have been described in patients with acute leukemia
[142, 143].
During the past four decades, allogeneic HSCT follow-
ing both myeloablative and non-myeloablative (reduced
intensity) conditioning regimens has been established as
a standard and curative treatment option for acute
leukemia [144–146]. The anti-leukemic activity of allo-
geneic HSCT relies not only on the effects of high dose
chemotherapy or irradiation given during the condition-
ing regimen, but also on the immune-mediated graft-
versus-leukemia effect [147–149]. The use of cytokines
or pharmacologic agents to restore immune cell effector
functions and, by extension, anti-leukemic effects repre-
sent other immunotherapeutic approaches that have
been used in leukemia treatment [150–153].
Several non-transplant immunotherapeutic strategies
are currently being evaluated in numerous clinical trials.
These include among others the use antibody based
therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T cells,
NK cells, and vaccine based therapies.

 Current immunotherapies in acute leukemia
Blinatumomab
Blinatumomab is a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T cell
engager that activates endogenous T cells when bound
to the CD19-expressing target cell. Blinatumomab was
studied in patients with MRD-positive B-lineage ALL
after intensive chemotherapy and in follow-up studies in
patients
with
relapsed
and
refractory
Philadelphia
chromosome-negative B cell ALL [154–157]. The role of
blinatumomab in is currently being evaluated in a Phase
III clinical trial (ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group,
NCT02003222) in patients with newly diagnosed BCR-
ABL-Negative B Lineage ALL.
Blinatumomab was granted accelerated approval by
the FDA on December 3, 2014 for the treatment of
Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refrac-
tory B cell precursor ALL [155, 158]. The basis of the
approval was a single arm trial with 185 evaluable adults.
Blinatumomab was administered in patients with refrac-
tory/relapsed ALL by continuous infusion for 4 weeks of
a 6-week cycle. Up to two cycles were used for induction
and three cycles for consolidation. The complete remis-
sion rate was 33% (95% CI: 27%–41%) with 2 cycles of
treatment with blinatumomab, and the median duration
of response was 6.7 months (range, 0.46–16.5 months).
Median OS was 6.1 months (95% CI: 4.2–7.5 months). A
minimal residual response was achieved by 31% (95% CI:
25%–39%) of all patients.
Safety was evaluated in 212 patients with relapsed or
refractory ALL treated with blinatumomab [158]. The
most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were pyrexia,
headache, peripheral edema, febrile neutropenia, nausea,
rash and tremor. Elevated transaminases were the most
common (>10%) laboratory abnormalities related to blina-
tumomab. A neurological toxicity occurred in approxi-
mately 50% of patients. CRS was reported in 12% of the
patients (grade 3 ≥ CRS syndrome in 2%). Blinatumomab
administration was interrupted in 32% of the patients and
discontinued in 17%. The most common reasons for
interruption were neurologic toxicity and CRS. The
most
common
reasons
for
permanent
withdrawal
included neurologic toxicity and sepsis.
Leukemia Panel Recommendations:
� The panel recommended the use of blinatumomab
for patients with relapsed or refractory ALL based
on level B evidence.
Emerging therapies
Monoclonal antibodies in acute leukemia
Engagement of mAb with leukemia target antigens can
lead to direct apoptosis, CDC, and ADCC [159]. Antigens
expressed on leukemia blasts or preferentially expressed
on leukemia stem cells including CD33, CD45, CD96,
CD123, CD135, CLL-1 and T cell immunoglobulin
mucin-3 (TIM-3) represent potential targets for antibody-
based therapy in AML [160, 161]. In ALL, CD19, CD20,
CD22 and CD52 (among others) represent potential tar-
gets [162–164]. A number of monoclonal antibodies are
currently being evaluated (Table 1). These include uncon-
jugated monoclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies
conjugated with cytotoxins.
An approach to enhance the efficacy of antibody ther-
apy is the use of BiTE antibodies like blinatumomab
mentioned on the previous page. By bridging tumor
antigens with T cell receptors, these can direct effector T
cells to leukemia blasts target antigens. In recent years,
different T cell engaging antibody constructs have been
developed. The use of bispecific antibodies that contain
CD16 and blast-specific antigens can enhance NK cell
mediated ADCC. Furthermore, anti-KIR antibodies to
block inhibitory KIR receptors can be used to enhance
NK cell cytotoxicity [165, 166].
Several phase I and phase II antigen-specific antibody
clinical trials are currently in development for the treat-
ment of acute leukemia. Epratuzumab, an unconjugated
humanized monoclonal antibody, binds to the third extra-
cellular domain of CD22. Epratuzumab was evaluated by

 the Children’s Oncology Group as single agent and as part
of a chemotherapy backbone in 114 relapsed ALL patients
either weekly or twice weekly [167, 168]. The CR rates
were similar to both arms (65% and 66%) but were not
significantly higher than those observed historically with-
out epratuzumab. The addition of epratuzumab was well
tolerated, with a similar toxicity profile to that observed
with the re-induction chemotherapy platform regimen
alone. While CR rates were not improved compared to
historical controls treated with chemotherapy alone, there
was a non-significant trend towards improvement in
MRD response with the addition of epratuzumab to re-
induction chemotherapy.
In a recent SWOG study (31 patients, median age: 41
years old), the addition of epratuzumab to the combin-
ation of clofarabine and cytarabine in adults with relapsed/
refractory pre-B ALL was evaluated [169]. The response
rate (CR plus CR without count recovery) was 52%, signifi-
cantly higher than the previous trial with clofarabine/cytar-
abine alone, where the response rate was 17%. The median
OS was 5 months (95% CI: 3–9 months).
Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, has been
evaluated with combination chemotherapy for patients
with B cell ALL demonstrating event-free survival (EFS)
as well as OS benefit and molecular CR rates [170–172].
A multicenter randomized trial compared a pediatric-
inspired protocol to the same regimen plus rituximab in
patients newly diagnosed with CD20-positive Ph-negative
B-Cell precursor ALL (105 in the rituximab arm and 104
in the control arm) [172]. Median age was 40 years. Both
randomization arms were well balanced for pretreatment
characteristics. CR rate was 92% and 91% in rituximab
and control arm, respectively. With a median follow-up of
30 months, patients treated in the rituximab arm had a
lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (2-year CIR,
18% [95% CI: 10–26] vs. 30.5% [95% CI: 21–40] in control
arm; P = 0.02), while no significant difference was ob-
served regarding non-relapse mortality between both
arms. This translated into longer EFS in patients treated
in the rituximab arm (2-year EFS, 65% [95% CI: 56–75] vs
52% [95% CI: 43–63] in control arm; P = 0.038). When
censoring patients who received allogeneic HSCT in first
CR at transplant time, EFS and OS were longer in the
rituximab arm.
Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 antibody that targets a
membrane proximal small-loop epitope on the CD20 mol-
ecule. Similar to rituximab, ofatumumab was combined
with ALL chemotherapy in a phase II clinical study. The
CR rate was 96%; and 96% of patients achieved MRD
negativity. The one year CR duration and OS were 90%
and 88% respectively [173, 174].
Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody
directed against the CD52 antigen present on the surface
of immune cells. Alemtuzumab has limited activity as
single agent in patients with ALL [175]. In a phase I
study by CALGB, alemtuzumab was administered post-
remission for eradication of MRD. The addition of alem-
tuzumab resulted in reduction of MRD, but it was also
associated with viral infections [176]. Based on these
results an expansion phase was completed which may
confirm the preliminary results.
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a humanized anti-CD22
antibody conjugated to calicheamicin. In a recent phase
3 trial patients with relapsed or refractory ALL were
randomized to inotuzumab ozogamicin or standard of
care intensive chemotherapy [177]. The rate of CR was
significantly
higher in
the inotuzumab ozogamicin
group than in the standard-therapy group (80.7% vs.
29.4%, P < 0.001). Among the patients who had CR a
higher percentage in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group
had results below the threshold for minimal residual
disease. The duration of remission was longer in the
inotuzumab ozogamicin group (median, 4.6 months vs.
3.1 months; P = 0.03). In the survival analysis, which in-
cluded all 326 patients, PFS was significantly longer in
the inotuzumab ozogamicin group (median, 5.0 months
vs. 1.8 months; P < 0.001); the median OS was 7.7
months (95% CI: 6.0 to 9.2) versus 6.7 months (95% CI:
4.9 to 8.3), and the hazard ratio was 0.77 (97.5% CI,
0.58 to 1.03) (P = 0.04). Inotuzumab ozogamicin has
already received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designa-
tion for patients with relapsed or refractory ALL.
CD33 is a myeloid differentiation antigen that is
broadly expressed on AML blasts. Antibody-based thera-
peutics in AML have targeted CD33 for many years.
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a targeted antineoplastic
agent consisting of a recombinant anti-CD33 humanized
antibody linked to N-acetyl-γ-calicheamicin. Gemtuzu-
mab ozogamicin was approved in 2000 by the FDA for
use in patients age 60 or older with CD33 + AML in first
relapse [178, 179]. However, in 2010 gemtuzumab ozo-
gamicin was voluntary withdrawn after a phase 3 trial
(SWOG S0106) in newly diagnosed AML based showed
a trend toward an increased mortality in the gemtuzu-
mab ozogamicin arm [180]. A recent meta-analysis from
five randomized controlled trials incorporating gemtuzu-
mab ozogamicin demonstrated a significant survival
benefit for patients with favorable and intermediate cyto-
genetic characteristics suggesting of reassessing the
status of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [181]. Given the po-
tential of targeting CD33, new CD33 monoclonal anti-
bodies are in development in clinical trials and CD33
has been incorporated in bi-specific antibodies such as
CD33/CD3 or CD33/CD123.
SGN‑CD33, a CD33-directed antibody conjugated to
two molecules of a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer, has
been evaluated as monotherapy in patients with CD33-
positive

 treatment naïve patients and in combination with hypo-
methylating agents [182, 183].
CSL362 is a fully humanized anti-CD123 monoclonal
antibody, engineered for greater ADCC by higher affinity
for NK cell CD16. An early report from a phase I clinical
trial of 25 AML high-risk patients who achieved CR indi-
cated that the antibody was safe and well tolerated [184].
Leukemia Panel Recommendations:
� The panel recommended the use of rituximab in
patients with CD20-positive Ph-negative B-Cell
precursor ALL based on Level A evidence.
� All panelists agreed that mAbs should be evaluated
in clinical trials in the relapsed/refractory setting, in
newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients with
combination chemotherapy, and in high-risk
patients in complete remission.
Immune checkpoint blockade
Surface expression and inhibitory functions of check-
point inhibitors are up-regulated in T cells present in the
tumor microenvironment. While the presence of these
inhibitory receptors on T cells is physiologically neces-
sary to regulate cellular activation, their overexpression
in disease leads to dysfunction of T cells and other im-
mune effector cells [185–187]. In the setting of cancer,
chronic overexpression of checkpoint molecules results
in T cell dysfunction and impairs anti-tumor immunity.
The PD-1/PDL-1 pathway has been investigated in
preclinical leukemia mouse models. The PD-1 recep-
tor biology, expression of PD-1 on the surface of acti-
vated immune cells and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2,
on leukemic blasts and functional consequences of
antibody-based or pharmacologic blockade of PD-1
are under investigation in acute leukemia [188–190].
PD-1 blockade can restore anti-leukemia T cell func-
tions and thus may offer therapeutic advantages in
acute leukemia. Given the acceptable tolerability, pre-
clinical rationale, and immunological activity of PD-1/
PD-L1 blockade, clinical trials of anti-PD-1 mAbs are
underway in acute leukemia patients [191]. Several other
checkpoint molecules are known [192, 193] and are under
investigation in acute leukemia, including CTLA-4, TIM-
3, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), and B and T cell
lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA).
Leukemia Panel Recommendations:
� The panel was in consensus that there is preclinical
rationale for consideration of clinical trials for
immune-checkpoint blockade in acute leukemia.
� The panel identified the following clinical settings
for evaluation of immune-checkpoint blockade in
acute leukemia: patients with MRD, high-risk
patients, and elderly patients.
CAR T Cells for the treatment of acute leukemia
Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express a CAR
has emerged as a powerful immunotherapy. CAR-based
therapies have been studied mainly in patients with B
cell ALL. As described above, CAR are synthetic mole-
cules
consisting
of
an
extracellular
antigen-binding
domain fused via a spacer region to intracellular signal-
ing domains that are capable of activating T cells. CARs
engage molecular structures independent of antigen
processing by the target cell and independent of MHC
[194, 195]. Over the course of years, several generations
of CAR-T cells with different and multiple costimula-
tory intracellular domains have been developed and
tested in clinical trials [80]. First generation CAR include
a single T cell stimulatory domain such as CD3-zeta.
Second generation CAR add a co-stimulatory domain
most typically derived from CD28 or CD137 (4-1BB).
Third generation CAR, not yet in clinical trials, include 2
co-stimulatory signals. The later CAR generations with
additional intracellular signaling domains have increased
the activity by circumventing the T cell’s need for co-
stimulatory molecules. The addition of a co-stimulatory
domain in the new generation CARs improved the repli-
cative capacity and persistence of modified T cells. Several
gene transfer technologies are used to engineer T cells to
express CARs including electroporation as well as retro-
viral and lentiviral vector methods.
Most studies using CARs have focused on hematologic
malignancies by targeting CD19 [196]. Multiple clinical
trials using other antigens are underway in ALL and
AML. Reported clinical trials using CAR T cells differed
in the design of the CAR, expression of the CAR on the
T cells, conditions of the T cell culture, lymphodepleting
strategy, cytokine support for the infused T cells, and
timing of CAR T cell infusion with regard to standard
therapy such as allogeneic HSCT [80].
High remission rates have been reported in patients
with relapsed/refractory ALL treated with CAR T cells
with CR rates of 70%-90%. Also, durable remissions were
observed without additional therapy [80, 197–200]. In
addition, in studies that included patients with prior
history of allogeneic HSCT, no graft-versus-host disease
was observed. Furthermore, among the different studies,
the persistence of CAR-modified T cells varied, which
could be related to different CAR design.
Twenty-one children and young adults with ALL were
treated in a phase I clinical study with CD19-CAR in-
corporating an anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment
plus TCR zeta and CD28 signaling domains. Among 20
patients with B-ALL, the CR rate was 70% (95% CI: 45.7–
88.1), with 12 of 20 patients with B-ALL achieving MRD-
negative complete response (60%; 95% CI: 36.1–80.9). OS
at a median follow-up of 10 months was 51.6% at
9.7 months and beyond. Leukemia-free survival of 12
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90 
Page 16 of 25
 patients who achieved an MRD-negative CR was 78.8%
beginning at 4.8 months [201].
Sixteen patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL
were treated in a phase I clinical study with autologous T
cells expressing the 19-28z CAR specific to the CD19 anti-
gen. The overall CR rate was 88%, which allowed transi-
tion of most of these patients to allo-HSCT. This therapy
was as effective in high-risk patients with Philadelphia
chromosome–positive (Ph+) disease as in those with re-
lapsed disease after previous allogeneic HSCT [202].
Thirty children and adults with relapsed or refractory
ALL were treated with autologous T cells transduced
with a CD19-directed CAR lentiviral vector that in-
cluded the 4-1BB costimulatory signal (CTL019). CR
was achieved in 27 patients (90%), including 2 patients
with blinatumomab-refractory disease and 15 who had
undergone stem cell transplantation. At 6 months, the
probability that a patient would have persistence of
CTL019 was 68% (95% CI: 50 to 92), and the probability
that a patient would have relapse-free B cell aplasia was
73% (95% CI: 57 to 94) [199]. Sustained remission was
achieved with a 6-month EFS rate of 67% (95% CI: 51–
88%) and an OS rate of 78% (95% CI: 65–95%).
CAR T cell therapies are associated with neurologic
toxicities including encephalopathy and seizures, which
could be reversible. CRS is a common and potentially
life-threatening toxicity associated with CAR T cell ther-
apy [199, 201, 202]. It is associated with elevation of
cytokines including interleukin-2 receptor ɑ (IL-2Rɑ),
IL-6, IL-10 and IFN.
IL-6 inhibitors have been used to ameliorate CRS. The
development of CRS may correlate with response to ther-
apy; patients who develop CRS often respond to therapy.
Moreover, the severity of CRS may correlate with the
tumor burden. Furthermore, B cell aplasia is an expected
on-target result of CD19-directed therapies and has
served as a useful surrogate to determine the persistence
and effectiveness of CD19-directed CAR-T cells.
The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy status to
CTL019, an investigational CAR therapy for the treatment
of pediatric and adult patients with relapsed/refractory
ALL. CTL019 -engineered T cells express a CAR in which
the T cell activation signal is provided by the CD3-zeta
domain, and the costimulatory signal is provided by the
CD137 (4-1BB) domain.
Leukemia Panel Recommendations:
� The panel recognizes the lack of level A evidence
regarding the use of CAR T cells. However, all panelists
agreed that there are very encouraging clinical data
regarding the use of CAR T cells. With current-
ongoing studies using CAR T cells, the panel concluded
that this treatment modality is among the most prom-
ising immunotherapies for the treatment of ALL.
� The panel recommended the development of
guidelines for management of complications with
CAR T cells.
Natural killer cells for the treatment of acute leukemia
NK cells contribute to anti-leukemic immune responses
both by exerting direct cytotoxic activity and activating
other immune cells [203, 204]. In patients with acute
leukemia, there is impairment of NK cell activity medi-
ated by several mechanisms including reduced expres-
sion
of
activating
receptors
and
reduced
NK
cell
cytokine secretion capacity [205–208]. Furthermore, low
expression of NK ligands on leukemia blasts and pro-
duction of soluble immunosuppressive factors contribute
to impaired NK cell activity [209, 210]. Different strat-
egies for NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy have
been studied including the administration of anti-KIR
antibodies that can block NK cell inhibitory recognition,
the use of cytokines including IL-15 and IL-2, adoptively
transferred HLA-haploidentical NK cells and the use of
NK cell lines [203, 204, 211–213].
In particular, adoptive therapy using haploidentical NK
cells in combination with cyclophosphamide and fludar-
abine to lymphodeplete the recipient and facilitate ex-
pansion of the allogeneic NK cells with interleukin (IL)-
2 administration induced CR in patients with relapsed
and refractory AML. Furthermore, the use of IL-2-
diphtheria fusion protein (IL2DT) to deplete regulatory
T cells, led to improvements in rates of in vivo NK-cell
expansion and AML remissions (CR rate 53%) compared
with patients that did not received IL2DT (CR rate 21%,
P = 0.02) [212, 214].
Leukemia Panel Recommendations:
� The panel recognizes the lack of level A evidence
regarding the use of NK cells. However, all panelists
agreed that there are very encouraging clinical data
regarding the use of NK cells.
� The panel identified the following clinical settings as
high priority for evaluation of NK cell based
therapies in acute leukemia: refractory patients,
patients with MRD, and high-risk patients.
Vaccines
To stimulate anti-leukemic responses active immunizations
through vaccination has been explored for patients with
acute leukemia. Several types of vaccines have been used for
patients with acute leukemia; peptide vaccines, granulocytes
macrophage-colony stimulating factor vaccines, and DC
vaccines. Moreover, different maturation protocols have
been applied for the generation of these vaccines. Pre-
clinical and clinical trials involving vaccination with peptides
derived from different leukemia antigens, including Wilms’s
tumor 1 (WT1), PR1, or hyalunoric-acid-mediated motility
Boyiadzis et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:90

 (RHAMM), demonstrated immunogenicity and clinical
safety [215–221].
Leukemia Panel Recommendations:
� The panel recognizes the lack of level A evidence
regarding the use of vaccines in acute leukemia.
� The panel agreed that clinical trials using vaccines
in acute leukemia have established their safety and
immunogenicity.
� The panel identified the following clinical settings as
high priority for evaluation of vaccines in acute
leukemia: patients with MRD and high-risk patients.
� More studies are needed to investigate the effects of
chemotherapy on the immune system as intensive
chemotherapy may impair the immune responses to
vaccination.
Issues related to immunotherapy research in acute
leukemia
The methods and timing needed to evaluate response to
immune therapies in acute leukemia are not established,
and, similar to solid tumors treated with immune ther-
apies, endpoints such as CR rates and PFS may need to
be re-evaluated.
Leukemia Panel Recommendations:
� There are insufficient data to evaluate whether
current criteria for clinical response in acute
leukemia are adequate for evaluation of response to
immune therapies and whether immune related
response criteria as in the setting of solid tumors
will be useful in acute leukemia.
� The panel recommended detailed immune
monitoring in ongoing clinical trials that are tailored
to specific immune therapies.
� The timing of the evaluation of response is not known
and should be tailored to the specific immune therapy.
� Standards of immune monitoring in acute leukemia
should be established and include among others
analysis of bone marrow microenvironment and
circulating immune cells.
� Information gained from all on-going clinical trials
may provide the foundation for the generation of
new response criteria and the proper timing of
response evaluation.
