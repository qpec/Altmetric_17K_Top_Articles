an
Context: The numbers of vegans and vegetarians have increased in the last deca-
des. However, the impact of these diets on bone health is still under debate.
Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to study the impact of
vegetarian and vegan diets on bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk. Data
Sources: A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Scopus, and Science
Direct, covering the period from the respective start date of each database to
November 2017. Data Extraction: Two investigators evaluated 275 studies against
the inclusion criteria (original studies in humans, written in English or Spanish and
including vegetarian or vegan diets and omnivorous diets as factors with BMD val-
ues for the whole body, lumbar spine, or femoral neck and/or the number of frac-
tures as the outcome) and exclusion criteria (articles that did not include imaging
or studies that included participants who had suffered a fracture before starting the
vegetarian or vegan diet). The quality assessment tool for observational cohort and
cross-sectional studies was used to assess the quality of the studies. Results:
Twenty studies including 37 134 participants met the inclusion criteria. Compared
with omnivores, vegetarians and vegans had lower BMD at the femoral neck and
lumbar spine and vegans also had higher fracture rates. Conclusions: Vegetarian
and vegan diets should be planned to avoid negative consequences on bone
health.

INTRODUCTION
Osteoporosis is defined as a skeletal disorder character-
ized by thinning and deterioration of bone tissue with
loss of calcification and density predisposing to an in-
creased risk of fracture.1 It has been estimated that this
major health problem affects 200 million people world-
wide.2–4 Bone mass decreases as people age (particularly
in postmenopausal women), leading in some cases to
osteoporosis and fragility fractures.5,6 As the elderly
population has increased worldwide, osteoporosis and
fracture prevalence have risen through the last decades.7
Melton et al8,9 estimated that approximately 1 in 3
women and 1 in 5 men would suffer a fracture after the
age of 50 years. Fractures are related to increase mor-
bidity and mortality,10 and in the United States, they
are responsible for an annual direct economic cost of 17
to 20 billion dollars.11,12 It is therefore of critical

 importance to identify risk factors associated with poor
bone health in order to reduce fracture rates and mor-
tality and, consequently, healthcare-related costs.
Several genetic and lifestyle factors influence bone
mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk. Among them,
physical activity and diet are considered the most rele-
vant for BMD.13 Regarding diet, some nutrients, such
as calcium and vitamin D, are essential for maintaining
bone health.13 Other nutrients such as protein, vitamin
B12, zinc, and n-3 fatty acids, which are mainly found
in animal products, may also be related to bone health,
although their roles are less clear.14–16 Consequently,
vegetarians and vegans might be at greater risk of lower
BMD and fractures than omnivores because of a defi-
ciency of these nutrients in their diets.14 Vegetarians are
defined as individuals who do not consume meat, poul-
try, fish, seafood, and flesh from any animal but include
dairy products and/or eggs in their diets. Vegans ex-
clude all animal products from their diets and therefore
do not consume dairy products and eggs.
Compared with nonvegetarian diets, vegetarian
diets can provide protection against many chronic dis-
eases, such as heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabe-
tes, obesity, and some cancers such as colorectal and
prostate17; however, a 2009 meta-analysis of 9 studies
found that vegetarians had 4% lower BMD than
omnivores.18
In contrast, some studies that have assessed the risk
of fractures in vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores did
not show statistically significant differences among
groups.19,20 Because of these inconclusive results, it
seems timely to perform a systematic review and meta-
analysis that includes new studies with larger sample
sizes and novel approaches to evaluate the risk of frac-
tures. The aims of this systematic review and meta-
analysis are 1) to quantify the effect that vegetarian and
vegan diets may have on BMD and fracture risk and 2)
to compare the impact of vegetarian and vegan diets
versus omnivore diets on BMD and fracture risk. The
research question this study sought to address was
whether vegetarians and vegans have lower BMD and
higher risk of fracture.
METHODS
Search strategy
The present systematic review and meta-analysis was
registered
in
the
PROSPERO
database
(ID:
CRD42017055508) and followed the systematic review
methodology proposed in the Preferred Reporting
Items
for
Systematic
Reviews
and
Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) statement (Table S1 in the Supporting
Information online).21,22 A specific question was con-
structed
according
to
the
PICO
(Participants,
Interventions,
Control,
Outcomes)
principle
(Table 1).23
A systematic search of the literature was carried out
using PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct databases
(from the beginning of each respective database to
November 2017). Two different searches were con-
ducted in each database to ensure that all of the pub-
lished studies were included in the meta-analysis. When
possible, the search included Thesauros (MESH terms
in PubMed). First, the diet terms were combined as fol-
lows: “Vegans” OR “Diet, Vegan” OR “Vegetarians” OR
“Diet, Vegetarian.” Second, the bone and fracture terms
were combined as follows: “Bone and Bones” OR “Bone
Density” OR “Fractures, Bone” OR “Osteoporosis,
Postmenopausal” OR “Osteoporosis.” Finally, both the
diet and the bone and fracture terms were combined
with “AND.” In Scopus and Science Direct, these terms
had to appear in the title, abstract, or keywords. The fil-
ters “humans,” “articles,” and “in English and Spanish”
were applied when possible. Two reviewers indepen-
dently examined each database to obtain the potential
publications. Agreement between reviewers was found
for 97% of the publications to be included. Inter-
reviewer discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
Arbitration by a third reviewer was used for unresolved
discrepancies. Relevant articles were obtained in full
and assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria
described below.
Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) original stud-
ies; 2) studies performed in humans; 3) studies written
in English or Spanish; 4) studies including vegetarian
(lacto-ovo-vegetarian;
ovo-vegetarian,
or
lacto-
vegetarian) or vegan diets and omnivorous diets as fac-
tors; 5) studies including BMD measured with imaging
techniques; and 6) studies including BMD values for
the whole body (WB), lumbar spine (LS), or femoral
neck (FN) and/or the number of fractures as the out-
come. In the present study, vegetarians were defined as
those who excluded meat, fish, and seafood but not
milk and dairy products from their diet; vegans were
defined as those who excluded any kind of animal
product.
Exclusion criteria
The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) articles that
did not provide original data (eg, systematic reviews,
meta-analysis,
literature
reviews);
2)
case
reports;
3) articles that did not include imaging techniques

 (eg, only included bone biomarkers); and 4) studies that
included participants who had suffered a fracture before
starting the vegetarian or vegan diet.
Data extraction
For each study that included BMD as an outcome, rele-
vant data, including number of participants, sex, mean
age, ethnicity (Caucasian or Asian), diet (eg, vegetarian
or omnivores diet), the period of time for which the
vegetarian or vegan diet had been followed, quality as-
sessment, and BMD measurements and instruments
(dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] or dual-
photon
absorptiometry
[DPA]),
were
extracted
(Table 2).24–38 Number of fractures and body site of the
fracture were also recorded (Table 3).19,20,39–41 Bone
mineral density values were extracted from the different
studies, and only raw data (unadjusted) were used to
perform the meta-analyses.
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry enables differ-
ent types of scans that give information on several
regions. Compared with alternative bone densitometry
techniques, FN and LS DXA examinations have a num-
ber of advantages, including include a proven ability to
predict fracture risk, a consensus for defining osteopo-
rosis through BMD results according to the World
Health Organization T-score definition, and the ability
to monitor response to treatment.42 Moreover, WB
examinations provide extra body composition values
that can be included for many other purposes.43
Finally, LS, FN and WB BMD and/or fracture rates
were included as outcomes in the analysis. A total of 4
meta-analyses were carried out, with 3 bone site meas-
urements (LS, FN, and WB) and fracture rates as the
main outcomes. When >1 article with the same sample
was identified, only the article with the larger sample
was selected and included in the analysis.
Quality assessment
The Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort
and Cross-Sectional Studies provided by the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute was used to assess the
quality
of
the
included
studies.44
Two
reviewers
independently assessed and thereafter discussed the
quality of the studies. Agreement between reviewers
was found for 90% of the publications. Inter-reviewer
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Arbitration
by
a
third
reviewer
was
used
for
unresolved
discrepancies.
Search summary
A total of 486 articles were extracted from PubMed,
Scopus, and Science Direct. After eliminating all of the
duplicates, 275 manuscripts were evaluated. Review of
titles and abstracts excluded 222 records, leaving 53
articles for full-text assessment. Five articles were dis-
carded because they did not have another group (om-
nivorous group) with which bone status could be
compared.45–49 Six studies were excluded because they
were literature reviews, systematic reviews, or meta-
analyses.18,50–53 One study was discarded because it in-
cluded the same number of participants as another
study from the same authors.54 Bone mineral density
measurements or fracture rates were not reported for 3
studies.55–57 Seven studies did not follow a vegetarian or
vegan
diet.58–64
One
study
was
a
case
report.65
Unadjusted BMD data were not reported for 1 study.66
Nine additional studies were excluded from this system-
atic review and meta-analysis because LS, FN, or WB
BMD data were not presented; 5 of these studies mea-
sured BMD at the calcaneum,61,67–70 3 measured it at
the radius (mid and distal),71–73 and 1 measured it at
the
proximal
phalanx
of
the
third
finger.74
Consequently, the final sample consisted of 20 articles
(15 including BMD and 5 including fracture rate data)
(Figure 1).
Statistical analyses
For continuous data (BMD in g/cm2 comparing vegeta-
rians and vegans with omnivores for LS, FN, and WB),
the mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence inter-
val (95%CI) was used. Categorical data (fracture rates
referred to as the incidence of any new fracture) were
reported
as
relative
risks
(RRs)
with
a
95%CI.

 effects models were applied for continuous and categor-
ical data. Effect sizes were calculated for each outcome.
Sources of heterogeneity were investigated by sub-
group analyses comparing results based on diet (vegeta-
rians or vegans), sex (women or men), age (<50 y or
>50 y), ethnicity (Asian or Caucasian), and quality as-
sessment when information was available. For fracture
rates, the number of years of follow-up was also in-
cluded. All analyses were performed using Open
Meta[Analyst] software.
The heterogeneity of the studies was tested using
the I2 statistic.75 This statistic describes the variance
among studies as a proportion of the total variance. A
value of <25% indicated low heterogeneity, a value of
25% to 50% indicated moderate heterogeneity, a value
of >50% to 75% indicated high heterogeneity, and a
value of >75% indicated very high heterogeneity. The
associated P value of the heterogeneity of the studies
was also calculated, with a nonsignificant result indicat-
ing absence of heterogeneity.
Publication bias was assessed by Egger’s linear re-
gression test following the indications provided by
Peters et al.76 Additionally, the Begg and Mazumdar
rank correlation test was applied to measure asymmetry
in funnel plots.77
RESULTS
Description of the included studies
The 20 studies included 37 134 individuals (BMD data
were available for 4003 individuals, and fracture rate
data were available for 33 131 individuals).19,20,24–41 The
mean age of the participants varied from 25 to 80 years,
and most of the studies equally sampled omnivores and
vegetarians/vegans. One study only included men (5%;
n ¼ 1/20), most of the studies (65%; n ¼ 13/20) only in-
cluded women, and 6 studies included both women and
men (30%; n ¼ /20). Of the eligible studies, 45% (n ¼
9/20) included only vegetarians, 25% (n ¼ 5/20) in-
cluded only vegans, and 30% (6/20) included both vege-
tarians and vegans. Participants in 11 of the 20 studies
(55%) were Caucasians; participants in the other 9 stud-
ies (45%) were Asians. Of the 20 studies included in the
systematic review, 45% (n ¼ 9/20) were conducted in
Asia (3 in Taiwan, 2 Vietnam, 2 in India, 1 in Korea,
and 1 in Hong-Kong), 35% (n ¼ 7/20) were conducted
in North America (6 in the United States and 1 in
Canada), and 20% (n ¼ 4/20) were conducted in
Europe (1 in Italy, 1 in Finland, 1 in Slovakia, and 1 in
the United Kingdom). Regarding BMD measurements,
LS, FN and WB were reported for 13% (n ¼ 2/15) of
the included studies, LS and FN were reported for 40%

 (n ¼ 6/15) of the studies, LS was reported for 33% (n ¼
5/15) of the studies, and WB was reported for 13% (n ¼
2/15) of the studies. All of the studies for which the num-
ber of fractures was reported as an outcome were prospec-
tive studies. All but one of the studies for which BMD was
reported as an outcome were cross-sectional; the excep-
tion was a longitudinal study29 (Tables 2 and 3).
Quality assessment
The obtained grade for each study is included in Table
S2 in the Supporting Information online. Grades for the
included studies ranged from 28 to 64 points out of a
total 100 points. Most of the included studies in the pre-
sent meta-analysis were of medium quality.

Lumbar spine. As shown in Figure 2a, vegetarians and
vegans had lower LS BMD than omnivores (MD,
�0.032; 95%CI, �0.048 to �0.015). Heterogeneity
among studies for the lumbar spine BMD was moderate
(I2 ¼ 41.04; P ¼ 0.04).
Subgroup analysis. Results of the subgroup analysis
suggested that the effect of diet on LS BMD was stron-
ger among vegans (MD, �0.070; 95%CI, �0.116 to
�0.025) than among vegetarians (MD, �0.023; 95%CI,
�0.035 to �0.010) (Figure 2b). Additionally, the effect
was stronger in Caucasian participants (MD, �0.058;
95%CI, �0.101 to �0.015) than in Asian participants
(MD, �0.026; 95%CI, �0.038 to �0.013) (Figure 2c). In
regard to age, the effect was statistically significant in
those aged >50 years (MD, �0.032; 95%CI, �0.052 to
�0.012; P ¼ 0.002) but not in those aged <50 years
(MD, �0.031; 95%CI, �0.063 to 0.001) (Figure 2d).
Concerning the quality of the studies, the effect was
higher in those studies determined to be of higher
quality (grade of �50 points) (MD, �0.035; 95%CI,
�0.048 to �0.015) than in those with a grade of <50
points (Figure 2e). Heterogeneity was more pro-
nounced in vegans (I2 ¼ 62.83; P ¼ 0.013), Caucasians

Femoral neck. Figure 3a shows that vegetarians and
vegans had lower FN BMD than omnivores (MD,
�0.037; 95%CI, �0.054 to �0.020). Heterogeneity
among studies for the FN BMD was moderate (I2 ¼
48.92; P ¼ 0.034).
Subgroup analysis. Similar to findings from the LS
subgroup analyses, the effect of diet on FN BMD was
found to be stronger among vegans (MD, �0.055;
95%CI, �0.090 to �0.021) than among vegetarians (MD,

fect was also more pronounced in Caucasian participants
(MD, �0.082; 95%CI, �0.144 to �0.020) than in Asian
participants (MD, �0.031; 95%CI, �0.047 to �0.015)
(Figure 3c). The effect of vegetarianism and veganism
was significant in those aged >50 years (MD, �0.036;

aged <50 years (MD, �0.062; 95%CI, �0.145 to 0.021)
(Figure 3d). Similarly, the effect of vegetarianism and
veganism was significant in women (MD, �0.040;

(MD, �0.050; 95%CI, �0.145 to 0.046) (Figure 3e).
Concerning the quality of the studies, the effect was

 Subgroup analyses by age, years of follow-up, and study
quality were not possible because only 2 studies in-
cluded the age of the participants,19,20 only 1 included a
long-term follow-up (>10 y),39and only 1 was deter-
mined to be of low quality (score of <50 points).40
Sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis was developed
excluding the Appleby et al study19 as a possible outlier
(see Figure 5). The effect size of both vegetarian and
vegan diets on fracture risk increased (RR, 1.522;
95%CI, 1.338–1.731 vs RR, 1.316; 95%CI, 1.038–1.668),
and the heterogeneity of the studies decreased (I2 ¼
13.61; P ¼ 0.000 vs I2 ¼ 87.80; P < 0.001). Results for
the diet subgroup analyses were also modified. The ef-
fect of vegetarian diets on fracture risk became signifi-
cant (RR, 1.475; 95%CI, 1.286–1.693; P <0.001 vs RR,
1.254; 95%CI, 0.917–1.714), whereas the heterogeneity
of the studies decreased (I2 ¼ 16.52; P ¼ 0.302 vs I2 ¼
92.43; P ¼ 0.000). Similar results were found for the
ethnicity subgroup analysis, with the effect of vegetari-
anism and veganism on fracture risk in Caucasians be-
coming significant (RR, 1.491; 95%CI, 1.193–1.862; P <
0.001 vs RR, 1.285; 95%CI, 0.996– to 1.658) and the het-
erogeneity decreasing (I2 ¼ 46.28; P ¼ 0.155 vs I2 ¼
86.93; P < 0.001). When applying the sensitivity analy-
sis to the sex subgroup analysis, results were also modi-
fied, with the effect of vegetarian and vegan diets on
fracture risk becoming significant not only in men but
also in women (RR, 1.556; 95%CI, 1.354–1.789; P <
0.001 vs RR, 1.183; 95%CI, 0.820–1.708; P ¼ 0.033); ad-
ditionally the heterogeneity decreased (I2 ¼ 0; P ¼
0.707 vs I2 ¼ 91.83; P ¼ 0.000).
Publication bias
No indication for publication bias was found for studies
that included LS measurements (Begg P ¼ 0.128; Egger
P ¼ 0.070), WB measurements (Begg P ¼ 0.260; Egger
P ¼ 0.120), and fracture risk (Begg P ¼ 0.755; Egger
P ¼ 0.169). A modest publication bias was found for
the studies that included FN measurements (Begg P ¼
0.043; Egger P ¼ 0.014).
DISCUSSION
The present meta-analysis aimed to study the effect of
vegetarian and vegan diets compared with omnivorous
diets on BMD and fracture rates. Both vegetarians and
vegans were found to have lower BMD at the LS and
FN, and vegans had a higher risk of fracture than omni-
vores. The lower BMD and the higher risk of fracture
were more pronounced in vegans than in vegetarians
and in high-quality studies (�50 points) versus lower-
quality studies.
Previous studies have suggested that vegetarians
may have higher BMD and bone mineral content than
omnivores.24,71,74,78,79 However, recent studies have not
found any positive impact of vegetarian diets on bone
health,35,37 and some of them have found a negative im-
pact.28,31,35,36 In fact, most of the studies published in
the last decades have found lower BMD in vegetarians
and vegans compared with omnivores, although only 3
have found statistically significant associations.28,31,35,36
The present results are in line with a previous meta-
analysis that included 9 studies and found lower BMD
at the LS and the FN for vegetarians compared with
omnivores.18 Ho-Pham et al concluded that vegetarians
and vegans had approximately 4% lower BMD at the
FN and LS than omnivores.18 In contrast with the
results of the present study, they stated that this differ-
ence was statistically significant but not clinically rele-
vant. The present findings suggest that the lower BMD
values found for vegetarians and vegans could be clini-
cally relevant because fracture risk was found to be
higher in vegans than in omnivores.
Four of 5 studies included in the present meta-
analysis found higher fracture rates in vegetarians and
vegans compared with omnivores.20,75–77 The study from
Appleby et al19 was the only one that found a higher prev-
alence of fractures in female meat eaters than female vege-
tarians. This study compared fracture rates in meat eaters
(defined as those who eat meat), fish eaters (defined as
those who did not eat meat but did eat fish), vegetarians
(defined as those who did not eat meat or fish but did eat
either dairy products or eggs), and vegans (defined as
those who did not eat meat, fish, dairy products, or
eggs).19 In fact, when the study by Appleby et al19 was re-
moved from the sensitivity analyses, it was observed that
vegetarians had a higher fracture risk than omnivores.
The moderate heterogeneity observed among the
studies on BMD was partly explained by the type of diet,
age, sex, ethnicity, and quality of the studies. After con-
ducting subgroup analysis, the heterogeneity of the studies
performed in vegans, those aged <50 years, men, and
Asians was considerably reduced and became no longer
statistically significant. When a subgroup analysis was per-
formed with the studies stratified by quality, heterogeneity
was no longer statistically significant in high-quality stud-
ies. Heterogeneity among studies on fracture risk was very
high and partly explained by the type of diet, ethnicity,
and sex. Differences in heterogeneity were mainly due to
the Appleby et al study.19 This may be because meat eaters
smoked more and had higher alcohol consumption,
higher body mass index (BMI), lower physical activity lev-
els, and similar calcium intakes than vegetarians.
Subgroup analysis showed that the effect of vegetar-
ianism and veganism on fracture rates was only statisti-
cally significant for vegans, Asians, and men. When

 analyzing the effect on vegetarianism and veganism on
LS and FN BMD, this effect was higher in Caucasians
than in Asians, and it was only statistically significant in
studies determined to be of a higher quality (score of
�50 points) and in individuals aged >50 years.
Subgroup analyses showed that the increased fracture
risk was only statistically significant for vegans. One could
argue that specific nutrients found in higher amounts in
animal food sources, such as dietary calcium, high biologi-
cal value proteins, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and retinol,
which are present in ovo-lacto-vegetarian diets but in
lower quantities in vegan diets,17 could exert an important
impact on bone health. Similarly, in a previous large co-
hort study, Appleby et al19 suggested that vegans were
only at a higher risk of suffering a fracture when calcium
intake was <525 mg/day. However, a recent meta-analysis
concluded that calcium intake produced a small but non-
progressive increase in BMD, making it unlikely that cal-
cium intake would lead to a clinically significant reduction
in the risk of fractures.80 Moreover, when a vegan or vege-
tarian diet is appropriately planned, these nutrients defi-
ciencies should not occur.17
Others have hypothesized that proteins may have a
positive impact on bone health.15,81,82 In elderly people
with osteoporosis, increased levels of protein intake
(>0.8 g/kg body weight/day or 24% of total energy in-
take) are positively associated with BMD,15 a slower
rate of bone loss,81 and a reduced risk of hip fracture.82
Nevertheless, 2 meta-analyses suggested that there is
only a small positive effect of protein on BMD.15,16
As shown by Roman-Garcia et al,83 a deficiency in
vitamin B12 can negatively affect bone development
and maintenance. Vitamin B12 serves as a cofactor for
methionine synthase,83 which is involved in the metab-
olism of homocysteine. High homocysteine levels,
caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12, may affect bone
remodeling by increasing bone resorption and decreas-
ing bone formation and bone blood flow.84
The effect of vegetarianism and veganism on BMD
at the LS and FN was only statistically significant in the
population aged >50 years. Bone mineral density
decreases over time, and this population might have been
exposed to the effects of these diets for a longer period.
When stratifying by sex, the effect of diet on frac-
ture risk was only statistically significant in men.
However, results were provided separately by sex for
only 3 investigations, and therefore, results should be
considered with caution.19,31,33
The effect of vegetarianism and veganism on BMD
of the LS and FN was more pronounced in Caucasians
than in Asians. In contrast, when studying fracture
rates, the results of this study indicated that this effect
was only statistically significant in Asians. However, it
is necessary to highlight that only 2 studies included in
the subgroup analysis assessed fracture rates in Asian
populations,20,40 and therefore results may be equivocal.
In fact, as previously reported, Asian populations have
showed a lower fracture risk than Caucasian popula-
tions, even if they have a lower areal bone mineral den-
sity, lower weight, and smaller bone sizes.85,86 Asians
may have smaller bones but thicker and denser corti-
ces85,87; as a consequence, the authors hypothesized that
the impact of vegetarianism and veganism could be
higher in Caucasians than in Asians.
Moreover, the consumption of soy products is part
of the regular diet of the Asian population but it is not
so common in Western diets.88 Thus, Asian vegetarians
may have a higher intake of tofu and other soy products
compared with Caucasian vegetarians. Soybeans are a
rich source of calcium, proteins and isoflavones, a class
of phytoestrogens found predominantly in legumes and
beans. Because protein/isoflavones intakes have a mod-
est but statistically significant association with BMD as
well as with WB bone mineral content, the effect of veg-
etarianism and veganism could have a greater impact
on Caucasians than in Asians.89
It is worth noting that lifestyle factors may have influ-
enced
the
associations
between
diet
and
BMD.
Vegetarians and vegans tend to show healthier behaviors,
such as higher levels of physical activity, lower smoking
rates, and lower alcohol and caffeine intakes, than omni-
vores.90 Particularly, in the studies included in this system-
atic review and meta-analyses, vegans and vegetarians
generally reported higher levels of physical activity, lower
smoking rates, lower alcohol and caffeine intakes,28,29
lower BMI31,32 and lower energy28 and calcium intakes38
than omnivores, although some of these group differences
were not statistically significant in several studies.27,29,38
In the relationship between vegetarian/vegan diets
and bone health, it is important to consider the possible
effect that overall dietary quality can have. Among the
studies included in the present systematic review and
meta-analysis, only 1 study considered overall dietary
quality.38 In this study, diet quality was superior for indi-
viduals adhering to a vegan diet as compared with the
other diet groups, and there were no differences in BMD
among vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores, which sug-
gests that a high-quality vegan/vegetarian diets would look
similar to that of an omnivore in relation to bone health.
This meta-analysis has several strengths. To the
best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first meta-
analysis to examine the association between vegetarian-
ism and veganism and fracture rates. This analysis in-
cluded
not
only
fracture
rates,
but
also
BMD
measurements at the FN, LS, and WB. This allowed us to
estimate the total effect size of the vegan and vegetarian
diets on BMD with a larger sample size and a higher sta-
tistical power than a previously published meta-analysis.18

 The present study has a number of limitations.
First, most of the studies in the present meta-analysis
included only women, and hence results are mainly ap-
plicable to this population. Second, investigations in-
cluded a very heterogeneous population (ie, some of the
studies focused on Buddhist nuns or religious followers
of Buddhism, whereas others focused on young adult
vegetarians with very different characteristics). Third,
some factors associated with BMD and fracture risk,
such as the time that vegetarians and vegans had been
following the diet, daily energy intake, number of hours
engaged in physical activity, BMI, use of hormone re-
placement therapy, sunlight exposure, consumption of
alcohol, and smoking behavior, could not be evaluated
because this information was not reported for most of
the studies. For the same reason, the present study
could not evaluate differences in BMD and fracture
rates
between
pre-
and
postmenopausal
women.
Additionally, publication bias was found for the FN
measurements, and therefore results from this region
should be interpreted with caution. Another limitation is
the reliance on self-reported measurements, which are
prone to errors, for such data as BMI,91 physical activity,
and fracture rates. The lack of dietary quality information
for most studies could be considered another limitation.
Furthermore, whether individuals had a low bone mass
or osteoporosis prior to starting a vegetarian or vegan
diet, which could influence the results, was not reported
for any of the included studies. Moreover, for some of
the studies, it was reported that the participants were
mostly vegetarians or vegans or long-term vegetarians
without specifying the duration of the diet, which make
definitions sometimes ambiguous for interpretation.
Finally, it was not possible to run moderator analyses for
other important variables such as diet quality, energy in-
take, or physical activity because of the small number of
studies for which this information was reported.
CONCLUSION
The findings of this study suggest that both vegetarian
and vegan diets are associated with lower BMD com-
pared with omnivorous diets and that vegans have a
higher fracture risk than omnivores. The effect of vegan
diets on BMD is more pronounced than the effect of
vegetarian diets. Both vegetarian and vegan diets should
be appropriately planned to avoid dietary deficiencies
associated with bone health.
