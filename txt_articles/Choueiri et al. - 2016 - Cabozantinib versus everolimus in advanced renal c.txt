Summary
Background Cabozantinib is an oral inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including MET, VEGFR, and AXL. The randomised 
phase 3 METEOR trial compared the effi
  cacy and safety of cabozantinib versus the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who progressed after previous VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment. 
Here, we report the fi
 nal overall survival results from this study based on an unplanned second interim analysis.
Methods In this open-label, randomised phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients aged 18 years and older with 
advanced or metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, measurable disease, and previous treatment with one or more 
VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors to receive 60 mg cabozantinib once a day or 10 mg everolimus once a day. 
Randomisation was done with an interactive voice and web response system. Stratifi
 cation factors were Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center risk group and the number of previous treatments with VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. 
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent radiology review committee in the 
fi
 rst 375 randomly assigned patients and has been previously reported. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and 
objective response in all randomly assigned patients assessed by intention-to-treat. Safety was assessed per protocol in all 
patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The study is closed for enrolment but treatment and follow-up of 
patients is ongoing for long-term safety evaluation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01865747.
Findings Between Aug 8, 2013, and Nov 24, 2014, 658 patients were randomly assigned to receive cabozantinib 
(n=330) or everolimus (n=328). The median duration of follow-up for overall survival and safety was 18·7 months 
(IQR 16·1–21·1) in the cabozantinib group and 18·8 months (16·0–21·2) in the everolimus group. Median overall 
survival was 21·4 months (95% CI 18·7–not estimable) with cabozantinib and 16·5 months (14·7–18·8) with 
everolimus (hazard ratio [HR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·53–0·83]; p=0·00026). Cabozantinib treatment also resulted in 
improved progression-free survival (HR 0·51 [95% CI 0·41–0·62]; p<0·0001) and objective response (17% [13–22] 
with cabozantinib vs 3% [2–6] with everolimus; p<0·0001) per independent radiology review among all randomised 
patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (49 [15%] in the cabozantinib group vs 
12 [4%] in the everolimus group), diarrhoea (43 [13%] vs 7 [2%]), fatigue (36 [11%] vs 24 [7%]), palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (27 [8%] vs 3 [1%]), anaemia (19 [6%] vs 53 [17%]), hyperglycaemia (3 [1%] vs 16 [5%]), 
and hypomagnesaemia (16 [5%] vs none). Serious adverse events grade 3 or worse occurred in 130 (39%) patients in 
the cabozantinib group and in 129 (40%) in the everolimus group. One treatment-related death occurred in the 
cabozantinib group (death; not otherwise specifi
 ed) and two occurred in the everolimus group (one aspergillus 
infection and one pneumonia aspiration).
Interpretation Treatment with cabozantinib increased overall survival, delayed disease progression, and improved the 
objective response compared with everolimus. Based on these results, cabozantinib should be considered as a new 
standard-of-care treatment option for previously treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Patients should 
be monitored for adverse events that might require dose modifi
 cations.

Introduction
Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathology 
of renal cell carcinoma have led to the development of 
agents targeting the VEGFR and mTOR signalling 
pathways. First-line standard-of-care treatments for 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma are the VEGFR 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitors sunitinib and pazopanib. 
Second-line standard-of-care treatments include the 
VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors axitinib and sorafenib, 
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, and the PD-1 checkpoint 
inhibitor nivolumab.1–3 Few treatments have shown a 
survival benefi
 t, and none have shown an improvement in 
all three effi
  cacy endpoints of progression-free survival, 
objective response, and overall survival, compared with 
standard-of-care treatment in a randomised phase 3 trial in 
previously treated patients with renal cell carcinoma.

Cabozantinib is an oral inhibitor of tyrosine kinases 
including MET, VEGFR, and AXL.4 Upregulation of 
MET and AXL in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma happens 
as a consequence of von Hippel-Lindau protein 
dysfunction, has been implicated in tumour progression 
and VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor resistance in 
preclinical studies, and has been associated with a poor 
prognosis in patients with renal cell carcinoma.5–10 
The randomised phase 3 METEOR trial11 compared the 
effi
  cacy and safety of cabozantinib versus the mTOR 
inhibitor everolimus in patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma who progressed after previous VEGFR 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment. Progression-free 
survival in the fi
 rst 375 randomised patients, the 
primary endpoint, was signifi
 cantly improved with 
cabozantinib compared with everolimus treatment with 
a median progression-free survival of 7·4 months 
(95% CI 5·6–9·1) versus 3·8 months (3·7–5·4; HR 0·58, 
95% CI 0·45–0·75; p<0·001) as assessed by an 
independent radiology review committee.11
Here we report the fi
 nal overall survival results from 
the METEOR study based on an unplanned second 
interim analysis. Analyses of progression-free survival 
and objective response in all randomised patients, and 
updated safety data are also reported.
Methods
Study design and participants
METEOR is a randomised, open-label, phase 3, study 
with patients enrolled at 173 hospital and outpatient 
clinics in 26 countries (appendix pp 2–5).11 Patients 
18 years or older with advanced or metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma and a clear-cell histology were eligible for 
enrolment if they had measurable disease per Response 
Evaluation 
Criteria 
in 
Solid 
Tumors 
(RECIST 
version 1.1),12 had received at least one previous VEGFR 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (there was no limit to the 
number of previous treatments), and had disease 
progression during or within 6 months of the most 
recent VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment and 
within 6 months before randomisation. Patients were 
required to have a Karnofsky performance status score of 
at least 70% and adequate organ function, based on 
standard laboratory tests including haematology, serum 
chemistry, lipids, coagulation, thyroid function, and 
urinalysis. Patients with brain metastases were allowed 
provided these were stable and asymptomatic. Patients 
with previous mTOR inhibitor therapy, including 
everolimus, were not eligible for the study nor were 
patients with uncontrolled hypertension or clinically 
signifi
 cant 
cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, 
wound 
healing, or infectious comorbidities. The study adhered 
to the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review board 
or ethics committee of the participating centres approved 
the study protocol. All patients provided written 
informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 
either cabozantinib or everolimus. Randomisation was 
stratifi
 ed by the number of previous VEGFR tyrosine-
kinase inhibitor treatments (1 or ≥2) and Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk group (favourable, 
intermediate, or poor) for previously treated patients13 
(appendix p 6). We used stratifi
 ed permuted blocks as the

Research in context
Evidence before this study
In the randomised, phase 3 METEOR trial, treatment with 
cabozantinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including MET, 
VEGFR, and AXL, signifi
 cantly improved progression-free survival 
compared with treatment with everolimus in previously treated 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. In a scientifi
 c 
literature review up to March 10, 2016, we searched PubMed with 
the search terms, phase 3, overall survival, ORR, PFS, RCC, AXL, 
MET, VEGFR, and TKI. None of the currently approved treatments 
had shown signifi
 cant benefi
 t for all three effi
  cacy endpoints of 
overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response in 
a pivotal phase 3 trial in previously treated patients with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma. We also found data suggesting that increased 
expression of MET and AXL are associated with a poor prognosis in 
renal cell carcinoma patients, and that inhibition of these targets 
may help to overcome resistance to VEGF pathway inhibition. 
Added value of this study
Our fi
 ndings show that treatment with cabozantinib was 
associated with a signifi
 cant increase in overall survival, in 
addition to an improvement in progression-free survival and 
objective response, when compared with treatment with 
everolimus, a second-line standard of care in patients with 
second-line advanced renal cell carcinoma. The recorded 
clinical benefi
 ts were consistent in all subgroups. The safety 
profi
 le of cabozantinib was consistent with that previously 
reported.
Implications of all the available evidence
The improvements in progression-free survival, overall 
survival, and objective response suggest that cabozantinib 
should be considered as a new treatment for previously treated 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Recently, the 
immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab also improved overall 
survival compared with everolimus in this population, but 
without improving progression-free survival. Future research 
on the optimal use of cabozantinib and other available 
treatments might help to provide maximum benefi
 t to 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

randomisation schema. Study treatment was assigned 
centrally with an interactive voice and web response 
system. Study personnel did not have access to the master 
list of blocks or block sizes. Patients and investigators 
were not masked to study treatment to allow appropriate 
management of adverse events. Aggregate summaries of 
effi
  cacy data by treatment group were not done until the 
time of the primary progression-free survival analysis.
Procedures
Cabozantinib was given orally once a day at 60 mg and 
everolimus was given orally once a day at 10 mg. 
Everolimus was chosen as the comparator for 
cabozantinib since it is an accepted standard-of-care in 
second-line therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma.1,14 
Treatment modifi
 cations, including interruptions and 
dose reductions, were specifi
 ed to manage adverse 
events. Cabozantinib could be dose reduced to 40 mg and 
then 20 mg, and everolimus could be dose reduced to 
5 mg and then 2·5 mg. Patients were allowed to continue 
study treatment beyond radiographic progression at the 
discretion of the investigator. On-study crossover between 
treatment groups was not permitted. Safety evaluations 
including physical examination, vital signs, laboratory 
tests, and adverse event assessments were done every 
2 weeks for the fi
 rst 8 weeks and then every 4 weeks 
thereafter. ECG assessments were performed every 
4 weeks for the fi
 rst 8 weeks and then every 12 weeks. 
A safety follow-up visit was scheduled 30 days after 
treatment discontinuation. Adverse events were assessed 
by investigators and graded according to Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 
version 4.0).15
Radiographic assessments by CT or MRI were done at 
screening and every 8 weeks for the fi
 rst 12 months and 
then every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumour response and 
progression were assessed according to RECIST 
(version 1.1)12 by a masked centralised independent 
radiology review committee. Patients were followed for 
overall survival every 8 weeks.
Tumour tissue (archival or recently biopsied) was 
obtained at enrolment when available for immuno-
histochemistry analysis of MET protein levels. Formalin-
fi
 xed paraffi
  n embedded tumour blocks or freshly cut 
formalin-fi
 xed paraffi
  n embedded slides were analysed 
by LabCorp (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) with the 
SP44 antibody (Spring Biosciences, Pleasanton, CA, 
USA). MET expression was defi
 ned as high versus low, 
based on a cutoff
  of 50% or higher of tumour tissue 
stained with an intensity of 2+ or 3+ by immuno-
histochemistry, according to published procedures.16,17
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by 
independent radiology review in the fi
 rst 375 randomised 
patients. Progression-free survival was defi
 ned as the 
time from randomisation to radiographic progression 
per RECIST or death from any cause. The secondary 
endpoints were overall survival, defi
 ned as the time 
from randomisation to death from any cause, and 
objective response per independent radiology review 
committee assessment, defi
 ned as the proportion of 
patients with a confi
 rmed complete or partial response 
per RECIST, assessed in all randomly assigned patients. 
Safety and tolerability were also assessed.
Statistical analysis
The study was designed to provide adequate power for 
both progression-free survival and overall survival 
analyses. For the primary endpoint of progression-free 
survival, the event-driven analysis (at the two-sided 5% 
α level) required 259 progression-free survival events. 
The secondary endpoints of overall survival (at the 
two-sided 4% α level) and objective response (at the 
two-sided 1% α level) were to be tested in all randomly 
assigned patients (per the intention-to-treat principle) at 
the time of the primary progression-free survival 
analysis only if the primary progression-free survival 
endpoint was signifi
 cant. For overall survival, assuming 
one interim analysis at the time of the primary endpoint 
analysis and a subsequent fi
 nal analysis, 408 deaths 
were required to provide 80% power to detect a 
hypothesised HR of 0·75 corresponding to an 
improvement in median survival from 15 months18 to 
20 months. With a planned average accrual rate of 
32 patients per month and using a 1:1 treatment 
allocation ratio, 650 patients were required to observe 
408 deaths within the planned study duration of 
36 months. As the total sample size of 650 required to 
evaluate overall survival was much larger than needed to 
assess the primary endpoint of progression-free survival 
there was the possibility that patients with earlier onset 
of radiographic progression would be over-represented 
(and those with later onset of radiographic progression 
under-represented) among the planned 259 progression-
free survival events. To reduce this potential bias, 
the primary analysis of progression-free survival was 
prespecifi
 ed to occur when the required 259 events were 
observed in the fi
 rst 375 randomised patients, the size 
the study would have been without the overall survival 
endpoint. Supportive analyses of progression-free 
survival among all randomly assigned patients were 
also planned.
The planned interim analysis of overall survival (done 
at the time of the primary progression-free survival 
analysis with a data cutoff
  of May 22, 2015; minimum 
follow-up of 6 months) at that time did not meet the 
boundary for signifi
 cance (HR 0·67, 95% CI 0·51–0·89; 
p=0·005; 49% information fraction: critical p value 
≤0·0019) defi
 ned by the Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming 
alpha spending function. The results of the planned 
interim analysis of overall survival were made public in 
July, 2015, and were published in September, 2015.11 
The decision to conduct an unplanned second interim

analysis was made by the funder in consultation with 
regulatory agencies. As a result, the analysis plan was 
revised in October, 2015, to include an unplanned second 
interim analysis of overall survival with a prospectively 
defi
 ned cutoff
  date of Dec 31, 2015, to provide a minimum 
of 13 months of follow-up from the last patient enrolled. 
At this analysis, the critical p value to achieve signifi
 cance 
from the alpha spending function was 0·0163 or lower.
We did hypothesis testing of overall survival and 
progression-free survival with the stratifi
 ed log-rank test 
with the randomisation stratifi
 cation factors. Median 
duration of progression-free survival and overall survival, 
corresponding 95% confi
 dence intervals, and landmark 
proportions were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with a Cox regression 
model adjusted for the randomisation stratifi
 cation 
factors. The proportional hazards assumption was 
evaluated by visual inspection of log-log plots. A post-hoc 
sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival per 
independent radiology review committee among the 
283 patients randomised after the fi
 rst 375 was conducted 
using the same methods as the primary analysis. 
Post-hoc analysis of patients who continued on study 
treatment for at least 2 weeks after radiographic 
progression as determined by the investigator evaluated 
post-progression changes in tumour status by two 
criteria: the proportion with at least one assessment of 
stable disease or partial response (from randomisation) 
after progression; and the proportion with at least one 
assessment in which the sum of target lesion diameters 
was lower than the pre-randomisation baseline value. 
Hypothesis testing for objective response was done with 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel method, and confi
 dence 
intervals for proportions were calculated by the Clopper-
Pearson method. All subgroup analyses of progression-
free survival and overall survival were prespecifi
 ed except 
for the subgroups based on receiving sunitinib or 
pazopanib as the only previous VEGFR tyrosine-kinase 
inhibitor. ECOG performance status was converted from 
Karnofsky status using ECOG 0 for  Karnofsky status of 
100% and 90% as ECOG 1 for Karnofsky status of 80% 
and 70%. Confi
 dence intervals and p values for subgroup 
analyses are considered descriptive. HRs reported for 
subgroup analyses are unadjusted. Safety analyses were 
limited to patients who received any amount of study 
treatment and analysed per protocol. All analyses were 
done with SAS (version 9.1 or higher).

Results
Between Aug 8, 2013, and Nov 24, 2014, 658 patients were 
randomly assigned to receive cabozantinib (n=330) or 
everolimus (n=328; fi
 gure 1). Demographics and baseline 
characteristics were typical of patients with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma and were balanced between 
treatment groups (table 1).11
As of Dec 31, 2015, the cutoff
  for the unplanned second 
interim analysis of overall survival, 74 (22%) of 
330 patients in the cabozantinib group and 25 (8%) of 
328 patients in the everolimus group remained on study 
treatment. The median duration of follow-up for overall 
survival and safety was 18·7 months (IQR 16·1–21·1) in 
the cabozantinib group and 18·8 months (16·0–21·2) in 
the everolimus group. The second interim analysis of 
overall survival included 320 deaths, representing 78% of 
the 408 deaths planned for the prespecifi
 ed fi
 nal analysis 
of overall survival: 140 (42%) patients died in the 
cabozantinib group and 180 (55%) died in the everolimus 
group. Survival status as of the cutoff
  date was determined 
for most (98%) of the 658 randomly assigned patients.
Treatment with cabozantinib signifi
 cantly increased 
overall survival compared with that in patients treated 
with everolimus (fi
 gure 2). The median overall survival 
was 21·4 months (95% CI 18·7–not estimable) in the 
cabozantinib group compared with 16·5 months 
(14·7–18·8) in the everolimus group. The HR was 0·66 
(95% CI 0·53–0·83; p=0·00026), which met the criterion 
for signifi
 cance (p≤0·0163) from the prespecifi
 ed alpha 
spending function. A log-log plot of the survivor 
functions (appendix p 6) had reasonably parallel lines, 
supporting the assumption of proportional hazards.
Kaplan-Meier landmark estimates at 6, 12, 18, and 
24 months showed that at each timepoint the proportion 
of patients estimated to be alive was greater in the 
cabozantinib group compared with the everolimus group 
(appendix p 6). All subgroup analyses of overall survival 
were consistent with the results for the overall population 
(fi
 gure 3). The appendix shows Kaplan-Meier plots of 
overall survival for patients with high and low tumour 
MET expression status (p 7).
The data cutoff
  for progression-free survival and 
objective response analyses in all randomised patients 
was the same as for the primary progression-free survival 
analysis (May 22, 2015) with a median duration of 
follow-up of 11·4 months (IQR 8·8–13·7) in the 
cabozantinib group and 11·5 months (8·6–13·9) in 
the everolimus group.11 180 events occurred in the 
cabozantinib group and 214 in the everolimus group. 
The analysis of progression-free survival per independent 
radiology review done in all 658 randomly assigned 
patients showed improved progression-free survival with

cabozantinib compared with everolimus (HR 0·51 
[95% CI 0·41–0·62]; p<0·0001; fi
 gure 4). The median 
progression-free survival was 7·4 months (95% CI 
6·6–9·1) in the cabozantinib group versus 3·9 months 
(3·7–5·1) in the everolimus group. These results were 
consistent with the previously reported primary endpoint 
of progression-free survival done in the fi
 rst 375 randomly 
assigned patients11 and an additional post-hoc sensitivity 
analysis of progression-free survival per independent 
radiology review done in the 283 patients not included in 
the primary progression-free survival analysis (HR 0·44 
[95% CI 0·31–0·61]). Results for progression-free survival 
per investigator assessment were similar to those 
shown by the independent radiology review committee 
(appendix p 9). Subgroup analyses of progression-free 
survival per independent radiology review were also 
consistent with the results for the overall population 
(fi
 gure 3).
The proportion of patients who achieved an objective 
response per independent radiology review in all 
658 
randomly 
assigned 
patients 
was 
57 
(17% 
[95% CI 13–22]; 57 partial responses) of 330 in the 
cabozantinib group and 11 (3% [2–6]; 11 partial responses) 
of 328 in the everolimus group (p<0·0001; appendix p 9). 
Results for tumour response per investigator assessment 
were similar to those established by the independent 
radiology review committee (appendix p 9).
As of the May 22, 2015, cutoff
  date, the proportions of 
patients continuing study treatment for at least 2 weeks 
after radiographic progression as assessed by the 
investigator were similar between groups, 74 (38%) of 
193 who progressed on cabozantinib and 71 (31%) of 
226 who progressed on everolimus). Post-hoc analyses 
of response for these patients showed that fi
 ve (7%) of 
74 patients in the cabozantinib group and six (8%) of 
71 in the everolimus group had stable disease or a partial 
response after the initial radiographic progression. 
Additionally, 34 (46%) of 74 patients in the cabozantinib 
group and 15 (21%) of 71 in the everolimus group had at 
least one assessment in which the sum of target lesion 
diameters was lower than the pre-randomisation 
baseline value.
As of the Dec 31, 2015, the cutoff
  for the overall 
survival analysis, the median duration of exposure was 
8·3 months (IQR 4·2–14·6) in patients given 
cabozantinib (n=331) and 4·4 months (1·9–8·6) in 
patients given everolimus (n=322). Dose reductions 
occurred for 206 (62%) patients in the cabozantinib 
group and 80 (25%) patients in the everolimus group. 
The median daily dose was 43 mg (IQR 36–56) 
cabozantinib and 9 mg (7–10) everolimus. Treatment 
discontinuation because of an adverse event not related 
to disease progression was recorded in 40 (12%) of 
331 patients in the cabozantinib group and 34 (11%) of 
322 patients in the everolimus group. The most frequent 
reason for treatment discontinuation in both groups 
was disease progression (fi
 gure 1). Similar proportions 
of patients in the everolimus group and the cabozantinib 
group were reported to have received subsequent 
systemic anticancer treatment after study treatment 
discontinuation (181 [55%] vs 165 [50%]; appendix p 8).
The overall incidence of adverse events irrespective 
of causality was 100% for both groups (331 of 
331 patients treated with cabozantinib and 321 of 
322 treated with everolimus). We recorded grade 3 or 4 
adverse events in 235 (71%) patients treated with 
cabozantinib and 193 (60%) treated with everolimus 
(table 2; appendix pp 10–15). The most common grade 
3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (49 [15%] in 
the cabozantinib group vs 12 [4%] in the everolimus 
group), diarrhoea (43 [13%] vs 7 [2%]), fatigue (36 [11%] 
vs 24 [7%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syn-
drome (27 [8%] vs 3 [1%]), anaemia (19 [6%] vs 53 [17%]), 
hyperglycaemia (3 [1%] vs 16 [5%]), and hypo-
magnesaemia (16 [5%] vs none).
Grade 3 or worse serious adverse events occurred in 
130 (39%) patients in the cabozantinib group and in 
129 (40%) in the everolimus group. The most common 
grade 3 or worse serious adverse events were abdominal 
pain (nine [3%] in the cabozantinib group vs three [1%] 
in the everolimus group), pleural eff
 usion (eight [2%] vs 
seven [2%]), pneumonia (seven [2%] vs 13 [4%]), 
pulmonary embolism (seven [2%] vs one [<1%], anaemia 
(fi
 ve [2%] vs 10 [3%]), and dyspnoea (four [1%] vs 10 [3%]). 
Deaths during the adverse events reporting period, 
irrespective of causality, occurred in 26 patients (8%) in 
the cabozantinib group and 25 (8%) in the everolimus 
group; most of these were related to disease progression

(appendix p 10). One death was assessed as treatment 
related in the cabozantinib group (death; not otherwise 
specifi
 ed) and two were assessed as treatment-related in 
the everolimus group (one aspergillus infection and one 
pneumonia aspiration).
Discussion
Our fi
 ndings showed a signifi
 cant overall survival benefi
 t 
for cabozantinib treatment compared with everolimus 
treatment in patients with previously treated advanced 
renal cell carcinoma. Progression-free survival was also 
signifi
 cantly improved in the cabozantinib group versus 
the everolimus group and we recorded a higher 
proportion of patients with an objective response in the 
cabozantinib group compared with the everolimus 
group. The progression-free survival results in all 
randomly assigned patients were consistent with the 
results previously reported for the fi
 rst 375 randomly 
assigned patients (the primary endpoint of the study).11 
Objective tumour response per independent radiology 
review was also consistent with the previously reported 
results for the fi
 rst 375 randomly assigned patients.
The updated safety profi
 le of cabozantinib was similar 
to that previously reported at the earlier data cutoff
  for 
this study.11 The most common adverse events were 
typical of those recorded with other VEGFR tyrosine-
kinase inhibitors in patients with renal cell carcinoma.19 
The adverse event profi
 le for everolimus was similar to 
that reported in other renal cell carcinoma studies.20 
Adverse events were managed with dose modifi
 cations 
and supportive care in both treatment groups. Although 
the frequency of dose reductions was higher in the 
cabozantinib group, the number of treatment discon-
tinuations due to adverse events was similar in both 
groups, suggesting that dose modifi
 cations were eff
 ective 
in minimising or preventing treatment-associated 
discontinuations.
The results for overall survival and progression-free 
survival in all subgroups were consistent with those for 
the overall population, including those defi
 ned by the 
prespecifi
 ed stratifi
 cation factors (MSKCC risk group and 
number of previous VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors). 
The most common previous treatments were sunitinib 
and pazopanib, consistent with standard clinical practice.1 
Outcomes for patients refractory to fi
 rst-line VEGFR 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment are not available 
because this information was not collected. The eff
 ects of 
cabozantinib on overall survival and progression-free 
survival in patients with bone metastases, which are 
associated with a poor prognosis,21 are consistent with 
reported eff
 ects of cabozantinib on bone metastases in 
both clinical and preclinical studies,22,23 and warrant 
further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the 
activity of cabozantinib in bone.
The proportions of patients continuing study treatment 
for at least 2 weeks after radiographic progression were 
similar between groups. The proportions of patients who 
received subsequent anticancer treatment after study 
treatment discontinuation were also similar between the 
treatment groups. Therefore, these factors are unlikely to 
have biased the results of overall survival towards one 
treatment group. Additionally, treatment crossover was 
not allowed after determination of the primary endpoint 
of progression-free survival, enabling robust assessment 
of overall survival.
Although the study used an open-label design, bias was 
minimised for the primary endpoint of progression-free 
survival and secondary endpoint of objective response by 
evaluation of radiographic assessments by a masked 
central 
independent 
radiology 
review 
committee. 
Additionally, radiographic assessments were continued 
beyond investigator-determined progression to reduce 
missing data arising from discordance between the 
investigator and the independent radiology review 
committee about the date of progression. An advantage 
of open-label design is appropriate management of 
adverse eff
 ects in both study groups.
High MET expression in patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma has been associated with both a poor 
prognosis and prior exposure to VEGFR tyrosine-kinase 
inhibitors, and in preclinical models is associated 
with resistance to VEGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor 
treatment.5,8,9,24 Therefore, because cabozantinib targets 
receptor tyrosine kinases including MET, we investigated 
MET expression by immunohistochemistry as a 
potentially predictive biomarker for cabozantinib in this 
study population. However, the results suggest that the 
MET expression level might not aff
 ect treatment

outcomes with cabozantinib in this patient population, 
which might refl
 ect the broader target profi
 le of 
cabozantinib. A limitation of this analysis was that 
archival tumour tissue was used in most cases rather 
than a fresh biopsy obtained before study treatment 
initiation, which could have resulted in MET expression 
values that were not contemporaneous with the disease 
state during study treatment. Additionally, about one 
third of randomly assigned patients had an unknown 
MET status because archival tumour tissue was 
not available.
Our results support the hypothesis that the target 
profi
 le of cabozantinib, which inhibits MET and AXL in 
addition to VEGF receptors, might help to overcome 
resistance to VEGFR inhibition.5–10 This view is supported 
by the low incidence of refractory disease recorded, with 
only 12% of patients experiencing progressive disease as a 
best response with cabozantinib treatment. Furthermore, 
the eff
 ects of cabozantinib were consistently noted 
irrespective of the duration of the fi
 rst previous VEGFR 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment. The results also 
suggest that sequenced VEGFR inhibition can be 
benefi
 cial for the treatment of advanced renal cell 
carcinoma, which has also been suggested by the report 
of a phase 2 study with levantinib.25 Additional studies are 
necessary to clearly defi
 ne the roles of MET, AXL, and 
other targets beyond VEGFR in the clinical activity 
recorded with cabozantinib in patients with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma. Future studies could also include 
more detailed assessment of response to fi
 rst-line therapy 
and tumour biopsies at the time of progression to better 
defi
 ne the mechanisms of resistance and the possible 
benefi
 ts of sequenced VEGFR inhibition.
Several 
VEGFR 
tyrosine-kinase 
inhibitors 
have 
previously been approved for the treatment of metastatic 
renal cell carcinoma, and these comprise the mainstay of 
present day treatment. Regulatory approval for each of 
these (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and axitinib) was 
based on an improvement in progression-free survival 
over control groups of cytokine (interferon), placebo, or 
sorafenib in a randomised phase 3 trial.26–29 The mTOR 
inhibitor everolimus, which was used as the comparator 
arm in this study, was also approved based on improved 
progression-free survival when compared to placebo.30 
None of the pivotal phase 3 trials for these previously 
approved agents showed a signifi
 cant benefi
 t in overall 
survival. Improvement in overall survival remains the 
gold standard as an endpoint for representing clinical 
benefi
 t in patients. It is therefore notable that in this 
study cabozantinib treatment resulted in a benefi
 t in 
overall survival in addition to improved progression-free 
survival and objective response compared with everolimus 
in patients who had progressed on standard VEGFR 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatments. The diff
 erence in 
overall survival between cabozantinib and everolimus 
highlights the clinical activity of cabozantinib in advanced 
renal cell carcinoma.

Adverse events that were reported as grade 1–2 in at least 10% of the patients in either study group are shown, 
irrespective of whether the event was considered by the investigator to be related to the study treatment. All grade 3, 
4, and 5 events are listed in the appendix (p 10). One treatment-related death occurred in the cabozantinib group 
(death; not otherwise specifi
 ed) and two occurred in the everolimus group (one aspergillus infection and one 
pneumonia aspiration). Patients are counted once at the highest grade for each preferred term. The severity of adverse 
events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(version 4.0).

The immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab has 
been shown to have an overall survival benefi
 t with 
an improved objective response compared with 
everolimus after previous antiangiogenic treatment for 
renal cell carcinoma, but no progression-free survival 
benefi
 t was recorded.3 The HR for overall survival in 
the nivolumab study was similar to the HR with 
cabozantinib in this study (0·73 vs 0·66, both compared 
with everolimus); however, the median overall survival 
of the everolimus group diff
 ered (19·6 months in the 
nivolumab study and 16·5 months in this study), 
refl
 ecting the challenges of cross-trial comparison. 
The limits of publicly available data make it diffi
  cult to 
identify any factors to explain the diff
 erence in overall 
survival in the control groups of the two studies. The 
recorded median overall survival for patients treated 
with everolimus in our study was consistent with that 
reported in the pivotal RECORD-1 study (14·8 months).20
In this randomised phase 3 study, treatment with 
cabozantinib was associated with clinically signifi
 cant 
improvements in overall survival, progression-free 
survival, and objective response compared with treatment 
with everolimus, a standard of care in second-line 
advanced renal cell carcinoma. The observed clinical 
activity of cabozantinib was applicable to patients in all 
risk categories and irrespective of previous treatments 
and the extent of tumour burden. Based on these results, 
cabozantinib should be considered a new treatment 
option for previously treated patients with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma.
