Insidious declines in normal aging are well-established. Emerging evidence suggests
that non-pharmacological interventions, specifically cognitive and physical training, may
counter diminishing age-related cognitive and brain functions. This randomized trial
compared effects of two training protocols: cognitive training (CT) vs. physical training
(PT) on cognition and brain function in adults 56–75 years. Sedentary participants
(N = 36) were randomized to either CT or PT group for 3 h/week over 12 weeks.
They were assessed at baseline-, mid-, and post-training using neurocognitive, MRI,
and physiological measures. The CT group improved on executive function whereas
PT group’s memory was enhanced. Uniquely deploying cerebral blood flow (CBF) and
cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR) MRI, the CT cohort showed increased CBF within
the prefrontal and middle/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) without change to CVR
compared to PT group. Improvements in complex abstraction were positively associated
with increased resting CBF in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Exercisers with
higher CBF in hippocampi bilaterally showed better immediate memory. The preliminary
evidence indicates that increased cognitive and physical activity improves brain health
in distinct ways. Reasoning training enhanced frontal networks shown to be integral
to top-down cognitive control and brain resilience. Evidence of increased resting CBF
without changes to CVR implicates increased neural health rather than improved
vascular response. Exercise did not improve cerebrovascular response, although CBF
increased in hippocampi of those with memory gains. Distinct benefits incentivize testing
effectiveness of combined protocols to strengthen brain health.

Distinct Benefits of Cognitive vs. Physical Training
INTRODUCTION
Life expectancy has increased steadily over the past century; but
the downside of longer life is fear of losing the mental capability
to sustain independent living. Adults are more worried about
cognitive health than cancer or heart health for the first time ever
(IOM Report, 2015). Whereas, many fear Alzheimer’s disease, an
estimated 87% of adults will not be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
disease (Wagster et al., 2012). Nonetheless, many normally aging
adults without dementia manifest continuous and significant
cognitive losses. These cognitive losses are most frequently
identified in domains of executive function/cognitive control and
memory (Cepeda et al., 2001; Mahncke et al., 2006a; Levine et al.,
2007). Executive function refers to the ability to flexibly select and
inhibit information; to maintain, update, and abstract meanings;
and to fluidly innovate ideas, while at the same time maintaining
an active goal in mind (Levine et al., 2007; Badre, 2008; Vas
et al., 2015). Executive functions support real life activities that
allow humans to orchestrate the complexities of daily tasks
and responsibilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, flexible
thinking, generalizing rules, planning, and decision-making,
among others (Anguera et al., 2013). With regard to memory
function, older adults consistently perform lower than younger
individuals and the gap widens with advancing age (Salthouse,
1994).
In parallel with cognitive control and memory losses, a
growing body of work identifies degradation of structural
and functional aspects of brain systems with age (Raz et al.,
1997; Kennedy and Raz, 2009; Lu et al., 2011). Age-related
brain changes are prominently found in prefrontal and
temporal/hippocampal brain regions. The prefrontal cortex
(PFC) and its complex networks play a pivotal role in higher-
order executive functions (D’Esposito and Chen, 2006; Badre,
2008). The hippocampal regions, part of the medial temporal
lobes, have been shown to support memory (Rodrigue et al.,
2013). Taken together, evidence reveals that the normally aging
brain may represent a developmental model of failing frontal
networks, diminishing executive function systems, and declining
memory (D’Esposito and Chen, 2006). Fortunately, the insidious
cognitive decline documented in normal aging appears to be
modifiable and even reversible to some extent (Greenwood
and Parasuraman, 2010). The aging brain’s retained capacity to
show dynamic functional and beneficial changes in response
to training is being demonstrated through employing emerging
brain imaging methodologies and analytics (Colcombe et al.,
2004; D’Esposito and Chen, 2006; Greenwood and Parasuraman,
2010; IOM Report, 2015). Thus, integrating outcome data from
both brain and cognitive measures will help elucidate the efficacy
of non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive and
physical training protocols (Erickson et al., 2011; Takeuchi et al.,
2013; Chapman et al., 2015).
The potential benefits of a wide array of cognitive training and
exercise protocols are being tested. Cognitive training protocols
that entail strategy-use, reasoning, or multi-domain approaches
have shown to induce broad-based, generalized, and more lasting
gains in older healthy adults than achieved by training of specific
cognitive processes, such as memory (Ball and Birge, 2002;
Chapman and Mudar, 2014; McDaniel et al., 2014; Strenziok
et al., 2014). Evidence for age-related benefits from cognitive
training protocols have been identified from short-term advanced
reasoning training as reflected in the SMART protocol (Anand
et al., 2011; Chapman and Mudar, 2014; Chapman et al., 2015),
non-verbal reasoning arm of the ACTIVE trial (Rebok et al.,
2014), strategic goal setting in Goal Management Training
(Levine et al., 2007; Karbach and Kray, 2009), multi-domain
computer training (Shatil, 2013), and Posit Science’s computer
training program (Mahncke et al., 2006a,b; Strenziok et al., 2014).
Strategy-based cognitive training protocols, such as SMART
(Chapman et al., 2015) and Goal Management Training (Levine
et al., 2000; D’Esposito and Chen, 2006), have shown to induce
broader transfer of benefits on measures such as abstraction,
working memory, verbal reasoning, and inhibition, as well as
reducing depressive symptoms and improving real life function
compared to training of specific cognitive processes (Anand et al.,
2011; Barnes et al., 2013; Chapman and Mudar, 2014; Vas et al.,
2015). With regard to exercise regimens, the evidence supports
the intuitive view that any exercise program is better than none
(IOM Report, 2015). Nonetheless, considerable evidence suggests
that programs involving aerobic exercise (Kramer et al., 1999;
Colcombe et al., 2004; Chapman et al., 2013) as compared with
non-aerobic exercise such as stretching and toning (Aberg et al.,
2009) may be associated with greater benefits especially observed
to improve executive and memory functions.
A handful of studies have examined the cognitive benefits of
physical vs. cognitive training (Oswald et al., 2006; Shatil, 2013).
In a carefully controlled, four-condition randomized trial in
healthy older adults ranging in age from 65 to 93 years, Shatil and
colleagues reported findings implicating a selective benefit of a
multi-domain cognitive training program called CogniFit (Shatil,
2013) as compared to physical training (mild aerobic training)
and an active control group (discussing a specific book) delivered
in 32 h over a 4-month period. Cognitive training alone and
combined cognitive/physical training improved performance on
a broad array of cognitive measures in healthy older adults.
In contrast, no significant gains were observed on any of the
cognitive tasks in the mild aerobic training group alone or the
active control group (Shatil, 2013). Their findings suggested
that enhancement of mental performance necessitated cognitive
training as a pivotal element to achieve gains since no significant
cognitive gains emanated from aerobic training alone. Otherwise,
they offered that cognitive gains from physical exercise may
only be realizable after longer exercise training intervals, such
as 1 year of training. In another study of normally aging
adults 75–93 years, only combined cognitive (i.e., speed of
information processing, memory, storage, retrieval, attention)
and physical training (i.e., targeting balance, flexibility, and
motor coordination) showed cognitive benefits (Oswald et al.,
2006). The combined training had more lasting benefits than
separate physical or cognitive training alone. The proposed
interpretation was that the physical training may have improved
the metabolic activity of the brain, but the gain was only
realized by enrichment of cognitive training that exploited the
neural demand through challenging cognitive tasks. Therefore,
there remains a gap in our basic understanding of the unique

Distinct Benefits of Cognitive vs. Physical Training
contributions of each training to cognition and brain function. In
this study, we aimed to elucidate distinct benefits of each training
before exploring the benefits of combined trainings.
Both the Shatil and Oswald studies provided key insights into
benefits of cognitive and physical exercise training with results
that could be further informed by subsequent inclusion of brain
function measures such as cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral
vascular reactivity (CVR). Emerging evidence suggests that
functional brain changes measured by CBF and CVR occur more
rapidly and frequently than structural changes (Bruel-Jungerman
et al., 2007). CBF is an important physiological parameter that is
responsible for energy homeostasis of the brain. Due to neuronal
tissue’s high metabolic demand, a tight regulation between CBF
and neuronal activity is required (Raichle and Gusnard, 2002).
Under normal physiological conditions, the total brain blood
flow is constant, partly due to large feeding arteries. However,
in case of high metabolic demand, the amount of blood flow is
increased with vasodilation of blood vessels (Leithner and Royl,
2014). The ability of the blood vessels to vasodilate is called
CVR and is an important marker for brain vascular function and
reserve. One way to induce a CVR response is by exposing the
brain to CO2 (Yezhuvath et al., 2009). Previous research suggests
that global CBF and CVR decline with increasing age and the
changes most notably affect the frontal lobes (Lu et al., 2011).
Combining CBF with CVR parameters provides a way to assess
changes in different aspects of brain health, i.e., improvements
related to either vascular and/or neuronal health.
Researchers have started exploring functional brain changes
in response to shorter interventions such as aerobic exercise
and cognitive training. Smith and colleagues found that global
CBF increased by 20% following exercise as well as motor cortex
CBF during a finger tapping experiment (Smith et al., 2010).
MacIntosh and colleagues assessed the resting brain perfusion
at 10 and 40 min after a single bout of exercise and found
that the resting CBF of bilateral hippocampi decreased at both
intervals (MacIntosh et al., 2012). Additionally, we previously
showed that the resting CBF of bilateral anterior cingulate cortex
increased after 12 weeks of exercise training compared to a wait-
list control group (Chapman et al., 2013). In terms of cognitive
training programs, a 4 week working memory training was shown
to increase the resting regional CBF of the right lateral PFC
(Takeuchi et al., 2013). In our previous work, we found that
changes to resting CBF preceded changes to structural white
matter changes (Chapman et al., 2015). Despite these positive
reports, the existing evidence does not allow us to glean a direct
comparison of neural benefits from cognitive vs. physical training
in a comparable group employing CBF and CVR measures.
The ability to measure CVR relatively safely has only recently
been developed; therefore, no known study has investigated CVR
changes in response to cognitive and aerobic interventions.
The present study directly compared the effects of cognitive
vs. physical training on cognitive performance and the resting
state CBF and CVR measurements in a relatively short period
of time, i.e., 12 weeks. In our previous work, we found global
CBF change to be an informative marker of improved cognitive
brain health in normally aging adults in response to advanced
reasoning training when compared to a control group (Chapman
et al., 2015). In a comparison study of aerobic exercise vs.
control group study, we found regional blood flow changes but
not a global change. The current study expands on this prior
foundational work by incorporating vascular and perfusion based
MR techniques to help elucidate the distinct impact of cognitive
vs. physical training on the brain and behavior.
Thus, this study explored a direct comparison of two non-
pharmacological training protocols (i.e. cognitive training vs.
physical training) by showing their effects on behavior and
brain. Specifically, we explored the potential to enhance executive
function and memory in normally aging adults and investigated
their impact on brain function using resting state CBF and CVR
measures. We postulated that the complex reasoning training
would increase global CBF due to the known tight coupling
of the neurovascular system induced by cognitive stimulation.
In contrast, aerobic training was predicted to improve vascular
health in the brain as measured by the brain’s vascular response
to CO2. The aim was to advance our understanding of the
distinct contribution of cognitive vs. exercise stimulation to
neural, cerebrovascular, and cognitive health.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The study was approved by the ethical review board of the
Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, University of
Texas at Dallas and The Cooper Institute. All participants
provided written informed consent before participating in the
study. Participants (n = 137) were recruited from a database at
The Cooper Institute, through flyers/advertisements placed in
local newspapers and magazines, and our institutions’ websites.
Participants were included if their self-reported physical activity
was described as participating in aerobic physical activity less
than or equal to twice a week for 20 min for at least the preceding
3 months. This history was ascertained in the initial phone screen
by The Cooper Institute and confirmed during the phone screen
by the Center for BrainHealth, given the unreliable nature of self-
reported physical activity. All levels of physical activity below this
cut-point were considered for enrollment including those who
were physically inactive.
All participants underwent the Telephone Interview of
Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M) to screen for dementia (de
Jager et al., 2003), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
to screen for cognitive impairment (Nasreddine et al., 2005),
the Beck Depression Inventory 2nd edition (BDI-II) to screen
for depressive symptoms (Beck and Brown, 1996), and complete
medical, physical, and laboratory assessments by a physician
to ensure good general health. The criteria for inclusion were
no history of neurological or psychiatric conditions, normal
IQ range, native English speakers, and minimum of high
school diploma. Exclusionary criteria included: MR scanning
contraindications, cognitive status (TICS-M < 28 and MoCA
< 26), depression indication (BDI > 14), left-handedness, body
mass (BMI > 40,
mass(kg)
height(m)2 ). The participant’s BMI was limited to
40 to ensure participants’ bodies and heads fit in the scanner and
the head coil.

Distinct Benefits of Cognitive vs. Physical Training
After passing the initial phone screens, individuals were
further evaluated at The Cooper Institute for any medical
history including medications and physical activity history and
a physical examination including blood pressure, height/weight,
BMI, and waist circumference. At this point, the participants
underwent graded exercise stress testing to evaluate for
obstructive coronary artery disease or other findings that would
represent contraindications to exercise and for measurement
of the cardiorespiratory fitness level (VO2 Max). VO2 Max
is a measure of maximum capacity of the body to use and
transport oxygen. Participants were tested utilizing a Lode—
Excalibur Sport cycle ergometer, (Groningen, Netherlands)
and a Jaeger Oxycon Pro, (Hoechberg, Germany), to assess
VO2 Max and exercise electrocardiogram. Maximum effort
was strongly encouraged during the testing and all included
participants had reached at least 85% of their maximum predicted
heart rate to ensure that evaluation for ischemic findings
was clinically acceptable. Blood pressure and ECG responses
to exercise were monitored and ratings of perceived exertion
(RPE) were obtained using the Borg scale: 6 (no exertion)
to 20 (extremely difficult). Further exclusion criteria included
abnormal electrocardiographic response, significant hypertensive
blood pressure response to exercise, inability to reach 85%
of maximum predicted heart rate for age or not completing
maximal exercise effort/test.
Participants who met the above inclusion criteria (n = 67)
were randomized using a block randomization schedule stratified
by gender (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT# 00977418) into one of three
groups: cognitive training (n = 25), physical training (n = 21), or
wait-listed control (n = 21) group. However, seven participants
in cognitive training, three participants in physical training and
two participants in control groups declined to participate in
the study. Thus, the final participant numbers were: cognitive
training (CT, n = 18), physical training (PT, n = 18), and control
(CN, n = 19), see Figure S1. The present study included 36
cognitively normal adults (mean age = 63.5 ± 3.8; 56–75 years of
age) who completed the cognitive or physical training programs.
Participants were not compensated for their involvement in this
study. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects
in accordance with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of
our academic institutions: The University of Texas at Dallas,
The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and The
Cooper Institute.
Training Protocols
Both the Cognitive and Physical training programs were
administered three times per week over 12 weeks at the Center for
BrainHealth and The Cooper Institute, respectively. Participants
were required to attend at least 90% of the training, missing no
more than 3 of the 36 sessions. The trainers for both arms were
unaware of study hypotheses but encouraged the participants to
exercise and apply the cognitive training strategies outside of the
training sessions.
Cognitive Training Program
The cognitive training was led by a clinician who had
previously completed a three-stage training process prior to
study implementation consisting of reading about the program,
observing a trained clinician, and leading training sessions
under supervision to insure treatment fidelity. Cognitive training
occurred 1 h per week in small groups (n ≤ 5) with two
1-h unsupervised individual work sessions where individuals
completed pencil and paper homework assignments on their own
at home (i.e., supervised training = 12 h, individual unsupervised
work = 24 h). During these “solo” sessions, individuals were
given assignments to practice the core strategies as described in
the next section. Participants’ independent work was reviewed
by the trainer prior to the next group training session and
discussed at group meetings. No separate contact was held
between sessions. Record logs of time and assignment completion
were kept for the individual work.
The cognitive training group underwent an evidenced-based,
manualized cognitive training program referred to as Strategic
Memory Advanced Reasoning Training or SMART (Chapman
and Mudar, 2014; Chapman et al., 2015). The SMART program
trains metacognitive strategies to improve top-down thinking
using three core cognitive control functions of strategic attention,
integrative reasoning, and innovation. The training is strategy-
based rather than content specific and provides practical ways
to employ the strategies in real life contexts. Strategic Attention
focuses on strategies to prepare the brain to efficiently manage
time and cognitive resources by prioritizing goal setting to the
top two tasks each day, intentionally single-tasking, blocking
distractions and inhibiting irrelevant input, and building in
regular mental breaks. Integrative Reasoning teaches individuals
to synthesize information at deeper levels of interpretation
by abstracting the essence or extracting key goals for tasks.
Strategies to build Integrative Reasoning exert cognitive control
to “zoom in” to the details or steps to a goal, then rapidly
“zoom out” to synthesize, and abstract big picture ideas/goals,
followed by “zooming deep and wide” to construct generalized
application of derived ideas, interpretations, or goals-completed.
The top-down processes facilitated by Innovative Strategies
encourage fluid and flexible thinking, perspective-taking and
problem solving. SMART trains individuals to (1) approach
a task with a brain-set ready to think deeply, (2) continually
synthesize meanings from data encountered in everyday life (e.g.,
medical information, investment information, movies, lectures,
newspaper articles, travel highlights), and (3) practice innovative
thinking by generating diverse interpretations, perspectives,
and solutions to daily work or leisure activities. For example,
imagine listening to your doctor’s advice about a new condition
you have just been diagnosed where the possible choices are
overwhelming. Individuals are trained to (a) strategically inhibit
taking in excessive, often poorly vetted information from the
web, focusing on their top two concerns; then (b) use integrative
reasoning by “zooming in” to the most concerning aspects of
the disease, then, “zooming out” to abstract life and health
priorities, and next “zooming deep and wide” to consider life
impact by acting on or rejecting doctor’s recommendations,
and finally (c) employ innovation strategy to evaluate pros and
cons of treatment options and engage family and trusted friends
advice to weigh different perspectives or options. Another brief
example is after seeing a movie, discuss it with friends where

Distinct Benefits of Cognitive vs. Physical Training
instead of downloading the entire story (strategic attention);
abstract key themes and take home messages applied to your
own life context (integrated reasoning) and generate diverse
perspectives representing a plethora of possibilities (innovation).
Participants were encouraged to incorporate these three core
cognitive processes as often as possible within the context of their
own life activities and goals (Chapman and Mudar, 2014).
Physical Training Program
The physical training program was designed in an effort
to ensure the participants met the 2008 physical activity
guidelines of 150 min per week, as recommended for all
adults (http://health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter4.aspx).
The exercise prescription was developed based on the study
intervention and the heart rate obtained at VO2 max of 50–75%.
Three physical exercise sessions of 60 min were done per week.
Each session involved 5 min of warm up, 50 min of aerobic
exercise, and 5 min of cool down. The training regimen alternated
weekly between working out 2 days on an exercise bike, one on
a treadmill and vice versa. The warm up consisted of walking on
treadmill at a speed of 2–2.4 mph or cycling at 43 Watts for 5 min.
The workout consisted of walking on treadmill or stationary
cycling for 50 min at a speed determined to be 50–75% of VO2
Max. The cool down consisted of walking on treadmill at a speed
of 2–2.4 mph or cycling at 43 Watts for 5 min. Every physical
training session occurred individually under the supervision of
trained personnel with experience in controlled exercise training
trials to ensure adherence and safety. Natural occurring social
interactions occurred between the trainer and the participant
during the training. The participants were monitored at 5 min
intervals throughout their exercise session to ensure that they
attained and maintained at least 50% of the maximum heart
rate seen with VO2 max. In addition to heart rate, RPE was
assessed every 5 min. As the participants were otherwise healthy
and functional, they were encouraged to complete the exercise
sessions and work toward increasing intensity throughout the
study.
All
participants
were
able
to
adhere
to
the
exercise
prescription since they were initially screened to complete 1 h of
physical training without breaks. Participants were encouraged to
exercise as frequently as possible outside of the training sessions
so they could begin to increase physical activity in real life. A
physician was also present onsite in case of emergencies.
Neurocognitive Measures
A battery of neurocognitive measures was administered on a
non-training day at three time periods, i.e., baseline/pre-training
(T1), mid-training week 6 (T2), and at end of training, week
12 (T3) for cognitive and physical training groups. Cognitive
assessment measures were completed in individual, face-to-face
testing sessions. All test batteries were pencil and paper measures
administered by trained individuals who were masked to training
group membership. Furthermore, participants were instructed
not to share any information about their group membership to
their examiners.
Assessment of near transfer effects of training included
three randomized versions of the Test of Strategic Learning
(TOSL) to measure the ability to synthesize abstract meanings
from complex input. Measurements of far transfer effects
included tests of executive function, memory, and complex
attention. Measures of executive function included: Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd edition (WAIS-III) Similarities
(concept abstraction; Wechsler, 1997), Daneman Carpenter
(working memory; Daneman and Carpenter, 1980), Delis-
Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting Test
(Delis et al., 2001), Controlled Oral Word Association Test
(COWAT) category total (semantic verbal fluency) and letter
total (phonemic verbal fluency; Lezak et al., 2004), and Trails B
(switching; Tombaugh, 2004). Immediate memory was assessed
with trial one of the California Verbal Learning Test 2nd
edition (CVLT II; two versions used alternatively over time
intervals), and immediate and delayed memory was assessed
with the Wechsler Memory Scale 2nd edition (WMS-II) Logical
Memory subtest. The results are one-tailed due to anticipated
improvements in the neurocognitive and physiological measures
of each training group.
Physiological Measures
Physiological markers were assessed and documented at The
Cooper Institute at three time points on a non-training day:
baseline/pre-training (T1), mid-training, week 6 (T2), and upon
completion of the training, week 12 (T3). The physiological
parameters included: weight (kg), heart rate (beats per min or
bpm), VO2 Max (ml/kg/min), and RPE scale. The RPE was
assessed based on Borg’s Scale: 6 (no exertion) to 20 (extremely
difficult). The RPE was included to serve two purposes in our
study: to get a subject exertion measure from participants and to
regulate their exercise activity (increasing the heart rate from 50
to 75%).
MRI Experiment
MRI investigations were performed on a 3 Tesla MR system
(Philips Medical System, Best, Netherlands). A body coil was
used for radiofrequency (RF) transmission and an 8-channel
head coil with parallel imaging capability was used for signal
reception. The MRI scans of participants were performed at
rest with their eyes open and on a non-training day. We used
pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) sequence to
measure CBF at rest (Aslan et al., 2010). CVR measurements were
carried out using a BOLD MR sequence. The subjects alternated
breathing room air and 5% CO2 for 1 min each for a total of
7 min (Yezhuvath et al., 2009). Additionally, a high resolution
T1 weighted image was acquired as an anatomical reference. The
details of imaging parameters and their processing techniques are
provided below.
Imaging parameters for pCASL experiments were: single-shot
gradient-echo EPI, field-of-view (FOV) = 240 × 240, matrix =
80 × 80, voxel size = 3 × 3 mm2, 27 slices acquired in ascending
order, slice thickness = 5 mm, no gap between slices, labeling
duration = 1650 ms, time interval between consecutive slice
acquisitions = 35.5 ms, TR/TE = 4020/14 ms, SENSE factor
2.5, number of controls/labels = 30 pairs, RF duration = 0.5 ms,
pause between RF pulses = 0.5 ms, labeling pulse flip angle =
18◦, bandwidth = 2.7 kHz, echo train length = 35, and scan

duration 4.5 min. The hypercapnia BOLD imaging parameters
were: single shot gradient echo EPI sequence, TR/TE/flip = 2000
ms/25 ms/80◦, 43 axial slices, slice thickness = 3.5 mm, FOV =
220 × 220 mm2, matrix size = 64 × 64, and scan duration =
7 min. Hypercapnia was administered using a Douglas bag with
a two-way valve to switch between 1 min blocks of 5% CO2-
breathing (mixed with 21% O2 and 74% N2) and air-breathing.
Physiologic parameters, including end-tidal (Et) CO2, breathing
rate, heart rate, and arterial oxygenation (sO2), were recorded
during the scan (MEDRAD, Pittsburgh, PA and Novametrix
Medical Systems, Wallingford, CT). The high resolution T1
weighted image parameters were: Magnetization Prepared Rapid
Acquisition of Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence, TR/TE
= 8.3/3.8 ms, shot interval = 2100 ms, inversion time =
1100 ms, flip angle = 12◦, 160 sagittal slices, voxel size =
1 × 1 × 1 mm3, FOV = 256 × 256 × 160 mm3, and
duration 4 min.
The pCASL MRI data underwent routine processing (Aslan
et al., 2010). PCASL image series were realigned to the
first volume for motion correction (SPM5’s realign function,
University College London, UK). All datasets were within the
applied motion threshold of 3 mm translation and 3◦ rotation. An
in-house MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) program was used
to calculate the difference between averaged control and label
images. Then, the difference image was corrected for imaging
slice delay time to yield CBF-weight image, which was normalized
to the Brain template from Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI). This procedure was carried out using a non-linear
elastic registration algorithm, Hierarchical Attribute Matching
Mechanism for Elastic Registration (HAMMER, University
of Pennsylvania, PA). The HAMMER algorithm detects and
corrects for region-specific brain atrophy which is commonly
seen in elderly subjects. Last, the absolute CBF was estimated
in the units of mL blood/min/100 g of brain tissue (Aslan
et al., 2010). The absolute whole brain blood flow values were
calculated by averaging all the voxels in the absolute CBF (aCBF)
map. In the ROI analysis, the hippocampal and parahippocampal
regions were defined and combined by automated anatomical
labeling (AAL) parcellation template in SPM (Tzourio-Mazoyer
et al., 2002). In voxel based analyses (VBA), the individual aCBF
maps were spatially smoothed [with full-width half-maximum
(FWHM) of 4 mm] to account for small differences in sulci/gyri
location across subjects. For subject-level CVR, we followed
protocols established previously (Yezhuvath et al., 2012). Briefly,
we used EtCO2 trace (synchronized with the MRI acquisitions)
as a regressor on the BOLD time series to obtain CVR, measured
as % BOLD signal change/mmHg EtCO2 change. Similar to
the CBF maps, HAMMER software was used to normalize
the CVR maps to MNI template space for the group level
analysis.
Statistical Analysis
At the group level, a general statistical linear model was applied
to assess the contribution of cognitive and physical training
on neurocognitive measures and CBF. The model included
sessions (T1, T2, and T3), group status (cognitive training and
physical training) and the interaction between these factors. Two
variance components—one due to variability across subjects,
and one due to variability in the same subject over time—
were included to account for the different levels of variability
and estimated by residual maximum likelihood (REML). We
were primarily interested in how the groups differed across the
training sessions. We hypothesized that the cognitive training
group would show an increase in mean of behavioral measures
(except “Trails B”; since it is a timed measure and lower
score represents faster performance), either by T2 or T3,
relative to the physical training group. On the other hand, we
hypothesized that the physical training group would show an
increase in VO2 Max and a decrease in RPE measurement
since individuals may perceive less effort in physical training
as they adjust to exercise regimen. This hypothesis led to
two orthogonal polynomial interaction contrasts: linear and
quadratic. The linear interaction contrast tested whether the
mean change between the groups increased monotonically from
T1 to T3, and the quadratic interaction contrast tested whether
the mean change between groups increased maximally at T2
before decreasing (either back to baseline or only partially)
at T3.
To control family-wise error (FWE) for cluster extent
inference, we used a program based on AlphaSim, called
3dClustsim in AFNI (NIMH Scientific and Statistical Computing
Core, Bethesda, MD, USA), which yields the minimum cluster
sizes for a pre-specified FWE alpha level, a pre-specified voxel
threshold, and an estimated smoothness of the statistic map. This
procedure controls false positive activation clusters over the set
of all activation clusters throughout the whole brain volume.
Therefore, we refer to this inference in Results as FWE corrected.
We estimated the smoothness to be 9.9 and 8.1 mm FWHM
(inherent smoothness and applied 4 mm kernel smoothing)
for the main effect analysis and covariate analysis, respectively.
In both cases, we set the cluster-defining threshold to p =
0.001. These parameters yielded a minimum cluster size of 154
voxels (1232 mm3) and 94 voxels (752 mm3), respectively, for a
FWE-corrected alpha level of 0.01. Additionally, we evaluated
a priori regions of interest, left/right hippocampal CBF, since
it has been shown that the hippocampus volume increases
with aerobic exercise (Erickson et al., 2011). Significant clusters
from the VBA, as well as a priori regions of interest, left/right
hippocampus, were further examined for potential relationships
with neurocognitive measures, cardiovascular measures (VO2
max) and RPE. These relationships were assessed in a GLM
framework, similarly as above, with group status a classification
variable, linear/quadratic contrasts of NP/VO2 Max/RPE as a
quantitative explanatory variable and linear/quadratic contrasts
of rCBF estimates as dependent variables. Our primary interest
was to determine whether these relationships across NP/VO2
Max/RPE and rCBF differed between the physical and cognitive
training groups (i.e., the interaction term, which allows separate
relationships by group). We hypothesized that the physical
training group would demonstrate positive associations between
physical fitness (improved VO2 max) and hippocampus blood
flow. As in the previous GLM, the regression coefficients as well
as group differences between them were scaled to t-statistics with
inference, similarly, based on Student’s t-distribution. Finally, we

RESULTS
Subject Characteristics
The current study uniquely focused on the differential cognitive
and neural benefits from either cognitive reasoning or aerobic
exercise training. All cognitive training (CT, n = 18) and physical
training (PT, n = 18) participants completed the neurocognitive
assessments at each time point. However, several participants in
the CT and PT groups were not included in the analysis due
to incomplete MRI time points, gross movement of >3 mm,
and >3◦, artifact or hypercapnia issues (see Figure S1). The
final MRI data analyses were conducted on the majority of
the participants, shown in Table 1. All PT and CT participants
were required to complete at least 90% of training sessions over
the 3 month training period which means they completed 32 h
or more of the 36 h of training. No participant was excluded
due to missing too many sessions to meet the 90% criterion. No
significant differences in age, gender, IQ, MoCA, TICS-M were
noted between groups (p > 0.05). Three participants in the PT
group reported adverse events in the study (mild change in EKG,
leg cramp, change in blood pressure) which may or may not have
been related to the training.
Neurocognitive Measures
Table 2 shows the neurocognitive exam results per the four
cognitive domains for physical training and cognitive training
groups. Cognitive training group showed improvements in
abstraction from complex information as measured by TOSL
(Linear gains p = 0.01) and working memory as measured
by Daneman Carpenter compared to physical training group
(Quadratic gains p = 0.006). Tests of cognitive performance
found that the physical training group significantly improved
over training sessions in immediate and delayed text-level
memory relative to the cognitive training group. Specifically,
two measures of memory function, immediate and delayed text
memory recall, showed improvement from T1 to T3, p = 0.01 and
0.007, respectively. Additionally, we compared cognitive training
participants with MRI scan (n = 13) to those without MRI scan
(n = 5) and found no differences on cognitive measures (p > 0.10,
Table S1), implying that attrition occurred at random.
Physiological Measures
Several physiological parameters were measured at baseline-,
mid-, and end-of physical training to assess participants’ fitness
level, as shown in Table 3. The VO2 Max, a gold standard for
measuring physical fitness, failed to reach statistical significance
when compared to the cognitive training group (Linear: p = 0.17
and Quad: p = 0.15). This may be in part due to short duration
of physical training program of 12 weeks. The RPE, however,
decreased (i.e., lower exertion rate) from T1 to T3 in the physical
training group compared to cognitive training group linearly, p
= 0.02.
MRI Measurements
The global CBF at T1 for physical training and cognitive
training groups were similar at baseline (p = 0.94); 46.8 and
47.0 ml/100 g/min, respectively. The cognitive training group’s
global CBF increased by 7.9% from T1 to T2 and remained
elevated (7.9%) at T3 (Linear: p = 0.05 and Quadratic: p = 0.09)
whereas the physical training group’s global CBF did not change
significantly (Linear: p = 0.18 and Quadratic: p = 0.58). The
global CBF change in cognitive training group was significantly
different compared to physical training group (Linear: p = 0.025,
Quadratic: p = 0.18). To evaluate which brain regions may
have contributed to the CBF increase, we conducted a voxel-
based analysis (VBA). Figure 1A shows the VBA results between
cognitive training and physical training groups (i.e., CT > PT),
testing whether the CBF differences increase monotonically from
T1 to T3 (i.e., Linear, also referred as “at T3”) or whether the
CBF changed maximally at T2 (i.e., quadratically, also referred
as “at T2”). The cognitive training group showed a significant
increase in blood flow at T3 in bilateral medial orbital frontal,
bilateral superior medial frontal and right middle frontal cortices
compared to the physical training group, shown in Figure 1A.
Additionally, the cognitive training group showed a peak increase
at T2 (i.e., Quadratic) in the bilateral middle/posterior cingulate
cortices compared to the physical training group, also shown in
Figure 1A. The reverse contrast (i.e., CT < PT), however, did not
yield any significant results. Table 4 summarizes these findings
with a FWE maintained at 0.01 and cluster volume ≥ 1232 mm3.
The regional CBF-values of the aforementioned regions were
extracted and plotted in Figure 1B to show linear and quadratic
trends. For instance, the CBF of the bilateral medial orbitofrontal
cortex increases monotonically from T1 to T2 and T3. Applying
these clusters to the CVR maps, however, did not show any
change across the groups (p > 0.19). The lack of CVR difference
between groups implies an increase in neuronal demand rather
than vasculature change in the CT group.

DISCUSSION
Cognitive and aerobic exercise trainings have emerged as
two promising non-pharmacological interventions to enhance
cognitive brain health in normally aging adults. Most studies
have focused on either a single training protocol (Jaeggi
et al., 2008; Takeuchi et al., 2013) or combined cognitive
and physical training to alter the course of cognitive decline
in healthy aging (Jak, 2011). In this study, however, we
aimed to elucidate the distinct impact of each training on
the brain and behavior. We found that the cognitive training
improved executive function whereas physical training enhanced
memory. Furthermore, cognitive training group showed CBF
increase in the prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices
compared to physical training group. Interestingly, we found
that the gain in near transfer effect (i.e., TOSL) associated with
increase in dACC CBF in the CT group and the enhanced
memory correlated with increase in hippocampal CBF in the
PT group. Lastly, evidence of increased resting blood flow
without changes to vascular reactivity implicates increased
neural health rather than improved vascular response. These
preliminary results support a realizable potential to improve
brain health through short-term cognitive and aerobic training
protocols.
First, the present results conferred that distinct benefits can be
realized from either the cognitive training (SMART) or aerobic
exercise training in normally aging middle to older age adults.
We identified improvement in complex abstraction and working
memory in the cognitive training group as well as enhanced
immediate and delayed memory in the physical training group.
Cognitive trainings that engage and challenge “integral/complex
function” have previously shown to engage frontally-mediated
control processes and achieve broader impact on associated
cognitive domains and daily function than those achieved
through training specific processes (D’Esposito et al., 2006; Badre
and D’Esposito, 2009; Anguera et al., 2013). Prior clinical trials
examining the specific effects of the cognitive training (SMART)
protocol in adult populations revealed similar performance gains
across a wide array of executive function measures including
abstraction of complex information/goal setting, switching,
concept abstraction, working memory, fluency, and non-verbal
reasoning (Anand et al., 2011; Chapman and Mudar, 2014;
Chapman et al., 2015; Vas et al., 2015). Whereas, improvement
in complex abstraction may be viewed as limited to a near
transfer effect for our CT group; the importance of this gain
is supported by extant evidence that this is a ubiquitous and
foundational top-down cognitive skill called upon in everyday
life (Zwaan and Radvansky, 1998; Chapman and Mudar,
2014). Additionally, a far transfer gain was also identified in
working memory. Training individuals to actively construct
abstracted meanings from the incoming stimuli reinforces the
human brain’s capacity to better understand and remember
generalized meanings than detailed ideas (Gabrieli, 2004). With
regard to aerobic training benefits, we demonstrated significant
increases in both immediate and delayed memory. Enhanced
memory performance has been a commonly identified benefit
associated with physical activity (Erickson et al., 2011). The
health significance of the positive memory gains is underscored
by extensive evidence that memory loss is the most frequent
complaint and concern in aging (Jonker et al., 2000). Our results
support the potential for the adopted cognitive training (SMART)
protocol to improve executive function capacities and for aerobic
exercise to increase memory performance in healthy older adults
ages 56 to 75.
Secondly, we found different regions and patterns of change
in resting CBF between the two training protocols. The physical
training group showed positive relationship between memory
and CBF changes in the exercise group; specifically, gains
in immediate logical memory were associated with increased
resting CBF in bilateral hippocampal regions. The cognitive
training group, on the other hand, showed significant blood
flow increase in key brain region: prefrontal, PCC, and dACC.
The regions with CBF increases are identified in both task
positive [fronto-parietal (FP) and cingulo-opercular (CO)] as
well as task negative networks [default mode network (DM);
Dosenbach et al., 2007]. The FP network operates at fast time-
scales for moment-to-moment adaptive task control whereas
the CO network operates over longer time-scales for stable
task maintenance (Dosenbach et al., 2008). On the other hand,
PCC is a key region of default-mode network and is known
to be vulnerable to dementia and aging (Raz et al., 1997;
Kennedy and Raz, 2009). The linear increase in CBF for
prefrontal cortical regions, associated with top-down cognitive
control and abstraction, suggests the potential benefit of the
cognitive training did not plateau within the time period of
our study, with a concomitant linear improvement in complex
abstraction (see Table 2). The quadratic increase (i.e., maximal
change at T2) in CBF in the posterior cingulate may be due to
rapid changes associated early in the cognitive training regimen
which then plateaued, perhaps because neuronal changes were
consolidated.
We propose that the distinct benefits of CT resulted from
harnessing experienced-driven neural plasticity; whereby the
cognitive strategies engaged and boosted neural activity and
consequently CBF in nodes across functionally-related cognitive
control or top-down processing networks. Exercise-induced

Distinct Benefits of Cognitive vs. Physical Training
FIGURE 2 | CT group showed significant association between gains in regional CBF and behavioral measures compared to PT group. The CT group’s
TOSL (strategic reasoning) score at T3 also showed significant association to bilateral dACC CBF increase at T3 compared to PT group, p < 0.05 [FWE Corrected].
“at T3” refers to linear trend (i.e., change from T1 to T3).
FIGURE 3 | Scatterplots of immediate logical memory (LM) against the left/right hippocampus (HC) CBF regions are shown. The PT group showed
positive immediate logical memory (LM) change at T3 against maximal T2 change of CBF in the left and right hippocampus, p = 0.01 and 0.003, respectively. “at T3”
refers to linear trend (i.e., change from T1 to T3) and “at T2” refers to quadratic trend (i.e., maximal T2 change).
benefits, on the other hand, may have enhanced memory capacity
through enhancement of the inherent metabolic activity in more
focal brain regions, i.e., the hippocampi (Burdette et al., 2010).
Prior work has shown that cardiovascular activity increases
hippocampal blood flow and volume (Niemann et al., 2014).
Our pattern of higher CBF in the hippocampi being linked to
improved immediate memory for the physical training group is
consistent with prior work showing that longer term exercise
of 1-year increased the size of anterior hippocampal volume,
improved memory function and increased serum levels of
BDNF, which mediates neurogenesis (Erickson et al., 2011).
Increases in CBF associated with exercise-induced memory gains
may potentially represent a surrogate marker for neurogenesis
(Pereira et al., 2007).
Prior work has shown resting state CBF to be a promising
neural marker of brain change from distinct interventions
(Mozolic et al., 2010; Vas et al., 2015). Controversy exists as to
whether increased CBF reflects positive or negative changes in
brain function (Sojkova et al., 2008). We suggest that the present
evidence supports positive brain changes since the increased
resting CBF changes were associated with improved cognitive
performance in both CT and PT groups. Specifically, we found
that higher performance in complex abstraction was linked to
increase in resting CBF in the dACC in the CT group and in
resting CBF in hippocampi for those with improved memory in
the PT group. We cautiously interpret our findings and recognize
that continued improvements over longer intervals may be
associated with decreased resting CBF. Additionally, there may
be a different pattern of associations between CBF and cognitive
gains in activation studies when compared to resting-state brain
studies.
The present findings provide some of the first evidence
identifying the distinct neural and cognitive benefits of cognitive
challenges vs. aerobic exercise in healthy older adults. We argue
that cognitive training as reflected through the SMART protocol
could potentially contribute to rebuilding neural health in a
declining neural system where age-related brain losses have been
previously identified. Global and regional CBF, particularly in

Distinct Benefits of Cognitive vs. Physical Training
the frontal networks, have been shown to be vulnerable to the
process of senescence (Lu et al., 2011). The potential to enhance
neural health (i.e., increase neuronal activity) with cognitive
reasoning training is implicated by the lack of significant changes
in cerebrovascular reactivity. A tight coupling between brain
activity during active mental processes being mirrored to a large
degree in intrinsic resting brain has been developed by a number
of neuroscientists (Raichle, 2015). Combining this new finding of
increased CBF with no concomitant change in CVR with results
from our prior study comparing the cognitive reasoning to a
wait list control adds further to the view that neural health was
enhanced by the advanced reasoning training in normally aging
adults (Chapman et al., 2015).
The benefits from short term aerobic exercise training were
manifested through lower RPE, higher immediate/delayed
memory
scores,
and
increased

regions

changes with short-term aerobic exercise are selective rather than
global, similar to what has been suggested by other researchers
(Burdette et al., 2010). Whereas, there was not a statistically
significant increase in VO2 Max in the physical training group,
there was a small albeit non-significant increase in VO2 Max. We
believe the failure to find significant differences may have been
due to the short duration of intervention (i.e., 12 weeks) and
the somewhat cautious exercise prescription given their prior
sedentary lifestyle. Alternatively in a previous arm of this larger
project, we did find that the aerobic exercise group significantly
improved physical fitness when compared to the wait-list control
group (Chapman et al., 2013). We postulate that perhaps the
cognitive training group in the present study increased their
exercise regimen since their fitness was being evaluated at T2
and T3. Future studies could monitor the possibility of increased
exercise across training groups by employing wearable fitness
monitoring technology. Additionally, the finding of a lower
RPE following their brief training regimen is intriguing. We
interpret these findings to suggest that the decrease in RPE may
be related to the conditioning from regular exercise leading to
lower perceived exertion or that they were acclimated to the
exertion by the prior one or two treadmills and hence, reported
lower RPEs. The role of perceived effort may be a factor in the
degree to which individuals continue with a sustained exercise
effort.
We failed to find increased cardiovascular fitness in this 3-
month exercise training trial. This is consistent with most prior
literature that has failed to find that higher cardiorespiratory
fitness is linked to improved cognition (Young et al., 2015).
The relationships across cardiovascular fitness, neural health,
and cognitive function are equivocal and require continued
examination. For example, a recent study failed to find a
relationship between exercise-induced increases in white matter
integrity and improved memory performance, despite reporting
a link between cardiovascular fitness and white matter integrity
in a 1-year exercise trial (Voss et al., 2013). In our study, we
found a significant association between improved memory and
increases in CBF but not in changes to cardiovascular fitness.
Whereas, prior work has suggested that aerobic exercise improves
executive control functions, the benefits were not apparent in
this cognitive domain in our study (Colcombe et al., 2004),
confirming similar findings in a longer-term exercise trial (Voss
et al., 2013).
CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS
This study has a number of strengths which include the following:
a randomized group-design, inclusion of both brain and
neurocognitive outcome measures, utilization of two functional
MRI techniques to assess CBF and cerebrovascular functions,
documented benefits with relatively short-term interventions,
and promising findings on non-pharmacological interventions
that could be practiced independently, making them practical
and affordable. We also note a number of limitations of the
study including: a small sample size, short-duration of physical
training to show brain/physiological benefits, lack of long-term
follow-up assessments beyond 12 weeks, limited age range (56–
75; failure to generalize to those 55 and younger or those older
than 75) and failure to obtain prior experience of participants’
cognitive and physical training as well as limited control between
and within group training for participants’ social interactions,
physical exercise, and cognitive practice outside of training. Thus,
we interpret our findings cautiously; however, we do not believe
that these limitations diminish the potential implications nor
weaken the findings of distinct brain and cognitive differences
between advanced reasoning training and aerobic exercise. One
might be concerned that differences in the social aspect of the
trainings could explain the group differences in brain or cognitive
measures. We do not feel this is the case for two reasons. First,
it is difficult to judge which group had the most social attention
since the CT group met for 12 sessions only in group settings and
the PT group had opportunity to interact with the trainer in 36
training sessions. Secondly in a cognitive training trial in aging
adults with well-controlled social contact, socialization was not
found to have a significant impact on cognitive function (Park
et al., 2014). We do not feel that the younger cohort of this study
is a limitation. There is little consensus as to what is the best age
to intervene to address age-related losses. We were interested in
studying a somewhat younger cohort than prior studies starting
with middle to older age adults (55+) since this is the age when
cognitive decline reportedly accelerates (Agarwal et al., 2009).
According to the recent IOM Report (2015), there is growing
consensus that greater benefit may be derived by starting younger
instead of waiting to intervene at later ages when major cognitive
and brain losses have already accrued.
The present results provide promising clinically-relevant
evidence that aerobic exercise and cognitive reasoning training
contribute differentially to advancing brain health. With regard
to cognitive training, we propose that enhancing executive
functions and the supporting neural systems through advanced
reasoning training could increase the resilience of neural function
and overall cognitive brain health, based on work by Dosenbach
et al. (2008). In the first known training trial to deploy both
CBF and CVR, we found novel evidence that the brain benefits
from cognitive training were due to increased neuronal demand

rather than vascular change. This finding is consistent with Shatil
et al.’s proposed interpretation that cognitive training may be the
main agent for cognitive gains in older adults when compared
to the benefit of exercise (Shatil, 2013). We found that exercisers
with greater memory gains showed higher CBF in hippocampal
regions, an area particularly vulnerable to aging and dementia.
At a global level, this study highlights the distinct brain and
cognitive benefits that may be harnessed by incorporating healthy
habits, such as complex reasoning and aerobic exercise, into one’s
life style. Future trials are needed to determine whether additive
effects are realizable by combined protocols, such as reasoning
training/physical exercise, and if these practices serve as potential
neuroprotective agents to promote successful cognitive aging.
