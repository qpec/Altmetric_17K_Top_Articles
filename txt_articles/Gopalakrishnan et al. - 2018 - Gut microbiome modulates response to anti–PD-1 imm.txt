 Gut microbiome modulates response to anti–PD-1 
immunotherapy in melanoma patients
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.
Pre-clinical mouse models suggest that the gut microbiome modulates tumor response to 
checkpoint blockade immunotherapy; however, this has not been well-characterized in 
human cancer patients. Here we examined the oral and gut microbiome of melanoma 
patients undergoing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (n=112). Significant differences were 
observed in the diversity and composition of the patient gut microbiome of responders (R) 
versus non-responders (NR). Analysis of patient fecal microbiome samples (n=43, 30R, 
13NR) showed significantly higher alpha diversity (p<0.01) and relative abundance of 
Ruminococcaceae bacteria (p<0.01) in responding patients. Metagenomic studies revealed 
functional differences in gut bacteria in R including enrichment of anabolic pathways. 
Immune profiling suggested enhanced systemic and anti-tumor immunity in responding 
patients with a favorable gut microbiome, as well as in germ-free mice receiving fecal 
transplants from responding patients. Together, these data have important implications for 
the treatment of melanoma patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Tremendous advances have been made in the treatment of melanoma and other cancers 
using immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 
(CTLA-4) and the programmed death 1 (PD-1) protein, however responses to these therapies 
are often heterogeneous and not durable (1–3). It has recently emerged that factors beyond 
tumor genomics influence cancer development and therapeutic responses (4–7), including 
host factors such as the gastrointestinal (gut) microbiome (8–10). A number of studies have 
shown that the gut microbiome may influence anti-tumor immune responses via innate and 
adaptive immunity (11, 12), and that therapeutic responses may be improved via its 
modulation (13, 14), however this has not been extensively studied in cancer patients.
To better understand the role of the microbiome in response to immune checkpoint blockade, 
we prospectively collected microbiome samples from patients with metastatic melanoma 
starting treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy (n=112 patients) (fig. S1 and table S1). Oral 
(buccal) and gut (fecal) microbiome samples were collected at treatment initiation, and

 tumor biopsies and blood samples were collected at matched pre-treatment time points when 
possible to assess for genomic alterations, as well as the density and phenotype of tumor-
infiltrating and circulating immune cell subsets (Fig. 1A and fig. S2). Taxonomic profiling 
via 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on all available oral and gut samples, with 
metagenomic whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing on a subset (n=25). Eligible 
patients (n=89) were classified as responders (R; n=54) versus non-responders (NR; n=35) 
based on radiographic assessment using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST 1.1) criteria (15) at 6 months after treatment initiation. Patients were classified as 
R if they achieved an objective response (complete or partial response or stable disease 
lasting at least 6 months), versus NR if they progressed on therapy or had stable disease 
lasting less than 6 months. This classification accounts for the subset of patients who may 
derive long-term disease benefit despite not achieving a bona fide RECIST response, and has 
been employed in numerous published studies of patients on checkpoint blockade (16–19). 
Of note, patients in R versus NR groups were similar with respect to age, gender, primary 
type, prior therapy, concurrent systemic therapy and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
(table S2). Prior genomic analyses have demonstrated that patients with tumors having a 
higher mutational load are more likely to respond to anti-CTLA-4 (16, 20, 21) or anti-PD-1 
therapy (21–24), however a high mutational load alone appears neither sufficient nor 
essential for response. In this cohort, the total number and specific melanoma driver 
mutations were within comparable parameters between R and NR following anti-PD-1 
therapy (fig. S3), though the number of tumors available for sequencing (n=10, R=7, NR=3) 
was limited and may have reduced our ability to detect a significant association between 
mutational burden and response.
We first assessed the landscape of the oral and gut microbiome in all available samples in 
patients (n=112) with metastatic melanoma via 16S sequencing, noting that both 
communities were relatively diverse, with a high abundance of Lactobacillales in the oral 
microbiome and Bacteroidales in the fecal microbiome (Fig. 1B). Bipartite network analysis 
(25) demonstrated a clear separation of community structure between the oral and fecal 
microbiomes in terms of both matched and aggregate samples (fig. S4), suggesting that these 
communities are distinct. Loss of microbial diversity (dysbiosis) is associated with chronic 
health conditions (26–28) and cancer (8–10), and is also associated with poor outcomes to 
certain forms of cancer therapy including allogeneic stem cell transplant (29). Based on 
these data, we examined the diversity of the oral and gut microbiomes in eligible patients on 
anti-PD1 therapy, and found that alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was significantly 
higher in R (n=30) compared to NR (n=13) using several indices (p<0.01, Fig. 1C and fig. 
S5). No significant differences were observed in the oral microbiome (R=54, NR=32, 
p=0.11, fig. S6). We then tested the relationship of diversity and progression-free survival 
(PFS) in our cohort by stratifying patients based on tertiles of Inverse Simpson scores, 
demonstrating that patients with a high diversity in the fecal microbiome had significantly 
prolonged PFS compared to those with intermediate or low diversity (p=0.02 and 0.04, 
respectively; Fig. 1, D and E, and fig. S7). No differences in PFS were noted when 
comparing diversity of the oral microbiome (fig. S8). Importantly, upon visualizing beta 
diversity weighted UniFrac distances (30) by principal coordinate analysis, we found a

 notable clustering effect by response status in the gut microbiome of these patients, which 
was not observed in the oral microbiome (Fig. 1F and fig. S8E).
Since compositional differences in the microbiome may also influence cancer development 
and response to therapy (12, 14, 15, 23), we sought to determine if differences existed in the 
oral or gut microbiomes of R and NR to anti-PD-1 therapy. To test this, we first compared an 
enrichment of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in R versus NR, demonstrating that 
distinct sets of rare low abundance OTUs were associated with response to anti-PD-1 
therapy, with enrichment of Clostridiales in R and Bacteroidales in NR in the gut 
microbiome (p<0.01, Fig. 2, A and B, and fig. S9, A and C). No significant differences in 
enrichment were noted in the oral microbiome of R versus NR (fig. S9, B and D, and fig. 
S10). To further explore these findings, we performed high dimensional class comparisons 
via linear discriminant analysis of effect size (LEfSe) (31), which again demonstrated 
differentially abundant bacteria in the fecal microbiome of R versus NR to anti-PD-1 
therapy, with Clostridiales/Ruminococcaceae enriched in R and Bacteroidales enriched in 
NR (Fig. 2, C and D). No major differences were observed in the oral microbiome between 
R and NR, with the exception of higher Bacteroidales in NR to anti-PD-1 therapy (fig. S11). 
Pairwise comparisons were then performed for bacterial taxa at all levels by response. In 
addition to confirming the previous taxonomic differences, these analyses identified the 
Faecalibacterium genus as significantly enriched in R (Fig. 2E and table S3). Metagenomic 
WGS further confirmed enrichment of Faecalibacterium species in addition to others in R, 
while Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Escherichia coli, and Anaerotruncus colihominis were 
enriched in NR (Fig. 2F and table S4). Importantly, the gut microbiome was shown to be 
relatively stable over time in a limited number of longitudinal samples tested (fig. S12).
We next asked whether bacterial composition and abundances within the gut and/or oral 
microbiomes of patients were associated with a specific treatment outcome to anti-PD-1 
therapy. We grouped all identified OTUs into clusters of related OTUs (crOTUs) via 
construction of a phylogenetic tree from sequence alignment data (32). This technique 
involves comparison of abundances of different potential groupings of bacteria based on 16S 
sequence similarity and helps address the sparse distribution of OTU abundances observed 
in the absence of this approach (fig. S13). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of crOTU 
abundances within the gut and oral microbiomes was then performed without input of 
response data. We found that patients segregated into 2 distinct community types. Type 1 
comprised entirely of R and was enriched for Clostridiales, whereas Type 2 comprised a 
mixture of R and NR (p=0.02) and was enriched for Bacteroidales (Fig. 3A). To better 
understand compositional differences between these crOTU community types, we again 
performed pairwise comparisons of the gut microbiota, and identified a pattern very similar 
to that seen when clustering by response, with Clostridiales/Ruminococcaceae enriched in 
Type 1, and Bacteroidales enriched in Type 2 (fig. S14A and table S5). Further, these 
communities clustered distinctly using principal coordinate analysis of weighted Unifrac 
distances (fig. S14B). Analysis of crOTUs in the oral microbiome revealed no apparent 
relationship to treatment response (fig. S15, A and B).
To explore how specific bacterial taxa impact patient treatment response, we compared PFS 
following anti-PD-1 therapy as it related to the “top hits” consistently observed across our

 analyses. From the Ruminococcaceae family of the Clostridiales order, we focused on the 
Faecalibacterium genus in R, and Bacteroidales order in NR, and stratified patients into high 
versus low categories based on the median relative abundance of these taxa in the gut 
microbiome. Patients with high Faecalibacterium abundance had a significantly prolonged 
PFS versus those with a low abundance (p=0.03). Conversely, patients with a high 
abundance of Bacteroidales had a shortened PFS compared to those with a low abundance 
(p=0.05, Fig. 3D). This is in line with recently published data in a small cohort of patients 
on CTLA-4 blockade, where patients with a higher abundance of Faecalibacterium had a 
prolonged PFS compared to those with a higher abundance of Bacteroidales in the gut 
microbiome (33). In addition, univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses demonstrated 
that the strongest microbial predictors of response to anti-PD-1 therapy were alpha diversity 
[Intermediate hazard ratio (HR)=3.60, 95% C.I.=1.02-12.74; Low HR=3.57, 95% 
confidence interval (C.I.)=1.02-12.52], and abundance of Faecalibacterium (HR=2.92, 95% 
C.I.=1.08-7.89) and Bacteroidales (HR= 0.39, 95% CI=0.15-1.03) in the fecal microbiome. 
There was no association found between PFS and stage in our cohort. Our final multivariate 
model was selected by forward stepwise selection and included Faecalibacterium abundance 
(HR=2.95, 95% C.I.=1.31-7.29, p=0.03) and prior immunotherapy (HR=2.87, 95% 
C.I.=1.10-7.89, p=0.03) (table S6). Abundance of Faecalibacterium and Bacteroidales also 
outperformed relevant clinical variables in receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
analysis (fig. S16).
Next, we sought to gain insight into the mechanism through which the gut microbiome may 
influence response to anti-PD-1 therapy, and first conducted functional genomic profiling of 
gut microbiome samples via metagenomic WGS sequencing (n=25) in R (n=14) vs NR 
(n=11). Organism-specific gene hits were assigned to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) orthology (KO), and based on these annotations, metagenomes for each 
sample were reconstructed into metabolic pathways using the MetaCyc hierarchy of 
pathway classifications (34, 35). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of predicted pathway 
enrichment identified two groups of patient samples, with response rates of 69.2% and 
41.7% (Fig. 3E). A similar pattern was also noted for KO-abundances with 70.6% and 
37.5% response rates (fig. S17). Comparisons of pathway enrichment across these groups 
showed changes in metabolic functions, with anabolic functions predominating in R 
including amino acid biosynthesis (Fig. 3E), which may promote host immunity (36), 
whereas catabolic functions predominated in NR (Fig. 3E, fig. S16, and table S7).
There is clear evidence in pre-clinical models that differential composition of the gut 
microbiome may influence therapeutic responses to anti-PD-1 therapy at the level of the 
tumor microenvironment (12), thus we next examined the relationship between the gut 
microbiota and systemic and anti-tumor immune responses in our cohort of patients on anti-
PD-1 therapy. We compared the tumor-associated immune infiltrates via multi-parameter 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and observed a higher density of CD8+ T cells in baseline 
samples of R versus NR (p=0.04), consistent with prior reports (Fig. 4A and fig. S18) (18, 
37). Pairwise comparisons using Spearman rank correlations were then performed between 
specific bacterial taxa enriched in the gut microbiome of R and NR and immune markers in 
the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating a statistically significant positive correlation 
between the CD8+ T cell infiltrate in the tumor and abundance of the Faecalibacterium

 genus, the Ruminococcaceae family and the Clostridiales order in the gut and a non-
significant but negative correlation with Bacteroidales (Fig. 4, B and C, and figs. S19 and 
S20). No associations were seen between CD8+ T cell density and diversity or crOTU 
community type membership (fig. S21). Analysis of systemic immune responses via flow 
cytometry and cytokine assays revealed that patients with a high abundance of Clostridiales, 
Ruminococcaceae or Faecalibacterium in the gut had higher levels of effector CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells in the systemic circulation with a preserved cytokine response to anti-PD-1 
therapy, whereas patients with a higher abundance of Bacteroidales in the gut microbiome 
had higher levels of regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) 
in the systemic circulation, with a blunted cytokine response (Fig. 4D and figs. S22 and 
S23). To better understand the influence of compositional differences in the gut microbiome 
on antigen processing and presentation within the tumor microenvironment, we next 
performed multiplex IHC targeting the myeloid compartment (38). In these studies, patients 
with a high abundance of Faecalibacterium in the gut microbiome had a higher density of 
immune cells and markers of antigen processing and presentation compared to those with a 
high abundance of Bacteroidales (Fig. 4, E and F, and figs. S24 and S25), suggesting a 
possible mechanism through which the gut microbiome may modulate anti-tumor immune 
responses (12), though this must be validated in a larger cohort.
To investigate a causal link between a “favorable” gut microbiome and response to immune 
checkpoint blockade, we performed Fecal Microbiome Transplantation (FMT) experiments 
in germ-free recipient mice (Fig. 4G). In these studies, mice that were transplanted with 
stool from R to anti-PD-1 therapy (R-FMT) had significantly reduced tumor growth (p=0.04, 
Fig. 4H and fig. S26A) by day 14 compared to those transplanted with stool from NR (NR-
FMT). Importantly, mice transplanted with R-FMT also exhibited improved responses to 
anti-PD-L1 therapy (Fig. 4I) in contrast to mice that were transplanted with stool from NR 
(NR-FMT). Next we performed 16S sequencing on fecal samples collected from mice 
treated with FMT, demonstrating that R-FMT mice also had significantly higher abundance 
of Faecalibacterium in their gut microbiome (p<0.01) (fig. S27). We also wanted to better 
understand the mechanism through which the gut microbiome may influence systemic and 
anti-tumor immune responses, and performed correlative studies on tumors, peripheral blood 
and spleens from these mice. These studies demonstrated that tumors of mice receiving R-
FMT had a higher density of CD8+ T cells than mice receiving NR-FMT, consistent with 
human data (Fig. 4J and fig. S26B, top series). Analysis of CD45+ myeloid and lymphoid 
tumor infiltrating cells by flow cytometry confirmed this result (fig. S26C). Moreover, FMT 
from R locally increased the number of CD45+ immune and CD8+ T cells in the gut 
compared to NR-FMT (Fig. 4K and fig. S26B, bottom series). Mass cytometry analysis 
using t-SNE dimension reduction was performed on tumors from mice, and demonstrated 
up-regulation of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment of mice receiving R-FMT versus 
NR-FMT (fig. S26D), suggesting the development of a “hot” tumor microenvironment. 
Further phenotypic studies of tumor immune infiltrates revealed a significant enrichment of 
innate effector cells (expressing CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+) in mice receiving R-FMT (fig. 
S26E). A lower frequency of suppressive myeloid cells (expressing CD11b+CD11c+) was 
observed in mice receiving R-FMT compared to mice receiving NR-FMT (fig. S26F). 
Finally, an increase in the frequency of RORγT+ Th17 cells in the tumor was also detected

 in NR-FMT mice (fig. S26G), in line with what we observed in tumors from patients who 
failed to respond to anti-PD-1 therapy. Mice receiving NR-FMT also had higher levels of 
regulatory CD4+ FoxP3+ T cells (fig. S26H) and CD4+ IL-17+ (fig. S26I) cells in the 
spleen, suggesting impaired host immune responses.
Our results indicate that the gut microbiome may modulate responses to anti PD-1 
immunotherapy in melanoma patients. We propose that patients with a “favorable” gut 
microbiome (e.g., high diversity and abundance of Ruminococcaceae/Faecalibacterium) 
have enhanced systemic and anti-tumor immune responses mediated by increased antigen 
presentation, and improved effector T cell function in the periphery and the tumor 
microenvironment. In contrast, patients with an “unfavorable” gut microbiome (e.g., low 
diversity and high relative abundance of Bacteroidales) have impaired systemic and anti-
tumor immune responses mediated by limited intratumoral lymphoid and myeloid 
infiltration and weakened antigen presentation capacity. These findings highlight the 
therapeutic potential of modulating the gut microbiome in patients receiving checkpoint 
blockade immunotherapy, and warrant prompt evaluation in cancer patients through clinical 
trials.

 Figure 1. Enhanced gut microbiome diversity is associated with improved response to anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma
(A) Schema of sample collection and analyses. (B) Stacked bar plot of phylogenetic 
composition of common bacterial taxa (>0.1% abundance) at the order level in oral (n=109, 
top) and fecal (n=53, bottom) samples by 16S rRNA sequencing. (C) Inverse Simpson 
diversity scores of the gut microbiome in R (n=30) and NR (n=13) to anti PD-1 
immunotherapy by Mann-Whitney (MW) test. Error bars represent the distribution of 
diversity scores. (D) Phylogenetic composition of fecal samples (n=39) at the family level 
(>0.1% abundance) at baseline. High (blue) (>11.63, n=13), intermediate (gold) (7.46-11.63, 
n=13) and low (red) (<7.46, n=13) diversity groups were determined using tertiles of Inverse 
Simpson scores. (E) Kaplan-Meier (KM) plot of progression-free survival (PFS) by fecal 
diversity; high (median PFS undefined), intermediate (median PFS=232 days), and low 
(median PFS=188 days). High vs intermediate diversity (HR 3.60, 95% C.I. 1.02-12.74) and 
high vs low (HR 3.57, 95% C.I. 1.02-12.52) by univariate Cox model. *p<0.05, **p<0.01. 
(F) Principal coordinate analysis of fecal samples (n=43) by response using Weighted

 Figure 2. Compositional differences in the gut microbiome are associated with responses to anti-
PD-1 immunotherapy
(A) Heatmap of OTU abundances in R (n=30) and NR (n=13). Columns denote patients 
grouped by response and sorted by diversity within R and NR groups; rows denote bacterial 
OTUs grouped into 3 sets according to their enrichment/depletion in R versus NR: Set 1 
(enriched in R), Set 2 (unenriched), and Set 3 (enriched in NR), and then sorted by mean 
abundance within each set. (B) Phylogenetic composition of OTUs within each set at the 
order level. Set 1 (enriched in R); Set 2 (unenriched); Set 3 (enriched in NR). (C) 
Taxonomic cladogram from LEfSe showing differences in fecal taxa. Dot size is 
proportional to the abundance of the taxon. Letters correspond to the following taxa: (a) 
Gardnerella vaginalis, (b) Gardnerella, (c) Rothia, (d) Micrococcaceae, (e) Collinsella

(D) LDA scores computed for differentially-abundant taxa in the fecal microbiomes of R 
(blue) and NR (red). Length indicates effect size associated with a taxon. p=0.05 for the 
Kruskal-Wallis test; LDA score > 3. (E) Differentially-abundant gut bacteria in R (blue) vs 
NR (red) by MW test (FDR-adjusted) within all taxonomic levels. (F) Pairwise comparisons 
by MW test of abundances of metagenomic species (MGS) identified by metagenomic WGS 
in fecal samples (n=25): R (n=14, blue), NR (n=11, red). *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Colors reflect 
gene abundances visualized using “barcodes” with the following order of intensity: 
white(0)<light blue<blue<green<yellow<orange<red for increasing abundance and each 
color change corresponds to a 4x fold abundance change. In these barcodes, MGS appear as 
vertical lines (co-abundant genes in a sample) colored according to the gene abundance.
