AIMS
Deprescribing is a suggested intervention to reverse the potential iatrogenic harms of inappropriate polypharmacy. The review
aimed to determine whether or not deprescribing is a safe, effective and feasible intervention to modify mortality and health
outcomes in older adults.
METHODS
Specified databases were searched from inception to February 2015. Two researchers independently screened all retrieved articles
for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were pooled using RevMan v5.3. Eligible studies included those where
older adults had at least one medication deprescribed. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes were adverse drug
withdrawal events, psychological and physical health outcomes, quality of life, and medication usage (e.g. successful deprescribing,
number of medications prescribed, potentially inappropriate medication use).
RESULTS
A total of 132 papers met the inclusion criteria, which included 34 143 participants aged 73.8 ± 5.4 years. In nonrandomized
studies, deprescribing polypharmacy was shown to significantly decrease mortality (OR 0.32, 95% CI: 0.17–0.60). However, this
was not statistically significant in the randomized studies (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61–1.11). Subgroup analysis revealed patient-
specific interventions to deprescribe demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43–0.88). However,
generalized educational programmes did not change mortality (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.86–1.69).
CONCLUSIONS
Although nonrandomized data suggested that deprescribing reduces mortality, deprescribing was not shown to alter mortality in
randomized studies. Mortality was significantly reduced when applying patient-specific interventions to deprescribe in random-
ized studies.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT

 WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• Deprescribing appears to be a feasible intervention.
• Deprescribing may not affect mortality.
• Evidence exists to guide deprescribing individual medications in carefully defined scenarios.
Introduction
People are living longer than ever before, but many older
adults live with multiple chronic diseases [1]. Efficacious
medications modify the risk of future serious events such as
myocardial infarction or stroke [2]. Medications alleviate
symptoms such as pain, anxiety and reflux. Additionally,
there is increased evidence for combination therapies for
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and benign pros-
tatic hypertrophy [3–5]. Consequently, the daily routine of
taking many medications is now the norm rather than the
exception for many older adults. By age 70, three out of four
people take five or more medications every day [6]. The
potential problem of polypharmacy continues to grow with
the average 70-year-old taking an additional two tablets every
day than the average 70-year-old did just ten years ago [7–9].
Therefore,
the
‘cure’
may
have
become
the
‘disease’.
Polypharmacy among older people is associated with poorer
health
outcomes
such
as
increased
rates
of
impaired
cognition, frailty, falls, morbidity and disability [10–12]. It is
independently associated with increased mortality [13]. It
remains unclear whether polypharmacy is merely an indica-
tor, or cause, of poorer health outcomes.
To reverse the harms of polypharmacy appears simple.
The number of medications older adults use should be re-
duced by ‘deprescribing’ [14]. Deprescribing is defined as
the ‘the process of withdrawal of inappropriate medication,
supervised by a health care professional with the goal of
managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes’ [15]. This
process can be applied in practice using a five-step approach:
(1) consider all medications currently taken and the indica-
tion for each medication, (2) evaluate the overall risk of
medication-induced harm in an individual person, (3) assess
each medication for its potential to be deprescribed, (4) sort
medications by the order of priority to deprescribe, (5) imple-
ment and monitor deprescribing regimen [14]. A useful mne-
monic for this process is CEASE [16]. Yet the evidence base to
support deprescribing interventions remains relatively scant,
and it is unknown if deprescribing can ameliorate the corre-
lated harms of polypharmacy. Recent systematic reviews have
investigated the barriers and enablers for both consumers and
prescribers, as well as the definition of deprescribing [15, 17,
18]. Existing systematic reviews have explored deprescribing
specific classes (including cardiovascular, psychotropic and
hypnotic medications) [19–21] as well as specific scenarios,
such as oncology, palliative care and deprescribing to prevent
or modify the risk of falls [22, 23]. This systematic review is
the first to compile evidence for deprescribing in older adults
across all settings and medications. The review aims to deter-
mine whether deprescribing is a safe, effective and feasible
intervention to modify mortality and health outcomes in
older adults. More specifically, the primary aim is to establish
the safety of deprescribing by assessing its effects on
mortality. The secondary aims include exploring the safety
of deprescribing by investigating adverse drug withdrawal
events. Further, we explore the efficacy of deprescribing inter-
ventions by investigating health outcomes and quality of life.
Additionally, we review whether deprescribing interventions
are achievable.
Methods
The protocol was prospectively published and registered with
Prospero Database of Systematic Reviews (CRD42014009887)
[24, 25]. This review was conducted and reported in adher-
ence to the PRISMA statement of quality for reporting
systematic reviews and meta-analyses [26].
Selection criteria
The selection criteria were described in detail previously and
are briefly described here [24].
Types
of participants.
This review considered studies that
included people aged 65 years and older who were prescribed one
or more regular medications at the beginning of the study
. Studies
that included only moribund, terminal or palliative participants
were excluded. No limitation was placed on the setting.
Types of interventions.
This review considered studies that
evaluated deprescribing by a health care professional of one
or more regular prescription medications. Studies were
included where the stated aim or effect was to deprescribe
one or more medications.
For the study to be eligible for inclusion, the deprescribing
intervention needed to target a medication available in 2015
in at least one of the following countries: Australia, New
Zealand, United Kingdom, Canada or the United States. This
focused the review on medications currently available today,
rather than those withdrawn from the market.
These could be compared to either no comparator or usual
care, namely the continuation of the prescribed medication.
Types of outcome measures.
Outcomes were included where
reported as either an outcome or an effect of the intervention
in the original paper. Mortality was the primary outcome
measure
for
this
review.
Secondary
outcome
measures
considered were any reported adverse drug withdrawal events.
Health outcomes were considered where there were clinically-
relevant physical health, cognitive function and psychological
health parameters or events.
Quality of life measured using any standardized tool was
considered. The effect on the medication regimen was
included if reported using a standard measure, such as any
A. T. Page et al.

 implicit or explicit prescribing tools, success of deprescribing
or total number of medications.
Types of studies.
This review considered for inclusion both
experimental and observational studies of deprescribing of
one or more prescription medications in older people. These
were defined as studies where the stated aim or effect of the
intervention was to reduce medication. The review included
experimental study designs (randomized controlled studies
(RCTs),
quasi-randomized
controlled
studies,
and
nonrandomized controlled studies) as well as observational
study designs with concurrent controls (prospective and
retrospective
cohort
studies,
case-control
studies),
and
observational
studies
without
concurrent
controls
(historical cohort studies, two or more single arm studies,
and before and after studies).
Studies available in English at any time up to the com-
mencement of the search on 11 February 2015 were consid-
ered for inclusion in this review.
Search strategy
The search strategy aimed to identify both published and
unpublished studies, and has previously been described in
detail [24]. Briefly, databases were searched from inception
to February 2015. EbscoHost (CINAHL Plus, Health Source:
Nursing/Academic Edition, Academic Search Premier), Ovid
(Medline, DARE), Scopus, Web of Science, Elsevier (Embase)
and ProQuest (Dissertations and Theses Global) were searched
to identify published papers and grey literature. National
Institutes of Health Trials Register, Australian New Zealand Clin-
ical Trials Registry and European Union Clinical Trials Register
were searched for ongoing trials. The search terms used were:
1. prescribing, prescription, drug, medication, polypharmacy, indi-
vidual generic drug names, drug classes and therapeutic
classes
2. deprescrib*,
inappropriate,
reduc*,
stop*,
withdraw*,
cessation, ceas*,discontinu*
3. aged OR ageing OR 65 years OR geriatric OR older adult OR
older OR elderly OR veteran
4. 1 AND 2 AND 3
The detailed Medline database search is available in the
supplementary file. The reference lists of all identified papers
were scanned for relevant studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies.
Two researchers independently screened
the titles and abstracts of all records retrieved. Full texts of all
articles were retrieved that appeared to meet the selection
criteria and for those that could not be adequately assessed
from the information given. Two researchers independently
assessed the full-text articles for eligibility. They resolved
any differences through consensus, and where consensus
was not achieved, a third researcher made the final decision.
Data extraction and management.
An electronic data extraction
form was designed using DistillerSR online application [27].
One researcher independently extracted details of included
articles, which were verified by a second researcher. Information
extracted included the study design and size, intervention
dates, setting, participants’ age, sex, whether participants
were living with dementia, the inclusion and exclusion
criteria, medication targeted for deprescribing, withdrawal
schedule,
reported
outcomes,
follow-up
duration
and
funding source.
For studies where the stated aim or effect of the interven-
tion
was
to
deprescribe
polypharmacy,
we
extracted
additional information about the method used to identify target
medication. We extracted data on whether the intervention was
patient-specific or educational. Deprescribing interventions
were defined as patient-specific when (i) the investigators iden-
tified target medications to deprescribe and implemented the
process (investigator-led interventions), and (ii) the investiga-
tors
undertook
medication
reviews
to
identify
target
medications to deprescribe, and then recommended to
the prescribing doctors that they deprescribe the medica-
tions (medication reviews). Education interventions were
defined as those where health care professionals were
provided with education sessions with the intention to re-
duce medication use through modified behaviours.
Missing data.
The original authors were contacted to obtain
missing information or clarify unclear data. Where this was
not successful, we conducted the analysis with only the
available data.
Assessment of risk of bias.
Two reviewers independently
assessed the risk of bias [27]. The second reviewer was
blinded to author, year and place of publication. The
Cochrane Collaboration’s ‘Risk of Bias’ tool was used to
assess the risk of bias for each included RCT [28, 29]. For
studies other than RCTs, we modified the standard tool
using the recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook
and combined it with the Newcastle-Ottawa tool [29].
Assessment of reporting biases.
Risk of reporting bias was
assessed using funnel plot asymmetry, where data from
more than ten similar studies were pooled [29].
Unit-of-analysis issues.
Included studies reported in two or
more papers were combined into a single study. We extracted
data
from
each
report
separately,
and
then
combined
information across the multiple data collection forms.
For multi-arm studies, the authors used their judgement
to identify the most relevant intervention and control group
to enter into the meta-analysis. If three or more groups were
relevant to the review, then we combined the groups from
multiple arms studies into a single group in RevMan v5.3
[30]. This was done to avoid the possibility of introducing
bias caused by using one control group for multiple statistical
comparisons. Where studies reported an outcome at multiple
time points, we used the data from the last time point [29].
For crossover studies and factorial study designs, the anal-
ysis techniques used intended to avoid potential unit-of-
analysis issues. For crossover studies, we used only data from
the first phase of crossover studies. For studies that used a fac-
torial design, the group that received only the deprescribing
intervention were selected and compared to the group that
received neither intervention.

 Data synthesis.
Where possible, quantitative data from
studies
were
pooled
for
statistical
meta-analysis
using
RevMan
v5.3
[30].
Data
were
pooled
based
on
the
medication(s) deprescribed regardless of the intervention
technique. Studies were pooled as ‘polypharmacy’ where
the stated aim or effect of the intervention was to reduce
medications across three or more medications or classes.
Data from RCTs were not combined with data from other
study designs. We further separated comparative studies
with and without concurrent control groups.
Forest plots were produced where three or more studies
were included in a meta-analysis.
Data in tables are presented in order of polypharmacy and
then by therapeutic class based on the Anatomical Therapeu-
tic Classification (ATC) codes.
Randomized studies.
The Mantel-Haenszel method using
the
fixed
effects
model
was
used
to
pool
RCTs.
If
heterogeneity was detected, we chose the random effects
model. Where one or more of the original studies used a
cluster-randomization method, we used the generic inverse-
variance method rather than the Mantel-Haenszel method.
Nonrandomized studies with concurrent control groups.
The
generic inverse-variance method with a fixed effects model
was used to pool data [29]. If heterogeneity was detected, we
chose the random effects model.
Nonrandomized studies without a concurrent control group.
The data were reported narratively for these studies [29].
Dichotomous data.
Effect sizes and their 95% confidence
intervals were expressed as odds ratios (OR). Where a study
reported zero events in both arms, the study was excluded
from the meta-analysis [29].
Continuous data.
Effect sizes and their 95% confidence
intervals were expressed as weighted mean differences
(MD). Where studies
reported
the
mean but
not
the
standard deviation, we have looked for other reports of
variance for continuous data. If other measures of variance
have been given, such as standard error or 95% confidence
interval and P-values, we have entered these data into
RevMan 5.3 to calculate the standard deviation [30]. We
chose the larger of the two values where the significant
decimal places in a measure of variance had been rounded
and resulted in an uneven spread. We sought the standard
deviation from the study author where insufficient detail of
variance was provided in the paper to calculate the standard
deviation. Where the detail of variance was still unavailable,
the study was excluded from the meta-analysis.
Assessment
of
heterogeneity.
Heterogeneity
was
assessed
visually with forest plots where applicable. Heterogeneity
was quantitatively assessed using the standard Chi-square
and defined as either I2 ≤ 50% or P > 0.1 [29].
Subgroup
analysis.
Subgroup
analyses
were
undertaken
when
ten
or
more
studies
investigating
the
same
deprescribing target medication(s) reported an outcome.
The subgroup analyses were based on age (participants aged
under 80 years and those aged 80 years and over), cognitive
function (participants living with dementia and cognitively
intact
participants)
and
intervention
method
(patient-
specific interventions and educational programmes). The
subgroups based on age and cognitive function, which were
prespecified in the protocol as the old-old and people living
with dementia, are demographic groups where there is often
sparse clinical evidence to support medication use, and
often have greater or specific health care needs.
Results
Description of studies
Results of the search.
The initial search identified 27 086
records, and 1378 were identified through other methods
(Figure 1). A total of 497 full papers were retrieved for
further examination, and 132 papers reported 116 studies
that
met
the
inclusion
criteria
(Figure
1)
[31–162].
Additional information was sought from the authors of 18
studies [41, 43, 48–50, 57, 59, 65, 77, 84, 88, 92, 99, 104,
105, 109, 119, 160]. Five authors responded to this request
for further information [84, 88, 92, 99, 109].
Included studies
A detailed summary of all included studies is presented in
Table 1 for deprescribing polypharmacy (three or more med-
ications or classes) and Table 2 for deprescribing individual
targets, and a description of each included study is presented
in Results S1. These included studies are summarized in tables
based on study design and sorted by deprescribing target
(Table 3, Tables S2 and S3).
Study design
Included studies were RCTs (participants = 17 428; studies =
56) [32, 36–38, 40–43, 45–50, 53, 55, 57–59, 62, 63, 68,
76–78, 81, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 99, 102, 106, 112, 116,
118–120, 123, 129, 135, 142–145, 147, 149, 152, 157, 159,
161], comparative studies with a concurrent control group
(participants = 14 522; studies = 22) [31, 33, 34, 39, 44, 51,
52, 54, 56, 60, 64, 66, 69–75, 79–81, 83, 87–89, 91, 93–98,
101, 104, 105, 107–109, 111, 113, 114, 117, 122, 124–126,
132–134, 137, 139–141, 146, 148, 150, 156, 158, 160, 162],
and comparative studies without a concurrent control group
(participants = 2207; studies = 37) [33, 34, 39, 44, 51, 56, 64,
66, 69, 71–75, 79, 83, 87–89, 91, 93–96, 98, 104, 105, 107–109,
113, 117, 124, 126, 134, 140, 141, 148, 156, 160]. Follow-up
was for a weighted mean (SD) of 15.5 ± 17.4 months.
Participants
The 34 143 participants had a mean age of 73.8 ± 5.4 years,
and 51.8% were male. The mean age was over 80 years in 38
studies (4833 participants) [33–35, 37–40, 44–46, 50, 62, 74,
78–80, 84, 86, 94, 108–110, 112, 119, 120, 123]. Thirty-three
studies included people living with dementia (6090 partici-
pants) [34, 36, 37, 40, 45, 50, 62, 63, 77–81, 94, 102, 107,
109, 110, 112, 120, 123, 131, 133], and another six studies
were unclear whether they included participants living with
dementia (429 participants) [38, 55, 74, 145, 150, 160].

 Setting.
Fourteen studies were set in hospital [34, 46, 55, 60,
64, 77, 80, 94, 99, 101, 111, 119, 145], 29 in residential aged
care facilities [36, 37, 39, 40, 44, 45, 50, 51, 74, 78, 83, 86,
93, 107, 108, 112, 120, 123, 131, 133, 137, 139, 146, 147,
149, 155, 160, 162], and 73 were community based,
which included outpatient facilities, general practice and
retirement villages [31–33, 41–43, 47–49, 52–54, 56–59, 62,
63, 65, 66, 68–73, 76, 79, 81, 82, 84, 87–92, 95–98, 102, 104–
106, 109, 110, 113, 114, 116–118, 122, 124–126, 129, 132,
134, 135, 140–144, 150, 152, 156–159, 161]. One study
included
participants
based
in
the
community
and
residential
aged
care
[38],
and
another
was
based
in
community and hospital [75].
Interventions
Deprescribing single medications was the most common type
of intervention investigated. These included deprescribing (i)
a single medication (e.g. atenolol) [31, 41, 42, 49, 51, 54, 56,
60, 62–65, 69–71, 74, 81, 90, 92, 104, 106, 108, 109, 117,
118, 129, 134, 135, 140, 144, 147, 158, 160, 161]; (ii) a single
pharmacological class (e.g. beta-blockers) [52, 53, 59, 82,

93, 94, 105, 107, 112–114, 131, 137, 139, 146, 149, 155].
Eleven studies investigated withdrawing two medications
[39, 43, 44, 50, 57, 58, 73, 76, 91, 97, 106].
Twenty-one
studies
investigated
deprescribing
poly-
pharmacy [32, 38, 47, 55, 77–80, 83, 84, 88, 101, 111, 120,
123, 132, 142, 150, 159, 162]. Of these studies, 18 were
patient-specific interventions [32, 38, 47, 55, 77, 79, 80, 83,
84, 88, 101, 111, 122, 123, 132, 142, 150, 159]. These
patient-specific interventions were led by doctors in 11 stud-
ies [38, 47, 77, 79, 80, 101, 111, 122, 123, 132, 150], pharma-
cists in two studies [83, 88], nurses in one study [142], and
multidisciplinary teams in four studies [32, 55, 84, 159].
These were investigator-led deprescribing interventions in
10 studies [38, 47, 79, 80, 88, 122, 123, 132, 142, 150], and
used medication reviews with recommendations to the pre-
scriber in eight studies [32, 55, 77, 83, 84, 101, 111, 159].
Three studies were educational programmes delivered at
residential aged care facilities to nurses [120] and to the
prescribing doctors [78, 162].
Excluded studies
Citations for excluded full-text papers are shown in the
supplementary file 2 along with the rationale for exclusion.
Only a published protocol or trial registration was found for
seven studies (supplementary file 2) [123, 163–167]. Six of
these studies were excluded as no results were available
[163–166]. Results were available for one unpublished study,
so the unpublished data has been included [123]. This paper
has since been published.
Risk of bias in included studies
Details of the risk of bias for RCTs are presented in Figure 2.
The risk of bias assessment for each study is presented in Re-
sults S1. The risk of bias was rated low in at least four of the
seven parameters assessed in 32% (18 of the 56) of RCTs [36,
40, 45, 47–49, 53, 62, 77, 90, 102, 110, 112, 116, 123, 129,
131, 135, 143, 157]. The remaining 68% of studies all had un-
clear or high risk of bias. Industry funded ten studies that
were included in this review, which was declared in the paper
in each case [31, 41, 42, 57, 66, 81, 97, 114, 118, 135].
Heterogeneity in included studies
Quantitative heterogeneity assessments are presented in

Across these studies, deprescribing did not significantly modify
mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61–1.11; participants = 3151,
studies = 10) (Figure 3) [32, 38, 55, 77, 78, 84, 88, 120, 123, 159].
The sub-group analysis based on intervention technique
demonstrated differences in mortality. Mortality was signifi-
cantly reduced when patient-specific interventions were ap-
plied (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43–0.88; participants = 1906;
studies = 8) (Figure 4) [32, 38, 55, 77, 84, 88, 123, 159]. In con-
trast, educational programmes demonstrated no change in
mortality (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.86–1.69; participants = 1245;
studies = 2) [78, 120].
Participant sub-group analysis: age.
The sub-group analysis
based on age demonstrated no change in mortality (Figure 5)
for people aged over 80 years (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74–1.31;
participants = 1923; studies = 7) [32, 38, 55, 78, 84, 120, 123].
People aged under 80 years showed a trend to reduced
mortality (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.40–1.04; participants = 1228;
studies = 3) [47, 77, 142].

Polypharmacy: nonrandomized studies.
Two studies assessed
the effect of deprescribing polypharmacy on mortality
(Table S4). They indicated a significant decrease in mortality
(OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17–0.60; participants = 257; studies = 2)
[80, 162].
Single medications/classes: randomized studies.
Deprescribing
of single medications/classes in RCTs (eTable 3) was not

with
a
statistically

in
mortality. For example, deprescribing antipsychotics did not
significantly reduced mortality (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.33–1.07;
participants = 453; studies = 5) (eFigure 1) [35–37, 62, 131, 155].
Single medications/classes: nonrandomized studies.
Deprescribing
of single medications/classes in nonrandomized studies (eTable

Figure S9. They are briefly summarized below.
Adverse drug withdrawal events.
Deprescribing to reduce
polypharmacy was not associated with a significant increase
in adverse drug withdrawal events [88].
Health outcomes.
Deprescribing to reduce polypharmacy did

Cognitive function did not significantly change (Table S3) [38,

experiencing at least one fall (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40–1.05;
participants = 2173; studies = 5) (Figure S2) [47, 77, 78, 123,
159]. However, participants who did fall had significantly
fewer falls overall in the deprescribing group compared to
those in the control group (MD �0.11, 95% CI �0.21–�0.02;
participants = 844; studies = 3) (Figure S3) [78, 123, 168].
Quality of life.
Deprescribing to reduce polypharmacy was
not associated with significant changes in quality of life
using standardized measures (Table S3). The exception was
one study where deprescribing produced a significant yet
modest positive finding that it slows the decline in quality
of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01–0.06; participants = 189;
studies = 1) [120].
Effect on the medication regime.
Deprescribing reduced both the
total number of medications (MD �0.99, 95% CI �1.83–�0.14;
participants = 451; studies = 2) [78, 123] and number of
potentially inappropriate medications taken (MD �0.49, 95%

Adverse drug withdrawal effects.

antipsychotics
and
antidepressants (Table S3, Figure S4) [45, 53, 62, 131, 149].
Health outcomes.
Health outcomes of deprescribing (Table
S3; eFigure S5–S7) were related to the signs, symptoms or
disease
state
that
the
medication(s)
were
intended
to
manage, or improvement of suspected adverse effects. For
example, the effect of deprescribing antihypertensives on
blood pressure control was investigated. This produced an
increased
systolic
(MD
7.40,
95%
CI
3.10–11.70;
participants = 385 studies = 1) [110] and diastolic blood
pressure (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.24–4.96 participants = 385
studies = 1) [110]. Similar changes in the systolic (MD 9.73,
95% CI 8.13–11.33; participants = 368; studies = 3) [46, 112,
157] and diastolic blood pressure (MD 3.99, 95% CI 3.04–
4.94; participants = 367; studies = 3) [46, 112, 157] were
observed when diuretics were deprescribed (Figure S6 and S7).
Quality of life.
Deprescribing single medications was not
associated with significant changes in quality of life using
standardized measures (Table S3).
Effect on the medication regime.
Effect on the medication
regimen varied according to the medication (Table S3; Figure S8).
Discussion
This paper reports the first comprehensive systematic review
of deprescribing interventions intended to reduce one or
more medications. Deprescribing to reduce polypharmacy
was not shown to modify mortality in RCTs although
nonrandomized data suggested that it reduced mortality.
Mortality was significantly reduced when patient-specific
deprescribing
interventions
were
applied
in
RCTs.
Deprescribing appears to be feasible and generally safe.
Deprescribing to reduce polypharmacy appears to have some
health benefits. The number of people who fell did not change,
but it reduced the number of falls they experienced. This finding
is consistent with a previous review on interventions to reduce
falls [22]. Deprescribing does not appear to modify mortality in
people aged over 80 years despite epidemiological and animal
evidence that associates polypharmacy to poorer health out-
comes in older adults [10–12]. Nonetheless, a trend to decreased
mortality was noted in the 65–80-year-old age group. This hints
that the susceptibility to the effects from deprescribing may vary
across the lifespan.
The health outcomes from deprescribing varied with the tar-
get medication. This is unsurprising as the evidence to support
treatment, the risk to benefit profile, and rationale for both pre-
scribing and deprescribing varies between medications. For
example, the rationale for deprescribing bisphosphonates after
3–5 years of treatment is that the therapeutic benefit persists af-
ter drug withdrawal [169]. In contrast, antihypertensives rapidly
cease to exert an effect. Deprescribing antihypertensives re-
sulted in modest increases in blood pressure. The rationale for
deprescribing antihypertensives would need to be individual-
ized to consider actual adverse effects experienced, blood pres-
sure controlled too tightly, or to consider the less stringent
blood pressure targets that may be appropriate for older adults
[14, 170]. Another consideration for these preventative treat-
ments is whether the treatment is appropriate late in life with
a limited life expectancy [171]. However, deprescribing single
medications did not always significantly alter health outcomes
and quality of life. The available data suggests some medications
can be deprescribed without adverse changes in the specific
health outcomes the medications were intended to treat, which
was consistent with the findings of previous systematic reviews
that assessed deprescribing of specific medications [19, 20].
Deprescribing is difficult to implement, though this re-
view suggests that deprescribing is feasible [21, 172]. It rein-
forces the importance of individualized approaches
to
medication use for older adults. Identifying deprescribing tar-
gets is not an exact science, and health care professionals can
vary in their assessment on which medications are inappro-
priate [173, 174]. Evidence of feasibility supports the existing
body of research including previous systematic reviews on
the intervention techniques, barriers and enablers [17, 18,
175]. These combined works can be integrated to inform the
design and implementation of future deprescribing interven-
tions and contribute to the growing discussion about
deprescribing [14, 176–178].
There are several limitations to this review. Language bias
may have also been introduced as we included only English-
language studies though applied no other limits. The review
had broad inclusion criteria and a comprehensive search strat-
egy, and we detected many relevant studies for inclusion. De-
spite this, there may be studies that were not identified, as the
area of deprescribing has been poorly indexed historically. The
review included many studies that were nonrandomized and
many small RCTs of low quality. The limited methodological
rigour was signified by an uncertain or high risk of bias assess-
ment for most studies. Many of these studies aimed to assess
the feasibility of the deprescribing intervention rather than
the health or mortality outcomes, which was reflected in the in-
cluded studies with limited well-powered RCTs to assess health
outcomes. The follow-up durations, settings, age and health sta-
tus of participants were variable. These limitations make it diffi-
cult to generalize the findings broadly in practice, though
together they suggest that deprescribing in older adults is a field
that warrants further attention.
This review collates the growing body of research in the
field of deprescribing for older adults. However, as previously
discussed, there are substantial limitations to the available
study data. Rigorous large clinical trial data that implement
patient-specific deprescribing interventions are needed to
confirm the outcomes suggested in this review. Further re-
search is needed to understand which medications should
be deprescribed in which patients and at what time.
This study suggests that deprescribing needs to be consid-
ered for older people as a routine component of the ongoing
medication review process. Clinicians would benefit from
A. T. Page et al.

 deprescribing guidelines to support the implementation of
deprescribing in practice. In the meantime, clinicians can
use the data synthesized in this paper to inform decisions
about deprescribing in conjunction with practical algorithms
such as the CEASE acronym [16].
Conclusion
The available data suggest that patient-specific deprescribing
interventions to reduce polypharmacy may improve longev-
ity. Deprescribing is often achieved without adverse changes
in quality of life or health outcomes, which is helpful for
older adults. Though more research is needed, the current ev-
idence suggests that individualized interventions to reduce
inappropriate polypharmacy appear safe and feasible.
