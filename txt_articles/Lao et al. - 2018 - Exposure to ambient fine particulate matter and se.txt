ABSTRACT
Objectives environmental exposure to chemicals 
has been considered a potential factor contributing to 
deteriorated semen quality. However, previous literature 
on exposure to air pollution and semen quality is 
inconsistent. We therefore investigated the health effects 
of short-term and long-term exposure to fine particulate 
matter (PM2.5) on semen quality in taiwanese men from 
the general population.
Methods a cross-sectional study was conducted 
among 6475 male participants aged 15–49 years 
who participated in a standard medical examination 
programme in taiwan between 2001 and 2014. Semen 
quality was assessed according to the WHO 1999 
guidelines, including sperm concentration, total motility, 
progressive motility and morphology. three-month and 
2-year average PM2.5 concentrations were estimated at 
each participant’s address using a spatiotemporal model 
based on satellite-derived aerosol optical depth data. 
Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were used 
to examine the associations between PM2.5 and semen 
quality.
Results a robust association was observed between 
exposure to PM2.5 and decreased normal morphology. 
every increment of 5 µg/m3 in 2-year average PM2.5 was 
significantly associated with a decrease of 1.29% in 
sperm normal morphology and a 26% increased risk of 
having the bottom 10% of sperm normal morphology, 
after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders 
(p<0.001). On the other hand, an increment of 5 µg/
m3 in 2-year average PM2.5 was associated with an 
increase of 1.03×106/ml in sperm concentration and a 
10% decreased risk of being the bottom 10% of sperm 
concentration (both p<0.001). Similar results were found 
for 3-month PM2.5.
Conclusions exposure to ambient PM2.5 air pollution 
is associated with a lower level of sperm normal 
morphology and a higher level of sperm concentration.
InTROduCTIOn
Infertility is a global public health concern. It was 
estimated that 48.5 
million couples worldwide 
were infertile in 2010,1 with men contributing 
>50%.2 Environmental exposure to chemicals, 
including air pollutants, has been considered as 
one of the potential factors contributing to dete-
riorated semen quality,3 although the biological 
mechanisms remain uncertain. Many of the compo-
nents of ambient particulate matter (PM), such as 
heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs), have been shown to have toxic effects on 
semen quality in animal experiments.4–6 Oxidative 
stress induced by particles is also of the potential to 
disturb spermatogenesis.
Air pollution has become the world’s largest 
single environmental health risk. Exposure to 
ambient air pollution was estimated to cause 
>3.7 
million premature deaths worldwide in 2012.7 
PM is the most important air pollutant and affects 
more people than any other pollutants. There has 
been a large volume of epidemiological studies 
examining air pollution and its various health 
outcomes including birth defects. However, only a 
few studies with small samples have investigated the 
health effects of ambient PM on semen quality in 
humans, and the results have been inconsistent.8–15 
In addition, most of these studies focused on the 
acute or short-term effects, despite the fact that 
people generally suffer from prolonged exposure. 
Chronic, low-dose exposure may contribute to 
significant spermatogenesis impairment.16 More-
over, previous studies have generally estimated PM 
exposure using residential proximity to routine 
ground-level air pollution monitoring stations. The 
exposure is typically at the community (district, 
county or city) rather than the individual level, with 
the same exposure level assigned to all of a commu-
nity’s. This limitation may mask the variation, or 
Key messages
What is already known about this subject?
 
► The health effects of exposure to ambient 
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution on 
semen quality are not clear.
What are the new findings?
 
► We investigated the health effects of exposure 
to fine PM2.5 on semen quality.
How might this impact on policy or clinical 
practice in the foreseeable future?
 
► Both short-term (a spermatogenic cycle, 
3-month) and long-term (2-year) exposure to 
PM2.5 is associated with a lower level of sperm 
normal morphology and a higher level of sperm 
concentration.
 
► Exposure to ambient PM2.5 air pollution may

cause misclassification, thus leading to the inconsistent results of 
possible effects associated with PM air pollution. We therefore 
investigated the health effects of exposure (including long-term 
exposure and a spermatogenic cycle exposure) to fine PM— PM 
with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 
µm (PM2.5)—on semen 
quality in Taiwanese men from the general population, using a 
spatiotemporal model based on satellite-derived aerosol optical 
depth (AOD) data to estimate each participant’s PM2.5 exposure.
METHOdS
Study population
We studied male participants from a large cohort consisting 
of Taiwanese residents who participated in a standard medical 
examination programme run by a private firm (MJ Health 
Management Institution, Taipei, Taiwan). The details have 
been documented elsewhere.17–19 All procedures of the medical 
examination programme are approved according to ISO9001. 
Information on the medical examinations and related quality 
control can be accessed in the Technical Report of the MJ Health 
Research Foundation.20 In brief, the participants received a series 
of medical examinations including general physical examina-
tions, anthropometric measurements and biochemical tests of 
blood and urine. They also completed a standard self-adminis-
tered questionnaire survey. The semen quality assessment was 
voluntarily selected by the male participants. All of the partic-
ipants gave written informed consent when they joined the 
programme.
There were 1 
58 
542 male participants of reproductive age 
(15–49 years)21 who participated in the programme from 
2001 to 2014, when satellite AOD data from the US National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration were available for air 
pollution exposure estimation. During the study period, 6938 
participants voluntarily selected a semen quality examination. 
Generally, participants receiving semen measurements were 
comparable with all the 1 
58 
542 male participants in terms of 
age, educational level, smoking habits and body mass index 
(BMI) (see online supplementary table 1). Only 211 participants 
(3.0%) had multiple visits with two or more semen tests, there-
fore, repeated-measures analysis was not conducted. A total of 
463 participants with incomplete information were excluded (1 
on anthropometric measures, 3 on blood test results, 174 on 
educational level, 236 on lifestyle factors and 49 on PM2.5 expo-
sure estimates due to missing address) and 6475 participants 
were ultimately included in data analysis. The 463 excluded 
participants had similar age and semen parameters (all p>0.05).
Semen analysis and health examination
All of the participants were required to be sexually abstinent 
2–7 days before contributing semen samples. They were then 
instructed to collect semen samples in sterile containers by 
masturbation. If the sample was collected at home, the partic-
ipant was required to mark down the time and send the sample 
to laboratory immediately. No assessments were conducted if the 
duration was longer than 2 
hours after ejaculation. The semen 
samples were analysed at the MJ Health Screening Center’s 
central laboratory using standard protocols based on the WHO 
guidelines.21 Sperm concentration, total motility (percentage of 
motile sperm), progressive motility (percentage of sperm with 
progressive motility) and morphology (percentage of sperm of 
normal morphology) were assessed by trained technicians. The 
assessment began as soon as the ejaculates had liquefied, and 
were completed within 1 
hour of sample collection. An aliquot 
of the sample was put into a diluent solution and thoroughly 
mixed for the concentration assessment. A microcell counting 
chamber was used in six areas at a total microscope magnifica-
tion of ×400. For the motility assessment, a 10 
µL well-mixed 
sample from another aliquot was placed on a glass slide covered 
with a coverslip, and then examined at a total microscope 
magnification of ×400. T
wo hundred sperm cells were exam-
ined and classified into WHO motility categories A, B, C or D. 
The percentages of total motile sperm (A+B+C) and sperm with 
progressive motility (A+B) were calculated. Other smears were 
also prepared and air-dried, and then used for the morphology 
assessment. The WHO ‘strict’ criteria were used to examine 200 
sperm cells and the percentage of morphologically normal sperm 
was calculated.
Details of health examination for other variables were 
described in previous publications.17–19
Ambient PM2.5 estimate
A spatiotemporal model with high resolution (1×1 
km) was 
developed based on satellite AOD data to retrieve ground-level 
PM2.5 concentrations. The details have been described else-
where.17 This model was validated with ground-measured data 
from >70 monitoring stations in Taiwan from 2005 to 2014. 
(PM2.5 data were only available for three monitoring stations 
from 2000 to 2004. Thus, validations were not conducted for 
this period.) The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.72 to 
0.83 for yearly average PM2.5, and 0.70 to 0.81 for monthly 
average PM2.5 in different years (see online supplementary 
figure 1).
Each participant’s address was geo-coded into latitude and 
longitude, and address-specific monthly and yearly average 
PM2.5 concentrations were calculated afterwards. The esti-
mated annual average concentrations in Taiwan and at the 
participants’ locations are presented in figure 1. The south-
western and middle-eastern areas were generally the most 
and least heavily polluted, respectively. Most of the partici-
pants lived in the western area with apparent gradients of 
exposure. Because a spermatogenic cycle is around 3 months, 
we calculated 3-month average concentration (based on the

concentrations of the month of the medical examination and 
the 2 months before the medical examination) to assess the 
short-term effects. We also calculated 2-year average concen-
tration (based on the concentrations of the year of the medical 
examination and the year before the medical examination) 
as an indicator of long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 air 
pollution.
Statistical analysis
We used multivariable linear regression models to evaluate the 
associations between PM2.5 exposure and each semen quality 
parameter. Sperm concentration was log-transformed for data 
analysis due to its skewed distribution. A crude model without 
adjustment and three adjusted models were developed with 
potential confounders added gradually: model 1 was adjusted 
for age (years), education (high school or lower, college or 
university and postgraduate), smoking status (never, former 
and current), alcohol consumption (less than once/week, 1–3 
times/week and >3 times/week), exercise (<1 hour/week, 
1–2 hours/week and >2 hours/week) and occupational expo-
sure to dust and organic solvents (yes and no); model 2 was 
further adjusted for BMI (calculated as weight (kg) divided 
by the square of height (m)), systolic blood pressure, fasting 
plasma glucose and total cholesterol (all as continuous vari-
ables); model 3 was further adjusted for season (calendar 
season) and year of the medical examination (categorical 
variable). Short-term and long-term effects of PM2.5 exposure 
were analysed separately for comparison. The effect estimates 
were calculated for an increment of every 5 µg/m3 in average 
PM2.5 concentrations. The potential effect modifications by 
age group (<35 years vs ≥35 years), smoking (never vs ever) 
and overweight (BMI ≥25.0 vs <25.0 kg/m2) were examined 
by adding multiplicative interactions terms between PM2.5 and 
these factors. Each potential modifier was examined in sepa-
rate models.
We also used logistic regression models to investigate the 
associations between PM2.5 exposure and the risk of decreased 
semen parameters. Participants with the bottom 10% of the 
parameters were defined as having decreased semen parame-
ters. ORs were calculated for every 5 µg/m3 increment in PM2.5 
concentrations.
We further performed subgroup analyses stratified by normal 
and abnormal semen parameters according to reference values 
from the WHO guidelines.22 A total of 1524 participants were 
categorised into abnormal group because they had at least one 
of the four semen parameters lower than the following refer-
ence limits: 15×106/mL for sperm concentration, 40% for 
total motility, 32% for progressive motility and 4% for normal 
morphology. Consequently, the other 4951 participants were 
categorised into normal group.
All of the statistical analyses were performed using statis-
tical package R V
.3.2.3 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). A 
two-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically 
significant.
RESulTS
The general characteristics of the 6475 participants are presented 
in table 1. The average age was 31.9 years (SD: 4.3) and they 
were well educated. The majority never smoked (64.2%) and 
had alcohol use less than once a week (83.1%).
The semen characteristics by year are shown in table 2. For all 
of the participants, the mean (SD) values for sperm concentra-
tion, total motility, progressive motility and normal morphology 
were 54.0 (41.3)×106/mL, 65.3 (14.5) %, 46.8 (16.1) % and 
67.4 (14.9) %, respectively. Linear regression models were used 
to investigate the trends in semen parameters over the study 
period adjusting for age. An increasing trend was observed for 
progressive motility (p<0.001) and no trends were found for 
other three parameters (all p>0.05).
PM2.5 distribution among the participants is shown by year 
in figure 2 and locations of the study participants are shown 
in figure 1. The PM2.5 concentrations varied spatially among 
the participants within each year. The overall mean 3-month 
and 2-year PM2.5 concentrations were 25.8 (SD: 8.5) and 26.1 
(SD: 7.3) μg/m3, with IQRs of 7.9 and 5.9 µg/m3, respectively. 
The 3-month and the 2-year PM2.5 concentration were highly 
correlated (correlation coefficient=0.81, p<0.001).
The results of the regression models are summarised in 
table 3. Both short-term and long-term exposure had similar 
effects on sperm concentration and morphology. An incre-
ment of 5 µg/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with an increase in 
sperm concentration (1.02×106/mL for short-term exposure 
and 1.03×106/mL for long-term exposure) and reduced risk 
of decreased concentration (OR was 0.90 for both short-
term and long-term exposure). In contrast, an increment of 
5 µg/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with a decrease in normal 
morphology (0.83% for short-term exposure and 1.29% for 
long-term exposure) and increased risk of decreased normal 
morphology (ORs were 1.18 for short-term exposure and 1.26 
for long-term exposure). There were no associations observed 
for progressive motility. Regarding the total motility, the asso-
ciation was not significant for short-term exposure in logistic 
regression analysis.
No significant effect modifications were observed for age 
group, smoking or overweight among the participants in relation

to the association between 3-month or 2-year PM2.5 and semen 
parameters (all p>0.10).
The subgroup analyses generally yielded similar results 
(see online supplementary table 2 for participants with normal 
semen parameters and online supplementary table 3 for partici-
pants with abnormal semen parameters).
dISCuSSIOn
To our knowledge, this is the largest study investigating the 
health effects of PM2.5 air pollution on semen quality. It is also 
the first study considering the effects of both long-term expo-
sure and short-term exposure (in a spermatogenic cycle). We 
find it is highly correlated between long-term and short-term 
exposure in this population. Because air pollution is quite stable 
over the study period, we speculate the exposure in a spermato-
genic cycle is similar to the long-term exposure, and the effects 
are more likely the reflections of long-term exposure. We find 
robust associations between PM2.5 exposure and semen quality. 
Every increment of 5 
µg/m3 in 2-year average PM2.5 is associ-
ated with a decrease of 1.29% in sperm normal morphology 
and a 26% increased risk of having the bottom 10% of sperm 
normal morphology, after adjusting for a wide range of potential 
confounders. In contrast, every increment of 5 
µg/m3 in 2-year 
average PM2.5 is associated with an increase of 1.03×106/mL in 
sperm concentration and a 10% decreased risk of having the 
bottom 10% of sperm concentration. The associations remain 
robust in the analyses by taking into account a wide range of 
potential confounders, using different statistical methods (linear 
and logistic regression) and categorising participants into normal 
and abnormal groups.
The negative association between air pollution and normal 
morphology was also reported in the Teplice Program in 
Czech Republic,11 and in two recent studies in China and 
Poland.10 13 The average time course in these studies was 3-month 
concentration. However, long-term exposure was not taken into 
account. It is not clear it was a short-term exposure or a surro-
gate of long-term exposure. Three studies in the USA, which the 
average time ranged from daily to 3-month concentration, did 
not observe significant associations.8 9 12 Hansen et al attributed 
the non-association to the relatively low level of air pollution.9
The mechanism of how air pollution adversely affects sperm 
morphology is not fully understood. Air pollution-induced oxida-
tive stress has been hypothesised to be one of the contributors to 
sperm dysfunction. A wide range of air pollutants, such as O3, 
NO2 and particles, can induce increased oxidative stress,23 which 
is related to the excessive production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS). ROS and their metabolites can damage DNA, lipids and 
proteins, altering enzymatic systems and cell apoptosis and, ulti-
mately, lead to decreasing semen quality.24 In addition, PM2.5 
may carry multiple trace elements and PAHs. The toxic effects of 
metals such as lead and cadmium on spermatogenesis have been 
well documented in animal models5 6 and confirmed in human

Effect estimates were calculated for an increment of 5 µg/m3 in PM2.5 concentrations.
*Crude model had no adjustment; model 1 was adjusted for age, educational level, smoking status, alcohol drinking, exercise and occupational exposure to asbestos and organic solvent; model 2 was further adjusted for body mass index, 
systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol levels; model 3 was further adjusted for season and year of medical examination.
†Beta-coefficients were presented for continuous variables and ORs were presented for dichotomous variables.
‡Concentration was log-transformed to achieve approximate normality for the data analysis and then the geometric coefficients were transformed back for presentation.

studies.25 PAHs, a group of compounds that includes several endo-
crine disruptors, can also cause sperm alterations through its effects 
on the hypothalamic pituitary axis and testicular spermatogenesis.4
We observed a positive association between exposure and 
sperm concentration. This finding is not in line with previous 
studies, most of which have not observed significant associations 
between air pollution and sperm concentration.8 9 11 Sokol et al 
reported a negative association between O3 and sperm concentra-
tion.12 A recent study by Zhou et al reported a positive association 
between sperm concentration and PM10,13 which is similar to our 
study. Regarding motility, the associations also remain uncertain. 
Hammoud et al and Selevan et al observed a negative association,8 11 
whereas no associations were observed in other studies.10 12 13 The 
reasons for the positive associations between exposure and sperm 
concentration in the present study need to be elucidated by further 
studies. We hypothesise that the slight increases in sperm concen-
tration are a compensatory phenomenon. Numerous studies have 
demonstrated the hormesis phenomenon on chemical aerosol 
exposure and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising 
hormone (LH).26 Low-dose exposure may increase the levels of 
FSH and LH, which strengthen spermatogenesis, thus increasing 
sperm concentration. Further studies are warranted to investigate 
the underlying mechanism.
We did not observe decline trends in semen quality over the study 
period. Although the trend of progressive motility was statistically 
significant, the figures fluctuated over time. The reported global 
downwards trend in semen quality has not been concluded because 
previous studies exhibit great heterogeneity due to geographical 
and/or ethnic variations and different study designs and method-
ological standards.27 In the present study, we adjusted for the year 
in the data analyses and the adjustment had few effects.
Compared with previous studies, our study has some important 
strengths. The large sample size enabled us to have sufficient power 
to detect the small effects by low-dose exposure. Furthermore, our 
participants were from a general population rather than being men 
from infertility clinics. The affluent information on a wide range 
of potential confounders and modifiers enabled us to consider the 
effects of these factors. Another advantage is that we used accurate, 
high-resolution satellite-based technology to estimate PM2.5 expo-
sure at the individual level. All of the previous studies estimated 
air pollution exposure at the community level, which may mask 
exposure variation and result in misclassification. This technology 
also enables us to obtain short-term and long-term exposure for 
comparison.
However, there are limitations. First, all of the participants 
in this study were volunteers, and information on their history 
of infertility diseases was not available. We therefore could not 
exclude the possible influence of infertility disorders for some of 
the participants, but it should not affect our conclusions because 
PM2.5 exposure was unlikely to be differentially distributed among 
fertile and infertile participants. In addition, we got similar results 
in subgroup analyses stratified by normal and abnormal semen 
parameters. Given that the participants were well educated, we 
should be cautious when generalising the findings into general 
populations. Second, most participants (97%) had only one semen 
measurement and this limited us to perform a repeated-measures 
analysis, which would address within-person variations over time. 
Another limitation is that we only estimated ambient PM2.5 levels. 
Information on indoor PM2.5 was not available. Despite evidence 
that indoor and outdoor PM levels are highly correlated,28 29 we 
cannot exclude the possible influence of indoor PM sources on 
some of the participants. In addition, the PM2.5 concentrations 
were calculated at the fixed addresses and participants’ activity 
pattern was not taken into account. More advanced techniques 
technologies are needed for more accurate exposure assessment. 
Our study also lacked data on other gaseous air pollutants and 
future studies need to take it into consideration. Finally, the long-
term and short-term (a spermatogenic cycle) exposure are highly 
correlated in the present study. We are not able to distinguish the 
effects of short-term exposure.
COnCluSIOnS
In conclusion, we found a robust association between expo-
sure to PM2.5 air pollution and low percentage of sperm normal 
morphology in reproductive-age men. Although the effect esti-
mates are small and the significance might be negligible in a clin-
ical setting, this is an important public health challenge. Given the 
ubiquity of exposure to air pollution, a small effect size of PM2.5 on 
sperm normal morphology may result in a significant number of 
couples with infertility. We advocate global strategies on mitigation 
of air pollution to improve reproductive health. In contradiction to 
the negative associations with morphology, we observed exposure 
to PM2.5 is associated with a higher level of sperm concentrations. 
We speculate the positive associations may be due to the compen-
sation mechanism. Further studies are warranted to investigate this 
phenomenon and its underlying mechanism.
