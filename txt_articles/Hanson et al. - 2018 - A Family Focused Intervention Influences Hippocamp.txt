The stressors associated with poverty increase the risks for externalizing psychopathology; however, specific
patterns of neurobiology and higher self-regulation may buffer against these effects. This study leveraged a
randomized control trial, aimed at increasing self-regulation at ~11 years of age. As adults, these same indi-
viduals completed functional MRI scanning (Mage = 24.88 years; intervention n = 44; control n = 49). Func-
tional connectivity between the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was examined in relation to
the intervention, gains in self-regulation, and present-day externalizing symptoms. Increased connectivity
between these brain areas was noted in the intervention group compared to controls. Furthermore, individual
gains in self-regulation, instilled by the intervention, statistically explained this brain difference. These results
begin to connect neurobiological and psychosocial markers of risk and resiliency.
Individuals developing in impoverished environ-
ments are at heightened risk for a host of physi-
cal and mental health difficulties across the life
span (Shonkoff et al., 2012). Studies indicate that
children living in poverty are at increased risk for
subsequent aggression, oppositional behavior, and
other forms of externalizing psychopathology (Pio-
trowska, Stride, Croft, & Rowe, 2015). These neg-
ative outcomes are likely due to the multiple risk
factors associated with poverty, and persist into
adulthood (Jensen, Berens, & Nelson, 2017). Child-

probability of first-onset mood, behavioral, and
substance abuse disorders at all stages of the life
course (McLaughlin et al., 2011), even when con-
trolling for income levels in adulthood (Evans &
Cassells,
2014).

cally reduced children’s symptoms of conduct and
oppositional defiant disorders (Costello, Compton,
Keeler, & Angold, 2003).
Even though these consistent links exist, not all
children living in poverty will develop externalizing
psychopathology. Indeed, research has begun to

 identify many potential markers of risk and resi-
liency. From a psychosocial perspective, differences
in self-regulation may be important for understand-
ing the circumstances under which poverty does
(and does not) become connected to externalizing
outcomes (Blair & Raver, 2015; Evans & Kim, 2012).
Self-regulation is a multifaceted constellation of
skills that enables the control of attention and emo-
tion, for the purposes of setting, maintaining, and
achieving goals (Bridgett, Burt, Edwards, & Deater-
Deckard, 2015; Nigg, 2016). A growing body of
longitudinal studies have found that better self-regu-
lation in childhood is related to fewer externalizing
problems, including lower rates of antisocial person-
ality
disorder,
less
interpersonal
conflict,
and
reduced likelihood of being involved in criminal
activity (Caspi, Moffitt, Newman, & Silva, 1996;
Moffitt et al., 2011). In the aggregate, poverty is
associated with lower self-regulation abilities, but
there is considerable variability in these traits within
low socioeconomic status (SES) populations (Blair &
Raver, 2012, 2015; Montroy, Bowles, Skibbe, McClel-
land, & Morrison, 2016). In addition, there is consis-
tent
evidence
of
protective
effects,
whereby
individuals from low SES backgrounds with better
self-regulatory skills have lower rates of externaliz-
ing psychopathology compared with their demo-
graphically similar peers (Buckner, Mezzacappa, &
Beardslee, 2003; Flouri, Midouhas, & Joshi, 2014;
Lengua, Bush, Long, Kovacs, & Trancik, 2008).
Neurobiologically informed research has simi-
larly begun to identify brain markers of risk and
resiliency. Using neuroimaging, many studies have
reported structural differences in the hippocampus
and ventromedial portions of the prefrontal cortex
(vmPFC) in relation to exposure to aspects of pov-
erty, including lower household income and social
status (Gianaros
et al.,
2007;
Hanson,
Chandra,
Wolfe, & Pollak, 2011; Hanson et al., 2015; Noble
et al., 2012, 2015). Past research implicates both of
these brain structures as important for socioemo-
tional functioning (Davidson & McEwen, 2012).
Interestingly,
structural
differences
in
the
hip-
pocampus and vmPFC appear to mediate the rela-
tion between childhood poverty and externalizing
symptoms, with smaller volumes in each region
relating
to
greater
problem
behaviors
(Hanson
et al., 2015; Holz et al., 2014). Few studies have,
however, examined resting state functional connec-
tivity,
with
the
preponderance
of
past
work
focused on brain structure in relation to exposure
to aspects of poverty. One exception is a recent
study by Sripada, Swain, Evans, Welsh, and Liber-
zon
(2014)
that
found
childhood
poverty
was
related to reduced resting state functional connec-
tivity between the hippocampus, the vmPFC, and
the posterior cingulate.
The limited work examining functional brain
interactions is a major limitation, as complex behav-
ioral processes likely arise through multiple brain
regions interacting and sharing information with
each other (van den Heuvel & Pol, 2010). With the
hippocampus and vmPFC, functional interactions
between these regions may be important for using
previously acquired information in goal-directed
behavior (Murty, Calabro, & Luna, 2016). For exam-
ple, Gluth, Sommer, Rieskamp, and B€
uchel (2015)
showed that decision making is limited by memory
constraints, and this is associated with functional
connectivity between the hippocampus and vmPFC.
Studies using resting state connectivity could fill in
these important gaps and provide new insights
about the impact of experience on brain organiza-
tion. Spontaneous brain activity (assessed at rest) is
highly correlated between multiple brain regions,
predicts task-response properties of neural circuits,
and can identify subjects’ aptitude for different cog-
nitive tasks (Fox & Greicius, 2010).
Turning back to self-regulation, although this
characteristic can exert protective effects, it is not a
fixed trait and this may have major implications for
developmental
outcomes.
Psychosocial
interven-
tions have uniquely noted that improving parenting
practices facilitates children’s early development of
self-regulation, and this can then serve as a founda-
tion for positive functioning in multiple domains
and contexts (Brody et al., 2011; Chang, Shaw,
Dishion, Gardner, & Wilson, 2014). One notable
example is the Strong African American Families
(SAAF) intervention—a family skills training pro-
gram aimed at mitigating the negative effects of
poverty and life stress on rural African American
youths through a focus on youths, parents, and
their family interactions (Brody, 2016). This inter-
vention identified malleable, proximal parenting
processes in a youth’s immediate family context
that could facilitate the development of responsive–
supportive parent–child relationships; these sup-
portive relationships could then enhance children’s
development of self-regulation. In keeping with
models of developmental cascades (Masten & Cic-
chetti,
2010),
changes
in
parenting
may
cause
youth: to adopt parental norms, develop the ability
to govern their own behavior in the absence of
external supervision, and approach stressful life
events through direct action rather than through
avoidance or anger. Past work (e.g., Brody, Murry,
& McNair, 2005) has found support for these ideas,
2
Hanson et al.
 noting that intervention-induced changes in parent-
ing were linked with changes in responsive–sup-
portive parent–child relationships and then youth
self-regulation. In addition to changes in self-regula-
tion, this intervention has been found to exert
strong and longlasting effects on a host of other
psychosocial outcomes—with major reductions in
conduct problems and lessened alcohol use after
participation in the program (Brody, Chen, Kogan,
Murry, & Brown, 2010; Brody, Kogan, Chen, &
Murry, 2008). Importantly, these effects were found
long after completion of the program, with differ-
ences seen 2–5 years after intervention delivery. In
addition, nearly a decade after the program, differ-
ences
in
inflammation
and
other
health-related
biomarkers have been found for participants com-
pared to controls (Brody, Yu, & Beach, 2016). Col-
lectively, these findings underscore that fostering
positive parenting can yield important self-regula-
tory gains in children. Changes in self-regulation
may buffer against the psychosocial disadvantages
that beset children in poverty and can foster posi-
tive mental health, as well as physical, outcomes.
Indeed, these self-regulatory gains could carry for-
ward, facilitating exposure to more stimulating
experiences
across
development
that
promote
brain connectivity and other positive patterns of
neurobiology.
Interestingly, in recent neurobiological work in
the SAAF cohort, the intervention was found to
bolster against the adverse effects of poverty. In
this work, and similar to other studies, years spent
in poverty during childhood were associated with
smaller adult hippocampal volumes; however, in
those who completed the intervention, this relation
was not seen, suggesting exposure to prevention
programming in childhood could have lasting pro-
tective effects on brain development into adult-
hood (Brody et al., 2017). Paralleling preclinical
work, smaller volumes were found in the dentate
gyrus (DG) for individuals living in poverty who
did not complete the intervention. Alterations in
the DG are notable for a number of reasons. The
DG is central to pattern separation and comple-
tion,
processes
that
aid
in
adaptively
guiding
behavior (Nakashiba et al., 2012). More broadly,
the DG is associated with affective regulation and
the pathophysiology of mood disorders, contribut-
ing to stress and emotional responses, and serving
as the main gateway of information for the other
portions of the hippocampus (Fa et al., 2014).
Here, we return to the SAAF study to investigate
links between a psychosocial intervention, neurobi-
ology, and the behavioral gains instilled by this
preventive programming. Given that this random-
ized control trial was designed to increase self-regu-
latory abilities in low-SES African Americans from
the rural South, we first probed whether childhood
self-regulation was improved in a subsample of
intervention
participants
who
were
recontacted
later in adulthood (Hypothesis 1). We, next, exam-
ined
resting
state
functional
brain
differences
related
to
participation
in
the
SAAF
program.
Given the recent results noting structural brain dif-
ferences in the DG in SAAF participants, we set out
to investigate potential alterations in the resting
state connectivity of this hippocampal subregion
related to SAAF. On the basis of the past research
findings, we predicted that the intervention would
be
related
to
increased
functional
connectivity
between the DG and vmPFC in the intervention
group, compared to control participants (Hypothesis
2). We, next, centered in on the behavioral target of
the
SAAF
intervention,
namely
developmental
gains in self-regulation. Given that SAAF improved
this capacity during development, we wanted to
investigate if gains in self-regulation (instilled by
the intervention) would mediate the group differ-
ences in functional connectivity (Hypothesis 3). This
would be an initial step to understand the develop-
mental factors potentially influencing neurobiologi-
cal differences in adulthood. We finally, aimed to
connect developmental gains, neurobiology, and
present-day
behavior
by
examining
relations
between brain connectivity, self-regulatory gains,
and present-day externalizing problems. Motivated
by
past
research,
we
predicted
that
higher
connectivity between the DG and vmPFC would be
related
to
lessened
present-day
externalizing
problems (Hypothesis 4).
Method
Participants
At its inception, the original SAAF sample was
667 African American families, randomly recruited
from rural communities in Georgia when the partic-
ipants
were
approximately
11.2 years
of
age
(SD = 0.34).
At
age
25,
123
individuals
were
recruited from this larger cohort that had partici-
pated in the SAAF randomized prevention trial. For
this work, participants were recontacted at random,
stratified by gender and treatment assignment, and
screened for standard imaging contraindications
and right handedness until a targeted sample size
was
reached
(Mage = 24.88 years;
SD = 0.61;
see
Table 1). Additional information about the original
Self-Regulation and Neurobiology
3
 SAAF sample and the recruitment of the neu-
roimaging subsample is noted in Supporting Infor-
mation. The original target sample size was 100
participants with usable data on a working memory
functional MRI (fMRI) task that the subjects also
completed. This resulted in a slightly larger sample
of
participants
with
resting
state
fMRI
scans
(n = 123). During this visit, participants were wel-
comed by project staff, explained study protocols,
and
provided
informed
consent.
Participants
reviewed MRI clearance forms and were oriented to
the MRI scanner. Participants were compensated
$210, plus travel reimbursement, for this 2–3 hr lab-
oratory visit. The University of Georgia’s Institu-
tional Review Board reviewed and approved all
study procedures.
Thirty participants were excluded for failure to
complete MRI scanning (n = 4), excessive motion in
structural images (n = 4), artifact and signal drop-
out in fMRI (n = 3), or excessive movement during
resting state imaging (n = 19; quality control cutoffs
noted below in Image Preprocessing section). This
yielded
93
participants
with
usable
MRI
data.
Forty-four of these participants (46.8%) had been
assigned randomly to the SAAF condition, whereas
49 participants (52.1%) were assigned randomly to
the control
condition as youths. As shown in
Table 2, participants who did or did not take part
in the imaging study at 25 years of age as a func-
tion of intervention group assignment at 11 years
of age were similar for family SES disadvantage at
age 11, gender, as well as on self-control/delin-
quency at pretest. This suggests the neuroimaging
subsample was similar to the broader SAAF (full)
sample. Information related to this point is also
detailed in Supporting Information.
Procedures
SAAF Intervention
As youth, intervention participants completed
the SAAF prevention program. This intervention
consisted of 7 consecutive, 2-hr weekly meetings
held at community facilities, with separate skill-
building curricula for youths and for their primary
caregivers, and a family curriculum. The caregiver
sessions emphasized parenting skills, including the
consistent provision of instrumental and emotional
support, high levels of monitoring and control,
adaptive racial socialization strategies, and methods
for communicating about sex and alcohol use.
Youth sessions focused on forming goals for the
future and making plans to attain them, resistance
efficacy skills, and adaptive behaviors to use when
encountering racism. Details regarding the pro-
gram, as well as associated outcomes for the inter-
vention, are noted elsewhere (Brody, 2016; Brody,
Yu, Chen, Beach, & Miller, 2016; Kogan et al., 2012;
Miller, Brody, Yu, & Chen, 2014).

 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Collection
Structural
(high-resolution
T1-weighted
MRI;
voxel size = 1 mm3) and functional resting state
(two scans using single-shot gradient echo pulse
T2* sequence; voxel size = 3.5 mm3) images were
acquired with a General Electric 3.0 T MRI scanner
(Milwaukee, WI, USA). Additional technical infor-
mation about these acquisitions are noted in Sup-
porting Information. During the resting state scan,
participants were instructed to keep their eyes open
and fixed on a crosshair. After the scan, participants
were asked about adherence to these instructions
and all individuals reported being awake, with eyes
open and fixed on the crosshairs.
Assessments and Measures
Before and after the intervention, participants
completed a number of self-report measures of
sociodemographics and psychosocial functioning.
To control for socioeconomic risk, six dichotomous
variables
formed
a
socioeconomic
disadvantage
composite at pretest. A score of 1 was assigned to
each of the following: family poverty based on fed-
eral guidelines, primary caregiver unemployment,
receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families,
primary caregiver single parenthood, primary care-
giver education level less than high school gradua-
tion, and caregiver-reported inadequacy of family
income. The scores were summed to form the index.
This factor and a dummy-coded indicator for sex
were used as control variables in data analyses.
Youth Measures of Self-Regulation
To assess self-regulation, parents completed the
12-item Self-Regulation Inventory (SRI; Humphrey,
1982) and the 12-item delinquency subscale from the
Child Behavior Checklist (D-CBCL; Achenbach &
Edelbrock, 1983), before (pretest) and after (posttest)
the SAAF intervention. Each questionnaire involved
Likert scale ratings and example items for both scales
are noted in Supporting Information. We totaled par-
ents’ ratings from the SRI and D-CBCL and stan-
dardized scores from each questionnaire. These
measures were highly correlated (rs = �.54 at pretest
and �.57 at posttest, p < .001). Next, the delinquency
scores were then subtracted from the self-regulation
scores to form a youth self-regulation composite. For
this measure, higher values indicated greater gains
in self-regulation. Posttest self-regulation measures
were administered on average 3 months after the
end of the intervention (M = 3.32 months, SD =
1.43), and the average interval between pretest and
posttest
was
approximately
8 months
(M = 7.82
months, SD = 1.84). Using these measures (pre and
postintervention), a latent difference score was calcu-
lated in Mplus (Muthen & Muthen, 2012). The
change in self-regulation between pre- and postinter-
vention was modeled with the following settings: (a)
the self-regulation variable at postintervention was
the single indicator of the latent difference scores (the
loading was set to 1 without measurement error); (b)
the self-regulation variable at postintervention was
regressed on the self-regulation variable at preinter-
vention and the path coefficient was set to 1; and (c)
the latent difference scores were regressed on self-
regulation variable at preintervention and the path
coefficient was estimated. Additional information
about these procedures are noted in Supporting
Information.
Present-Day Externalizing Symptoms
To assess present day behavioral problems, we
focused on total externalizing symptoms from the
Adult Self-Report (ASR; Achenbach & Rescorla,
2003), by combining responses about rule-breaking
behavior, as well as aggressive behavior (36 items
total). This measure was administered near the time
of the neuroimaging session (additional information
regarding the ASR is noted in Supporting Informa-
tion).
Measures of Brain Connectivity
All functional imaging data were preprocessed
and
analyzed
with
the
Analysis
of
Functional
NeuroImages (AFNI) software package (Cox, 1996).
Preprocessing was keeping with current best prac-
tices for dealing with motion in resting state fMRI
data (Hallquist, Hwang, & Luna, 2013; Power, Sch-
laggar, & Petersen, 2015). These steps included
removing the first four functional volumes to allow
for blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal
stabilization, “despiking” outlier volumes, slice-time
correction, intrasubject registration, motion censor-
ing,
intrasubject
registration
to
MNI-152
space
(Montreal Neurological Institute), and partialling
out nuisance regressors (eroded ventricle and white
matter
masks;
24
motion
parameters;
temporal
bandpass filtering from 0.009–0.08 Hz). Participants
were excluded if > 20% of frames were censored
(n = 19), yielding at least 6 min of resting state
data. Additional details available in Supporting
Information. Next, based on past work finding
alterations
in
the
left
DG,
a
probabilistic
Self-Regulation and Neurobiology
5
 hippocampal atlas was used to examine subdivi-
sions of the hippocampus (Kulaga-Yoskovitz et al.,
2015). For each participant, a regression was per-
formed including the left DG time course, generat-
ing subject-level maps of the correlations between
this region’s time course and every other voxel’s
time course. Given our a priori interest in DG-
vmPFC
interactions,
we
completed
voxel-wise
analyses within a vmPFC mask derived from Neu-
roSynth (Yarkoni, Poldrack, Nichols, Van Essen, &
Wager, 2011). Two-hundred fifty studies in the
Neurosynth database consistently used the term
“ventromedial prefrontal,” and this was used to
generate a mask to limit our neuroimaging search
space (total number of voxel in mask = 5925).
In our analyses, intervention status was dummy-
coded (SAAF = 1; control = 0), and subject-level
correlation maps were compared. To correct for
multiple
comparisons,
we
deployed
AFNI’s
3dClustSim using cluster-size thresholding based
on Monte Carlo simulation and new, mixed-model
(non-Gaussian) auto-correlation functions and used
an
initial,
uncorrected
statistical
threshold
of
p < .001 (Cox, Chen, Glen, Reynolds, & Taylor,
2017). Based on this threshold, the number of com-
parisons in our mask, and the smoothness of our
imaging data, a minimum cluster size of 18 voxels
was required to have a corrected p ≤ .05. For any
regions above this threshold, mean functional con-
nectivity estimates were then extracted by averag-
ing across every voxel in each regional cluster.
Exploratory analyses were also completed using a
whole-brain approach (with an initial statistical
threshold of p < .001 uncorrected and a minimum
cluster size of 50 voxels was employed to balance
Type I vs. II error). Further details available in Sup-
porting Information.
Analytic Approach
To examine effects of the intervention, changes
in parent reported self-regulation behaviors from
pre- to posttest were compared between interven-
tion and control groups (dummy-coded) using
analysis of variance models implemented in the
JMP suite of programs (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Next,
a
mediation
model
using
path
analyses
tested whether the SAAF intervention (X) was
associated with resting state connectivity differ-
ences (Y) and whether the observed association
was mediated by change in self-regulation (M).
Change in self-regulation was operationalized as
a
latent
difference
score
reflecting
differences
from pre- to posttest in self-regulation scores.
Statistical testing of mediation was done by non-
parametric
bootstrapping,
with
95%
confidence
intervals
for
indirect
mediation
effects.
This
model included family SES disadvantage at age
11 and gender as covariates. Finally, the contem-
poraneous associations of resting state connectiv-
ity with externalizing behaviors were examined
and the indirect pathway from SAAF interven-
tion
to
externalizing
behaviors
through
brain
connectivity
was
tested.
Of
note,
analyses
focused on other psychosocial variables, as well
as measures of self-regulation at different devel-
opmental epochs, were also completed and are
detailed in Supporting Information.
Results
Behavioral Impacts of the SAAF Intervention
As noted in past reports, participants who com-
pleted the SAAF intervention had better develop-
mental outcomes compared to control participants.
As youth, those who completed the SAAF inter-
vention had higher gains in self-regulation, com-
pared
to
control
participants
at
approximately
11 years
of
age.
This
was
found
for
parental
reports pre and post the randomized control trial,
F(1, 87) = 5.485, p = .021, in support of Hypothesis
1. As adults, participants who completed the SAAF
intervention also had lower rates of total external-
izing behavior, at approximately 25 years of age,
again compared to control participants (t = �2.64,
p = .009). These results are shown in Figures S1
and S2.
Functional Connectivity Differences Between
Intervention and Control Groups
Analyses of resting-state fMRI data revealed that
the functional coupling for the DG differed for the
SAAF intervention and control groups. Specifically,
connectivity between the left DG and the right
vmPFC (x = +6, y = +44, z = �6, max voxel t = 4.81,
p = .05 corrected) was greater for SAAF compared to
control participants (related to Hypothesis 2). These
differences
are
shown
in
Figure 1.
Exploratory
(whole-brain) analyses revealed group-related con-
nectivity differences between the DG and two brain
regions: (a) higher DG-right vmPFC connectivity (in
line with our a priori analyses) for SAAF compared
to control participants; and (b) lower DG-right infe-
rior parietal lobule connectivity, again for SAAF
compared to control participants. Information about
these effects are noted in Table 3.

 Mediation Analyses Connecting Intervention-Related
Behavioral and Brain Changes
We next tested the hypothesis that the higher
vmPFC-DG connectivity for SAAF, compared to
control, participants, was attributable to interven-
tion-related increases in self-regulation (Valente &
MacKinnon, 2017). First, we estimated structural
coefficients reflecting the association between SAAF
status and increased self-regulation (Path A) and
increased self-regulation and vmPFC-DG connectiv-
ity (Path B). Of note, this self-regulation was a
latent difference score measuring changes from pre-
to posttest. Second, we quantified the indirect or
mediating effect of changes in self-regulation as the
product of these two coefficients (A 9 B). Nonpara-
metric bootstrapping (1,000 times) was used to
obtain the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) con-
fidence intervals of the indirect effect (Preacher &
Hayes, 2004). Furthermore, to be considered a
mediator, the strength of the direct relation between
the predictor and outcome (Path C) must be dimin-
ished when the mediator is entered into the analy-
sis (Path C0). Gender and family SES risk at pretest
were controlled in the model.
The results of this analysis suggested that higher
vmPFC-DG connectivity among SAAF participants
(compared to controls) were partially attributable to
increased self-regulation (Hypothesis 3). The positive
coefficient for Path A indicates that participation in
SAAF was associated with statistically significant
increases in self-regulation. The positive coefficient
for Path B indicates that participants’ vmPFC-DG
connectivity at age 25 were positively associated
with increases in self-regulation. Multiplying these
coefficients yielded an indirect mediated effect of
.024 with a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval
(CI) of 0.003, 0.065. Thus, the indirect pathway
from SAAF to increases in self-regulation to higher
vmPFC-DG connectivity was statistically significant.
Nevertheless,
SAAF
remained
associated
with
vmPFC-DG connectivity even after accounting for
changes in self-regulation, as the significant Path C0
coefficient indicates.
We further examined contemporaneous associa-
tions between DG-vmPFC connectivity and external-
izing behaviors by including the pathway that brain

portion of the ventromedial portions of the prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the DG emerged using a restricted (a priori) mask. Similar
results were found if a larger, whole-prefrontal cortex mask was also used. The right-hand side of this graphic shows the functional
connectivity differences between groups. Strong African American Families (SAAF) participants are shown with an orange outlined bar,
and control participants are shown with a green outlined bar. The units for this graph are Fisher’s Z-transformed correlation coeffi-

 connectivity predicted externalizing behaviors at age
25 (Path D). The negative coefficient for Path D indi-
cates that higher brain connectivity (in adulthood)
was associated with lower externalizing behaviors
(Hypothesis 4). Furthermore, the indirect pathway

connectivity was statistically significant (indirect

(95%

Figure 2
depicts these findings.
To probe the specificity of these effects, we first
completed similar mediation analyses for parietal
lobe-DG connectivity (using SAAF intervention sta-
tus, latent difference scores of self-regulation gains,
and present-day externalizing symptoms). No rela-
tions were found for this regional connectivity and
change in self-regulation and/or present-day exter-
nalizing symptoms (all p’s > .12, additional details
in Supporting Information). We also completed
supplemental analyses to examine if other psy-
chosocial variables (e.g., family chaos; measures of
the parent–child relationship) might explain vari-
ability in vmPFC-DG connectivity. Results indicated
no significant association between any of the psy-
chosocial variables and measures of adult brain
connectivity (additional details in Supporting Infor-
mation). Finally, analyses using measures of self-
regulation from other developmental epochs are
also noted in Supporting Information.
Discussion
Here, we report on a unique study that combined
longitudinal assessments, a randomized control trial
intervention (SAAF), and rich measures of neurobi-
ology. These sources of data were leveraged to
determine how this prevention program impacted
behavior during childhood and then brain function-
ing in adulthood. In line with past results (Brody
et al., 2008), we first find that individuals who
participated in the SAAF intervention had improve-
ments in self-regulation shortly after the interven-
tion. Drilling into neurobiology, we found that
individuals who participated in SAAF had higher
Figure 2. The figure shows our structural equation model with intervention status, gain in self-regulation, brain connectivity, and pre-
sent-day externalizing symptoms. To unpack these effects, higher brain connectivity between the hippocampus and ventromedial por-
tions of the prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was found for the Strong African American Families (SAAF) intervention participants (Path C).
Participation in SAAF was associated with statistically significant increases in self-regulation (Path A). Path B indicated that higher
brain connectivity at age 25 was positively associated with increase in self-regulation (a latent difference score). Path C0 indicates that
increases in self-regulation partially explained the relation between intervention status and higher brain connectivity at age 25. DG-
vmPFC connectivity was associated with externalizing behaviors at age 25 (higher connectivity relating to lower symptoms; Path D).
Finally, the indirect pathway from SAAF to externalizing behaviors through brain connectivity was statistically significant (Path
A 9 Path B 9 Path D + Path C0 9 Path D). *p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.

 coupling between the DG and vmPFC, two brain
regions involved with socioemotional functioning
and self-regulation, compared to control partici-
pants. Interestingly, gains in self-regulation partially
(statistically) explained the group differences noted
in DG-vmPFC connectivity. Finally, we also found
that individual differences in this functional cou-
pling related to present-day externalizing symp-
tomatology. All of these results were in keeping
with our study predictions.
These
findings
converge
with
earlier
reports
describing structural alterations in the hippocampus
and vmPFC in individuals exposed to childhood
poverty, or who suffered other forms of early
adversity (Hanson et al., 2010; Hanson et al., 2015;
Holz et al., 2014). Similarly, longitudinal research
suggests that parenting impacts hippocampal devel-
opment, with greater parental warmth and support
predicting larger hippocampal volumes later in
development (Luby, Belden, Harms, Tillman, &
Barch, 2016; Luby et al., 2012). Functionally, child-
hood poverty has been associated with reduced
hippocampal activation in adulthood, as well as
decreased
functional
connectivity
between
left
amygdala and portions of the prefrontal cortex
(Javanbakht et al., 2015; Liberzon et al., 2015). In
addition, work by Sripada et al. (2014) found child-
hood poverty was related to reduced functional
connectivity between the hippocampus, the vmPFC,
and the posterior cingulate in adulthood. Building
upon this earlier research, we capitalized here on
data from a randomized trial, whose design pro-
vides additional leverage for making causal infer-
ences
about
self-regulation,
brain function,
and
psychosocial risk and resiliency.
By combining rich assessments of neurobiology
and psychosocial processes, our results suggests
malleable neural systems involved with self-regula-
tion, a foundational skill for behavioral develop-
ment (Baumeister & Vohs, 2004). Contextualizing
this project with data from developmental science,
we feel our results fit with ideas of “developmental
cascades.” The SAAF intervention impacted parent-
ing practices and these changes then precipitated
changes in self-regulation. At the start of this pre-
ventative program, youth were still developing their
self-regulatory capabilities and this time period is
also a critical time of brain development (Belsky &
De Haan, 2011). Changes in self-regulation may
then facilitate exposure to more stimulating experi-
ences, strengthening positive patterns of neurobiol-
ogy. Indeed, our data suggest that these changes in
self-regulation may then go on to impact neurobiol-
ogy. Connecting our results with insights from basic
cognitive
neuroscience,
emerging
theories
of
vmPFC-hippocampal
functioning
suggest
these
brain regions play central roles in flexible cognition,
learning,
memory-guided
decision
making,
and
adapting to different environmental contexts (Pre-
ston & Eichenbaum, 2013; Schlichting & Preston,
2016). A large body of work has found the vmPFC
is related to the processing of reward and value-
based decision making (Rangel, Camerer, & Mon-
tague, 2008). Research indicates that the vmPFC
tracks subjective value across multiple types of
stimuli, and activity in this region predicts choice
behavior (Berkman, 2018). The hippocampus, specif-
ically the DG, plays an important role in contextual
processing and memory encoding (Kesner, 2013).
The
DG
may
influence
value-based
decisions
through these processes. During decision making,
increased interactions between the hippocampus
and vmPFC has been linked to making more deci-
sions that integrate memories and past experiences
(Gershman, Blei, & Niv, 2010; Gluth et al., 2015). As
such, the heightened connectivity between these
regions in the intervention group (compared to con-
trols) may represent a greater reliance on past expe-
riences and a greater influence of current context
when making decisions. Though speculative, the
SAAF
intervention
may
impact
self-regulation
through these more proximal processes. In future
work with this cohort, we hope to explicitly exam-
ine decision-making patterns and memory processes
through novel experimental paradigms and compu-
tational modeling (similar to Hanson et al., 2017).
This study has implications for both research
and
practice.
Conceptually,
building
upon
the
observational studies described previously, suggest
buffering influences of enhanced parenting on brain
functioning through self-regulatory changes. In that
regard, our results converge with the “parental
effects”
commonly
observed
in
animal
models,
wherein parental caregiving tendencies exert lasting
influences on offspring behavior and physiology,
especially in the brain (Gunnar, Hostinar, Sanchez,
Tottenham, & Sullivan, 2015). Furthermore, our
results suggest a neural circuit related to self-regu-
lation, namely the vmPFC-hippocampus. It will be
important to examine functional interactions of
these brain regions in relation to normative devel-
opment
in
self-regulatory
processes,
especially
using multimethod approaches. Clinically, the find-
ings suggest that SAAF and perhaps other interven-
tions
focused
on
strengthening
parenting
and
families could bolster core psychological capacities
through alterations in brain circuitry and brain
development. This should serve as an additional
Self-Regulation and Neurobiology

 motivator for practitioners and policy makers, as
neurobiological effects of the intervention were seen
in adulthood and related to important variations in
externalizing behaviors.
Several limitations of this study must be noted.
First, the SAAF trial was not designed with brain
functioning as an endpoint. As a result, we did not
collect pretrial neuroimaging scans that could be
used to determine whether the intervention and con-
trol groups’ neural profiles changed differentially
over time. At study entry, the SAAF and control
groups were similar in terms of SES, parenting qual-
ity, mental health, and other factors. This would
suggest that the groups began the trial with similar
patterns of brain connectivity. Nevertheless, until
pre–post data are available, conclusions about the
true capacity of SAAF to bring about changes in
neural circuitry must be viewed as tentative. Second,
we obtained brain imaging from only a subset of
participants. Statistical models would suggest that
before SAAF, all participants who completed neu-
roimaging were similar to the broader trial popula-
tion, again in terms of SES, parenting quality,
mental health, and other factors. With that said,
these families may have been more actively engaged
in the intervention and perhaps as a consequence
showed greater improvements in parenting, self-reg-
ulation, and patterns of neurobiology. Third, our
measures
of
self-regulation
were
parental
self-
reports. There may be potential biases present in
these measures, as families were completing an
intervention focused on changing related constructs.
Moving forward, we hope to integrate behavioral
and self-report data of self-regulation to understand
intervention effects at multiple levels of analysis
(similar to work on risk taking by Harden et al.,
2017). Fourth, although we believe changes in DG-
vmPFC
connectivity
may
underlie
externalizing
symptoms in adulthood, these two variables were
measured at the same time. A causal relation from
brain connectivity to psychopathology, therefore,
cannot be assumed. There may be significant bidi-
rectional interactions between these important vari-
ables, and our measures of interest in our study.
Further follow-up of this neuroimaging subsample
could more definitively speak to whether DG-
vmPFC connectivity is indeed mediating connec-
tions between the SAAF intervention, gains in self-
regulation, and externalizing issues later in develop-
ment. Finally, we examined changes in childhood
self-regulation as a behavioral mediator for the neu-
ral differences seen in our adult participants. The
SAAF intervention may have impacted numerous
behavioral processes, all of which could have con-
tributed to neural differences.
Limitations notwithstanding, this study provides
initial evidence that a family oriented intervention
can influence brain connectivity, in part by improv-
ing self-regulatory abilities. Additional research is
needed to confirm and clarify the relations between
self-regulation, neurobiology, and prevention pro-
gramming,
but
our
data
provide
suggestions
regarding neurobiological mechanisms. This infor-
mation could provide an additional vantage point
for understanding risk and resiliency, as well as
how environmental experience (both positive and
negative) becomes biologically embedded. Further-
more, these results should motivate policy makers
to invest in evidence-based prevention programs in
adolescence, as well as childhood. Such practices
are in increasing need, as the rates of childhood
poverty have risen steadily in recent years, and this
trend has been especially pronounced in rural, Afri-
can American communities.
