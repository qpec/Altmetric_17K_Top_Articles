Abstract Understanding memory formation, storage and retrieval requires knowledge of the
underlying neuronal circuits. In Drosophila, the mushroom body (MB) is the major site of associative
learning. We reconstructed the morphologies and synaptic connections of all 983 neurons within
the three functional units, or compartments, that compose the adult MB’s a lobe, using a dataset
of isotropic 8 nm voxels collected by focused ion-beam milling scanning electron microscopy. We
found that Kenyon cells (KCs), whose sparse activity encodes sensory information, each make
multiple en passant synapses to MB output neurons (MBONs) in each compartment. Some MBONs
have inputs from all KCs, while others differentially sample sensory modalities. Only 6% of
KC>MBON synapses receive a direct synapse from a dopaminergic neuron (DAN). We identified
two unanticipated classes of synapses, KC>DAN and DAN>MBON. DAN activation produces a
slow depolarization of the MBON in these DAN>MBON synapses and can weaken memory recall.

Introduction
Associative memory helps animals adapt their behaviors to a dynamically changing world. The
molecular mechanisms of memory formation are thought to involve persistent changes in the effi-
ciency of synaptic transmission between neurons. In associative learning, persistent changes in syn-
aptic efficacy correlated with memory formation have been found at points of convergence between
two neuronal representations: one providing information from sensory inputs about the outside
world and a second indicating whether the current environment is punitive or rewarding. Such sites
of convergence have been identified for multiple forms of associative learning (Medina et al., 2002;
Ardiel and Rankin, 2010; Tovote et al., 2015; Kandel and Schwartz, 1982). However, a compre-
hensive synaptic level description of connectivity at such a site of convergence is not available for an
animal as complex as the fruit fly, Drosophila.
The mushroom body (MB) is the center of associative learning in insects (Erber et al., 1980;
Heisenberg et al., 1985; de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994; Dubnau et al., 2001; McGuire et al.,
2001; Mizunami et al., 1998). Sensory information enters the MB via the calyx, where the dendritic
claws of Kenyon cells (KCs) receive synaptic inputs from projection neurons of olfactory and other
modalities including visual, gustatory and thermal (Vogt et al., 2016; Kirkhart and Scott, 2015;
Yagi et al., 2016; Caron et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 1990; Wong et al., 2002; Strausfeld, 1976;
Tanaka et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2015; Frank et al., 2015). The parallel axonal fibers of the KCs form
the MB-lobes, the output region of the MB. A pattern of sparse activity in the KC population repre-
sents the identity of the stimulus. This sparseness is maintained through two mechanisms. First,

 individual KCs generally only spike when they receive simultaneous inputs from multiple projection
neurons (Gruntman and Turner, 2013). Second, overall KC excitability is regulated by feedback inhi-
bition from a GABAergic neuron, MB-APL, that arborizes throughout the MB (Papadopoulou et al.,
2011; Lin et al., 2014a; Tanaka et al., 2008; Liu and Davis, 2009). Thus, only a small subset of KCs
respond
to
a
given
sensory
stimulus
(Perez-Orive
et
al.,
2002;
Turner
et
al.,
2008;
Honegger et al., 2011; Murthy et al., 2008). Upon this representation of the sensory world, dopa-
minergic or octopaminergic neurons convey information of punishment or reward and induce memo-
ries that associate the sensory stimulus with its valence (Schroll et al., 2006; Schwaerzel et al.,
2003; Liu et al., 2012; Burke et al., 2012; Riemensperger et al., 2005; Mao and Davis, 2009; Hei-
senberg, 2003; Claridge-Chang et al., 2009).
The functional architecture of the MB circuit is best understood in adult Drosophila (Figure 1)
(Ito et al., 1998; Lin et al., 2007; Tanaka et al., 2008; Strausfeld et al., 2003; Crittenden et al.,
1998; Ito et al., 1997; Aso et al., 2014a; Pech et al., 2013). In each MB, the parallel axonal fibers
of ~2000 KCs can be divided into 16 compartmental units by the dendrites of 21 types of MB output
neurons (MBONs) and the axon terminals of 20 types of dopaminergic neurons (DANs). A large
body of behavioral and physiological studies suggests that these anatomical compartments are also
parallel units of associative learning (see e.g. Hige et al., 2015a; Lin et al., 2014b). In each compart-
ment, the dendrites of a few MBONs overlap with axon bundles of hundreds of KCs. Punishment
and reward activate distinct sets of DANs. DAN input to a compartment has been shown to induce
enduring changes in efficacy of KC>MBONs synapses in those specific KCs that were active in that
compartment at the time of dopamine release (Hige et al., 2015a). The valence of the memory
appears to be determined by which compartment receives dopamine during training, while the sen-
sory specificity of the memory is determined by which KCs were active during training (Liu et al.,
2012; Heisenberg, 2003; Burke et al., 2012).
Compartments can have distinct rates of memory acquisition and decay, and the 16 compart-
ments together appear to form a set of parallel memory units whose activities are coordinated
through both direct and indirect inter-compartmental connections (Aso and Rubin, 2016;
Cohn et al., 2015; Perisse et al., 2016; Aso et al., 2014a). The DANs which project to the a1 com-
partment, the ventral-most compartment of the vertical lobe (Figure 1), play a key role in
the formation of appetitive long-term memory of nutritional foods (Yamagata et al., 2015). DANs
that project to the other a lobe compartments, a2 and a3, play roles in aversive long-term memory
(Aso and Rubin, 2016; Se
´journe
´ et al., 2011; Pai et al., 2013). All three of these compartments
receive feedforward inputs from GABAergic and glutamatergic MBONs whose dendrites lie in other
MB compartments (Aso et al., 2014a) known to be involved in aversive or appetitive memory
(Aso and Rubin, 2016; Aso et al., 2010; Burke et al., 2012; Perisse et al., 2016). In addition, two
types of MB-intrinsic neurons send arbors throughout the MB-lobes: a large GABAergic neuron, MB-
APL, which provides negative feedback important for sparse coding (Papadopoulou et al., 2011;
Lin et al., 2014a), and the MB-DPM neuron, which is involved in memory consolidation and sleep
regulation (Waddell et al., 2000; Keene et al., 2006; Haynes et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2005a; Cer-
vantes-Sandoval and Davis, 2012; Keene et al., 2004).
Previous EM studies in the MB lobes of cockroaches (Mancini and Frontali, 1970, Mancini and
Frontali, 1967), locusts (Leitch and Laurent, 1996), crickets, ants, honey bees (Schu
¨rmann, 1974,
2016) and Drosophila (Technau, 1984) identified KCs by their abundance, fasciculating axons and
small size. Additionally, Leitch and Laurent (1996) identified large GABA immunoreactive neurons
that contact KC axons in the locust pedunculus. While these data provided early insights to guide
modeling of the MB circuit, the volumes analyzed were limited and most neuronal processes could
not be definitively assigned to specific cell types. In this paper, we report a dense reconstruction of
the three compartments that make up the a lobe of an adult Drosophila male (Figure 1). Because
we performed a dense reconstruction, with the goal of determining the morphology and connectiv-
ity of all cells in the volume, we have confidence that we have identified all cell types with processes
in the a lobe.
Comprehensive knowledge of the connectivity in the a lobe has allowed us to address several
outstanding issues. The first concerns the nature of KC>MBON connectivity. Although each KC
passes through all three compartments, it is not known if individual KCs have en passant synapses in
each compartment. Thus, it remains an open question whether the sensory representation provided
to each compartment and each MBON within a compartment is the same or whether different

 MBONs within a compartment might sample from non-overlapping sets of KCs, and thus use inde-
pendent sensory representations for learning. It was also not known which, if any, other cell types
are direct postsynaptic targets of KCs.
The second concerns dopamine modulation. What are the locations of dopaminergic synapses
and what does this distribution imply about the targets of dopaminergic modulation as well as vol-
ume versus local transmission? Cell-type-specific rescue of dopamine receptor mutants suggests
that dopamine acts presynaptically in the KCs of KC>MBON synapses (Kim et al., 2007; Qin et al.,
2012a; Liu et al., 2012; Ichinose et al., 2015). However, postsynaptic mechanisms have also been
proposed (Cassenaer and Laurent, 2012; Pai et al., 2013) and a recent study detected expression

patterns of the axons of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and the dendrites of the MB output neurons (MBONs)
onto the parallel axonal fibers of Kenyon cells define three compartmental units in the a lobe. The DANs (green)
and MBONs with dendrites in the a1, a2 and a3 compartments (purple), known from previous light microscopic
studies (see Aso et al., 2014a for more detail), are indicated. Arrows indicate the main presynaptic sites of each
of the extrinsic neuron types. The names of neurons (shown in the rectangles with rounded corners) are color-
coded to reflect their main neurotransmitter: black, dopamine; orange, acetylcholine; green, glutamate; blue,
GABA. In addition to MBONs with dendrites in the a lobe, all three compartments receive projections from the
GABAergic MBON-g1pedc>a/b (dark blue) and the glutamatergic MBON-b1>a feedforward neurons (magenta),
whose dendrites lie in other MB lobes.

 of
dopamine
receptors
in
MBONs
(Crocker et al., 2016), raising the possibility
that MBONs might also be direct targets of
DAN
modulation.
Behavioral,
imaging
and
electrophysiological data (Aso et al., 2010;
Hige et al., 2015a; Cohn et al., 2015) indicate
that dopamine modulation respects the borders
between compartments, but we do not know
whether these borders have a distinct structure,
such as a glial sheet.
The third concerns the two MBON types that
send feedforward projections into the a lobe.
These MBONs have important roles in associa-
tive learning as revealed by behavioral assays
and have been postulated to integrate memo-
ries of opposing valence and different time
scales (Aso et al., 2014a; Aso and Rubin, 2016;
Aso et al., 2014b; Perisse et al., 2016). How-
ever, we do not know which cell types these
feedforward MBON projections targets within
the MB.
The fourth concerns the two neurons, MB-
APL and MB-DPM, which arborize throughout
the MB and are thought to regulate MB function
globally
(Liu
and
Davis,
2009;
Lin
et
al.,
2014a). What is their local synaptic connectivity
within the a lobe and what can this tell us about
how they perform their roles?
Finally, the three compartments of the a lobe
differ in important aspects, including valence of
the memory formed, the time course of memory
formation and retrieval, and the numerical com-
plexity of their DAN inputs and MBON outputs.
Are there obvious differences in the microcir-
cuits of different compartments?
In this paper, we report the answers to these
questions. In addition, we demonstrate the util-
ity of detailed anatomy at the electron micro-
scopic level to provide novel insights: We show
that nearly all cell types in the a lobe contain
more than one morphological class of synaptic
vesicle, raising the possibility that these cells uti-
lize multiple neurotransmitters. In addition, we
describe two prevalent sets of synaptic motifs—
from DANs to MBONs and from KCs to DANs—
that were unanticipated despite the extensive
anatomical, physiological, behavioral and theo-
retical studies that have been performed on the
insect MB. We characterize these novel DAN to
MBON connections using behavioral and physio-
logical assays and find that DAN activation pro-
duces a slow depolarization of postsynaptic
MBONs and can weaken memory recall.

Data acquisition, segmentation and proofreading
The brain of a 5-day-old adult male fly was fixed, embedded and trimmed as described in
Materials and methods. A ~40 � 50 x 120 mm volume (Figure 1B) encompassing the vertical lobe of
the MB was imaged by focused ion-beam milling scanning electron microscopy (FIBSEM) (Xu et al.,
2017) over a 5-week imaging run (Videos 1 and 2). The assembled volume has isotropic voxels (8 �
8 � 8 nm) allowing image data to be viewed with the same resolution along any axis.
The portion of the imaged volume that contained the a lobe was identified based on the mor-
phologies of the KCs and ensheathing glia. We then reconstructed the shapes of the individual neu-
rons in this selected volume, as well as mapped the locations of synapses. This process entailed the
application of machine vision algorithms for synapse detection and image segmentation—that is,
assigning each voxel to a particular neuron. These procedures have been previously published
(Takemura et al., 2015; Plaza et al., 2014; Parag et al., 2014) and are briefly described in
Materials and methods. The results of these automated processes were then reviewed and edited
by trained human proofreaders; a total of ~8 person years was devoted to proofreading. The neuro-
nal processes that entered or left the a lobe were traced until they exited the imaged volume; this
information was helpful in distinguishing cell types, as described below.
Cell type identification
Because of the constrained size of the imaged volume, only the portions of the neurons that have
processes in the a lobe were reconstructed. To identify the cell type of each partially reconstructed
cell in the EM volume, we compared their morphologies to existing images of the relevant MB cell
types from light microscopy (Figure 2) (Aso et al., 2014a). Our confidence in our ability to make
correct correspondences by this approach was increased by the completeness of both EM and light
microscopy datasets. We found only one cell type in our EM reconstructions that had not been
described at the light level, a single MBON that we named (MBON-a2sp). All the other recon-
structed arbors could be assigned to one of the neurons previously identified at the light level (Fig-
ures 2 and 3) except in the a1 compartment, where we reconstructed a few arbors that were not
large enough to allow unambiguous assignment based on comparing light and EM morphologies
and whose branches exited the imaged volume before connecting to an identified cell. Based on
comparison with light microscopic anatomy (Aso et al., 2014a), we expect that these are segments
of APL, DPM and MBON-g1pedc>a/b (see below). One other difference between the observed light
and EM morphologies was that MBON-a2p3p extends a few dendrites into a3 based on light micro-
scopic analyses (Aso et al., 2014a), whereas in our EM reconstruction of this cell we found dendritic
arborizations were confined to a2.
We reconstructed 949 KCs in the a lobe, a number that agrees well with the previous estimate
of ~1000 a/b KCs obtained by counting genetically labeled cell nuclei with light microscopy
(Aso et al., 2009). The a lobe KCs have been divided into three classes based on the location of
their axons in the lobe: posterior (a/bp), surface (a/bs) or core (a/bc) (Tanaka et al., 2008;
Strausfeld et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2007). The a/bp cells are clearly distinct in both morphology and
synaptic connectivity (see below) and we assigned 78 neurons to this class, compared to ~90 esti-
mated by Aso et al. (2014a). The remaining a/bs and a/bc KCs form a set of concentric layers in the
a lobe arranged by birth order, with KCs that are born more recently occupying the more central, or
core, layers. Following established nomenclature, we refer to KCs that occupy the outer most layer
of the a lobe as surface, a/bs, and those occupying the inner layers as core, a/bc; the core KCs can
be further divided into inner-core, a/bc(i) and outer-core, a/bc(o) (Tanaka et al., 2008). When the
distinction is unimportant, we simply refer to the non-posterior KCs collectively as a/bsc. The relative
spatial arrangements of these KC classes is illustrated in Figures 2A and 3A and Video 3.
The a lobe, a linear structure formed by the continuous axons of the KCs, can be divided into
three non-overlapping compartments, a1, a2 and a3 (Figures 1 and 2). Each compartment has a
unique set of DANs and MBONs whose complex dendritic arbors demarcate the extent of the com-
partment (Figure 1; Video 4). The a3 compartment at the tip of the a lobe contains two PPL1-a3
DANs and two MBON-a3 cells (Figure 2G and H). The a2 compartment has two PPL1-a02a2 DANs
(neurons that innervate both the a2 compartment and the a02 compartment of the a0 lobe) and four

 MBONs of three distinct types that differ based on the KCs they receive input from: one MBON-a
2sc, two MBON-a2p3p and one MBON-a2sp (Figure 2I–L). The a1 compartment has 16 PAM-a1
DANs and 2 MBON-a1 cells (Figure 2M–O; Video 5). These cell numbers are per hemisphere for
MBONs but per brain for DANs because each DAN innervates the MB in both hemispheres. In some
cases, the distinction of arbors of the MBONs and DANs were not very clear in each compartment.
In these cases, we used the characteristic axonal positions at which the neurites of these cells enter
the MB lobes (Aso et al., 2014a) in making cell-type assignments. For example: PPL1-a3’s main
axons all enter the lobe from the posterior side, whereas MBON-a3’s axons enter from the medial
side. DPM has a thick main axon entering into the a lobe from the posterior medial side
(Waddell et al., 2000) (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in Aso et al., 2014a), whereas APL has a
very thin axon entering the vertical lobe from the posterior side. Further confirmation for the identi-
ties of the cell types assigned to these reconstructed arbors was provided by their distinct synaptic
connectivity. For example, early in the process we found MBON dendritic arbors had no pre-synaptic
sites, APL was pre-synaptic to KCs but not DANS, and DPM was pre-synaptic to both. These pat-
terns enabled us to double-check the assignments that we had made based on morphology.
There are six additional cells with arbors in the a lobe, and each innervates all three compart-
ments (Figure 2B–F): the ipsilateral APL and DPM, MB-intrinsic neurons that arborize widely
throughout the MB lobes; a neuron expressing the neuropeptide SIFamide that arborizes broadly
throughout the brain (Park et al., 2014; Verleyen et al., 2004); and the axons of the ipsilateral
MBON-b1>a and the ipsi- and contralateral MBON-g1pedc>a/b, which project from other MB
lobes. In total, we reconstructed and identified portions of 983 neurons in the a lobe. Since we
accounted for all major neurites and neuronal profiles and had only small fragmented bodies left
unassigned to a specific neuronal type in the reconstructed volume (see below for the quantitative
estimate), we are confident that there are no other cell types with significant arborization in the a
lobe.
Synapse number and morphology
The resolution provided by EM allowed us to determine the number and location of chemical synap-
ses between the cells we identified, information that was not available from previous light level anal-
yses. We identified 89,406 presynaptic densities (Figures 4 and 5), using a combination of machine
learning algorithms and human annotation. We then manually annotated a total of 224,697 postsyn-
aptic sites in the a lobe, based primarily on their adjacency to a presynaptic density (see
Materials and methods). Of these postsynaptic sites, 93% could be traced back to the main arbors
of an identified cell. The remaining 7% of postsynaptic sites were typically in small branches that
could not be reliably traced to a particular cell; the small size and discontinuous nature of these neu-
rites indicates that they are fragments of identified cells rather than collectively constituting an addi-
tional cell type. For 86% of synapses, we were able to identify the cell types of both the pre- and
postsynaptic cells. The fact that we did a dense reconstruction, mapping the vast majority of synap-
ses, allowed us to determine quantitative properties of the network of neuronal connections that
would not be revealed by a sparser sampling approach.
Figure 4 shows examples of the synaptic morphologies we observed in the MB a lobe, and Fig-
ure 5 shows examples from a higher quality dataset (with 4 � 4 � 4 nm voxels and imaged with
higher signal to noise) collected from selected regions of a second brain. While the ~100 x slower
imaging required to collect data at this higher resolution precluded imaging the entire volume, these
selected areas allowed us to catalog the various synaptic motifs present in the MB with greater
confidence.

compartment has two DANs, PPL1-a’2a2 (I), and four MBONs: a single MBON-a2sc (J); two MBON-a2p3p (K); and one newly found MBON, MBON-a
2sp (L). The a1 compartment has 16 DANs, PAM-a1 (M in aggregate and N as individual cells), and two MBONs, MBON-a1 (O).

 Each MBON receives thousands of synapses
from KCs in each compartment, and we fre-
quently observed two or more KCs making adja-
cent synapses onto a dendritic process of an
MBON, often making rosette-like structures that
can also include DAN synapses (Figures 4A–C
and and 5A,B; Video 6). For the purpose of this
analysis, we define a convergence as a tight
grouping (within 300 nm) of two KCs pre-synap-
tic to a common target, and a rosette as a con-
vergence that includes a distinct density at their
point of KC to KC contact, which we have inter-
preted—based
solely
on
morphology—as
reflecting potential reciprocal synaptic contact
between the KCs (KC<>KC). Convergences and
rosettes were found for every cell type that is
post-synaptic to KCs, but the fraction of synap-
ses to a given cell type that occurred in these
structures varied between cell types. The highest
percentage observed was for KC>MBON synap-
ses, where 80–93% (depending on the MBON)
of the 54,234 KC pre-synaptic sites that connect
to MBONs are part of a convergence and 62%
part of a rosette. Video 7 shows how rosettes
and sites of convergence as well as single inputs
are distributed along the MBON dendrite. Other KC targets had a lower fraction of their synapses
to KCs in rosettes: KC>DAN (60% convergence, 37% rosettes of 9615 pre-synaptic sites); APL (69%
convergence, 32% rosettes of 9063 pre-synaptic sites); and SIF (44% convergence, 35% rosettes of
68 pre-synaptic sites). For DPM, in contrast, although 56% of its 7168 KC>DPM synapses were part
of a convergence, only 12% were part of a rosette. Of KC>KC synapses, 55% occur in rosettes. We
asked whether two KCs that participated in a rosette had an increased chance of converging again
in a second rosette elsewhere in the alobe; we found no such correlation.

 Mancini and Frontali, 1967). Similarly, we found that the presynaptic sites of all reconstructed cell
types except the SIFamide neuron contain at least two morphologically distinct classes of synaptic
vesicles (Table 1; Figure 5E), suggesting that most cell types in the MB use multiple neurotransmit-
ters. SIFamide neurons contain only large dense-core vesicles (roughly 125 nm in diameter), while all
other cells contain both DCVs and 45 nm diameter clear synaptic vesicles (Figure 5E; Table 1). The
DCVs are 80 nm diameter in KCs, PPL1-a02a2, PAM- a1, MBON-b1>a, APL, and DPM, while those
in PPL1-a3 are larger with a diameter of close to 100 nm (Table 1). We found relatively few DCVs in
APL, and almost none in MBON-g1pedc>a/b (Table 1). Because the MBONs with dendrites in the a
lobe (MBON-a1, MBON-a3, MBON-a2sc, MBON-a2p3p and MBON-a2sp) do not have pre-synaptic
sites within the reconstructed volume, we do not have information on what type(s) of vesicles they
contain.
The identification of synapses is based purely on morphology. Presynaptic densities in Drosophila
generally have a characteristic T-shaped specialization, the T-bar ribbon (Shaw and Meinertzhagen,
1986). Most KC synapses, however, have elongated-shaped presynaptic densities rather than typical
T-bars. While these are readily identified (see Figures 4 and 5), we cannot exclude the possibility
that large DCVs that fall near a membrane could occasionally be mistaken for a presynaptic density.
Postsynaptic densities are more difficult to recognize in the lower resolution (8 � 8 � 8 nm voxel)
FIBSEM dataset, and thus, in most cases postsynaptic targets have been identified solely by their
apposition to presynaptic sites. Another limitation of the current work is that we are unable to detect
gap junctions, structures that can provide electrical coupling between cells and contribute to circuit
function (Wu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016; Marder et al., 2017). A file containing all synapse loca-
tions is provided as Supplementary file 1.
Delivery of sensory information
We found that each of the three compartments has access to similar sensory information. As KC
axons pass through the compartments, every KC makes multiple en passant synapses in each com-
partment (Figure 5C,D; Table 2; Videos 8, 9 and 10).
The a3 and a1 compartments each have two MBONs of similar morphology whose dendritic
arbors fill the entire compartment. The distribution of the number of synapses each KC makes with
these MBONs is shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Every KC made synapses onto each of
these MBONs, averaging 28 ± 8 in the a3 compartment and 20 ± 6 in a1. The sole exception was a
single KC whose axon did not project all the way to the a3 compartment; its uniqueness suggests
that it was a developmental aberration. Interestingly, the data showed a close match to a Poisson
distribution, as expected if each KC>MBON synapse is formed during development without regard
to the placement of other KC synapses on the same MBON (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). A
simple Poisson model predicts the distribution of synapse counts (how many KCs have no synapses
to the target, how many have one, how many have two, etc.) from the total number of KCs (M) and
the total synapse count (N). The expected number c of KCs with k connections is

such as APL and DPM. (D) Sites where the same KC as in (C) is postsynaptic (black puncta) are also shown: Of the 114 inputs this KC receives in the a
lobe, 94 come from 65 other core KCs; 13 from 11 different surface KCs; four from DANs (three times in a3 and once in a1); and three from APL. Note
that because multiple synapses can occur in close proximity, the number of distinct puncta visible is smaller than the number of synapses and that red
and black puncta are often co-localized, indicating the KC is pre- and postsynaptic at the same site on its axon. (E) We found three kinds of synaptic
vesicles in neurons in the a lobe: rounded clear vesicles (white arrowheads), small-rounded dense-core vesicles (yellow arrowheads), and larger dense-
core vesicles (double-arrowheads). Scale bars: 500 nm in (A, B, E).

 we
could
find
little
statistical
structure
to
describe the synaptic connectivity, KC>MBON
convergence was, nevertheless, high enough
that these MBONs appear to integrate informa-
tion from every KC and all KC classes that are
found in their compartment.
In contrast to a1 and a3, where each MBON
has a compartment-filling dendritic arbor, a2
has three distinct types of MBONs (two MBON-
a2p3p
neurons,
one
MBON-a2sc
and
one
MBON-a2sp) whose dendrites arborize in differ-
ent subregions of the compartment (Figure 2J–
L). Accordingly, they differ significantly in their
relative inputs from different KC classes (Table 2;
Figure
6A).
For
example,
MBON-a2p3p
receives more than 75% of its input from a/bp
KCs, which constitute only 8% of alobe KCs.
Interestingly, the a/bp KCs are not activated by
odors (Perisse et al., 2013) and the a/bp den-
drites are physically separated from those of
odor-responding
KCs
(Lin
et
al.,
2007;
Tanaka
et al., 2008).
On the other
hand,
MBON-a2sc receives inputs almost exclusively
from a/bsc KCs whose dendrites lie in the main
calyx and receive inputs primarily from olfactory
projection neurons. Thus, our reconstructions indicate that MBON-a2p3p and MBON-a2sc have a
strong bias in how they sample modalities of sensory information. Despite this biased sampling,
MBONs that project extensively to a particular sub-region connect to every KC within that subregion
(Table 3). However, the borders between subtypes of KCs, especially between a/bs and a/bc KCs,
are not crisp and some MBONs receive a fraction of their inputs from outside their primary innerva-
tion zone; in these cases, the number of KC>MBON synapses made by individual KCs is also typically
lower. The fact that the sub-classes of KCs
defined by connectivity do not exactly coincide
with the sub-classes we defined by morphology
results in a few exceptions to a Poisson distribu-
tion of KC>MBON synapses (Figure 4—figure
supplement 1); for example, MBON-a2sp only
receives input from the outermost half of the
core KCs.
Other features of the wiring statistics also
suggest that individual neurons make their con-
nections during the development of the MB with
little or no consideration of other cell’s connec-
tions. For example, the number of synapses
each KC makes onto one of the MBONs in a
compartment is a poor predictor of the number
of connections with the second MBON. More
specifically, there are two MBONs in both the
a3 and a1 compartments and each of the two
MBONs in a compartment received similar num-
bers of KC synaptic contacts, but the number of
contacts that an individual KC makes to the two
MBONs in a compartment was not highly corre-
lated (Pearson’s r of 0.01, 0.21 and 0.27 for a3,
Kc-s, KC-c, and KC-p, and 0.00, 0.21, and 0.41 in
a1 for the same subsets. See Materials and

 methods). Similarly, we found that when two DANs of the same type each connect to a subset of
KCs, those subsets appear to be independent, neither seeking nor avoiding common partners. For
example, the two PPL1-a02a2 DANs each connect to about half of the KCs in the a2 compartment
(52.3% and 49.6%), while 23.5% of KCs connect to neither and 25.4% to both; thus, their patterns of
connection are not significantly different from independent (Fisher exact test, p=0.7). Indeed, we
found no evidence for the individual members of a pair of cells of the same type influencing each
other’s wiring. Additionally, connections to one KC do not appear to influence connections to other
KCs. For example, consider the connections from PPL1-05-A to the posterior KCs, where are 151
synapses in total to the 78 KCs. In the case where wiring occurs without inherent preferences, Pois-
son statistics predicts that (on the average) 11.1 ± 3.4 KCs will have no synapses, 21.8 ± 4.7 will have
one synapse, 21.1 ± 4.7 KCs will have 2, 13.6 ± 3.7 KCs will have 3, and so on. The actual counts are
10,23,24,12,3,4,2, agreeing well (c2 = 5.3 for 7 degrees of freedom) with the model.
Distribution of modulatory input
Reconstructions of dopaminergic input to the a lobe showed that these cells make synaptic contacts
with a variety of postsynaptic partners, including axo-axonal contacts with the presynaptic terminals
of KCs. The projection sites of the DANs in each compartment are plotted in Figure 6B. They pri-
marily target KCs, but surprisingly also make many contacts with MBONs. In contrast, the DANs
make far fewer synapses with the other neurons in the lobes, APL and DPM.

 Given
the
increased
dopamine
receptor
expression in the MB, DAN>KC synapses have long been postulated to exist (Han et al., 1996;
Kim et al., 2003). Morphologically, they are polyadic, and in some cases occur with the participating
DAN, KC and MBON in close proximity (see, for example, Figure 4D). While KCs are the main target
of DANs, DAN>KC synapses are far fewer than KC>MBON synapses, numbering only about 10% by
comparison (Tables 2 and 4). In fact, only 6% of KC>MBON synapses (3825 out of 61486) have a
DAN terminal within a radius of 300 nm. Despite this, electrophysiology data indicate that DANs
induce strong synaptic depression at the KC>MBON synapse, suggesting that the great majority of
synapses are affected (Hige et al., 2015a) and, in
turn, implying that the dopaminergic modulation
of KC>MBON synapses occurs by volume, rather
than local, transmission of dopamine. Consistent
with this view, the nearest DAN>KC synapse can
often be distant from a given KC>MBON syn-
apse; on average, the closest DAN>KC synapse
falls outside a radius of 800 nm from the given
KC>MBON synapse, with more than 10 other
synapses
(typically
KC>KC,
KC>MBON
or
KC>DAN) interspersed. Moreover, while every
KC makes multiple synapses onto the MBONs in
each compartment (Table 3), not all KCs receive
synaptic input from a DAN (Table 4). For exam-
ple, in a2, 23.5% of the KCs lack synapses from a
DAN.
The a3 and a2 compartments are each inner-
vated by a pair of PPL1 cluster DANs, one ipsilat-
eral
and
one
contralateral,
which
arborize
throughout the compartment. Thus, in a2, while
the distinct MBON cell types sample differently
from
KC
subtypes,
all
KC>MBON
synapses
receive dopaminergic input from the same DANs,
suggesting that they are coordinately modulated.

Figure 6. Connectivity profiles of the different neuron classes in the lobes. (A) Input profiles of different cell types within each a lobe compartment. All
cells within a cell type are combined, so for example DAN inputs in the a1 compartment represent the inputs to all 16 PAM-a1 neurons, while in a2 it is
the two PPL1-a02a2 neurons and in a3 it is the two PPL1-a3 cells. Bar heights indicate the total number of input synapses from the different sources,
with KC-c(i) indicating a/b KCs from the inner core, and KC-c(o) the outer core. The feedforward MBONs were omitted from these profiles; see Table 5
for the distribution of their synaptic outputs. The input profiles of the DANs and particularly the MBONs are quite distinct in each compartment. By
comparison, APL and DPM input profiles are very similar across compartments, suggesting they uniformly pool input from multiple compartments. (B)
Output profiles. Note the overall similarity of output connectivity of APL and DPM across all three compartments – aside from the numerous
DPM>MBON connections observed in a1. Again, this contrasts with the output profiles of the DANs, which are quite different in each compartment.
Note that we did not find any output sites of MBONs, except for ones providing feedforward input from other compartments, indicating that MBONs
are strictly dendritic inside the lobe (C) Primary connectivity motifs observed. Thick arrows indicate connections composed of >200 synapses, thin
arrows > 50 synapses in at least two compartments, and connections with fewer than 50 synapses are not represented in this schematic (but see

 In contrast, a1 receives modulatory input from 16 PAM cluster DANs whose individual arbors are
more restricted (Figure 2N; Table 4; see also Video 5) leaving open the possibility that KC-
sc>MBON synapses are modulated differentially to KC-p>MBON synapses.
Previous work indicates that dopaminergic modulation respects the border between compart-
ments (Hige et al., 2015a). However, we saw no obvious boundary structure in our EM images, such
as a glial sheet, that might block dopamine diffusion. Light microscopic studies of glia in the adult
brain likewise show an apparent absence of glial boundaries between MB compartments
(Kremer et al., 2017). To explore whether the observed functional compartmentalization could be
achieved without a discrete boundary, we estimated the predicted extent of cross-compartment
modulation under various assumptions of the range of dopamine diffusion (Figure 4—figure supple-
ment 2). For example, these calculations showed that if the effective range of dopamine action was
2.5 microns from its release site, 99% KC>MBON synapses in the same compartment, but only 1% in
the neighboring compartment, would be close enough to be modulated by a compartment-specific
DAN. This suggests that a discrete inter-compartment boundary may not be required.
Connectivity of the intrinsic neurons APL and DPM
The APL and DPM neurons innervate the MB lobes in their entirety and are thought to modulate
overall MB function (Tanaka et al., 2008; Waddell et al., 2000; Liu and Davis, 2009; Lin et al.,
2014a; Pitman et al., 2011; Haynes et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2011; Keene et al., 2006). APL is an
inhibitory neuron that governs overall levels of activity across the KC population to maintain the
sparseness of the odor representation (Papadopoulou et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2014a). The DPM
neuron is immunoreactive to the amnesiac neuropeptide (Waddell et al., 2000) and has been pro-
posed to use serotonin (Lee et al., 2011) and GABA (Haynes et al., 2015) as neurotransmitters; its
role in the circuit is less clear, but it is gap-junctionally coupled to APL (Wu et al., 2011), and
appears to be important for memory consolidation (Yu et al., 2005a; Pitman et al., 2011;

 Keene et al., 2006, 2004). The profile of DPM’s and APL’s input connectivity is shown in Figure 6A
and Table 5. Both cell types get many inputs from KCs, which would allow them to evaluate the
overall activity in the MB. They both also receive input from DANs in all three compartments
(Table 5); however, these were far fewer than the number of synapses the DANs made onto the
MBONs in each compartment (Table 6). Nevertheless, they may still be subject to dopamine modu-
lation, given the potential diffusion distance of dopamine; it is not known whether APL or DPM
express dopamine receptors.
In terms of their output, both cells primarily interact with the KCs (Figure 6B). In fact, APL sends
no output to any DANs and no MBONs other than a few connections to MBON-a1 (Table 5). Thus,
APL’s role seems largely confined to influencing the sensory input the KCs convey to the lobes. On
the other hand, DPM makes synapses onto MBONs and DANs in all three a-lobe compartments
(Table 5). Overall, the output profiles of these cells were quite similar across all three compartments.
The only exception to this was the high number of connections we observed between DPM and the
two MBON-a1s (Table 5); while the role of these connections is unclear, we note that DPM has been
shown to play a role in consolidation of long-term appetitive memory (Krashes and Waddell, 2008),
a process that takes place in the a1 compartment (Ichinose et al., 2015).
One surprising finding from our reconstructions that was not visible from confocal imaging of
these cells was that both DPM and APL have modular anatomy. The DPM arbor splits outside the
MB lobe into three large branches which ramify within distinct zones of the a lobe; one branch inner-
vates a1 and two others a2 and a3 (color-coded in Figure 2E). The zones defined by these branches
might serve as independent information processing domains and could explain the observation that

 aversive learning-related changes in calcium signals in DPM were confined to the vertical branch of
this neuron (Yu et al., 2005b). In contrast, APL sends a series of separate processes that project
through the a lobe, but these individual branches are not connected inside the a lobe (Video 11).
These processes may each serve as discrete units of local inhibitory feedback in the lobes.
Unanticipated circuit motifs
In addition to the circuit motifs anticipated from prior anatomical, behavioral and physiological stud-
ies (Heisenberg, 2003; McGuire et al., 2005; Waddell, 2013; Hige et al., 2015a; Cohn et al.,
2015; Owald et al., 2015), our comprehensive reconstruction shed light on some synaptic connec-
tions that have not been extensively studied or, in some cases, previously described. For example,

 we found additional postsynaptic targets for KCs beyond the canonical KC>MBON synapse. Most
strikingly, KCs made direct synaptic connections to DANs (Figure 4E; Table 7). Indeed, the number
of KC>DAN synapses is larger than the number of DAN>KC synapses (5037 vs. 2982 in a3; 1699 vs.
1466 in a2; and 3054 vs. 2011 in a1).
We also frequently observed structures that we interpret to be KC to KC synaptic connections
(Figures 4C and 5A,B; Table 8); such synapses have been previously described in the locust MB
(Leitch and Laurent, 1996). Most such KC to KC connections occur as a part of more complex struc-
tures: a presynaptic density associated with a KC>KC synapse usually has at least one additional
postsynaptic partner. The most frequent partner is an MBON and in 70–85% of cases (depending on
compartment) both KCs synapse onto the same MBON dendrite forming a KC<>KC>MBON trian-
gular motif as shown in Figure 5A and B. The distribution of postsynaptic cell types are similar in
such KC<>KC>cell type and simple KC>cell type structures.
Finally, we discovered that DANs make direct
synaptic outputs to the MBONs, a novel circuit
motif that we found in all three compartments
(Figure 4D; Table 6; Video 6). The number of
DAN>MBON synapses was small compared to
that of KC>MBON synapses—only 2% to 8% of
that number, depending on the MBON. How-
ever, the fraction of KCs that are active at any
one time is limited by sparse coding and has
been estimated to be ~6% (Campbell et al.,
2013; Turner et al., 2008). Thus, if all the synap-
ses from a single DAN are active, then the total
active synaptic input that an individual MBON
would receive from DANs and KCs might be
comparable. This prompted us to carry out phys-
iological and behavioral experiments to explore
the functional significance of this novel circuit
motif.

 transmission from DANs to MBONs. We used the a1 compartment for these experiments largely for
technical reasons: we had the split-GAL4 and LexA drivers required for imaging and photostimulation
and the cell body of MBON-a1 is accessible for patch clamping. We photostimulated PAM-a1, using
the light-gated cation channel Chrimson-tdTomato (Klapoetke et al., 2014), while imaging calcium
responses in the dendrites of the MBON-a1 with GCaMP6s in explanted brains (Figure 7A). A 100
msec photostimulation of PAM-a1 evoked a slow calcium rise in the MBON-a1 (Figure 7B). It took a
few seconds for GCaMP fluorescence to reach peak amplitude, which then slowly decayed over ~20 s.
Similar responses were observed with electrophysiological recordings from an in vivo preparation
(Figure 7C,D). With whole-cell recordings from MBON-a1, we observed that a two msec photo-
stimulation of PAM-a1 also evoked a slow depolarization, of sufficient amplitude to elicit a spiking
response. To test if these excitatory connections from DAN to MBON are direct, we blocked action
potential propagation with tetrodotoxin (1 mM) and cholinergic transmission with mecamylamine
(250 mM). These blockers minimize the possibility that DANs exert their effect on the MBONs via
intervening neurons, such as KCs, which have been shown to be cholinergic (Yi et al., 2013;
Barnstedt et al., 2016). Indeed, we observed no significant MBON response to direct KC stimula-
tion in
these
conditions
(Figure
7—figure

1),
consistent
with
the results
of
(Barnstedt et al., 2016). In contrast, DAN stimulation in the same conditions elicited a slow depola-
rizing response (Figure 7C,D), indicating that there is monosynaptic excitatory transmission from
DAN to MBON. In fact, there was a tendency for the response to become even larger, and the
decay kinetics even slower in the presence of blockers. This may reflect changes in the sensitivity of

 dopaminergic signaling, as spontaneous activity of PAM-a1 may hold the signaling cascade in a par-
tially desensitized state (Ichinose et al., 2015), which is then alleviated by the blockers. The
response was strongly (although not completely) diminished by the addition of a D1 dopamine
receptor antagonist (Figure 7E,F), indicating that DAN>MBON transmission acts largely through
dopamine receptors (Boto et al., 2014; Sitaraman et al., 2015). Indeed previous work has shown
that MBONs express dopamine receptors, but at lower levels than KCs (Crocker et al., 2016). How-
ever, as discussed above, we observed that DANs have at least two morphologically distinct types
of presynaptic vesicles, and we cannot exclude the possibility that a co-transmitter contributes to
the effects we observe here. Nor do we rule out the possibility that dopamine released from other
DAN synapses diffuses to the sites of direct DAN-MBON contact, although we did not see any evi-
dence for multiphasic kinetics in the response. Nonetheless, our experiments revealed direct, slow
excitatory synaptic signaling between DANs and MBONs in a1, providing direct physiological sup-
port that the DAN to MBON synapses we observed in our EM reconstructions are functional.
A possible behavioral role for DAN to MBON synapses
Our finding that DANs directly synapse on MBONs implies that DANs can affect the activity of
MBONs in at least two ways: (1) by modulating KC to MBON synapses, which provides a lasting
record of coincident activation of specific KCs and DANs; and (2) by direct synaptic transmission to
MBONs, whereby the DANs can immediately convey information about the current state of the envi-
ronment. Based on the population coding model of how the activity of individual MBONs is inte-
grated to bias behavior (Aso et al., 2014b), we would expect that activation of an individual DAN
and the resulting activation of its target MBONs could have a significant effect on behavior.
As a simple test of this idea, we first optogenetically trained animals to form an appetitive associ-
ation with a specific odor by pairing activation of PAM-a1 with odor presentation. We then tested
the effects of activating PAM-a1 during memory recall 1 min after training. We found that activation
suppressed the conditioned approach response to the odor (Figure 8A,B). Similarly, when we exam-
ined the effects on memory recall with a 1-day-old memory from optogenetic training in the a3 com-
partment, we again found DAN activation suppressed expression of the induced aversive memory
(Figure 8C). While DANs activation in the absence of odors can promote forgetting (Berry et al.,
2012), memories in a1 and a3 are resistant to such treatment (Aso and Rubin, 2016). We also found
that optogenetic activation of PPL1-a3 alone or in combination with other PPL1 DANs, in the
absence of odor presentation, produced an attraction response (Figure 8D).
Our finding that stimulating the DAN innervating a compartment while testing for memory recall
from that same compartment leads to a reduction in performance is the expected behavioral

Chrimson-expressing PAM-a1 DANs were photostimulated and MBON-a1 responses measured either with the
calcium sensor GCaMP6s or with whole cell recordings targeted via GCaMP fluorescence. (B) Calcium response of
MBON to DAN photostimulation. Dark blue trace shows fluorescence values taken from the dendritic region of
the MBON, with photostimulation (100 msec) demarcated by the red bar (mean ± SEM of recordings from n = 7
different flies). Light blue trace shows the response persisted in the presence of blockers of spiking and nicotinic
transmission (1 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX), 250 mM mecamylamine (MEC)). Overall response magnitude actually grew
larger. (C) Whole cell recordings showing MBON responses to DAN photostimulation. Dark blue trace shows a
representative single trial in control conditions, where DAN photostimulation (two msec) elicits a strong
depolarization, driving the cell across spike threshold. Light blue trace shows a single trial of the response from
the same cell following addition of the blockers as in B, again indicating that the evoked response does not
require spikes or nicotinic transmission. As with imaging, the depolarization was larger in the presence of the
blockers. Insert in upper right shows the initial portion of the trace at an expanded time scale. (D) Average MBON

 phenotype, taking together the sign of action we found for PAM-a1 activation on MBON-a1 output
and our prior work on population coding of valence by MBONs (Aso et al., 2014b). While this con-
sistency with expectation is reassuring, our optogenetic experiments cannot themselves distinguish
the in vivo roles of DAN signaling to MBONs, KCs or other cell types. They do, however, raise the
intriguing possibility that the observed reduction of the conditioned response to an odor might pro-
vide a mechanism for integrating the ongoing activity of a DAN, reporting on the current environ-
ment, and an associative memory induced by that DAN’s prior activity in the presence of the odor.
More experiments will be required to determine if such a strategy is employed by a fly under normal
conditions.
Feedforward MBONs
There are two feedforward neurons that convey information from other lobes to compartments
within the a lobe, MBON-b1>a and MBON-g1pedc>a/b (Figure 2B,C) (Aso et al., 2014a; Aso and
Rubin, 2016; Perisse et al., 2016). MBON-b1>a receives input from the b1 compartment, which
supports appetitive memory formation (Perisse et al., 2013; Aso and Rubin, 2016), and sends axo-
nal projections throughout the a lobe. MBON-g1pedc>a/b conveys information from the g1pedc
compartment, where it supports aversive memory, and projects throughout both the a and b lobes.
It has been postulated that their feedforward outputs mediate the interaction between memories
with different time scales and valences (Aso and Rubin, 2016; Aso et al., 2014b; Perisse et al.,
2016). To explore the circuit mechanisms that might govern this interaction, we examined the synap-
tic targets of these feedforward neurons in the a lobe. We were able to do so except in the a1 com-
partment where, for the technical reasons described above, we were unable to identify the arbors of
MBON-g1pedc>a/b (Figure 2C).
The most predominant targets of MBON-b1>a and MBON-g1pedc>a/b were the dendrites of
the MBONs in each compartment, which receive ~100 synapses generally as part of polyadic synap-
ses where multiple postsynaptic elements are associated with one presynaptic site (Figure 4F and
G; Table 5; Video 6). While the majority of inputs to each MBON come from KCs, as mentioned ear-
lier the sparse activity of KCs means that their input to the target MBONs is less than the number of
KC>MBON synapses implies. In contrast, MBONs respond to virtually all odors in untrained flies
(Hige et al., 2015b). Thus, MBONs in the a lobe likely receive a significant proportion of their input
from feed forward MBONs and would be expected to be sensitive to alterations in their activity.
The synapses of these feedforward MBONs showed an interesting spatial distribution. In a1, the
terminals of MBON-b1>a are concentrated on a region of the MBON-a1 dendrites closest to the
cell’s axon, a cellular location that might provide a strong influence on the cell’s spiking output (Fig-
ure 9). Light microscopy showed a similar positioning of feedforward synapses near to the axon for
the terminals of MBON-g1pedc>a/b on MBON-b’2mp (Perisse et al., 2016) an MBON from com-
partments at the tip of the horizontal lobe. The MBON-b1>a and MBON-g1pedc>a/b feedforward
neurons also make synapses onto each other, but in an asymmetric manner: MBON-b1>a is nearly
four times more likely to make synapses onto MBON-g1pedc>a/b than vice versa in the a2 and a3
compartments (Figures 4F and 9D; Table 5; we do not know the pattern of connections of these
two neurons in the a1 compartment because, as explained above, we were unable to identify
MBON-g1pedc>a/b in this compartment.). Although the number of these axo-axonic synapses is
low, they may play a significant role in the interaction of different memory modules, as they connect
modules with different valence, and synaptic input directly to an axon may have a large post-synaptic
effect. While MBON-b1>a, and to a lesser extent MBON-g1pedc>a/b, make some synapses onto
KCs (Table 5) there are on average only 0.37 of MBON-b1>a to KC synapses per KC. Taken
together, our data suggest that the feedforward MBONs may have minimal impact on the sensory
representation provided by KCs in each compartment, but are likely to modify the output conveyed
by MBONs emerging from the a lobe.

 Discussion
We have densely reconstructed the connectome of the a lobe of the adult Drosophila MB, a region
essential for long-term associative memory (Pascual and Pre
´at, 2001; Pai et al., 2013; Yu et al.,
2006; Se
´journe
´ et al., 2011; Akalal et al., 2011; Blum et al., 2009; Trannoy et al., 2011). The con-
nections between the neurons we observed are summarized in Figure 10. In each of the lobe’s three
compartments, parallel axonal fibers of ~1000 KCs project through the dendrites of a few MBONs
and the terminal arbors of a few DANs. Our results provide support for several aspects of the gener-
ally accepted model for MB circuit function. First, we found that each KC forms en passant synapses
with multiple MBONs down the length of its axon, making it possible for parallel processing across
the different compartments of the MB lobes. Secondly, with the assumption that released dopamine
diffuses locally, KC>MBON synapses would receive dopaminergic input close to the sites of vesicle
release, consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that plasticity occurs at the presynaptic terminals
of KCs (Heisenberg, 2003; McGuire et al., 2003; Zars et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2007; Qin et al.,
2012a). However, we also found several circuit motifs that were not anticipated by previous work.
For example, we found synaptic connections from KCs to DANs, indicating that DANs get axo-axo-
nal inputs within the MB lobes themselves. A recent report provides evidence that these KC>DAN
synapses are functional (Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017). An even more unexpected motif was the
direct synaptic contacts from DAN to MBON we found in every compartment. Our functional con-
nectivity experiments confirmed that these connections are monosynaptic, and showed that they
give rise to a slow depolarization in the MBON. Moreover, stimulating DANs in freely behaving flies
yields effects consistent with a net excitatory DAN>MBON connection. Finally, we describe the syn-
aptic connections of two feedforward MBONs, which have been proposed to mediate the interac-
tion of the various parallel memories within the MB lobes, as well as two intrinsic MB neurons, APL
and DPM.
Our work not only provides definitive evidence for, and quantitative detail about, many previously
observed circuit motifs, but also reveals several motifs not anticipated by prior anatomical, behav-
ioral or theoretical studies. These additional circuit motifs provide new insights and raise new ques-
tions about the computations carried out by the MB. We note that these same novel connections
were also found in a parallel study of the larval MB (Eichler et al., 2017). Not only were the same cir-
cuit motifs found in the larval MB and adult a lobe, but also the relative prevalence of these

average PI of reciprocal experiments during the test period is plotted. The odor delivery started at 2 s and the
arena was filled with odor by 5 s. Thick lines and error bars represent mean and SEM, respectively. Mean PI of the
final 30 s of each test period was significantly (p<0.05; N = 8; Mann-Whitney U test) lower when activation light
was ON (red; 1 s ON +1 s OFF) compared to the PI of flies tested in dark (gray). (B) The conditioned response was
also reduced in single odor conditioning (p<0.05; N = 8; Mann-Whitney U test). Flies were trained in the similar
protocol as in (A), but odors A and B were 3-octanol and air. Because memory scores tend to be lower in this type
of single odor conditniong, training was repeated three times. (C) Female flies expressing CsChrimson-mVenus in
PPL1-a3 (MB630B x 20xUAS-IVS-CsChrimson-mVenus in attP18) were trained 10 times with 15 min inter-training
intervals to form an aversive odor memory and then tested 1 day later. The conditioned response was significantly
reduced by DAN activation during test (p<0.05; N = 12; Mann-Whitney U test). Note that the a3 compartment has
a slow memory acquisition rate and the same 60 s paring of odor and thirty times 1 s activation was insufficient to
induce significant immediate memory (Aso and Rubin, 2016). Thus, the reduced conditioned odor preference is
likely due to the suppression of memory expression rather than formation of a new odor memory for the control
odor. (D) Untrained female flies were tested for preference to optogenetic activation of DANs. From 30–60 s, two
of the quadrants (Q2 and 3) were continuously illuminated with red LED lights to activate CsChrimson-containing
neurons; from 90 to 120 s, the other two quadrants (Q1 and 4) were illuminated instead. The preference index was
calculated based on the distribution of flies during the last 5 s of these two test periods (Aso et al., 2014b). Flies
expressing CsChrimson in PPL1-a3 (MB630B) or PPL-a3 and additional PPL1 DANs (MB065B and MB504B)
preferred the illuminated quadrants, whereas the control genotype (empty split-GAL4 driver, pBDP-p65ADZp in
attP40; pBDP-GAL4ZpDBD in attP2/20xUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus in attP18) showed a very slight preference for
illuminated quadrants. * and ** denotes p<0.05 or p<0.01 respectively by Kruskal Wallis One way ANOVA

 connections was strikingly similar: DAN>MBON synapses were 4.5% the number of KC>MBON syn-
apses in the adult a lobe and 3.4% in the larval MB. KC>DAN synapses were 1.5 times as prevalent
as DAN>KC synapses in the adult a lobe, as compared with 1.1 in the larval MB. KCs make 48% of
their synapses onto other KCs in the adult a lobe and 45% in the larval upper vertical lobe compart-
ments. It is tempting to speculate that the conservation of the relative abundances of these connec-
tions across developmental stages reflects important functional constraints on the circuit.
Parallel processing in the compartments of the MB
A large body of work (reviewed in Heisenberg, 2003; McGuire et al., 2005; Owald et al., 2015)
supports the idea that individual KC>MBON synapses are the elemental substrates of associative
memory storage in the MB. The dominant hypothesis in the field is that coincidence detection occurs
within the presynaptic terminals of the KCs. The Conditioned Stimulus (CS, for example an odor)
evokes a spiking response in a sparse subset of KCs, which in turn leads to Ca2+ influx. The Uncondi-
tioned Stimulus (US, for example electric shock) activates dopaminergic inputs to the MB lobes,
where they likely activate G-protein-coupled dopamine receptors on the KC cell membrane. The
coincidence of these two events is thought to be detected by the Ca2+ sensitive, calmodulin-

 dependent adenylate cyclase rutabaga, which initiates a cAMP signaling cascade that leads to the
biochemical changes underlying synaptic plasticity (Livingstone et al., 1984; Levin et al., 1992;
Boto et al., 2014; Gervasi et al., 2010; Tomchik and Davis, 2009).
The tiling of MBON and DAN projections down the length of the KC axons suggests that each of
these compartments serves as an independent module, with the association of reinforcement with
sensory input taking place in parallel across several different modules. One important assumption in
this model is that each KC sends parallel input to each compartment by making synapses all the way
down the length of its axon. Light microscopic imaging established that the axons of individual a/b
KCs do indeed run through all three compartments of the a lobe (Aso et al., 2014a). However, they
also revealed that the axonal branching patterns differ between KC classes (Aso et al., 2014a). For
example, the axons of a/bp KCs branch in a2, whereas those of a/bc and a/bs KCs do not, raising
the question of how extensive KC outputs are across the different compartments. Our dense EM
reconstruction allowed us to establish that in fact all a/b KCs form en passant synapses on MBONs
in each of the three a lobe compartments (Tables 2 and 3; Videos 8–10).
In many cases, these synapses were found at enlarged boutons that contained the presynaptic
machinery. However, output sites were also found on the smooth axons of the a/bc KCs, which lack
obvious bouton-like swellings. Only occasional, short (generally <5 mm) segments of KC axons where
the axon became thinner than 300 nm in diameter lacked presynaptic sites. Of course, we do not
know whether all these synapses are functional. Our EM analysis showed that within each compart-
ment, every KC passing through a layer of the compartment that was extensively innervated by an
MBON made at least one synapse with that MBON. Previous electrophysiological measurements of
connectivity in the a2 compartment indicated that only about 30% of KCs connect to MBON-a2sc
(Hige et al., 2015b), suggesting the possibility that the majority of KC>MBON synapses are func-
tionally silent, as they are in cerebellar cortex, where 98% of the parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synap-
ses are believed to be silent (Dean et al., 2010). However, we cannot rule out a more trivial
explanation: These measurements were made in the presence of cholinergic antagonists that could
have partially blocked synaptic events (Barnstedt et al., 2016) and lead to an underestimate of total
connectivity levels.
Our EM data revealed that the the number of synapses made by individual KCs was well-
described by a Poisson distribution, where each synapse connects with a uniform, independent, and
random probability to one of the KCs. Although the predicted distributions strongly depend on the
number of connections between two cell types, almost all KC connections to other cells obeyed
Poisson statistics (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This was true of every KC in the a1 and a3 com-
partments, where each MBON has compartment-filling dendrites. The a2 compartment is somewhat
unusual in that its MBONs innervate only subzones of the compartment (Aso et al., 2014a). While
light microscopy showed that MBON-a2sc primarily innervates the surface and core of the compart-
ment, MBON-a2sp was found to project more to the surface and posterior. Our connectome results
bore out these observations from the light and electron microscopy, although EM reconstructions
also showed that these borders were not sharp, and these MBONs receive less extensive and weaker
connections outside these subzones (Table 3). Nevertheless, within the primary area of innervation,
it was again the case that every KC made synapses with all MBONs along its axon. Thus each of the
949 a/b KCs can deliver information to the MBONs in each of the three a lobe compartments.

glutamate; blue, GABA. The transmitter for MBON-a2sp is unknown (name is shown in grey), and for DPM (name shown in brown) is 5HT, GABA and
the neuropeptide amnesiac. The correspondence of number of connections and line thickness is as follows: no line is shown when there are less than
five connections; five connections, 2 pt line; 50 connections, 4 pt line; 15000 connections, 35 pt line; with line widths interpolated between these values
using a log scale. Precise numbers can be found in the Tables 2–8 and Supplementary file 1. For some connections, such as the connections to and
from KCs of APL, DPM, MBON-g1pedc>a/b, MBON-b1>a and KCs, we have pooled the data from all three a-lobe compartments and present them in
the lower rectangle labeled a lobe. We similarly pooled data on synapses between MBON-g1pedc>a/b and MBON-b1>a and from MBON-g1pedc>a/
b to APL that was derived from counts in the a2 and a3 compartments. When more than one cell of a given type is present, such as the two MBON-a
3 cells, the synapse counts for each cell have been added in determining line widths. The connection from MBON-g1pedc>a/b to MBON-a1 is shown
as a faint arrow because the EM reconstruction failed to identify MBON-g1pedc>a/b in the a1 compartment (see text), although the presence of its
arbors is indicated by light level data (Aso et al., 2014a).

 A strictly feed-forward view of the circuit may miss important processing, however, as earlier stud-
ies suggested, and our results re-emphasize. Firstly, gap junctions between KCs have been reported
(Liu et al., 2016). This opens up the possibility for lateral propagation of signals across KCs, either
biochemical or electrical. For example, in mammalian systems, axo-axonal gap junction coupling can
synchronize firing between neurons (Traub et al., 2003; Schmitz et al., 2001). Secondly, chemical
synapses between KCs have been reported in the MB pedunculus in the locust (Leitch and Laurent,
1996). Our reconstructions show that such KC>KC connections are also present in the lobes, where
they are surprisingly prevalent. In fact, the most frequent outputs of the a/bs KCs are other a/bs
KCs, assuming the morphologically defined KC>KC connections are functional synapses.
A high percentage (55%) of these putative KC>KC synapses occur in rosette-like structures where
multiple KCs also converge on a single dendritic process of an MBON (Figures 4A–C and 5A,
B). These are relatively unusual structures, not observed in EM reconstructions of the Drosophila
visual system (Takemura et al., 2008) and, indeed, we have no direct evidence that they are func-
tional synapses. At present we can only speculate on their role. As points of heavy convergence,
they might allow the effects of synapses from different KCs onto the same dendrite to act synergisti-
cally. Activity of a single KC may spread to its neighbors within the rosette, potentially generating a
large compound synaptic release event onto the MBON in the middle. Such a signal amplification
mechanism may be important to ensure that individual KCs can have a significant impact on MBON
membrane potential by recruiting their rosette partners. How the specificity of learning could be
maintained in this scenario is, however, unclear. Several basic questions will need to be answered
before we can begin to understand the functional significance of these rosettes. For example, can a
single KC in the rosette indeed activate its neighbors? And how similar are the response properties
of the different KCs that contribute to one rosette?
In conclusion, the connectivity of the KCs that carry olfactory and other sensory representations
supports a model where parallel distributed memory processing occurs in each compartment. How-
ever, several circuit motifs that seem designed to spread and possibly amplify signals at the sites of
KC output indicate that this circuit is likely more complicated than a simple feed-forward view of the
system suggests.
Modulation by dopamine
Dopamine-induced plasticity of the KC>MBON synapse is thought to be central to associative learn-
ing in this system (Owald et al., 2015; Hige et al., 2015a; Cohn et al., 2015; Bouzaiane et al.,
2015; Kim et al., 2007; Schwaerzel et al., 2003; Qin et al., 2012b; Kaun et al., 2011;
Rohwedder et al., 2016). Our reconstructions showed that dopaminergic neurons make well-
defined synaptic contacts within the a lobe, with closely apposed post-synaptic membranes. This
contrasts somewhat with dopaminergic innervation in the mammalian system, where there is typically
not such close contact with a single clear post-synaptic partner, and volume transmission is the pre-
dominant model for dopamine release (Gonon, 1997; Garris et al., 1994). We do not know whether
the direct and indirect dopaminergic release sites have different functional consequences. Neverthe-
less, it seems likely that some type of volume transmission happens in the mushroom body. First, we
found ~10 times more KC>MBON synapses than presynaptic sites of dopamine release in the a lobe
(Table 4; cf. Table 2), but previous work showed that learning-induced plasticity depresses MBON
responses so strongly that most inputs are likely affected (Cohn et al., 2015; Hige et al., 2015b).
Second, dopamine would need to diffuse only ~2 mm to reach every KC>MBON synapse within a
compartment (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), but would also be sufficiently short range to pre-
vent significant spill-over of dopamine to neighboring compartments, ensuring that the modularity
of plasticity is maintained.
Functional connectivity measurements showed that stimulating the DANs elicits large amplitude
calcium signals from MBONs, similar to previous results (Sitaraman et al., 2015). Our intracellular
recordings revealed that this was a surprisingly strong connection, sufficient to elicit spikes in the
MBON (Figure 7). The response persisted when we blocked both spiking and nicotinic transmission,
to limit the possibility that the DANs act through the KCs, which are cholinergic (Barnstedt et al.,
2016). Conversely, the response was strongly reduced by adding a dopamine receptor antagonist.
Taken together, these results indicate that the response is likely a direct action of dopamine
released by the DANs on the MBON, although we can not formally rule out a more complex mecha-
nism or a role for the transmitter contained in the dense core vesicles we observed in the DANs. The

 depolarization exhibited markedly slow dynamics, peaking >2 s after stimulation offset, and then
decaying over tens of seconds. Dopaminergic responses of similar amplitude and time course have
been reported in both mammalian systems (Zhou et al., 2009; Aosaki et al., 1998) and in Aplysia,

Implications for memory formation and readout
It is possible to induce memory formation in this circuit by pairing odor delivery with artificial activa-
tion
of
DANs
(Schroll
et
al.,
2006;
Claridge-Chang
et
al.,
2009;
Aso
et
al.,
2010,
2012; Yamagata et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2012; Burke et al., 2012; Huetteroth et al., 2015;
Perisse et al., 2013; Rohwedder et al., 2016). Targeting this optogenetic training procedure to
DANs that innervate different compartments within the a lobe gives rise to memories with different
valence, induction threshold and persistence (Aso and Rubin, 2016). In the a1 compartment, a sin-
gle pairing for 1 min induces an appetitive memory that lasts for 1 day (Yamagata et al., 2015;
Ichinose et al., 2015; Huetteroth et al., 2015; Aso and Rubin, 2016). In contrast, optogenetic
training focused on the a3 compartment requires multiple 1 min pairings, repeated at spaced inter-
vals, and induces an aversive memory that lasts for 4 days (Aso and Rubin, 2016). Although it seems
likely that the different valences reflect the different projection sites of the MBONs for each of these
compartments, where the differences in induction threshold and memory persistence might arise is
less clear. There is no simple explanation for these differences from the EM-level circuit structure, as
the basic wiring motifs were very similar in each compartment. Moreover, any explanation that
invokes biochemical differences in KC>MBON synapses would require crisp spatial localization of
the signaling pathway machinery that triggers plasticity, as exactly the same KCs participate in mem-
ory formation in different compartments. However, our observation that there are DAN>MBON syn-
apses raises the possibility that biochemical differences in the MBONs might contribute to these
differences in plasticity induction and maintenance. Indeed, RNAseq data from a set of four different
MBONs showed expression of dopamine receptors (Crocker et al., 2016). An alternative possibility,
suggested by our findings here, is that the cotransmitter found in the dense core vesicles in the
DANs is responsible for these differences. The size of these vesicles differs between DANs innervat-
ing the different compartments (Table 1). Thus, these cells might release distinct co-transmitters, as
has been observed in mammalian brain (Stuber et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2015), which could trigger
different signaling cascades in either the KCs or the MBONs to differentially modulate the induction
and expression of plasticity across compartments.
Models of MB function have generally considered the role for DANs to be confined to relaying
signals about punishment or reward to the MB. However, in the mammalian brain, DANs can dynam-
ically change their responses to both US and CS (Schultz, 1998). In this study, we found that the
axonal terminals of the DANs receive many inputs from KCs within the lobes. In other words, both
MBONs, DANs and even KCs receive extensive synaptic input from KCs in each compartment. If the
current model that plasticity is pre-synaptic proves to be correct, this suggests that the responses of
the DANs themselves would be subject to plasticity. If the synaptic depression observed at
KC>MBON synapses also acts at KC>DAN connections, odor-evoked DAN responses would be
diminished as a result of learning. This would serve as a negative feedback loop, reducing the
strength of plasticity on successive training cycles with the same odor. Indeed, a gradually plateau-
ing of the learning curve is a common feature of memory formation in different systems
(Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Bush and Mosteller, 1951), including olfactory conditioning in Dro-
sophila (Tully and Quinn, 1985).
One of the more surprising findings here was our observation that there are many direct DAN>M-
BON synaptic connections. Moreover, our functional connectivity measures indicate that these were
relatively strong excitatory inputs. The excitatory sign of the DAN>MBON connection is also consis-
tent with the behavioral effects of DAN activation we observed (Figure 8). What role these DAN>M-
BON connections play in overall circuit function is an important question for future work. There are
two general possibilities that we feel are interesting to consider. Dopaminergic modulation has been
proposed to play a general role in routing of information through the MB to different downstream
neurons (Cohn et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2015; Perisse et al., 2016). Although changes in
KC>MBON strength contribute to this process (Cohn et al., 2015), our results here suggest that
such state changes could also potentially be conveyed to the MBONs directly from the DANs. State-

 dependent changes in DAN activity have indeed been observed with calcium imaging (Cohn et al.,
2015; Musso et al., 2015; Berry et al., 2015; Perisse et al., 2016; Krashes et al., 2009). The slow
synaptic dynamics we observed in the DAN>MBON connection in MBON-a1 (Figure 7) suggest the
possibility that small changes in DAN firing might be capable of producing sustained changes in
MBON membrane potential reflecting the current internal state of the animal.
A second possibility, suggested from the framework of reinforcement learning established in ver-
tebrates (Zhang et al., 2009), is related to motivation and the comparison of expected versus actual
reward. In Drosophila, prior work on odor-sugar conditioning in larvae provided evidence that flies
form a comparison between the current state of reward and the reward expected from the condi-
tioned cue (Schleyer et al., 2011). This work showed that animals behaviorally express memories
only
when
the
expected
reward
intensity
is
higher
than
the
currently
available
reward
(Schleyer et al., 2011, Schleyer et al., 2015). This is similar to the results we presented here; just as
the presence of reward diminished memory expression in the larvae, stimulating the DANs sup-
pressed performance of animals trained by the optogenetic conditioning (corresponding results
were also obtained in larvae M. Schleyer, B. Gerber, L. Magdeburg, pers. comm.). The need to com-
pare current and expected reward could potentially explain why there is an opponent relationship
between the depression of KC>MBON synapses that drives associative learning (Hige et al., 2015a;
Cohn et al., 2015; Owald et al., 2015; Se
´journe
´ et al., 2011; Bouzaiane et al., 2015) and the excit-
atory effects of the DAN>MBON connection. If depression dominates, the association drives behav-
ior, but this can be overridden by sufficient levels of DAN activity. In this respect, it is noteworthy
that DANs appear to be able to act directly on the MBON, without participation of the KCs. Overall,
this comparison could ensure that learned behavior is motivated not strictly by the expectation of
reward, but rather the expected increase in reward, assessed at the moment of testing
(Schleyer et al., 2015, 2011).
Feedforward coordination of parallel memory modules
The organization of the MB into a set of compartments arranged in series along the KC axons is well
suited for simultaneously storing multiple independent memories of a given sensory stimulus
(Das et al., 2014; Kaun et al., 2011; Aso and Rubin, 2016). However, there must be some means
by which these modules interact with one another to ensure coordinated, coherent expression of
memory. Feedforward connections that link different compartments, first discovered by light micro-
scopic anatomy (Tanaka et al., 2008; Aso and Rubin, 2016), have recently been shown to be impor-
tant for mediating such interactions. In particular, MBON-g1pedc>a/b is an inhibitory neuron that
connects aversive and appetitive learning compartments; it ensures that the circuit can readily toggle
between different behavioral outputs (Perisse et al., 2016; Aso and Rubin, 2016).
Our EM reconstructions included both MBON-g1pedc>a/b and MBON-b1>a, two feedforward
neurons which project from their respective compartments to widely innervate other parts of the
MB. Memories stored in the a lobe compartments are long-term and relatively inflexible, whereas
the short-term memories formed in b1 and g1pedc are readily updated by recent experiences. The
feedforward connections are thought to enable the short-term memories in b1 and g1pedc to tem-
porarily mask expression of the stable memories stored in the a lobe. Indeed training an animal with
either a multi-component aversive/appetitive food stimulus (Das et al., 2014), or by simultaneous
optogenetic activation of a composite set of DANs covering both appetitive and aversive compart-
ments (Aso and Rubin, 2016) results in a compound memory that is initially aversive and later transi-
tions to appetitive. Our connectome results show that the primary synaptic targets of these
feedforward neurons are the MBONs in the downstream compartment (Table 5). By contrast, we
observed relatively few connections onto KCs. Overall, this suggests that the feedforward connec-
tions can strongly influence the output from a compartment, but likely have little impact on the sen-
sory information delivered to each compartment from the KCs. This is consistent with observations
that MBON-g1pedc>a/b strongly modulates activity of glutamatergic neurons at the tip of the hori-
zontal lobe, but not their dendritic responses (Perisse et al., 2016). Targeting these feedforward
connections to the MBON may ensure that conflicting memories can form simultaneously in
response to a complex sensory input, but with the behavioral manifestation of those memories capa-
ble of undergoing a crisp switch.

 Concluding remarks
We provide synapse level anatomical information on neuronal circuits involved in learning and mem-
ory in Drosophila. The comprehensive nature of this dataset should enable modeling studies not pre-
viously possible and suggests many experiments to explore the physiological and behavioral
significance of the circuit motifs we observed. That many of these motifs were not anticipated by
over 30 years of extensive anatomical, experimental and theoretical studies on the role of the insect
MB argues strongly for the value of electron microscopic connectomic studies.
A dense (complete) reconstruction of neurons and synapses is resource intensive, so it is reason-
able to ask if tracing a subset of cells or synapses could have yielded similar results with less effort.
This is hard to answer in general, since there are many sparse tracing strategies, and each can be
pursued to differing degrees of completeness. It is likely that most sparse tracing strategies would
have discovered the new pathways reported here, as the connections are numerous and connect
well known cell types. Conversely, the conclusions that all cell types in this circuit had been identified
would have been more difficult to make with confidence and a rare cell type, such as the SIFamide
neuron, might have been missed. Perhaps, most importantly, statistical arguments, particularly those
that require an accurate assessment of which cells are not connected, such as the absence of net-
work structures such as rings or chains, would have been hard to make from sparse tracing. More
generally, the model independent nature of dense tracing helps to discover any ‘unknown
unknowns’, provides the strongest constraints on how neural circuits are constructed, and allows ret-
rospective analysis of network properties not targeted during reconstruction.
Materials and methods
Sample preparation
The head of a 5-day-old male progeny of a cross between a CantonS female and w1118 male was cut
into 200 mm slices with a Leica VT1000 vibratome in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2.5% paraformaldehyde,
0.1 M cacodylate at pH 7.3. The resulting slices were allowed to fix for between 10 and 15 min and
then transferred to 25% aqueous bovine serum albumin for a few minutes before loading into a 220
mm deep specimen carrier and high-pressure frozen using a Wohlwend HPF Compact 01 high-pres-
sure freezing machine (Wohlwend Gmbh). The samples were then freeze-substituted in a Leica EM
AFS2 low temperature embedding system in 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.2% uranyl acetate and 5%
water in 99% acetone with 1% methanol, for 3 days (Takemura et al., 2013). The temperature was
then raised to 21˚C, samples were rinsed in pure acetone, infiltrated, and embedded in Durcupan
epoxy resin (Fluka). After a 48 hr polymerization, the sample was previewed using 3D X-ray micros-
copy (Zeiss Xradia 510 Versa), oriented and then trimmed into a ~200 � 200 x 200 mm tab centered
around the MB location for FIBSEM imaging.
Data acquisition
The image data was collected using the methods described by (Xu et al., 2017) The trimmed sam-
ple was coated with 10 nm of gold and 100 nm of carbon. The MB was oriented vertically with the
a3 compartment at the top. Three dimensional isotropic structural data was acquired by focused
ion-beam milling scanning electron microscopy, FIBSEM, with a Zeiss NVision40 instrument. A
focused beam of 30 kV gallium atoms scanned across the top flat of the sample and ablated away 2
nm over a 180 � 180 mm area. A smaller region of roughly 40 � 40 mm defined the imaging area of
the scanning electron microscope. The sample was positively biased to 400 volts and scanned in x
and y with 8 nm pixels, at 3 nanoamperes and 1.5 KeV landing energy. The signal was acquired at
1.25 MHz per pixel using an in-column detector of the back-scattered electrons. About 60,000 such
ablation and imaging cycles over a 5-week period formed the raw data set. After registration of the
images using affine transformations, sequential sets of four 2 nm (in z) images were averaged
together to form a main data set with 8 nm isotropic voxels.
Subsequent imaging for the higher resolution (~4 x 4 � 4 nm voxels) data was taken on a small
volume of a different MB sample prepared in the same way, but imaged at 0.2 nanoamperes, 700
volts landing energy and 200 KHz sampling rate. Such data complemented the whole MB data to
show better detail of typical synaptic motifs.

 Data processing
We defined a region of interest (ROI) containing the a lobe of the MB, using the distinct glia sur-
rounding the a lobe neuropil and its distinctive morphology.
Within the ROI, we first automatically generated presynaptic locations. A Deep and Wide Multi-
scale Recursive (DAWMR) network (Huang and Jain, 2013) was trained on a subset of manually
defined presynaptic densities. The final T-bar point predictions from the voxel-wise output of the
DAWMR network were obtained by spatially smoothing the voxel-wise predictions, selecting the
voxels with highest confidence, and applying non-maxima suppression (Huang and Plaza, 2014).
Since manual verification followed, centered at the selected points, the parameters were tuned to
favor completeness, achieving roughly 75% accuracy at 90% recall.
Next, the FIBSEM imaged volume, starting with the ROI, was segmented automatically with an
algorithm similar to that described in Parag et al. (2015). The ROI was divided into ~70 mm3 subvo-
lumes with some overlap between them. For each subvolume, an initial oversegmentation was gen-
erated
by
the
standard
watershed
method
from
the
outputs
of
a
voxel
predictor.
The
oversegmented regions were refined by a supervoxel agglomeration technique. The particular stain-
ing method adopted for this dataset resulted in artifacts such as occasional breaks and holes on the
cell membranes. We developed a ‘conservative’ training strategy for the voxel predictors that was
biased toward minimizing false merges between two neurons. The supervoxel boundary classifier
required for the agglomeration is trained using the small sample learning algorithm of Parag et al.
(2014) that eliminates the necessity of exhaustively labeled ground truth. The overlapping subvo-
lumes were stitched together using the strategies outlined in Plaza and Berg, 2016. After the ROI
was proofread (described below), segmentation was generated for the surrounding region of the a
lobe to enable sparse tracing.
A manual verification and correction step (proofreading) followed the automatic synapse detec-
tion and segmentation. The synapses for the a lobe were annotated using the protocol in
Plaza et al. (2014). The automatic prediction of presynaptic sites was tuned for high recall (as
described above), and the sites were validated by proofreaders. After this, a different proofreader
re-examined each of these presynaptic annotations and further annotated the postsynaptic cell part-
ners. We used a special tag to denote convergent synapses.
After the completion of synapse annotation, we divided the volume into small overlapping subvo-
lumes and applied focused proofreading (Plaza, 2016) to revise the initial segmentation, which was
tuned to be over-segmented. This protocol was executed in Raveler (https://openwiki.janelia.org/
wiki/display/flyem/Raveler) and entails a series of yes/no merge decisions for adjacent segments
where the segmentation classifier was uncertain. After focused proofreading, the proofread subvo-
lume results were integrated into the complete dataset. At this point, there are many unassigned
synapses because those synaptic annotations are on small fragmented bodies, which we call synaptic
orphans. To make the connectome as complete as possible, we reviewed and, where possible to do
so with high confidence, assigned the orphan fragments to a larger reconstructed neuron. We used
NeuTu-EM (https://github.com/janelia-flyem/NeuTu/tree/flyem_release)
(Zhao et al., 2017) to
proofread the segmentation on the large dataset, and DVID (https://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid)
(Katz and Plaza, 2017) to manage the data and provenance of these changes. Select neurons were
sparsely traced outside of the densely reconstructed a lobe using NeuTu-EM.
Statistical methods
When testing if the observed connectivity is compatible with a Poisson distribution we compute such
a distribution with the same mean and total connectivity. Using all entries with expected value at
least 0.5, we compute a c2 value and from this an estimate of p. When testing whether two connec-
tivities are independent we use Fischer’s exact test. To test whether two distributions are drawn
from the same underlying distribution, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. When finding correla-
tion between two synapse strength vectors, we use Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

from light. All experiments were performed on female flies, 2–4 days after eclosion with the geno-

CaMP6s and Chrimson-tdTomato are codon optimized reagents that were the gift of Barrett Pfeiffer
and David Anderson). Brains were dissected in a saline bath (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2,
4 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 8 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM TES, bub-
bled with 95% O2/5% CO2). After dissection, the brain was positioned anterior side up on a coverslip
in a Sylgard dish submerged in 3 ml saline at 20˚C.
The sample was imaged with a resonant scanning two-photon microscope with near-infrared exci-
tation (920 nm, Spectra-Physics, INSIGHT DS DUAL) and a 25x objective (Nikon MRD77225 25XW).
The microscope was controlled by using ScanImage 2015.v3 (Vidrio Technologies). Images were
acquired with 141 mm x 141 mm field of view at 512 � 512 pixel resolution, approximately 9 Hz frame
rate after averaging five frames. The excitation power for calcium imaging measurement was 12
mW.
For the photostimulation, the light-gated ion channel Chrimson was activated with a 660 nm LED
(M660L3 Thorlabs) coupled to a digital micromirror device (Texas Instruments DLPC300 Light
Crafter) and combined with the imaging light path using a FF757-DiO1 dichroic (Semrock). On the
emission side, the primary dichroic was Di02-R635 (Semrock), the detection arm dichroic was
565DCXR (Chroma), and the emission filters were FF03-525/50 and FF01-625/90 (Semrock). Photo-
stimulation light was delivered in a pulse train that consisted of three 100 msec pulses with a 60 s
inter-pulse interval. The light intensity was 0.24 mW/mm2, as measured using Thorlabs S170C power
sensor.
Calcium responses were recorded as changes in fluorescence in a manually defined region of
interest in the a1 compartment. Tetrodotoxin (American Radiolabled Chemicals) and mecamylamine
(Sigma) were then applied as 15x stock into the bath to reach 1 mM and 250 mM final concentration,
and brains incubated for 4 min to allow permeation before recording another round of responses.
The second of the three pulses in the train were plotted as mean ± SEM without normalization.
Electrophysiology
In vivo whole-cell recordings and photostimulation were performed as previously described
(Hige et al., 2015a). The pipette solution contained (in mM): L-potassium aspartate, 125; HEPES,
10; EGTA, 1.1; CaCl2, 0.1; Mg-ATP, 4; Na-GTP, 0.5; biocytin hydrazide, 13; with pH adjusted to 7.3
with KOH (265 mOsm). The preparation was continuously perfused with saline containing (in mM):
NaCl, 103; KCl, 3; CaCl2, 1.5; MgCl2, 4; NaHCO3, 26; N-tris(hydroxymethyl) methyl-2-aminoethane-
sulfonic acid, 5; NaH2PO4, 1; trehalose, 10; glucose, 10 (pH 7.3 when bubbled with 95% O2 and 5%
CO2, 275 mOsm). For photostimulation, we used a single red LED with peak wavelength of 627 nm
(LXM2-PD01-0050; Philips) to illuminate the brain through a 60X water-immersion objective (LUM-
PlanFl/IR; Olympus) at an intensity of 1.1 mW/mm2. Stimuli were two msec in duration, delivered
every 75 s. After recording three to five trials, tetrodotoxin and mecamylamine were applied by per-
fusion into the bath at final concentrations of 1 mM and 250 mM respectively, as in the imaging
experiments. We used female flies of the same genotype and raised in the same way as those used
for calcium imaging experiments, targeting the cells using baseline GCaMP signal. We obtained
qualitatively similar results (data not shown) in recordings using Chrimson R to activate the DANs
and GFP to label the MBON in flies with the genotype 10xUAS-ChrimsonR-mVenus (attP18)/+;
R71C03-LexAp65 in attP40/ LexAop-GFP in su(Hw)attP5; MB043C/+. We tested the role of dopa-

and mecamylamine and then perfusing the antagonist SCH 23390 (100 m M final concentration) into
the bath. For these experiments, flies were of genotype: 10xUAS-ChrimsonR-mVenus in attP18/+;
R71C03-LexAp65 in attP40/ LexAop-GFP (attP5); MB043C/+. To measure the transmission between
KCs and the MBON, we expressed ChrimsonR in all a/b KCs using the Split-GAL4 line, MB008D
(R13F02-p65ADZp in VK00027, R44E04-ZpGAL4DBD in su(Hw)attP2). The genotype of the flies was
10xUAS-ChrimsonR-mVenus in attP18/+; R71C03-LexAp65 in attP40/LexAop-GFP in su(Hw)attP5;
MB008D/+.
Behavioral experiments
Olfactory learning assays were performed using the four-field optogenetic olfactory arena as previ-
ously described (Aso and Rubin, 2016) using thirty 1 s pulses of red LEDs for activation (627 nm

 peak and 34.9 mW/mm2). For testing the conditioned response in the presence of DAN activation 30
times of 1 s pulses of red light ON and 1 s OFF were delivered spread over the 60 s test period.
Crosses of split-GAL4 lines for DANs, MB043C and MB630B (Aso et al., 2014a; Aso and Rubin,
2016), and 20xUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus in attP18 (Klapoetke et al., 2014) were kept on standard
cornmeal food supplemented with retinal (0.2 mM all-trans-retinal prior to eclosion and then 0.4
mM) at 22˚C at 60% relative humidity in the dark. Female flies were sorted on cold plates at least 1
d prior to the experiments and 4–10 d old flies were used for experiments. Groups of approximately
20 females were trained and tested at 25˚C at 50% relative humidity in a dark chamber. The odors
were diluted in paraffin oil (Sigma–Aldrich): 3-octanol (OCT; 1:1000; Merck) and 4-methylcyclohexa-
nol (MCH; 1:1000; Sigma–Aldrich). For appetitive memory assays using MB043C, flies were starved
for 48 hr on 1% agar. Videography was performed at 30 frames/s and analyzed using Fiji
(Schindelin et al., 2012). Statistical comparisons were performed using Prism (Graphpad Inc, La
Jolla, CA 92037).

 The synapse locations, both pre-and post-synaptic, are in file ‘synapse.json’. The mapping of neuron
identifiers to names is in file ‘annotations-body.json’. Files annotating which synapses are in alpha
lobes 1, 2 or 3, and in the alpha lobe as a whole, are in bool-lobe-N.json, where N is the lobe and
100 is used for the alpha lobe as a whole. The program used to analyze these data is included as ‘s.
