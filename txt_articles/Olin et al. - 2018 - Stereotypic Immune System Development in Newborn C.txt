SUMMARY
Epidemiological data suggest that early life expo-
sures are key determinants of immune-mediated dis-
ease later in life. Young children are also particularly
susceptible to infections, warranting more analyses
of immune system development early in life. Such an-
alyses mostly have been performed in mouse models
or human cord blood samples, but these cannot
account for the complex environmental exposures
influencing human newborns after birth. Here, we
performed longitudinal analyses in 100 newborn chil-
dren, sampled up to 4 times during their first 3 months
of life. From 100 mL of blood, we analyze the devel-
opment of 58 immune cell populations by mass cy-
tometry and 267 plasma proteins by immunoassays,
uncovering drastic changes not predictable from
cord blood measurements but following a stereo-
typic pattern. Preterm and term children differ at birth
but converge onto a shared trajectory, seemingly
driven by microbial interactions and hampered by
early gut bacterial dysbiosis.
INTRODUCTION
The human immune system is a sensory system for intrinsic and
extrinsic environmental factors. Much like other sensory sys-
tems, the immune system is dependent on sensory inputs during
its development, and germ-free mice have severe immune sys-
tem defects (Gensollen et al., 2016). Also, in humans, early-life
exposures sensed by the immune system influence the risk
of developing immune-mediated diseases, such as allergies,
asthma (Laforest-Lapointe and Arrieta, 2017), and type 1 dia-
betes (Vatanen et al., 2016), later in life. Specifically, interactions
between the developing immune system and the microbes colo-
nizing the intestine, skin, and airways of a newborn child have
been suggested as important. The first 100 days of life seems
to be a critical period because microbial dysbiosis during this
period was associated with the development of asthma in a hu-
man birth cohort (Arrieta et al., 2015), a finding that is in line with
the hygiene hypothesis (Strachan, 1989). Newborn children are
also susceptible to infections, especially when born preterm,
but the basis for this is not fully understood (Kollmann et al.,
2017). Clearly further investigation on immune system develop-
ment in human children is warranted for us to better protect
newborn children from infections, develop more efficient vac-
cines, and reduce the burden of immune-mediated diseases
occurring later in life (Laforest-Lapointe and Arrieta, 2017). Lon-
gitudinal analyses of immune system development in human
newborns have been hampered by (1) a difficulty in obtaining
blood samples from healthy children and (2) technical limitations
in extracting sufficient amounts of information from the small
blood volumes obtainable.
Systems immunology analyses allow for many simultaneous
measurements to be made in a given sample, allowing the vari-
ation between individuals to be taken into account and used in
order to make new discoveries directly in human cohorts (Davis
and Brodin, 2018; Tsang, 2015). By such systems-level ana-
lyses, coordinated changes between cells and proteins also
can be appreciated and regulatory principles inferred (Kaczor-
owski et al., 2017; Brodin and Davis, 2017). Human systems
immunology analyses have now revealed not only large interindi-
vidual variation in immune cells and in protein composition
(Gaucher et al., 2008; Nakaya et al., 2015; Querec et al., 2009;
Sobolev et al., 2016) but also a stability of phenotypes within in-
dividuals over the course of weeks to months (Carr et al., 2016;
Tsang et al., 2014), and even a few years (Shen-Orr et al.,
2016). Most of the overall interindividual variation found among
healthy individuals is attributable to environmental factors (Bro-
din et al., 2015), but at which point such exposures shape our im-
mune systems is not well understood.
Here, we report on a longitudinal, systems-level analysis of im-
mune system development in 100 human newborns, followed
with up to four blood samples during the first 3 months of life.
Using as little as 100 mL of blood as starting material, we analyze
the development of all major immune cell populations by mass
cytometry and 267 plasma proteins by immunoassays, providing
a systems-level overview of immune system adaptation to post-
natal life (Figure 1A). These data reveal drastic changes across
immune components after birth, following a stereotypic pattern

 shared by all children, but not predictable from cord blood mea-
surements. The cell and protein changes occurring imply inter-
actions with microbes as important, and, in a subset of children
with gut bacterial dysbiosis, stereotypic immune system devel-
opment is hampered.
RESULTS
Systems-Level Immune Analyses in Newborn Children
We first established a sample processing protocol that was easy
to use directly in delivery and neonatology departments without
the presence of dedicated research staff. This procedure in-
volves an immediate stabilization and freezing of whole blood
samples to minimize cell loss and sample decay. To allow
studies in very preterm and term children alike, we had to opti-
mize our protocols to work with as little as 100 mL of blood as
starting material (STAR Methods). We designed a mass cytome-
try panel with 38 antibodies targeting activation and differentia-
tion markers across all white blood cell populations and profiled
a total of 95,278,466 immune cells from 337 blood samples in to-
tal. Plasma protein analyses using ProSeek (Olink, Uppsala,
Sweden), a sensitive dual-recognition immunoassay (Assarsson
et al., 2014; Lundberg et al., 2011), allowed the quantification of
267 unique proteins in < 20 mL of plasma in (Figure 1A). In a sub-
set of children, we also performed transcriptome analyses at
weeks 1 and 12 in order to interrogate gene expression changes
occurring after birth.
We enrolled 100 newborn children, born at the Karolinska Uni-
versity Hospital between April 2014 and July 2017, and collected
up to four longitudinal blood samples at birth (cord blood) and
weeks 1, 4, and 12 of life. A few children were also sampled later
around 6 months of life (Figure 1A). We sampled the blood of
mothers and fathers for comparison, and the cohort included
children delivered very preterm (<30 weeks of gestation; n = 50)
or term (R37 weeks of gestation; n = 50), but excluded children
with known organ malformations or congenital disorders (STAR
Methods). The early-life environmental conditions were vastly
different between the groups, with preterm children experiencing
long initial hospital stays (median = 65 days), frequent antibiotic
exposures, and an increased rate of infections and inflammatory
complications. Term children were all healthy at birth and left the
hospital after a few days without receiving antibiotics.
Preterm Birth Is Associated with a Strong Inflammatory
Response
Preterm delivery is often triggered by an inflammatory process
related to premature cervical ripening, premature rupture
of membranes and infections such as chorioamnionitis. To
compare immune system states in preterm and term children
at birth, we analyzed plasma protein concentrations in cord
blood samples. A strong pro-inflammatory signature character-
ized cord blood immune systems of children delivered very pre-
term, with high expression of chemokines CXCL11, and the prin-
cipal effector chemokine of newborn T cells, interleukin-8 (IL-8)
(CXCL8) (Gibbons et al., 2014) (Figure 1B). Term children had
high levels of the adipokine leptin, reflecting their higher fat de-
pots accumulated during the final trimester (Figure 1B). When
taking all 267 plasma proteins into account, preterm and term
delivered children segregated completely (Figure S1A). When
analyzing relative proportions of 21 canonical immune cell pop-
ulations (STAR Methods), we found that cell compositions signif-
icantly differed between preterm and term children (Figure 1C), a
difference mostly attributed to a lower neutrophil proportion in
preterm correlating with gestational age (Figure S1B). The pre-
term and term children differed �3 months in gestational age
at birth (Figure 1D), and we reasoned that some of the differ-
ences seen could be attributed to this difference in maturity. If
so, it’s predicted that phenotypic distances between preterm
and term children would decrease as preterm children mature
to a gestational age comparable to term children at birth (Fig-
ure 1D). We calculated interindividual distances between cell
and protein profiles of term children at birth and preterm-deliv-
ered children, either at birth or at 3 months of postnatal age,
but instead of converging, immune profiles of 3-month-old pre-
terms were even more dissimilar to those of term delivered chil-
dren at birth (Figures 1E and 1F). These findings suggest that
maturation alone cannot explain differences between preterm
and term children at birth. Instead, these differences are likely
multifactorial and associated with perinatal conditions causing
the preterm delivery to occur. Divergence after birth also implies
significant adaptive changes occurring in response to postnatal
environmental exposures.
Cord Blood Measurements Are Not Predictive of
Postnatal Immunity
Most existing data on immune systems in newborn children stem
from cord blood measurements, and we decided to investigate
how well such measurements would predict postnatal immune
system states. We calculated correlation coefficients between
cord blood and week 1 (median, day 3) measurements and
found that the frequency measurements of only 6 of 21 immune
cell correlated strongly compared with a nonsense correlation
between randomly chosen samples from different children
(Figure 2A).

 This lack of predictability was not only due to inherent tissue dif-
ferences between cord blood and peripheral blood. In seven chil-
dren with available peripheral blood samples on the day of birth
(day 0), the immune cell compositions differed from week 1 sam-
ples (Figure 2B). In two children we obtained cord blood samples
(day0 peripheralblood samplesandweek1 samples),which were
all different, implying that both tissue differences between cord
and peripheral blood and continuous changes occurring after
birth explain the inability of predicting postnatal immune systems
from cord blood measurements (Figure 2B). Of 81 plasma pro-
teins with well-known immune function (STAR Methods), only
one protein, TNFRSF13B, could be predicted from cord blood in
the first week of life (Figure 2C). This lack of correlation between
cord blood and postnatal samples was not caused by technical
variability in the experimental assays used, as correlations be-
tween longitudinal samples from healthy adults (n = 100) strongly
correlated between time points (Figures S2A and S2B).
Apart from estimating immune cell composition, mass cytom-
etry analyses also allow for studies of phenotypic changes within
each cell population. We used Barnes-Hut SNE (bhSNE) (van der
Maaten, 2013; Shekhar and Brodin, 2013) to reduce the dimen-
sionality of single-cell data and visualize two-dimensional em-
beddings of cells at consecutive time points (STAR Methods).
We first sampled healthy adults at two consecutive weeks and
found stable phenotypes of all cell populations (Figure 2D). In
contrast, when comparing cord blood and week 1 samples
from newborn children, we found that immune cell phenotypes
were markedly different between time points (Figure 2E). To
quantify phenotypic differences, we calculated Jensen-Shannon
(JS) distances between cell distributions from consecutive time
points, embedded together using bhSNE. This confirmed the
stability of adult phenotypes (n = 3) between time points,
whereas newborn children (n = 45) had significantly higher
phenotypic distances between cord blood and week 1 (Stu-
dent’s t, p < 2.5 310�14) (Figure 2F). We conclude that drastic
changes in cell composition, plasma protein concentrations,
and, even, cell phenotypes that cannot be predicted from cord
blood measurements already occur during the first few days of
life. This finding highlights the need for more longitudinal ana-
lyses in young children in order to understand postnatal immune
development and immune system states early in life.
A Topological Parameter Landscape Reconstructs
Immune System Development
Systems-level analyses allow for coregulated cells and proteins
to be revealed, but this requires that such heterogeneous data
are integrated. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides one
method for such integrated analyses and visualization of hetero-
geneous data types (Lum et al., 2013), such as cell frequencies,
protein concentrations, and clinical metadata (Lakshmikanth
et al., 2017). We applied TDA to visualize the systems-level
changes across all measured immune parameters early in life,
and to allow the exploration of these changes in relation to
metadata such as gestational age. From 202 blood samples
(parents excluded), we integrated 48 non-negative immune
cell population frequencies identified by an unsupervised clus-
tering algorithm (Weber and Robinson, 2016) (STAR Methods),
and 250 plasma proteins with variable concentrations (STAR
Methods). After scaling each measurement to unit variance,
we used Pearson correlation as a distance metric between
samples
and

(STAR Methods) (Lum et al., 2013). This analysis yielded a
parameter landscape that reconstructs immune system devel-
opment in an unsupervised manner (Figure 3A). Nodes in this
network represent sets of correlated samples; each sample
can occur in multiple nodes, and edges connect nodes sharing
at least one sample. We colored nodes by average day of life,
and, in doing so, a time trajectory from left to right can be
seen (Figure 3A). Notably, cord blood samples formed a
discrete cluster, emphasizing the discrete nature of cord blood
and postnatal immune systems.
Convergence of Preterm and Term Immune Systems
after Birth
The overall distribution of samples in the parameter landscape
had a branched structure with two branches representing
different immune system states early in life, and these branches
mapped to preterm and term-delivered children when colored by
gestational age at birth (Figure 3B). The parameter landscape
summarizes features of early life immune system development.
What the model also suggests is that immune systems of pre-
term and term children evolve along one shared trajectory after
birth (Figure 3B) with 3-month samples intermixed in a dense re-
gion of the parameter landscape (Figure S3A). There were no sig-
nificant differences in developmental patterns between boys and
girls (Figures S3C and S3D) or by season (Figures S3E and S3F).
This stereotypic development shared by preterm and term chil-
dren was surprising given that several preterm children remained
in the hospital for the entire study period and thus existed in
an environment very different from that of the families that had
returned home weeks to months earlier.

 The convergence of preterm and term immune systems was
mostly explained by changes in neutrophil frequencies and fre-
quencies of naive CD4+ T cells, which were already comparable
between the groups during the first few weeks of life, suggesting
a reversal of initially different phenotypes between preterm and
term children (Figure 3C). In a few preterm children, late onset
septicemia caused transient neutrophil expansion. Plasma pro-
tein changes also contributed to preterm/term convergence,
especially changes in leptin and IL-8, which converged during
the first month of life (Figure 3D).
To further investigate differences between preterm and term
immune systems after birth, we performed mRNA sequencing
(mRNA-seq) of viable peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from four preterm and four term-delivered children at
weeks 1 and 12. Also, at the transcriptome level, large-scale
changes occurred between these time points in both preterm
and term children, and the groups were largely intermixed (Fig-
ure 3E). However, notable gene expression differences that per-
sisted at 12 weeks after birth and distinguish preterm children
from term children also could be seen. We analyzed gene
ontology (GO) terms associated with such differentially regulated
genes and found that preterm children overexpressed genes
involved in the negative regulation of interferon-gamma (IFNg)
production and T cell proliferation, as well as genes associated
with IL-10 secretion, highlighting multiple important pathways
that can potentially explain differences in infectious disease sus-
ceptibility between preterm and term children (Sharma et al.,
2012) (Figure 3F). Mode of delivery can affect the composition
of pioneer microbes colonizing newborns after birth (Domi-
nguez-Bello et al., 2010). We found that children born by vaginal
and cesarean delivery were also intermixed at 3 months of age.
A larger and a more balanced cohort of children will have to be
analyzed in order to investigate possible differences in immune
development associated with mode of delivery (Figure S3B).
Stereotypic Changes in Immune Cell Composition
after Birth
Newborn immune system parameters were dynamic over
time as illustrated by higher coefficients of variance (CVs) for
21 manually gated cell populations in newborn children as
compared to healthy adults sampled at the same intervals. All
cell populations were more variable in newborns than in adults,
and preterm and term children varied similarly over time (Fig-
ure 4A). For each cell population, we fit an ANOVA model and de-
composed the total sums of squares into interindividual variation
(R2 explained by subject ID), and intraindividual variation (resid-
ual R2) (STAR Methods). In contrast to adults (Carr et al., 2016;
Shen-Orr et al., 2016; Tsang et al., 2014), newborn immune
cell populations exhibit a lot more intraindividual variation (Fig-
ures S4A and S4B) also emphasizing the dynamic nature of
newborn immune systems as compared to adults.
To compare the progressive changes in immune cell compo-
sition among all children, we analyzed relative abundances of
10 key immune cell populations in cord blood samples (n = 52)
and postnatal samples (n = 131) from all 100 children in our
cohort. Cord blood samples were heterogeneous without clearly
shared patterns. In contrast, postnatal samples ordered by day
of life revealed a stereotypic change in cell composition over
time (Figure 4B). This involved a gradual reduction in neutrophils
from birth, concomitant with an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
proportions (Figure 4B). Monocytes expanded transiently after
birth and subsequently contracted from 1 month, followed
by an increase in B cell abundance from 1 month onward
(Figure 4B).
Subpopulations of cells within major cell lineages display
similar stereotypic changes (Figures 4C and S4C–S4G). As an
example, B cell population #6 had a high expression of CD38,
CD24, and CD9, indicative of an immunoregulatory function,
and this population was abundant in cord blood but contracted
rapidly after birth (Figures 4D and 4F). Similarly, monocyte clus-
ter #8, with a phenotype reminiscent of myeloid-derived sup-
pressor cells (MDSCs) (Leiber et al., 2017; Rieber et al., 2013),
in newborns contracted to frequencies similar to those of parents
(Figure S4G). These examples suggest that such suppressive
immune cell populations that previously have been shown to
be abundant in cord blood might be less important inhibitors
of postnatal immune responses than previously suggested.
Collectively, these results show that immune cell compositional
changes after birth follow a stereotypic pattern of development
in all children, preterm and terms alike, despite their differences
in both maturity and postnatal environmental conditions.
Critical Period of Development Differing between
Immune Cell Populations
Cell frequencies and protein concentrations change in the
parameter landscape along a shared trajectory. When maternal
samples are included as an adult reference, the differences be-
tween newborn immune states and their mothers are seen at

 all time points, suggesting that additional exposures and adap-
tive changes are required to reach an adult-like immune state
(Figure 5A). Epidemiological evidence has suggested that the
first 3 months represents a critical period of immune develop-
ment during which environmental exposures can have long-
term consequences for immune-mediated diseases such as
allergies and asthma (Arrieta et al., 2015). We hypothesized
that such influences might perturb the phenotypic development
of individual cell populations, and we decided to compare im-
mune cell phenotypes in newborn children over time to parental
cell phenotypes. We reasoned that if newborn immune cell phe-
notypes would reach adult-like phenotypes during the first
3 months of life, this would suggest a critical period in their devel-
opment during which environmental exposures could have long-
term consequences.
Cell phenotypes from different time points stained and ac-
quired together from a given child and its parents were visualized
together in a two-dimensional reduced space using bhSNE
(STAR Methods). In one example, samples 6 months apart
from one young child and corresponding parental samples re-
vealed notable patterns. First phenotypes of maternal and
paternal cells were very similar as compared to newborn cells.
Naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell phenotypes in newborns showed
no sign of converging with parental phenotypes during the study
period, while naive B, natural killer (NK), and dendritic cells (DCs)
did (Figure 5B). We quantified these phenotypic distances
among all families and confirmed the development of adult-like
phenotypes for naive B, NK, and DCs, but not for T cell popula-
tions (Pearson’s correlation < �0.17, p < 0.05) (Figures 5C and
5D). Monocyte phenotypes were comparable between children
and parents already at birth (Figures 5C and 5D). We conclude
that phenotypic transitions toward parental-like phenotypes
follow a stereotypic sequence that differ between cell types
and that the first 3 months of life seems to be a critical period
during the development of B, NK, and DCs, implying that
environmental influences imprinting on these cells during the
first 3 months could have long-term consequences for the
individual’s immune system.

Given the stereotypic changes in cell composition, protein con-
centrations, and cell phenotypes above, we wanted to investi-
gate the specific influences that could drive this development.
First, we subdivided the immune parameter landscape into five
discrete developmental stages (Figure 6A). We calculated inter-
individual distances between immune cell and protein profiles at
each of these stages showing a progressive convergence of
phenotypes, underscoring the stereotypic nature of the develop-
mental process (Figures 6B and 6C). To interpret individual
features changing at each stage of development, we compared
distributions of individual cell populations and proteins using
Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) tests (Table S1). We find that regula-
tory cytokines IL-27 and IL-10 are abundant in cord blood and
decreased after birth (Figure 6D), much like the regulatory cell
populations described above. Around 1 month of life these reg-
ulatory cytokines increased again, possibly as a way to balance
induced immune responses to environmental factors (Figure 6D).
The Fc receptor, PIgR transports immunoglobulin A (IgA)
antibodies across epithelial cells onto luminal surfaces and is
induced by microbial products on these luminal surfaces (Kaet-
zel, 2005). We found increased PIgR expression specifically from
stage four and onward (Figure 6E). Further supporting the notion
that interactions with microbes are important were the elevated
levels of IL-8, IL-17A, and IL-12B during stages 4–5 (Figure 6F),
and multiple cell population changes. One notable example
was an expanded population of CD8+ T cells expressing the
CD161 receptor, likely representing a mucosal-associated
invariant T (MAIT) cell population (Figures 6G and 6H), known
to be involved in responses to bacteria on mucosal surfaces
(Wong et al., 2017).
Transcriptome analyses on weeks 1 and 12 reveal massive
changes across a wide range of pathways (Figures 6I and S5).
Many of the changes involve metabolic pathways, but some
important immune system processes were also found, and
most upregulated genes were major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II genes (HLA-DRA and -DQB1) induced by IFNg
upon microbial stimulation (Mach et al., 1996). Collectively,
these findings suggest that responses to microbes, especially
at mucosal surfaces, are possible drivers of the stereotypic
immune systems development in newborn children during the
first few weeks of life.
Early Dysbiosis in the Gut Microbiome Affects Immune
System Development
To better understand microbe-immune interactions in newborn
children, we performed 16S rRNA profiling of fecal samples
(n = 95) from 45 of the children in our cohort at weeks 1, 4, and
12 of life. Principal coordinates analysis using UniFrac distances
revealed a progressive change in fecal microbiome composition
over time (Figure 7A) (La Rosa et al., 2014). The diversity of these
fecal microbiomes increased over time after birth, but in a few
children the diversity during the first 50 days was exceptionally
low indicating bacterial dysbiosis (Figure 7B). In these children,
near-complete dominance of the gut microbiome by bacterial
classes Bacilli or Gammaproteobacteria was seen (Figure 7C).
The children with early gut dysbiosis had more circulating endo-
thelial cells, activated T cell populations and higher levels of the

 pancreatic exopeptidase CPA1 in their subsequent 3-month
blood samples (Figures 7D–7F). When analyzing interindividual
distances at 3 months of life, we found that children experiencing
early gut dysbiosis were more heterogeneous, a finding that
again suggests that the stereotypic developmental trajectory is
perturbed in children experiencing early dysbiosis (Figure 7G).
We conclude from these findings that interactions with microbes
colonizing newborn children during the first weeks of life are
seemingly important, and perturbation to this process of coloni-
zation is associated with perturbations to the stereotypic im-
mune system developmental early in life.
DISCUSSION
The finding that children of different levels of maturity and post-
natal environmental conditions converge on a shared develop-
mental trajectory early in life was unexpected to us. One possible
explanation is that antigenic exposures shared by all children
drive this development. At the same time, gut microbiome
composition differed between children, and the likelihood of
shared exposures across such a diverse group of children seems
unlikely. Another possible explanation is that some other physi-
ological process, shared by all children, triggers the stereotypic
immune system development, but the changes seen implicate
interactions with microbes. These findings led us to hypothesize
a possible model for stereotypic adaptive changes to diverse
environmental exposures.
This model is based on the assumption that a single input
sensed by the immune system will elicit a stereotypic adaptive
response by the immune system (Figure 7H). In contrast, two
simultaneous inputs, with partially opposing effects, will each
induce adaptation, but also constrain the adaptive responses
to the other simultaneous input (Figure 7I). If the number of simul-
taneous and diverse inputs is sufficiently large, the number of
possible phenotypes decreases, and convergence of initially
diverse immune systems is predictable (Figure 7J). This model
does not require inputs to be identical, as long as the number
of simultaneous inputs is sufficiently large and give rise to
different adaptive responses. We propose this model of immune
system adaptation to environmental influences to explain
the developmental changes, shared by diverse children and
following a stereotypic pattern during the first weeks of life.
Collectively, these findings highlight the reactive nature of the
human immune system with implications, not only for our under-
standing of newborn immune systems, but also for our under-
standing of human immune system variation in general and
how this is shaped by environmental influences. We also pro-
pose that in-depth analyses during early life adaptation to envi-
ronmental influences provides a unique opportunity for better
understanding the molecular mechanisms of immune system
adaptation to environmental influences in humans.
Recent systems-level analyses in humans have shown that
environmental influences explain most of the overall variation
among healthy individuals (Brodin et al., 2015; Orru
` et al.,
2013; Patin et al., 2018; Roederer et al., 2015) and that such envi-
ronmental influences from infections, vaccines, nutrition, and the
microbiome exert a cumulative influence over the course of life
(Brodin et al., 2015; Kaczorowski et al., 2017). This is also re-
flected in an increased similarity of individuals sharing household
(Carr et al., 2016). The increased divergence of human immune
systems with age predicts that cord blood samples would
more homogeneous with respect to their immune phenotypes
than postnatal samples given the more limited exposure before
birth. Here, we show that cord blood phenotypes are, in fact,
highly diverse and, instead of diverging after birth, converge
onto a shared developmental path during the first weeks of life.
This converged 3-month immune system state might therefor
represent the real set point from which human immune system
variation is shaped by environmental exposures over the course
of life.
We also describe evidence of a critical period in the develop-
ment of B, NK, and DCs during the first 3 months of life, as these
cell populations reach adult-like phenotypes during this period,
suggesting that environmental influences imprinting on these
cells during this time window could have long-term conse-
quences. Such long-term consequences of early life exposures
are suggested to be important determinants of future risk of im-
mune-mediated diseases in recent epidemiological analyses
(Arrieta et al., 2015). In line with this, colonization with Helico-
bacter pylori has been shown to be protective of asthma and
other inflammatory conditions, as its presence influences DC
maturation toward a more tolerogenic state (Oertli and Mu
¨ ller,
2012). If microbial stimuli present during the first 100 days
have similar effects on DC development, this might establish
an individual’s DCs on a trajectory associated with reduced dis-
ease risk. T cell populations showed no signs of convergence
with parental cells during the first 100 days in our study, and
longer follow-up times will be needed to understand whether

 and when such periods might occur for T cell populations. This
also suggests that specific cell populations and pathways have
different critical periods of calibration when they would be
most amenable to environmental imprinting, allowing specific
exposures at specific time points in the context of a given ge-
netic makeup to contribute to an individual’s risk of individual im-
mune-mediated diseases.
The finding that all children in our cohort converged similarly
might seem at odds with known interindividual differences in dis-
ease susceptibility. In this respect, it is important to consider that
infectious disease susceptibility is a complex trait, influenced by
immunological,
epidemiological,
and
physiological
factors.
Moreover, even if the convergence of phenotypes illustrates an
adaptation of the immune system, this does not necessarily
translate into identical functional responses. Further studies
will be required to investigate functional differences during the
different stages of the stereotypic development and the regula-
tory, possibly epigenetic, adaptations underlying this process.
The ability to adapt to environmental influences was shared by
the children in our cohort, and we argue that this represents an
extreme example of a process that is ongoing all the time, in all
individuals, as our immune systems interact with internal and
external environments and adapt to them. Although all 100 chil-
dren behaved similarly here, it is possible that a larger cohort
would identify individuals who do not conform in the same way
or have subtle variations in this process. An inability to adapt
also could be a determinant of immune-mediated disease.
Elegant population genetics studies have revealed traits, confer-
ring protection from infectious disease and selected for
throughout evolution, but in our modern environmental context
being associated with an increased risk of immune-mediated
diseases (Quach and Quintana-Murci, 2017; Brinkworth and
Barreiro, 2014). Additional examples of the importance of im-
mune adaptation to environmental inputs come from children
with rare, monogenic disorders presenting with life-threatening
primary infections (Alcaı
¨s et al., 2010) that in some cases
improve with age (von Bernuth et al., 2008; Ku et al., 2007).
This reduced risk of severe disease with age could be a result
of immune adaptation to environmental influences conferring
added robustness to the system.
This study has several weaknesses. First, the direct fix and
freeze strategy for preserving blood samples for mass cytome-
try analyses was unfortunately not compatible with any of
several tested clones targeting either ab T cell receptors
(TCRs) or gd TCRs on T cells, preventing us from distinguishing
these subsets of T cells. gdT cells have been reported to be
abundant and important for providing protection to newborn
children (Gibbons et al., 2009). Similarly, this protocol also pre-
vented us from reliably detecting regulatory T cells, because the
FoxP3 transcription factor could not be detected in fixed/frozen
cells. Recent results indicate that the developing immune sys-
tem in prenatal life is fully functional, but actively suppressed
(Elahi et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017) and that regulatory
T cells are important mediators of this suppression (McGovern
et al., 2017; Mold et al., 2008). Because most of the conclusions
presented stem from global signatures across measurements,
they are robust to these technical limitations in detecting indi-
vidual cell populations.
All in all, we have reported on a longitudinal, systems-level anal-
ysis of the immune systems in newborn children that provide new
insights into the dynamics of immune cells and proteins early in life
and illustrate the reactive nature of human immune systems,
particularly in response to the myriad of microbial exposures at
birth and early thereafter. These findings have implications for
researchers striving to understand the unique state of immune
systems in newborn children, their susceptibility to infectious dis-
eases (Bhutta and Black, 2013), and how to protect such children
by developing better vaccines tailored to newborn immune
systems (Amenyogbe et al., 2015). These findings also have impli-
cations for our general understanding of human immune system
variation, early-life imprinting by environmental exposures, and
the development of immune-mediated diseases later in life.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Infant and Parental Samples
The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol was approved by the regional ethical
board in Stockholm, Sweden (DNR: 2009/2052 – 31/3 & 2014/921-32). After obtaining informed consent from parents, blood samples
of newborns and parents were collected at the Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge. Samples from 3 healthy adult controls,
100 children, 58 mothers, and 52 fathers were collected for the study. 12 blood samples were collected from the healthy adult
controls, 285 samples from the children, and 156 samples from parents. Of the children, 49 were male and 51 were female. 51 chil-
dren were born with cesarean section and 49 through vaginal birth, 50 children were delivered preterm (< 30 weeks gestational age at
birth) and 50 were delivered at term (> = 37 weeks gestational age at birth). Gestational age at birth varied from 170 to 209 days in the
preterm group and from 259 to 293 in the term group. Birth weight ranged from 458 to 1623 g in the preterm births and from 2838 to
4655 g in the term births. The mothers had a median age of 32 (range 20-43) and the fathers a median age of 35 (range 21-52). The
healthy adult controls were of ages 26, 28, and 36.
METHOD DETAILS
Sample Collection and storage
From children, about 100 ml whole blood was collected for mass cytometry analysis and mixed with either SmartTube proteomic sta-
bilizer at a ratio of 1:1.4, or Cytodelics Whole Blood Cell Stabilizer at a ratio of 1:1, incubated in room temperature for �10 minutes and
transferred to a �80�C freezer for long-term storage awaiting analysis. For mothers and fathers as well as cord blood samples,
approximately 3ml of peripheral blood was collected. Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation of blood samples at
2000 g and collection of supernatant.
Fecal samples were collected in plastic containers and stored at �80�C until use.
PBMCs were isolated using density gradient-based separation. 3-500 ml of blood was put in a BD Vacutainer CPT tube and centri-
fuged at 1600 g for 15 minutes followed by collection of buffy coat. Cells were frozen in freezing medium containing 50% RPMI, 30%
FBS and 20% DMSO.
Thawing of stabilized Mass Cytometry Samples
Whole blood samples preserved in SmartTube solution were kept on ice for 15 minutes, followed by thawing in a water bath set to
20�C. Red blood cells were lysed by addition of SmartTube Lysis buffer #1 and incubated at 20�C for 10 minutes. The white blood
cells were washed twice with CyFACS (1% BSA, 0.5% Na-Azide and 0.5M EDTA in PBS), filtered through a 35mm mesh and counted
using a Bio-Rad TC20 cell counter.
Whole blood samples preserved in Cytodelics Whole Blood Cell Stabilizer were thawed at 20�C. Cytodelics Fix/Lyse buffer was
added at a blood:buffer concentration of 1:10 and samples were incubated at 20�C for 5 minutes. Samples were then diluted 1:4
with Cytodelics Wash buffer #1 and left to lyse for 15 minutes. Cells were then washed twice with Cytodelics Wash buffer #2, filtered
through a 35mm mesh and counted using a Bio-Rad TC20 cell counter.
Antibody Labeling
Purified monoclonal antibodies indicated in the Key Resource Table were either purchased pre-conjugated from Fluidigm or
purchased in purified formulation and conjugated using the MAXPAR X8 polymer conjugation kit (Fluidigm Inc), according to the

 manufacturer’s protocol. Antibody concentration before and after conjugation was measured by NanoDrop 2000 spectrometer
(Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 280nm and antibodies diluted 1:1 in Protein Stabilizer PBS (Candor Bioscience
GmbH, Wangen Germany) prior to use.
Mass Cytometry Barcoding and Staining
A maximum of 2x106 cells per sample were barcoded using six combinations of palladium isotopes (102Pd, 104Pd, 105Pd, 106Pd,
108Pd, 110Pd) with the 20-Plex Pd barcoding kit (Fluidigm). Cells were fixed for 10 minutes in 1mL of Fix I Buffer at room temperature,
followed by two washes in 1 mL of Perm Buffer. Barcodes were resuspended in 100ml Perm Buffer, transferred to each sample and
incubated for 30 minutes at room temperatures. All samples were then washed twice with CyFACS and then pooled. Cells were
suspended in 150ml antibody cocktail per 107 cells and incubated for 30 minutes at 4�C. Antibodies used are listed in the Key
Resources Table. After staining, cells were washed twice with CyFACS followed by overnight incubation in 4% formaldehyde diluted
in PBS at 4�C.
Mass Cytometry sample acquisition
Iridium-labeled DNA-intercalator was added to cells in 4% formaldehyde for a final concentration of 0.125 mM and incubated for
20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed once in CyFACS, once in PBS and twice in milliQ H2O filtered through a
35mm nylon mesh and counted. Cells were diluted in milliQ H2O containing 10% EQ Four Element Calibration Beads to a concentra-
tion of 0.5 3 106 cells/ml. Samples were acquired on one of two CyTOF2 mass cytometers, using noise reduction, event length limits
of 10-150 pushes and a sigma value of 3. Cells were acquired at a flow rate of 0.045ml/min.
ProSeek data collection
Plasma protein data was generated using the proximity extension assay (ProSeek, Olink AB, Uppsala). Three panels of 92 proteins
each were used to detect a range of biomarkers (Table S2). The data was generated in three batches of 88, 98, and 90 samples
respectively, for a total of 276 samples. The method has been described previously (Assarsson et al., 2014). Briefly, paired oligonu-
cleotide-coupled antibodies with overlapping sequences are allowed to bind in to proteins in the sample. When paired antibodies are
brought in proximity to one another through binding to their target, their oligonucleotide sequences overlap to form a PCR target
which can be quantified with real-time PCR.
RNA preparation and sequencing
Frozen PBMCs were thawed and live propidium iodide-negative cells were sorted using a BD Influx Cell Sorter (200mm nozzle,
3.1PSI, 6.05 kHz) in 1.0 drop purity mode. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit. Full-length cDNA synthesis and amplifica-
tion from the polyA+ extracted RNA was carried out as in Picelli et al. (2014). After amplification, dsDNA was purified using Ampure XP
beads and DNA tagmentation and amplification of adaptor-ligated fragments (dual-indexed) was then performed with Illumina
Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit. Samples were equimolarly mixed in two pools and sequenced in two HiSeq2500 lanes
(High Output mode v4, PE 2x125bp) at Science for Life Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden.
DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing
Fecal samples were frozen in sterile tubes without additives and DNA extraction was done using the MO BIO PowerFecal DNA isola-
tion kit (now available as QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit) following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was eluted in milliQ H2O and
stored at �80�C awaiting analysis. Prior to amplification, samples were thawed and normalized, and a total of 50 ng were used to
amplify the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using primer pair 341F/805R. The initial amplification was carried out for 20 cycles
with the forward primer construct:
50-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-30,
and the reverse primer construct
50-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-30.
After cleaning, a 5 mL aliquot of each of the 2-step samples was submitted to an Indexing reaction using the Nextera XT Index Kits
v2 in a 13 cycle PCR. Purification of PCR products was carried out using Agencourt Ampure XP Beads on a KingFisher Flex System.
Samples were then pooled to equimolar amounts and sequenced in a MiSeq instrument.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Mass Cytometry Preprocessing and Gating
All FCS-files were exported as non-randomized without any additional preprocessing from the CyTOF software (version 6.0.626).
Files were normalized using our own in-house implementation of normalization software described previously (Finck et al., 2013).
Each file was debarcoded using the MATLAB version of the single-cell debarcoder (Zunder et al., 2015). For visualization, each
data point X was randomized by sampling from a normal distribution with a mean of X and a standard deviation of 0.3. The data
e4

 was transformed by dividing each value by 5 and applying the hyperbolic sine function (arcsin h (X/5)). Each file was gated on
according to the strategy shown in Table S4. For each file, cell frequencies of each population were calculated as a percentage
of all DNA-positive events.
Aitchison Distances using Immune Cell Frequencies
Aitchison distances between gated immune cell frequencies were calculated using the aDist function of the R package
robCompositions. Classic multidimensional scaling coordinates were calculated using the cmdscale function from the stats-
package. PERMANOVA statistical test between term and preterm births was performed using the adonis function from the
vegan-package. Statistical test for comparison of inter-individual distances was performed using a Student’s t test.
Correlation of Cord Blood and Week 1 Measurements
For this analysis, plasma proteins were selected for immunity-related proteins based on GO-terms. Pearson correlations for gated
immune cell frequencies (n = 48) and plasma protein concentrations (n = 44) in cord and postnatal blood from the same child were
calculated (paired correlations). These were compared to Pearson correlations between an equal number of randomly paired cord
and postnatal blood samples (random correlations). Cord blood was considered to be predictive of postnatal blood if the confidence
intervals of the paired correlations and the random correlations were non-overlapping.
bhSNE of Mass Cytometry Data

transformation was applied in order to give equal weight to all markers. The ACCENSE implementation of Barnes-Hut SNE was used
(Shekhar and Brodin, 2013), with a perplexity of 30 and removal of outliers. The markers used for each population is listed in Table S3.
Jensen-Shannon Distances on bhSNE Distributions
The Jensen-Shannon distance between two two-dimensional-distributions of bhSNE coordinates was calculated using the bhSNE
maps generated as described above. The calculation of Jensen-Shannon distances was performed as previously described by Amir
et al., 2013. Briefly, two-dimensional kernel density estimation distributions (two-dimensional-KDE) are calculated from the bhSNE
coordinates using the kde2d function from the MASS package with n = 28. The Jensen-Shannon distance between two two-dimen-
sional-KDEs is defined as the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between these distributions. The JSD between
two distributions P and Q are defined as:
JSDðP k QÞ = 1
2 KLðP k MÞ + 1
2 KLðQ k MÞ
where
M = 1
2 ðP + QÞ
and KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence defined as:
KLðP k QÞ =

PðijÞlog PðijÞ
QðijÞ
Analysis of variance in Mass Cytometry Data
Cord blood samples were excluded from the variance analysis to remove any variance due to differences between cord and periph-
eral blood. Variance analysis was only performed using sample series containing all time points to ensure that inter-sample variance
was based on at least three samples. For each group of adults (n = 3), preterm (n = 29) and term children (n = 15), and for each gated
subpopulation, a linear model was fitted with the subpopulation frequency as the response variable and subject ID and sampling time
in days after birth as predictors. An ANOVA table was extracted and the relative contribution of Subject ID and sampling time to the
total sum of squares was calculated for each subpopulation in each group. The coefficient of variation defined as
Cv = s
m
was calculated separately for each group and each gated subpopulation.
Clustering of mass cytometry data by self-organizing maps
Clustering was performed on each cell type separately, pooling all samples (n = 91) from 28 children. For each cell type, each dataset
was down-sampled to 10 000 cells, files belonging to the same child were pooled and the data was Z-score transformed to account
for batch effects between series. All files were pooled and the maximum intensity for each channel was set to the 99th percentile to

 account for outliers. Self-organized map (SOM)-clustering using the som function from the kohonen package and a hexagonal SOM
grid of 20x20 was performed using markers specific for each cell type (Table S3) and rlen = 100. Subclustering on the SOM clusters to
10 subclusters was performed and clusters representing less than 1% of all cells were removed.
ProSeek plasma protein data preprocessing
Cq-values for each protein are recalculated to a relative log2-scale with arbitrary units. The data is normalized to minimize intra- and
inter-assay variation, and the data from the three panels and the three batches were merged into one dataset. Proteins that were
detected in less than 20% of all samples were discarded. Any missing values were set to the lowest detectable value for that protein.
A batch correction was performed using the ComBat algorithm as provided in the sva R package using pre-term/term status and
sampling time (week) as covariates.
GO-term classification of immune system plasma proteins
Proteins with a known function in the immune system were identified from the total list of proteins (Table S2) by selection of proteins
associated with at least one of the following GO-terms: ‘immune response’ (GO:0006955), ‘inflammatory response’ (GO:0006954),
‘cytokine activity’ (GO:0005125), ‘chemokine activity’ (GO:0008009), and ‘defense response’ (GO:0006952). This subgroup involved
124 out of 251 proteins.
Topological Data Analysis
The parameter landscape model in Figure 5 was generated by performing Topological Data Analysis (TDA) integrating 250 plasma
protein concentrations and 48 immune cell frequency measurements, in 202 blood samples from newborn children. Each measure-
ment was scaled to unit variance. The analysis was performed using Ayasdi software platform (Ayasdi Inc., Menlo Park CA). Nodes in
the network represent sets of newborn blood samples and edges connect nodes with sharing samples. Nodes are colored by the
average value of their samples for the variables listed in the figure legends. TDA was used to reconstruct the systems-level changes
in the newborn immune system and allow analyses of changes in relation to metadata parameters. Two types of parameters are
needed in TDA; I) a notion of similarity, measuring a distance between samples in the dataset and II) lenses, which are real-valued
functions applied to the data points. Lenses are used to create overlapping bins in the dataset. Overlapping families of intervals
are used to create overlapping bins. Metrics are used with lenses to construct the Ayasdi output network. There are two parameters
used to define bins in the data: I) resolution determining the number of bins, and II) gain, determining the degree of overlap of data
intervals. Once bins are constructed, a clustering step is performed on each bin using single linkage clustering with a fixed heuristic
for the choice of the scale parameter (Singh et al., 2007).This gives a family of clusters within the data, which may overlap, and a
network with one node for each such cluster, a connection between two nodes sharing at least one sample. We used two types
of lenses. In making a TDA graph, the points in the dataset are clustered within bins, defined by setting the resolution of the analysis.
To determine how two groups of points defined in a TDA graph differ, a non-parametric statistical test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) in com-
bination with the p value (t test) was used to identify parameters with a p < 0.05 for either one of the tests. Cells and proteins that were
expressed at significantly different levels are reported in Table S1.
RNaseq data analysis
We estimated counts from Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) and performed differential expression analysis using DEseq2 (Love et al., 2014).
To calculate enriched gene ontology terms associated with these differentially regulated genes we used the PIANO package (Va
¨ remo
and Nielsen, 2013). These calculations were performed separately to compare preterm and term children in week 12 and to compare
week 12 versus week 1 samples from all children analyzed (n = 8).
16S rRNA sequencing analysis
The Cutadapt package was used to remove reads not carrying primers, trim away primer sequences and bases with Phred score < 15.
Forward and reverse reads were merged using Usearch. Non-overlapping reads, merged sequences < 380 bp or > 520 bp, and se-
quences with > 3 expected errors over the full length were removed. Sequences were de-replicated and the unoise tool was used with
a minimal cluster size set to 2 to error-correct the sequences. Each of the merged sequences were mapped back to the corrected
sequences for quantification, requiring 99% identity over the full length to assign taxonomy to the corrected sequences. To assign
taxonomical class, corrected sequences were mapped to the SILVA database and the result was parsed at an ID cutoff at 95%. Unifrac
distances were calculated by mapping the sequences to SILVA using pplacer, and calculating distances using Guppy.
