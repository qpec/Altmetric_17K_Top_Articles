Abstract
Buddhist-derived meditation practices are currently being employed as a popular form of
health promotion. While meditation programs draw inspiration from Buddhist textual sources
for the benefits of meditation, these sources also acknowledge a wide range of other effects
beyond health-related outcomes. The Varieties of Contemplative Experience study investi-
gates meditation-related experiences that are typically underreported, particularly experi-
ences that are described as challenging, difficult, distressing, functionally impairing, and/or
requiring additional support. A mixed-methods approach featured qualitative interviews with
Western Buddhist meditation practitioners and experts in Theravāda, Zen, and Tibetan tradi-
tions. Interview questions probed meditation experiences and influencing factors, including
interpretations and management strategies. A follow-up survey provided quantitative assess-
ments of causality, impairment and other demographic and practice-related variables. The
content-driven thematic analysis of interviews yielded a taxonomy of 59 meditation-related
experiences across 7 domains: cognitive, perceptual, affective, somatic, conative, sense of
self, and social. Even in cases where the phenomenology was similar across participants,
interpretations of and responses to the experiences differed considerably. The associated
valence ranged from very positive to very negative, and the associated level of distress and
functional impairment ranged from minimal and transient to severe and enduring. In order to
determine what factors may influence the valence, impact, and response to any given experi-
ence, the study also identified 26 categories of influencing factors across 4 domains: practi-
tioner-level factors, practice-level factors, relationships, and health behaviors. By identifying
a broader range of experiences associated with meditation, along with the factors that con-
tribute to the presence and management of experiences reported as challenging, difficult, dis-
tressing or functionally impairing, this study aims to increase our understanding of the effects

Introduction
Buddhist meditation practices, which traditionally have been part of an extensive religious
path to awakening (bodhi), are now in the modern Western context also a popular form of
general health promotion that is simultaneously bound to and divorced from its religious
roots. Inspired by Buddhist claims for the possibility of freedom from “suffering” (dukkha),
key Buddhist doctrines and practices have been re-presented within and adapted to psycholog-
ical and biomedical frameworks [1]. In this new context, Buddhist-derived meditation prac-
tices inform treatment programs such as “mindfulness-based interventions” (MBIs), which are
being applied towards the alleviation of a wide range of ailments, including stress [2], addic-
tion [3], chronic pain [4], mood disorders [5], psychiatric disorders [6], and medical condi-
tions [7]. Such programs have also been used to improve cognitive abilities [8] and emotion
regulation [9]. MBIs are being employed at institutional levels, including prisons [10, 11], the
military [12–14], and in both K-12 [15–18] and higher education [19]. With more than 20
mindfulness phone apps [20], mindfulness is major contributor to the billion-dollar medita-
tion industry [21] that serves more than 18 million meditators [22], with 1 million new medita-
tors each year in the United States alone [23].
For its theory and practices, as well as for its legitimacy and authenticity, the mindfulness
movement draws heavily from Buddhist texts and teachings [24, 25]; it also looks to studies of
long-term Buddhist meditators as evidence of meditation’s potential benefits [26–29]. While
these sources are often assumed to be indicative of “the effects of meditation,” the focus on
positive health-related benefits represents only a narrow selection of possible effects that have
been acknowledged within Buddhist traditions both past and present.
Scholars of Buddhist Studies have documented the historical processes responsible for the
current alliance between Buddhism and science [30–32]. Recent scholarship has also addressed
how the modern representation of Buddhism as “secular,” “empirical,” and “scientific” (or a
least compatible with these modern Western values) has led to the success of the mindfulness
movement within biomedical health science and the broader spiritual marketplace, which has
branded mindfulness as relevant and efficacious not for the attainment of religious goals, but
for a project of health, happiness, and well-being believed to have a broader, if not universal,
appeal [33–36]. However, the limited focus on the benefits of meditation for physical and psy-
chological health and well-being is a modern and largely Western creation that neither repre-
sents the diversity of meditation practices nor the range of possible or even likely effects of
those practices.
Many Buddhist literary sources describe how meditation practices are expected to lead to
perceptual, affective, epistemic, and behavioral shifts that lie beyond the scope of the health-
related outcomes that are the concern of MBIs and associated scientific research. Biographical
narratives and stages-of-the-path literature across Buddhist traditions also acknowledge periods
of challenge or difficulty associated with the practice of meditation. In Tibetan Buddhist tradi-
tions, the term nyams refers to a wide range of “meditation experiences”—from bliss and visions
to intense body pain, physiological disorders, paranoia, sadness, anger and fear—which can be a
source of challenge or difficulty for the meditation practitioner [37, 38]. Certain nyams—in par-
ticular the triad of bliss (bde ba), clarity or luminosity (gsal ba), and non-conceptuality (mi rtog

 pa)—are multivalent in that in some lineages of Tibetan Buddhism they are deliberately culti-
vated and framed as “signs of progress,” and yet in other contexts can be dismissed as untrust-
worthy hindrances to genuine insight [39]. In Zen Buddhist traditions, the term makyō refers to
a class of largely perceptual “side-effects” or “disturbing conditions” that arise during the course
of practice and which are also sometimes interpreted as signs of progress [40, 41]. Zen traditions
have also long acknowledged the possibility for certain practice approaches to lead to a pro-
longed illness-like condition known as “Zen sickness” [42] or “meditation sickness” [34]. The
Śūraṅgama Sūtra—a classic text of Mahāyāna Buddhism—enumerates fifty deceptive or illusory
experiences that are associated primarily, though not exclusively, with the practice of concentra-
tion (samādhi). The Sūtra particularly warns about pleasant experiences that lead the meditator
into a false sense of spiritual progress, which results in misguided thinking and conduct [43].
Similarly, in Theravāda Buddhist traditions, progress in the practice of meditation is expected
to lead to transient experiences called “corruptions of insight” (vipassanā-upakkilesā) on ac-
count of meditators’ tendency to confuse these blissful and euphoric states for genuine insight
[44, 45]. Some modern accounts also include reports of monks becoming “mentally unstable”
in the wake of such states [46]. Other stages of practice, in particular some of the “insight knowl-
edges” (vipassanā-ñāṇa), are presented as being particularly challenging, especially in modern
Asian sources [47, 48].
Biographical narratives and stages-of-the-path textual sources cannot necessarily be taken
as straightforward descriptions of the experiences of past Buddhists, as such texts often also
have prescriptive or polemical inclinations [49, 50]. Furthermore, the privileging of experiences
as central to meditation may in some cases reflect modern sensibilities rather than Buddhist
concerns throughout the ages [51]. Nevertheless, Buddhist-derived meditation practices are
often presented in the West in terms of their non-religious health-related outcomes with little
to no attention given to the possibility of the broader range of effects suggested by both tradi-
tional Buddhist sources as well as modern American Buddhist authors [52, 53]. Given that
some of these effects might even run counter to the dominant paradigm of health and well-
being, it is critical that the range of effects associated with Buddhist meditation be investigated
in the modern Western context. In particular, we need to know: What is the range of effects
associated with the practice of meditation in this context? And what effects do people report as
unexpected, challenging, difficult, or distressing? Answering these questions will increase our
knowledge of how Buddhist meditation is understood and practiced in the West, the type of
support structures that are needed for meditation-related challenges, and the potential bound-
ary conditions of applications of meditation for health and well-being.
Previous research on the range of effects from meditation
Beyond the extensive literature on the positive effects of meditation for physical, emotional,
and mental health and well-being, studies of other meditation effects fall into two broad cate-
gories: 1) studies of side effects or adverse effects, and 2) research on anomalous, spiritual,
mystical, or religious experience. The phenomena covered in these two literatures are not nec-
essarily distinct. Rather, the difference in appraisal often reflects the disciplinary perspective
and methodological approach of the researchers involved, as well as the social contexts of the
populations being studied. Providing a comprehensive review of studies on the range of phe-
nomena associated with anomalous, spiritual, mystical, or religious experiences is beyond the
scope of this paper. Instead, this section focuses specifically on recent clinical, experimental,
and qualitative research on the effects of Buddhist or Buddhist-based meditation practices.
Meditation-related effects that are not health-related benefits or that are reported as dis-
tressing have been classified as “side effects” or “adverse effects” (AEs), especially in clinical

 psychology research. While randomized clinical trials are the most reliable source for acquir-
ing accurate information about positive effects, information about adverse effects has not been
readily available for several reasons. First, the vast majority (>75%) of meditation studies do
not actively assess adverse effects [2, 54]; instead, they rely solely on patients to spontaneously
report any difficulties to the researchers or teachers. However, patients are unlikely to volun-
teer information about negative reactions to treatment without being directly asked due to the
influence of authority structures and demand characteristics [55–57]. As a result, passive mon-
itoring is thought to underestimate AE prevalence by more than 20-fold [58]. A few MBI
researchers have started to actively monitor AEs either through questionnaires or through cli-
nician interviews [59–61]. However, these are typically limited to serious AEs (life-threatening
or fatal events) or “deterioration” on pre-existing clinical outcomes that require clinical atten-
tion, such as increased depression or suicidality. These AEs, as well as traumatic flashbacks,
are now listed in the MBI guidelines under “risks to participants” [62].
Meditation-related adverse effects that were serious or distressing enough to warrant addi-
tional treatment have been reported in clinical and medical literature. These include reports of
meditation-induced psychosis, seizures, depersonalization, mania and other forms of clinical
deterioration [63–73]. Descriptions of meditation-induced depersonalization and other clini-
cally relevant problems also appear in the APA’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders [74–76]. While meditation-related difficulties that are serious enough to warrant
treatment are acknowledged in the clinical literature, there continues to be a lack of systematic
investigation into challenging meditation experiences, what causes them, and how to prevent
or manage them.
Reports from meditation practitioners have also been researched within the framework of
anomalous experiences. Such studies are often lab-based experiments that use inductions to
create state-based changes in one or more meditators in order to explore neural correlates
[77–79]. This category includes studies on changes in sense of self [78–81], changes in sense of
time and space [77, 80, 82], and changes in perception [83]. Other research has investigated
trait-based changes in perception following an extended period of meditation practice [27].
Similar to these experimental studies, some qualitative studies have used theory-driven
approaches to anomalous experiences that aim to test a specific hypothesis rather than conduct
an open-ended exploration. For example, Chen et al. (2011) [80] asked Chinese Chan and
Pure Land Buddhist meditators questions based on Hood’s Mysticism Scale in order to investi-
gate whether their experiences provided evidence for a common core of mystical experience.
Through a semi-structured interview, Full et al. (2013) [83] investigated changes in perception
in thirteen advanced Burmese meditation practitioners. While the interview specifically
probed changes in perception and associated benefits of meditation, it lacked a complementary
probe for possible negative effects or an open-ended question to report other types of experi-
ences. In addition, the sample was mostly male, Burmese-authorized lineage holders. While
valuable, these two qualitative studies of meditative experiences are limited in that they were
exclusively of Asian participants, did not ask open-ended questions that allow for a broader
range of experiences associated with meditation to be reported, and did not explicitly assess
the role of the practitioner’s interpretative framework.
For phenomena about which little is known, qualitative studies that ask open-ended ques-
tions are the most informative and produce the richest phenomenological data about medita-
tion-related experiences. In a pioneering project, Kornfield (1979) [84] conducted a mixed-
methods study of American Buddhist meditators during a 3-month Vipassana retreat. While
this study did not specifically probe challenging or difficult experiences, the open-ended query
about “unusual” experiences yielded reports uncommon in the research literature, including
strong negative emotions, involuntary movements, anomalous somatic sensations, and out-of-

 body experiences. More recently, Lomas et al. (2014) [85] asked active meditators to “recount
their involvement with meditation,” and received both positive and negative reports. Medita-
tors reported “exacerbation of psychological problems,” including anxiety and depression,
“troubling experiences of self,” and “reality being challenged,” which included out-of-body
experiences and in one case resulted in patient hospitalization for psychosis. However, the
study was also of an all-male sample almost entirely from one community; in addition, the
authors acknowledge that their sample “arguably excludes people whose experiences of medi-
tation were so troubling as to cause them to cease practicing (since only currently active medi-
tators were recruited).”
In one of the only prospective studies to use qualitative methods to deliberately ask about
adverse effects, Shapiro (1992) [67] found that 63% of meditators on an intensive Vipassana
retreat reported at least one adverse effect, with 7.4% reporting effects negative enough to stop
meditating, and one individual hospitalized for psychosis. VanderKooi (1997) [86] also specifi-
cally queried “difficulties” or “extreme states” with both meditators and the teachers who
helped them navigate their experiences. In a series of case vignettes, the report emphasizes the
challenges of integrating conflicting interpretive frameworks from Buddhism and psychiatry.
The study also illustrates how teachers can be a rich and often under-utilized source of infor-
mation about meditation-related difficulties.
While these studies make important contributions towards an interdisciplinary conversa-
tion about the range of experiences associated with meditation practices in general and Bud-
dhist meditation practices in particular, each methodological approach is associated with its
own set of limitations. Single-person case studies provide some insight into unexpected symp-
toms associated with meditation, but do not get at the broader range of phenomena, nor can
they identify patterns that would help researchers, clinicians, and teachers to investigate what
types of experiences might be expected to arise when certain causal factors are present or
absent. Even larger-scale studies on groups of meditators have indicated that assessing sensi-
tive, socially undesirable experiences such as adverse reactions to meditation requires specific
probes. In clinical, experimental, and qualitative research on meditation alike, the extent to
which adverse meditation experiences are reported is proportional to how specifically they are
queried.
Moreover, the interpretative frameworks and appraisal processes of researchers and sub-
jects alike also frame and impact the results and require special consideration. It is difficult to
discern to what extent the classification of an experience as an “adverse effect,” a “religious
experience,” or any other designation reflects a real difference in phenomenology or is a conse-
quence of an appraisal made either by a meditator, a researcher, or both. Similar challenges
affect research that attempts to compare and differentiate “mystical” or “religious” experiences
from “psychopathology” [87–90] (see Discussion). Instead of attempting to impose an inter-
pretative framework by classifying certain meditation-related experiences as “religious ex-
periences” or alternately as forms of “psychopathology,” a better approach is to identify the
interpretative frameworks held by meditation practitioners or offered by meditation experts
and their impact.
The varieties of contemplative experience research study
The purpose of the current study is to build upon the research summarized above by specifi-
cally addressing the following questions: What is the range of meditation-related effects
described by Buddhist practitioners in the West? What types of experiences do they report as
unexpected, challenging, difficult, distressing, or functionally impairing? What are the hypoth-
esized causes of those experiences? What interpretations are they given by others? What

 impact do these experiences have on the lives of meditation practitioners? How do practition-
ers prevent, manage, navigate, or integrate such experiences? How do teachers guide their stu-
dents through such experiences?
Through qualitative interviews with Western Buddhist meditation practitioners and medi-
tation experts (teachers and clinicians), the Varieties of Contemplative Experience (VCE)
research study attempts to investigate the broader range of experiences associated with medita-
tion practices in the West. In order to better understand the types of experiences that tend to
be under-reported in scientific research, scholarship, and the media, the VCE study inten-
tionally queried experiences that practitioners found unexpected, difficult, distressing, or
functionally impairing. Interviews also asked about the range of interpretations given to expe-
riences, as well as the putative causes of and remedies for difficult experiences. Meditation
experts were also queried for how they interpret and manage challenging experiences that are
reported by their students or patients. In addition to providing descriptions of experiences and
identifying potential influencing factors, the VCE study ultimately aims to provide meditators,
teachers and clinicians with practical management strategies for challenging meditation-
related experiences.
Methods
Qualitative approach and research paradigm
While quantitative methods are appropriate for "known" or “well-characterized phenomena,”
qualitative methods are particularly appropriate when little is known because they “allow for
identification of previously unknown processes, explanations of why and how phenomena
occur, and the range of their effects” [91]. Qualitative methods are used when the goals are
“developing a hypothesis or theory in the early stages of an inquiry, understanding particular
cases in depth and detail, getting at meanings in context, and capturing changes in a dynamic
environment” [92]. Since the VCE study aims to investigate a wide range of meditation-related
experiences as well as to understand how they are integrated into practitioners’ lives, qualita-
tive methodology was the most appropriate approach for undertaking this project because it
allowed participants to describe their experiences in their own words and to offer their own
explanations for them. Attention to these experiences, and the language used to describe them,
is an essential formative step towards building a research strategy for further understanding
them.
In addition to the fundamental principles of qualitative research, our methods are also
informed by other theories and approaches. Our study design and approaches to data analysis
are shaped in part by the attribution theory approach to the study of “experiences deemed reli-
gious” developed by Taves (2008 and 2009) [93, 94] to advance the cognitive science of reli-
gion. By “meditation-related experiences” we are referring to a range of effects across different
domains of human experience that meditation practitioners in our study attributed to one or
more types of meditation. In addition to causal attributions, practitioners and experts alike are
also agents in ascribing significance, meaning, and value to meditation-related experiences,
sometimes in incompatible ways. Our methods are further informed by the cultural psychiatry
approach, which investigates “the ways in which psychopathology and healing are shaped by
cultural knowledge and practices,” and which allows for “local nosologies” and “emic” catego-
ries of experience to inform the analysis [95].
Context
Because the widespread practice of Buddhist meditation in the West is a relatively recent phe-
nomenon, and because Buddhist-derived meditation practices such as “mindfulness” are

 increasingly being deployed in various novel settings such as schools, clinics, and hospitals,
more information is needed on the range of experiences associated with the practice of Bud-
dhist meditation in the West. To capture “ecologically valid” or “real world” scenarios, the
VCE study includes practitioners from multiple traditions who engaged in various meditation
practices in the context of either daily practice or intensive retreat. The relationship between
traditional forms of meditation and their therapeutic applications is still being negotiated, with
many advocates for a deeper relationship between interventions and traditional Buddhist the-
ory and practice [96, 97]. Therefore, assessing the range of experiences reported by practition-
ers in a variety of Buddhist traditions not only provides valuable information about Buddhism
as it is practiced and experienced in the West, it also has the potential to inform MBIs and
other novel interventions derived from Buddhist practices.
Participants
Practitioners.
The VCE study recruited Buddhist meditation practitioners from across
Theravāda, Zen, and Tibetan traditions. Inclusion criteria for practitioners required a mini-
mum age of 18 years, a meditation practice in a Buddhist tradition, and the ability to report on
meditation-related experience that was challenging, difficult, or was associated with significant
physiological or psychological changes, including distress or impairment. Exclusion criteria
for practitioners were a history of unusual psychological experiences prior to learning medita-
tion (e.g., from substance use or mental illness) that closely resembled the experiences they
associated with meditation, a mixed practice history that included a significant influence from
non-Buddhist practices, or the presence of other variables (such as medical illness) that could
causally account for the entire reported symptomology.
Experts.
The VCE study also recruited meditation experts who had either taught exten-
sively in a Buddhist tradition or who had applied Buddhist meditation in clinical settings (or
both). Inclusion criteria for experts were an occupational identity as a meditation teacher in a
Buddhist lineage or as a clinician working with meditation-based therapies.
Sampling strategy
Subject recruiting.
The overall sampling strategy was purposive, where cases are selected
“based on a specific purpose rather than randomly” [98]. Specifically, we used “deviant case
sampling” or “outlier sampling” where participants are selected on the extreme ends of a dis-
tribution in order to investigate under-reported phenomena, which for this study were chal-
lenging, difficult, or distressing experiences associated with meditation [99]. Recruitment
employed both special case sampling [99] and snowball or chain sampling [100] to meet differ-
ent aims. In order to investigate the range of meditation-related experiences that occur under
standard or optimal conditions, special case sampling was used to select experienced teachers
or lineage-holders from well-respected meditation centers. These teachers could provide two
different kinds of interviews: interviews about their own experiences (practitioner interview)
and/or experiences they had observed in their students (expert interview). Teachers who con-
tributed interviews subsequently provided VCE study contact information to students with
notable or challenging experiences, many of whom in turn provided VCE study contact infor-
mation to fellow meditators. Selection of subjects proceeded iteratively to ensure a balanced
gender ratio and equal representation across different Buddhist meditative traditions.
Sample size.
Sample size was based on two stratification variables: gender and Buddhist
tradition. Because we sought 10 males and 10 females for each of the three Buddhist traditions
(Theravāda, Zen, and Tibetan), our target sample size was 60. After the initial 30 interviews,
and again when the targeted sample was achieved, we reviewed the data, assessing the range

 and saturation of reported experiences, to determine if additional interviews were needed.
Additionally, because initial qualitative coding proceeded while recruitment and interviewing
was ongoing, this allowed us to assess saturation with respect to reported meditation experi-
ences multiple times.
Researcher characteristics and reflexivity
The Varieties of Contemplative Experience study was executed by an interdisciplinary research
team comprised of a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (WB), three religious studies
scholars (JL, DC, NF), and a qualitative methodologist trained in both medical anthropology
and behavioral medicine (RR). Interviewers had practical expertise and/or academic expertise
with one or more of the three main Buddhist meditation traditions being researched. In order
to establish rapport with interview subjects and to be able to engage with tradition-specific
practices or terminology, interviewers were regularly matched with interview subjects practic-
ing in the traditions in which they had one or more forms of expertise. Interviewers received
training in qualitative methods and interviewing procedures, including sitting in on interviews
and reviewing transcripts. The interdisciplinary nature of our team required that interpretive
and disciplinary perspectives be made explicit. Any theory-driven approaches to qualitative
analysis aimed to be representative of multiple interpretive and disciplinary perspectives, as
well as faithful to the reports from the practitioners themselves.
Ethical issues pertaining to human subjects
The study protocol and consent procedure was approved by the Brown University Institu-
tional Review Board. All participants reviewed a consent form and provided informed consent
before participating in the study. Documentation of written consent was waived for this study
because most interviews took place remotely via telephone or video conferencing. Instead, par-
ticipants provided verbal consent, which was recorded in a password-protected database on a
secure server. All practitioners were de-identified, and their names were replaced with a sub-
ject ID number. Potentially identifying information, such as names of centers, spouses and
geographical locations, was omitted from transcripts.
Data collection methods
Interviews were conducted between December 2010 and March 2016 via telephone, video con-
ferencing, or in person either by the PIs (WB, JL) or by other study personnel (NF, DC, and
others). Interview duration was typically between 45 and 120 minutes. Data collection instru-
ments were adapted iteratively to optimally balance structured and unstructured components
of the interview, with the dual aim of facilitating exploration of the topic and the ability to
compare data across practitioners [101]. Given the exploratory, content-driven nature of the
study, both practitioner and expert interviews were semi-structured. While demographic
information was often reported during the course of the interview, the importance of specific
factors such as early life relationships, psychiatric history, and trauma history emerged during
the course of the study. In order to ensure consistent and comparable information for all prac-
titioners, a follow-up questionnaire was employed to gather comprehensive demographic
information and detailed assessments of causality and impairment (see Additional instruments
and quantitative measures).

 Measures and instruments
Practitioner interview protocol. Because the varieties of meditation-related experiences
have not been well documented in scientific and scholarly literature, it was crucial that the
study participants drive the interview content, not the researchers. Therefore, we developed a
semi-structured interview protocol that emphasized open-ended questions (see S1 File). Inter-
views covered three general domains: phenomenology, interpretations, and remedies. Inter-
views also included questions about personal background and practice history.
The central part of the interview involved detailed descriptions of meditation-related expe-
riences, or phenomenology. Questions included variants of “What kinds of experiences have
you had as a result of meditation?” and “Have you had any significant experiences that were
unexpected, challenging, or difficult?” When reporting on the phenomenology of their experi-
ence, practitioners were encouraged to refrain from using tradition-specific jargon such as
“jhāna,” “satori,” or “kuṇḍalinī”; rather, if these terms arose, interviewers requested that practi-
tioners attempt to explain those concepts in their own descriptive language. Interviewers also
asked participants to describe the contextual factors associated with the onset of challenging or
difficult meditation-related experiences by following-up with probing questions, such as “How
much were you meditating at this time?” or “Were there any notable life circumstances at this
time?” Practitioners were also asked questions about impact (variants of “How did these expe-
riences impact your life?”) and causal attribution (“What is the reason you associate these
experiences with meditation?”) unless the material had already been volunteered in the narra-
tive report of their experiences.
Questions querying interpretations and explanatory frameworks included some variants of
“How did you interpret your experiences?” and “How did other people interpret your experi-
ences?” Practitioners were thus asked to provide their own interpretation of what happened as
well as to report interpretations others provided them. Practitioners were also encouraged to
identify where their own understanding of their meditation experiences deviated significantly
from the interpretations given to them by teachers, texts, community members, or other au-
thorities such as psychiatrists, friends, or relatives. Separately querying practitioners’ own
interpretations of their experiences and others’ interpretations allowed us to disambiguate the
range of phenomena associated with meditation from the ways in which these phenomena are
interpreted—sometimes in divergent ways—in different sociocultural contexts. This allowed
us to understand the role of other agents in the appraisal and meaning-making processes sur-
rounding unexpected and difficult meditation experiences.
Practitioners were also asked to describe the conditions that led to the effects they associate
with meditation through the main questions querying causality (variants of “What is the rea-
son you associate these experiences with meditation?” and “Are there any other factors that
you think may have influenced the nature or course of your meditation experiences?”). Salient
contextual factors and demographic variables identified earlier in the interview were often
revisited or explored in greater detail through follow-up questions.
Finally, questions concerning remedies included variants of “How did you and others
respond to these experiences?” and “What was helpful and what was unhelpful for addressing
or managing your experiences?” These questions identified the types of strategies and remedies
practitioners attempted as well as the extent to which they were perceived as effective. An
explicit aim of the study is not only to identify meditation-related experiences that have the
potential to be challenging, difficult, distressing, or functionally impairing, but also to provide
information about potentially effective methods for managing them.
Expert interview protocol. Expert practitioners were asked about their training, knowl-
edge base, and institutional affiliations. The interview then proceeded to inquire into

 experiences meditation teachers or clinicians have seen in their students or patients, how they
interpret these experiences, and what they think are the causes of, influences on, responses to,
and remedies for these experiences (see S2 File). Because they were not reporting on their own
experiences, expert interviews tended to provide much less specific data on phenomenology.
As a result, expert interviews focused more on the identification of the causes of, interpreta-
tions of, and remedies for meditation-related difficulties.
Additional instruments and quantitative measures
Demographics and attributes form. A follow-up questionnaire was distributed to practi-
tioners through an online platform after all interviews were completed in order to obtain stan-
dardized answers on key questions. Items queried practitioner demographics such as personal
history, meditation practice history, and type, degree, and duration of impairment. Psychiatric
history queried the diagnosed or suspected presence of the ten most common psychiatric dis-
orders in epidemiological studies, including anxiety, mood, psychotic, eating and substance
abuse disorders [102, 103]. Trauma history queried the presence or absence of the most com-
monly experienced (“Criterion A”) traumas, including physical/sexual/emotional abuse or
neglect; loss, injury or death of a family member or caregiver (as a child); and experience or
witnessing of life-threatening injury/illness, rape, violence, death, or warfare (at any age) [104–
106]. Additional items queried include influencing factors such as types of support from teach-
ers, therapists, or friends; the degree of helpfulness of specific remedies or treatment modali-
ties; meditation causality (see below); and severity of distress and impairment (see below).
Causality assessment.
In the current study, causal attribution to meditation was assessed
according to the causality assessment criteria that regulatory agencies such as the World Health
Organization (WHO), the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) use to make health policy decisions [107–110]. These criteria are designed to
assess causality of treatment-related adverse events in individual cases in the absence of prospec-
tive or epidemiological (base rate) data. Thirteen standard causality criteria typically include 1)
prior published reports, 2) expert judgment, 3) subjective attribution, 4) temporal proximity
(challenge), 5) exacerbation, 6) de-challenge, 7) re-challenge, 8) specificity, 9–11) three types of
consistency, 12) biological gradient, and 13) linkage to known biological mechanisms [108,
111–117].
The current study assessed the first 11 criteria. Prior published reports included case reports
or studies about unusual or challenging meditation-related experiences in the scientific or clin-
ical literature. Expert judgment was derived from interviews with 32 meditation teachers and
clinicians. The following six criteria were assessed as part of the demographics and attributes
follow-up questionnaire or, in the case of non-responders, extracted from the interview tran-
script: 1) causal attribution to meditation by the subject (subjective attribution); 2) temporal
proximity to (either during or following) meditation practice (challenge); 3) exacerbation of
pre-existing symptoms following meditation; 4) occurrence on more than one occasion (con-
sistency); 5) decrease when practice is reduced (de-challenge); 6) re-appearance when practice
is repeated (re-challenge). A causality score was calculated as the sum of endorsements of these
six criteria. Using standard guidelines [118], a score of two or greater, signifying “possibly
related,” was the cutoff for inclusion.
Specificity—or the likelihood of a cause other than meditation—was evaluated at two levels.
If an alternative cause such as medical illness or pre-existing psychological conditions could
have wholly accounted for the experiences reported, then these subjects failed to meet causality
criteria and were excluded. In the remaining practitioners, specific experiences that could not
be directly linked to meditation or that were attributed to other causes (e.g., drug use, prior

 psychiatric or medical history, or a period in life prior to learning meditation) were not coded
for phenomenology (see below: Phenomenology coding).
The consistency criterion was assessed at three levels: intra-subjective, inter-subjective, and
cross-modal. Intra-subjective consistency refers to the same or a similar experience occurring
in close temporal proximity (during or following) to meditation on more than one occasion
within the same individual. Inter-subjective consistency refers to the same or a similar experi-
ence occurring during or following meditation in multiple individuals. Cross-modal consis-
tency refers to different classes of sources (practitioners and experts) reporting the same or a
similar experience during or following meditation (i.e. source triangulation).
Severity assessment.
Degree of associated distress and impairment were scored according
to standard severity criteria for adverse events, which are based upon a combination of dura-
tion, distress, and functional impairment [118, 119]. Impairment was defined as difficulty
engaging in one’s usual activities, whether social, occupational, or leisure. “Mild impairment”
was defined as mild or transient distress and less than 25% reduction in usual functioning.
“Moderate impairment” was defined by a 25–50% transient reduction in functioning or
requiring outpatient treatment. “Severe impairment” was defined by a 50% or more reduction
in functioning, persistent impairment, or requiring inpatient treatment. Participants were
asked to score (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for multiple domains of im-
pairment (e.g., physical, cognitive, social, occupational), as well as indicate suicidality or inpa-
tient hospitalization.
Data processing
Interviews were digitally recorded, and audio files were transcribed by study personnel in the
Clinical and Affective Neuroscience Lab at Brown University. Practitioner interviews were
rendered verbatim, but vocalizations such as “um,” “like,” “kind of,” and “you know” as well as
identifying information were removed. Names of teachers and Buddhist centers of study and
practice were removed when this information could be used to identify the practitioner—for
instance, if they were lineage holders in a tradition where the teacher had only a few direct dis-
ciples. Names of friends and family members, universities attended, and states of residence
were also removed. Transcripts were then verified by a separate research assistant or study per-
sonnel to ensure accurate rendering of content. When necessary, religious studies scholars (JL,
DC) were consulted to ensure accurate rendering of names of teachers, institutions, and places
as well as tradition-specific foreign language terminology.
Data analysis
Qualitative data analysis is a systematic means of organizing and then describing interview
data. We used an exploratory, content-driven thematic analysis—where the analytical catego-
ries that are used to establish comparisons across reports derive primarily from the reports
themselves—because this is the method that is recommended when there is little former
knowledge about a phenomenon [101, 120]. Through this approach, we were able to establish
systematic descriptions of reports of specific aspects of meditation experiences (phenomenol-
ogy) as well as of specific interpretations, causal attributions, and remedies (influencing fac-
tors). The qualitative data analysis used open coding techniques [121], which are intended to
“open up” the text in order to uncover its content and meaning. Following DeCuir-Gunby
et al. (2011) [122], a “data-driven” approach was augmented by the incorporation of some
“theory-driven” categories already existent in the literature on meditation, psychology, or phe-
nomenology (e.g., [84, 123]). The coding structure was revised iteratively until saturation was

 reached—i.e., when new interviews produced little or no new data and no changes to the exist-
ing coding structure [101].
Codebook creation and revision.
Reports of meditation experiences (phenomenology) as
well as interpretations, causal factors, and remedies (influencing factors) were entered into
computer-based qualitative analysis software (NVivo) for analysis. Following the methodology
of open coding, and in particular the team-based approach summarized by Fonteyn et al.
(2008) [124], coders assigned a tentative heading or category to each unit of analysis. They
then read and coded the transcript until all relevant aspects of the content were categorized.
The coding structure evolved from the initial open coding towards a defined codebook of
recurring categories. Each category was given a standardized definition, inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria, and an example excerpt [124, 125]. To define codebook categories in a way that
was faithful to the reports of study participants, specific language or phrasing from interview
transcripts was often incorporated into category descriptions, inclusion criteria, and exclusion
criteria [101].
Phenomenology coding. Following a data-driven approach, interview content deter-
mined the codebook categories, which were organized into higher-order domains. To validate
the phenomenology codebook, interviews illustrating a variety of categories were selected and
coded independently by multiple researchers. Once a draft codebook had been established, the
first 30 interviews were then recoded by pairs of researchers, and any disagreements led to iter-
ative discussions that refined coding criteria until consensus was achieved. This draft code-
book was then applied during the coding of the next 30 interview transcripts. In this phase,
coders continued to track discrepancies within the coding structure, and interview content not
represented by an existing category was coded as “other” according to its higher-order domain.
After 60 interviews had been coded, all annotations and all content coded as “other” was
reviewed, and the codebook was again revised. The addition, elimination, merging or reloca-
tion of categories, as well as discrepancies between previous codes and revised codes, was
discussed until consensus among coders was reached. The final coding structure was then
implemented by two coders (JL or DC) across all interview transcripts. A subset (15%) of prac-
titioner interview transcripts were coded by both coders to ensure interrater reliability for the
phenomenology codebook. Agreement ranged from 97% to 100% with an average agreement
across categories of 99.5% (weighted kappa = .70).
Influencing factors (IFs) coding. Through coding phenomenology, it became apparent
that there was little overall consensus on which meditation-related experiences are “beneficial,”
“desired,” “positive,” or a “goal” of practice, and likewise there was little consensus on which
experiences are “adverse,” “unwanted,” “negative,” or a “side-effect” of practice. Rather, whether
a specific phenomenological category is reported as positive or negative—or as a goal or a side-
effect—depends in part upon a complex process of appraisals and interpretive frameworks. For
the purpose of better understanding how reports of experiences and various causes and inter-
pretive frameworks interact in practitioner narratives, our qualitative analysis employed one
coding structure for the reports of meditation-related experiences and a separate coding struc-
ture for interpretations, causal attributions, and responses or remedies.
Influencing factors (IFs) are comprised of the interpretive ascriptions concerning the signif-
icance and value of various meditation-related experiences, the causal attributions practition-
ers or experts made regarding the onset of meditation-related challenges, and the means for
navigating or alleviating those challenges. The various causal factors that practitioners or
experts believed impacted the presence or absence of certain meditation-related experiences
were often presented in tandem with interpretive statements about the meaning, value, or
valence of those experiences. Remedies refer to particular behaviors, approaches, activities, or
contexts that they believed to be helpful in either preventing or alleviating meditation-related
The varieties of contemplative experience

 difficulties or the amount of distress and impairment associated with those experiences.
Because many factors, such as relationships to teachers, were reported as risk factors by some
practitioners and as remedies by others, risk factors and remedies were coded together under
the framework of IFs.
Meditation practices are embedded both in broader systems of thought and in sociocultural
contexts, and in some cases it was difficult to disambiguate attributions made exclusively to
the techniques versus attributions made to the worldviews, value-systems, and social relation-
ships associated with those techniques. The IFs codebook attempts to capture the various types
of attributions practitioners and experts made in the process of attempting to explain the
causal onset of meditation-related experiences reported as challenging, difficult, distressing, or
functionally impairing.
Because expert interviews provided a second-person perspective on challenging meditation
experiences they had seen and managed in their students or patients, they were a richer source
of information for influencing factors than for phenomenology. Consequently, the IFs code-
book was developed iteratively by coding expert transcripts. The methods for coding IFs and
for validating the IFs codebook followed the procedure detailed above for phenomenology. To
ensure interrater reliability, a team of three coders re-coded fifteen percent of expert interview
transcripts (each transcript coded by two coders). Agreement ranged from 93% to 100% with
an average agreement across categories of 97.5% (weighted kappa = .56).
Results
Participant flow
A total of 73 meditation practitioners completed interviews. Thirteen practitioner interviews
were excluded from the current analysis for failure to meet inclusion criteria. Specifically,
interviews with five practitioners revealed a mixed practice history that precluded clear classifi-
cation as Theravāda, Zen, or Tibetan and/or included a significant influence from non-Bud-
dhist meditation practices such as Hindu traditions or the use of technology-based meditation
apps. Four practitioners were excluded from the current analysis for failing to report any chal-
lenging experiences. Four practitioners were excluded because their phenomenology could be
accounted for by alternative causes. The remaining 60 practitioners were given the demo-
graphic and attributes form after all interviews were completed; 100% of respondents met cau-
sality assessment criteria (score>2, mean 4.2 ±1.1) and were included in the present analysis.
Fifty-three practitioners (88%) completed the follow-up questionnaire. For the 7 (12%)
non-completers, information was extracted by researchers based upon the content of their
interview transcript. Results are based on a sample size of 60 practitioners unless otherwise
indicated (i.e., in the case that one or more participants declined to answer a survey item and/
or did not volunteer the information during the interview).
Sample characteristics
Practitioners.
Participants were 60 Buddhist meditators (43% female, 57% male, mean
age = 48.9 years, SD = 13.1, range 18–76) with equal representation (n = 20) across Theravāda,
Zen, and Tibetan lineages. Given the study location and sampling strategy, most practitioners
were from the United States (85%), with the remainder from Europe (8%), Canada (5%), or
Mexico (2%). Participants were predominantly White (94.5%), with professional occupations,
and had high levels of educational attainment. All but two had completed college, 25 (42%)
had a Master’s degree, and 15 (25%) had an MD, a PhD or equivalent. Sixty percent of the
practitioner sample identified as meditation teachers. Eleven of those practitioners provided
subsequent expert interviews in which they described the experiences they had observed in

 their students, how they interpreted those experiences, and how they managed those students.
While the sample represented a range of meditative expertise, nearly half of the sample (43%)
had more than 10,000 lifetime hours of practice at the time of the interview (see Table 1).
Experts.
In addition to the practitioner interviews, 32 experts were also interviewed (25%
female, 75% male), 11 (34%) of whom previously provided practitioner interviews. Experts
were 13 (40%) Theravādin, 8 (25%) Zen, 6 (19%) Tibetan, and 5 (16%) Clinical. In addition to
the clinicians, four other meditation teachers also reported having clinical training (e.g., MA,
MSW, PhD, PsyD or MD).
Types of meditation.
Practitioners were engaged in a variety of Buddhist meditation
practices (see Table 2). Some practices, such as placing attention on one’s breathing, were
reported across traditions. Others, such as body scan, kōan practice, or visualization, were
unique to particular traditions or lineages within those traditions.

 Context and practice at the onset of meditation-related challenges
The amount of meditation practice prior to the onset of challenging or difficult experiences
ranged from 1 day to more than 25 years (mean = 7.1 years; SD = 8.0 years). More than a quar-
ter (29%) of practitioners first encountered challenges within their first year of practice, almost
one half (45%) between 1–10 years of practice, and one quarter (25%) after more than 10 years
of practice. Seven participants (12%) reported challenges during the first 10 days of their prac-
tice, and 11 participants (18%) reported challenges during the first 50 hours of practice.
Challenges occurred during or immediately following a retreat for 43 practitioners (72%).
The other 17 practitioners (28%) reported challenging experiences in the context of daily prac-
tice. About three-quarters (72%) of participants were regularly practicing within a meditation
community or were working with a teacher (75%) when challenging experiences arose. At the
time of meditation-related challenges, 14 practitioners (25%) were practicing meditation for
30–60 minutes per day, 19 (34%) were practicing for 1–9 hours per day, and 23 (41%) were
practicing for 10 or more hours per day (see Table 3).
Phenomenology: Domains and categories
Thematic content analysis of practitioner interviews for phenomenology captured the various
types of experiences that practitioners associated with meditation. Fifty-nine categories of medi-
tation-related effects were clustered into 7 higher-order domains (see Table 4). All practitioners
reported meditation-related changes across multiple domains. The average number of domains
reported per practitioner was 6.1 (SD = 1.00), with a range from 3–7. Nearly three-quarters
(73%) of practitioners reported 6 or more domains, with coverage of all 7 domains as the most
common pattern (43%). Each domain was reported by at least three-quarters of the sample.
The number of categories in each domain varied, ranging from 3–15. The average number
of total categories reported per practitioner was 19.6 (SD = 7.2), with a range from 7–40. Half
of the sample (50%) reported more than 20 categories, with 10% reporting more than 30, and
5% reporting less than 10. Each category was reported by an average of 20 different partici-
pants (SD = 10.2), with a range from 2 (for scrupulosity) to 49 (for fear), indicating both maxi-
mal consistency and range.
Table 4 displays the seven domains horizontally from left to right. The categories of each
domain are listed vertically in descending order of frequency (percent of practitioners
reporting).

 As a group, the 32 experts reported 56 out of 59 (95%) phenomenology categories, with an
average of 8.5 categories (SD = 5.6) per expert. The three categories that were reported by prac-
titioners but not experts were: Crying, laughing; Distortions in time or space; and Fatigue, weak-
ness. While a detailed comparison between meditators’ and experts’ reports of meditation-
related experiences is beyond the scope of this paper, it is worth noting that three of the catego-
ries most frequently reported by practitioners—Fear, anxiety, panic, or paranoia (82%), Posi-
tive affect (75%), and Somatic energy (63%) were also among the most commonly reported
by experts (72%, 50%, and 41% respectively). Re-experiencing of traumatic memories also had
similar frequencies for experts (47%) and practitioners (43%). These similarities between prac-
titioner and experts reports were not impacted by the 11 participants who provided both prac-
titioner and expert interviews. Experts’ data remained unchanged regardless of whether those

 11 individuals were included or excluded from analysis. However, as explained above, because
expert interviews provided second-person reports about their students, their accounts were
less informative for phenomenology coding than practitioner interviews. They provided fewer
reports and those reports were characterized by less precise descriptions such as “emotional
problems” or “mental instability.”
Description of phenomenology domains
The following summary is intended to provide some basic descriptions of categories beyond
the category titles in Table 4. As described above, phenomenology categories were largely
data-driven—that is, based upon the language and concepts used by practitioners in reporting
their experiences during the interview. However, in later iterations of the codebook, it was
important to refine category descriptions and distinctions in order to ensure that categories
could encompass reports from multiple individuals as well as the language and perspectives
from appraisals both within and beyond Buddhist traditions. To further refine distinctions, for
some categories this data-driven approach was augmented by a theory-driven approach by
drawing upon etic concepts from psychology, neuroscience, phenomenology, and religious
studies. Given the number of categories, the number of references for each category, and the
complex relationship among categories, a complete and detailed exploration of each category
is beyond the scope of this paper. The summaries of each domain provided below will be
unpacked in much greater depth in subsequent publications and should therefore be regarded
as preliminary. For a comprehensive description of each category, including brief descriptions,
inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria, see S4 File.
Cognitive.
Changes reported in this domain pertain to mental functioning, including the
frequency, quality and content of thoughts, as well as other cognitive processes, such as planning,
decision-making and memory. Three cognitive changes associated with concentration—mental
stillness (periods of few or no thoughts), clarity (whether of cognitive processing or of awareness
more generally), and meta-cognition (monitoring of cognitive processes)—were given various
positive and negative associations depending upon their intensity and how they intersected with
other changes in perceptual, somatic, affective, or sense of self domains. Scrupulosity, or obses-
sive and repetitive thoughts about ethical behavior, was primarily a concern for practitioners in
a monastic context where adherence to ethical norms and regulations was considered integral
to meditation practice. Changes in worldview pertained to shifts in ways of thinking about the
nature of self or reality, including confusion about such views. The principal impairments in
the cognitive domain were problems with executive functioning (inability to concentrate for
extended periods, or problems with memory) and the disintegration of conceptual meaning struc-
tures, where percepts and concepts became disconnected. Increased cognitive processing speed,
colloquially described as “mind racing,” also tended to be reported as unpleasant, and vivid
imagery was given positive or negative valence depending on the content or intensity.
The category that the research team had the greatest difficulty operationalizing was
delusional, irrational, or paranormal beliefs, in part because a particular belief could be
appraised in multiple ways depending on the practitioner and his or her social context. In
addition to beliefs described by the practitioner in retrospect as delusional or irrational in
nature (e.g., disconfirmed by objective evidence), this category also included beliefs that
seemed unusual or concerning either to an authority in their culture or subculture, such as a
meditation teacher, or to a family member. When transient, delusional beliefs tended to have
little impact; however, when enduring and coupled with a loss of reality testing, delusional
beliefs had a much greater impact and tended to lead to functional impairment and changes in
the social domain.

 Perceptual.
The perceptual domain captures changes to any of the five senses: vision,
hearing, smell, taste and somatosensory processing (including interoception and propriocep-
tion). One common change in this domain was hypersensitivity to light, sound, or sensation.
Visual hypersensitivity often began with increased color vividness (hyperchromia). Related
phenomena included a general brightening of the visual field, which was sometimes associated
with simple hallucinations in the form of visual lights; these two phenomena have been dis-
cussed in detail in an analysis of preliminary data from this study [126]. Perceptual hypersensi-
tivity was also commonly associated with increased cognitive processing, and tended to be
reported as distressing during transitions from intensive practice into daily life. Within prac-
tice traditions where concentration on the fleeting nature of percepts is a common approach,
practitioners reported the dissolution of perceptual objects; in some cases, the cessation of all
visual perception was reported. Other perceptual distortions included distortions in time and
space, and derealization—where phenomena appear dreamlike, unreal, two-dimensional or as
if in a fog [127].
Illusions (distortions of perceptual objects) and hallucinations (a percept-like experience in
the absence of a sensory stimulus) [128] were reported both in isolation from and in conjunc-
tion with delusional beliefs. Some practitioners also reported phenomena that were technically
hallucinations—in the sense that they were percepts in the absence of an external stimulus—
but were interpreted as visions and attributed to an external agent or force. Unlike some other
hallucinations, visions tended to be transient and did not appear outside of a formal medita-
tion session. Somatosensory changes included changes in body schema, whether heightened
interoception or distorted perceptions of body parts, which could also take on a quality similar
to illusions.
Affective.
Affective changes refer to changes in the type, frequency, or intensity of emo-
tions. A wide range of emotional changes was reported, capturing both discrete (primary)
experiences and also responses to changes in other domains (secondary). Practitioners re-
ported having both increased as well as decreased emotionality. In terms of increased emotion-
ality, fear, anxiety, panic or paranoia was the most frequently reported category, not only in
the affective domain, but across all domains, with 82% of practitioners reporting it. Often the
fear or anxiety was an additional response of negative affect that coincided with other unex-
pected or undesired changes, but in some cases fear was non-referential and was reported as a
phenomenological change unto itself. Increased emotionality also took the form of increased
affective lability, sensitivity, or reactivity in response either to people or to other environmental
stimuli. Emotional sensitivity to others often manifested as empathic and affiliative changes (in-
creased feelings of empathy, or sharing others’ emotions) between the practitioner and other
human beings. In contrast to increased emotionality, some practitioners reported having
fewer or less intense emotions or affective flattening, sometimes even the complete absence of
emotions.
Positive affect, including bliss and euphoria were also commonly reported, but sometimes
were followed by subsequent depression or agitation, either within the context of a practice or
in the transition from formal practice to daily life. In some cases, depression became sufficiently
severe to result in suicidal ideation. In other cases, intense positive affect did not alternate with
low arousal states, but instead escalated into destabilizing conditions resembling mania and
psychosis, which often required hospitalization. It should be noted that neither “mania” nor
“psychosis” were phenomenological categories in our coding structure, even if practitioners,
or more commonly, experts used such terms to describe an experience. Rather, because our
categories aimed to capture distinguishable components of experience, what practitioners
referred to as “mania” was found to be typically composed of a combination of positive affect
and increased processing speed, and in some cases, delusions.

 Changes in doubt and faith as well as self-conscious emotions (guilt, shame, pride, etc.) were
often secondary responses to other meditation experiences and typically had an impact in the
social domain as well. Although typically a secondary response, shame in particular was a large
contributor to levels of distress. For practitioners with a trauma history, it was not uncommon
for them to report a re-experiencing of traumatic memories, and even practitioners without a
trauma history similarly reported an upwelling of emotionally-charged psychological material.
Practitioners reported involuntary crying or laughter in response to positive affective content
such as bliss or joy, in response to negative affective content like grief or sadness, or in some
cases without content altogether. Other states of negative affect included increased agitation or
irritability, which could become intensified to either transient outbursts or long-term expres-
sions of anger and aggression.
Somatic.
The somatic domain included observable changes in bodily functioning or phys-
iological processes. The study documented a large number of physiological changes, many of
which were infrequently reported across subjects. Dizziness or syncope, gastrointestinal distress,
cardiac irregularity, breathing irregularity, fatigue, headaches and sexuality-related changes were
all reported by fewer than 20 participants. A more commonly reported physiological effect was
changes in sleep need, amount, or quality, with practitioners tending to report loss of sleep
need, decreased sleep amount, or insomnia (see also [129]). Other sleep-related changes in-
cluded parasomnias such as nightmares and vivid or lucid dreams. Sleep-related changes fre-
quently co-occurred with appetitive changes, especially a decrease in appetite or food intake.
Thermal changes included both feeling warmer and colder throughout the body, and more
localized sensations of heat and cold.
One principal set of changes in the somatic category included reports of pressure and ten-
sion in the body, or sometimes intense pain, which would become more acute or release in the
course of contemplative practice. The release of pressure or tension was sometimes associated
with positive affect and surges in energy; however, it was also associated with the re-experienc-
ing of traumatic memories and other forms of negative affect. In some cases, the release of ten-
sion was associated with reports of electricity-like “voltage” or “currents” of somatic energy
surging through the body. Somatic energy could be under practitioners’ control or beyond
their control. This was the most commonly reported experience in the somatic domain and
was associated with a wide range of other somatic changes as well as changes in other domains.
For instance, when surges in somatic energy were particularly strong, involuntary body move-
ments sometimes followed.
Conative.
The conative domain primarily denotes changes in motivation or goal-directed
behaviors. This change frequently co-occurred with changes in worldview and changes in the
social domain. Another conative change was the reported amount of effort or striving associ-
ated with meditation practice. On the one hand, practices that previously required great effort
sometimes became effortless, a change generally reported as a positive. On the other hand,
increased levels of effort or “striving” were also described as corresponding with increased
arousal with corresponding affective, perceptual, and somatic changes that could be associated
with unpleasant or destabilizing conditions. The two phenomena practitioners reported as
impairing in the conative domain were the lack of desire for activities one previously enjoyed
(anhedonia) and the loss of motivation to pursue goals (avolition). These often co-occurred
with other functional impairments, such as changes in social or occupational behaviors. When
conative phenomena were described less as changes in and of themselves and more as causal
factors for the onset or alleviation of difficulties, they were coded as influencing factors (see
Influencing factors: Domains and categories).
Sense of self.
Given that the sense of self is construed in multiple ways—from fundamen-
tal embodied sensorimotor activity to more complex conceptual judgments—various changes
The varieties of contemplative experience

 in sense of self were differentiated according to data-driven reports and theory-driven perspec-
tives from phenomenology and cognitive science (e.g.,[130]). Changes in the narrative self refer
to shifts in how a practitioner conceives of himself or herself over time, often in relation to the
identities, worldviews, values, goals or behaviors both within and beyond their Buddhist tradi-
tion. Other changes in sense of self occurred at more fundamental levels that had a corre-
sponding impact on cognitive, affective, somatic, or perceptual domains. For instance, changes
in sense of embodiment referred to feeling displaced from one’s ordinary location relative to
one’s body schema, and detailed descriptions of this phenomena highlighted corresponding
affective and perceptual changes in particular.
The most common change in sense of self reported by practitioners was a change in self-
other or self-world boundaries, which took many related forms. Some practitioners reported
boundaries dissolving and general permeability with the environment or with other people;
others felt like their self had expanded out from their body and merged with the world; still
others used the inverse language, reporting that the world had become merged with their
sense of self. A range of different affective responses were associated with this change, from
neutral curiosity, to bliss and joy, to fear and terror. Loss of sense of ownership was commonly
reported in relation to thoughts, emotions, and body sensations. Practitioners also reported a
loss of sense of agency—or the loss of a “doer” of actions—in relation to automatic actions such
as crying, to habitual actions such as walking, and to typically intentional actions such as
speaking. Some practitioners reported even more fundamental changes in their sense of self
akin to a loss of the sense of basic self [131] or the minimal self [132] such that they felt like they
no longer existed at all or that they would disappear or be invisible to others.
Social.
The social domain includes any changes in interpersonal activities or functioning,
including level of engagement, quality of relationships, or periods of conflict, isolation or with-
drawal. The social domain tends to involve either experiences that catalyzed meditation diffi-
culties or, conversely, were the consequence of meditation difficulties. Social factors were
described as catalysts for difficulties in integration following retreat or intensive practice where
transitioning from a practice context (whether in daily life or on retreat) to a non-practice
(and often social) context were experienced as destabilizing. For example, perceptual, affective,
and cognitive changes that were not problems in the practice context became difficulties that
were reported as negatively valenced or impairing of functioning at work or with family. Social
impairment includes both these instances as well as instances where practice-related difficulties
continued into daily life. This domain also includes changes in occupational functioning, which
often requires social interactions. A generally positive but less commonly reported change was
an increased sociality, defined as an increased extraversion or valuing of social connections.
Changes in relationship to meditation community (including both teachers and other practi-
tioners) included feelings of support and encouragement as well as feelings of estrangement or
rejection, often co-occurring with changes in worldview and changes in doubt or faith, espe-
cially when challenging meditation experiences resulted in significant distress or functional
impairment. Other aspects of social relationships described as contributing to the onset or res-
olution of challenging meditation experiences were coded as Influencing Factors under the
Relationship domain (see Influencing factors: Domains and categories).
Causality criteria
Causal attribution to meditation was assessed with 11 criteria (see above Additional instru-
ments and quantitative measures: Causality assessment). Prior published reports included more
than 40 published reports, including case reports or studies [64, 65, 67–73, 77–79, 82, 84–86,
133–146], reviews of meditation-related risks, adverse effects or contraindications, [63, 147–

 154], medical textbooks [74–76, 155] and MBI implementation guidelines [62]. Expert judg-
ment was derived from interviews with 32 meditation teachers and clinicians who reported 56
categories of meditation-related experiences that they had observed in their students.
Through the causality assessment section of the demographic and attributes follow-up
questionnaire, practitioners reported on six causality criteria: subjective attribution, temporal
proximity (challenge), exacerbation, consistency, de-challenge, and re-challenge. Meditation
practitioners met an average of four causality criteria (mean = 4.2 ±1.1 range = 2–6;), with
more than half (60%) meeting four, five, or all six criteria, well-exceeding the minimum cutoff
of two that standard guidelines use to warrant further investigation [118]. Table 5 shows the
percent of the sample meeting each individual criterion.
The consistency criterion was assessed on three levels: In the current study, 88% of the prac-
titioner sample met the intra-subjective consistency criterion, indicating that they reported hav-
ing the same or a similar experience during or following meditation on multiple occasions.
Inter-subjective consistency was assessed through evaluating how many practitioners
reported each category (see Table 4 above). Each category of experience was reported by an
average of 20 practitioners, indicating that the same or a similar experience occurring in tem-
poral proximity to meditation was reported by multiple individuals. Cross-modal consistency
was assessed by comparing the phenomenology reported in practitioner interviews to the phe-
nomenology reported in expert interviews. Fifty-six of 59 (95%) categories of experience were
reported by both practitioners and experts, with an average of 20 (SD = 10.2) practitioners and
4.6 (SD = 4.3) experts reporting each category. As reported above, similarities between practi-
tioner and expert reports were not impacted by the 11 participants who provided both practi-
tioner and expert interviews.
Duration, severity and associated impairment
The vast majority (88%) of participants reported that challenging or difficult meditation experi-
ences bled over into daily life or had an impact on their life beyond a meditation retreat or
beyond a formal practice session. The term “symptoms” is used here to denote the subset of
experiences that were experienced as challenging, difficult or functionally impairing. Fig 1 shows
the duration of symptoms and their associated impairment. The median duration of symptoms
was 1–3 years, ranging from a few days to more than 10 years. While 10% reported minimal
impairment, impairment tended to mirror symptom duration, lasting from days to more than a
decade. The majority of the sample (73%) indicated moderate to severe impairment in at least
one domain, with 17% reporting suicidality, and 17% requiring inpatient hospitalization.

 meditation-related experiences and the way those experiences changed over time. Twenty-six
categories of influencing factors were clustered into 4 higher-order domains.
The average number of influencing factors reported per person was 15.1 (SD = 3.5, range
9–23) for practitioners, and 14.7 (SD = 3.3, range 8–21) for experts. Each category was
reported by an average of 35 different practitioners and 19 different experts, indicating high
consistency across both practitioners and experts.

IF domain are listed vertically in descending order of frequency (percent of practitioners
reporting) [percent of experts reporting].
Description of influencing factor domains
The following summary aims to clarify how influencing factors were defined and operationa-
lized, which was primarily data-driven from practitioner and expert interviews. This enumera-
tion of influencing factors should not be taken as a theory or hypothesis about risk factors
and remedies for meditation-related difficulties put forth by the authors; rather, it reflects the
views and experiences of the practitioners and experts who were subjects in our study. Further
analysis, as well as research in controlled conditions, is necessary in order to evaluate whether
these influencing factors are in fact correlated with a category of experience, the duration of

 challenging or difficult experiences, or the associated degree of distress or impairment. For a
comprehensive description of each category, including descriptions, inclusion criteria, and
exclusion criteria, see S5 File.
Practitioner IFs. This domain captures reported influencing factors occurring at the prac-
titioner level. The identities category refers to demographic variables such as gender, age, eth-
nicity, religion, and so forth when these were reported as having an impact on a practitioner’s
meditation experience or degree of social support received by a meditation community. Medi-
cal history, psychological history, and trauma history were reported as having an impact on the
presence of particular meditation experiences in somatic, cognitive, and affective domains, re-
spectively, as well as on the duration of meditation-related difficulties. The interaction between
meditation and pre-existing psychiatric or trauma history was a common interpretation and
causal attribution put forth by experts for certain meditation-related challenges. Personality
characteristics and temperaments were identified as being potentially either a risk factor or
a remedy, depending on the particular characteristics mentioned. Experts often explained
certain difficulties as due to the way meditation practices are thought to affect personality
structures. Similarly, certain intentions, motivations, or goals, as well as certain worldviews or
explanatory frameworks were characterized as helpful and supportive of contemplative devel-
opment, whereas others were attributed as being harmful and as intersecting with other risk
factors in the practice domain. Worldviews and explanatory frameworks were also influencing
factors in that certain interpretations of the meaning of meditation-related difficulties could
lead to further difficulties or the alleviation of certain dimensions of difficulties. Practitioners
who reported holding or being offered multiple, conflicting worldviews were particularly likely
to report on the influential—and often confusing—role of interpretive frameworks.
Practice IFs. Practice-level influencing factors pertain to how a practitioner engaged in a
particular contemplative practice. The amount, intensity, or consistency of practice was identi-
fied as a risk factor when intensive periods converged with certain practitioner-level influenc-
ing factors such as personality or other practice-level factors such as type of practice; however,
experts in particular also promoted consistency of practice as a remedy for meditation difficul-
ties expected to be transient in nature. Practice approach referred to incorrect ways of practic-
ing meditation that were characterized as risk factors as well as the use of correct methods
posited as remedies. A related category called response to experience referred to how practition-
ers either did or should respond to meditation-related changes that endure beyond the formal
practice session. Type of practice could be identified as a risk factor for particular meditation
experiences simply due to the nature of the practice, or due to a mismatch between type of
practice and practitioner dispositions. Changing type of practice or complementing one prac-
tice with another was offered as a potential remedy for the latter type of difficulties. Certain
difficulties were interpreted, especially by experts, as a necessary stage of practice, only to be
resolved by passing through the stage signified by specific meditation-related experiences or
by integrating stage-related changes into one’s experience. An assumption articulated in this
context was that subsequent stages of practice could or would resolve challenging or difficult
meditation-related experiences.
Relationship IFs. Relationships pervade the lives and contexts of practitioners, ranging
from the impact of their early life family relationships, to the quality of relationships with med-
itation teachers and communities, to the amount of social support outside of the context of
meditation. Some early life relationships were associated with practitioner-level psychiatric or
trauma history; conversely, supportive early life relationships also were described as having an
impact on personality traits. Relationships within meditation communities and especially rela-
tionships to teachers were reported as being both risk factors for difficulties when teachers and
communities were absent, unhelpful, or not sympathetic, as well as being remedies if teachers

 and communities were supportive, helpful and understanding. Experts also often commented
on the importance of healthy dynamics in the student-teacher relationship for the student’s
negotiation of meditation-related difficulties. Relationships beyond the meditation community
also had a range of impacts—from risk factor to remedy—depending on whether or not those
relationships were stable or supportive. The practice surroundings or environment, especially in
a retreat context of silence and social isolation, was commonly described as a risk factor, such
that changes in environment were necessary for alleviating certain challenges that emerged
during retreat. So too, changes from a retreat context to certain destabilizing or challenging
environments were also reported as risk factors for social and occupational difficulties in par-
ticular. Another prevalent theme was practitioners’ perceived degree of compatibility between
the worldviews, values, and goals shaped by meditation experiences and meditation teachings
and the broader sociocultural context they inhabited. When there was compatibility and fit,
sociocultural contexts could be part of a remedy. However, experts and practitioners alike also
suggested that certain sociocultural contexts could be risk factors, particularly when there was
a mismatch between a practitioner’s and a teacher’s cultural background and social customs.
Another interpretation offered was that mismatches between practitioners’ meditation experi-
ences and worldviews and values of their sociocultural contexts could create a tension that
would lead to or compounded difficulties.
Health behavior IFs. Health behaviors were generally categorized as potential risk factors
when absent or out of balance and as remedies when present or in balance. For example, lack
of sleep, inadequate diet, and lack of exercise tended to be associated with (or preceded) desta-
bilizing experiences, and could be corrected as remedies by increasing sleep amount, making
dietary changes, or getting exercise, as well as by engaging in other activities described as
grounding, calming, or embodying. Recreational drugs were sometimes cited as risk factors for
certain experiences, although prior drug-related experiences were also reported as a helpful
foundation to have for negotiating certain types of destabilizing meditation-related experi-
ences. Drug use was also occasionally reported as an attempt to alleviate meditation difficulties,
with mixed results. More commonly cited as helpful was a regimen of medication, especially
for severe meditation-related difficulties requiring other intensive treatments and hospitaliza-
tion. Other remedies included psychotherapy or medical treatment, and experts in particular
interpreted certain meditation difficulties as requiring the temporary suspension of meditation
practice in order to address them psychotherapeutically. For certain symptoms in the somatic
domain, body-based healing regimens (such as massage, acupuncture, or healing techniques
that manipulate the subtle “energy” of the body) were also attempted and reported as helpful
by some but not others.
As with phenomenology, the degree to which certain influencing factors or remedies were
appraised as helpful or harmful was highly variable and case specific. While some remedies
were enthusiastically endorsed, many of the remedies that were attempted or prescribed by
others were described by practitioners as ineffective or harmful.
Discussion
Based upon qualitative interviews of Western Buddhist practitioners and experts, the Varieties
of Contemplative Experience study developed a taxonomy of meditation-related experiences,
with a special effort to capture under-reported experiences characterized as challenging, dif-
ficult, distressing, or impairing, and which may need specific kinds of support. Thematic
content analysis yielded 59 categories of experiences across 7 domains, including cognitive,
perceptual, affective, somatic, conative, sense of self, and social. Each category was reported by
an average of 20 practitioners and 5 experts, indicating high consistency across participants.

 The valence and level of impact ranged from very positive to very negative, with the associated
level of distress and functional impairment ranging from minimal and transient to severe and
lasting. This range of experiences and impacts suggests that very few of the experiences were
universally appraised as adverse. Instead, the valence and impact of any category of experience
was dependent on a complex interaction with other influencing factors. Thus, in order to
determine what variables affect the valence and impact of a given experience, the study also
identified 26 categories of influencing factors across 4 domains, including factors related to the
practitioner, the practice, relationships, and health behaviors.
Appraisal processes and differential diagnosis
While one of the central aims of the VCE study is to understand the influence of meditation
techniques on resultant experience, querying phenomenology within the broader context of
influencing factors—some of which are sociocultural in nature—enhances our understanding
of the impact of cultural contexts and conceptual frameworks on meditation experiences, as
well as on how such experiences are appraised. Assessing the role of appraisal was built directly
into the VCE study interview protocol by asking practitioners and experts to differentiate
experiences associated with meditation from how they are interpreted, how they are believed
to be caused, and how they are to be addressed. While querying descriptive reports of experi-
ence independently from interpretations and causal attributions is not intended to “separate
an unmediated experience from a culturally determined description”[50], this approach never-
theless facilitates a better understanding of how causal attributions and ascriptions of signifi-
cance, meaning, and value are applied to experiences. It also identifies the influence that social
agents have on the appraisal of meditation-related experiences, ranging from meditation com-
munity members and especially meditation teachers to agents beyond meditation communi-
ties such as doctors and psychotherapists.
The current study not only highlights the central role of appraisal in interpreting meditation
experiences, but also that there are multiple, and sometimes conflicting, interpretative frame-
works at play for Western Buddhist meditators. The values held by meditation practitioners are
often heavily influenced by how the authorities of a Buddhist tradition—whether canonical
texts, teachers, or members of a practice community—appraise a given meditation practice or
experience. Prior conceptual frameworks acquired through philosophical or theoretical study,
communities, families, as well as the media, likely influence how those who encounter medita-
tion-related difficulties appraise such experiences. While explanatory frameworks for medi-
tation-related experiences exist within Buddhism, what is categorized as “progress” versus
“pathology” may differ across traditions, lineages, or even teachers. Furthermore, these models
may only be immediately available to practitioners working closely with a teacher or Buddhist
community. In addition, even when traditional frameworks are available, these models may be
inadequate for Western meditators who seek meditation for therapeutic reasons and who are
embedded in a scientifically-oriented culture, where biomedical and psychological frameworks
have a pervasive influence. Wildman (2011) [156] suggests that “the intense experiences of non-
religious people are sometimes difficult to assimilate for the lack of any conceptual framework
or social context for making sense of them,” a point that may extend to practitioners unfamiliar
with or uninterested in traditional conceptual frameworks or to those holding multiple, incom-
patible frameworks. That is to say, it may be the case that some of the “adverse” responses to
meditation experiences can be attributed to a lack of fit between practitioner goals and expecta-
tions and the normative frameworks of self-transformation found within the tradition. Thus,
Western Buddhist practitioners not only have to navigate multiple interpretative frameworks,
but also different opinions about which frameworks have authority.

 Similarly, recent scholarship on religion and mental health has attempted to establish com-
parisons—especially differences—between “religious experiences” and experiences associated
with psychopathology, particularly schizophrenia and psychosis [87–90]. While these studies
grapple with important issues of differential diagnosis, they tend to place an excessive empha-
sis on the role of “belief” in religious life, while overlooking the various changes in perception,
affect, cognition, embodiment, and sense of self that are also reported in the context of both
religious experiences and mental illnesses. Many of the experiences reported by practitioners
in our study resemble to varying degrees phenomena discussed in the vast literature on schizo-
phrenia, schizotypy, psychosis, as well as non-psychopathological forms of anomalous experi-
ence. Without sufficiently attending to the role of appraisal processes at both individual and
interpersonal levels, scholars may fundamentally misconstrue differential diagnosis as being
about identifying inherent differences between religious experiences and mental illnesses,
rather than seeing them as potentially more ambiguous categories or closely related phenom-
ena that may well be grounded in common cognitive, perceptual, and behavioral mechanisms.
Furthermore, an emphasis on intrinsic differences between religious experiences and psycho-
pathology obscures the social and cultural processes through which experiences are deemed
either religious or pathological [94]. Many experiences reported in the VCE study are not
unique to religious traditions and are, therefore, not intrinsically religious [157, 158]. Through
querying attributions of causality and ascriptions of meaning and value independently from
phenomenology, we attempt to situate reports of experiences in the broader narrative and cul-
tural contexts of practitioners and their communities.
Relevance to meditation-based programs and centers
The current study did not directly investigate meditation-related difficulties in mindfulness-
based interventions (MBIs). Although some practitioners in our study engaged in types of
meditation practices (e.g., visualization), in contexts (e.g., long term retreat), and with motiva-
tions (e.g., attainment of religious goals) quite different from MBIs, a number of participants
also reported challenging or difficult experiences under similar conditions as MBIs, that is: in
the context of daily practice; while meditating less than 1 hour per day, or within the first 50
hours of practice; and with an aim of health, well-being or stress-reduction. Some types of
practice associated with challenging meditation experiences were in many cases not dissimilar
from the primary components of MBIs. Many practitioners in our study reported difficulties
associated with concentration practices (focused attention-type practices such as mindfulness
of breathing), or insight practices (open monitoring-type practices), or a combination thereof
[25, 159]. Furthermore, MBI participants are encouraged to continue practicing after the
8-week program and are recommended to attend retreats at Buddhist meditation centers
[160]. However, little is known about participant trajectories beyond the 8-week program, as
most follow-ups are less than 1 year and are rarely more than 3 years [161, 162]. Given that
both MBIs and Buddhist meditation centers are based on Buddhist theory and practice [24,
25], and given that these same sources describe the possibility of periods of challenge or diffi-
culty associated with practice, it makes sense that MBI providers and meditation teachers
would be familiar with these challenges and know how to manage them.
The current study provides meditation teachers with a detailed taxonomy of potentially
challenging experiences that could assist in the identification of students who may need addi-
tional support or corrective instruction. Such early identification has been shown to improve
general and mitigate negative outcomes [163]. The study also provides a preliminary list of
remedies and management strategies, suggested by both experts and practitioners, as well as
potential influencing factors that should be further investigated in both research and practice.

 For example, research is beginning to identify practitioner-level factors, such as trauma history
[61, 164] or psychiatric conditions [165], that may influence meditation-related outcomes or
require modifications in teacher training, program structure, or inclusion and exclusion crite-
ria [166].
Limitations
The purpose of this study is to document experiences that arise in the context of Buddhist
meditation practices in Western contexts, with a deliberate effort to investigate challenging,
difficult, distressing, and functionally impairing experiences that are often under-reported. As
such, using a qualitative methodology with a sample of Western Buddhist meditators across
traditions is the best approach to be able to document the range of under-reported experiences.
While suitable for the purposes of the current study, the methods also preclude certain types of
conclusions, which are outlined below.
Non-representative sample. The study deliberately sampled meditators who had chal-
lenging meditation experiences that are often under-reported. Thus the 100% frequency of
challenging experiences is an artifact of sampling and not a reflection of the actual frequency
among Western Buddhist meditators. While valuable for gathering data on under-researched
phenomena, purposive sampling does not grant the ability to generalize any findings of the
study to other samples such as Asian Buddhist meditators or Western meditators in general. It
should be noted that the results of this study also cannot be generalized to children or youth
under the age of 18, or to mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), neither of which were
included in our sample. While our sampling was largely representative of a certain demo-
graphic of Western Buddhist meditators [167], this is only one way of characterizing practi-
tioners of Buddhism in the West [168, 169]. In particular, since our sampling did not yield a
representative number of Asian-American practitioners, study findings cannot be generalized
to Asian-American Buddhist communities, which may or may not have analogous approaches
to meditation practice and social dynamics.
The sample is also non-representative in terms of demographics and related health risks.
With 73% earning graduate or doctoral degrees, the sample represents the top 5–10% of educa-
tional attainment [170], and lower-than-average rates of mental illness and trauma exposure
[171, 172], which are known to be inversely correlated to educational attainment [173, 174].
Thus, the findings of the current study may be able to generalize to other highly educated, low-
risk samples, but not to clinical or other disadvantaged samples with high levels of mental or
physical illness or trauma exposure.
While the current practitioner sample had slightly more men than women, this gender dif-
ference is an artifact of sampling and does not reflect the relative frequency of meditation-
related difficulties across genders. Because our sampling approach is stratified by gender, this
study will be able to describe how gender interacted with different meditation experiences, but
will not be able to speak to other demographic variables such as race or sexual orientation. Fur-
ther research in these various populations is necessary to determine frequency, generalizability,
and causality of the phenomena reported in this study.
Category frequency.
Practitioners reported their meditation-related experiences based
upon open-ended questions, and were generally not prompted or directly queried to report or
discuss specific types of experiences by interviewers. As a result, the frequency of reported cat-
egories may reflect not only relative frequency within our sample but also factors related to the
participants as well as methodology. In terms of participant factors, the frequency of reported
categories is likely a function of salience and effability, which is also a function of distress and
available interpretive frameworks [175]. In other words, categories that are repeatedly reported

 may not only be frequent, but also may be the most important to participants. Conversely,
some infrequently reported experiences may not be reported because they were not considered
important or were difficult to describe. Practitioners most likely had a wider range of experi-
ences than they chose to report.
The duration between the onset of meditation-related difficulties and the time of interview
is another variable affecting both category frequency and the richness of phenomenological
descriptions. Practitioners who provided interviews immediately following or still in the midst
of meditation-related difficulties were often able to provide the most detailed accounts. Thus,
it is likely that the more temporally distant interview subjects underreported their phenome-
nology, as only the most salient features were recalled. Such interview subjects were also more
likely to have greater difficulty isolating a descriptive phenomenology from subsequent inter-
pretive frameworks. However, practitioners who had more distance from their difficulties pro-
vided more information on how they navigated, interpreted, managed, or integrated those
difficulties, and thus these subjects contributed valuable information on influencing factors
that was not always available from interview subjects still in the midst of difficulties. The
strengths and weakness of both types of interviews should be taken into account when sam-
pling further populations.
In terms of methodological factors, the coding structure and the broadness or narrowness
of the scope of a given category also affects the calculation of frequency. Some categories are
currently an amalgamation of related phenomena that will be further disambiguated in subse-
quent phases of analysis, whereas other categories (notably those in the sense of self domain)
are already delineated quite narrowly. In addition, some categories always refer only to a pri-
mary meditation-related experience, whereas others (such as fear, anger, or self-conscious
emotions) include not only primary experiences, but also secondary responses to different
primary experiences (such as fear arising due to a loss of sense of agency), as well as tertiary
responses to how meditation-related challenges played out in social and interpersonal domains
(such as shame or anger arising due to how a meditator in distress was treated by a meditation
community). Thus, the frequency of categories in the current study should be regarded as pre-
liminary and not conclusive. Future studies should use structured questionnaires to more
accurately assess category-specific frequency and causality both within and across samples.
Causality assessment.
The best study design for concluding that any experience—positive
or negative—is caused by meditation is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) that
uses a validated measure before and after learning meditation or the equal passage of time in a
matched sample. In addition, since many effects, including the ones reported in the current
study, may not occur until many years after beginning a meditation practice, a conclusive
study would also need a multi-year follow-up to produce the most accurate frequency esti-
mates. Given that such extensive study designs are rare to non-existent in the current state
of meditation research, researchers and policymakers use alternative methods. The current
study assessed meditation causality according 11 of the 13 criteria that regulatory agencies use
when making policy health decisions about possible adverse effects of medical procedures in
instances where prospective trial and epidemiological data are not available [107–110]. The
results provided causality-related evidence for all 11 criteria.
The remaining two criteria, biological gradient and the linkage to known biological mecha-
nisms, are being investigated by our group and others and will be described in more detail in
subsequent publications. Briefly, biological gradient, or that “greater exposure should lead to
greater incidence of the effect” [114, 115], is being investigated by our group by using the cur-
rent study’s codebook categories in a clinical trial of MBCT [176]. Links to biological mecha-
nisms are best investigated separately for discrete experiences or related classes of experience.
Lindahl et al. (2014) [126] provided a preliminary report on qualitative data from the VCE

28 / 38
 project and a neurobiological model of one category of perceptual changes (visual lights). We
speculate that this model (homeostatic neuroplasticity) may account for a number of other cat-
egories in other domains. In a review paper, Britton et al. (2014) [129] provided a neurobiolog-
ical model for sleep-related changes. Future papers from the VCE data set will continue to
draw from available behavioral, psychological, and neurobiological research to better under-
stand potential mechanisms of action. Similarly, other researchers have provided neurobiolog-
ical models closely related to specific categories in this study, particularly changes in sense of
self [78] and altered perceptions of space and time [77].
Finally, it is important to specify what claims can and cannot be made based upon the cau-
sality assessment results of this study. First, the results do reduce the likelihood that all of the
experiences reported were entirely unrelated to meditation, or only reflect a pre-existing con-
dition that happened to co-occur with meditation practice. Similarly, the results also challenge
other common causal attributions, such as the assumption that meditation-related difficulties
only happen to individuals with a pre-existing condition (psychiatric or trauma history), who
are on long or intensive retreats, who are poorly supervised, who are practicing incorrectly, or
who have inadequate preparation. However, this is not to say that these and other factors do
not play a role. Indeed, both experts and practitioners identified various “influencing factors”
that they thought impacted the likelihood of meditation-related challenges, their duration, and
their associated degree of distress and impairment. These data are most suggestive of an inter-
action-based model where meditation practices—on their own—may produce challenging
effects, but the specific type of effect, as well as its likelihood, duration, and associated distress
and impairment, is influenced by a number of additional factors. Finally, given that this is one
of the first studies of this scope on this topic, these results should not be interpreted as conclu-
sive; rather, they should be taken as sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.
Future directions
The current paper describes the methodology, coding structure, and basic findings of the Vari-
eties of Contemplative Experience study. Future papers will address specific aspects of both
phenomenology and influencing factors as well as their relationship to each other. When
focusing on specific categories or domains of phenomenology and/or influencing factors,
future publications will engage directly with coded interview content, and categories that cur-
rently have extensive and diverse content will be subject to further thematic content analysis
through the creation of data-driven and theory-driven subcategories. As practiced in a paper
of preliminary data on visual phenomena [126], VCE study publications also aim to generate
empirically tractable neurobiological hypotheses on the range of effects associated with medi-
tation by engaging with scientific literature on meditation in tandem with research on related
experiences from psychological and neuroscientific studies of phenomena such as depersonali-
zation disorder, trauma, or sensory deprivation, for example. The interdisciplinary approach
adopted in this study also requires attending to how such experiences are appraised and poten-
tially differentiated from similar phenomena, in both Buddhist textual sources as well as in the
reports of practitioners and experts in the study. Hypotheses generated from reports of under-
studied meditation-related phenomena can then be used to guide future research in the psy-
chology and neuroscience of meditation.
The study provides initial descriptions of experience that warrant further investigation in
both research and clinical settings. For more detailed information about the strength and
direction of influence, the field needs well-controlled longitudinal studies on meditators
employing a questionnaire assessing meditation-related experiences. The taxonomy of medita-
tion-related experiences developed through the current study forms the foundation for such a

 questionnaire. An instrument based upon the phenomenology codebook has been pilot tested
in a randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy [176] and is under-
going revision for wide-scale dissemination in future meditation research studies.
Three studies that follow the VCE study methodology are also currently underway. One
study is a sample of practitioners and teachers from Jewish, Christian, and Sufi traditions (PI:
NF). Comparisons between the core VCE data set of Buddhist practitioners and the practition-
ers from Abrahamic traditions will facilitate an understanding of which types of experiences
may be unique to a particular practice tradition, as well as which experiences are reported in
common, despite differences in contemplative practices. It will also illuminate the importance
of worldviews and conceptual frameworks in the interpretation of experiences that are com-
mon to both data sets. A second study of European Buddhist meditators is also underway.
Comparisons between this study and our data set, which is largely comprised of American
practitioners, has the potential to enhance our understanding of the influence of sociocultural
context, isolating variables that might be unique to American and European contexts, respec-
tively. Similarly, a third study will compare meditation practitioners and experts in the United
States with practitioners and experts of the same tradition in India in order to assess the influ-
ence of cultural contexts on phenomenology and appraisals.
Finally, the study also aims to provide resources and practical methods to facilitate the
integration of difficult experiences that meditation practitioners report as being initially
unexpected or challenging. Future papers will investigate particularly distressing and func-
tionally impairing symptoms along with an assessment of potential risk factors and possible
remedies. Subsequent analyses will also examine the convergences as well as the discrepan-
cies between practitioners’ experiences and experts’ awareness of and management of those
experiences. We have partnered with a number of meditation centers in the US and Europe
and are offering educational materials and trainings as part of their meditation teacher-train-
ing programs. These resources could be of benefit not only to practitioners and meditation
instructors, but also to the burgeoning application of meditation techniques in psychology
and medicine.
