IMPORTANCE Depression is common in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
and may confer a higher likelihood of progression to dementia. Prevalence estimates of
depression in those with MCI are required to guide both clinical decisions and public health
policy, but published results are variable and lack precision.
OBJECTIVE To provide a precise estimate of the prevalence of depression in individuals with
MCI and identify reasons for heterogeneity in the reported results.
DATA SOURCES A search of literature from database inception to March 2016 was performed
using Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO. Hand searching of all included articles was performed,
including a Google Scholar search of citations of included articles.
STUDY SELECTION Articles were included if they (1) were published in English, (2) reported
patients with MCI as a primary study group, (3) reported depression or depressive symptoms
using a validated instrument, and (4) reported the prevalence of depression in patients
with MCI.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS All abstracts, full-text articles, and other sources were
reviewed, with data extracted in duplicate. The overall prevalence of depression in patients
with MCI was pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored using
stratification and random-effects meta-regression.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The prevalence of depression in patients with MCI,
reported as a percentage with 95% CIs. Estimates were also stratified by population source
(community-based or clinic-based sample), method of depression diagnosis
(clinician-administered, informant-based, or self-report), and method of MCI diagnosis
(cognitive vs global measure and amnestic vs nonamnestic).
RESULTS Of 5687 unique abstracts, 255 were selected for full-text review, and 57 studies,
representing 20 892 patients, met all inclusion criteria. The overall pooled prevalence of
depression in patients with MCI was 32% (95% CI, 27-37), with significant heterogeneity
between estimates (I2 = 90.7%). When stratified by source, the prevalence of depression in
patients with MCI in community-based samples was 25% (95% CI, 19-30) and was 40% (95%
CI, 32-48) in clinic-based samples, which was significantly different (P < .001). The method
used to diagnose depression did not significantly influence the prevalence estimate, nor did
the criteria used for MCI diagnosis or MCI subtype.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of depression in patients with MCI is high.
A contributor to heterogeneity in the reported literature is the source of the sample, with
greater depression burden prevalent in clinic-based samples.

epression commonly occurs in association with mild
cognitiveimpairment(MCI).1-3IndividualswithMCIand
depressionperformmorepoorlyonimmediateandde-
layedmemorytaskscomparedwithnondepressedpatientswith
MCI.4 Further, evidence suggests that depression confers a
higher rate of progression along the neurodegenerative spec-
trum from MCI to dementia; a systematic review and
meta-analysis5of18studiesdeterminedthepooledrelativerisk
of progressing to dementia was 1.28 (P = .003) in the group of
patients with MCI with depressive symptoms compared with
the those with MCI with no depressive symptoms. Even sub-
syndromal symptoms of depression have been identified as a
significant factor associated with poorer function and quality
of life in patients with MCI as well as a higher progression rate
to dementia.6-8 Thus, appropriate screening strategies for de-
pression and depressive symptoms are paramount in identify-
ingwhatisasignificantriskfactorforcognitive,functional,and
behavioral outcomes in those who are cognitively impaired.
However, depression is a heterogeneous disease with no
clear biomarker or gold standard for diagnosis. Rather, a de-
pressive syndrome is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms,
and rating scales are used to assess and screen for depres-
sion. Further, evidence suggests depression is a difficult di-
agnosis in those with neurocognitive disorders, and depres-
sion in older adults has a cognitive profile that may or may not
meet threshold criteria for MCI.9 Because MCI and depres-
sion can have overlapping symptoms, disentangling and dif-
ferentiating between them can be problematic. Both depres-
sion and MCI tend to be underrecognized in clinical settings.
However,inappropriateordelayedtreatmentofdepressionhas
negative repercussions for functioning, quality of life, gen-
eral health status, and the clinical course.10,11
DespitetheimportanceofthisassociationbetweenMCIand
depression, to our knowledge, no consensus has emerged
aroundcertainfoundationalelementsofknowledgeinthisarea.
Among these is the question of prevalence. Many studies ex-
amining depression prevalence in patients with MCI have been
conducted, but the results have been inconsistent.12-15 This
knowledge gap is an impediment to policy and practice. For ex-
ample, the success of screening programs is sensitive to the
prevalent base rate. Given that inconsistencies are prominent
in the current literature, a systematic review and meta-
analysiswillbeusefulindeterminingthebestestimateofpreva-
lence currently available and clarifying the reasons for differ-
ences in estimates.
Methods
Search Strategy
UsinganaprioriprotocolthatwasregisteredwithPROSPERO,16
we conducted our systematic review according to both
MOOSE17andPRISMA18standards.Thesearchstrategywasde-
veloped in consultation with a research librarian and experts
in both MCI (Z.I.) and depression (S.B.P.). Three electronic da-
tabases (ie, Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO) were searched
from inception to March 2016 with no restriction on the year
of the study. Medical Subject Headings and keywords related
to depression or depressive symptoms, MCI, and prevalence
were used (eAppendix in the Supplement). The reference lists
of all included full-text articles were searched to identify any
studies missed in the initial search, and Google Scholar was
used to find academic articles citing eligible articles. Content-
area experts on the author team were canvassed to deter-
mine if any relevant studies were missing and to provide in-
formation on ongoing or unpublished studies. References that
consisted of abstracts alone were not considered. References
were compiled and managed using Endnote X7 (Thomson Re-
uters), with duplicates removed using this software.
Study Selection
Ninereviewersscreenedtitlesandabstracts,eachofwhichwas
reviewed independently by 2 individuals. At this stage, the cri-
teria were purposely broad to allow inclusion of any relevant
studies. To be included, studies had to be published in English
andreportoriginalresearchusinganyobservationaldesign(eg,
cross-sectional or cohort) that reported on depression in pa-
tients with MCI. Case reports and series were excluded.
The full text of any study selected by either of the 2 review-
ers was reviewed. These were done in duplicate. Articles were
included if they (1) were published in English, (2) reported pa-
tients with MCI as a primary study group, (3) reported depres-
sionordepressivesymptomsusingavalidatedinstrument,and
(4) reported the prevalence of depression in patients with MCI.
ArticlesreportingpatientswithdepressionvspatientswithMCI
as the primary study population (ie, prevalence of MCI in de-
pression) were excluded. Studies using only the Mini–Mental
State Examination to diagnose MCI were also excluded be-
cause of the lack of sensitivity of this instrument for MCI.19 All
studies meeting inclusion criteria at this stage were reviewed
(by Z.I. or K.F.) to ensure appropriateness for inclusion in the
final analysis. Disagreements of eligibility were reconciled by
the original reviewers and, if required, a third reviewer (Z.I. or
K.F.). An additional reviewer (Z.I. or K.F.) examined any stud-
iesthatusedthesamesampleofdata.Studiesprovidingthemost
detailed information were included, and the others were kept
for reference.

Question What is the prevalence of depression in patients with
mild cognitive impairment?
Findings In this meta-analysis, of 57 studies that reported on the
prevalence of depression in a population with mild cognitive
impairment, representing 20 892 participants, the overall
prevalence of depression was 32%. There were differences in
prevalence estimates between community samples (25%) and
clinical samples (40%).
Meaning Depression is common in those with mild cognitive
impairments.

sample of articles to ensure all relevant study-related vari-
ables were captured. Two independent reviewers abstracted
data on each included study. The following data were ab-
stracted:studyinformation(ie,author,journal,andyear),study
characteristics (ie, mean age of participants, location, and du-
ration of data collection), condition information (ie, data
sources, condition definition, and total number of partici-
pants), and the prevalence of depression in patients with MCI
or the information necessary to calculate an estimate.
Study quality was assessed using the quality assessment
tool for observational studies from the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute (eTable 1 in the Supplement).20 The tool
contains 14 criteria on which quality is determined, including
whether the study population was clearly specified and de-
fined, whether outcome assessors were blind, and an evalu-
ation of the participation rate. The criteria were rated as either
yes, no, or “other” (ie, cannot determine, not reported, or not
applicable), and an overall rating for the study as “good,
” “fair,
”
or“poor”wasprovided.Wedidnotevaluateitem14ofthescale
(“Were key potential confounding variables measured and ad-
justed statistically for their impact on the relationship be-
tween exposure[s] and outcome[s]?”), as the goal of this study
was to determine prevalence estimates. For item 10 (“Was the
exposure[s] assessed more than once over time?”), the re-
sponse was recorded as yes in cohort studies only if multiple
measurements of the exposure (in this case, depression) were
used. That is, if only the baseline exposure assessment was
used, it was marked as no, regardless of the number of fol-
low-up measurements. For cross-sectional studies, items 7
(“Was the timeframe sufficient so that one could reasonably
expect to see an association between exposure and outcome
ifitexisted?”)and13(“Waslosstofollow-upafterbaseline20%
or less?”) were recorded as not applicable.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
A random-effects model was used because of assumed hetero-
geneitybetweenthestudies.ThemetaproppackageinStata14.0
(StataCorp) was used to produce the pooled estimates, forest
plots, and meta-regression. The meta-analysis of proportions
uses the binomial distribution to model the within-study vari-
ability or by allowing Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transfor-
mation to stabilize the variances.21 Heterogeneity was quanti-
fied using the I2 statistic, and its significance was determined
basedontheaccompanyingCochranQtestPvalue.22AnI2value
of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, and increasing val-
uesrepresentgreateramountsofheterogeneity;valuesof25%,
50%,and75%indicatelow,moderate,andhighlevelsofhetero-
geneity, respectively.22 τ2 Values arising from the random-
effects models were also used to quantify heterogeneity.
The effects of study population source (community-
based or clinic-based), method of depression diagnosis (infor-
mant-rated, self-report, or clinician-administered), method of
MCI diagnosis (cognitive or global criteria), and subtype of MCI
(amnestic or nonamnestic) on the prevalence of depression in
patients with MCI were assessed using random-effects meta-
regression. Community samples were from nonclinical, popu-
lation-basedepidemiologicalstudies,andclinic-basedsamples
included participants in clinical care at academic research in-
stitutions. Informant-rated scales were those completed by a
family member or other informant with adequate knowledge
of the participant. If studies used multiple cut points to score
the depression tools, then the least restrictive cut point was
selected. The metabias command assessed publication bias
usingbothBeggandEggertests.Descriptivestatisticswerecal-
culated using proportions and means and compared using
t tests where appropriate. For all tests, P < .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.

Depression or Depressive Symptoms in Patients With MCI
The overall pooled prevalence of depression or depressive
symptoms in patients with MCI was 32% (95% CI, 27-37) with
significant heterogeneity present (I2 = 90.7%; Q P < .001;
τ2 = 0.013).
Sources of Heterogeneity
Sample Source
When stratified by the source of the sample, the prevalence
of depression in patients with MCI from the 28 community-
based samples was significantly lower than patients from the
29 studies reporting on clinic-based samples (25%; 95% CI,
19-30; vs 40%; 95% CI, 32-48; P < .001) (Figure 2). Significant
heterogeneity existed within the estimates for community-
based samples (I2 = 82.1%; Q P < .001; τ2 = 0.0065) and
clinic-based samples (I2 = 93.3%; Q P < .001; τ2 = 0.0.013). In
community studies, estimates ranged from 11% to 63%. In
clinic-based samples, estimates ranged from 20% to 79%.
Method of Depression Diagnosis
There was no difference in the prevalence of depression in pa-
tients with MCI based on how depression was diagnosed
(P = .80). Prevalence estimates from 24 informant-rated (31%;
95% CI, 24-38), 18 self-reported (32%; 95% CI, 23-43), and 15
clinician-administered(35%;95%CI,25-45)sourcesweresimi-
lar. Significant heterogeneity between estimates in each strata
were noted (P < .001; τ2 = 0.014).
Method of MCI Diagnosis
When stratified by whether MCI diagnosis was based on cog-
nitive criteria38-40 or a global measure (ie, CDR),42 there was
no difference in the estimates of depression prevalence
(P = .89). The 6 studies using the CDR had a very slightly lower
prevalence (31%; 95% CI, 16-49) than the 51 studies using cog-
nitive criteria (32%; 95% CI, 27-38), with significant heteroge-
neity present within both strata (P < .001; τ2 = 0.013). Stud-
ies using the Petersen criteria37,38 or Winblad criteria40 to
diagnose MCI had a slightly higher prevalence than those that
did not (33%; 95% CI, 27-37; vs 30%; 95% CI, 20-40; P = .60).
The prevalence of depression was highest in studies using
the Winblad criteria40 (36%; 95% CI, 22-52), followed by CIND
(32%; 95% CI, 20-46), Petersen criteria37,38 (32%; 95% CI, 26-
39), and CDR (29%; 95% CI, 12-50) and was lowest in studies
usingonlystandardizedneuropsychologicaltesting(24%;95%
CI, 16-33) to diagnose MCI (P = .53).
MCI Subtype
The subtype of MCI was reported by 15 studies; all 15 studies
reported amnestic subtype, and of these, 8 studies reported
depression prevalence for patients with the nonamnestic sub-
type as well. The prevalence of depression was higher in pa-
tients with amnestic MCI (34%; 95% CI, 25-42; I2 = 76.1%; Q
P < .001; τ2 = 0.07) than patients with nonamnestic MCI (26%;
95% CI, 14-40; I2 = 83.0%; Q P < .001; τ2 = 0.13), although this
difference was not significant (P = .30).
Other Demographic Variables
In the 43 studies reporting on the mean age of participants
(range, 53.2 to 88.5 years), study mean age was not signifi-
cantly associated with the prevalence of depression in pa-
tients with MCI (P = .19). Because there was only 1 study con-
ducted in Africa and 1 from South America, a meta-analysis
including these continents was not possible. Among the re-
maining continents, the prevalence of depression in patients
with MCI was significantly lower in the 2 studies from Aus-
tralia (13%; 95% CI, 4-25) compared with the 22 from Europe
(37%; 95% CI, 29-46; P < .001) and the 23 from North America
(30%; 95% CI, 23-38; P = .03).
Publication Bias
Publicationbiasintheprevalenceofdepressioninpatientswith
MCI was not detected using the Begg test (P = .91) or Egger test
(P = .08).
Study Quality
Most studies (48 [84.2%]) had an overall rating of fair quality,
while 4 (7.0%) studies were rated as good and 5 (8.8%) as poor
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). The most frequently met qual-
ity criteria were item 1 (“Was the research question or objec-
tive in this paper clearly stated”; reported by all studies) and
item 2 (“Was the study population clearly specified and de-
fined”; reported by 96.5% [55 of 57] of studies). A number of
items were rarely reported, including item 5 (“Was a sample
size justification, power description, or variance and effect es-
timates provided”; reported by 3.5% [2 of 57] studies) and item
12 (“Were the outcome assessors blinded to the exposure sta-
tus of participants”; reported by none of the studies).
Discussion
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to de-
termine the best estimate of prevalence of depression in pa-
tients with MCI. The overall pooled prevalence of depression
was 32%, which is comparable with previous studies on pa-
tients with MCI12-15 and on patients with dementia.94,95 A re-
cent systematic review and meta-analysis95 on the preva-
lence of depression in patients with Alzheimer disease found
significant heterogeneity in estimates (5%-48%) based on pa-
tientsampling,dementiaseverity,anddiagnosticcriteriaused.
Similarly, a meta-analysis94 of depression prevalence in pa-
tients with frontotemporal lobar dementia determined an om-

impairment than in the dementia population by definition, de-
pression prevalence is comparable, as is the heterogeneity in
prevalence estimates (I2 = 90.8%). We explored 3 sources of
heterogeneity identified a priori: population source, method
of depression diagnosis, and method of MCI classification.
When stratified by source, the prevalence of depression in pa-
tients with MCI was significantly different, with 25% in com-
munity-based samples and 42% in clinic-based samples. The
method used to diagnose depression did not significantly in-
fluence the prevalence estimate, nor did the criteria used for
MCI diagnosis.
While the prevalence of depression in patients with MCI
was high in both community and clinical samples, there was
higher prevalence in the clinical population. Stratification by
referral source reconciled a small degree of heterogeneity
within samples, but significant heterogeneity remained. This
finding is consistent with previous smaller systematic re-
views on the topic13,15 and intuitively makes sense. In gen-
eral, one can speculate that people with depression are more
likely to present to clinicians for help compared with nonde-
pressed people, notwithstanding the fact that depression can
go diagnosed and untreated. Whether or not there is an inter-
action or cumulative effect of depression in patients with MCI
on rates of presentation for clinical care is speculative at this
point and requires further study. Evidence suggests that de-
pression confers a higher rate of progression along the neuro-
degenerative spectrum from MCI to dementia.5,96,97 The con-
struct mild behavioral impairment8 describes the relationship
betweenneuropsychiatricsymptomsandthisprogression.De-
pression is a prominent subdomain in the mild behavioral im-
pairment construct (in addition to apathy, impulsivity/
aggression, social cognition, and psychosis), reflecting the
effect of depression on cognitive and functional outcomes in
patients with MCI.8 With this in mind, if depression reflects
underlying dementia pathology in some people with MCI, it
may be a reflection of underlying dementia burden and in-
crease the likelihood of people being in clinical care as op-
posed to having MCI in the community without clinical sup-
port.Again,furtherstudiesarerequiredtoexplorethisfinding.
Second, we found that prevalence based on informant-
rated scales was not significantly different from self-
reported prevalence or prevalence based on clinician-
administered scales, with significant heterogeneity between
strata.Aprevioussystematicreviewandmeta-analysis98ofde-
pression in patients with epilepsy, completed by members of
this group, determined increased odds of depression in people
with epilepsy with substantial heterogeneity between esti-
mates, driven largely by the method of depression diagnosis.
However, studies have attempted to determine the best tools
for diagnosing depression in people with dementia, but these
have generally found poor correlation between rating scales,99
low sensitivity,100 or decreased scale performance with greater
cognitive impairment,101,102 in part because of several misfit
itemsinpeoplewhoarecognitivelyimpaired.103Thus,ourfind-
ingsaremoreconsistentwithdementiathanepilepsy.Mildcog-
nitive impairment is a heterogeneous syndrome, diagnosed
based primarily on cognitive testing without clear explora-
tion of underlying etiology. For example, cognitive impair-
ment due to anticholinergic medication burden, cerebrovas-
cular disease, or preclinical dementia (eg, Alzheimer disease,
Lewy body dementia, or frontotemporal dementia) can all fall
under the MCI umbrella but represent a great heterogeneity
of etiologies, which may manifest in different proportions in
different patient samples. Mild cognitive impairment itself can
be divided into amnestic and nonamnestic and single-
domain and multi domain subtypes, which may reflect differ-
entetiologiesorpathophysiologies.40InpeoplewithMCI,there
may be heterogeneity in underlying depression etiology (ie,
idiopathic depressive symptoms vs depression secondary to
neurodegenerative/vascular burden vs depression as a re-
sponse to cognitive decline).3
Nonetheless, despite within-sample heterogeneity, preva-
lenceestimateswereremarkablysimilarirrespectiveofmethod
of diagnosis. This speaks to the challenges in a defining de-
pressive syndrome and determining if the classic definition of
depression is different in neurology patients as well as be-
tween different neurological illnesses (ie, epilepsy vs MCI vs
dementia). While stratification of depression ascertainment
methods did not reconcile heterogeneity in prevalence esti-
mates, this does not mean that all depression screening and
diagnostic instruments are equal. Until there are methodologi-
cal guidelines and consensus on the best tool to screen for de-
pression and diagnose MCI, these are the most comprehen-
siveavailabledata.Agemaycontributetodiagnosticchallenges
in older adults because of phase-of-life issues, comorbid ill-
ness burden, loss of friends and social isolation, and pain and
other somatic symptoms making diagnosis more
challenging.104,105 However, in our analysis, study mean age
was not significantly associated with the prevalence of de-
pression in those with MCI. It is possible that the cognitive im-
pairment itself affects the performance of the rating scales and
their ability to detect depression reliably or that clinicians mis-
attribute other aspects of neurodegenerative disease to de-
pression. It has been shown that in neurodegenerative dis-
ease,ratingscalesthatcaptureagitationandpsychosiscanhave
different sensitivities, specificities, and optimum cut points,
despite being ostensibly similar.106 It may be similar with de-
pression, and interscale differences may be amplified in this
patient population. Further research is warranted, specifi-
cally in those with MCI.
The third source of explored heterogeneity was method
of MCI diagnosis. Mild cognitive impairment is a predementia
syndrome or at-risk state, which is generally defined by cogni-
tive decline but maintenance of function (thus precluding a
dementia diagnosis). The diagnosis of MCI has evolved over
time, and while there is growing demand for unified MCI
diagnostic criteria, there is no clear consensus.107,108 The
commonly used criteria in research have included the
Petersen or Mayo criteria,37,38 CIND,39 and Winblad or Interna-
tional Working Group criteria,40 which adhere to the afore-
mentioned definition.
One of the major areas of inconsistency in MCI diagnosis
has been in the measurement of cognitive impairment, with
differences from normed scores of both 1 SD and 1.5 SD
deemed acceptable.41 For this study, we used more stringent
criteria of cognitive impairment 1.5 SD below the norms and

also excluded any studies that diagnosed MCI solely based on
Mini–Mental State Examination, given the biases of language,
education, and culture on Mini–Mental State Examination
scores.109 Thus, our sample is slightly more homogenous but
may be skewed to the more cognitively impaired individuals.
Early iterations of MCI criteria focused on amnestic deficits,
but subsequent MCI criteria (eg, Winblad/International Work-
ing Group40) also include a search for nonamnestic deficits as
important and relevant. When stratified by amnestic vs non-
amnestic MCI, there was no difference in depression preva-
lence, again suggesting that MCI criteria are more similar than
different when it comes to depressive symptoms. Developed
in advance of the MCI construct, the CDR is a severity scale
used in dementia research and ranges from no dementia
(CDR = 0) to increasing stages of dementia (CDR = 1-3).42 A
CDR score of 0.5 has been considered to be a functional
equivalent of MCI in clinical trials. A sample of individuals
with a CDR score of 0.5 may include not only people with MCI
but also people with very early Alzheimer disease, and in fact
a CDR of 0.5 was defined as “questionable dementia.
”38 While
a global CDR of 0.5 per se is not the best criterion for a diagno-
sis of MCI, in clinical practice (and for a number of research
studies), the CDR score is often used to at least support if not
make a diagnosis of MCI. We felt it was important to examine
its potential effect on our results. However, in our sample, the
prevalence of depression was not significantly different in
CDR-diagnosed MCI vs cognitive criteria alone, suggesting
CDR may capture a comparable population with other MCI
criteria. In sum, despite differences in operationalizing MCI in
the context of the studies cited, estimates did not differ sig-
nificantly based on MCI criteria.
Limitations
There are a number of strengths of this study but also some
limitations. First, to our knowledge, this is the largest system-
atic review and meta-analysis of depression in people with
MCI. Results included 57 studies (28 from community
samples and 29 from clinical samples), representing 20 892
participants from 22 countries and 6 continents. Although
based on only 2 studies, the prevalence of depression in
people with MCI was lower in Australian studies compared
with 22 from Europe and 23 from North America. The signifi-
cance of this finding is unknown, and further studies are
required in all the remaining continents. Second, the study
methods have been successfully used by this team before and
have proven to be rigorous.98 These methods included dupli-
cate reviews at every stage, including abstract and full-text
reviews as well as study quality assessments. The large num-
ber of included studies is a strength of the analysis; however,
this is potentially a limitation as well. While the broad spec-
trum of included studies likely contributed to heterogeneity,
the inclusion of only validated rating scales may have miti-
gated this somewhat. While sex proportions were reported in
overall samples, sex-specific prevalence estimates were gen-
erally not reported. As this is a study-level meta-analysis, a
limitation of the methods is that individual-level characteris-
tics cannot be explored. Future studies could explore this via
a pooled or individual-level meta-analysis. Another limitation
of the study is the inclusion of English-language studies only,
as we may have missed some studies. However, given the
large number of included studies, we would not expect
missed studies to significantly affect the findings.
Conclusions
Depression is common in people with MCI, with an overall
pooled prevalence of 32%. A contributor to heterogeneity in
the reported literature regarding the prevalence of depres-
sion in those with MCI is the source of the sample, with greater
depressionburdenprevalentinclinicalsamplescomparedwith
communitysamples.Othersourcesofheterogeneityhavebeen
explored, but more research on depression in people with MCI
is required.
