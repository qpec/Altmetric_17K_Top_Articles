Abstract
Background
Self-monitoring of blood glucose among people with type 2 diabetes not treated with insulin
does not appear to be effective in improving glycemic control. We investigated whether
health professional review of telemetrically transmitted self-monitored glucose results in
improved glycemic control in people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.
Methods and Findings
We performed a randomized, parallel, investigator-blind controlled trial with centralized ran-
domization in family practices in four regions of the United Kingdom among 321 people with
type 2 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >58 mmol/mol. The supported telemonitor-
ing intervention involved self-measurement and transmission to a secure website of twice-
weekly morning and evening glucose for review by family practice clinicians who were not
blinded to allocation group. The control group received usual care, with at least annual review
and more frequent reviews for people with poor glycemic or blood pressure control. HbA1c
assessed at 9 mo was the primary outcome. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. 160
people were randomized to the intervention group and 161 to the usual care group between
June 6, 2011, and July 19, 2013. HbA1c data at follow-up were available for 146 people in the
intervention group and 139 people in the control group. The mean (SD) HbA1c at follow-up
was 63.0 (15.5) mmol/mol in the intervention group and 67.8 (14.7) mmol/mol in the usual
care group. For primary analysis, adjusted mean HbA1c was 5.60 mmol/mol / 0.51% lower
(95% CI 2.38 to 8.81 mmol/mol/ 95% CI 0.22% to 0.81%, p = 0�0007). For secondary analy-
ses, adjusted mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 3.06 mmHg lower (95% CI 0.56–

(95% CI 0.62–3.72, p = 0.006) among people in the intervention group when compared with
usual care after adjustment for baseline differences and minimization strata. No significant dif-
ferences were identified between groups in weight, treatment pattern, adherence to medica-
tion, or quality of life in secondary analyses. There were few adverse events and these were
equally distributed between the intervention and control groups. In secondary analysis, there
was a greater number of telephone calls between practice nurses and patients in the interven-
tion compared with control group (rate ratio 7.50 (95% CI 4.45–12.65, p < 0.0001) but no
other significant differences between groups in use of health services were identified between
groups. Key limitations include potential lack of representativeness of trial participants, inabil-
ity to blind participants and health professionals, and uncertainty about the mechanism, the
duration of the effect, and the optimal length of the intervention.

Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Type 2 diabetes is a common condition for which self-management is very important.
• Telemonitoring is a system in which people with different conditions take measurements
at home. The measurements are automatically shared with their doctor or nurse, who
can give advice or change treatment.
• Self-monitoring of blood sugar levels by itself does not appear to be a good way of
improving control of diabetes, and it is not known whether sharing blood sugar results
with health professionals using telemonitoring improves diabetes control.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We carried out a “randomized controlled trial” in which 321 people with type 2 diabetes,
recruited from general practices across the United Kingdom, were split into two groups
and studied over 9 mo.
• One group was looked after in the usual way. People in the telemonitoring group were
asked to send measurements of their blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight from
devices they were given. We asked practice nurses to check the results on the website at
least once a week and to contact the patients by telephone or email to adjust treatment
or reinforce lifestyle advice if necessary.

 • We found that the people in the telemonitoring group had significantly better control of
diabetes and blood pressure than the people who had treatment as usual.
• Telemonitoring made no significant difference in patients’ weight.
What Do these Findings Mean?
• The study shows that telemonitoring can be effectively applied in people with type 2 dia-
betes in a research setting.
• Further work is required to identify whether telemonitoring is helpful in normal health
care, which people find it most useful, and how long it should be used for.
Introduction
The International Diabetes Federation has estimated that the number of people with diagnosed
diabetes in the world in 2013 was 206 million [1]. Annual health care costs of a patient with
type 2 diabetes are approximately two to three times higher than the costs of a person of similar
age and sex without diabetes, and approximately 80% of the cost of diabetes to health services
in developed countries is spent on complications. Control of blood glucose and blood pressure
and management of dyslipidemia reduces complications and mortality among people with dia-
betes [2,3]. The increasing prevalence of diabetes and other chronic conditions means that tra-
ditional models of management in family practice are under extreme pressure and there is
considerable interest in developing effective approaches to self-management across the world.
The traditional clinician-led model with regular face-to-face consultations for managing
diabetes and hypertension is costly in terms of health care professionals’ time, rarely supports
self-management by patients, and is often not very effective, partly because therapeutic inertia
may result in reluctance to change treatments [4]. Systematic reviews indicate that engaging
patients in self-monitoring and management can improve clinical outcomes in some chronic
disorders (for example, asthma), but the evidence that self-monitoring of blood glucose is bene-
ficial in people with type 2 diabetes is less clear [5,6]. This may be due to therapeutic inertia,
poor adherence to both lifestyle advice and prescribed medication among people with diabetes
[7,8], and the fact that patients become anxious when faced with self-monitored evidence of
poor control when feedback from clinicians is infrequent [9].
The aim of the Telescot Diabetes Trial was to investigate the effect of supervised, self-moni-
toring of glycemic control, blood pressure, and weight with telemetric transmission of mea-
surements (hereafter described as supported telemonitoring) among people with poorly
controlled diabetes compared with a control group receiving usual care. The trial was per-
formed within a program of similar trials in patients with chronic conditions described further
at www.telescot.org and included a previous hypertension trial [10].
Methods
Study Design
We performed a randomized, parallel, investigator-blind, controlled trial in family practices in
four regions of the United Kingdom (UK). The South-East Scotland Research Ethics

 Committee (reference number: 10/S1102160) approved the study, which was overseen by an
Independent Trial Steering Committee. All participants provided written informed consent.
The protocol provides details of the design and methods and is available as S1 Text and in the
published version [11].
Participants
We recruited family practices caring for socially diverse populations from Borders, Glasgow,
and Lothian in Scotland and Kent in England through primary care research networks. Partici-
pating practices searched their registers of people with type 2 diabetes (assisted as necessary by
researchers from Primary Care Research Networks) to identify and send an information sheet
and letter inviting potential participants to respond to the research team if they were interested
in participating in the trial.
Volunteers attended a screening visit at which the intervention and trial was explained, writ-
ten informed consent was obtained, a blood sample for HbA1c and lipid measurement was col-
lected and daytime ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was initiated. Inclusion
criteria were the following: diagnosis of type 2 diabetes managed in family practice, age over 17
years, availability of a mobile telephone signal at home, and poor glycemic control, defined as
HbA1c >58 mmol/mol. The original protocol included an inclusion criterion of poorly con-
trolled blood pressure (based on average daytime self-monitored blood pressure �130 mmHg),
but this criterion was removed and the protocol [11] amended in the first month of recruit-
ment because the majority of potential participants had well-controlled blood pressure. After
15 months of recruitment the initial upper age limit was removed and we clarified that exclu-
sion on the basis of surgery within the last 3 mo implied major surgery and that treated atrial
fibrillation was not an exclusion criterion. The protocol changes mean that trial participants
are more representative of the population with type 2 diabetes with poor glycemic control than
if the inclusion requirements for poor blood pressure control and maximum age had remained.
Exclusion criteria were blood pressure >210/135 mmHg, hypertension or renal disease
managed in secondary care, treatment for a cardiac event or other life-threatening illness
within the previous 6 mo, major surgery within the last 3 mo, atrial fibrillation unless success-
fully treated or cardioverted, inability to use self-monitoring equipment, and pregnancy.
Randomization and Masking
People meeting the eligibility criteria were randomized at a second visit using an allocated
treatment code generated by a computer from a minimization procedure based on age (<70 or
�70 years of age), sex, geographic area, prescription of two or more diabetes treatments, pre-
scription of three or more anti-hypertensive medications, and whether they had previously
monitored their blood sugars, as well as a 1:1 ratio for intervention to control group. Minimiza-
tion was used to ensure that important baseline variables were balanced between intervention
and control groups. To ensure unpredictability of the minimization procedure, there was a 1 in
10 chance that the determined treatment allocation was reversed; the corresponding random
numbers list was stored securely at the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit and concealed from par-
ticipants and research nurses. Random allocations were obtained by research nurses who
enrolled participants through a secure web-based system prepared and maintained by the
Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit.
It was not possible to blind participants, clinicians, or research nurses to allocation group
for all participants. In Lothian and Borders a different research nurse collected data at baseline
and follow-up, although this was not possible for participants in Kent and Glasgow. The pri-
mary and principal secondary outcomes were based on objective measurements derived from

 collection of blood samples, ABPM, and weight measurement by research nurses such that lack
of blinding is unlikely to introduce measurement bias. In addition, participants were asked not
to reveal allocation until after final data collection was complete.
Procedures
Research nurses undertook baseline measurements prior to randomization in all participants.
Baseline measurements included HbA1c, the average daytime blood pressure (BP) from ABPM
based on a minimum of 12 measurements recorded every 20 min between 7 A.M. and 11 P.M.,
average of second and third measurements of office BP measured by research nurses, smoking
history, height and weight, exhaled carbon monoxide, questionnaire data on anxiety/depres-
sion (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) [12], quality of life (EQ-5D) [13], self-efficacy
[14], medication adherence [15], physical activity [16], knowledge of managing diabetes (based
on responses from the first 14 items of the diabetes knowledge test) [17], and ethnic group
based on categories included in the 2011 UK Census.
A full description of the intervention is provided in S3 Text. In brief, participants in the
intervention group were given instructions for use of blood pressure, blood glucose, and weight
monitors, that used Bluetooth technology to transmit readings via a supplied modem to a
remote secure server by research nurses. The participant and their family practice professionals
were able to access password-protected records on the server. Participants were asked to mea-
sure one fasting and one nonfasting blood glucose at least twice weekly and measure BP and
weight at least weekly (with increased testing as recommended by the clinician for people
treated with insulin). Participants were given advice on lifestyle modification, on lag time for
effects of lifestyle and medication change on glucose and blood pressure, and when and how to
contact their family practice team via research nurses. Primary care nurses were asked to check
participants’ results weekly and to organize treatment changes based on national guidelines for
diabetes and hypertension management (see protocol and S4 Text) [11]. The intervention
lasted 9 mo, when patients were asked to attend for follow-up. The comparison group received
usual care. Usual diabetes care in family practice is financially incentivized in the UK with tar-
gets set on a sliding scale of rewards for glycemic and blood pressure control (see [18] for more
detail). Well-controlled patients are reviewed at least once a year, but more frequent reviews
are performed for people who have poor glycemic or blood pressure control.
Outcomes
The follow-up appointment included similar measurements and questionnaires to those per-
formed at baseline. The primary outcome was adjusted mean difference in HbA1c, and second-
ary outcomes were adjusted mean differences in daytime ambulatory systolic and diastolic
blood pressures and weight between treatment groups (see statistical analysis for further details
of adjustments). HbA1c (that reflects blood glucose control over the previous 2–3 mo)
recorded within 6 wk either side of the 9 mo follow-up point were used in order to maximize
completeness of follow-up data. Standard blood pressure measures, serum total cholesterol,
HDL cholesterol, urinary sodium/creatinine ratio, renal function (eGFR), United Kingdom
Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk score, anxiety and depression, quality of life, self-effi-
cacy, self-reported physical activity, self-reported exercise tolerance, self-reported alcohol
intake and diabetes knowledge, number of attendances at accident and emergency, at out-of-
hours care, with practice nurse, with general practitioner (GP), hospital admissions, and num-
ber of telephone/email contacts with practice nurses and GPs were also compared between
groups as pre-specified additional outcome measures. Use of health care resources (number
and duration of hospital admissions, practice and out-of-hours consultations, routine reviews

 for BP or diabetes, prescriptions for antihypertensive and diabetes drugs) and adverse events
were extracted from participants’ electronic family practice records by research nurses.
Statistical Analysis
We used distribution of HbA1c and BP from the Lothian population-based diabetes register
for 2008 (mean [SD] HbA1c of 68 [15] mmol/mol and mean [SD] systolic blood pressure of
149 [13] mmHg) when planning the trial (see protocol for further details). Using this informa-
tion, we estimated that a randomized controlled trial with 125 people completing each arm
with no change in values in the control group at the end of the trial would have 80% power at
5% significance to detect a 6 mmol/mol fall in HbA1c and a 5 mmHg fall in systolic BP in the
intervention group. We aimed to recruit a total of 320 trial participants to allow for 20%
attrition.
Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using a complete case analysis assuming
missing outcome data were missing completely at random. Difference in mean HbA1c between
intervention and control groups, the primary outcome, was estimated using linear regression
with a 95% confidence interval for the difference, after adjusting for baseline HbA1c and with
the addition of minimization strata (for which adjustment was accidentally omitted from the
protocol) using analysis of covariance. Clustering by practice was investigated for the primary
outcome by calculating the intra-cluster correlation coefficient. A priori planned sensitivity
analyses involved (i) exclusion of participants with values of the primary outcome variable
more than four standard deviations from the mean and (ii) a multiple imputation analysis
using the same variables as in the main analysis (including the outcome variable) with the addi-
tion of weight, baseline ABPM systolic blood pressure, baseline ABPM diastolic blood pressure,
baseline HDL cholesterol, and baseline total cholesterol, based on 30 imputation datasets, and
combining results using Rubin’s rules [19]. Similar linear regression methods were used for
systolic and diastolic BPs and weight and the other continuous secondary outcomes listed in
the protocol. Negative binomial regression was used for outcomes measured as counts, adjust-
ing for baseline and minimization strata, where possible. Logistic regression was used for
binary outcomes, adjusting for the minimization strata. Subgroup analyses and tests for inter-
actions were performed as described in the protocol and S5 Text [11]. Analyses were performed
using version 9.3 of the SAS system for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States).
There was no data monitoring committee. The trial had the registration number
ISRCTN71674628 in Current Controlled Trials.
Results
Forty-four practices were invited to participate, of which 42 recruited participants (with a
mean of 8 participants per practice, min 1, max 46). The intra-cluster correlation coefficient
was calculated to be below zero (-0.0012) and so there was no evidence of clustering by prac-
tice. We invited 2,680 potential participants, 500 were assessed for eligibility, and 321 were ran-
domized, 160 to the intervention and 161 to the control arms, respectively (see Fig 1:
CONSORT flow chart). Just over half of the participants were recruited from Lothian and Bor-
ders. The first participant was randomized on June 6, 2011, and the last was randomized on
July 19, 2013, with the last follow-up visit on May 21, 2014. Data for the primary outcome were
available for 146 people (91%) in the intervention group and 139 people (86%) in the control
group.
The two groups had similar distributions of relevant characteristics at baseline as shown in
Tables 1 and 2 (summarizing distribution of minimization criteria for all randomized partici-
pants and participants contributing to the primary outcome analyses respectively) and Tables

 3 and 4 (summarizing clinical characteristics for all randomized participants and participants
contributing to the primary outcome analyses respectively). The mean (SD) age of participants
was 61.0 (9.8) years with a range of 33.7 to 86.3 years; two-thirds were men and mean (SD)
duration of diabetes was 7.4 (5.8) years. Twenty-five percent of participants in the intervention
group submitted blood glucose readings as requested (one fasting and one nonfasting blood
glucose at least twice weekly) with 21% of participants submitting less than a quarter of
requested measurements.
Primary and secondary outcomes are described in detail in Table 5. The absolute mean dif-
ference in HbA1c between groups was 5.60 mmol/mol; (95% CI 2.38 to 8.81 mmol/mol;
p = 0.0007) lower in the monitored compared with the control arm. The effect size was similar
after removing outliers more than four standard deviations away from the mean in the primary
outcome variable in a sensitivity analysis: 5.32 mmol/mol 95% CI 2.12 to 8.52 mmol/mol,
p = 0.0012. After performing multiple imputation, the difference was estimated to be 4.75 95%
CI 1.55 to 7.95 mmol/mol, p = 0.0036.
Ambulatory BP data were available at follow-up for 229 people, and BP was lower in the
intervention than control group: systolic BP by 3.06 mmHg; 95% CI 0.56 to 5.56 mm Hg;
p = 0.017 and diastolic BP by 2.17 mmHg; 95% CI 0.62 to 3.72 mmHg; p = 0.006. Weight at fol-
low-up was not significantly different between trial arms (0.35 kg lower for the 145 people in
the intervention compared to the 135 people in control group for whom data were available;
95% CI -0.83 to 1.54 kg, p = 0.557).

 Additional outcome measures are reported in S1 and S2 Tables. Prescribing patterns for dia-
betes treatments or anti-hypertensive drugs were similar between intervention and control
groups as demonstrated in Tables 6 and 7. Insulin treatment was started during follow-up for
eight people in the intervention group and six people in the control group. In addition, post-hoc
linear regression models adjusted for baseline defined daily doses (DDDs) [20] and minimiza-
tion variables did not identify statistically significant differences in mean DDD at follow-up of
either diabetes treatment (0.003 [95% CI -0.21 to 0.21]) or anti-hypertensive treatment (0.18
[95% CI -0.04 to 0.39]) between groups. In particular, there was no evidence that the interven-
tion increased anxiety levels. The only statistically significant difference between randomization
groups in use of health services was a greater number of telephone calls between practice nurses
and patients in the intervention compared with control group (rate ratio 7.50 [95% CI 4.45 to
12.65, p < 0.0001]) (S3 Table). The intervention cost significantly more than usual care (mean
difference per patient £286.00 [95% CI £154.27 to £409.62]) due to telemonitoring service costs
and additional nurse phone consultations. Health economic modelling of the cost-effectiveness
of the intervention is in progress and will be reported separately. There were few adverse events
that could be attributed to diabetes or BP control and these were equally distributed between the
intervention and control groups (S4 Table provides further detail).
There were no statistically significant interactions with group allocation for any of the pre-
specified sub-groups of age, sex, socioeconomic status, baseline HbA1c, monitored systolic
blood pressure, or body mass index (see S5 Text and S5–S10 Tables).

 Discussion
In this multicenter pragmatic trial based in UK family practice we observed clinically and sta-
tistically significantly greater improvements in glycemic control among people with poor glyce-
mic control of type 2 diabetes who were offered supported telemonitoring over 9 mo than
among the comparison group offered usual care. There were also significant reductions in
blood pressure. The key feature of our trial is robust evidence suggesting that blood glucose
monitoring with relatively little additional support from health professionals can be of value in
terms of improving glycemic control in people who have previously had poor glycemic control.
This finding contrasts with that of a systematic review published previously that suggested that
unsupported self-monitoring of blood glucose does not have clinically significant beneficial
effects [21].

 The effect size (5�5 mmol/mol) we observed in our trial is the same as that used to establish
efficacy of new drugs by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) algo-
rithms and guidelines [22]. Similar improvements in systolic and diastolic BP to those observed
in this trial of 3.3 and 1.4 mmHg were reported in the Heart Outcome Prevention Evaluation
(HOPE) study and were associated with a 22% reduction in relative risk of cardiovascular mor-
tality, myocardial infarction, or stroke [23]. In contrast to trials of strict glycemic control, mean
weight did not increase in the intervention group. The lack of change in weight may reflect die-
tary changes or may be related to shorter follow-up in this trial compared to trials of intensive
glycemic control [24]. In contrast to many other non-pharmacological interventions, this was
achieved with a relatively small increase in researcher or health professional workload.

 The strengths of this trial include recruitment from family practice of people with type 2
diabetes who have poor glycemic control despite the incentives offered to family practitioners
for controlling diabetes and who constitute a more representative group than people partici-
pating in trials at specialist centers. In addition, diabetes management continued to take
place in normal family practice rather than in a research setting. Objective measures were
used for primary and principal secondary outcomes of glycemic control (HbA1c), BP
(ABPM) and weight. There was limited loss to follow-up, and the sensitivity analyses and
tests for interaction suggest that the reported findings are robust. However, the nature of tri-
als is that although the majority of family practices who were invited agreed to participate,
only 12% of people identified as potentially eligible from this challenging group of patients
were randomized in this trial. It is not possible to determine what proportion of the general
population of people with type 2 diabetes would wish to use telemonitoring if it were pro-
vided as a service and whether they would all be able to achieve similar results. Further work
is required to determine what barriers there may be to implement telehealth in this group at
scale, given the large numbers of people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (almost
100,000 people, or 2% of the population in Scotland alone). Additionally it is important to
identify whether a shorter intervention may be equally clinically effective (and potentially
more cost-effective than a longer intervention) or whether ongoing monitoring is required to
maintain the effect.
The results of previous similar studies are conflicting, which may reflect the quality of the
research, variation in settings between research clinics and normal clinical practice and the
diverse nature of complex interventions. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of data
from 5,069 patients participating in 26 studies of home telehealth for diabetes, the weighted
mean difference in HbA1c between home telemonitoring and comparison groups was -0.21%
(95% CI -0.35 to -0.08) in the available 21 studies, which were noted to be of variable method-
ological quality [25]. A meta-analysis of data from 2,552 participants in six clinical trials of
self-monitoring of blood glucose among people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes
reported a mean reduction in HbA1c of 2.7 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.9) mmol/mol at 6 mo in the
intervention compared with control group, which was consistent across all strata and was
described as a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful result [21]. The results of
the type 2 diabetes component of the Whole Systems Demonstrator cluster randomized con-
trolled trial with 12 mo follow-up were similar in that HbA1c was lower by 0.21% or 2.3

 mmol/mol (95% CI, 0.04% to 0.38, p = 0.013) in the intervention [26]. However a meta-analy-
sis of 13 randomized controlled trials of telemedicine among 4,207 people with diabetes
reported a statistically significant and clinically relevant absolute decline in HbA1c level in
the intervention compared to control groups similar to our finding (mean difference -4.8
mmol/mol and 95% CI 6.7 to -2.8 mmol/mol; p < 0.001), but with evidence of heterogeneity
between trials [27].
The International Diabetes Federation has identified seven essential elements of self-moni-
toring of blood glucose (SMBG): patient education, provider education, structured SMBG pro-
file, SMBG goals, feedback, data used to modify treatment, and interactive communication or
shared decision making [28]. Our intervention included all of these elements and, as for all
complex interventions, it is not clear which component had the most effect and what effect tel-
emonitoring had relative to more frequent contacts (e.g., office visits and telephone calls) or
better tailored advice. A recent systematic review found that none of 15 studies of telemonitor-
ing interventions in type 2 diabetes, all of which were performed outside the UK, included all
of these elements, but those that included five or more achieved significant improvements in
HbA1c [29].
A further meta-analysis of 23 trials with 7,037 participants and high levels of heterogeneity
reported that home BP telemonitoring improved office systolic blood pressure by 4.71(95% CI
3.24 to 6.18) and diastolic blood pressure by 2.45 (1.57 to 3.33) mmHg [30]. One of the meta-
analyses mentioned above also summarized the effect of telemedicine on systolic BP from eight
trials performed among people with diabetes, reporting no significant effect (-1.6 mmHg; 95%
CI -7.2 to 4.1 mmHg; p = 0.585) [27]. It is important to note that these trials were performed in
people with poorly controlled blood pressure, whereas our trial participants on average had
reasonable blood pressure control at baseline and that we used the gold standard of ambulatory
blood pressure monitoring as the outcome.
We were surprised that prescribing patterns did not differ markedly between the two arms
of trial participants as our, and other, blood pressure telemonitoring studies reported increased
anti-hypertensive prescribing in the intervention arm [10,30]. Improved glycemic control is
frequently associated with increased weight, possibly due to failure to lose calories through gly-
cosuria [24], but we observed no difference in weight change by trial arm. These findings sug-
gest that the effect may have been mediated by improved self-management, resulting in
changes in diet and lifestyle or increased adherence to drug treatment, rather than intensifica-
tion of treatment. This explanation is supported by the findings of the nested qualitative study
performed within the trial, in which participants reported that both the information they
received from self-monitoring and knowledge that their glycemic control was being observed
encouraged them to make lifestyle changes [31]. Unpublished data from the qualitative
research suggest that reasons for not submitting glucose measurements included technical
problems from the start and forgetting to take readings, particularly when away from home. In
contrast, the responses to relevant questionnaires did not provide any evidence of improved
concordance with lifestyle recommendations or treatment, but it is possible that the question-
naires may not be sensitive to such changes, as has been suggested by other studies of the per-
formance of some of the questionnaires [32,33].
In summary, telemonitoring and supported self-management of blood glucose can result in
clinically meaningful improvements in blood glucose among people with poorly controlled
type 2 diabetes managed in routine family practice while requiring relatively small increases in
clinician workload. There are also additional benefits for control of blood pressure in this pop-
ulation. Further research is required to determine if these changes are sustained over time and
can be achieved if the intervention is used more widely or when targeted at specific patient
groups.
