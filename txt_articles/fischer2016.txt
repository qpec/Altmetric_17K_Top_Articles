IMPORTANCE Indoor tanning is prevalent among young adults and women and is associated
with increased risk of melanoma. Evidence suggests that indoor tanners may be more
inclined to adopt poor photoprotective practices that further increase their risk of skin
cancer; however, gaps in the literature exist in young adults and by indoor tanning frequency.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between indoor tanning frequency and behaviors
related to skin cancer prevention and to investigate whether these associations vary by age
group or sex.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional population-based study of US 2015
National Health Interview Survey data including 10 262 non-Hispanic white adults aged 18 to
60 years without a history of skin cancer.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rare/never use of sunscreen, protective clothing, shade;
multiple sunburns within the past year; previous full-body skin examination.
RESULTS Of the 10 262 individuals in our study population (49% female; median age, 39 y),
787 (7.0%) reported having tanned indoors in the past year. Among individuals aged 18 to 34
years, frequent indoor tanners (�10 times in the past year) were more likely to report
never/rare use of protective clothing (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.49)
and shade (aPR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03-1.70), compared with individuals who did not tan indoors.
Among women aged 18 to 60 years, those who frequently tanned indoors were more likely to
rarely/never use sunscreen (aPR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.62), protective clothing (aPR, 1.27; 95%
CI, 1.15-1.42), and shade (aPR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.25-1.90) on a warm sunny day, as well as more
likely to report multiple sunburns in the past year (aPR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.45) compared
with those who did not tan indoors. Individuals who tanned indoors in the past year were not
significantly more likely to have undergone a previous full-body skin examination in any
subpopulation examined.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individuals who tan indoors often exhibited a concurrent
tendency to sunburn, avoid sun protection, and avoid skin cancer screening. Thus, the
findings highlight that in addition to tanning bed avoidance, it is critical to emphasize sun
protection and skin cancer screening in individuals who tan indoors.

I
ndoor tanning is associated with an increased risk of
melanoma,1 with higher risk among individuals initiating
indoor tanning prior to age 35 years.2 Indoor tanning is also
associated with increased sun exposure,3-5 which may in-
crease the risk for skin cancer beyond the risk that is attribut-
able to indoor tanning alone. Individuals who tan indoors may
similarly be less likely to engage in primary and secondary skin
cancer prevention behaviors. Yet, the reported results to date
that examine the association between indoor tanning and sun
protection vary by age, sex, and geographic location,4-9 with
little focus on the young adult population, despite the high
prevalence of indoor tanning in this age group.10 Further-
more, studies evaluating the association between increasing
frequency of indoor tanning and behaviors related to pri-
mary and secondary skin cancer prevention are limited. The
objectives of the study were thus (1) to explore the associa-
tion between indoor tanning frequency and behaviors re-
lated to primary and secondary skin cancer prevention and (2)
to examine whether this association varied by age or sex.
Methods
Study Population
The study was conducted using self-reported data from the
2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (N = 33 672;
final adult response rate, 55.2%), which uses a multistage
survey design to generate a representative sample of the US
civilian noninstitutionalized population.11 The analysis was
limited to non-Hispanic whites (N = 20 855) because of the
high prevalence of indoor tanning and high incidence of skin
cancer in this subgroup relative to other subgroups.10,12
Respondents with a history of skin cancer (N = 1076) were
excluded to minimize bias from postcancer behavioral
changes.13 The study population was further limited to par-
ticipants aged 18 to 60 years (N = 12 952) because of the
lower prevalence of indoor tanning in older persons.10 Indi-
viduals (N = 620) who responded that they “do not go out in
the sun” to any of 7 questions defined herein (tanning abil-
ity, sun sensitivity, sunscreen, shade, wide-brimmed hat,
long sleeves, long pants) were excluded for greater compara-
bility of sun exposure profiles across categories of indoor
tanning frequency, as other survey questions quantifying
sun exposure were unavailable and as frequency of sun-
screen, protective clothing, and shade use was not obtain-
able in these individuals. The study used deidentified data
and was therefore exempt from review by the Johns Hopkins
University Institutional Review Board.
Definitions of Covariates
Frequency of indoor tanning was defined by the NHIS as the
number of times in the past 12 months that a survey respon-
dent had used a sunlamp, sunbed, or tanning booth (not in-
cluding spray-on tans). Responses were categorized as none
(0 times), moderate (1-9 times), and frequent (≥10 times) in-
door tanning with consideration for the frequency distribu-
tion and comparability with previous literature.10 Self-
reported age, sex, region of the United States, family history
of skin cancer, highest level of education, and body mass in-
dex (BMI) were reported. Tanning ability was characterized by
the NHIS as the skin’
s appearance after being out in the sun
repeatedly, such as every day for 2 weeks, without sun-
screen, a hat, or protective clothing. Sun sensitivity was char-
acterized by the NHIS as the skin’
s response to going out into
thesunfor1hourwithoutphotoprotectionafterseveralmonths
of sun avoidance. Physical activity level was categorized using
the sum of reported minutes of mild to moderate and vigor-
ous activity per week.
Definitions of Outcome Variables
Survey respondents were asked 5 questions regarding how
often they (1) use sunscreen, (2) stay in the shade, (3) wear a
hat that shades their face, ears, and neck, such as a hat with
a wide brim all around, (4) wear a long-sleeved shirt, and (5)
wear long pants or other clothing that reaches their ankles,
when they go outside on a warm sunny day for more than 1
hour. For each of the 5 questions, we included responses of
always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never. For
stable estimates, we combined responses of rare and never
use. We defined rare/never use of protective clothing to be
individuals who did not report at least sometimes using a
wide-brimmed hat, long sleeves, or long pants for stable
estimates and generalizability. Multiple sunburns indicated
at least 2 sunburns reported within the past 12 months. Pre-
vious full-body skin examination was assessed by asking
respondents, “Have you ever had all of your skin from head
to toe checked for cancer either by a dermatologist or some
other kind of doctor?”14
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate associations between indoor tanning frequency and
other covariates were assessed using the Rao-Scott χ2 test for
categorical variables and the global F test from linear regres-
sion analyses for continuous variables (BMI, age). Multivari-
able Poisson regression15 was performed in the context of the
Taylor series (linearized) method for variance estimation11 to
estimateadjustedprevalenceratios(aPRs)fortheoutcomevari-
ables of interest using indoor tanning frequency as the main
exposure variable. All regression analyses were adjusted for
Key Points
Question How is indoor tanning frequency associated with
behaviors related to skin cancer prevention?
Findings This cross-sectional study using data from the US 2015
National Health Interview Survey found that young adults who
frequently tanned indoors were significantly more likely to
never/rarely use protective clothing or shade compared with
young adults who did not tan indoors. Similar findings were
observed among women.
Meaning In 2 groups with high indoor tanning prevalence (young
adults and women), frequent indoor tanners often exhibited a
concurrent tendency to practice poor sun protection, which may
increase their risk of skin cancer beyond the risk associated with
indoor tanning alone.

family history of skin cancer and physical activity level did not
substantially affect point estimates in any models (data not
shown); therefore, the more parsimonious models without
these additional covariates were used. Estimates of associa-
tion did not substantially differ when using only persons with
a complete set of data compared with using multiple imputa-
tion for missing data by generating 20 imputed data sets using
chained equations; thus, findings using the former method are
presented(N = 10 262).ThePtrendwascomputedusingtheWald

cer represented approximately 30% of the 2015 US adult
population, equating to an estimated 85 million individuals.
Among all respondents in our study population (Table 1),
3.6% reported moderate indoor tanning (1-9 times in the
past year; median of 3 times) and 3.4% reported frequent
indoor tanning (≥10 times in the past year; median of 20
times), with a higher prevalence of frequent indoor tanning
among women (5.8%). Differences in the distribution of age,
sex, geographic region, sensitivity to sunburn, tanning abil-
ity, education, and BMI were observed according to indoor
tanning frequency (Table 1).
In the overall study population, more frequent tanning
bed use was associated with poor use of sunscreen, protec-
tive clothing, and shade and was associated with having
sunburned multiple times in the past year (eTable in the
Supplement). Among individuals aged 18 to 34 years
(Table 2), those who frequently tanned indoors compared
with those who did not tan indoors in the past year were
more likely to report rarely/never wearing protective cloth-
ing (aPR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.49) and rarely/never seeking
shade (aPR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03-1.70) on a warm sunny day.
Similar associations were observed among individuals aged
35 to 60 years. Additionally, among individuals aged 35 to
60 years, frequent indoor tanners were more likely to report
rarely/never applying sunscreen (aPR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-
1.62) and moderate indoor tanners were more likely report
multiple sunburns in the past year (aPR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.24-
2.10) compared with those who did not tan indoors.
Women who frequently tanned indoors compared with
women who did not tan indoors were more likely to report
rarely/never applying sunscreen (aPR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.62),
rarely/neverwearingprotectiveclothing(aPR,1.27;95%CI,1.15-

1.90), and multiple sunburns in the past year (aPR, 1.21; 95%
CI, 1.00-1.45) (Table 3). Among men, those who frequently
tanned indoors were more likely to rarely/never seek shade
compared with those who did not tan indoors (aPR, 1.45; 95%
CI, 1.03-2.03). Men who moderately tanned indoors were more
likely to rarely/never use protective clothing (aPR, 1.45; 95%
CI, 1.15-1.83) and to report multiple sunburns in the past year
(aPR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.09-2.21) compared with men who did not
tan indoors.

Discussion
Using nationally representative data, our findings are gener-
alizable to non-Hispanic white adults aged 18 to 60 years
without previous skin cancer and reporting sun exposure.
This study observed that individuals who frequently tanned
indoors were more likely to report poor sun-protective prac-
tices on a warm sunny day and were more likely to report
multiple sunburns in the past year, compared with individu-
als who did not tan indoors in the past year. Among indi-
viduals aged 18 to 34 years, frequent indoor tanners were
more likely to report never/rare use of protective clothing
and shade compared with individuals who did not tan
indoors. Among women aged 18 to 60 years, those who fre-
quently tanned indoors were more likely to rarely/never use
sunscreen, protective clothing, and shade on a warm sunny
day, as well as more likely to report multiple sunburns in the
past year compared with those who did not tan indoors.
Individuals who tanned indoors were not significantly more
likely to have undergone a full-body skin examination com-
pared with individuals who did not tan indoors, regardless
of sex or age group.
This study adds to the literature examining the associa-
tion between indoor tanning and behaviors related to pri-
mary and secondary skin cancer prevention4-9 by contribut-
ing recent information in the US population and offering more
detailedinformationonfrequencyofindoortanningbysexand
in different age groups. The finding among young adults aged
18 to 34 years that frequent indoor tanners were more likely
to avoid certain sun-protective practices than individuals who
did not tan indoors contributes to the limited literature in this
age group, despite evidence to support that this age group ex-
hibits higher prevalence of indoor tanning and stronger ef-
fectsofindoortanningontheriskofmelanomarelativetoolder
adults.2,10Theoverallassociationbetweenfrequentindoortan-
ning and poor sunscreen use complements other studies in the
United States4,7,9; however, the associations with protective

Abbreviations: aPR, adjusted prevalence ratio; BMI, body mass index.
a Study population included sun-exposed non-Hispanic white individuals aged 18 to 60 years reporting no history of skin cancer with complete data from the 2015
National Health Interview Survey.
bIndoor tanning frequency is defined as none (0 times), moderate (1-9 times), and frequent (�10 times) in the past year.
c The P value for linear trend (P value for trend) was calculated using the Wald statistic treating the median frequency in each indoor tanning category as continuous.
dOutcome variable: rarely/never use of the photoprotective practice vs at least sometimes using the photoprotective practice.
e Percentages and mean values are weighted according to US census data.
f Prevalence ratios are adjusted for continuous age, sex, region, tanning ability, education, physical activity, and continuous BMI.
g Outcome variable: multiple (�2) sunburns vs fewer than 2 sunburns in the past year.
h Outcome variable: having undergone a previous full-body skin examination vs never having undergone a full-body skin examination.

clothing, shade, and sunburn have not been examined in this
population. The observation that sun-protective behaviors
worsened as the frequency of indoor tanning increased high-
lights that individuals in the United States who are at el-
evated risk for skin cancer due to frequent indoor tanning are
more likely to further increase their risk by implementing poor
sun protection. Whereas prior evidence suggests that a higher
percentage of individuals who tan indoors seek skin cancer
screeningcomparedwithindividualswhodonottanindoors,17
our analysis using more recent data failed to observe a signifi-
cant association, even when combining all individuals who
tanned indoors in the past year regardless of frequency. Evi-
dence suggests that the prevalence of indoor tanning use is
strikingly higher in females vs males and in younger vs older
adults.10 As increasing frequency of indoor tanning has been
shown to increase the risk of skin cancer in a dose-dependent
manner,2 indoor tanning is a public health concern and may
contribute to the increasing incidence of melanoma ob-
served among young women.18,19 This study observed that re-
cent indoor tanning frequency was associated with poor use
of sun protection in a dose-dependent manner among women.
Limitations of the study include the self-reported nature
ofthedatathatissubjecttorecallbias;thecross-sectionalstudy
design that prevented examination of the temporal direction
of associations to make any causal inferences; the lack of in-
formation on self-administered skin cancer screening, which
is an important form of early skin cancer detection; and infor-
mation quantifying sun exposure, although individuals who
denied sun exposure were excluded. Furthermore, the lim-
ited number of individuals reporting indoor tanning pre-
vented the exploration of associations in smaller subpopula-
tionsandmayhavecontributedtolackofsignificanceobserved
in some subgroups.
Conclusions
Individuals who frequently tan indoors already have a worri-
some risk factor profile for skin cancer, yet they continue to
practice poor photoprotection along with increased sun
exposure, increasing their risk for skin cancer beyond that
associated with the use of indoor tanning alone. Yet, despite
their heightened risk factor profile, individuals who fre-
quently tan indoors are not significantly more likely to
engage in skin cancer screening. These results demonstrate
that many individuals who tan indoors may not acknowledge
the long-term risks associated with increased UV exposure.
Thus, these findings highlight the importance of not only
emphasizing avoidance of indoor tanning in public health
messages and physician communication, but also reiterating
the need for sun protection and skin cancer screening in this
population. Proper sun protection is critical in guarding
against harmful UV irradiation associated with the develop-
ment of skin cancers.20-22 Regular skin examination plays an
equally vital role in reducing skin cancer risks. Patients who
received a full-body skin examination in the year prior to
their melanoma diagnosis were significantly more likely to
have thinner tumors,23 which are associated with better
prognosis and survival.24,25 Thus, taking an active approach
to sun protection and skin cancer screening in high-risk
populations, such as indoor tanners, may reduce the morbid-
ity and mortality associated with skin cancer.
