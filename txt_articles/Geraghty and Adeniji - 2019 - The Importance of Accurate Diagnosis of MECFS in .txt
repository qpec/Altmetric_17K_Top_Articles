Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic illness that
causes a range of debilitating symptoms. While most research has focused on adults,
the illness also presents in children and adolescents. Many physicians find it difficult to
diagnose the illness. In this commentary paper, we discuss a range of salient themes
that have emerged from our ongoing research into the prevalence of ME/CFS in children
and adolescents. We discuss reasons why pediatric prevalence estimates vary widely in
the literature, from almost 0% to as high as 3%. We argue that there is considerable
misdiagnosis of pediatric cases and over-inflation of estimates of pediatric ME/CFS.
Many children and teenagers with general fatigue and other medical complaints may
meet loose diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. We make recommendations for improving
epidemiological research and identifying pediatric ME/CFS in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION
Children and adolescents with suspected myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome
(ME/CFS) regularly present with persistent fatigue, sleep disturbance, and an array of other
symptoms, such as headaches and cognitive difficulties (1). ME/CFS is noted for being a major
cause of long-term school absence and has profound negative ramifications for social development,
educational achievement, and future employment (2, 3). The illness is associated with co-morbid
anxiety and depression (4). It is known that children with chronic health problems exhibit higher
rates of distress, anxiety, and depression (5). Taking these factors together, it is vital that young
patients with this illness are correctly identified, so that they might receive a speedy diagnosis and
appropriate medical care and social support.
Epidemiological studies report a wide range of prevalence estimates of ME/CFS in this
age group. Some estimates are as low as 0.1% (6), while others suggest rates of 2.6% (7);
and rates for CFS-like illness go as high as 4.4% (8). Girls are at greater risk of developing
ME/CFS, particularly post-puberty (9). This wide spread in prevalence estimates appears
to result from researchers using different diagnostic criteria to classify cases and applying
different methods to sample and identify cases, such as postal or telephone questionnaires,
community-based surveys, and clinical interviews. Given the general lack of consistency
in methodologies applied, inconsistency in prevalence estimates is not surprising. However,
such inconsistency suggests a problem with the methods used to identify young ME/CFS
sufferers. It is clear, with estimates as low as 0.1% and as high as 3–4%, many young
patients are being misdiagnosed, either under or over. Misdiagnosis in this vulnerable
group has profound implications, since a false positive diagnosis may lead to inappropriate
labeling of a child with ME/CFS and improper intervention with treatment (10), while
 Geraghty and Adeniji
Diagnosis of Pediatric ME/CFS
under-diagnosis might mean a child or teen not receiving the care
they require. If researchers are unable to reliably identify pediatric
cases of ME/CFS, how confident can we be that clinicians are able
to diagnose cases at the clinic level? We know doctors often find it
difficult to diagnose ME/CFS and adult sufferers commonly wait
an average of 5 years for a diagnosis (11).
THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM
The International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group
Criteria (12) is one of the most cited in the literature. The
Fukuda Criteria requires severe and disabling new-onset fatigue
lasting at least 6 months, accompanied by four or more of
eight symptoms: impaired memory or concentration, sore throat,
tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscle pain, multiple
joint pain, headaches, unrefreshing sleep, and post-exertional
malaise (PEM). However, in the UK an alternative case definition,
known as the Oxford Criteria (13), is promoted, that is much
broader, given it only requires a single symptom—severe and
disabling fatigue of definite onset that is present for at least
6 months and affects physical and mental function. Other
symptoms often found in ME/CFS patients, headaches, sleep
problems, orthostatic intolerance and so on, may be present, but
are not required to be diagnosed with ME/CFS using Oxford
Criteria.
In 2015, a report by the US Institutes of Health found the
Oxford Criteria too broad to be of value in investigations of
ME/CFS (14). The report stated that use of this case definition
could impair progress and cause harm by conflating fatigue as a
complaint with the illness ME/CFS. The Fukuda case definition
has also been criticized; while it requires the presence of other
symptoms to render a diagnosis, it does not specifically mandate
that patients experience post-exterional malaise (PEM), which is
considered a cardinal symptom of the illness. There are newer
case criteria for ME/CFS, such as the Canadian Consensus
Criteria and the International Consensus Criteria or the U.S.
Institute of Medicine (now known as the National Academy of
Medicine) Systemic Exertional Intolerance Disease formulation,
that require the presence of PEM, however there continues to
be a lack of consensus on which diagnostic criteria should be
used (15). Researchers studying children or teens with the illness
arbitrarily select a criterion to identify cases.
Most research in ME/CFS has focused on adults with the
illness. In many adult studies, broad case definitions that
require little more than fatigue as the presenting complaint,
have been used to recruit patients into clinical trials of
treatment interventions; commonly psychological and behavioral
treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and
graded exercise therapy (GET). For example, the largest clinical
trial of psycho-behavioral treatments in adults, the UK PACE
trial, tested CBT and GET against standard medical care and a
pacing therapy (16). The PACE trial reported CBT and GET to be
moderately effective compared with pacing treatment or standard
medical care. However, recent commentaries have questioned
whether PACE recruited true-positive ME/CFS cases (17, 18)—
-the Oxford Criteria was employed to select participants. Recent
reanalyses of data from the PACE trial suggests treatment benefits
were grossly over-stated (19).
Another major problem in this field of research is the
ubiquity of “fatigue” or “chronic fatigue” as a medical complaint
and its conflation with “chronic fatigue syndrome.” Pediatric
studies of ME/CFS that apply broad diagnostic criteria may
recruit cohorts with generalized fatigue, rather than cohorts with
the cardinal symptomology of myalgic encephalomyelitis (20),
proposed by Ramsay (21). The Oxford Criteria requirement to
only need ongoing fatigue as a presenting complaint means many
young patients with general fatigue issues could be misclassified
as having ME/CFS. Up to 20% of adult patients seen in
community/primary care settings present to doctors complaining
of fatigue and up to 33% of adolescents experience fatigue at
least 4 days per week (22, 23). UK community doctors are
encouraged to refer young patients with suspected ME/CFS to be
treated within specialized CFS clinics that offer CBT and exercise
therapy (24). However, for adult ME/CFS patients referred to
these clinics, there is a diagnostic error rate of at least 40% (25, 26)
and the majority of patients treated (90%+) still report having
ME/CFS at long-term follow up (27). In one of these clinics, many
patients were eventually diagnosed with other conditions to
explain their fatigue; 47% being diagnosed with a chronic disease,
20% a primary sleep disorder, 15% a psychological/psychiatric
illness (most commonly, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic
stress disorder), and 4% a cardiovascular disorder (26).
Community doctors find it difficult to differentiate fatigue linked
to undiagnosed medical or mental health complaints, from clear
ME/CFS.
A series of epidemiological studies into ME/CFS prevalence
in teenagers conducted at the University of Bristol used a birth
cohort database called the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children (ALSPAC). This database includes information on
14,500 families from Bristol and the surrounding region, with
health status monitored through self-reported questionnaires
filled out by both parents and children. The ALSPAC database,
in conjunction with follow-up questionnaires, has been used to
assess pediatric chronic fatigue prevalence, with rates reported
of 1.47% at age 13 years, 2.22% at age 16 years, and 2.99%
at age 18 years (28). Here “chronic disabling fatigue” is
used as a proxy measure of chronic fatigue syndrome. In
one of these studies published in Pediatrics, 41% of parents
(n2201) reported their teenager being tired or lacking energy
in the last month. Clearly, fatigue is a common complaint
among adolescents. Of 2,201 possible CFS cases identified, after
exclusions (e.g., fatigue not causing loss of activity), 4.17% (n207)
with fatigue > 3 months and 2.76% (n137) with fatigue > 6
months were classified as possible cases (29). After a “Life at
16 Questionnaire” was administered to this cohort to match
16-year olds with self-reported fatigue–this generated a CFS
prevalence estimate of 1.9% (29). Across the ALSPAC studies,
estimation of prevalence uses proxy measures of CFS (chronic
disabling fatigue), parental reported fatigue, self-reported fatigue
and or school absence; however, there is a lack of detailed
clinical screening or the requirement for cardinal symptoms
of ME/CFS to be present, such as post-exertional malaise.
As such, the near 2% prevalence rate to emerge from the

ALSPAC studies, is likely to be an over-estimation of pediatric
ME/CFS.
NOT ALL FATIGUE IS THE SAME
Since fatigue is a common complaint among children and
adolescents and up to half of all parents perceive their children
to have “a problem” with fatigue (29, 30), there is a clear need for
robust clinical investigations to assess the causes of presenting
fatigue in young patients–whether it is the usual fatigue many
teenagers experience, or whether it is the type of fatigue that
is characteristic of ME/CFS (not all fatigue is the same). Any
methodological approach that conflates the symptom of fatigue
with ME/CFS is likely to inflate case estimates. For example, in
the 2.99% prevalence rate of chronic disabling fatigue reported
at age 18 years (28), only 29% of this CDF cohort meet the US
CDC/Fukuda criteria for CFS; whereas presumably most would
meet UK guidelines for CFS (31). In UK pediatric prevalence
studies that apply the CDC criteria, pediatric prevalence falls to
0.019–0.05% (32, 33). This is an illuminating finding.
In the Crawley et al. prevalence study of chronic disabling
fatigue at age 13, only 30.7% of teens identified as possible
CFS cases had presented to a doctor complaining of fatigue
(34). Presumably, the other 69.3% didn’t feel their fatigue was
related to a medical condition like ME/CFS, that required medical
attention. Even when children or teenagers (most likely with
concerned parent) present to doctors complaining of fatigue, a
diagnosis of ME/CFS requires a triangulation approach, using
multiple strands of information to build up a clinical case profile
that helps exclude other potential medical or psychological
conditions (35). Where careful clinical screening is applied, with
clinicians undertaking a detailed case history, laboratory tests or
psychological screening, pediatric prevalence rates fall to as low
as 0.1% (6) or 0.06% (36).
Depression, mental health complaints and substance abuse,
are a major cause of unexplained fatigue in young ME/CFS
patients (6), thus there is a clear need for pediatric patients to
be carefully screened before being given a ME/CFS diagnosis
(37). The difficulty for any physician will be how to differentiate
co-morbid depression and anxiety from primary depression or
anxiety, as the cause of presenting fatigue. Failure to robustly
assess mental health as a possible cause of fatigue is likely to lead
to inflated estimates of ME/CFS. In the study of CFS rates among
16 year-olds, rates of CFS fell by more than two-thirds, from 1.89
to just 0.6%, after investigators removed those with high levels of
depressive symptoms from their analysis (29). This lower 0.6%
figure is much closer to rates of ME/CFS reported among adults,
which commonly fall between 0.1 and 0.5% (38).
IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT
The problem with over-estimation of pediatric ME/CFS is an
epidemiological one that is likely to impact resource allocation
and health planning. However, misdiagnosis at the clinic level
is even more concerning–many children and teenagers may be
wrongly diagnosed with ME/CFS. These young patients will
most likely trust a diagnosis given by a physician and they are
likely to follow recommended care, which might include being
offered psycho-behavioral therapies like CBT or graded exercise
(which are recommended based on clinical trials that apply the
same loose diagnostic tools that generate inflated prevalence
estimates). The Bristol ALSPAC research team, that report
prevalence rates as high as 2%, are active in testing CBT and GET
on children and teenagers with suspected ME/CFS (39, 40). There
is a concern that psychological therapies may help teenagers
that perhaps have undiagnosed psychological complaints or
general fatigue complaints, who are inappropriately included into
clinical trials. Basically, many teenagers with general chronic
fatigue issues may meet UK Oxford/NICE criteria for ME/CFS.
However, data on the success of these therapies is contaminated
by the inclusion of significant numbers of false-positive cases.
This concern might be evidenced in data from the ALSPAC
studies that show that only 11% of teens identified as possible
ME/CFS cases continued to have a problem with chronic
disabling fatigue over two time points: 85.25% (6 months fatigue)
between the ages of 13–16 years recovered and 79.80% (6
months fatigue) between the ages of 16–18 years recovered
(CMRC Conference Presentation on ALSPAC recovery rates
2014). Essentially, 8 out of every 10 teens identified as possible
CFS cases recovered by age 18 (or were wrongly classified as CFS).
A current large clinical trial (FITNET) of internet-based CBT
and tele-support with activity management for teenagers (age 11–
17 years) with ME/CFS uses broad (Oxford/NICE) criteria to
select participants (40). A major justification used by the trial
team is that teenagers have a 63% chance of recovery using
FITNET vs. just 8% chance using standard medical care (40).
This data is taken from a pediatric CBT trial of FITNET in the
Netherlands (41). The Dutch trial has been criticized for over-
stating benefits via post-hoc selection of recovery measures and
for including young patients with general fatigue issues (42).
Interestingly, at long-term follow up in the Dutch FITNET study
(2 years+), recovery stood at 64% for CBT-GET participants, but
52.8% for usual care participants (43). Remarkably, teenagers in
the standard care group (which is often nothing more than usual
general practice care) improved over time, with relatively little
difference between the CBT cohort and the de facto no-treatment
control. This same phenomenon is visible in adult CBT trials,
with the gap closing between the intervention and standard care
in the PACE trial (44) and FINE trial (45). What we can take
from this observation is that CBT or exercise therapy perform
little better than no care over the longer term. There are other
reasons some trials show modest benefits over the short-term,
such as selection of milder cases and strong treatment promotion
effects (18, 46). Taking this into consideration, in addition to
noting high rates of natural recovery in children and adolescents,
the case for early intervention with psycho-behavioral therapy is
rather weak. Good quality primary care support should always
be available. For more severe cases, treatment in specialist
secondary care should be available also. This care should include
symptomatic support, advice on nutrition, sleep support, pain
control, infection control, allergies, and mental health issues (35).
There is no evidence to support GET for severe ME/CFS cases
(clinical trials do not include severe homebound sufferers). Very

Diagnosis of Pediatric ME/CFS
little is known about patients with severe ME/CFS. They are often
housebound, bedbound and are rarely studied. Overall, much
more research is needed around all aspects of pediatric ME/CFS.
CONCLUSION
There is a clear need for robust prevalence estimates of childhood
and adolescent ME/CFS to guide clinical practice and inform
health care decision-making. The wide range of prevalence
rates observed in the literature is concerning. This range
reflects a lack of agreement about the diagnostic criteria used
to identify pediatric cases and a lack of consistency in the
methods used to collect data. Broad diagnostic criteria, such
as the Oxford Criteria, result in inflated prevalence rates and
fail to adequately distinguish true-positive cases from non-cases.
Psychological and behavioral therapies continue to be tested
on young patients with ME/CFS, but if children or teens are
wrongly labeled as having ME/CFS and enrolled in trials of
CBT or exercise therapy, findings from these studies are likely
to be misleading and erroneous. Researchers need to agree on
sampling strategies to identify true pediatric cases of ME/CFS and
clinicians need to use a comprehensive triangulation approach
to diagnose children and teenagers with ME/CFS, while carefully
excluding young patients with health problems that mimic the
illness.
