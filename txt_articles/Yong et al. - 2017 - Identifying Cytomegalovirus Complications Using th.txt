Background. A simple test to identify recovery of CMV-specific T-cell immunity following hematopoietic stem cell transplan-
tation (HSCT) could assist clinicians in managing CMV-related complications.
Methods. In an observational, multicenter, prospective study of 94 HSCT recipients we evaluated CMV-specific T-cell immu-
nity at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after transplant using the Quantiferon-CMV, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay 
(ELISpot), and intracellular cytokine staining.
Results. At 3 months after HSCT, participants who developed CMV disease (n = 8) compared with CMV reactivation (n = 26) 
or spontaneous viral control (n = 25) had significantly lower CD8+ T-cell production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in response to CMV 
antigens measured by Quantiferon-CMV (P = .0008). An indeterminate Quantiferon-CMV result had a positive predictive value of 
83% and a negative predictive value of 98% for identifying participants at risk of further CMV reactivation. Participants experiencing 
CMV reactivation compared with patients without CMV reactivation had a reduced proportion of polyfunctional (IFN-γ+/tumor 
necrosis factor α–positive) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a higher proportion of interleukin 2–secreting cells (P = .01 and P = .002, 
respectively).
Conclusions. Quantifying CMV-specific T-cell immunity after HSCT can identify participants at increased risk of clinically 
relevant CMV-related outcomes.

Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has long been regarded as 
an important opportunistic pathogen in recipients of hema-
topoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [1, 2]. Individuals 
who lack CMV immunity and/or endure prolonged peri-
ods of immunosuppression are particularly susceptible [1]. 
Cytomegalovirus complications can range from asymptomatic 
spontaneously resolving low-level CMV viremia to CMV-
related death. The associated morbidity and mortality of CMV 
reactivation and disease in HSCT are highly significant, with 
recipients at an increased risk of early death [3]. Furthermore, 
CMV recurrences frequently occur, and it can be difficult to 
predict which individuals will need prolonged surveillance [4].
Current preemptive and prophylactic treatment strategies for 
CMV have been successful in reducing overall rates of CMV 
disease [5, 6]. However, both strategies have clinical limitations 
and primarily rely on detection of CMV DNA or virus. Based 
on regular monitoring of CMV DNA to detect early replicat-
ing virus before anti-CMV treatment, the preemptive strategy 
is often limited by a delay in obtaining results and commencing 
treatment [7]. Furthermore, not all end-organ disease is pre-
ceded by CMV DNA in plasma [8]. Alternatively, CMV disease 
can be prevented by initiating universal prophylaxis, whereby 
all individuals at risk of disease are given anti-CMV drugs from 
the time of engraftment [9]. However, current anti-CMV drugs 
are associated with significant bone marrow toxicity [10], uni-
versal prophylaxis has not been shown to improve survival[5], 
and many participants are treated unnecessarily [11]. Overall, 
neither strategy assesses an individual’s immune response to 
better identify individuals at highest risk.
A simple test to identify recovery of CMV-specific T-cell 
immunity after HSCT could assist clinicians in managing 
CMV-related complications such as reactivation or disease [12]. 
Control of CMV viral replication is highly dependent on an

 CMV-Specific T-Cell Immunity After HSCT • JID 2017:215 (1 June) • 1685
intact cellular immune response, in particular on CMV-specific 
cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes [13, 14]. Current assays used to 
measure CMV-specific T-cell immunity include enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot), flow cytometry with 
intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), tetramer staining, and 
more recently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) 
such as Quantiferon-CMV testing[12]. With the exception of 
Quantiferon-CMV, the other techniques require specialized 
personnel and equipment, are time consuming, and are often 
not available in a routine diagnostic laboratory [15].
Here we assessed CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity using 
the rapid high-throughput Quantiferon-CMV assay and com-
pared these results with the traditional CMV ELISpot to char-
acterize the kinetics of CMV-specific immunity after HSCT to 
determine the relationship of CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell immu-
nity to clinical outcome. We further assessed polyfunctional 
T-cell profiles using ICS in a subset of participants. We found 
that the Quantiferon-CMV assay identified individuals after 
HSCT at high risk of CMV-related complications and therefore 
could potentially be incorporated into clinical care.
METHODS
Study Participants
Eligible participants who were at risk of CMV disease and 
undergoing allogeneic HSCT were recruited from the Alfred 
Hospital and the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, 
Australia, between February 2011 and May 2013. The study 
was approved by the human research ethics committees of the 
Alfred (339/10), Melbourne Health (MH2010.290), and Monash 
University (CF11/0238-2011000078). Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants. Low-risk participants 
(CMV donor-negative [D−]/recipient-negative [R−]) were 
excluded. Blood was collected before transplantation (baseline) 
and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after HSCT.
Two different CMV prophylactic strategies were used 
whereby at 1 site all participants were managed with a pre-
emptive CMV approach, undergoing weekly plasma CMV 
DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for 100 days 
or longer if graft-versus-host disease was present. Anti-CMV 
drugs were commenced once a clinically significant viral 
threshold (usually >1000 IU/mL) was reached. Participants at 
the other site were either given universal prophylaxis (ganci-
clovir 5mg/kg intravenously 3×/week until day 100) or pre-
emptive CMV prophylaxis at the discretion of the treating 
clinician.
Cytomegalovirus Clinical Outcomes
Cytomegalovirus disease was confirmed by biopsy with histo-
logical evidence of viral cytopathic changes or positive immu-
nohistochemistry [16]. Cytomegalovirus reactivation was 
defined as detection of CMV DNA in plasma by PCR ≥546 
IU/mL (the lower limit of detection was 136 IU/mL; COBAS 
AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman CMV test, Roche), and treated 
CMV reactivation included participants who received anti-
CMV therapy. Spontaneous viral control was defined as the 
resolution of any level of CMV DNA in plasma without anti-
viral therapy.
QuantiFERON-CMV Assay
The QuantiFERON-CMV assay (Qiagen) is an in vitro diag-
nostic test providing both qualitative (reactive, nonreactive, 
indeterminate) and quantitative (concentration of interferon 
γ [IFN-γ] in international units per milliliter) results using 
human leucocyte antigen-restricted CMV epitopes and there-
fore only quantifies CD8+ CMV-specific T cells [17].
As described previously [17], this assay consists of 3 1-mL 
QuantiFERON-CMV blood tubes, each containing 1 of CMV 
peptide antigens, a positive mitogen control of phytohemag-
glutinin, or no antigens (negative control). The CMV peptide 
pool contains 22 peptides derived from epitopes of the major 
CMV proteins (pp65 and IE-1) and other less-common CMV 
proteins (pp50, gB, pp28, and IE-2) [17].
The assay was processed in accordance with the manufactur-
er’s instructions. In brief, after whole-blood collection, the tubes 
were incubated at 37oC for 16–24 hours before the supernatants 
were harvested and analyzed for IFN-γ production by ELISA. 
A positive result was determined after subtracting the IFN-γ 
production from the negative control and was defined as an 
IFN-γ level ≥ 0.2 IU/mL.
Cytomegalovirus Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay
The synthetic CMV peptides used in the assay were of 
 
15 amino-acid length (overlapping by 10 amino acids) spanning 
the pp65 and IE-1 human CMV proteins [18]. The 110 pp65 
peptides were clustered in 11 pools, and the 96 IE-1 peptides 
were clustered in 10 pools [18]. All of the pp65 and IE-1 pep-
tides used in the Quantiferon-CMV assay were also included 
in the CMV peptides used for the ELISpot assay. The ELISpot 
testing was performed using cryopreserved peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as previously described [18]. In 
brief, 96-well plates were coated with 100 µL of human mono-
clonal anti–IFN-γ immunoglobulin (Eurobio). Dispensed into 
each well were 1 × 105 cells together with the CMV overlap-
ping synthetic peptide pools, plus a negative and positive con-
trol (phytohemagglutinin). Spot-forming cells (SFCs) were read 
using an ELISpot reader (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH). 
The ELISpot results therefore include both CD4+ and CD8+ 
CMV-specific T cells.
Intracellular Cytokine Staining and Flow Cytometry
One million PBMCs were stimulated with the same synthetic 
CMV overlapping peptides used in the ELISpot assay as pre-
viously described [20], a negative control, or Staphylococcal 
enterotoxin B positive control. The pp65 and IE-1 CMV peptides 
covered in the ICS study were inclusive of the CMV peptides

used in the Quantiferon-CMV assay. Florescence-labeled con-
jugated antibodies for CD3-pacific blue, CD8-peridinin chlo-
rophyll protein, and CD4-fluorescein isothiocyanate were used, 
as well as anti-IFN-γ–Alexa700, interleukin 2 (IL-2)–allophy-
cocyanin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)–phycoerythrin 
Cy7, and CD40 ligand (CD40L)–phycoerythrin with surface 
and intracellular expression quantified using a FACS Canto II 
(Becton Dickinson) [20]. Data analysis was performed using 
Flow Jo Version 9.7.5 USA and SPICE version 5.3, downloaded 
from http://exon.niaid.nih.gov [21]. Both CMV-specific CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells were quantified.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables between 2 groups were compared using 
a χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. A Wilcoxon rank-
sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used where >3 or more 
groups of nonparametric continuous data were compared. A 
P value < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. The 
change in IFN-γ over time in each participant was modeled 
using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). Baseline was 
taken as the production of IFN-γ in response to CMV peptides 
at 3 months (after transplant), and this model considered both 
variation at baseline as well as change over time (3–12 months) 
as an interaction with each CMV group. Standard errors were 
calculated using the robust Huber-White sandwich estimator. 
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.1 (StataCorp 
LP) and GraphPad Prism v6.
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
In total, 96 individuals were enrolled with 94 participants com-
pleting the study (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics are shown 
in Table 1.
Cytomegalovirus Clinical Outcomes
Sixty-three (67%) study participants experienced post-HSCT 
detectable CMV with only baseline CMV D−/R+ serostatus 
compared with CMV D+/R+ being an independent protective 
risk factor for viremia (multivariate odds ratio [OR] = 0.04; 
95% CI = .01–.18; P < .0001) (Table 1). Acute graft-versus-host 
disease was not a risk factor in either univariate or multivar-
iate analysis for any CMV reactivation in this study. Of the 
participants with detectable viremia, 26 experienced CMV 
reactivation, 25 had spontaneous CMV viral clearance, and 8 
had CMV disease (n = 7 gastrointestinal, n = 1 pneumonitis) 
(Figure 1). The median times to first CMV reactivation and 
CMV disease were 48 (interquartile range [IQR] =38–62) days 
and 65 (IQR = 64–176) days after HSCT, respectively. A fur-
ther 7 (7.4%) participants had a second defined episode of 
CMV reactivation with a minimum of 3 weeks of undetectable 
CMV by PCR and a median time to second reactivation of 185 
(IQR = 97–269) days. Eighty-eight percent of all CMV clinical 
outcomes occurred in 42 study participants and before the first 
study time point. At baseline, before the transplant, no partic-
ipant had detectable plasma CMV DNA. No participant who

had spontaneously controlled virus experienced a second CMV 
reactivation, whereas 5 of 8 (62.5%) and 2 of 26 (7.7%) partic-
ipants with CMV disease and CMV reactivation, respectively, 
had a second episode of CMV reactivation (P < .0001). Late 
CMV disease occurred in 3 participants, all with CMV colitis 
with a median time to diagnosis of 191 (range = 176–540) days.
The all-cause mortality rate at 12 months was 24.5%. There 
was a trend toward a lower 12-month survival in those with 
CMV disease compared with those without CMV disease 
(Kaplan-Meier survival = 41.7% vs 73.7%; P = .09). No differ-
ence was seen in 12-month survival between different baseline 
CMV sero-groups (P = .50).
Quantiferon-CMV and Cytomegalovirus Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent 
Spot Assay
Three hundred two Quantiferon-CMV assays were assessed 
(median = 3; range = 1–5 per participant). The sensitivity and 
specificity of the Quantiferon-CMV assay relative to CMV serol-
ogy before HSCT were 74% and 100%, respectively. Reducing 
the lower cut-off of IFN-γ in the Quantiferon-CMV assay to 
 
0.1 IU/mL improved the sensitivity to 86% without affecting 
specificity (100%). Thus, all further analysis of Quantiferon-
CMV assay results used this lower cut-off level.
Two hundred nineteen CMV ELISpot assays measuring total 
CMV-specific T cells were performed. The sensitivity and spec-
ificity of the CMV ELISpot relative to pre-HSCT CMV serol-
ogy were 98% and 44%, respectively. The Pearson correlation 
between the Quantiferon-CMV and the CMV ELISpot was 0.66 
(P < .0001). The sensitivity and specificity of the Quantiferon-
CMV assay relative to the CMV ELISpot were 87% and 85%, 
respectively, with a positive predictive value of 99% and a nega-
tive predictive value of 66%.
Before HSCT, there was no difference in the magnitude of 
IFN-γ production measured by the Quantiferon-CMV test 
between participants who subsequently developed CMV dis-
ease, CMV reactivation, or spontaneous viral control (P = .24). 
Qualitative Quantiferon-CMV results before HSCT were not 
associated with subsequent CMV reactivation (P = .16) or 
CMV disease (P = .30). We also did not observe any association 
with pretransplant CMV ELISpot pp65-specific and IE-specific 
responses and subsequent CMV outcomes (Kruskal–Wallis 
P = .90 and P = .20, respectively).
At 3 months after HSCT, participants who developed 
CMV disease compared with those with CMV reactivation 
or spontaneous viral control had a significantly lower mag-
nitude of IFN-γ production in the Quantiferon-CMV assay 
(median IFN-γ = 0.04 vs 0.23 vs 1.86 IU/mL, respectively; 
Kruskal–Wallis P = .0008) (Figure 2A). We also assessed IFN-γ 
 
responses in individuals with CMV disease, plasma CMV DNA 
≥ 546 IU/mL or plasma CMV DNA ≥ 136 IU/mL as any reac-
tivation and observed a median IFN-γ of 0.04 versus 0.38 ver-
sus 1.32 IU/mL, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis P = .006). Because 
CMV D+/R− recipients are at a lower risk of CMV reactivation, 
we also analyzed the data excluding this group (n = 20), with 
results of CMV disease versus CMV reactivation and sponta-
neous viral control being a median IFN-γ level of 0.04 versus 
 
0.2 versus 1.5 IU/mL (Kruskal–Wallis P = .003).
Similar results were observed at 3 months using the CMV 
ELISpot assay, whereby participants with CMV disease com-
pared with those with CMV reactivation or spontaneous viral 
control had significantly lower ELISpot IFN-γ (median = 198 
vs 1670 vs 2513 SFC/106 cells; Krukal-Wallis test P = .002) 
(Figure 2B). When we analyzed the pp65-specific and IE-specific 
responses separately, the response to pp65 was associated with 
CMV outcome (Kruskal-Wallis P = .01) but not in response to 
IE (Kruskal-Wallis P = .15).
In a longitudinal assessment, the Quantiferon-CMV IFN-γ 
responses were significantly different among all 3 clinical groups 
(Figure 3A). Compared with participants with spontaneous 
viral control, participants with CMV reactivation and CMV 
disease had significantly higher rates of CMV immune recovery 
between 3 and 12 months as measured by Quantiferon-CMV 
(GEE estimated coefficient of 0.17 and. 0.30; P = .04 and P = .03, 
respectively) but not when using the ELISpot assay (GEE esti-
mated coefficient of 0.02 and 0.07; P = .5 and P = .3, respec-
tively) (Figure 3B). We also found differences in CMV immune 
reconstitution using the Quantiferon-CMV assay according 
to CMV baseline serogroup whereby CMV D−/R+ and CMV 
D+/R− recipients showed an increase and small decrease, 
respectively, in rates of recovery compared with CMV D+/R+

 CMV-Specific T-Cell Immunity After HSCT • JID 2017:215 (1 June) • 1689
recipients (GEE estimated coefficient of 0.22 and −0.01; P = .03 
and P = .006, respectively) (Figure 3C). There was no significant 
difference in immune responses by either Quantiferon-CMV 
or CMV ELIspot between participants who received preemp-
tive monitoring and those who received universal prophylaxis. 
(P = .20 and P = .90, respectively).
The qualitative results of the Quantiferon-CMV assay at 
3 months were found to be significantly associated with CMV 
clinical outcomes (Figure 4A), and the transplant factors associ-
ated with test outcomes included baseline CMV donor/recipient 
serostatus (P < .0001), graft source (P = .02), and unrelated grafts 
(P = .04) (Supplementary Table 1). In participants with a reac-
tive, nonreactive, or indeterminate Quantiferon-CMV result, 
spontaneous viral clearance was observed in 49%, 0%, and 10% 
of participants, respectively (P < .001). Cytomegalovirus disease 
was only observed in participants with an indeterminate result 
at 3 months (P < .0001). An indeterminate Quantiferon-CMV 
result at 3 months had a positive predictive value of 83% and 
a negative predictive value of 98% for identifying participants 
at risk of further CMV reactivation. A positive Quantiferon-
CMV response at 3 months was 89% predictive of future posi-
tive responses. Thirty-two of 36 participants who had positive 
responses at 3 months continued to have positive responses at 6, 
9, and 12 months, where data were available. Of the remaining 
participants (n = 4), none had CMV-related complications at 6, 
9, or 12 months.
We next evaluated the association between CMV DNA in 
plasma and the Quantiferon-CMV assay. Participants with 
a reactive compared with a nonreactive or indeterminate 
Quantiferon-CMV result at 3 months after HSCT had a sig-
nificantly lower peak CMV DNA in plasma (median viral 
load = 546 vs 4543 vs 4076 IU/mL, respectively; P = .003) 
(Figure 4B). There was a significant delay in the time to devel-
opment of CMV-specific immunity (defined as CMV IFN-γ ≥  
0.1 IU/mL) in participants with CMV disease compared with 
CMV reactivation and spontaneous control (median time = 276 
vs 116 vs 97 days; cumulative incidence function with compet-
ing-risks regression P < .0001) (Figure 5).
Flow Cytometry and Intracellular Cytokine Staining
In a subset of participants (n = 10; demographic details in 
Supplementary Table 2) we assessed the breadth and speci-
ficity of the CMV-specific response using ICS in participants 
with CMV reactivation (n = 5) and without CMV reactivation 
(n = 5) (Figure 6). Before HSCT, the most frequently pro-
duced cytokine from CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
was IFN-γ with no significant difference in the frequency of 
 
IFN-γ–positive cells between participants with and without 
CMV reactivation (P = .18). At 3 months after HSCT, the pro-
portion of dual-functional (IFN-γ+/TNFα+) CMV-specific 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was reduced in those who developed 
CMV reactivation (P = .02) (Figure 6B). At 6 months after 
HSCT, the proportion of dual-functional (IFN-γ+/TNFα+) 
CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells remained lower in the 
group with CMV reactivation, and the profile of cytokine 
production in cells that produced a single cytokine was sig-
nificantly different (P = .0008) (Figure 6C). Participants expe-
riencing CMV reactivation had a much higher proportion of 
CD4+ and CD8+ IL-2–secreting T cells compared with partic-
ipants without CMV reactivation, who had a higher propor-
tion of CD4+ and CD8v TNFα+ or IFN-γ–secreting T cells 
(P = .0008). Similar findings were observed at month 6 after 
HSCT when CMV-specific CD4+ T cells (P = .02) and CMV-
specific CD8+ T cells (P = .05) were analyzed separately (see 
Supplementary Figures 3C and 4C).

DISCUSSION
In this prospective study of recipients of allogeneic HSCT, the 
Quantiferon-CMV assay, which measures CMV-specific CD8+ 
T cells using a high-throughput format, was able to distinguish 
between CMV-related clinical outcomes, including CMV-
related clinical recurrences. Cytomegalovirus-specific CD8+ T 
cells, measured by the Quantiferon-CMV assay or by ELISpot 
measured at 3 months and longitudinally over time were able 
to clearly distinguish CMV disease, CMV reactivation, or spon-
taneous CMV viral control after HSCT. In addition, a reactive 
Quantiferon-CMV result was associated with spontaneous viral 
clearance and a lower peak CMV DNA level, whereas an inde-
terminate result identified participants at further risk of CMV 
reactivation. Finally, the quality of the CMV-specific CD4+ 
and CD8+ T-cell response differed between participants with 
and without CMV reactivation with regard to the number and 
cytokine profile detected. The Quantiferon-CMV assay has the 
potential to be incorporated into current clinical practice and 
could be of high clinical utility.
This is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the 
Quantiferon-CMV assay longitudinally in the largest cohort to 
date after HSCT. Tey et al studied 41 recipients of allogeneic 
HSCT in the early post-transplant period with much more 
frequent monitoring of the Quantiferon-CMV assay [22]. 
Consistent with our findings, the authors observed that a posi-
tive Quantiferon-CMV assay was associated with a significantly 
lower peak CMV DNA in blood [22]. This suggests that recov-
ery of an adequate CMV-specific T-cell response is essential for 
controlling CMV virus [23]. However, the study also showed 
variable Quantiferon-CMV results when the test was performed 
early post-transplant, suggesting that frequent monitoring early 
after HSCT may not have much additive clinical utility [22]. 
Fleming et al found that the Quantiferon-CMV assay correlated 
well with ICS studies but were unable to identify a significant

association between these assays and specific CMV clinical out-
comes [24]. Similarly Bono et al describe immune monitoring 
with the Quantiferon-CMV assay in 22 HSCT recipients but 
without clear association with clinical outcomes [25]. Other 
studies assessing the clinical use of the Quantiferon-CMV assay 
have largely been in the solid-organ transplant setting [26–29]. 
We note that 9% of all participants in this cohort developed 
CMV disease, likely driven by a rate of CMV disease of 50% 
seen in individuals who received umbilical cord transplants.
In addition to immune monitoring with a single cytokine 
IFN-γ, we studied the breadth and cytokine profile of the 
CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response in participants 
with and without CMV reactivation. Participants who did not 
experience CMV reactivation were more likely to have dual 
functional T cells (IFN-γ+/TNF-α+), which is consistent with 
other studies showing that polyfunctional antigen-specific T 
cells are better able to control virus and prevent disease pro-
gression [30–33]. The specificity of these polyfunctional CMV-
specific T cells can vary, with Krol et al finding that IFN-γ+/IL2+ 
CD8+ T cells were associated with better CMV viral control after 
HSCT in children [34]. However, in healthy control subjects, 
cells stimulated with CMV antigen predominantly expressed 
dual IFN-γ+/TNFα+ cytokines [35]. It is thought that cytokines 
other than IFN-γ are important to enable and enhance effective 
cytotoxic effect on virus [31]. Although the Quantiferon-CMV 
assay only measured a single cytokine IFN-γ, our results were 
concordant with the estimates of polyfunctional CMV-specific 
T-cell responses when determined by ICS [36].
This study contributes to the growing body of literature in 
support of CMV immune monitoring [4, 22, 37, 38]. Most 
recently, Navarro et al determined that use of immunolog-
ical monitoring shortened the length of antiviral treatment 
and reduced the incidence of recurrent CMV viremia [4]. 
Avetisyan et al also demonstrated in small numbers that par-
ticipants with CMV-specific immune recovery could have 
antiviral therapy delayed without development of CMV dis-
ease [38]. These studies measured CMV-specific immunity 
using intracellular IFN-γ production by flow cytometry and/
or CMV ELISpot [4, 38]. Both these techniques, as well as 
tetramer staining, require isolation of PBMCs using specialized

equipment, are time consuming to perform, and are not stan-
dardized [12]. In contrast, the Quantiferon-CMV assay that we 
used in this study provides an in vitro functional assessment of 
CMV-specific CD8+ T cells, which can be performed in most 
diagnostic pathology laboratories [39]. Use of whole blood in 
this assay also has the advantage of more accurately reflecting 
physiological cell conditions in vivo, particularly with regard 
to the presence of functional dendritic cells required in antigen 
presentation. The process of cryopreserving PBMCs for assays 
such as ELISpot significantly reduces dendritic cell function, 
potentially affecting results.
Although this was a prospective longitudinal study, there were 
several limitations in this study. First, we elected to collect blood 
at 3 months after transplantation by which time most participants 
had already experienced viremia. Second, the Quantiferon-
CMV assay includes peptides that are MHC class I restricted 
and thus does not stimulate CD4+ T cells, which have also 
been found to be important in CMV viral control [40, 41].

Finally, the study also did not measure CD4+/CD8+ T-cell sub-
sets, which would have provided additional data on immune 
reconstitution.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that the frequency of CMV-
specific CD8+ T cells as measured by the Quantiferon-CMV 
assay after an allogeneic HSCT is highly associated with 
 
CMV clinical outcomes. We evaluated several methods for detect-
ing CMV-specific T cells with the Quantiferon-CMV assay hav-
ing the additional benefit of being a simple and high-throughput 
 
assay that can be performed in most routine diagnostic labora-
tories. Further large randomized controlled trials of monitoring 
CMV-specific T cells in addition to CMV viremia to determine 
the optimal CMV prophylaxis strategies are indicated.
