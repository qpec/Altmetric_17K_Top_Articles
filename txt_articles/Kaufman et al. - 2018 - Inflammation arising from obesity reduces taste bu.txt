Abstract
Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be rescued with
weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the molecular effects of obesity on
the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting
an average life span of only a few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and
cell death. Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We
demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number
of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen
in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.
Author summary
Taste buds operate not only as sensors of essential nutrients but can also trigger powerful
central reward from the consumption of hedonically pleasing food. Obese individuals
have been reported to display a weakened sense of taste and thus may be driven to con-
sume more calories to attain such reward. Here, we have analyzed the effects of obesity on
taste buds and demonstrate that mice consuming a high-fat diet quickly become obese
and display a pronounced loss of taste buds when compared to littermates sustained on a
healthy diet. When the inflammatory response is impeded via genetic manipulation, we
observe that mice no longer suffer taste loss, suggesting that taste dysfunction in obesity is
a result of systemic inflammation. We also find that obesity-resistant mice consuming the
same unhealthy diet have no change in the taste bud abundance, confirming that taste loss
is a metabolic consequence of the obese state rather than a response to oral exposure to
fat. Our results validate a role for taste in the genesis of obesity and suggest a novel direc-
tion in the treatment of obesity.
Introduction
Obesity is one of the world’s most prevalent public health issues, affecting over one-third of
United States citizens [1] and is associated with increased mortality, along with various comor-
bidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer [2]. The treatment of

 obesity presents major challenges, including poor adherence to diets, with high rates of attri-
tion [3]. Despite many studies outlining the effects of obesity, people continue to eat unhealthy
diets. Various studies have investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and
taste perception with differing results. Earlier reports suggest little to no effect of BMI on taste
sensitivity [4,5]. These studies tested detection thresholds for sweet stimuli in obese and nor-
mal-weight humans but failed to take into account individual variation in the perception of
suprathreshold stimuli. With the invention of the generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale
(gLMS), intensity ratings could be compared better across groups by anchoring the upper end
of intensity scales to the “strongest imaginable sensation of any kind,” rather than strongest
taste sensation, thus negating bias from the obese fundamentally perceiving taste differently
[6]. Use of the gLMS revealed a negative association between BMI and perceived intensity of
sweetness, umami, saltiness, and fatty taste [7–10]. This relationship, however, remains com-
plex and methodology dependent, with not all studies in agreement and some studies finding
an opposing relationship to be true [11]. Researchers have also explored the association
between high BMI and decreased dopamine signaling from food intake, suggesting that the
obese and overweight seek out more palatable foods to compensate for depressed reward
[12,13]. Weight loss interventions, both gradual and acute (i.e., via bariatric surgery), have also
proven to alleviate obesity-related alterations in taste function, suggesting a bidirectional rela-
tionship between adiposity and taste. Gastric bypass surgery in both rodents and humans can
reestablish taste thresholds and reward signaling to levels seen in normal-weight controls, as
well as decrease the preference for, and intake of, calorie-rich foods [14–21]. Despite evidence
that taste is weakened in obesity, and rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have
investigated the molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Despite this, various groups
studying functional responses from taste buds of obese rodents have noted an altered response
to sweet and fat stimuli [22–24], often accompanied by a decreased behavioral response.
A taste bud consists of a heterogeneous collection of 50 to 100 cells belonging to three func-
tionally independent cell types. Type I cells are considered glial-like, provide structural support
for the taste bud, and are likely responsible for salty taste detection [25]. Type II cells express G-
protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) for sweet, bitter, or umami tastants and transduce taste sig-
nals via the phospholipase C beta 2 (PLCβ2)/phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2)/inositol
triphosphate (IP3) cascade [26–28]. Type III cells form synapses with afferent nerve fibers and
respond to sour taste [29,30]. Type II cells release ATP as their primary neurotransmitter [31,32],
while Type III cells accumulate and release serotonin and synthesize the inhibitory transmitter
gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) [33]. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover, even into
adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of about 10 days [34]. Recently, a population of lingual
stem cells has been identified that give rise to mature taste bud cells in the circumvallate papillae
[35]. These cells express the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein–coupled receptor 5 (LGR5),
which is also expressed by stem cells of the intestinal epithelium. LGR5 has been identified as a
receptor for R-spondins, which activate the Wnt signaling pathway [35,36]. Upon activation of
Wnt, these LGR5-expressing stem cells differentiate into immature sex-determining region Y
box 2 (SOX2+) cells and migrate into the taste bud, losing their LGR5 expression in the process.
SOX2 is required for the differentiation of endodermal progenitor cells of the tongue into mature
taste bud cells and represents one of the last steps before terminal differentiation [37].
There are a number of processes that affect the generation of new functional taste cells from
immature progenitor cells. Acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation has been
shown to inhibit proliferation of taste progenitor cells and reduce the number of newly born
cells entering taste buds. Furthermore, LPS-induced inflammation was shown to moderately
shorten the average lifespan of mature taste bud cells [38], alongside a notable immune response.
These experiments show the effects of inflammation in short-term, acute administration, a

 relatively rare occurrence. More common in human populations is the chronic and systemic
low-grade inflammation found in obesity, the effects of which are yet to be fully catalogued in
taste. While an acute immune response fundamentally differs from the sterile low-grade immune
activity observed with obesity, notable parallels still persist. Evidence indicates that a state of low-
grade chronic inflammation has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic
dysfunction [39,40]. With increased amounts of visceral adipose tissue, the production of proin-
flammatory cytokines—including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 6 (IL6), and C-C
motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)—is up-regulated in the obese, with the potential to act on
receptors within the taste bud, inducing cell death cascades [41,42]. TNFα in particular has been
well documented as a key mediator of obesity-related pathologies [39,40,43]. TNFα-null mice
have notably superior insulin sensitivity when obese through diet, with lower free–fatty acid lev-
els [44] and with triglycerides and leptin also reduced [45]. This study investigates the effects of
low-grade inflammation on the regenerative processes of taste buds in the obese state, demon-
strating a biological mechanism for taste dysfunction seen in human sensory studies of obese
populations.
Results and discussion
High-fat diet induces obesity and increases TNFα in taste
Obesity is associated with a number of comorbidities and pathologies, with many stemming
from the increase in circulating proinflammatory cytokines [39,40]. We split littermate 8-
week-old wild-type C57Bl/6 male mice, consuming either a standard chow or a high-fat diet
(HFD) for a period of 8 weeks (Fig 1A), into 2 cohorts. The HFD consisted of 58.4% fat to the
chow’s 14% (see Materials and methods for full details). Mice gained significantly more weight
when fed the HFD than those fed standard chow (Fig 1A and 1B), and postmortem analysis
showed that a large amount of weight gained by the HFD-fed mice was in the form of white
adipose tissue (Fig 1C and 1D).
We then tested whether HFD was sufficient to induce an inflammatory response associated
with increased adiposity. The expression of several inflammatory markers in circumvallate
papillae taste buds was examined. Acute induction of systemic inflammation via intraperito-
neal injection of LPS has previously been demonstrated to shorten the lifespan of adult taste
bud cells and reduce the population of supporting progenitor cells [38]. There are differences
in immune response evident between the results of this study and our own, due to this study
being concerned with an acute inflammatory response and not a low-grade persistent inflam-
matory response like in our study, where a differing immune response would be expected.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis
showed that, after only 8 weeks, expression of TNFα in taste tissues of HFD-fed mice was
significantly increased, compared to lean controls (Fig 1E), with only moderate variation in
interleukins at this time point. This was supported by concurrent altered expression of TNF
receptors 1 and 2. Although similar mRNA expression patterns were appreciated in nontaste
versus taste tissues for TNF receptors, minimal changes were observed for other markers (S1
Fig). These results suggest that prolonged obesity can induce a robust yet specific inflamma-
tory response in the taste epithelium, consistent with reports localizing components of the
inflammatory response to taste buds [42].
Fewer taste buds in obese mice
Correlations have previously been reported between taste bud density and perceived taste
intensity [46]. It is not clear whether human taste bud density changes longitudinally outside
of a decline with aging; however, those with more taste buds seem to perceive taste stimuli

 as more intense. Human taste function has also been noted to decline with weight gain in col-
lege-age males [47]. In order to examine taste deficiency with obesity, we first measured the
abundance of taste buds in obese mice compared to lean controls. Following the same dietary

 treatments described above, tissue sections containing circumvallate papillae were processed
for immunofluorescent staining using antibodies against potassium voltage-gated channel sub-
family Q member 1 (KCNQ1), a marker for taste bud cells [48]. Representative immunostain-
ing images from lean and obese mice are displayed in Fig 2A, with quantification of total taste
bud counts for whole circumvallate papillae revealing a significant reduction in taste bud
abundance in obese mice (Fig 2B). The abundance of taste buds in obese mice significantly
declined but with no difference in the size of taste buds evident between lean and obese cohorts
(Fig 2C). Parenthetically, no change in the balance between Type I, II, and III cells was
observed between chow- and HFD-fed mice (S1B Fig).
These data support the hypothesis that taste dysfunction in the obese may originate from a
fundamental change in gustatory morphology, arising from a reduction in taste bud abun-
dance. In addressing a mechanism, a rundown of taste cells might reasonably be ascribed to an
increase in apoptosis of taste cells. Apoptosis is classically assayed with TUNEL staining; how-
ever, TUNEL-positive cells tend to be very rare in taste buds, as observed in rats [49], in mice
[50,51], and in guinea pigs [52], with Nguyen et al. [53] recording less than 1% of cells in
healthy control mice taking on TUNEL labeling and Takeda et al. [50] noting that epithelial
cells took on TUNEL staining more readily than taste bud cells. In our testing (Fig 2D, 2E and
2F), TUNEL staining was significantly higher in CV papillae sections as a whole (p < 0.001), in
addition to being higher in taste cells (cells positive for both TUNEL and KCNQ1 staining,
p = 0.0457), although there were low overall numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in taste, in
agreement with observations from other groups [49–53].
Taste stem and progenitor cell loss in obesity
Studies suggest that taste bud cells, as well as surrounding nontaste epithelial cells, are derived
from a pool of multipotent progenitor cells that exist in the basal regions surrounding taste
buds [35,36,54,55]. To investigate whether diet-induced obesity suppresses proliferation of
taste bud progenitor cells, we performed immunostaining using antibodies against antigen KI-
67 (Ki67)—an important marker for actively proliferating cells in the lingual epithelium [38]
(Fig 2G)—highlighting cells located in the basal periphery of adult taste buds, considered a
niche for taste progenitor cells. Obese mice exhibited fewer cells immunoreactive for Ki67.
Sections were also stained for KCNQ1 to reveal the location of taste buds, with only Ki67-im-
munoreactive cells in contact with taste buds counted in quantification [38] (Fig 2H), also
revealing a decrement in the obese mice. A loss of input from taste buds would likely encour-
age overconsumption to compensate for this depressed input, as has been observed when
blocking input from sweet taste receptors in a human population, resulting in a drive for more
highly sweetened (and thus higher-calorie) stimuli [56].
Deletion of TNFα protects taste buds from detrimental effects of obesity
TNFα is linked with a number of negative outcomes related to obesity, including insulin resis-
tance [57] and the induction of further inflammation [58]. TNFα expression is highly up-regu-
lated in the taste tissues of obese wild-type mice, compared to lean controls (Fig 1E). In order
to determine if TNFα was necessary to cause the dysfunction in taste bud renewal that obese
mice exhibit, we employed the same dietary treatment previously described to 2 cohorts of
8-week-old B6.129S-Tnftm1Gkl/J male mice. These TNFα-null mice are marginally smaller in
size than wild-type mice at sexual maturity but gained a similar percentage of their body
weight on either diet when compared to wild-type mice (Fig 3A and 3B), suggesting that dele-
tion of TNFα did not impede adipogenesis resulting from HFD feeding.

 Immunostaining and taste bud counting from circumvallate papillae sections of lean and
obese TNFα-null mice did not reveal a reduction in taste bud abundance with obesity as that
seen in wild-type mice (Fig 3C and 3D), although the absolute number of taste buds was
slightly (though not significantly) smaller than C57s, likely a reflection of their smaller body
size. Taste bud area was also unaffected by diet in TNFα-null mice (Fig 3E).
Similar results were observed following immunostaining for Ki67 in TNFα-null mice.
Obese mice did not experience the reduction in Ki67+ taste progenitor cells demonstrated in
obese wild-type mice (Fig 3F and 3G). Similar to overall taste bud count, the number of Ki67+
cells per taste bud was slightly (although not significantly) higher in TNFα-null mice than con-
trols (Fig 3G), indicating no discernable damage to the proliferative capacity of taste buds in
obese mice lacking TNFα.
Extrinsic apoptosis can be powerfully triggered by TNFα. Directly injecting TNFα into the
tongues of healthy lean mice led to an increase in apoptosis in taste buds, with more than dou-
ble the number of cells expressing KCNQ1 positive for TUNEL staining after 1 week in TNFα-
injected mice compared to those injected with vehicle (Fig 3H). The absolute number of taste
buds in these mice did not change with this single TNFα dose (Fig 3I), likely reflective of the
acute, rather than chronic, TNFα exposure. To determine whether a reduction in taste buds,
proliferative capacity, or the inflammatory response itself stemmed from the adiposity of the
animals—or instead from the chronic oral exposure to a HFD—gene expression analysis and
immunostaining experiments were also performed in an obesity-resistant transgenic mouse
model. Adipocyte-specific deletion of Sel1L from mice results in inefficient metabolism of
fatty acids and significantly reduced adiposity when maintained on a HFD [59]. These animals
were subjected to the same dietary treatments as wild-type mice and ate a similar amount of
chow or HFD to wild-type mice but did not show an increase in expression of TNFα after 8
weeks. Furthermore, expression of taste bud machinery and markers of self-renewal were simi-
larly unaffected in these mice (S2 Fig). Representative images of circumvallate papillae from
chow- and HFD-fed Adipo-Sel1L knockout mice immunostained with antibodies against ecto-
nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2), PLCβ2, and serotonin (5-HT) to
reveal mature Type I, Type II, and Type III taste cells, respectively, also showed no difference
between dietary treatments, as with TNFα-null mice. This would imply that the metabolic
effects of obesity trigger a decline in taste and not merely the oral exposure to fat.
These data together suggest that gross adiposity stemming from chronic exposure to a HFD
is associated with a low-grade inflammatory response, causing a disruption in the homeostatic
mechanisms of taste bud maintenance and renewal. Inhibition of proinflammatory cascades,
whether by genetic deletion of TNFα or by resistance to adipogenesis, is sufficient to avert the
systematic loss of taste buds due to an obesogenic diet and may highlight novel therapeutic tar-
gets in the alleviation of taste dysfunction in obese populations.

 Animals
C57BL/6 and B6.129S-Tnftm1Gkl/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
ME). Adipocyte-specific Sel1L-/- (AKO) mice were a gift from Dr. Ling Qi of the University of
Michigan Medical School. Mice were housed in a climate-controlled environment at the East
Campus Research Facility at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Eight-week
old male mice were fed on either standard rodent diet consisting of 14% fat, 54% carbohydrate,
and 32% protein (Harlan Teklad 8604) or a HFD consisting of 58.4% fat, 26.6% carbohydrate,
and 15% protein (Harlan Teklad TD.03584) for a period of 8 weeks. Inguinal and epididymal
white adipose tissue deposits were excised and weighed post mortem.
qRT-PCR
Following dietary treatment, mice were euthanized, and tongues were incubated in ice-cold
normal Tyrode’s solution (NaCl 135 mM, KCl 5 mM, CaCl2 2 mM, MgCl 1 mM, NaHCO3 5
mM, HEPES 10 mM, Glucose 10 mM, Sodium Pyruvate 10 mM, pH 7.4). The excised tongue
was injected subepithelially with a mixture of Dispase II (2.5 mg/ml), Collagenase A (1 mg/
ml), Elastase (0.25 mg/ml), and DNaseI (0.5 mg/ml) in Tyrode’s solution and incubated at
room temperature for 20 minutes. Epithelial sections containing taste buds and nontaste epi-
thelial control tissues were collected [60] and total RNA extracted using Absolutely RNA
Microprep Kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Samples were reverse-transcribed into cDNA
using qScript cDNA Supermix (Quanta Bio, Beverly, MA) and diluted using standard curves.
qRT-PCR using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
was run on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo, Waltham, MA). Relative
quantification was performed using QuantStudio PCR Software, based on the 2-ΔΔCt method.
β-Actin was used as a housekeeping control gene. All genes were tested in triplicate, with sam-
ples sizes reflecting the number of animals tested.
Taste bud counting and size measurement
Mice were euthanized and tongues removed and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS solution. Tissues were
cryosectioned at 10 um thickness and washed in PBS. CV sections were incubated in blocking
buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 2% donkey serum) at room temperature
for 2 hours. The sections were then incubated in polyclonal goat antibody against KCNQ1 at
4˚C overnight. The sections were washed 3X in PBS and further incubated in AlexaFluor
647-conjugated donkey antigoat secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 hours. Sec-
tions were washed 3 times in PBS and mounted with ProLong Gold mounting medium con-
taining DAPI stain. Images were taken using an Olympus IX71 Inverted Fluorescent
Microscope. Taste buds were visualized with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and counted from
every fifth section to avoid double counting. To calculate taste bud size, the perimeter of the
largest taste bud (from every fifth section) was outlined, and the corresponding area was calcu-
lated with ImageJ.

´bec, #mN2-36I6, 1:500) at 4˚C overnight. The sections were washed 3 times in PBS and
further incubated in AlexaFluor 647-conjugated donkey antigoat secondary antibody at room
temperature for 2 hours. Sections were washed 3 times in PBS and mounted with Prolong
Gold medium containing DAPI stain. Images of every fifth section were taken using a Zeiss
LSM710 confocal microscope, with 1 taste bud per section selected with a random-number
generator, taste buds numbered in epithelia from left to right, and cells from each cell type
counted.
Ki67 immunostaining and cell counting
Mice were euthanized and tongues removed and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS solution. Tissues were
cryosectioned at 10 um thickness and washed in PBS. CV sections were washed in methanol
plus 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes and then rinsed 3 times in PBS. Sections were incu-
bated in blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 2% donkey serum)
for 2 hours and then further incubated overnight at 4˚C with antibodies against KCNQ1
(Santa Cruz #sc-10646, 1:1000) and Ki67 (Thermo Scientific #RM-9106-S1, 1:200). After wash-
ing 3 times with PBS, the sections were incubated with AlexaFluor 647-conjugated antigoat
secondary (for KCNQ1) and AlexaFluor 488-conjugated antirabbit secondary (for Ki67) at
room temperature for 2 hours. Sections were washed and mounted with ProLong Gold
mounting media. Images of every fifth section were taken with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal
microscope. Only Ki67-labeled cells immediately surrounding a taste bud (defined by the
KCNQ1 staining) were counted.
TNFα lingual injections
Healthy lean mice at weeks 15 to 16 were injected in the anterior tongue with 200 ng of mouse
TNFα in 10 uL of sterile PBS. Injections were with an insulin syringe and took place under iso-
fluorane. Mice were under anesthesia for under 5 minutes. Controls underwent the same pro-
cedure, injected with only 10 uL sterile PBS. Mice were monitored post injection and feeding
tracked for several days to ensure no change in intake. One week later, mice were euthanized
and taste tissues collected for sectioning as above.
TUNEL staining
Sections were sectioned at 10 um, as in staining protocols above. TUNEL staining used the
Promega DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL kit, with which cells were briefly permeabilized
using 5% Triton X-100 in PBS; washed in PBS; equilibrated in 100 μl eq. buffer at room tem-
perature for 10 minutes; labelled with TdT mix for 50 minutes at 37˚C shielded from light—
the reaction stopped with 2-time SSC (15 minutes)—washed 3 times in PBS/0.3% Triton/2%
BSA; and finally washed in PBS (5 minutes each). Slides were then blocked, and immunos-
tained, as above.
