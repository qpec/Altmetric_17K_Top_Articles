BACKGROUND: The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 
9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and 
cardiovascular events in the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes 
Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk). We investigated 
the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in patients with peripheral artery disease 
(PAD) as well as the effect on major adverse limb events.
METHODS: FOURIER was a randomized trial of evolocumab versus placebo in 
27 
564 patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy followed for a 
median of 2.2 years. Patients were identified as having PAD at baseline if they 
had intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index of <0.85, or if they had 
a prior peripheral vascular procedure. The primary end point was a composite 
of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for 
unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a 
composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. An additional 
outcome of interest was major adverse limb events defined as acute limb 
ischemia, major amputation, or urgent peripheral revascularization for ischemia.
RESULTS: Three thousand six hundred forty-two patients (13.2%) had PAD (1505 
with no prior myocardial infarction or stroke). Evolocumab significantly reduced 
the primary end point consistently in patients with PAD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66–0.94; P=0.0098) and without PAD (HR 0.86; 
95% CI, 0.80–0.93; P=0.0003; Pinteraction=0.40). For the key secondary end point, 
the HRs were 0.73 (0.59–0.91; P=0.0040) for those with PAD and 0.81 (0.73–0.90; 
P<0.0001) for those without PAD (Pinteraction=0.41). Because of their higher risk, 
patients with PAD had larger absolute risk reductions for the primary end point 
(3.5% with PAD, 1.6% without PAD) and the key secondary end point (3.5% with 
PAD, 1.4% without PAD). Evolocumab reduced the risk of major adverse limb 
events in all patients (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.88; P=0.0093) with consistent 
effects in those with and without known PAD. There was a consistent relationship 
between lower achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower risk of limb 
events (P=0.026 for the beta coefficient) that extended down to <10 mg/dL.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAD are at high risk of cardiovascular events, 
and PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab significantly reduced that risk with 
large absolute risk reductions. Moreover, lowering of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol with evolocumab reduced the risk of major adverse limb events.

T
he presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is 
a marker of a malignant vascular phenotype with 
event rates exceeding those of other stable popu-
lations with atherosclerosis, particularly in the setting of 
polyvascular disease.1–3 Thus, patients with symptom-
atic PAD are at heightened risk of major adverse car-
diovascular events (MACE) including myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, and cardiovascular death.4,5 In addition, it 
is important to note that patients with PAD experience 
significant morbidity from major adverse limb events 
(MALE) including acute limb ischemia, urgent periph-
eral revascularization, and major amputation.6–8
Although lipid-lowering therapy has been shown 
to reduce MACE in stable patients with coronary heart 
disease or atherosclerosis risk factors, there have been 
few well-powered prospective randomized trials of 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction 
specifically in patients with PAD.9 Moreover, these tri-
als have not specifically looked at the ability of LDL-C 
lowering to reduce the risk of MALE.6,10–13 Last, because 
PAD has often been used simply as a risk enhancer, little 
is known about the effect of LDL-C lowering in patients 
who have PAD without prior myocardial infarction (MI) 
or stroke.8,9,14,15
The FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes 
Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevat-
ed Risk) was a very large cardiovascular outcomes trial 
of the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 
type 9) inhibitor evolocumab that enrolled patients with 
atherosclerotic disease, in either the coronary, cerebro-
vascular, or peripheral arterial bed. FOURIER thus al-
lowed us to test the following hypotheses: (1) patients 
with PAD would be at greater risk of MACE relative to 
patients with coronary or cerebrovascular disease with-
out PAD; (2) consistent relative risk reductions in MACE 
with evolocumab would translate to larger absolute risk 
reductions in patients with PAD relative to those with-
out; and (3) LDL-C reduction with evolocumab would 
significantly reduce MALE with benefits extending to 
very low levels of LDL-C.
METHODS
Study Population
The FOURIER trial design has been previously described.16 
The study was approved by an institutional review committee 
and all subjects gave informed consent. Patients with clini-
cally evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including 
prior MI, prior ischemic stroke, or symptomatic PAD were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to evolocumab or placebo. 
Patients were eligible to qualify with symptomatic PAD if they 
had intermittent lower extremity claudication and an ankle 
brachial index <0.85, a history of a peripheral artery revascu-
larization procedure, or a history of amputation attributable 
to atherosclerotic disease. In addition to the prespecified sub-
group based on symptomatic lower extremity PAD, we also 
examined, as part of a post hoc exploratory analysis, a more 
restricted population defined as patients with symptomatic 
lower extremity PAD but with no history of MI or stroke.
End Points
The primary efficacy end point in FOURIER was major cardio-
vascular events, defined as the composite of cardiovascular 
death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or 
coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was 
the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, MI, or stroke. 
Other secondary end points included the components of the 
primary end point. Cardiovascular events were adjudicated 
by a blinded clinical event committee. Limb outcomes were 
prospectively ascertained through investigator reporting on 
dedicated electronic case report form pages and through 
adverse event forms. Limb outcomes were adjudicated by 2 
blinded vascular medicine specialists (Cohen κ for adjudicator 
agreement, 0.903). Similar to other recent trials evaluating 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to very 
low levels (median, 31 mg/dL) with evolocumab in 
patients with symptomatic lower extremity periph-
eral artery disease significantly reduces major 
adverse cardiovascular events.
• Evolocumab significantly reduced major adverse 
limb events with consistent relative reductions in 
patients with and without peripheral artery disease.
• These benefits come with no offsetting side effects.
• When looking at the composite of major adverse 
cardiovascular events/major adverse limb events in 
patients with symptomatic lower extremity periph-
eral artery disease and no prior myocardial infarc-
tion or stroke, evolocumab resulted in an absolute 
risk reduction at 2.5 years of 6.3% yielding a num-
ber needed to treat of 16.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• There are few therapies that have been proven to 
reduce major adverse cardiovascular events risk in 
patients with lower extremity peripheral artery dis-
ease, particularly those without concomitant myo-
cardial infarction or stroke, and even fewer that 
reduce major adverse limb events.
• Lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to 
very low levels reduces major adverse cardiovas-
cular events and major adverse limb events, with 
benefits of low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
extending to very low levels (<10 mg/dL) and with 
no offsetting safety concerns.
• These data support reducing low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol levels to very low targets should 
be a core focus of preventive therapy in patients 
with symptomatic lower extremity peripheral artery 
disease, including those without concomitant coro-
nary or cerebrovascular disease.

medical therapies in patients with PAD, MALE was defined as 
the composite of acute limb ischemia (ALI), major amputation 
(above the knee or below the knee, excluding forefoot or toe), 
or urgent revascularization (thrombolysis or urgent vascular 
intervention for ischemia).3,8,14,15,17 ALI required both a clini-
cal presentation consistent with acute ischemia (symptoms 
consistent with a rapid or sudden decrease in limb perfusion 
lasting <2 weeks) including findings on physical examination 
or imaging.17 In addition, all peripheral artery revasculariza-
tion and amputation procedures were recorded by the site in 
the electronic case report form. Analogous to other trials, a 
combined end point of MACE and MALE was examined.14,18 
Prespecified safety end points as defined in the primary analy-
sis were included for the PAD subgroup.19
Statistical Considerations
As part of a prespecified analysis, patients were stratified into 
those with or without symptomatic lower extremity PAD at 
baseline. Baseline characteristics of the subgroups were com-
pared by using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous data 
and χ2 tests for categorical data. All efficacy analyses of evo-
locumab versus placebo were done on an intention-to-treat 
basis (ie, all patients who were randomly assigned were ana-
lyzed, irrespective of study drug compliance). Safety analyses 
included all randomly assigned patients who received at least 
1 dose of study treatment and for whom postdose data were 
available. P values for time-to-event analyses are from log-
rank tests; Kaplan-Meier event rates were calculated up to 2.5 
years. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
for the effect of evolocumab versus placebo were generated 
by use of a Cox proportional hazards model, without adjust-
ment (because of the randomized design) but stratifying by 
region and screening LDL-C values. We tested effect modifi-
cation by PAD on the efficacy of evolocumab by incorporating 
interaction terms into Cox models. For the analysis of risk of 
cardiovascular outcomes comparing patients with and with-
out PAD in the placebo group, a multivariable-adjusted HR 
was obtained from a Cox model that included the following 
baseline covariates: age, sex, race, body mass index, hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, renal dysfunction, 
congestive heart failure, prior MI, coronary artery bypass 
grafting surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, and 
prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Proportional hazards 
assumptions were not violated. A repeated-measures linear 
mixed-effects model was used to obtain the least-squares 
means percentage and absolute reduction in LDL-C between 
the 2 treatment groups. For analyses evaluating the relation-
ship of achieved LDL-C at 1 month and outcomes, we plotted 
the relationship between end points and achieved LDL cho-
lesterol using a smoothing function applied to the averages 
of the estimated event rates at each LDL level based on the 
adjusted Cox models.  Analyses were adjusted for significant 
predictors of LDL-C cholesterol at 1 month after randomiza-
tion including age, BMI, LDL-C at baseline, sex, race random-
ized in North America, current smoker, and high intensity 
statin.20 P values <0.05 were regarded as significant. We used 
SAS (version 9.4) for the statistical analyses. The data and 
study materials will not be made available to other research-
ers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the 
procedure at this time; however, the entire FOURIER clinical 
database has been made available to the US Food and Drug 
Administration for review and validation.
RESULTS
Populations
Of the 27 
564 patients randomized, 3642 (13.2%) had 
a history of symptomatic lower extremity PAD at base-
line (Figure 1). A total of 2067 patients (56.8%) had a 
history of prior peripheral revascularization, 126 (3.5%) 
had a history of amputation for vascular cause, and 
2518 (69.3%) had an ankle brachial index <0.85 and 
symptoms of claudication (with some patients having 
>1 of these factors). Patients with PAD were older, were 
more frequently female, and had a greater prevalence 
of risk factors including hypertension, current smok-
ing, renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus (Table 1). 
At baseline, 89% of patients were taking antiplatelet 
therapy, 69% were taking high-intensity statin therapy, 
30% were taking moderate-intensity statin therapy, and 
6.6% were taking ezetimibe. Of the PAD subgroup, 
1812 patients (49.8%) had a history of MI and 545 
(15.0%) had a history of stroke; there were 1505 (41% 
of those with PAD and 5% of the total population) who 
had PAD and no prior MI or stroke.
Risk of Vascular Events in Patients With 
and Without PAD

rates of both the primary end point (Kaplan-Meier 
rate at 2.5 years: 16.8% versus 12.1%, P<0.001) and 
the key secondary end point (13.0% versus 7.6%, 
P<0.001) (Table I and Figure I in the online-only Data 
Supplement). After adjusting for baseline differences, 
patients with PAD remained at significantly higher risk 
of the primary end point (adjusted HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 
1.36–1.80; P<0.001) and the key secondary end point 
(adjusted HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.53–2.14; P<0.001; Table I 
 
and Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement).
When stratifying the population with PAD by history 
of concomitant prior MI or stroke (polyvascular disease), 
those with polyvascular disease had higher rates of CV 
death, MI, or stroke than those without (14.9% versus 
10.3%, P=0.0028; Figure II in the online-only Data Sup-
plement). Patients with PAD and no prior MI or stroke, 
however, still had higher rates of CV death, MI, or stroke 
than patients with prior MI or stroke and no symptom-
atic PAD (10.3% versus 7.6%; adjusted HR, 2.07; 95% 
CI, 1.42–3.01; P=0.0001; Figure II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). When evaluating the individual com-
ponents, CV death appeared especially higher (4.4% 
versus 1.7%, P=0.0029) in those with PAD and no prior 
MI or stroke versus patients with no PAD, although rates 
of MI and stroke were numerically higher as well (Figure 
IIIA in the online-only Data Supplement).
As expected, patients with symptomatic PAD had 
higher rates of limb outcomes relative to those without 
PAD including MALE (2.4% versus 0.2%; adjusted HR, 
11.67; 95% CI, 6.25–21.79; P<0.001) and the compos-
ite of ALI and major amputation (1.5% versus 0.1%; 
adjusted HR, 7.88; 95% CI, 3.67–16.92; P<0.001; 
Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Findings 
were consistent in the subgroup with PAD and no MI 
or stroke versus patients with no PAD (Figure IIIB in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
LDL-C Lowering With Evolocumab
The median LDL-C level at baseline among the symp-
tomatic PAD group was 94 mg/dL (interquartile range, 
81–112). At 48 weeks, the percentage reduction in 
LDL-C with evolocumab, relative to placebo, was 59% 
(least-squares mean percentage, 95% CI, 57–61; 
P<0.001) or a mean absolute reduction of 57 mg/dL 
(95% CI, 55–60), resulting in a median LDL-C of 31 mg/
dL (interquartile range, 19–49; Figure IV in the online-
only Data Supplement). The reduction in LDL-C levels 
was maintained over time (Figure IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Cardiovascular Efficacy With Evolocumab
In patients with PAD, evolocumab significantly reduced 
the primary end point by 21% (2.5-year Kaplan-Meier 
rate, 13.3% versus 16.8%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–
0.94; P=0.0098; Table 2, Figure 2A) and the composite 
of CV death, MI, or stroke by 27% (9.5% versus 13.0%; 
HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.91; P=0.0040; Table 2, Fig-

were consistent in patients with and without PAD 
(Pinteraction=0.40 and 0.41, respectively). However, because 
of the higher absolute risk in patients with PAD, the ab-
solute risk reductions [ARRs] for both end points were 
greater in those with PAD versus those without (ARR for 
the primary end point, 3.5% [95% CI, 0.8%–6.2%] in 
PAD; 1.6% [95% CI, 0.7%–2.5%] without PAD; ARR 
for CV death, MI, or stroke 3.5% [95% CI, 1.0%–6.0%] 
in PAD; 1.4% [95% CI, 0.7%–2.1%] without PAD). 
Relative and ARRs were consistent in the population of 
patients with PAD and no prior MI or stroke including 
a 4.9% ARR (95% CI, 1.0%–8.8%) in the primary end 
point and a 4.8% ARR (95% CI, 1.2%–8.4%) in the 
composite of CV death, MI, or stroke translating in a 
number needed to treat (NNT)2.5y of 21 for each (Table 2, 
Figure VA and VB in the online-only Data Supplement).
MALE Reduction With Evolocumab
Overall, evolocumab reduced the risk of MALE by 42% 
(0.27% versus 0.45%; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.88; 
P=0.0093; ARR, 0.18%; Table 3, Figure 3A) and the 
pattern of efficacy was consistent across all compo-
nents of MALE (Table 3). The reduction in MALE with 
evolocumab was consistent regardless of background 
statin intensity (Pinteraction=0.81) and remained significant 
even when restricted to the 19 
103 patients on high-
intensity statin therapy at baseline (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 
0.33–0.93; P=0.022).
The relative risk reduction in MALE with evolocum-
ab was also consistent in those with PAD (HR, 0.63; 
95% CI, 0.39–1.03) and those without PAD (HR, 0.37; 
95% CI, 0.16–0.88; Pinteraction=0.29; Figure 3B and 3C). 
Naturally, given the higher event rates in patients with 
known PAD, the ARRs were greater in those with PAD 
(1.5% versus 2.4%; ARR, 0.9%) than in those without 
(0.076% versus 0.16%; ARR, 0.08%). In the 1505 pa-
tients with PAD and no prior MI or stroke, reductions in 
MALE were consistent (1.3% versus 2.6%; HR, 0.43; 
95% CI, 0.19–0.99; ARR, 1.3%; Table 3, Figure VC in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
Composite Outcome of MACE and MALE 
in Patients With PAD
Overall, evolocumab reduced the composite of MACE 
(CV death, MI, or stroke) or MALE (ALI, major ampu-
tation, or urgent revascularization) by 21% (HR, 0.79; 
95% CI, 0.72–0.87; P<0.001; 6.9% versus 8.7%; ARR, 
1.8%; NNT, 56; Table 3). The relative risk reduction in 
MACE or MALE with evolocumab was consistent in 
those with PAD (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.88; 10.9% 
versus 15.0%; ARR, 4.1%; NNT, 25) and those with-
out PAD (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72–0.89; 6.3% versus 
7.8%; ARR, 1.5%; NNT, 67; Pinteraction=0.39, Figure 4). In 
the 1505 patients with PAD and no prior MI or stroke, 
reductions in the composite of MACE or MALE were 
consistent (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35–0.76; 6.5% versus 
12.8%; ARR, 6.3%; NNT, 16 (Table 3, Figure VI in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Safety of Evolocumab in Patients With 
PAD
There were no differences in the incidence of adverse 
or serious adverse events with evolocumab relative to 
placebo in patients with PAD (Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). There was no excess of adverse 
events leading to treatment discontinuation (1.3% evo-
locumab versus 1.5% placebo, P=0.57).
Association of Achieved LDL-C and Risk 
of MALE and MACE
Overall, lower achieved LDL-C was associated with a 
significantly lower risk of MALE with a roughly linear

relationship down to LDL-C of 10 mg/dL (P=0.026 
for the beta coefficient) with consistent patterns in 
patients with PAD and those with PAD and no prior 
MI or stroke (Figure 5, Figure VII in the online-only 
Data Supplement). There was no apparent inflection 
or plateau in the relationship between LDL-C and 
outcome. This pattern was consistent for the broader 
composite outcome of MACE or MALE overall and 
for patients with PAD (Figure VIII in the online-only 
Data Supplement) and patients with PAD and no 
prior MI or stroke (Figure IX in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
DISCUSSION
This study confirms that patients with symptomatic 
lower extremity PAD are at higher risk of both MACE 
and MALE relative to patients with prior MI or stroke 
and no PAD. Evolocumab significantly reduced the risk 
of MACE in patients with symptomatic PAD, including 
those without prior MI or stroke, and the higher risk in 
patients with PAD translated into greater ARRs. Further-
more, LDL-C lowering with evolocumab reduced the 
risk of MALE including ALI and major amputation. Thus, 
when considering both MACE and MALE, the ARR with 
LDL-C lowering in patients with PAD was quite robust, 
with an NNT for 2.5 years of only 25. Last, akin to what 
has been observed for MACE, there was a consistent 
lower risk of MALE with lower levels of achieved LDL-C, 
down to 10 mg/dL.
The higher ischemic risk in patients with symptom-
atic PAD in comparison with those without has been 
recognized.21,22 This observation, however, is complex 
because there is heterogeneity in risk within the broad 
population of patients with PAD. Those patients with 
multiple symptomatic territories (eg, PAD and prior 
MI or prior stroke), called polyvascular disease, are at 
clearly heightened risk and appear to derive robust re-
ductions in MACE risk from more intensive antithrom-
botic therapy.3,23,24 For patients with symptomatic PAD 
and no prior MI or stroke, there were fewer proven 
medical therapies.4,5,15,25 The current study builds on 
observations from the Heart Protection Study and ob-
servational analyses to demonstrate that intensive lipid 
lowering is beneficial in this population and has no off-
setting side effects such as bleeding with antithrom-
botic therapy.3,8,14,25
In the current study, we have examined 2 symptom-
atic PAD populations: a broad population including 
those with polyvascular disease, and a restricted popu-
lation with symptomatic lower extremity PAD who have 
never experienced an acute atherothrombotic event (MI 
or stroke). The benefits of intensive lipid lowering with 
evolocumab were consistent in both populations. These 
findings therefore highlight that patients with symp-
tomatic PAD as the primary manifestation of atheroscle-
rotic vascular disease enjoy robust benefits from lipid 
lowering and supports the hypothesis that the biology 
of MACE risk in this population is modifiable with LDL-C 
lowering.
There are limited prior randomized, controlled 
data on the effect of LDL-C lowering on clinical out-
comes in PAD. The Heart Protection Study randomly 
assigned 20 536 patients with vascular disease with a 
total cholesterol of at least 3.5 mmol/L (135 mg/dL) to 
simvastatin 40 mg daily or placebo and included 6748 
patients with PAD.26 Over 5 years of follow-up, simv-
astatin reduced major vascular events relative to pla-

cebo with consistent relative risk reductions in those 
with and without PAD.27 An exploratory outcome of 
noncoronary vascular intervention (including carotid 
intervention) was also lower with simvastatin.27 There 
was no difference in the risk of amputation with sim-
vastatin versus placebo. Observational analyses have 
reported associations between statin intensity and 
reductions in MACE in patients with stable PAD or 
those presenting with critical limb ischemia.28–30 Be-
yond these observations, there are no well-powered 
randomized studies showing that achieving lower 
LDL-C or that adding a nonstatin lipid-lowering agent 
to a statin is beneficial in PAD.9 The current study now 
adds additional data from a well-powered random-
ized trial that achieving lower LDL-C with a nonstatin 
agent added to high- or moderate-intensity statin 
therapy is beneficial in patients with symptomatic 
lower extremity PAD, including those without prior 
MI or stroke.9
In addition to robust benefits for MACE, the current 
study is the first randomized trial to demonstrate a ben-
efit for intensive LDL-C lowering for MALE risk. As not-
ed above, the Heart Protection Study noted a reduction 
in the outcome of noncoronary revascularization pro-
cedures; however, this was not specific to etiology and 
included procedures beyond the lower extremities such 
as carotid revascularization.27 MALE was not specifically 
reported and there was no difference in amputations.27. 
Prior small studies have described potential symptom-
atic benefits with statin therapy but have not been 
powered for MALE.10,11,31 A single study has reported a 
significant 36% reduction in amputations with 5 years 
of treatment with fenofibrate versus placebo in people 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mostly among individuals 
with PAD, prior amputation, or neuropathy, and likely 
via non–LDL-C–mediated mechanisms.32 Analyses from 
large registries have observed an association between 
lower amputation rates and statin therapy; however, 
the potential for residual confounding has remained 
and the intensity of statin therapy or achieved LDL-C 
was not reported.6,33,34 Smaller observational stud-
ies in patients with critical limb ischemia have shown 
mixed results for the association between statins in limb 
events with some showing no significant reduction in 
amputation and others showing improved limb salvage 
in patients presenting for endovascular therapy for criti-
cal limb ischemia.29,30,35
The current study demonstrates that nonstatin LDL-C 
lowering added to statins reduces MALE in patients with 
symptomatic atherosclerosis and that the benefits extend 
to very low achieved LDL-C. This benefit was statistically 
significant in the overall population with consistent effects 
in those with and without recognized lower extremity PAD. 
The benefit in those without known PAD reflects both the

heightened risk of PAD in patients with coronary or cere-
brovascular disease, as well as the underdiagnosis in popu-
lations where systematic screening is not conducted. These 
observations support ascertainment of MALE outcomes in 
trials of preventive therapies in broader populations with 
atherosclerosis and not only those with recognized PAD.
The reduction in MALE with evolocumab was consistent 
for all the components, which have now been established 
as modifiable limb end points in 3 randomized trials of 
more intensive antithrombotic therapy and end points that 
have been adopted as elements of primary or key second-
ary end points in trials including patients with PAD.3,8,14,15 
There was no apparent benefit for reducing peripheral re-
vascularizations including elective procedures for claudica-
tion as has been described for others such as vorapaxar.8 
Possible explanations for the lack of benefit for this broad 
end point include that lipid lowering does not improve 
symptoms or, alternatively, that it does but over a longer 
period of exposure and therefore was not seen in the rela-
tively short duration of follow-up (median, 2.2 years) in the 
current study. Supporting the latter explanation is the ob-
servation that benefits for peripheral revascularization and 
symptoms with vorapaxar were not apparent until almost 
2 years of exposure and were not significant until 3 years. 
Additional longer-term studies are necessary to determine 
whether long-term reduction in LDL-C will modify disease 
progression and ameliorate symptoms.
In evaluating the overall benefits of preventive thera-
pies in patients with PAD, recent and ongoing trials (VOY-
AGER PAD [Efficacy and Safety of Rivaroxaban in Reducing 
the Risk of Major Thrombotic Vascular Events in Subjects 
With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Undergoing 
Peripheral Revascularization Procedures of the Lower Ex-
tremities], ClinicalTrials.org; NCT02504216) have used a 
composite end point including both cardiovascular and 
limb outcomes.14 This composite provides a global picture 
of benefit against which harm and cost can be weighed.

an NNT of 25. Extending this observation to 5 years, as 
is typically done for lipid-lowering therapy, translates to a 
NNT of ≈13. Findings were consistent in patients with PAD 
and no prior MI or stroke where an ARR of 6.3% trans-
lated to a NNT of 16 at 2.5 years or 8 at 5 years. In con-
trast to antithrombotic therapies, this benefit comes with 
no safety trade-off in terms of bleeding or other adverse 
events. These considerations may be important to clini-
cians in personalizing intensive therapies to their patients.
Limitations
There are several limitations to the current analysis. First, 
subgroup analyses are generally used to evaluate for con-
sistency of findings with the overall trial and therefore 
may be underpowered for efficacy and safety outcomes. 
In the current analysis, the PAD subgroup was adequately 
powered to demonstrate statistically significant benefits 
for the primary end point and key secondary. Consistent 
with the overall trial, there was no significant reduction 
in CV death with evolocumab at 2.5 years, a benefit that 
generally has emerged only with longer follow-up in lipid-
lowering trials.26,36–38 The power to detect differences in 
rare safety events may have been limited by the size of the 
PAD subgroup; however, the pattern of safety was consis-
tent with the overall trial. Limb outcomes were collected 
on broad electronic case report form pages for peripheral 
outcomes and not focused specifically on ALI. This may 
have resulted in underascertainment of ALI outcomes but 
would not bias treatment effects. Finally, relationships be-
tween achieved LDL-C and outcome were not randomized 
and, although adjusted for confounders, the potential for 
residual confounding remains and should be recognized.
Conclusions
Patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD are at 
heightened risk of major adverse cardiovascular and limb 
events. Evolocumab added to statin therapy significantly 
and robustly reduces the risk of MACE, even in patients 
with PAD and no prior MI or stroke. Likewise, the addition 
of evolocumab to a statin reduced the risk of MALE, and 
the relationship between achieved LDL-C and lower risk 
of limb events extended down to very low achieved lev-
els of LDL. These benefits come with no offsetting safety 
concerns. Thus, LDL-C reduction to very low levels should 
be considered in patients with PAD, regardless of a history 
of MI or stroke, to reduce the risk of MACE and MALE.
