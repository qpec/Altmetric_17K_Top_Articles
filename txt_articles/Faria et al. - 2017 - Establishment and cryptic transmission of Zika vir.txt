 Establishment and cryptic transmission of Zika virus in Brazil 
and the Americas
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.
Abstract
Transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas was first confirmed in May 2015 in northeast 
Brazil1. Brazil has had the highest number of reported ZIKV cases worldwide (more than 200,000 
by 24 December 20162) and the most cases associated with microcephaly and other birth defects 
(2,366 confirmed by 31 December 20162). Since the initial detection of ZIKV in Brazil, more than 
45 countries in the Americas have reported local ZIKV transmission, with 24 of these reporting 
severe ZIKV-associated disease3. However, the origin and epidemic history of ZIKV in Brazil and 
the Americas remain poorly understood, despite the value of this information for interpreting 
observed trends in reported microcephaly. Here we address this issue by generating 54 complete or 
partial ZIKV genomes, mostly from Brazil, and reporting data generated by a mobile genomics 
laboratory that travelled across northeast Brazil in 2016. One sequence represents the earliest 
confirmed ZIKV infection in Brazil. Analyses of viral genomes with ecological and 
epidemiological data yield an estimate that ZIKV was present in northeast Brazil by February 
2014 and is likely to have disseminated from there, nationally and internationally, before the first 
detection of ZIKV in the Americas. Estimated dates for the international spread of ZIKV from 
Brazil indicate the duration of pre-detection cryptic transmission in recipient regions. The role of 
northeast Brazil in the establishment of ZIKV in the Americas is further supported by geographic 
analysis of ZIKV transmission potential and by estimates of the basic reproduction number of the 
virus.
Previous phylogenetic analyses have indicated that the ZIKV epidemic was caused by the 
introduction of an Asian genotype lineage into the Americas around late 2013, at least one 
year before its detection there4. An estimated 100 million people in the Americas are 
predicted to be at risk of acquiring ZIKV once the epidemic has reached its full extent5. 
However, little is known about the genetic diversity and transmission history of the virus in 
Brazil6. Reconstructing the spread of ZIKV from case reports alone is challenging because 
symptoms (typically fever, headache, joint pain, rashes, and conjunctivitis) overlap with

 those caused by co-circulating arthropod-borne viruses7 and owing to a lack of nationwide 
ZIKV-specific surveillance in Brazil before 2016.
We undertook a collaborative investigation of the molecular epidemiology of ZIKV in 
Brazil, including results from a mobile genomics laboratory that travelled through northeast 
Brazil during June 2016 (the ZiBRA project; http://www.zibraproject.org). Of five regions of 
Brazil (Fig. 1a), the northeast region has the most notified ZIKV cases (40% of Brazilian 
cases) and the most confirmed microcephaly cases (76% of Brazilian cases, as of 31 
December 20162), raising questions about why the region has been so severely affected8. 
Furthermore, northeast Brazil is the most populous region of Brazil that also has potential 
for year-round ZIKV transmission9. With support from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and 
other institutions (see Acknowledgements), the ZiBRA laboratory screened 1,330 samples 
(almost exclusively serum or blood) from patients in 82 municipalities across 5 federal states 
(Fig. 1, Extended Data Table 1a). Samples provided by the public health laboratories of each 
state (LACEN) and the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) were screened for the presence 
of ZIKV by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
On average, ZIKV viraemia persists for 10 days after infection; symptoms develop after 
about 6 days and can last for 1–2 weeks10. In line with previous observations in Colombia11, 
we found that RT-qPCR-positive samples from northeast Brazil were, on average, collected 
only 2 days after the onset of symptoms. The median RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of 
positive samples was correspondingly high, at 36 (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). For northeast 
Brazil, the time series of RT-qPCR+ cases was positively correlated with the number of 
weekly notified cases (Pearson’s = 0.62; Fig. 1b).
The ability of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti to transmit ZIKV is determined by 
ecological factors that affect adult survival, viral replication, and infective periods12. To 
investigate the receptivity of Brazilian regions to ZIKV transmission we used a measure of 
vector climatic suitability, derived from monthly temperature, relative humidity, and 
precipitation data13. Using linear regression we noted that, for each Brazilian region, there is 
a strong association between estimated climatic suitability and weekly notified cases (Fig. 
1b, c; adjusted R2 > 0.84, P < 0.001; Extended Data Table 1b). Similar to previous findings 
from dengue virus outbreaks14,15, notified ZIKV cases lag climatic suitability by about 4–6 
weeks in all regions, except northeast Brazil, where no time lag is evident. Despite these 
associations, numbers of notified cases should be interpreted cautiously because co-
circulating dengue and chikungunya viruses exhibit symptoms similar to ZIKV, and the 
Brazilian case reporting system has evolved through time (see Methods). We estimated basic 
reproductive numbers (R0) for ZIKV in each Brazilian region from the weekly notified case 
data and found that R0 was high in northeast Brazil (R0 around 3 for both epidemic seasons; 
Extended Data Table 1c). Although our R0 values are approximate, in part owing to spatial 
variation in transmission across the large regions analysed here, they are consistent with 
estimates from other approaches16,17.
Encouraged by the utility of portable genomic technologies during the West African Ebola 
virus epidemic18 we used our open protocol19 to sequence ZIKV genomes directly from 
clinical material using MinION DNA sequencers. We were able to generate virus sequences

 within 48h of the mobile laboratory’s arrival at each LACEN. In pilot experiments using a 
cultured ZIKV reference strain20 we recovered 98% of the virus genome (Extended Data 
Fig. 1c). However, owing to low viral copy numbers in clinical samples (Extended Data Fig. 
1a), many sequences exhibited incomplete genome coverage and required additional 
sequencing efforts in static labs once fieldwork had been completed. Whereas average 
genome coverage was typically high for samples with lower Ct values (85% for Ct<33; Fig. 
2a, Extended Data Table 2), samples with higher Ct values had variable coverage (mean 
72% for Ct>33; Fig. 2a). Unsequenced genome regions were non-randomly distributed (Fig. 
2b), suggesting that the efficiency of PCR amplification varied among primer pair 
combinations. We generated 36 near-complete or partial genomes from the northeast, 
southeast and northern regions of Brazil, supplemented by nine sequences from samples 
from Rio de Janeiro municipality. To further reconstruct Zika virus transmission in the 
Americas, we include five new complete ZIKV genomes from Colombia and four from 
Mexico. In addition, we append to our dataset 115 publicly available sequences and 85 
additional genomes from ref. 21. The final dataset comprised 254 ZIKV sequences, 241 of 
which were sampled in the Americas (see Methods).
The American ZIKV epidemic comprises a single founder lineage4,22,23 (hereafter termed 
Am-ZIKV) derived from Asian genotype viruses (hereafter termed PreAm-ZIKV) from 
southeast Asia and the Pacific4. A sliding window analysis of pairwise genetic diversity 
along the ZIKV genome shows that the diversity of PreAm-ZIKV strains is on average about 
two-fold greater than that of Am-ZIKV viruses (Fig. 2d), reflecting a longer period of ZIKV 
circulation in Asia and the Pacific than in the Americas. The genetic diversity of Am-ZIKV 
strains will increase in the future and updated diagnostic assays are recommended to 
guarantee RT-qPCR sensitivity24.
It has been suggested that recent ZIKV epidemics may be linked causally to a higher 
apparent evolutionary rate for the Asian genotype than the African genotype25,26. However, 
such comparisons are confounded by an inverse relationship between the timescale of 
observation and estimated evolutionary rates27. Regression of sequence sampling dates 
against root-to-tip genetic distances indicates that molecular clock models can be applied 
reliably to the Asian ZIKV lineage (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Figs 2, 3). We estimate the 
whole-genome evolutionary rate of Asian ZIKV to be 1.12 × 10−3 substitutions per site per 
year (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) 0.97–1.27 × 10−3), consistent with other 
estimates for this lineage4,26. We found no significant differences in evolutionary rates 
among ZIKV genome regions (Extended Data Table 3a). The estimated ratio of divergence 
at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites (dN/dS) of the Am-ZIKV lineage is low (0.11, 
95% confidence interval 0.10–0.13), as observed for other vector-borne flaviviruses28, but is 
higher than that of PreAm-ZIKV viruses (0.061, 0.047–0.077), probably owing to the raised 
probability of observing slightly deleterious changes in short-term datasets, as observed 
during previous epidemics29.
We used two phylogeographic approaches with different assumptions30,31 to reconstruct the 
origins and spread of ZIKV in Brazil and the Americas. We dated the common ancestor of 
ZIKV in the Americas (node B, Fig. 3) to Jan 2014 (95% BCI October 2013–April 2014; 
Extended Data Tables 3b, c), in line with previous estimates4,26. We find evidence that

 northeast Brazil played a central role in the establishment and dissemination of Am-ZIKV. 
Although northeast Brazil is the most probable location of node B (location posterior 
support 0.83, Fig. 3), the current data do not allow us to exclude the hypothesis that node B 
was in the Caribbean (Fig. 3 dashed branches) owing to the presence of two sequences from 
Haiti in one of its descendant lineages. More importantly, most Am-ZIKV sequences 
descend from a radiation of lineages (node C and its immediate descendants; Fig. 3) dated to 
late February 2014 (95% BCIs of node C, November 2013–May 2014). Node C is more 
strongly inferred to have existed in northeast Brazil (location posterior support 0.99, Fig. 3). 
All 20 replicate analyses performed on subsampled datasets place node C in Brazil, and 14 
of them place node C in northeast Brazil (Extended Data Fig. 4). Consequently, we conclude 
that node C reflects the crucial turning point in the emergence of ZIKV in the Americas. If 
further data show that node B did exist in Haiti, then it is likely that Haiti acted as an 
intermediate ‘stepping stone’ for the arrival and establishment of Am-ZIKV in Brazil, from 
where the virus subsequently spread to other regions. This perspective is consistent with the 
lower population size of Haiti compared to Brazil. We infer that node C was present in 
northeast Brazil several months before three notable events, each of which also occurred in 
northeast Brazil: (i) the retrospective identification of a cluster of suspected but unconfirmed 
ZIKV cases in December 20141; (ii) the collection of the oldest ZIKV genome sequence 
from Brazil, reported here, sampled in February 2015; and (iii) confirmation of cases of 
ZIKV transmission in northeast Brazil in March 201532,33.
Our results further indicate that viruses from northeast Brazil were important for the 
continental spread of ZIKV. Within Brazil, we find instances of virus lineage movement 
from northeast to southeast Brazil; most of these events are dated to the second half of 2014 
and led to onwards transmission in Rio de Janeiro (RJ1–RJ4; Fig. 3) and São Paulo states 
(SP1; Fig. 3). We infer that ZIKV lineages disseminated from northeast Brazil to elsewhere 
in Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. Most Am-ZIKV strains sampled 
outside Brazil fall into four well-supported phylogenetic groups (Fig. 3); three (SA1/CB1, 
CA1 and SA2) are inferred to have been exported from northeast Brazil between July 2014 
and April 2015, whereas the Caribbean clade CB2 appears to have originated from southeast 
Brazil around March 2015 (Figs 3, 4). Each viral lineage export occurred during a period of 
climatic suitability for vector transmission in the recipient location (Fig. 4). For the earliest 
exports to Central America (CA1) and South America (SA1), there is an estimated 11–12-
month gap between the date of export and the date of ZIKV detection in the recipient 
location, suggesting a complete season of undetected transmission. These periods of cryptic 
transmission are relevant to studies of spatiotemporal trends in reported microcephaly, 
because they help to define the appropriate timeframe for baseline (pre-ZIKV) microcephaly 
in each region.
Large-scale surveillance of ZIKV is challenging because many cases may be asymptomatic, 
and ZIKV co-circulates in some regions with other arthropod-borne viruses that have 
overlapping symptoms (for example, dengue, chikungunya, Mayaro, and Oropouche 
viruses). However combining virus genomic and epidemiological data can generate insights 
into vector-borne virus transmission. A system of continuous and structured virus 
sequencing in Brazil, integrated with surveillance data, could provide timely information to

 inform effective responses against Zika and other viruses, including the recently re-emerged 
yellow fever virus34.
Methods
Sample collection
Between the 1st and 18th June 2016, 1330 samples from cases notified as ZIKV infected 
were tested for ZIKV infection in the Northeast region of Brazil (NE Brazil). During this 
period, 4 of the 5 laboratories in the region visited by the ZiBRA project were in the process 
of implementing molecular diagnostics for ZIKV. The ZiBRA team spent 2–3 days in each 
state central public health laboratory (LACEN). The samples analysed had been previously 
collected from patients who had attended a municipal or state public health facility, 
presenting maculopapular rash and at least two of the following symptoms: fever, 
conjunctivitis, polyarthralgia, or periarticular edema. The majority of samples were linked to 
a digital record that collated epidemiological and clinical data: date of sample collection, 
location of residence, demographic characteristics, and date of onset of clinical symptoms 
(when available).
The ZiBRA project was supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) as part of the 
emergency public health response to Zika. Samples had been previously obtained for routine 
diagnostic purposes from persons visiting local clinics by the Brazilian National Health 
Surveillance network as part of Zika virus surveillance activities. In these cases, we used 
samples without informed consent with the approval of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 
Specifically, residual anonymized clinical diagnostic samples, with no or minimal risk to 
patients, were provided for research and surveillance purposes within the terms of 
Resolution 510/2016 of CONEP (Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa, Ministério da 
Saúde; National Ethical Committee for Research, Ministry of Health). For samples obtained 
from patients engaged in longitudinal studies of Zika virus in São Paulo and Tocantins 
states, informed consent was obtained (IRB CAAE 53153916.7.0000.0065). Samples from 
patients followed in Salvador and Feira de Santana were analysed under institutional 
approval from CPqGM/FioCruz/BA (1.184.454). Urine and plasma samples from Rio de 
Janeiro were obtained from patients at the Fiocruz Viral Hepatitis Ambulatory (Oswaldo 
Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) with Institutional Review Board approval (IRB142/01) 
from the Oswaldo Cruz Institute. RNA was extracted at the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut and 
sequenced at the University of Birmingham, UK.
Nucleic acid isolation and RT-qPCR
Serum, blood and urine samples were obtained from patients 0 to 228 days after first 
symptoms (Extended Data Table 1a). Viral RNA was isolated from 200 µl Zika-suspected 
samples using either the NucliSENS easyMag system (BioMerieux, Basingstoke, UK) 
(Ribeirão Preto samples), the ExiPrep Dx Viral RNA Kit (BIONEER, Republic of Korea) 
(Rio de Janeiro samples) or the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) 
(all other samples) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ct values were determined 
for all samples by probe-based RT-qPCR against the prM target (using 5′ FAM as the probe 
reporter dye) as previously described34. RT-qPCR assays were performed using the

 QuantiNova Probe RT-qPCR Kit (20 ul reaction volume; QIAGEN) with amplification in the 
Rotor-Gene Q (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers/probe were 
synthesised by Integrated DNA Technologies (Leuven, Belgium). The following reaction 
conditions were used: reverse transcription (50°C, 10 min), reverse transcriptase inactivation 
and DNA polymerase activation (95°C, 20 sec), followed by 40 cycles of DNA denaturation 
(95°C, 10 secs) and annealing-extension (60°C, 40 sec). Positive and negative controls were 
included in each batch; however, due to the large number of samples tested in a short time it 
was possible only to run each sample without replication.
Whole genome sequencing
Sequencing was attempted on all positive samples obtained from NE Brazil regardless of Ct 
value. All samples collected in Brazil that are reported in this study were sequenced with the 
Oxford Nanopore MinION. Sequencing statistics can be found in Extended Data Table 2. 
The protocol employed cDNA synthesis with random primers followed by gene specific 
multiplex PCR and is presented in detail in Quick et al. 18. In brief, extracted RNA was 
converted to cDNA using the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (New England 
Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) and random hexamer priming. ZIKV genome amplification by 
multiplex PCR was attempted using the ZikaAsianV1 primer scheme and 40 cycles of PCR 
using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) as described in Quick et al.18. PCR 
products were cleaned-up using AmpureXP purification beads (Beckman Coulter, High 
Wycombe, UK) and quantified using fluorimetry with the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity 
assay on the Qubit 3.0 instrument (Life Technologies). PCR products for samples yielding 
sufficient material were barcoded and pooled in an equimolar fashion using the Native 
Barcoding Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Sequencing libraries were 
generated from the barcoded products using the Genomic DNA Sequencing Kit SQK-
MAP007/SQK-LSK208 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Sequencing libraries were loaded 
onto a R9/R9.4 flowcell and data was collected for up to 48 hours but generally less. As 
described18, consensus genome sequences were produced by alignment of two-direction 
reads to a Zika virus reference genome (strain H/PF/2013, GenBank Accession number: 
KJ776791) followed by nanopore signal-level detection of single nucleotide variants. Only 
positions with ≥20x genome coverage were used to produce consensus alleles. Regions with 
lower coverage, and those in primer-binding regions were masked with N characters. 
Validation of our sequencing approach on the MinION platform was undertaken by using the 
MinION platform to sequence a WHO reference strain of Zika virus that was also sequenced 
using the Illumina Miseq platform19; identical consensus sequences were recovered 
regardless of the MinION chemistry version employed (R7.3, R9 and R9.4) (Extended Data 
Fig. 1c).
Collation of genome-wide data sets
Our complete and partial genome sequences were appended to a global data set of all 
available published ZIKV genome sequences (up until January 2017) using an in-house 
script that retrieves updated GenBank sequences on a daily basis. In addition to the genomes 
generated from samples collected in NE Brazil during ZiBRA fieldwork, samples were sent 
directly to University of São Paulo and elsewhere for sequencing. Thirteen genomes from 
Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo state (SP; SE-Brazil region) and seven genomes from Tocantins

 (TO; N-Brazil region) were sequenced at University of São Paulo. Nine genomes from Rio 
de Janeiro (RJ; SE-Brazil region) were sequenced in Birmingham, UK, and added to our 
dataset. All these genomes were generated using the same primer scheme as the ZiBRA 
samples collected in NE Brazil18. In addition to these 45 sequences from Brazil, we further 
included in analysis 9 genomes from ZIKV strains sampled outside of Brazil in order to 
contextualise the genetic diversity of Brazilian ZIKV, giving rise to a final data set of 54 
sequences. Specifically, we included 5 genomes from samples collected in Colombia and 4 
new genomes from Mexico, which were generated using the protocols described in 
refs. 35 and 22, respectively.
GenBank sequences belonging to the African genotype of ZIKV were identified using the 
Arboviral genotyping tool (http://bioafrica2.mrc.ac.za/rega-genotype/typingtool/
aedesviruses) and excluded from subsequent analyses, as our focus of study was the Asian 
genotype of ZIKV, and the Am-ZIKV lineage in particular. To assess the robustness of 
molecular clock dating estimates to the inclusion of older sequences, analyses were 
performed both with and without the P6-740 strain, the oldest known strain of the ZIKV-
Asian genotype (sampled in 1966 in Malaysia). Our final alignment comprised the 
sequences reported in this study (n=54) plus publicly available ZIKV-Asian genotype 
sequences, as of 1st March 2017 (n=115). We also included in our analysis 85 additional 
genomes from a companion paper20. The dataset used for analysis therefore included 
sequences from 254 Zika virus isolates, 241 of which were from the Americas. Unpublished 
but publicly available genomes were included in our analysis only if we had written 
permission from those who generated the data (see Acknowledgments).
Maximum likelihood analysis and recombination screening
Preliminary maximum likelihood (ML) trees were estimated with ExaMLv336 using a per-
site rate category model and a gamma distribution of among site rate variation. For the final 
analyses, ML trees were estimated using PhyML37 under a GTR nucleotide substitution 
model38, with a gamma distribution of among site rate variation, as selected by jModeltest.v.
239. Branch support was inferred using 100 bootstrap replicates37. Final ML trees were 
estimated with NNI and SPR heuristic tree search algorithms; equilibrium nucleotide 
frequencies and substitution model parameters were estimated using ML37 (see Extended 
Data Fig. 3).
Recombination may impact evolutionary estimates40 and has been shown to be present in the 
ZIKV-African genotype41. In addition to restricting our analysis to the Asian genotype of 
ZIKV, we employed the 12 recombination detection methods available in RDPv442 and the 
Phi-test approach43 available in SplitsTree44 to further search for evidence of recombination 
in the ZIKV-Asian lineage. No evidence of recombination was found.
Analysis of the temporal molecular evolutionary signal in our ZIKV alignments was 
conducted using TempEst45. In brief, collection dates in the format yyyy-mm-dd (ISO 8601 
standard) were regressed against root-to-tip genetic distances obtained from the ML 
phylogeny. When precise sampling dates were not available, a precision of 1 month or 1 year 
in the collection dates was taken into account.

 To compare the pairwise genetic diversity of PreAm-ZIKV strains from Asia and the Pacific 
with Am-ZIKV viruses from the Americas, we used a sliding window approach with 300 nt 
wide windows and a step size of 50 nt. Sequence gaps were ignored; hence the average 
pairwise difference per window was obtained by dividing the total pairwise nucleotide 
differences by the total number of pairwise comparisons.
Molecular clock phylogenetics and gene-specific dN/dS estimation
To estimate Bayesian molecular clock phylogenies, analyses were run in duplicate using 
BEASTv.1.8.446 for 30 million MCMC steps, sampling parameters and trees every 3000 
steps. We employed a model selection procedure using both path-sampling and stepping 
stone models47 to estimate the most appropriate combination of molecular clock and 
coalescent models for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. The best fitting combination was a 
Bayesian skyline tree prior and a relaxed molecular clock model, with log-normally 
distributed variation in rates among branches (Extended Data Table 3b). A non-informative 
continuous time Markov chain reference prior49 on the molecular clock rate was used. 
Convergence of MCMC chains was checked with Tracer v.1.6. After removal of burn-in, 
posterior tree distributions were combined and subsampled to generate an empirical 
distribution of 1,500 molecular clock trees.
To estimate rates of evolution per gene we partitioned the alignment into 10 genes (3 
structural genes C, prM, E, and 7 non-structural genes NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 
NS4B and NS5) and employed a SDR06 substitution model48 and a strict molecular clock 
model, using an empirical distribution of molecular clock phylogenies. To estimate the ratio 
of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS) for the PreAm-ZIKV and 
the Am-ZIKV lineages, we used the single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) method50 
implemented in HyPhy51. This method was applied to two distinct codon-based alignments 
and their corresponding ML trees which comprised the PreAm-ZIKV and Am-ZIKV 
sequences, respectively.
Phylogeographic analysis
We investigated virus lineage movements using our empirical distribution of phylogenetic 
trees and the sampling location of each ZIKV sequence. The sampling location of sequences 
collected from returning travellers was set to the travel destination in the Americas where 
infection likely occurred. We discretised sequence sampling locations in Brazil into the 
geographic regions defined in the main text. The number of sequences per region available 
for analysis was 10 for N Brazil, 41 for NE Brazil and 54 for SE Brazil. No viral genetic 
data was available for the Centre-West (CW) and the South (S) Brazilian regions. We 
similarly discretised the locations of ZIKV sequences sampled outside of Brazil. These were 
grouped according to the United Nations M49 coding classification of macro-geographical 
regions. Our analysis included 53 sequences from the Caribbean, 38 from Central America, 
17 from Polynesia, 37 from South America (excluding Brazil), 3 from Southeast Asia and 1 
from Micronesia. To account for the possibility of sampling bias arising from a larger 
number of sequences from particular locations, we repeated all phylogeographic analyses 
using (i) the full dataset (n=254) and (ii) ten jackknife resampled datasets (n=74) in which

 taxa from each location (except for Southeast Asia and Micronesia) were randomly sub-
sampled to 10 sequences (the number of sequences available for N-Brazil).
Phylogeographic reconstructions were conducted using two approaches; (i) using the 
asymmetric52 discrete trait evolution models implemented in BEASTv1.8.446 and (ii) using 
the Bayesian structured coalescent approximation (BASTA)29 implemented in BEAST2v.2. 
The latter has been suggested to be less sensitive to sampling biases53. For both approaches, 
maximum clade credibility trees were summarized from the MCMC samples using 
TreeAnnotator after discarding 10% as burn-in. The posterior estimates of the location of 
nodes A, B and C (depicted in Fig. 3) from these two analytical approaches (applied to both 
the complete and jackknifed data sets) can be found in Extended Data Fig. 4.
For the discrete trait evolution approach, we counted the expected number of transitions 
among each pair of locations (net migration) using the robust counting approach54,55 
available in BEASTv1.8.446. We then used those inferred transitions to identify the earliest 
estimated ZIKV introductions into new regions. These viral lineage movement events were 
statistically supported (with Bayes factors > 3) using the BSSVS (Bayesian stochastic search 
variable selection) approach implemented in BEASTv.1.8.430. Box plots for node ages were 
generated using the ggplot256 package in R software57.
Epidemiological analysis
Weekly suspected ZIKV data per Brazilian region were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry 
of Health (MoH). Cases were defined as suspected ZIKV infection when patients presented 
maculopapular rash and at least two of the following symptoms: fever, conjunctivitis, 
polyarthralgia or periarticular edema. Because notified suspected ZIKV cases are based on 
symptoms and not molecular diagnosis, it is possible that some notified cases represent other 
co-circulating viruses with related symptoms, such as dengue and Chikungunya viruses. 
Further, case reporting may have varied among regions and through time. Data from 2015 
came from the pre-existing MoH sentinel surveillance system that comprised 150 reporting 
units throughout Brazil, which was eventually standardised in Feb 2016 in response to the 
ZIKV epidemic. We suggest that these limitations should be borne in mind when 
interpreting the ZIKV notified case data and we consider the R0 values estimated here to be 
approximate. That said, our time series of RT-qPCR+ ZIKV diagnoses from NE Brazil 
qualitatively match the time series of notified ZIKV cases from the same region (Fig. 1b). To 
estimate the exponential growth rate of the ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, we fit a simple 
exponential growth rate model to each stage of the weekly number of suspected ZIKV cases 
from each region separately:
(1)
where Iw is the number of cases in week w. As described in main text, the Brazilian regions 
considered here were NE Brazil, N-Brazil, S-Brazil, SE-Brazil, and CW-Brazil. The time 
period over which exponential growth occurs was determined by plotting the log of Iw and 
selecting the period of linearity (Extended Data Fig. 5). A linear model was then fitted to 
this period to estimate the weekly exponential growth rate rW:

Let g(.) be the probability density distribution of the epidemic generation time (i.e. the 
duration between the time of infection of a case and the mean time of infection of its 
secondary infections). The following formula can be used to derive the reproduction number 
R from the exponential growth rate r and density g(.)58.
(3)
In our baseline analysis, following Ferguson et al.59 we assume that the ZIKV generation 
time is Gamma-distributed with a mean of 20.0 days and a standard deviation (SD) of 7.4 
days. In a sensitivity analysis, we also explored scenarios with shorter mean generation 
times (10.0 and 15.0 days) but unchanged coefficient of variation SD/mean=7.4/20=0.37 
(Extended Data Table 1c).
Association between Aedes aegypti climatic suitability and ZIKV notified cases
To account for seasonal variation in the geographical distribution of the ZIKV vector Aedes 
aegypti in Brazil we fitted high-resolution maps60 to monthly covariate data. Covariate data 
included time-varying variables, such as temperature-persistence suitability, relative 
humidity, and precipitation, as well as static covariates such as urban versus rural land use. 
Maps were produced at a 5km × 5km resolution for each calendar month and then 
aggregated to the level of the five Brazilian regions used in this study (Extended Data Fig. 
6). For consistency, we rescaled monthly suitability values so that the sum of all monthly 
maps equalled the annual mean map9.
We then assessed the correlation between monthly Aedes aegypti climatic suitability and the 
number of weekly ZIKV notified cases in each Brazilian region, to test how well vector 
suitability explains the variation in the number of ZIKV notified cases. To account for the 
correlation in each Brazilian region we fit a linear regression model with a lag and two 
breakpoints. As there may be a lag between trends in suitability and trends in notified cases, 
we include a temporal term in the model to allow for a shift in the respective curves. Thus 
for each region, different sets of the constant and linear terms are fitted to different time 
periods. More formally,
(4)
where yi represents notified cases in a particular region in month i, xi is the climatic 
suitability in that region in month i, l is the time lag that yields the highest correlation 
between yi and xi and T is the set of time indexes in the correlated region.

 We then find the values of T and l that provide the highest adjusted-R2 by stepwise iterative 
optimisation. For each value of T evaluated, the optimal value of l (i.e. that which gives the 
highest adjusted-R2 for the model above) is found by the optim function in R57. Climatic 
suitability values were only calculated for each month, so to calculate suitability values for 
any given point in time we interpolated between the monthly values using a linear function. 
We found no significant effect of residual autocorrelation in our data (Extended Data Fig. 7).

 Fig. 1. Geographic and temporal distribution of ZIKV in Brazil
a. Sampling location of genome sequences from Brazil and the Americas. Federal states in 
Brazil are coloured according to 5 geographic regions (lower inset). A red line surrounds the 
states surveyed by the ZiBRA mobile lab in 2016. State codes are PA=Pará, MA=Maranhão, 
CE=Ceará, TO=Tocantins, RN=Rio Grande do Norte, PB=Paraíba, PE=Pernambuco, 
AL=Alagoas, BA=Bahia, RJ=Rio de Janeiro, SP=São Paulo. Underlined states represent 
those from which sequences in this study were generated (upper inset). Publicly available 
sequences were also collated from non-underlined states. b. Confirmed and notified ZIKV 
cases in NE Brazil. Upper panel shows the temporal distribution of RT-qPCR+ cases 
detected during ZiBRA fieldwork. Only samples with known collection dates are included 
(n=138 out of 181 confirmed cases). Lower panel shows notified ZIKV cases in NE Brazil 
between 01 Jan 2015 and 19 Nov 2016 (n=122,779). The dashed line represents the average 
climatic vector suitability score for NE Brazil (Methods). The vertical arrow indicates date 
of ZIKV confirmation in NE Brazil/Americas1. c. Notified ZIKV cases in the Centre-West, 
Southeast, North, and South regions of Brazil (clockwise from top left). The dashed lines 
represent the average climatic vector suitability score for each region.

 Fig. 2. Zika virus genetic diversity and sequencing statistics
a. The percentage of ZIKV genome sequenced plotted against RT-qPCR Ct-value, for each 
sample. Each circle represents a sequence recovered from an infected individual in Brazil 
and is coloured by sampling location. b. Illustration of sequencing coverage across the 
ZIKV genome for the ZiBRA sequences, including data generated by both mobile and static 
laboratories. c. Regression of sequence sampling dates against root-to-tip genetic distances 
in a maximum likelihood phylogeny of the Asian-ZIKV lineage. Extended Data Fig. 2b 
contains a comparable analysis that also includes P6-740 (the oldest Asian-ZIKV strain 
collected in 1966). d. Average pairwise genetic diversity of the PreAm-ZIKV strains (grey 
line) and of the Am-ZIKV lineage (black line), calculated using a sliding window of 300 
nucleotides with a step size of 50 nucleotides.

 Fig. 3. Phylogeography of ZIKV in the Americas
Maximum clade credibility phylogeny, estimated from complete and partial Am-ZIKV 
genomes using a molecular clock phylogeographic approach (Methods). Terminal branches 
with yellow circles indicate sequences reported in this study. Terminal branches with no 
circles and reduced opacity are those reported in a companion paper20. Thin vertical grey 
boxes indicate statistical uncertainty of estimated dates of nodes A, B and C (Extended Data 
Table 3c). Branch colours indicate the most probable ancestral lineage locations. Diamonds 
at internal nodes are sized in proportion to clade posterior probabilities. For selected nodes, 
coloured numbers show the posterior probabilities of ancestral locations and numbers in 
grey are clade posterior probabilities. Asterisks indicate the three available genomes from 
microcephaly cases. A black arrow indicates the oldest Brazilian ZIKV sequence. The grey 
arrow and dotted line denotes when ZIKV was first confirmed in the Americas1. Nodes A 
and B are equivalent to the nodes named identically in4. Text labels along the bottom of the 
figure denote clades of sequences from regions outside of NE Brazil. RJ1 to RJ4 are clades 
from Rio de Janeiro state, TO from Tocantins, and SP1 from São Paulo state. Clades from 
outside Brazil are denoted CB1 and CB2 (Caribbean), SA1 and SA2 (South America 
excluding Brazil), and CA1 (Central America). Thin grey horizontal lines along the bottom 
of the figure denote sequences from Brazil.

 Fig. 4. Establishment of Am-ZIKV in the Americas
The earliest inferred dates of lineage export to non-Brazilian regions, represented by box-
and-whisker plots. Each plot corresponds to the earliest movement between a pair of 
locations with well-supported virus lineage migration. The first exports to South America 
outside Brazil (SA1 in Fig. 3), to Central America (CA1) and to the Caribbean (CB1) are 
shown in panels a–c, respectively. Box and whisker plots were generated in ggplot2, with 
boxes representing the median and interquartile ranges of the estimated date of earliest 
movement. In each of a–c, dashed lines show the estimated climatic vector suitability score 
for each recipient region, averaged across the countries for which sequence data is available 
(see Methods). In each of a-c, the bar plots show available notified ZIKV case data (plots 
adapted from PAHO) for the countries with the earliest confirmed cases (Colombia61 in 
panel a, Mexico62 in b, and Puerto Rico63 in c). Coloured arrows indicate the earliest 
confirmation of ZIKV autochthonous cases in each non-Brazilian region. The vertical 
dashed line represents the date of ZIKV confirmation in the Americas.
