Abstract
Background
Low socioeconomic position (SEP) is recognized as a risk factor for worse health outcomes.
How socioeconomic factors influence end-of-life care, and the magnitude of their effect, is
not understood. This review aimed to synthesise and quantify the associations between
measures of SEP and use of healthcare in the last year of life.
Methods and findings
MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ASSIA databases were searched without
language restrictions from inception to 1 February 2019. We included empirical observa-
tional studies from high-income countries reporting an association between SEP (e.g.,
income, education, occupation, private medical insurance status, housing tenure, housing
quality, or area-based deprivation) and place of death, plus use of acute care, specialist and
nonspecialist end-of-life care, advance care planning, and quality of care in the last year of
life. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment
Scale (NOS). The overall strength and direction of associations was summarised, and
where sufficient comparable data were available, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were pooled
and dose-response meta-regression performed.
A total of 209 studies were included (mean NOS quality score of 4.8); 112 high- to
medium-quality observational studies were used in the meta-synthesis and meta-analysis
(53.5% from North America, 31.0% from Europe, 8.5% from Australia, and 7.0% from Asia).
Compared to people living in the least deprived neighbourhoods, people living in the most
deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to die in hospital versus home (OR 1.30, 95% CI
1.23–1.38, p < 0.001), to receive acute hospital-based care in the last 3 months of life (OR
1.16, 95% CI 1.08–1.25, p < 0.001), and to not receive specialist palliative care (OR 1.13,
95% CI 1.07–1.19, p < 0.001). For every quintile increase in area deprivation, hospital ver-
sus home death was more likely (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05–1.08, p < 0.001), and not receiving
specialist palliative care was more likely (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.05, p < 0.001). Compared

Conclusions
In high-income countries, low SEP is a risk factor for hospital death as well as other indica-
tors of potentially poor-quality end-of-life care, with evidence of a dose response indicating
that inequality persists across the social stratum. These findings should stimulate wide-
spread efforts to reduce socioeconomic inequality towards the end of life.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Social inequality in health is a global phenomenon; people with lower socioeconomic
position (SEP) experience earlier onset of disease and have reduced life expectancy.
• Studies have identified low SEP as a risk factor for worse care at the end of life, and sev-
eral socioeconomic factors have been identified as determinants of care towards the end
of life.
• Despite growing recognition, no empirical synthesis of evidence exists to support efforts
to reduce socioeconomic inequality at the end of life.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We carried out a systematic review of studies that reported an association between a
measure of SEP (including income, education, occupation, private medical insurance
status, housing tenure, housing quality, or area-based deprivation) and healthcare
received by adults in their last year of life (including place of death, use of acute care,
use of specialist palliative care, use of nonspecialist end-of-life care, use of advance care
planning, or quality of care) in high-income countries.
• A total of 209 studies were included in the review; we found consistent evidence that
low SEP increases the odds of hospital versus home death and of using acute care ser-
vices in the last 3 months of life and reduces the odds of using specialist palliative care in
the last year of life.
• We also found that measurement of SEP in this field is dominated by measures of area
deprivation and education, and justification for choice of SEP measure(s) is often inade-
quately described.

 What do these findings mean?
• We have found consistent evidence of socioeconomic inequality in the care received by
people towards the end of life, in that people with lower SEP are more likely to experi-
ence worse care.
• We must now make further efforts to reduce this inequality.
• We recommend the following: that all research on care received towards the end of life
should attempt to account for SEP, end-of-life care interventions should be analysed for
their different effects across the social strata, and the planning and provision of end-of-
life care services should consider SEP in local populations.
Introduction
Social inequality in health status, access to, and quality of healthcare is a global phenomenon
[1]. For example, in the United Kingdom, people living in the most deprived neighbourhoods
(measured using the Index of Multiple Deprivation at Lower Layer Super Output Area Level)
have a life expectancy up to 7 years shorter, and experience the onset of disease and disability
as much as 17 years earlier, than people living in the least deprived neighbourhoods [2].
Explanations for the social determinants of health emphasise the cumulative effect of events
throughout the life course on health outcomes later in life [3]. Structural (policy and culture),
individual (material, behavioural, and psychosocial), and health-system factors all contribute
to health inequality [3].
In high-income countries, proposed population-level quality indicators for end-of-life care
include receipt of specialist palliative care, hospital admissions in the last months of life, emer-
gency department attendance in the last months of life, and whether people are supported to
be cared for in their usual place of residence rather than in hospital [4]. In Canada, the United
States, and the UK, lower socioeconomic position (SEP; measured through neighbourhood
deprivation) is associated with increased risk of death in hospital rather than in the community
[5–7] and more emergency admissions in the last months of life [8,9]. In the UK, improve-
ments in where people die—with fewer people dying in hospital and more at home or in hos-
pice—have been significantly greater for those who are least deprived [10,11]. In terms of
hospice deaths, the gap between the least and most deprived grew by 25% between 1993–1997
and 2008–2012 [11].
At the end of life, even within systems of universal coverage, people with limited resources
generally have more complex clinical needs [12] and are less able to support their own care at
home [13]. More socioeconomically deprived people may also have poor access to and knowl-
edge of services and/or communicate their care preferences less [13–15]. One consequence of
rapid population ageing is the rising numbers of deaths; globally, deaths will increase from 57
million in 2015 to 70 million over the next 15 years [16]. Social inequality in health, including
at the end of life, is likely to be exacerbated by the ageing population.
While measures of SEP are commonly included as covariates in studies about end-of-life
care, there is considerable variation in what is measured and how. Information on social
inequality at the end of life has not been systematically summarised, including on the magni-
tude of effect of SEP on outcomes. This limits our understanding of how SEP relates to end-of-
life care, as well as the incorporation of SEP into quality evaluations and service delivery plans.

 The aim of this review is to systematically identify, synthesise, and quantify existing evi-
dence on the association between SEP and use of healthcare in the last year of life—including
place of death, use of acute care use, use of specialist palliative care and nonspecialist end-of-
life care, use of advance care planning, and quality of care—and to report how SEP has been
measured within this literature.
Methods
The protocol was registered (CRD42017055686) with PROSPERO, the international prospec-
tive register of systematic reviews [17], and the study was conducted and reported following
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) state-
ment (S1 PRISMA Checklist) [18] and MOOSE [19] guidelines for meta-analysis and system-
atic reviews of observational studies. Ethical approval was not required for this review.
Search strategy
The following databases were searched from inception to 1 February 2019: MEDLINE,
MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ASSIA. Search terms including
subject headings and free-text words were developed in MEDLINE and then adapted for
other databases (S1 Text). Key papers identified from reviews by Henson (2015) [20–24] and
Gomes (2006) [7,25–29], as well as prior knowledge [30–34], were used to refine the search
terms. Consultation with the review team (FM, MM, KS, and IH) provided expert advice to
identify missing papers and relevant reviews [35–47], the reference lists of which were
searched manually. No language restrictions were applied, non–English-language papers
were assessed for inclusion, and data were extracted by a native speaker. Grey literature and
thesis and conference abstracts were included, and requests for additional data were made to
authors by email.
Study inclusion criteria
We included empirical observational studies reporting an association between SEP and health-
care received by adults (�18 years old) in the last year of life. Studies were restricted to those
from high-income countries to limit contextual differences in the availability of services and
strengthen assumptions made about preferable service-use outcomes [48]. Studies were
included if they met the following criteria.
• Participants were adults with malignant and nonmalignant advanced or incurable illness in
community or inpatient settings receiving or not receiving specialist palliative care, and
at least 80% of the sample were in the last year of life (based on date of death or clinical
prognosis).
• An indicator of SEP was reported, such as income, education, occupation, private medical
insurance status, housing tenure, housing quality, or area-based deprivation. Race and eth-
nicity are conceptually separate constructs than that of SEP and beyond the scope of this
review [49,50].
• At least one of the following comprehensive set of outcomes was reported: place of death,
acute care admission, use of specialist palliative care, use of nonspecialist end-of-life care,
use of advance care planning, or quality of care. Outcomes were selected based on prior
knowledge of availability within the literature. Patient-reported or patient-centred outcome
measures were included as indicators of quality of care [51,52].

 • The study design was empirical and observational, either prospective or retrospective; exper-
imental, qualitative, or case-study designs were not suited to the review aims and were
excluded. Area-level studies, in which the unit of analysis was not individuals, were also
excluded.
Study selection
Study selection and de-duplication was managed in EndNote X8 (Clarivate Analytics, Phila-
delphia, PA) (JD). Titles and abstracts retrieved from the electronic database and reference list
searches were first screened, and then full texts of potentially eligible studies were sourced and
reviewed independently by 2 authors (JD plus MM, JL, or RW). Disagreement was resolved
through discussion with a third author (KS). Multiple studies based on the same sample of
individuals were treated as duplicates; inclusion was prioritised based on larger sample size
and study quality.
Quality evaluation and grading of evidence
Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS)
[53], a 9-item measure developed for observational studies with a focus on sample represen-
tativeness, data quality, and appropriateness of analysis. Aligned with the aims of this review,
representativeness of the exposed cohort (NOS item 1 ‘selection’) was judged to be of high
quality if the sample reflected the socioeconomic strata in the country of origin. On this
basis, national population-based or nationally representative samples not restricted by
demographics, diagnosis, or geography were considered to have a low sampling bias and be
of the highest quality. Studies that adjusted for confounders—thus limiting bias—were also
of higher quality, with age and sex being the factors considered most important to control
for (NOS item 5 ‘comparability’). Appraisal of articles was carried out independently by two
authors (JD and MM), with disagreement resolved through discussion. The overall strength
of the evidence and the direction of the association between SEP exposures and outcomes
were graded using an adaptation of a previously established algorithm (Fig 1) [54], taking
into account 3 key elements important for grading studies—quality, quantity, and consis-
tency [55].
Data extraction
A piloted data extraction form was used to extract relevant information from included studies.
Data items included study characteristics, sample characteristics, type of SEP measure used,
and adjusted estimates. Data were extracted by one author (JD), and then two authors (JL and
RW) independently checked a 20% sample for accuracy; errors were verified through discus-
sion and were corrected.
Most studies reported adjusted odds ratios (ORs). For studies reporting risk ratios (RRs),
when possible, an OR was derived as a function of the RR, proportion of cases, and proportion
of exposed [56]. Most studies treated SEP exposures as categorical. Some studies treated SEP
exposures as numerical or ordinal, reporting a single effect size for a unit change in the expo-
sure. Those based on a numeric scale, e.g., income in US dollars, could not be converted to
ORs. Those based on underlying categories were converted by raising the effect size to the
number of categories separating the highest and lowest. For example, for a study reporting a
unit-change OR of 0.92 going from high to low SEP with 5 categories, the OR for the lowest
SEP group was approximated by raising 0.92 to the power of 4
(0.92 × 0.92 × 0.92 × 0.92 = 0.72).

 Synthesis and statistical analysis
Studies were initially grouped according to outcome and exposure categories. To avoid double
counting samples, each study contributed no more than once in each category. Within-study
duplicates—e.g., if two area-based measures were used—were prioritised based on heterogene-
ity with other measures. Most outcomes were defined in terms of receipt or not of a service.
For place of death, death at home, in hospice, or in long-term care (LTC) was considered
favourable compared to death in hospital, in line with evidence on preferences for place of
death in high-income countries [57]. SEP measures were described in terms of the average
number used across studies; how the measures were constructed as binary, categorical, or con-
tinuous variables; and whether they were objective or subjective measures [50].
The meta-analysis was restricted to high- and medium-quality studies (see Fig 1 for defini-
tion) that had used multivariable analysis to reduce bias from confounding, and were more
likely to be representative of the population social strata from which the study samples were
drawn. Following an approach used elsewhere [58,59], the adjusted OR for the lowest versus
the highest SEP group was presented. ORs were standardised so that an OR > 1 indicated a
pro–high-SEP association. The overall strength and direction of the evidence was summarised
using a diagram influenced by an existing design [60,61]. Rules for deriving the strength of evi-
dence are described in the algorithm in Fig 1. Direction was determined by categorising associ-
ations as either ‘pro–high-SEP’ or ‘pro–low-SEP’. The interpretation of null effects relies more
heavily on sample size, which is not incorporated in the diagram; therefore, following peer
review that highlighted this limitation, null effects were not depicted.

of �7. Medium quality was assigned to studies that had controlled for age and/or sex in a multivariable analysis and had an NOS score of �5, or had not
carried out multivariable analysis but had an NOS score of �6. Low-quality studies had no multivariable analysis and an NOS score of �5, or an NOS
score of �4. High-strength evidence required �70% agreement about the direction of the exposure outcome association; moderate strength evidence
required �60% agreement. NOS, Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale; SEP, socioeconomic position.

 For subgroups of exposure and outcome, when enough comparable studies were available
presenting OR for categories of SEP exposure, adjusted ORs were pooled using random-effects
models. Acute care studies were only pooled if they were about care received in last 3 months
of life to reflect established aggressive care definitions [62]. For better comparability, studies
about use of nonspecialist end-of-life care were pooled only when the outcome was the receipt
of nursing or support worker homecare. High levels of heterogeneity were expected given the
observational nature of the studies and variety in measurement of SEP and definition of out-
comes; heterogeneity was reported using Higgins’ I-squared (I2).[63] Studies reporting sepa-
rate estimates for subgroups of the same sample, by year [64], gender [65], diagnosis [66], or
regions within a country [67,68], were pooled prior to meta-analysis with fixed or random
effects depending on level of heterogeneity (I2). Following peer review that highlighted an
inconsistency with the approach taken to other subgroups, studies reporting estimates sepa-
rately for people living in the community and inpatient locations were also pooled prior to
meta-analysis [31,69–72]. We anticipated between-country variations due to cultural differ-
ences in end-of-life practices, particularly in Asian countries [73]. For each pooled meta-analy-
sis, a sensitivity analysis was carried out using subgroups by country to explore differences.
Further sensitivity analysis examined change in the pooled estimates after each of the studies
was removed from the meta-analysis.
To examine for a dose response for studies that presented data on at least 3 exposure catego-
ries, we used a random-effects weighted meta-regression of the log-OR to derive an estimation
of the summarised dose response using the glst command in Stata (Stata SE version 13; Stata-
Corp, College Station, TX) [74–76]. This approach uses a two-stage generalised least squares
model that first estimates the within-study trend and then pools these to give an overall trend
estimate [76]. Using the method described by Hamling and colleagues [77], studies were first
standardised so that the reference group was always the least deprived. Dose was assigned
using the cumulative mean relative rank for each SEP group reported. For example, for area
deprivation, if quintile 5 (the least deprived group) accounted for 33% of the sample and quin-
tile 4 accounted for a further 25% of the sample, the mean relative rank for quintile 5 would be
17 and for quintile 4 would be 29 [58]. Dose was then centred for each study so that the dose
for the reference group was 0. Doses for all groups (other than the reference group) and the
corresponding log-odds were plotted and inspected visually for linearity. For studies reporting
multiple estimates for subgroups of the same sample, only the largest subgroup was included
because of inability to control for dependence.
Results
A total of 682 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, of which 209 were included in the
review (Fig 2).
Summary of included studies
Of the 209 studies included, 158 (75.6%) used 1 type of SEP measure; the mean number of
measures per study was 1.3, and the maximum number was 6 [78]. A total of 273 SEP measure-
ments were reported across 209 studies; these were categorised as area deprivation (29.7%),
education (28.9%), income (16.8%), insurance (12.8%), occupation (4.4%), housing (3.3%),
social class (3.7%), and literacy (0.4%). Of the 209 studies, 205 (98.1%) used objective measures
of SEP, such as self-reported level of education or income, information obtained from admin-
istrative records, or area-based deprivation. Four studies [79–82] employed subjective mea-
sures, all concerning self-rated financial security; 172 (82.3%) studies provided a full or
partial description of the SEP measure(s), including referencing the source of the measure,

 referencing the wording of the question used, or identifying the data set the SEP measure was
contained within. In 27 (12.9%) studies, SEP was the main exposure variable of interest; 12 of
these provided theoretical justification for choice of SEP measure.
The mean NOS quality score across all studies was 4.8 (range: 0–10) (see S1 Fig for histo-
gram of scores); 97 (46.4%) of 209 studies were rated low quality, including all 11 studies on
quality of care. A complete list of the low-quality studies is provided in S2 Text. The remaining
112 high- and medium-quality studies were included in further synthesis and meta-analysis
(Table 1 and S3 Text). Combined, these studies report 142 outcomes of interest: most com-
monly, place of death (50.7%), then 25.4% on use of specialist palliative, 13.4% on use of acute
care services, 7.7% on use of nonspecialist end-of-life care, and 2.8% on use of advance care
planning. The majority of data were from the US (34.5%), Canada (19.0%), or Europe (not
including the UK) (21.1%); 9.9% were from the UK, 8.5% from Australia, 4.2% from South
Korea, 2.1% from Taiwan, and 0.7% from Singapore. Eight full-text non–English-language
papers were assessed for eligibility: 2 in Japanese, 1 in German, 1 in Korean, and 3 in Spanish
—3 of these were included in the review [83–85]. Data extraction was accurate for 98.1% of
items.

 Strength and direction of the evidence
Fig 3 depicts a summary of evidence from 112 high- and medium-quality studies. We found
strong evidence of a pro–high-SEP association between area deprivation and place of death,
i.e., people with lowest SEP versus those with highest SEP are more likely to die in hospital
compared to home. There was also moderate evidence of a pro–high-SEP association between
area deprivation and use of both acute care and nonspecialist end-of-life care. We found mod-
erate evidence of a pro–high-SEP association between education and advance care planning,
as well as between housing quality and place of death. Overall, there was no evidence of pro–
low-SEP associations.
Association between area deprivation or education and care received
towards the end of life
Figs 4 and 5 display the ORs and 95% CIs for the lowest (most deprived) SEP group compared
to the highest (least deprived) SEP group for each study, as well as the pooled ORs using ran-
dom-effects models. Pooled estimates found that, compared to people living in the least
deprived areas, people living in the most deprived areas had an OR of 1.30 for hospital versus

(95% CI 1.07–1.19, p < 0.001), of 1.16 for receiving acute hospital-based care in the last 3
months of life (95% CI 1.08–1.25, p < 0.001), and of 1.09 for not receiving nonspecialist end-
of-life care (95% CI 0.83–1.43, p = 0.544). Pooled estimates found that, compared to the most
educated, the least educated people had an OR of 1.26 for not receiving specialist palliative
care (95% CI 1.07–1.49, p = 0.005). Overall, we found no difference between the most educated
and the least educated people for odds of hospital versus home death, with an OR of 1.08 (95%
CI 0.91–1.27, p < 0.377). However, subgroup analysis by country found the pooled estimate
for the South Korean studies to be in the opposite direction to other countries (S2 Fig); after
omitting the South Korean studies, the pooled estimate for hospital versus home death for the
least educated people compared to the most educated people was significant, with an OR of
1.16 (95% CI 1.12–1.21, p < 0.001). Heterogeneity was high; I2 was between 80.1% and 99.9%
for all of the subgroup analyses—apart from the subgroup for the association between educa-
tion and use of specialist palliative care (I2 = 32.1%, p = 0.219). Each of the pooled ORs
changed only marginally after omitting successive studies. Dose-response analysis found that,
for a 1 quintile (1 unit multiplied by 10, on a 0–50 scale), increase in area deprivation the log-
odds of dying in hospital versus home increased by 1.07 (95% CI 1.05–1.08, p < 0.001), and

evidence and a lighter arrow moderate evidence. An arrow from exposure to outcome indicates a pro–high-SEP association such that lowest (compared
to highest) SEP was associated with an adverse outcome. There was no evidence of pro–low-SEP associations. Associations with low evidence or with

Discussion
This review finds consistent evidence that, in high-income countries, low SEP is associated
with adverse healthcare outcomes towards the end of life, including increased odds of hospital

 versus home death, increased odds of using acute care services in the last 3 months of life, and
reduced odds of receiving specialist palliative care in the last year of life. A dose-response asso-
ciation is evident between area deprivation and both place of death and receipt of specialist
palliative care, which confirms that inequality persists across the social stratum. Evidence of
social inequality in the use of nonspecialist end-of-life care and advance care planning is based
on a smaller number of studies and is less conclusive but similarly suggests pro–high-SEP asso-
ciations. Although awareness of the association between SEP and place of death is longstand-
ing [7,29], this review is the first to synthesise international evidence on social inequality
across several components of service use at the end of life.
Most studies used one measure of SEP as a sample descriptor or to control for confounding;
area-based measures—and, to a lesser extent, measures of education—dominate. Place of
death was the most common outcome studied, reflecting the focus on place of death in end-of-
life care research generally and the wide availability of death registry data [110]. Variation in
the magnitude of association between different measures of SEP was observed; e.g., area depri-
vation had a stronger association (OR 1.30) than education (OR 1.08) with place of death, and
conversely, education had a stronger association (OR 1.26) than area deprivation (OR 1.13)

scatter plot in Fig 6 depicts the linear association between dose of area deprivation (0 being least deprived, 50 being most deprived)
and the log-odds of death in hospital versus death at home/hospice/LTC, compared to the least area-deprived group. The circles
represent the dose-specific estimates from the 20 included studies [5,21,24,26,34,64,70,86–98]; each study contributes 2, 3, or 4 circles
reflecting the number of area-deprivation categories included in the study (the reference category, the least deprived group, is not
plotted), and the size of the circle corresponds to the inverse of its total variance. The regression line calculated using the 2-stage glst
command in Stata with random effects accounting for within-study dependence reflects a significant positive relationship between
dose of area deprivation and likelihood of hospital death (for a 10× unit increase in dose β = 1.07, 95% CI 1.05–1.08, p < 0.001). LTC,

 with use of specialist palliative care. High levels of between-study heterogeneity prevent robust
comparisons of the pooled ORs. However, the differences observed raise questions about the
relative importance of different aspects of SEP for specific outcomes. For example, it is plausi-
ble that level of education acts as a proxy for awareness of specialist palliative care services and
that awareness is a stronger driver of access than other aspects of SEP such as area deprivation
[14]. The findings from this review support further investigation of these differences.
This review included a comprehensive set of end-of-life outcomes. Eleven studies measur-
ing quality of care using patient-reported or patient-centred outcome measures were found,
but all were of low quality and were therefore excluded from meta-analyses. For studies report-
ing service use before death, assumptions were made about which outcomes are preferable
based on existing literature [4,57,62], e.g., that hospital deaths are less favourable than deaths
at home or that emergency admission in the last months of life represents an adverse outcome.
Subgroup analysis found little variation by country, with the pooled ORs indicating significant
pro–high-SEP associations in most countries. The pooled ORs from the South Korean studies
on the association between education and place of death, and the Australian studies on the
association between area deprivation and access to specialist palliative, are notable exceptions,

deprivation (0 being least deprived, 50 being most deprived) and the log-odds of not receiving specialist palliative care, compared to
the least area-deprived group. The circles represent the dose-specific estimates from the 16 included studies
[21,32,34,66,67,68,86,98–109]; each study contributes 2, 3, or 4 circles reflecting the number of area-deprivation categories included
in the study (the reference category, the least deprived group, is not plotted), and the size of the circle corresponds to the inverse of
its total variance. The regression line calculated using the 2-stage glst command in Stata with random effects accounting for within-
study dependence reflects a significant positive relationship between dose of area deprivation and likelihood of receiving specialist
palliative care (for a 10× unit increase in dose β = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.05, p < 0.001).

 both suggesting pro–low-SEP inequality albeit with nonsignificant confidence intervals. Dif-
ferent models of care, sociocultural norms around death and dying, and different levels of
need are potential explanations for between-country differences. More robust comparison of
countries is limited in this review by the small number of studies available from each country.
SEP is a multidimensional construct, as such composite measures combining multiple
domains are likely to be the most effective means for capturing statistical variance around SEP
[49,50,111]. Area-based indices made up of multiple indicators of SEP are commonly used in
this literature and are well suited to monitoring inequality and accounting for confounding
from SEP. However, composite measures—area based or otherwise—are less informative
about the mechanisms through which SEP might influence outcomes. Area-based measures,
whilst being easily linked to patient addresses, are also limited by the ecological fallacy—the
assumption that people residing in the same area all share the same deprivation profile. The
individual-level measures of SEP commonly used in the studies in this review—education,
income, private medical insurance status, or housing tenure—each have benefits and chal-
lenges surrounding ease of collection, sufficient sensitivity, and population appropriateness
[112]. Essential for a better aetiological understanding of social inequality at the end of life are
studies designed specifically for purposes that employ well thought-out measures of SEP and
are guided by hypotheses about the relationships between factors [111].
Causal explanations for social patterning in other areas of health have been usefully deter-
mined [113]. SEP across the life course influences health through a number of biological, phys-
iological, and environmental mechanisms [114,115, 116]. For care received in the last year of
life, proximal social determinants such as ability to pay for care, housing conditions suitable
for supporting care at home, understanding and awareness of illness, and availability of ser-
vices are likely to be important [13]. The cumulative effect of low SEP and worse health—and
interrelationships between SEP and other factors known to be important to end-of-life care,
such as social support, age, race, and sexuality—are also critical to understand and as yet
remain largely unexplored in research. Future studies that use hypothesis-generating qualita-
tive methods and that consider multiple social factors in combination through multilevel and
structural models—rather than simply controlling for each as a confounder—could usefully be
employed to investigate these relationships.
Evaluation of end-of-life care interventions rarely consider differential outcomes for groups
according to SEP, and few interventions have been developed to specifically reduce social
inequality in care received towards the end of life; to our knowledge, no review of the effective-
ness of current interventions exists. Interventions shown to reduce social inequality outside of
end-of-life care offer promising examples, particularly those targeting older people that share
similar objectives around managing care in community settings and enhancing quality of life
[117,118]. We have shown that social inequality may persist in the care received by people
towards the end of life; we must now consider what interventions are effective and begin to tar-
get resources at reducing social inequality.
There are some limitations to this review. The first relates to the observational nature of the
data included. There was high heterogeneity (I2) between studies reflecting variation in the
measurement of exposures, outcomes, and confounders, as well as in study design and popula-
tions. Nevertheless, a major strength is the inclusion of multiple exposure and outcome vari-
ables and a large number of observational studies. This necessitated a broad comparison of
studies, which ultimately limits the precision of the pooled estimates, even after applying ran-
dom-effects models. A second limitation is unaccounted confounding from factors related to
illness and disease. Many studies included a measure of diagnosis, comorbidity, or disease
severity; these varied and were not considered in either the quality evaluation or the analysis.
Because people with low SEP experience greater illness and disease—and disease profile also

 influences patterns of healthcare usage—the inclusion of illness-related factors as a confounder
in the association between SEP and the outcomes studied is likely to suppress the social gradi-
ent. That being said, illness and disease may also lie on the causal pathway from SEP to the out-
comes, making inclusion of illness-related confounders in studies seeking to explore the effect
of SEP questionable. Notwithstanding this, the analysis does not consider the important influ-
ence of illness and other potential confounders such as service and treatment availability. The
third limitation relates to the outcome variables. Assumptions were made about which service-
use outcomes are preferable, and these do not take into consideration individual or cultural
preferences, need or availability of care, or how these change over time at an individual or soci-
etal level. Fourth, this review was limited to studies from high-income countries. The assump-
tions made around preferable outcomes may not apply to low- and middle-income countries
in which healthcare needs and the availability of end-of-life care services are considerably
different from those in high-income countries [119]. Important data from low- and middle-
income countries is therefore not included. Most of the data were from the US, Canada, and
Europe. It is notable that just 7.0% of the included studies were from Asia—of the 682 full-text
articles assessed for eligibility, 49 (7.2%) were from Taiwan, 16 (2.3%) from Japan, 14 (2.1%)
from South Korea, and 3 (<1%) from Singapore. Therefore, conclusions regarding Asian
countries are less strong. A fifth limitation is bias in the identification of studies. The search
criteria were necessarily restricted to studies that mentioned SEP in the abstract; on this basis,
2 eligible studies [23,24] from the Henson review [8] used to develop the search strategy were
missed from the database search, and it is likely that, on this basis, other studies were missed as
well. Considerable effort was made to identify missing studies, hand searching the reference
lists of relevant reviews and consulting experts in the field. A further source of bias occurred
when eligible studies lacked sufficient information to be included; studies, e.g., [120,121] that
did not report an effect size when the association was nonsignificant were not included in the
analysis. Finally, given the observational nature of the studies included, we chose to analyse
adjusted effects to limit bias from confounding, and we extracted adjusted ORs because these
were most commonly used in the literature. However, the outcomes reported are common
(>10%), and thus the ORs are overestimations of relative risks; further work to quantify popu-
lation risk is needed.
Conclusion
We have found consistent evidence from high-income countries that low SEP is a risk factor
across several components of service use at the end of life, including dying in hospital rather
than at home, receiving acute hospital-based care in the last 3 months of life, and not receiving
specialist palliative care in the last year of life. We also found evidence of a pervasive social gra-
dient in place of death and use of specialist palliative care. These findings should stimulate
widespread efforts to reduce socioeconomic inequality towards the end of life. We recommend
that all research on care received towards the end of life should attempt to account for SEP,
end-of-life care interventions should be analysed for their different effects across the social
strata, and the planning and provision of end-of-life care services should consider SEP in local
populations.
