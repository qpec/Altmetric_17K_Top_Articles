Abstract Current published estimates of the prevalence of
hyperhidrosis in the United States are outdated and
underestimate the true prevalence of the condition. The
objectives of this study are to provide an updated estimate
of the prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the US population and
to further assess the severity and impact of sweating on
those affected by the condition. For the purposes of
obtaining prevalence, a nationally representative sample of
8160 individuals were selected using an online panel, and
information as to whether or not they experience hyper-
hidrosis was obtained. The 393 individuals (210 female,
244 non-Hispanic white, 27 black, mean age 40.3, SE 0.64)
who indicated that they have hyperhidrosis were asked
further questions, including body areas impacted, severity
of symptoms, age of onset, and socioemotional impact of
the condition. Current results estimate the prevalence of
hyperhidrosis at 4.8 %, which represents approximately
15.3 million people in the United States. Of these, 70 %
report severe excessive sweating in at least one body area.
In spite of this, only 51 % have discussed their excessive
sweating with a healthcare professional. The main reasons
are a belief that hyperhidrosis is not a medical condition
and that no treatment options exist. The current study’s
findings with regard to age of onset and prevalence by body
area generally align with the previous research. However,
current findings suggest that the severity and prevalence
are both higher than previously thought, indicating a need
for greater awareness of the condition and its associated
treatment options among medical professionals.

Introduction
Hyperhidrosis is a skin disorder characterized by sweating
in excess of what is required to maintain regulation of
normal body temperature [15]. Hyperhidrosis is classified
as either primary or secondary in nature. Primary hyper-
hidrosis is idiopathic; it results from over-activity of the
sympathetic nerves and involves a limited body area, most
often the axillae (underarms), palms, soles, or craniofacial
regions [21]. Secondary hyperhidrosis results from an
underlying medical condition or use of prescription medi-
cations and implicates the entire body [21].
Hyperhidrosis can range in severity from mild dampness
to severe dripping and can result in substantial impairment
in quality of life. This includes limitations in work and
social relationships, physical and leisure activities, and
impairments
in
emotional
and
mental
health
[1, 2, 4, 12, 17, 20]. The negative impact caused by
excessive sweating has been reported to be similar to, if not
greater than, the negative impact caused by conditions,
such as psoriasis and other chronic diseases [5, 17].
Given the widespread negative impact and potential
severity of hyperhidrosis, it is important to understand how
many people (in the United States) are afflicted with the
disorder. The most commonly cited estimate of prevalence
of primary hyperhidrosis in the United States is based on a
study published in 2004 [23]. Based on a survey mailed to
150,000 households in 2002, this study estimates that

 2.8 % of the U.S. population has primary hyperhidrosis.
They report prevalence rates are highest among those
25–64 years old (3.5–4.5 %) and lowest among those
younger than 12 years old (0.5–0.7 %). Furthermore, they
estimate that just over half (50.8 %; prevalence rate 1.4 %)
of those with hyperhidrosis experience excessive sweating
of the underarms (i.e., axillary hyperhidrosis) either in
isolation or in combination with another body area, making
it the most commonly affected area.
Prevalence estimates of primary (focal) hyperhidrosis
outside of the United States are all higher and vary widely,
ranging from 4.6 % in Germany, 5.5 % in Sweden, 12.3 %
in Vancouver, Canada, 12.8 % in Japan, and 14.5 % in
Shanghai, China [1, 7, 16, 20]. Prevalence estimates that
include both primary and secondary hyperhidrosis range
from 13.9 % in Japan, 16.3 % in Germany, 16.7 % in
Vancouver, 18.4 % in Shanghai, and 20.3 % in Sweden
[1, 7, 16, 20].
Modalities
to
treat
hyperhidrosis,
namely
axillary
hyperhidrosis, include topical (e.g., topical aluminum
chloride
hexahydrate),
oral
(e.g.,
anticholinergics),
injectable (e.g., botulinum toxin type A), iontophoresis (i.e.
mild electrical current through water), microwave ther-
molysis (e.g., miraDry), and surgical (e.g., endoscopic
thoracic sympathectomy), and all vary in their efficacy (in
terms of reduction in severity and duration of effect), side
effects, ease of use, and cost [6, 9–11, 17, 22]. Topical
treatments, such as prescription strength aluminum chlo-
ride antiperspirants, are the recommended first-line treat-
ment option for most cases of hyperhidrosis [21]. However,
while they can be moderately effective in the short term,
they have shown less satisfactory results in the long run
and are oftentimes associated with intolerable skin irrita-
tion at the application site. More efficacious treatment
options have the primary drawbacks of being relatively
invasive, costly and/or have less compelling evidence
regarding their safety [21]. Additional treatment methods
that are under development include: new versions of laser
therapy, micro-focused ultrasound treatment, topical botu-
linum
toxin
type
A,
and
topical
anticholinergics
[3, 8, 13, 18].
Given higher prevalence rates in other countries, we
hypothesize that the prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the
United States is conservative. Furthermore, the actual
prevalence is likely higher than the previous estimates
suggest, because hyperhidrosis is both underreported by
patients and underdiagnosed by healthcare professionals
(HCPs) [1, 19]. The primary purpose of the present study is
to provide an updated estimate of hyperhidrosis prevalence
overall and by body area among the US population, and to
assess the severity and associated impact of sweating on
those affected by hyperhidrosis.
Materials and methods
Prevalence estimate sample
A total of 275,904 invitations were sent via email for a self-
administered online survey. A total of 12,363 people
entered the survey (response rate 4.5 %), with 8160 people
providing information as to whether or not they experience
hyperhidrosis. The sample sources were two online panel
providers, which both consist of nationally representative
samples of U.S. households. The current study’s sample
was balanced to represent US census parameters (Table 1).
The numbers in Table 1 reflect the characteristics of the
adults who responded to the survey. Any parents were also
asked how many children (regardless of age) they have, if
any, who experience hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating.
Children under the age of 18 reported as having hyper-
hidrosis here were included in the prevalence estimate.
Hyperhidrosis sufferers
A subset of the participants identified as having hyper-
hidrosis for the prevalence estimate were asked more
specific questions about their experiences with hyper-
hidrosis. A total of 393 (210 female, 244 non-Hispanic
white, 27 black, mean age 40.3, SE 0.64) participants
completed the more detailed survey (305 adults answering
for themselves and 88 parents answering on behalf of their
child with hyperhidrosis). In addition to the two online
panel providers mentioned previously, the International
Hyperhidrosis Society (IHS) was enlisted to help recruit
parents of children with the condition. Comparisons of
ratings between parents of children obtained from the
online panels and from the IHS were compared and no
meaningful differences in responses were evidenced.
Survey description
The survey used in this study included questions designed
to identify individuals with hyperhidrosis, irrespective of
whether they have received a medical diagnosis. For the
purposes of this study, hyperhidrosis was defined as
A condition that involves chronic excessive sweating
of the underarms, hands, feet, face, groin, or other
bodily areas, which is much more than what is nor-
mal, and occurs regardless of temperature, exercise or
situation, and may have an impact on quality of life.
Female participants who experienced both hyperhidrosis
and night sweats/hot flashes that may be associated with
menopause were disqualified if they self-reported the
inability to distinguish between the two conditions.

 Other information collected in the survey included age
of onset, occurrence, and severity of symptoms (severity
was assessed by body area using the four-point, single-item
Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) [14]. The
HDSS asks respondents to rate the severity of their
symptoms based on tolerability and interference with daily
activities. Specifically, respondents are asked whether their
sweating is:
1.
never noticeable and never interferences with daily
activities;
2.
tolerable but sometimes interferes with daily activities;
3.
barely tolerable and frequently interferes with daily
activities or;
4.
intolerable and always interferes with daily activities.
Any body area where the sweating was classified as
never noticeable/never interferes was not included in the
calculation for occurrence of symptoms by body area.
Results
Prevalence
The prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the survey sample was
4.8 %, which represents approximately 15.3 million people
when extrapolated to the US population. The prevalence
rate is highest among 18–39 years old (8.8 %) and lowest
among adults 65? years old and children/adolescents
(2.1 %; Table 2).
Interestingly, this study found that only 51 % of
hyperhidrosis sufferers have discussed their condition with
an HCP. Children/adolescents (
\
21 years old) with the
condition are almost twice as likely to be seen by an HCP
(81 %) than their adult counterparts (42 %; Table 3). The
most commonly cited reasons for not discussing their
condition with an HCP are that they do not think it is a
medical condition (60 %), or that they believe that there is
nothing that can be done to treat their excessive sweating
(47 %). Of those who do see an HCP about their excessive

 sweating, only 53 % are diagnosed (73 % of children/
adolescents, 43 % of adults; Table 3).
Occurrence, severity, and age of onset by body area
Overall, 20 % of hyperhidrosis sufferers report that their
excessive sweating is isolated to one body area. The most
commonly reported body area where hyperhidrosis occurs
is the underarms (Table 4). Sixty-five percent of respon-
dents report experiencing axillary hyperhidrosis, either in
isolation (10 % of total respondents) or in combination
with other body areas (55 % of total respondents). The
most commonly cited area that co-occurs with the under-
arms is the head/face (29 % of total respondents).
Overall, 70 % report that their excessive sweating is
severe in at least one body area. Severity in total and by
individual body areas can be found in Table 4. Severe
sweating rates range from 31 % under the breasts to 54 %
for palmar hyperhidrosis.
The mean age of onset overall is just under 20 years
(M 19.7, SE 0.5) and is fairly consistent across all body
areas (Table 4), except that age of onset tends to be
younger for those with palmar (M 16.6, SE 0.6) and plantar
(M 17.6, SE 0.7) hyperhidrosis.
Impact of hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis sufferers feel a great negative impact on
their lives due to the condition. About three quarters of
respondents report that excessive sweating has had at least
some negative impact on their social life, sense of well-
being, emotional health, and mental health (Table 5).
Overall, a large majority of respondents agree that
excessive sweating is embarrassing (85 %), and has caused
them to experience anxiety (71 %; Table 6). Furthermore,
35 % agree that they have had to sacrifice many important
things in their life because of the condition. Given the
widespread negative impact of hyperhidrosis, it is not
surprising that over half (54 %) of respondents say that
they would pay anything for a treatment to stop their
excessive sweating.
Discussion
This study seeks to update the current understanding of the
prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the United States and its
clinical presentation in terms of age of onset, body areas,
and severity. The current study’s findings with regard to

 age of onset and prevalence by body area generally align
with the previous research [10, 23]. However, findings
from this study suggest that the severity and prevalence (in
the United States) are both higher than previously thought.
Many studies have demonstrated that hyperhidrosis can
have a severe and pervasive impact on quality of life
[2, 4, 5, 12, 17, 23]. In terms of HDSS categories, the
previous studies have estimated that approximately one-
third of people with hyperhidrosis present with a severe
form of the disease [23]. This study estimates that 70 % of
people with hyperhidrosis experience severe sweating on at
least one body area, as indicated by the sweating being
either barely tolerable or intolerable and frequently or
always interfering with daily activities. This study also
finds further evidence that quality of life is significantly
impaired for hyperhidrosis sufferers. About three quarters
of respondents report that excessive sweating has had at
least some negative impact on their social life, sense of
wellbeing, emotional health, and mental health, and more
than half are desperate enough to indicate that they would
pay anything for a treatment to stop the sweating.
The most comprehensive review of prevalence of
hyperhidrosis in the United States was provided by Strutton
and colleagues [23]. Using a paper survey mailed to
150,000 households, they estimated that 2.8 % (7.8 million
individuals) are affected by hyperhidrosis. They concluded
that the ‘‘disease affects a much larger proportion of indi-
viduals in the United States than previously thought’’ (p.
247). Current findings, given all of the methodological
details discussed herein, indicate that the prevalence of
hyperhidrosis is about 2 % higher than previously thought
and currently impacts about 15.3 million individuals, or
4.8 % of the U.S. population. Of these 15.3 million indi-
viduals, only just over half will discuss their excessive
sweating with an HCP and, ultimately, only 27 % will be
diagnosed. There is further evidence, therefore, that the
condition remains both underreported and underdiagnosed.
The most often-cited reasons for not seeking treatment are
beliefs that hyperhidrosis is not a medical condition and
that there is nothing that can be done to treat their exces-
sive sweating.
Even though the 4.8 % estimate is higher than previ-
ously thought for the U.S. population, it is still far below
prevalence reported in other countries [1, 7, 16, 20], indi-
cating that the current finding may still be a conservative
estimate.

 estimates are not known, although demographical, geo-
graphical, diagnostic criteria, and methodologies used for
estimating prevalence differ between studies [16]. This
study may also differ from other reports due to some
limitations.
This study shares a limitation with Strutton and col-
leagues in that survey research is, by its nature, subject to
selection bias. While the online panel partners leveraged
for this study are comprised of a nationally representative
set of potential respondents, online research can only reach
individuals who have access to online resources. However,
an advantage of using an online panel relative to an
omnibus survey mailer (method used by Strutton and col-
leagues) is that the incoming sample can be continually
monitored and adjusted. Furthermore, outgoing invitations
were balanced to compensate for known response bias.
These methods resulted in a sample which accurately
represents the US population.
Another potential limitation of the current research is
that the identification of people with hyperhidrosis is not
based on a medical diagnosis or clinical assessment.
Instead, it is self-reported based on a clinical definition of
the disease that was provided to the respondents. However,
given that so many patients never see an HCP (current
study estimates 49 %) and ultimately remain undiagnosed
(current study estimates 73 %), self-assessment will con-
tinue to be necessary to better estimate the true prevalence.
That said, menopausal females who self-reported an
inability to differentiate between night sweats/hot flashes
and the symptoms of hyperhidrosis were excluded from the
study, but other clinical assessments or diagnostic criteria
may have excluded additional individuals. This was also a
limitation of the Strutton and colleagues study, so the
comparison of prevalence estimates between the two
studies is not hindered. However, the exclusion of meno-
pausal females who cannot differentiate between their
symptoms may be a contributor to the current study’s
prevalence being lower than what is reported in other
countries.
Conclusions
The hyperhidrosis prevalence estimates provided by this
research indicate that hyperhidrosis impacts an additional
2 % of the United States population above what has pre-
viously been estimated (15.3 million people or 4.8 %) [23].
Of these people, only about half discuss their condition
with an HCP suggesting that the actual prevalence may be,
in fact, underreported. For individuals who seek treatment,
their physicians will need more effective (first-line) treat-
ment options at their disposal to have more confidence in
identifying and diagnosing the condition. Among the
majority of those who do not seek treatment, there is a lack
of awareness of hyperhidrosis as a medical condition that
has treatment options available. The fact that only half of
those with hyperhidrosis do not consult an HCP is espe-
cially alarming given that current results indicate 70 % of
individuals experience severe sweating in at least one area.
Furthermore, the widespread negative impact of hyper-
hidrosis, especially on sufferers’ social lives, sense of
wellbeing, and emotional and mental health, is further
documented by these individuals. Ultimately, there are 15.3
million people in the United States (far more than previ-
ously thought) with hyperhidrosis that can result in severe
impairment in their daily lives, and many of them are not
diagnosed or treated.
